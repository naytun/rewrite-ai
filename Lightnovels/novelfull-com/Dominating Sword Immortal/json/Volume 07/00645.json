A breeze would blow through occasionally as the raindrops fell down from the sky, drawing beautiful lines in the sky.</p><p>On the peak of the mountain which was covered up by the clouds most of the times, it was only during the raining season that it would get a bit clearer, revealing its true identity to the world.</p><p>Sitting on a massive rock on the peak of the mountain, Ye Chen did not put up a protective Zhen yuan layer as he just let the rain fall onto his body.</p><p>Since he was trying to understand the nature, it would be better for him to be in contact with the nature.</p><p>The peak of the mountain was not completely flat. As the rain got heavier, some of the dents in the ground filled up into little ponds that spread out in the whole area. When the raindrops fell into the ponds, they brought up waves of patterns. Ye Chen stared at them as he fell into deep contemplation.</p><p>Booint! Booint!</p><p>The pattern appeared, expanded, disappeared…</p><p>…and the cycle repeated itself.</p><p>Not knowing how long it had been, Ye Chen let out a deep breath as he exited his contemplation.</p><p>“Nature is indeed amazing! Some of the simplest details can make people ponder over them for ages. But, I guess if normal people see this, they can only create some normal martial arts. Only the powerful ones would be able to create unimaginable profound sense martial arts from these observations.”</p><p>When Ye Chen saw the rain before this, he had thought of nothing. But, after he created his Gold Pattern martial art, he started to think about the profound of water. In his eyes, the sky was like an ultimate sword artist while the raindrops were the travel route for the sword. The raindrop bringing up the pattern in the water pond would be the representation of its power. One raindrop would be one attack, and millions and millions of them would form countless attacks.</p><p>Ye Chen was awed by it all.</p><p>His body flew into the sky as he took out a normal longsword, performing his sword arts. As he waved out his sword, each movement would bring up a ring of see-through gold pattern.</p><p>It was indeed the Gold Pattern attack.</p><p>It would be not hard to tell that although the power of the attack did not increase by much, he seemed to go more smoothly and easily when he performed it.</p><p>…</p><p>There was always material for martial geniuses to discuss.</p><p>In a restaurant in a city somewhere inside the Sky Martial Region, a huge number of powerful warriors gathered together. They were drinking and chatting, creating a cordial atmosphere.</p><p>“Have you heard? Two shockingly powerful martial geniuses appeared in the Sky Martial Region! One of them is called Helian Wuhua, and the other one is called Shangguan Fei.”</p><p>“I had heard about it a long time ago! When the fourth level of the treasury tower had opened, they were in there as well. Back then, no one had heard about them at all, so they were hidden in the dark. But now that we are hearing their names, it obviously means that they were powerful enough to be recognized.”</p><p>If Ye Chen was here, then he would definitely know what they were talking about. There were dozens of people at the tower whom he could not recognize, and there were three of them who were the most powerful. Besides Situ Hao, the remaining two would definitely be the ones in question.</p><p>“I have heard about it as well. These two were nobodies before. However, Helian Wuhua had beaten Huo Yun master, who was ranked 69th on the ranking, while Shangguan Fei had beaten Hei Shui Master, who was ranked sixty-three. The former used only three attacks while the latter used only four. How powerful!”</p><p>“I had not expected to see that the ranking would change again within a year. This year’s ranking would include so many more warriors.”</p><p>“Naturally! However, you guys have not heard it, right? Half a year ago, Situ Hao, a young warrior on the ranking, challenged another master level warrior as well. He won with only one attack!”</p><p>“Beaten who? One attack? I think that master level warrior must be quite low in the ranking, right? Otherwise, how come he could be beaten with only one attack?” Someone questioned.</p><p>“You guys really don’t go around, do you? Situ Hao had beaten indeed Break Sword Master Tu Yuan!”</p><p>“What!” The crowd was shocked.</p><p>Tu Yuan was not a simple master level warrior. In fact, he was ranked 33rd on the ranking, which was even 15 slots higher than Ye Chen. And Situ Hao had managed to beat him with only one sword attack. It was indeed monstrous, perhaps ten times more shocking than the news about Helian Wuhua and Shangguan Fei.</p><p>“You sure you heard it right? How could he beat him with only one attack?”</p><p>“Why would I lie to you? I was there right then. I saw him flick out his finger once, and that longsword of his came out on its own, throwing out one sword attack and severely wounding Tu Yuan.”</p><p>“Sword Mastery…It is a sword spell that had been long lost. Situ Hao had found it…” That was the first time people started to have an idea how powerful Situ Hao was.</p><p>Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong!</p><p>A string of hurried footsteps was heard as a human shadow walked over.</p><p>“Hurry! Hurry! Beiming Hui is challenging one of the top sword master warriors, Lin Chaonan. What are you guys waiting for?” The guy said in a hurried tone.</p><p>“What! Beiming Hui is challenging Lin Chaonan?”</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>Lin Chaonan was indeed one of the top blade artists, ranking 19th on the list. His power would be at the same level as the top five young warriors. On the contrary, Beiming Hui only became famous from the beginning of the year. Him somehow daring to challenge Lin Chaonan was indeed a shocking news.</p><p>Without even walking on the stairs, everyone flew out of the windows. As they did, so did a whole lot more people, flying toward outside of the town.</p><p>All of a sudden, all of the warriors in the city seemed to be on the move.</p><p>Thirty miles outside the city was a long river, and a lot of the warriors were already gathered there. It was so loud here with all the chatters that one could almost see the ground moving.</p><p>“I don’t know what Beiming Hui is thinking. If he wanted to pick someone, he should pick someone weak. Why is he picking Lin Chaonan?”</p><p>“The whole fame might have just gotten into his head, making him want to get a bit further. Lin Chaonan is ranked 19th after all. After beating him, Beiming Hui would be able to prove his power for sure, standing way ahead of Ye Chen, Du Gujue, and the rest.”</p><p>“That makes sense. But, I do not think highly of him.”</p><p>“Me neither, to be honest!”</p><p>Lin Chaonan weighed so heavily in everyone’s heart. Not to mention Beiming Hui, even if it were Ye Chen, no one would think that he could win. In their opinion, amongst the five young warriors, besides Bai Wuxue and Lu Shaoyou, the other three would have similar power as Lin Chaonan. Under that condition, it would be really hard to have a winner among even them.</p><p>In the sky, the two human shadows clashed together.</p><p>Lin Chaonan had a long blade behind him as he spoke coldly, “Beiming Hui, I admit that you are an impressive martial genius, but it is way too early for you to challenge me.”</p><p>Beiming Hui chuckled lightly, “Shen Qianlang had been beaten by Xiao Chuhe twice, so it is your turn now. But, I am a spear user, so I will not fight for the top three blade master level warrior title now.”</p><p>Lin Chaonan frowned, “You really are going to challenge me? You know, I will not go easy on you. If I do not control it well enough, perhaps it would even wound you badly.”</p><p>He had decided to teach the other a lesson; otherwise, it seemed like everyone would come to challenge him, which would be a waste of time.</p><p>“Do not worry. With me, you have to use all of your power.”</p><p>Beiming Hui had trained the second movement of his Sky Bank for another long while after he invented it. However, the movement would have to be used on an opponent; otherwise, it would be hard to spot any differences. But right now, he would not go to challenge Ye Chen, and would need another powerful warrior for him to test out the new movement. It would not make sense if it were a weak opponent, and neither would he have the confidence to take on a powerful one. Therefore, he picked Lin Chaonan.</p><p>“Since you are this confident, then let’s cut the crap, shall we?” Lin Chaonan did not take out his blade as he looked at Beiming Hui coldly.</p><p>“Not taking out your blade?” Beiming Hui smiled a little before he shot out his long spear. It was like a silver flood dragon as it attacked toward Lin Chaonan.</p><p>“So fast!”</p><p>Lin Chaonan miscalculated a bit and had to back out immediately as he took out his long blade, blocking it before that incoming dragon.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A shockwave spread out from here, and Lin Chaonan was looking a bit caught off guard.</p><p>“Use all of your power! Otherwise, you will not be enough for me to even get serious.” Just now, his opponent had underestimated him, so Beiming Hui was more than able to beat his opponent with one attack. But, he did not do so. He needed his opponent to use all of his power, which would be the only way for him to test out his new attack.</p><p>“As you wish!”</p><p>Lin Chaonan’s expression started to look serious. This Beiming Hui looked like trouble to him now, and he realized that he had underestimated the latter.</p><p>“Moon Cut!”</p><p>The crystal white moonlight shone from the long blade as Lin Chaonan bent his body. He was like a bouncing pellet traveling at an unbelievable speed. Midair, he threw out a blade attack which was so fast that it was impossible to see its movement, looking just like a ray of moonlight.</p><p>“Interesting! There seems to be some power there.” Beiming Hui nodded satisfyingly.</p><p>“Sky Bank!”</p><p>He did not perform his second movement; instead, he shook his right arm once, and the silver flood dragon like long spear was stabbed forward quickly. Because the speed was so fast, his hand had disappeared along with the long spear. It was like it had entered the surreal space.</p><p>Ting!</p><p>The invisible spear light landed onto Lin Chaonan’s blade light immediately, and he was blown backward.</p><p>“Lin Chaonan, these two attacks are only warmups! The following spear attack will be the real attack, so you better watch out.”</p><p>Diving down, Beiming Hui performed his killing attack. The long spear disappeared again, shooting out five twisting or straight silver rays. These lines looked extraordinary in the air and caused the audience to gasp in awe.</p><p>Ting!</p><p>Lin Chaonan had only blocked out one beam of silver ray while the remaining four landed on his chest, stomach, right arm, and thigh.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>As he puked out a mouthful of blood, the long blade in Lin Chaonan’s hand lost control. It flew out while spinning before plugging itself into the wall of the mountain.</p><p>“Lin Chaonan lost!”</p><p>The result was too shocking, and everyone could not believe their eyes.</p><p>“It really happened…When did this Beiming Hui become this powerful? Even Lin Chaonan was not his opponent! In other words…he is already at top five young warriors’ level?”</p><p>“We thought before that Ye Chen might be the one with the greatest possibility to get into that level. I had not expected to see Beiming Hui getting there so fast. What a surprise!”</p><p>As everyone chatted, Lin Chaonan stood on that peak, the sword on the wall below him. He looked at Beiming Hui in shock. He had not been able to process the fact that he had just lost to him.</p><p>Beiming Hui’s voice was heard, “Very well! You are indeed one of the top master level blade artists, as you have even managed to block out one attack. I think it was definitely a good decision to come to you first for this test ride.”</p><p>“Looking for me for the test ride?”</p><p>Lin Chaonan was both angry and bitter. He had not expected either that he would lose to a newcomer who had just earned some reputation.</p><p>“Being able to be the target for this battle, you should be proud of yourself already.” Beiming Hui did not even look at Lin Chaonan’s face anymore as he flew into the distance, soon disappearing completely in the horizon.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
