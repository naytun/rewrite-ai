They seemed to have more plants and greens than the other mountains nearby.</p><p>Although the mountain was not that big, it was still covering seven-eight miles. Inside the mountain was a small valley which was covered in veins. Countless small red flowers grew on top. Inside the valley was a huge area of flat ground that was covered in countless yellow dots. They were flower buds that were about to blossom.</p><p>In the middle of the flat ground, a young man in blue sat on the ground with his legs tucked below him as he absorbed the yuan qi from the valley.</p><p>“Two months ago, my Amaranthine Nature Art had reached one hundred and twenty percent. One month ago, I infused the fast profound into the martial attack, and a new sword movement was created a week ago. However, within this one week, I have only been absorbing yuan qi and learning the movement in nature. But, I had no time to perform this newly invented sword moment yet. I wonder how powerful it would be now.”</p><p>The fast profound was too hard to learn. It was not even an element, nor something with a shape or form. It was completely a created concept. Therefore, Ye Chen could only try to figure it out by studying the movement of birds or wind. He had even tried to learn about fast profound by studying plants’ growth. Anyway, the fast profound was still a lot easier to follow compared to the slow profound.</p><p>As for the thought of wanting to fuse the fast profound into his Amaranthine Nature Art was something he had considered months ago. He could sense that the fast profound alone would not change anything, since no matter how fast the sword art could be, it would mean nothing if it could not make through the defense. However, if the fast profound was infused into one of his most powerful ace attacks, then it would mean a completely different thing; it would elevate the power to a whole another level.</p><p>Luckily, Ye Chen was also extremely powerful with his soul. This kind of an abstract concept, such as the fast profound, was nothing too hard for him. Otherwise, it would be unbelievably hard to carry out the infusion.</p><p>“Earlier, I thought that there was no connection between the profound of wood and fast. But now, I think there is on some level. The wood profound is the profound for growing plants, which naturally comes with fast or slow speeds, since they cannot grow all of a sudden.”</p><p>…</p><p>Right in front of Murong family, beams of light flew over. The leading man was a young man in silver robes with a long spear on his back.</p><p>Feeling that oppressing aura, the whole Murong family boiled up. It was almost at the same second that dozens of Sea of Souls Realm warriors jumped into the sky.</p><p>“Who is there?”</p><p>It was Murong Wu, one of the masters of the Murong family, also one of the uncles of Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>The person “standing” right next to Beiming Hui asked with a loud voice, “Is Ye Chen here?”</p><p>Murong Wu frowned, “What are you looking for him for? He is training.” Ye Chen would rarely come to Murong family, but he just happened to be here this time.</p><p>“Oh, since he is here right now, then pass on a message to him. Ask him to come out to battle.”</p><p>“Battle? With whom?”</p><p>Murong Wu was not surprised. Challenges normally came with fame. Unconsciously, his eyes locked onto the young man in silver robes.</p><p>“Me…” The young man in silver said lightly.</p><p>“Who are you?”</p><p>“Beiming Hui!”</p><p>Right then, a lot of other people came out as well, including the leader of the Murong family, Murong Zhishui, Su Ruhui, as well as Murong Qingcheng. They all heard what he had just said.</p><p>“What? Beiming Hui? He is that Beiming Hui!”</p><p>“Silver robe, silver hair, long silver spear…It is indeed Beiming Hui’s outfit! I could not believe that he would come all the way here to challenge warrior Ye.”</p><p>“He is so arrogant! Ye Chen has been famous for a long time. Even Du Gujue would not dare to come to challenge him so early in advance. He had only been famous not that long ago, and had only beaten Lan Xieqing, who had lost to Ye Chen before as well. There is nothing worth him being so proud and arrogant.”</p><p>“Does he think that Ye Chen would battle him just because that he said so?”</p><p>Beiming Hui indeed brought some shock to the Murong family, since he was able to chase Lan Xieqing all the way back to his martial institution, which was not something anybody could do. Even if he decided to go challenge Du Gujue, no one would have said anything. However, he wanted to challenge Ye Chen, which could be regarded as a dream.</p><p>Over at the steep mountain, Chu Zhongtian looked down at what was happening and mumbled to himself, “It seems like Ye Chen is indeed here. I wonder if he would accept the challenge. I think he would though, since this Beiming Hui came so aggressively. I don’t think he would leave without achieving what he came here for.”</p><p>“What? Ye Chen does not dare to come out and accept this battle?” Warriors standing right next to Beiming Hui said sarcastically.</p><p>Hearing him, Murong Zhishui walked out and took a look at Beiming Hui and those people behind him as he said, “I am the leader of the Murong family, Murong Zhishui. Warrior Beiming, since you want to challenge Ye Chen, how about a proposed time? He is training at this moment. I do not think he will have time to reply shortly. Also, I do not know if he would be willing to accept the challenge. However, a time could be arranged.”</p><p>Beiming Hui sneered, “His time is valuable, but is mine not? I think you guys should ask him to come out. I will see him if he would accept the challenge.”</p><p>Murong Zhishui’s expression sank a bit as he said, “Beiming warrior, if I had gotten the news right, you had only been famous a couple of months ago, right? That Lan Xieqing had also been beaten by Ye Chen before. If you think you could challenge Ye Chen after beating Lan Xieqing, then I think you will be horribly disappointed.”</p><p>Beiming Hui squeezed his eyes, “So you are saying that my power is not as mighty as Ye Chen’s?”</p><p>“Since Beiming warrior has put it this way, then I will be honest as well. Ye Chen is not afraid of challenges, but it would have to be worth it. Meaningless battles would not be something he is interested in. If his training is interrupted, then that would not be worth it.”</p><p>Ye Chen was his future son-in-law, so Murong Zhishui would definitely be talking for him. He would also not want any strangers talking down on his son-in-law either. If Ye Chen had to take on every warrior that ever challenged him, then he would have no time for anything else.</p><p>“Hehe!” Beiming Hui chuckled. It was almost like he was talking to himself as he said, “I think if I do not reveal some of my real power, I will not be able to see Ye Chen today. Ah well, I guess I will have to tell him what kind of power I have before challenging him after all.”</p><p>“If you can take a spear attack of mine, then I will leave immediately without saying an extra word. But if you cannot, then please go ask Ye Chen to come out.” Beiming Hui took out that long spear from his back and lifted it all the way up into the sky.</p><p>“One attack!”</p><p>Murong Zhishui’s eyebrows flicked up. Although he was no top master level warrior, it would be rather impossible for him to not be able to handle one attack of his opponent. However, in case of emergencies, he had demonized both of his arms already. That rich powerful Zhen yuan shot up into the sky.</p><p>“Sky Bank!”</p><p>Beiming Hui slowly said those two words as he held the long spear with his right hand. A spear stabbed out at a seemingly slow speed, but was actually extremely fast.</p><p>“Father! Watch out!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng’s eyebrows rose up as the black bat wings appeared behind her back at a mysterious speed. Her body flashed once before reappearing in front of her father.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was too late.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Murong Zhishui was blown backward. His face was full of a shocked expression, a circular qi flow blossoming on his chest.</p><p>There was a tiny blood hole in the middle.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Murong Qingcheng with wings appeared right in front of Murong Zhishui. Her extreme speed made it look like it happened within the second, that shadow she dragged out looking just like the real her.</p><p>“Eh? Such a fast speed.”</p><p>Beiming Hui was a bit surprised. This attack of his was the first movement of his Sky Bank. With one spear attacked out, the whole world would be within the reach of a hand. But obviously, Murong Qingcheng’s speed was still slower than his spear attack, but it should not be that slow either. Of course, it also had something to do with him not trying his best as well.</p><p>“Interesting…” Beiming Hui started to get intrigued by Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>“I am alright!” Murong Zhishui was worried of Su Ruhui and Murong Qingcheng being too concerned,so he hurried to say. Even though he was so shocked at how fast that spear attack was since he was fully prepared for anything before, he still could not even see how it all happened. In other words, if Beiming Hui wanted to kill him, it would only take him one spear.</p><p>‘One attack to kill me!’ Murong Zhishui looked a bit sad.</p><p>“Zhishui!” Su Ruhui ran over and held onto Murong Zhishui.</p><p>Touching her hand, Murong Zhishui lifted up his head and said after taking a deep breath, “Alright! Right now I will send someone to invite Ye Chen. However, it is not my call if he wants to accept the challenge or not.”</p><p>“Father, I will go!”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng saw that her father was okay, so she flapped her black bat wings and flew over toward where Ye Chen was training. Soon, only a black dot in the sky could be seen.</p><p>Beiming Hui looked at Murong Qingcheng’s back as a strange look flashed across his face.</p><p>“This Beiming Hui is so powerful! I had no idea how he attacked. It was just one spear that blew our leader away.”</p><p>“Yeah! No wonder he dared to challenge our future leader Ye Chen.”</p><p>Everyone exchanged some looks, sensing that this whole situation might take a wrong turn.</p><p>Over on the peak, Chu Zhongtian frowned. “This spear attack is so fast! I would definitely not be able to avoid that. I just wonder exactly how powerful that attack is.”</p><p>His evil spirit body had a very powerful defense. Even the barbarians, who were known for their defense, were a piece of cake for him. Therefore, the speed would not mean much if the power was missing. A couple of months ago when he battled with Lin Tian, the latter had almost been killed by him.</p><p>…</p><p>On the grassland in the valley, Ye Chen let out a breath. That breath moved the grasses, making their color somehow brighter, and making them a bit taller even.</p><p>Slowly standing up, Ye Chen held a normal longsword in his right hand. He waved it up slightly, creating a sword qi that was like a gentle breeze. Its movement and form were impossible to detect; all one could feel would be that gentle breeze that did not seem to come from anywhere. It was such a strange feeling that it almost felt like an illusion.</p><p>But then, something horrifying happened!</p><p>Wherever the sword qi touched, the grasses on the ground started to grow at a visibly fast speed, already getting knee high within the second. Those flower buds started blossoming as well, four flower petals for each yellow flower, each one of them already full grown.</p><p>With one sword, all of the plants and flowers grew.</p><p>Normal wood profound would definitely not be able to do so. Or more accurately, Ye Chen’s currently wood profound would find it impossible to achieve. The only reason that this was happening was that he had infused the fast profound into his wood profound martial art, which had an effect of speeding things up.</p><p>This sword was even more mysterious than his gold pattern martial art. But of course, Ye Chen had still yet to reveal exactly how powerful his gold pattern sword art was.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
