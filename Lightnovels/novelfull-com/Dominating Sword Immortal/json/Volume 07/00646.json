It was not hard to imagine the shock on people’s faces when they heard the news.</p><p>“Lin Chaonan lost to Beiming Hui!”</p><p>When Xiao Chuhe heard the news, the expression on his face was strange. He had planned to target Lin Chaonan next as well, since being one of the fellow top three master level blade artists, he could not ignore Lin Chaonan. However, it seemed like Beiming Hui was one step quicker than him.</p><p>“It looks like I will have to change my plan. Before I challenge Lu Shaoyou, I will have to clear out all the blockages.”</p><p>Xiao Chuhe was also one of the top master level blade artists. With Beiming Hui beating Lin Chaonan, it would not be unreasonable for people to start thinking that he might not be able to beat Beiming Hui either. And, these kind of rumors going on as he went to challenge Lu Shaoyou were not something Xiao Chuhe wanted.</p><p>“Brother Lin lost?”</p><p>The leader of the top three master level blade artists, Xie Baiting, had also learned the news. He was slightly shocked as well before he went back to normal quickly. For him, this kind of thing happened all the time. In the past decades, besides him staying as one of the top three master level blade artists all this time, the other two had been changing constantly. Even for him, he had beaten the former leader of the three as well.</p><p>“It is getting more and more interesting, I see…”</p><p>Xie Baiting revealed a smile. He could vaguely sense it that there would be an interesting moment not far in the future where everyone would go to the next level. And right now was only the beginning.</p><p>“Lin Chaonan lost!” Contrasting to Xie Baiting’s calmness, a smile appeared on Shen Qianlang’s face. He had already noticed a long time ago that this era would belong to the young generation. But, what he had not expected was that it would come this quickly and aggressively. Right now, even Lin Chaonan had lost. He wondered how many of the “oldies” could last until the end.</p><p>“Right now, it is still slightly lacking, I will let them enjoy it for the time being.”</p><p>Chu Zhongtian was very calm. Within the next one to two years, he was not planning to be too overly flamboyant with his power, because he knew that it was not the right time yet. Being high profiled would need enough power to back it up. Without it, doing it would just be pure stupidity.</p><p>If Ye Chen had heard Chu Zhongtian’s thought, he would really admire the latter. After all, if Chu Zhongtian from before was an exploding volcano, then he was a super volcano right now that was accumulating power. Once he had enough of it, he would shine the kind of light that was never seen before.</p><p>Regardless of what people though, right now, Beiming Hui was on top of the world in terms of reputation. It was enough to be compared with the top five young warriors, outshining Ye Chen and Du Gujue. At the same time, the top young martial warriors had treated Beiming Hui as their new leader.</p><p>…</p><p>It was still raining while Ye Chen was drowned in his sword art training. His body was still in the air, and the sword light surrounded him. The rain seemed to be slowed down as if it were in slow motion.</p><p>On the contrary, Ye Chen’s movements seemed to be at its smoothest stage. It did not look like he was affected at all.</p><p>Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop! Pop!</p><p>Circles after circles of golden patterns spread out with Ye Chen being the center. The rain that was touched by the golden pattern turned into nothingness all of a sudden.</p><p>“He is even more powerful now!”</p><p>Mo Feng would come here almost every couple of days now. At least before he had to leave, he needed to know where Ye Chen really stood; knowing vaguely seventy or eighty percent of it would be enough of security he needed.</p><p>He was not as optimistic as Long Biyun. There would be a major battle in the palace, and during that battle, many people would die. Without a doubt, if Ye Chen could be there to help out, then the chance of them winning would be bigger. Without a king level warrior, Ye Chen would definitely be an ace card to play.</p><p>Therefore, he needed to know for sure.</p><p>It was easy to tell that Ye Chen was growing every day. Even just by the looks of the sword art he was performing right now, it was already enough to shock Mo Feng.</p><p>“How did he do it?”</p><p>Mo Feng looked at the rain in the air again before looking back at Ye Chen. Right then and there in his eyes, Ye Chen looked like he had been merged with the nature completely.</p><p>“It is not enough. Something is still missing.”</p><p>Ye Chen was still not satisfied. He could sense it that it was not complete yet. There was still a massive space to develop.</p><p>He!</p><p>The sound shook the rain into the air as Ye Chen pushed his Zhen yuan before waving out.</p><p>At that moment, something shocking happened. That circular gold pattern changed again as it became a bit stretched out. That gentle golden light spread out the across whole area, and the mountains behind the one Ye Chen was standing on was cut down, leaving the smoothest edge as if it was made by a craftsman.</p><p>“Alright! What is the name of this attack?” Mo Feng yelled.</p><p>Ye Chen shook his head, “It is still lacking, only thirty percent of the power so far. Let’s just call it Gold Fury!”</p><p>Gold Fury was just an upgraded version of Gold Pattern, and would be similar to the power with dozens of Gold Patterns mashed up together and attacking toward the enemy. But obviously, it was not still reaching the ultimate state; otherwise, it would be too drastically powerful. Even Ye Chen was not able to create something like that yet. So, this gold pattern was only one-tenth of the complete version. But, after dozens of them being combined together, its power would be a couple times more powerful than the Gold Pattern itself; moreover, it was still unfinished.</p><p>“This power is still only thirty percent?” Mo Feng gasped. This Gold Fury could already kill him a couple of times. It contained both the sharpness of gold as well as the smoothness of water.</p><p>Ye Chen chuckled. He had completely infused the learning he got from observing the raindrops, which allowed him to throw out dozens of attacks within a second. Even if he did not infuse the power, each gold pattern would contain one-thirds of the power from the full attack.</p><p>Hence, technically, he had figured out two more killing attacks in the past two months.</p><p>One of them was the ability to continue performing Gold Pattern, while the other was the Gold Fury.</p><p>If the Gold Pattern was using the profound of gold as the main source and the water profound as the secondary source, then Gold Fury would be using both as the main sources, balancing each other perfectly.</p><p>After letting out a long breath, Mo Feng said with awe, “According to what you said, once this Gold Fury of your is finished completely, it would be very close to being a high-rank profound sense martial art. And before that, your Thunder Devour would also be way more powerful than normal mid-rank profound sense martial arts. To be honest, before this, I could hardly imagine anyone at the age of 26 could create so many powerful martial arts of such level.”</p><p>“It would be hard to get to high-rank profound sense martial arts, to be honest.” Ye Chen would not dare to believe that the Gold Fury he had created could ever become a top rank profound sense martial arts. Even the simplest high-rank ones would need two minor profounds to be combined together, and his profound of gold and water had not reached there yet. But of course, the gold one was already getting there.</p><p>Mo Feng said, “You are on the right path. It would be hard to train the profound to completion already, and combining two of them would be even harder. You are already on this path, so you will definitely make it one day.”</p><p>Reaching completion would not be enough yet, as he would have to combine them perfectly as well to be able to reach the level of high rank profound martial arts. But, it would be extremely hard. Ye Chen’s Gold Fury had successively fused the two already quite well; all he needed to do now was to elevate both of them to completion. Then, it would be more or less approaching the high-rank profound sense martial arts, and he would just have to completely fuse them to form a real one.</p><p>High rank would be ten times more powerful than a mid-rank profound sense martial art. There would be a great canyon worth of gap between the two levels. Therefore, only Life and Death Realm king level warriors could create such powerful martial arts.</p><p>…</p><p>Time flew back, and within a blink of an eye, the rainy season inside the Windy Nation had passed.</p><p>Ye Chen had also stopped his training. It was not that he did not want to continue perfecting his Gold Fury, but he did not have the power to do so yet. If he wanted to improve, there would only be two paths before him: ameliorating the fusion of the two, or improving the profound sense. Both of them could not be achieved within a short period of time.</p><p>Hence, Ye Chen temporarily put down the training of his Gold Fury and continued to train the Thunder Devour. Of course, it was not that he had given up on training his thunder devour; it was just him increasing the time he would spend on it.</p><p>His thunder profound had reached semi completion already, but his thunder devour had not. There were still quite a few flaws in it. If he could complete it, its power would be at least a couple times higher than normal mid-rank profound sense martial arts. That explosive power would be extremely majestic.</p><p>Ting!</p><p>After waving out a sword attack, the silver lighting followed his sword and flowed quickly. As it reached the tip of the sword, the silver lightning clashed together before eventually accumulating into a silver thunder ball with small cracks. It shot out at a high speed, being pushed by his Zhen yuan.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A tall mountain far away from where he was standing was first shattered by that aggressive thunder attack before being turned into nothingness by the explosive power of the thunder ball, leaving a massive dent in the ground as if it was hit by a falling star.</p><p>“No matter how you try to compress it, the silver lightning will not form into a perfect ball. It should not be a problem of the technique, and might be due to lack of the thunder profound.”</p><p>Ye Chen knew it very clearly that his techniques would be almost flawless; otherwise, he would not have been able to create profound sense martial arts, since it would be the foundation of every profound. Of course, at his level, if his techniques reached a certain level, he indeed would be able to force his Thunder Devour to reach completion without perfecting his profound.</p><p>But, if his techniques were really at that level already, he would have a not-so-great profound sense. So, regardless if it was techniques or profound, it would all need the warriors to control it. High-quality techniques meant that the warrior had a very high comprehensive ability, and would have to be great in terms of the profound as well to fully perfect his or her understanding.</p><p>…</p><p>At the end of August, Ye Chen finally completed his thunder devour, and his thunder profound also reached completion, reaching the next level.</p><p>Right now, as he performed his thunder devour attack, he was be able to control his power perfectly, and at a way much faster speed. Once it landed on opponents, the latter would be devoured by a mad thunder before being killed by the explosive power.</p><p>“It is almost September!”</p><p>On the peak of the mountain, Ye Chen slowly let out a breath. On the eighteenth of September would be the day he battled with Du Gujue, but his opponent might not just be him. He had already heard about the news of Beiming Hui beating Lin Chaonan. And according to the news, he had already created a martial art that was even more powerful than that Sky Bank Attack of his from before.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
