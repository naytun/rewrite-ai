The Blood Emperor Attack was a spell to activate the energy within the blood, which would represent the power of blood itself. It would have something to do with the element of water as well, which would naturally be canceled out a bit when facing fire or thunder element. Therefore, although the thunder attack of Ye Chen’s was not as powerful as his Gold Pattern and Spiritual Sword attack, it might still have a bigger effect due to the thunder element.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>An intense explosion was heard and a circle of white smoke spread out, making a sizzling sound somehow on the walls as if boiling water had been poured onto the ground.</p><p>It was a kind of gas that was similar to steam.</p><p>In the center of the explosion, the bloody finger power broke through as if it were unstoppable. That silver thunder ball had taken out part of the finger power, but it was still shattered completely eventually.</p><p>”The gap might be a bit too big. Even if the thunder element could effectively cancel out the water element, it would still be shattered eventually if the gap was too much.”</p><p>Ye Chen was not that surprised about what had just happened, since he had never expected to take on the Blood Emperor Finger Attack with his Thunder Devour. If he managed to block it, then that would be a surprise. Therefore, all he wanted to achieve was to block out some of the power for now. With the Thunder Devour, the remaining finger power would never have broken through his defense layer.</p><p>Indeed, that dimmed down blood finger power landed onto his protective Zhen yuan heavily after breaking through the thunder ball. However, after breaking through the protective layer, it was dimmed down again. It eventually landed onto his new shield and was easily blocked, having lost most of his power.</p><p>”No! I cannot use my blood emperor finger attack anymore!”</p><p>Xia Houzun looked pale right now, it was his second time using this blood spell, which had cost him two-fifth of his blood. Even if he were a powerful Sea of Souls Realm warrior, losing two-fifths of his blood was not something that would be easy to manage. His body had never been this tired, and his mind was wandering a bit. It was a sign that he was losing way too much blood. If it were not for the fact that he had just taken a blood emperor spirit pellet not that long ago and nourished his condition, he would have lost all of his battling power right now.</p><p>”Void Shattering Finger!”</p><p>Giving up completely on his defense, the second Xia Houzun clashed with Ye Chen, he threw out another Void Shattering Finger at the latter’s protective Zhen yuan.</p><p>”Gold Pattern!”</p><p>Ye Chen had let go of his defense as well and the gold pattern spread out from the tip of his sword, continuing to attack that blood energy shield.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Ye Chen puked out a chunk of blood, and the shield that Xia Houzun was wearing started to twist and crack.</p><p>”Spiritual Sword Attack! Three attacks!”</p><p>It was right then that Ye Chen took one step forward and waved out his thunder disaster sword before twisting his wrist and waving it out again, and then stabbing it out eventually. Those three attacks had been sent out in an extremely smooth manner. Although they were not as fast as the Spiritual Sword but, they were not that slow either. Xia Houzun had no time to react at all before he was hit by all three of them.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Finally, the blood energy shield had been cracked open. Tiny strings of sword qi managed to find a way in, damaging Xia Houzun’s physical body.</p><p>”Let’s go!”</p><p>Xia Houzun could not handle it anymore. Each time, Ye Chen seemed to be wounded way more severely, but the latter was somehow still completely fine. Although he had no idea what was really happening to Ye Chen, he had no intention in using his body to figure it out anymore. The energy from his blood spell had its limitations; once the pellet’s effect ran out, it would be impossible for him to leave even if he wanted to.</p><p>With the power of that cut attack, his body twisted around in the air, turning into a beam of bloody light and shooting out for the exit. Meanwhile, he shouted back, ”Ye Chen, until next time! I will then repay you twice for what you’ve done today.”</p><p>Losing from Ye Chen was a huge embarrassment for him. Right now, the wound on his physical body did not matter anymore; the torture on his mind and spirit was the heavy hit. He could not imagine what would happen when the others found out that he had lost to Ye Chen. He seemed to have already seen countless people laughing at him, making jokes about him and saying that he was not worthy for the top five young warrior title.</p><p>”Ye Chen!”</p><p>His lip had been bitten through and blood dripped down as he was filled with shame and anger. Although he was highly frustrated, but he still increased his escaping speed. He knew that as long as he was still alive, there would be chance for him to redeem himself in the future.</p><p>”He is so fast!”</p><p>Five beams of sword light appeared outside Ye Chen’s body as he followed right behind him. He had thought about releasing his dream eating wolf; but after giving it some thoughts, he decided to keep it in. In a one-on-one battle between martial geniuses, there would be no point in using his wolf, since it would make the win meaningless as well. Plus, the ability of the wolf to create dreams was not unbeatable. It might work on warriors like Lin Tian, but it would already be challenging in front of warriors such as Beijing Hui. As for the top five young warriors, it would only give himself a slight upper-hand, and that would be it.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>A beam of Void Shattering Finger Art shot over and Ye Chen waved the sword to welcome the attack. However, his body could not help but be blown backward, dragging the distance between them two farther.</p><p>Without continuing to chase him, Ye Chen put back his sword.</p><p>”He probably only has one of those pellets. This time, I have burned out one last attack of his, so it should be enough for now. But, this blood spell is indeed powerful. It had not only recovered all of his wounds, it even formed a tough blood energy shield outside his body!”</p><p>Ye Chen knew very well about his Spiritual Sword Attack. The normal three attacks in a row could only tear apart a slight crack on that shield, which could already prove Xia Houzun’s power already. It was definitely stronger than a semi extreme rank defensive item.</p><p>Taking a deep look at where Xia Houzun disappeared, Ye Chen went back from where he came from.</p><p>…</p><p>A couple thousand meters away but still inside the tunnels, Xia Houzun stopped his body, looking extra pale.</p><p>Whoo! Whoo!…</p><p>He was breathing heavily, and felt like he was about to faint. That last three attacks in a row had not wounded him at all, as ninety percent of the power had been absorbed by the shield. Moreover, the wound from before had been cured completely as well by the pellet. The only problem was that the loss of his blood would not be replaced in a short period of time. He could only rely on his own body to create more blood.</p><p>”Damn! I cannot believe that I lost to him!”</p><p>Xia Houzun could still not believe that he had lost it to Ye Chen, which was what affected him the most.</p><p>”No! There are only seven months left before the next master level ranking. I will have to think of a way to increase my power during this period of time. Otherwise…’</p><p>Xia Houzun was planning to say that his top five young warrior’s title might be replaced. Once the title was stolen from him, he imagined that he would become the joke of everyone and Ye Chen’s stepping stone, which was something that he would never allow to happen.</p><p>”Seven months…It should be more than enough!”</p><p>Xia Houzun desperately wanted to increase his power. Before, the title of being the top five young warriors had made him relax a bit. And right now, he was regretting it greatly.</p><p>Within these seven months, he knew that he had to get his hands on a semi extreme rank defensive item, especially since he only had one blood emperor pellet. Besides that, he would need to improve his cultivation to a new level, as well as his profound sense martial arts and Void Shattering Finger Art.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
