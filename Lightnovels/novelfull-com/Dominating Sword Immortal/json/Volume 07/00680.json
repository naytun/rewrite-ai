By now, two mid rank storage rings and ten low rank storage rings had been filled up completely.</p><p>The resources obtained from the mid rank spirit fountain were not all mid rank soul stones. In fact, there were way more low rank spirit stones than mid rank ones. Meanwhile, the mid rank spirit stones had only taken up ten percent of the whole gains. There were not many top rank spirit stones, but it was still a rather big quantity.</p><p>This kind of haul was only possible from such peak mid rank fountains, which was equivalent to that found from a couple of months of extraction of normal fountains. At the same time, since nine hundred out of the one thousand spirit fountains within the area were low rank, the gains were rather reasonable. Dozens of low rank spirit fountains might still not be equal to a top or mid rank spirit fountain.</p><p>Putting away all of the spirit stones, Ye Chen did not wait for another second before leaving the island and flying toward the Five Gold Island with his people. During the trip, he flipped his eyebrows and slowed down the speed.</p><p>“Deputy palace leader Ye, what is going on?” Yan Kuan asked.</p><p>Ye Chen lifted up his arms and pointed towards his right as he said, “Let’s go this way.”</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>Everyone exchanged looks, not knowing what was going on.</p><p>Yao Yifeng had a complicated look on his face as he said with a high voice, “Deputy leader, our job right now is to regroup with second palace leader Xu. What do you think you are doing?”</p><p>Ye Chen looked at him right in the eyes with a sharp look, “Am I the deputy palace leader or you? Right now, what you need to do is follow your orders.”</p><p>Yao Yifeng said forcibly, “Right now is the most critical moment for the palace. We cannot be exposed to unnecessary danger just because of your own ideas. Please think again!”</p><p>“Deputy palace leader Ye, executive Yao has it right. Right now, I think it is best for us to reunite with the others. The longer we are separated, the more dangerous it would be.”</p><p>“Deputy leader, you can give us a reason after all, right?”</p><p>There were too many people who did not know what was happening. Some of the warriors came out to support Yao Yifeng, since fighting against the deputy palace leader would still be slightly better than losing their lives without knowing why. In addition, they frankly were not that trusting of Ye Chen, since not everyone could have the power to lead.</p><p>Ye Chen squinted at Yao Yifeng for a long while before eventually saying, “If we go straight, we would be ambushed. By going right, we can beat them before them seeing us. Is this reason good enough for you?”</p><p>“Ambush?” Everyone was shocked.</p><p>Hearing him, Yao Yifeng looked a bit panicked as he forced a laugh, “Deputy leader, how could you know that there is ambush? Everyone is at Sea of Souls Realm, and even the soul power is the same. How come that I felt nothing and you have sensed this much? Perhaps you have thought too much?”</p><p>Right then, even Xing Meilian was looking at Ye Chen strangely, because she could also not sense anything even under the ocean either. There was nothing around. Plus, if Ye Chen had sensed enemies, then the enemies should be aware of it as well, since everyone was at the Sea of Souls Realm, and was equally sensitive to soul power.</p><p>Ye Chen said lightly, “You do not need to know about that. In addition, this is my first time explaining my reasoning to everyone, and it will be the last. Whoever does not listen in the future will be dealt according to the palace rules. Right now, everyone will follow my lead. If not, then I will deal with him or her right here.”</p><p>Changing their route, he started to move toward the right. Xing Meilian, Chen Yuxin, and the group hesitated a little before following right behind him. After that, most of the people followed up as well, leaving only Yao Yifeng and his close warriors.</p><p>“Let’s go!” Yao Yifeng said in a deep voice. Although he dared to voice his opinion, he would not dare to fight obviously against Ye Chen. He was certain that the second he decided to do so, Ye Chen would just get it.</p><p>Although everyone was still following behind, they kept chatting with each other.</p><p>“What is he doing not allowing us to reunite with second palace leader Xu? He says that there is an ambush ahead. I don’t believe that he can foresee that.”</p><p>“He is the leader here after all, so we should just listen to his orders. Perhaps, he has his own concerns.” Xing Meilian was trying to help Ye Chen.</p><p>“Yeah, I also believe in brother Ye. He would not have done this for no reason.” Chen Yuxin also decided to stand by Ye Chen’s side.</p><p>…</p><p>On the sides of Ye Chen’s original path, six groups of warriors were waiting there, hiding a thousand miles apart and almost forming an “x” shape. Reaching in the middle, one’s soul power would sense all of these people. However, by then, it would already be too late to back out. Once they saw them coming, they would send out a signal and surround them.</p><p>But, Ye Chen decided to choose the right side where he could go against the enemies. Although there were a lot of them there, they had been separated into six batches. So, their force was not as powerful as it might be at the center.</p><p>As for exactly how Ye Chen found out about it, it was because his soul power was five times more powerful than anyone. He could scan a radius all the way up to five hundred miles. The quality of the vision was more powerful than the Sea of Souls Realm as well. His soul power was equivalent to a king warrior’s soul power, which would sense other people’s power while they had no idea.</p><p>This was Ye Chen’s advantage.</p><p>On the closest island to Ye Chen and the group, two hundred people here hidden on a mountain. These people had a swirl pattern sewed on their clothes: they were obviously people from the Water Wave School.</p><p>“This time, our school has sent around six hundred people out, while the Sky Eagle Cult sent out seven hundred warriors. That’s around one thousand and three hundred of them out here. It will be so easy to kill all three hundred of them. The people from the Black King School and the Speed Wind School will kill the other three hundred. Hahaha! Killing all seven hundred people in one go…The Azure Dragon Palace will lose about half of their power already.”</p><p>“Added with that last time, the Azure Dragon Palace would have already lost one thousand men within a couple of months. They must be so scared right now.”</p><p>“All they can blame would be themselves. They always seem to be one step slower.”</p><p>“Yeah, I will have to say. The average battling power of the palace would be way higher than us. With the same number of warriors battling together, it would be us losing for sure.”</p><p>“Haha, let’s not talk about this. Let’s drink so that we can kill more smoothly later!”</p><p>“Cheers!”</p><p>Inside the mountain, the smell of alcohol was everywhere.</p><p>…</p><p>A hundred miles away from the island, Ye Chen suddenly stopped the groups. He turned around his head and said creepily, “Later on, follow my order. Once I give out the signal, everyone push to full speed. Warriors with Seas of Souls Realm will start to attack that biggest island from thirty miles away, attacking while increasing to max speed. Astral Reaching Realm warriors, follow behind us and wait for my further instructions.”</p><p>A hundred miles of distance was reachable within seven or eight breaths worth of time for normal Sea of Souls Realm warriors. As for Astral Reaching Realm warriors, they might need twenty to thirty breaths. Meanwhile, Ye Chen would only need two to three. If he performed his Defensive Sword Spell, then it would be even faster. However, with only him, the effect would not be drastic, and he would need to attack with the other Seas of Souls Realm warriors to achieve maximum impact. As for Astral Reaching Realm warriors, they would not be useful in this situation, since they were simply too slow.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Ye Chen yelled: “Full speed!”</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>With that, Ye Chen flew out first.</p><p>“Let’s go!” Including Lin Canghai, Chen Yuxin and Luo Yunsong, the forty-three Seas of Souls Realm warriors followed right behind him. The three hundred Astral Reaching Realm warriors were slower, and the gap between was increasing as well.</p><p>One hundred miles!</p><p>Eighty miles!</p><p>Sixty miles!</p><p>Fifty miles!</p><p>Inside the mountain on the island, a Sea of Souls Realm warrior let out his soul power unconsciously. It happened quite quickly, and he had recalled it immediately afterward. ‘Eh?’ He frowned as he let out his soul power again.</p><p>Out of the blue, his expression changed drastically.</p><p>“Incoming! Incoming! Get out of the mountain…!”</p><p>Before he was able to finish his sentence, a massive black thunder ball landed on the mountain. Right after that, sword qi, blade qi, palm power, fist power, Zhen yuan attacks,… everything seemed to be targeted at the mountain. Time itself seemed to freeze on the mountain, and the air turned sticky like water.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Ye Chen let out his black thunder ball which had kicked off the whole attack. That aggressive black lightning shot out everywhere like countless black flood dragons playing in the air. The weather changed and that sword qi blade cut open everything in front of him. At the same time, the palm power and the fist power had almost shattered the whole island.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Cries were heard everywhere as countless people were killed in that sudden attack. Even the most powerful Seas of Souls Realm warriors could not react on time.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>Xing Meilian and the others were shocked. They had followed Ye Chen’s order and did not let out their soul power. Ye Chen specifically warned them that whoever let out their soul power would be killed on the spot. It was only until the whole mountain was completely shattered and all of the people within had been burned into ashes that they realized how many enemies were present out there.</p><p>‘How could he have known?’ It was the question on everyone’s mind.</p><p>“Leave not a single one of them behind.” Ye Chen looked cold. He knew that if he let even one of them go, he could not attack the other groups in the same way, which would be the end of his fightback plan. These four parties had killed so many warriors from the Dragon God Palace; so this time, it would be them tasting their own medicine. He wanted to show them pain, and the worst kind at that.</p><p>“Attack!”</p><p>Xing Meilian was very impressed by Ye Chen, and made up her mind about the future where she would follow whatever he said without a doubt.</p><p>Amongst everyone, Lin Canghai was the one working the hardest, since he had made a bet with Ye Chen before about competing in who killed the most.</p><p>As a master level sword artist, Lin Canghai was as powerful as many other warriors combined. That dense sword qi covered the whole area, and a huge area in the middle of the island was covered by his sword attack. Unfortunately, Ye Chen’s one thunder ball attack had already killed so many people.</p><p>The whole island was in chaos, and there were less than ten warriors left; they were all rather high level Sea of Souls Realm warriors. As for the other ones, they were all killed, every single one of them.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The seven or eight remaining warriors scattered, trying to escape with everything they had.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>A beam of black sword qi was shot out, and two enemies that were not that far were devoured whole. It was an attack from Ye Chen.</p><p>Although the other few people were running as well, there were too many attacks to face. Being in that aggressive fire net, no one could escape. Each one of them had been shattered into nothingness.</p><p>The first surprise attack was successful.</p><p>With only Ye Chen and the other forty-something warriors, they had managed to kill two hundred enemies.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
