Regardless of how one looked at him, Ye Chen only seemed around twenty years old, and his true age could be no higher than twenty-six or twenty-seven years. Such a young deputy caught everybody off-guard.</p><p>“What game are the higher-ups playing, sending a kid? Cultivation base is alright, but not at the deputy level!”</p><p>“If a kid is allowed to lead us, I’m afraid we’ll only die quicker. Even if I were to offend him, I’d have to understand him.”</p><p>“Let’s see how it goes. Perhaps it’s just a misunderstanding?”</p><p>Numerous Zhen Yuan discussions broke out.</p><p>Yao Yifeng sneered, waiting for Ye Chen to turn into a joke. This was not the headquarters, and everybody was focused on survival. If he couldn’t display sufficient strength, his position as deputy wouldn’t be steady even though he was sent by the higher-ups.</p><p>Strong winds loudly whistled in the vast training grounds. Ye Chen stopped thirty steps away from them. Chen Yuxin and the rest voluntarily went to stand beside them, forming a second group.</p><p>Faintly raising his head, Ye Chen swept his gaze. It didn’t linger on Yao Yifeng at all, moving past in a natural manner.</p><p>This troop was quite good. Not including Chen Yuxin and the rest, forty Sea of Soul realm experts among which four at the late Sea of Soul realm, fifteen at mid Sea of Soul realm, and twenty one at the early Sea of Soul realm—such a force was already above peak sixth grade sects. This troop could sweep through any sixth grade sect at will.</p><p>“I’m called Ye Chen, the newly appointed deputy. I believe you have a lot to say…You can spit it out right now and I won’t look into it! If you don’t speak now and create trouble later, don’t blame me for not showing mercy.”</p><p>Ye Chen knew that his prestige was not enough, and these people surely wouldn’t accept him. Therefore, he needed to take care of this problem once and for all to prevent future mishaps. With his strength, if he couldn’t even take care of this problem, he might as well pack and head home.”</p><p>Everybody exchanged glances, not expecting Ye Chen to be so blunt. The beautiful woman cleared her throat and spoke, “Deputy Ye, my humble self is Xing Meilian. I have a question. What is your age?”</p><p>“Twenty six…” Ye Chen replied.</p><p>Young!</p><p>Although they didn’t approve of Ye Chen as deputy, but his talent was enough to amaze them. After all, a twenty-six year old individual with a peak mid Sea of Soul realm cultivation base was unprecedented in the Eastern Shallow Ocean. It was no wonder that the higher-ups sent him. Unfortunately, they were blood-soaked characters who lived on the blade’s edge all year round. Only if something could make them live longer would it be worthy for their consideration, and astonishing talent was obviously not included.</p><p>“Forgive my words, but you’re too young and might not be able to lead us to success.”</p><p>Ye Chen, in the end, was a deputy, and one who had been sent by the higher-ups. Therefore, their words were toned down and as polite as possible. They didn’t directly question his strength, and rather pointed out his leading ability.</p><p>Ye Chen’s lips slightly curled upward, “Then forgive my words too, but only a mediocre person would lack confidence due to their age. I never lacked confidence.”</p><p>“Only confidence is not enough.” Xing Meilian followed up.</p><p>Ye Chen shook his head, “My apologies! Currently, I can’t give you a satisfactory answer, because leadership can only be shown on the battlefield. You can raise your real concerns now, or you won’t have the opportunity later on.”</p><p>“Senior Brother Ye will be Senior Brother Ye. His words are watertight, without any loopholes.”</p><p>Among the acquaintances of Chen Yuxin within the same generation, there was nobody comparable to Ye Chen. He didn’t need to rely on his aura or status to suppress; instead, he relied on a cool head and foolproof words.</p><p>“Is this kid really twenty-six years old?” Xing Meilian looked at Ye Chen with a strange gaze. She had no choice but to admit that Ye Chen was gradually seizing the authority. However, it was not enough. If he didn’t have sufficient strength, everything else would be meaningless.</p><p>The sturdy man beside her couldn’t endure anymore and said, “To become a deputy, apart from leadership, one must have sufficient strength. I hope you are aware of this point.”</p><p>Ye Chen asked him back, “Then how much strength you think is up to the standard?”</p><p>“That…” The man was momentarily stumped before he continued, “The former deputy Hu could defeat me in three moves, and now he is dead. You must defeat me in two moves.”</p><p>He was not deliberately making things difficult for Ye Chen. Originally, he and deputy Hu merely exchanged blows and didn’t go all out. Otherwise, the latter could defeat him in merely two moves. For him to propose two moves, he had already lowered the difficulty for Ye Chen by a lot.”</p><p>“Sure, you can make a move first!”</p><p>Ye Chen had been prepared from the very beginning. Regardless of their words, their sole concern was that his strength was not sufficient. These were the words they truly wished to speak.</p><p>“Be careful!”</p><p>The study’s main weapon was a huge axe. He slowly walked out of the formation and stopped twenty steps away from Ye Chen. With a low shout, his figure charged at Ye Chen, seeming like a small mountain. The violent gales produced could have razed a large expanse of buildings to the ground. When he arrived near Ye Chen, he raised the axe high chopped down. The yellow-colored axe light turned into an arc due to its high speed.</p><p>Shaking his finger, Ye Chen pointed his finger.</p><p>“Arrogant!”</p><p>“Too conceited!”</p><p>Everybody’s brows creased one after another upon witnessing Ye Chen intending to fight with his finger. Yao Yifeng further revealed a cold smile. This man was called Jiang Hanliang. Although the latter was weaker than him, the difference was not much. Adding on his huge axe, his offensive power was enormous. If experts of the same rank were to directly clash with his axe head-on, they might not be able to fight on equal footing, much less to speak of a finger.</p><p>Only Chen Yuxin remained calm, for she had already seen Ye Chen defeating Li Feng with a finger.</p><p>Jiang Hanliang was clearly even more furious. Wails of ghosts and howls of wolves followed the axe chopping down while the axe’s surroundings turned distorted.</p><p>“Be defeated!”</p><p>The axe arrived before Ye Chen.</p><p>Crunch!</p><p>Ye Chen’s finger and axe light met resolutely. Astonishingly, the seemingly invincible axe light immediately crumbled and dispersed, following which, Ye Chen’s fingertip touched the axe’s blade, and it began to rapidly warp in, giving off loud metal-screeching sounds that could make one grind their teeth.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Eventually, Jiang Hanliang could no longer hold the axe and his grip loosened. The huge axe flew out, smashing a huge hole into the ground upon landing, with dust and soil splattering everywhere. Jiang Hanliang himself was a step slower than the axe as he shot back with a trail of blood at the corner of his mouth, smashing into the crowd.</p><p>“Are you satisfied with my strength?”</p><p>Due to insufficient prestige, Ye Chen had to give them a proper beating, lest someone came for trouble later.</p><p>“I’m surnamed Yan! Please advise me!”</p><p>The middle-aged scholar standing to the right of the beautiful woman walked out.</p><p>Ye Chen’s strength had already been established to be no lower than Deputy Hu. However, that was not enough, since even the former was killed under a combined assault of the four forces. If his strength were more or less the same as Deputy Hu, it didn’t have any significance.</p><p>“My specialty is speed and light techniques.” The scholar warned Ye Chen, who nodded faintly.</p><p>“Be careful…Hundred Wind Transformations!”</p><p>The scholar specialized in the Wind Profound, and had already merged his body arts into the wind profound. His entire being disappeared, only leaving behind an incorporeal gale. The gale was present everywhere, assaulting Ye Chen from every direction while giving off an impression as if a hundred phantoms were attacking the latter.</p><p>‘He certainly won’t have any means to settle this in a few moves this time.’ Yao Yifeng thought to himself.</p><p>The scholar was called Yan Kuan. To gain an advantage over him by solely relying on light body arts was extremely hard, and even the Azure Dragon Hall Leader might not be able to do so. It should be known that light body arts were the most challenging among all the martial arts to integrate into the profound, not to mention the degree which Yan Kuang had reached.</p><p>Ye Chen smiled indifferently; he didn’t have to be quicker than the latter. Of course, if they were to compare speed, he could throw the latter behind by five streets. However, it won’t be enough to satisfy everybody. Therefore, he only needed to compare insight and precision. With a quick glance, he raised the two index fingers of his right hand and waved diagonally.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Yan Kuang, as if struck by the air, appeared flying backward with blood at the corner of his mouth. His clothes at his chest were completely destroyed, revealing his inner armor.</p><p>Yan Kuang’s Light Body Arts were broken with one move!</p><p>It seemed effortless!</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>Xing Meilian sucked in a breath of cold air. Yan Kuang’s light body arts were exceptionally powerful. She was clear that there might be someone in the Azure Dragon Hall at par with him, but there was absolutely no one who was able to surpass him. However, even he couldn’t take a single move from Ye Chen. What kind of situation was this?</p><p>“I’m fully convinced!”</p><p>Yan Kuang stumblingly fell on the ground and then said sincerely.</p><p>“Good! Is there anyone else left unconvinced?” Ye Chen swept his gaze.</p><p>“Hehe, I’m convinced.”</p><p>After being astonished momentarily, Xing Meilian revealed an alluring smile. This was the first time she had come across such an outstanding young man. The latter was merely twenty-six years old, and thus, his future would certainly be glorious. If she could connect with him, even if she might not have a meteoric rise, she would certainly gain a lot of consideration. What was their reason to join the Azure Dragon Hall? Was it not to gain merits and obtain more resources? Although she could certainly obtain resources on her own, it wouldn’t be much, and might not necessarily be the amount she needed. As a peak fifth grade sect, Dragon God Celestial Palace’s resources were beyond a normal person’s imagination. Whether she could take one step further or not would depend on this. Not to mention, even if she didn’t do it for herself, she had to think of her family. Under the vast influence resided thousands of families and clans, including theirs.</p><p>‘Damn it! How can this guy be so powerful!’ Yao Yifeng tightly clenched his fists. For the first time, he had felt that this matter had exceeded his control. His fists unclenched slowly and a cold light flickered in his eyes, ‘Since it has come to this, don’t blame me. Deputy Hu is waiting for you underneath.’</p><p>“SInce nobody has spoken, I’ll consider that there is no problem. But, let me state clearly beforehand…everyone must obey my orders. If not, don’t blame me for being inconsiderate.” Ye Chen raised his brows, and his bearing changed into that of a treasured sword unsheathing. An aura of destruction spread out, making everybody feel like it was the end of the world as a numbness rose from within.</p><p>“His strength is even beyond what he showed!” Xing Meilian held her breath, realizing that she was still underestimating Ye Chen.</p><p>“Alright then! Who is willing to help me understand the situation around?” Restraining his aura, Ye Chen asked.</p><p>Xing Meilian hesitated for a moment before saying, “I will!”</p><p>Ye Chen faintly nodded, “The others are dismissed.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
