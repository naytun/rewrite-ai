It would be impossible to even move around. In facing this blade attack, there seemed to be only one way, which would be to face it head-on.</p><p>It would be impossible for Ye Chen not to get surprised. But, his face went back to his normal calmness soon afterward.</p><p>Normally, he was not planning to use his most powerful attack, the Gold Fury. But, since it was not really a life and death battle, it would not be wise to perform it in front of this many people. After all, with one extra attack left hidden, it’d be more likely for him to survive a tough situation in the future.</p><p>But right now, he had no other choice.</p><p>“Gold Fury!”</p><p>Facing that horrifying blade pressure, Ye Chen lowered his body weight and lifted both of his hands with the sword before waving it down heavily.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The gold pattern twisted and dragged as if there was a boat driven through it. In front of his Gold Pattern was a perfect circle as if it were drawn with a compass. Following the gap, it sliced through the grey light column.</p><p>That hundred-meters-thick, thousand-meters-long grey-white light column had been sliced open immediately. The power disappeared, breaking into two halves and filling up the whole sky. In the middle of the sky was a hint of gold; it was indeed this hint of gold that had sliced the grey-white light into halves.</p><p>After the grey light disappeared completely, everyone opened their eyes and looked at the location of the battle.</p><p>Over on the Nine Dragon Lake, a light mark was disappearing; following the mark, everyone found Du Gujue. Right then, he was looking rather horrible. His body had crashed into the lake, leaving a massive hole at the bottom. He was covered in mud and his hair were wet. His shield had a massive dent on his chest, with the light dimmed down.</p><p>Seeing Du Gujue like this, everyone could not help but gasp. No one had thought that Du Gujue, who was about to flip over the whole situation and even win this, would be in such a state. After all, that last attack let everyone here feel that hint of despair.</p><p>They all thought Du Gujue was going to win regardless. But somehow, they were wrong again.</p><p>Wahh!</p><p>Du Gujue puked out a mouthful of blood, having no power to stand up.</p><p>He tried his best to lift up his eyes and look into the sky. In his vision, Ye Chen in his blue robes was standing in the air, the longsword placed back into his scabbard while his black hair danced in the air.</p><p>Compared to Du Gujue, Ye Chen was totally unscratched. People could not even spot his clothes having gotten damaged. In other words, Ye Chen had beaten Du Gujue completely during this battle without a doubt. Even when Du Gujue lost completely, Ye Chen was not really threatened the whole time.</p><p>“So horrifying! Someone powerful like Du Gujue could still not fight back in front of Ye Chen.”</p><p>“Du Gujue could absorb the power of despair. However, Ye Chen has reached even beyond that.”</p><p>Everyone was discussing. Although they could not see every detail, they could tell the basics. No matter in what areas, Du Gujue was all slightly weaker than Ye Chen. Ye Chen was not lacking in experience or techniques. Each time Du Gujue used his blade intent to increase his battling power, Ye Chen was able to shatter that with one sword attack and hit it at the weakest spot.</p><p>A lot of people thought to themselves that Du Gujue running into Ye Chen itself was a tragedy. If it were another powerful warrior with similar power as Ye Chen, Du Gujue might have had a winning chance. But in front of Ye Chen, he had no chance whatsoever.</p><p>“This is Ye Chen?”</p><p>Li Daoxuan and the other two had not seen Ye Chen for about two years. So, they all thought that he would be powerful; but, they had not thought that he was THAT powerful, since they had already been shocked plenty of times before. But now, they somehow were even more shocked.</p><p>If this were years ago, they might be able to still say that they might catch up with him one day. But now, it is just impossible. All they could see was not even his back, but only the tracks left behind by his success.</p><p>“Extreme power can basically ignore everything.” Bai Wuxue glanced at Du Gujue as he mumbled to himself.</p><p>Being able to make Bai Wuxue say this was indeed not something simple. The other person that had made him say that it was extreme power was only the Surreal King, since he was the No.1 warrior of the world. In Bai Wuxue’s eyes, the extreme power was the highest standard to measure someone’s power. Normal people would only have cultivation, profound, and martial intents. The rest would be mental endurance, battling talent, and the experience.</p><p>Only with extreme power in all areas could one be regarded as truly unsurpassable.</p><p>If there were a wooden bottle, water could be filled to one hundred percent only if no parts were missing. But, if there were something missing, then water could never be filled in it completely.</p><p>Bai wuxue knew it very clearly that being the head of the top five young warriors did not take much high potential or comprehensive ability, since the others were not much worse either. But in front of extreme power, he would have to be way much more powerful than the others. Even if it were Du Gujue, he could still see some flaws. But with Ye Chen in the picture, it was his first time knowing that his power would only be way much higher than his own.</p><p>Of course, everyone would have to move upwards. Although his power was not that much weaker than Ye Chen’s, but judging on potential, he had already been reaching the end. The possibility of him reaching the Life and Death Realm was not that high anymore. On the contrary, even Du Gujue would be very likely entering the Life and Death Realm, which was the difference between potentials.</p><p>Within the same realm, it would be the extreme power that everyone was competing about. But over a lifetime, it would be the potentials that everyone was counting on.</p><p>Higher the potential, the faster one could increase his or her power.</p><p>“This is so embarrassing…Let’s go!” Xu Yuan looked rather awkward.</p><p>Before, his talking tone to Xie Baiting was not that loud, but he was not really hiding it either. Right now, Ye Chen had won the battle so easily; even if he did not really care for it, he could still feel his face burning a bit.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>The two seniors left the mountains first.</p><p>Xu Yuan and Xie Baiting’s departure did not attract much attention, since everyone was still focusing on Du Gujue and Ye Chen.</p><p>Popping a pellet on his mountain and extracting some part of the medicine, Du Gujue was able to finally stand up with all of his strength.</p><p>“Ye Chen, in my whole life, I have never lost to anyone in our generation yet. You are the first person who managed to do so.” Du Gujue took a deep breath and said slowly.</p><p>Hearing him, people were shocked again.</p><p>Before, due to the fact that they were too excited, they did not think much about it. But after being reminded by Du Gujue, everyone started to remember his past. He had been this top martial genius his whole life, never facing a loss. The only couple times where he broke even with his opponents would be with opponents at his level, such as Dantai Mingyue.</p><p>Yet now, e Chen had broken his all-win record. Most importantly, the two of them were both top martial geniuses, which meant they were each other’s stepping stone. With one of them falling down would the other step up.</p><p>The winner of the first battle was Ye Chen.</p><p>In the sky, Ye Chen said. “I have never met any rightful enemies within our generation either.”</p><p>A simple line like that had shocked people again. They did not know if Ye Chen was doing it on purpose or not since this line included Du Gujue as well. In another sense, it meant that Ye Chen had never had a loss, even if his opponent was Du Gujue.</p><p>On that small hill, Li Daoxuan sighed, “He indeed did not lose ever. Perhaps it was more luck before, but now, it is definitely a fact. No one in the young generation could beat him.”</p><p>When Ye Chen was still at the Condensing Reality Realm or Clasping Yuan Realm and had arrived in the Sky Martial Region, he would most likely have lost. But, as he got stronger and stronger, the luck part had been slowly replaced by his power.</p><p>“I have still lost after all.”</p><p>Du Gujue looked rather sad. It was his first time facing a failure, and it would be impossible for him not to have any negative emotions. But this time, this failure seemed to have unlocked some blockages, as he felt more motivated. Before, he fought to not lose, but right now, he would fight to beat Ye Chen. The former and the latter were both for himself, but the meaning behind was completely different.</p><p>“Everyone will face failures. You just wait for me at where you are standing.” Standing straight, Du Gujue seemed to already grown stronger.</p><p>“Great! A Du Gujue and a Ye Chen.” The pavilion leader Gao Changtian laughed. The annual master level ranking would officially be changed next month and Gao Zhangtian was in charge of the young generation.</p><p>“Du Gujue…Although you lost to Ye Chen, but according to the current data, you are qualified to enter the top five…maybe even higher up.”</p><p>Gao Changtian said.</p><p>“Hm? Du Gujue entering the top five…Does it mean that Xie Baiting would be pushed out?” people started to look confused.</p><p>Gao Changtian could tell that people were confused, “The master level warrior ranking is changing every year. Du Gujue would only become more powerful…Therefore, being in the top five should be quite certain at this stage.”</p><p>As he spoke, he turned around and looked toward Ye Chen, “Ye Chen, if I have guessed it right, you are going to be either No.1 or No.2.”</p><p>“What?” This had absolutely stunned everyone.</p><p>Being in the top two might still be rather acceptable, but being in front of everyone else at No.1 would not be something that anyone could imagine.</p><p>“Little bro, I will give you a title. Do you think you can handle it?’ Gao Changtian ignored the others’ reaction and said with a big smile.</p><p>“Oh? What kind of a title?”</p><p>“Sword Master!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
