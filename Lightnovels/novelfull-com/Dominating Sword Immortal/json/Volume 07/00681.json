If it were not him, they would not have been able to kill those two hundred warriors within this short period of time. If they followed the original route, they might have really gotten stuck in that ambush zone, being cornered in an awful situation.</p><p>“Right now, I have start to believe as well that he can very likely reverse this bad situation for the palace.” Xing Meilian took a deep breath and started mumbling to herself.</p><p>“Eh? This time, the head disciple might really lose it.”</p><p>Chen Yuxin looked at Lin Canghai before glancing at Ye Chen. That first attack of Ye Chen’s had already killed dozens of people, Lin Canghai was obviously worse than Ye Chen; plus, Ye Chen was not even serious yet. After that first sword attack, all of his attacks had landed on the outer circle, stopping the enemies from running away.</p><p>In the crowd, Yao Yifeng had a cold light flashing through his eyes, but it was well hidden. Unfortunately, he could not hide it away from Ye Chen.</p><p>When Ye Chen chose to go to the right side, he knew that there would be conflict. But, he was happy to see it, since only with this kind of a moment could he have such an effect on the group. The bigger the conflict, the better the effect would be. In other words, if things developed normally, Ye Chen would not have as great of a reputation as now. But, it was indeed because of this incident that everyone was believing him blindly now.</p><p>Afterward, Ye Chen took three hundred people with him and flew toward the right. As for the middle part, it was too close to that group of old enemies and would easily spook them, which would sabotage the whole plan. Therefore, the four corners of that x shaped formation would be the best targets.</p><p>This time, the enemies were again from the Water wave School, less than two hundred of them. Amongst them, twenty were Sea of Souls Realm warriors, while one hundred and sixty were at the Astral Reaching Realm. If they attacked head-on, although Ye Chen’s three hundred warriors could definitely kill them all, there would be some casualties on their side as well.</p><p>Getting them caught completely off guard would be the best way of attack. And, since the place was the back of the whole ambushing formation, the group of warriors were even easier to attack than the first group. They did not discover Ye Chen and his group even when the latter were thirty miles away.</p><p>As a result, the first round of attack took out half of the enemies, while only thirty of them were left after the second round. With only three rounds, all of them were killed completely.</p><p>“Feels so good! I have never felt this good. Deputy leader Ye Chen is indeed such a legend. Only he could keep us not wounded at all but kill all of our enemies. Now, who dares to say anything bad about him! I, Liu Biao would be the first one attacking him or her.” A management warrior from the palace said seriously. His face was red, a sign of his sheer excitement. For the past one to two years, the top four power parties had killed so many of Azure Dragon Palace warriors, one of whom was his closest friend. He had sworn that he would kill ten opposing warriors for his friend as revenge. Right now, he was very close to finishing his promise.</p><p>“With him being here, our palace can finally redeem itself. So what if there are so many warriors on their side? We now can kill all of them.</p><p>“Yao Yifeng, you don’t really look happy. Do you have beef with our deputy leader?”</p><p>Someone had noticed that Yao Yifeng was not excited at all, which was really weird since everyone was happy about winning the battles.</p><p>Yao Yifeng chuckled dryly: “Why would I be like that? I am also impressed by our deputy leader. Before, it was me being all arrogant. I should not have doubted him at all.”</p><p>“Oh, you are still thinking about that. I believe that our Deputy Ye will not care about little things like that.” A person patted on Yao Yifeng’s shoulder and chuckled.</p><p>“That would be for the best.” The corner of Yao Yifeng’s mouth twitched.</p><p>Ye Chen did not look at Yao Yifeng as he ordered, “Left…Let’s attack.” It was the other side to the original route.</p><p>Just like that, Ye Chen and his three hundred warriors had decimated four groups of warriors— the first two groups from the Water School and the second two groups from the Sky eagle cult. While killing the later warriors, it took them a rather long period of time. After all, the Sky eagle cult was actually a beast school, famous for their trained beasts. However, the ones they trained were all eagle beasts. Ye Chen and his people had attacked all the way without stopping, killing a lot of eagle beasts. In the end, they reached the nest and killed all of them on the spot. Luckily, everything happened very smoothly, and there was nothing out of the line.</p><p>There were six groups of ambushers at the start, and with four of them destroyed, there were still two groups left.</p><p>It would not be easy to attack the two groups of warriors. As they were in the middle of the whole formation, they were actually stationed really close to each other. It would be really easy to attract the other group’s attention. Only with speed could they finish this without too much time and effort.</p><p>…</p><p>“Something is not right.” A skinny man on a ruined island frowned as he thought seriously.</p><p>“What?” The people around him asked.</p><p>“I don’t really know, but I have a really bad hunch. Do you think this mission of ours would fail?”</p><p>“Stop joking! How can we lose? Even if we do, so what? All of the people together add up to one thousand and three hundred. Should we really be afraid of anything?”</p><p>“That’s true! I might be thinking too much.” That skinny man chuckled, looking relieved. But, that bad hunch in his stomach still did not go away, which confused him a little bit as well.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>At that moment, the rocks around an island started to explode. The sky and the clouds had been connected together, stretching all the way to the horizon. Amidst the chaotic noises, groups of human warriors started to appear out of nowhere in the air. There were more and more of them, looking like black dots in that blue and white landscape painting.</p><p>“There are actually almost three hundred enemies here. Another group is hiding eighty miles from here. Everyone has to use all of your power now, everything! Otherwise, when the other group arrives, some of you will die.” Ye Chen said in a low voice.</p><p>“Deputy Leader, don’t worry, we will do everything we can! Brothers, if you do not want to die, then use everything you have for this, alright?”</p><p>Everyone was confident. Whatever Ye Chen asked them to do, they would not go against him for sure.</p><p>“Alright, let’s go!” Ye Chen took out his Thunder Disaster Sword and pointed out his finger.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>Air slicing sound was continuously heard as three hundred warriors shot toward that small island out of where.</p><p>Under that island, that bad hunch of that skinny warrior had intensified more and more. He continued to pace around, letting out his spirit power to check, hoping that he could sense something to give him a clue. But unfortunately, there was nothing.</p><p>“Is it really me?”</p><p>The man started to question himself. Every time when something bad happened, he could always sense it. Normally, it would reveal itself very soon. But this time, it had been a long time but there was still nothing. It would not be scary if there was some kind of a sign, but it was indeed when there was literally nothing which made it feel like the calm before the storm.</p><p>He let out his spirit power again.</p><p>“Fu*k! Attack! Attack!”</p><p>The warrior’s face went completely pale. His hunch had finally come true, although he wished that it would never have. Fifty miles away, forty beams of human shadows were approaching at an unbelievable speed. The warrior in the front had already lifted up that lightning-like sword, preparing for an epic attack.</p><p>“Deputy Zhao, you are not joking, are you?” The warrior next to the man asked unconsciously.</p><p>“No sh*t!” The warrior shot up from the ground.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The second he broke out of the ground, that black thunder ball landed right in the middle of the island. All of a sudden, a ball-shaped dent appeared on the landscape, and then the thunder ball exploded. It turned into beams of black lightning that looked like black demon dragons, spreading out across the whole area.</p><p>Even with the warrior’s warning in advance, everyone had no time to react. They could not be blamed really, since Ye Chen’s attack happened within a second. Even if they realized what was happening, even if they were fast enough, how could they be faster than the arriving attack?</p><p>This thunder ball took out five Sea of Souls Realm warriors instantly, along with sixty Astral Reaching Realm warriors. Besides that, this thunder ball had disturbed all of the remaining warriors, who could not join forces anymore. They started to escape in different directions to avoid the blasting zone.</p><p>Sword qi, blade qi, palm power, Zhen yuan flow…</p><p>After the thunder ball, forty other attacks arrived in the middle of the island. The whole island started to shake, as a huge amount of water had been brought up from the ocean, giving people the feeling of doomsday, with no place to hide.</p><p>“Not good! That place over there is being attacked.”</p><p>When the warriors from the Sky eagle cult were under attack, warriors on another small island eighty miles away realized what was happening. The leader of the warriors said curiously, “How are they being attacked like that right now?” He thought that Ye Chen and the group had entered the ambush formation.</p><p>“That is not important. Let’s go save them!”</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>A huge number of powerful warriors jumped into the air, flying toward the source of commotion.</p><p>“Let’s try to take care of these warriors as soon as possible.” Ye Chen had sensed the arrival of the last batch of warriors.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>All of the warriors from the palace were pumped up, killing everyone that came in their way. They had never been like this before in their whole life.</p><p>More and more people from the Sky eagle cult were being killed, only one hundred out of the two hundred remaining after the first assault. In a flash, only dozens of them were left.</p><p>“You have already entered the ambush formation, so just wait for death.” At that moment, the remaining warriors from the Sky eagle cult hollered.</p><p>Hearing him, warriors from Ye Chen’s side started to chuckle as they thought to themselves, ‘You are already the last batch of warriors. Do you really think we are in your trap?’</p><p>However, thinking back now, they could not help but get scared. Without Ye Chen, they would have indeed fallen in the ambush circle, and the ending would have been completely different from before.</p><p>Their trust in Ye Chen increased again, almost reaching fanaticism.</p><p>“You brats from the palace, your luck will end now.”</p><p>At that moment, three hundred warriors from the Water wave School rushed over, regrouping with the dozens of warriors from the Sky eagle cult. The total number was more than Ye Chen’s three hundred warriors.</p><p>“Who will lose is not decided yet.” Xing Meilian said with a loud voice.</p><p>“Haha, little bit*ch, when we get to you, I will show you things you have never seen before.” The leader of the Water School chuckled.</p><p>“Huh! Still thinking about that when you are about to die?” Xing Meilian did not care for it, looking at them as if looking at dead bodies.</p><p>“Get in the chariot.”</p><p>Ye Chen did not speak much as he took out his Golden Dragon War Chariot. It was so huge as it cruised through the sky, shining a bright golden light.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>The dozens of warriors who had been named out before had jumped on the battle chariot, which was controlled by one of the normal Sea of Souls Realm warrior. It rushed to the enemy zone while the others followed close behind, creating a rather spectacular scene.</p><p>“Battle chariot?”</p><p>The leader of the enemy frowned. It was a very rare and valuable item, and he was only a small leader who would not have the right to own one.</p><p>“So what you have the battle chariot? There will just be more and more us.”</p><p>Anyways, he did not care about it.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The two parties were getting closer and closer to each other, ready to fight head-on. The battle was about to break out. This time, it would be different from that ambush. The powerful warriors would be able to survive while the weaker ones would be eliminated.</p><p>However, with Ye Chen being there, the ending for the enemies had been decided. Up until now, he had not even used half of his true power. Plus, he had the special Defensive Sword spell.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
