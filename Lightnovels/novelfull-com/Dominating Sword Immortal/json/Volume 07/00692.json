This demonic bull emanated ripples of the most barbaric force, looking down on all creation.</p><p>“Explode!”</p><p>Wei Longtao punched at Ye Chen, the blood Qi battering the latter’s dragon bone defensive layer.</p><p>‘What powerful blood Qi! It can almost overlook the protective Zhen Yuan.’ Ye Chen retreated three steps as some minute cracks appearing in the dragon bone defensive layer. Blood Qi was a different from Zhen Yuan, as it was a unique source of power. Therefore, it was exceptionally difficult for Zhen Yuan to defend against the impact of blood Qi. However, blood Qi also couldn’t directly inflict grave injury on bodies, and could only shake the fundamental blood Qi. If Ye Chen’s skin was not covered by the dragon bone defensive layer or he had insufficient blood Qi, his blood Qi would have turned chaotic by this impact. In the worst case, it could have even collapsed completely.</p><p>“Eh? This dragon bone layer can defend against blood Qi?”</p><p>To resist two times in a row, Wei Longtao would know that the defensive dragon bone layer on Ye Chen’s skin was not simple even if he were stupid. It seemed to contain a unique blood Qi fluctuation. It could both increase the physical defense and also offset a part of the blood Qi’s impact. Since the remaining blood Qi was not too huge, it could naturally not shake the fundamental blood Qi of Ye Chen.</p><p>“So what? Watch me explode you with a punch.”</p><p>Like a mad blood-thirsty demon, Wei Longtao’s body flickered repeatedly as he punched heavily. Every single punch carried a strength of eight hundred thousand jin. If one thought about it, when a hundred thousand jin of strength was concentrated on one fist and then moved with a speed ten times that of sound, what kind of power would it bring about?</p><p>This was not the same as a huge object moving with ten times the speed of sound. The bigger the body, the more volume it would occupy. However, its power would also be scattered. The difference in the power between the two was to the extent of hundreds of folds. The strength of a hundred thousand jin was not frightening: the frightening part was all of it bursting out instantly.</p><p>Clang Clang Clang!</p><p>Ye Chen waved his longsword, issuing numerous dark golden ripples toward Wei Longtao. Compared to the pure golden ripple, this dark golden ripple was inferior in might. However, in terms of quantity, it was basically endless. No matter how fiercely Wei Longtao attacked, he was unable to gain an inch.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Wei Longtao felt like a boat going against the current. From the beginning, he hadn’t managed to gain any advantage. On the other hand, Ye Chen seemed at ease, and even gained the upper hand occasionally.</p><p>If Ye Chen was merely a martial artist focused on Zhen Yuan cultivation, he would have long lost in close combat against Wei Longtao. However, apart from primarily cultivating Zhen Yuan, Ye Chen’s physical strength of four hundred thousand jin was no joke either. Adding the Zhen Yuan, destructive sword intent, and profound sword arts on top, he didn’t lose to Wei Longtao one bit. Each strike of his targeted the opponent’s weak points, obtaining twice the results with half the effort.</p><p>Therefore, one wouldn’t understand the terror Ye Chen represented unless he or she fought him. His truly frightening aspect was that he had no weakness, and thus, the opponent couldn’t find any weak points. Conversely, since he had no weak points, the opponent’s weak points were enlarged in his eyes.</p><p>Wei Longtao’s attacks seemed strong and fierce, but they were actually rather crude and not meticulous enough. Against opponents weaker than him, he was obviously able to kill them in one hit, with a seemingly clean execution. However, before experts like Ye Chen who had no weak points, he had no way of taking control of the overall situation. He clearly took the initiative to attack, but was gradually forced on the back foot, and could only defend against Ye Chen’s unpredictable swordplay.</p><p>“How is this possible?”</p><p>Wei Longtao was growing increasingly anxious. He originally thought that by slowly increasing battle power, he would definitively suppress and cripple Ye Chen. However, the situation never changed…No, it had actually turned worse. As his strength increased, the latter’s power enhanced as well. Moreover, he could perfectly use every bit of his strength. His strength was never wasted, neither did he ever run short of it.</p><p>“My strength is equal to eight hundred jin. With the second layer of Demonic Bull Mountain Crushing Art, I can explode with a strength of a million and four thousand jin. If it had been anyone else with the same strength as him, he would have long found it unable to endure. So, why can he go on, and is even suppressing me?”</p><p>Even as the Azure Hall Leader and master of unparalleled strength, he couldn’t tell the difference between himself and Ye Chen. He felt that his battle power was slightly above Ye Chen’s. Although the latter’s destruction sword intent was powerful, his cultivation base was only at mid Sea of Soul realm, which was inferior to his. Not to mention, he was body refiner and not a Zhen Yuan cultivator. His spirit body had further been raised to the fourth step. It should be known that the third step spirit body was considered as the peak of Sea of Soul realm, and the fourth step body was considered as a King’s spirit body. It could contain much more strength, and had an absolutely frightening defense, which could allow one to face anything head-on without fearing any backlash.</p><p>‘In any case, the second realm of Demonic Bull Mountain Crushing Art can barely allow me to use the Demonic Bull Mountain Crushing Fist, instantly increasing my strength to a million and six hundred thousand jin. A sudden increase of two hundred thousand jin would absolutely suppress him.’ With his blood Qi surging, Wei Longtao prepared a huge move.</p><p>Across him, Ye Chen was also thinking about how to defeat him. If the former was a Zhen Yuan cultivator, there was no need to go through so much trouble. As long as he used the Yellow Dragon Sea from a close distance, he could have sealed his Zhen Yuan. Unfortunately, the latter primarily cultivated strength, and Great Yellow Dragon Sealing Art wouldn’t be of much use.</p><p>As for Golden Hurricane, Ye Chen was not sure. Wei Longtao surely had his killer move still concealed, not to mention that his fourth step spirit body’s defense was plain disgusting.</p><p>“Whatever…I ended up looking down on the power of a peak body refiner expert.”</p><p>In reality, Ye Chen couldn’t be blamed on looking down on Wei Longtao. The principal reason for this was because he had not encountered many body refiners. Lin Tian could be considered one, but Ye Chen’s strength had increased too quickly, and he surpassed the former in a flash. Therefore, he never managed to gain a deep understanding of body refiner experts. Thus, he could only consider himself being impulsive.</p><p>“Ye Chen, take my fist!”</p><p>As his strength accumulated to the extreme, an intense red glow appeared on Wei Longtao’s entire body, seeming like a small blood-red sun.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Striding forth, Wei Longtao punched out as the demonic bull phantom within the surging blood Qi suddenly shrank and converged on his right arm. It raised its head and roared; its two copper bells-like callous eyes showed no hesitation as it left Wei Longtao’s fist and shot toward Ye Chen headfirst.</p><p>“Hall Leader Wei has used his ultimate move.” The spectators watching from afar stopped breathing and watched unblinkingly.</p><p>Across him, Ye Chen’s clothes and long hair fluttered, looking like swords. Due to his cold expression, his two eyes turned grim, becoming long and narrow. The cold light inside seemed to almost turn substantive, like a wisp of cold Qi.</p><p>“Golden Hurricane!”</p><p>Taking a step forward, Ye Chen held the Thunder Disaster Sword with his hands and slashed out his most powerful profound sword skill with a monstrous strength.</p><p>Huff!</p><p>With that, beam-shaped dark golden ripples spread out like a polar light.</p><p>The demonic bull phantom and beam-shaped dark golden ripples collided without any sound or shockwave. The heaven and earth seemed to have lost its sound, only leaving behind an interweaving light sphere of blood-red and dark-golden color. Inside the sphere, the demonic bull phantom and golden ripples hadn’t completely dissipated, and were still in the final moments of struggle.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>With an explosion sounding as if the heaven and earth had shattered, the demonic bull phantom exploded violently. The finger-thick golden ripple left after piercing through the demonic pull phantom and immediately smashed onto Wei Longtao’s chest. Its speed was so fast that the latter had no time to react.</p><p>“It’s actually Ye Chen who came out on top.” Many spectators cried out in surprise.</p><p>“Senior Brother Ye is going to win!” Chen Yuxnin revealed a jovial expression. Compared to Azure Dragon Hall Leader Wei Longtao, she was on Ye Chen’s side. After all, the latter had convinced her much earlier.</p><p>“Even Hall Leader Wei is not Ye Chen’s opponent!”</p><p>Xing Meilian admittedly admired Ye Chen, but Wei Longtao’s prestige built over several years was too deep-rooted. If it had been her, she wouldn’t have dared to even oppose him.</p><p>“Hehe, seems like we don’t need to act.” Wu Chuan and Xu Danian let of sighs of relief.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Wei Longtao flew back in amazement. Although he was wearing semi extreme grade inner armor, in face of such a concentrated power, he couldn’t control his body’s blood Qi. The ribs on his chest gave off creaking sounds, making him a feel unbearable pain for the first time.</p><p>Ye Chen faintly creased his brows, not feeling as optimistic as the spectators.</p><p>Sure enough, upon flying back for dozens of li, Wei Longtao stabilized his figure. Wiping the blood off the corner of his mouth, he seemed completely fine, as if he’d merely suffered an insignificant injury that would basically have no effect on his battle strength and reflexes. Instead, it seemed to have made his aura even tougher and more frightening.</p><p>“Ye Chen, I admit that you are the first Sea of Soul Master I recognize except Great Elder. Unfortunately, this is not enough, far from enough! My strength is beyond your imagination. You can’t injure me by just relying on this much offensive power.” Wei Longtao’s expression calmed down.</p><p>Letting out a breath, Ye Chen sheathed the Thunder Disaster Sword and said indifferently, “I also have to admit that I underestimated you. You are much stronger than any other Sea of Soul realm expert I have met. You’re right, I won’t be able to do anything to you with this much offensive power.”</p><p>“Since you know, give yourself up! Admit your mistake before me and I’ll leave you face.”</p><p>Faintly shaking his head, Ye Chen said, “No, you don’t understand. I still haven’t used my true strength, though I very much do not wish to do so.”</p><p>“What? This is not Deputy Ye’s true strength? Is he joking?</p><p>“Right! Hall Leader Wei had already gone all out, and his defense his superior. Deputy can’t do anything to him.”</p><p>“What do you think, is Deputy Ye bluffing?”</p><p>“Can’t tell.”</p><p>The great battle between Ye Chen and Wei Longtao was an extremely high level battle, and it was enough to leave all of them speechless. They didn’t even have the qualifications to witness it closely. And now, Ye Chen was telling them that this was not his strength? They couldn’t really accept such a thing, feeling that it was too excessive.</p><p>Wu Chuan and Xu Danian exchanged glances, a little stunned and terrified. As for Chen Yuxin and Xing Meilian, they were already dumbstruck.</p><p>“Humph!” Wei Longtao snorted and then sneered, “You’re unwilling to give up even now. I can’t tell whether you’re arrogant or naive.”</p><p>“You’ll find out soon.”</p><p>With no other option left, Ye Chen decided to reveal the Defensive Sword Art. Wei Longtao’s strength was beyond his imagination. The extraordinary strength of a body refiner expert had caught him off-guard.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
