However, I had not expected to see the four warriors ranked  above him to be this powerful. They are all martial geniuses from  different eras. Although they did not manage to reach the Life and Death  Realm, they should not be underestimated. Perhaps they have already  reached the half-step king warrior level by now.”</p><p>There were countless martial geniuses from different eras who could  not manage to reach the Life and Death Realm, since judging on the old  pattern, there had only been dozens of king warriors in the past  century. So on an average, there was only one in every decade. As for  the others, no matter how powerful and legendary they were, they still  would not manage to end up reaching the Life and Death Realm.</p><p>As for half-step king warriors, it was not that easy to become one  either. If a warrior could not manage to reach the half step king level  warrior within one hundred years, then it would most likely never happen  unless she or he could get some extreme rank treasure. These four  martial geniuses were only very likely to become half-step king  warriors, but it was not certain if they would ever become one, since  they were all about one hundred to two hundred years old now. It would  be impossible to tell if they had managed to reach half-step king  warrior level before reaching one hundred years of age.</p><p>It was just like the barbarians who were hunting Ye Chen and Murong  Qingcheng, who were just close to half-step king warrior level.</p><p>“Ranking seventh, Bai Wuxue!”</p><p>“Eighth, Lu Shaoyou!”</p><p>“Thirteenth, Xia Houzun!”</p><p>“Eighteenth, Xiao Chuhe!”</p><p>“Twenty-fifth, Princess God Shark!”</p><p>Ye Chen had read about the ranking for the top five young warriors.</p><p>All of the top five young warriors had got high rankings, and Bai  Wuxue had got the highest of them all. He was ranked 7th, which was very  close to Xie Baiting. Lu Shaoyou was ranked 8th; then there was Xia  Houzun ranked 13th, and Xiao Chuhe at 18th. As for God Shark Princess  who was barely seen, had been ranked in 25th, which was the lowest of  them all. It seemed that not battling for a long time would affect the  ranking as well.</p><p>However, Ye Chen did not think that the ranking was that accurate,  and it could only be used as a reference for the analysis. It would not  be smart to take it too seriously, as it would lead to potential death  if one were not careful. For example, if one’s ranking was higher than  one’s opponent, it would be highly likely to underestimate the other and  end up being beaten.</p><p>Of course, in Ye Chen’s opinion, besides the God Shark Princess, the  other four warriors’ ranking would be rather reliable amongst the top  five young warriors.</p><p>Bai Wuxue’s power was indeed unpredictable. Although it was only  slightly higher than Xia Houzun, that Star Nuclear Finger was extremely  powerful, and Bai Wuxue had beaten him only by a little. No matter if it  was the battling power or the battle experience, it was still unknown,  and ranking him at first was not an exaggeration at all. No one would  have questioned it at all.</p><p>The Sword Master was ranked in front of Xia Houzun mostly because he  was a sword artist. After all, Xia Houzun could use his Star Nuclear  Finger to control Bai Wuxue, but he could not use it to oppress Lu  Shaoyou, since sword artists were good at attacking but not as powerful  at defending. Once Lu Shaoyou and Xia Houzun battled, it would only  result in a situation where the Star Nuclear Finger would be hard to  lock onto its opponent.</p><p>But, why was Lu Shaoyou still ranked below Bai Wuxue? The reason was  simple: Bai Wuxue was able to beat Xia Houzun when he was being  oppressed. Then, while facing Lu Shangyou who was good at head-on  battles, he was naturally more calmed. During the battle at the Nine  Dragon Lake, Bai Wuxue’s defense was something that everyone had  witnessed.</p><p>As for Xiao Chuhe, Ye Chen would not make a judgment quickly, since  this person used very simple martial arts. Each movement of his was a  killing attack. Encountering him would need fast attacks that could lead  to a definite result, which would be very hard. But, it was indeed that  which led to a result where his battling style looked way more boring  than the others’.</p><p>As for the Godly Shark Princess, Ye Chen had never really met her, so he would not know.</p><p>Besides the top five young warriors, the youngest of the top  twenty-five were above sixty years in age, while the oldest was  approaching two hundred and fifty years.</p><p>There were a lot of people who could make it into the master level  warrior ranking as well, but those who were more than two hundred and  fifty years old wouldn’t care about the mortal life. Their only wish  would be to make it into the Life and Death Realm in their lifetime;  otherwise, they would die with nothing left in decades.</p><p>In the front page of the ranking, it stated that warriors aged more  than two hundred and fifty years old would not be ranked into the  ranking. The pavilion would not want to dedicate another ranking for  them either and put these old people in another round of intense  competition, which would not be something they were devoted for.</p><p>“Yeah…Ba Geda, the head master of the Bronze Tiger Tribe, ranked 10?”</p><p>Without paying much attention, Ye Chen saw a familiar name on the list…The bronze tiger tribe.</p><p>It said that this Ba Geda was the head master of the tribe, aged one  hundred and eighty something years old, his power reaching the half-step  king warrior.</p><p>“Is this that barbarian who chased after Qingcheng and me?”</p><p>“If it is really him, then he indeed could be ranked in the top ten. I  could not believe that the pavilion had actually gotten this wide range  of resources, that even the master level from the barbarian tribes had  been recorded.”</p><p>Back then, if it were not for Murong Qingcheng using her demon power  essence by force, it would be almost impossible for them to make it out  alive. Even with the Dream Eating Wolf, they did not have one hundred  percent confidence.</p><p>One of the top three master level blade artists, Lin Chaonan was ranked 19.</p><p>The former member of the top three master level blade artist, Shen Qianlang was ranked 28.</p><p>The leader of the Snowy Martial Palace, the Snow Sword Master was ranked 39.</p><p>Soon, Ye Chen saw his own ranking: 48.</p><p>Besides his background, his battles had been recorded with professional commentary.</p><p>It said, “In the past one thousand years, there have been four top  monster-like martial geniuses. One of them was the Mysterious Queen Yan  Qingxuan. As a woman, she figured out the meaning of life and death, and  her mysterious art was something that no one could compete with. Then  there was Du Gujue and Dantai Mingyue, both of whom are very well known  as the top martial geniuses of the Sky Martial Region. Only Ye Chen came  from a small out-of-nowhere martial institution and risen all the way  to this level. His mind, heart, and endurance is something that no one  has seen…”</p><p>Ye Chen smiled gently. The comment from the pavilion was rather nice.  But, it was just someone else’s judgment after all, since no one would  know about oneself the way one would.</p><p>Soon, Ye Chen noticed that someone from the Dragon God palace had  made it into the ranking as well. It was indeed the leader of the Yellow  Dragon Palace Zhang Zhengguang. Of course, Ye Chen did not think the  other leaders of the other four palaces had the right to make it up  here, since the palace was in the east shadow sea region, which was  already out of the realm of the land. This ranking was technically of  the top master level warriors within the land, and the Yellow Dragon  palace was indeed within that area.</p><p>“There are way too many powerful warriors, and not one of them against whom I have the confidence to compete.”</p><p>Glancing at the four words on the cover “The Masters of the World”, Ye Chen closed the book.</p><p>…</p><p>On the tenth day back in the South Rudra Region, Murong Zhishui  finally finished making the antidote. After taking it, Su Ruhui was  completely cured. Not only that, Mysterious Queen had left that blockage  inside her body which also made wonders, saving her a whole lot of  effort in recovering.</p><p>Su Ruhui was fine now, so Murong Shishui and Murong Qingcheng were  naturally really happy. That half year of frustration and panic had  finally been lifted from their shoulders. Murong Zhishui had even  invited everyone for a three-day fest, including Ye Chen’s family. The  two parents finally got together, and there seemed to be the world of  things for them to talk about. Eventually, Murong Zhishui and Ye Tianhao  even got drunk for the longest time.</p><p>…</p><p>The peaceful days always went by quite quickly, and another three  months had passed within a blink of an eye. Only half a year was left  before the promised date for the battle between Du Gujue and Ye Chen.</p><p>During these three months, some other things had happened as well,  such as Chu Zhongtian finally making it to the Seas of Souls Realm.</p><p>He trained the Evil Spirit body, and once he reached Sea of Souls  Realm, it would be horrifyingly powerful. He went to the Sky Martial  Region alone. He had beaten a lot of young warriors from weak to  powerful before heading out to challenge Lin Tian, who had been beaten  by Ye Chen before. After exchanging hundreds of attacks, he had won as  well. That battling power he showed had caused panic amongst a lot of  young warriors.</p><p>A lot of people were discussing how Chu Zhongtian might be one of the  martial geniuses after the top three ones; what made him different  would be his body instead of his martial arts.</p><p>The Evil Spirit Body was one of the rarest body types after all.</p><p>He did not train Zhen yuan, but instead Evil yuan. When he was at the  Astral Reaching Realm, he had already shown a crazily strong power. As  he reached the Sea of Souls Realm, that power had increased again. In  other words, each realm he got to would offer more advantage with his  Evil yuan than for others. The others might need to use profound sense  to increase their battling power, but all he needed would be his evil  yuan to cancel out this kind of disadvantage for him. It was indeed the  type of body that everyone wished they had.</p><p>After beating Lin Tian, Chu Zhongtian was not arrogant enough to  challenge the top five young warriors, since he knew that his  cultivation was still too low. And because of his evil yuan, normal  pellets or spirit plants would not be able to improve his early Sea of  Souls Realm to the peak level.</p><p>However, with him being this popular, his martial school and family  naturally could not be happier. They started their searching spree,  trying to help him gain even more power, since the future of the school  and the family would all be depending on him now.</p><p>In comparison to Chu Zhongtian, Jing Aoxuan and Li Xiaoyun, who used  to be ranked at the same level and were even somewhat higher, seemed  rather dull right now. But of course, they could not be blamed, since  their comprehensive ability was already world class, but it would be  ordinary in Sky Martial region. They did not have Chu Zhongtian’s evil  spirit body, so they needed to ameliorate their cultivation and other  martial arts in order to improve their battling power.</p><p>Inside the South Region, only Ye Chen’s reputation was still hot.  Even Chu Zhongtian could not compete with it unless he could have the  power to defeat Ye Chen.</p><p>If there were Ye Chen and Chu Zhongtian in the South, then there was  an extremely outstanding young warrior in the North named Beiming Hui.  He and his spear had beaten a lot of young warriors. It was actually  nothing inside the Sky Martial Region, since there were so many of them.  But, something followed that had shocked everyone—Beiming Hui and Lan  Xieqing as well as a young warrior close to the latter got into a fight  which caused them to battle with each other. And the result had shocked  everyone.</p><p>Beiming Hui had managed to chase after Lan Xieqing for hundreds of miles all the way back to his martial school.</p><p>After that, everyone thought the new strong ones had all appeared,  seeing that countless powerful warriors were emerging in different  regions. The south had two top warriors while the north had a shocking  martial genius as well. Added with the top five young warriors above  them all and those of who had been famous for a long time, the whole  land seemed to be in chaos.</p><p>But somehow, it was still not over.</p><p>In the beginning of March, Du Gujue arranged a battle with someone in  the South Crane Lake, and it was indeed Luo Haisong, who was similarly  powerful as Lan Tian and Lan Xieqing.</p><p>Obviously, millions of people watched the battle.</p><p>And there were only ten attacks that were exchanged before Du Gujue won!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
