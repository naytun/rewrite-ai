Most importantly, the availability among different semi extreme rank weapons would be slightly different as well. Normally, the defensive ones would be twice as valuable as the attacking ones. Currently, the warriors with semi extreme rank weapons already were not more than five out there, including Lin Tian.</p><p>If Xia Houzun had a semi extreme rank defense weapon during that battle on top of the Nine Dragon Lake, that last attack from Bai Wuxue would not have wounded him that badly, costing him all of his battling power.</p><p>Therefore, he had definitely set his eyes on this one here.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The phoenix did not even waste time talking to Xia Houzun as the burning wings with blue flames flapped once, already catching up with the blue shield that had been blown away, its claw reaching out for it.</p><p>“You are looking for death! The things that I have got my eyes on, no one can steal them from me!”</p><p>Although Xia Houzun’s speed was not as fast as the phoenix which was actually Yan Fengfeng, but that falling star finger power was enough. It covered the whole area like the most spectacular star falling. Amongst all of the falling star finger power, there was a massive bright comet which was way faster than the rest; they all attacked toward the blue phoenix at once.</p><p>With this amount of falling star power, even the top five young warriors would not dare to just use their protective Zhen yuan to fight against, not to mention that there was still a beam of comet light which was ten times more powerful than the rest. Yan Fengfeng knew that if she just let it attack her, then she could definitely get the blue shield that she wanted, but she would be wounded badly as well. And it was already because of her real form as the phoenix; if it were the other top five young warriors, then they would get even more severe wounds.</p><p>However, once being wounded, she would no longer be able to compete with Xia Houzun and her speed would be affected as well. Therefore, all she could do was to escape from that incoming attack using her extreme speed and avoid it.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The blue fire line flashed once and Yan Fengfeng avoided the sky-encompassing finger power. In the next second, her side of the valley just disappeared out of the blue like there was never anything there. That finger power had even left a massive hole on the ground.</p><p>After pushing away Yan Fengnfeng, Xia Houzun’s body shook once as he reached out to grab that shield.</p><p>“Major Phoenix Cut!”</p><p>But, Yan Fengfeng was not the kind of person who would just swallow the unfair treatment. She waved her wings and two massive beams of flame tore apart the sky; one of it attacked right at Xia Houzun in the front while the other right above him. As long as he moved forward, he would definitely be wounded.</p><p>“How dare you!”</p><p>Xia Houzun was furious, reaching out his left index finger and pointing it out. All of a sudden, an endless gravity appeared ten meters away from his fingertip. Those two streams of flame started to scatter the closer they got to Xia Houzun, before eventually turning into a blue light ball which was getting bigger and bigger. It meant that there was more and more power that had been absorbed.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>Eventually, the incoming flame attack had been shattered completely, turning into foam. Meanwhile, the other beam of attack had only gotten thirty percent of the power left as it ended up clashing with Xia Houzun who was moving forward. That aggressive fire wave almost lit up the whole sky.</p><p>All of these movements might seem very complicated, but it all happened within a second. Xia Houzun, who had used his Star Nuclear Finger, had taken out one incoming flame attack while shattering almost whole of the second beam as well. However, Yan Fengfeng in her real form was extremely powerful, so those two beams of attack contained an extra rich and tense power, which was even more intense than Bai Wuxue’s attack that was too powerful for Xia Houzun’s attack to shatter completely. Eventually, Xia Houzun had been blown away by the remaining power.</p><p>“Go! Explode!”</p><p>Inside the fire wave, Xia Houzun’s voice was heard, and that blue light ball shadow floating in the air attacked right at Yan Fengfeng. It then exploded drastically, and a massive blast wave had been brought up, covering the whole sky. The whole valley had been turned into a flat ground by the aggressive shockwave.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Yan Fengfeng’s speed was so fast that no one could compete. Under the condition where she got to react first as well, that shockwave was not able to catch up with her. By the time it reached her, the power had already decreased by ninety percent. The remaining ten percent of the power only made her wobble a little, losing one or two feathers.</p><p>Xia Houzun was not really wounded. No matter how powerful that flame attack was, it would still be impossible to break through his protective Zhen yuan and wound his real body.</p><p>“Alright, it is indeed the blue phoenix. The beast yuan is so rich that even my star nuclear finger attack could not handle it.” Xia Houzun’s expression looked more serious now. Earlier on, his attack was able to oppress Bai Wuxue, and he thought he would be more than enough for Yan Fengfeng. But, he had not expected to see that the latter was a completely different type of warrior; she had an extremely rich beast yuan, which could generate an extremely powerful flame power. Meanwhile, his Star Nuclear Finger Art had its own limitation: it would be impossible for it to continue to handle more, and there was a breaking point as well.</p><p>In a simpler sense, Yan Fengfeng with her powerful beast yuan could not be controlled by his Star Nuclear Finger Art.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng said coldly, “Xia Houzun, it was me who found this semi extreme rank weapon first. So, no matter who came, he or she should not be expecting to take it just like this. But, you could surely try.”</p><p>“Oh? You could handle the Star Nuclear Finger Art attack, so I wonder if you can take on my Void Shattering Finger Attack.”</p><p>The former was not an attacking martial art, and the Void Shattering Finger Art was his most powerful attacking martial art. Even Bai Wuxue could only handle it barely with his full power.</p><p>“Enlighten me!”</p><p>The frequency of her wings flapping increased and the burning blue flame lit up the air as if it were boiling water. Meanwhile, the space looked like it was going to shatter at any second. She was very clearly aware of how powerful the Void Shattering Finger art could be. Not only its attacking speed was extremely fast, but its attacking power was also on point. Amongst the top five young warriors, the most concerning attack of them all would be Xia Houzun’s Void Shattering Finger Attack for her. But of course, if she really wanted to leave, no one could stop her; but, she could not leave right now.</p><p>“Huh!”</p><p>Xia Houzun looked cold as he decided to teach Yan Fengfeng a good lesson to show her no one amongst the top five young warriors would try to fight against him.</p><p>Meanwhile, Yan Fengfeng was also at the level where she could explode any moment. Although her speed was extremely fast, he was still one of the top five young warriors after all.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>The atmosphere was like a string on the bow that had been tightened to almost the breaking point. The sky in the distance had been dyed crystal green out of the blue as if the whole sky turned into a massive emerald stone. That powerful vibration spread out the whole area and the space started to vibrate, bringing up water patterns in the air.</p><p>“The treasure palace on the fourth floor has appeared!”</p><p>Xia Houzun’s expression changed drastically a couple of times as he was hesitant.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng had also noticed the sudden change in the distance. But, she knew that before she left for that, she would have to get what belonged to her.</p><p>“Yan Fengfeng, I will let you have it this time. But, if I run into you another day, a battle is in order.” Leaving this line, Xia Houzun stopped thinking about that shield. A beam of gold light flashed once as he flew over toward the source of the vibration. He soon reached his fastest speed, disappearing in the sky.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>Letting out a deep breath, Yan Fengfeng’s body suddenly shrank, turning into a human shape. Her body then dove down in the air, grabbing onto that blue shield.</p><p>“The first level of the tower is always open, and the second floor would only open to public in the second year. The third would open on the third year, which would only last for one month. The fourth level would only open on the fourth year, also lasting for only one month. However, within this one month, the second, third, fourth floors are all connected. After this month, all of the floors will be closed. People would have to wait for the fifth year to try again when all of the floors would open by then. However, the fourth floor is where all of the most valuable things are. The chance of getting a semi extreme rank weapon inside or a full set of top rank weapons is extremely high. There is no reason to give that up.”</p><p>Yan Fengfeng had never been to the fourth level yet.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Yan Fengfeng followed Xia Houzun’s direction.</p><p>…</p><p>For the past couple of days, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng had only obtained two top rank weapons—they got the first one on the second floor world while another one on the third floor. Besides them, they had gotten nothing.</p><p>Although the top rank weapons were great, but both of them already had some. So, they did not really care about them. The purpose of this trip was to get a semi extreme rank weapon.</p><p>“It seems like we do not have much luck, huh?” Ye Chen said a bit low-spiritedly.</p><p>Murong Qingchen was about to say something before she suddenly noticed the change in the horizon. “Look!”</p><p>“Perhaps it is the fourth level’s treasure palace?” Ye Chen’s eyes shrank a little.</p><p>Before they came here, Murong Zhishui had told them that there was a treasure palace on each level. Although there were not that many weapons within, most of them were of high ranks. However, it would not depend on luck whether one could get it or not; it was all about power. If one did not have enough power, then he would not be able to get anything.</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The two did not waste a second, flying into the air immediately.</p><p>The majestic-looking great palace stood on the ground, shining a crystal green color as if it was made with tensed treasure qi. But, this palace shone with an even purer emerald green color.</p><p>There were already some people outside the main door to the palace. They were all famous top young warriors, such as Du Gujue, Beiming Hui, Dantai Mingyue, Lin Tian, Lan Xieqing and so on.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!…</p><p>A few human shadows flew out, including the five young warriors, as well some of the not-famous but extremely powerful young warriors. The latter were just like Beiming Hui, who had just come to the Sky Martial Region and were still trying things out.</p><p>Seeing that there were this many powerful warriors, Lin Tian and the rest’s expressions changed a little. Not to mention the top five young warriors, they had not expected to see this many powerful warriors, especially lot of whom were unrecognizable. Even though it was not really news that there were still so many powerful warriors out there, seeing it visually in front of oneself was still a shock to many.</p><p>Everyone was waiting outside without entering. It was not that they did not want to enter. But, there was a light layer that looked like green crystal outside the palace. It was extremely thick, and would not be that easy to break through.</p><p>Sneering once, Lu Shaoyou was the first one to move. He took out his great sword and the sword qi spread out the whole area, slashing the green light cover which did not make a sound at all. Strings of tough but gentle beams of green light shot out, fighting with the sword qi. Although the latter was extremely sharp and aggressive as it cut down the green light, those green light strings seemed to be endless, continuously pouring out from the light layer. The attack did not look like it made an impact.</p><p>Bai Wuxue looked the same as he said, “This is the palace’s restricting power. Only by breaking through can we enter. Let’s all do it together!”</p><p>As he said, he threw out a palm attack. That powerful palm power landed right onto the light layer, and countless strings of light shot out all of a sudden to cancel out the incoming attack.</p><p>With both Lu Shaoyou and Bai Wuxue attacking, the rest of them did not wait for another second before joining, performing their best martial arts and attacking the green light cover. Of course, no one dared to use their ace attacks yet, since it would be the last card in the deck; they would not use it unless it was really necessary. Plus, there was no yuan qi in the fourth level world, and every usage would be irreplaceable. Even with pellets to recover the Zhen yuan, it would not be able to sustain the usage, it might easily lower its purity.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
