There is rarely any demon power yuan qi in this land. If you want to improve your cultivation quickly, then you will have to use it.” Ye Chen said after he saw that Murong Qingcheng was okay.</p><p>She nodded in response. The land now was the land of humans. Not to mention the demon power, even some of the demon element medicines were rare. Therefore, it would be rather hard to use external objects to improve cultivation, and that would not last for long either. But, with the demon essence, she could be able to at least reach the peak level Late Sea of Souls Realm.</p><p>“It is already halfway through the one year time period. Let’s get back to the South Rudra region!” Besides the Ant King Plant, they had gotten everything on the list. And this plant could be replaced by Black Ant plant. It should be fine if there were no more surprises, since it was not the main ingredients for the antidote anyway.</p><p>After he took out his flying puppet, the two hopped on it and flew toward the south.</p><p>…</p><p>After more than one month…</p><p>The south region, Murong Family…</p><p>“What? You have found all of the ingredients for the antidote?” Murong Zhishui was very shocked. In fact, for the past six months, he had not been relaxing either. He had been asking everyone from the family to try and collect the ingredients, and had even spent a huge amount of spirit stones on buying any related information. In his opinion, Su Ruhui and Murong Qingcheng were his everything, and nothing could compare with them.</p><p>But, he had not expected to hear that the two had already found everything within only six months, since he had only gotten one-tenth of what was needed with all of the time and efforts he had invested.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng said, “It is all Ye Chen’s work. When I went to find him in the Sky Martial Region, he had already gotten most of the ingredients.”</p><p>Murong Zhishui looked at Ye Chen full of gratitude, “Thank you so much! I knew that trusting you with Qingcheng was the right decision. You are a responsible man!”</p><p>Ye Chen did not expect that straightforward a comment, so he struggled to find the right response. On his side, Murong Qingcheng blushed clearly as well.</p><p>“Sir, these are all of the required ingredients.” Ye Chen took out a low-rank storage ring and handed it over to Murong Zhishui, “However, we did not find the Ant King Plant, only a couple of Black Ant Plants. I wonder if they could be used to replace that?”</p><p>Murong Zhishui laughed, “I do not know if it could work or not, but it should be fine. I have a lot of them.”</p><p>He had gotten them from an auction before.</p><p>“That’s good to hear.” Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng let out a breath of relief.</p><p>Right now, all of the preparations had been done.</p><p>“Alright! Right now, just leave the making of antidote to me. You go to find a yard and rest! Qingcheng…I will leave Qingcheng to you now.”</p><p>After collecting everything, Murong Qingcheng was in a better mood, and a glow appeared on her face.</p><p>“Dad! Go make that antidote!” Murong Qingcheng pushed out Murong Zhishui.</p><p>“Alright, alright! I am going now!”</p><p>It was not hard for Murong Zhishui to make that antidote, since the Shadowless Poison was created by the demi demon family right in the beginning, so the recipe and the method had all been well preserved. In this period of time, Murong Zhishui had thought about countless times, so there should not be a problem.</p><p>After Murong Zhishui had left, only Ye Chen and Murong Zhishui stood there.</p><p>“I haven’t seen the view here yet. Take me around!” Ye Chen chuckled, it was time for their tensed nerves to relax a little.</p><p>…</p><p>In the next couple of days, Murong Zhishui devoted his whole time and effort in making the antidote, to the point where he did not even leave the room anymore. Meanwhile, Murong Qingcheng had taken Ye Chen everywhere for sightseeing, so a lot of people had seen them holding hands and walking everywhere.</p><p>“It looks like that Ye Chen warrior will be our future leader.”</p><p>“Our young lady is famous for her beauty. Warrior Ye is a lucky one!”</p><p>“That is not accurate! Now that warrior Ye has become this famous in the Sky Martial Region, being just right below the top five young warriors, only he would be the rightful man for our lady.”</p><p>“You are right!”</p><p>On a particular day…</p><p>Ye Chen suggested, “I have been back for a couple of days now. I need to head back to check on my parents. Do you want to come with me?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng also thought it was time for her to meet Ye Chen’s parents officially.</p><p>…</p><p>Sky Wind Nation, inside the Ye family lobby…</p><p>Ye Tianhao and Shen Yuqing sat on top while Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng sat below.</p><p>“Miss Qingcheng, you have to stay for a couple of days this time so that I can get to know you more.” Shen Yuqing said to Murong Qingcheng gently.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng was a bit surprised. Her face shone with a bright mellow light without that black cloth of hers, “Ms. Shen, just call me Qingcheng. As long as you do not get annoyed of me, I can stay for as long as you want.”</p><p>“Hehe…How could I get annoyed of you?” Shen Yuqing said, “Such a beautiful girl like you is so rare in this world.”</p><p>Seeing Murong Qingcheng’s face, both Ye Tianhao and Shen Yuqing were shocked at her beauty. They were also very happy for Ye Chen bringing back such a pretty future wife, since their son was not normal. And if those normal rich guys could get three or four pretty wives, then how could their son be any worse?</p><p>Right then, Ye Tianhao made a face at Shen Yuqing, who seemed to remember something at that moment. She took out a purple jade tag with a cloud pattern carved on top from her storage ring, then walked down and handed it over to Murong Qingcheng, “Qingcheng, this is our family treasure. Right now, I will hand it over to you.”</p><p>“Thank you!” Murong Qingcheng took it over happily.</p><p>“Dad! Mom! Where is our older brother?”</p><p>A string of light footsteps was heard as two seven or eight years old looking kids ran in: they were indeed Ye Xuan and Ye Xiaoxiao.</p><p>“Little guys!”</p><p>Shen Yuqing chuckled. These kids had been running around the house up and down every day. They must have heard that Ye Chen was back.</p><p>Ye Chen picked both of them up and joked, “You guys have gained quite a bit of weight, haven’t you?”</p><p>Ye Xuan said, “Brother, other people’s older brothers and sisters always come back to see them. Why don’t you come back more often?”</p><p>“Yeah!” Ye Xiaoxiao looked at Ye Chen with her big eyes.</p><p>“You will know when you guys grow up.”</p><p>“Grow up? We are already all grown up!”</p><p>Ye Tianhao said with a smile, “Would you still be following your big brother around if you were all grown up?”</p><p>Hearing him, Ye Xuan and Ye Xiaoxiao made a face. On the side, Murong Qingcheng laughed; kids were funny after all. She wondered what Ye Chen was like when he was younger.</p><p>Seeing everyone having a good time, Ye Chen was very satisfied as well. In this world, he had a functional family, and what he needed to do now was to continue getting stronger and explore the profound of the universe. Plus, only with stronger power could he then protect his family better.</p><p>…</p><p>The Ye family had a massive house, which was right next to a huge mountain and river. Right next to the calm lake, Ye Chen was training his sword art. Gold light flew through his body before jumping into the normal longsword he was holding.</p><p>“It feels slightly wrong. I think it should be more natural.”</p><p>“It was too aggressive, which had disturbed the harmony of the gold pattern.”</p><p>As he practiced repeatedly, Ye Chen’s understanding was getting deeper and deeper.</p><p>Inside the pavilion hundreds of meters away, Murong Qingcheng was spending some time with Ye Xuan and Ye Xiaoxiao, watching Ye Chen train.</p><p>“He is working so hard! I will become like my older brother one day!” Ye Xuan tightened his fists.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng said, “You can start working hard when you reach ten years of age.” Ye Chen’s hard work impressed her as well. When she first met him, he was not that powerful yet. But every time she saw him subsequently, she could tell that he had improved a lot, and was getting more and more famous. Ye Chen’s fame had grown from the South Rudra Region to the Southern regions, then from there to the Sky Martial Regions. He was just constantly shining his bright light wherever he went.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>An air tearing sound was heard as a sword light spread out.</p><p>“If I want the mellowness of the water and the sharpness of the metal, the two have to work together. Only then would it be considered complete. But, it is not that easy.”</p><p>Putting away his sword, Ye Chen let out a breath.</p><p>“Let’s go. I will take you guys around.”</p><p>Ye Chen would not force himself when he could not make a breakthrough, because he knew that it would be pointless. After all, a breakthrough was about the right timing and right place.</p><p>Flying over the Ye family, Ye Chen made a noise. He turned his body before landing back in the Ye family; it was not his yard though, but a side yard.</p><p>That Ye family disciple was training sword as well. He was using a soft sword, so his sword art was very mellow like the water element.</p><p>The sword light danced in the yard like the moonlight reflected in water, coming together at times.</p><p>“Soft sword, gentle, sword light…!”</p><p>As a master level warrior of Sea of Souls Realm, Ye Chen was not spotted at all. He was staring at this sword art as if he was under some kind of a spell.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng landed on the ground with Ye Xuan and Ye Xiaoxiao, using her Zhen yuan to secured an area. She knew that Ye Chen was learning something and he should not be disturbed.</p><p>After practicing a route, this disciple wiped away the sweat and was about to put away his sword. Suddenly, he realized that someone was training right next to him as well, so he jumped a bit.</p><p>Waiting until he realized that it was actually Ye Chen, he held his breath immediately and did not dare to make another move.</p><p>Ye Chen was the legendary existence in the whole of Southern region, the sword genius, the pride of the Ye family. Even if he had never been this excited his whole life, he knew that he could not disturb Ye Chen.</p><p>“The soft sword is soft like water. But, even if the sword is soft, it is still a sword that is sharp. Yes! This is it!”</p><p>Ye Chen sank into his practice of gold pattern as if he were someone else.</p><p>Slowly, a golden pattern filled up the whole area. It was not a sword light or sword qi, but was actually formed from a mysterious power.</p><p>As the gold pattern accumulated more and more, it was getting more and more gentle. But, its attacking power was slowly revealing as well. Soon, everything in the yard turned into nothingness. In that critical moment, Murong Qingcheng formed a layer of Zhen yuan, protecting this disciple of Ye family as well.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>After a while, Ye Chen waved out his sword, and that gold pattern spread out. Not just this disciple, even Murong Qingcheng thought that it seemed like a real water pattern, except being golden in color, and the fact that they could not block out this attack at all.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>A light green pond was separated all of a sudden. What was amazing was that this pond did not come back together, as if it was like this the whole time. The edge of the cut was extremely soft as well, impossible to tell that it was made by a sword.</p><p>“Completed!” Ye Chen stopped his movement and turned around to see that disciple with a bright red face.</p><p>“What’s your name?” Ye Chen asked.</p><p>“Ye…Ye Xiaoshui!”</p><p>Ye Chen smiled and said, “You have a good sword art going on.” The reason that he was able to finish his gold pattern was because of this disciple.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
