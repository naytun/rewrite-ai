Previously, at least a dozen battles would break out within a month, whereas now, even a single fight was rare. Both sides seemed to have a tacit understanding. When I transport resources, you’ll not appear, and when you transport resources, I’ll not appear to ambush you. Otherwise, everybody would truly move out, waging an all out war.</p><p>Evidently, neither side was prepared for that. Dragon God Celestial Palace couldn’t because Dragon King was still in seclusion, while the four enemy forces also feared Dragon King. IF they went too far, Dragon King would certainly pay them back once he left the seclusion.</p><p>Without any battles, Ye Chen would naturally not continue to stay. The reason he’d come to Dragon God Celestial Palace was to redeem the affairs Blood Battle Ocean, and he’d already done well over that.</p><p>One day, Ye Chen arrived at Dragon God Celestial Palace and resigned the position of Azure Dragon Hall Deputy. Although Elders Association was quite unwilling, they had no means to make him stay. Moreover, the current situation was quite calm, and Ye Chen’s presence would have no meaning, except for wasting his time.</p><p>“We’re leaving!”</p><p>Inside the great hall, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng entered the conveyor gate.</p><p>—————</p><p>South Rudra Sect, Conveyor Room.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Two figures walked out of the conveyor gate.</p><p>“Ye Chen.”</p><p>Long Biyi was waiting outside. Seeing Ye Chen, a faint smile broke out on her face.</p><p>“Sect Master Long!”</p><p>Ye Chen cupped his fists.</p><p>“This time was all thanks to you. It’s surprising that you alone were able to turn around situation of Blood Battle Ocean.” Long Biyi’s mood was pretty good. It couldn’t be helped. When Ye Chen had left, she had no hope that Ye Chen’s help would allow Dragon God Celestial Palace to suppress the four enemy forces. As long as he could bring the situation under control or even keep the situation from further deterioration, it would have been enough. It could be said that Ye Chen’s performance was far beyond her imagination, almost giving her a fright.</p><p>Ye Chen said,”To be able help Dragon God Celestial Palace in the time of crisis is Ye Chen’s honor. Sect Leader Long need not act too polite. I can also be considered as a member of Dragon God Celestial Palace.”</p><p>“That is true.”</p><p>Long Biyi faintly smiled. Although Ye Chen had resigned from the position of Azure Dragon Hall Deputy, his identity was still that of honorable Dragon God Envoy.</p><p>After making some small talks with Long Biyi, Ye Chen returned to Ye family with Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>Within one year, Ye Chen had returned home thrice. Having a conveyor gate was quite convenient. If not for each use consuming too many supreme grade spirit stones, Ye Chen might even be returning every day.</p><p>After waging war for a year, Ye Chen was also somewhat fatigued. For the next week, he didn’t cultivate at all, nor did he ponder too much about various affairs. He spent every day with leisure- accompanying his father and mother for chat, having fun with his younger siblings, or entering the two-people-world with Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>However, this was also the time Ye Chen went through the most important first baptism of a person’s life.</p><p>The first night, Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng consumated. The two went crazy until the dawn of the next day. Murong Qingcheng’s body was beautiful, sleek like silk. And her stature was tall, neither frail nor too ample. Thanks to their cultivation base of Sea of Soul realm, their endurance was astonishing. Their crazy antics through the night instead made them feel completely rejuvenated. Indistinctly, their temperaments slightly changed. To say the least, Ye Tianhao and Shen Yuqing gave a knowing smile upon seeing Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng.</p><p>Ye Chen was already twenty seven year old. Losing his virginity, he was inevitably a bit impatient, always looking for an opportunity to make love with Murong Qingcheng. The latter’s charm was indeed too huge. Since she cultivated demonic body, she gave off a kind of noble yet enticing feeling as if a combination of an angel and devil. Murong Qingcheng was quite proactive on the bed, completely unlike her otherwise calm self.</p><p>In short, the two experienced the love and passion during this short time period.</p><p>———— –</p><p>The morning air was fresh and most. Chirping of small birds could be heard outside.</p><p>Opening his eyes, Ye Chen looked at Murong Qingcheng beside him, and a faint smile appeared on his face. Before his eyes, Murong Qingcheng’s jade-like body lay sideways, only covered by a thin silk sheet which was absolutely incapable of covering her stunning curves. Her protruding buttocks were half covered, presenting snow-white bulges. Her chest seemed like an exaggerated arc, seemong even more ample together.</p><p>“How many times was it yesterday? Probably five!”</p><p>Bitterly smiling, Ye Chen get off the bed naked and went to the bathroom.</p><p>By the time he was done bathing, Murong Qingcheng was already awake. She deeply stretched, making the silk cloth immediately fall down.</p><p>“You little devil!”</p><p>Ye Chen walked over and kissed her.</p><p>Murong Qingcehng winked, revelling.</p><p>After going on for another half a day, Ye Chen finally made his way out of the bedroom and arrived in the courtyard.</p><p>This garden was one of the most luxurious courtyards of Ye family. It had trees, a lake, a garden, rockery, pavilions, buildings- seeming like a little paradise. Taking a deep breath, Ye Chen wore his longsword and arrived before the lake,</p><p>“Chop!”</p><p>Making a grasping motion with both hands, Ye Chen chopped down.</p><p>Woosh!</p><p>The air rummaged, and a clear long scar appeared in the lake.</p><p>“Strange, my Zhen Yuan seemed to have increased a lot and will soon break through into late Sea of Soul realm.”Ye Chen could feel the Zhen Yuan surging inside him. It seemed like unceasing torrential rain. It gave off a feeling as if it wished to gush out.</p><p>Not giving it much thought, Ye Chen adjusted his state of mind and gradually sank into cultivation.</p><p>As of now, apart from Void Shattering Finger, Golden Ripple, Sword Control Art, and Blood Severing Ghost Finger, all his other martial skills had been perfected and could no longer be cultivated.</p><p>Moreover, he’d already cultivated Void Shattering Finger to ninety percent completion last year. Although attaining perfection was not that easy, he had a feeling that so long as an opportunity arose, he would easily attain the greater success and cultivate to perfection.</p><p>Golden Ripple was exceptionally hard. This was a high grade profound martial skill. A year worth of bitter cultivation and tempering merely allowed him to raise it from thirty-forty percent completion to forty-fifty percent. However, this was already frightening enough. In terms of strength, it was right behind Sword Control Art and was not much weaker than the latter.</p><p>Ye Chen had always believed that the exchange with Situ Hao was the highest profit he’d ever made. For the time being, Sword Control Art was at the peak of the second realmr. But be it speed or offensive power, it was no second hand technique, but an absolute killer move.</p><p>He didn’t know whether Situ Hao’s current glory on Masters List was due to him or not. However, this was not important at all. If he could attain or even leave himself behind, he would not regret it. If he could chase up to Ye Chen, that would be because of talent. Without talent, even if he’d all the resources at his disposal, he would not be able to become a top expert. At most, he would become a rare expert.</p><p>Sword Control Art was powerful, but Ye Chen would not look down on Blood Severing Ghost Finger.</p><p>This technique was too strange. Slash of a finger could produce strange sights. That white-robed soul’s figure was becoming increasingly clear. One time Ye Chen even saw him smile at him. He didn’t know if it was just an illusion. It was too realistic, so he couldn’t differentiate between reality and illusion.</p><p>Perhaps Dragon King would know what was happening, but he was in seclusion.</p><p>“Sword Control Art’s second realm is sufficiently stabilized, now it’s time to attack the third realm.”</p><p>In the third realm, it would be possible to split Zhen Yuan into flying sword. With Ye Chen’s soul power and sword intent, one Zhen Yuan flying sword would be able to kill a peak Master. If he could shoot hundred or even thousand flying sword simultaneously, its might would be hard to estimate. After all, throughout history, the highest might Sword Control Art had exhibited was seventy two flying swords. In the legends, someone was able to attain nine*nine eighty-one swords. Though it was never confirmed.</p><p>—————</p><p>Southern Sector.</p><p>Golden Sand Region.</p><p>In an extremely high class restaurant, Chu Zhongtian was drinking wine along with other geniuses of Golden Sand Region.</p><p>Sitting beside him was her junior sister Demoness. Purple hair, purple eyes, and an enchanting figure- she was extremely seductive.</p><p>“Elder Brother Chu, nowadays you are the fastest rising figure of the southern sector- a toast to you.”</p><p>Evidently, the geniuses of Golden Sand Region followed blindly behind Chu Zhongtian. After all, the young tyrant from before had now entered the Masters List, ranked within the top twenty. It was an honor sufficient to shake the whole southern sector. Edict Prince and Thunder Princess from then were although still dazzling, they paled a lot when compared to Chu Zhongtian.</p><p>The sec associated with him could even said to be basking in unparalleled glory in southern sector, numerous youngsters joining the sect. In any case, a fifth grade sect was a fifth grade sect indeed. It was a King’s sect, not something small sects could compare to.</p><p>Chu Zhongtian’s expression was apathetic, showing no pretense.</p><p>However, this appearance of Chu Zhongtian was already habitual for everybody else. If he instead showed amiable or pleasant expression, they would certainly think something was wrong.</p><p>“Eldest brother, I’ll fill your cup.”</p><p>The Demoness was named Zhou Meiting and was the second sister of Chu Zhongtian. The two’s relationship had always been dubious. However, Zhou Meiting always thought that Chu Zhongtian was too proud and would change women like changing clothes, and thus, she never went all the way. However, as she saw the latter establishing a powerful foothold in Sky Martial Region, she began to feel a sense of crisis. She then began to take the initiative to preserve the relationship between the two, believing that she could certainly be able to keep his heart firmly with her.</p><p>“Elder Brother Chu, you only have mid Sea of Soul realm cultivation and still ranked in the top twenty. Once you enter late Sea of Soul realm, you’d be unparalleled under the heavens in the same generation.”</p><p>‘Brother Song is right.”</p><p>Everybody was praising him.</p><p>Chu Zhongtian accepted the wine cup offered by Zhou Meiting and drained it in one cup, then indifferently said,”I’ve confidence for others, but southern sector also have Ye Chen.”</p><p>During these years, Chu Zhongtian had run into many frightening geniuses like the once called five young tycoons, two monstrosities who suddenly rose to prominence like Situ Hao and Bei Minghui- each and every one of these figures were who would be limited to their own ponds. However, in Chu Zhongtian’s brain was an image. Behind all these geniuses was a huge figure facing backwards. This figure was so immense that it was almost covering the entire sky, and all the geniuses were engulfed in his shadow. His facial features were not clear. He could only see that sword Qi like sharp gaze.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
