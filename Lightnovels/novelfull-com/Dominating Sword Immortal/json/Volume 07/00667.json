Be it essence or might, both are king grade.”</p><p>Previously, even though the peak fourth step Destruction Sword Spirit had a might comparable to a peak fifth step ordinary Sword Spirit, which was a king grade might, in terms of essence, it was at the fourth step in the end. However, as of now, it had finally upgraded to the fifth step Sword Spirit. As for the might, it was comparable to a sixth grade ordinary Sword Spirit.</p><p>“Fifth step is King Sword Spirit, sixth step is peak King Sword Spirit, and seventh step is Emperor Sword Spirit. Every step is harder to improve than the previous one, but the might also increases several folds. In terms of will, I’m already not far from peak King grade. At most, I only lack somewhat in application.”</p><p>Ye Chen understood the terror of fifth step Destruction Sword Spirit. Previously, if he didn’t use the Defensive Sword Art, his strength was more or less the same as Master Sky Sword. However, he could kill the latter now in just a few moves.</p><p>“Let’s test out the specifics first.”</p><p>Standing before a rockery, Ye Chen’s forehead faintly swelled, emitting a black, jade-like mist. In the next moment, a black illusory sword flew out and swept across the rockery, so fast that it seemed illusory.</p><p>The space around the rockery warped, and in the next moment, the dozens of meters high rockery disintegrated into a fine powder with a puff sound due to the sword intent. Since the speed of destruction was too high, it kept its image for a moment before suddenly sinking in, dust and ash rising in the air.</p><p>“The might seems even higher than expected. I’m afraid that I will only need one move to kill Master Sky Sword.”</p><p>The sword intent released by fifth step Destruction Sword Spirit was indeed too strong compared to ordinary Sword Spirits. It could already thoroughly affect the reality. Without any exaggeration, Ye Chen could kill martial artists with a will power of fourth step or lower without physically making a move. Just a strand of sword intent would be enough to destroy the opponent’s Sword Spirit. Furthermore, if Ye Chen became a Life and Death King, a strand of sword intent could directly destroy a Sea of Soul Master’s will, disregarding all defenses.</p><p>After all, Kings had much better methods of sword intent application compared to Ye Chen. Under comparable sword intents, Ye Chen would certainly lose against a Life and Death King.</p><p>“With the improvement in Sword Spirit, the might of Defensive Sword Art can also be increased by a lot.”</p><p>The might of Sword Control Art was reflected through four aspects: Zhen Yuan, profound, sword intent, and soul power. Among the four, the sword intent held a comparatively stronger influence, especially considering a fifth grade Destruction Sword Spirit. Soul power primarily affected the sword’s speed. Of course, under constant conditions, the higher the speed, the mightier would the sword be.</p><p>Huff!</p><p>Heavily letting out a breath, Ye Chen looked far into the distance, “Destruction Sword Spirit has already reached the fifth step. When will I be able to form the Immortal Sword Spirit?”</p><p>Destruction contained slaughter, so Destruction Sword Spirit could draw power from the Slaughter Sword Spirit. However, immortality and destruction were opposite to each other, and neither could draw power from another. However, it seemed that the Immortal Sword Spirit was harder to form than Destruction Sword Spirit. In other words, destruction was easier than creation.</p><p>Ye Chen had a premonition that the day his Immortal Sword Spirit and Destruction Sword Spirit reached true equilibrium, something unimaginable would occur.</p><p>…</p><p>In the Forbidden Region of South Rudra Sect, the energy whirlpool within the conveyor gate suddenly accelerated. After three breaths, a figure appeared, standing before the gate.</p><p>This person was none other than a Dragon God Celestial Palace elder.</p><p>Thump Thump!</p><p>Following heavy footsteps, Long Biyi appeared on the secret staircase.</p><p>“Eighteenth Elder!”</p><p>The eighteenth elder gently smiled and said, “Young miss, you’ve lost quite a bit of weight.”</p><p>Long Biyi sighed and said, “You are here for Ye Chen.”</p><p>“Indeed! Great Elder asked me to discuss with him.”</p><p>“Coincidentally, he also said some words for me to pass on. Since you’re here, you can discuss face to face. I’ll take you to Ye Residence.”</p><p>“Then I’ll trouble to lead the way.”</p><p>…</p><p>Before the two people arrived at Ye Residence, Ye Chen had already sensed them.</p><p>“Dragon God Celestial Palace Elder?” Ye Chen was able to guess the former’s identity through his attire. In the lake pavilion, he himself brewed some tea while waiting.</p><p>From a distance, eighteenth elder saw Ye Chen— a young man in blue robes with refined and elegant face inside the pavilion. On the table, steam from the brewing tea gently spiraled upwards, contrasting Ye Chen’s extremely calm temperament without a trace of fickleness. This was a hard quality to see in young men.</p><p>“Haha!” With a candid laugh, the eighteenth elder entered together with Long Biyi. “Ye Chen, we meet for the first time. I’m the palace’s eighteenth elder, surnamed Yu.” Eighteenth elder didn’t immediately sit down and instead introduced himself first.</p><p>Ye Chen stood up and gestured, “I’ve been awaiting your arrival for a long time. Elder Yu, please have a seat.”</p><p>The two parties sat down as Long Biyi said, “Ye Chen, eighteenth elder will discuss the situation of the palace with you, but the final decision is still in your hands.”</p><p>Ye Chen lightly sipped his tea and said directly, “We can discuss the situation upon reaching the palace.”</p><p>Hiccup!</p><p>Eighteenth elder was somewhat stunned. He glanced at Long Biyi and said, “Hearing is really different from seeing. Just based on these words, I have no choice but to re-evaluate you. Your conduct is direct, without any sloppiness and being unaffected of others’ opinion. Now I can understand how you could always be at the forefront in these years, finally becoming the first Sword Master in several hundred years.”</p><p>Ye Chen had deeply shocked the eighteenth elder. He was not some lone martial artist of martial world or an elder of some puny sect, but a member of the Elders Association of Dragon Gold Celestial Palace. He was proficient in seeing through people. However, he couldn’t completely see through Ye Chen. Anyways, he didn’t need to see through the latter. With one sentence from the latter, he could tell that Ye Chen was even more outstanding than he’d imagined.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “Elder Yu seldom has the opportunity to visit Ye Residence. Instead of discussing business, let’s enjoy some tea.”</p><p>“Good, enjoy tea!” Eighteenth Elder would naturally not say anything needlessly. On the side, Long Biyi smiled helplessly.</p><p>…</p><p>In the forbidden region of South Rudra Sect, Ye Chen and eighteenth elder stood before the conveyor gate.</p><p>“Young miss, we take our leave.” Eighteenth elder turned his head and said.</p><p>Long Biyi faintly nodded and turned to Ye Chen, “Ye Chen, be careful! Of all things, consider your safety as the most important. You should be very clear that your current worth far surpasses anything else.”</p><p>“I understand.” Ye Chen would obviously not let hot-headedness get the better of him.</p><p>“Well then, we’re leaving.” Eighteenth elder entered the gate, and Ye Chen followed behind him.</p><p>…</p><p>Dragon God Celestial Palace sat atop a huge island, which was like a small continent from Ye Chen’s previous world. Various constructions rose and fell in neat successions. In the middle of the island was a huge construct, and at its center was a huge dragon coiled around a magnificent palace. It gave off a majestic aura, shooting in the sky and even making the clouds unable to condense.</p><p>Ye Chen and eighteenth elder appeared in a small area located in the island’s core. Looking from outside, one wouldn’t be able to spot its features due to the mist coiling around it. It seemed like some scenery in heaven—spectacular and luxurious.</p><p>Walking out of the conveyor gate, the two arrived at a plaza.</p><p>On the plaza, multitudes of people could be seen moving to and fro. A large majority of the them was core disciples of the palace, and there were also a few attendants, as well as outer elders.</p><p>“Eighteenth Elder!”</p><p>“Hello, Eighteenth Elder!”</p><p>En-route, people would greet the eighteenth elder every now and then. The status of the member of Elders Association was not like that of an ordinary inner elder. As a fifth grade sect, Dragon Gold Celestial Palace had strict ranking system. Furthermore, there could be several sub-ranks within a rank. The status of Elders Association was a peak rank in the palace, as they handled all the affairs of the palace.</p><p>Eighteenth elder gently nodded back.</p><p>“Who is this guy? He seems so young?”</p><p>“Peak of mid Sea of Soul cultivation base, at most in the mid-twenties!”</p><p>“To make eighteenth elder personally accompany him, tsk…”</p><p>These people were not idiots. A young man capable of having the eighteenth elder personally accompany him could not be simple. Moreover, from the demeanor of Ye Chen and the elder, it was evident that the two had equal status, without a hint of difference in the rankings.</p><p>Ye Chen paid no attention to the gazes on him, and was just looking around. He had discovered that this huge region was shrouded by a powerful restriction. It was extremely frightening, since not even a trace of it could be seen, seeming as if hidden in the void.</p><p>He was quite astonished by the trees at the roadside. They were all rare breeds: mid grade Yew Woods, mid grade Dragonhead Trees, mid grade Evergreen Trees. Not even a single low grade tree or plant could be found. Moreover, the number of flowers in the flowerbeds was simply uncountable. Even the lowest of them were low grade, and mid grade were also not few in numbers.</p><p>Cultivating under these trees, the dense Yuan Qi would allow one to obtain double the results with half the effort. Moreover, these flowers could easily be refined into precious medicinal pills.</p><p>The graded trees and flowers needed high nutrients. Therefore, throughout the walk, Ye Chen would often see people watering trees and plants. This was, of course, not ordinary water: it was rich in organic energies. If one didn’t care about face, it would even be beneficial to drink it. If a small clan were to get their hands on it, they would absolutely not allow it to be wasted on plants.</p><p>Sucking in a cold breath, Ye Chen eventually understood the might of a fifth grade sect. The so-called sixth-grade sects were not even worth being mentioned before a fifth grade sect.</p><p>As he raised his head, he could see several sky-scraping trees in the depths of the palace. Due to the mist, he could only see a few nearby trees. But, even these few trees were all upper grade trees, countless times more precious than low grade plants. It should be known that in the market of vegetation, trees had the highest price, dozens or even hundreds of times more expensive than plants and shrubs.</p><p>“Ye Chen, how is the Dragon God Celestial Palace?” The eighteenth elder could see that Ye Chen was quite shocked.</p><p>Ye Chen said sincerely, “Much grander and more powerful than I imagined.”</p><p>“Dragon God Celestial Palace’s might and majesty is not these things you see on the surface. However, everything has a price. Since we are mighty and majestic, the resources we need are also huge. Once we can’t keep up with the resources, problems will start to crop up everywhere. Without any exaggeration, the resources palace requires is at least a hundred folds compared to a sixth grade sect. You can see it as the difference between Sea of Soul realm and Life and Death king.”</p><p>As long as a sixth grade sect gained a Life and Death King, they would immediately become an ordinary fifth grade sect. After developing for hundreds of years, they would then become mid fifth grade sect. However, to become a peak fifth grade sect like Dragon Gold Celestial Palace, it would require at least a thousand years.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
