He had been beaten and chased after for a whole three thousand meters, and his blade art tempo had been disturbed as well.</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>Xiao Chuhe had never looked this angry as both of his eyes went blood red. His whole body used the power of his long blade to jump back into the air, then threw out another blade attack toward Du Gujue who was standing in front of him.</p><p>“You have been covered in despair…There is nowhere for you to hide.” Du Gujue looked cold, and those grey pupils of his shone with a cold light as well. Xiao Chuhe’s features reflected in his eyes, drowned by that greyness.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>Lifting up his right arm and throwing out a blade attack, Xiao Chuhe backed out for a couple of hundred meters again. The clothes on his body had been torn apart already, revealing the shield underneath.</p><p>“The despairing blade art is indeed powerful!”</p><p>Although Ye Chen did not use elemental sword intent as the main focus of his training, he never thought that it was a bad path. One positive outcome of using the despairing blade intent as the core of his power was that the growth would be drastic and rapid in the beginning. All of the blade attacks created carried the despairing element, which coordinated everything perfectly. It would be able to explode all of the power from despair.</p><p>At the same time, Ye Chen’s sword art could also include a lot. Although its growth was not that fast or slow, it was always stable, which allowed him to control his power perfectly.</p><p>Hence, it would be too early to tell exactly which path to power was better. But, what was certain was that Ye Chen had not only not taken the path of the Battle Emperor, but neither that of the Sword King. As for the Double Sword King’s path, it would be even more impossible. Anyways, he had chosen to walk his own path.</p><p>Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!</p><p>Sparks were brought up in the air like bright fireworks. Wherever Du Gujue went, Xiao Chuhe would back out from there. At this stage, most of the people could tell that Xiao Chuhe had been completely controlled by Du Gujue, and the chance of him flipping over the situation would be greatly low.</p><p>Amongst everyone who was watching, one person shook his head and sighed, “It’s not that Xiao Chuhe is weak, it is actually Du Gujue being too powerful. Compared to one year ago, his power has at least increased by a couple times, while Xiao Chuhe’s growing speed was less than thirty percent. Therefore, Xiao Chuhe will lose for sure.”</p><p>“Oh wow, the top five young warriors are finally changing! Du Gujue is indeed a top martial genius! Even Xiao Chuhe would have to make ways for him.”</p><p>“Old generation young warrior meets the new top martial genius…I guess it would always be the newer being the better.”</p><p>Before everyone came here, no one had thought that Du Gujue would beat Xiao Chuhe and become the first person making into the top five. They all thought that even martial geniuses would need time to make their way up. They thought that no one could shake the top five young warriors’ positions within one to two years.</p><p>Unfortunately, they forgot that the reason that these top martial geniuses had been regarded as training monsters was that they could not be measured by normal standards. Plus, when they encountered powerful warriors, they would spark even more powerful potential. And for Du Gujue back then, Ye Chen was definitely his stimulant.</p><p>But of course, there were still people who thought Xiao Chuhe was going to win, and one of them said, “Do not forget that Xiao Chuhe still has his killing Ocean Breaker. Beiming Hui had lost to that before, so perhaps it would win against Du Gujue as well.”</p><p>People who supported Du Gujue argued against it said, “Do not forget that Du Gujue has still not performed his Despairing Sword yet. One year ago, he could still not control it fully. What about now? I guess we will see!”</p><p>Boom! Boom!</p><p>The surface of the lake had been shattered during the epic battle of the top two blade artists.</p><p>Finally, Xiao Chuhe performed his deadliest attack. His whole body stood on the waves, looking down at his opponent as he threw out three blade attacks. Three massive bright blade lights overlapped on top of each other, causing the climate to change within the Nine Dragon mountains. Wind blew heavily and waves rose one after another.</p><p>“You are powerful enough to make me use my Despairing Blade Attack.”</p><p>That despairing qi on Du Gujue’s body richened by a couple times and a cold breeze spread out while his hair suddenly turned white. In the deepest part of his left eye, a pale white flame was burning eerily. People that had been stared at by this eye could feel as if they had arrived in hell, and countless dead souls were attacking their souls.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The space in front of them suddenly blurred while Du Gujue’s figure disappeared suddenly from where he was standing.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Xiao Chuhe threw out a blade light, but it was easily shattered like foam. Then, a ghost like figure appeared right in front of him, throwing out a blade attack.</p><p>Under this blade attack of Du Gujue, Xiao Chuhe faced not him, but just pure despair. That defense of his was as weak as a piece of tofu as it was sliced into two halves. In the next second, that cold blade power followed his shield and entered into his body before coming out from the other side. That invisible blade pressure left a massive blade mark on the surface of the lake behind him.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>A huge amount of blood poured out of Xiao Chuhe’s mouth. It was like a little column made with blood connecting his mouth to the surface of the lake.</p><p>He wanted to move to avoid this attack, but his body was somehow no longer under his control. It seemed like he was not happy about losing to Du Gujue, Xiao Chuhe somehow grew a new power from that despair he was feeling, and wanted to throw out a blade attack toward Du Gujue, who was standing right in front of him.</p><p>But unfortunately, Du Gujue was faster than him, throwing another attack which blew him away into the air. He rolled a couple of times on top of the lake before losing his battling power and intent completely.</p><p>“Getting power from despair, huh? You can never win against me in that.”</p><p>If it were someone else, they might be beaten because of that last fightback, but it was Du Gujue, so such a thing would never happen. After all, the understanding he had in despair was beyond people’s imagination. Therefore, that last attempt of Xiao Chuhe was only child’s play to him.</p><p>“Xiao Chuhe lost! He really lost!”</p><p>“It has been five years now, give or take, right? Finally, someone rose up to compete and now dragged down a top warrior!”</p><p>Although some of them had thought about Xiao Chuhe losing, but when the result really came out, most of them were still shocked. A powerful warrior like Xiao Chuhe had lost to Du Gujue’s blade, so it would not be hard to imagine exactly how powerful Du Gujue had become. No warriors below forty years of age could really beat him now. Even if it were Bai Wuxue, it might still not happen.</p><p>“So powerful!”</p><p>Beiming Hui was brave enough to challenge Xiao Chuhe, but he realized that he would rather challenge anyone else than stand in front of Du Gujue. Getting power from despair and making his opponent drown in it was too scary for Beiming hui. Even if it were people with similar power as Du Gujuebut ninty-nine percent of them would probably lose nevertheless.</p><p>“Damn!”</p><p>Situ Hao was intimidated by Du Gujue as well, seeing that he had stopped his opponent from even thinking about fighting back.</p><p>“Brother Xie, how much confidence you have in fighting with him?” Xu Yuan suddenly asked Xie Baiting.</p><p>The latter forced a chuckle, “If it were another blade artist with similar power as him, probably fifty-fifty…But him? Forty-sixty tops…Me winning forty percent, and him sixty that is.”</p><p>“It seems that there is not much to be seen here anymore.” Xu Yuan nodded.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
