But, Ye Chen could sense that the Void Shattering Finger at seventy percent would only be able to use a shadow of the space profound. So, in other words, he would only be using the space power, but not really understanding it fully. It was like a house, and one could only use the materials inside the house, but it did not mean that one understood the whole structure of the house. There would be a massive difference between the two, and that would be the difference between a warrior who used the space power and one who actually understood it.</p><p>Cultivating the Void Shattering Finger Art to seventy percent would still be the former case. It was not hard to tell exactly how powerful this space profound was, and how hard it was to learn it.</p><p>“Xia Houzun’s Void Shattering Finger should be at about eighty percent… definitely not reaching over ninety percent. Right now, I cannot compete with him yet. But of course, the gap is not too big to reach cover. But for now, the power of my Gold Pattern will not be weaker than seventy percent of the Void Shattering Finger Art. Combined with the Destruction sword intent, it should be even more powerful than the Void Shattering Finger at eighty percent.”</p><p>When the Void Shattering Finger was at fifty percent, the Gold Resonant Radiance at one hundred percent already reached beyond it. Then, he reached one hundred and thirty percent with his Gold Resonant Radiance, which increased his power drastically. Even if it were still not as powerful as sixty percent Void Shattering Finger Art, it would not be that different.</p><p>After Ye Chen figured out his new sword movement, Gold Pattern, it had become his most powerful ace attack. After all, judging on power, Gold Pattern would be even twice as powerful as Gold Resonant Radiance at one hundred and thirty percent. Combined with the Destruction sword intent, it was just as powerful as eighty percent Void Shattering Finger Art, which was no exaggeration at all. Therefore, at the same cultivation level, Ye Chen’s peak attacking power would not be weaker than Xia Houzun’s.</p><p>Of course, Ye Chen had less time to train. If he had more time and managed to complete his Gold Pattern, then it would not be impossible for him to compete with the top five young warriors at peak level Mid Sea of Souls Realm.</p><p>Therefore, the bottom line was that he still had not had enough time to train yet, as did Du Gujue.</p><p>Opening his eyes, he came back to reality from his deep learning.</p><p>“Ye Chen, you learned something?” Murong Qingcheng knew that Ye Chen also trained the Void Shattering Finger Art.</p><p>Ye Chen nodded, “This trip was definitely worth it.”</p><p>“Haha, congratulations!”</p><p>In fact, Yan Fengfeng and Hai Wuya vaguely knew about it as well that there was some kind of connection between the finger art both Ye Chen and Xia Houzun used. It was only that they were still not one hundred percent sure about it yet, neither did they want to openly acknowledge it.</p><p>Looking over at the Nine Dragon Lake, Ye Chen asked, “Who won?”</p><p>Murong Qingcheng shook her head and said, “I have no idea frankly. Both Bai Wuxue and Xia Houzun had been wounded quite badly, but I think the former got the slight upper hand.”</p><p>“Yeah, I can tell.”</p><p>In Ye Chen’s sight, Bai Wuxue looked extra pale, and his mouth was covered in blood. Meanwhile, Xia Houzun was looking even worse. The clothes on his chest had been torn apart, revealing the protective armor underneath. His face was extremely pale, blood pouring out from everywhere, which was way worse than Bai Wuxue.</p><p>The question was, did Xia Houzun still have the power to compete?</p><p>The truth was that in such battles, the possibility of changing the situation was extremely high even at seemingly unlikely moments.</p><p>‘He! He! He!’</p><p>Opening his mouth and puking out another chunk of blood, Xia Houzun’s expression changed a couple of times as he eventually said slowly, “The Shield of Life… The Shield of Life…I did not expect to see you training your life profound to this level already.”</p><p>Bai Wuxue said lightly, “Right back at you. Your Star Nuclear Finger had almost won.”</p><p>“Yeah, I should have held on for a little bit longer.” Xia Houzun was slightly regretful of what he did. If he had held on for a little longer, Bai Wuxue’s remaining Zhen yuan would definitely not have been enough to perform another Arrow of Life again. But back then, it was such a critical moment, and the thought of wanting to make his opponent pay took over as well. But, it turned out to be a bad idea. Of course, he could secretly sense that even if he had endured for a bit longer, he might still not be able to win against his opponent for sure.</p><p>The only mistake he made was that he let off his guard slightly, which was why he was hit in the first place.</p><p>Epic battles like this would not tolerate slight distractions, which could cost the warrior the whole battle.</p><p>It was only after the conversation was heard by the crowd that the audience realized that Bai Wuxue had won the battle. But, what made them wonder was that since Xia Houzun was able to talk normally, he should still be able to fight. And if that were the case, why did he not, since he still might have a chance to win!</p><p>What they would not know was that the reason Xia Houzun was able to talk normally was not because he was not wounded badly. In fact, just those two sentences had worsened his internal wounds. That last Arrow of Life from Bai Wuxue contained an unbelievable amount of power which was not that weaker than the Void Shattering Finger Art.</p><p>“It seems like Bai Wuxue has won. But, Xia Houzun is not weak either. If they battle again, he might not lose again.”</p><p>“Yeah! Xia Houzun has a very potent defense. Unfortunately, he got slightly distracted, which led to the failure of catching the arrow and everything.”</p><p>“We cannot blame him for that though. In that condition, everyone would be slightly distracted. I guess Bai Wuxue is just too impressive.”</p><p>Everyone watching the battle chatted passionately.</p><p>“Haha! Such powerful warriors! Definitely worth being placed in front of this master level warrior ranking.”</p><p>It was right then that a bulky elder let out a bright laughter from a high mountain not so far away, saying something that shocked everyone.</p><p>“Master level warrior ranking? What is that?”</p><p>“I have not heard about it at all. Does it really exist secretly?”</p><p>“I do not think that is possible, right? Is there a ranking that even we do not know of? Let’s ask him first.”</p><p>“Hey, what is this ranking?” Someone asked.</p><p>The elder said with a loud voice, “I am the head master of the knowledge pavilion, Gao Changtian. This ranking did not exist before. Therefore, it is reasonable that none of you heard about it.”</p><p>“Oh? Do you guys even make rankings in the pavilion now?”</p><p>Gao Changtian looked around, having an excited look on his face as he said slowly, “As you all know, it is extremely hard to train to the Life and Death Realm. Perhaps ten warriors would make it each century, and twenty at tops…Sometimes, only seven or eight. However, there are countless powerful Sea of Souls Realm warriors out there in this world. But, unless they become Life and Death Realm king warriors, no one in the future would remember them once they died. How sad would that be? And how cruel?”</p><p>He cleared his throat and continued to say, “I know that although we as a pavilion have not existed for that long, it has still been eight hundred years. At the beginning of the pavilion, the leader and some of the elders had talked about writing a master level warrior ranking, but this whole land was just too massive, which would be almost impossible to imagine. With our power back then, we would not be able to finish it. Even if we managed to do so, no one would trust us back then.”</p><p>“After eight hundred years, our pavilion has finally grown to the peak level as we are now, and we have branches in the top ten cities as well. In each city, we have major or medium-sized data-collection institutions as well. We even have our people in the normal villages. Although the land is still massive, we now think we can finally finish this ranking that we always wanted to make, promising to list every top Sea of Souls Realm master level warrior that has ever lived, allowing people to think about them even after decades or centuries, remember the glory they had achieved.”</p><p>Gasp!</p><p>Hearing the man, everyone simultaneously gasped, including Xia Baiting, Bai Wuxue, and the others.</p><p>Listing every Sea of Souls Realm master level warriors was just as hard as it sounded, since there were so many hidden warriors in this world. Besides that, a ranking would be even harder to get done than tracking down every hidden warrior. It would be impossible to ask everyone who ever existed to join a gathering, then ask them to battle for rankings.</p><p>But of course, if this were going to happen, then only the Knowledge Pavilion had the most resources to do som since they were the No.1 agency in this land for information, which was something that no other institutions could compete with.</p><p>“How many people are in the ranking?”</p><p>Some of the master level warrior who thought they might have a shot could feel their breath hasten. They could already foresee the consequences of this ranking being released. It would definitely boil up the whole land. Being able to be listed in this ranking would mean that the warrior had both power and reputation, which would be the greatest honor ever. With that, no one would ever doubt one’s power.</p><p>Gao Changtian said, “The ranking would be focusing on quality rather than quantity. Therefore, there would be seventy-two slots, and would be changed annually. By then, we will write a book, which you can purchase in every city. Even if you never practiced a martial art or were ever a warrior, as soon as you buy this book, you will be able to know who the most powerful master warriors are in the world.”</p><p>“Such a great effort!” Even Ye Chen could not help but take a deep breath. He did not expect the pavilion to be this well-sourced. He did not think the pavilion had taken too much on their plate; otherwise, they would not have waited eight hundred years before attempting it.</p><p>“Once it is released, I think it would inspire master level warriors’ passion as well.” Murong Qingcheng said.</p><p>Ye Chen nodded, “This is certain, once it has been accepted, it will become this new thing on which people would start to judge each other. If you are not listed within, then the others will not acknowledge your power. Therefore, some of the warriors who do not accept challenges normally would not be able to do so anymore, unless he or she did not care about reputation. After all, if you did not do anything for decades, no one would know your true power. And the pavilion would have no way of knowing either .”</p><p>Someone suddenly asked, “Master Gao, before you just said that Bai Wuxue and Xia Houzun are qualified to be listed in the top. I wonder judging on what you have got so far, what kind of ranking are we talking about here?”</p><p>Hearing him, a curious expression flashed on the faces of a lot of people. They all had said that the top five young warriors were extremely powerful, and that there were not many people who could reach beyond them. But, if there were a more accurate ranking, it would definitely be a more discernable scenario.</p><p>Gao Changtian said, “Currently, I cannot be certain because the date we set for writing the ranking is October 10th. Although we had gathered a lot of information, it is still not perfect. But, judging on the information that I have so far, Bai Wuxue and Xia Houzun could definitely be ranked in the top fifty…perhaps even higher. Anyway, on October 10th, the first edition of the ranking will be released. By then, the seventy-two people on the ranking will be revealed.”</p><p>“It is in less than a month!”</p><p>“This Gao Changtian is definitely here for data collection. I should have shown my moves. Perhaps he would actually remember it and list me in that ranking.”</p><p>“Since they had been thinking about doing this for this long, they must have had a plan. As long as you have found yourself in a battle before in the past couple of years, they would have gotten you in their data. Of course, revealing your power now would definitely be better, since you would be slightly more powerful than before, right?”</p><p>Looking over at Xie Baiting, Gao Changtian laughed. “Xie Baiting, your power is well-recognized in this land. We have already listed you in the top fifty…Without any surprises, you will be in the top fifty even after we finish the compilation.” He continued speaking as he looked over at Ye Chen. “As the strongest warrior right under the top five warriors, Ye Chen, you are very likely to be in the ranking as well.”</p><p>Xie Baiting and Ye Chen smiled lightly without saying anything. But, they were actually really curious about this master level warrior ranking. Once the time came, they would buy one to see who they had guessed right.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
