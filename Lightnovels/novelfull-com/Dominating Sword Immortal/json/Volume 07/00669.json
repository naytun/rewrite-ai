Peak fourth step Slaughter Sword intent was more or less peak fifth step ordinary sword intent. Although it couldn’t compare to Destruction Sword Intent of the same level, when focused entirely on flesh and vitality, it was actually better than the Destruction Sword Intent.</p><p>Almost at the same time, Ye Chen’s forehead swelled slightly, and a strand of boundless Slaughter Sword Intent gushed out. Under its impact, the Elders Hall suddenly darkened as if numerous black holes had suddenly popped out, not allowing even the light to escape.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>As the two sword intent’s made contact, sounds of muffled explosions and cracks rang out in the void while the space warped slightly. Thereupon, under everybody’s watchful eyes, the chair beside second elder blasted into splinters. With a pale white face and lost expression, the second elder retreated three steps.</p><p>“Second elder!”</p><p>“Are you alright, second elder?”</p><p>Everybody’s face paled with fright.</p><p>“I’m fine!”</p><p>After two breaths, second elder stabilized himself, looking at Ye Chen with lingering fear. “This is destruction sword intent, a peak attributed sword intent!”</p><p>The second elder had bountiful knowledge and experience, and could the attribute of the sword intent at a glance.</p><p>Ye Chen knew that the former was testing him. Thus, he had used the same level of Destruction Sword Intent. Moreover, he immediately restrained it upon releasing, meaning only to defend. However, even so, since the essence of Destruction Sword Intent was higher, the Slaughter Sword Intent couldn’t contend with the Destruction Sword Intent.</p><p>“You let me win.” Pulling back his Destruction Sword Intent, Ye Chen spoke calmly.</p><p>“Good! Seems like I, Liu Wusheng, have kicked an iron wall this time. Worthy of being the continent’s first Sword Master in centuries. Seems like even I, Silver Sword, am not worthy enough to be in your eyes.” The second elder heartily laughed with a face full of admiration and amazement.</p><p>Ye Chen smiled faintly without replying. The former’s strength was somewhat lacking compared to Master Sky Sword. Thus, if he showed modesty, it would seem too fake, and if he admitted directly, it could easily lead the former to harbor some resentment. Therefore, not speaking was the best option.</p><p>“I was worried a little before, but it seems now that my worries were unfounded. You alone are equal to more than a few Sea of Soul realm experts. As for holding you down, I’m afraid it will take dozens of Sea of Soul realm experts and hundreds of Astral Reaching experts to do that.”</p><p>The second elder’s evaluation of Ye Chen was extremely high. He could tell that Ye Chen had stayed his hand just now. As for how strong the latter’s sword intent was, he couldn’t see its depths. However, he knew it was certainly not low. His intuition was telling him that the latter’s sword intent might have exceeded the fourth step and reached the fifth step. But, his reason didn’t let him believe. It simply didn’t seem possible, because the difficulty of raising the Destruction Sword Intent was too high. Even if it weren’t as hard as raising an ordinary sword intent to sixth step, it was not far off.</p><p>One equaled to ten—this was a figure of speech, implying one fighting against many by employing guerrilla warfare tactics.</p><p>If the second elder were to find out Ye Chen’s true strength, one would have to fear for his chin falling to the ground. Without the Defensive Sword Art, even if Ye Chen had raised his Destruction Sword Intent to the fifth step, he could at most contend against a few dozen enemies, and he still would have to rely on guerrilla tactics. After all, his speed couldn’t let him escape dozens of combined attacks, and neither would his defense be able to keep up. Regardless of how high his offensive power was, it would only help his killing efficiency.</p><p>However, with the Defensive Sword Art, Ye Chen could fight from several hundred li away, picking off enemies one by one. In theory, he would be able to kill until his Zhen Yuan or Soul Power dried up. Of course, opponents were no idiots. Once they couldn’t locate the source, they would immediately band together and combine their defenses together. In that case, the sword art might not be as effective. After all, the combined defenses of a dozen experts couldn’t be breached by one person.</p><p>For the time being, Ye Chen decided not to reveal the Defensive Sword Art. A good steel should be used on the knife’s edge. He would kill enough first time to break even, as his own strength was more than enough for it. One on one, even Sky Sword Master wouldn’t be able to take a few moves from him. As long as a half-step King didn’t appear, he would be unrivaled.</p><p>“Haha…Second elder, it seems like you approve of Ye Chen.” The speaker was the blunt thirteenth elder who hadn’t spoken until now.</p><p>The second elder didn’t take offense and nodded, “Of course, I accept! How can I not? Seeing is believing. Everyone here can see Ye Chen’s strength, so I have no choice but to accept.”</p><p>“Alright! Everybody take your seats! Grand Elder is about to arrive.” Observing the scene, third elder inwardly nodded and said. Hearing these words, everybody sat down one after another. Ye Chen took the seat beside eighteenth elder as well.</p><p>Soon afterward, the grand elder arrived. He didn’t have the second elder’s sharp edge, or the third elder’s majestic countenance. He seemed like a normal old man. However, as soon as he entered, the hall immediately quieted down.</p><p>Great Elder stood before the table and swept his gaze. As his gaze passed across Ye Chen, he faintly nodded with a gentle expression.</p><p>“Since everybody is here, let’s begin!” Saying that, Great Elder took his seat.</p><p>Third Elder waited as the former took his seat, then said to Ye Chen, “I’m gratified that you decide to come. But first and foremost, I’ll remind you again that this time’s sect war is extremely dangerous. It will not be as simple as you think. I personally am against you participating.”</p><p>“That’s right! Your presence is not indispensable. A single individual’s strength can’t have a critical effect in a sect war. Even though you’re powerful, you won’t be able to affect the general situation. We might have to bear the responsibility of your downfall for the sake of preserving a few troops.”</p><p>If the palace was not in such a perilous situation—their four enemies firmly and steadily gaining advantage–there was not a single elder in the association willing to have Ye Chen come over, not even the eighteenth elder. Therefore, they were in quite an awkward situation. On one hand, they were hoping to use Ye Chen’s absolute battle power to gradually recover, or at least ease the tension. However, on the other hand, they didn’t wish to send him into danger.</p><p>Ye Chen felt a trace of warmth. Whether these elders had taken a fancy to him due to his talent or they had some other line of thinking, it was enough that they truly cared and didn’t wish for him to take risks. This was the third power Ye Chen approved of after Ye family and Sky Cloud Sect.</p><p>Sweeping his gaze, Ye Chen took all their faces into his eyes and spoke,” I, Ye Chen, have walked through dangers through my entire life. Regardless of how dangerous a sect war is, it doesn’t make a difference to me. Moreover, I don’t dare claim that I can seize victory, but I can keep myself alive. I believe that after this time’s sect war, my strength will keep on increasing. However, if I sit back and do nothing when the palace is facing danger, my mental state will face obstruction.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s sword dao was just and straightforward. If he received other’s favor, he naturally had to repay it. Most importantly, he never deliberately avoided danger. Only if the danger was far beyond his ability would he try to mull over the most effective solution.</p><p>Moreover, in reality, as long as the Dragon King didn’t reappear, Dragon Celestial Palace would be put in an increasing danger. Perhaps it wasn’t the case at present, but it would happen sooner or later.</p><p>But, once the Dragon King came out of seclusion, everything would be solved naturally.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
