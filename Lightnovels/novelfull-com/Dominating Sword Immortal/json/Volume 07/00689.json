This island seemed like a scorpion and also a fork confronting Blood Battle Ocean. Due to its shape, the island was named Scorpion King Island. It was a common island for all the four prime forces. This island served only one purpose- to assemble the troops of all the four forces together to contend with Dragon God Celestial Palace.</p><p>At this moment, inside a huge hall, the hall leaders of the four forces were having a fierce discussion. The atmosphere inside the hall was stifling.</p><p>“Fucker, he killed seven hundred people of my Sky Eagle Cult. We absolutely refuse to swallow this. That kid must pay this debt in blood.”</p><p>“Your cult lost seven hundred people, but the loss of my Water Wave Sect is not less either, even my uncle was viciously killed.”</p><p>“Enough, we’re not here to whine about our losses, but to think of a method to get rid of that kid. As long as we get rid of him, Azure Dragon Hall will become a toothless tiger. It will no longer pose any trouble.” The leader of Black King Gate’s hall leader was a black-robed grim-faced man.</p><p>“In my opinion, that kid has the ability to seek fortune in calamity and is able to sense danger. Thus, all schemes are useless. Only in a direct fight will we have a chance to thoroughly crush him and get rid of him.”</p><p>Whirlwind Gate’s hall leader calmly said.</p><p>“You’re saying to kill him not using schemes but strength?”</p><p>Water Wave Sect’s hall leader was a green-robed old man.</p><p>“Correct.”</p><p>The hall turned silent for a moment, before Black King Gate’s leader spoke,”I agree.”</p><p>“I agree.”</p><p>“Since you three agree, my opposing has no meaning; agreed.”</p><p>Whirwind Gate’s hall leader was over five decades old. He had long hair and long mustache. His pupils were unusually long and narrow. A cold light was flickering in the corner of his eye, emitting a powerful pressure. He was the hall leader of one of Whirldwind Gate’s three halls, Yin Wind Hall, and his name was He Lengji. His strength had long since reached the peak of Master grade. Seeing the other three leaders agreeing, he said,”Although no schemes, we need to think of a strategy to insure that kid doesn’t escape our grasp. After all, he has the ability to sense danger.”</p><p>Water Wave Sect’s green-robed old man said,”His ability to sense danger surely has a range, and my guess is that it’s not too big. As long as one party keeps his interest, three other parties can cut all of his escape routes, not much trouble at all.”</p><p>The green-robed old man was much older than the other three hall leaders. Be it schemes or battle strategies, he could come up with them with a snap of his fingers.</p><p>Sky Eagle Sect’s hall leader, a middle-aged with long-pointed nose, said,”Then who will attract his attention?”</p><p>“There is no need to force such a matter. Anybody can volunteer- whoever attracts his attention will have his side receive half of the kill counts and resources of the entire operation.”</p><p>He Lengji said.</p><p>“Half of riches and kill counts?”</p><p>The eyes of other three hall leaders brightened.</p><p>The resources that were worthy of being escorted by Ye Chen in person must be abundant. However, each side would only obtain twenty-five percent. If one side could obtain half of it, just the contribution points from the sect would be extremely high. With sufficient contribution points, one could then convert into the precious resources they desired and could easily get their hands on supreme spirit stones, half-supreme grade pills, which were things that sects normally would be reluctant to part with.</p><p>“I’ll do it.”</p><p>The Sky Eagle Cult’s hall master resolved.</p><p>“Elder Brother Zhou, you will attract his attention?”</p><p>“It’s just keeping him occupied, no? Is it really something to make a fuss about? I refuse to believe that he can do anything to me. As far as strength goes, he hasn’t shown an overwhelming amount.” The losses of Sky Eagle Cult were too grave, and a lot people in Elder’s Association were creating trouble for him. The pressure on him had increased a lot. It should be known that although the battle in Blood Battle Ocean against Azure Dragon Hall carried a risk, it was an extremely good job. Other hall leaders had always been eyeing his position. If he can’t produce satisfactory results for the higher-ups, he might end up losing this job.</p><p>Of course, the most important reason was that they feared Ye Chen’s ability to sense danger and not his individual strength. Of course, his strength was still top notch and at the forefront of peak Masters. However, this battle was not one on one.</p><p>“Good, since elder brother Zhou has volunteered, we’ll succeed beautifully.”</p><p>The three sides were excited, but also a bit apprehensive.</p><p>————</p><p>The assignments of transporting resources from Blood Battle Ocean were too common. Not to mention the thousand spirit veins under the control of Dragon God Celestial Palace, merely the rare ores, jewels, and energy crystals were aplenty. Of course, if the quantity of target resources was not much or their quality was too low, there was no need for a figure like deputy to get personally involved. As long as some attendants or head attendant oversaw the transportation, it would be enough. Such unremarkable transportations rarely suffered ambushes, as it would merely increase the casualties on both sides.</p><p>Ordinary speaking, there would be a small batch of resources carried back to the hall every three days. A medium sized batch occurred once a month, while a large assignment, which required the involvement of deputy, occurs once in three months. For example, Ye Chen’s assignment last time.</p><p>Today, there was another big assignment.</p><p>The target was transporting resources from Azure Spirit Island, which was one of the most important island’s under Dragon God Celestial Palace. It had a spirit vein. This spirit vein was a normal upper-grade spirit vein, worth dozens of peak mid-grade spirit veins.</p><p>Needless to say, all three deputies- Xu Danian, Wu Chuan, and Ye Chen would be mobilized.</p><p>Late at night, Ye Chen didn’t rest, and instead went to Yao Yifeng’s residence. Outside, he used Doppelganger Image Transformation Technique and vanished into the darkness.</p><p>He spread out his soul power, covering every bit of the entire building complex. Even the blowing wind and moving grass couldn’t escape his perception.</p><p>Inside a secret room, Yao Yifeng had just picked up the snail artifact.</p><p>“This time, I want half supreme grade bottle of Marrow Cleansing Elixir, and half supreme grade Blood Tempering Pill.”</p><p>The other side went silent momentarily before replying,”What is the assignment this time? How many people will be mobilized?”</p><p>“This time’s assignment is to extract spirit stones from a normal upper grade spirit vein. The number of people mobilized will be more than a thousand.”</p><p>“That Ye Chen is included?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Good! I agree.”</p><p>“Many thanks.”</p><p>Yao Yifeng’s face revealed a joyful expression.</p><p>There was no reply from the other side. Yao Yifeng turned off the Snail Artifact.</p><p>“With half supreme grade Marrow Cleansing Elixir and Blood Tempering pill, my constitution will further improve. Ye Chen, oh Ye Chen, although you won’t die by my hands, it’s the same as me killing me. You can only blame for shining too brightly.”</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>A voice came from outside.</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Yao Yifeng’s face turned pale.</p><p>Puchi!</p><p>The secret room was made a special metal and was extremely sturdy. However, at this moment, a sword light flickered, and the room was cut through like tofu, opening an entrance.</p><p>Swish!</p><p>A figure rushed in.</p><p>“Ye Chen!”</p><p>Yao Yifeng was shocked to the core.</p><p>“It’s me. Didn’t expect you are the mole.”</p><p>“What proof do you have?”</p><p>Yao Yifeng recovered at once and gloomily said.</p><p>Ye Chen indifferently smiled. He then sucked in a deep breath and projected his voice with Zhen Yuan,”Everyone, Yao Yifeng is the mole and has been captured by me.”</p><p>“Ye Chen, you dare!”</p><p>Yao Yifeng was extremely furious.</p><p>“Don’t you think I have no proof? What are you afraid of?”</p><p>“Humph! You dare frame me, I’ll make you pay!” Yao Yifeng fiercely said.</p><p>Soon after, Xu Danian, Wu Chuan, and even the hall leader Wei Longtao arrived and entered the secret room one after another.</p><p>“Ye Chen, you said Yao Yifend is the traitor, do you have proof?” Wei Longtao expressionlessly said.</p><p>Chi!</p><p>Ye Chen was ruthless. With a flick of his finger, sword Qi shot out and severed Yao Yifeng’s arm. Blood splattered while Ye Chen made a pulling motion, and the arm flew over, dropping the storage ring on Ye Chen’s hands.</p><p>“Ye Chen, you dared to cut my arm, I’ll kill your whole family!”</p><p>Yao Yifeng never expected Ye Chen to be so vicious and cut off his hand without any evidence, and thus, immediately roared with resentment.</p><p>Wu Chuan and Xu Danian were somewhat shaken.</p><p>A cold expression flickered in Wei Longtao’s eyes,”Ye Chen, although your status is very high, I can still punish you for framing and injuring your comrade.”</p><p>“Whether I’m framing him or not, everyone will soon know.” Without wasting any effort, Ye Chen easily destroyed Yao Yifeng’s soul imprint in the ring, and poured his own soul power in. After searching for a bit, he took out a snail-shaped metal artifact.</p><p>“Sound Transmitting Snail!”</p><p>Xu Danian blurted out.</p><p>Wu Chuan fiercely glared at Yao Yifeng and said,”Yao Yifeng, where did you get this?” Sound Transmitting Snail was precious than ten half supreme grade artifacts, and the method of its refining had already been lost. Even some Life and Death Kings didn’t possess it, much less to say of Yao Yifeng.</p><p>Yao Yifeng restrained his pain and gnash his teeth,”Why is it so strange for me to have a Sound Transmitting Snail? Everybody has their own fortune. I found this from a runis.”</p><p>“Noisy.”</p><p>Ye Chen opened the device, and instilled Zhen Yuan with particular frequencies, like a secret code- suddenly long then suddenly short, sometimes strong and sometimes weak. Immediately afterwards, a faint radiance appeared on the snail, and a small energy whirlpools appeared at the snail’s mouth.</p><p>“Reverse!”</p><p>As Ye Chen poured his Zhen Yuan, the energy whirlpools started to whirl in reverse.</p><p>“Many thanks.”</p><p>“Good! I agree.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“That Ye Chen is included?”</p><p>“This time’s assignment is to extract spirit stones from a normal upper grade spirit vein. The number of people mobilized will be more than a thousand.”</p><p>“What is the assignment this time? How many people will be mobilized?”</p><p>——— –</p><p>The voices of Yao Yifeng’s conversation were transmitted by the snail, but in the reverse order.</p><p>“How can you know the method to open the Sound Transmitting Snail?”</p><p>Yao Yifeng’s eyeballs almost popped out along with bulging veins on his entire face.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
