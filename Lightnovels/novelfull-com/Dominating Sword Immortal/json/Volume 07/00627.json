Also, while he was beating Tai Shichong, Du Gujue himself was seriously wounded internally as well.</p><p>However, it was different this time. Facing Luo Haisong who was way more powerful than Tai Shichong, Du Gujue had only used ten attacks to beat him completely while not being wounded at all, not even getting a scratch.</p><p>Everyone was shocked by this result, and extremely impressed with Du Gujue’s learning ability at the same time, which allowed him to make this drastic improvement within half a year.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside a medium-sized city in Sky Martial Region, Ling Feng City…</p><p>In a massive VIP room inside the Ling Feng restaurant, dozens of rather good-looking young men were drinking and chatting. Amongst all of them, a young man in silver robes stood out as the most outstanding one.</p><p>The young man had his long hair tied up in a high ponytail with silver accessories. His face looked like it was made with jade while his eyes were cold as snow. His eyebrows were narrow and long, dragging all the way back into his hair like a pair of flood dragons in the sky. He looked rather intimidating, giving people the feeling that but he might attack at any time even though he was not mad.</p><p>On the long table right next to him was a bright silver long spear. The spear had a silver flood dragon around it, with the head of the dragon spitting out the tip, looking extra scary.</p><p>“Brother Beiming, everyone is talking about it now that you have chased after Lan Xieqing and his warriors for hundreds of thousands miles all the way until they ran back to their own Martial institutions. It seems like your reputation has already spread into the Sky Martial Region. Soon, I think it will spread across the whole continent now.” One of them said to the young man in silver robes.</p><p>Another person added, “If it were not because our Beiming brother is really humble and does not want to show his power, always staying inside the Mysterious Martial Region, how could those arrogant young warriors become so reckless? Brother Beiming is going to do it once and everyone will know about him.”</p><p>“Yeah! I think only our Beiming brother can replace those top five young warriors’ position…The others will just have to step aside.”</p><p>The young warrior in silver was indeed Beiming Hui who got extremely famous recently. He was twenty-eight years old now, and was the eldest son of the Beiming family inside the Mysterious Martial Region. He trained the long spear ever since he was young, bringing out the potential of his power. He had even created his own powerful spear attack, the Sky’s End, which he had only used once to beat Lan Xieqing.</p><p>A light smile revealed on his face as Beiming Hui said lightly, “The so-called top young warriors are only some nobodies. They cannot even make me use all of my power.”</p><p>Lan Xieqing was only a clown in his eyes. In his opinion, he was only slightly older than him, with slightly more well-known reputation; there was nothing special other than that.</p><p>“Beiming brother, although he is a nobody, that Du Gujue is still really powerful after all. I heard that he had beaten Luo Haisong, who was just as famous as Lan Xieqing, on top of the Bei Yan river with only ten attacks. On the tenth attack, he had even split the river in half!”</p><p>There would always be someone trying to pay compliments while some other people would have to give out warnings.</p><p>Hearing the name, Beiming Hui took back his smile. He knew that Du Gujue was nothing Lan Xieqing could compare with.</p><p>“Huh! Brother Lan, are you trying to talk our opponent up? Although he is one of the warriors with the most potential, if it took him ten attacks to beat Luo Haisong, then he is not that powerful after all. After all, Beiming brother had only used seven when he beat Lan Xieqing.” Someone talked back.</p><p>“There is no comparison. Half a year ago, Du Gujue had used a self-harming attack on top of Nine Dragon Lake and managed to beat Tai Shichong. Right now, his power has grown, and he will be able to beat Luo Haisong without even trying. Could you imagine what would happen if he used that attack again?”</p><p>The other man struggled to find words to counter that point. Everyone knew about what happened on top of the Nine Dragon Lake. That attack of Du Gujue’s was indeed horrifying!</p><p>Beiming Hui said, “Du Gujue should indeed not be underestimated. If chance allows, I will battle with him. I would like to witness his so-called power for myself.”</p><p>The northern region was basically run by the Barbarians. Although the Beiming family was a rank 5 family, and there were Life and Death Realm king level warriors guarding it, it would still be nothing compared to the Barbarian race. Luckily, although the latter did not enjoy the human race’s company, they would still not kill them without a reason. Beiming Hui knew about their power as he grew up. Therefore, he had never stopped trying, continuously working to improve his power. To him, no matter who it was, he would surpass him or her.</p><p>Hearing him, everyone was a bit confused. After spending time together for so long, they all knew that although he did not look like he ever cared about something and was always calm, he was very competitive inside. Without confidence, he would definitely not go challenge Du Gujue, since even though the former had that extremely powerful fatal attack, he also had his killing spear attacks as well. As for having one hundred percent confidence, it would be impossible; everyone was so powerful after all, and growing at the same time as well.</p><p>Beiming Hui could tell what everyone was thinking, so he chuckled. “Before battling with Du Gujue, I will battle Ye Chen first.”</p><p>What!</p><p>That line seemed to have sparked some emotions. Everyone looked back at him with confusion in their eyes.</p><p>“Brother Beiming, do not do anything you will regret. Half a year ago, even Du Gujue would not dare to compete with Ye Chen, and made a one year promise. If it were me, I would challenge Du Gujue before challenging Ye Chen first.”</p><p>No one dared to underestimate Ye Chen’s power, not even those people who were paying compliments to Beiming Hui, considering the fact that only Ye Chen had been ranked into the master level warrior ranking besides the top five young warriors. With this kind of reputation and power, it was a huge mountain that had been pressing onto all those young warriors’ hearts.</p><p>“Yeah! Ye Chen would be trickier to take on than Du Gujue. Right now, it is still not time yet!”</p><p>Everyone there could not understand why Beiming Hui would want to challenge Ye Chen first. Normally, Beiming Hui should know of Ye Chen’s power.</p><p>He said lightly, “Of course I have my reasoning for wanting to challenge Ye Chen first.” Waiting for a second, he continued to speak, “Let me ask you this…Du Gujue had that powerful attack, so what does Ye Chen have?”</p><p>Everyone seemed to start to understand what he meant.</p><p>He then continued to speak, “Indeed Ye Chen had been more powerful than Du Gujue half a year ago, but right now is not that time. Du Gujue seems to have caught up with him. Even though his general power might not be as great as Ye Chen’s, but as long as he performed that horrifying attack of his, it would be rather possible for him to win. Plus, Ye Chen might not have made that much progress in the last six months. Perhaps his general power is only even with Du Gujue. Then, he would definitely lose once that attack was used. And my attack would beat him as well.”</p><p>Beiming hui knew it clearly that with his current power, he would have about fifty-fifty confidence at winning against Du Gujue. Therefore, it would not make sense for him to challenge him; if he won, it would not have made that big of compact, but if he lost, then he might even help the other achieve a more powerful aura.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ye Chen had not been seen for half a year now, so no one really knew about his power anymore. Anyway, Beiming Hui thought the other would not have made that big of a progress, so the chance of him winning would be higher than against Du Gujue.</p><p>“But, Ye Chen is still ranked at least 48th!” Someone shouted out.</p><p>Beiming Hui laughed lightly, “Remember, this is a ranking made half a year ago. Right now, we will have to wait for the new ranking.”</p><p>…</p><p>Chu Zhongtian had spent some time inside the Sky Martial Region before heading back to southern regions. Out of the blue, he had an idea to check out the South Rudra Region.</p><p>Out of the top four warriors inside the southern regions, he was the last to reach the Sea of Souls Realm, with Ye Chen being the first, and Jing Aoxuan and Li Xiaoyun being the second.</p><p>Of course, right now, he had already reached beyond Jing Aoxuan and Li Xiaoyun, which was right below Ye Chen. Therefore, he wanted to see exactly how powerful Ye Chen had become, and exactly how big the gap was. However, he had not decided whether he wanted to meet up with Ye Chen and challenge him. However, he knew that he would never know that gap without challenging it.</p><p>“Ah! Whatever! I will go check it out first!”</p><p>Accumulating his evil yuan, Chu Zhongtian increased his speed to its limit, turning into a dark red beam of falling star and slicing through the sky before disappearing completely.</p><p>Flying on top of Star Regional Lake, Chu Zhongtian frowned slightly as he turned his head to look.</p><p>Over in the southeast direction, beams of light flew over toward the South Rudra Region. The leading man was a young man in silver, wearing a long spear on his back. That group of men behind him were not weak either. At least in Chu Zhongtian’s eyes, some of them were even more powerful than Jing Aoxuan and Li Xiaoyun.</p><p>“A young man in silver robes with long silver spear… Is he that Beiming Hui who recently got famous? Why are they going to the South Rudra Region?”</p><p>Chu Zhongtian had not realized it that these people had come for Ye Chen.</p><p>“Never mind! They do whatever they want to do. I will go on my own way.” Chu Zhongtian did not think that they were heading the same way.</p><p>Flying over Star Regional Lake, Chu Zhongtian flew right at Murong Qingcheng’s mountains, since it was very close to where he was. If Ye Chen were already there, then he could save a lot of time in trying to find him. If he were not there, then he could just go to the Ye family in the Windy Nation, which was not that far down either.</p><p>But, what was shocking for Chu Zhongtian was that Beiming Hui and the group were also heading toward the Murong family, and they had already noticed him.</p><p>“They are not looking for Ye Chen, are they?” Chu Zhongtian was a bit surprised.</p><p>He did not think that Beiming Hui was going to simply visit the other, since he had never heard that Ye Chen and him were friends. With this potential reasoning down, there was only one reason left.</p><p>Beiming Hui challenging Ye Chen would be something he would like to see, because he would be able to learn about the power difference between him and Ye Chen from it.</p><p>Beiming Hui was going for a challenge, or at least a small exchange of attacks.</p><p>A smile appeared on Chu Zhongtian’s face. Earlier on, he was stressing out of the fact that he did not know Ye Chen’s real power. But, he did not expect to see this problem being solved this quickly. Judging from current situation, Chu Zhongtian also knew that he was not an opponent for Beiming Hui or Du Gujue, but he was not in a hurry. He had only reached the Sea of Souls Realm recently. Right now, he was just starting to pick up the pace. Therefore, all he needed to know now exactly how big the power gap between him and Ye Chen was.</p><p>“I think this trip is definitely worth it.” Chu Zhongtian followed right behind the group, maintaining ten miles of distance in between.</p><p>The people behind Beiming Hui noticed Chu Zhongtian and said, “Brother Beiming, this guy is following us. Should we take care of him?”</p><p>Beiming Hui answered, “Do not do anything unnecessary. I am going to challenge Ye Chen, I have no interest in him. If he wants to come, then we will have one extra audience. Why not?”</p><p>This time, his challenge to Ye Chen was a secret, and only the people around him knew about it happening. With Chu Zhongtian as a third party there, it would not necessarily be a bad thing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
