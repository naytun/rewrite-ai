His Zhen Yuan was pushed to the peak, and a green glow covered his long blade. The long blade seemed weightless in his hand, flickering indefinitely.</p><p>Without unsheathing his sword, Ye Chen walked toward the other step-by-step. His every step covered the same distance, seeming as if he was using a ruler. His gaze looked down upon Li Feng, carrying the look of an emperor strolling in his garden—be it rain or sunshine, or thousands of troops, he could take his enemy’s head at his will.</p><p>“Arrogant.”</p><p>Li Feng was infuriated by Ye Chen’s demeanor. The latter had neither drawn his sword nor adopted a battle stance. Did he think of him as a fish on a meat board, ready to be chopped at his will?</p><p>“Two Extreme Wind Blades!”</p><p>With a flicker of blade light, Li Feng pounced on Ye Chen’s walking figure. The seemingly weightless long blade generated a green light screen which danced following the blade’s swift movements. The dust and stones around Ye Chen converged together. It seemed as if two opposing magnetic fields had converged on the blade, closing off the opponent’s movements and pulling them toward the blade’s tip within a tightly weaved trap.</p><p>Relying on this move, Li Feng had defeated several Masters with more or less the same strength as him. Using it against Ye Chen, he didn’t intend to win. He merely wished to not lose, and perhaps, make him suffer a little.</p><p>“Not drawing sword before Second Brother…I’m afraid it’s too late now even if he wants to.” A spectating disciple muttered.</p><p>Chen Yuxin’s brows slightly, thinking something.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>But, an astonishing scene occurred. Confronting Li Feng’s powerful blade strike, Ye Chen extended his finger and pointed. This finger move was not the Void Shattering Finger, but merely a finger move. However, it contained a frightening Destruction Sword Intent. Although Li Feng’s blade was extremely fast, it was incapable of hiding from Ye Chen’s fingertip. The fingertip touched the middle of the blade.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>An enormous power transmitted into Li Feng’s hands from his blade, which flew out in the sky while spinning. In the next moment, Ye Chen appeared before Li Feng. His fingertip, like a hot knife cutting through tofu, crushed the latter’s Zhen Yuan and resolutely pounded on his defensive armor.</p><p>Creak Creak!</p><p>Metal crunching sounds resounded, following which, Li Feng spurted out a mouthful of blood and fell head first. The leather armor on his chest had completely shattered while his inner armor had a clear finger imprint, and the region at its edges was slightly warped.</p><p>One finger, Li Feng’s miserable defeat!</p><p>Looking down on Li Feng, Ye Chen said indifferently, “You can’t even resist a fingertip. What qualifications do you have to question my means?”</p><p>Dragon God Celestial Palace disciples were dumbstruck!</p><p>The powerful and courageous Second Brother couldn’t even resist Ye Chen’s fingertip. His blade was in the sky, and he was lying on the ground. It looked like a grown-up poking a youngling who had just begun to understand the world. The youngling could only lie on the ground, unresigned and without any ability to resist.</p><p>Second brother struck down by just a finger. Was this for real?</p><p>“How deep does this guy’s strength go in the end?”</p><p>At this moment, a scene was playing in the mind of every Dragon God Celestial Palace. Ye Chen strolling toward Li Feng, and the latter striking with his utmost, only to have his blade sent flying in the sky and then falling down while spurting a mouthful of blood by just a mere finger.</p><p>Chen Yuxin covered her small mouth and whimpered like a kitten, “Too strong, terrifyingly strong! Grandfather was right…he is above all the geniuses in the continent. Even when it comes to the Eastern Shallow Ocean, nobody can compare to him. We’re probably like children before him, acting presumptuous and self-righteous.”</p><p>In Chen Yuxin’s eyes, Ye Chen’s body seemed to be glowing with a dazzling splendor as he looked down on Li Feng, tall and aloof like the great sun. The latter had been beaten back to his true appearance, like a firefly under the sun, as insignificant as a speck of dust.</p><p>“The difference is too big!” A trace of worship unwittingly appeared in Chen Yuxin’s gaze on Ye Chen.</p><p>“Impossible, this is impossible!”</p><p>Li Feng couldn’t believe that he’d been defeated, moreover by a fingertip. He seemed to find himself in a nightmare which he couldn’t wake up from. He saw the other disciples’ dumbfounded expressions and Chen Yuxin’s admiring gaze on Ye Chen, and his expression suddenly sobered up, replaced by shame, fury, and resentment. His face turned red and green. The gasps of amazement coming from beside sounded like voices of humiliation in his ears, repeating over and over.</p><p>“Ye Chen, you’ve gone too far.” Li Feng roared.</p><p>Ye Chen looked coldly at him, “I warned you from the beginning to shut your mouth if you don’t want to bring calamity to yourself. It’s a pity that you didn’t pay any heed to it. Your present situation is completely your own fault. What does it have to do with me?’</p><p>“B*stard!”</p><p>Erecting his right hand as a blade, Li Feng chopped at Ye Chen. This palm contained his boundless fury, and its might even somewhat surpassed his blade strike before.</p><p>Unfortunately, his speed was too slow in Ye Chen’s eyes. He only needed to hit the former before getting hit.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Without any intention of preserving courtesy, Ye Chen smashed his palm onto Li Feng’s forehead, immediately knocking him out. For this kind of person who couldn’t differentiate between good and bad for himself, Ye Chen didn’t have to leave him any face at all. Leaving face for the latter was the same as slapping one’s own face.</p><p>“Let’s go!” Ye Chen turned towards Chen Yuxin and said.</p><p>Faintly nodding, Chen Yuxin instructed a few disciples, “You guys help second brother.”</p><p>Before leaving, she helplessly glanced at the fainted Li Feng, then snuck a glance at Ye Chen and said inwardly, “Brother Ye seems gentle, but that is only when is not angry. When angry, he is even more terrifying than Eldest Brother.”</p><p>Mounting on the flying boat, the two took off into the distance. Once the two left, the other disciples finally dared to walk over and support Li Feng up.</p><p>“Second Brother rammed into an iron wall this time, provoking a monster that can’t be provoked.”</p><p>“Too frightening! Defeating second brother with a finger, then knocking him out with a slap!”</p><p>“You think second brother will go crazy after waking up?”</p><p>“Don’t spout nonsense! I don’t think second brother can do anything to Ye Chen. If he blindly tries to look for trouble with him, he’ll only make things harder on himself.”</p><p>Although they were still not too clear on Ye Chen’s situation, he’d already turned into someone that couldn’t be provoked in their hearts.</p><p>…</p><p>The next following days, Ye Chen didn’t cultivate much. It was not because he was starting to slack off, but progress in his current state had become extremely hard.</p><p>In terms of Zhen Yuan, he was at the peak mid Sea of Soul realm. To reach late Sea of Soul realm, he would need a long time…anywhere from a year to five years.</p><p>In terms of profound martial skills, apart from Golden Hurricane, he had fully cultivated the rest. The former was a fusion profound martial skill, and thus, its every step forward was extremely challenging. It should be known that a perfected Golden Hurricane was high level profound martial skill, a martial skill which only Life and Death King would be able to comprehend at a fast speed. Comprehending it in the Sea of Soul realm was naturally extremely difficult. Furthermore, only in Ye Chen’s circumstances would one be able to comprehend it to forty percent.</p><p>In the aspect of sword spirit, his Destruction Sword spirit had already reached the fifth step. To think of further raising it would be simply being endlessly greedy. It was just not realistic.</p><p>As for the immortal Sword spirit, it would need an opportunity, and was not something that could be rushed.</p><p>As far as the Defensive Sword Art was concerned, its second layer was already unrivaled. Ye Chen first needed to consolidate it, and couldn’t rush for a breakthrough.</p><p>One day, Elder Yu suddenly found Ye Chen and asked him to follow him to the Treasury.</p><p>En-route, he told Elder Yu about Li Feng’s incident. He didn’t think he was excessive, but merely wished to let the former know about the incident to prevent future incidents that could make things awkward for everyone.</p><p>Elder Yu smiled, “If you want to teach a lesson, just do it. He deserved it. You not being harsh was already leaving enough face for him.”</p><p>Elder Yu didn’t take this matter to heart. Actually, even if he had some other thoughts, he couldn’t do anything. After all, Ye Chen was the Dragon God Envoy, with a status even above the Great Elder, not to mention him.</p><p>Soon, the two quickly arrived at Dragon God Celestial Palace Treasury.</p><p>The Treasury’s supervision was extremely strict, Even Elder Yu needed a written permission from Great Elder before he could enter it.</p><p>Upon entering, Ye Chen saw numerous astonishing treasures. The treasury had four floors altogether: the first floor was for low grade treasures, second floor for mid grade treasures, and third floor for upper grade treasures. But, the fourth floor didn’t have top grade treasures; even semi extreme grade treasures were only seven to eight in number, while the rest were peculiar upper grade treasures.</p><p>“You don’t lack semi extreme grade treasures. The reason for this trip to let you pick your war chariot type upper grade treasure.” Elder Yu led Ye Chen before several war chariots.</p><p>“War Chariot?”</p><p>Sizing up the war chariots before him, Ye Chen was somewhat stunned. This was his first time seeing war chariot type treasures.</p><p>Elder Yu said, “War between ordinary sects involves battles among sect members and battle among experts. However, wars between fifth grade sects involves more. This war chariot type treasure was widespread in the ancient times. It can hold dozens of people. On pouring Zhen Yuan in it, a defensive layer will cover the chariot, and you can break out of an encirclement. Of course, there is no need to use this thing for a small battles. Letting you choose one is merely a precaution.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s identity as the Dragon God Envoy was not just for name. Dragon God Celestial Palace would give their all to satisfy him. Unfortunately, Ye Chen battle’s power was too high, and he simply didn’t need anything. Even as a fifth grade sect, the palace didn’t have many things that he could use.</p><p>“Which one will you pick?” Elder Yu asked.</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t hesitate much and said, “This one!”</p><p>Elder Yu followed Ye Chen’s gaze and praised, “Good eyesight! This war chariot is the best one, and is extremely sturdy.”</p><p>Ye Chen chose a dragon-headed war chariot that was ten meters long and four meters wide. Its four wheels were covered with arm-thick spikes, with golden veins branded on them. One could imagine how many people would be crushed by these spikes when this chariot charged through a battle. Furthermore, one its surface was a huge golden dragon coiled around, with its mouth at the front section. Its mouth was tightly closed, but seemed as if it might open. Its eyes were two huge red gems, emanating a cold, eerie, and bloody feeling of massacre.</p><p>Elder Yu said, “This war chariot is called the Golden Dragon War Chariot. By instilling your Zhen Yuan, the dragon’s mouth can opened, and it will spout red flames. Of course, your Zhen Yuan is not a necessity, others’ will do fine as well.” Pouring Ye Chen’s Zhen Yuan in the chariot would be a waste, since even his casual strike could bring forth a vast destruction.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
