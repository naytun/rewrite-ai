Ever since his Destruction Sword Spirit ascended to the fifth step, Gold Pattern was no longer purely golden. Rather, it had become much more tyrannous and destructive, turning dark golden. With a boop sound, a golden ripple spread out with Ye Chen as its center, at such a speed that it seemed illusory like a golden flower blossoming in the void.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Although Wei Longtao was fast, he was not faster than Ye Chen’s reaction. When he had almost reached ten meters, he was forced to face the golden ripple head-on. Wei Longtao’s fist energy immediately disintegrated, but his fundamentals lay in flesh and strength. Therefore, even though his fist energy was crushed, he still had his iron fists. He bombarded the golden ripple with punches; millions of sparks flew out, and a dazzling shockwave spread out like the starry river itself.</p><p>“Demonic Bull Crown!”</p><p>Upon retreating three steps, Wei Longtao’s body convulsed and he charged again. He punched forward, releasing an energy like a sharp bull horn.</p><p>“Back off!”</p><p>Ye Chen sucked in a deep breath and pushed his Destruction Sword Intent to the peak. His surroundings immediately darkened, and his figure disappeared from the vision of Wei Longtao, Xu Danian, and Chu Chuan. It was as if a black hole had appeared there, swallowing Ye Chen within.</p><p>Creak!</p><p>A lightning bolt flashed, and a black colored sword light suddenly slashed above Wei Longtao’s fist. The sharp winds slashed off a strand of hair from his forehead.</p><p>The two didn’t retreat half a step and pressed onto each other. A darkish purple electricity appeared in the sky, produced by the friction of excessively concentrated energies.</p><p>“Ye Chen can actually fight Hall Leader Wei on equal footing!” Wu Chuan cried out in astonishment.</p><p>Xu Danian similarly exclaimed in astonishment. He didn’t expect that Ye Chen’s strength had already reached such a realm. It was no wonder that he’d been titled Sword Master in the continent. It should be known that Wei Longtao was, after all, considered among the top experts of the palace. Even the Great Elder didn’t dare say that he could win against the other. In a battle a few years ago, he blasted apart a Hall Leader of Black King Gate into pieces with one punch.</p><p>It was impossible for everybody to not notice such a big commotion. In a few moments, thousands of people gathered, including Chen Yuxin, Xing Meilian, and Lin Canghai.</p><p>“What is happening? Why are Deputy Ye and Hall Leader Wei fighting?” Xing Meilian covered her little mouth, not daring to believe her own eyes. She was not an idiot. There was no way Ye Chen and Hall Leader were exchanging pointers. Each and every one of their moves was extremely dangerous.</p><p>“Could it be that Hall Master Wei is the mole?” Chen Yuxin immediately exhibited her imagination.</p><p>“Deputy Ye is said to be a rare genius of a millennium. But now, even that seems like an understatement. He can actually fight Hall Leader Wei toe to toe!”</p><p>“Indeed! I don’t know why Deputy is fighting with Hall Master Wei, but we are absolutely incapable of interfering, and can only watch from the sidelines.”</p><p>Numerous discussions arose, sighing at Ye Chen’s strength.</p><p>A Deputy and a Hall Leader—when two powerful experts clashed, injuries were abound. As for who would have the last laugh, it would rely on their individual methods and hidden aces.</p><p>“Ye Chen, die for me!”</p><p>As Wei Longtao’s right fist collided with the Thunder Disaster Sword, his back muscles bulged and his left fist flew toward Ye Chen’s mouth, carrying three hundred thousand jin of strength.</p><p>“Void Shattering Finger!”</p><p>Ye Chen neither retreated nor dodged. A cyan radiance flickered on his left index finger, pointing toward Wei Long Tao’s iron fist from underneath his right arm.</p><p>Blop!</p><p>The two separated and hurriedly retreated for hundreds of steps.</p><p>Not pouncing again, Wei Longtao apprehensively gazed at Ye Chen with eyes that had narrowed into slits. Ye Chen’s battle power was beyond his expectations. Until now, he’d already exhibited seventy percent of strength, but he still couldn’t gain an inch. If it were the Hall Leaders of the four other forces, he would have dispatched them off long ago.</p><p>“Good, you can take so many moves of mine!”</p><p>Wei Longtao gradually relaxed his body. His flesh and muscles loosened up, but soon began to surge with strength and accumulate it. He was like a volcano on the verge of exploding, ready to discharge the power it had accumulated for millennia at any moment and destroy everything in its wake.</p><p>“You are not bad either! No wonder you can sit steadily on the throne of the most powerful Azure Dragon Hall. You even killed that traitor Yao Yifeng in one punch.”</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t intend to use the Defensive Sword Art. Until now, he’d not run into anybody worthy enough to use that move. Of course, he didn’t dare to underestimate Wei Longtao. Apart from the fourth step spirit body, his physical strength had crossed eight hundred thousand jin. Xu Jing once told him that there was once a sect named Boundless. Both the sect’s supreme elder and patriarch’s strength was above five hundred thousand jin. Especially the patriarch, his strength was simply against the heavens. And this Wei Longtao’s strength was absolutely not below them. Adding the heaven grade secret art Demonic Bull Mountain Crushing Art, his strength could reach the mark of one million jin. He was the most terrifying opponent Ye Chen had ever faced.</p><p>“Next, I’ll use my full strength. I hope you don’t end up being crippled by me.”</p><p>Wei Longtao’s body shook, and his clothes suddenly burst apart, revealing his delicate inner armor. He suddenly clenched his fists, and his back bent in, drawn like a bow.</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>A red colored vital Qi shot toward the sky, producing incessantly fluctuating red colored lightning. Fierce gales covered the entire Azure Dragon Island, and some skyscraping trees were directly uprooted, floating in the sky. The lake water on the island swirled upward like water tornados. The surroundings around Wei Longtao turned dusky, with gravel and stones flying about.</p><p>“Essence Qi Manifestation!”</p><p>Ye Chen was astonished. The blood Qi of a body refiner was much more abundant compared to others. Once they went all out, their essence Qi couldn’t stay abound, and would begin to gush out. However, only body refiners were able to see it, while the others had no method to visualize it. However, Wei Longtao’s Essence Qi had already surpassed this restriction and could be seen with naked eyes. It could be imagined how powerful his blood Qi was.</p><p>“Demonic Bull Seizes Flood Dragon!”</p><p>Pushing his strength to the extreme, Wei Longtao turned into a beam of blood lightning and shot through the gravel-stone zone, pounding his fist toward Ye Chen,</p><p>As soon as he punched, Ye Chen discovered his own blood Qi shaking fiercely, as if about to disperse into fragments. It should be known that blood Qi was the basis of the physical body. If it were lost, the consequences would be simply unimaginable. The blood Qi carried by Wei Longtao’s fist was far stronger than Ye Chen’s, and thus, it was difficult for the latter to endure.</p><p>“Dragon Bone Manifestation!”</p><p>At that moment, a white-dragon bone defensive barrier suddenly stretched out from Ye Chen’s skin. This thin barrier instantly covered his entire body, including his face. It looked like a white mask, only revealing his two eyes and long hair.</p><p>As soon as the dragon bone defensive barrier appeared, Ye Chen’s blood Qi stabilized instantly, not influenced by Wei Longtao’s blood Qi at all.</p><p>“Thunder Devour!”</p><p>Manifesting dragon bones was merely a thought away. In the meantime, Ye Chen’s body was not idle as he raised his Thunder Disaster Sword high. Beams of black lightning started converging on the sword’s tip, condensing into a fist-sized lightning sphere. As soon as the sphere formed, an intense destructive aura spread out, so concentrated that it seemed to even solidify.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The sword slashed down, and the lightning sphere turned into a black light beam, shooting toward Wei Longtao.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>Wei Longtao was not afraid to touch the lightning sphere at all.</p><p>Kacha, Kacha, Kacha!</p><p>The lightning sphere exploded, turning the hundred li of surroundings into a world of lightning. Fork and snake shaped lightning currents, and huge balls of lightning radiated in every direction, covering the spectators and giving them a feeling like the end of the world.</p><p>“Retreat!”</p><p>Xu Danian raised his Zhen Yuan barrier and shouted to everybody else.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Although the spectators were quite far, and they even escaped as soon as they sensed danger, a small part of them still spurted out blood, suffering substantial internal injuries.</p><p>At the center of the exploding lightning, Wei Longtao stood tall. The slowly dispersing lightning sphere still couldn’t get near him, and was being scattered by his powerful blood Qi.</p><p>“Too powerful! Is this a level that Sea of Soul realm can truly reach?” Xing Meilian and Chen Yuxin were dumbstruck. Be it Wei Longtao or Ye Chen, their battle power had shattered their cognition of Sea of Soul realm. Ordinary Sea Of Soul Masters wouldn’t be able to withstand even a single strike from these two.</p><p>Unleashing the Thunder sphere, Ye Chen took the initiative to attack as he hoisted his sword and obliquely slashed upwards. Wei Longtao would naturally not fear close combat, and the two exchanged dozens of blows.</p><p>“Blood Severing Ghost Finger!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s reactions and insight were superior to Wei Longtao. He abruptly used the technique he’d recently learnt, Blood Severing Ghost Finger.</p><p>Blood Severing Ghost Finger was evaluated as a mid grade heaven realm secret technique. Once used, it immediately produced bizarre images, carrying boundless terror concentrated in one finger.</p><p>‘You’ve actually cultivated Blood Severing Ghost Finger!” Wei Longtao hurriedly retreated as if he’d seen a ghost.</p><p>He had visited the Secret Pavilion many times, including the third floor. He naturally knew the frightening art that was Blood Severing Ghost Finger. It was too hard to cultivate, and even Patriarch Dragon King had only cultivated it to minor completion. Nobody had succeeded in cultivating it to major completion. Moreover, it couldn’t be obtained with contribution points. Thus, Wei Longtao had only seen the introduction on his cover, and hadn’t truly studied it.</p><p>However, this did nothing to lessen his fear of this technique,</p><p>It could even be said that this technique was the bane of body refiners. Regardless of how much blood Qi one had, just a finger would turn one into ghost.</p><p>Unfortunately, regardless of how fast We Longtao retreated, he couldn’t be faster than Ye Chen’s attack. A silver finger slashed, and without any sound or movement, Wei Longtao suddenly felt as if something had gone amiss from inside his body.</p><p>Upon a careful inspection, Wei Longtao laughed, “So, you’re only at the beginning stage, still way off minor completion.”</p><p>He had lost quite a bit of blood Qi, but compared to the total amount present in his body, his body didn’t suffer a substantial effect.</p><p>“Sure enough…against a body refiner of Wei Longtao’s league, the current Blood Severing Ghost Finger is too lacking. Its effect is too small.”</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t intend to defeat Wei Longtao with the Blood Severing Ghost Finger at all. He was merely experimenting, since only when used on an expert of the same level would it have any meaning. If he used it on common experts, they would be defeated directly, and he would not be able to gauge its true strength.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
