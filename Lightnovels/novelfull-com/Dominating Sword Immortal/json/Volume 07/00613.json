Since they had chosen to do this, then a result would have to be presented.</p><p>“I will use all my power now!”</p><p>After hearing their conversation, everyone watching the battle could not help but get excited, their hearts threating to jump out of their chests. They were all wondering what kind of intense battle this would escalate into.</p><p>Dong!</p><p>The lake water sank in as Bai Wuxue and Xia Houzun clashed together. Compared to before, the two had finally deployed their martial arts to their peak this time. They did not care about Zhen yuan usage anymore, and had agreed that they would not use pellets to recover either.</p><p>“Bai Wuxue, take this attack of mine! Shooting Star Finger!”</p><p>Xia Houzun shoot up into the sky, all ten fingers from both of their hands moving in the air. With that, a huge torrent of power shot out like falling stars.</p><p>“Stealth Substitution!”</p><p>However, Bai Wuxue did not back out for even one step. He pushed his Zhen yuan to its limitation before eventually forming a massive ancient-looking tree out of his body. The tree was crystal clear, as if it was carved out of a diamond. The branches of the tree reached out, looking like an umbrella.</p><p>Pap! Pap! Pap! Xia Houzun’s attack had been absorbed at the touch of the ancient tree, turning into fruits and filling the tree up.</p><p>Gasp!</p><p>The gasping sound from the audience was almost united. It was the first time most people had seen a warrior manage to turn his opponent’s attack into his own profound martial art. Right then and there, Bai Wuxue seemed way more mysterious and unbelievably powerful. Some of the older master level warriors who thought they were still way more powerful than these young warriors started to look more and more serious with each passing second.</p><p>Ting!</p><p>The great sword and blade on Lu Shaoyou and Xiao Chuhe’s waist started to move slightly, making a quiet clinging sound. It was them not being able to control their battling intent and causing their swords to vibe with them, almost wanting to shoot out on their own to attack Bai Wuxue and Xia Houzun.</p><p>“Bai Wuxue, you are indeed different!”</p><p>Xiao Chuhe’s eyes were bright like blades under the sunshine as he stared closely at Bai Wuxue in the middle of the lake. Although Xia Houzun was very powerful, but judging on what was happening, he was obviously in the weaker position in front of Bai Wuxue.</p><p>“You are qualified to be my next opponent.” Lu Shaoyou let out a breath and said lightly.</p><p>On the small hill, Ye Chen and the others looked extra serious; they were rather shocked.</p><p>“Impressive! He was able to train his wood profound to this level.” Ye Chen was also really good at this wood profound; but obviously, Bai Wuxue was way more powerful than him in this area.</p><p>Seeing that his attack had been turned into fruits on that ancient tree, Xie Houzun was distracted for a little. He had to admit that Bai Wuxue’s power was way more intense than he had expected. If he wanted to win, then he might have to pay a big price.</p><p>“Major Shooting Star Finger!”</p><p>In the ancient tree, Bai Wuxue waved his palm and shot out finger powers from the branches, attacking back at Xia Houzun. What was more horrifying was that the attack coming from Bai Wuxue was way more powerful than the latter’s. It was not only more powerful, but also faster, being enhanced in every way.</p><p>Treating one with one’s own way…</p><p>Bai Wuexue’s power had shocked everyone.</p><p>“Haha!” Xia Houzun was so mad that his anger turned into a hysterical laughter. Bai Wuxue’s attack was an obvious slap in the face. It made him so angry that he was slightly surprised himself.</p><p>“Bai Wuxue, you are indeed very powerful…But, it is still not enough.”</p><p>As he spoke, his finger drew a circle, two circles, and then three circles around his body, forming three layers of defense. He made himself look like he was in a whole another world which was very far away from this one, diminishing the effect of the incoming attacks. Hence, the remaining finger power could no longer make an impact on Xia Houzun.</p><p>“This time, I will see how you can absorb this! Comet Finger Attack!” Roaring angrily, Xia Houzun activated all of his Zhen yuan before pointing it out.</p><p>Without a sound, the sky darkened eerily, and the darkness filled up the whole place. In that pitch black space, a massive comet sliced through the sky, carrying that world-destroying qi as it attacked toward that crystal looking ancient tree and Bai Wuxue, who was within.</p><p>“One Branch Shine!”</p><p>Bai Wuxue looked just as calm as before as he formed a spell quickly with his hands. All the branches of the ancient tree had been pulled back into the main branch, leaving only one out. It was growing rapidly somehow, eventually its side reaching over its main trunk and welcoming that incoming finger power at an extreme speed.</p><p>The earth shook, the sun lost its shine, and the sky above the lake turned into a deadly forbidden place. That exploding bright light had forced everyone to close their eyes. They feared that they would lose their eyes if they did not do so. Obviously, no one would risk it, since it was not their battle after all.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>After the bright light came a world-shattering noise. That sound had made a lot of people’s faces turn pale; they could feel their chest tense up even though they were dozens of miles away from the battling location.</p><p>“Bai Wuxue, take another attack of mine!”</p><p>In that bright light, color itself had lost its meaning. A beam of shadow moved quickly as it approached Bai Wuxue. However, the sky went dark again, and the bright light was dimmed down. A solidified finger power cracked open the bright light somehow before shooting toward Bai Wuxue.</p><p>“Xia Houzun, bring out your most powerful ace attack and your Void Shattering Finger!”</p><p>Bai Wuxue let go of his broken Zhen yuan ancient tree. He took a deep breath, and that palm of him that was covered in bright green light reached out with a grabbing gesture in midair. In that second, in this pitch black environment, a massive green hand appeared out of nowhere, grabbing onto that incoming finger attack before squeezing it extremely hard.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>This huge noise was not as powerful as the last one; the finger power of that star and the massive hand disappeared together, leaving behind a burst of energy.</p><p>“As you wish!”</p><p>Xia Houzun also knew that he could not do anything to Bai Wuxue with only his star shooting finger art and comet finger attack. Amongst the top young five warriors, no one was the ultimate champion. But, it was needless to say that Bai Wuxue was the one who hid himself the deepest; it was almost impossible to read through him.</p><p>“Void Shattering Finger!” Xia Houzun lifted up his right index finger as quickly as he could. In the next second, the power of space poured in from everywhere, gathering around him. He did not seem to be able to control all of it at once, so some of the space power leaked out. It brought up some patterns in the air before spreading further.</p><p>“Such a rich powerful space power.”</p><p>Ye Chen closed his eyes, sinking into the deep observation of that space power. He could feel that he was like a fish in that running space power, continuing absorbing the nutrition within to grow himself.</p><p>As he learned the space profound, Yan Fengfeng, Murong Qingcheng, and the others sensed his transformation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
