But, when Ye Chen rode in with his battle chariot, the whole formation of the Whirlwind Gate had been disturbed. In the crowd were enemies, but their own warriors as well. As a result, it would be impossible to throw out mass range attacks. As for defense, it would also be impossible, since the defense from only dozens of warriors could not stop the battle chariot at all. It would only take one round of attack for the battle chariot to break through and leave a bloody path behind.</p><p>The battle chariot was moving at an extreme speed. If it were some other Sea of Souls Realm warrior behind the wheel, it might have been too fast to handle and gotten out of the enemy area. But, under Ye Chen’s control, the battle chariot was like a mad dragon as well as an eel. It shot between the enemies back and forth, leaving behind dead corpses and a river of blood.</p><p>Looking from above, crossed blood marks were obvious on the ground, which was horrifying.</p><p>But, over at Ye Chen’s side, they had also lost a lot. Because there were only less than thirty of them on the vehicle, the others could only follow behind the chariot like a tail. If they did not leave the chariot’s trail, they could still kill the enemies. But, once they got too far away, they would be drowned by the crowd. After a couple of breaths, at least thirty people could no longer follow up with the group and got attacked by the enemies.</p><p>“B*stard! Everyone, get away! Get away!”</p><p>The leader of the Whirlwind Gate was losing his mind. The battle did not start that long ago, and he had already lost two hundred warriors. The rest of them were in shock as well. Right now, each breath would cost him dozens of his warriors. It was not like a battle anymore, but more like a genocide.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>There was no need for the leader to say more as the remaining warriors realized what had just happened and started to scatter around.</p><p>Ye Chen did not change his attitude at all as he stood in front of the vehicle and yelled, “Everyone, listen up! Attack the enemies on the left…Scatter your attacks.”</p><p>If they attacked with focus, they could only attack enemies in one straight line, which would be a waste. But, if they scattered the attacks, then the attack range would augment drastically. Plus, Ye Chen did not ask everyone to attack randomly, but on the left area instead. In that case, even with scattered attacks, the warriors from the opposing parties would have to take them seriously.</p><p>Indeed, although the enemies managed to escape from being squashed after they scattered around, countless of them were still being killed off due to the different defensive power they had, falling down like raindrops from the sky. As for Ye Chen himself, he did not attack the enemies on the left. Instead, he attacked the right side. In the face of his Green Lotus sword qi, opposing warriors were cut off like crops ready for harvest. The killing rate of his alone was one-third that of the others combined, which was rather impressive.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>The leader of the enemies was too shocked, just like the other powerful warriors of the enemy side. After five breaths worth of time, the Whirlwind Gate had lost around four hundred people, and the perfectly-spread formation had been shattered. The whole scene looked like that of a massive cat hunting down tiny rats while the latter were running for their lives.</p><p>“Where did this brat come from?”</p><p>The leader of the Black King Martial School had a great eyesight. He knew it clearly that if it were not for Ye Chen’s control of the battle chariot, it would be impossible for them to have this kind of a result. What frightened him the most was that as he was doing so, he could still shoot out countless rays of deadly sword qi at the same time, opening paths for the team members.</p><p>In other words, without Ye Chen, this force of army would lose at least half of its attacking power.</p><p>“Let’s do this!”</p><p>Xu Danian and the warriors behind him had been wounded badly. There were four hundred of them when they first got here, but only one hundred something were left by now. If it were not for Ye Chen who had attracted most of the attacks while distracting the enemies, they would have all been killed by now.</p><p>Amongst the one hundred warriors, there were still about thirty Sea of Souls Realm warriors; three hundred Astral Reaching Realm warriors had been killed so far. It was a horrifying number, since they had only lost around three hundred in total when Hu Wenhai was ambushed the last time.</p><p>While the warriors from the Black King Martial School were distracted and ended up being a bit slow. Xu Danian took the warriors with him and successfully broke through. But, after he did so, there were only eighty of them left, three of which were Sea of Souls Realm warriors.</p><p>“Die!”</p><p>After killing enough warriors over this side, Ye Chen shifted his focus onto the warriors from the Black King Martial School. He waved his hand, and the battle chariot turned around and attacked toward them.</p><p>“It is coming! It is coming! Scatter!”</p><p>“Do not let him come in between us!”</p><p>Even though the warriors had already experienced hundreds of battles, they were still frightened by Ye Chen’s martial arts. Using the battle chariot as an arrow, he managed to come in and out without any obstacles.</p><p>“Do not scatter around!” The leader of the school suddenly yelled hysterically.</p><p>No matter how powerful Ye Chen’s tricks were, they would only work if he made it into the formation. The reason that those warriors were killed before was because they chose to face it head-on in the beginning, instead of putting all of their focus on defense. By the time they finally changed their approach in the end, it was already too late. With that lesson learned, as long as they focused on defense right from the beginning and waited for their chance to fight back, they would be able to win eventually. However, it was already too late. Once those warriors scattered, it would take time for them to rejoin their power. Meanwhile, Ye Chen was only a dozen miles away, and could arrive within two to three breaths of time.</p><p>Breath!</p><p>Breath!</p><p>Breath!</p><p>Before a third breath set in, the battle chariot brought the unbreakable golden light as it attacked over. Wherever it touched, the air continued to explode while two visible marks appeared under the wheels. Some of the warriors who did not have the time to get away were torn into pieces instantly. The whole battle chariot and the warriors behind looked aggressive like a moving cannon.</p><p>After the warriors from the Whirlwind Gate were killed, all of the warriors from the Black King Martial School were scattered as well. Dozens of their warriors had been killed, and the death toll was rising rapidly. It was like a snow ball, rolling bigger and bigger.</p><p>As for the scattered attacks from Black King Martial School warriors, they could not break through the defense of the battle chariot at all. Although the target was small, an order would be needed to focus the attacks. However, although the people inside the battle chariot were fine, the warriors behind were not okay at all. There were warriors being killed continuously, and blood spilled everywhere.</p><p>From the three hundred something warriors from before, Ye Chen only had a low two hundred warriors on his side by now. Moreover, the number was still continuously dropping.</p><p>The killing continued, and the warriors that had been attacked by the Black King Martial School ran around like headless chickens. The ones who were not attacked got organized and started to fight back systematically. Now, while warriors from the opposing side were still being killed rapidly, warriors on Ye Chen’s side seemed to be facing a greater pressure as well, with only two hundred of them left.</p><p>“Gather with Deputy Xu!”</p><p>Ye Chen was not blinded by the killings and made up his mind immediately, bringing the rest of the warriors toward Xu Danian and preparing for the upcoming bloody battles.</p><p>“Deputy Ye, I, Xu Danian, have never gotten this impressed by other warriors. You are definitely an exception. I, Xu Danian, owe you a life.”</p><p>Xu Danian had just dodged death, so he was in a rather good mood. The warriors behind him revealed a respectful expression as well. Ye Chen had saved their lives as well, which was an honorable act. At the same time, his killings had frightened them as well. The emotions elevated Ye Chen’s image in their hearts to the next level.</p><p>Ye Chen jumped off the battle chariot and said, “Everyone is from the Dragon Palace. So, we have to work together, I have only done my part for the palace. Deputy Xu, no need to thank me for that.”</p><p>“Haha…Regardless, it is because of you that all of us can survive. If I manage to get back safely today, I will sure buy you some drinks.” Xu Danian laughed.</p><p>“Alright!” Ye Chen did not reject.</p><p>After the two groups reunited, the number of warriors jumped back to two hundred and seventy. Although it was less than half of their initial numbers, they were doing actually way better compared to the enemy side. Although the palace suffered a great loss of manpower this time, it was not rainbows and sunshine for the top four power parties either. They might have lost even more than the palace.</p><p>The warriors from the Black King Martial School did not chase after them; what they needed now was to take a breather instead of the aimless killings. Being attacked by Ye Chen, they had lost more men than ever—from the six hundred warriors on their side at the beginning, down to only three hundred and eighty now. Adding the remaining Whirlwind Gate warriors, there were only a little over six hundred of them right now. It was only moments ago when they still had one thousand and three hundred warriors.</p><p>“Regroup.”</p><p>The leader of the Black King Martial School had a bad look on his face. He waved his hand, leading his men and the warriors from the Whirlwind Gate together. Right now, only by working together could they have a chance of still completing the mission. Fighting on their own would be impossible to achieve that.</p><p>“Brother Liao, what do we do now?” The leaders of both schools stood together.</p><p>“Kill!” A single word popped out the leader of the Black King Martial School’s mouth.</p><p>Today, if he just left now, not only would his status within the school be lowered, he might even lose his title of the second-in-command. People would start to think of him as a joke. But, if he still managed to kill all of those men and Ye Chen, then he would have an excuse for the losses. After all, the reason behind this surprising outcome was because Ye Chen appeared out of everyone’s expectations. He believed that once the management knew about Ye Chen’s power, they might not blame him at all. They might even praise him for his right decision and killing such a dangerous enemy for the school.</p><p>“Can we pull that off?”</p><p>The leader of the Whirlwind Gate was having doubts. There were six hundred warriors at the beginning on his side, and now, there were only two hundred something left. It was such a traumatizing experience, and a lot of the warriors were badly wounded already. The Black King Martial School was doing slightly better, with only half of their warriors lost.</p><p>“Brother Li, I think you are just frightened. Think about it…There are six hundred of us! Do you think we cannot block out their attacks? As long as we work together, we can definitely put them in a bad situation. And, with the number of warriors we have on our side, we can definitely finish this business.” The leader of the Black King Martial School did not lose his temperament and analyzed the situation carefully.</p><p>“That is true, but take a look at our warriors.” The leader turned around and forced a chuckle.</p><p>Hearing him, the Black King Martial School leader turned around as well, the expression on his face turning worse and worse.</p><p>Although they still had the advantage of having more warriors left, which was twice as that of the Dragon Palace side, the atmosphere was not great on his side at all compared to the latter. All of them were looking scared and shocked; it was obvious that they were scared of Ye Chen.</p><p>It was reasonable after all, since the battle itself was not scary; what was scary was Ye Chen’s power that overshadowed everyone. Ye Chen had brought too much trauma for them. It was impossible for them to wake up from that nightmarish experience; the warriors could not help but think that Ye Chen could walk in at any minute and crush them like ants.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
