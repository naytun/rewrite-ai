This time, not only did we kill a large number of Azure Dragon Hall members, we even got rid off their deputy head Hu Wenhai!”</p><p>The four groups didn’t pursue Yao Yifeng’s group. Instead, they all stopped and broke out in hearty laughter, thrilled.</p><p>Water Wave Sect’s troop leader smiled and said, “These past few years, we’ve killed more than a thousand members of the Dragon God Celestial Palace, right? Let’s see how long they can keep going…whether they cultivate experts quicker or we kill them faster.”</p><p>The speed of a fifth grade sect’s raising Astral Reaching experts was dozens of times higher in comparison to sixth grade sects. Sixth grade sects had members in tens of thousands, whereas fifth grade sects had members in hundred thousands. And for a peak fifth grade sect like Dragon God Celestial, its population had already crossed a million. As long as they had the resources, they would have a constant stream of Astral Reaching experts, and even raising Sea of Soul realm experts was not too difficult. After all, being a fifth grade sect, one must have sufficient talent. Therefore, their rate of cultivating experts was unusually high.</p><p>However, fifth grade sects also had a limit. If their experts kept dying at such a rate, a few years would be enough to substantially affect their power. In ten years, they would face a serious deficit, creating a gap in the supply stream. Once such a deficit appeared, it signified the sect’s downfall.</p><p>“They can only blame themselves for being too powerful. Our four great sects only occupy forty percent of the eastern ocean while Dragon God Celestial Palace occupies fifty percent by themselves. After so long, we’ve finally begun to catch up to them.” Whirlwind Gate’s leader stroked the blade in his hands with an ominous glint in his eyes.</p><p>“Alright, the operation is finished! Dragon God Celestial Temple has suffered a disastrous loss. Presumably, they won’t make any big movements in the near future. We’ll report back first.” With that, the Sky Eagle Cult’s members flew off. Following them, Black King Gate, Whirlwind Gate’s, and Water Wave Sect’s members also left one after another, leaving behind a blood-soaked ocean with hundreds of dismembered corpses.</p><p>…</p><p>Few thousand li away, Yao Yifeng and dozens of surviving Azure Dragon Hall experts stopped.</p><p>“Damn it! Where did those b*stards get the information from? We ended up suffering their counter-ambush, and even the deputy died.” One of the members howled in a coarse voice.</p><p>“Somebody must have leaked it. There’s no way they could have known otherwise.”</p><p>“Whoever leaked the secret won’t have a good death if I ever find out.”</p><p>A strange expression flickered in Yao Yifeng’s eyes before he said aggrievedly, “Only the hall heads and a few deputies knew about such a secret mission in advance. I think the chances of someone leaking it is quite low.”</p><p>“Hall Head, deputies?”</p><p>Hearing these words, everybody turned silent. They trusted the hall head completely, but they couldn’t help but raise suspicions toward those deputies. After all, the losses this time were too miserable: they almost lost one-seventh of their members. If a few more such incidents were to occur, Azure Dragon Hall would only remain in name.</p><p>“I’ll make a trip to headquarters this time and have the elders dispatch an investigation team come to Azure Dragon Hall and find out the mole.”</p><p>“Right! Before the mole is caught, Azure Dragon Hall won’t be able to remain calm.”</p><p>,,,</p><p>Ye Chen stayed with Murong Qingcheng for a whole week. During the week, the two enjoyed their own world. Meanwhile, he also exchanged pointers with her, pointing out a few weak points in her battling techniques. With his peerless soul power, Ye Chen was sensitive to many details and was unmatched in suppressing opponents while seizing advantage at key moments.</p><p>After making huge gains in terms of the profound, Murong Qingcheng herself precisely lacked a sparring partner at this moment. During their dueling sessions, her battle power improved steadily. As of now, she was probably even stronger than Bei Minghui. If the Masters Ranking were to be revised, she would at least be in the top twenty.</p><p>At the same time, Ye Chen wasn’t idling while battling Murong Qingcheng. He focused primarily on the Defensive Sword Art, and had already cultivated the second layer. With but a thought, he would have his flying sword slay the opponent. Be it three hundred steps away or ten steps away, it didn’t make any difference, even if one possessed an astonishing speed. Even Murong Qingcheng, who was innately gifted in speed, found it exceptionally hard to avoid Ye Chen’s flying sword. Its killing speed was twice that of the Spiritual Sword Attack.</p><p>A week later, Ye Chen returned to Ye family, while Murong Qingcheng immediately concentrated on creating her own profound martial skill.</p><p>…</p><p>In the sky, a silk ribbon like white light flitted by. The white light was sharp like sword, seeming like an illusory sword shutting across.</p><p>The white light arrived above the Windy Nation.</p><p>“A puny country and a puny clan actually gave birth to a sword genius of a millennium…it’s certainly not easy. But, a tree must suffer against the wind and rain to grow. If a youngling doesn’t understand this fact, it won’t do him any good. Let me teach him a thing or two!”</p><p>The white light paused for a moment, then violently sped forth, heading toward Ye family.</p><p>At the Ye family grounds, Ye Chen was instructing a Ye family disciple.</p><p>The disciple was none other than Ye Xiaoshu—the one who allowed Ye Chen to have a flash of insight and accomplish greater success in Gold Pattern.</p><p>Although the latter’s talent in cultivation was ordinary, his talent in sword arts was exceptional. He had already cultivated the Sky Water Sword Spell which Ye Chen gave him to sixth style, with fifth style up to sixty-seventy percent completion and sixth style to fifty percent completion. It was quite impressive indeed!</p><p>Ye Chen watched Ye Xiaoshui cultivate,” Swift sword techniques will dazzle your opponents, making them unable to see your sword’s trajectory. But, be it swift sword techniques or other techniques, you should never go for flashy stunts, and focus on substance, Your technique is good, but it’s still a little superficial. The Sky Water Sword Spell emphasizes on three words: soft, coil, and ferocious. You have learned soft, but the latter two are lacking. Coil is the next level of soft, and ferocious is the final appearance…like a whirlpool swallowing your opponent.”</p><p>Ye Xiaoshui revered Ye Chen as a legendary existence. Therefore, he listened seriously and studied even more seriously. He could feel that although his sword arts had not gained anything substantive, his chances against an opponent of the same level had increased by a lot. This was the difference between theoretical and practical aspects of sword arts.</p><p>Ye Chen’s direct supervision had reduced his hard work by several times.</p><p>“Alright, let’s stop here.” Ye Chen suddenly ended the session with a shout and took off to the sky.</p><p>In the horizon, a white light could be seen charging straight across. A powerful sword Qi was resonating with the sky, as if it had completely fused with sky.</p><p>“Who is this?” Ye Xiaoshui breath was stuck in his throat. At the same time, he felt a chill from within.</p><p>“Master Sky Sword.” Ye Chen could tell the identity of the man at a glance.</p><p>Among the older generation of Sword Master, Master Sky Sword, Master Blood Sword, Master Demon Sword, and a few others were the most prominent ones; they all had different styles. Master Blood Sword had a cruel and ruthless sword art, reeking of blood and slaughter. Master Demon Sword had strange sword arts—his techniques were so bizarre that one wouldn’t be able to even get a wind of it. Meanwhile, Master Sky Sword’s techniques were even more exceptional; they felt unstoppable like a massive army sweeping across the battlefield.</p><p>This individual was Master Sky Sword without a doubt.</p><p>The white light’s speed was extremely fast. It arrived above Ye Chen’s courtyard in a few moments, revealing a white-haired old man. His robes softly fluttered as he stood by a huge tree beside the lake.</p><p>The old man sized up Ye Chen and was somewhat startled. He could feel the presence of greater sword aura in Ye Chen’s body. This greater aura was different from his. This was a pressure that came from deep within. Relating this aura with the previous events, the old man could ascertain that this was the latter’s sword master greater aura.</p><p>‘How many days have passed? How can he already have this aura?’</p><p>The old man’s brows creased slightly. A person’s faith could be frightening. Some bodhisattva in temples were clearly dead matter, but upon receiving sufficient worship, they could undergo a strange phenomenon and gradually turn spiritual. Of course, this spiritual being was not an omnipotent being that could fulfill wishes of its worshippers. It could only relieve its believers from distracting thoughts and clear their minds. This was the so-called repaying the faith.</p><p>The title of Sword Master was the number one title under Sword King, and it had been highly honored since ancient times. It had an enormous significance. Upon receiving the title of Sword Master, one would develop the greater aura from deep within. When other sword artists met a Sword Master, they would suffer an incorporeal suppression.</p><p>“Good, very good! You are Ye Chen?” The old man slowly let out a breath, his gaze burning.</p><p>Ye Chen faintly nodded and said, “You, sir, are Master Sky Sword, right?”</p><p>“That is me, this old man.” Master Sky Sword cleared his throat and said, “There hasn’t been anyone with the title Sword Master for past several hundred years…Do you know why?”</p><p>Ye Chen knew a little, but he proceeded with, “Please guide me.”</p><p>“Before the Life and Death realm, the title of Sword Master is the highest glory for a sword artist. In these several hundred years, there has been no lack of great sword artists…instead, they are everywhere. However, not a single person has dared to claim the title of Sword Master. This is simply because no sword artist could be completely assured that they would be able to keep the title. And failing in doing so is a great insult for a Sword Master. Therefore, for the current you, this title is too early. I came here without telling anyone. Give up the title of Sword Master by yourself, and I won’t make things difficult for you.”</p><p>Ye Chen smiled faintly, “My view is different from yours. The reason why there hasn’t been any Sword Master in these past hundred years is not because they didn’t have the ability to preserve the title…Instead, they didn’t have the courage. Even if they had the strength, they were still not fit to be called Sword Master. The title Sword Master is nothing but the combination of internal aspects…one must have strength and courage. If one has both strength and courage, why not accept the title?”</p><p>Master Sky Sword squinted his eyes, “Seems like there is no room for words. Since you believe you have the strength, I’ve no choice but to sober you up.”</p><p>“You’re welcome to try, but I believe your efforts will be in vain.” Ye Chen was not one bit in awe of the former’s fame. In his eyes, the former was a powerful sword artist, while he was the Sword Master.</p><p>“Hehe…This is the first time I’ve come across such an arrogant youngster.” Master Sky Sword laughed in fury and waved his hand. With that, a large number of leaves suddenly flew out from the big tree beside him. These leaves hovered above his hand, producing wheezing sounds. With a flick of his hand, the leaves shot out. This was so-called ‘even flowers and leaves can hurt’.</p><p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p><p>These leaves were no longer ordinary: they contained the Zhen Yuan and sword intent of a powerful sword artist. Moreover, they also seemed to carry a unique profound. Without any exaggeration, these leaves could even kill ordinary masters. And this was merely the initial probe of Master Sky Sword.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Ye Chen’s body didn’t budge at all. Instead, a golden ripple suddenly appeared from his body, shredding the incoming leaves.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
