Controlling the sword to attack?”</p><p>In a tiny country like Windy Nation, there was hardly anyone capable of recognizing the Defensive Sword Art—a technique which not many knew about to begin with.</p><p>“Defensive Sword Art!”</p><p>Master Sky Sword swatted backward and a summit shattered, which also allowed him to halt. He unblinkingly stared at the flying sword in the air.</p><p>“Correct!” Ye Chen indifferently replied.</p><p>“You’ve already cultivated the Defensive Sword Art to the highest realm?’</p><p>Master Sky Sword was, after all, a sword artist of the older generation. Thus, he couldn’t not know about this sword art. This technique was very highly reputed, mainly because it could let even an ordinary sword artist become a peak sword artist. Therefore, it was even revered to the extent of being deified. However, Master Sky Sword knew that even though this technique was powerful, it could only let one be a peak sword artist; it was not invincible.</p><p>Defensive Sword Art had its own flaw: it could not mature with the sword artist. When used at the initial or mid Sea of Soul realm the power of this technique would be the same, unless one’s soul power improved. In other words, it’s might was closely linked to one’s soul power. Therefore, even if he knew that the Defensive Sword Art had emerged once again, he wouldn’t care too much. After all, with his strength, this art wouldn’t be able to hurt him. So, for him, it was nothing more than a kind of tricky art, not something that threatened him.</p><p>However, at this moment, this technique seemed almost invincible in the hands of Ye Chen. Its speed was so fast that he didn’t even have the time to react.</p><p>He concluded that Ye Chen had must have cultivated this technique to the highest level.</p><p>Moreover, Ye Chen must have some talent in the aspect of soul; otherwise, he couldn’t have cultivated this technique to the highest level, and it would have no chance of threatening him.</p><p>Hearing these words, Ye Chen remained taciturn. In the hands of other sword artists, this technique was merely a shortcut to become a peak sword artist. Although it had a huge significance, it was not the essence of this technique. In other words, its potential was not fully realized. In his hands, however, this technique was basically a top-notch killing move. He’d currently already cultivated to the second layer, and he had the might to wreck Master Sky Sword. If he so wished, he could easily have Master Sky Sword’s head severed. If he were to cultivate to the highest third layer, even he himself didn’t know what level its killing power would reach.</p><p>Sucking in a deep breath, Master Sky Sword’s eyes sharpened, “Let me see how powerful this so-called Defensive Sword Art is.”</p><p>Previously, he’d been attacked while he was already pushed back by the shockwave. If he had full concentration, he believed that he would be able to react.</p><p>“You can’t resist!” Ye Chen pointed in the air, and the green light arc flickered, arriving to the right of Master Sky Sword.</p><p>“Found it.” Master Sky Sword found the green light’s trajectory and slashed. On the other side, Ye Chen tilted his fingers with a tranquil expression.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>In the next moment, luminous sparks flew from Master Sky Sword’s back.</p><p>At the crucial moment, Ye Chen had controlled the flying sword, and it arrived behind Master Sky Sword as if it had teleported. The latter had no chance to turn his body. Although the destructive sword Qi was weakened by a lot by the Protective Zhen Yuan and further churned down by the armor, some of it still transmitted to Master Sky Sword’s inner body, causing him to bleed from his eyes, ears, and nose. The bleeding Master Sky Sword seemed like a devil right now.</p><p>“I told you, you can’t resist.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s Defensive Sword Art was several times more powerful than Situ Hao’s. First of all, his soul power was five times more than a normal person. Not only could he control the flying sword as he wished, he could let it attain a frightening speed; the more the speed, the higher the sword’s killing power. Secondly, Ye Chen’s sword intent was the Destruction sword intent, its might equivalent to the peak fifth step ordinary sword intent. Situ Hao could not compare with Ye Chen in either aspect. The former’s sword art was merely slag before Ye Chen.</p><p>Taking a step back, even if Sky Sword Master could predict the trajectory and block, it would still be useless. The offensive power behind Ye Chen’s flying sword was too high. Master Sky Sword would absolutely not be able to resist several of such strikes. After a few times, his blood and Qi would be severely overturned, and his body would not be able to keep up.</p><p>“How can it be strong?”</p><p>Master Sky Sword spurted blood while looking at Ye Chen with astonishment. The latter’s Defensive Sword Art simply turned his view on this technique. According to some ancient records, this technique was certainly not strong to this extent!</p><p>“Master Sky Sword, you are not my opponent. Whether you recognize me as Sword Master or not, I am stronger than you. There is no need to doubt this point.” Ye Chen’s voice sounded.</p><p>Slowly Straightening his figure, Master Sky Sword seemed to have suddenly aged ten years, “Young man, I take back my previous words. You are certainly stronger than me, and also have the qualifications to become Sword Master. I believe that on this entire continent, there is nobody qualified to contend with the title of Sword Master with you.”</p><p>Ye Chen was still maturing. With the passage of time, his position as Sword Master would be firmly stabilized. After the previous exchange, he thoroughly understood that under half-step King realm, there was no sword artists capable of defeating Ye Chen.</p><p>“I hope it turns out as you say.” With a thought, the green longsword turned around and flew back into its sheath.</p><p>“With this matter already done, I’ll no longer bother you.” With a bitter smile, Master Sky Sword flicked his sleeve and left, his figure soon disappearing in the horizon.</p><p>“Ye Chen won! Seems like the title of Sword Master is more or less in the bag.”</p><p>“What a joke! Just relying on his Defensive Sword Art, nobody is his opponent.”</p><p>“Didn’t expect that our tiny country will actually produce a Sword Master, the likes of which has never appeared in the continent in hundreds of years.”</p><p>“Sword Master, ah! This is indeed the highest honor under the Life and Death realm.”</p><p>If Sword King was the monarch of sword, then Sword Master was a General, and all the other sword artists were soldiers.</p><p>With the battle concluded, Ye Chen and Ye family members headed back to Ye Residence while the spectators from the martial world also left gradually. However, due to the heightened mood, many of them found nearby inns and began to chat heartily about the various experts under the heavens.</p><p>…</p><p>As Master Sky Sword left Windy Nation, he ran into one of his old rivals—Master Blood Sword</p><p>The latter was originally looking to mock Master Sky Sword, but when he saw the latter’s dispirited and seemingly injured state, he couldn’t help but speak suspiciously, “Old Ghost Sky Sword, did you win your battle with Ye Chen?”</p><p>He thought that the latter must have beaten Ye Chen but suffered some substantial injuries. Ye Chen must have turned stronger than he’d expected.</p><p>Master Sky Sword was never fond of Master Blood Sword. Thus, he replied coldly, “Lost.”</p><p>Upon replying, his figure flickered, moving past Master Blood Sword.</p><p>“Lost?” Master Blood Sword was stumped. ‘This old coot is surely trying to fool me. How can he lose? Whatever, since I’m already here, let’s see what tricks this Ye Chen has.’ Master Blood Sword’s lips curled into a sneer as he sped toward the Ye Residence.</p><p>Ye Residence…</p><p>Ye Chen’s brows creased. A few hundred li away, a blood light was shuttling straight toward Ye Residence. From its aura, Ye Chen could guess that it was Master Blood Sword, who was equally as famous as Master Sky Sword.</p><p>“If they keep on coming, it’ll be so annoying.” Ye Chen no longer had any mood to duel with his opponent.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>With a drawing gesture of his fingers, the green longsword left the sheath and shot in the sky.</p><p>Master Blood Sword’s speed was high, moving dozens of li with every flicker. When he arrived within two hundred li of Ye Residence, he suddenly felt vigilant before drawing his sword and slashing out.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>A flying sword suddenly appeared before and struck his sword. The immense impact made him retreat a hundred steps with a stumbling figure.</p><p>“Defensive Sword Art! Who is it?” Master Blood Sword turned pale.</p><p>“Master Blood Sword, go back! You’re not my opponent.” Ye Chen’s voice could be heard coming from the surroundings.</p><p>“You’re Ye Chen?” Master Blood Sword was bewildered and puzzled.</p><p>“Precisely!”</p><p>“Humph! If you think you can make me walk away with just one strike, there would be no Master Blood Sword in the world.” Master Blood Sword was furious.</p><p>“If you don’t walk away, you can leave by lying on your back!”</p><p>Ye Chen was not courteous at all. He immediately made the flying sword attack Master Blood Sword. Although the huge distance did weaken the power of the strikes, its might was still far above Situ Hao’s.</p><p>Clang Clang Clang Clang!</p><p>It was also fortunate since Master Blood Sword was barely able to resist the strikes. However, after every exchange, he could feel his blood and Qi rampaging, making him feel dizzy and turning his line of sight illusory.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>Greatly alarmed, Master Blood Sword waved the longsword in his hand, weaving a sword net.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>The green longsword pierced the sword net and thrust at Master Blood Sword’s chest.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Spurting out a mouthful of blood, Master Blood Sword was struck speechless. His opponent was actually controlling the sword from more than a hundred li! What kind of realm had he reached?</p><p>Swish!</p><p>The green longsword once again appeared before Master Blood Sword and thrust in.</p><p>“Leave!”</p><p>Master Blood Sword no longer had the courage to face Ye Chen. Blocking the flying sword with his sword, he spurted a mouthful of blood once again. Taking advantage of the impact, he flew back much faster than he’d come; his figure seemed battered and exhausted.</p><p>“That old guy didn’t fool me.”</p><p>Master Blood Sword was incomparably sullen. Even without seeing the person, he was scared off. When had he, the mighty Master Blood Sword, been humiliated in this manner?</p><p>“Humph! Master Sky Sword suffered, and I suffered even more. Then, why not instigate Master Demon Sword and have him suffer as well?” Master Blood Sword thought maliciously.</p><p>Chasing out Master Blood Sword, the green longsword returned to its sheath.</p><p>“There shouldn’t be any trouble from now on.” Slowly letting out a breath, Ye Chen said inwardly.</p><p>…</p><p>The news of Ye Chen defeating Master Sky Sword quickly propagated through the mouths of spectators. The speed of propagation increased exponentially every day. Of course, regardless of how fast mouth-to-mouth propagation was, it couldn’t be faster than the Knowledge Pavilion’s propagation. It should be known that every city had a branch of the organization. It was not just for the promotion of organization, but the tools to spread simple messages.</p><p>Therefore, merely after a week, the news about the battle between Ye Chen and Master Sky Sword arrived in the Sky Martial Region. Those who were looking forward to seeing the Knowledge Pavilion and Ye Chen make a fool of themselves were dumbstruck, almost not daring to believe their ears. Master Sky Sword, a peak sword artist from a hundred years ago, lost to Ye Chen and had to return; it was indeed too astonishing. Was there still any sword artist in the Sea of Soul realm under the heavens who could defeat Ye Chen?</p><p>The title of Sword Master was now set in stone.</p><p>It was a pity that nobody knew that Ye Chen had defeated Master Blood Sword from a hundred li away. The latter would also not spread this shameful affair on his own accord. Otherwise, the Sky Martial Region would be in an even bigger uproar.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
