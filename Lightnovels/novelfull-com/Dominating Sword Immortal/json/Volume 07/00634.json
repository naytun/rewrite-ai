Besides the top five young warriors and other warriors such as Du Gujue, there were fifteen to sixteen of them, most of them being foreign. However, judging from their attacking style, they should not be weaker than Lin Tian and Lan Xieqing at all. Some of them were even stronger.</p><p>Seeing Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng arrive, some of them turned their heads to glance, including Yan Fengfeng and Chu Zhongtian. The former nodded to them as greeting before going back to her attack on the palace protective layer.</p><p>“Let’s join in!”</p><p>Ye Chen took out his gold sword, shooting out a sword qi at the green light layer. Meanwhile, Murong Qingcheng followed right behind him, throwing out a punch.</p><p>Boom! Pow! Boom! Pow! Boom! Pow! …</p><p>With all twenty of them fighting together, the green light cover seemed to get a bit loose, and the surface of the layer started to vibrate. Even after that onslaught, it was still standing and looking as if it could last for a long while.</p><p>Earlier on, everyone was all thinking about saving Zhen yuan; but as time passed, they started to realize one by one that it would be truly wasting their Zhen yuan if it went on like this. They might as well perform their top attacks, taking down this light layer instantly.</p><p>Right then, it was still Bai Wuxue who stood out to talk to the rest of them, “Everyone should know pretty clearly now that if we do not use our ace attacks, I don’t think we can break it through by the end of today. How about this? I will count down on three, then we all do it at the same time, throwing out our best attacks. Anyone disagrees?”</p><p>“I agree.”</p><p>“No problems.”</p><p>“Let’s do it your way.”</p><p>Bai Wuxue’s motion had been supported by all of them.</p><p>Hearing them, Bai Wuxue nodded, “Alright! Everyone, prepare yourself! On the mark, one…!”</p><p>“Two!”</p><p>“Three!”</p><p>After that, all twenty-something of them performed their top attacks. A massive ancient tree appeared in front of Bai Wuxue, with only one branch on it and having a green light radiate from the main branch. It poked right onto the light layer, exploding out a bright green light.</p><p>Xia Houzun performed his Star Nuclear Finger Attack with both of his hands. Two massive finger powers shot out, dragging out a beautiful flame in the air before landing onto the layer.</p><p>Lu Shaoyou took a deep breath, performing sixteen sword attacks in a row, with each of them containing the power to shatter a mountain.</p><p>Xiao Chuhe held onto his blade with both his hands; he groaned as all of the muscles on both of his arms tightened. Then, he threw out a blade attack onto the light layer as if he was trying to part an ocean.</p><p>Godly Shark Princess, who was the most mysterious of them all, threw out a punch without changing her expression at all, but still somehow looking extra aggressive.</p><p>Ye Chen, who was at the far end, did not try to play it through. Of course, he would not use his most powerful attack; instead, he performed his Gold Resonant Radiance Sword Attack. A pile of sword qi mixed with gold light was thrown out, cutting onto the green layer aggressively and shattering all of the green light.</p><p>Besides her Sky Demon Finger Art, Murong Qingcheng did not have any top attacks. Since it could burn out her power, so she would not waste it here. She threw out a palm attack instead, which accompanied Ye Chen’s attack and landed onto the green light layer.</p><p>As for the rest of them, they all performed out their top attacks at once, including Yan Fengfeng, Du Gujue, Dantai Mingyue and Beiming Hui, who were also outstanding figures. Amongst those of who were rather foreign, some of them were also extremely powerful, attracting some of the other warriors’ attention.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>With twenty of them performing their best attacks, the power generated was unbelievable. Without any exaggeration, the green light layer started to vibrate drastically all of a sudden and then twisted rapidly. After a huge sound followed by a massive explosion, the layer was taken down, disappearing into nothingness.</p><p>“It is done!”</p><p>Seeing that the green light layer had been shattered, everyone’s expression was relieved.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Xia Houzun was the first to react again. The second the green light layer was taken down, he had already turned into a beam of golden light shooting inside the front door.</p><p>Seeing that, half of the rest of them did not think before activating their Zhen yuan and turning into beams of light, flying within.</p><p>Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!</p><p>It was right then when six crystal light ball appeared out of nowhere and lined up in a row. After a slight vibration, beams of blade qi were shot out. With all six of them shooting out at the same time, the quantity of the qi blade was incredible, such that it could even blind a normal person’s eyes.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>Without enough time to react, Xia Houzun was hit by seven qi blade attacks at once. They were extremely powerful, way more so than those treasure lights in the third floor world. It was almost the same as eighty percent of top master level warrior’s attacking power. Even if it were Xia Houzun, he was blown back for more than ten steps, his face turning a little pale.</p><p>Seeing that there were more to come, Xia Houzun finally started to look serious.</p><p>“Draw Power!”</p><p>His finger shot out a beam of qi as he drew a circle around his body. With that, a see-through space vibration was brought out before attaching onto his body, blocking out the qi blades. With the extra protection, he activated his Zhen yuan and pushed through to enter the palace.</p><p>The ones that followed behind him were not that lucky. They had to escape from the way they came out, looking messed up.</p><p>“Everyone, be careful!”</p><p>Bai Wuxue was still nice as he reminded the people behind him before flashing his body to enter the palace. When the qi blade attacked him madly, he blocked all of them out with his shield. Without a scratch, he was the second one to enter the palace.</p><p>Soon, Lu Shaoyou and Xiao Chuhe also entered.</p><p>It was actually Ye Chen’s first time seeing Godly Shark Princess do anything. She actually managed to use her protective Zhen yuan alone to enter the palace. It was unbelievable how powerful her defense was.</p><p>“Ye Chen, excuse me!”</p><p>Yan Fengfeng’s speed was widely-kwon. She turned into a beam of blue flame and traveled between the gaps of the qi blades. During that time, she clawed one or two qi blades that got in her way, shattering them completely before eventually entering the palace.</p><p>Soon, more and more people managed to enter the palace. Du Gujue, Dantai Mingyue, and Beiming Hui had all entered; some of the powerful foreign young warriors managed to enter as well. There were only less than ten of them left outside.</p><p>“Let’s go in! Follow behind me!”</p><p>If Murong Qingcheng used her demon power essence, those qi blades would be nothing for her. But, Ye Chen naturally would not let her use it.</p><p>Ting! Ting! Dang! Dang!</p><p>Next, something strange happened. Ye Chen and Murong Qingcheng flew through the main door with one in the front and another following behind. Ye Chen’s sword art was unbelievably fast, such that it seemed impossible to see his movements, while Murong Qingcheng followed behind him like a black shadow.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The second they approached the main door, Murong Qingcheng flapped her black bat wings before flashing into the palace.</p><p>Seeing that she had made it in, Ye Chen turned into a beam of sword light, stepping between the qi blades effortlessly and making into the palace.</p><p>“What! Using sword art to block out the qi blades?”</p><p>The remaining eight young warriors who were slightly weaker did not believe what had just happened, since the qi blades were already unbelievably fast. While the rest of them all relied on their defense power when they tried to make it through, Ye Chen was the only who used his sword art.</p><p>Lin Tian was looking upset. He knew that it might be impossible now to try and redeem himself from Ye Chen. He now knew that he would never be able to catch up with the latter’s progress.</p><p>Lan Xieqing, who had also lost to Ye Chen, squinted his eyes; no one knew what he was thinking.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
