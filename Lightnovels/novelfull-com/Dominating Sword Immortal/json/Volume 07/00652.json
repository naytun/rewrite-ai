He now gave people the feeling that he had come from hell to harvest his revenge. That despairing qi covered the whole area, and that horrifying blade intent could even frighten wandering ghosts.</p><p>“Interesting!”</p><p>Xiao Chuhe’s long blade continued to bounce as that intrigued impression on his face could not be more obvious. Du Gujue’s power had indeed exceeded his expectations; but of course, it was only a slight surprise, since it would be rather hard to shock him with only blade intent.</p><p>“Let’s see your and Ye Chen’s battle first then. I hope Ye Chen can last a bit longer.” After relaxing, Xiao Chuhe knew that the battle between Lu Shaoyou and him might have to be delayed.</p><p>Lu Shaoyou looked at Du Guju with a strange look and thought to himself, ‘With the blade intent alone, he has already made it to the front. I wonder what his real power would look like.’</p><p>With the blade intent being so powerful, his strength would not be weak for sure. However, it would not be used as the only reference of power, which should be an overall performance of a warrior. Besides the most important cultivation, will power, and profound which could be improved through training, it would also take battling experience and talent.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The white light flashed once and Lu Shaoyou appeared by the lake.</p><p>Facing such powerful blade intent with negative emotions, Ye Chen looked just the same as he said, “Du Gujue, if you are thinking about using your blade intent to scare me, then I am afraid that you will be quite disappointed.”</p><p>“Indeed!”</p><p>Du Gujue put away his blade intent. Amongst all of the top young warriors, it might be only Ye Chen whom he could not read. Before, he had already foreseen this kind of result. But, he decided to give it a shot regardless, because only by trying could he make a decision.</p><p>“How could there be such horrifying blade intent? I almost lost control.”</p><p>“Me too!”</p><p>Those of who were rather closer with them looked quite pale and shocked.</p><p>“This guy is indeed a monster level martial genius. Once he enters the Life and Death Realm, he will become a very scary king level warrior. Perhaps, he would even be the second Evil King.” Xu Yuan complemented.</p><p>Xie Baiting said, “If he could make it into the Life and Death Realm, he would not be weaker than the Evil King when he was at his age. I actually think that he might walk down a whole different path.” The Evil King had reached the Life and Death Realm about fifty years ago. Back then, he was also a famous martial genius. If it were not for Mysterious Queen, he might have been the strongest martial geniuses of the whole land in the past one thousand year.</p><p>“Yeah!” Xu Yuan nodded and said, “That girl from Dantai family is also rather full of potential. I wonder if this Ye Chen is as powerful as his reputation.”</p><p>Indeed, Ye Chen’s cultivation speed was not something that everyone could compete with. But, he was still not as famous as Du Gujue and Dantai Mingyue after all, since the two had been like this for a long time, and had never disappointed anyone before. Therefore, being regarded as a powerful martial genius was both full of honor but also pressure. Xu Yuan did not think highly of Ye Chen actually, since it would not be easy to be a top warrior in his opinion. Only people who could maintain it for a long time could truly be considered worthy.</p><p>“I am afraid that Ye Chen will lose.”</p><p>Du Gujue’s change had shocked Xie Baiting. Before, he was thinking rather highly of Ye Chen, since he had walked out of the South Rudra Region, which was very low as a starting point. It made Ye Chen’s growth even more valuable. However, Du Gujue was able to catch up and display this kind of explosive power, which meant that he was just as talented a martial genius.</p><p>“The battle between us might have to be delayed.”</p><p>What was surprising for everyone was that Du Gujue did not battle Ye Chen immediately, and Ye Chen looked like he was expecting it as well somehow.</p><p>Turning around, Du Gujue looked over at Xiao Chuhe, “Xiao Chuhe, you and I are both blade artists. There can only be one No.1 blade artist. So, you will be have to be the opponent that I have to beat.”</p><p>Then, he said to Ye Chen again, “Ye Chen, I will battle with you with my new No.1 blade artist title. I hope you will not disappoint me.” The others had made the top five young warriors as their targets while Du Gujue had set his eyes on Ye Chen. Only Ye Chen could threaten him, while the others would only be temporary targets.</p><p>Once he said that, everyone was shocked.</p><p>Was he arrogant or just confident in his power?</p><p>Without a doubt, compared to Du Gujue, Beiming Hui was slightly lacking. Before the battle between Beiming Hui and Xiao Chuhe, although he sounded a bit arrogant as well, but he still seemed rather scared of the other. But, when Du Gujue made his statement, he was so calm as if he was even more powerful than Xiao Chuhe.</p><p>“Disrespectful!”</p><p>Xiao Chuhe obviously did not expect that Du Gujue would challenge him first. But, it was not important; it was actually his tone that had aggravated him. As one of the top five young warriors, he had been through so much, and it was his first time being looked down upon.</p><p>“Alright, I will wait for you.”</p><p>Before he could calm himself down, Ye Chen’s answer normal sounding arose as well. Even though it did not sound arrogant or blindly confident, it was indeed that kind of attitude which had shocked everyone. The idiots could understand that Ye Chen was implying that Xiao Chuhe would definitely be beaten by Du Gujue.</p><p>Xiao Chuhe had already displayed such horrifying power. If Du Gujue was able to beat Xiao Chuehe, then his power would be beyond imagination. And somehow, Ye Chen still had the confidence to say that.</p><p>“Arrogant!”</p><p>Lu Shaoyou mumbled to himself. But, no one would know whom he was referring to.</p><p>Xu Yuan frowned as he forced a smile at Xie Baiting and then said, “The young men now are really forgetting their manners.”</p><p>“Watch on. The truth and the reasoning would sure reveal itself.” Xie Baiting touched his sword.</p><p>In everyone’s vision, Ye Chen lowered his eyelids and looked extremely calm. The reason he said those things naturally was not because he was arrogant. To be honest, if Du Gujue could not beat Xiao Chuhe, then there would be no point in fighting with him at all. It would be boring for him to even think about it.</p><p>Chin!</p><p>Taking out his long blade, Du Gujue pointed the tip of the blade at Xiao Chuhe and said with a loud voice, “Let’s do this!”</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Xiao Chuhe stomped on the ground as if they were waves of water, reaching above the lake immediately and standing in front of Du Gujue in the air.</p><p>“Beiming Hui had said those words to me, but he lost. I will say the same thing to you. If you want to challenge us, it is still too early” Controlling his temper, Xiao Chuhe said with a low voice.</p><p>“Whether I am early or not, you will soon find out.”</p><p>“Alright, I will see what kind of power you have.”</p><p>It was not until later in the battle between him and Beiming Hui when he used his real power. But now, that almighty power that was being emitted from his body was so horrifying as if there were millions of war horses running directly at one. Both of his eyes started to get red. A lot of people knew it clearly that he had been pissed off, and would use all of his power right from the beginning now.</p><p>“Very good!” Du Gujue nodded.</p><p>“Now, lose!”</p><p>Taking out that long blade with white light shining from it, Xia Chuhe held his blade with both of his hands. He threw out an attack from above, and the white blade light intensified by a hundred times immediately as if it was a blade from the heavens. The surface of the lake could no longer handle the pressure as it bent the surface of the lake.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>Waving his long blade once, Du Gujue bounced back the incoming blade light while standing exactly where he was before and speaking coldly, “Xiao Chuhe, since I have the confidence to beat you, then I surely would have my reasons. This blade is way too weak. Bring on everything you have got.”</p><p>Gasp!</p><p>Everyone present there gasped. Although that blade attack from Xiao Chuhe was not his deadliest attack, but for a second, the blade speed had reached an incomprehensible level. At the same time, that attack Du Gujue preformed to bounce away that blade attack was not a killing attack either. Therefore, it was rather clear that Du Gujue had gotten the upper hand in the first exchange.</p><p>Ahh!</p><p>Xiao Chuhe yelled once into the sky and then shot out toward Du Gujue, performing forty nine blade attacks all at once, carrying a power that could easily break through mountains. With his title as a top five young warrior, a normal warrior would get scared before the blade attacks could even arrive.</p><p>But unfortunately, his opponent was Du Gujue.</p><p>Slightly squinting his eyes, the white blade in Du Gujue’s hand emitted a white light, with a world reflected within. That despairing qi spread out in the whole area, but something seemed to be different this time. The despairing qi had more than just the effect to manipulate people’s minds; it seemed to also affect Du Gujue as his power seemed to grow with the despairing qi.</p><p>Some people would lose their entire battling intent within that despairing atmosphere while others could gain a kind of power that they never experienced before. Even if it were a normal blade attack, it could contain the power that could cut through everything.</p><p>With this kind of despairing blade intent, Du Gujue closed himself up in that cave. He had experienced even more extreme despair, which helped him realize that if he wanted to make his opponent feel the despair, he would have to feel it himself as well. Only when inside the despair could one utilize the power perfectly.</p><p>Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang! Dang!</p><p>Countless blade lights clashed together as Du Gujue’s battle with Xiao Chuhe entered the next level. It was an intense fight, and all people could see was the white blade light in the air. It was so bright that it was impossible to see their bodies anymore, as if they had been fused into the light.</p><p>“Using despairing blade intent to guide his blade art!” Ye Chen studied the fight that took place in front of him, drowning in his own thoughts.</p><p>Different people took different paths in martial arts. Even if they were all training sword arts, some people might use the sword as a weapon that made them not so different from a normal warrior, while others would use it more to understand the profound behind everything. Only a rare few people could have the sword intent and would train it as their main focus. The kind of martial arts created on the foundation of sword intent were extremely powerful. For example, the Double Sword King had gotten the killing sword intent in his attacks. And although his attacks were similar to the rest of the world, but they contained such powerful killing intent as if they were just created to kill things. Since Ye Chen had followed his path, he could not be clearer about things like this.</p><p>However, Ye Chen was different from all of them, since he had chosen to take on the pure sword art path, which combined both the profound and sword intent. Of course, that sword in his hand was no longer the physical sword but that sword in his mind and heart. As long as the sword artist’s heart sword was still there, he or she would never stop moving forward. That sword in his hand had been through so much over his journey.</p><p>He slowly realized that the sword intent was created by the sword, and in other words, by the one sword in a sword artist’s mind and heart. Without the sword there, without the sword in hand, it would be impossible to create sword intent at all.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
