However, when Yao Yifeng used the snail previously, every single detail was observed by Ye Chen through his powerful soul power.</p><p>“Yao Yifeng, didn’t expect you really will be the traitor.”</p><p>Xu Danian and Wu Chuan were furious. Their eyes turned crimson.</p><p>“Wei…”</p><p>Yao Yifeng’s lost his head out of fear and hurriedly turned towards Azure Dragon Hall Leader Wei Longtao.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>With a flash, Wei Longtao’s slapped Yao Yifeng’s forehead, and his head exploded on the spot.</p><p>When Yao Yifeng’s head exploded, Ye Che clearly saw disbelief flashed in his eyes, as if he couldn’t believe Wei Longtao would dare to kill him.</p><p>Not just Yao Yifeng, Xu Danian, Wu Chuan, and even Ye Chen didn’t dare believe. This was because Wei Longtao didn’t have the authority to kill Yao Yifeng. Normally, he would have sent Yao Yifeng to headquarters to be interrogated by Elders Association.</p><p>“Hall Leader Wei, what do you think you’re doing?”</p><p>Ye Chen’s expression turned cold.</p><p>Wei Longtao’s expression was also cold,”Because of him my Dragon Gold Celestial Palace lost nearly a thousand men. I already said before that if I found out the traitor, I’ll personally kill him. Now that it’s confirmed that he was the traitor, how could I leave him? Do you have something to say about that Deputy Ye?”</p><p>“Of course, I do. First, you don’t have the authority to kill head attendant of Dragon God Celestial Palace, because he probably as some other secrets. Second, you killed him so decisively, is it because you were afraid of what he will say something implicating? After all, before he died, he said your surname.”</p><p>Ye Chen looked straight at Wei Longtao.</p><p>“There are many surnamed Wei, I don’t think he called out for me.”</p><p>Wei Longtao’s expression turned gloomy.</p><p>“You still haven’t answered my question.</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t back down in the slightest.</p><p>Beside Ye Chen and Wei Longtao, Xu Danian and Wu Chuan were getting increasingly nervous. Wei Longtao was Azure Hall Leader, who had been accumulating power for a long time. Although they were deputies, they would never dare go directly against him. He was a well-known harsh and ruthless character. On the other hand, even though Ye Chen seemed young, he was not one bit less vicious. In Blood Battle Ocean, the scene of him leading hundreds of troops and killing through the enemy’s formation was still vivid in their minds. Even just now, he’d snapped off Yao Yifeng’s palm without any hesitation. Thus, the situation made them quite nervous.</p><p>They stood against each other in confrontation. Their eyes drawing blades against each other.</p><p>“Hall Leader, Deputy Ye, why don’t we sit down and have a proper discussion. There is no need to get angry.” Xu Danian tried to resolve the situation.</p><p>“That’s right. Anything can be solved by words, and if we can’t come to a consensus, there are still higher-ups. You don’t have to drive a wedge between yourselves due to Yao Yifeng.”</p><p>Wu Chuan was considered to one with quite a fiery temperament. However, before Ye Chen and Wei Longtao, these two ruthless individuals, he didn’t dare reveal any of it.</p><p>Ye Chen spoke without glancing at them,”Gentlemen, both of you clearly saw Hall Leader Wei killing Yao Yifeng in a hurry. He is clearly hiding something. Yao Yifeng said the word “Wei” and looked at Hall Leader Wei. It’s impossible for you to not take notice.”</p><p>Ye Chen was not a detective, nor an authoritative figure well-versed in game schemes. He was Ye Chen, a sword artist, and nowadays also a Sword Master. He’d his own way of handling matters. He didn’t have to act only when the entire truth came to light. He didn’t have much energy to waste on making numerous investigations. As long as he had fifty percent certainty that there was something wrong, he wouldn’t back down, not to mention, Wei Longtao had killed Yao Yifeng in his presence. Thus, it was a completely different matter.</p><p>In short, his goal was to reach the peak of sword dao, not to engage in games of schemes and plots. He was very clear on his main focus. As for why didn’t he act when he already suspected Yao Yifeng? That was because Yao Yifeng didn’t reveal much clues. He couldn’t apprehend him and declare him a mole just because his expression felt a little strange to him. Such conduct wouldn’t be well received by anybody.</p><p>Wei Longtao’s conduct was problematic from every angle. He didn’t believe that a majestic hall leader would be unable to control his emotions, and most importantly, Yao Yifeng looked towards and him and said his surname before dying. This was too suspicious.</p><p>“This….”</p><p>In reality, Xu Dinian and Wu Chuan were also suspicious of Wei Longtao. Unfortunately, they couldn’t rashly act before the truth came into light. They were not Wei Longtao’s opponent at all. They originally thought to resolve the current issue with words, then secretly deliver the news to Drago God Celestial Palace and let the higher-ups send someone to investigate. Unfortunately, Ye Chen was more wrathful than they thought and was not willing to take a single step back.</p><p>Wei Long Tao only spoke one line,”You should be clear that I’m Azure Dragon Hall Leader, and I run the business here. You don’t have the authority to question me.”</p><p>“Is that so? You also need to be clear that I’m Dragon God Envoy, and my status above yours. Not to mention you Azure Dragon Hall Leader, even if it were Elder Associations’ Great Elder, I wouldn’t tolerate him if I have enough reasons to suspect.”</p><p>Ye Chen’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>“You dare use Dragon God Envoy’s identity to suppress me?”</p><p>Wei Longtoa’s aura erupted. The air in the room turned heavy like quicksilver, and some objects inside directly exploded apart.</p><p>“Why will I not dare?”</p><p>“Good. Deputy Xu, Deputy Chu, apprehend Ye Chen for me, and the reason is simple, I believe him knowing the workings of Sound Transmitting Snail is certainly problematic.” Wei Longtao’s clenched his fists, and his gaze flickered several times before he resisted his desire to attack. He was extremely apprehensive of Ye Chen’s identity of Dragon God Envoy. Otherwise, he would have acted long ago and shown the latter immensity of heavens.</p><p>“Hall Leader Wei, please forgive us, we can’t carry out your commands.”</p><p>Xu Danian and Wu Chuan were not idiots. As long as they dared to act against Ye Chen, their conclusion would be extremely miserable. Their ability to actually apprehend him was secondary. The most important point was that they didn’t have the authority to apprehend Dragon God Envoy. This kind of matter would be tantamount to going against the entire palace. The Elders Association would certainly put them behind bars.</p><p>Of course, the two were not willing to obey Wei Lontao’s command.</p><p>“Humph!”</p><p>Wei Longtao was a little furious. Although he didn’t think Xu Danian and Wu Chuan would dare to act against Ye Chen, he didn’t expect them to refute to bluntly. It was an act of provocation towards him. If it had been before, he would have absolutely not tolerated it and made an example out of it to warn others.</p><p>“I will say it again. Yao Yifeng was a traitor and there is nothing wrong with me killing me. If you think there is a problem, have the higher-ups come and investigate me.”</p><p>Wei Longtao turned around to leave. He’d piled massive war achievements for the palace. He didn’t believe that the palace would blame him for killing Yao Yifeng. Thus, what could Ye Chen do?</p><p>“Hehe!”</p><p>With a soft laugh, Ye Chen’s aura congealed, instantly slicing through quicksilver like air of the room. The next moment, a frightening sword aura burst out, surrounding Wei Longtao.</p><p>“Hall Leader Wei, my apologies. As Dragon God Envoy, I’ll have to apprehend you and take you back to the palace. If you have something to say, say it before Elders Association.”</p><p>Saying these words, Ye Chen stepped forward and reached out to grab Wei Longtao.</p><p>Peng!</p><p>Wei Longtao turned around and swatted at Ye Chen. The energy radiated instantly caused the room’s wall to twist.</p><p>“Ye Chen, don’t think that you are Dragon God Envoy or a monstrous genius on the continent, and thus, can look down on everybody. Now I’ll let you know what is regret,:</p><p>Wei Longtao was furious.</p><p>‘Whether I’ll regret or not, it”ll have nothing to do with you.”</p><p>Te Chen acted first. With a ghost like speed, he instantly arrived before Wei Longtao and issued a palm strike on Wei Longtao, who was somewhat caught off-guard.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The entire secret room cracked down, dust and smoke flying all around.,</p><p>Amidst thick smoke, two figures flew out one after another. Afterwards, Xu Danian and Wu Chuan rushed out, looking wretched.</p><p>“Actually hit him…”</p><p>Xu Danian was still in somewhat of a disbelief.</p><p>“Brother Xu, do you think Hall Leader Wei is problematic or not?” Wu Chuan asked.</p><p>Xu Danian pondered for a few moments,”Problematic.”</p><p>“Seems like both of us are on the same page. Originally I didn’t think Hall Leader could be problematic, but his recent actions are too suspicious. It’s nothing like his calm-headed self. However, I didn’t expect Ye Chen would decide to confront him head on.</p><p>“Perhaps he didn’t bother thinking much!”</p><p>“But Hall Leader’s strength is deep immeasurable. Ye Chen is a bit impulsive to act like this. He might get himself injured.”</p><p>“First let’s see how it goes. If it comes to worst, we’ll throw caution to the wind and help Ye Chen.”</p><p>Xu Danian owed Ye Chen his life and was determined to stand by his side.</p><p>Bang Bang Bang!</p><p>The night sky of Azure Dragon Island was illuminated by bright lights. It seemed like day, but also a mystical multi-colored world.</p><p>“Ye Chen, you’re merely a genius in my eyes. You probably don’t know how the immensity of the heavens and earth. Today, I’ll thoroughly make you aware, and let you know that your so-called strength is not worth anything, Demonic Bull Mountain Crushing Art.”</p><p>Wei Longtao’s cultivation base not considered too high and was merely at late Sea of Soul realm. However, he was actually a body refiner expert, and he cultivated the secret art of the Secret Pavilion’s second floor, Demonic Bull Mountain Crushing Art. It was a low heaven grade secret technique that could multiply physical strength.</p><p>“What a powerful fleshy body!”</p><p>Just now the exchange between him and Wei Longtao gave him quite a fright. Usually, third step spirit body was already peak for Sea of Soul realm experts. However, Wei Longtao had cultivated his spirit body to fourth step. If he’d not refined it by usual means, he must have refined large quantities of spirit energy crystals. It was Ye Chen’s first time seeing a spirit body raised to the fourth step. No wonder he could seat the throne of Azure Dragon Hall. his strength really went against the heavens. He was even stronger than Master Sky Sword.</p><p>With the strength of Demonic Ox Mountain Crushing Art internally and powerful Zhen Yuan externally, Wei Longtao’s body flickered, choosing to fight Ye Chen in close combat. His mighty palm pressed down, carrying boundless strength.</p><p>Clank!</p><p>Ye Chen unsheathed Thunder Calamity Sword and faced him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
