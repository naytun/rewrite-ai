He raised the Gold Sword, with the thunder energy charging up the sword’s tip from the hilt. The entire sword seemed to have turned into a lightning bolt, and its tip was crackling in his hands to discharge off, but staying firmly packed together.</p><p>“You dare!” Lin Tian roared!</p><p>Crackle!</p><p>Disregarding Lin Tian, Ye Chen slashed down.</p><p>After Sky Thunder Cut went from a hundred percent completion to a hundred and ten percent, it was no longer a sword light, but lightning itself. Only a thunderbolt could be seen striking down, landing straight on Mu Yunhai’s back. The latter’s body was completely charred, his body shooting off and landing on the restaurant’s roof. Then, it slowly slid down, arriving beside Duan Lengya.</p><p>“What kind of divine power is this?”</p><p>Lin Kui already knew Ye Chen. However, after both he and Mu Yunhe had suffered by his hands, he felt as if he was seeing Ye Chen for the first time.</p><p>“This kid is not that easy to push around. Duan Lengya and Mu Yunhe seem to have picked a hard bone to chew this time. That’s right, I still don’t even know his name.”</p><p>“From his appearance, he seems to be twenty-something years old, and ought to have entered Sea of Soul realm long ago. There are only three individuals to enter the Sea of Soul realm at such a young age. We’ve seen both Du Gujue and Tantai Mingyue, so that leaves only one person…He ought to be Ye Chen.”</p><p>“Ye Chen? That monster Ye Chen who had recently risen in Sky Martial Region?”</p><p>“Three monsters have gathered in Sky Martial City. The upcoming days will be lively.” Some of the spectators sighed.</p><p>In the air, Lin Tian and Ye Chen stood a hundred steps apart, measuring each other.</p><p>“Good, you’ve successfully enraged me. Take my blade!”</p><p>Lin Tian’s whole body seemed like a flying blade as he rapidly closed in. When he reached about ten meters from Ye Chen, he fiercely chopped, holding his blade with both his hands, The profound sense this strike comprised of was not high at all, even worse compared to Ye Chen. However, Lin Tian never relied on Zhen Yuan or profound sense; he relied on the frightening strength that he was so proud of.</p><p>“Run for me!”</p><p>Gigantic rumbling explosions echoed as the blade light suddenly made its appearance.</p><p>“Not really!”</p><p>Similarly holding the Gold Sword with both hands, Ye Chen’s right foot stepped out. His body lowered, making the center of gravity much more stable, while the Dragon power in his cells, bones, and blood erupted forth like a volcano, pouring into his two hands. With a roar, the golden sword chopped down fiercely, meeting his opponent.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>An ear-deafening sound erupted. This sound could no longer be described in terms of the sounds of the world; the closest sound would be two metal meteorites refined in sky fires bombarding into each other. The frightening energy created was not muffled at all. The moment it was produced, it squeezed the surroundings, seeming as if the entire surrounding space would be torn apart.</p><p>The sky above the city transformed, seeming as if it had turned into a transparent lake. The ripples on the lake’s surface spread out, making the entire city dazzle with a variety of colors and seem like an illusion.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Neither Ye Chen nor Lin Tian could bear the enormous counterforce, so they both retreated in the air, their bones creaking as they dispelled the energy.</p><p>“As expected, a body-refining expert!”</p><p>Ye Chen retreated a few hundred meters before being able to completely dispel the energy. Ripples spread out underneath his feet, giving off the illusion of blooming lotuses.</p><p>“Removing the Zhen Yuan, profound, will, as well as artifacts, his strength should be five hundred and fifty thousand jin…six hundred thousand is unlikely. His physical strength is more or less the same as mine—a rank three spirit body. Seems like his constitution is better than mine.”</p><p>As a rank three spirit body himself. Ye Chen’s limit was four hundred thousand jin, whereas the latter’s was five hundred and fifty thousand, or even more. In this aspect, it was a big loss for Ye Chen.</p><p>Of course, Ye Chen was different from him. The latter specialized in strength, whereas he specialized in Zhen Yuan. In terms of profound sense as well as will, Ye Chen was far better.</p><p>“Offensive power more than mine?”</p><p>Lin Tian had retreated far more than Ye Chen, about five hundred meters.</p><p>“Demon Tiger Secret Blood Art!”</p><p>Without any hesitation, Lin Tian unleashed an art that overdrew his physical strength and vitality. It was a powerful art that allowed him to break past the limits of his body, granting him a much higher strength. The human body was filled with boundless mysteries; even an old lady, when erupting with her body’s potential, could carry a huge sack of rice, much less a Body Refiner.</p><p>Flushed red patterns covered Lin Tian’s entire body and face, giving off a fierce, bloody aura. Blue veins bulged in his arms like small slithering snakes as he tightly clenched the blade in his hands. His pupils shrank as he stared Ye Chen, who was seven-eight hundred meters away.</p><p>‘Eh! His Essence Qi is giving off a bloody glow. A vitality-overdrawing art…These kinds of arts are only found on barbarians. Didn’t expect Lin Tian to have one as well.’ Ye Chen didn’t dare to be careless. His right hand held the Gold Sword while his left hand instantly moved to his waist.</p><p>“Demon Tiger Blade!”</p><p>Lin Tian had adventured through the Barbaric Territories, and fortunately obtained a vitality-overdrawing art. Relying on this art, he had even exchanged blows with one of the five young tyrants, Xiao Chuhe. Although he was defeated in the fourth move, it should be known that before using this art, he couldn’t even withstand one move. However, the aftermath of using this technique were too severe. Moreover, he didn’t have a barbarian’s physique. Therefore, he wouldn’t use this art unless absolutely needed. This was the third time he was using this art. He had to defeat Ye Chen; otherwise, the entire Sky Martial City would know of his defeat. He absolutely couldn’t allow to be defeated by a junior at this stage.</p><p>This art was a technique used to stimulate and overdraft one’s potential. It had an additional blade move, which used the strength of the entire body and condensed it together, beheading the opponent in one move.</p><p>Woosh!</p><p>As he raised his speed to the limits, Lin Tian’s entire body seemed to have turned into a demonic tiger, the flushed red patterns on his face looking extremely sinister. The long blade in his blade cleaved through the air, and a blood-colored blade light flashed like a blood-red thunderbolt.</p><p>“It’s my win!” Lin Tian roared.</p><p>“I don’t think so!”</p><p>Ye Chen lightly leaned over, lowering his body like a huge coiling dragon that was about to strike. Holding the Gold Sword completely erect and raising the longsword in his other hand obliquely, Ye Chen charged forth. As he faced Lin Tian’s strike, the two swords perfectly crisscrossed about each other, and lightning bolts illuminated the entire city.</p><p>Clang Clang!</p><p>Two swords and one blade collided resolutely, unrelentingly discharging a berserk energy. The owners of the swords and blade fiercely glared each other while the muscles on their arms swelled to their limits.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
