Each category would have its strongest warrior—for example, the Blade Master, the Spear Master, etc. However, the fact was that the title Sword Master and Blade Master were the hardest ones to get, because there most people were training them while the other categories had less competition. Even so, there were not many people who were able to earn up the title. There were about ten of them in the whole world more or less.</p><p>In fact, the master level warriors who used swords or blades could have a No.1 warrior as well; if there were a real life and death battle, then the No.1 and No.2 would reveal themselves easily. But, no one would really dare to call themselves Sword Master or Blade Master, because once one had the title, it translated to disrespect toward many other top warriors. Without a doubt, countless challenges would be expected after that. If the power gap was not that drastic, then the situation would be changed immediately, and there would be nothing left save for embarrassment. Therefore, without an extreme advantage, no one would dare to call themselves Sword master or Blade master.</p><p>But, if one really wanted it, then he or she would have to win over everyone who argued against it.</p><p>Of course, even if the others admitted one’s Sword Master title, it would just be temporary. Once someone thought that they were powerful enough to challenge him or her, they would just come do it all over again.</p><p>In other words, the title was not only a massive honor, but a major trouble as well. After all, one was basically oppressing every sword artist there was in the world with that title, and there were bound to be people who did not agree. Consequently, one would be the enemy of every sword artist who wanted that title.</p><p>Ye Chen said, “The title of Sword Master is indeed the greatest temptation, but you cannot give me that title yet.”</p><p>Gao Changtian laughed, “I naturally cannot represent the world of people and give that title to you, but I do have the right and power to give a title to someone. As for whether you can keep it, that has nothing to do with me anymore. Plus, all I was asking was whether you would dare to take it. If you do not, then forget that I asked.”</p><p>“With Ye Chen’s personality, he should not be that reckless.” Li Daoxuan knew Ye Chen from before, so he thought that the other would not take over this ticking time bomb.</p><p>Yan Chihuo and Bing Ling nodded slightly in agreement as well.</p><p>“Alright. Since you ask me if I dare, how would I not dare? As of today, the Sword Master title will belong to me now.” A sharp light flashed though Ye Chen’s eyes as he said seriously.</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>Gao Changtian looked shocked. Although it was his suggestion, he had never expected the other to take it, and definitely not this comfortably without a hint of fear. It was as if this decision was not that big of a deal to him.</p><p>“So arrogant! Although he is indeed very powerful, the title of Sword Master is not something he can just have. How disrespectful! Just wait and see, he cannot keep it for that long.”</p><p>“The Sword Master title has not been given out for hundreds of years now. Perhaps in a couple of years, Ye Chen will grow to have the power to become one, but definitely not right now!”</p><p>“Indeed, it would not be hard to have this title, but it would be so hard to keep it. And, if he cannot, then he would just end up being the joke to the rest of the world.”</p><p>All of a sudden, everyone was excited, and some of the people who were supporting Ye Chen could not help but frown.</p><p>Most of the people thought that Ye Chen was just being young and reckless. On being tempted by Gao Changtian, he could not handle it and just took it, since this title was a top honor. Everyone would want to have the title; but without the power, it would just be a stupid liability.</p><p>Just beating Du Gujue did not mean he could beat every sword artist there was.</p><p>“Eh!”</p><p>Li Daoxuan and the other two were shocked. They thought that they knew Ye Chen, but now, they thought that they could not see through him at all.</p><p>“This…Did I hear it wrong?” Hai Wuya mumbled.</p><p>Yan Fengfeng thought about it, “We have been wrong about it all this time. This is the real Ye Chen.”</p><p>“He cannot resist the fame after all.” A cold light flashed though Lu Shaoyou’s eyes. He had gotten the title of Sword’s Master before; even though people addressed him as the Sword Master at times, everyone knew that there was the ‘s’ in between, and that he was not really the ‘Sword Master’. He could not help but sneer at Ye Chen deep down in his heart.</p><p>Standing next to him, Bai Wuxue shook his head, “I do not think so.”</p><p>Hearing him, Lu Shaoyou looked over at Bai Wuxue, who spoke slowly, “People without enough power would think that being the Sword Master was arrogant, but for people with enough power, it actually took bravery to do so. Without a doubt, Ye Chen has the power…Even those warriors who are older than two hundred fifty years and not in the ranking cannot win against him for sure. And in this situation, calling himself the Sword Master would need courage that normal people do not have. If he is too scared to take it, then that would be the disappointment…because he would be afraid, afraid that he cannot handle the title, afraid that he would lose. With that kind of fear, his sword heart would no longer be pure. As for fame, everyone would have some as they gained power. If they could not face it head on, then they cannot face themselves after all. Lu Shaoyou, I can tell that your sword art has started to wobble a bit at the appearance of Ye Chen. Only by regaining the stability of your sword art can you move onto the next level.”</p><p>Lu Shaoyou kept quiet. No one knew that he had lost to Bai Wuxue before, and he was the only one who knew the latter’s real power. Only he could tell that Bai Wuxue had not used all of his power during the battle with Xia Houzun.</p><p>“Mad man! How dare he take it!” Beiming Hui was freaking out a bit.</p><p>“If he can keep the title, I will not fight against him anymore.” Situ Hao had a different look on his face as he thought to himself.</p><p>“Ye Chen, the title of Sword Master…I think you should ask to take it back. I do not think you currently have the power to hold it.” Three people appeared.</p><p>They were the Fire sword master who ranked 29th, the Shattering Sword Master who ranked 33th, and the Shadow sword master who ranked 45th. Among the seventy-two people on the master level list, a dozen of them used swords.</p><p>Ye Chen said lightly, “With me being the Sword Master, why should I ask to take it back?”</p><p>The Shadow Sword Master took out the long sword and said, “Since that is the case, then would you dare to take ten attacks from us three? If you do not lose your upper hand within ten attacks, then us three will admit that you are the Sword Master.”</p><p>With three of them against him, it would be naturally not fair. Hence, they suggested ten attacks. Therefore, the people present would not be against it either, since it would not be actual competition. Instead, it would just be a small test to see whether Ye Chen had the power to be a sword master.</p><p>“No need to be this complicated. If I cannot beat you guys within ten attacks, then I will forget the whole thing.”</p><p>“Arrogant!”</p><p>The Fire Sword Master yelled madly as he threw out a fire element sword qi toward Ye Chen.</p><p>“Shatter Sword Thirty-Three!”</p><p>“Shadow Sword Spell!”</p><p>The other two performed their killing attacks as well.</p><p>“Sword Steps!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s body was like a beam of sword light as he flashed amidst the sword qi. The sword light flashed once and all of the attacks landed nowhere on him, not even touching Ye Chen’s protective Zhen yuan layer.</p><p>“The first attack!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s first target was the Shattering Sword Master who was the closest to him. He shook his wrist, and that gentle sword wind was about to blast his opponent.</p><p>“Back out!”</p><p>Fire Sword Master caught up with them as that bright red longsword of his drew a cross in the air. If Ye Chen did not back out, then even if he managed to beat his target, he would have to be hit by that sword attack as well. Naturally, he would then lose the upper hand of the battle.</p><p>Fighting against three was not something simple after all, and not losing at all would be even harder, since three of them attacked out at the same time. It meant that there would be three attacks out in the air at the same time. Being hit even the slightest bit would mean losing the bet; it was completely different from a life and death battle, so there would no fairness here.</p><p>But, they had obviously underestimated Ye Chen.</p><p>Taking back his longsword, Ye Chen jumped back. With his body in the air, a silver lighting appeared on his sword body. The lightning soon formed into a thunder ball before shooting itself out.</p><p>“Not good!”</p><p>The fire sword master and the shattering sword master both backed out quickly, both using their killing attacks at the incoming thunder ball.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The massive shockwaves with electricity spread out, blowing both warriors backward in the air as they puked out a mouthful of blood.</p><p>“Shadow Sword Attack!”</p><p>Right then, the Shadow Sword Master suddenly threw out an attack and dozens of shadowless, shapeless sword qi shot out toward Ye Chen.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Ye Chen had been watching out for him already, so he threw out dozens of sword attacks within the second all of a sudden. Dozens of gold pattern spread out, shattering Shadow Sword Master’s sword qi and wrapping him within.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>As a result, the Shadow Sword Master was blown away as well.</p><p>All three of them had been beaten.</p><p>In fact, Ye Chen did not have to use that much effort actually. All he needed to do was to use his gold fury, and he would be able to win against the three effortlessly. But, there was still a distance between the three, so it would have required him to perform three of those attacks, which would be pointless.</p><p>Plus, these three had no power to make him use his most powerful attack.</p><p>Blown back for hundreds of meters, Fire Sword Master looked very pale. He could not believe what had just happened. The three of them combined their power and could still not block out one sword attack of Ye Chen’s. It had proven that his power had reached the next level.</p><p>“I admit your Sword Master title, but this is only the opinion of us three.” Fire Sword Master took a deep breath and said.</p><p>Shadow Sword Master had got blood around his mouth as he spoke, “Even if we admit your title, it does not mean that those senior sword masters agree with us as well. You will have to know that Xu Yuan master, who was ranked second on the ranking, is so powerful. And according to my knowledge, there is still a Sky Sword Master, who is even more powerful than Xu Yuan. However, he is older than two hundred and fifty years, so he is not listed in the ranking. Besides those, there are also some of the powerful sword masters who have not come out for a long time now, including the Demon, Blood, and Evil Sword Master.”</p><p>The Shattering Sword Master Tu Yuan said, “Ye Chen, the title of Sword Master would be really hard to keep. Perhaps those senior warriors do not care for it, but the title makes them have to care. Do you know what I mean?”</p><p>Ye Chen said, “Since I dare to call myself the Sword Master, then I have prepared for taking on the challenges. They don’t dare, but I do. Your so-called Sky Sword Master, Demon Sword Master, or Blood Master…if they dare, then I will give them my title.”</p><p>“Well said!” Gao Changtian laughed while he thought to himself secretly, ‘This time, it is the Sword Master, and next would be the Blade Master. I hope Du Gujue will not let me down. I think the pavilion leader will not blame me for this. The ranking only includes warriors under two hundred and fifty years of age…What a bizarre rule! They should not have started this whole list if they did not want to do the hard work. As long as people have the power, they should all be listed in the ranking. Ah well, I don’t think it would happen for the next couple listings.”</p><p>Gao Changtian had not been agreeing with the whole thing with warriors above two hundred and fifty years old not being listed. He felt that it lost a big part of the meaning behind the listing. A lot of people knew that there were a lot of powerful warriors with age above two hundred and fifty years. Although they would be disturbed by this, what would be the point of battling at all if training in isolation was working for them? As for those rumors of having a weak body because of old age, it would just be a joke. Once cultivated to the Sea of Souls Realm, the warriors’ body would have reached beyond mortals. As long as they were not dead, their body would not be affected that much at all. Moreover, they would have much more experience, which would give them an advantage over the youngsters.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
