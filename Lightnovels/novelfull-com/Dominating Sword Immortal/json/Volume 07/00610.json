Naturally, she would bring her own younger disciples to come to this little hill as well.</p><p>Hai Wuya nodded, “Five years ago, Lu Shaoyou and Xiao Chuhe had battled as well, but it still did not attract this much attention. But, it was indeed the battle between the two which caused today’s scenario I guess.”</p><p>Lu Shaoyou was the leader of the top three young warriors, was also one of the top five young warriors. The battle between Xiao Chuhe and him was nothing compared to today. However, after losing to Lu Shaoyou, he had trained for three years straight, and his power now had already reached an unpredictable level. He had even beaten one of the top three master level blade artists, Shen Qianlang, making the older generation master level warriors start to feel threatened. They knew that if they did not start to pay more attention to this, they would very likely be beaten by the top five young warriors. Therefore, the battle between Xia Houzun and Bai Wuxue naturally attracted such attention.</p><p>Seeing all of the master level Sea of Souls Realm warriors everywhere, Ye Chen could not help but shake his head. Amongst the older generation, not to mention master level Sea of Souls Realm warriors, it would be rare to have spirit level warriors in the South Rudra Region. In fact, even the normal Sea of Souls Realm warriors were extremely less in the region. The top six rank 6 martial institutions would have seven or eight powerful Seas of Souls Realm warriors, but not more than fifty of them. There were more Sea of Souls Realm warriors inside Murong family, which would be around thirty of them. Adding some of the loner martial warriors, there would be no more than two hundred of them in total. Of course, there were also countless powerful warriors who were never home. But, South Rudra Region’s general power was extremely weak.</p><p>Murong Qingcheng was obviously thinking the same as Ye Chen, frowning slightly as a slight helplessness appeared on her face.</p><p>“From the South Rudra Region, Yan Chihuo and Li Daoxuan have both reached Sea of Souls Realm.” Murong Qingcheng said.</p><p>“I think it is time for me to reach the next realm.”</p><p>Yan Chihuo and Li Daoxuan were still top martial geniuses after all. Plus, they were not that young anymore either. They were both approaching thirty years of age. Of course, another person should not be forgotten: Sikong Sheng, who had a great chance of reaching the Sea of Souls Realm as well.</p><p>In the afternoon, there were even more people here in the Nine Dragon Lake, almost ten thousand of them. Amongst them, there were still more normal Sea of Souls Realm warriors, but the master level warriors had broken the record and reached more than six hundred. Perhaps this new record would not be broken for a long time.</p><p>After all, all of the famous master level Seas of Souls Realm warriors were here.</p><p>“Look, it is Dantai Mingyue!”</p><p>In the Sky, a beautiful lady in red dress arrived on a colorful big bird. She was dressing like Murong Qingcheng, with a light veil over her face. However, unlike the latter’s normal black veil, hers was red.</p><p>Dantai Mingyue arrived by herself and landed onto a massive tree.</p><p>On that steep mountain, Du Gujue, who was training before, opened his eyes and looked over at her. That battling intent was very obvious, and he did not plan to hide it either.</p><p>“The top three martial geniuses are all here. It looks like they are all at the same cultivation level, at peak level Mid Sea of Souls Realm.”</p><p>“Judging by this battling record, Ye Chen is still winning by a little, since Du Gujue and Dantai Mingyue do not seem to have made any progress, not that we had heard of at least.”</p><p>“Really nothing from Dantai Mingyue. But, Du Gujue had beaten one of the top three sword master warriors, Tai Shichong, a couple of months ago. He has already made it amongst the other top young warriors.”</p><p>“I wonder if the top three martial geniuses will compete with each other this time?”</p><p>“I guess not. Right now is not the right time, and it would be meaningless. It is like the top five warriors. They wouldn’t do anything normally, but when they did, the whole world would be shocked.”</p><p>With all top three martial geniuses gathered in one place, the atmosphere over the lake was getting pumped up again. Perhaps, with the top five young warriors being so famous and powerful, the top three martial geniuses still did not have what it took to compete with them. But as time passed, most people thought that they might be able to compete with them eventually and replace them. But obviously, it had to be under the condition where they were making a lot of progress.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>A sword light shot out from far away and a sword qi shot up into the sky. Before he had even arrived, the sky changed drastically, as if it was not a human that came, but actually a great sword.</p><p>It was indeed Tai Shichong!</p><p>“It looks like he has successfully reached the Late Sea of Souls Realm. His power has improved more than just a little.” Ye Chen could tell from first glance that Tai Shichong was now at the Late Sea of Souls Realm, and his Zhen yuan had become rich like the ocean. Of course, the progress in cultivation was still nothing. What was worth considering was that each breakthrough would allow the warrior to experience a small moment of enlightenment, where he or she could feel the connection with nature. And according to their comprehensive ability, they might make different levels of improvement.</p><p>Ye Chen had also had one of those moments, and he managed to train his Gold Resonant Radiance from completion to one hundred and thirty percent level before creating his Gold Pattern. They were all products of his enlightenment, since one would have to have enough understanding of the profound before creating a mid-rank profound martial art.</p><p>“Du Gujue, do you dare to battle with me?”</p><p>Upon arriving at the location, Tai Shichong targeted Du Gujue, who was resting with his eyes closed.</p><p>“What! Tai Shichong wants to battle Du Gujue!”</p><p>“What’s so strange about that? Tai Shichong had made a great improvement in his power, so he naturally wants to redeem his reputation by beating Du Gujue. I just wonder if Du Gujue will accept that.”</p><p>Everyone ended up looking at Du Gujue. The latter opened his eyes again and looked at Tai Shichong with a cold expression. “I see that you are quite confident, aren’t you? You think you could beat me.”</p><p>“Cut the bullsh*t! Do you dare to take on my challenge?” Tai Shichong had a sharp look in his eyes.</p><p>Slowly standing up, Du Gujue said, “Why not?”</p><p>“Great! You and I are going to battle in the lake.” Tai Shichong flew to the center of the Nine Dragon Lake.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Moving his body, Du Gujue shot out like a sharp blade.</p><p>“I cannot believe the two are about to battle again!” Hai Wuya stared at the center of the lake.</p><p>“Du Gujue, take this!”</p><p>Tiptoeing on the surface of the lake, Tai Shichong and Du Gujue clashed together. All of a sudden, the blade light and sword shadow filled up the whole lake, causing the water to be splashed into the air.</p><p>This battle lasted three whole exchanges, during which, the two had both used their top killing ace attacks, making it really intense. It was not hard to tell that Du Gujue no longer had the ultimate upper hand in this battle like the last time. But, Tai Shichong, who had just improved his power drastically, did not obtain the winning position either.</p><p>“Desperation Blade! ”</p><p>Finally, Du Gujue had been pushed to use his last attack. In that white light blade light, everything that had ever lived appeared within, the desperate atmosphere spreading out the area.</p><p>“Du Gujue, if you only have this attack, then you will lose for sure this time.”</p><p>Tai Shichong jumped into the air and stabbed out a sword attack at the incoming white blade light. That attack had given people the feeling as if it was impossible to block it out like a sword attack from the sky.</p><p>“The perfected Natural Sword!”</p><p>Ye Chen’s pupil shrank a bit. On that day, Tai Shichong had used his Natural Sword Finger Art, and a big part of the martial art was the mud profound; it contained everything in the world. He had also infused his water profound within. That day, the infusion was done roughly, so it was not that smooth. But today, the two profounds had been put together in a more meaningful way. That one sword indeed seemed to be coming from the sky.</p><p>Tai Shichong power today would not be weaker than Lin Tian’s.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>Du Gujue could not handle that sword’s power, blood leaking out from the corner of his mouth.</p><p>“Du Gujue has lost!” Everyone cried out.</p><p>Dantai Mingyue looked calm; she seemed to have already foreseen the outcome.</p><p>“Du Gujue, you lost!”</p><p>After beating Du Gujue successfully, a smile appeared on Tai Shichong’s face.</p><p>Wiping off the blood, Du Gujue lifted up his head and said. “Oh yeah? I do not think so. Now, I will beat you with the next blade attack.”</p><p>“Rude!”</p><p>Hearing him, Tai Shichong frowned. He thought Du Gujue was just being a bitter loser.</p><p>“Whether I am being reckless, you will know soon enough. Take my real Desperate Blade!”</p><p>As he talked, Du Gujue’s qi changed completely. His whole body sank into his despairing vibe, and a horrifying power appeared from it. It was a strange wave of power which turned him into almost an evil ghost carrying fatal despairing vibes.</p><p>“Haha!”</p><p>A sky slicing sound was heard; it was extremely horrifying, since it was a blurred out, high pitched, twisted laugh. Once Tai Shichong heard the loud laughing sound, he seemed to enter a strange mental place. His face went pale and his body started to twitch; something seemed to make him feel despair.</p><p>“Hm?”</p><p>One of the top five young warriors Xiao Chuhe, who was watching calmly, frowned at what he saw…and there would not be many things that could make him frown.</p><p>Sword Master Lu Shaoyou seemed to be thinking about something as well.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Facing this blade attack, Tai Shichong did not look different. After being blown away by a blade attack, he sank into deep coma. At the same time, some of his friends picked him up and helped him sit up by the corner. They looked at Du Gujue with an extremely pale face. They could not believe how Du Gujue became this powerful this fast.</p><p>Ding!</p><p>What was more shocking was that Du Gujue had slapped his palm onto his own forehead. A low sound was heard, and he became his normal self again. But, his face was paler; that attack seemed to have taken a lot out of him.</p><p>“Strange! His whole body had sunk into that despairing vibe as if he was creating power from his emotions.” Ye Chen studied Du Gujue who was now sitting and training; thoughts went through his brain at high speed.</p><p>“I did not expect to see this Du Gujue become so powerful. I think I have underestimated him.”</p><p>“Yeah! Tai Shichong was never as powerful as Lin Tian, but he was close. However, even he would not be able to handle one blade attack of Du Gujue. Anyway, Du Gujue does not look good either. He must have used some kind of uncontrollable power.”</p><p>Everyone was still rather surprised at the outcome of this battle.</p><p>“This Du Gujue is so powerful! I would like to see for myself as well. However, his condition right now is not the best. I guess he would not be able to compete with me like this.”</p><p>Inside the pavilion right next to the lake, an evil looking young man with an ash-white face waved his fan and said quietly.</p><p>“Lan Xueqing, during that battle you had with Lin Tian, you only got a slight upper hand. Perhaps you should battle with him again.” Someone right next to him said.</p><p>That young man shook his head. “Before this, I might have had the interest to battle with him. But, he lost the battle, and even to a newbie out of nowhere. Challenging him now is not what I want to do. Fine…I will go challenge Ye Chen. I want to see what kind of power he had to beat Lin Tian.”</p><p>As he spoke, that evil-looking young man stood up, looking at where Ye Chen was. He said loudly. “Ye Chen, will you take ten attacks of mine?”</p><p>“Eh? It is Lan Xieqing! He wants to challenge Ye Chen.” The crowd had not settled down yet before being hyped up again.</p><p>“Lan Xieqing!” Du Gujue’s tired eyes opened.</p><p>“Lan Xieqing had battled Lin Tian two years ago, where he got a slightly upper hand. Today, he is about to challenge Ye Chen, who has beaten Lin Tian. This should be good!”</p><p>“Yeah, they all said that Ye Chen is extremely powerful. I just do not know what his power is like. I do not know if it was Lin Tian being weak, or is this Ye Chen really as powerful as they said. Perhaps, this battle could answer our questions.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
