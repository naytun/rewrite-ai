Xia Houzun (Part Three)</p><p><strong>Translator:</strong> EndlessFantasy Translation <strong>Editor:</strong> EndlessFantasy Translation</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>Two drastically different sounds exploded as Ye Chen and Xia Houzun were blown backward at the same time. That powerful shockwave spread out, almost shattering all of the tunnels around and bringing up smoke in the air.</p><p>Blood poured out of the corner of his mouth as Ye Chen was secretly shocked. His new shield could not even block out that Void Shattering Attack of his opponent. Not only that, the remaining finger power had made it through and affected his physical body. After some of the power was canceled out by the dragon bone defense layer, it still made an impact on his internal organs, which caused a minor injury.</p><p>“Without this new shield, this attack would have wounded me even more…maybe even causing severe wounds as well.” Ye Chen had finally learned exactly how powerful Xia Houzun’s Void Shattering finger power was, the one that made Bai Wuxue use all of his power.</p><p>On the contrary, Xia Houzun was wounded even more severely than Ye Chen. Ye Chen’s sword attack was unbelievably fast indeed, because of 3hich, it had managed to cut through the space barrier immediately as well as his protective Zhen yuan before landing heavily onto his top rank shield. That intense sword qi followed the shield and wounded his internal organs, as well as his meridians, much more severely. It had even left invisible sword qi inside his body that was like small blades, cutting down his flesh and organs slowly and internally.</p><p>‘ARRH!’</p><p>Puking out a huge chunk of blood, he literally could not look worse. He had lost his confidence and calm from before. Although that aggressiveness was somehow still there, but without the support of his calm and confidence, it looked more like hysteria and madness right now.</p><p>He stared at Ye Chen with his eyes filled with killing intent, his body shaking once as he roared, “Get the f**k out!”</p><p>It was like a broken dam again as a huge amount of gold light poured out of his body along with a water flooding sound. The walls of the tunnels started to show tiny cracks created by the sword qi pushed out by him.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>Ye Chen would not give Xia Houzun time to take a breath, so he waved his longsword, and that gentle sword qi attacked at Xia Houzun once again. This time, there was no place to back out.</p><p>“B*stard!”</p><p>Sparks splashed from his chest as Xia Houzun felt that his chest was about to be broken. Both of his feet left the ground, and he was blown into the air like an arrow before crashing onto the walls around the corner. A light human shaped dent had been pressed into the wall, bringing up a mist of dust.</p><p>“Gold Pattern!”</p><p>Ye Chen followed right behind him like a ghost, throwing out another killing attack. That beautiful gold pattern was like the pattern in the lake, spreading out seemingly slowly but really quickly.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The shield was twisted and blood poured out from all over Xia Houzun’s body. Even his skin had started to bleed, and he turned into a bleeding man.</p><p>“You have made me do this…Blood Emperor Killing Finger!”</p><p>All of the blood quickly gathered on the tip of his index finger where the skin cracked open suddenly, and a red light poured out while carrying a destructive qi. That stream of blood contained a mysterious power which had been extracted out by Xia Houzun.</p><p>This finger attack was a secret art that was extremely powerful.</p><p>Shoo!</p><p>The red ray like finger power was fast like lightning, and it arrived right in front of Ye Chen within the second.</p><p>“Break!”</p><p>He performed his Spiritual Sword Attack in response, landing right onto that red finger power.</p><p>Ting!</p><p>At that moment, something surprising happened. The unbreakable Thunder Disaster Sword bent drastically, looking as if it was a fully-pulled bow. The next second, a wave of extremely powerful force followed through the sword and attacked Ye Chen’s palm, devouring his dragon bone defense layer.</p><p>“Such an aggressive secret art!” Blood poured down Ye Chen’s mouth.</p><p>Shoo! Ye Chen used this beam of power and bounced back, landing on the ground slightly unstably. He could not help but back out a couple of steps, with each step leaving a light dent on the ground.</p><p>“Ye Chen!” Murong Qingcheng moaned out quietly.</p><p>Ye Chen waved his hand, “I am alright!”</p><p>Meanwhile, he still had his eyes set on Xia Houzun as he thought to himself, ‘I think I have still quite underestimated the top five young warriors. Even when pushed to the corner, they still have ace attacks that could turn over the whole situation. Although the price of using all of his blood might be a bit too much, when it is a life and death moment, no one would really care about that anymore. It is safe to assume that the other four young warriors might have similar final attacks.’</p><p>“He is not wounded that badly!” Xia Houzun’s skin had dried out quite a bit. He looked over at Ye Chen, feeling a bit lost. This last attack was a self-invented secret art created by a blood emperor thousand years ago. Once performed, one-fifth of the blood would be vaporized, but the power it could create would be unbreakable. Although it sounded like a huge amount of blood, but in fact Xia Houzun had only used about one-tenth of his blood. It was not because he used some kind of special trick to lower the requirement, but because that last sword attack of Ye Chen’s had shaken out some of the blood already. When the blood left the human body, it would not lose the energy within for a while, which was perfect to use for this attack.</p><p>“It is that shield! That semi extreme rank shield!”</p><p>Xia Houzun looked around, but soon his eyes fixed onto Ye Chen’s protective Zhen yuan. Normal protective Zhen yuan was only a layer of shell like qi cover, and only a semi extreme rank shield could leave different shaped symbols onto it. Seeing that, he finally realized how Ye Chen managed to increase his defense power to this level.</p><p>A sarcastic smile appeared on his face as he said with a smoky voice, “It is the semi extreme rank shield, isn’t it? Without it, you will not be able to last this long.”</p><p>Ye Chen shook his head calmly, “To be honest, as one of the top five young warriors, your power is definitely there, but your character and personality is really not that great. When you lose, you would automatically search for excuses. If you are a bitter loser like this, then do not walk out of that door. If you think winning with weapons is not fair, then you can also get rid of that top rank shield you are wearing, as well as those gloves of yours. You should probably not use your secret art either, since other people might not have it either. Xia Houzun, do you dare to do that?”</p><p>“You!” Xia Houzun did not have words to talk back. His face was both angry and embarrassed. “So well-spoken, huh? But I, Xia Houzun, have not lost yet! I would like to see who would be the first one giving up.”</p><p>The wound on his body was severe, and he had lost about seventy percent of his attacking power. And with that last attack, his wound had been worsened drastically. If it were not for the fact that Sea of Souls Realm warriors had extremely tough body strength, he probably would not have the power to stand up at all.</p><p>Whoo!</p><p>Taking out a gold pellet, he swallowed it without hesitation.</p><p>“Yeah! The qi is increasing!”</p><p>Ye Chen frowned as he could visibly sense Xia Houzun’s qi growing drastically. It soon reached its peak condition, and even managed to reach beyond. He was even more powerful and aggressive than before he was wounded.</p><p>“It is a semi extreme level pellet?”</p><p>Ye Chen had his guesses as his hand tightened the sword in his hand. Those slight wounds from before had already been repaired, and his battling power was perfectly intact.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>As he let out that aggressive qi, the space around Xia Houzun’s body twisted slightly, and the area around him turned golden. He lifted up his eyes, looking at Ye Chen aggressively, “You have the semi extreme rank shield and I have the blood emperor battle spirit pellet. The victory will belong to me.”</p><p>It was not the semi extreme rank pellet that Ye Chen had guessed. It was actually an extreme rank pellet, with only a part of the effect missing. Its value might be even higher than that of a semi extreme rank shield. Within a short period of time, its effect was even more powerful than the latter.</p><p>Shoo! Shoo! Shoo! Shoo!</p><p>Red qi flow appeared on the surface of Xia Houzun’s skin and came together, forming into a blood energy shield. Gold strings covered the whole body, making him look like a killing machine.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>He used one of his foot to step onto the wall behind him, and then Xia Houzun turned into a beam of bloody lightning, shooting directly at Ye Chen with a sharp attack.</p><p>In response, Ye Chen lifted up his thunder disaster sword and clashed with him.</p><p>‘Such a Blood Emperor pellet…It has not only improved his defense, it even fully repaired his wounds as well as augmented his battling power!’ Ye Chen was shocked to see the changes. He started to suspect that the pellet might be more than just a semi extreme rank one, since normal ones might not have this kind of a powerful effect.</p><p>Just like that, the two continued battling inside the tunnels.</p><p>Xia Houzun’s Void Shattering Finger was impossible to block out in a close-range fight while Ye Chen’s Spiritual Sword Attack was no weaker either. They continued to hit each other on their bodies, blowing each other away.</p><p>When the battle reached this level, both of them had only one thought in their mind—to beat the other person. If there were a chance, they would kill each other without hesitation.</p><p>“I will see how long you could last.”</p><p>With the blood energy shield protecting him, Xia Houzun continued to attack without defending. He stopped using his Draw Attack, since there was no need in defending at all. He continued to perform his Star Nuclear Finger and Void Shattering Finger Art, as well as his Falling Star Finger and Comet Finger Attack, wanting to burn out all of Ye Chen’s Zhen yuan.</p><p>“Don’t worry! It will not be me who will not last.”</p><p>The sword qi had been blocked out by the blood energy shield. Besides the shock in the beginning, Ye Chen had calmed down. Each sword attack had been targeted at exactly the same spot, and he did not believe that this shield could last forever.</p><p>Pooh!</p><p>Puking out a chunk of blood, Ye Chen looked like nothing had happened as he continued to battle with Xie Houzun. With his undying body, he had nothing to worry about either.</p><p>Soon, Xia Houzun started to realize that there was something strange. Although he could wound Ye Chen slightly each time, it should be starting to accumulate into severe wounds by now. But looking at Ye Chen’s battling condition now, he actually looked better and better; he was in his optimized battling condition somehow, and did not look like he was affected at all.</p><p>On the contrary, although he had the blood energy shield to protect him and block out most of the incoming attacks, he could be shaken to death eventually after a long time, since the pellet could only cure his physical wounds. It could not replace all of the blood he had lost, which would take a long process.</p><p>“Blood Emperor Attack!”</p><p>Xia Houzun got a scary look on his face; after burning out one-fourth of the blood again, he pointed out a finger attack at Ye Chen’s forehead.</p><p>“Thunder Devour!”</p><p>The two swords were crossed in front of him as Ye Chen threw out a thunder ball. It slowly transformed into a silver colored light ball, which was a sign of reaching completion in his thunder profound.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
