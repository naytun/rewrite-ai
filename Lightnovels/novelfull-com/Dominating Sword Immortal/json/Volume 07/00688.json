Currently, just Blood Severing Ghost Finger costed so much of his energy. If the former was added on top, Ye Chen’s cultivation time might even completely crumble.</p><p>Everything else could wait until he cultivate Blood Severing Ghost FInger to minor completion.</p><p>“Dragon God Envoy, you can cultivate Blood Severing Ghost FInger, but don’t tell others.” Sending off Ye Chen to the pavilion’s entrance, Pavilion Elder warned.</p><p>Ye Chen said,”Rest assured, Elder Tian, Ye Chen is not a reckless person.”</p><p>Saying these words, Ye Chen strode away, slowly disappearing into the distance.</p><p>“Palace Master and young miss has great insight.”</p><p>Pavilion Elder retracted his gaze and returned to pavilion.</p><p>——— –</p><p>If an individual entered the island and nobody in Dragon God Celestial Palace found out, Dragon God Celestial Palace wouldn’t be worthy of its name.</p><p>Outside the Redcloud Residence, Elder Yu was waiting.</p><p>“Dragon God Envoy!” Seeing Ye Chen, he let out a smile.</p><p>“Elder Yu, come inside please.”</p><p>Ye Chen waved his hand, lifting the restrictions.</p><p>Before the lake, which was dyed crimson by the red clouds, the two people sat underneath a mid grade tree around a stone table, slowly sipping tea.</p><p>After a while, Elder Yu put his tea cup down,”Dragon God Envoy, what is the current situation of Dragon God Celestial Palace?”</p><p>Ye Chen’s corner of mouth slightly raised,”A good news, and a bad news. Which one do you want to hear first?”</p><p>“Then the bad news first!”</p><p>Elder Yu took in a deep breath. Hearing good news first and bad news second would leave him with a heavy mood. Going the other way around, he might end up feeling a bit better.</p><p>“A week ago, I and Deputy Xu Danian met an ambush while escorting resources. We lost a total of four hundred thirty people, twenty three of which were Sea of Soul realm experts.”</p><p>Hiss!</p><p>Elder Yu sucked in a breath of cold air, and several colors flickered on his face. This time, although loss of Sea of Soul experts was a bit less, such a huge loss of Astral Reaching experts was even more grave than the last incident. This news almost made him feel choked.</p><p>Smiling bitterly, Elder Yu took a long sip from the teacup,”Sure enough, it still turned out like this.”</p><p>Immediately afterward, his expression turned fierce,”If I find out the mole, I’ll let him have a taste of being bitten by ten thousand snakes.”</p><p>Without a spy, how could they have suffered the second ambush? The combined losses of two times were nearing hundred men. This number was too heart-wrenching.</p><p>For a good while, Elder Yu didn’t say anything. His mind was in complete disarray.</p><p>Letting out a sigh, Ye Chen said,”Elder Yu, you don’t want to hear the good news?”</p><p>“Just tell me!”</p><p>Elder Yu didn’t hope Ye Chen would have too good of a news for him.</p><p>“Our side lost forty thirty men, but the enemies lost more than two thousand. This can be considered a good news, no? What do you think?” Ye Chen raised his teacup and smiled.</p><p>“Enemy lost more than two thousand?”</p><p>Elder Yu couldn’t react for a brief moment. It was too different from what he’d expected.</p><p>“Tell me again, how many people enemy lost?”</p><p>“Two thousand.”</p><p>“Two thousand! Two thousand, haha! Five times more than ours, haha!”</p><p>Elder Yu heartily laughed. The sound of laughter made the mid grade maple tree tremble, causing fiery-red maple leaves to fall off and flutter in the wind.</p><p>“Dragon God Envoy, who did you killed two thosuand enemies?”</p><p>Once Elder Yu’s gloominess dissipated, he asked with a curious face.</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t conceal anything and narrated the entire incident.</p><p>Upon hearing, Elder Yu’s gaze on Ye Chen brimmed with respect,”Dragon God Envoy really is a deity. I can’t admire you more.”</p><p>Although Ye Chen had downplayed himself a little, how could Elder Yu not know that the most important factor enabling them to kill two thousand enemies was Ye Chen. If the ambush was not opened, the outcome would have been completely different, and it would have ended in their total destruction.</p><p>“Dragon God Envoy, this is a big matter. If it’s not too much trouble, please make a trip to Elders Hall with me. Everybody is quite troubled by the circumstances of Azure Dragon Hall.”</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Ye Chen didn’t decline.</p><p>———— –</p><p>Elders Hall was filled to every seat.</p><p>The Great Elder had a rare smile on his face, and it was only getting increasingly bigger. Ultimately, he burst out laughing. The second elder and third beside him also started laughing. It was a carefree laughter, as if getting relieved of a huge burden.</p><p>How could the other elders be reserved? They laughed uproariously, almost dancing with joy. Discussions broke out like boiling water. The Elders Hall had never been so chaotic, and nobody tried to prevent it.</p><p>“Killing more than two thousand people. This is number is already equivalent to the loss palace suffered in these past years, all done in a single campaign.”</p><p>“The four forces must be feeling their flesh ache.”</p><p>“Fortunately, we invited Dragon God Envoy. Otherwise, it would be us feeling the pain.”</p><p>“Tell me more about it.”</p><p>Elders Association buzzed with sounds of discussions.</p><p>Cough Cough!</p><p>The second elder cleared his throat and calmed the situation that had turned too chaotic,”Dragon God Envoy, how many disciples died?”</p><p>His bottom line was death of half. Although only three had Sea of Soul realm cultivation bases among the dispatched ones, all of them were genius among geniuses since they could become a disciple of Dragon God Celestial Palace. Death of one was equivalent to death of dozens of ordinary Astral Reaching experts.</p><p>“Four died, and nobody died amongst the core disciples.”</p><p>Ye Chen bluntly replied.</p><p>“Good.”</p><p>The second elder let out a sigh of relief. Four was far lower than the bottom line in his heart,”Continue to let them temper themselves in Azure Dragon Hall. Next time, I’ll replace them with another batch.”</p><p>Hearing these words, Great Elder faintly nodded. War was the best means of tempering. If they survived twice, both their survival ability and mentality would take a huge leap forward. Of course, tempering twice was enough, and other disciples should also get the same opportunity.</p><p>After finally found a source of venting, Great Elder gradually relaxed and said,”This time, the enemy’s loss is too big. They will certainly not give up, and their focus will be on you, Dragon God Envoy. They will use every trick to get rid of you.”</p><p>“I understand, Great Elder can be rest assured.”</p><p>Ye Chen had been prepared long since.</p><p>“You have the ability to find luck in calamity, so I believe you will be fine. However, if everything goes wrong, you can ditch anybody and focus on making out alive.” The Great Elder couldn’t explain how could Ye Chen evade the ambush and instead surprise attack the enemy. Thus, he could only attribute to the sort of mysterious power of seeking luck in calamities.</p><p>“Such a situation shouldn’t occur.”</p><p>Ye Chen confidently said.</p><p>“That would be for the best.”</p><p>Upon the matters of Elders Association concluded, Elder Yu once again took Ye Chen too Treasury to let him pick the second war chariot.</p><p>There was no doubting Ye Chen’s strength, and one war chariot was no longer sufficient for him. Two war chariots would undoubtedly make his troops even stronger. If not for the fact that there was only one war chariot, they would have no issue to give all three to Ye Chen.</p><p>The new war-chariot was called Black Rubber War Chariot. Its quality was slightly lower than Golden Dragon War Chariot, and its floor dragon head could spout water shells.</p><p>Resting one night in Redcloud Residence, Ye Chen headed back to Azure Dragon Hall.</p><p>—————</p><p>Half a month passed in tranquility.</p><p>Lin Canghai’s residence was in a corner of the island. There was not a single person present within a hundred li of his residence. During this half a month, every once in a while, one could see sword Qi shooting up and the sky changing colors.</p><p>He undoubtedly lost his bet with Ye Chen, and lost thoroughly. On his path of sword dao, he’d never lose within the same generation. His nature was not inherently bad, but he was used to being remote and aloof. No matter how calm he was, he couldn’t treat as if nothing had happened.</p><p>He didn’t hate Ye Chen, but only wished himself to be more stronger and challenge this slowly rising young Sword Master.</p><p>Compared to Lin Canghai, Ye Chen’s surroundings were quite calm.</p><p>This was because Ye Chen was currently cultivating Blood Severing Ghost Finger. The disturbance by its cultivation was not big. It only brought about deathly stillness and terror.</p><p>“Sever!”</p><p>Standing still under a big tree, Ye Chen held his breath as he focused. His eyes were sharp as he raised the two index fingers of his right and slashed.</p><p>Without a sound, the upper half of the tree seemed as if it had suddenly dried up. The leaves instantly turned yellow and fell down one after another. The entire upper half of tree completely withered without a trace of vitality left. It seemed as if its life force had been wiped away.</p><p>“Blood Severing Ghost FInger severs blood Qi. However, blood Qi contains vital essence, and tree also has vital essence. So it works on trees as well, though only on one half is affected. Only before genuine blood and flesh would this art display its true might.”</p><p>Blood Severing Ghost Finger was indeed hard to cultivate. Ye Chen’s perception was quite high, five times of the normal people. However, he was still clueless for several days in the beginning. Later he carefully analyzed the description in the book, and comprehended what should be the state of mind amidst life and death. After gaining a little comprehension, he would sever all distracting thoughts with sword intent every time he cultivated Blood Severing Ghost Finger. Eventually, he gained a preliminary understanding of this art.</p><p>Of course, he was still quite far from the minor completion, and it could at most be used to deal with ordinary Sea of Soul experts.</p><p>Days passed by, and Ye Chen continued to improve bit by bit. This improvement was extremely minute. If the results of consecutive days were compared, there would be almost no difference. Only after a period of time would there be any detectable improvement.</p><p>As Ye Chen gaines some understanding of Blood Severing Ghost Finger, he increasingly felt this art’s strangeness and terror. While cultivating this finger art, he would occasionally see some frightening scenes. On a vast expanse of desolate, dried up land, dead souls wandering about, and the ghost fires filling the whole sky. These dead souls’s appearance couldn’t be seen. Their bodies were wrapped in tattered white cloths, emitting dense Qi of death.</p><p>Ye Chen had no idea what these strange visions meant,</p><p>However, it was impossible for him to hold them in fear. If he wanted to cultivate, he would cultivate. Moreover, he discovered, wherever these strange scenes surfaced, his cultivation would be a lot smoother, as if some invisible power was coordinating with him.</p><p>In this manner, another half a month went by. Compared to the beginning, Ye Chen’s had made twice the progress. With one slash, he could sever the vitality of an entire tree, but he still didn’t know where did it go. At this point, Ye Chen could already see the dead soul in white long robe. This dead soul was different from the rest. It seemed to have intelligence. However, his death Qi’s thickness was beyond imagination.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
