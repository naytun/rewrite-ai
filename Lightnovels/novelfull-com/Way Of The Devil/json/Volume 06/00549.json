That was a holy dragon, after all! A high holy dragon! It was no ordinary beast.</p><p>If he was capable of breaking through the protection of a high holy dragon’s scales, other beings would be unexplainably fragile before him.</p><p>“Pooh!”</p><p>Gray Star’s tail vanished after a few bites. Lu Sheng’s nine heads bit away at blinding speed. In a few moments, he had reduced a dozen meters tall, 20 meters long high holy dragon to a third of its body.</p><p>The devil king felt his own heart go cold. He hastily called out to Lu Sheng, “Enough! That’s enough!”</p><p>However, Lu Sheng paid him no heed. He directly torn Gray Star to pieces and consumed every last piece before slowing down.</p><p>His stomach was already as swollen as a huge ball. However, the size of the ball was swiftly shrinking with shocking speed.</p><p>From the moment he’d started biting to the moment he finished the meal, it had only been a dozen breaths. The terrifying speed of consumption not only shocked the holy dragons, even Lu Sheng himself was slightly startled.</p><p>“Let’s go.” The devil king cast a deep look at Lu Sheng. He tapped the air before himself with his staff, and a red ripple spread out before him. A red door slowly materialized out of thin air.</p><p>He charged headlong into it.</p><p>Lu Sheng followed closely behind him.</p><p>They passed through the red door. A blue and gloomy ice-cold palace presented itself before them.</p><p>Huge blue ice pillars lined the palace. The white floor was as smooth as a mirror, while blue fires burned on the walls for lighting.</p><p>“Congratulations on your safe arrival.” Ju was standing beside the door. He bowed and greeted them.</p><p>“Where’s your teacher Red Lotus?” The devil king looked around him with shock. Aside from Ju, there was no other creature inside the palace.</p><p>“My teacher is currently occupied, and went to another spot in the palace. Your Majesty Devil King, the Eternal Cold Spring is just up ahead. Feel free to take it.” Ju pointed a finger toward the deeper parts of the palace.</p><p>As Ju had said, there was an ice-blue throne that was more than 20 meters tall. It stood silently within the expansive palace. There was only one being that warranted such a huge throne, and that was the holy dragon queen.</p><p>“The Eternal Cold Spring is under the throne,” said Ju drily.</p><p>The armrests of the throne were each decorated with sculpted dragon heads. They looked so fierce that they seemed capable of lashing out. Sharp ice cones protruded from the back of the throne, resembling cold ice wings.</p><p>On the top of the palace toward the left, a colossal ring which glimmered with faint blue light was wedged into the wall.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>As if it had sensed a threat, thick white fog rolled out from the depths of the palace. White ice serpents with girth of about five meters slowly poked their heads out from the fog, and hissed intimidatingly at the three of them.</p><p>“The Eternal Cold Spring… How wonderful…” The devil king strode toward the throne.</p><p>A scythe materialized in his hands again, and he raised it high at the throne.</p><p>“Pcchht!”</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>A silvery-white shield with a roaring lion in the center suddenly appeared before Ju. He had used it to block the devil king’s scythe.</p><p>“I knew that there’s something wrong about you from the start! You’ve killed your teacher, and you intend to fool me? Die!” the devil king roared. He conjured up dozens of red light beams, which shot toward Ju in an engulfing manner.</p><p>“Do it!” Ju exclaimed with pain as he reeled, and blood sprayed from his body.</p><p>“Auurrr!”</p><p>Lu Sheng immediately pounced. However, he did not lunge at the devil king. Instead, he lunged toward the Eternal Cold Spring.</p><p>“Scram!” The devil king swung his scythe. A ball of red light erupted in the center of the weapon, and his entire person instantly vanished and appeared before Lu Sheng on the ground. He brought the scythe down on Lu Sheng’s head.</p><p>At the same time, the cold ice treasure on Lu Sheng suddenly exploded. The strong explosion of white light instantly sent his body off course.</p><p>“Flash Chop!” The devil king’s scythe suddenly vanished.</p><p>“Pcchht!”</p><p>A huge wound instantly opened up on Lu Sheng’s body, and fresh blood gushed forth. The wound was then instantly frozen by his white cold air.</p><p>His expression remained unchanged. He activated his Essential Essence Art, and the wound on his body healed quickly. In a few breaths, it was as if nothing had ever happened to him.</p><p>“How could it be?!” The devil king was stunned. His reactions slowed for an instant, and Lu Sheng’s jaw landed on his chest.</p><p>“Hiss.”</p><p>A huge chunk of flesh from his chest was torn away on the spot. Lu Sheng swallowed it down his stomach in no time.</p><p>“My scythe has the Deathly Still Power, it should’ve been able to suppress any regenerative abilities! How did you?!” The devil king pressed his own chest with pain and took a few steps back. He was looking at Lu Sheng with incredulity.</p><p>“How pitiful. You can’t even see where you are right now. Devil King, I guess that you didn’t expect to be in this kind of situation yourself, right?”</p><p>At this moment, a huge shadow slowly appeared behind the three of them. It was the King of Ashes, who should have been fighting with the holy dragon queen outside.</p><p>“Before we actually fight, we should’ve taken care of these sneaky little rats.” A deep female voice also came slowly from the throne. The three-eyed holy dragon’s huge body appeared on the throne and looked down at them from above.</p><p>“You!!” The devil king displayed an incredulous look.</p><p>“Your tribesmen have been wiped out. You’re the only one left. Stop struggling and surrender.” The King of Ashes looked at the devil king and Lu Sheng before him with ice-cold eyes.</p><p>Lu Sheng was starting to feel that the situation was bad. His gaze shifted and he looked at Ju, whose expression changed as well. It was clear that he had not expected such a turn of events.</p><p>The silhouettes of the holy dragons slowly appeared all around them, surrounding them.</p><p>“How?!” The devil king kept retreating, still looking incredulous. “You!! King of Ashes!! You!!”</p><p>The King of Ashes snickered.</p><p>“The conflict between I, Ashes, and the dragon queen shall naturally be dealt with by us. That’s an internal affair of the holy dragons. You lot are but a show before our real showdown.”</p><p>“Besides…” He switched the topic of the conversation and a mocking look crept onto his face. “In order to activate the Eternal Cold Spring, we needed enough sacrifices…”</p><p>The devil king’s pupils contracted. His entire body burst into flames, and he vanished from where he stood.</p><p>The holy dragon queen and the King of Ashes were not worried at all. Instead, they shifted their gazes toward Lu Sheng and Ju.</p><p>“Nine-headed wolf king, do you have anything to say? We need only the devil king as a sacrifice. If you’re willing to swear fealty to me, I can consider sparing your life.”</p><p>Lu Sheng did not answer. He was looking at Ju. It appeared as if their current predicament would not be an easy one to handle.</p><p>“How long can you last?”</p><p>“Ten breaths.” Ju calmed himself down. “I’ll leave the rest up to you.”</p><p>“So short?” Lu Sheng was shocked.</p><p>“My powers are too powerful. This world will react extremely quickly to me, and won’t allow me to stay for too long,” Ju said slowly.</p><p>“I understand. Does it count if the karma is settled after you die?” Lu Sheng asked after some hesitation.</p><p>“I’ll just have to play some tricks.”</p><p>The three-eyed holy dragon and the King of Ashes clearly sensed that something was wrong. Lu Sheng and Ju were conversing as if there was nobody else around them. They did not even take them seriously.</p><p>“Well then… Let’s start.” Ju reached up and gripped an exquisite pendant before his chest.</p><p>“Goodbye, Hui…”</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>In an instant, his body exploded, and countless purple crystals burst forth from his body.</p><p>The ground cracked and the pillars tumbled. The holy dragons were instantly drowned out. The King of Ashes turned around and wanted to flee, but he was too late. In the blink of an eye, he was drowned out by the endless sea of purple crystals.</p><p>Lu Sheng felt a strong and gentle force enveloping himself. Purple light shone before his eyes. In the blink of an eye, he was already at an altitude of a thousand meters above the holy temple.</p><p>As he hovered in the skies, Lu Sheng suddenly snapped back to his senses.</p><p>“This is?!”</p><p>He quickly gazed toward the holy temple.</p><p>The holy temple had already vanished. In its place was a terrifying mass of purple crystals which spanned a thousand meters.</p><p>That was not all. The crystals were still enlarging, spreading, and duplicating wildly.</p><p>In the end, a terrifying mound of purple crystals that had a diameter of six kilometers appeared in the middle of the battlefield.</p><p>“I’m counting on you. 10 breaths.” A blood-red vertical pupil opened in the center of the crystal mound. It was looking at Lu Sheng.</p><p>“Don’t worry…” Lu Sheng drew a deep breath and nodded solemnly. This time, if Ju had not unleashed his explosive strength, he would have been forced to abandon this host body of his. There was no issue in him escaping, but if he could not settle the karma, the entire time he’d spent here would have been wasted.</p><p>Ju closed his eyes slowly. The crystals all over his body shrunk suddenly before expanding again.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>The purple crystals exploded completely. Purplish flowing lights shot past Lu Sheng. In an instant, the heavens and the earth were dyed purple.</p><p>The skies, the land, everything was covered in purple.</p><p>“I owe you one.” Ju’s voice slowly reached Lu Sheng’s ears.</p><p>“Pccccchhhhhhht!”</p><p>The rain of purple crystals penetrated the bodies of every living thing nearby. Whether it was the holy dragons or the King of Ashes’ great army, anyone alive was bombarded by the purple crystals and turned into sieves.</p><p>“Your real name is?” Lu Sheng suddenly asked.</p><p>“…Zhuang Jiu.”</p><p>“Foom!”</p><p>Suddenly, a cacophony of noises reached his ears. Lu Sheng’s vision blurred again. The purple crystals had completely vanished.</p><p>If it were not for the completely destroyed holy temple far away and the land that was riddled with holes, Lu Sheng would have thought that he had imagined all that.</p><p>‘So this is the true might of a Weapon Grandmaster?’ His heart beat wildly. In that instant where his terrifying might erupted, the King of Ashes and the holy dragon queen had turned into supporting characters. All it took was a breath for everything to be completely destroyed.</p><p>The skies and land around him fell into a deathly stillness. However, what puzzled Lu Sheng was that there had been so many purple crystals before this, but none of them left a trace.</p><p>He scanned the vicinity and could not find any. The mountains and wilderness were strewn with bodies killed by the purple crystals, and their blood stained the ground.</p><p>All of a sudden, with his sharp eyes, he saw a hint of purple that was fading quickly where the holy temple was.</p><p>Lu Sheng quickly flew over. With that movement, he realized that he was still in midair, and that this body of his had not learn how to fly.</p><p>His body had no choice but to fall down with a loud crash. After creating a large pit on the barren slope, he hastily got back up on his feet and charged toward the mountaintop.</p><p>After the slight delay, he reached the mountaintop, and only a remnant of the purple glow remained.</p><p>Lu Sheng charged over and grabbed the purple light.</p><p>The purple light immediately plunged into his body. It was, to Lu Sheng’s surprise, a message. It contained a formation that allowed him to connect with the Ghost Borneo World.</p><p>After obtaining the formation, Lu Sheng looked in the direction where the holy temple once stood.</p><p>All that was left was a mass of light blue contortions which hovered in midair. Dark blue water slowly trickled out from the contortion. Within a dozen meters of the contortion, the water flow naturally melted into the air and disappeared.</p><p>“That’s the Eternal Cold Spring!” Lu Sheng’s eyes beamed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
