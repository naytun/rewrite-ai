A rift opened up where his heart was. His main body shot out from it in the form of a black light, then landed, and quickly grew back to his original form.</p><p>Luo Sang’s body, on the other hand, was shrinking quickly. In no time, it had shrunk to the size of a round ball of flesh, and merged into his main body’s chest.</p><p>He had just finished this act when the time limit for Time Freeze was up.</p><p>Everything in the Research Temple instantly returned to normal.</p><p>The scattered papers slowly dropped to the ground, the research instruments fell in the corner with loud clanks, and the runes on the floor resumed pulsing as if they were breathing.</p><p>‘This world’s physical strengthening system is too fragile. It’s completely different from the Great Yin’s system. An entity from that world is completely at odds in this place. It’s only natural for it to disintegrate.’ Lu Sheng carefully felt Luo Sang’s physical body within him.</p><p>The physical body was swiftly crumbling away. However, his spirit had already came out of it. At the same time, he pulled Luo Sang’s spirit out as well.</p><p>The karma was settled. Luo Sang’s weak spirit gradually merged into Lu Sheng’s immense spirit.</p><p>Although Luo Sang’s spirit was like a sesame seed compared to Lu Sheng’s spirit which was like a blue whale, the effect of this sesame seed was like a chemical reaction to Lu Sheng.</p><p>Lu Sheng sat down cross-legged and shut his eyes tightly. He could feel another extremely weak consciousness within his own consciousness swiftly fade away.</p><p>There was no regret or reluctance. Luo Sang’s consciousness quickly merged into his own. When Lu Sheng felt that his entire body was being invaded by a bone-chilling cold, a sudden warmth welled up within him, and spread over his body. It was a comfortable feeling.</p><p>Vaguely, he seemed to have seen a door.</p><p>It was a huge black door with two savage-looking bat-like creatures perched atop its frame.</p><p>That door was in the deepest part of his consciousness. The essence of all that he had learnt was carved on the door in densely packed patterns.</p><p>The essence of the Infinity Technique turned into simplified symbols which were carved onto the door.</p><p>‘So this is the boundary of a Weapon Grandmaster?’ Lu Sheng suddenly understood.</p><p>He looked down and fixed his gaze on the patterns and symbols on this door. The various symbols represented all his achievements and powers he’d obtained throughout his cultivation.</p><p>He suddenly lifted his head and looked at the two black monsters atop the huge door.</p><p>These two bat-like creatures had the lower halves of their bodies merged with the door. They had no eyeballs—two balls of green Yin Flame were burning in their place.</p><p>Lu Sheng stared at the two monsters. He seemed to faintly see the peculiar lines of the Mystic Water Divine Vein in their eyes.</p><p>“Boom.”</p><p>Suddenly, his surroundings blurred. Lu Sheng quickly snapped back to the present. He noticed with fright that he was lying on the floor. He had lost consciousness, and did not know how long he’d been unconscious for.</p><p>“Sh*t!” He got up. If his enemies had run into him while he was in that state and launched a sneak attack on him, he would have been gravely wounded, if not killed.</p><p>He ran his hands over his own body. He noticed that he was slightly cold. Then, he remembered the series of events just now.</p><p>The effects of a Divine Intellect Divine Lord’s terrifyingly powerful Spiritual Power was immediately made apparent. Everything that had just happened, every single scene, was slowed down 10 times and replayed in Lu Sheng’s mind.</p><p>He slowly reminisced, and quickly understood his condition back then.</p><p>‘It seems that touching the Weapon Grandmaster’s Boundary Door will result in a phenomenon that is akin to an out-of-body experience. Weapon Grandmaster… So, just what kind of existence is a Weapon Grandmaster?’ Lu Sheng felt that he might actually have to refer to another Weapon Grandmaster.</p><p>Up until now, none of the materials he had come across had detailed records about Weapon Grandmasters. This included the Heavenly Devil Jade Records which Ju Yan gave him.</p><p>None of them had such records.</p><p>Ju Yan did not intend to give him much help in the first place. Now that he thought about it, much of the Jade Records’ contents were trimmed versions. They were not much help in his actual cultivation.</p><p>The only thing he learned was the Language of E.</p><p>It was a unique language that was capable of communication in the place of one’s spirit. Through the transmission of sound alone, it was capable of transcending the various barriers between the languages of the different races.</p><p>He rested for a while where he was. Lu Sheng clearly felt that his spirit was at least two times stronger than before he’d assimilated Luo Sang.</p><p>He had no idea what level he was at right now. However, if it was based on the volume of his spirit, he was confident that he would not lose to any late-stage Divine Intellect Divine Lord.</p><p>What he regretted was that Luo Sang’s powerful physical body had completely disintegrated under the workings of the natural rhythm here. Half of it was absorbed by his main body, which he managed to strengthen that way. The remaining portions he could only expel, and they became trash.</p><p>His spirit and physical body were strengthened at the same time. Lu Sheng glanced at Deep Blue’s interface.</p><p>“Infinity Technique, fifth tier. Collection tier, Blood Hero. Special trait, Eight-Headed Devil Art, Time Freeze, Nature Deception, powerful spirit…”</p><p>There was a long list of special traits after that line. Most of them were regarding his own strengthening and improvement in his various resistances, which included physical resistance, energy resistance, and others.</p><p>Although the contents of the frame remained unchanged, compared to before, there were the additions of Time Freeze and Nature Deception in his special traits. At the same time, his spirit was two times more powerful than before. He was already brushing against the boundary of a Weapon Grandmaster.</p><p>‘As expected, I’ve improved. I’m already at an extreme level where I’m one step away from becoming a Weapon Grandmaster. I reckon that I’ll be able to become a Weapon Grandmaster with my next breakthrough. This is a true natural transformation.’</p><p>With Lu Sheng’s current level, even if he just stood there while he allowed the others to hit him, it would at least take a Weapon Master’s full strength to break his resistance and leave a mark on him.</p><p>That was only leaving a mark. If a person wanted to harm him, the person would at least need to have a Jade Star Divine Lord’s Divine Weapon and launch an all-out attack to injure him.</p><p>This… was him in his Extreme Yin Mode. After his Eight-Headed Devil Art, there was his main body mode, Extreme Yang Mode, and the most powerful Yin Yang Integration Destroyer Mode. He was not even sure just how powerful he would be if he unleashed his full strength.</p><p>‘I think I’m more than 10 times more powerful compared to when I fought Xiao Zizhu back then.’ Lu Sheng rubbed his palms together. He stood up. He felt extremely satisfied with the benefits he reaped from this return.</p><p>His main body was already standing on the boundary of becoming a Weapon Grandmaster. With another step, he would enter a whole new level.</p><p>Since ancient times, it could be said that none of the Weapon Grandmasters made progress as quickly as he did.</p><p>‘Other factors aside, the special ability Time Freeze alone enables me to crush all other beings under the Divine Intellect tier. If I hadn’t tricked Xiao Zizhu with the Pain Mirror back then and caught him off guard, I would’ve been the one who lost. Now, the one I can easily contact is Divine Lord Aurora Polaris of the Thousand Sun Sect. Maybe I can have him teach me a thing or two.’</p><p>Divine Lord Aurora Polaris’s experience was extremely simple and proper.</p><p>As the Shifting Moth’s elder brother, he was an immense being from a barren Other World that was in contact with Great Yin. He had been in a deep slumber back then. When he was discovered, he was recruited as a disciple by the former Thousand Sun Sect’s master because of his gentle nature.</p><p>As for whether Divine Lord Aurora Polaris and the Shifting Moth were related by blood or not, nobody knew. Lu Sheng could not care less anyway.</p><p>However, it was true that Aurora Polaris was extremely gentle, and was a friendly person. It was precisely because of this that the various Divine Lords and Rogue Divine Weapons of the Thousand Sun Sect were willing to let him inherit the position.</p><p>After confirming that, Lu Sheng stood up and walked to the main door. A silver Yang Essence drifted out of his fingertip, and he tapped the door lightly. The Yang Essence immediately turned into a thin line, and automatically transformed into a silver pattern, which was imprinted on the door.</p><p>“Click.”</p><p>The door opened.</p><p>Duanmu Wan was squatting beside the door as she prepared to send the food in her hands inside through a special channel. When she heard the sudden noise, she quickly stood up and lifted her head.</p><p>“Master! You’re coming out of seclusion?” Her beautiful face was laced with a hint of happiness as she quickly addressed him respectfully.</p><p>In the recent years, as the gap between their strengths and status widened, Duanmu Wan behaved more and more respectful before Lu Sheng.</p><p>Save for the occasional forlorn and gloomy look, there was not much of a problem with her. Her strength was average, but she was very good at management. She had set Lu Sheng’s Prime Devil Sect in perfect order.</p><p>Many a time, King Shadow and Elder Shi would leave the not-so-important matters to her.</p><p>Hence, although Duanmu Wan’s strength was only at the Earth Prime tier, with the Divine Weapon Lu Sheng gave her, she was also at the rank of a Divine Weapon Master.</p><p>However, she was considered an artificial Divine Weapon Master. Compared to the Divine Weapon Masters who were actually recognized by Divine Weapons, she was at most as powerful as a person at the Earth Prime tier.</p><p>“How long have I been in seclusion?” Lu Sheng asked casually.</p><p>“It has been more than two months, Master,” Duanmu Wan replied carefully.</p><p>“Has it?” Lu Sheng slightly considered the difference in time flow. He had spent more than a year in the Town World.</p><p>‘There’s still a slight deviation. The difference in time flow isn’t 10 times…’ He shook his head inwardly. He knew that there had to have been some mistakes in his formation or in some other part of the entire thing.</p><p>“Did anything serious happen in the sect or the manor?” Lu Sheng took the black cloak which hung on the wall as he walked toward the Devil Palace’s main hall with Duanmu Wan.</p><p>“Everything’s fine in the sect. As for the manor, her ladyship went out for a walk and had brought back an unconscious girl of unknown origin. We are currently trying to investigate her true identity,” Duanmu Wan said softly.</p><p>Lu Sheng paused in his steps. He asked, “Oh? How old is the girl? Are there any abnormalities?”</p><p>Duanmu Wan shook her head.</p><p>“There are no abnormalities, but that’s the greatest abnormality! It’s because before her ladyship goes out for a walk, we’ve always had our people clear out the land beforehand. Nobody could’ve easily entered the area. Even a flying bug can only enter after getting our permission, let alone another person.”</p><p>“What’s her name?”</p><p>“Uh… She claims that she has lost her memories. Her ladyship gave her the name Lu Ran, with your surname,” Duanmu Wan tread carefully.</p><p>“The sect, or even the Thousand Sun, none of them can confirm her background?” Lu Sheng was starting to feel shocked.</p><p>“Yes. However, Elder Shi and the others have seen her. The girl is an ordinary human. There’s nothing abnormal about her, and she doesn’t pose any threat,” Duanmu Wan replied carefully.</p><p>Lu Sheng stood there as his face grew grim.</p><p>Currently, the Prime Devil Sect appeared to be merely carrying on the good work of its predecessors. However, he had Deep Blue, and was actually in seclusion mode. The Prime Devil Sect’s power only served as his outer protection.</p><p>When the time was ripe and he could rise to the highest heavens, he would spread his dominion over the Great Yin and crush all his enemies who conspired against him openly and in secret.</p><p>However, he was the only one who knew about this. Even his wife and son, who were the closest to him, had no idea of his current condition.</p><p>Everyone in the Other Worlds was of the opinion that he would at least stay a Divine Lord for hundreds or even a thousand years.</p><p>He did not believe that there would be someone who would pick this time to go against him. Also, he had Li Shunxi on his side. The Divine Weapon within Li Shunxi was able to foresee the future. If there was anything amiss, he would have definitely warned him.</p><p>That was also a great guarantee for him.</p><p>“Bring her to me in a moment.” With that, Lu Sheng strode into the main hall.</p><p>“Dong… Dong… Dong…”</p><p>The discussion bell was rung.</p><p>The upper echelons of the Prime Devil Sect knew what this meant. The sect master had come out of his seclusion, and was summoning everyone for a discussion.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
