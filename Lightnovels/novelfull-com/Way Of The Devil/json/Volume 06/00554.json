There’s no distinct difference between a Weapon Grandmaster and a Divine Lord.’</p><p>The more Lu Sheng experimented, the more he felt that the Heart Devil World was merely a tough and mysterious material world. There was no unique enhancement for a Divine Lord.</p><p>With the lingering question in his mind, he returned to the Prime Devil Palace. After asking Xu Feila and the others about the time, he noticed that he had spent just three days in the Werewolf World.</p><p>In those three days, the Evil Spirits did not display any special changes. They seemed to be lying in wait.</p><p>He seized this opportunity to study the Heart Devil World by killing the Evil Spirits.</p><p>Time passed by slowly…</p><p>With the Evil Spirits being cleared away in great numbers, it was already winter. There were four days of snow, and the entire Autumn Moon County was a scene of white. The bloody scene that was created days ago had been completely concealed.</p><p>Lu Sheng had a rough idea about the size of the Heart Devil World now.</p><p>His Heart Devil World only spanned the area of the four residential buildings and a road which circled around them. Beyond that circle, it was all pitch-black darkness.</p><p>He attempted to walk toward the darkness, but after walking for a few hours into the dark, all he could see was still pitch-black darkness. There was nothing there.</p><p>Also, regardless how far he kept walking into the darkness, it would only take him a dozen breaths to return to the residential building.</p><p>His entire Heart Devil World was only the size of a football field. Every unit was occupied by the corpses of the people he killed. Some of them were humans, some of them were demons, and many of them were fiends.</p><p>They did not move. They maintained their appearance from right before their respective deaths.</p><p>All this time, Lu Sheng slaughtered a large number of Evil Spirits. He even attempted to pull them into his Heart Devil World. The results were that the Evil Spirits were not much different from other creatures. They would utterly lose their vitality in three breaths after being pulled into the world.</p><p>Vaguely, Lu Sheng seemed to have understood the powerfulness of a Weapon Grandmaster…</p><p>….</p><p>The warm teacup was as smooth and spotless as a piece of white jade. Emerald tea sat within the cup while emitting a faint aroma. A long tea leaf floated near the surface with its tip pointing downward. It resembled a small upturned spike.</p><p>Lu Sheng sat before the window and looked at the boundless snowy fields outside. He exhaled slightly.</p><p>‘After my breakthrough, I’ve pulled 100 creatures into my Heart Devil World already. This includes Evil Spirits, demons, and even devils. After killing so many, the Heart Devil World still remains unchanged… It looks like I’ll have to find some new opponents to experiment on,’ he pondered.</p><p>“Dong! Dong! Dong!”</p><p>The door of his study was being knocked on.</p><p>“Sect Master, the grand elder is here.”</p><p>“Send him in,” Lu Sheng replied drily.</p><p>“Click.”</p><p>His teacher, Liu Xianzi, sauntered into the study, looking slightly frail. It was clear that he had yet to recover from the grave injuries he’d suffered the other day.</p><p>“Currently, various locations are being quarantined. The Autumn Moon County is almost completely cleaned. However, we’ve lost too many civilians in the incident. Practically 90% of the population had been killed by the Evil Spirits. What do you plan to do next?”</p><p>“Did the county executive and the others send you to ask me this, Teacher?” Lu Sheng smiled.</p><p>“What county executive, that’s merely a title with no real power anymore.” Liu Xianzi shook his head. “The civilians were almost wiped out. The survivors were either members of the great families or strong sects. The weak can’t even survive in this world. We’re feeling lost as well. If the Evil Spirits decide to swarm us, where should we go? As the sect master, you should be able to give us some directions by now.”</p><p>“Where should we go?” Lu Sheng muttered to himself. “Amid the turbulence of today’s world, the Great Song and Great Yin are all afflicted by Devil Disasters and rampaging Evil Spirits. The people are in dire straits. Nobody can be lucky and avoid that fate. Only facing the challenges head on and protecting ourselves with strength can we have a chance at survival.”</p><p>“So, you’re saying?” Liu Xianzi’s expression turned solemn.</p><p>“I plan to recruit more disciples,” Lu Sheng replied. “I want to give everyone equal opportunities at becoming stronger. They can join my Prime Devil Sect as long as their qualities are suitable.”</p><p>“How’s that different from the three sects?” Liu Xianzi was puzzled.</p><p>“Of course it’s different.” Lu Sheng smiled. “I plan to pick a location and build an ultimate safe zone. If a person qualifies to join my Prime Devil Sect, that person will have the right to bring three people into the safe zone.”</p><p>“A linking system? That’s a good idea.” Liu Xianzi nodded.</p><p>“However—”</p><p>“Dong! Dong! Dong! Dong!”</p><p>Lu Sheng was not finished. His door was being knocked on urgently again.</p><p>“Sect Master! Urgent update from the field!” said a frantic female disciple from outside.</p><p>Lu Sheng adjusted his expression, and quickly responded, “Send it in,”</p><p>The door opened. A young female disciple with black hair and black pupils walked quickly into the study. She held up a dark golden envelope and placed it on the study’s table.</p><p>Lu Sheng stretched out a hand, and the envelope leapt into the air immediately. It fell into his hands.</p><p>Black Devil Qi spread out. The outer shell of the envelope immediately melted away, revealing the letter within it.</p><p>“The sun and the brilliant moon, the scorching sun burns the skies. Under the invasion of the Evil Spirits, the people under the heavens have no way to make a living and are in a serious situation. In order to save the people from this danger, the Golden Morning abode master the rising burner, Cheng Li, cordially invites fellow taoists to work together for this cause.” The letter was signed off by the Sky Burning Taoist, Cheng Li.</p><p>“The Sky Burning Taoist, what an arrogant title.” Lu Sheng raised his eyebrows. He casually handed over the letter to Liu Xianzi.</p><p>Liu Xianzi scanned it, and had a slight change in expression.</p><p>“I’ve heard of this Sky Burning Taoist before. The day before this, there had been rumors that he had single-handedly killed more than 100,000 Evil Spirits. It was only when the Evil Spirit King came to deal with him that he was stopped, but he was merely repelled.”</p><p>“The Evil Spirit King? What rank is that?” Lu Sheng was intrigued. “This Great Yin is like a deep mountain. The Evil Spirit army has forced all of these powerful characters to show themselves with their advance.”</p><p>“According to ordinary reckoning, it should be of the same rank as the man within the flames whom you’ve seen before,” Liu Xianzi said solemnly. “Little Sheng, don’t let your guard down.”</p><p>“Mhm, I understand.” Lu Sheng nodded. “If that’s true, then I reckon this Sky Burning Taoist is a new generation Weapon Grandmaster?”</p><p>Liu Xianzi shook his head, and said, “It’s not that easy to become a Weapon Grandmaster. I reckon he’s just an extreme expert among the Divine Lords.”</p><p>“Yeah…” Lu Sheng smiled and placed the paper on the table.</p><p>“Do you plan to go?” Liu Xianzi asked.</p><p>“Of course… not. I’ll have to deal with the trouble here first. The one I killed in the Autumn Moon County last time was a Title Evil Spirit. There’s a more powerful being behind it,” said Lu Sheng as he shook his head.</p><p>“Are you confident?”</p><p>“Confident? Who knows.” Lu Sheng shifted his gaze outside the window. His gaze seemed to have crossed the vast snowy fields as he looked at some unknown land somewhere.</p><p>*****************</p><p>“Smack!”</p><p>A small pebble fell onto the ground. Then, it rolled all the way to the edge of the cliff before finally landing softly on a large and rough clay-colored hand.</p><p>On the cliff wall that was not covered by snow, a strong-looking clay-colored man whose lower body was merged with the rocks while his upper body was bare retracted his right hand and looked at the pebble in his hand.</p><p>His upper body alone was more than ten meters in height. He had thick arms that were strong and tough like pre-weathered granite.</p><p>The man had ram-like curved horns on his head. They curled around each of his ears. His entire body seemed to be covered in a thick layer of dried mud, and every movement of his resulted in a large amount of yellow ash falling off.</p><p>“One great shark is dead.”</p><p>The man’s lower body grew out of the rock like the figurehead of a ship. He raised his chin and looked in the direction of the faraway Autumn Moon County.</p><p>“It seems like Her Majesty was right to send me here ahead of time. As expected, her judgement was not wrong. This world holds much more powerful secrets compared to the other worlds.”</p><p>“Bam!”</p><p>Far away, a large group of Evil Spirits flew away from the snowy grounds and scattered into the air.</p><p>“Master Jorah, the third army has fallen as well. When do you plan on making a move? We need powerful backup.” A pure white Evil Spirit flew nearer from the faraway skies and reminded him with a sharp voice.</p><p>“Give me the precise location,” said the man in a low voice.</p><p>The Evil Spirit fell silent for a moment. Then, wisps of white Qi wafted out from its body, and plunged quickly into the heart of the man’s palm.</p><p>“Understood. Well then… let’s start with the nearest one.” The man stretched his hands and grabbed onto the rock walls beside him. Then, he suddenly pulled himself out.</p><p>“Rumble…”</p><p>The loud sound of the vibration kept spreading outward. His entire lower half was forcibly pulled out of the granite wall. He did not have feet or blood and flesh. Instead, he had countless clay-colored roots.</p><p>Densely packed tendrils wriggled in the hundreds wantonly like the tentacles of countless octopi.</p><p>The man loosened his grip, and his body suddenly crashed downward. A large number of tendrils stabbed into the snow-covered ground below.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>The instant the tendrils stabbed into the ground, the entire ground started to sizzle as if its moisture was being sucked away.</p><p>The Spiritual Essence of the entire ground was being continually devoured by the tendrils.</p><p>“Bam, bam, bam…”</p><p>Some parts of the ground suddenly caved in. The earth grew weaker by the second. It was even starting to show difficulty in withstanding the weight of the snow.</p><p>The man steadied himself and lifted his head to look in the direction of the Autumn Moon County. He started moving fast in that direction like a spider.</p><p>“Evil Spirit King Jorah!”</p><p>All of a sudden, two blood-colored shadows descended from the skies and barred the man’s way with precision. They dropped to the snowy ground.</p><p>The blood-colored radiance faded, revealing a male and female Divine Lord from the Blood Sun.</p><p>The man was bald and had a big and tall physique. There was a red triangular mark in between his eyes. The woman had a voluptuous body with prominent protrusions of the body. She wore a black dress, and her face was a mess of savage-looking scars as if she had been burnt.</p><p>“Is this it, Wuxin?” asked the woman with hesitation.</p><p>“That’s right. According to the Turquoise Conch Agency’s coordinates, this fellow is the most powerful Evil Spirit King in the area,” said Divine Lord Wuxin with a frown on his face. His expression was slightly solemn. “Sect Master Aurora Polaris has ordered me to return earlier to stop this guy. He’s capable of devouring the Spiritual Essence from the depths of the earth. Once he steals too much of the land’s Spiritual Essence, not an inch of grass will be able to grow here for hundreds of years. It’ll turn into a dead zone.”</p><p>“Let’s do it together. We’ll make it quick,” the woman said with a nod. She had a bad feeling as she looked at Jorah’s huge body size.</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>Jorah looked down at the two little Divine Lords in front of him. His expression was slightly helpless.</p><p>“Actually, I’m an advocate of peace. Can we talk this through? You can go on kill whatever you have to kill, and I’ll do what I have to. Can’t we stay out of each other’s businesses?”</p><p>“It’s not up to you, big guy.” Divine Lord Wuxin’s expression was cold. He lifted his right arm slowly, and his entire arm slowly turned into a dark red ruler.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
