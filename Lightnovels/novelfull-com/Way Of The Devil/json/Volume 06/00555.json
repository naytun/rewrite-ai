With a swing of his arm, he unleashed a huge patch of purple radiance. It transformed into countless palm-sized eagles, which in turn dashed wildly toward the large group of Evil Spirits below.</p><p>The Evil Spirits were completely powerless against them. In the blink of an eye, they were consumed by the purple radiance eagles. They did not even last for two breaths.</p><p>The group of panting cultivators covered in bloodstains was spared. The leader of the group was a white-haired old man. At this moment, he quickly calmed down and cupped his fists at the skies.</p><p>“Thank you for lending a hand, Divine Lord Tong Ling. Fortunately, the members of the Youyin Sect have arrived in the nick of time. Otherwise, we would’ve suffered grave losses.”</p><p>The purple-robed man nodded drily. “There’s no need to be this polite. This area is too close to the Evil Spirits’ base. It’s best for your group to leave now.”</p><p>The old man nodded. “We’ll leave now.” After responding, he quickly led his remaining companions and made a swift retreat toward the mountains far away.</p><p>When the purple-robed man saw this, he planned to continue on his way in the distant direction. He readied himself to save the next wave of survivors.</p><p>However, the moment he turned around, he was shocked.</p><p>Without him noticing, a clay-colored giant more than 30 meters tall had appeared behind him.</p><p>The giant was very close to him. The tip of its nose almost touched him.</p><p>“You’ve touched me,” said the giant with a straight face.</p><p>“Are you an Evil Spirit?” Divine Lord Tong Ling backstepped quickly with a slight change in expression. He could not believe that he did not even sense when this giant had appeared behind him.</p><p>“Actually, I’m really an advocate of peace.” The giant sighed; his gaze was helpless. “Alas, you’ve touched me.”</p><p>“Die!” The triangular mark between Divine Lord Tong Ling’s brows glowed with blue radiance. Huge patches of blue feathers that resembled flowing water suddenly appeared around him.</p><p>Countless feathers flowed and swirled before weaving themselves into a giant pair of blue eagle wings which spanned more than 10 meters.</p><p>He flapped the wings, and they conjured up a violent gale which blew toward the giant.</p><p>This gale was not any ordinary wind. It contained various negative effects such as poison, weakening, debilitating, hallucinations, and others.</p><p>“With my blood, oh wind, heed my call! Tornado Ram— pfft!”</p><p>A giant clay-colored palm bore down on Tong Ling from above. He was immediately pressed against the ground.</p><p>“Bam!”</p><p>After a dull thud.</p><p>The huge hand slowly removed itself from the ground. A patch of dark red goo was left on the ground.</p><p>“Anyone who touches me might just want to harm me. I had no intentions of making a move in the beginning… Why did you have to force me?” Jorah retracted his hand, his gaze forlorn.</p><p>“You?!” A beam of red light shot toward him from afar. It was another impressive-looking Divine Lord from the Thousand Sun Sect who came as reinforcement. It was a red-clothed kid with delicate features.</p><p>He had just arrived when he coincidentally witnessed the scene of Jorah killing Divine Lord Tong Ling with a palm.</p><p>The regenerative ability of a Divine Lord was completely useless. With a smack of his palm, Tong Ling’s flesh and blood crumbled, his spirit was obliterated, and his vitality became nonexistent.</p><p>The red-clothed kid wore a frightened expression. There were not many Divine Lords in Great Yin, yet this giant killed one of them easily as if it was nothing.</p><p>“Don’t be afraid.” Jorah snapped back to his senses and looked at the kid. “I’m actually a peace-loving being. As long as you don’t attack me, I won’t harm you.”</p><p>“Heh… Heheh… Is that so?” The kid wore a sour expression as he stepped back slowly. “In that case, you should rest for now. Just act as if you hadn’t seen me. I’ll go back now… and…”</p><p>“Just go… Don’t worry, I won’t harm you as long as you don’t touch me first,” said Jorah in a gentle tone.</p><p>“T-thanks…” The red-clothed kid managed to let out a chuckle. After retreating for a fair distance, he turned around abruptly and dashed back where he came from.</p><p>“Bam!”</p><p>He rammed into a huge clay-colored face.</p><p>Without him noticing, Jorah had already appeared behind him. The instant the kid sped off at full speed, he was unable to alter his course in time, and slammed into the left side of Jorah’s face.</p><p>“You’ve touched me!” Jorah’s eyes suddenly bulged.</p><p>“No!” The kid looked frightened. He turned in another direction and flew away.</p><p>“Bam!”</p><p>However, he was too late. A terrifying huge hand instantly caught up to him from behind. Then, as if swatting a fly, it smacked him to the ground.</p><p>“Why… Why do you have to force me?!” Jorah appeared pained. “I’ve already let you go. Why did you insist on harming me…”</p><p>He removed his hand. Another patch of mashed meat appeared on the ground. Divine Weapon and corpse were all mashed together. In no time, slender tendrils stabbed into them and absorbed the Essence Energy contained within.</p><p>“Your Majesty… Jorah doesn’t want to harm any lives, but why are the living souls intentionally harming Jorah?” The giant man spread his arms out and cried out helplessly.</p><p>***************</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>Lu Sheng pressed down on a humanoid Evil Spirit before him. He slammed it mercilessly into the rock wall behind him.</p><p>“Struggle. Let’s see how much longer you’re able to move without a head.”</p><p>“I’m a Title Evil Spirit. I am… Night Sulfur Evil Spirit Kandi! Don’t you dare look down on me!!” Although the humanoid Evil Spirit did not have a head, his body still burned with grayish-white flames.</p><p>The earth was shaking, and the air was wailing shrilly. The surrounding space contorted with grayish-black cracks as he burned.</p><p>“You’ve gotten on my nerves! You living soul! Requiem Shadow! Argh!” The humanoid Evil Spirit howled.</p><p>“Pooh!”</p><p>The sound stopped abruptly.</p><p>Lu Sheng stuffed the Evil Spirit’s left foot into his mouth. He shook his huge wolf head and started to chew on it.</p><p>Previously, there was a densely packed Evil Spirit Army around them which numbered in the tens of thousands. Currently, there was only a handful of them left, and they were swiftly fleeing the scene.</p><p>‘That makes it 13. There’s quite a number of them. The more Evil Spirits are gathered, the more Title Spirits there are among them. Could it be that these Title Evil Spirits are actually the natural evolved form of Evil Spirits after devouring Spiritual Essence in excess?’ Lu Sheng pondered as he chewed.</p><p>He swept his gaze across the distant group of people who appeared like ants at this distance. They were the ordinary citizens who’d been trapped by the Evil Spirits before this.</p><p>Without giving an explanation, Lu Sheng strode in the direction in which he sensed something else.</p><p>‘Truth be told, the Evil Spirits taste bad. Also, I don’t like to eat their heads,’ Lu Sheng mused.</p><p>His colossal Hundred-head Wolf’s form moved with great speed. Although it was much smaller in Great Yin, he was still more than 10 meters in height. The strength he possessed was also about a third of his most powerful main body form.</p><p>After passing through a patch of hilly grounds, the terrain opened up suddenly before him. It was a vast grayish plain.</p><p>The plain was full of countless Evil Spirits. There was a dozen big and tall figures interspersed among them. They were impressive-looking Title Evil Spirits.</p><p>“Werewolf?”</p><p>“The aura of a living soul!”</p><p>“Flesh and blood! I smell flesh and blood!”</p><p>The Title Evil Spirits turned to look at Lu Sheng as one.</p><p>Due to the overwhelming numbers of Evil Spirits on the plain, the ground seemed to have been dyed gray as well.</p><p>“Kill him!” a Title Evil Spirit roared.</p><p>“Pcchht! Pcchht! Pcchht! Pcchht! Pcchht!”</p><p>In an instant, countless Evil Spirits leapt into the air and launched themselves at Lu Sheng wildly.</p><p>For a time, Lu Sheng’s field of vision was completely blotted out by the Evil Spirits. Countless gray shadows surged toward him in heaven-covering waves.</p><p>Lu Sheng suddenly had a thought. ‘With this many Evil Spirits, isn’t this the perfect opportunity to test out the Heart Devil World?’</p><p>With a thought, his spirit instantly covered an area of several thousand meters around him.</p><p>“Splash!”</p><p>Tens of thousands of Evil Spirits suddenly vanished. These half-substantial, half-void beings were one of the existences that could be pulled into the Heart Devil World.</p><p>In an instant, the number of Evil Spirits on the plain was reduced by half.</p><p>One breath…</p><p>Two breaths…</p><p>Three breaths…</p><p>Lu Sheng’s brows furrowed slightly. He felt a small surge of extremely pure Spirit Power that suddenly appeared within his body. This surge of Spirit Power merged directly into his main body and blended with perfect harmony. His spirit’s origin was strengthened as a result.</p><p>“So… this is what the Heart Devil World is for.” Lu Sheng instantly understood that he had been devouring too few spirits of living souls before this. Hence, with his current terrifyingly immense spirit volume, he could not even feel the enhancement.</p><p>However, when he devoured tens of thousands of Evil Spirits this time, the enhancement he felt was especially evident.</p><p>“What happened?!” One of the Title Evil Spirits felt shocked and furious at the same time. Its snake-like body kept retreating in a frenzy.</p><p>“Something has devoured the Eleventh Army Corp!” shouted another Evil Spirit.</p><p>“Kill him! Kill that living being!”</p><p>The Evil Spirits swarmed toward Lu Sheng like bees. They were convinced that Lu Sheng was playing some trick on them. An ocean of Evil Spirits charged toward Lu Sheng with the intention of getting close enough to tear him into pieces and devour him.</p><p>However, when the countless Evil Spirits got within 100 meters from Lu Sheng, they instantly disappeared. It was as if they had charged into another dimension.</p><p>With the wild insurgence of the Evil Spirits, Lu Sheng clearly felt that his Heart Devil World seemed to be swelling and expanding.</p><p>However, the Evil Spirits were not ready to give up. There seemed to be no end to their numbers as they continued to charge toward Lu Sheng.</p><p>For a time, the world all around him seemed to be filled with Evil Spirits only.</p><p>Lu Sheng glanced at the endless stream of Evil Spirits from afar. He raised a hand and slowly reached for the skies.</p><p>“Just as well. Let me see… your limit.”</p><p>Wisps of gray aura slowly emanated from him and spread in all directions.</p><p>The gray serpent mark appeared between his brows. An extremely mystical sensation reached Lu Sheng’s mind from his Heart Devil World.</p><p>“Yield Life and Death!”</p><p>“Hiss!” A circle of gray air suddenly spread through 50 kilometers around Lu Sheng.</p><p>For an instant, the Evil Spirits in the range of 50 kilometers seemed to have frozen over. Then, their bodies slowly rose and vanished into the air.</p><p>The Title Evil Spirits, ordinary Evil Spirits… all living souls, without discriminating between friend or foe, were instantly pulled into the void by some peculiar power that was impossible to fight against. They were powerless against it.</p><p>In mere three breaths, Lu Sheng was the only one left in the area of 500 kilometers.</p><p>******************</p><p>On the yellow, dried ground, Jorah suddenly lifted his head and looked in the faraway direction.</p><p>“I hear it…”</p><p>He had been feasting on the corpse of a giant beast which the Evil Spirits had brought him. He seemed to have sensed something as he slowly let go of the corpse in his hands.</p><p>“Why… I’ve tried my best to avoid this. Why must you harm me… Why?!” Jorah closed his eyes in pain. He strode in that direction.</p><p>He traversed the great plains and several hills. In no time, Jorah saw a lone wolf standing amid a land of death from afar.</p><p>However, the novel appearance of the wolf with hundreds of heads stunned him and made him stop in his tracks.</p><p>“I… don’t want to hurt you. I’m a lover of peace. If possible, we should both go about our separate businesses. What do you say to us not meddling in each others’ lives?” Jorah posed the question, feeling slightly helpless.</p><p>Lu Sheng was slightly stunned as well. He looked at the dense network of roots which was Jorah’s lower body. Countless pairs of wolf eyes blinked.</p><p>“Of course we can. Actually, you don’t have to worry, I’m a peace-lover as well.” He quickly managed warm smiles with his 300 heads.</p><p>“Really?” Jorah was stunned.</p><p>“Of course! Absolutely!” Lu Sheng’s tone grew warmer and warmer. He was not able to pull this great fellow into his Heart Devil World. If he could eat him, he might just prove to be highly nutritious…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
