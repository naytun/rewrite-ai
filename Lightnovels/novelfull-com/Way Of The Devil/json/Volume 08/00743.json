She was looking at Lu Sheng, who was sitting at his desk sipping tea, with a serious expression.</p><p>“Actually, I’ve been keeping a secret from you.” She appeared flustered, which actually reflected the state of her mind. She did not know where she should start.</p><p>Lu Sheng smiled, and spoke in a gentle tone, “To be honest with you, I have a little secret as well.”</p><p>Lu Hongye was slightly stunned. She did not seem to have expected this.</p><p>“Go on, tell me.”</p><p>“You first, Father.”</p><p>The two of them spoke at the same time.</p><p>When they realized it, both of them found the moment funny. Lu Sheng gestured for his daughter to sit.</p><p>“Alright, I’ll go first.” Lu Sheng reached out and gave Lu Hongye’s cheek a pinch. “Actually, I’m not merely an ordinary shopkeeper of an antique store. Ever since my plan on the other side has been largely completed, I have been giving this some thought. You should be able to take some shock by now, and that’s why I chose to tell you the truth.” Lu Sheng sighed.</p><p>“Actually… what I wanted to tell you was, I’m not an ordinary young graduate as well…” Lu Hongye could no longer hold her words in.</p><p>Another moment of silence lapsed. The two of them exchanged glances.</p><p>“Alright, you go first,” Lu Sheng said while extending a hand.</p><p>Lu Hongye nodded. She clenched her teeth.</p><p>“Actually, my real identity is a princess of the Golden Dragon Tribe, with the Dragon King bloodline running through my veins. I’m now working hard to rescue the Tribe from the invasion of the Black Dragon Tribe! I went out to save the Golden Dragon Cavern after I’ve done my homework yesterday. I was lucky that I got there in time, or else things would’ve been really bad!”</p><p>Lu Sheng looked at Lu Hongye with a poker face.</p><p>“How about this, you’re an adult now. I’ll allow you to go save the Golden Dragon Tribe every day after you’re done with your harp practice. However, you must be back home by eleven. Okay?”</p><p>Lu Sheng’s tone of speaking to a child slightly surprised Lu Hongye. It seemed that her father did not believe her in the least.</p><p>“I… I’m telling you the truth!” she retorted.</p><p>“I get it.” Lu Sheng nodded.</p><p>However, he did not display any look of shock like any ordinary person would.</p><p>“If that’s all you wanted to say, it’s my turn now.” Lu Sheng drank some hot tea and exhaled hot breath.</p><p>“Starting from tomorrow, I might be meeting the main god of the Light God System, the Glorious Radiant Lord. I might not make it home in time for dinner. If you’re feeling hungry, you should just eat without me. Oh, and don’t forget to bring a thermos with you when you go rescue the Golden Dragon Tribe. I remember that you’re on your period right now. It’d do you good to drink more hot water. Also, if the Shadow God comes here looking for me, just tell him that I won’t be in for the moment…”</p><p>“Wa… Wait!” Lu Hongye was dumbfounded. “Dad, I’m telling you the truth!”</p><p>“I’m telling you the truth as well,” Lu Sheng said with a nod.</p><p>“I’m not joking with you!” Lu Hongye slammed her palms on the desk and stood up. She raised her pitch. Her expression became increasingly sullen.</p><p>“You know that I’m not a person who likes jokes,” Lu Sheng replied with a nod.</p><p>“…”</p><p>“Also…” Lu Sheng suddenly paused. “Uh, it just so happens that I have a guest now. You should stay as well so that I won’t have to explain myself again.”</p><p>He suddenly clapped his hands.</p><p>Soon enough, the butler Hank’s voice could be heard from the mansion’s door. He seemed to be greeting some guests.</p><p>In no time, the door to the study was opened.</p><p>Three scenesters with half-shaved heads walked into the study in single file. They wore black leather outfits covered with chains.</p><p>“Esteemed Arc Light King, I’m the God of Art, Gede,” said the man with a lip piercing in a loud voice.</p><p>“I’m the God of Harvest, Arnie!” said the woman whose face seemed to have swollen from a beating. She had a nose piercing.</p><p>“I’m the God of Gust, Kaman!” said the final man with a mohawk and black eyes.</p><p>“Greetings, I’m the Arc Light King.” Lu Sheng nodded. “I’ve called you here today to tell you about my plan, which I’ll need the three of you to cooperate for. I’ve discussed this with the other main gods already. What’s left are the details—”</p><p>“Dad!” He was halfway through his sentence when the four of them heard Lu Hongye’s cry. Tears were streaking down her face. She stared at Lu Sheng with a pained expression.</p><p>“It’s only been a short while… Why have you… how could you… become this?!”</p><p>She stood up and walked up to Lu Sheng.</p><p>“It’s my fault… I’ve been too egocentric lately. I didn’t notice the changes in you at all! It’s my fault… it’s me…”</p><p>She felt a grievance that was difficult to describe welling up inside herself.</p><p>She had only been away for a short while, yet her father had become…</p><p>Lu Hongye did not know if the Golden Dragon Tribe had any medicine to treat brain illnesses. Regardless, she would save her father, no matter what it took!</p><p>He was still so young! There was so much life before him!</p><p>Lu Sheng and the three gods looked at her crying her heart out without saying a word.</p><p>“I’m sorry…” Lu Sheng stroked his daughter’s hair. “My daughter might’ve been under too much stress lately. Her emotions are unstable right now. My deputy will discuss this matter further with you at another time. I’m sorry. I’ll have to tend to her emotions first.”</p><p>“That’s alright. As a main god, it’s our fault for intruding into your time.”</p><p>The three middle gods did not have much to complain about. As gods, their lives were practically endless. A slight delay meant nothing to them.</p><p>“We’ll leave you to this, then. We’ll be taking our leave.”</p><p>The three gods quickly left the study. None of them would use their god power here. This was a show of respect and fear toward Lu Sheng, who was on the rank of a main god.</p><p>After the three of them left, Lu Sheng carried his daughter with her tear-stained face gently.</p><p>“What’re you crying about?” He was slightly helpless. “I’ve been meaning to tell you about this secret for a long time now. However, I was worried that you won’t be able to take it. That’s why I’ve kept it from you for so long. However, at this point, there are things that can no longer be left unsaid. That’s why I—”</p><p>“Enough!” Lu Hongye’s sadness came from her heart. “I’ll… I’ll no longer bother about the Golden Dragon Tribe anymore! I don’t want to be some golden dragon princess. I just want you to be back to normal!”</p><p>“I’ve always been normal,” Lu Sheng said, feeling speechless. “Truth be told, I’ve found out your connection with the Golden Dragon Tribe a long time ago. However, it was inappropriate for me to get involved, thus I merely sent someone to keep an eye on you and protect you. However, I didn’t expect you to progress this quickly, and things have not gone exactly as planned on my side as well. That’s why…”</p><p>“But… But…” Lu Hongye’s beautiful eyes were filled with tears. She was starting to hesitate.</p><p>“I know about your activities with the Golden Dragon Tribe. It’s just that I didn’t want to intervene.” Lu Sheng sighed. “My original plan was for you to experience some hardships so that you’ll be able to train yourself. However, I didn’t expect that…”</p><p>Lu Sheng continued, “Alright, since we’re on the topic, are you still doubting my identity? I’ll show you.”</p><p>“Show me?” Lu Hongye had been a mess from all the crying. However, when she heard that Lu Sheng was actually planning on showing her his identity, she was surprised.</p><p>“How… How’re you going to show me?” She suddenly had a feeling of dread.</p><p>Then, she saw Lu Sheng producing a knife, which he promptly brought down on his own arm.</p><p>“No! Don’t be rash! Dad! Stop!” She immediately leapt forward and hugged Lu Sheng’s arm. She cried even harder now.</p><p>“Dad, I believe you! I believe you, okay?! Don’t make any rash movements!” She could no longer hold back her tears, which kept flowing down.</p><p>“What are you trying to do here…” Lu Sheng was speechless as well. He initially intended to show his daughter his regenerative abilities after severing his own arm. He did not expect…</p><p>“Forget it. I’ll show you the nature of god power.”</p><p>Feeling helpless, he could only use a gentler way. After all, ordinary Sorcerers could manipulate the elements as well. If he wanted to do a demonstration, it was only natural for him to achieve some miraculous feat ordinary people could not achieve.</p><p>“Just promise me that you won’t use a knife!”</p><p>“I promise, I promise.”</p><p>After trying his best to persuade Lu Hongye, she finally let go of Lu Sheng’s arm.</p><p>“Your father has created 99 arcane arts. After they were cultivated to full-mastery, they possessed endless might and have endless possibilities. They’re formidable no matter what pinch I’m in.” When it came to cultivation, Lu Sheng’s expression immediately turned serious.</p><p>As he said this, he pointed at his desk.</p><p>Blackish red mist started to rise and gather above his desk. It condensed into spheres that resembled glass beads with peculiar colors.</p><p>“I’m telling you, don’t judge these little beads by their simple structures and the simplicity of their formation process. Any single one of these can decimate Dawn City,” Lu Sheng said calmly as he pointed at one of the beads.</p><p>When he revealed his ability, Lu Hongye was immediately stunned.</p><p>“This… This is!?” The expression on her beautiful face clearly changed slightly. With her Golden Dragon King bloodline, when she looked at these ordinary-looking beads, she felt a fear in her heart. It was clear just how much power they contained.</p><p>“Look at this!</p><p>“And this!”</p><p>Lu Sheng displayed several other god power methods to her.</p><p>Some time passed…</p><p>When Lu Hongye finally exited the study in the afternoon, her mind was still boggled.</p><p>“Princess! Your Highness! Are you alright?!” The little golden lizard, Nanni flew into the room from an opening beside the window and circled around Lu Hongye.</p><p>“Fine… I’m fine…” Lu Hongye glanced at Nanni with a dull expression. “I just feel that I’ve overworked my brain.”</p><p>This was just like an ordinary person coming home one day when her father suddenly told her that he was the god of creation, and her mother was the Mysterious Lady of the Nine Heavens. The reason for the recent world war was a domestic violence incident caused by her mother accidentally breaking a spatula…</p><p>This great impact on her understanding and perception of the world left her mind in a blank state even by nightfall.</p><p>Suddenly, a chubby little golden dragon hopped and skipped into the room from the window, and shouted, “It’s bad! The Black Dragon Tribe’s main force is here! They’re almost upon the Golden Dragon Kings’ Cavern! Your Highness, do think of something! The elders won’t last much longer!”</p><p>“What!?” Lu Hongye’s mind was stimulated by the news. She shot up to her feet.</p><p>“Let’s go! To the ancestral grounds!” She pulled the little golden dragon and dashed out through the window. She launched herself into the air. “No matter what, we can’t let the ancestral grounds be harmed!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
