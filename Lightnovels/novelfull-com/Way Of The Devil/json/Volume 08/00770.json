An unexplainable shiver travelled from his heart to his head.</p><p>“Disciples of the Green Dew Altar, heed my command! Kill him!” At this moment, he was convinced that the man before him was a madman, a raving lunatic.</p><p>His grand plans were not accomplished yet. If his mission succeeded this time, he would be able to obtain the treasured pill he wanted. His cultivation base would be improved, and his Junyuan Skills would reach unprecedented levels.</p><p>No matter what, he would not fall into the hands of this man.</p><p>His shout startled the people around him.</p><p>The elite disciples around him responded to the order reflexively. Bows were fired from afar, while the blades and spears stabbed with explosive ferociousness. They shot toward Lu Sheng with the sound of the sonic barrier breaking.</p><p>The tips of the sharp weapons closed in on Lu Sheng like a forest of spikes. They came at him from all directions.</p><p>Lu Sheng was not flustered in the face of danger. He reached out and grabbed at the few spears before himself. With a burst of his terrifying energy, about five Martial Arhats were lifted into the air by him. He swept them sideways like they were his club.</p><p>“Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!”</p><p>The ground right in front of him was cleared away in the shape of a fan.</p><p>More than 10 bodies were swept away. They rolled in all directions.</p><p>Lu Sheng lifted his hand and grabbed a spear. With lightning speed, he swept it behind himself. At the same time, he crouched slightly and shot forward. He released the spear and grabbed at Pang Yuanjun among the crowd.</p><p>He managed to dodge the series of uncoordinated attacks on him with his charge. The fired arrows only managed to hit the ground behind him.</p><p>The others merely saw a blur of movements, and Lu Sheng was already before Pang Yuanjun. Their palms met.</p><p>“Bam!”</p><p>With a dull collision, Pang Yuanjun’s body reeled. As he flew through the air, his expression was one of terror.</p><p>The Elders Jing Han and the Sand King all looked bewildered as well.</p><p>This agility! This strength! It had surpassed the limits of their expectations.</p><p>They were all Martial Emperor experts. Even peak Martial Emperors did not possess such a terrifying power.</p><p>After all, there was a limit to how much the human body could take. A peak Martial Emperor would only be able to gain more precise control over their body and obtain more stamina by exploring more Stars. Their overall strength was not much improved compared to ordinary Martial Emperors.</p><p>However, Lu Sheng managed to send Pang Yuanjun reeling with a single palm strike. Whether it was his agility or power, they were slightly unreasonable.</p><p>With no time to think, Lu Sheng had stepped forward and grabbed toward Pang Yuanjun, who had just landed on the ground. The others would definitely not let Lu Sheng capture his target this easily.</p><p>The Sand King tossed a silver flying knife. As it sailed through the air, it unleashed a shrill and deafening whistle.</p><p>The tip of the knife was clearly covered in poison. It had a light blue glow and the blade was carved with exquisite patterns. It had clearly been modified.</p><p>However, Lu Sheng did not understand why a dedicated concealed poisoned weapon was equipped with the patterns which made so much noise.</p><p>Elders Jing Han made their moves from the sides at the same time.</p><p>“Eighteen Strikes of Teng Xuan!”</p><p>“Nekkhamma Sword!”</p><p>The two of them launched their coordinated attacks from the side. A huge power erupted from them both, and two swords closed in on their targets like two silver dragons. Lu Sheng could feel the wind pressing against his cheeks. The terrifying impact force of the two attacks seemingly gave him the faintest threatening feeling at the first moment.</p><p>“Not bad.”</p><p>Lu Sheng nodded slightly. He knew that if he continued onward to grab Pang Yuanjun, he would certainly be hit by the two elders at the waist.</p><p>He did not want to gamble his own waist to grab hold of Pang Yuanjun. He would have his chances. There was no need for him to rush.</p><p>He retracted his hand with lightning speed. Then, he aimed his palms at the Elders Jing Han at the same time.</p><p>His palms glistened with a light bronze sheen as if molded from metal. He parried the two attacks with utmost precision.</p><p>“Clang! Clang!”</p><p>The moment the two elders’ attacks met his palms, they felt a copious amount of earth-shattering power surging at them. Their faces flushed with color, but the color was drained in an instant. They staggered backward. There were cracks on their swords.</p><p>“Spirit Breaker Punch!”</p><p>Pang Yuanjun was going all out. He tapped his own forehead. He seemed to have prodded his own meridian point.</p><p>At that moment, his skin went pink, blood circulated more rapidly, and his muscles bulged. He seemed to be several sizes larger right now.</p><p>“Yuanjun Tenth Skill! Air Blast!”</p><p>He howled and charged toward Lu Sheng. Before anyone noticed, he was wielding steel blades in his hands. He spun his body at high speed, and he seemed to have turned into a tornado which charged toward Lu Sheng along the ground.</p><p>“Fuh!”</p><p>Sand, rocks, dust, and soil were drawn by the tornado. The other elites who had intended to move in for the kill were forced to keep their distance. They did not want to be caught in the wake of this tornado.</p><p>Lu Sheng was taken aback. The muscles on his right arm flexed slightly and his belly swelled.</p><p>This was a lost skill of the Straggling Star Path Toad Method. This was also his first time unleashing this lost skill in actual combat after he reached the unprecedented stage-10.</p><p>Lu Sheng’s belly swelled to the size of a soccer ball in no time. It was as if an actual ball was moving around in his body. At the same time, the density of blood vessels on the surface of his belly increased. His veins arranged themselves in a pattern of a flame flower. It looked peculiar.</p><p>“Odd Path Annihilation!”</p><p>Lu Sheng bent his back slightly. His belly erupted. He seemed to have received an instant amplification of agility and strength. Using his palms like sharp blades, he hacked toward the incoming tornado that was Pang Yuanjun.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>This was the first time where the two of them fought with their full might.</p><p>The tornado merely held out for an instant before it crumbled. Pang Yuanjun’s shoulders were hit by Lu Sheng’s crossing palms. He wailed and reeled like a cannonball. In the blink of an eye, he crashed into the perimeter wall behind him and disappeared among the ruins in dust and soil.</p><p>Lu Sheng wanted to follow up with another blow when the Sand King’s poisoned knives flew at him again. Volleys of poisoned arrows had sealed off his path of pursuit as well.</p><p>“Hmm?” He found this arrow-firing technique interesting.</p><p>Lu Sheng paused. He looked up and gazed into the distance. Atop a stone pillar among the rock forest, a big and tall woman with white hair was sitting upright cross-legged.</p><p>“Go!” Pang Yuanjun spat blood. He peculiarly had a boost in agility as he plunged into the depths of the rock forest. He vanished in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Sheng snorted. He gave chase with lightning speed. However, he was not familiar with the terrain, and had to move at a slower speed.</p><p>The others reacted in time as well. They scattered and gave chase.</p><p>“It’s useless. Stop running. If you come back with me obediently, you won’t have to endure this much pain.” Lu Sheng’s voice was calm and cold. He did not sound like he was talking while giving high-speed pursuit.</p><p>Pang Yuanjun ran with all his might. He felt some blood forming a block at the back of his throat, but he dared not spit it out.</p><p>He knew that if he spat it out, his internal injuries would surely run their course, and he would no longer have any strength to run.</p><p>The Sand King and the elders were chasing after him.</p><p>Lu Sheng had injured Pang Yuanjun before their very eyes while evading directly clashing with them. This had made the three of them feel humiliated.</p><p>It should be known that any single one of them was a famous hero of the generation known by all. They were definitely overlord-ranked individuals.</p><p>They had not thought that they would meet with unexpected failure here.</p><p>Pang Yuanjun ran, while Lu Sheng gave chase. The two of them flitted through the forest at high speed. More than an hour had passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Pang Yuanjun seemed to have activated some meridian point of his which unleashed his formidable potential. He was moving at a speed on par with Lu Sheng’s. On top of that, he knew this land. There were times when Lu Sheng almost lost him.</p><p>As he continued on his run, his surroundings grew more alien to him.</p><p>The forest thickened, while the land dropped. Huge ancient trees with drooping roots emerged. There was faint white mist lingering in the forest as well.</p><p>Pang Yuanjun’s agility was slightly affected as well. However, he did not veer off his course.</p><p>Behind him, Lu Sheng clearly saw him drinking some kind of medicinal wine twice. It clearly rejuvenated him.</p><p>After an unknown period, Pang Yuanjun made a sudden right turn and vanished before his eyes.</p><p>Lu Sheng frowned. He skidded to a stop.</p><p>There was a mountain to his right. There was a dark cave opening slightly taller than a man.</p><p>Air roots like willow branches concealed the opening. The roots were intertwined with vines and several other creepers. The cave opening would have been impossible to spot with a casual glance.</p><p>“Here…” Lu Sheng narrowed his eyes. Pang Yuanjun dashed into this cave with such determination that it was clear that he had planned this beforehand. Perhaps he knew about the existence of this cave.</p><p>However, Lu Sheng did not mind that too much. The stage-10 Straggling Star Path Toad Method did not give him his immense physical strength and agility alone; it gave him terrifying stamina. After spending that much time speeding through the forest, he’d merely used up one-third of his physical ability.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Sheng could faintly feel that the three Martial Emperors who had been on his heels had also vanished somewhere.</p><p>The forest around him was silent. A huge python as thick as his neck was cowering in the book of a tree branch in the distance. It was frightened by the killing intent on Lu Sheng.</p><p>“You’re intending to stop me with this place?” Lu Sheng snickered. He leapt into the cave without hesitation.</p><p>He had just entered the cave when a black shadow charged at him.</p><p>“Rargh!”</p><p>A beast’s howl erupted at Lu Sheng’s ears. A putrid blast of wind with the smell of blood bore down on his head.</p><p>“Die!” Lu Sheng unleashed his stage-10 peak Martial Emperor power. His terrifying explosive strength was complemented by his furious emotions as he struck with his palm.</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>The huge black shadow retaliated with a similar amount of terrifying force and met Lu Sheng’s palm.</p><p>A faint ring of dust spread outward with the two of them as the center.</p><p>Lu Sheng’s blood vessels bulged. He seemed to have grown one size larger. The Qi and blood of his body circulated at high speed, and he exchanged more than 10 palm strikes with the black shadow.</p><p>“Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!”</p><p>The violent palm strikes sent vibrations through the cave walls, loosening sand and pebbles which rained down on them.</p><p>With the meager amount of light streaking in from outside, Lu Sheng finally saw what he was facing.</p><p>It was a huge black bear as tall as three meters. Unlike ordinary bears, this black bear was actually employing martial skills. The force erupted in a frenzy with the flow of its blood and the bulging of its muscles. It was like a natural peak Martial Emperor expert with super strength.</p><p>“Since when did Martial Emperors become this cheap?” Lu Sheng’s expression turned icy.</p><p>“Looks like it’s time to show you just how powerful a health maintenance method can be!”</p><p>He mustered his blood and Qi.</p><p>Although his current constitution was only that of a peak Martial Emperor, his cultivation method’s tier had long surpassed a Martial Emperor. It was now in an unknown realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
