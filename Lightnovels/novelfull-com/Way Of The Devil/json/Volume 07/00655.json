They eventually became influential people in society.</p><p>With the advantage of such powerful network and connections, the God’s Eye was feeling increasingly powerless to fight against the growing Silver Hand.</p><p>A year ago, the God’s Eye could still suppress the overall situation with the advantage of the strength of its upper echelons. However, in the current state, 80% of the most powerful painters of the world, the painting saints, were among the Silver Hand.</p><p>The God’s Eye merely had a single painting saint, Augustus. He was deemed the most powerful on the planet. His world could even influence nature, living spirits, the weather, and the terrain. He was already at an extremely abnormal level.</p><p>Even Lu Sheng found it difficult to imagine how this could be achieved by paintings.</p><p>After Augustus destroyed the third allied painting saints forces of the Silver Hand, the God’s Eye was preserved.</p><p>Lu Sheng was a person who valued talent. Hence, he did not lead the attacks himself.</p><p>Throughout the years, there were no hiccups with gaining insights on that peculiar Void Underworld cultivation method of his. Everything went smoothly. With the help of the other painters, he overcame the bottlenecks with ease.</p><p>The other elements were prepared as well. Once the nine cornerstones were established and the complete crests were formed, his Heart World would start circulating naturally, and he would have broken through to the Confusion Realm completely.</p><p>With too much free time on his hands, Lu Sheng cultivated his physical body to the limits of cultivation.</p><p>He used the Mixed Martial Arts’ Instant Destruction Fist Skills which he obtained in the previous world. He soon regained half his Devil Shadow Fist Emperor’s strength.</p><p>However, the restrictions in this world were greater. He could not firmly unleash his Inner Chain Qi. He could only circulate it within himself to strengthen his body.</p><p>“Alright. You’re dismissed. Do your parts well. I need to see concrete actions,” Lu Sheng said casually.</p><p>The two peak painters before him acted as if they had obtained a great pardon.</p><p>As peak individuals who had gained insights on the painting soul and painting heart, although they were not as powerful as the more advanced and experienced painting saints, they were still peak existences among painters. However, such grand existences were about the same level as dogs before Lu Sheng.</p><p>After the two of them left, Lu Sheng looked out the wooden window. In the dim sunlight, two black crows with dilated pupils were standing on the window sill while they cleaned their feathers.</p><p>There were at least 1000 crows like these two. They were natural living spirits controlled by the Black Feather painting saint. They could detect enemies at the first moment and send out warnings. Their claws were laced with potent toxins. A simple scratch from them would lead to certain death.</p><p>They were only one of the several dozen layers of defense in this headquarters.</p><p>“The devil painting isn’t completed yet… but I can’t wait any longer…” Lu Sheng mumbled. He spun a paintbrush lightly in his hand.</p><p>‘If Augustus is willing, he might be able to mend it for me. However, this can’t be achieved by forcing him to do it. I need a most powerful painting saint who belongs to my camp.’</p><p>Lu Sheng had attempted the feat himself. It was then that he discovered he had no talent in painting.</p><p>After deriving the cultivation method which the painting saint created, the most he could do was reach a level that was close to Augustus’s. However, for some reason, he was always one level inferior to Augustus.</p><p>‘At most, I can stay here for another decade. If I can’t find a way by then, I can only use Deep Blue to derive the most complete structure…’ Lu Sheng did not want to compromise. This structure was extremely important. According to the records of the Void Underworld skill formula, the quality of this structure would determine the potential of his future progress, cultivation rate, his strength in actual combat, and other things.</p><p>Experts of the Confusion Realm and above mostly relied on energy circulation systems such as the Heart World to fight against each other.</p><p>This was the case for Heavenly Devils and beings from other systems.</p><p>Brr… Brr…</p><p>He was deep in thought when the cellphone on the table before him rang.</p><p>He frowned as he picked it up. It was a call from Zhuo Siqing.</p><p>“Hello? What is it?” He generally did not have a good attitude toward his undependable father.</p><p>The reason was no other than the man was a disgrace to him. Of all things to paint, he had to paint notebooks and oil paintings. He even painted them with much attention to details. It was obvious just how much time he had spent observing those things.</p><p>The voice on the other end of the phone hesitated. “Is this Little Yu? I’m your aunt. Something’s happened to your father! Come to Kunming City’s Third General Hospital quick!”</p><p>The loud voice of a woman came from the speaker.</p><p>“Something happened?” Lu Sheng shot to his feet. Although he was embarrassed to have a father like this, he was still grateful for the man’s effort in taking on the responsibilities of both a father and a mother.</p><p>He could not let anything happen to him.</p><p>Lu Sheng swiftly pressed a red button in his drawer.</p><p>A black screen quickly rose to his side. The location of the incoming call’s source was tracked on the screen.</p><p>In a minute, the source of the call was determined.</p><p>It truly was Kunming City’s Third General Hospital.</p><p>“Your father’s been in an accident. The doctors are trying their best right now!” explained this woman who claimed to be his aunt. “Head over from the university, quick. I’ll have someone pick you up!”</p><p>“Alright.” Lu Sheng ended the call. He glanced at his watch.</p><p>“Men!” he shouted in a deep voice.</p><p>There was a crisp knock on the study’s door. A male and a female bodyguard in black combat attire walked in.</p><p>“Have the men of the mechanical department prepare. I want to be on a flight to Kunming City in an hour,” Lu Sheng ordered. He did not seem to be in a good mood.</p><p>“Sir, which plane would you…” the male bodyguard carefully asked with his head lowered.</p><p>“The fastest.” Lu Sheng slammed the paintbrush on the table.</p><p>He clearly remembered that Zhuo Siqing was protected by the family’s bodyguards. Although there was an internal conflict in the family, they usually exercised restraint.</p><p>Originally, he did not want to get himself involved in such trivial matters. He left Zhuo Siqing to his own devices. However, things were not going well with him being caught in an accident.</p><p>“Can’t he not trouble me…” Lu Sheng had not been in a good mood to begin with. His devil painting was not completed yet, and now this came up.</p><p>*****************</p><p>An hour later.</p><p>Lu Sheng stepped out from Kunming City’s international airport. Someone was already waiting for him with a placard outside.</p><p>The airport was packed with people. Lu Sheng did not take the VIP route. Instead, he disguised himself as an ordinary student and walked the general route like everybody else.</p><p>“Over here!” A tanned man waved his placard and shouted at Lu Sheng.</p><p>Lu Sheng hastened over. He followed this man out of the lobby, and waited by the roadside for a while.</p><p>In no time, a luxurious silver sports car pulled up before the two of them.</p><p>“Hop on.” The driver was a beautiful long-haired girl in a form-fitting white sweater and shades.</p><p>Her hair was slightly permed, her eyes were bright, her teeth were white, and her skin was as fair as snow. A sky-blue gemstone pendant hung around her neck. When Lu Sheng got near, he could even pick up a faint scent of expensive perfume.</p><p>Lu Sheng took her up on her offer. He sat in the back seat.</p><p>“My mother is your aunt. I’m Lin Shengya. Judging by our age, I’m your older cousin.” After Lu Sheng got on the car, the girl casually introduced herself.</p><p>“I see. How’s Zhuo Siqing’s condition?” Lu Sheng asked directly after responding to her introduction.</p><p>“Uncle is now out of the critical stage. You’ll know more when we’re at the hospital,” Lin Shengya answered curtly.</p><p>She glanced at Lu Sheng through the rearview mirror. In truth, if her mother had not made her do it, she would not have wanted to come and fetch this cousin of hers.</p><p>She only had one single younger cousin, and that was Zhuo Xinxin. She could not have cared less about this bastard who was a spawn of her uncle’s shenanigans with another woman.</p><p>Lin Shengya did not even want to speak to Lu Sheng. She kept quiet throughout the entire journey.</p><p>She navigated her way through the traffic with familiar movements. After a dozen minutes, the car finally stopped before a slightly battered residential building.</p><p>“We’re here.” Lin Shengya tapped on the steering wheel.</p><p>Lu Sheng frowned and looked outside.</p><p>“This is the hospital?”</p><p>“No, but you should still go down.” Lin Shengya was starting to get impatient.</p><p>At this moment, a young man had already walked up to the car. He looked to be in his twenties. He wore fitting white jerseys, and exquisite-looking earphones hung on his neck.</p><p>“Little Ya, you’ve brought him here?”</p><p>“Mm-hm. He’s the one.” Lin Shengya alighted from the car and pointed at Lu Sheng.</p><p>The man eyed Lu Sheng casually. “What’s the use in summoning him here at this point?”</p><p>Lu Sheng glanced at him when he alighted.</p><p>“Lead the way. Where’s Zhuo Siqing?”</p><p>“Ha, is that how you address your own father?” The man laughed. There was a slight mockery in his tone. “Come with me.”</p><p>Lu Sheng wore no expression as he followed behind the man.</p><p>Lin Shengya followed behind them. The three of them quickly entered a building and went to the top floor.</p><p>After getting out of the elevator, Lin Shengya took out a key and unlocked the door. Then, she ignored Lu Sheng. She kept talking to the man and occasionally played with her phone.</p><p>Lu Sheng went into the room alone. It was not a huge room. A long sickbed was at the center, covered in a huge glass cover. Various instruments could be seen arranged nearly around the bed through the glass cover.</p><p>Zhuo Siqing was lying on the bed. He was completely covered in bandages. Only his weak eyes were open, and were directed toward the two people beside his bed.</p><p>A delicate and pretty girl sat beside his bed. Her hair was tied back in a ponytail. She wore a black dress; her exposed slender legs were covered in white stockings.</p><p>The girl’s beautiful face was tear-stained. It seemed that she had just finished crying. Her eyes were slightly puffy.</p><p>The other person was a simple yet elegant young married woman. There were no flaws in her air and the way she brought herself. Her appearance suggested that she was in her thirties. She wore office clothes. Her reddened eyes were also puffy.</p><p>“Zhuo Siqing, tell me, how did it come to this?” Lu Sheng had no time for the two of them. He immediately stood by the bed and looked at his father.</p><p>“Keh, keh, keh…” Zhuo Siqing choked on his own breath. However, when he saw that his son was not looking friendly and acted as if he would go into a rage at the same time, he felt frightened in his heart. He laughed drily.</p><p>“It’s an accident… I was caught in a road accident… Why are you here? Didn’t I tell them not to inform you?” He directed his final question to the young married woman.</p><p>“Looks like you’re in good spirits.” Lu Sheng was just about to say something when a big and tall fat man in a silver suit entered through the door. Four big and tall young men in suits followed behind him.</p><p>The fat man looked at the standing Lu Sheng. He was obviously faking a smile.</p><p>“Let Big Brother take a look at you. Your legs are broken, tsk, tsk, so are your arms… The doctors say that your liver is ruptured… I’ve told you this before, right? I’ve reminded you to be careful when you’re out of your house. I told you to be careful while crossing the road. Look at yourself now, wasn’t I right?”</p><p>He glanced at a sour-looking Zhuo Siqing. Then, he glanced at Lu Sheng at the side.</p><p>“This must be the spawn of that Chen Xiao. Third Brother, I’m not just saying this because I’m your elder brother, but now that you’re almost done for from the accident, it seems that you’re plotting something by calling him back here…”</p><p>When this man spoke, he would force a smile. However, it was clear that he did not mean it when he smiled. He gave off a cold aura.</p><p>“My niece is here as well. Not bad. You’ve grown prettier.” The fat man suddenly reached out and pinched the young girl’s cheek.</p><p>The young lady was so startled she let out a scream.</p><p>“Smooth, supple!” The fat man guffawed.</p><p>No matter how cowardly Zhuo Siqing was, when he was bullied to this extent, his eyes burned with rage as well. His face flushed so red that it appeared as if blood would start dripping from it.</p><p>“How did my father get into that accident?” Lu Sheng had no feelings for this younger sister from another mother. He was more interested in Zhuo Siqing.</p><p>“What use is there in knowing? They’re not someone our Zhuo Family can go up against.” The fat uncle’s expression suddenly changed as he shook his head when he said this.</p><p>“Don’t tell me that you’re thinking of getting revenge? Kid, it’s not enough to just have courage born from stirred emotions.”</p><p>The current Zhuo Family was being so heavily suppressed that they could not even lift their heads up. This was a public secret.</p><p>Zhuo Siqing was one thing; his daughter Zhuo Xinxin was even too scared to return home. His wife, Lin Xuaner, brought their daughter and him out of the hospital through the night. They did all this to prevent being sneaked up on by the others.</p><p>This family almost had nowhere to go. Everyone was waiting for Zhuo Siqing to write his will and divide his share of the inheritance.</p><p>“Uuu…”</p><p>When Zhuo Xinxin heard the fat man’s words, she could not help but lean forward and cry.</p><p>“What’re you crying about!?” Lu Sheng was feeling irritated. When he heard her crying, he was immediately enraged.</p><p>Zhuo Xinxin immediately shuddered and stopped crying. She dared not.</p><p>The fat man was also startled. When he finally reacted, he felt that he had lost face. He pointed an accusing finger at Lu Sheng and started cursing at him. “You!? You little brat, did you just f*cking shout!?”</p><p>The cousin Lin Shengya and the young man dashed into the room from the stairs when they heard the sound.</p><p>“Dad! Are you alright?” The jersey man walked toward the fat man. He glared at Lu Sheng.</p><p>“Little Yu, please don’t make things worse. Go, go back to the university… I’ll look for you when everything’s settled.” Zhuo Siqing’s lips were slightly trembling as he lay on the bed. “Big Brother, please don’t hold this against him. He’s only a child, a child…” He started pleading toward the fat man.</p><p>“I can’t just let this slip!” The fat man seized this opportunity to speak with a snort. “I’d like to see just how unreasonable this brat can be!”</p><p>“I’ll sign the agreement after this. I’ll do it immediately,” Zhuo Siqing spoke through gritted teeth.</p><p>“Heh, that won’t be enough! Younger Brother, I’ll say this now. You should know the reason for my being here. Even now, you’re trying to gloss things over with me. It won’t be just your daughter and wife who’ll not be free, even this son of yours—”</p><p>“Fuh!”</p><p>Lu Sheng suddenly stood up. His gaze grew cold.</p><p>“Men!”</p><p>“Bam!”</p><p>His voice barely faded when the door was forced open.</p><p>A troop of men in black bulletproof vests and armed with submachine guns charged into the room.</p><p>A big and tall man and woman strode into the room and stood at attention at Lu Sheng’s sides.</p><p>“In half an hour, I want to see every member of the Zhuo Family’s upper echelon,” Lu Sheng said with an ice-cold expression. He scanned the faces of the stunned fat man and his son, and the stunned mother-and-daughter pair. There was also Lin Shengya who was pushed back to the wall while she held her shades in her hand.</p><p>“In here?” the big and tall man asked in a deep voice.</p><p>“In here!” Lu Sheng straightened his posture. Someone draped on a black standard military uniform on him from behind. It was the same outfit the other men wore. However, his shoulders were decorated with dark golden badges.</p><p>“What about these people here?” the woman asked softly.</p><p>“Seal off the area. Nobody is allowed to enter or exit.” In the end, Lu Sheng looked at the stunned Zhuo Siqing. He strode out of the room.</p><p>Half of the soldiers followed closely behind him. The other half stayed back to keep an eye on the others.</p><p>“Bam!”</p><p>Lu Sheng had just walked out the door when the big and tall man landed a kick on the fat uncle’s belly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
