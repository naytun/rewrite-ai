The painting veins all over his body shone white. He instantly broke free from the illusion.</p><p>There was another flurry of motions before his eyes. Before anyone knew it, he was already upon Lu Sheng. He raised his spear and stabbed it toward Lu Sheng’s chest.</p><p>Seemingly at the same moment, Jelian and a few other Painting Saints made their moves as well. They cooperated with the huge amounts of Heaven’s Net threads.</p><p>It was a combination of the ionized spear, sickle covered in potent poison that left afterimages in its wake, the most powerful anti-machine huge-caliber armor-penetrating rounds, a unique whip with corrosive properties, and other weapons.</p><p>Various weapons with their powerful attacks landed on Lu Sheng’s body.</p><p>Everyone had been pulled into the palace by the illusion just now. They practically used all their power to break free of the illusion. Now, they charged at Lu Sheng.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The many attacks formed a huge explosion. The semi-transparent white energy wave instantly erupted into a giant hemisphere. It instantly covered the distance of several kilometers.</p><p>“Pchht! Pchht! Pchht!”</p><p>Human figures reeled from the explosion, and crashed heavily into the centers of buildings. They shattered the concrete walls with their steel skeletons.</p><p>The white energy wave slowly dispersed. Lu Sheng grabbed at Augustus’s neck with his hand. His metallic-like body did not even have a single scratch.</p><p>“Meaningless struggle,” Lu Sheng said calmly. “Augustus, do you see the difference between us now?”</p><p>“Keh, keh…” Augustus hacked. His white painting veins pulsed intensely. They gave him bursts of strength, which he used to try and break free from Lu Sheng’s control.</p><p>However, the burst of strength from the white radiance was meaningless to Lu Sheng.</p><p>“I… am God’s Eye… a son of god… I’m the most powerful… Painting Saint!” He struggled to raise an arm. White radiance pulsed on his fingertips, which he aimed toward Lu Sheng’s chest.</p><p>“Looks like… you’ve made the wrong choice…” There was great pity in Lu Sheng’s eyes.</p><p>“Crack.”</p><p>He exerted force with his hand. Augustus’s neck snapped in an instant. His head was forcefully severed from his body.</p><p>“Arghh!”</p><p>Jelian charged toward Lu Sheng with a fierce look. His body was covered in gaping wounds the size of a child’s mouth. However, he knew that with Augustus dead, they would not have any good ending if they did not risk their lives.</p><p>However, he had no regrets. Painting Saints had their own sense of pride. Throughout the years when they were being controlled, regardless of the reason they rebelled, they shared one similarity.</p><p>They were all poisoned by the Silver Master.</p><p>“Glory!” Furious, forlorn shouts sounded from afar.</p><p>“Pchht! Pchht! Pchht! Pchht!”</p><p>Countless arrows of white radiance flew toward Lu Sheng like locusts.</p><p>Lu Sheng looked up toward the Glorious Knights in the distance.</p><p>He suddenly turned sideways, and kicked the wall of the building to his right.</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>Huge cracks and dents immediately appeared on the back of the building. The 80-meter-tall building snapped, and rolled as it crashed toward the Glorious Knights.</p><p>“Rumble!”</p><p>Dust and rubble scattered everywhere. The 80-meter-long building crashed into a faraway iron tower, which was more than 200 meters tall. After it broke the iron tower, both buildings crashed onto the Glorious Knight’s camp.</p><p>Only a handful of the 100-man strong Glorious Knights managed to escape in time. The others were crushed by the immense weight. They died a gruesome death in the blink of an eye.</p><p>This was absolute power.</p><p>“See that?” Lu Sheng gazed into the distant skies. For a time, he seemed to have comprehended something.</p><p>“This is my power, my path, my everything.” He suddenly understood what kind of crest was needed on his radiant disc.</p><p>Gunfire sounds had already stopped. The painters from the God’s Eye stopped their attacks as well. Although the members of the Black Light Hand suffered great losses, there were still a small group of the Silver Hand painters who were loyal to Lu Sheng. The painters gathered here and surrounded the place.</p><p>However, if Lu Sheng, who stood at the center, did not give the order, nobody would dare make any move.</p><p>The God’s Eye, the Silver Hand, the Federal High Investigation Department, the local government, and even the remnants of the Zhao and Zhuo Families.</p><p>Everyone gathered there could not help but fix their gaze on Lu Sheng, who stood above all the rest.</p><p>The God’s Eye had lost its leader. The four great Painting Saints were either dead from the great explosion or heavily wounded from the fight.</p><p>There was no one left capable of resisting Lu Sheng.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>Lu Sheng waved his arm. A pitch-black painting of a peculiar huge ring appeared before himself.</p><p>“Deep Blue.” In front of everyone else, he called out Deep Blue in his mind.</p><p>“Swish.”</p><p>The light blue modifier’s interface popped up before his eyes.</p><p>The insight he had gained just now instantly added two rules that were now near perfection.</p><p>However, there were still only three crests on his radiant disc, Yin Flames, poison, and Mystic Water.</p><p>“The next crest is…” Lu Sheng narrowed his eyes slightly.</p><p>“Add power!”</p><p>Power, power, power, power, power, power!</p><p>In an instant, the radiant disc shuddered. A huge chunk went out of his Mental Energy units. The next crest would be filled in by the nearly complete power rule which Lu Sheng had just gained insight on.</p><p>The six crests formed were in the shapes of palms which represented power. The difference was that each crest represented powers of different attributes.</p><p>The power of speed, the power of combustion, the power of toughness, pure brute force, explosive power, and regenerative power.</p><p>Six different power systems were combined with the remaining three crests. They caused huge changes in the Heart World.</p><p>The six different crests brought with them six different rules, and they became the fundamental rules of his Heart World.</p><p>The gaps in the rules were filled in. The land of his Heart World started to shake. Even the original poison crest was mercilessly purged of impurities by Lu Sheng. He switched it for benign toxins which were more beneficial in making his body stronger.</p><p>Besides Yin Flames, the Mystic Water crest was also switched out by Lu Sheng for a rule of pure water. It would be used to coordinate the mixture of other power crests.</p><p>The world was being reset.</p><p>**********</p><p>God’s Eye Augustus was dead. The most powerful Painting Saint was now the Silver Master Lu Sheng.</p><p>The Federal High Investigation Department suffered great losses. The investigation department’s elites who stood behind the Glorious Knights were practically caught in the crossfire, and most of them lost their lives—this included their current department head.</p><p>The battle at Kunming City made the world truly understand the power of painters.</p><p>The Silver Hand suffered great losses as well. The four great Painting Saints rebelled, and the upper ranks were practically vacant now. Many of the middle-ranked painters were promoted by Lu Sheng. The Painting Saints of the God’s Eye were also annihilated.</p><p>The world’s painting path plunged into an unprecedented period of recession.</p><p>The Silver Master Lu Sheng became the world’s only Painting Saint. He was also the most powerful Painting Saint.</p><p>…….</p><p>…….</p><p>August 12th.</p><p>Kunming City.</p><p>Lu Sheng placed a bouquet of white flowers softly onto the bedside cabinet.</p><p>“Are you feeling better now? Can you get up?”</p><p>“I’m not dead yet. What’re you bringing the damn flowers for!?” When Zhuo Siqing saw the bouquet on the bedside cabinet, his face went ghastly pale.</p><p>“Big… Big Brother…!” In the patient’s room, Zhuo Xinxin, who had been taking care of Zhuo Siqing, stood up, flustered. She lowered her head, and dared not look at Lu Sheng. She even stuttered as she called him brother.</p><p>“Zhuo… Xin… xin? That’s your name, right?” Lu Sheng ignored Zhuo Siqing. He looked at this younger sister of his from another mother.</p><p>“Yes, it is!” Zhuo Xinxin hastily replied. Her body was slightly shaking from nervousness.</p><p>“I hope this old geezer didn’t do any depraved things to you,” Lu Sheng said.</p><p>“Bullsh*t! Zhuo Zhenyu, I’m seriously getting angry if you keep at this!” Zhuo Siqing immediately shouted. He was about to get up.</p><p>Zhuo Xinxin’s face flushed red. She was not sure what she should say.</p><p>“Alright, alright. It was a joke.” Lu Sheng laughed. The atmosphere of the patient’s room immediately warmed up.</p><p>“That wasn’t funny at all. Have you settled your business? I see that you have free time on your hands for you to be here.”</p><p>“I’m working on it. It’s almost done.”</p><p>“If you’re not careful in doing it, you might be betrayed again, just like last time…” Zhuo Siqing reminded him.</p><p>“It’s alright. If there’s a mutiny, I’ll switch them out again. There’s no shortage of manpower in this world,” Lu Sheng said casually.</p><p>Zhuo Siqing looked at this son of his. He could not put his finger on it, but he felt that something was off. The feeling of suddenly becoming a peak figure in the world from an ordinary wealthy man was too strange.</p><p>He was not prepared in the least.</p><p>He was not even sure how he should be facing his son. Fortunately, his son’s attitude was the same as ever.</p><p>More than two weeks had passed since the great battle. The God’s Eye and the Silver Hand were being widely reported by the world media.</p><p>This resulted in the already popular painting profession experiencing a peak in the influx of new blood.</p><p>As the world’s overlord, the Silver Hand had received an overwhelming amount of applications. The Silver Master Lu Sheng who single-handedly defeated the God’s Eye and the former upper-ranks of the Silver Hand was deemed as a demon god.</p><p>Two weeks was enough time for the remaining members of the Zhuo Family to accept the reality.</p><p>The members of the Zhao Family were all captured and imprisoned. They were on the death row. The entire Kunming City was now under Lu Sheng’s control. The upper-ranks of the federation were also switched out. 60% of the world’s nations were practically controlled by the Silver Hand in secret.</p><p>The foundations had been originally laid by the God’s Eye.</p><p>“Your wounds will be healed soon. I have some other business to attend to. If there’s anything, you can reach me with this number.” Lu Sheng gave Zhuo Siqing a number. He comforted Zhuo Xinxin, turned around, and left the room.</p><p>Lu Sheng walked into the corridor, where he saw Lin Shengya standing at the exit. She seemed to be waiting for him.</p><p>Lin Shengya bit her lower lip, and softly said, “Zhuo Zhenyu, can I make a request?”</p><p>Lu Sheng looked at the time. “You have 30 seconds.”</p><p>“Alright, I’ll be frank. I want to ask you to spare uncle and his family. They’ve suffered enough. There’s no need to be so thorough in this matter,” Lin Shengya pleaded in a soft tone.</p><p>“You’ll have to speak to my father on this. According to the results of the investigation, the person who orchestrated his road accident was that uncle you’ve just mentioned,” Lu Sheng replied casually. He walked past Lin Shengya.</p><p>Currently, the nine cornerstones of his Confusion Realm were in place. Although he practically spent all of his Mental Energy, and he was only left with several hundred thousand units, everything was worth it.</p><p>As long as his Heart World was complete, he would be able to supply feedback from his Heart World to his physical body, thereby achieving the objective of true improvement.</p><p>Confusion Realm.</p><p>He had been looking forward to this for a long time now.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
