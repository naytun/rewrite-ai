(Special traits. Flying Apsara Bliss. Crane-controlling Method.)”</p><p>The several special traits were now merged into two.</p><p>“This is interesting. I’ve only derived it once, and already such a huge change has occurred,” Lu Sheng muttered to himself. After the enlightened skill was modified, with the information that surged into his mind, he slightly understood what the Flying Apsara Bliss and Crane-controlling methods were for.</p><p>‘Flying Apsara Bliss is an improvement of my agility, reflexes, and precision as my competence improves. It’s the equivalent of combining all the special traits from before into one. The Crane-controlling Method… is the Crane-controlling method… it’s a method to control cranes…’</p><p>Lu Sheng was slightly speechless. The name suggested that Deep Blue gave its own suggestion according to the key points contained within the enlightened skill.</p><p>This name was quite apt as well. Flying Apsara Bliss meant that with extreme speed and reflexes, he would be able to send someone to eternal bliss.</p><p>In short, it was a description of the speed and precision with which the opponent was taken care of.</p><p>Lu Sheng glanced at the Mental Energy spent. A total of two units were spent. As a most fundamental cultivation method, using up two Mental Energy units in one derivation meant that it was an above-average-rank method.</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>He started deriving again. He instinctively pressed the derive button on the right.</p><p>“Hiss…”</p><p>The frame slowly blurred. It clarified in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The enlightened skill which showed up again did not experience much changes. The only difference was the word ‘great’ in its name.</p><p>“Great Clear Crane Enlightened Skill”. The special traits and other attributes were not much different from before. The only addition was the special trait of being in sync with a crane spirit.</p><p>Lu Sheng wanted to derive it again, but he could no longer locate the button. The derivation button behind the frame had completely disappeared.</p><p>‘I can’t derive it. This must mean that the cultivation method is complete. Or perhaps my knowledge about the cultivation methods of this system isn’t enough.’ Lu Sheng understood this in his mind.</p><p>‘Well then, let’s try to improve my competence.’ He could sense some light, gassy substance flowing slowly throughout his body.</p><p>It resembled inner Qi, but was not inner Qi. It was lighter and fainter.</p><p>Lu Sheng drew a deep breath and adjusted his sitting posture. He checked if the Alarm Formation with the blade as its core was still intact. Then, he began cultivating again.</p><p>‘Rank up the Great Clear Crane Enlightened Skill by one rank.’ His gaze fell upon the Clear Crane Enlightened Skill as he said those words in his mind.</p><p>His thoughts had barely left him when the frame blurred immediately. This time, the frame did not swiftly clarify like before. It took much longer.</p><p>**********</p><p>The West Cliff Dynasty’s capital. Ming City.</p><p>The uninterrupted notes of a bamboo pipe were weaved together into a mild and sad melody.</p><p>Within the Imperial Tutor Mansion of Ming Cuty, Yang Huanzhen appeared serene as he enjoyed the performance of beautiful dancers in thin veils below.</p><p>Several armored generals sat to the left and right. However, none of their gazes strayed. They sat still and upright.</p><p>The bamboo pipe finished its song, and the beautiful girls retreated.</p><p>A general stood up slowly, cupped his fists, and spoke, “We dare not turn down an invitation from the imperial tutor. However, at this point of time, the borders are in turmoil, and the other clans are invading our lands. We’re making preparations to head toward the various fronts tomorrow…”</p><p>Yang Huanzhen raised a hand to stop him.</p><p>“It’s not as if I’m not letting you go. However, if you went in this manner, even with a great army, how’re you planning to defeat the warriors of the other clans?”</p><p>“Imperial Tutor, what do you say we should do?” asked another general in a deep voice.</p><p>“I have an item here. If any one of you sees a peculiar individual among the enemy ranks, toss it out. You’re sure to see a terrific effect.” Yang Huanzhen clapped his hands and smiled.</p><p>A beautiful girl appeared with a jade tray. She presented the generals with a small silk brocade bag.</p><p>“You are to open these bags only when it’s absolutely necessary to avoid being caught up in unwanted accidents,” Yang Huanzhen reminded them seriously.</p><p>The generals had long heard rumors about Imperial Tutor Yang possessing some supernatural powers. Currently, they still had their doubts, but they nonetheless listened to him.</p><p>After another series of toasts, the generals took their leave.</p><p>The lively feast was soon reduced to Yang Huanzhen sitting alone in his seat.</p><p>He lifted a cup of wine and drank.</p><p>“You seem to be in a good mood, Imperial Tutor. Even with Lie Shanjun bearing down on our borders, you’re still able to enjoy good wine here.” In the empty hall, a blurry light golden silhouette of a woman slowly materialized. She looked up at Yang Huanzhen who sat on the host’s seat.</p><p>“Your sects will handle Lie Shanjun. Our job is to steadily maintain order back here,” Yang Huanzhen said with a faint smile.</p><p>The light golden woman slowly solidified into an actual person. She was a charming woman in a golden phoenix dress with a pearl curtain over her face.</p><p>If the other officials of the court were here, they would certainly be able to recognize that this was the dynasty’s Empress Lin. Some called her the demon empress as well.</p><p>“Since you’re here, does this mean that something went wrong?” Yang Huanzhen asked softly.</p><p>“According to the original plan, everything’s progressing smoothly. As long as the Spring Autumn Sect doesn’t locate our formation’s core, everything will be fine.” Empress Lin shook her head slightly. “However, I was told yesterday that you’ve sent out three royal decrees to the Ling Prince, Moon Prince, and Zhao Prince. You’ve ordered them to send their armies out and suppress the disturbances…”</p><p>“These three princes each carry the three great joints of the dynasty’s protective formation. If they’re not dealt with, there’s no way the grand formation will be undone. If we can’t undo the grand formation, we can dash our hopes of getting our hands on that thing.” Yang Huanzhen’s expression gradually turned solemn.</p><p>“I hope what you say is true.” Empress Lin did not know about these details herself. She was only here to warn him. “Otherwise, if those wretches from the Spring Autumn Sect find out, we’ll have a fair share of trouble again.”</p><p>“Don’t worry. The situation under the heavens is within my grasp.” Yang Huanzhen raised his glass and chuckled.</p><p>The Spring Autumn Sect had always prioritized the maintenance of society’s stability, while the Indefinite Cult wanted to overthrow the current regime. Since the Indefinite Cult wanted to collect the dynasty’s secret treasures which dictated its good fortunes, it had to obtain the support of the public.</p><p>If the dynasty was stable and the people were content, nothing could ever be achieved. However, if there were to be chaos under the heavens and rebellions on all sides while the internal government was in turmoil, they would have greater chances.</p><p>The relationship between Yang Huanzhen and Empress Lin, who represented the Indefinite Cult, was only a partnership. He represented the Boundless Sea of the Golden Abode.</p><p>“Well then, when shall we make our move?” Empress Lin asked after musing to herself for a moment. “If the three princes aren’t dead, the Imperial Formation will remain flawless. It’ll be difficult for us to break the cycle.”</p><p>“Soon. I’ll arrange for the chance.” Yang Huanzhen emptied his glass in one go.</p><p>**********</p><p>Huan Jiu Province. The Moon Prince’s mansion.</p><p>The skies were dark, and dense lead clouds hung over the air.</p><p>Lu Sheng sat cross-legged in his own bed chambers. He drove all the servants out and ranked up his Great Clear Crane Enlightened Skill alone.</p><p>Besides himself, the only other occupant of the room was the little newborn white crane.</p><p>Currently, in this empty and luxurious bed chambers, wisps of white mist emanated in the air.</p><p>Lu Sheng’s brows were deeply furrowed. His nostrils, ears, mouth, and eyes were constantly exuding thick white fog.</p><p>“Great Clear Crane Enlightened Skill (Complete), 60-year competence. (Special traits. Flying Apsara Bliss. Crane-controlling Method.)”</p><p>‘There are clearly no changes in the special traits. Instead, it’s this body that’s being affected by this enlightened skill’s competence and is currently experiencing some great changes.’</p><p>Lu Sheng clearly felt a large amount of ethereal spirit spiritual power constantly surging into his muyuan meridian. At the same time, this meridian point was also wildly pushing out a formless power that could not be detected, modifying his body.</p><p>He had experienced various kinds of powers before, from substantial materialistic energy to ethereal spirit power. However, they were not as peculiar as this formless power.</p><p>Rather than referring to this as a modification, it was more apt to view it as a restoration.</p><p>This peculiar energy kept patching up the holes in his body. Some of his organs were also experiencing certain levels of changes due to this energy. They were now livelier and functioned with greater vigor.</p><p>Interestingly, he was reminded of the Nothing Root. If this was the legendary power of the Nothing Root, then Lu Sheng would have believed in it for a while.</p><p>‘This body is at its limits with just 60 years of competence. Looks like it’s still too weak. The strengthening by Yang Essence isn’t enough. I need time to adapt.’ Lu Sheng opened his eyes and looked at his own arm.</p><p>Faint shadows of white feathers appeared on the surface of his arms.</p><p>‘Looks like the Taoist skills in this world aren’t that simple…’ Lu Sheng concluded his session.</p><p>The little white crane was friendlier this time. It moved closer to Lu Sheng of its own accord and snuggled up to him.</p><p>Lu Sheng had a thought. He activated his Crane-controlling Method.</p><p>In an instant, the authority over the little white crane’s bodily movements was taken over by him. The sensation he got was as if he’d gained a new remote-controlled toy.</p><p>“According to Wu Youzi, this Crane-controlling Method is a special trait that manifested in the skill formula because the sect needed to herd red-crown cranes in the mountains,” Lu Sheng muttered to himself. He stretched out a hand and released some Pure Qi of the Great Clear Crane Enlightened Skill from his fingertips. He inserted it into the little white crane’s body from under its wings.</p><p>Then, he controlled the little white crane’s body. He controlled the Pure Qi and had it circulate according to the Twin Spirit Zheng Yuan Mantra’s pathways.</p><p>A few minutes later, Lu Sheng released the little white crane from his control. However, the circulation had already completely dozens of cycles in the animal’s body.</p><p>The little white crane stood blankly on the spot for a while. Then, its body slowly released faint fluctuations of the Twin Spirit Zheng Yuan Mantra.</p><p>As expected, it began cultivating according to the Pure Qi’s pathway.</p><p>Lu Sheng immediately understood how the Clear Crane Sect nurtured that many red-crown cranes.</p><p>‘I’ll let my body adapt to these changes for now. Even my Confusion Realm spirit has never come into contact with such a peculiar power. I should be more cautious.’</p><p>Lu Sheng straightened his robes. 60 years’ worth of dense Pure Qi flowed and slowly cycled through his body like a small river.</p><p>He felt his hearing improve, while his movements became more agile now. His eyes were also much sharper now.</p><p>If he could circulate the Pure Qi to the other parts of his body, he could create more formidable enhancement effects.</p><p>In the next few days, Lu Sheng worked his way up slowly. He listened to the information the servant Mi Gong gathered every day. As for the Great Clear Crane Enlightened Skill, it improved at a rate of 60 years of competence with every rank-up session once every few days. His strength was continuously improved.</p><p>Similarly, the little white crane grew more miraculous as Lu Sheng’s competence improved. Its size changed from day to day. A few days later, it did not resemble a newborn crane at all.</p><p>Wu Youzi would occasionally give Lu Sheng some pointers regarding the details of his cultivation based on his own experience. He was also slightly awed by the transformation of the little white crane. However, he attributed it to the red-crown crane’s natural endowments coupled with Lu Sheng feeding it with good food. He did not think much about it.</p><p>This world was full of creatures with unique lineages. It was normal for a white crane to show some abnormalities.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
