Treasures such as these could aid the cultivator in understanding the rules of the world. It was clear that they were the most popular items.</p><p>However, the prices of these crystals on the top of the list were shocking as well. Even the cheapest among them cost 100,000,000 contribution points.</p><p>Lu Sheng scrolled down. He quickly found the cultivation method category.</p><p>However, most cultivation method tomes were sold in separate volumes. The different worlds which they would be applicable to were labelled at the back.</p><p>It was clear that some of the cultivation methods could not be used in worlds with different rules.</p><p>These cultivation methods would be cheaper, but their prices still started from 1,000,000 contribution points.</p><p>This was because… all of the cultivation methods listed here could be raised to the Void Underworld tier.</p><p>‘This is understandable. These are just cultivation methods. It doesn’t mean that everything will be smooth sailing after I obtain the cultivation methods. There’s still the matter of the way of cultivating, the points to consider during the process, and the huge amounts of materials, treasures, time, and energy that will be needed. There’s also the varying degrees of difficulty and the requirements regarding the environment. These are the real issues that need addressing. There are too many sects with complete cultivation methods, yet they’ve achieved nothing. It’s highly possible that these secret tomes were obtained from those fallen sects.</p><p>‘Besides the president, the other members of the Iron Flag Council are of the same rank. Everyone’s an equal here. Naturally, there are certain restrictions imposed by the headquarters.’ Lu Sheng organized the messy information in his mind. He gradually gained an understanding in his heart.</p><p>Also, he felt much more at ease. This was practically the best super business platform!</p><p>He had not expected the problem of his cultivation method which he had fretted about all this while to be overcome this easily.</p><p>As long as he had contribution points, obtaining a cultivation method would not be a problem.</p><p>However, whenever he thought about those Void Underworld-tier cultivation methods which needed at least 1,000,000 contribution points, Lu Sheng understood that it was impossible for him to get his hands on them in the near future.</p><p>However, he had an idea now at the very least.</p><p>‘I should return to my own room for now.’ With a thought, his vision suddenly blurred. He instantly appeared in another small sphere-shaped room.</p><p>The room could only fit a single person. It was slightly more than a meter in diameter. It was difficult for him to even stand up and turn around…</p><p>‘Every member will be allocated a new private dimension. However, this dimension of mine is too small…’ Lu Sheng activated his body shrinking skill and shrunk his body a little. He finally found the room more spacious.</p><p>With the origin stone in hand, he sat cross-legged on the floor. There was no entrance or exit to this dimension. He was the only one here. Hence, he wasn’t too alert.</p><p>Lu Sheng grasped the origin stone. He was of the opinion that he was quite powerful in the medical path. Perhaps he could earn contribution points through that.</p><p>However, how much he could actually earn would depend on the market.</p><p>“Pchht.”</p><p>The light screen popped up again. Lu Sheng quickly tapped on the Skills tab. In an instant, dense rows of missions popped out. There was also the option of issuing a mission at the bottom of the screen.</p><p>Lu Sheng moved his spirit. In an instant, the items in the list before him were filtered. In a few seconds, only the missions related to the medical art were left.</p><p>Then, he arranged them in descending order according to the contribution points awarded. He waited until the sorting was completed.</p><p>Lu Sheng studied the first batch of missions.</p><p>“Stop the Natu Civilization’s apocalypse. Heal all living beings in the world. Eradicate the high-ranking civilization virus. Employment rate: 96,000,000 contribution points.”</p><p>Lu Sheng had never heard about a civilization virus before. He frowned slightly, and quickly browsed further down the list. As expected, the first 100 missions were all related to civilization viruses.</p><p>The next 200 or so missions were related to other virtual viruses. They did not even have physical bodies. They mainly infected the living beings’ spirits and minds. Those were beyond him.</p><p>Lu Sheng continued scrolling down. He soon reached the 1000th item on the list. The cases of actual illnesses began appearing. Although the reward was reduced to the 100,000s or even the 10,000s, they were much easier to complete.</p><p>After searching for some time, Lu Sheng marked three missions. They were simple tasks of treating illnesses and wounds.</p><p>After weighing his options, Lu Sheng finally decided to go with the wound treatment mission.</p><p>“Life in danger. In need of a huge amount of pure Spiritual Essence for replenishment. Service required daily with 10,000 contribution points paid per service.”</p><p>‘This is just the thing I’m looking for. I will give it a try.’</p><p>Lu Sheng moved his spirit slightly. He confirmed his acceptance of this mission.</p><p>The origin stone instantly vibrated, and a huge amount of information surged into his mind.</p><p>Besides reading the content about violation of regulations and restrictions, Lu Sheng quickly confirmed the details about this mission.</p><p>For this mission, he would have to travel to a cavern called the Baixiang Cave. The person who needed treatment was inside this cavern. He did not need to move on his own. The origin stone would transport him there.</p><p>The person who accepted the mission would only have to head over, complete the mission, and be transported back. Throughout the period of the mission, none of the parties were allowed to put the other party in danger before the mission was completed.</p><p>‘I can also use this mission as a reference to judge the standards of the payments.’</p><p>With a single thought, the treatment mission shone white on the light screen.</p><p>Among all the gray mission items listed, only this mission shone white. It was eye-catching.</p><p>Lu Sheng gripped the origin stone in his hand lightly and tossed it forward.</p><p>“Pchht!”</p><p>The origin stone suddenly turned into an oval blue transport door made of light.</p><p>‘This is convenient. Transportation can be carried out so easily. There are no restrictions on distances as well. This item is really incredible.’</p><p>He raised his alertness slightly and took a step forward.</p><p>It felt as if he passed through a layer of cooling water. The view before his eyes brightened up suddenly. The scenery before him was now that of a spacious and dark underground cave.</p><p>Transparent water droplets kept dripping down from the ceiling. The droplets dropped onto the floor of the cave, right before a colossal wound-covered body of a white dragon.</p><p>“Welcome, healer. I have waited long.” The white dragon, which was more than 40 meters in length, lowered its slender neck slowly toward Lu Sheng.</p><p>The shadow cast by its vast body alone covered Lu Sheng completely.</p><p>“Shall we begin, then?” Lu Sheng glanced at the white dragon’s chest.</p><p>There was a huge mass of wriggling, black flesh in that area.</p><p>Lu Sheng did not care about his surroundings, and walked up to the dragon. He could hear his hair being ruffled by the white dragon’s heavy breathing.</p><p>“Pccht!”</p><p>Spirit-prompting threads shot out and pierced the white dragon’s wound with precision.</p><p>The spirit-prompting threads dissolved within the dragon’s body naturally. They turned into pure Spiritual Essence and surged into the other parts of its body.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than 1,000 spirit-prompting threads dissolved within the dragon’s body. The white dragon’s body was visibly healing.</p><p>“That’s enough,” said the white dragon slowly.</p><p>Lu Sheng retracted his threads, and respectfully said, “I’ll be back after 12 sun hours.”</p><p>“You have my thanks. The payment will be made to the council first. After a completed treatment session, you’ll get it soon,” said the white dragon in a deep voice.</p><p>“Mm-hm.”</p><p>Lu Sheng nodded. The origin stone leapt out of his pocket and immediately turned into a blue light door. He took a step forward and vanished on the spot.</p><p>…</p><p>After the treatment was administered, Lu Sheng returned to his own house from the Iron Flag Council.</p><p>The entire incident lasted no more than four hours. He had earned 10,000 contribution points, and all he used up were several thousand spirit-prompting threads.</p><p>In truth, the pure Spiritual Essence as contained within his spirit-prompting threads was extremely rare. It could even be sold at a high price in the market.</p><p>However, if he sold it directly, there would be too many variables involved. If he used it for missions, the Iron Flag Council would play mediator, and he would be able to get paid in a steadier and safer manner.</p><p>In the next few days, Lu Sheng went to Baixiang Cave where the white dragon was with his origin stone. The Spiritual Essence supplied by his spirit-prompting threads was extremely pure and helpful for the white dragon. He had greatly reduced the time needed for its wounds to heal.</p><p>After five treatment sessions, the white dragon’s wounds were practically healed. Initially, the white dragon had estimated that 20 sessions were needed, but its wounds were completely healed after five sessions.</p><p>The white dragon was very grateful for this. The time saved was very precious for it. To thank Lu Sheng, it gave him a dragon power crystal imbued with its own aura.</p><p>It enabled a living being to be supported by dragon power indefinitely.</p><p>Lu Sheng exchanged it for contribution points. He got slightly more than 30,000 contribution points for it.</p><p>Time passed uneventfully for a while.</p><p>Lu Sheng visited the Zhao Family every day to administer treatment. After returning home for lunch, he headed over to the Iron Flag Council and took on healing missions through his origin stone. Sometimes, he could earn tens of thousands of contribution points. Sometimes, he earned nothing.</p><p>The missions had rates of failure as well. There was one day when Lu Sheng failed four consecutive missions. After he was transported over by the origin stone, he was faced with special illnesses that not even the spirit-prompting threads could do anything about.</p><p>Twice, Lu Sheng nearly got himself poisoned by some potent toxin. They were dangerous jobs.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, more than two weeks had passed. Zhao Luoying’s treatment had finally ended. Lu Sheng used his modifier and derived a health-maintenance method specially for Zhao Shengying.</p><p>This cultivation method was not the one he’d initially intended to give Zhao Shengying. He had modified a beautifying method after he came into contact with the child of the original core within her body.</p><p>They key issue with Zhao Shengying was the child of the original core within her. This crafty and unruly lady instantly turned mysterious in his eyes.</p><p>However, the Zhao Family aside, Lu Sheng’s initial objective had been accomplished, and that was his obtaining a compete Void Underworld-tier main cultivation method.</p><p>Although he had not exactly obtained it, with the contribution points he was earning every day, he was getting closer to his goal. According to the rate he was progressing at, all he needed was three months, and he would be able to earn enough contribution points to buy a volume of a Void Underworld cultivation method.</p><p>However, an unexpected piece of news reached him from the Fourth Ward.</p><p>Tu Jin had sent him a letter. In the letter, he learned that Chenchen was in some kind of trouble. Tu Jin had asked him to return and help her out.</p><p>Lu Sheng hesitated. He did not know how Tu Jin knew where he was. However, the letter did reach him. The Tu Style Healing Art had helped him a lot. Tu Jin was his teacher in the medical path as well. He had to go and help him out.</p><p>Now that the treatment sessions were done, his contract with the Zhao Family had also ended. He had all his time to himself.</p><p>After he received the letter, Lu Sheng packed his things, took some ice monies, and went on the Transport Formation on the Fourth Ward.</p><p>***************</p><p>Fourth Ward. Net Dragon Horn. Tu House.</p><p>“Are you sure that he’ll come?”</p><p>A big and tall man in black robes stood in the Tu Family’s courtyard. Even his face was completely covered in a mask. He stood with his hands behind his back as he gazed at the lush and emerald green forest faraway.</p><p>Behind him lay Tu Jin and De Jin, who were bound.</p><p>“No! You’d better give up! Lu Yue had only spent a short time here. Don’t you even think about taking us hostage to threaten him. This won’t work in the least!”</p><p>Tu Jin tried desperately to remain calm. However, his dense anger was still evident in his tone.</p><p>“He won’t come back!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
