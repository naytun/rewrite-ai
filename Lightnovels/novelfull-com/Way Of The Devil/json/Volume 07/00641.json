This person had to be the Zhao Family’s famous Zhao Shengying. He heard that she was lately interested in the medical path for some unknown reasons.</p><p>The three of them swiftly went forward according to the arrangements and took over from the three doctors who had been holding the fort for quite some time.</p><p>Lu Sheng did not conceal his abilities. He devoured the pitch-black smoke by the mouthfuls. In all appearances, whether it was in terms of strength or total volume, he surpassed the other doctors around him.</p><p>They had just started for a dozen breaths when Lu Sheng’s performance attracted the attention of Steward Wu and Zhao Shengying.</p><p>Zhao Shengying was feeling irritated lately. Her childhood friend, Big Brother Wang, had been attacked on the streets recently. He was badly wounded.</p><p>What made her mad was that her rival, Lin Junwei, had seized this opportunity to approach Big Brother Wang while he was vulnerable. With her half-baked medical skills, she managed to administer first-aid to Big Brother Wang when the incident happened, and helped prevent his wounds from worsening.</p><p>Zhao Shengying had witnessed the entire thing. She remembered it well.</p><p>It was one thing for someone else to approach Big Brother Wang. It had been the same case for Zhang Sikong and Qiu Zhonglin! Every time she had her eyes on some handsome young master of a noble family, that b*tch Lin Junwei would always look for opportunities to approach them first.</p><p>‘F*ck her half-baked medical skills! F*ck her divine medical hands! F*ck her medical genius! I won’t have any of that!’ After her seventh boyfriend was taken away from her, Zhao Shengying started to study medicine on her own in a fit of rage. She swore to herself that she would surpass that wretched b*tch who acted as if she was a pure white lotus.</p><p>She was only the Third Divine Hand in the main city. She believed that, with her talents, she could easily surpass that wench in three years if she wanted to.</p><p>Then, she heard that many medical elites were gathered here by her second cousin’s side. Hence, she had the idea to come and watch. She wanted an absolutely powerful medical elite to be her teacher.</p><p>Although she was not willing to admit this to the b*tch, Zhao Shengying knew that as the Medical Saint’s, Pill King’s, daughter, in addition to her own shocking talents in the medical path, Lin Junwei had already attained a level that was difficult to achieve by her peers at a very young age.</p><p>Hence, she was determined, but when it came to it and she had cooled down from the heat of the moment, she was starting to feel insecure again.</p><p>However, she had already spread news of her decision. She dared not imagine how that b*tch would make fun of her if she gave up without even starting.</p><p>The more Zhao Shengying thought about it, the angrier she felt. Also, she was of the opinion that she was much more beautiful than the others. She was at a loss as to why these young, handsome, talented men were not willing to stay with her.</p><p>‘I mean, the only things bad about me are my slightly oversized breasts, slightly short temper, or the few occasions that I almost killed my boyfriends by beating? It’s not as if they’re incurable diseases. As long as they’re still alive, shouldn’t these boyfriends be okay with suffering all this?’</p><p>She remembered a time when she accidentally pushed her boyfriend and used him as a human shield when she was attacked by an assassin.</p><p>That brat had broken up with her on the spot! He even went all lovey-dovey with that wench Lin Junwei.</p><p>The more she thought about it, the angrier she became!</p><p>“Lady cousin! Lady cousin?”</p><p>Suddenly, Steward Wu’s voice reached her.</p><p>Zhao Shengying snapped back to the present, irritated. “What!?”</p><p>Steward Wu kept a straight face, and pointed at Lu Sheng who was sitting upright on an empty spot on the right. “You wanted to look for a medical elite before this. This doctor might meet your requirements.”</p><p>Zhao Shengying looked in that direction, and was immediately shocked.</p><p>Currently, at least half of the black smoke in the house was being sucked in by that gentle-looking young man’s hand.</p><p>‘This medical cultivation base is extraordinary! Even that b*tch can’t do this. Not bad! Not bad at all! Also, he’s cute.’ Zhao Shengying stroked her chin.</p><p>“I’ll meet him after this. I’ll have him visit you in your courtyard after this,” Steward Wu spoke respectfully.</p><p>“Not bad! I’ll give him a try first.” Zhao Shengying was looking forward to this already. Although she knew that a person’s medical skills could not be judged by the purification of heavy planet pollutants alone, at the very least, this person was much better than that b*tch in this aspect.</p><p>If she could find a teacher even the b*tch could not beat, no matter how gifted she was, it would be impossible for her to defeat him.</p><p>She gave it some thought, and then projected her voice to Steward Wu. She gave him some orders, and then she turned and left.</p><p>Lu Sheng saw her leave with the edge of his vision. His heart fluttered slightly. He knew that his intentional performance had achieved its objective.</p><p>With his cultivation base, it was only natural for him to be able to make out Zhao Shengying’s lip movements at such a short distance. That was how he figured out what she had said.</p><p>Even with a soundproof barrier, it was impossible to escape the surveillance of an elite at such a short distance.</p><p>The treatment session ended soon enough. The black smoke released by the heavy planet pollutants slowly subsided.</p><p>Lu Sheng and the others got to their feet. He did not even have the time to socialize with the others when someone came up to him and led him out of the iron house.</p><p>Lu Sheng knew what this was for. Along the way, Steward Wu explained the conditions of the Zhao Family’s invitation in detail.</p><p>It was truly irresistible.</p><p>If he became Zhao Shengying’s teacher, in addition to the salary he would obtain from purging the lady of the heavy planet pollutants, the Zhao Family would be paying him 200,000 ice money every month.</p><p>It should be mentioned that 3,000 ice money was enough for him to carry out one Arrival. If he could get his hands on this 200,000 ice money and he worked at this for a few months, he would not have to worry about the costs of Arrivals anymore. He reckoned that he would have covered the costs for the materials he needed for the Infinity Technique already.</p><p>Lu Sheng knew that aside from Zhao Shengying, the Zhao Family must have seen that he could do the work of six to seven doctors. The amount he purified alone was several times greater than an ordinary doctor’s capacity already. That was why they offered him such a high wage.</p><p>However, this played right into his plans.</p><p>After stating his agreement to Steward Wu, Lu Sheng was quickly brought to the adjacent manor.</p><p>A black rectangular stone table was placed in the courtyard. Various delicacies were served on the table. The steam which emerged from some of the dishes contained runic patterns as well.</p><p>Unimaginably pure Essential Essence filled the air.</p><p>Zhao Shengying sat at the other side of the table. When she saw Lu Sheng being led in, she immediately stood up with a smile.</p><p>“Have a seat, Teacher. Since you’ve set foot into this courtyard, it means that you’ve agreed to being my teacher. Let’s talk about nothing else for now. Come, this is a feast to commemorate me apprenticing myself to you! Please enjoy yourself!”</p><p>Although Zhao Shengying was an overbearing and unreasonable person, she was still well-versed in the ways of dealing with other people.</p><p>If she wanted someone to teach her their own unique skill, she would have to pay the price.</p><p>Other things aside, she had always been generous with her gifts and financial enumeration for others.</p><p>Lu Sheng wore a faint smile and bowed slightly toward Zhao Shengying. He sat down while a servant girl waited on him.</p><p>Then, Zhao Shengying started telling him about her sufferings and sadness.</p><p>As she spoke, she described the girl Lin Junwei as a white lotus in several ways. In short, she was a pretentious whore whose outer appearance differed from her thoughts.</p><p>“Can you really blame me for having huge breasts!? Those wretched men had tried to get close to me because of my status. However, all of them went to f*cking lick Lin Junwei’s stinky feet in the end!” Zhao Shengying slammed her fist on the table in a fit of rage.</p><p>“It’s not my fault that I have big breasts! What can I do if I’m born this way!? They’re just excess flesh! Look at those wretched men in the city, what good are breasts if they’re small!? Still, should they cast women with huge breasts aside!? They can all go to hell!”</p><p>Lu Sheng’s expression was slightly strange.</p><p>From Zhao Shengying’s words, he roughly understood that in Libra City’s main city, the upper society preferred women with smaller breasts. Zhao Shengying was the outlier here.</p><p>Her breasts were too huge, even by ordinary standards. Although Lu Sheng still found them acceptable, albeit slightly oversized, she stuck out like a sore thumb here.</p><p>It was precisely because of this that Zhao Shengying’s hand had been turned down in marriage several times. On the other hand, Lin Junwei, whom she had grown up with, was the exact opposite. She had turned down many admirers who asked for her hand in marriage.</p><p>A person would only do herself harm by comparing with others.</p><p>In the beginning, Zhao Shengying and Lin Junwei were close childhood friends. They were very friendly with each other. However, ever since there was a difference in the development of their breasts, their respective status became as different as the heavens were from the earth.</p><p>“Tell me! Is it my fault that my breasts are this huge? Everyone’s looking down on me! I’ve proposed eight times! Eight times! None of those mother*ckers ever agreed!” Zhao Shengying started hitting the table. It was clear that she had slightly too much to drink.</p><p>“I can’t tell you how many times I’ve thought of cutting these two lumps off with a cleaver. Even if they were not fully removed, I’d want them reduced in size. But…” Zhao Shengying’s face wore a painful expression. Her young beautiful face was scrunched up. Her breasts rested on the table before herself. It seemed likely that she would black out at any moment.</p><p>Lu Sheng was speechless inwardly. However, he displayed a faint show of empathy on his face.</p><p>“Actually… I can understand your situation, lady cousin.” He displayed a similarly helpless expression.</p><p>“I was like you before. I was feared for my overly voracious appetite. The people around me were afraid of me. They wanted to stay away from me. I didn’t even have many friends, let alone marriage proposals.</p><p>“Then, in order to be recognized by everyone, I started studying the medical art. When I became accomplished in my field and treated everyone around me, they accepted me.</p><p>“After that experience, if anyone looks down on me or refuses to recognize me, I’ll treat their illnesses. After my treatment, everyone became friends with me. Nobody looked down on me ever again,” Lu Sheng spoke slowly.</p><p>“So, after all that you’ve said, lady cousin, it’s they who need treatment. As long as you’re accomplished in the medical path and treat all the people who look down on you, your dreams will be fulfilled.”</p><p>“Really? You’re not trying to fool me, are you?” Although Zhao Shengying was slightly drunk, she managed to maintain a certain degree of consciousness.</p><p>“I wouldn’t dare cheat you, lady cousin. Speaking of which, the medical path can be regarded as the most perfect of the major paths. As long as you possess great medical skills, everyone will get close to you. If you’re skilled enough, everyone will rely on you. With your treatment, the bad will become good, and the good will become better. Everyone will like you. Those who don’t will like you more after your treatment. You won’t have to worry about falling sick or being poisoned. You can also display great might in times of war. Lady cousin, your choice to study the medical path is definitely the most correct choice you’ve made in your life!”</p><p>Lu Sheng was misleading Zhao Shengying with a serious expression. Even though he himself did not quite believe his own words, if he gave it more thought, his psychological guidance art could also be regarded as a kind of medical skill.</p><p>In that case, he had a point.</p><p>The more Zhao Shengying listened to him, the brighter her eyes shone.</p><p>“Is it really that good?”</p><p>“Of course. Also, didn’t you say that your breasts were too huge? If you have the skills, you can do it yourself…”</p><p>“I won’t. A complete body is the most basic foundation for cultivation. My father will not allow that,” Zhao Shengying said helplessly.</p><p>“Very well, then. However, cultivating medical art can really make you more perfect. I think you’re beautiful enough right now. The only shortcoming is that your muscle mass is too low.</p><p>“If you gain more muscle mass, you’ll definitely be able to get those handsome young men from the noble families to turn their heads,” Lu Sheng advised her earnestly.</p><p>“Oh? Is that so?” Zhao Shengying asked with puzzlement.</p><p>“Think about it. Since you can’t beat that Lin Junwei by conventional means, and you can’t just go modifying your body with your condition, there’s no other choice than opening up another path. The sense of beauty of the people is usually fixed. You can give them a true and complete shock of beauty from another angle,” Lu Sheng continued with his persuasion.</p><p>“A shock of beauty?” Zhao Shengying stroked her chin with hesitation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
