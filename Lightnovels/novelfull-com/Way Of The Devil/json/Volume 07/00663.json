This cultivation method was designed for fertilizing soil, and had no offensive arts. It served no other purpose than helping him rank up.</p><p>Hence, he was currently in dire need to learn some killing techniques of the Confusion Realm tier. When he heard that this demon dragon’s treasure was powerful, Lu Sheng immediately had a thought.</p><p>‘Well, I am bored, might as well see how powerful this Mystic Heart Nine Dragons Flag is.’ With that thought, he immediately asked the old man for directions. Then, he leapt into the air and flew in the reported direction.</p><p>He flew along the golden paddy fields for dozens of kilometers. Lu Sheng soon encountered a deep rift with a width of several dozen meters, which abruptly appeared before him on the ground.</p><p>The rift was pitch-black and of unfathomable depth. Cold air constantly rose from the edges of the rift.</p><p>Lu Sheng had just stopped when there was a surge of black demon Qi from the rift. A black demon dragon more than 30 meters long leapt into the air. After turning in a circle before Lu Sheng, it slowly morphed into a big black-faced man with dragon horns.</p><p>“So, it’s a personal visit from the Red Moon Cult’s emissary. My name’s Hei Zhong. How may I help you, emissary? If it’s beyond my power, there’s a branch of our Nothing God Cult nearby. The bishop there can come to your assistance at any time.”</p><p>On the surface, this demon dragon behaved tactfully enough. However, he implied that there were members of the Nothing God Cult nearby, so it was better for Lu Sheng to come clean.</p><p>“What’s the Nothing God Cult’s bishop coming here for?” Lu Sheng asked with a cold smile.</p><p>The demon dragon was naïve. He thought that he had Lu Sheng fooled. With a satisfied smile, he replied, “The lord bishop isn’t the only one here. Even several great managers of the Natash Merchant Alliance are here. You’re just a mere novice, even if the imam is here, hehe…” He did not finish his sentence, but Lu Sheng could guess at his implied message.</p><p>Lu Sheng had come here with a casual attitude. However, he was starting to get serious now.</p><p>The Nothing God Cult’s bishop was one thing, but the Natash Merchant Alliance was the largest merchant alliance in Libra City. Their great managers numbered less than 100, but had to manage several hundred planets.</p><p>Clearly there was something fishy going on if such great individuals were here in this small place.</p><p>“My lord, if there’s nothing else, I should be going back to my cultivation.” This demon dragon’s smile was becoming more triumphant.</p><p>Lu Sheng frowned. He was here to accumulate Mental Energy. However, he was now encountering the Nothing God Cult and the Natash Merchant Alliance in his first mission ever. He thought it would be best to act cautiously.</p><p>However, he was not willing to follow his imam and drink the water which the others used to wash their feet. They came all the way to rake in money and land. Why should they go and exploit those poor lower-ranked forces?</p><p>Those with more profits to be gained from were these individuals of the middle and upper ranks.</p><p>Lu Sheng pondered about this, and finally had some ideas.</p><p>“Hahahaha! I didn’t expect there to be an Army Raising Treasure at this backward place! Nice, very nice! Hahaha!” Suddenly, the imam Men Fa’s howling laughter came from the Scarlet River Seed.</p><p>‘F*ck it! The timid may starve to death, while the bold may burst his belly! You can’t be rich without taking risks!’ When Lu Sheng heard this, he steeled his heart. The stream of information within the Scarlet River Seed was a mess. It would be difficult to trace the source.</p><p>If the Red Moon Cult was as formidable as Mi Guangyin had said, it should have no problem dealing with this level of trouble.</p><p>‘I’ll worry about the consequences later!’</p><p>He had only several hundred thousand units of Mental Energy left. He had many uses for Mental Energy yet—for example, to derive his skill formulas.</p><p>The demon dragon was about to return to the rift when he suddenly felt a chill down his spine. He hastily turned around.</p><p>He saw a black hand grab his forehead with lightning speed.</p><p>He did not even have time to register the event when he felt a pain in his head.</p><p>“Pooh!”</p><p>The demon dragon exploded into bits. He died without a complete corpse. A ball of black radiance flew out of the remains and wanted to flee. With a flash from the radiant disc behind Lu Sheng, it was sent directly into his Heart World.</p><p>Lu Sheng finished all this with familiar movements. Then, he shot into the abyss at high speed toward the demon dragon’s abode. He swept the coffers clean by tossing everything into his Sea-overturning Orb.</p><p>What surprised him was that although this demon dragon was only of the Weapon Master tier, his stash was exceptionally rich. This was especially true for the so-called Mystic Heart Nine Dragons Flag.</p><p>It was not too powerful, but the Mental Energy which lingered on it gave Lu Sheng a huge increased of more than 100,000 units.</p><p>In addition to the other old items in the treasuries, in slightly more than an hour, Lu Sheng had absorbed close to 500,000 Mental Energy units.</p><p>“The planets near Libra City are rich!” After having the first sweet taste of success, Lu Sheng eagerly flew toward a place with the aura most similar with the demon dragon’s.</p><p>He felt that he was born to rob the rich to feed the poor.</p><p>If he left these goods to the others, he would be just be giving the greedy pigs, the rich, fat leaders of the merchants. The potential of these resources could only be fulfilled if they were used by powerful experts such as himself. These treasures would not have existed in vain.</p><p>Lu Sheng sped up. After looting a dozen small bases, he swiftly reached a small fort which resembled a castle.</p><p>Lu Sheng hovered in the air and looked down at the view. His gaze was scorching.</p><p>“The Red Moon Cult is here on business! I command everyone to come out!”</p><p>His thunderous voice reverberated through the entire fort.</p><p>Lu Sheng had been restraining himself for too long. He had been holding back ever since he’d come out from Great Yin. Now that he finally broken through to the Confusion Realm and taken on the identity of a Red Moon Disciple, he had to seize the opportunity to rake in money and earn Mental Energy, for he did not know when the next opportunity would come by.</p><p>It should be known that he had devoured all the Ancient Devils in the seal in one go. After that, he’d laid down his firm foundations for his Eight-Headed Devil Art.</p><p>The Natash Merchant Alliance was not known for their good reputation, either. Unlike the act they put on, the Natash Merchant Alliance was the largest secret slave trader in Libra City. Their riches could be akin to mountains of gold and seas of silver. There were no words that could do it justice.</p><p>“Who goes there!?” A rainbow bridge emerged from within the fort. Three formidable-looking chieftains in different outfits stood on the bridge.</p><p>Two of them dressed similarly to the demon dragon. They had black Divine Veins on their bodies.</p><p>The remaining person had an elegant bearing. She wore long form-fitting clothes and held a jade-white sword in her hands. Her beautiful eyes were locked on Lu Sheng in midair with a slight frown.</p><p>“It’s another one of those Red Moon Disciples who’s here to ask for a windfall…” whispered one of the chieftains into the lady’s ear.</p><p>“Just give him something and drive him away,” replied the lady coldly. “I heard that the Red Moon Disciples are here on their so-called assisted hunt. He must have separated from the group and come here. Otherwise, there’s no way that our secret meeting could be found out.”</p><p>“Understood.” The two chieftains were clearly of the Nothing God Cult’s upper echelon. However, they still listened to the lady.</p><p>When Lu Sheng finished shouting in midair and saw that there were no movements below, he felt that something was wrong.</p><p>He had looted many things along the way, and had gained some experience. The actions of these people clearly conveyed the message that they were confident in the forces backing them.</p><p>Although the upper limits of this planet were not high, it was still normal to encounter troublesome opponents near Libra City.</p><p>However, since nobody could recognize him here, and he was here under the name of the Red Moon Cult, if he did not rake in as much money as he could, he would have been better off Arriving in some small world.</p><p>When he thought about this, he decided that this was not a big deal. With his strength, surely he would be able to run away even if he could not defeat them?</p><p>As for Void Underworld beings, every movement of theirs would be under the scrutiny of countless eyes. Moreover, this was near Libra City. The leader of the Red Moon was just around the corner. With the master backing him, even a Void Underworld being would have to proceed with caution out of concern for the master.</p><p>Hence, the great organizations would tolerate the Red Moon Disciples, and dared not provoke these vile individuals.</p><p>“Swoosh!”</p><p>Suddenly, one of the men swung his arm from below and tossed a black embroidered box.</p><p>“Dear emissary, for men such as ourselves who have dealings with the outside world, we should make friends wherever we can. Please accept this small token of our kindness.”</p><p>Lu Sheng caught the embroidered case. The content of the box was simple. With a simple of scan of his spirit, he knew that this was a black jade with high quality.</p><p>Black jades were used in formations. They had great value. This black jade could be sold for several thousand ice monies. It was considered a nice gift even in Libra City.</p><p>However, here, it was used to deal with a mere Red Moon Disciple…</p><p>Lu Sheng’s aim of coming here was to gather riches and accumulate Mental Energy. Did they take him for a beggar by trying to send him away with this black jade?</p><p>However, his original intention was to come here and gain some loot. He would not want to incur losses by running into troublesome opponents.</p><p>After weighing the options in his heart, Lu Sheng received the embroidered box.</p><p>“Since you’re tactful, I’ll take it.” Lu Sheng did not waste his words on nonsense. He turned around and left. He did not dally.</p><p>The Red Moon Disciples were notorious, but his opponents were not pushovers, either.</p><p>Lu Sheng quickly left the place and went out of their sight in the blink of an eye.</p><p>“That’s how the Red Moon Disciples are. If you show weakness, they’ll want a mile after you gave them an inch, and demand more from you. If you steeled yourself, the trash won’t dare to actually lug it out with you,” said the Nothing God Cult’s bishop beside the lady with a smile.</p><p>“Let’s go. That person was strong. He’s at least at the Army Raising tier. It’s not asking too much to give him some face,” said the lady drily. “Tell everyone that we’re leaving as soon as the cultivation is complete. We’ve outstayed our welcome here.”</p><p>“Understood!”</p><p>The two Nothing God Cult’s upper echelon bowed toward a lady from the Natash Merchant Alliance.</p><p>They knew how merciless this lady could be. Ever since they came to Wangshan Planet and played along with the United Nations’ rules for three decades, they had secretly kidnapped millions of people and bled them dry to cultivate something called the human tower.</p><p>Now that the cultivation was almost complete, the lady would not allow any outside interference to influence the project.</p><p>They swiftly returned to the fort. The entire fort contorted for a while and blurred. Then, it resumed its deathly stillness in the blink of an eye as if nobody was there.</p><p>After flying a dozen kilometers, Lu Sheng went through the surrounding area and looted many bases of the Nothing God Cult. However, he did not gain much from his endeavor.</p><p>Feeling dissatisfied, he remembered the lady he’d met just now. Those people could easily give him a high-quality black jade just to drive him away. It was evident that they were extremely rich.</p><p>However, when he’d been outside the fort, he could faintly pick out the boiling scent of countless wronged ghosts and blood.</p><p>‘Those people are certainly conspiring something big in there.’ Lu Sheng had a grim expression. ‘I’ve gained too little. It’s not even as much as I gained from the demon dragon. Looks like I’ll have to rid the people of this scourge now…’</p><p>Usually, individuals such as them who hid their powers well were rich and powerful, and were Confusion Realm elites.</p><p>However, Lu Sheng was not a person whose brain was made up of muscle.</p><p>He made some preparations five kilometers away from the fort.</p><p>Then, he stabbed himself in the chest. He hacked away until his blood flowed freely and his flesh was torn.</p><p>Then, he lifted his hand to activate the Scarlet River Seed.</p><p>“Imam! There’s a great opportunity here! I’ve discovered a secret stash with countless treasures here. There are even mystery crystals here! Those wretched Nothing God Cult members disregarded the name of the Red Moon Disciples, stole my Treasures, my crystals, and even wanted to kill me in the end!”</p><p>“Mystery crystals!?” In the Scarlet River Seed, the imam’s voice immediately grew thicker. “You’re not fooling me, are you!? There really are mystery crystals!?”</p><p>“It’s true!” Lu Sheng replied while breathing rapidly. “They almost killed me to silence me. I’m now heavily wounded. Please do something about this, imam!”</p><p>“This opportunity should be mine!” the imam immediately shouted. “Wait where you are. I’ll head over immediately!”</p><p>The Scarlet River Seed’s communication was ended.</p><p>Lu Sheng lowered his hand. It was now time to wait for the imam to come over and help him.</p><p>He was confident in this imam. Although his strength was only of the Weapon Grandmaster realm, Men Fa had a profound background. Rather than viewing this as an assisted hunting mission, it should be viewed as a daily mission for him to earn money.</p><p>As for the benefits, money was actually secondary. Lu Sheng’s main target were the old goods. Also, it was better for him to have a little than to have none at all.</p><p>Since he had decided to climb up the ranks within the Red Moon Cult, he would be a fool not to seize every opportunity that came his way.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
