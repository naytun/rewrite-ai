From the looks of it, it is indeed just a part of “Her,” which means that the title and authority left to the Outer Deity on the moon is: Mother Goddess of Depravity, Origin of Evil, The Indestructible… By the same logic, the Mother Tree of Desire’s full name should be: Mother Tree of Desire, Heartless God, Perpetual Blatherer… The situation regarding the Son of Chaos isn’t very clear. It’s as though “He” vanished, and no one can fully understand “Him”… Klein nodded indiscernibly.</p><p>He then asked, “From the looks of it, the Omnipotent and Omniscient is the strongest. The Lord of the Mysteries and the Space-Time-in-One are ranked second. The rest are ranked third.”</p><p>This was determined by the number of Beyonder pathways each needed, excluding the Outer Deities.</p><p>Adam looked at the Blasphemy Slate and calmly said, “That’s not how it is.</p><p>“The number of authorities has a certain connection to level and status, but not entirely. The corresponding characteristics, power, and symbols are equally important.</p><p>“After the original Creator split apart, the Three Pillars stood above all the Great Old Ones. One was God Almighty, Omnipotent and Omniscient; the other was Lord of the Mysteries, the King of Space-Time; and the last was Mother Goddess of Depravity, Origin of Evil.”</p><p>Upon hearing Adam’s last sentence, Klein couldn’t help but look down at his left sleeve. Arrodes was hiding inside.</p><p>No wonder Arrodes said that he saw a pillar and support from me… Klein had suddenly arrived at a state of enlightenment as he was a little more convinced by what Visionary Adam had said.</p><p>At this moment, Adam added at an adequate pace, “Currently, the first two pillars only exist in the form of sefirot. And after the Mother Goddess of Depravity had the Brood Hive and two Beyonder pathways separated from “Her,” “She” became not much different from the other Outer Deities. Only “Her” symbol as a pillar remains.”</p><p>If it wasn’t for the blood-stained stake in his chest, Klein definitely would’ve felt that the ambiance was great for a conversation. In moments when his mind trailed, he even imagined that he and Adam were friends and were happily discussing some mysticism knowledge, waiting for “His” child, Amon, to return home for dinner.</p><p>Of course, I’m “dinner”… I have to say that a Spectator’s ability to influence others’ knowledge, experience, and state is really too powerful… As Klein told himself to be on guard, he asked in puzzlement, “I thought that the Outer Deities like the Mother Goddess of Depravity, who has two or even three sefirot, are considered pillars.”</p><p>Adam looked down at the silver cross pendant hanging across “His” chest and said, “She” only has one sefirah.</p><p>“Under normal circumstances, the sefirot can’t be separated. Only when the original Creator split and created an embodiment of convergence and separation did the sefirot tear apart, allowing some of them to be sucked into our planet.”</p><p>“In other words, the present sefirah the Mother Goddess of Depravity has is incomplete. The future Great Old One, Mother of All, won’t be a complete Great Old One?” Klein pressed.</p><p>Adam’s lips twitched as though “He” was smiling.</p><p>“It was so at the beginning, but the sefirot has the ability to mend itself. The present Mother Goddess of Depravity’s sefirah isn’t incomplete, and the Brood Hive can also create a Great Old One itself. The only problem is that the Mother Goddess of Depravity can only use a portion of pillar ‘She’ symbolizes, unless she has fused with the Brood Hive again.</p><p>“This has also caused the birth of life and the feminist powers in the entire universe to undergo a certain anomaly. However, thousands of years of time at astronomical scales is a very short period of time, and the corresponding influence hasn’t spread.</p><p>“And if any Outer Deity obtains a sefirah that is neighboring ‘Theirs,’ making it equivalent to having two sefirot—I can’t predict what will happen. Before that, only the original Creator had contained more than singular sefirah. However, as long as ‘He’ awakens, ‘He’ will definitely split apart.”</p><p>Klein nodded and asked thoughtfully, “In the beginning, the Creator accommodated at least nine sefirot. This doesn’t mean that having two sefirot or even three will not result in problems. There should be a critical point.”</p><p>“No one can verify this at the moment.” Adam held the silver cross pendant in front of “His” chest and said, “I’m guessing that some existences have attempted it before. After all, convergence is a very strong instinct, but the outcome is unknown.”</p><p>“Which existences?” Klein rubbed the bloody cross wooden stake that was stuck in his chest.</p><p>Adam cast “His” gaze at the gigantic cross that was more than a hundred meters tall in front of “Him” and calmly said,</p><p>“The God Almighty from the early First Epoch. ‘He’ can also be called the Primordial One. In addition, there’s also the Lord of the Mysteries—the one you often recite…”</p><p>As “He” spoke, Adam turned to look at Klein and said in an imitating manner, “The Celestial Worthy of Heaven and Earth for Blessings.”</p><p>…These two seem to have vanished… The outcome of “Their” attempts doesn’t seem too good? Klein hadn’t thought of what he wanted to say when Adam turned “His” head and looked at the second Blasphemy Slate.</p><p>“What I can be sure of is that some sefirot cannot be accommodated at the same time.</p><p>“In this universe, there is a hidden fourth pillar. It represents everything, including the end of the Great Old Ones and the universe itself. It corresponds to the two sefirot—River of Eternal Darkness and City of Calamity.</p><p>“Simply put, if Evernight can become an Eternal Darkness, Singularity of All, Space-Time-in-One, ‘She’ can further occupy the two pathways of Demoness and Red Priest, encompassing the City of Calamity, and becoming the true fourth pillar. However, when that happens, ‘She’ will either enter a deep sleep, be passively split apart, or it will cause the entire Universe, including “Her” and us, to be annihilated, starting everything all over again.”</p><p>Never expected that… Once Above the Sequences level is reached, the symbolism is more important than authority… Adam, no, the ancient sun god’s mysticism knowledge is simply too terrifying. As expected of a quasi Great Old One… Klein sighed when he heard that.</p><p>He thought and said, “In other words, a demigod from the Sleepless pathway can transfer to the Demoness pathway?”</p><p>“That’s right.” Adam looked straight ahead. “But in that case, there’s no way to become a Great Old One, unless one thinks of a way to separate the Beyonder characteristics from before.”</p><p>As Klein looked up, he read the demigod potion formulas of the Spectator, Sleepless, and Arbiter pathways and changed the topic:</p><p>“Where did the potion formula related to the Great Old Ones come from?</p><p>“The first Blasphemy Slate didn’t seem to contain them… Were they hidden in the different Sequence 0 potions?”</p><p>Adam’s expression changed slightly, and “His” face seemed to be more radiant.</p><p>“After I gained initial control of the omnipotence and omniscience authority, I began to deduce the method and pathway to become a Great Old One. Finally, I found a suitable formula and figured out the different symbolism.</p><p>“Unfortunately, at that time, the Primordial One had also awoken inside me…”</p><p>Therefore, when the ancient sun god perished, you used a portion of your body and will to create a second Blasphemy Slate? Klein sighed and said, “From now on, there will be light for the apocalypse.”</p><p>It also ended the chaotic battle between the deities due to anger, emotions, and other reasons. It initiated the era of working towards becoming Great Old Ones.</p><p>Adam maintained “His” previous expression and didn’t say anything.</p><p>Klein fell silent. After a few seconds, he suddenly asked, “What kind of humanity did you fabricate in that marionette of mine?”</p><p>Adam turned “His” head and said with clear eyes, “He was too tired. He wanted rest and freedom, even if it was only for a few seconds.”</p><p>Klein gaped, not knowing how to respond.</p><p>“Why didn’t you address him as Gehrman Sparrow, but refer to him as ‘that marionette’?” Adam asked warmly, as though “He” was trying to straighten out the thoughts of a member of “His” congregation.</p><p>Klein turned his head to look at “Him,” and suddenly said with a smile, “I’m Gehrman Sparrow. Gehrman Sparrow is a part of me. If I separate them, even if I can escape your divine kingdom, it will be difficult for me to avert the fate of losing control.”</p><p>Having said that, Klein paused and looked ahead. He asked in a deep voice, “You only have godhood left?”</p><p>…</p><p>Rorsted Archipelago, City of Generosity, Bayam.</p><p>After returning here, Verdu Abraham learned that the God of War was a rather active existence in the Fourth Epoch. It was possible for “Him” to respond to believers.</p><p>Then, he hired a poor person who willingly risked his life to pray to the God of War to confirm that there was no danger.</p><p>And the price of all of that was 300 gold pounds.</p><p>Now, he received a report that not only was that poor person not dead, he even had some of his wishes fulfilled!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
