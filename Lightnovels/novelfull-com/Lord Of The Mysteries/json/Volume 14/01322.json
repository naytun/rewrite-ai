I seem to have heard of him… He’s one of the Four Kings?”</p><p>“Who is that? Why haven’t I heard of him before…”</p><p>“Oh, I forgot to ask about the Psychology Alchemists. I was planning on using a more tactful method to seek some suggestions…”</p><p>The first reaction came from Alger, Cattleya, and Fors, who had lived at sea for a period of time. The second reaction came from Leonard, Emlyn, Xio, and Derrick. The third reaction belonged to Audrey alone.</p><p>Getting no answers, The World Gehrman Sparrow didn’t ask further. His main goal was to use this as a reminder for Miss Justice to bring up the matter for discussion in a way that could bypass the promise she made.</p><p>Of course, if Miss Justice were to seek help from Mr. Fool, Klein would also use “Grafting” to temporarily connect the bindings formed from her subconscious to a paper figurine, providing her with a period of time that she could freely recount things.</p><p>This was also a high-level application of Paper Figurine Substitutes. With Klein’s current level, he could easily do it within Sefirah Castle. If he were in the real world, he would have to rely on the Worms of Spirit above the gray fog to control the “curtain” and provide responses.</p><p>At that moment, Audrey thought for a moment and said, “Do you still remember that I once pursued the whereabouts of a mind dragon and went to a place where they had customs of worshiping dragons?”</p><p>Alger, Cattleya, and company nodded. Only Leonard and Xio expressed their lack of knowledge of this matter.</p><p>As this wasn’t an important matter, Fors didn’t mention it when she first briefed Xio of the “general knowledge.” After that, she was frightened by Angel of Imagination Adam, and rarely talked about the secrets shared by the Tarot Club in the real world.</p><p>Audrey deliberated for a moment before continuing, “It’s been almost two years. A secret organization that doesn’t trust me too much suddenly mentioned this matter and has entrusted me with further investigations. They said it’s a form of observation. What motives do they have?”</p><p>She didn’t think it was a coincidence.</p><p>Emlyn recovered and laughed.</p><p>“This should be a test.”</p><p>To him, he was still very far from reaching Sequence 1 Beauty Goddess, and he had no intention of transferring to the Planter pathway. Therefore, he didn’t need to worry about the corresponding problems for a long period of time. There was no need to worry too much about it.</p><p>Emlyn’s ability to say the word “test” shows how much he has improved… Of course, this is also because the Sanguine has done too many similar things to him, having to trouble Mr. Hanged Man into telling him that “this is a test”… The Fool Klein was very satisfied with Emlyn’s answer.</p><p>Of course, he didn’t believe that the answer was correct. He only felt that Emlyn’s ability to think up to this level was already pretty remarkable.</p><p>Audrey said disapprovingly, “I suspect that they already know that I’m problematic. They even know where my problem is and which faction is involved. There’s no need to test me further.”</p><p>After leaving the Garden of Eden, she had been thinking a lot. She remembered that Mr. World had once said that the Twilight Hermit Order wanted a war that would sweep the entire world.</p><p>Based on the current situation, this goal has been achieved in the past year.</p><p>In other words, the Twilight Hermit Order or Angel of Imagination Adam must’ve used this opportunity to gain quite a number of benefits and experience the corresponding growth.</p><p>And before that, Mr. Fool informed them that Adam was ever closer to the level of a deity.</p><p>Combining all this information, Audrey had a preliminary judgment that Angel of Imagination Adam had a high chance of already reaching the divine throne and becoming a Sequence 0 Visionary.</p><p>Even if “He” wasn’t there yet, “He” wasn’t too far!</p><p>If such a deity who wielded the mind domain cast “His” gaze over, Audrey didn’t believe that her secret could be hidden.</p><p>At present, she could only console herself that the leader of the Twilight Hermit Order, the mastermind behind the Psychology Alchemists wouldn’t place too much importance on a Sequence 4 Manipulator. On the one hand, she had made all sorts of preparations to deal with the possible “accidents.”</p><p>“Perhaps that organization is trying to figure how many members we have in the Tarot Club and what their identities are,” Emlyn replied with a smile as he continued on his train of thought.</p><p>Audrey thought for a moment and nodded.</p><p>“That possibility can’t be ruled out.”</p><p>As she said this, she shot a glance at the end of the long, mottled table and realized that Mr. Fool was only listening to her leisurely without giving her the correct answer.</p><p>This made her feel a lot more at ease. At the same time, she silently decided that she had to be more careful. She had to be able to resolve problems herself, having already reached Sequence 4.</p><p>In any Orthodox Church or secret organization, Sequence 4 was the strongest person in control of an area.</p><p>At this moment, Alger, who had heard their conversation, proposed a brand new possibility:</p><p>“If that secret organization really doesn’t trust you, then it might be an excuse for them to do an observation. Their main goal is to cooperate with us, the Tarot Club, and Mr. Fool.”</p><p>He didn’t know why Miss Justice didn’t mention the Psychology Alchemists directly. All he could do was carefully go along with her.</p><p>Hmm… This is equivalent to me becoming an ambassador of the Tarot Club to the Psychology Alchemists? Audrey nodded slightly and said, “That’s also possible.</p><p>“Then what should I do next?”</p><p>Alger thought for a moment and said, “Stall for time.”</p><p>Good idea… Fors and Emlyn both expressed their agreement.</p><p>After Alger gave the overall strategy, he added in detail, “Try to stall for time and find excuses not to go until the final moment.</p><p>“When you arrive there, start investigating from the periphery and use caution as an excuse to slow down your investigation.</p><p>“If you really can’t delay any further, you can deliberately make mistakes in certain matters and create some commotion so that the mind dragon can detect it early and eliminate any traces.</p><p>“If that secret organization really has any additional motives, the longer you delay, the more they won’t be able to sit still. If they get impatient, they will expose the problem.”</p><p>Cattleya nodded.</p><p>“This is the most suitable response for now.”</p><p>“I understand. Thank you, everyone.” Audrey also felt that Mr. Hanged Man’s suggestion suited her thoughts.</p><p>However, she didn’t delay a certain matter. She immediately turned her head and looked at the end of the long, mottled table. She bowed and said, “Honorable Mr. Fool, has Angel of Imagination Adam advanced to Sequence 0?”</p><p>Not bad. To be able to be aware of this point… The Fool Klein leaned back in his chair and chuckled.</p><p>“Only with the apocalypse approaching did ‘He’ finally take that step.”</p><p>The level of the Garden of Eden had virtually confirmed that Adam was definitely a Visionary.</p><p>Angel of Imagination Adam has become a god? This news immediately reverberated in Derrick and company’s minds, leaving their minds in upheavals for a long time.</p><p>Indeed… Audrey pursed her lips and expressed her gratitude before asking, “What kind of payment do I need to make for this answer?”</p><p>The Fool Klein surveyed the area and said with a smile,</p><p>“There’s no need.</p><p>“It’s a reminder.”</p><p>After this topic ended, because most of the Tarot Club members were still immersed in the impact of Adam becoming a true god, no one spoke for a moment.</p><p>After a few seconds, Derrick looked around and probed, “The City of Silver has already plowed the surrounding fields and planted wheat and other crops, but the harvest will still take some time. I wish to know what we can do to earn gold pounds and purchase resources?”</p><p>After the initial aid, the Church of the Sea God and the government of the Rorsted Archipelago stopped providing free aid. After all, their financial strength was rather limited. In this situation, the City of Silver and Moon City each sold a batch of Beyonder characteristics and monster hides in exchange for a large amount of funds that could be used to purchase various resources.</p><p>However, with the entrance to the Forsaken Land of the Gods closed, they were unable to replenish Beyonder characteristics and monster hides. It was also impossible for the City of Silver and Moon City to give up their military strength either, selling large amounts of combat resources and wasting the opportunity of nurturing their descendants. Therefore, once all the gold pounds, gold, and jewelry were used up, they would undoubtedly fall into a predicament.</p><p>For this reason, the six-member council had been troubled over how to earn gold pounds from the outside world and how to establish a stable financial system. This was a little beyond their capabilities.</p><p>The Beyonder characteristics that the City of Silver and Moon City had previously sold were mainly purchased by the Church of the Sea God and the Rorsted Archipelago government. They were used to establish official Beyonder factions under them. After all, the number of Beyonders needed to cause damage, and the number of Beyonders needed to stabilize an area was on completely different levels.</p><p>In addition, the entire Rorsted Archipelago only had Sea God Kalvetua and the demigod cardinal of the Church of the Lord of Storms. This was slightly insufficient for a new government, especially since the Church of Storms and the Church of Sea God weren’t allies.</p><p>After hearing Little Sun’s plea for help, the other members of the Tarot Club began to seriously consider what the City of Silver and Moon City residents could do.</p><p>Audrey thought for a moment and asked, “What are you best at?”</p><p>“Combat,” Derrick replied without any hesitation.</p><p>Alger nodded slightly when he heard that.</p><p>“Although the world war has ended, law and order hasn’t been restored in the colonies of the Southern Continent. It’s still very chaotic there, and small-scale wars occur from time to time. You can try to form two to three mercenary teams and be hired by any faction.”</p><p>Private military contractors… Klein gave an even more modern name to the suggestion.</p><p>“This is a good idea.” Derrick’s eyes lit up when he heard that.</p><p>Alger asked again, “Combat is a survival instinct. Other than this, do you still have anything you want to do?”</p><p>Derrick replied in embarrassment, “Many people wish to be chefs and brewers, as well as hope to work at candy factories…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
