It had fused with the aura of Sefirah Castle.</p><p>Klein’s figure appeared out of nowhere as the entire divine kingdom of The Fool collapsed. As the magnificent palace reappeared, he grabbed the vessel that carried The Fool card and Amon’s true body and suddenly closed it.</p><p>He didn’t have hopes of using this item to seal Amon, who wielded the corresponding authority of the Door pathway. All he wanted was to buy some time and find a chance to throw Amon out of Sefirah Castle and retrieve the initiative.</p><p>But at that moment, Klein, who was wearing a black trench coat, paused.</p><p>His other hand took out a crystal monocle from the void with his other hand and placed it in his right eye.</p><p>Behind him, Amon, who was wearing a pointed hat and a classic black robe, quickly outlined “His” figure. “His” eyes were dark and wild as “He” laughed.</p><p>“What made you think that I didn’t use an avatar?”</p><p>Before “He” finished his sentence, Klein’s figure that had been parasitized rapidly turned thin, turning into a crude paper figurine.</p><p>Klein was cautious and hadn’t used his true form either. He relied on a Paper Figurine Substitute that had Spirit Body Threads “Grafted.”</p><p>He knew very well that he would rather give up an opportunity than make mistakes when fighting Amon. Once he made a mistake, under the suppression effect of a Bug, it would be very difficult for him to turn the tables.</p><p>With regards to the situation of the prey turning into a paper figurine, Amon didn’t seem to be surprised. All “He” did was raise “His” hand to touch the crystal monocle.</p><p>At the other end of the grand palace, Klein, who was wearing a top hat and a trench coat, uncontrollably walked out of The Fool’s automatic concealment.</p><p>He raised his right hand and took out a crystal monocle from the void with great difficulty, slowly moving it towards his right eye.</p><p>During this process, Klein’s expression was filled with resistance and rather warped, as though he couldn’t control his hand.</p><p>The half-crazy Amon smiled leisurely.</p><p>“You can use paper figurines to replace you, but so can paper figurines replace you.</p><p>“It being ‘Parasitized’ is equivalent to you being ‘Parasitized.’</p><p>“Everything is relative, and all of them have loopholes. No Beyonder power is uncrackable. They can be used in any suitable situation.”</p><p>“He” made use of the relationship of the Paper Figurine Substitute and the main body to create a bug.</p><p>Although Amon looked like “He” was unable to control “His” desire to speak due to “His” madness, it didn’t stop “Him” from corroding Klein with “His” full strength. “He” strengthened the “Parasitizing” bit by bit, making Klein truly wear a monocle and become “Him.”</p><p>At that moment, Klein’s body suddenly collapsed. He had taken the initiative to do so.</p><p>He split into countless transparent maggots that swam in all directions.</p><p>Among these Worms of Spirit, there were a few Worms of Time with twelve segments mixed in.</p><p>Strictly speaking, Amon’s Worms of Time could forcefully “Parasitize” very tiny creatures like the Worms of Spirit. However, when Klein split up, he took the initiative to use his “Fooling” authority to confuse the order of time. He “Fooled” the few Worms of Time, making them split up only towards the end. Unable to find the cluster of Worms of Spirit, they lost their target for “Parasitizing.”</p><p>In the next second, the scene in Sefirah Castle changed again. Klein once again used the Realm of Mysteries powers to create a new divine kingdom for The Fool.</p><p>Amon instantly entered a room.</p><p>This place was covered with a thick yellow carpet with a crystal chandelier hanging from it. There was a door on each wall, and it was unknown where they led to.</p><p>At the same time, there were oil paintings depicting various eyes hanging from the four walls.</p><p>There was no need for any special scrutiny. With just a glance, Amon knew that the four doors corresponded to different effects. The main purpose was to delay “His” actions and create enough time for Klein to make subsequent preparations.</p><p>The corners of Mr. Error curled up slightly as “He” cast “His” gaze to the ground.</p><p>“He” extended “His” right fist and stretched out “His” fingers.</p><p>An illusory door appeared on the thick yellow carpet.</p><p>The door quickly moved for a second before it became fixed in place and silently opened.</p><p>However, with the opening of the illusory door, the doors around the room began to move strangely. The doors creaked and opened!</p><p>Almost at the same time, in the pitch-black wilderness, in a dark tower that led to the sky, Klein was holding the Magic Wishing Lamp and removing the effects of “Fooling” on the Trunsoest Brass Book.</p><p>The candlewick of the Magic Wishing Lamp lit up as it spewed out a sticky, pale-gold glow.</p><p>These rays of light transformed into a distorted, blurry figure.</p><p>Klein didn’t consider making a wish with the Genie to transfer Bernadette’s wishes onto him and change the ownership of the Magic Wishing Lamp. This was because there would only be one outcome. He would die on the spot and return from the fog of history with the Miracle Invoker’s powers.</p><p>Normally, this was a good way to escape, especially since Klein could revive several times.</p><p>However, the situation this time was completely different from before.</p><p>Once Klein died, it would mean that he had temporarily given up on his identity as the owner of Sefirah Castle, making this place a paradise for Amon. “He” could use this sefirah without any obstruction.</p><p>Under such circumstances, Amon could completely “Fool” history, interfere with fate, and suppress Klein’s resurrection, making him truly die.</p><p>The ones who were most effective against a Beyonder were definitely Higher-Sequence Beyonders of the same pathway.</p><p>Therefore, Klein’s current plan was to use the status of the Genie to better use the Trunsoest Brass Book.</p><p>If the Genie didn’t exert a certain influence, the rules set by the Trunsoest Brass Book definitely wouldn’t be biased towards Klein. It would only restrict all existences other than itself.</p><p>As the Genie’s blurry, pale-gold figure took form, the Trunsoest Brass Book produced the sound of colliding metal and quickly flipped to the second half of the book that allowed writing.</p><p>Without any gap in time, new text appeared on the brass page:</p><p>“Theft is prohibited here!”</p><p>If Klein had the choice, the most suitable rule would be “Acts of theft are prohibited here” because the former clause was a law. It couldn’t stop someone from committing theft ahead of time, and it could only deliver punishment after the act. Furthermore, punishment for first-time thieves was inevitably light, something the Amons could withstand. His idea restricted the possibility of such actions—there was no such thing as theft.</p><p>However, there was no way for the Trunsoest Brass Book to make such a rule right now. One had to wait until the provisions were watertight enough, and that it had awakened to a certain extent before that was possible.</p><p>Previously, the Genie had relied on “His” close connection with the Trunsoest Brass Book, “His” high status, and all “His” strength before “He” could enforce similar rules. At this moment, “He” was already drained and unable to do such things.</p><p>At present, all Klein could do was try his best to stall for time so that the Trunsoest Brass Book could produce a sufficiently strict setup of laws to target Amon so as to act in concert with his “Fooling” authority.</p><p>At this moment, in the room that trapped Amon.</p><p>As the illusory door on the ground opened, the four real doors shook and cracks appeared.</p><p>This would bring about many unknown effects.</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of a bell rang out from an endless distance away.</p><p>At some point in time, Amon had transformed into an ancient, mottled stone wall clock. On the wall clock, the second hand formed by the Worm of Time suddenly paused.</p><p>Gong!</p><p>As the bell reverberated, everything in the room froze strangely, including the four doors.</p><p>The only exception was Amon. “He” had transformed back to “His” pointy-hatted, classic black-robed look. With a smile, “He” calmly raised “His” left hand and tightened “His” five fingers.</p><p>In the next second, the strange frozen state was broken. The four doors that were about to open had closed again with a bang, leaving no gaps behind.</p><p>Amon’s figure descended and burrowed into the illusory door that wasn’t closed.</p><p>Just as “He” used this method to leave the room, “He” discovered that “He” had arrived in a pitch-black wilderness. There was a dark tower that seemed to pierce the sky in the distance.</p><p>Inside the tower, the Trunsoest Brass Book in front of Klein had formed a second rule:</p><p>“Deception is prohibited here!”</p><p>Although Amon couldn’t see what was happening, it was as though “He” had sensed something. After all, a high-ranking person who used the rules of deception as entertainment was undoubtedly able to sense the changes in the rules. Otherwise, there was no way of accurately finding loopholes.</p><p>“He” immediately raised “His” hand and adjusted the monocle stuck in “His” right eye.</p><p>On the surface of the crystal monocle, a blinding, pure white light spewed out, illuminating the wilderness. There were no longer any concealed existences here.</p><p>This was the “eternal daytime” that “He” had previously given to Klein and retrieved from Klein’s “main body”!</p><p>In such an environment, the dark tower melted inch by inch. Klein floated in midair with one hand holding the Magic Wishing Lamp, and the other holding the Staff of the Stars. In front of him was the open Trunsoest Brass Book.</p><p>Amon took the opportunity to stretch out “His” hand that was holding onto the monocle. From a distance, “He” gripped Klein’s projection to his palm.</p><p>Behind him, the shadow that had been dragged out by the “eternal daytime” seemed to become fainter as it twisted with vitality.</p><p>Without a sound, Amon began “Stealing” Klein’s various Beyonder powers.</p><p>“He” didn’t deliberately seek out the “Fooling” authority. Instead, “He” chose to be random to increase the success rate.</p><p>However, with a flash of light, what fell into “His” palm was only a simple paper figurine.</p><p>Grafting!</p><p>Pa!</p><p>The shadow behind Amon’s back was lashed by an invisible whip, and “He” was completely unharmed.</p><p>“He” created an error, letting “His” shadow replace “Him.”</p><p>Following that, Amon laughed as “His” voice resounded in Klein’s ears.</p><p>“Genie, I can also promise to send you back to the cosmos.</p><p>“Look, I wasn’t punished. This means that I’m not swindling you.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
