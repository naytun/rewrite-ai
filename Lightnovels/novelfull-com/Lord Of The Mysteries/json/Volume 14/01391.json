They were used to such situations and felt that it was as natural as the sun rising.</p><p>After Cattleya returned to the real world, she pondered for a moment before spreading open a piece of paper and writing.</p><p>She wanted to ask the Queen what happened recently.</p><p>In fact, before Mr. Fool announced that “He” would enter deep sleep, Cattleya had already sensed the impending monumental change.</p><p>Whether it was the sudden closing of the doors or the meteor shower streaking across the sky to illuminate the world, it gave her some inspiration as a Clairvoyant, allowing her to see some blurry visions.</p><p>Of course, she was limited by her own level, position, and status. She didn’t have enough knowledge of what had happened, and she was unable to grasp what exactly had caused Mr. Fool to choose to sleep. All she could do was ask Queen Mystic Bernadette, who had long advanced to the level of an angel and led a mysterious organization while being in control of many powerful Sealed Artifacts.</p><p>Just as Cattleya summoned the messenger and took out the letter she had written, she was taken aback.</p><p>At that moment, a purple light was accentuated in her eyes. It became extremely saturated and slowly flowed like a river.</p><p>She felt that Mr. Fool had entered a deep sleep.</p><p>Unconcealable hesitation, confusion, and sadness arose in the Admiral of Stars’ heart.</p><p>For some reason, she felt an inexplicable palpitation, and two drops of tears unknowingly slid down her face.</p><p>She seemed to understand something, yet nothing. She only knew that it was unknown how much time it would take for Mr. Fool to wake up from “His” slumber.</p><p>Taking off the heavy glasses on her nose bridge, Cattleya wiped the corners of her eyes, allowing her emotions to return to normal.</p><p>She walked to the window and looked at the deck.</p><p>Frank Lee warmly invited the crew to taste his newly brewed beer, but none of the pirates dared to try it.</p><p>Thankfully, I sent Cielf to the Queen ahead of time. Now, all I need to do is watch over Frank… Without Mr. Fool’s watch, I have to be more careful and pay more attention to him. Yes, I have to find something for Frank to do other than research. He’s a first mate, so he can’t always be working on something else… Cattleya thought with a heavy expression.</p><p>After considering how to deal with Frank, as well as how to reorganize the small number of pirates from the Earth and Moon pathway onto other ships, and not frequently interact with Frank, Cattleya focused her focus on the Hidden Sage.</p><p>Although she was already one of the ten pillars of the Moses Ascetic Order, due to her background and the influence of the Hidden Sage, she had never received the trust of the president and the other higher-ups. She could only be an ostracized person who teetered on the periphery of the organization who had her own circle and respective faction.</p><p>From a certain perspective, her relationship with the Moses Ascetic Order was closer to that of a partner. On the one hand, she needed a faction and a powerhouse to project her will over the Five Seas. On the other hand, she yearned to obtain corresponding knowledge and materials.</p><p>And to obtain the information regarding the Hidden Sage that represented a deity suddenly coming to life and confirming “His” current state would necessarily require her to become a core member of the Moses Ascetic Order.</p><p>With my present identity, there’s no problem with me participating in the internal decisions of the Moses Ascetic Order. Only by truly participating in these will I be able to come into contact with more information and elevate my own status… However, this will be rather dangerous. Even if the Hidden Sage’s condition isn’t right, and doesn’t interfere with the Moses Ascetic Order’s operations, the other higher-ups will also be subjected to the infringement of interests and be in constant suspicion. They will counterattack to a certain degree… There are at least two of the ten pillars that I can’t see through, making me instinctively feel danger…</p><p>And confirming the state of the Hidden Sage will be even more dangerous. If anything goes wrong, I’ll immediately be corrupted and eroded by “Him”… The more Cattleya thought about it, the more she felt that the mission given by Mr. Fool was difficult.</p><p>She had always been teetering at the periphery of the Moses Ascetic Order with her identity as a pirate. In fact, she had her worries about this matter. She was afraid that if she went too deep into the organization’s internal affairs, it would expose the fact that she was still in contact with Queen Mystic. She was afraid that the other ten pillars would one day suddenly point her out as a spy and eliminate her on the spot.</p><p>At that moment, Cattleya even wanted to abandon Mr. Fool’s mission and identity as one of the ten pillars of the Moses Ascetic Order. She wished to return to the Dawn and returned to the Queen’s side.</p><p>That way, she wouldn’t need to worry about this matter anymore—if there were any problems, the Queen would be able to stop them.</p><p>Ever since she left the Dawn, she had to shoulder everything by herself. Cattleya had always felt exhausted as her shoulders remained heavy.</p><p>However, this thought was quickly given up by Cattleya.</p><p>She sighed softly. She understood that she would never be able to return to the time when she was a little girl without worries.</p><p>She wasn’t only responsible for her own life, but also the fate of Frank, Heath, Nina, and the other crew members.</p><p>Furthermore, she had predicted the arrival of the apocalypse. She hoped that she could become the Queen’s most powerful helper and do something for this world.</p><p>Cattleya closed her eyes and muttered to herself, “Then face it.”</p><p>To truly integrate into the Moses Ascetic Order and gather the relevant information.</p><p>After making this decision, Cattleya no longer concealed her strength. She raised her hands and used a fairy tale magic.</p><p>In the eyes of the surrounding pirate ship crew, the Future and its fleet became illusory at the same time, turning into countless bubbles.</p><p>The bubbles reflected a dreamy color under the light’s illumination.</p><p>Then, they slowly melted into the sea.</p><p>Just like that, the Future and its fleet disappeared from everyone’s eyes.</p><p>Many knowledgeable pirates were first shocked and stunned. Then, they had a thought:</p><p>A new Queen over the seas has been born.</p><p>Queen of Stars!</p><p>…</p><p>Backlund, in a particular house.</p><p>Xio, who had yet to sort out her thoughts after returning to the real world, saw Fors’s figure appear in front of her as she shouted, “That mission of yours is too dangerous!”</p><p>Xio was taken aback as she instinctively pointed out a problem.</p><p>“You didn’t knock.”</p><p>This was the worst part of living together with a demigod of the Apprentice pathway.</p><p>Fors first reflected on herself for a second before confidently saying, “You didn’t close the door.”</p><p>She pointed at the ajar bedroom door.</p><p>I actually didn’t close the door. That’s right. This was a last-minute gathering. I wasn’t prepared for it before the matter… Xio opened her mouth, but she couldn’t say a word.</p><p>Both of them looked at each other speechlessly for a long time, but none of them broke the silence.</p><p>Finally, Fors decided to forget the accusation and focused on the mission itself.</p><p>“A mission that involves Sequence 1 and a Uniqueness is too dangerous.”</p><p>With that said, she recalled that Xio had already accepted Mr. Fool’s gift. Her eyes reddened uncontrollably as she couldn’t help but mumble, “Remember to get my help. At the very least… I can help you escape.”</p><p>To them, the things they experienced before had involved very few matters at the Sequence 1 level. Apart from Mr. Fool and The World Gehrman Sparrow, at most it was them being watched by He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.</p><p>At other times, they would at most do trivial matters at the periphery of corresponding matters. They had never faced an enemy that could be addressed as “Him.”</p><p>Therefore, when she thought of how her friend’s mission involved Sequence 1 Beyonder characteristic, or even a Uniqueness and true deity, Fors couldn’t help but feel nervous and worried.</p><p>Xio smiled and said, “I’m just seeking clues and investigating the truth. It’s not like I need to face ‘Them’ directly.”</p><p>She paused for a second and said, “The apocalypse is approaching. We have to do something.</p><p>“Look, even Mr. Fool has fallen into a deep sleep. What’s more, trivial figures like us? If I didn’t quickly become a demigod, perhaps there’s nothing I can do. Now… There’s at least some hope. At the very least, I can try to awaken Mr. Fool.”</p><p>Fors had experienced many things and had long understood this principle. She had only been venting her emotions, but now, she had calmed down.</p><p>She thought for a moment and said, “What are you going to do next?”</p><p>“Just relying on myself to investigate it will definitely be very difficult. I’ll definitely need to use MI9’s intelligence network. I plan on finding a suitable opportunity to let them know that I’m a Sequence 4 demigod. In order to not be suspected, I might need Miss Justice to give me some hints and make some arrangements,” Xio answered seriously.</p><p>Fors’s thoughts raced.</p><p>“I’ll come up with a script for you. Uh, I’ll act as an antagonist and simulate a lunatic who attempted to advance to Sequence 4 Imperative Mage, and then be defeated by you…”</p><p>As she spoke, a story took form. She immediately sat beside Xio’s desk, took out a pen and paper, and started writing.</p><p>“After I write up the story, I’ll get Miss Justice to make some amendments and make it appear reasonable,” Fors said as she wrote.</p><p>As a Secrets Sorcerer, there was no doubt that she could prevent their conversation from leaking out.</p><p>Xio thought for a moment and said, “Isn’t your most important task now to write the biographies and stories?”</p><p>“Ha, that’s simple. I’ve already thought of plenty of scenes, and there’s a lot of material on my mind. No, nothing of that sort…” After muttering a few words, Fors placed all her focus on writing a script for Xio so as to gain MI9’s approval.</p><p>Seeing her good friend focused on her matter, a smile gradually appeared on Xio’s face.</p><p>She then cast her gaze to the ajar door and heard her brother, Dio Derecha, seemingly reciting the ancient Feysac words. This was a requirement for studying law to become a lawyer.</p><p>Their mother was instructing two servants to clean up the living room.</p><p>Their voices reached Xio’s ears, and her expression gradually became firm.</p><p>Although she had no idea what would happen when she faced the MI9 brass, and even though she would encounter unknown dangers when completing Mr. Fool’s mission, as well as the unknown future during the dawn of the apocalypse, Xio knew that if she didn’t do anything or take on certain risks and just enjoyed the pleasant times with her family just like that, she would ultimately be drowned by the floods like most people who were unprepared.</p><p>And now, there was at least a path filled with brambles, one that had a glimmer of light at the end of it.</p><p>It needed the realization of sacrifice, and to grasp it with courage.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
