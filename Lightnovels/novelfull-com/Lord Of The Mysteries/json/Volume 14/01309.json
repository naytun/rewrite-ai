She knew that she had completed the corresponding ritual, preventing a disaster that involved a higher order of power.</p><p>However, the price she paid was to personally seal her father, the father she had missed and sought for more than a hundred years.</p><p>“How ironic…” Bernadette looked at the vertical eye embedded with diamonds and sighed softly.</p><p>After leaving Intis, she had two big wishes. First, she wanted to investigate the truth behind the matter and see if she had misunderstood her father. Second, she wanted to follow her father’s footsteps and see if there was a possibility of reviving him.</p><p>Bernadette had already fulfilled her first wish. The truth was that she had indeed misunderstood her father. This curtailed her pain and conflicted feelings. Her hatred for her father had completely dissipated, but it also added to her guilt.</p><p>With this kind of guilt and yearning all this time, she tried her best to fulfill her second wish, but the outcome wasn’t pleasant.</p><p>If there hadn’t been any hope from the beginning, she might not have had such a huge reaction. However, she had clearly seen the light and seen her father, but she had no choice but to personally place him into a state of slumber.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Bernadette’s slightly unfocused eyes became clear again.</p><p>She no longer hesitated and no longer blamed herself. She no longer had all kinds of negative emotions. She firmly raised her right hand and drew out ancient words that shimmered with a stellar radiance in the void. She summoned the spirit world creature who was half-man, half-wind, and she retrieved the Sage supplementary ingredients from it.</p><p>As for the rest, as there was no need for them to be specially preserved, they were in the collection room of the Dawn.</p><p>Not long after, Bernadette used Pale Death to shatter the Sage Frontlet. She concocted the potion that could allow her to advance to Sequence 2.</p><p>Looking at the bubbling Sage potion with each bubble containing a transparent eye, Bernadette firmly raised her right hand and brought the glass bottle to her mouth.</p><p>She knew that what she needed at this moment wasn’t sorrow, nor corny emotions, but determination and the will to forge forward. This was because if she wanted to help her father, Emperor Roselle, escape the corruption and completely revive, she needed a higher Sequence and greater strength.</p><p>Because of this, she was willing to bury the pain in the deepest part of her heart and not let it affect her mental state. It was only when there was no one around at night that she could retrieve it and savor it alone.</p><p>With the Sage potion entering her mouth, Bernadette’s body turned illusory at a discernible pace.</p><p>She broke down into thick and complicated knowledge, changing into an existence that was a flux of information.</p><p>The entire Dawn, as well as the surrounding winds, storms, lightning, seawater, and waves, all lost their sense of reality. It was as though they had been restored to the most fundamental blocks of information.</p><p>For most of Sequence 3 Beyonders of the Mystery Pryer pathway, such a state was extremely dangerous. If one’s willpower wasn’t strong enough, their luck wasn’t good enough, and they weren’t prepared enough, the knowledge that they had transformed into would be infiltrated by all kinds of information within seconds. They would be washed away, assimilated, and thus quickly lose consciousness. They wouldn’t be able to reassemble their bodies, turning into a very strange and difficult monster to deal with in mysticism.</p><p>A Knowledge Demon!</p><p>This was also known as an Information Creature.</p><p>Bernadette had relied on the Sage Frontlet and had previously transformed into a flux of information on several occasions. Although it was limited to two to three seconds and didn’t last too long, it was still considered experience. At that moment, she tried her best to maintain her consciousness and establish a connection with the information produced in the spirit world by preventing a high-level disaster.</p><p>The information had a clear imprint belonging to her, and it involved a very high level of power. It was exceptionally “solid” and couldn’t be dispersed by other information for short periods of time. It helped her to stabilize her consciousness and slowly gather the dissipating flux of information around her body.</p><p>During this process, Klein, who was above the gray fog, tapped the edge of the long mottled table with the help of the prayer light. He used a Miracle Invoker’s ability of changing the probability of certain developments and actions to a certain extent, and he bestowed Bernadette with a certain amount of good luck.</p><p>Time ticked by. There were several times when Bernadette wavered on the border of losing consciousness, but in the end, she managed to tide through it. She gathered all the information that belonged to her and began to reconstruct her body.</p><p>At that moment, she gradually felt the concern Admiral of Stars Cattleya had for her. She felt the members of the Element Dawn and her crew making their daily prayers.</p><p>This stabilized her condition better, allowing her to resist the ancient will that was slowly developing in her body.</p><p>At this moment, a series of secret information came from nowhere. Taking the opportunity while Bernadette was reforming her body, it attempted to fuse with her.</p><p>This was interference from the Hidden Sage!</p><p>As an embodiment of this world’s knowledge and information, as a quasi-Sequence 0 existence of the Mystery Pryer pathway, the Hidden Sage had a certain influence on Beyonders of a lower Sequencer than “Him.”</p><p>Without giving Bernadette the chance to use the pale-white mask, the “curtain” draped over Klein gently rose.</p><p>Space-time distorted around Bernadette, completely isolating her from the outside world. Even information couldn’t be interchanged.</p><p>Grabbing this sudden moment of peace, Bernadette completely reassembled her body and used her own anchors to balance out the terrifying will that was surfacing in her body.</p><p>At that moment, she had truly become a “She,” a Sequence 2 angel of the Mystery Pryer pathway—an important figure in the mysterious world that could be addressed as a secret existence.</p><p>Right on the heels of that, she saw the distorted space around her return to normal. She saw a series of hidden information surging towards her.</p><p>She stretched out her right hand and grabbed the information with ease, extracting the useful information contained within.</p><p>Just as Bernadette was about to return to reality from the spirit world, an orange light suddenly bloomed in front of her eyes.</p><p>The light instantly condensed into a fat elder with a short white beard.</p><p>The elder smiled and said, “Ma’am, I’m Orange Light Hilarion.”</p><p>Orange Light… Bernadette was puzzled. She didn’t understand why Orange Light Hilarion had suddenly appeared in front of her—they hadn’t interacted much before.</p><p>As the leader of the Element Dawn and a former Mysticologist, she wasn’t unfamiliar with the Seven Lights of the spirit world. She even knew how to pray to Seven Lights, as well as the ritual needed to receive the corresponding advice. She knew that the seven lustrous lights were a symbol of the spirit world, and they contained endless knowledge of different domains. They were definitely at the angel level.</p><p>Orange Light Hilarion added with a smile, “A great existence wants me to inform you of the knowledge regarding the Great Old Ones, the Outer Deities, and the Cosmos, so that you have a relatively accurate grasp of the state of this world and the corresponding corruption.”</p><p>“Which existence is it?” Bernadette asked, puzzled and cautious.</p><p>She had vaguely guessed the answer, but she still found it quite unbelievable. After all, the Seven Lights in the spirit world were also important figures in the mysterious world. Even if a Sequence 0 true god wouldn’t find it easy to get “Them” to do “Their” bidding.</p><p>Orange Light Hilarion chuckled and replied, “The greater ruler above the spirit world.”</p><p>The great ruler above the spirit world… Bernadette repeated the honorific name, and her thoughts raced.</p><p>Hilarion glanced at her and smiled.</p><p>“‘He’ also has another title:</p><p>“Mr. Fool.”</p><p>…</p><p>Somewhere out at sea, the Future which was cruising on a safe sea route.</p><p>Cattleya suddenly jolted awake from her dream as her forehead was covered in cold sweat.</p><p>In the dream just now, she saw the Queen lying on the ground drenched in blood. Her chest was torn open, and a baby-like monster crawled out of it.</p><p>As a Mysticologist, a Mysticologist who had advanced with a drop of the Snake of Fate’s blood, Cattleya believed that her dream wasn’t without any reason. It was definitely a premonition.</p><p>It was obvious that the dream she had wasn’t pleasant.</p><p>While feeling uneasy, Cattleya sat up and put on her cloak. She attempted to pray to Mr. Fool, hoping that this mighty existence would give her some hints or to protect the Queen.</p><p>Soon, a scene appeared before her eyes.</p><p>Queen Mystic Bernadette walked out of the spirit world and returned to Dawn, allowing the ship to gradually distance itself from the nameless island.</p><p>Cattleya immediately heaved a sigh of relief and sincerely thanked Mr. Fool.</p><p>After finishing her prayer, she opened the window of the captain’s cabin in joy, causing starlight to condense into a long bridge that reached the deck.</p><p>She put on her heavy glasses and walked along the resplendent bridge of starlight to the deck where she proceeded to stroll leisurely in the quiet night.</p><p>When she arrived at the bow of the ship, Cattleya saw Frank Lee tinkering with bottles.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Cattleya subconsciously frowned.</p><p>Frank looked up and said with a bright smile, “My ideas encountered a setback so I can’t proceed any further for now. I asked Nina to get me some soil from the bottom of the sea to study the microbes in it.”</p><p>With that said, Frank said with a look of anticipation,</p><p>“When I have my next vacation, I’d like to go to the depths of the North Sea or the poles where it’s a world of ice and snow. There might be many ancient microorganisms buried beneath the thick layer of ice there, from the Fourth Epoch, the Third Epoch, or even the Second and First Epoch. This will bring me plenty.”</p><p>You won’t have any vacations for the time being… Cattleya said inwardly.</p><p>…</p><p>Klein conjured a box and placed the four Cards of Blasphemy inside. After sealing them, he immediately returned to the real world and headed for the nearest Evernight cathedral.</p><p>He planned on informing the Evernight Goddess in the form of a prayer of the hidden dangers of the Card of Blasphemy, reminding “Her” to pay attention to such problems. He didn’t want the Earth Mother, Lilith, to obtain the Mother card or The Moon Card.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
