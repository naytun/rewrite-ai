How can one person drive two cars? I can’t help but mutter inwardly.</p><p>This is the cultivation I’ve gone through as a fan of courtroom dramas and detective series, as well as me being a loyal reader of crime deduction novels.</p><p>Of course, I don’t say it out loud. I believe that people with standard intelligence can come to a similar conclusion.</p><p>When the guard on duty calls to confirm my identity, I take out my phone and check the time.</p><p>There’s more than enough time… I let out a sigh of relief as I unhurriedly circle around the pond in the middle of the courtyard and enter the building facing the main entrance.</p><p>After I run through the possible exchange in my mind, I knock on the door of the target’s office three minutes early.</p><p>“Please come in.” A mellow voice sounds from inside.</p><p>“O-Officer Deng…” As soon as I push open the door and enter, I realize that the officer sitting behind the desk is the one who had come to check on my residence permit!</p><p>I always imagined that he’s a police officer at the police station, but I never expected him to have an office at the Municipal Public Security Bureau. He even has the room to himself!</p><p>“You are?” Officer Deng raises his hand to comb his receding hairline and asks with a puzzled look, “Do we know each other?”</p><p>“Last night, you checked on my residence permit and reminded me of a mysterious cult. Later, we met again in Lawson. I even reported a woman suspected to be a member of the cult.” I begin to suspect that the person in front of me is Officer Deng’s biological brother, but I still give the details.</p><p>Officer Deng is enlightened.</p><p>“Zhou-Zhou Mingrui, right?</p><p>“I’m face-blind, and I don’t have a good memory. It was night, so I couldn’t see clearly.”</p><p>I don’t need you to tell me that your memory isn’t good or how you have face-blindness. I can tell… I politely smile.</p><p>“Today, I’m representing the Intis Group to take over the previous project.”</p><p>“Yes, we agreed to meet at four.” Officer Deng points at the chair opposite his desk.</p><p>I immediately approach it and plan on placing the black notebook that I just bought on the table. I will then flip it to the middle—I can’t let Officer Deng notice that I just bought it and have never written on it.</p><p>Officer Deng glances at the notebook and frowns slightly.</p><p>Following that, he picks up the phone and dials an internal department number.</p><p>“Hey, the Intis Group is here. Come over for a meeting.”</p><p>After a simple briefing, he puts down the phone and smiles at me.</p><p>“This is an international collaboration project. We can’t decide on our own. Yes, the other party’s representative will be here soon.”</p><p>“I’m aware of that.” I’ve read the relevant documents in the morning and know what’s going on.</p><p>Of course, even if I’m lazy and didn’t read it, I’ll still have given such an answer. I can’t let the partner I’m working with find out that I’m skiving and not doing my job well.</p><p>Not long after I sit down, I hear Officer Deng’s office door open.</p><p>I stand up politely and look back. I see an old man in a long black robe.</p><p>His hair is white, and the wrinkles at the edge of his eyes and mouth are deeply recessed. His dark red eyes appear slightly turbid.</p><p>A red moon pendant hangs on his chest. He looks like a priest from a cathedral.</p><p>A foreign priest… I nod with a smile, fully displaying my courtesy.</p><p>For some reason, I find this old man a little familiar, just like the first time I met Officer Deng.</p><p>Strange… Recently, I’ve been feeling sad for some inexplicable reason. Is this the after-effect of the Assassin beverage? I silently inhale and control my emotions.</p><p>At that moment, Officer Deng introduces, “Old Neil, an Interpol representative, a clergyman.”</p><p>“Hello, Mr. Neil.” I quickly greet him.</p><p>Old Neil doesn’t speak. He sizes me up and chuckles.</p><p>“Lad, have you been troubled by ghosts recently?”</p><p>…You can tell? I’m shocked. I don’t know if I should admit it or hide it from a stranger.</p><p>“Don’t lie. My eyes are very sharp.” Old Neil smiles and points at his eyes.</p><p>“A little…” I mutter.</p><p>“Haha.” Old Neil immediately laughs. “You’re still too young. You confessed the moment I called you out. Actually, I’m not that sure. Yes, I’m a priest. I have the ability to expel wraiths and shadows. Do you need my help?”</p><p>…Is it okay to discuss such feudal superstitions in front of a police officer? I open my mouth, speechless.</p><p>Old Neil walks to Officer Deng’s table and very naturally picks up the coffee can on it.</p><p>“Don’t worry. I don’t charge much. If you’re still a believer of the Goddess, I can even do it for free.”</p><p>I wasn’t a believer of the Goddess in the past, but I am now! At this moment, my heart is palpitating.</p><p>I hesitate for two seconds before sighing.</p><p>“But, I’ve already found a helper.”</p><p>“Who is it? There aren’t many people with such abilities. Most of them are cheats.” Old Neil skillfully brews his coffee and asks casually.</p><p>“…Daly, do you know her?” I ask hesitantly.</p><p>“Daly… Ah, then that’s fine.” Old Neil retracts his smile and asks, “Are you the representative of the Intis Group? Let’s begin.”</p><p>At the same time, Officer Deng shakes his head with a smile, looking helpless.</p><p>“You know Madam Daly?” I ask.</p><p>Old Neil sighs and points at Officer Deng.</p><p>“His fiancée.”</p><p>“Oh, oh…” Everyone knows each other! I can’t help but sigh.</p><p>This boosts my confidence in Madam Daly.</p><p>I stop chatting and begin communicating with Officer Deng and Old Neil about the project, taking note of their requests.</p><p>An hour passes.</p><p>“Yawn.” Old Neil stretches his back. “It’s finally over. These old bones of mine really can’t withstand the torment of such meetings. I no longer have the energy.”</p><p>With that said, he stands up and smiles at me and Officer Deng.</p><p>“It’s time for me to retire.</p><p>“It’s time for me to leave. I’ll go to a faraway village. I’ll grow some flowers, feed the chickens, and play the piano for my wife. I don’t have to worry about things here anymore.”</p><p>Officer Deng stands up as well. As he sends Old Neil out, he smiles and says, “Let’s go together.”</p><p>As I watch them leave, I suddenly feel speechless.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
