Even if I don’t pay attention to them, I would often find women that catch my attention.</p><p>But even so, this person that’s inside Lawson is a rare gem. I can’t help but steal another look after seeing her.</p><p>Her brown-dyed hair cascades down like a waterfall, and two crystal-like accessories hang from her earlobes. Her eyes sparkle, looking as clear and beautiful as the eyes of deers in forests. She has plenty of charisma.</p><p>Out of courtesy and habitual shyness, I tear my eyes away from the girl and walk past her to the area where the fridge is.</p><p>During this process, I can’t help but turn around to take a few more looks, but I suppress my actions to avoid offending her.</p><p>Hmm, which ice cream should I buy? I gaze at the transparent sliding door of the coolbox and fall into deep thought.</p><p>Recently, the more popular ones are “Fat Crabs,” “Iron Cauldron Stew”…</p><p>Taking into account my successful “weight loss” and my need to prevent any rebounds, as well as my tight financial situation at the end of the month, I ultimately chose “Fat Crabs.”</p><p>Then, I go to the neighboring room to get a bottle of chilled CR and a packet of cucumber-flavored potato chips.</p><p>All three combined form my supper for the night.</p><p>If it was the beginning of the month, I definitely would’ve bought more. I’ll keep them at home and eat them when there’s a need. I don’t have to go downstairs every time, but there’s no need to be so carefree with my expenses now.</p><p>CEO Huang had once said: “Don’t let trivialities take up your most important liquidity.”</p><p>Without any hesitation, I take my snacks and walk to the counter to stand in line to settle the bill.</p><p>At this moment, I suddenly smell a faint fragrance.</p><p>In the next second, I turn my head and see the gorgeous beauty walk past two rows of shelves. She smiles and says with her eyes shimmering, “Can I add you on WeChat?”</p><p>?</p><p>Me? I arch my arms a little and express my puzzlement in my speech and pose.</p><p>I’ve never had girls ask me for my contact details all my life!</p><p>“That’s right.” The beauty nods happily and says with a smile, “Your looks and temperament matches my taste. I want to get to know you.”</p><p>If she were to praise me for being handsome or good-looking, I definitely wouldn’t have believed her. However, it’s not impossible that my looks and temperament matches her tastes.</p><p>Maybe she likes my type, right?</p><p>For a moment, I understand what it means to be overwhelmed and flattered.</p><p>In the next second, I become more wary.</p><p>Could it be some multi-level marketing scheme?</p><p>Or some honey trap?</p><p>As an aficionado of legal shows, a fan of the Legal Report of many years, I am instinctively wary of good things falling into my lap.</p><p>As I hesitate, the eyes of that beautiful woman standing in front of me fogs up. It makes me feel ashamed and guilty.</p><p>Perhaps it’s not some multi-level marketing or honey trap… Even if it is, she’s just adding me on WeChat. It won’t be a problem if I pay more attention in the future… I think for a moment and hurriedly say, “Alright.”</p><p>I turn around and place the bottle of CR on the counter before taking out my phone from my pocket.</p><p>However, when I look at that girl again, she has already disappeared.</p><p>It’s not as if I can’t see her. I can still see instances of her back appearing through the cracks of the shelves.</p><p>…What about appreciating my looks and temperament… How did you have a change of heart so quickly? Just as this thought flashes through my mind, I heard a chime!</p><p>The door of the convenience store opens automatically, and a figure walks in.</p><p>It’s Officer Deng who had checked on my residence permit in the evening, but he has already changed into casual wear.</p><p>He walks to the front desk and tugs at the bottom of his black jacket’s bottom. He says to the staff, “A cup of coffee.”</p><p>As he speaks, Officer Deng turns to look at me.</p><p>“A-are you footing your bill?”</p><p>Before he can finish, he pinches his forehead.</p><p>“You are, you are Zhou, Zhou…”</p><p>“Zhou Mingrui, Officer Deng. We just met this evening,” I reply with a smile.</p><p>At that moment, from the corner of my eye, I catch the woman leaving the convenience store.</p><p>She gave up striking up a conversation with me and ran off in a hurry because she saw Officer Deng? Is she really involved in multi-level marketing or pulling a honey trap?? Feeling regretful and puzzled, I hand over the items in my hand to the shop assistant and say without minding, “Give Officer Deng his coffee first.”</p><p>The shop assistant spends some time making the coffee before giving it to Officer Deng.</p><p>He gives me a friendly smile and heads out with the cup in hand.</p><p>After taking a few steps, he stops and says with a self-deprecating smile, “I forgot to remind you that the cult will use all kinds of means to approach the target. Be careful.”</p><p>Cult… Suddenly, I am aware of a possibility:</p><p>Could that beauty from before be from that cult?</p><p>She hit on me because I drank the Assassin beverage and became their target?</p><p>Th-this method really makes it impossible to guard against! They actually used a honey trap! I’m alarmed. With Officer Deng about to turn around and leave the convenience store, I rush forward and say to him, “Just now, a woman wanted to add me on WeChat.”</p><p>Officer Deng doesn’t laugh at me. He asks very formally, “What does she look like?”</p><p>“Very beautiful, more beautiful than many celebrities…” I give a simple description and conclude, “I don’t think I have the charm to make a beauty hit on me.”</p><p>“Not bad. Many victims only get deceived because they feel that they are very charming,” says Officer Deng with a smile. “We will track and investigate this. As for you, you should just try your best. Try not to speak to strangers as depicted in television dramas. Speaking is fine, just don’t establish more connections.”</p><p>My heart warms as I nod vigorously.</p><p>“Alright.”</p><p>After seeing Officer Deng leave, I return to the counter to settle the bill. I take the snacks and walk to the entrance of my residential compound.</p><p>Along the way, after passing the barbecue stall, the strong fragrance inundates my nostrils again. It tempts me to sit down and order a pile of food.</p><p>I sweep a glance, and I see a group of gangsters.</p><p>They’re sitting on simple plastic stools at the barbecue stall, waiting for the food to be cooked.</p><p>Their hair is dyed in all sorts of colors, and it’s obvious that they’re punks following the scene subculture.</p><p>If it were in the past, I definitely would’ve upped my pace and widened my distance to avoid any unnecessary conflicts.</p><p>But now, I’m looking forward to them making things difficult for me. I want them to have a good taste of an assassin’s prowess.</p><p>Just then, one of the hoodlums glances at me and stands up abruptly.</p><p>Holding a stack of paper, he jogs towards me.</p><p>I’m thrilled and begin to imagine what pose I should put on later.</p><p>The charred yellow-eyebrowed hoodlum quickly comes in front of me and says, “Hi there, perhaps you would be interested in Dream Tutoring Classes?”</p><p>?</p><p>Dream Tutoring Classes?</p><p>This development is completely different from what I expected!</p><p>As he speaks, the hoodlum hands a flyer to me.</p><p>“Our Dream Tutoring Classes covers many topics. Even if you’re already working, you can learn things from the courses to improve yourselves and even switch careers.”</p><p>I blankly receive the flyer and subconsciously ask, “Are you a tutor?”</p><p>“Yes, I’m a foreign language teacher.” The hoodlum smiles arrogantly. “My surname is Da.”</p><p>Before he can finish his sentence, a few of the hoodlums shout, “Dani, the food is ready. It’s time to dig in!”</p><p>“**!” The hoodlum in front of me turns around and flips his middle finger before running back.</p><p>I shake my head in disappointment and wrap my snacks in the flier before entering my compound and return to my rented apartment building.</p><p>As this place is old, there are a few lamps along the stairs that are out. Some of the floors are dark. I have to take out my cell phones to turn on the flashlight function before I can see where I’m placing my feet clearly.</p><p>The surroundings are very quiet. My phone suddenly flashes a few times, turning extremely dim.</p><p>At the same time, I feel a cold wind blow past me.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
