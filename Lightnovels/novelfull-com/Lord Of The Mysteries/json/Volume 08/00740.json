This puppet was stuck in the deceased’s right eye socket.</p><p>Fors observed the puppet seriously just like the other gathering participants. She discovered that it was slender, and its entire body resembled a tiny wooden piece that had been engraved with crescent-like eyes and a mouth. Embedded in it were dried grass and flowers.</p><p><em>Doesn’t look like anything special…</em> Fors mumbled inwardly. Her spiritual perception didn’t sense anything as her pen-wielding hand continued hovering over a bronze-green notebook.</p><p>The man in the iron mask continued the introduction:</p><p>“My friend and I are unable to determine what use this puppet has, and we can only suspect that it’s not simple. It might also hide quite a secret.</p><p>“60 pounds. For just 60 pounds, you can have it. This price is very fair. Even if it has nothing to do with mysticism, it’s not a bad antique worth forty to fifty pounds.</p><p>“That is to say you’ll be spending 10 pounds to have a chance of a pleasant surprise. To you, this is a small sum of money.”</p><p><em>A very tempting explanation. This gentleman is likely a successful salesman. However, I don’t even have 10 pounds…</em> As Fors engaged in a self-deprecating laugh, she didn’t believe that anyone would buy the so-called Moon Puppet of unknown origins and usage.</p><p>Just as she had that thought, she heard a female voice which was deliberately suppressed.</p><p>“50 pounds.”</p><p><em>Is she too rich, or is she willing to try her luck?</em> Fors subconsciously turned her head to look at the speaking person, only to see the lady wearing a hooded long robe. Her face was hidden in the shadows.</p><p>At that moment, the owner of the Moon Puppet laughed.</p><p>“I’ll be more inclined to keep it for myself. Perhaps, there might come a time when I discover what’s so special about it.”</p><p>As he spoke, he realized that no one was offering a better price. He immediately said, “Of course, as a gentleman, I’ll satisfy your wish since you have expressed your desire and have given a reasonable price.”</p><p>“Deal,” the hooded woman replied with a deep voice.</p><p>Soon, the gathering’s attendant helped them complete the transaction. Fors noticed that the lady’s hand was trembling slightly after she received the Moon Puppet.</p><p><em>She places great importance on the item… She might actually know what’s so special about the puppet… Moon Puppet… Moon… From the Southern Continent…</em> Fors suddenly made connections and recalled the few Primordial Moon believers who Mr. Moon was searching for. She began having a suspicion that the hooded lady was one of them, or that she had a connection with them.</p><p>Of course, she had zero evidence. She didn’t even have much of a compelling reason to have such a guess.</p><p><em>Phew…</em> Fors silently exhaled as she decided to find a way to verify her theory.</p><p>She casually moved the hard-covered notebook in her hand, making a yellowish-brown goatskin appear.</p><p>On the piece of paper were all kinds of patterns that formed an ancient, mysterious picture of unknown intent.</p><p>This was one of the pages of Leymano’s Travels, and it recorded a particular Beyonder power.</p><p>It wasn’t a recorded power which Fors had gathered herself, but one of the five original pages when she received it.</p><p>Fors looked up, and she pretended to observe the transactions of the others while fully taking in the hooded lady’s situation.</p><p>She discovered that there was a mosquito with dark brown spots on a nearby wall and unknown worms that were slowly squirming on the ground.</p><p>Fors’s finger naturally slid across the yellowish-brown goatskin’s pattern as a complicated symbol quickly formed in her mind.</p><p>Silently and without showing any odd signs, she felt that she had “understood” the brown pattern, as her thoughts connected with the other party’s.</p><p>The brown-spotted mosquito flew at a low height.</p><p>It circled beneath the hooded lady and carefully clung to her front.</p><p>The mosquito’s vision was different from a human’s since an incomprehensible scene appeared in Fors’s mind. But it soon disintegrated and reformed into a rather normal scene.</p><p>The hooded lady had a rather curved outline with dark skin. Her brows were thin and the corners of her mouth drooped significantly.</p><p>Fors immediately recognized her. She was none other than the Primordial Moon believer, Windsor Behring, who Mr. Moon was searching for!</p><p><em>An effective clue is worth 100 pounds, and directly finding her means 500 pounds!</em> Fors recalled the reward as she immediately became flustered.</p><p>Her first reaction was to drive the mosquito to bite Windsor Behring and suck her blood. That way, she could later use astromancy to directly lock onto her location.</p><p>However, she gave up the idea after struggling for a moment. That was extremely taboo in a Beyonder gathering. If she were discovered, she would definitely be attacked by all the participants of the gathering.</p><p>And the host of the gathering often had significant strength. Going too overboard made it easily detectable!</p><p><em>Hmm, I’ll just get the 100 pounds. If there’s another chance, I’ll consider how to lock onto her directly… I have to leave this gathering early and smear my blood over Leymano’s Travels to prevent myself from getting lost. That would be dangerous…</em> Fors repressed her disappointment as she made her final decision.</p><p>In fact, her actions were already out of line; hence, she didn’t wish to stay another second longer.</p><p>…</p><p>Hillston Borough, inside a high-class hotel.</p><p>Klein stood behind an oriel window as he silently took in the crimson moon and thin clouds in the sky.</p><p>Some time later, he combed the white hair around his temples and reached out to draw the curtains.</p><p>Then, he went through the hassle of moving the radio transceiver back to the real world and spent the time “airing” out most of its “smell.”</p><p>This time, he only waited about ten seconds when he felt the room turn dark and eerie. He heard the radio transceiver begin to producing clicking sounds.</p><p>Klein approached and saw a piece of illusory paper spew out. On the paper were words composed of Loenese: “Great Master, please look right!”</p><p><em>Right…</em> Klein turned his head in amusement and curiosity to his side.</p><p>He saw a full-body mirror, which had already turned dark, as though it was smeared with a layer of ink.</p><p>Just as a thought flashed in his mind, the full-body mirror lit up. Illusory fireworks began shooting inside the mirror as it burst and scattered down in a beautiful and dazzling display.</p><p>Meanwhile, the full-body mirror produced a line of golden Loenese words.</p><p>“Welcome back, Great Master!”</p><p>At that moment, although Arrodes didn’t produce any sound, Klein had the baffling feeling that it was hysterically shouting.</p><p>As the fireworks came to an end, the golden text distorted and formed a new line of text:</p><p>“Great Master, your loyal and humble servant, Arrodes, wishes to ask you how I might be of service to you?”</p><p>Klein was already very accustomed to this as he said in a practiced manner, “Answer my questions.”</p><p>The golden line of text reformed again.</p><p>“Thank you for your answer. You may ask.”</p><p>Prepared, Klein said, “Where did the evil spirit in Williams Street go to?”</p><p>The full-body mirror’s golden text froze for a few seconds before they slowly disappeared. As for the blooming fireworks in the background, they first blurred before a new scene became clear.</p><p>It was that of an abandoned chapel where withered vines crawled over its walls, and gray stones were strewn everywhere.</p><p>Klein found it rather familiar. It was where he and Sharron had once conversed with the evil spirit.</p><p>The scene drew close as Klein saw that in a corner of the collapsed chapel was a tiny pit that wasn’t too deep. There were clear signs of it being dug up with one’s fingers.</p><p><em>Miss Magician mentioned it before…</em> As Klein’s thoughts surfaced, the scene produced a cold voice that hid a smile:</p><p>“It’s a pleasure working with you!”</p><p>As those words came out of the soil, the scene immediately turned distorted like a water surface being stirred before the scene completely shattered.</p><p><em>Pleasure working with you… Who did the evil spirit speak to?</em></p><p><em>To make an angel from the Hunter pathway use such a tone, the person opposite it mustn’t be someone of a lower level. That person might even be an angel. However, why would “He” use his hands to dig? “He” should have a much easier method that didn’t waste that much time…</em></p><p><em>The angel is also restricted in a certain sense? Hmm, just like that Grandpa in Leonard’s body? Right, Leonard was in Backlund back then! This is a clue, but there are other possibilities. Something at the level of an angel doesn’t equate to being an angel…</em></p><p><em>The evil spirit controlled Baronet Pound to contact someone? From the looks of it, the Intis and Feysac spies were just a smokescreen that was deliberately set up by the evil spirit. As expected of a Conspirer…</em> Thoughts ran through Klein’s mind as he said to Arrodes, “Second question: I have three butlers to choose from. Who do you think is the most suitable?”</p><p>Golden Loenese words appeared one after another:</p><p>“If you choose Rebach and Walter, there might be an additional development. Asnia is the most professional, but he’s also the most ordinary.”</p><p><em>Hmm… the two who were formerly under the service of Duke Negan and Viscount Conrad do allow for additional development…</em> Klein nodded in thought.</p><p>“It’s your turn to ask.”</p><p>At this moment, a bunch of golden text appeared:</p><p>“Great Master, what do you make of me being your butler? As long as you bring me out of the Church of Steam, I can become the best butler in the world!”</p><p>“…”</p><p>Klein hesitated for a second as he replied, mincing his words, “It’s not suitable at the moment.”</p><p>The golden text in the full-body mirror darked instantly before it lit up again, reforming the words:</p><p>“Alright.</p><p>“Your loyal and humble servant, Arrodes, will patiently await the day.”</p><p>Immediately following that, the full-body mirror produced a complicated picture with some footnotes.</p><p>“This is a rune formed with the corresponding symbols and magical labels. Great Master, as long as you are in Backlund, writing it on some paper is equivalent to summoning me.”</p><p><em>A mixture of secrecy and mystery prying symbols…</em> Klein identified the rune and said, “Okay.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
