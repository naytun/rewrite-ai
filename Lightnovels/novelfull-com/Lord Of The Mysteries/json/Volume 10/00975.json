This will bring about negative impacts to matters that he’s trying to push for or object to… Floating in the mind world, Audrey looked down at her island of consciousness, her thoughts were so calm that it surprised her.</p><p>Right on the heels of that, she suddenly realized why Hvin Rambis had directed Cuarón’s suicide.</p><p>Audrey had always been concerned about this matter. Furthermore, she had obtained information from various sources, giving her a rather clear idea of the overall picture. However, she had ultimately been stumped about the mastermind’s goal.</p><p>This trap seemed to be targeted at the purse strings of the Conservative Party, Baron Syndras. As long as he failed to respond properly, this powerful banker would have his problems exposed and end up handled by the official Beyonder organizations. However, the actual process seemed to lack the panache of a High-Sequence Beyonder of the Spectator pathway. It was especially so when Dwayne Dantès reacted unexpectedly, causing the plan to immediately be foiled; yet, there wasn’t any mending of the plan.</p><p>As a rather senior Spectator, Audrey had long noticed the incongruity within this matter. However, it was only after hearing Hvin Rambis’s words today that she realized the core of the matter.</p><p>Hvin Rambis didn’t care if he had successfully taken down Baron Syndras, as he had already accomplished his goals.</p><p>It was just as he had said, the New Party and Conservative Party were fractured!</p><p>Although Hvin Rambis claimed to be trying to mend it, his true goal was to deepen the cracks and cause them to completely fall out with each other!</p><p>Why is he doing this? Audrey controlled her mind island and didn’t make it show any puzzled emotions.</p><p>She then replied to Hvin Rambis, “I can understand your concern for the kingdom’s political situation. I will work hard on this.”</p><p>Just as she said that, the gloomy Hvin Rambis on the mind island lowered his right hand from his forehead. Hvin Rambis, who was sitting on a sofa in the real world, said with a gladdened smile, “You are indeed a young noble lady filled with compassion.”</p><p>With that said, the old gentleman lowered his right leg which was covered by grayish-blue trousers with lined patterns. He leaned forward slightly as his eyes grew darker.</p><p>“Due to your identity and daily environment, you shall forget about me. You will only remember Hilbert, Stephen, and Escalante. You will pass any information through them…</p><p>“When there are extremely pressing issues that need reporting, you will subconsciously visit me with the excuse of consulting me on some academic question… When you enter my room, your lost memories will recover…”</p><p>As Hvin Rambis said those words, the him on Audrey’s mind island opened his mouth and repeated the words. A “rock” took form and quickly plunged into the ground, sinking into the subconscious.</p><p>At that moment, Audrey felt as though she had dissociated into two entities.</p><p>One was a result of a mind island-she could no longer remember the appearance or name of the elder in front of her. She only knew that she had come to Stephen Hampres’s residence and met a Psychology Alchemists councilor where she received the approbation of the “acting method” and received a new mission.</p><p>Another her floated beneath the spirituality sky, acutely aware of everything that had happened. However, there wasn’t much emotional changes. It was more optimistic than gloomy.</p><p>Audrey was certain that the one in midair was her true self-conscious. Therefore, she didn’t feel confounded. With “her” as the true self, she controlled her other self and got up in a muddle.</p><p>“Yes, Sir.”</p><p>After answering him, she rapidly straightened her body, and like a puppet who was being controlled by invisible strings, she walked to the door and left.</p><p>At the instant she closed the door, the her in the mind world’s sky and the her corresponding to the island of consciousness fused as one. There were no longer any differences.</p><p>The two entities with certain memory discrepancies instantly fused together, giving Audrey a few seconds of confusion. However, with plenty of experience in treating people and hypnotizing others, she very quickly and skillfully identified the differences. She then reconstructed every detail from before.</p><p>What powerful mind-reading and hypnosis… He directly entered my Body of Heart and Mind and even my Soul Body to exert influence via the sea of collective subconscious… Although Audrey had the blessings of The Fool’s angel, she felt that her recollections were like viewing old photographs. They were yellowed and faded, as though they were matters that happened years ago.</p><p>I’ll be able to do the same in the future! The blessings of Mr. Fool’s angel is really impressive! Humph, I’ll only inform you of Father’s take on unimportant matters! As Audrey’s mind whirled, her mood turned for the better.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The steam locomotive that spewed out copious amounts of smoke dragged its carriages as it chugged into Backlund.</p><p>After traveling for days, Klein had finally returned to this Capital of Capitals.</p><p>As Dwayne Dantès, Klein wore a top hat and a formal suit while holding a gold inlaid cane. He slowly left the first-class cabin and firmly stood on the platform.</p><p>Behind him was a man with mixed-blood. He was about 1.75 meters tall, and he carried two luggage bags. He was none other than the marionette, Enzo. Of course, this Winner had already changed his name to Enuni, which sounded more in line with the Southern Continent’s traditions. In the future, he would be the go-to person to establish contact with the Southern Continent’s clientèle for the upstart tycoon and arms dealer, Dwayne Dantès. The non-crucial business would be handled by him, without needing Dwayne Dantès to personally head to East and West Balam.</p><p>Of course, this was simply a disguise. In fact, Klein would be the one making the trip.</p><p>He had decided to send believers to West Balam in the name of Sea God Kalvetua and get them to represent himself to complete some small-scale deals. After all, Danitz was an infamous pirate over the Five Seas, with a bounty exceeding ten thousand pounds. Furthermore, he had close ties with Gehrman Sparrow, and it easily incurred suspicion if he kept helping Dwayne Dantès.</p><p>After leaving the station, Klein rode a carriage and returned to 160 Böklund Street.</p><p>It was already dark by then. The street lamps on both sides of the street had already lit up, likewise for Dwayne Dantès’s residence. Butler Walter and Housekeeper Taneja led the male and female servants, as well as the gardener and coachmen, out. They stood on both sides to welcome their employer back.</p><p>After he arrived in Desi Bay and bought the train tickets, Klein had sent a telegram back to Backlund, informing his butler when he was returning. However, he had instructed him not to send the coachman to pick him up at the station. After all, this was an era when steam locomotives were often delayed. It wasn’t impossible that its arrival would be delayed to the next morning.</p><p>Glancing at his servants who stood with a standard, reverent pose, Klein secretly nodded and passed through them as he sighed inwardly.</p><p>This does resemble the style of nobility. Even when the employer isn’t around, the butler doesn’t skive… When he arrived at the door, he nodded gently at Walter and Taneja before saying, “It must’ve been hard on you while I was away.”</p><p>“It’s our duty,” Walter and Taneja said with a bow.</p><p>Klein then turned his gaze to his valet, Richardson. He realized that this good-looking mixed-blood had a somewhat pale expression as he kept stealing glances at his employer’s new valet, Enuni.</p><p>Klein smirked inwardly as he nodded at him.</p><p>“You did well. However, there’s some business involving the Southern Continent that requires Enuni to handle it.</p><p>“Oh yes, be Mr. Walter’s assistant and help him in gathering information for a manor outside the city.”</p><p>Assistant… Assistant butler… Richardson was first taken aback before he replied in pleasant surprise, “Yes, Sir!”</p><p>With this role, it meant that he had broken free from the constraints of being a valet. He had been promoted!</p><p>Walter didn’t ask about the manor in detail as he seriously arranged for his employer’s settling in, bath, and meals.</p><p>After all of this was done, he and Enuni sent Dwayne Dantès back to the third story before he asked, “Sir, do you plan on buying a manor in the suburbs of Backlund? What requirements do you have?”</p><p>Something not too expensive… Who knows how long I can use this identity for… Klein inwardly gave a self-deprecating comment before deliberating.</p><p>“One with a vineyard and brewery.”</p><p>After completing the arms deal, he had already established himself in Backlund’s high society and had earned a huge sum of money. Therefore, it was necessary for him to own a manor. He couldn’t afford to not be capable of inviting his friends on a vacation and hunt in the suburbs when autumn and winter came. This was a faux pas that could easily make him be viewed with scorn.</p><p>Furthermore, the manors in Backlund’s suburbs were rather expensive. One could purchase a huge manor with rubber trees in places like Desi Bay for eight to ten thousand pounds, but here, all he wanted was a vineyard and grain farm, with facilities like a brewery.</p><p>“I will gather the information as soon as possible,” Walter replied respectfully.</p><p>He knew his employer was exhausted from his traveling, so after briefly informing him of the recent developments, he left the third story and busied himself on other matters. With the new valet’s help, Klein changed his clothes and washed up.</p><p>During this process, Klein, who had gotten accustomed to his godhood, couldn’t help but lampoon.</p><p>If it wasn’t because a marionette cannot be more than a thousand meters from me, would I have changed valets… Despite being a tycoon, I still have to serve myself… Sigh!</p><p>Amidst his sighs, he dismissed Winner Enuni to the adjoining room and walked to the window. He looked at the lamp-lit Backlund, which resembled stars, as he allowed his thoughts to wander.</p><p>Next, my goal is MI9’s deputy director, Brigadier General Qonas Kilgor…</p><p>As for the captain of the royal guards, Viscount Stratford, I can leave him to the Demoness, Trissy… She has vanished for quite some time. I wonder what he has been busy with. I wonder if she has come up with a way to approach that viscount… I had previously informed her that I have other matters to tend to and wasn’t free via the method she gave me. I’ll later have to confirm that I’m free now and can continue our previous cooperation effort…</p><p>After a while, Klein reined in his thoughts and got into bed. Without the help of Cogitation, he fell deep asleep.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, he suddenly opened his eyes and sensed that someone had entered 160 Böklund Street!</p><p>Here it comes again… Klein couldn’t help but raise his hand to rub his temples.</p><p>On the first day of returning to Backlund, he had been awakened in the middle of the night.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
