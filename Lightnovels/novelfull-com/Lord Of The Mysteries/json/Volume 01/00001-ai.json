  "body": "<p>Pain. Intense, unrelenting pain.</p>\n<p>Zhou Mingrui's head throbbed with a sharp, piercing agony, as if a relentless force was driving a spike through his temples. It was a sensation so vivid that it shattered the vibrant dreamscape he had been lost in. In his half-conscious state, he tried to move, to sit up, but his body refused to respond, as if he were trapped in a dream.</p>\n<p>Am I still dreaming? Zhou Mingrui wondered, familiar with such experiences. He tried to focus, to break free from the darkness and confusion that held him captive. Yet, his thoughts were elusive, like mist slipping through his fingers. Random musings flitted through his mind, beyond his control.</p>\n<p>Why this sudden, excruciating headache? Could it be something serious, like a cerebral hemorrhage? Am I going to die young? I need to wake up!</p>\n<p>Gradually, the pain lessened, though it still felt like a dull blade was slicing through his brain. Sleep was impossible now. How would he manage work tomorrow? But then again, perhaps this was a chance to take a break from his manager's complaints.</p>\n<p>As the throbbing subsided, Zhou Mingrui slowly regained some strength. He managed to move his back and open his eyes, finally escaping the dream's hold.</p>\n<p>His vision was initially blurred, then tinged with a faint crimson hue. Before him was a sturdy wooden desk, an open notebook with coarse, yellowed pages at its center. Strange, dark letters were scrawled across the title. To the left, a stack of books was neatly arranged, while grayish-white pipes ran along the wall to the right, connected to a Western-style lamp.</p>\n<p>The lamp, half the size of an adult's head, had a transparent glass interior and a black metal grid exterior. Beneath it, an ink bottle glowed with a pale red light, its surface embossed with a blurry angel pattern. Next to it lay a dark pen and a brass revolver.</p>\n<p>A revolver? Zhou Mingrui was bewildered. This was not his room. Everything was unfamiliar, shrouded in a crimson veil from the window's light.</p>\n<p>He looked up, his gaze drawn to the sky. A crimson moon hung silently against a backdrop of black velvet.</p>\n<p>This... Zhou Mingrui felt a surge of horror. He stood abruptly, but the pain in his head flared, causing him to collapse back into the chair.</p>\n<p>Ignoring the pain, he stood again, taking in his surroundings. The room was small, with a brown door on each side. A low wooden bed was against the opposite wall, with a cabinet nearby. The cabinet's doors were open, revealing five drawers beneath.</p>\n<p>A strange mechanical device with exposed gears and bearings was connected to the wall's grayish-white pipe. In the room's corner, near the table, were items resembling coal stoves and various kitchen utensils.</p>\n<p>Across from the right door was a cracked dressing mirror. Zhou Mingrui caught sight of himselfâ€”black hair, brown eyes, a linen shirt, and an average build.</p>\n<p>This... Could I have transmigrated? Zhou Mingrui's mind raced. He had often fantasized about such scenarios while reading web novels, but now, faced with the reality, he struggled to accept it.</p>\n<p>Calm down, calm down... He took deep breaths, trying to steady himself. As he did, memories began to surface.</p>\n<p>Klein Moretti, a citizen of the Northern Continent's Loen Kingdom, Tingen City. A recent history graduate from Khoy University. His father, a sergeant, had died in a colonial conflict, and his mother, a devotee of the Evernight Goddess, had passed away years ago. He had an elder brother and a younger sister, and they lived in a modest apartment.</p>\n<p>Klein's family was not wealthy, relying on his brother's clerk job at an import-export company. As a history graduate, Klein knew ancient languages, including the Hermes language used in rituals.</p>\n<p>Hermes language? Zhou Mingrui's curiosity piqued. He looked at the notebook again, the text shifting from strange to familiar, becoming readable.</p>\n<p>\"Everyone will die, including me.\"</p>\n<p>The words sent a chill through him. He recoiled, nearly falling, but caught himself on the table. The air felt charged, like the eerie stories told by elders.</p>\n<p>He shook his head, dismissing it as an illusion. His gaze shifted to the brass revolver. How could Klein's family afford such a thing?</p>\n<p>Lost in thought, he noticed a red handprint on the table, deeper than the moonlight. A bloody handprint.</p>\n<p>He flipped his right hand, seeing it stained with blood. The pain in his head persisted, though less intense.</p>\n<p>Did I injure my head? Zhou Mingrui wondered, moving toward the mirror.</p>\n<p>A few steps later, he saw his reflection clearly. Black hair, brown eyes, a scholarly air.</p>\n<p>Is this me now? Klein Moretti?</p>\n<p>He moved closer, examining his forehead. In the mirror's dim light, he saw a grotesque wound with burn marks, blood staining the area, and grayish-white brain matter slowly oozing.</p>\n<p>The sight was both shocking and surreal, confirming the reality of his situation.</p>",
