  "body": "<p>Pain. Intense, unrelenting pain.</p>\n<p>Zhou Mingrui's head throbbed with an agony that felt like a relentless assault, as if a sharp object had pierced through his temples and twisted mercilessly. In his sleep, he struggled to move, to escape the confines of this tormenting dream, but his limbs refused to obey, leaving him trapped in a state of paralysis.</p>\n<p>Am I still dreaming? Zhou Mingrui wondered, familiar with such surreal experiences. He fought to focus, to break free from the darkness that ensnared him, but his thoughts were elusive, slipping away like mist.</p>\n<p>Why this sudden, excruciating headache? Could it be a cerebral hemorrhage? The fear of dying young gripped him, urging him to wake up. Yet, the pain persisted, dulling slightly but still gnawing at his consciousness like a blunt knife.</p>\n<p>Sleep was impossible. How could he face work tomorrow with this genuine headache? But then, perhaps a day off wasn't so bad. A small consolation amidst the suffering.</p>\n<p>Gradually, Zhou Mingrui gathered enough strength to move, to open his eyes. His vision blurred, then cleared, revealing a study desk made of sturdy wood. An open notebook lay before him, its yellowed pages inscribed with strange, black letters. To the left, a stack of books, and to the right, a wall with grayish-white pipes and a Western-style lamp.</p>\n<p>Beneath the lamp, a black ink bottle glowed faintly, its surface embossed with an angelic pattern. Nearby, a dark pen and a brass revolver rested ominously.</p>\n<p>A revolver? Zhou Mingrui was bewildered. This wasn't his room. The desk, the notebook, the ink bottle, and the revolver were all unfamiliar, bathed in a crimson light from the window.</p>\n<p>He looked up, his gaze drawn to a crimson moon hanging in the sky, casting its eerie glow.</p>\n<p>Horrified, Zhou Mingrui stood abruptly, but the pain in his head surged, causing him to collapse back into the chair. He rose again, determined to understand his surroundings.</p>\n<p>The room was small, with a brown door on each side. A low wooden bed stood against the opposite wall, and a cabinet with open doors and drawers sat nearby. A strange mechanical device with exposed gears was connected to the wall.</p>\n<p>In the corner, kitchen utensils and a coal stove were neatly arranged. Across the room, a cracked dressing mirror reflected his image.</p>\n<p>Black hair, brown eyes, a linen shirt—Zhou Mingrui's reflection was unfamiliar. The revolver, the crimson moon, the alien surroundings—they all pointed to one possibility.</p>\n<p>Could I have transmigrated? Zhou Mingrui's mind raced with disbelief. He had read about such scenarios in novels, but experiencing it was another matter entirely.</p>\n<p>Calm down, he told himself, taking deep breaths. As he steadied his mind, memories began to surface.</p>\n<p>Klein Moretti, a citizen of the Loen Kingdom, Tingen City. A recent history graduate from Khoy University. His father, a fallen sergeant, and his mother, a devotee of the Evernight Goddess, were both gone. He had an elder brother and a younger sister, and they lived modestly.</p>\n<p>Klein's knowledge of ancient languages, including the Hermes language, stirred something within Zhou Mingrui. He glanced at the notebook on the desk, the text transforming from strange to familiar.</p>\n<p>\"Everyone will die, including me.\"</p>\n<p>The words sent a chill down his spine. He recoiled, nearly losing his balance, but steadied himself by gripping the table. The air seemed to hum with faint whispers, reminiscent of ghost stories from his childhood.</p>\n<p>He shook his head, dismissing the illusion, and focused on the revolver. How could Klein's family afford such a weapon?</p>\n<p>Deep in thought, Zhou Mingrui noticed a red handprint on the table, darker than the moonlight. A bloody handprint.</p>\n<p>He examined his own hand, finding it stained with blood. The throbbing in his head continued, though less intense.</p>\n<p>Did I injure my head? He wondered, moving toward the mirror.</p>\n<p>In the reflection, he saw a scholarly figure with black hair and brown eyes. Was this Klein Moretti?</p>\n<p>Zhou Mingrui leaned closer, inspecting his forehead. A grotesque wound marred his temple, surrounded by burn marks and stained with blood. Grayish-white brain matter oozed slowly from the injury.</p>",
