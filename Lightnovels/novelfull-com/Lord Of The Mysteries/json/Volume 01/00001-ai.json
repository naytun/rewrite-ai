  "body": "<p>Zhou Mingrui awoke to a world of intense pain, feeling as though his head was being pierced and twisted by a sharp object. Despite his efforts to move, he found himself paralyzed, trapped in a dreamlike state. As he struggled to regain control, random thoughts flooded his mind, including fears of a cerebral hemorrhage and the inconvenience of missing work.</p>\n<p>Gradually, he managed to open his eyes, revealing a study desk in front of him, illuminated by a crimson moon. The room was filled with unfamiliar objects, including a revolver and a notebook with text in the ancient Hermes language. Zhou Mingrui realized he might have transmigrated into another world, a concept he had only encountered in web novels.</p>\n<p>As he calmed himself, memories of Klein Moretti, a history graduate from the Loen Kingdom, flooded his mind. Klein's family background and knowledge of ancient languages became clear to Zhou Mingrui. However, the sight of a bloody handprint and the throbbing pain in his head suggested something sinister had occurred.</p>\n<p>Examining his reflection in a cracked mirror, Zhou Mingrui saw the wound on his temple, confirming his suspicions. He was now Klein Moretti, and the reality of his situation began to sink in.</p>",
