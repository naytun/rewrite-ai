  "body": "<p>Zhou Mingrui staggered back, his heart racing as he confronted the reflection in the dressing mirror. The figure staring back at him was not his own but that of a ghastly, desiccated corpse. How could someone so gravely wounded still be alive?</p>\n<p>He turned his head in disbelief, glancing at the other side. Despite the distance and dim lighting, he could still make out the penetrating wound and dark red blood stains marring his skin.</p>\n<p>“This…”</p>\n<p>Zhou Mingrui inhaled deeply, trying to steady his fraying nerves.</p>\n<p>He pressed his left hand against his chest, feeling the rapid thrum of his heart, a testament to his vitality. His skin, though slightly cold, radiated warmth beneath his touch.</p>\n<p>Squatting down, he verified that his knees could bend without issue. Rising to his feet, he took a moment to collect himself.</p>\n<p>“What’s happening?” he murmured, frowning as he contemplated the severity of his head injury.</p>\n<p>He took a couple of steps forward but halted abruptly. The moonlight filtering through the sanguine moon was too dim for a thorough inspection.</p>\n<p>A fragment of memory flickered in his mind as he turned to the grayish-white pipes and the metallic-gridded lamp mounted on the wall beside the study desk.</p>\n<p>This was a common gas lamp of the era, known for its stable flame and excellent illumination. Given Klein Moretti’s family circumstances, even a kerosene lamp would have been a luxury, let alone a gas lamp. Candles were the norm for their standing. However, four years ago, when he burned the midnight oil to gain admission to Khoy University, his elder brother, Benson, had insisted on creating a conducive study environment, even if it meant incurring debt.</p>\n<p>Benson, who had worked for several years and was quite resourceful, had convinced the landlord to install gas pipes, arguing it would enhance the apartment's rental value. The landlord, persuaded, provided the funds for the modifications. With Benson’s connections at an import-export company, he managed to procure a nearly cost-price gas lamp. Ultimately, he only needed to use his savings, avoiding further loans.</p>\n<p>As this memory flashed through his mind, Zhou Mingrui approached the desk, turning the valve of the gas pipe and twisting the switch of the lamp.</p>\n<p>With a sputtering sound, the lamp failed to ignite as he had hoped.</p>\n<p>He twisted the switch again, but the lamp continued to sputter, remaining dark.</p>\n<p>“Hmm…” Zhou Mingrui retracted his hand, pressing his left temple as he rifled through his memories.</p>\n<p>After a few seconds, he turned and walked toward the machine installation inset into the wall, connected to the grayish-white pipes.</p>\n<p>This was a gas meter!</p>\n<p>Upon seeing the exposed gears and bearings, Zhou Mingrui retrieved a coin from his trousers.</p>\n<p>The coin was dark yellow with a bronze sheen, featuring a crowned man on one side and a clump of wheat with a ‘1’ on the reverse.</p>\n<p>He recognized it as the basic currency of the Loen Kingdom, known as a copper penny. Its purchasing power was roughly equivalent to three or four yuan before his transmigration. The currency system included denominations like five pence, halfpence, and quarterpence, but these were not small enough for everyday transactions, often requiring multiple coins for a single purchase.</p>\n<p>After flipping the coin a few times, Zhou Mingrui inserted it into the gas meter’s thin vertical slot.</p>\n<p>Clink! Clang!</p>\n<p>As the penny fell to the bottom, the sound of grinding gears echoed, producing a short, melodious mechanical rhythm.</p>\n<p>Zhou Mingrui stared at the meter for a moment before returning to the wooden desk. He twisted the gas lamp’s switch again.</p>\n<p>After sputtering, a sharp sound erupted!</p>\n<p>A plume of fire ignited, rapidly expanding. The bright light first filled the interior of the wall lamp before illuminating the transparent glass, flooding the room with a warm glow.</p>\n<p>The darkness receded as the crimson light retreated from the window. Zhou Mingrui felt an inexplicable sense of comfort as he moved closer to the dressing mirror.</p>\n<p>This time, he inspected his temple closely, not missing a single detail.</p>\n<p>After several rounds of scrutiny, he realized that aside from the original blood stains, no fresh blood flowed from the grotesque wound. It appeared to have received excellent hemostasis and bandaging. The slowly squirming grayish-white brain and the discernible growth of flesh around the wound suggested that it might take thirty to forty minutes, or even two to three hours, before it would only leave a light scar.</p>\n<p>“The restorative effects of transmigration?” Zhou Mingrui mused, curling the right corner of his mouth.</p>\n<p>Letting out a long sigh, he felt grateful to be alive.</p>\n<p>After calming his thoughts, he opened a drawer and retrieved a small piece of soap. Grabbing an old, tattered towel hanging by the cupboard, he headed to the communal bathroom shared by the tenants on the second floor.</p>\n<p>I need to clean the blood stains from my head; I can scare myself, but I can’t frighten my sister, Melissa, when she wakes up tomorrow morning!</p>\n<p>The corridor outside was pitch black, with shadows barely illuminated by the crimson moonlight streaming through the window at the end. They resembled a pair of monstrous eyes silently observing the living late into the night.</p>\n<p>Zhou Mingrui lightened his footsteps as he made his way to the communal bathroom, a shudder of fear coursing through him.</p>\n<p>Upon entering, the moonlight illuminated everything clearly. He stood before a wash basin and turned the tap’s knob.</p>\n<p>As he heard the gushing sound of water, he suddenly recalled his landlord, Mr. Franky.</p>\n<p>Since water was included in the rent, this short, thin gentleman, always adorned in a top hat, vest, and black suit, would actively inspect the bathroom for any sounds of flowing water.</p>\n<p>If the water gushed too loudly, Mr. Franky would abandon all gentlemanly traits, flailing his walking stick and striking the bathroom door, shouting phrases like “Darn thief,” “Wastage is a shameless matter,” “I’ll remember you,” and “If I see this happen again, scram with your filthy luggage!” He would then add, “Mark my words, this is the most value-for-money apartment in Tingen City. You won’t find a kinder landlord anywhere else!”</p>\n<p>Putting those thoughts aside, Zhou Mingrui used a damp towel to wipe the blood stains from his face repeatedly.</p>\n<p>After checking himself in the rundown bathroom mirror and confirming that only a hideous wound and a pale face remained, he relaxed. He then took off his linen shirt and used a bar of soap to wash away the blood.</p>\n<p>At that moment, he furrowed his brows, recalling a potential issue.</p>\n<p>The wound was too exaggerated, and there was too much blood. Aside from his body, his room likely still bore signs of his injury!</p>\n<p>After finishing with his linen shirt a few minutes later, Zhou Mingrui hurried back to his apartment with the damp towel. He wiped the blood handprint from the desk and, using the gas lamp’s light, searched for any missed spots.</p>\n<p>He quickly discovered a significant amount of blood splattered on the floor beneath the desk, along with a yellow bullet lodged in the left side of the wall.</p>\n<p>“Releasing a round with a revolver pointed at the temple?” Piecing together the clues, Zhou Mingrui began to form a rough idea of how Klein had died.</p>\n<p>He was in no rush to verify his suspicions. Instead, he meticulously wiped away the blood stains and cleaned up the ‘scene.’ Afterward, he took the bullet and returned to his desk, opening the revolver’s cylinder to inspect its contents.</p>\n<p>A total of five rounds and a cartridge shell gleamed with a brass luster.</p>\n<p>“Indeed…” Zhou Mingrui observed the empty cartridge shell before stuffing the rounds back into the cylinder, nodding in affirmation.</p>\n<p>His gaze shifted to the notebook, where the words ‘Everyone will die, including me’ caught his attention, igniting even more questions in his mind.</p>\n<p>Where did the gun come from?</p>\n<p>Was it a suicide or a staged suicide?</p>\n<p>What kind of trouble could a history graduate of humble origins have gotten himself into?</p>\n<p>Why would such a suicide method leave behind so little blood? Was it because I transmigrated in time and received healing benefits?</p>\n<p>After pondering for a moment, Zhou Mingrui changed into another linen shirt. He sat down in the chair, contemplating more pressing matters.</p>\n<p>Klein’s experience was not his immediate concern. The true issue was to understand the reason for his transmigration and whether he could return!</p>\n<p>His parents, relatives, best friends, and the captivating world of the Internet, along with all sorts of delicious delicacies… These were the reasons fueling his desire to return!</p>\n<p>Click. Click. Click… Zhou Mingrui’s right hand subconsciously pulled out the revolver’s cylinder and slammed it back into place repeatedly.</p>\n<p>Yes, there hasn’t been much difference between this time and the past. I was just a little unlucky, but why would I transmigrate for no apparent reason?</p>\n<p>Bad luck… Yes, I tried a luck enhancement ritual before dinner today!</p>\n<p>A thought flashed through Zhou Mingrui’s mind, illuminating memories obscured by a fog of confusion.</p>\n<p>As a self-proclaimed expert in various fields—politics, history, economics, biology, and folklore—he had always considered himself ‘knowledgeable about everything.’ Of course, his best friend often mocked him for ‘only knowing a little about everything.’</p>\n<p>One of those fields was Chinese Divination.</p>\n<p>Last year, while visiting his hometown, he stumbled upon a thread-bound book titled ‘Quintessential Divination and Arcane Arts of the Qin and Han Dynasty’ at an old bookstore. It piqued his interest, and he purchased it, hoping it would help him posture online. Unfortunately, his interest waned quickly; the vertical script made reading a chore, and he tossed it aside after flipping through the first few pages.</p>\n<p>In the past month, he had experienced a string of bad luck—losing his cell phone, customers running off after cheating him, and making mistakes at work. It was only then that he recalled the luck enhancement ritual mentioned at the beginning of ‘Quintessential Divination and Arcane Arts.’ The requirements were simple, with no foundational prerequisites.</p>\n<p>All he needed to do was gather four portions of staple food from his area and place them in the four corners of his room. They could be set on furniture like tables and cupboards. Then, standing in the center of the room, he had to take four counter-clockwise steps, chanting specific phrases at each step. After completing the steps, he needed to close his eyes and wait five minutes in his original spot for the ritual to be considered complete.</p>\n<p>Since it cost him nothing, he followed the book’s instructions before dinner. However, nothing happened at the time.</p>\n<p>Who would have guessed that he would actually transmigrate in the middle of the night?</p>\n<p>Transmigration!</p>\n<p>“There’s a distinct possibility that it’s due to that luck enhancement ritual… Yes, I should give it a try here tomorrow. If it’s really because of that, I stand a chance of returning!” Zhou Mingrui sat up straight, a newfound determination igniting within him.</p>\n<p>Regardless, he had to give it a shot!</p>\n<p>He had to attempt a Hail Mary!</p>",
