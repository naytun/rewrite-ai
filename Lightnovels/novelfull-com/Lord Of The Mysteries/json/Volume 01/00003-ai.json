  "body": "<p>After confirming his plan, Zhou Mingrui felt a sudden relief wash over him. His fear and unease faded into the corners of his mind.</p>\n<p>With a newfound focus, he began to study Klein’s fragmented memories. He stood up, turning off the pipe’s valve, and watched as the wall lamp dimmed until its flame extinguished. Sitting back down, he absentmindedly fiddled with the revolver’s brass cylinder, pressing the side of his head as he recalled his memories in the crimson darkness, like an attentive viewer in a movie theater.</p>\n<p>Klein’s memories were shattered, much like broken glass. They were not only disjointed but also had significant gaps. He couldn’t remember how he came to possess the exquisite revolver, whether he had taken his own life or been killed, or the meaning behind the words “Everyone will die, including me” scrawled in a notebook. He struggled to recall any odd events from two days before the incident.</p>\n<p>These memories were not just fragmented; they were incomplete. Zhou Mingrui realized that if Klein returned to university, graduation would be unlikely. He had left campus just days ago, without a moment of relaxation.</p>\n<p>He needed to prepare for the Tingen University’s History department interview in two days. Graduates from the Loen Kingdom typically didn’t stay at their alma mater. His mentor had provided him with a recommendation letter for both Tingen University and Backlund University.</p>\n<p>Through the window, Zhou Mingrui observed the red moon setting in the west. The moon sank lower, and soon, faint light glowed from the east, painting the horizon in gold.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, he heard a commotion in the apartment. Footsteps approached his door.</p>\n<p>“Melissa is awake… She’s as punctual as ever,” Zhou Mingrui smiled. Klein’s memories made him feel as if Melissa were truly his younger sister.</p>\n<p>But I don’t have a younger sister, he reminded himself.</p>\n<p>Melissa was different from Benson and Klein. She hadn’t completed her rudimentary education at the Sunday school of the Church of the Evernight Goddess. When she reached school age, the Loen Kingdom enacted the ‘Basic Education Law.’ A Primary and Secondary Education Committee was formed, funded to enhance the kingdom’s educational investment.</p>\n<p>In less than three years, many public primary schools were established, incorporating numerous church schools while maintaining religious neutrality. This was to avoid entangling education in the conflicts between the Lord of Storms, the Evernight Goddess, and the God of Steam and Machinery.</p>\n<p>Public primary school fees were three pence a week, which seemed expensive compared to Sunday school’s copper penny. However, the latter only provided education once a week, while the former offered six days of classes. In essence, the cost was almost negligible.</p>\n<p>Melissa stood out from most girls. From a young age, she had a fascination with gears, springs, and bearings. Her dream was to become a steam mechanic.</p>\n<p>Benson, aware of the importance of education, supported his sister’s ambitions just as he did Klein’s university education. After all, Tingen Technical School was only secondary education. There was no need for her to attend language school or public school for further knowledge.</p>\n<p>Last July, fifteen-year-old Melissa passed her entrance exams and achieved her dream of attending Tingen Technical School’s Steam and Machinery department. Her weekly school fees increased to nine pence.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Benson’s company suffered due to the situation in the Southern Continent. Profits and business transactions plummeted, leading to the retrenchment of over a third of employees. To keep his job and support their livelihood, Benson had to take on more demanding tasks, often working overtime or in harsh conditions.</p>\n<p>Klein had thought about helping his brother but felt inadequate, having been born a commoner and admitted to an average language school. He struggled to keep up in university, often staying up late and waking early to catch up, ultimately graduating with average results.</p>\n<p>Zhou Mingrui’s thoughts of his brother and sister lingered until he turned the doorknob. Suddenly, he jolted awake, realizing he held a revolver.</p>\n<p>This is a semi-regulated item! It could scare children! And I still have a wound on my head!</p>\n<p>With Melissa arriving any moment, he pressed his temple and quickly opened a desk drawer, tossing the revolver inside before slamming it shut.</p>\n<p>“What happened?” Melissa asked, her curiosity piqued by the noise.</p>\n<p>She was still youthful. Though lacking nutritious food made her face thin and slightly pale, her skin glowed with the vibrancy of youth.</p>\n<p>Zhou Mingrui forced a composed expression as he met her brown eyes. He picked up an item beside him, calmly closing the drawer to hide the revolver. He touched his temple, relieved to find his wound had healed.</p>\n<p>He took out a silver vine-leaf pocket watch and pressed the top gently, causing the cover to flip open.</p>\n<p>Inside was a picture of their father, the most valuable item left behind by the Royal Army sergeant. Though it was second-hand and often malfunctioned, it had embarrassed Benson, who had once used it to elevate his status.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Melissa had a knack for machinery. After learning the principles behind the watch, she borrowed tools from her Technical School and claimed to have fixed it recently.</p>\n<p>Zhou Mingrui looked at the watch’s open cover, noticing the second hand was still. He instinctively twisted the top dial to wind it.</p>\n<p>Despite winding it several times, he heard no sound of taut springs. The second hand remained motionless.</p>\n<p>“It looks like it’s broken again,” he said, glancing at his sister, searching for a topic to discuss.</p>\n<p>Melissa shot him an expressionless glance and briskly walked over to take the pocket watch from him.</p>\n<p>Standing still, she pulled up the button on the pocket watch. With a few simple turns, the second hand began to tick.</p>\n<p>Isn’t pulling the button up usually meant to adjust the time? Zhou Mingrui’s expression turned blank.</p>\n<p>At that moment, a distant bell chimed from a cathedral, echoing six times, ethereal and haunting.</p>\n<p>Melissa tilted her head, listening, then pulled the button up again. She turned it to synchronize the time.</p>\n<p>“It’s okay now,” she said, her voice flat. She pressed the top button back and handed the pocket watch to Zhou Mingrui.</p>\n<p>He smiled politely, feeling embarrassed.</p>\n<p>Melissa gave him a piercing stare before heading to the cupboard. She grabbed her toiletries and towel, then opened the door to leave for the public bathroom.</p>\n<p>Why did her expression seem filled with disparagement and resignation? Was it love and concern for a brother who seemed slow?</p>\n<p>Zhou Mingrui chuckled softly, lowering his head. He closed the pocket watch’s cover with a click, then opened it again.</p>\n<p>He repeated the action, his thoughts drifting to a troubling question.</p>\n<p>Klein committed suicide without a silencer. I’ll consider it suicide for now. It must have caused quite a stir, yet Melissa, just a wall away, didn’t notice at all.</p>\n<p>Was she sleeping too soundly? Or was Klein’s suicide shrouded in mystery?</p>\n<p>Click! The pocket watch opened. Clack! It closed again… Melissa returned from washing up, noticing her brother’s subconscious act of opening and closing the pocket watch.</p>\n<p>Her gaze was once again glazed with exasperation as she said sweetly, “Klein, take out all the remaining bread. Remember to buy fresh ones today. There’s meat and peas too. Your interview is soon. I’ll make you mutton stewed with peas.”</p>\n<p>As she spoke, she moved a stove from the corner and boiled a pot of hot water with some charcoal.</p>\n<p>Before the water boiled, she opened the lowest cupboard drawer and retrieved a can of inferior tea leaves, tossing about ten leaves into the pot, pretending it was real tea.</p>\n<p>Melissa poured two big cups of tea and shared two pieces of rye bread with Zhou Mingrui.</p>\n<p>There was no sawdust or excessive gluten mixed in, but it was unappetizing. Zhou Mingrui felt weak and starving, forcing himself to swallow the bread with the tea while inwardly complaining.</p>\n<p>Melissa finished eating a few minutes later. After adjusting her black hair that reached her vest, she looked at Zhou Mingrui and said, “Remember to buy fresh bread. We only need eight pounds. The weather is hot, so the bread will spoil easily. Also, buy the mutton and peas. Don’t forget!”</p>\n<p>She was genuinely concerned for her dull brother, even repeating herself for emphasis. Zhou Mingrui nodded with a smile.</p>\n<p>“Alright.”</p>\n<p>Regarding the Loen Kingdom’s pound, Zhou Mingrui matched Klein’s muscle memory with his own, estimating it was close to half a kilogram.</p>\n<p>Melissa didn’t say anything further. She stood up, tidied the area, and packed away the last bit of bread for lunch. She put on a tattered veil cap left by their mother, picked up a self-sewn bag for her books and stationery, and prepared to leave.</p>\n<p>It wasn’t Sunday, so she had a full day of classes ahead.</p>\n<p>As she opened the main door, she paused and turned halfway, saying, “Klein, don’t buy too much mutton or peas. Benson might come back on Sunday. Oh, and remember we only need eight pounds of bread.”</p>\n<p>“Alright. Sure thing,” Zhou Mingrui replied, exasperated.</p>\n<p>He repeated the word ‘Sunday’ in his head.</p>\n<p>In the Northern Continent, a year was similarly divided into twelve months. Each year had 365 or 366 days, and a week was split into seven days.</p>\n<p>The division of months stemmed from astronomical observations. Zhou Mingrui began to suspect he was in a parallel world. The division of days was influenced by religion, as the Northern Continent worshipped seven orthodox gods—the Eternal Blazing Sun, the Lord of Storms, the God of Knowledge and Wisdom, the Evernight Goddess, Mother Earth, the God of War, and the God of Steam and Machinery.</p>\n<p>Watching his sister close the door behind her, Zhou Mingrui sighed. His thoughts shifted back to the luck enhancement ritual.</p>\n<p>Sorry, I really wish to return home…</p>",
