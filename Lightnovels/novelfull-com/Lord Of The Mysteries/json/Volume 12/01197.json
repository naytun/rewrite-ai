Some of them were made up of two winding stone golems, while others had a fist-sized hole by the gaps of the door. Some were embedded with silver nails, while others were covered in mysterious patterns. One after another, they were layered repeatedly, extending to an infinite number.</p><p>Without a sound, the Spear of Longinus tore through the illusory doors without stopping at all. It didn’t allow Saint of Secrets Botis to find a chance to escape.</p><p>In less than a second, the blood-stained spear that emitted a strong sense of destruction had shattered countless illusory doors. After it suffered a decline in its aura, it finally stabbed into its target’s chest.</p><p>Countless cracks instantly appeared on Botis’s body, as if he was a ceramic object that had fallen to the ground.</p><p>With a cracking sound, the Saint of Secrets turned pitch black as he disintegrated into pieces, scattering all over the ground.</p><p>This didn’t seem like his actual body, but more like his shadow.</p><p>This was the “Shadow Substitute” spell he had “Recorded” from a certain Sequence 3 saint under the True Creator.</p><p>Of course, without the layers of “doors” weakening the Spear of Longinus, he believed that it was very likely that his shadow together with his body would have shattered together.</p><p>After narrowly dodging this strike, Botis endured the dizziness and shock brought about by Cattleya’s incomplete Mythical Creature form as he made a gigantic, scaleless silver snake appear in his eyes.</p><p>This gigantic snake was so large that it filled Botis’s eyes. Its surface was filled with dense patterns and labels formed by one mystical wheel after another.</p><p>Its head connected to its tail as it merged with countless illusory rivers, turning into a blurred, surreal, and slowly spinning gear. Around the round gear were all sorts of symbols that represented different futures.</p><p>Suddenly, the black fragments that had yet to disappear on the ground flew up one after another and reorganized themselves on the spot, restoring Botis.</p><p>The ground that was stained with dark red blood quickly retreated from the numerous illusory doors until it returned to the distorted black blob.</p><p>The strong, fearful atmosphere receded like the tide and left the room.</p><p>The “black blob” that was covered in cracks and eyeballs squirmed and restored itself, turning back into a purple-patterned black-robed woman with a hood.</p><p>Everything returned to the point before “The Ugly Duckling” magic was used.</p><p>Reboot of Fate!</p><p>This was one of the rewards given to Saint of Secrets Botis for crushing the Abraham family—he was allowed to “Record” the Sequence 1 Beyonder power from the Angel of Fate, Ouroboros.</p><p>Of course, there was definitely a huge gap from the original version. It could only reboot reality for three seconds, and it was limited to the space of a tiny room like this. It wasn’t even able to affect the entire first floor of the apartment.</p><p>The moment “Reboot” ended, the prepared Saint Tenebrous Kisma immediately took action.</p><p>The Grazed twisted shadow that stemmed from a Sanguine Count spread open its arms and made a gesture of embracing the crimson moon.</p><p>The darkness around Cattleya surged, instantly forming illusory but firm black chains that bound her to her spot.</p><p>The flesh and blood that covered the ground, walls and ceiling gathered together rapidly, turning into a knight covered in black full-body armor. He held a heavy greatsword in his hand and looked extremely oppressive.</p><p>In the gap of the Black Knight’s visor, two dark red beams of light flickered and instantly locked onto the hooded woman beside the pumpkin carriage.</p><p>The shadow beneath Cattleya’s feet suddenly came alive as it grabbed her ankles. Like a water current that had its water level rising, it gripped her tightly.</p><p>Black Knight, Commandeering Shadows!</p><p>Then, the gigantic knight that was almost reaching the ceiling as though he came from mythical legends rushed to a spot not far from his target with a single step. He cleaved down with the heavy, long broadsword.</p><p>Elsewhere, a silver illusory book in the eyes of Saint of Secrets Botis flipped rapidly. It then stopped at a single page.</p><p>With that, Botis reached out his left hand and grabbed the pumpkin carriage across a distance of twenty to thirty meters. He then grabbed at the mysterious woman in a purple-patterned black robe.</p><p>His arm suddenly grew longer, and its surface was black and sticky, as if it was flowing with an evil liquid.</p><p>Amidst the liquid, pale skulls and eyes with pronounced blood vessels grew out, including sharp teeth and tongues. All sorts of strange things grew out, causing extreme evil and extreme madness to spread rapidly through the area.</p><p>In the room, the ground instantly cracked and the few cockroaches that were still alive collapsed to the ground.</p><p>This was an attack from a particular state of Abomination Suah!</p><p>Back outside Bayam City, Saint of Secrets Botis had been attracted by Tinder. It appeared as though he only watched from the sidelines for a while before picking up the item and leaving immediately. But in fact, he had been desperately trying to “Record” the powers or states of the high-level existences.</p><p>After failing numerous times, due to the frequent blessings of fate, he eventually obtained what he wanted. Of course, during that battle, he only managed to “Record” one.</p><p>Under this evil and pitch-black arm, Cattleya’s consciousness was tainted with madness. For a moment, she was unable to respond effectively.</p><p>Together with the shackles of darkness restraining her shadow, she could only stand rooted to the ground as she watched Saint Tenebrous Kisma’s greatsword slash at her while Saint of Secrets Botis reached out his left hand to grab at her.</p><p>At this moment, the flesh and blood walls in the room that separated the interior from the exterior was gone. An invisible and abrupt wind stirred up.</p><p>The moment the wind appeared, it grew violent and swept towards the Saint of Secrets’s and Saint Tenebrous’s hearts.</p><p>Manipulator, Mind Storm.</p><p>Not only was he not surprised or flustered by the chaotic thoughts, Botis even had the corners of his lips pull up as he smiled.</p><p>As the switch for the “Reboot,” he naturally remembered that the demigod riding the pumpkin carriage had a helper of the same level hiding outside the apartment somewhere.</p><p>The reason why he placed his focus on the enemy on the surface was to lure out the hidden demigod!</p><p>In between the two powers of “Reboot of Fate” and the Abomination state, Botis had secretly “hypnotized” himself, allowing himself to naturally divide the burden of Mind Deprivation and the knowledge torrent across most of his Worms of Star. He then left a small number to control his body so as to lock onto the “hidden” enemy.</p><p>Previously, the Dragon’s Might shock, and the fact that he was unable to discover his target, had convinced Botis that it was a demigod of the Spectator pathway.</p><p>While his mind was in a daze, the thing he branched out rapidly churned and helped Botis locate the source of the attack.</p><p>But at this moment, most of the thoughts that resonated among the Worms of Star wasn’t him being overloaded with meaningless information as he had imagined.</p><p>In his mind, there seemed to be a voice saying thousands of words in a second:</p><p>“At the bottom of an abandoned castle in Delaire Forest, there is a pair of bronze double doors. It seals with the corruptive forces underground. The higher the Sequence a Beyonder is when approaching, the easier it is to be affected…</p><p>“The cosmos is extremely dangerous. There are unknown existences watching…</p><p>“Dark Angel is suspected to be the negative personality dissociated from the ancient sun god…</p><p>“…”</p><p>What? Botis was taken aback. He felt that these thoughts were dangerous, but he couldn’t help but wish to understand more.</p><p>Just this moment of stupor made the enemy he had already found disappear once again, escaping his range of attention. As for the Abomination palm that was hurtling towards the pumpkin carriage and the female demigod, it also slowed down.</p><p>Similarly, Saint Tenebrous Kisma was also affected by the “Mind Storm” as his actions stiffened for a second.</p><p>By the time they recovered, Cattleya had already opened her mouth and spat out a pea.</p><p>The pea instantly grew, turning into thick green vines that dragged Cattleya out the door, allowing her to escape the shackles of darkness and regain some freedom of movement.</p><p>By the time Saint Tenebrous’s heavy greatsword and Saint of Secrets’s pitch-black arms landed on her, they only shattered a shadow and did not injure this Mysticologist.</p><p>They had shattered Cattleya’s “Emperor’s New Clothes” magic, something that didn’t exist at all, so she naturally wouldn’t be injured!</p><p>In the next second, the hooded lady in the purple-patterned black robe suddenly turned transparent and turned into a pile of foam.</p><p>The bubbles quickly scattered and burst one after another. Nothing was left behind. As for the green vines, they grew into midair and burst into flames, illuminating the surrounding streets.</p><p>Everything returned to normal. It was as if the short and intense demigod-level battle had never happened.</p><p>Saint of Secrets Botis and Saint Tenebrous Kisma exchanged glances. They weren’t surprised by such a development.</p><p>Clearly, after the sneak attack failed, the two demigod enemies were at a disadvantage and could no longer achieve their goals. Furthermore, this was Backlund. The longer they delayed, the more dangerous it would be. Hence, they took the opportunity to escape.</p><p>In addition, in order to interfere with the tracking, they had deliberately created a huge commotion to attract the authorities of Backlund.</p><p>As for the copy of Leymano’s Travels and a Sequence 7 or 6 Apprentice Beyonder, they were baits that could be abandoned.</p><p>After a slight nod, Saint of Secrets Botis took out a crystal ball from his black robe’s concealed pocket. It bloomed with light before it quickly shattered and merged into the void.</p><p>He was trying to prevent tracking via mysticism means.</p><p>Indeed, he didn’t dare to stay any longer. He planned on “Teleporting” away and returning to the Aurora Order headquarters. Then, he would “interrogate” the bait and figure out the truth before deciding what to do next.</p><p>A second later, Botis’s figure quickly turned transparent and disappeared. Kisma entered the shadows and rapidly left, wiping the traces behind him along the way.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
