It was ejected from the grayish-white fog and had landed in the hands of the Dark Demonic Wolf. It was suspected to contain the Sequence 1 Attendant of Mysteries Beyonder characteristic of the Seer pathway.</p><p>At this moment, Dark Demonic Wolf Kotor had borrowed some of the powers of the “curtain” to dodge Reinette Tinekerr’s Wraith’s possession at the critical moment via some unknown means, effectively avoiding the subsequent series of control.</p><p>The “curtain” was stowed away after “He” used it, allowing the Dark Demonic Wolf with “His” dark, short fur to appear in a spot that was originally empty.</p><p>Reinette Tinekerr wasn’t surprised by the failure. Taking advantage of this opportunity, a golden-haired, red-eyed head in “Her” hand spat out a rectangular, diamond-like charm.</p><p>The other three heads used ancient Hermes, Jotun, and Elvish to say a word:</p><p>“Yesterday!”</p><p>The rectangular diamond-like charm was instantly engulfed in transparent flames as it fused with the void.</p><p>Reinette Tinekerr’s body swelled as the four blonde, red-eyed heads flew up and landed on “Her” empty neck, stacked upon one another.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Miss Messenger had transformed into a huge doll that could almost break through the Dark Demonic Wolf’s castle.</p><p>“She” was wearing a black gothic dress with countless mysterious symbols and sinister vines. “Her” eyes were blood-red and “She” exuded an aura that no human should possess.</p><p>Dark Demonic Wolf Kotar didn’t attempt to stop Reinette Tinekerr from borrowing strength from “Her” past, nor did “He” immediately show “His” complete Mythical Creature form. With eight feet on the ground, “He” raised “His” neck and let out a roar.</p><p>This roar seemed to be of a higher level, containing words similar to Jotun. It made the “curtain” float up and instantly expand, blanketing the ancient castle from top to bottom.</p><p>The “curtain” quickly turned transparent and fused with the building. It was as though it had never appeared or had any effect on it. However, Klein’s spiritual intuition told him that this place was already isolated from the outside world. If he wanted to leave, he had to first break the invisible barrier.</p><p>In other words, that “curtain” made the Dark Demonic Wolf’s castle become an independent “kingdom.”</p><p>This was the embryonic form of a divine kingdom!</p><p>Klein, who had just failed and planned on continuing to summon angels to help him, had a spark of inspiration. He instantly changed his mind, reaching into the void and dragging out another him.</p><p>It was Gehrman Sparrow, one who was holding a historical projection of the Staff of the Stars.</p><p>Right on the heels of that, Klein controlled his historical projection to turn him into his marionette and transfer some Worms of Spirit over.</p><p>While he was busy with these matters, Reinette Tinekerr had already recovered to “Her” peak condition. “Her” bright red eyes reflected the eight-legged demonic wolf.</p><p>With a faint flash, the Dark Demonic Wolf turned into a white goat.</p><p>However, outside the dark hall, a giant holding a broom suddenly trembled and transformed into a demonic wolf with a tuft of gray hair on its forehead.</p><p>At the moment when the curse was cast on “Him,” a Miracle Invoker, “He” had swapped places with “His” marionette!</p><p>“He” opened “His” mouth once again and let out a roar.</p><p>This roar also contained words that mostly resembled the source of Jotun, describing a beautiful wish:</p><p>“I wish for all godhood here to dissipate!”</p><p>In the next second, as the God of Wishes, the Dark Demonic Wolf granted “His” wish. Klein immediately felt his godhood being repressed. The Beyonder powers that stemmed from Scholar of Yore and Bizarro Sorcerer could no longer be used!</p><p>Fortunately, the historical projection was maintained with spirituality. As long as the summoning was successful, it wouldn’t be dispelled by the Dark Demonic Wolf’s wish. Similarly, as Klein had already turned his historical projection into a marionette and transferred a number of Worms of Spirit over, he could still swap locations with his projection.</p><p>Apart from him, Reinette Tinekerr and Dark Demonic Wolf were also affected by the wish that had been granted. Their Beyonder powers above Sequence 5 had vanished into thin air, making it difficult to use them.</p><p>Of course, be it the demonic wolf marionette that had turned into a goat, or the gigantic doll-like Reinette Tinekerr, there was no change in “Their” form. What existed was reasonable, so it couldn’t be eliminated by the “Power of Wishes.”</p><p>After making this wish, the Dark Demonic Wolf arched “His” back and bent “His” body slightly. It looked like “He” was about to engage in a battle with Klein and Reinette Tinekerr.</p><p>At that moment, “His” mountain-like body was about the size of the castle-like doll. “He” looked down coldly at Klein, capable of crushing him with a single swipe of “His” claw.</p><p>In addition, the castle had many marionettes rushing over. They consisted of giants, elves, vampires, humans, and deformed monsters.</p><p>Only a number of them were at Sequence 5, but now, they had Kotar’s Worms of Spirit in their bodies. In other words, in this special environment, all of them were at Sequence 5.</p><p>After the dissipation of godhood, in this independent “kingdom,” Dark Demonic Wolf Kotar’s advantage became obvious.</p><p>More than a hundred Sequence 5s were besieging two Sequence 5s!</p><p>Furthermore, the Dark Demonic Wolf was itself a mutant. Even if “He” couldn’t reveal any godhood, “His” massive size and terrifying strength made “Him” adept at combat. “He” wasn’t on the same level as a weak human like Marionettist Klein.</p><p>At this moment, the body of Reinette Tinekerr, who was dressed in a black gothic dress that twined with sinister vines, suddenly turned incorporeal. First, “She” reflected on a floor-to-ceiling window, then it jumped into the pitch-black pupils of the Dark Demonic Wolf.</p><p>“She” had once again attempted Wraith’s possession.</p><p>However, Dark Demonic Wolf Kotar swapped locations with another marionette in a timely fashion, preventing Reinette Tinekerr from successfully “possessing” “His” body.</p><p>Reinette Tinekerr wasn’t discouraged as “She” continued using mediums such as glass windows, chandeliers, and eyeballs to “jump” through the different marionettes in pursuit of the real Dark Demonic Wolf.</p><p>As for the Dark Demonic Wolf, “He” relied on “His” numerous marionettes, and had the advantage of copious numbers of Worms of Spirit. “He” swapped between different marionettes without any pause to avoid being forcibly possessed by the Ancient Bane.</p><p>Amidst the two angels’ silent conflict, a large number of the Dark Demonic Wolf’s marionettes had surrounded the two Kleins.</p><p>Beyonder powers like a vampire’s “Abyss Shackles,” a giant’s “Hurricane of Light,” an elf’s “Wind Binding,” and a human’s “Psychic Piercing” and “Holy Light Summoning” inundated their targets. They controlled, weakened, attacked, and purified Klein, acting with great rapport. Klein was only able to dodge a portion of the attacks before being “drowned” by the attacks.</p><p>Plasma exploded as the light blasted out. Klein’s Staff of the Stars-holding figure quickly outlined itself to the side.</p><p>At that critical moment, he had exchanged spots with his marionette in time. He imagined his “Traveling” powers and had used the Staff of the Stars to complete the teleportation.</p><p>In this special scenario, this was essentially a release of “Recorded” powers.</p><p>After dodging this round of attacks, Klein discovered that a marionette was controlling his Spirit Body Threads before he could catch his breath.</p><p>At the same time, a human marionette reached out his right hand under the influence of the Dark Demonic Wolf and aimed at the Miracle Invoker’s actual body.</p><p>In the next second, the Dark Demonic Wolf and another marionette switched positions. As for the marionette, it was “possessed” by Reinette Tinekerr.</p><p>This way, the human marionette’s right hand was targeted at Reinette Tinekerr.</p><p>The marionette’s palm clenched tightly as his wrist spun half a circle, stealing away the target’s subsequent thoughts.</p><p>Right on the heels of that, he jumped and pounced on an ally.</p><p>Reinette Tinekerr was momentarily rooted to the ground.</p><p>When the Dark Demonic Wolf saw this, “He” immediately got several marionettes to spread open their arms and summon pure pillars of cleansing flames to surround them.</p><p>In the holy light, Wraith Reinette Tinekerr’s body first began to melt. Following that, using “Mirror Jump,” “She” moved to a glass window situated high above the castle to avoid the subsequent purification.</p><p>In just a few seconds, “She” and Klein inevitably fell into a perilous situation.</p><p>The restricted environment, being on “His” home ground, and “His” trait as the God of Wishes had magnified Dark Demonic Wolf Kotar advantage to the extreme.</p><p>If it were any other Scholar of Yore, there was only one problem he needed to consider—how to rely on Reinette Tinekerr to escape, but Klein had his trump card.</p><p>Just as he pulled back his Spirit Body Threads, he didn’t hesitate to stir the powers of Sefirah Castle.</p><p>This trait of his wasn’t suppressed by the Dark Demonic Wolf’s “wish.”</p><p>This was something even the Forsaken Land of the Gods couldn’t screen!</p><p>In midair, grayish-white fog appeared. The ancient palace above the spirit world appeared faint.</p><p>Its appearance brought with it slight tremors. A certain power followed the connection and shook the demonic wolf’s castle, causing the translucent black velvet “curtain” to jolt out of place a little, allowing the independent “kingdom” to intersect with reality.</p><p>Seizing this opportunity, Klein opened his mouth and shouted out a name in Jotun:</p><p>“Leodero!”</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Thousands of thick silver lightning bolts descended from the sky, smiting Dark Demonic Wolf Kotar’s castle. The area transformed into a lightning forest that emitted a strong destructive aura.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
