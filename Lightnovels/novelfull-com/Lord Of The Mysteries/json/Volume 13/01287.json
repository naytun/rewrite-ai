He didn’t know whether the angel was having mental problems and wasn’t far from losing control because of his shaken anchors, or if “He” was too affected by the God of Combat. In a certain sense, “He” had become “His” backup.</p><p>Ignoring the Sequence 0 true deities, even Kings of Angels and a number of angels would often not completely die!</p><p>“You should know very well that the apocalypse will come in another ten or so years. I believe that the speed of the God of Combat’s resurrection won’t be fast enough.” Klein attempted to awaken him with the cruel reality.</p><p>Larrion snorted.</p><p>“You will never be able to imagine the power of God.”</p><p>“He” didn’t give Klein the chance to continue his persuasion and revealed a smile.</p><p>“In short, I won’t make a deal with you. Pray, pray to Evernight. Pray to the deity you believe in to seal 0-02 and save you!</p><p>“But all I need to do is wait another thirty to forty seconds before I can leave this place.”</p><p>Klein looked up at the “curtain” hanging from infinitely high above and didn’t say anything else. He made his Spirit Body return to the library where the Trunsoest Brass Book was.</p><p>“Do you have any ideas?” he asked without any delay.</p><p>Arianna shook her head slightly and asked, “What did Larrion say?”</p><p>“‘He’ told us to pray to the deities to seal 0-02…” As Klein spoke, he was suddenly stunned.</p><p>What Larrion said didn’t seem to be problematic, but he had inadvertently revealed a very important piece of information.</p><p>He believed that deities could seal 0-02, no matter who “They” were!</p><p>Then, what does a deity rely on to seal it? By forcefully suppressing it with “Their” Sequence 0 status, or use a might that can destroy the world? Many questions appeared in Klein’s mind.</p><p>At this moment, Trunsoest Brass Book flipped to a blank page, producing silver words one after another—the language it used was the one on the first Blasphemy Slate. It seemed to be the source of all the languages that were still in use.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the silver words formed into new text:</p><p>“The Belltaine City Library is the place where the Trunsoest Brass Book is kept. It is a place that must be heavily protected. Living beings who intrude without the Trunsoest Brass Book’s permission will be severely punished.”</p><p>It’s an elevation of the punishment. I might be sentenced to death next… Klein’s pupils dilated as he quickly deduced the most likely development.</p><p>However, he didn’t panic at all. Instead, he smiled and said with sincerity, “My wish is to shrink the size of the Belltaine City Library, so that the spot where Ma’am Arianna and I are is the boundary line.”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he snapped his fingers and granted his own wish.</p><p>As the snapping sound reverberated, the lawn that corresponded to the Belltaine City Library disappeared. The building shrunk and the walls retreated. Soon, only a tenth of its original size was left.</p><p>Klein and Arianna subconsciously “arrived” outside the floor-to-ceiling windows. Through the open window, they stared at the Trunsoest Brass Book that remained on the rectangular table.</p><p>There was no change in the distance between them and the target. They were still very close, but they were no longer within the confines of being severely punished. However, due to their first violation of the curfew, they were once again whipped by an invisible law enforcer.</p><p>After accumulating the wishes of restoring buildings one after another, Klein could create quite a miracle in this aspect!</p><p>He didn’t make another wish and continued thinking. He analyzed the hidden meaning behind the words of the chief shepherd of the Church of the God of Combat.</p><p>No, it shouldn’t have been forcefully suppressed using a deity’s status and level. Otherwise, my spiritual intuition would’ve told me the answer long ago. That would’ve made me activate Sefirah Castle’s aura and complete the seal…</p><p>From a mysticism point of view, this is understandable. This is because 0-02 is clearly related to a particular sefirah. It’s difficult to suppress it by relying on the status and level of a Sequence 0…</p><p>By relying on the might of the deities “Themselves”? This might be possible, but there’s a high chance that it’s not the real method. This is because Larrion knows of a sealing method that can be completed without relying on the deities…</p><p>What’s special about a Sequence 0 deity? And what methods can an angel use to achieve such a special sealing method?</p><p>The most special thing that I can think of at the moment is that a Sequence 0 deity contains a Uniqueness. This is something I can’t summon from the Historical Void. It really has the characteristic of being “unique.”</p><p>But how can an angel indirectly simulate a Uniqueness?</p><p>Countless thoughts collided in Klein’s mind, producing large amounts of sparks, but he still couldn’t figure out the key to the problem.</p><p>At this moment, the mercury-colored words on the Trunsoest Brass Book continued to seep out, forming new paragraphs that stipulated that Klein and Arianna were a group of people that needed punishment.</p><p>Arianna observed silently for a while before suddenly saying, “I’ll try to ‘Conceal’ the soil beneath the table to make 0-02 fall to the core. Raise your level of alertness to prevent any accidents.”</p><p>Conceal” the soil… Fall to the core… Klein’s heart stirred. He felt that this was a rather good solution.</p><p>The Trunsoest Brass Book had only forbidden the touching and changing its condition at present. The environment wasn’t equivalent to its condition. In addition, they were only forbidden from entering Belltaine City Library. It didn’t mean that Klein and Arianna couldn’t exert certain influences on it.</p><p>And when 0-02, which hadn’t been banned from leaving, passed through the concealed “soil” and fell to the core, it would lose its influence on Belltaine City due to the distance, causing the laws it had set up to fail. That was the case unless it was awakened further or came to life, allowing a larger region to fall under its jurisdiction.</p><p>This way, Klein and Arianna no longer needed to be restricted by the rules. They could seek help from the Evernight Goddess!</p><p>However, when Arianna finally thought of a solution and was preparing to carry out the plan, a new law was completely formed:</p><p>“The Belltaine City Library the place where the Trunsoest Brass Book is stored. It is a place that must be strictly protected. No living thing or object is to deal any form of damage to it in any way.”</p><p>Indeed, 0-02 has also noticed this loophole… This loophole… As Klein frowned slightly, he suddenly had an idea of what he had been thinking about.</p><p>The Uniqueness of a Sequence 0 deity was indeed unique, but “Their” sealing of 0-02 wasn’t directly done by using the authority and power that came from it.</p><p>It was very likely that “They” could rely on this trait of a Uniqueness to lure 0-02 into setting up a series of contradictory rules, causing the Sealed Artifact to fall into a paradoxical cycle!</p><p>In this aspect, angels, saints, and even ordinary people could accomplish that by themselves. The key was to think of paradox and guide it into establishing it.</p><p>As for how to seal 0-02 after it entered a paradoxical cycle and was preparing to fix the loophole, Klein didn’t have any clues at the moment, so he needed to make further observations.</p><p>How should I create a paradox… All the rules and regulations set up by 0-02 quickly flashed through Klein’s mind.</p><p>In just a few seconds, he acutely grasped a point where he could create a paradoxical cycle. He quickly turned his head and said to Arianna, “Ma’am, let’s not destroy the city library. We will directly ‘Conceal’ the other parts of the Belltaine, indirectly causing it to lose the necessary support. This place will then collapse on its own; thus, falling into the core.”</p><p>Arianna didn’t immediately do as he said. Instead, “She” turned “Her” head and gave Klein a deep look.</p><p>“This will cause the deaths of many civilians.”</p><p>“We have to make a choice between the lesser of two evils,” Klein said seriously.</p><p>Arianna didn’t respond and fell silent. It was as though “She” was in an intense mental struggle or making the appropriate preparations.</p><p>At this moment, the two brass pages that had just written the two articles quickly created more new rules:</p><p>“Belltaine is the city where the Trunsoest Brass Book is located, a true Holy Land in all senses of the phrase. No living thing or object is to deal any form of damage to it in any way.”</p><p>Upon seeing this text, Klein wasn’t disappointed. Instead, he smiled.</p><p>With a snap, he snapped his fingers, causing scarlet flames to surge out of his pocket and quickly drown him.</p><p>In just two to three seconds, a stream of flames descended from the sky. Klein jumped out and carried a person.</p><p>That was one of the four Beyonders he had saved previously. He was the Belltaine local, Biles!</p><p>“Go in and quickly flip through the brass book,” Klein said calmly as he pointed at the 0-02 on the rectangular table.</p><p>Biles didn’t know exactly what had happened, but he believed that this magical “magician,” who had fulfilled two of his wishes, had found a way out of the situation plaguing Belltaine. Thus, after taking a deep breath, he entered the city library through the miniaturized, open floor-to-ceiling windows.</p><p>During this process, he didn’t receive any severe punishments. In fact, he wasn’t even whipped!</p><p>Upon seeing this scene, Klein’s smile widened.</p><p>0-02 had produced a paradox!</p><p>Due to Arrodes’s existence, the Trunsoest Brass Book could only do a most comprehensive prohibition, preventing any living being or object from dealing any form of damage to it in any way.”</p><p>As a city, Belltaine’s definition didn’t just include its terrain and buildings. It definitely included the residents here.</p><p>This way, if 0-02 punished a Belltaine citizen like Biles, any damage to him would go against the law it had just issued. If it didn’t punish him, it would go against the laws that prohibited him from entering the city library. Hence, the Trunsoest Brass Book had entered a vicious cycle!</p><p>Of course, Klein believed that such a paradox would quickly be corrected by appending additional clauses. He only hoped that Biles would be able to flip through the brass book and find clues to sealing it!</p><p>“Pay attention to the currently open page. Once an article is about to take shape, immediately come out,” Klein instructed as he stared at Biles and 0-02.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
