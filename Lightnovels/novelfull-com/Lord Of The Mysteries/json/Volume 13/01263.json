A crack that resembled tree branches appeared. As for how long the barrier could last in the Lightning Storm, that remained a question.</p><p>At this moment, behind Dark Angel Sasrir, there was an area that wasn’t covered by the forest of lightning. Klein’s figure, in his black trench coat and silk half top hat, appeared.</p><p>He was like a precise and cold machine. Without any hesitation, he aimed the Staff of the Stars at the side of the special evil spirit, quickly outlining all sorts of information related to the Beyonder powers in his mind.</p><p>He had previously performed tests—he couldn’t “Wander” too far with the Staff of the Stars within the Giant King’s Court, so he could only use “Blink” in a tiny vicinity. Therefore, he gave up on the idea of directly sending Dark Angel Sasrir out the Giant King’s Court and seizing the opportunity to take the first Blasphemy Slate and leaving by “opening” the door.</p><p>As the various gems on the Staff of the Stars lit up, Sasrir’s eyes which burned with pitch-black flames suddenly closed.</p><p>He had been forcibly dragged into a dream by Klein!</p><p>This was a Beyonder power belonging to the Evernight pathway’s Sequence 7, but the one that Klein replicated had belonged to the version which the Evernight Cloister’s matron, the Servant of Concealment Arianna, had used—the Beyonder power of pulling someone into a dream performed at the angel-level!</p><p>In the hazy dream world, Dark Angel Sasrir wore a black robe with complicated symbols embroidered with silver threads and adorned with accessories. “He” had appeared in a desolate moor.</p><p>“His” eyes remained ice-cold, unlike the dull and lifeless eyes of most Beyonders when they were in dreams.</p><p>The Spectator pathway also belonged to the Chaos Sea pathway. And its Sequence 5 and Sequence 3 were Dreamwalker and Dreamweaver respectively!</p><p>Moments later, Sasrir’s pupils turned golden and vertical.</p><p>“His” giant figure faded away as a layer of abnormally thick shadows appeared in front of “Him.”</p><p>This shadow completely blocked Sasrir, making it possible to vaguely make out a pair of eyes hidden behind the “curtain.”</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the “curtains” parted, revealing an indescribable color, like a sea that seemed to contain all secrets.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>When Klein, the conjurer of the dream, saw this scene, his mind erupted with thoughts before he could analyze the details. It was as though his brain was a boiling pot of wheat porridge.</p><p>The corners of his mouth curled up instinctively, and most of his Virtual Persona disintegrated. He nearly let out a tragic cry as transparent maggots under his left cheek began to drill out one by one. The meat tendrils on his right face grew more and more obvious, becoming thinner and thinner, approaching that of Worms of Spirit.</p><p>The forcefully-induced dream disintegrated, and Dark Angel Sasrir’s consciousness returned to the real world.</p><p>However, at that moment when the special evil spirit fell into a deep slumber, the sea of lightning faded away. The three demigods of the City of Silver struck back at the same time.</p><p>Colin Iliad straightened his body and struck out with the sword of dawn in his right hand, causing the silvery-white light to “Blink” to Sasrir’s body. As Lovia resisted the restraints of the shadow “cloak,” she got the Silver Knight evil spirit she Grazed to swing its greatsword upwards from below, bringing with it a terrifying storm formed from blobs of light. Derrick condensed a dazzling white “Unshadowed Spear,” thrusting it at the Dark Angel as it left crackling sounds in its wake.</p><p>At this moment, Sasrir’s figure emitted infinite pure light, as though “He” had suddenly become a sun that descended into reality.</p><p>Under the “sun”‘s illumination, the “Unshadowed Spear” melted. The “Hurricane of Light” calmed down, and the silver beam dimmed. All the latter could do was damage the target’s aura, and not deal any harm to “His” body.</p><p>The scene of a true deity’s descent shocked Lovia and Derrick. They couldn’t help but bow their heads in worship. As for the Silver Knight evil spirit, it quickly melted under the blazing sunlight and completely evaporated.</p><p>Suddenly, Sasrir’s eyes closed once again.</p><p>Behind “His” back, with the Worms of Spirit constantly vanishing on Klein’s body, he stubbornly endured the scorching sun’s heat and pointed the Staff of the Stars at the evil spirit—the embodiment of the King of Angels.</p><p>The Beyonder power that he had replicated once again had forcefully pulled Dark Angel Sasrir into a dream!</p><p>However, unlike before, the moment Klein entered the dreamscape, he immediately released his Sefirah Castle’s aura, transforming his body into the strange door of light that was tainted with some bluish-black colors. The door of light was made up of countless layers of illusory spherical light. Every spherical light was deep down a transparent and translucent cluster of twisted maggots.</p><p>Just like him, Dark Angel Sasrir revealed the traits of Chaos Sea. First, “He” turned into a thick and sinister shadow, then “He” pulled open the “curtain,” allowing the “sea” that contained all colors and something the human language couldn’t describe to appear in the dream.</p><p>Silently, Sasrir and Klein opened their eyes at the same time and raised their bodies slightly across each other.</p><p>One of them was covered in a faint shadow, while the other’s expression was twisted and ferocious. Many Worms of Spirit crawled across the surface of his body.</p><p>Klein’s Virtual Persona completely shattered.</p><p>Seizing this opportunity while Sasrir was affected, Lovia, who had the shadow “cloak” draped over her, blinked her pale-gray eyes. She used the two-meter-tall, squirming flesh to extend. Those skinless legs, which were flowing with bright red liquid, stepped onto the ground at the same time. With the help of the roiling winds, they pounced towards the Dark Angel.</p><p>A look of madness appeared in her eyes. It didn’t appear like it would take long before her Spirit Body suffered complete corruption, pushing her towards losing control.</p><p>However, at that moment, Lovia’s eyes were filled with more rationality and determination.</p><p>She knew what she was doing and knew her current state and her subsequent end.</p><p>Amidst the howling winds, her collapsing body, along with the shadow “cloak,” landed on Dark Angel Sasrir’s body.</p><p>The squirming flesh and blood intruded as the thick shadow rapidly expanded, binding the two figures together.</p><p>Without waiting for Lovia to speak, Colin Iliad had already understood her intentions. He immediately roared in a low voice, “Attack!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>His two swords tore through the void at the same time, allowing the silver light to surge at Lovia and Dark Angel Sasrir who were embroiled with each other.</p><p>Upon hearing the Chief’s words, Derrick bit his lip and spread open his arms halfway.</p><p>The palace that was shrouded in the shadows suddenly lit up as huge balls of light filled with holy flames appeared out of thin air. They enveloped the Dark Angel and Lovia within, quickly melting them and igniting their flesh.</p><p>Flaring Sun!</p><p>Amid this bright glow, Lovia’s pale-gray eyes revealed the pain that she acutely felt. Her voice echoed in an ethereal manner.</p><p>“I have never betrayed the City of Silver…”</p><p>Before she could finish her sentence, the flesh and the shadow “cloak” she used to envelop Dark Angel Sasrir’s body swelled up.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Lovia’s collapsing body was sent flying before she fell to the ground. Her shadow tore apart, turning into a thin, illusory veil that slowly floated down.</p><p>Dark Angel Sasrir turned into a pitch-black and sticky sea filled with an aura of Degeneration. It swallowed the remaining silvery-white light and “Flaring Sun,” reducing it to nothing.</p><p>“He” immediately returned to “His” previous appearance—a giant dressed in a gorgeous black robe with silver threads. However, the black wings on his back had thinned significantly.</p><p>At the same time, “His” pupils turned vertical and turned golden.</p><p>A violent but surreal wind surged around “Him” and filled every corner of the shadow palace with all sorts of thoughts.</p><p>Mind Deprivation!</p><p>Derrick’s recently condensed “Unshadowed Spear” disappeared. He stood rooted to the ground in shock. Although Colin Iliad had a strong will, he suffered from the madness, cruelty, and bloodlust of an incomplete Mythical Creature form. All he could do was divert some attention to resist the influence so as to prevent himself from losing control. Just as Klein calmed down and allowed his Worms of Spirit to burrow back into his body, he suffered an intense fear brought about by “Mind Deprivation.” His body instantly convulsed, preventing him from using the Staff of the Stars.</p><p>Lovia’s body had already collapsed, and with her soul almost completely corrupted, she was in a worse off state. She rolled on the ground struggling, leaving behind blood-colored sticky liquid.</p><p>At this moment, Dark Angel Sasrir raised “His” left hand. The golden colors in “His” eyes was replaced by two blazing white suns.</p><p>Rays of holy flames fell down one after another, striking Lovia’s body, destroying her soul and purifying her flesh.</p><p>Lovia’s aura rapidly dissipated as her pale gray eyes lost their luster.</p><p>Her body, which had collapsed into a lump of flesh and blood, curled up. The skinless arms covered in bright red liquid wrapped the milky-white, large human skull tightly in front of her “chest” and pressed it under her.</p><p>Under the blazing “sunlight”, the holy flames burned. Lovia maintained this posture, not allowing herself to move, nor allowing the human skull to be revealed and receive any damage.</p><p>Another column of light shot down. Lovia’s body couldn’t help but bounce up, but she still huddled there writhing.</p><p>Finally, this lump of distorted, disgusting, squirming flesh stopped moving and covered the surface of the human skull. It was dark, dull, and damaged.</p><p>During the Dark Angel Sasrir’s act of murdering Lovia, Klein quickly recovered from the effects of “Mind Deprivation” by using his unique traits and past experience. He felt an uncontrollable sense of despair towards this battle.</p><p>They had used all their strength, but they had only slightly injured the evil spirit. Now that they had lost a demigod, the situation that followed would probably be even worse.</p><p>What should I do? As Klein used Creeping Hunger to change his position, his thoughts raced in search of any possible weaknesses.</p><p>It’s intrinsically an evil spirit… An evil spirit… Just as his figure appeared elsewhere, he suddenly had an idea. He cast his gaze on the grayish-white stone slate on the iron-black throne!</p><p>Some evil spirits had Beyonder characteristics, but most of them didn’t. The source of their powers stemmed from other places, such as the spirit world. The existence of evil spirits needed something to rely on. This might be the “territory” that “He” was born in, or perhaps something special. The common point was that evil spirits could use them to connect to the spirit world or even the Underworld to obtain the power to maintain their existence.</p><p>And this evil spirit that originated from Dark Angel Sasrir might even be mixed with some of the will of the Primordial. Where did “His” powers come from?</p><p>This was the Forsaken Land of the Gods, and the connection with the spirit world was sealed. It was almost completely severed, making the powers difficult to be effectively utilized. Klein could “Teleport” only by relying on the uniqueness of a divine kingdom or the divine kingdom’s embryonic form. As for the Giant King’s Court, it was clearly unable to provide the powers of the Spectator, The Sun, The Hanged Man, Reader, and Tyrant pathways. The traits the Dark Angel formerly possessed clearly belonged to the True Creator at present, making it not present here.</p><p>Therefore, the answer to the source of the evil spirit’s power was very simple:</p><p>Chaos Sea!</p><p>In the shadow palace, the only thing directly connected to Chaos Sea was the Blasphemy Slate!</p><p>When Klein cast his gaze at the iron-black throne, he noticed that the City of Silver’s Chief, Colin Iliad, had also glanced over.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
