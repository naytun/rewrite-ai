Even the surrounding barriers seemed to blend in with it. It gave one the feeling that it was a pocket of infinite space.</p><p>In an instant, the darkness lit up with countless resplendent speckles, as if they had transformed into a miniature cosmos, a miniature universe.</p><p>These bright points of light rapidly spun as the surrounding scene changed several times in a second.</p><p>What Klein expected was to move Abomination Suah, the Rose School of Thought Shaman, and many of their followers to the ruins of the battle of the gods. By making them leave the Southern Continent, they wouldn’t be able to immediately sense that Klarman had been attacked. This way, they wouldn’t be able to provide any timely and effective assistance. However, the second level of the Box of the Great Old Ones had an element of randomness to it. The act of sending things to the designated scene succeeded a handful of times. Most of the time, the selected destination would suffer an unavoidable change. This was something that couldn’t be influenced with luck, and at the very least, no one below Sequence 0 could do so.</p><p>Therefore, when he opened the second level of the Box of the Great Old Ones, Klein didn’t know what would happen. It was the same as not using any Beyonder powers to cheat at gambling. He had to rely solely on observation to push out all his chips. This left his heart filled with anxiety. Of course, he wasn’t too worried. No matter where the Box of the Great Old Ones brought him and Miss Messenger, it was impossible to harm him in any way. After all, Reinette Tinekerr was fake, the Box of the Great Old Ones was fake, and even he himself was fake.</p><p>With this in consideration, even if he was thrown underground by the Box of the Great Old Ones and faced a terrifying corruption, Klein could instantly dispel the Historical Void projection, enter Sefirah Castle to do a complete “disinfection” and sever all connections.</p><p>Building on this foundation, he had the ability to help Miss Messenger’s main body resist the corruption. Since it wasn’t directly experienced—through the layer of a historical projection—the outcome was relatively better.</p><p>The only thing he needed to worry about was that the random scene selected by the Box of the Great Old Ones was where Miss Sharron and Emlyn were attacking Shaman King Klarman. That way, it would be equivalent to leading the main enemy force to head straight for his headquarters. This meant that they could only consider giving up on the operation, and he and Reinette Tinekerr would undertake the responsibility of helping all participants escape from the battlefield and escape the Southern Continent.</p><p>The probability of this happening was very low, but he had to be wary.</p><p>At that moment, due to the influence of Abomination Suah’s aura, Klein’s spirituality had “frozen” quite a bit. It seemed to bind his body and soul, but it still flowed into the Box of the Great Old Ones, maintaining its open state.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the scene in the second level of the Box of the Great Old Ones changed, revealing a tiny, vast sea.</p><p>Klein, Reinette Tinekerr, Abomination Suah, the hooded Shaman King, and many Rose School of Thought believers and subordinates saw endless yellow sand and the extreme cold of the night.</p><p>Other than the projection of the Chained God, all the living beings on the battlefield were instantly transported to a desert!</p><p>As for the projection, due to the departure of Abomination Suah, the connection was severed, preventing “His” powers from seeping into reality.</p><p>Without the luxury of time to examine where he was currently, Klein dispelled the Box of the Great Old Ones and snapped his fingers, summoning a scarlet flame as he constantly jumped within them.</p><p>He had done so to avoid the attention of Abomination Suah, as well as grab the opportunity to complete the summoning of the Historical Void projection.</p><p>At that moment, he heard an extremely evil roar. His mind suddenly went blank, and he temporarily lost all his thoughts.</p><p>The scarlet flames he was immersed in came alive as well and, like a cage, bound him to the ground.</p><p>With just a roar and the influence of some auras, Abomination Suah had already restrained him to a certain extent.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the fact that Reinette Tinekerr, who was in “Her” peak condition, was his teammate, Klein’s projection would’ve been helplessly executed. Perhaps his actual body would suffer certain effects.</p><p>At this moment, the huge doll the size of a castle took a step forward and opened its tightly shut mouth.</p><p>There was no sound, but the distorted “wood” that was covered in pitch-black liquid seemed to encounter a flood dike. It repelled backward and raised the arms with strange protruding objects.</p><p>This was a curse that Reinette Tinekerr had been silently accumulating for a very, very long time. The root of the curse was the anger, hatred, and “Her” grudge that had emerged after “She” suffered an attack!</p><p>However, Abomination Suah didn’t show any obvious changes. “He” only staggered a little and froze for a second before returning to normal.</p><p>High-level existences were always able to restrain low-level Beyonders of the same pathway. They could even exert a certain influence over space!</p><p>And using this opportunity to escape the restraints of the flames, Klein used Creeping Hunger to flash to another side, avoiding the Blood Moon Arrow created by the Rose School of Thought’s Shaman King.</p><p>He didn’t dare to look directly at Abomination Suah. He seized the opportunity and reached out with his right hand to pull out from the void ahead.</p><p>This time, he didn’t drag anything out.</p><p>Klein continued Blinking about and repeated his actions. Then, he successfully dragged out a figure. It was none other than the leader of the Church of Evernight’s ascetics, the angel of the Concealment domain, Arianna, who wore a simple linen robe and a tree bark belt!</p><p>My report from before worked after all… A thought flashed through his mind as he activated Creeping Hunger once again and teleported elsewhere.</p><p>The eyes of Arianna’s projection darted slightly as her eyes instantly turned dark and deep. Following that, she joined in the battle between Reinette Tinekerr and Abomination Suah.</p><p>With “Her” help, Reinette Tinekerr, who was in a rather difficult situation and trying hard to create opportunities for him, finally managed to catch “Her” breath. “She” didn’t get possessed by Abomination Suah, nor did “She” become a real doll.</p><p>The Rose School of Thought’s Shaman King showcased his well-rounded aspect towards the Darkness and Moon domains. He attempted to use spells like “Abyss Shackles” to restrict Klein’s movement, but the short-distance “Blinking” was simply too effective. Without the projection of the Chained God and “His” influence of the surrounding area, and the interference of Abomination, Klein was like a fish in water. He was free and relaxed. He only needed to consider how to deal with his enemy’s spells every two “Teleports.”</p><p>However, the Shaman King could hardly stop him in an effective manner due to the unpredictability of where he would appear next.</p><p>During this process, Klein grabbed at the void a few more times until he dragged out a figure.</p><p>This figure had bronze skin, black hair, and brown eyes. His facial features were soft and his gaze was cold. He wore a deep black robe embroidered with golden thread. He wore a golden crown and was none other than the former Death Consul, Azik Eggers!</p><p>Another angel… The Shaman King’s eyelids twitched as he watched. At this moment, Abomination Suah suddenly inserted multiple black arms into the desert.</p><p>The desert nearby boiled and was blanketed with a thick black liquid. This extended into the distance and invaded the void, disrupting the overlapping of reality and the spirit world.</p><p>Taking advantage of the fact that his teleportation wasn’t completely affected, Klein “Blinked” behind Mr. Azik. With “Him” shielding him, he quickly grabbed at the air a few times.</p><p>His arm suddenly sank and he pulled out a silvery-white snake’s tail.</p><p>Another angel!</p><p>The reason why he dared to directly summon the three angels was because this Historical Void projection of his was summoned by Reinette Tinekerr using the Staff of the Stars. The spirituality consumed was borne by this Ancient Bane, not Fors.</p><p>Otherwise, Fors would’ve already fainted the moment the Servant of Concealment, Arianna, descended. There was no way she could endure spirituality expenditure such as this.</p><p>Fors’s purpose was to first summon Gehrman Sparrow’s historical projection so that he had plenty of time to set up the ritual and bring the Staff of the Stars to the real world. Then, the maintenance of the historical projection would be dispelled, allowing him to return to the fog and have Reinette Tinekerr summoned another him.</p><p>In less than ten seconds, as Abomination Suah had focused his attention on Reinette Tinekerr and subconsciously belittled Klein, leading “Him” to not only losing the help of the Chained God’s projection, but also being thrown from the state of being the one who had laid in ambush to the one being besieged by four powerful angels.</p><p>Without any hesitation, this Sequence 1 angel opened “His” mouth and chanted in ancient Hermes words. “He” had once again prayed to the Chained God.</p><p>…</p><p>When the Door of Summoning opened in front of Shaman King Klarman, just the extension of two trembling hands was enough for a thought to abruptly flash across Emlyn White’s mind.</p><p>The other angel of the Rose School of Thought, the King of Curses, Barranca!</p><p>This was information provided by Sharron and Maric.</p><p>Upon seeing this, Emlyn’s mind tensed up. Without any hesitation, he waved his arm and threw the Vision of White at the Door of Summoning!</p><p>This was partly because he was experiencing a battle at the demigod level for the first time, so he couldn’t help but overreact. On the other hand, he wasn’t worried about losing the Vision of White. After all, it belonged to the Sanguine. At worst, he would repay it in the future over time.</p><p>At the same time, even without the Sealed Artifact, he still had other mystical items to use, such as Leymano’s Travels.</p><p>With the notebook, Emlyn could summon the Unshadowed Crucifix to replace the Vision of White.</p><p>After the eyeball-shaped glass sphere flew out, it continuously absorbed the light along the way, bringing with it extreme darkness.</p><p>When it got close to the Door of Summoning, the Vision of White suddenly exploded into an extremely brilliant glow. Like a blazing sun at noon, it enveloped both the hands and the door, melting away all evil, degenerate, darkness, filth, and undead auras.</p><p>The full blood moon on Klarman’s forehead was clearly affected. All the light beams were compressed to his side, preventing him from affecting his surroundings.</p><p>Seizing this opportunity, Sharron’s figure that appeared in midair distorted, turning into a human-sized puppet.</p><p>This puppet was identical to Shaman King Klarman. It had messy, black-and-white hair and a pair of bright red eyes.</p><p>As for Emlyn, he raised his left arm and revealed a translucent ring that was worn outside his gloved index finger.</p><p>The ring seemed to be made of light-red amber, and there was a blood-colored gem embedded on it.</p><p>Lilith’s Ring!</p><p>This was a ring personally made by the Sanguine Ancestor, the ancient goddess, Lilith.</p><p>It could project a door that led deep into the spirit world for a certain amount of time, summoning an unknown creature.</p><p>Emlyn wasn’t sure what he would obtain. He only knew that, under normal circumstances, the summoned object was usually slightly stronger than him, but the possibility of directly pulling out a demigod wasn’t impossible.</p><p>At the tip of the ring, the blood-colored gem emitted a faint glow as an illusory door covered in mysterious patterns appeared in front of Emlyn.</p><p>The door creaked open, the gap in the door widening.</p><p>Shaman King Klarman had just recovered his senses from the Sun’s illumination when he saw a moon rise up behind the Door of Summoning.</p><p>It was a bright moon, one that was slightly silver in color.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
