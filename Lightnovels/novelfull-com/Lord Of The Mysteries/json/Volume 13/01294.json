All her senses vanished in the areas that it passed, leaving only her still thoughts.</p><p>It was inevitable that a person would hallucinate in extreme cold temperatures. In Fors’s vision, a night sky instantly appeared. It was dotted with countless stars that weaved together to form a dream-like river.</p><p>Fors’s body began reflecting bits of stellar radiance as if they came from her own body.</p><p>The tiny bits of pure stellar radiance formed an invisible connection with the different stars in the night sky. As the light shimmered, they twisted and squirmed as insect-like creatures crawled out of Fors’s body. They wanted to seek refuge in the Milky Way formed by an array of embedded diamond shards.</p><p>Each of them carried a portion of their own flesh and consciousness, as though they were uncontrollable avatars.</p><p>Fors’s thoughts quickly turned chaotic, and she fell into confusion. She almost couldn’t control the urge to separate herself.</p><p>At that moment, she sensed an illusory object.</p><p>It was the seal that she had completed using the Devil’s Oil Painting. It was projected into the mysterious world created by the potion, forming an abstract, blurry mark.</p><p>Fors didn’t think further as she instinctively extended a portion of her consciousness along with her spirituality, and intertwined with the abstract symbol.</p><p>The mark wasn’t exactly harmonious with her, as if it wasn’t part of her, but it managed to barely merge with her.</p><p>Suddenly, in Fors’s mind, the abstract symbol became rather clear. It consisted of a “door” that was layered with mysterious symbols.</p><p>This door hid Fors behind it, allowing her to isolate herself from the surrounding cosmos.</p><p>At the same time, on the other side of the “door,” the sealed creature seemed to sense the aura of an enemy. Using its own godhood, it wildly corroded the illusory door. It happened to be able to reduce the influence the cosmos had on Fors.</p><p>After maintaining it for more than ten seconds, the resplendent Milky Way’s night sky slowly faded away. The stellar radiance then returned to Fors’s body fused with her.</p><p>At this moment, a deep darkness appeared in front of Fors. Deep in the darkness was a perpetual storm and occasionally flashing lightning.</p><p>The next second, Fors heard a familiar voice. It stabbed into her head like steel nails stirring her brain matter.</p><p>Fors grimaced immediately. If she hadn’t experienced such things over and over in the past, and had some level of resistance, as well as the fact that she was at the saint level, she would have likely lost control.</p><p>Of course, there had to be some influence of “good luck” here.</p><p>After a few seconds, she finally managed to calm herself down and hear what the voice was shouting by using Cogitation.</p><p>It was calling for help!</p><p>It wasn’t Jotun, Elvish or ancient Hermes. Instead, it was a language that Fors had never come into contact with before. However, she could understand it the moment she heard it. She felt like it was the true source of many languages.</p><p>Mr. Door would crazily shout for help every full moon. How disgraceful of a King of Angels… However, even if “He” is seeking help, it’s still a terrifying thing that I can’t withstand… Fors lampooned silently. She was considering if she should pretend not to hear it and wait until she had converged her spirituality and grasped the Beyonder powers of a Secrets Sorcerer before conversing with Mr. Door during the next full moon, or to do it now.</p><p>Suddenly, the shouts from afar stopped and the surroundings became deathly silent.</p><p>After two to three seconds, a wispy voice that could pierce through Spirit Bodies entered Fors’s mind.</p><p>“You used the Beyonder characteristics of the Abraham family.”</p><p>This sentence was said in a flat manner without any rise or fall, but it made the blood vessels on Fors’s forehead throb. Her eyes turned bloodshot as her body turned resplendent.</p><p>She almost lost control of herself.</p><p>“Who are you?” Fors composed herself and asked deliberately.</p><p>The voice that seemed to lure her into losing control said in a low smiling voice, “You can call me Mr. Door.</p><p>“You should be familiar with me.”</p><p>The King of Angels from the Fourth Epoch directly pointed out that Fors had a certain connection with “Him.” She could hear the full moon ravings.</p><p>…I’m going to write you into a novel! Fors secretly gritted her teeth and asked, “Honorable Mr. Door, are you the ancestor of the Abraham family, Your Excellency Bethel?”</p><p>The voice that had crossed countless barriers returned to its flatness.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Then, do you know that your cry for ‘help’ has caused the entire Abraham family to be trapped in a curse that has lasted for more than a thousand years? It’s basically impossible for anyone to become a Traveler or even a Scribe? They often lose control during advancements or the night of the full moon.” Fors felt that she couldn’t speak to Mr. Door for a long time; otherwise, her inclination towards losing control would be irreversible. She directly posed the question that the Abrahams were most concerned about.</p><p>Mr. Door fell silent for two seconds before saying, “They no longer have Secrets Sorcerer or demigods?”</p><p>“There aren’t any after the War of the Four Emperors. And the curse you brought has made it impossible for them to advance to a demigod. If you can stop crying for help for ten years, a new Abraham demigod might be born. This will greatly aid in your escape,” Fors sincerely suggested.</p><p>Mr. Door sighed and said, “I have been exiled to an eternal darkness, and suffer the blockage of a perpetual storm. I have no way to know what’s happening in the real world, nor did I expect that there isn’t a single demigod left in the entire Abraham family.”</p><p>Lies… The one who calmly made this conclusion wasn’t Fors, but rather Klein, who had accommodated The Fool’s card as he held the Staff of the Stars while sitting in Sefirah Castle. He had been closely monitoring the corresponding crimson star.</p><p>He remembered that the Emperor had mentioned in his diary that Mr. Door had a certain understanding of reality. “He” seemed to be able to use the changes brought about by the full moon to see the situation outside the seal.</p><p>After sighing, Mr. Door continued, “Besides, I can’t control the cries for help during the full moon.”</p><p>“Why?” Fors asked in surprise.</p><p>Mr. Door said in an ethereal voice, “You’re already a demigod, so you should know very well that the higher the Sequence, the greater the threat of going mad.</p><p>“An ordinary angel, even those who can walk the land freely and do what they like, without needing to engage in any additional battles, could also be gradually influenced by the Beyonder characteristics and become less like themselves. They might even enter a half-crazy state. I’m a King of Angels who has been exiled and sealed for more than a thousand years, and I don’t even have someone to communicate with. My not going crazy means that I’m sufficiently powerful and lucky.</p><p>“On each full moon, the madness in me will be strengthened. I can’t control it and can only constantly call for help.”</p><p>So that’s how it is… If I were locked up like this, I might’ve gone crazy in a few months… Uh, if I’m provided alcohol, newspapers, magazines, all kinds of books, and various delicacies, I can last a year—no, half a year… Fors nodded in enlightenment and asked in a perfunctory manner, “Is there anything I can do for you? How can the Abrahams dispel the curse?”</p><p>Mr. Door fell silent for a few seconds before saying, “Set up a ritual and help me escape. That way, the curse will cease to exist.</p><p>“There are two rituals that can be used. One is to sacrifice three demigods that are respectively from the Seer, Apprentice, and Marauder pathway… The other is to extract the blood of at least ninety-nine Beyonders from the Abraham family. Use it to draw such a symbol…”</p><p>“…I’ll tell them,” Fors immediately replied.</p><p>At the same time, she added inwardly, That’s if Mr. Fool permits it.</p><p>Mr. Door laughed and said, “If I can escape because of this, I will help you become an angel…”</p><p>“His” voice became more ethereal and weaker, as though “He” was slowly returning to “His” original state as Fors advancement came to an end.</p><p>About two to three seconds later, Fors couldn’t hear the sounds that slowly pushed her onto the path of losing control. The deep darkness and horrifying storms in front of her also vanished.</p><p>However, before the scene completely faded away, Fors could vaguely see that, on a vast land formed from dark red rocks, there was an ancient building that resembled a pyramid erected there. Behind the building was a deep darkness and twinkling stars. It was completely different from the cosmos that she had seen as an Astrologer on the ground.</p><p>What’s this? Fors shook her head and controlled her scattered thoughts as she began to carefully rein her spirituality back.</p><p>After getting accustomed to the state of a Secrets Sorcerer, she immediately took on a praying posture and reported her previous experiences to Mr. Fool without missing anything.</p><p>After doing this, Fors put away the Devil’s Oil Painting, “Teleported” back to Pritz Harbor, and met her teacher, Dorian Gray Abraham, who was waiting in the warehouse.</p><p>Seeing that his student was safe and sound, Dorian heaved a sigh of relief and said in a pious manner, “Thanks to Mr. Fool for ‘His’ blessings.”</p><p>He had finally taught a Sequence 4 Secrets Sorcerer who didn’t show signs of betrayal.</p><p>Due to Mr. Fool’s lack of response, Fors didn’t inform her teacher of her conversation with Mr. Door. She planned on waiting until the next full moon.</p><p>She also relaxed and smiled.</p><p>“Apart from thanking Mr. Fool, I have to thank you, Teacher.”</p><p>…</p><p>In the ancient palace above the fog.</p><p>Klein didn’t have any doubts about Mr. Door calling “Himself” half-crazy. He only felt that there had to be more secrets hidden in the matter. For example, why did Mr. Door keep enticing Emperor Roselle to visit the moon? It was a place that was occupied by an Outer Deity.</p><p>After some thought, he took out the Scarlet Lunar Corona and Master Key from the fog of history. He planned on creating a full moon environment and listening to Mr. Door’s shouting.</p><p>The effects of the combination had long been confirmed. Klein quickly heard the voice that seemed to pierce through his Spirit Body.</p><p>The content of the shouting was:</p><p>“Don’t save me… Don’t save me…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
