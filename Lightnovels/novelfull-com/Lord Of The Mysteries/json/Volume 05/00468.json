And I am key in this  matter. My mission was to pray to The Fool!”</p><p>Hearing the undisguised and detailed response, Klein, who had  prepared his answers, was at quite a loss on where to begin. This  vampire, Emlyn White, had explained everything he wanted to know.</p><p><em>A revelation from the Ancestor… Didn’t the ancient goddess Lilith  perish in the Second Epoch, long before the Cataclysm, and have her  authority taken back by the Creator? It was precisely because of this  that quite a number of vampires tried to pray to the Primordial Moon,  resulting in an extremely tragic outcome… Moreover, Mr. Door had also  mentioned that the “The Moon” card is empty, indicating that, on the one  hand, the Primordial Moon is most likely the embodiment of some other  deity or powerful devil, while on the other hand, it indirectly proves  that the ancient goddess Lilith has lost her Sequence 0 position, which  is generally equivalent to dying…</em> Klein instantly connected the dots.</p><p>He originally imagined that “Lilith,” who responded to the Sanguine’s  prayers on particular matters, was a relic from the ancient goddess,  such as the “Uniqueness” of “The Moon” pathway. Thus, it would be rigid,  passive, and extremely restrictive, but now, its initiative of  providing a revelation had overturned his guess.</p><p><em>Two possibilities. One is that Lilith is being impersonated by  another deity who has occupied a key point ahead of time, preventing any  opponents from reaching Sequence 0 of The Moon’s pathway. In essence,  the entity doesn’t care about the Sanguine, and the provided revelation  is a kind of test. The greatest suspect is the Goddess who had snatched  the title of Lady of Crimson, but “She’s” already Sequence 0,  corresponding to “The Star” in the Cards of Blasphemy. Why would she  covet “The Moon?” Is it to foil the plans of her enemy?</em></p><p><em>The second possibility is that the ancient goddess hasn’t fully  perished. As long as no other powerhouse has become Sequence 0 in the  Moon pathway, “She” is able to use a unique and incomprehensible method  to continue surviving, waiting for a chance to make her return, just  like the Dark Emperor card’s description. And perhaps the Goddess had  taken the title of Lady of Crimson to foil this situation to a certain  extent…</em></p><p><em>Going by this logic, Lilith’s recent apocalyptic revelation is  “Her” struggle to revive after years of preparation. And The Fool plays a  key role in “Her” revelation. If that’s true, then in a certain way,  it’s an invitation for “cooperation”… But I’m just a Sequence 6  Beyonder, so how am I to cooperate with a yet-to-disappear ancient  goddess?</em></p><p><em>Let Emlyn White join the Tarot Club? The Sanguine are a race with  a long lifespan. They have existed since the Second Epoch and must know  quite a number of secrets… However, that would be me taking quite a  risk. Yes, it would be possible to divine whether or not to pull Emlyn  into each gathering ahead of time…</em></p><p><em>Yes, there was a similar apocalyptic prophecy in the Sights in  the Spirit World from Yellow Light Venithan. “He” also pointed out that  the Abraham family’s curse would be removed by an Apprentice who has the  help of a hidden existence. This matches Miss Magician’s present stage.  She is an Apprentice who has received the help of me, The Fool… That’s  rather interesting. Has every high-level being that’s good at prophecies  realized that the apocalypse is unavoidable and have seen The Fool’s  existence and his possible effects?</em></p><p>One thought after another flashed through Klein’s mind, but his expression didn’t change at all.</p><p>He leaned back in his chair and smiled leisurely.</p><p>“What did your Ancestor ask you to pray to me for?”</p><p>The calm voice pulled Emlyn out of his stupor, and he shook his head in a slightly dazed manner.</p><p>“I don’t know…”</p><p>At this moment, Klein saw the stars behind Emlyn’s chair shift quickly, turning into the symbol of the crimson moon.</p><p><em>As expected, the Beyonder pathway of the descendants of the ancient goddess, Lilith, points towards the “Moon”…</em> Klein  chuckled and said, “In a situation with the seven orthodox gods and so  many secret existences, why would your Ancestor think that I would be  the key to the apocalypse?”</p><p>The Fool’s attitude finally made Emlyn White calm down, realizing  that he had encountered an incredible event. He had been forcefully  pulled into a magical place by a hidden existence!</p><p><em>“He” is The Fool…”He” isn’t actually angry… Is it because I  represent the Ancestor? I, Emlyn White, am indeed special. I was  mentioned by the Ancestor, and I received a response from The Fool…</em> With  this in mind, Emlyn couldn’t help but sit up straighter before saying  in deliberation, “Honorable Mr. Fool, the revelation provided by the  Ancestor is this. I, Emlyn White, will become the key in saving the  Sanguine and clinching victory against the apocalypse. And all of this  will begin from my praying to you.”</p><p>The meaning behind his words was: <em>the key to the apocalypse isn’t you, but me!</em></p><p><em>This fellow has such a “eighth-grader syndrome <sup>1</sup> ” side to him… That’s right. He has always been very arrogant and feels self-important…</em> Klein lampooned silently with a popular phrase from the past.</p><p>Amused, he said, “The same question, why me and not the seven orthodox gods or the other hidden entities?”</p><p>“… I don’t know.” Emlyn shook his head honestly.</p><p>Klein thought for a moment, then he deliberately said, “Actually, I  think I understand your ancestor’s intentions. ‘She’ wishes that, with  my help, you’re able to grow into a true high-level entity and save the  Sanguine when the apocalypse happens.”</p><p>“Grow?” Emlyn said in puzzlement, “As you know, us Sanguine have no  way of growing on our own. Only through special ceremonies will we gain  the bestowment of our elders and relics of the Ancestor that allow our  advancement.”</p><p><em>Indeed, it has to be in accordance with the Law of Beyonder  Characteristics Conservation… In other words, there have to be other  ways as long as the basic law is abided to…</em> Klein chuckled.</p><p>“Your knowledge has blinded you, making you unable to see the wider world.</p><p>“Of course, this question will not be answered by me. The answer must  be found by you. I will only provide you with an opportunity.”</p><p>He paused for a second, then he said in a condescending manner, “Do you wish for such an opportunity?”</p><p>Without any hesitation, Emlyn got up and bowed.</p><p>“That is what I wish for!”</p><p><em>Heh, where did your arrogance go when facing a hidden existence? Why is there only humility?</em> Klein secretly lampooned as he tapped the edge of the mottled long table and said, “But you have to adhere to certain matters.”</p><p>“Please speak.” Emlyn held back his excitement.</p><p>Klein smiled and replied, “You cannot reveal anything related to me to anyone unless you gain my permission.</p><p>“This includes the Sanguine who were previously present at the ritual.”</p><p>“But…” Emlyn was somewhat unable to accept the request.</p><p>Klein asked warmly in a very certain manner, “It’s likely that Lilith didn’t get you to report to anyone afterward?”</p><p>This could be inferred from the fact that there was no prayer content in the revelation!</p><p><em>Li…”He” directly called the Ancestor by “Her” name… It sounds like they’re old friends…</em> Emlyn’s heart trembled. He lowered his head and replied, “No.”</p><p>Klein said with an unperturbed smile, “This is a secret deal, which  is why I responded after you were free from surveillance. Similarly, you  don’t need to report this to Lilith as it will let certain people  notice it.”</p><p>Seeing Emlyn nod in understanding, Klein added, “If you want to be  the key to saving the Sanguine, you must suffer the pain of the  corresponding thorns. For example, you will not be understood by others,  be slandered, and looked down upon. You can only silently proceed  forward in the darkness while being burdened by your heavy mission.”</p><p>The words that were aimed at him made Emlyn White imagine a corresponding scenario.</p><p>He, who was always mocked by his kinsmen because of his fondness of  dolls, had gotten lost and entered the Harvest Church. Stained with  traces of shame, he, who had never been valued and thought highly of by  his elders, would silently guard his race from the corner, protecting  everyone without anyone knowing…</p><p>Very soon, Emlyn, who had moved himself, respectfully replied, “Your will will pass through the earth.”</p><p>Klein leaned back and said very lightly, “I tacitly consented to the  establishment of a secret gathering, and it is held right here.</p><p>“Are you willing to join this gathering in search for the method to become powerful to save the Sanguine?”</p><p>“I am!” Emlyn replied without any hesitation.</p><p>Klein nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>“Do you have any other requests?”</p><p>Emlyn was overjoyed. He said in a hurry, “Honorable Mr. Fool, I would  like you to help me dispel the psychological cue in me. A bishop of the  Church of Earth Mother…”</p><p>“I know.” Klein calmly interrupted him.</p><p><em>He knows… As expected of a hidden existence…</em> Emlyn’s head lowered again.</p><p>Klein let out a soft chuckle.</p><p>“I can help you, but what price are you willing to pay for this?”</p><p>Above the gray fog, he had a very potent Spirit Vision, and he had  previously discovered that the dark-colored psychological cue within  Emlyn White’s Spirit Body had at some point mostly dissipated, thinning  out to the point of frailty.</p><p>Klein had intended to resolve the problem by referring to the ritual  used to resolve similar problems in the Book of Secrets, but the  situation now led him to believe that a secret deed ritual with the Dark  Emperor card and the purification of the Sun Brooch would thoroughly  disperse Emlyn White’s psychological cue.</p><p><em>Price?</em> Emlyn thought about it for a moment, but he couldn’t think of anything that would interest a secret existence like The Fool.</p><p>Seeing this, Klein took the initiative to say, “I’m very interested  in some of your Sanguine history. You can use that in exchange.”</p><p><em>The Sanguine’s history?</em> After a moment’s thought, Emlyn agreed.</p><p>“You can think about what you would like to describe first. Heh heh.  Before that, you need to choose a code name from them.” Klein conjured  the unselected Major Arcana tarot cards on the surface of the long  bronze table.</p><p>Emlyn White scrutinized the cards with interest and said, “The Moon.</p><p>“I choose ‘The Moon’ card!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
