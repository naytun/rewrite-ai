Some kept going in circles on the spot, while others stood on the spot, trembling uncontrollably. There were all kinds of different reactions.</p><p>Unlike previously when he was afraid that Wormtongue Mithor would recover, making it necessary to make every second count, Klein had plenty of time to observe his surroundings at that moment. He instantly grasped the situation.</p><p><em>Different reactions stem from their mental fortitude and resilience. The weakest and most ordinary ones were the ones who ran wildly. Those with relatively stronger mental fortitude among the ordinary people would run about aimlessly. For Beyonders, who had their psyche enhanced, as well as ordinary people who had strong mental fortitudes, they would circle around on the spot, trying to escape but stopping themselves as well. The strong Beyonders with strong mental fortitude would stand on the spot as they tremble or go around in circles on the spot.</em></p><p><em>Those who suffer from incontinence as a result of fear belong to the escaping and avoiding group…</em></p><p>Klein swept his gaze and was about to raise his gun to shoot, making the enemies who could threaten him lose the ability to do combat.</p><p>At this moment, he discovered that a man who had been trembling on the spot had recovered the clarity in his eyes. He was about to escape the influence of Awe, as for the others, they were also showing symptoms of recovering.</p><p>Considering how he didn’t have the ability to finish all of them off in such a short period of time, and how a gunshot would jolt a number of them back to their senses, as well as how different Beyonders, when combining their different powers together, could cause him harm, Klein changed his mind and made the glove on his left palm be tainted with a sinister, reflective blackness.</p><p>His eyes turned dark as he forcefully distorted the intents of the people who were waking up.</p><p>The trembling man pounced forward suddenly. He could no longer resist his thoughts of fleeing. He ran straight for the secret exit, leaving his employer, Strongman Ozil, as a constantly shrinking back.</p><p>Klein rapidly switched between Psychiatrist and Baron of Corruption, using Dragon’s Might followed by Distortion as he repeated this sequence. Soon, and he chased all the mentally Ozil’s strong or resilient bouncers to the basement.</p><p>Although there was no way of comparing Creeping Hunger to a genuine Shepherd, switching between different souls required a certain amount of time to cooldown, Klein grasped this rhythm very well. He easily completed his goal while there were still some remnant effects from Dragon’s Might.</p><p>However, he also discovered a problem. For certain targets, if they were repeatedly exposed to Dragon’s Might and Awe within a short period of time, the effects would weaken with repeated use. Of course, most of Strongman Ozil’s subordinates were already slumped on the ground after repeatedly being hit by Dragon’s Might. They were pissing and defecating themselves, emitting a stench.</p><p><em>Dragon’s Might and Distortion are quite a good combination… If Mithor hadn’t tried to counterattack, he could’ve escaped with Bribe—Weaken and Distortion, and I might not have necessarily been able to catch up to him and finish him off. Yes, that counterattack of his was very potent. There weren’t any signs prior to it. If it wasn’t due to a Seer and Clown’s reliance on their spirituality and intuition, I might not have been able to use Paper Figurine Substitutes in time, much less talk about dodging the strike.</em></p><p><em>This reminds me that even though Creeping Hunger provides the combat strength of a Sequence 5, I shouldn’t belittle other Sequence 6s. A careless mistake might have me killed…</em></p><p>Amidst his thoughts, Klein made the glove turn as though it was gilded. His eyes suddenly lit up with two bolts of lightning.</p><p>Strongman Ozil immediately cried out in pain as he couldn’t bear it anymore. He crashed to the ground like a toppling mountain peak. He held his head as he struggled in pain like a catfish that had just been caught.</p><p><em>Unfortunately, I don’t have Beyonder powers that can perform an area-of-effect attack. Otherwise, I’d be able to keep the other Beyonders back… I remember that there’s a Lightning Storm in the Sea King’s domain… However, such charms are of too high a level. It exceeds the realm of my knowledge…</em> Klein swept his gaze across all the goons before unhurriedly walking to the basement.</p><p>This place was originally a market, but with everyone fleeing, it was empty.</p><p>Dressed in his double-breasted frock coat, Klein pulled a chair out from behind a stall. He placed it before Ozil and leisurely sat down. He leaned forward as he observed the boss of the Amyris Leaf Bar without a word.</p><p>After Ozil tumbled around for a while, he finally recovered from the pain that nearly made him lose control. However, he still suffered from a splitting headache.</p><p>He was just about to stand up when he saw a pair of pale-colored eyes that reflected pale gold light. He saw a glove covered in dark golden scales.</p><p>In that instant, cold sweat was still dripping from his forehead. He felt that one maelstrom after another was appearing in his eyes, sucking in all his attention.</p><p>Klein calmly asked, “Were you once a pirate?”</p><p>“Yes.” Ozil realized that he had the strong intention of answering the man.</p><p>This was a Psychological Cue!</p><p>Klein asked again without a change in tone, “What deeds have you done in the past that violate the kingdom’s laws?”</p><p>Ozil didn’t hide anything from him. He simply explained what he had done as a pirate and as the boss of the Amyris Leaf Bar. It included his plundering of liners, raping female passengers, and killing the innocent. This included striking down competitors and kidnapping their family members, setting ambushes to sink an entire family to the bottom of the ocean.</p><p>Klein listened to all of this in silence, and the corners of his mouth curled up slowly. He clapped his left palm against his right hand and said, “What a competent pirate and passable gang boss.”</p><p>Amidst his praise, he extended his left hand as a ferocious mouth opened up on the thin human skin.</p><p>Shrill screams resounded in the basement, but it stopped after a few seconds. All that was left were echoes.</p><p>Klein sat in his seat, watching silently as the bright points of light slowly gathered in front of him.</p><p>Around him, all the goons who were suffering from incontinence instinctively distanced themselves from him. As they crawled, they left stains on the ground.</p><p>Moments later, Klein slowly stood up. He bent down to pick up a pure spherical light that was the size of a baby’s fist, as well as the wallet inside Ozil’s clothes.</p><p>After stealing a glance at the thickness of the wad of cash, he put away the two items and holstered his revolver. He took off his half top hat and bowed at the trembling goons in the corner.</p><p>Klein checked the underground area after he was done with everything. To his regret, he didn’t discover any items like a safe. All he could do was return via the passageway, pick up Wormtongue Mithor King’s corpse, and walk to the entrance.</p><p>He paused for two seconds as the scene outside was naturally outlined in his mind. He discovered that the bouncers, who he imagined would attempt to open the door to provide help, had already disappeared.</p><p><em>The Dragon’s Might from just now made them realize that it’s a battle between Beyonders, so they retreated? As expected of a region where pirates are everywhere. Some ordinary people still have a chance of understanding about Beyonders… It seems such matters happen often here? Some fugitive suddenly gets arrested by the Mandated Punishers?</em> Klein undid the metal chains and reached for Mithor King’s pocket in passing and took his cash.</p><p>He held back the urge to count his earnings as he burned a paper figurine and threw it outside before opening the door to the entrance. He then walked out with Mithor’s corpse.</p><p>At this moment, most of the customers in the bar were gone. There were only about eight people hiding in different spots to await the outcome.</p><p>Klein surveyed the area without any expression as he saw gazes frantically retract.</p><p>The only person who dared to look at him head-on was Oz Kent. he was frowning as he watched Gehrman Sparrow carry a corpse over slowly.</p><p><em>Bang!</em></p><p>The corpse flew in front of him, smashing over a table.</p><p>Oz Kent focused his gaze as his pupils instantly contracted.</p><p><em>Wormtongue Mithor King! Vice Admiral Ailment’s third mate, Mithor King!</em> He looked up in shock, stealing another glance at Gehrman Sparrow.</p><p>Klein revealed a faint smile.</p><p>“Remember my bounty.”</p><p>With that said, he took his half top hat, bowed slightly as a form of bidding farewell, and turned to leave through the Amyris Leaf Bar’s main door.</p><p>…</p><p>Bayam Harbor. On the White Agate.</p><p>Elland watched as the door to his captain’s cabin was slammed open. He asked in surprise, “Kent, what happened?”</p><p>Oz Kent questioned him with a warped expression, “Elland, what kind of monster did you introduce me to?”</p><p>“… Gehrman Sparrow?” Elland returned with a question, feeling somewhat uncertain.</p><p>Oz Kent nodded.</p><p>“He killed Wormtongue and Strongman without batting an eye, right inside Amyris Leaf Bar, right in front of me! It didn’t even take him five minutes!”</p><p>He felt like he was going crazy.</p><p>“Mithor King?” Elland asked, but he sounded like he was repeating the name to himself.</p><p>Then, he revealed a rueful smile.</p><p>“From the looks of it, we have to report to the higher-ups.”</p><p>He didn’t mention Blazing Danitz nor Steel Maveti’s death.</p><p>“Alright!” Oz Kent was waiting for him to say that.</p><p>At three in the afternoon, inside a garden building near the governor-general’s office.</p><p>Elland and Oz Kent were sitting in an elegantly decorated living room as they awaited the reply from an important figure.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, a young man with neatly combed back blond hair walked down the staircase and said to the two, “The General says that since he temporarily doesn’t show any animosity, we should honor the agreement and continue our cooperation from before. However, we must be careful. Send a telegram back to Backlund and secretly investigate his true identity and intentions here at sea.</p><p>“Also, spread the news that he killed Mithor King. To the pirates.”</p><p>“Yes, Mr. Luan.” After receiving clear instructions, Elland and Oz Kent immediately heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the inn, Klein did a divination and counted his cash, confirming that he had received 327 pounds 9 soli 5 pence, and a Beyonder characteristic from a Sequence 8 Pugilist from the Warrior pathway.</p><p><em>This is also an item worth six to seven hundred pounds… Furthermore, there’s Mithor’s bounty. Even if I deduct the “labor fees,” there will still be several thousand pounds. Heh, Oz Kent might not dare to take his cut… This is quite a good harvest. It’s like a windfall!</em> Klein thought in comfort before holding a ritual, sending Creeping Hunger up to the gray fog.</p><p>To be frank, he felt that Dragon’s Might, Frenzy, and Psychological Cue were three rather useful Beyonder powers that he couldn’t bear to part with. However, since he had already promised Miss Justice, he ultimately chose to abide by his promise.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
