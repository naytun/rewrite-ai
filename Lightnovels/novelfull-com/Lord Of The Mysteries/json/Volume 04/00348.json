His eyes were dark and green, and while  possessing no emotion, there were no signs of pain!</p><p><em>Wraith Steve!</em></p><p>He turned his head and looked maliciously at Klein, who was at the top of the warehouse.</p><p>Klein was startled as he felt his body suddenly turn cold. Even the heat brought by the Sun Brooch couldn’t counteract it.</p><p>His body stiffened quickly, and his eyes glazed over. His pupils  reflected the same two figures: a black tuxedo, a dark red cloak, a head  of hair slathered with oil, a pair of dark green eyes, and the pale  face of a man in his forties!</p><p>Almost in an instant, Klein was placed under Steve’s control, his thoughts gradually numbing.</p><p>This was the ability of a Sequence 5 Wraith!</p><p>It was a strange and hardly defensible ability!</p><p>Fortunately, he was adequately aware of everything beforehand and was  already prepared for it. Moreover, the exorcism effect could  effectively resist the possession of evil spiritual beings, so before  his ability to think had completely disappeared, he stimulated the  spirituality of his Spirit Body and injected it into the dark golden  Sunbird brooch.</p><p>Just as he was about to raise his hand to grab hold of his neck, a warm and pure ray of light suddenly descended from the sky.</p><p>It was like a pillar of light from the Sun, bringing with it a  feeling of brilliance and holy purification as it enveloped Klein  within.</p><p>It was a spell from the Sun domain, Holy Light Summoning!</p><p>Amidst the holy light, the formless possession ability was weakened, and Klein’s eyes suddenly regained their luster.</p><p>In close succession, his body ignited, becoming brittle and charred, leaving behind a thin piece of paper.</p><p>At the same time, between the gaps of the two warehouses, Klein, in  his double-breasted frock coat and matching silk half top hat, jumped  out of the roaring flames from the previous explosion.</p><p>His cane had been thrown away somewhere long ago, and the same figure  floating above his head had also been successfully destroyed by the  flames. It turned into pieces of ashes and scattered in every direction.</p><p>Before Klein could confirm his situation, he felt an invisible grip on his ankle.</p><p>There was a firm grip on his calves, arms, chest, and clothes!</p><p>In his Spirit Vision which had long been activated, Klein saw blurry,  transparent figures. Some of them were incomplete, some were covered in  blood, some of them had burnt black skin, and others were pale and  cold.</p><p><em>Phew…</em> A cold wind of unknown origins blew at his neck, making his hair stand on end and made his body tremble uncontrollably.</p><p>The dark golden Sunbird brooch in front of him suddenly flashed with a  brilliant light, and golden illusory flames started flaring up around  him one after another!</p><p>These flames emitted the aura of the sun, and because they were so dense, they formed a sea.</p><p>This was the “Fire of Light” from the Sun domain!</p><p>The ghastly ghosts around Klein shrieked silently and vanished, and  the cold wind at the back of his head was replaced by the scorching heat  of the Sun Brooch.</p><p>Klein, who was temporarily safe in this environment, couldn’t help but sigh in fear.</p><p>Even though he had prepared ahead of time and had obtained items to  counter his opponent, a one on one battle with a Sequence 5 Wraith was  still precarious. The “performance” had almost ended in failure from the  very beginning!</p><p>Not too far away from Maric, the dark red-cloaked Steve’s figure  turned slightly incorporeal. The bright flames on his left arm were  quickly extinguished under the onslaught of the black aura.</p><p>His eyes shone with dark green light, filled with malice and desire. He seemed to have lost his mind and ability to think.</p><p>At this moment, with the shot’s warning, Maric had distanced himself  and directed the numb-faced zombies who had crawled out of the earth to  surround Werewolf Tyre. He created slippery layers of ice and rotting  sludge in an attempt to affect his enemy’s movements.</p><p>Werewolf Tyre held onto the tiny full moon that was emitting crimson  light as he ran without stopping. When he was blocked by a zombie, he  casually swiped down.</p><p><em>Whoosh!</em></p><p>The zombie was immediately split into six pieces. The long rotten flesh and wriggling maggots sprinkled all over the ground.</p><p>Werewolf Tyre froze for a moment, looking at his claws in disbelief.</p><p>Only then did he understand that the augmentation that the Scarlet Lunar Corona brought him wasn’t only restricted to speed.</p><p>He felt that he had mastered some powerful and strange spell!</p><p>Tyre stopped running and turned to face the pale Maric.</p><p>At this moment, Zombie Jason was drawing closer to the illusory but  mysterious door. His body was covered with dark-green vines that had  protruded from the faces of the babies. He was being dragged by arms  that were either full of teeth or were skinless.</p><p>His eyes were almost touching the crack of the bronze door as he stared coldly at the indescribable eyes hidden in the darkness.</p><p>It was as if that place was the final resting place for his heart.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>His body, which was controlled by bloodlust and the desire to kill, shouted out shrilly.</p><p>Werewolf Tyre, who was about to counterattack, stopped  instantaneously. Clenching his teeth, he threw the miniature version of  the crimson full moon at Steve.</p><p>Only by allowing a Sequence 5 Beyonder to regain his strength would  he be augmented, allowing the battle to come to a quick end. Only then  would Jason have a chance of being rescued!</p><p>Upon seeing this, Klein’s eyes lit up, and he immediately snapped his fingers.</p><p><em>Pa!</em></p><p><em>Boom!</em></p><p>In the Scarlet Lunar Corona’s trajectory, a pre-buried explosive  threw up the soil, blew out a strong impactful gust of wind, and set off  a scarlet flame.</p><p>Being struck by this, the Scarlet Lunar Corona was redirected and landed in another direction.</p><p><em>Boom!</em></p><p>Another explosive blew up, inducing a fiery light to rise up. Klein  leaped up and pounced at the Scarlet Lunar Corona which wasn’t too far  from him.</p><p>Suddenly, a pale palm appeared right in front of the Scarlet Lunar Corona’s landing spot and grabbed it.</p><p>It was none other than Steve, who had disappeared and then reappeared!</p><p>His instincts made him chase after the full moon!</p><p><em>Pa!</em> With a soft sound, Steve grabbed the Scarlet Lunar  Corona. His dark green eyes, which were full of malice and desire,  gained a trace of spiritual luster. This caused him to return from the  form of a pure wraith to a Sequence 5 powerhouse.</p><p>He smirked at Klein.</p><p>He wasn’t in a hurry to deal with this weak opponent, so he let his figure disappear once more.</p><p>Klein, who had already thrown himself out, rolled twice, reached into  his pocket with his left hand, and once again gently flipped open the  iron cigarette case. He touched Rosago’s All-Black Eye.</p><p>Amidst the ravings that caused his tears and snot to constantly flow,  Klein saw more strange black lines, and from their origin, he caught a  glimpse of the invisible Steve.</p><p>He was closing in on Sharron, who was slumped to the ground weakly,  at high speeds. He wanted to control her, rescue Jason, and put an end  to the battle.</p><p>Sharron was their main target for this operation!</p><p>Klein suddenly retracted his left hand, and with a thought, he once again injected his spirituality into the Sun Brooch.</p><p>2! 1!</p><p>A holy beam of light descended from the sky, enveloping Sharron from behind.</p><p>Steve, who was wearing a dark red cloak, suddenly appeared a few meters away, barely avoiding the holy light.</p><p>With the augmentation of the Scarlet Lunar Corona, his speed was  already frightening to the point of him being capable of effectively  dodging in an instant!</p><p>But at the same time, the genuflecting Klein had raised his right hand and pulled the trigger of the revolver.</p><p>His target was Jason!</p><p>A resplendent bullet flew out, aimed directly at Jason’s back, and was about to “help” him enter the bronze door of mystery.</p><p>But at that moment, Steve disappeared and reappeared behind Jason, blocking the bullet with his open left palm.</p><p><em>Sizzle!</em></p><p>The sunlight from the explosion made him shake his arm in pain. He  narrowed his eyes as his skin was constantly charring and peeling, but  it quickly healed.</p><p>Suddenly, he heard a crisp sound!</p><p>Klein had snapped his fingers again!</p><p><em>Boom!</em></p><p>A nearby explosive exploded. The resulting shock wave and bullet-like stones shot out in all directions.</p><p>A large number of them landed on Jason’s and Steve’s bodies!</p><p>“No!”</p><p>With a blood-curdling scream, the clothes on Jason’s side tore apart,  and the quickly-darkening white spots on his skin appeared as if fresh  blood was about to seep out.</p><p>To a Zombie with a body as hard as steel, this wasn’t an effective  injury, but to a person like Jason who was struggling to hold on, it was  equivalent to the beckoning of death.</p><p>He could no longer hold on as those terrifying arms quickly pulled him into the crack of the bronze door!</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Jason’s scream resounded into the distance as the mysterious and  illusory door closed with a clang, devouring the rest of his screams and  isolating it from the world!</p><p>The clearing in the middle of the warehouses turned completely  silent. Jason had completely disappeared, as though he had never been  born into this world.</p><p>Steve’s eyes widened, and he opened his mouth, letting out an angry screech, “Damn it!”</p><p><em>Bam!</em></p><p>As his voice resounded, Klein felt as if someone had heavily hammered  him in the head. His vision turned blurry, and whatever he breathed in  smelled of blood. His vision had become blood-red.</p><p>For a short time, his ears were filled with buzzing sounds, and he couldn’t hear anything else.</p><p>After Tyre delivered the Scarlet Lunar Corona, he had grown black fur  and sharp fangs. He was no longer immune to its effects and painfully  covered his ears. Blood even flowed out from the corner of his eyes and  mouth.</p><p>Maric, who should have seized the opportunity to grab him, was in an  even worse state. His desire and malice, which had been suppressed by  the sedative, had reared their heads once more, causing him to almost  lose control of his zombies. His expression was extremely twisted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
