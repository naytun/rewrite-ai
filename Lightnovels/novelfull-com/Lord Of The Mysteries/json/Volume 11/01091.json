He carefully sensed the speed at which the Bizarro Sorcerer potion was being digested.</p><p>It’s really fast. It’s even more than the first three months of my digestion combined… However, there’s nothing I can do about it. Before I received Life’s Cane, I couldn’t provide sufficient treatment. I have to make sure that the heart of the target can withstand the fright they experience, so as a result, I wasn’t able to go to the hospital to create an urban</p><p>Similarly, if it wasn’t for the fact that a war broke out, it would be rather difficult to find other demigods. Those whose whereabouts that I can confirm are mostly on their own home ground. To secretly invade and create a bizarre sense of horror will involve turning innocents into marionettes. Even if there’s no other choice, I wouldn’t have considered it… Klein shifted his attention away from himself and sighed silently.</p><p>He then repeated a word in his mind:</p><p>War…</p><p>At this moment, the street lamps in the distance were lit up. East Borough was pitch black with the occasional policemen patrolling the streets with lanterns.</p><p>In the past, these policemen wouldn’t have been so enthusiastic. Now that the war had broken out, they had to carry out the corresponding curfew orders to ensure that there was order and security.</p><p>“War…” Klein repeated the word softly again, and in a daze, he saw a part of the ending.</p><p>The Loen King, George III, has finally broken through the shackles. He’s no longer worried that any of the seven deities will strongly object to his apotheosis. He can officially push for the various rituals needed of Black Emperor. What follows will depend on himself, or should I say “Himself.” As long as “He” can withstand the impact of the potion, and as long as “He” can maintain “His” rationality, “He” would be able to ascend to the divine throne and advance to Sequence 0.</p><p>The Einhorn family of Feysac used this war that can embroil the entire world to allow its key members to significantly digest their potions, and without much difficulty, they can prepare the corresponding rituals and allow their family’s overall strength to be enhanced.</p><p>As for Amon’s brother, “He” can consume the potion during these tumultuous times and experience a transformation to become a Visionary, allowing this world to have another true god…</p><p>As Klein’s thoughts drifted, a question suddenly popped up in his mind:</p><p>Can I accept such an outcome?</p><p>Can I accept such an outcome… Klein opened his mouth and slowly closed it. Everything he saw seemed to pass through the limitations of time and space before returning to another place:</p><p>It was the extremely thick, slightly pungent, cold, and moist smog which was yellow and slightly iron-black in color which had permeated through the entirety of Backlund;</p><p>It was the tramps who were suffering from ailments, hunger, pain, and cold before being pushed to the brink of death. He was also struggling to survive. For the sake of food, he pushed himself with all his might, not daring to slack off at all. Finally, he saw the light of life. He bought his long-awaited ham, but in the hazy smog, he fell to the ground and never got up again;</p><p>She was a hardworking widow. In order to survive, and to provide for her two children, she had abandoned all her dignity and made herself a shrew that spewed vulgarities. With pain-ridden joints that suffered repeatedly from the invasion of the humidity on a daily basis, she supported a roof that could block out the elements. However, the roof had collapsed in the Great Smog. The child she wanted to protect had died in her arms;</p><p>It was a young girl who yearned to study and fantasized about a bright future. She doted on her mother and her younger sister, working hard in the room that was filled with moisture, always carrying that tiny bit of hope. However, after the Great Smog, she was no longer able to see the future she longed for;</p><p>It was a girl who desperately took in knowledge under the care of her mother and elder sister. She had gone through too much suffering, and she walked out of her predicament one step at a time, hoping to improve herself. She hoped that her mother and sister wouldn’t tire themselves out anymore and that she would have a chance to let her family of three to live an ideal life. However, all of this ultimately shattered. In that terrifying smog, this girl was left alone. No matter how much pain or joy she felt, she was no longer able to share it with her mother and sister. That fantasy of her family life never appeared, nor would it ever appear again;</p><p>They were living beings that fell to the ground like straw, one family after another, one human after another. They would never be able to erase the pain in their bones;</p><p>It was a student who clearly had a bright future, but only half of his body was left—his intestines splattered all over the ground;</p><p>They were children who returned home from school, only to suddenly realize that they had lost their parents and had become orphans;</p><p>It was the pain of writhing on the ground while crawling with great difficulty. He was an ordinary person who wanted to approach the future, but was powerless to swallow his last breath;</p><p>It was the people in the cemetery who were so silent that it made one’s heart ache, or those who cried until they fainted several times;</p><p>It was a land stained with blood;</p><p>It was the air filled with gunpowder;</p><p>They were cold and ruthless shells.</p><p>And for the mastermind behind all of this, the greatest murderer, he would step up to the divine throne over piles of corpses, only to receive cheers and escape his mortal coils.</p><p>Can you accept such a development?</p><p>Can you accept such an arrangement?</p><p>Can you accept such an outcome?</p><p>After a moment of silence, Klein suddenly spoke with a deep voice:</p><p>“No, I can’t.”</p><p>This voice immediately echoed in the room. It was layered and interlinked:</p><p>“No, I don’t accept it!”</p><p>There were still lingering echoes in his ears as the corners of his mouth curled up. Klein gave a self-deprecating laugh.</p><p>“The seven deities already tacitly accepted it. What meaning is there even if you don’t accept it?”</p><p>Once again, he fell silent. After a long while, he finally exhaled and said to himself with a calm expression, “Even if it’s meaningless, some things still ought to be done.”</p><p>In this world, how could there be many things that were guaranteed to succeed? That they were of value and be of use?</p><p>The corners of Klein’s mouth curled up. He looked away, turned around, and entered the room inside the rental flat.</p><p>Although he had already made up his mind, he had no intention of doing it rashly. With his current level and status, no matter how hard he tried, it would be difficult for him to affect George Ill’s matters. Other than throwing away his life, there wouldn’t be any other outcome.</p><p>Furthermore, if this resulted in chaos in the Loen Kingdom during a critical period of the war, resulting in the invasion of the Feysac army, then the deaths and injuries of the innocent would only be ten times or even a hundred times worse than the Great Smog of Backlund.</p><p>All I can do now is make preparations. On the one hand, I have to improve myself. On the other hand, I have to make more preparations and patiently wait for an opportunity… Klein muttered silently to himself. He found a black sticky blob and split it into two before smearing one half uniformly on a mirror.</p><p>This was a way to contact Demoness Trissy.</p><p>However, when all the black objects disappeared, there was still no abnormality in the mirror.</p><p>There’s no response… After being frightened by an angel like Miss Messenger, Trissy has already decided not to have any contact with Gehrman Sparrow… Klein sighed and walked to the bed to sit down.</p><p>His thoughts quickly shifted to the reason why the Demoness Sect had helped King George III.</p><p>…One of them is that the Demonesses need a catastrophe to digest the potion and hold a ritual. The other is that George III has made a promise to them? He promised them that they could openly spread their religion? No, this should be something that the seven deities wouldn’t allow. Even if the Black Emperor is a Sequence 0, and with the Primordial Demoness and the True Creator, “They” wouldn’t be able to fight against the seven deity alliance. Of course, after this war, the existence of an alliance between the seven deities is itself a question…</p><p>In that case, the seven deities that know that George III is working with the Demoness Sect shouldn’t let “Him” become the Black Emperor…</p><p>The promise is for something else? The Demoness pathway has a true god, and there are very few valuable items left outside… Similar pathways? Isn’t that the Red Priest pathway… George III—no, Amon’s brother doesn’t only know of the secret mausoleum needed by the Black Emperor from Blood Emperor Alista Tudor, but “He” also obtained the angel-level Beyonder characteristics or Grade 0 Sealed Artifacts of the Red Priest pathway?</p><p>With the condition that having a Sequence 0 means no Sequence 1, this is probably the greatest hope for the upper echelons of the Demoness Sect to advance further. Yes, the Primordial Demoness should also be very interested…</p><p>This can explain why the Demoness Sect is providing help… The Red Angel evil spirit is searching for Saintess of White Katarina, and it doesn’t seem to be as simple as “He” said… No, “He” didn’t say anything else besides using common knowledge and reactions to guide me into thinking that way…</p><p>Klein’s train of thought gradually became clear. He decided to use Saintess of White Katarina, as a breakthrough point, making her his next target. However, before that, he had to listen to what Queen Mystic had predicted. He wanted to know what she was planning to do in Backlund from her mouth.</p><p>Only by understanding the situation could he find and seize the opportunity!</p><p>The next morning, The Hermit Cattleya conveyed the words of Queen Mystic Bernadette:</p><p>Today between 12 to 12:30 p.m. at Srenzo Restaurant, Golden Theater.”</p><p>It was the name of a private room.</p><p>When Klein arrived at 11:55 a.m., he used an illusion to deceive the waiter, and he walked all the way to the room and waited patiently.</p><p>After a while, he took out his golden pocket watch and opened it.</p><p>With that, he put away his pocket watch and counted down to ten silently. Then, he raised his hand and knocked on the door of the Golden Theater.</p><p>At that moment, his marionette, Qonas, was sitting on a bench across the restaurant and reading the newspapers leisurely. Enuni was with a group of students, giving off a flyer that promoted the evilness of Feysac. Of course, the three of them would switch positions from time to time, making it impossible for anyone to make an accurate judgment.</p><p>“Come in.” Bernadette’s voice came from the room.</p><p>Very impressive. I didn’t notice anyone inside, nor did I notice anyone entering… Well, it’s also because I didn’t activate my Spirit Body Threads vision… Klein mumbled to himself before turning the doorknob and pushing the door open.</p><p>The first thing he saw was large swaths of gold before noticing the chestnut-haired woman sitting at the head of the table.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
