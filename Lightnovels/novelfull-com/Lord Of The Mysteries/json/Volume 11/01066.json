The entire structure was tall and majestic, but due to the layers of blue seawater, the sky couldn’t be seen, making it appear dark and gloomy.</p><p>Inside it, coral pillars propped up an exaggerated dome, and the walls and the top of it were filled with terrifying murals of the storm.</p><p>Above the murals and corals, silver bolts of lightning followed a certain trajectory as if they were alive. Finally, they converged at the nine steps that were inlaid with pearls, diamonds, emerald, and turquoise.</p><p>Siatas was standing there, with many elves standing opposite her.</p><p>On the nine steps, there were two huge chairs that seemed to be formed purely of lightning. One of them occupied the center, just like the ruler of this palace. One of them was on its left, appearing less eye-catching.</p><p>Sitting on the throne in the middle was a man wearing a simple loose robe. His ears were pointed, and his facial features were rather soft and his hair thick. His hair was a mix of black and blue colors. Not only did his facial features look outstanding on their own, they combined together to form an even more handsome face. However, he directly gave one a tyrannous impression, as though he wouldn’t say a word before picking up the electric spear leaning on his armrest, and then throwing it.</p><p>Sitting beside him was a beautiful woman with raven-black hair. Her hair was tied up into a high bun, her ears slightly pointed, and her facial features delicate. She had dark brown eyes that were as deep as the ocean, and in her hands, she was playing with a complicated golden wine cup.</p><p>Without needing Siatas’s introduction, Klein and company could easily determine that this couple was the Elf King, the ancient god, Soniathrym, and the Elf Queen, Queen of Calamity, Cohinem.</p><p>“That traitor, Aurmir!” Suddenly, a voice resembling loud thunder boomed, causing the entire palace to shake violently. It made Siatas and the other attendants lower their heads in fear.</p><p>This roar came from the ancient god.</p><p>Aurmir, isn’t that the name of the Giant King? I’ve recently been drinking red wine named after him. I have to say that its quality is indeed higher than anything else. It’s just a little expensive… As Klein listened, he had a random thought.</p><p>He remembered that Little Sun had once said that Giant King Aurmir, Elf King Soniathrym, and Sanguine Ancestor Lilith-the three humanoid ancient gods—were allies. They fought against the opposing camp formed by Dragon of Imagination, Ankewelt; Phoenix Ancestor, Gregrace; and the Mutant King, Kvastir. As for the Devil Monarch, Farbauti, and the Annihilation Demonic Wolf, Flegrea, they were independent beings who wanted to subvert all order and corrupt all living beings.</p><p>So, the alliance of three humanoid ancient gods eventually collapsed? Klein reined in his thoughts and waited for the subsequent changes in the dream.</p><p>Due to Derrick’s existence, Audrey wasn’t unfamiliar with the history of the Second Epoch. Without any hesitation, she directly made Siatas’s dream continue its development.</p><p>Despite the terrifying roar, Queen of Calamity Cohinem wasn’t affected at all. With a cold expression, “She” calmly said, “Wasn’t this already long confirmed?</p><p>“His’ reputation is exactly the opposite of ‘His’ physical build.”.</p><p>At that moment, the ancient god, Soniathrym, had already been enveloped by bolts of lightning. “He” said in a thunderous voice, “I thought that, after centuries, ‘He’ would understand the global situation even more. I’ve overestimated ‘His’ intelligence!</p><p>“If ‘He’ didn’t sell out Lilith back then, how could ‘She’ have perished?”</p><p>Eh… The Sanguine Ancestor Lilith perished so early? Klein’s eyelids twitched as he quickly focused his attention.</p><p>After the Elf King finished roaring, Queen of Calamity Cohinem maintained “Her” previous posture and said, “That’s not a bad thing. At the very least, Kvastir and Flegrea were dragged to the grave together with Lilith. All the deities no longer trust each other. Even if we don’t form an alliance, we can rule the ocean, lakes, and rivers.”</p><p>Upon hearing these words, Spectator Audrey, couldn’t help but feel alarmed. She had no choice but to use Placate on herself.</p><p>This… It means that the Sanguine Ancestor Lilith, Mutant King Kvastir, and the Annihilation Demonic Wolf Flegrea perished in a battle between ancient gods. So the betrayal of Giant King Aurmir and the other ancient gods had nothing to do with the ancient sun god?</p><p>This is why Lilith didn’t fully die and is still able to occasionally deliver divine revelations? And because of this, the Antigonus Mother of the Sky and Hornacis mountain range managed to survive to the Fourth Epoch… Klein increasingly believed that the history recorded in the City of Silver had many fabrications or vague records. Thankfully, he hadn’t completely digested the Bizarro Sorcerer potion and didn’t need to consider advancing to Scholar of Yore. Otherwise, the “history” he used might not be real.</p><p>In ancient times, the Sanguine Ancestor Lilith and Mutant King Kvastir perished due to the other… The Sanguine has recently been working with the Mutant’s temperance faction. Time sure is a great magician… Heh heh, if The Moon Emlyn were to know of this, I wonder what kind of expression he would have… The Star Leonard sighed as he thought.</p><p>As their thoughts raced, the ancient god, Soniathrym, scoffed and said, “Recently, Aurmir wanted to work with some secret sects that have sprouted from the humans to deal with us. Apparently, this matter is led by Harvest and Dawn.</p><p>“I’m even thinking of working with Ankewelt to destroy the giants and the Giant King’s Court. Unfortunately, every time I see that dragon, I have the urge to string it up on a grill. It’s a type of attraction that’s simply irresistible!”</p><p>Just as he said that, the ancient god suddenly vanished. The entire palace shook violently, causing a rift to appear.</p><p>All of this had yet to subside when a bolt of lightning flashed. Soniathrym returned to the massive throne, holding a spear made of pure lightning</p><p>“You went to the Giant King’s Court?” Cohinem asked.</p><p>“I taught Aurmir a lesson,” Soniathrym answered without hiding anything.</p><p>Siatas and the other elven attendants lowered their heads even further. They faintly saw slippery tentacles that were thicker than their bodies flipping about on the ground, flashing with silver bolts of lightning.</p><p>Then, they shut their eyes.</p><p>The dream changed as Siatas “recalled” her interaction with other elves.</p><p>With their conversations and interactions, Klein, Leonard, and Audrey learned that Siatas lived in a relatively peaceful time period in the Second Epoch. The giants, elves, dragons, devils, and phoenixes coexisted, splitting up their rule over the Northern and Southern Continent, as well as the Five Seas. Vampires, demonic wolves, treants, sea monsters, mutants, and humans were vassals of the different factions, occupying the lower-middle classes.</p><p>“This doesn’t resemble the history recorded by the Church. Even the legends in the City of Silver aren’t like this.” Leonard sighed when he heard that. “Old Man probably doesn’t know this much.”</p><p>“That isn’t necessarily true.” Klein shook his head indiscernibly. “Many existences in the Second Epoch have survived to the Fourth Epoch, or even to this very moment.”</p><p>“For example the Wisdom Angel?” Leonard asked with a guess.</p><p>“Perhaps.” Klein didn’t give an affirmative answer as he said with a smile, “When you were talking to Mobet, I thought you would make Miss Justice stand further away.”</p><p>Leonard immediately shot a glance at him and yawned.</p><p>“You mentioned before that there’s an existence behind me that might’ve been seen the second Blasphemy Slate. Then, when I was conversing with Mobet Zoroast, wouldn’t she be able to make the connection from me getting her to stand further away?</p><p>“Besides, you also mentioned that back when dealing with all of Amon’s avatars in Backlund, part of the clean-up operation involved Miss Justice. To a Sequence 5 Spectator, what she knows is sufficient. Once she understands the Zoroast family’s matters, the truth is practically in front of her eyes. In that case, why waste time trying to avoid her. It’s too troublesome. I might as well get Mr. Fool to be a witness as everyone vows not to divulge each other’s secrets.”</p><p>Klein nodded slightly and said, “If you were to get Miss Justice to stand further away, it wouldn’t be easy for you to bring up the matter of making a vow to keep things a secret…”</p><p>At this moment, Siatas continued, “After the death of the Sanguine Ancestor, the Annihilation Demonic Wolf, and the Mutant King, some of ‘Their’ subsidiary gods were killed, while others surrendered to other ancient gods. There were a few who vanished as they hid in the shadows.”</p><p>Having “transformed” herself into an elf, Audrey immediately asked, “Who surrendered to who? Who died?”</p><p>Siatas recalled and said, “I’ve never even seen it before. Uh, the Sanguine’s Goddess of Life and the Mutant King’s God of War were killed. No one even remembers ‘Their names… The Annihilation Demonic Wolf’s God of the Dead, Salinger, came under the Phoenix Ancestor. The Sanguine’s Goddess of Beauty, Auernia, came under us… The Mutant King’s God of Spiritual Creatures, Tolzna, and Annihilation Demonic Wolf’s Goddess of Misfortune, Amanises, vanished…”</p><p>Salinger… Auernia… These two names made Klein’s forehead twitch. He instinctively used his Clown powers to maintain his facial expression.</p><p>Auernia was the Blood Moon Queen, the wife of the Fourth Epoch’s Emperor, the Empress of the Trunsoest Empire!</p><p>As for Salinger, “He” was the founder of the Balam Empire, the Emperor of the Underworld – Death!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
