Extra! The kingdom declares war on Feysac!”</p><p>On the way from Maygur Manor to Backlund, Klein heard the paperboy shouting on the streets with brisk steps while on a horse carriage.</p><p>Although he had already made preparations, he still sighed after confirming that the war had truly erupted. He couldn’t help but feel depressed again.</p><p>The grudge from having Sonia Island, a key territory, taken away… The conflict over the rights of the colonies… The defeat from the previous war… The political corruption leading to a recession… Ever since the repeal of the Grain Act, many farmers of the kingdom have gone bankrupt due to the importing of foreign food products… The lower-class live in abject conditions… The rich-poor divide only grew deeper…</p><p>The middle class’s blind confidence in the Loen Kingdom’s might, and the eager desire to raise their own positions… The intensifying conflict between different political factions in high society leading to a fracture… The king and his faction wish for a large-scale war… With all these factors combined, just from an objective standpoint, and considering this from the angle of materialism, it’s almost inevitable for Loen to start a war… Reality is the best author… Jumping out from his experience from the past, Klein scrutinized the Loen Kingdom’s situation from a fresh point of view. He realized that the tides of the times had already formed and were surging over. Without a true deity’s descent, it was completely unstoppable.</p><p>In comparison, what puzzled him more was why the Feysac Empire would be willing to initiate a war.</p><p>Even if the members of an ancient secret organization were indeed members of the upper echelons of Feysac or the Church of the God of Combat—key figures who had the right to make the decision—there was no way they could be alone in deciding such an important matter. How could the others agree to a world war?</p><p>Could it be that the conflict between the various classes in the Feysac Empire has also completely escalated to the point that it urgently needs a war? With his lack of understanding of the empire of the north, it was difficult for Klein to make an accurate judgment. But they just won the East Balam war and reaped more of the rights to the colonies. There’s no reason for its situation to be more serious than Loen’s… Yes, the royal family—the Einhorn family—is in control of the Red Priest pathway. It’s understandable that they crave war, but the Church of the God of Combat has no reason not to stop it. As a member of the orthodox deity alliance, they lacked the motivation to help Amon’s brother advance to Sequence 0.</p><p>Thinking of this, Klein suddenly came up with a theory.</p><p>Did that brother of Amon realize that the Goddess has already acquired the Uniqueness of the Death pathway and is in a critical stage, so “He” revealed this information to the Church of the God of Combat? And the God of Combat is in a neighboring pathway with the Goddess, so there’s no way “He” can ignore this matter; “He” will definitely make an intense response…</p><p>Of course, it might not be done by the brother of Amon. It might also be because of the Numinous Episcopate’s Artificial Death faction’s angel, Haiter. After being warned by Einhom Sauron Medici, this Conspirer expert, “He” discovered the abnormalities ahead of time. On the one hand, “He” pretends not to notice anything and continues to set up a probe. On the other hand, “He” pulled in the Church of the God of Combat to worsen the situation and make it more chaotic… The Red Angel evil spirit is truly a symbol of war…</p><p>If this is really the case, then it’s inevitable for Feysac to wage this war. Furthermore, the matter regarding the Uniqueness of the Death pathway has no room for compromise. At the critical moment, the God of Combat might descend, causing a battle of gods that hasn’t happened since the end of the Fourth Epoch to happen…</p><p>This time, for the airship fleet from Feysac could stealthily to travel from the coast for nearly a hundred kilometers without being detected, it would definitely have a Weather Warlock providing protection. Otherwise, even if they were to take a detour across places with few people, they’ll still be seen ahead of time and definitely be stopped by the Loen airships… A Weather Warlock is an angel. Since the Fifth Epoch, the number of wars that have Beyonders at this level are few and far between… After Emperor Roselle’s death, most soldiers don’t even know of Beyonders, even in the colonial wars… To have a Weather Warlock be involved in this means…</p><p>This is really a battle that will sweep through the entire world. It involves battles at all levels. Is this what Amon’s brother wants?</p><p>When the time comes, the Lord of Storms, the Eternal Blazing Sun, the Earth Mother, the God of Steam and Machinery, the God of Knowledge and Wisdom will have to take their respective stances. Would the conflicts that “They” have temporarily suppressed for almost two thousand years be escalated…</p><p>Earth Mother likes the giants, and even amongst “Her” Blessed, they are Feysacians. And because of the splitting of Lenburg, Masin, and Segar, these made the Feynapotter Kingdom bear a bone-deep grudge with the Loen Kingdom and Intis. The king’s powers and the divine powers are highly likely to be unified, and they might form an alliance with Feysac. From the south to the north, they will attack Loen and Intis. Of course, countries like Lenburg and the Church of Knowledge, who are in the crossfire, will definitely try to stop it. Uh… As for Desi Bay, Feynapotter, and the Loen Kingdom are directly connected, the south wouldn’t be peaceful either…</p><p>The more Klein thought about it, the more he felt that the situation in the Northern Continent would become abnormally chaotic. And no matter what direction it developed into, he couldn’t stop it.</p><p>Even if he were a Sequence 4 demigod, under the tide of the times, there was no way for him to cause any major impact in this battle of gods, or exert any key influence. It would be pretty good if he could protect himself and the people he cared about.</p><p>Previously, when the Feysac air fleet attacked, the first thing he did was arrange for Butler Walter and company to hide in the underground area that was used as a wine cellar. Then, he “Teleported” to Backlund University of Technology. At that time, a bomb had already hit the ground. Some had died, and others were injured. The only thing he was thankful for was that his sister, Melissa, wasn’t within the vicinity of the explosion.</p><p>By the time Melissa and Benson met, the airships from Feysac didn’t stay for long and quickly retreated from Backlund. Only then did he return to Dwayne Dantes’s residence.</p><p>Phew…Klein let out a slow sigh of relief. He turned his head to look out the window and saw that, after hearing that the kingdom was declaring war on Feysac, a small number of pedestrians on the street wore a look of horror as though they had recalled the air raid in the morning. Most of them wore blank expressions with a look of panic. They had no idea what they could do even if they wanted to.</p><p>They might not have truly understood what this war would bring, but they instinctively felt that peace had been broken. The future was a chaotic mess, fraught with danger.</p><p>Klein retracted his gaze and looked at his valet, Enuni, who was sitting opposite him. From his eyes, he realized that he was somewhat at a loss.</p><p>He gave a half-smile and sighed. He raised his hand to rub his temples and wiped away his depressed and helpless feelings. He thought about what he could do and what he needed to take note of.</p><p>No matter what, with this experience and lesson, the king’s faction has had a war spark out as they wished. Before all of Loen collapses, it’s nearly impossible for Feysac to invade Backlund again. It would be safer for Benson and Melissa to stay here…</p><p>What’s most worrisome is the lack of food and various assassinations. The latter is nothing. The place where Melissa and Benson live in is decided by their own levels. They aren’t anywhere close to coming into contact with someone important who is a target for assassination, so they won’t be implicated. Fortunately, Portland Moment’s research laboratory has just been established, and there are no results from it yet. It won’t become a target that must be destroyed. As for the former, I can provide some “help” through Miss Audrey…</p><p>The Winter County at the Holy Cathedral is located in the far north reaches of the kingdom, next to Feysac. It’s always the front line of every war. Ma’am Arianna might’ve returned to help the military. Oh, “She” might also be sent elsewhere to protect the coast. After all, the defenses of Backlund are sufficient. The royal family definitely has Grade 0 Sealed Artifacts and also angels. The three Churches most likely have hidden tricks up their sleeves… In that case, my greatest pillar of support is gone. At most, I can get some help from the Church and use some Sealed Artifacts…</p><p>In the past, I wasn’t too worried about the effects the Red Angel evil spirit’s return has on me. Now, I have to raise my guard for this matter.</p><p>Patrick Bryan knows very well that Dwayne Dantes is equivalent to Gehrman Sparrow, who is equivalent to the Blessed of Death. I had intentionally revealed this information, hoping that it would direct the points of suspicion to Mr. Azik, the Death Consul. And now, this also means that the Red Angel evil spirit would be able to grasp this information in no time…</p><p>The Red Angel evil spirit currently only has a high level, but “His” actual standard shouldn’t have recovered to the level of an angel. There’s no irreconcilable feud between “Him” and me, nor do I have what “He” wants. Even if “He” knows that Dantes is equivalent to Gehrman Sparrow, it would be very unlikely for him to deal with me directly…</p><p>Other than attacking me directly, what harm will it bring after “He” grasps this situation?</p><p>Is he using this to set up a conspiracy or sell the intelligence to someone who needs it?</p><p>What conspiracy… Who would want it…</p><p>Many thoughts and names surfaced in his mind, but they were quickly eliminated by him. This included Amon’s brother and the Angel of Fate Ouroboros. From the Red Angel evil spirit’s past actions, for the time being, “He” wouldn’t make contact with Rose Redemption, and Amon’s brother is a sworn enemy of Medici and company.</p><p>Suddenly, a name appeared in his mind:</p><p>Zaratul!</p><p>The leader of the Secret Order, the Sequence 1 Seer pathway angel, Zaratul, who had returned to normalcy after becoming mad!</p><p>According to Arrodes’s feedback, this powerful and concealed existence had already left “His” original location, and “His” whereabouts were unknown.</p><p>Previously, Klein had been wondering if “He” would come to Backlund due to the law of Beyonder characteristic convergence.</p><p>Medici and the Zaratul and Zoroast families were serving under the Solomon Empire. Even if they weren’t friendly with each other, they must be very familiar with each other… In the foggy town, Zaratul had met Gehrman Sparrow. If he really wants to pursue something, he would definitely chase after the crazy adventurer… With a thought in his mind, Klein instinctively began to assume that Zaratul was in Backlund in search of Gehrman Sparrow, and with that, he began to analyze the situation for other abnormalities.</p><p>At almost the same instant that he thought of something, Klein recalled the failure of the joint operation between Sharron and the Sanguine.</p><p>The Rose School of Thought is also looking for Gehrman Sparrow, so would Zaratul, who received the corresponding news, work with them?</p><p>Back then, the operation was on the brink of success. The Rose School of Thought’s person-in-charge in Backlund had left in a hurry. Clearly, he had only noticed the problem at the last moment. With the Sanguine preparing the corresponding Sealed Artifact, it’s rather impossible for such a failure to happen. Even the Sanguine Duke was puzzled and confused, but what if—what if it was thanks to the perceptive intuition of a Sequence 1 angel of the Seer pathway?</p><p>This would explain it perfectly!</p><p>Back then, Zaratul was sitting opposite the Rose School of Thought’s Backlund person-in-charge?</p><p>The Rose School of Thought retreated in a panic and had even deliberately left behind a doll to create moonlight and cleanse everything so as to cover up the existence of Zaratul?</p><p>Also, the fact that Gehrman Sparrow has a certain relationship with the Death Consul isn’t a secret. Will Zaratul spread out all his marionettes and sense if there’s the power of Death in Backlund? Previously, when Patrick Bryan was holding rituals, there was actually Zaratul’s marionette watching him?</p><p>If the Red Angel evil spirit has already sold the intelligence to Zaratul, then wouldn’t my returning to Boklund Street in such a chaotic situation be giving myself up?</p><p>His pupils constricted, and he immediately said to the coachman in front, “Just stop here. I suddenly thought of something else I need to settle.”</p><p>After he said that, he felt extremely tense, afraid that the coachman wouldn’t answer him and continue driving.</p><p>Fortunately, none of this happened. The horse carriage stopped by the side of the road, and with his valet, Enuni, Klein walked towards a small alley nearby.</p><p>Immediately following that, he snapped his fingers and allowed the scarlet flames to emerge from his pocket, covering both himself and his marionette.</p><p>He had to rush to Saint Samuel Cathedral as soon as possible in a concealed manner!</p><p>With a flash of flames, their two figures disappeared.</p><p>However, after completing a leap, the flames within his senses suddenly disappeared—all of them.</p><p>A spacious living room appeared in front of him. On an ordinary reclining chair was a tall and thin man. He was young and had Southern Continent blood in him. He looked rather handsome and appeared a little anemic.</p><p>The Red Angel evil spirit, Sauron Einhom Medici!</p><p>This Red Angel played with a ball of scarlet-red flames in “His” hand as the corners of “His” mouth curled up.</p><p>You actually sensed it earlier than I expected.</p><p>“Heh, using Flaming Jump in front of me…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
