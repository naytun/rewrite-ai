Despite himself, he was surprised. “An Origin Talisman?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Origin Talismans” were something cultivators could craft only after stepping into the realm of the Origin Dao. They were full to the brim with origin power, and those who possessed them wielded unbelievable might.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Within the Great Zhou’s borders, those experts of the Origin Dao were known as Earthly Immortals.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The treasures experts of that level produced were absolutely priceless, difficult to purchase even with a mountain of gold!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“That’s right. This talisman is called ‘Star Cleaver’. Your father gave it to me the day you married into the Wen Family. Once shattered, it can obliterate a Martial Dao Grandmaster in a single attack!” The dowager cautiously put it away, then straightened her back, obvious pride written on her face. “This treasure is our Wen Family’s greatest assurance.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Su Yi inwardly shook his head.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">A single Origin Talisman, that’s all. Is it really worth all that pride?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Dowager, might I ask what you’re telling me this for?” he asked.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Third Young Master, in the year following your marriage into the Wen Family, aside from a few cold glances and barbed words, has anyone ever really hurt or bullied you?” asked the dowager.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi shook his head. “Actually, no.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The dowager continued sternly, her words carried a hint of a threat, “Third Young Master, listen up. I don’t care whether you hate the Wen Family or not, but if you dare do anything detrimental to our bottom line, I won’t spare you!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Su Yi finally understood.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">&nbsp;Ah. She took that Origin Talisman out earlier to threaten me, that’s all.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He smiled. There was no need to linger here any longer, so he simply turned and left.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Why does it seem like that kid’s an entirely different person now….?” Only after he disappeared from the Floral Tea House did the elderly dowager look away. Her brow was furrowed, and she looked uncertain. “Should I write a letter to the Su Family and inform them of what happened today?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A while later, she let out a lengthy sigh. She’d made up her mind. “Forget it. As an outsider, it’s not my place to get involved in the Su Family’s business, and it hasn’t been for a long time. So long as that brat doesn’t do anything to hurt the Wen Family, I can look the other way!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">…..</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The birthday feast was still ongoing, and the atmosphere was lively.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When Su Yi returned, he saw Wen Shaobei and the other Wen Family youths all clustering around the same person.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Even&nbsp;</span><span>Wen</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Lingxue was there.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The one they’d gathered around was Wen Jueyuan, Family Head Wen Changjing’s son and an elite at the peak of the Blood Circulation Realm. He was the leading figure of the Wen Family’s younger generation.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Of course, his reputation was still somewhat inferior to the Li Family’s Li Moyun.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Brother Su, you’re back!” When he saw Su Yi, Huang Qianjun shot to his feet, a welcoming smile on his face. He’d been sitting there all on his own.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi nodded. “The banquet’s more than half over. What are you still doing here?\"</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun said sheepishly, “How could I leave while you’re still here? No matter what, I’ll keep you company to the very end!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Oh,” said Su Yi. He naturally saw right through Huang Qianjun and Huang Yunchong.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">They were unquestionably trying to turn a bad situation to their advantage, turning yesterday’s disaster into an opportunity to mend their relationship, and ideally, to get closer to him!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Su Yi, Cousin Jueyuan has something to say to you. Come with me.” Suddenly, Wen Shaobei walked over. His gaze carried a sense of superiority, and his wording was crude and harsh.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi glanced over at the crowd gathered around Wen Jueyuan. He was looking right back at him, his expression reserved and aloof.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Then, Su Yi looked back at Wen Shaobei and said indifferently, “Go tell him that he’s welcome to talk to me, but that he should come here himself.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This Wen Shaobei had treated him with disdain from the moment he first arrived at the banquet. He’d rebuked him, saying that a mere live-in son-in-law like him was unqualified to sit among them.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Afterward, he’d seized the opportunity to slander Wen Changtai, infuriating Wen Lingxue.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But now, he was acting as Wen Jueyuan’s lackey!&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi naturally felt no need to be polite to him, so he spoke as if Wen Shaobei were just an errand boy.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“You… What did you just say?” Wen Shaobei was stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">A mere live-in son-in-law dares put on airs in front of me?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun immediately approached, then glared with imposing viciousness. “Are you blind, or deaf? Don’t you understand human language?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Shaobei froze. He was suddenly apprehensive.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun was infamous throughout Guangling City as a spoiled, domineering, proud hoodlum prone to violence. Just about every member of the younger generation was afraid of him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Shaobei was naturally no exception.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He gulped, then muttered, “Young Master Huang, this has nothing to do with you…..”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Before he could continue, Huang Qianjun spat contemptuously, “Would you believe me if I said that, if this weren’t the Wen Family dowager’s birthday banquet, I’d beat you to a pulp here and now?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Shaobei’s face went ashen, and his forehead broke into cold sweats as he slumped over.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“Look at yourself! Pathetic!” sneered Huang Qianjun. “If you want to remain in Guangling City going forward, you’d best hurry up and&nbsp;</span><span>scram</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Shaobei reacted as if he’d been granted an imperial pardon; he was gone in a flash.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Su Yi had witnessed this entire exchange, and he couldn’t help but laugh.</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">&nbsp;Indeed, the wicked are vulnerable to even greater villains. Few of the Wen Family’s younger generation&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">are any</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">&nbsp;use at all.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“Brother Su, please don’t blame me for meddling. I just couldn’t stand watching him act like that! A trivial branch member of the Wen Family dares treat you with such disrespect? He’s simply sick of breathing!” Facing Su Yi, Huang Qianjun’s domineering&nbsp;</span><span>bossiness</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;disappeared. He was suddenly meek as could be, with a toadyish smile on his face.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi clucked his tongue. “You sure are adaptable.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was unclear whether Huang Qianjun picked up on the insult. He just laughed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“What? Su Yi dares tell Cousin Jueyuan to pay&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">him</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;a visit?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Who does he think he is?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">……Not far away, and shortly after Wen Shaobei left, the youths clustered around Wen Jueyuan were in uproar. They were both shocked and furious.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Wen Lingxue was there too, but she immediately rushed back to Su Yi’s side.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">This is bad!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She reached him in a flash. Her fair features were wrought with concern. “Brother-in-law, you should leave right away! Wen Shaobei is trying to stir up trouble between you and Cousin Jueyuan!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“You’ve misunderstood Wen Shaobei. He was telling the truth. Wen Jueyuan is the one who wants to talk to me; it’s not like I went looking for him, so shouldn’t he take the initiative to approach me?” Su Yi laughed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Huang Qianjun nodded along. “That’s exactly right, Brother Su!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Despite herself, Wen Lingxue was dazed.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">What’s going on?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Meanwhile</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">—</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Jueyuan was already striding towards them, a pack of Wen Family youths trailing after him. They’d already drawn the attention of several of the nearby guests.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“I’m surprised. Su Yi, you’re getting haughtier and&nbsp;</span><span>haughtier</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">.” Wen Jueyuan stood before Su Yi and stuck out his jaw, an intimidating glint in his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He was the leading figure of the Wen Family’s younger generation; they’d always been at his beck and call.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Yet Su Yi, a mere live-in son-in-law, had refused to come see him. Worse, he’d done it in front of everyone. This left Wen Jueyuan deeply displeased.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Wen Jueyuan, you put on airs first, got it?” Huang Qianjun snicked. “You’re less than a hundred feet away, yet you sent your lackey Wen Shaobei over to deliver a message on your behalf. You want to talk about haughtiness? You’re quite haughty yourself, you know.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Huang Qianjun was here as their guest, and he was Huang Yunchong’s son. Although his cultivation was far inferior to&nbsp;</span><span>Wen</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Jueyuan’s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">, he wasn’t the least bit afraid.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Shaobei’s expression flitted between shame and rage. He’d just been called a “lackey” in front of everyone. He even felt the urge to find a hole and hide himself inside.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Jueyuan furrowed his brow, and his cold gaze swept toward Huang Qianjun. “This is the Wen Family’s private business. You’d best not get involved!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Then, he turned toward Su Yi and said flatly. “You have nothing to be afraid of. I won’t lower myself by bullying a cripple like you. If word of that got out, it would only hurt my reputation.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Many of those nearby couldn’t help but laugh.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Is that all you wished to discuss with me?” Su Yi just stood there, his hands clasped behind his back, and he spoke without the slightest ripple of emotion.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Jueyuan pondered briefly, then said, “I just wanted to tell you that tonight, the city lord and the others approached you out of respect for Lingzhao. You might be her husband, but you’re still just a live-in son-in-law, unworthy of the public eye!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His words were deeply demeaning, and many of the nearby Wen Family youths laughed with even less restraint.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Throughout the Great Zhou, live-in son-in-laws remained behind closed doors!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Jueyuan’s words represented what practically every last one of them was thinking.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">However, Su Yi didn’t seem angry in the least. On the contrary, he shook his head, a hint of pity in his gaze.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Ha ha ha…!” Huang Qianjun couldn’t help but burst into laughter.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This was unquestionably the funniest thing he’d heard all day!<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Others might not know it, but he was well aware that Fu Shan and Nie Beihu, as well as his father, Huang Yunchong, had all come here on Su Yi’s account!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The youths of the Wen Family had eyes, but they might as well have been blind! They were just begging for Su Yi to teach them a lesson!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">At first, Wen Lingxue was worried and angry. She’d planned to argue on Su Yi’s behalf, but when she heard Huang Qianjun’s burst of exaggerated laughter, she was caught entirely off guard, unsure of how to respond.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>She wasn’t the only one. Wen Jueyuan and the others were bewildered too.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">What the f*ck is so goddamn funny!?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Is Huang Qianjun an idiot or what?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Jueyuan glanced at him irritably. Then, his gaze returned to Su Yi, and he said coldly, “Going forward, if you dare borrow Lingzhao’s name to run amok or intimidate others, I’ll be the first to teach you a lesson! You’d best bear my words in mind!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">With that, he turned to leave. Judging from the look on his face, he disdained wasting any more words on someone like Su Yi.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The other Wen Family youths hurried after him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I can’t believe Cousin Jueyuan would act like that. I’m so disappointed in him….” Wen Lingxue bit her glossy lips, and her bright, beautiful eyes carried hints of dejection and melancholy.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In the past, she’d admired Wen Jueyuan immensely. She saw him almost as an older brother.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>But after what she’d just witnessed, her impression of him soured. She no longer saw him in the same light.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“It’s ultimately just youthful ignorance and conceit. It’s a common affliction among the young,” said Su Yi casually.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun froze. Deep anguish rose within his heart.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Two days ago, during their first meeting at the Immortal Gathering House, hadn’t he been the very picture of “youthful ignorance and conceit”? That was why Su Yi taught him a lesson, and that was what led to an even greater incident.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He’d even dragged his father, Huang Yunchong, down with him. He really should have known better!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Lingxue, come with me.” Su Yi had no desire to linger at the banquet, so he turned to leave.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Oh!” Wen Lingxue immediately rushed out of him. She thought that tonight’s banquet was rather dull, too.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Brother Su, how can you leave just like that? What… What about me?&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun inwardly cried out, suddenly anxious.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Although he didn’t know it, although Huang Yunchong and Nie Beihu looked as if they were casually chatting and laughing, they’d been keeping an eye on Su Yi’s every movement this entire time.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When they saw Su Yi leave, they glanced at each other and, without any prior discussion, they both rose and bade the Wen Family farewell.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Neither of these important figures could be bothered to waste any more time here…..</span></p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "original_title": "Chapter 24 - Youthful Ignorance and Conceit", "chapterId": 148728}
