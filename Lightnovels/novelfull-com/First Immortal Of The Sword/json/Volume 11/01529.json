This was&nbsp;</span><span>Wen</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Lingxue’s second uncle.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“A few days ago, he openly spouted utter nonsense, infuriating Young Master Wei Zhengyang. Someone’s needed to teach him a lesson for a long time.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Family Head Wen Changjing said indifferently, “Who’d have guessed that before we even got the chance to discipline him, the brat would go out and offend a silkpants like Huang Qianjun? I’ve never seen someone so intent on seeking death!”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Suddenly,&nbsp;</span><span>Wen</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Changqing scrunched up his brow. “There’s just one thing I don’t understand. Wasn’t Su Yi supposed to have lost his entire cultivation a year ago? So how is that he defeated Huang Qianjun and his thugs yesterday?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changjing shook his head. “It happened at the Immortal Gathering House, and none of us were present. We only have Lingxue’s one-sided account; that can’t prove anything.”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He paused, then laughed coldly, “No matter what, I certainly don’t believe a waste like him can stir up any waves!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changqing laughed along. “I agree completely.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He first rose to prominence back when he was still a disciple of Blueriver Sword Manor and his cultivation was at the third level of the Blood Circulation Realm, the “Refining Sinew” stage. His sword arts were superb and transcendent, earning him his title as the outer sect’s Sword Chief.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But then, some time later, an accident robbed him of his entire cultivation. This left his blood and qi weakened, and his foundations were shattered. At the time, several major powers of the Blueriver Sword Manor tried to help him, but to no avail.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The Blueriver Sword Manor cast him away, and Su Yi had been relegated to the role of “cripple” and “waste” ever since.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It wasn’t just Wen Changjing and Wen Changqing that knew of this; in Guangling City, this was common knowledge.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Given these circumstances, Wen Changjing refused to believe that Su Yi had any hope of cultivating the Martial Dao anew.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“There’s no need to discuss the boy any further,” Wen Changjing said casually. “Tomorrow is the dowager’s birthday banquet. Huang Yunchong of the Huang Family will be in attendance. You can ask him about this then. He’ll tell you what really happened at the Immortal Gathering House.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi was just an insignificant live-in son-in-law. He was in no way worthy of their notice.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Changqing, speaking of tomorrow’s banquet, are all your preparations in order?” asked Wen Changjing.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changqing nodded. “The clans and factions on good terms with our Wen Family have all confirmed that they’ll be at the banquet to help celebrate the dowager’s birthday. It’s just….”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He hesitated briefly, then whispered, “Elder Brother, as you know, our Wen Family’s situation isn’t what it used to be. We now occupy the lowest position of Guangling City’s Three Great Clans. Given our current situation, convincing true VIPs to attend the birthday banquet won’t be easy….”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changjing furrowed his brow. “Where did you run into problems?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changqing grimaced. “Over at the City Lord’s Estate.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The City Lord’s Estate!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changjing’s heart sank as he realized how serious the problem was.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Over the past few years, the Wen Family’s influence sank like a setting sun; they simply weren’t what they used to be.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">By comparison, the other two members of the Three Great Clans, the Huang and Li Families, prospered more with each passing day, their forces flourishing.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Their success only highlighted the Wen Family’s predicament.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Recently, numerous rumors had spread throughout the city. They said that within ten years, the Wen Family was sure to lose their position among “the Three Great Clans of Guangling City”!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This had already become a sore point for the Wen Family’s higher-ups.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As such, the dowager’s eightieth birthday had become an affair of the utmost importance.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Their goal was to use this birthday banquet to show off before the outside world. They wanted to tell everyone in Guangling City that the Wen Family’s foundations were still in place, and that they wouldn’t tolerate slander!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The more important people in attendance, the better they could prove this point!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In short, they’d invited several important figures to help the Wen Family keep up appearances!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>The way the Wen Family&nbsp;</span><span>had it planned</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">, if they successfully invited City Lord Fu Shan to tomorrow’s birthday dinner, it was equivalent to inviting a pillar of support. That way, they’d be able to keep up appearances with ease!<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When word spread to the populace, who would dare say the Wen Family had declined?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“If City Lord Fu doesn’t show up, I’m afraid the other VIP guests will think that the current&nbsp;</span><span>Wen</span><span>&nbsp;Family….&nbsp;</span><span>Isn’t enough</span><span>&nbsp;to move a ‘godly’ figure like the city lord</span><span>….</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changjing’s expression gradually darkened. Then, he took a deep breath. His eyes bore into Wen Changqing, and when he spoke, he paused for emphasis between each word. “Go back to the City Lord’s Estate. No matter what you do, you must convince City Lord Fu to attend the birthday banquet!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changqing froze, and he muttered, “Elder Brother, I’ve already visited them in person three times. Each time, they refused me at the door. I didn’t even get an audience with the city lord….”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changjing gnashed his teeth. “Visit them once more. If City Lord Fu doesn’t agree, just wait at his estate. I refuse to believe that, after all the years he’s known our Wen Family, he’ll refuse us forever.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changqing’s heart sank, but he nodded and sighed with emotion, “Back when the dowager was still in the Jade Capital, who in Guangling City would have dared look down on us?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changjing was silent, but inwardly, his heart churned.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Suddenly, a retainer rushed inside to deliver his report—Su Yi had returned home!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“You’re certain he doesn’t have any injuries at all?” Wen Changqing couldn’t help but ask. He was visibly astonished.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The retainer thought about it seriously, then said, “From the outside, he looks perfectly fine.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Wen Changqing was immediately stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">How is this possible!?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Huang Qianjun endured such embarrassment. How could the Huang Family let Su Yi off so easily?&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Something’s fishy about this!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Elder Brother, how do you see this?” Wen Changqing couldn’t help but glance at Wen Changjing.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Compared to the birthday banquet tomorrow, what difference does it make whether Su Yi lives or dies?” said Wen Changjing impatiently.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changqing immediately fell silent.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">…..</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The evening sunlight streamed through the window lattice, casting flecks of light onto the floor.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi was soaking in a wooden bathtub, his eyes shut, breathing in and out. His handsome face was utterly tranquil.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A long time passed before Su Yi let out a deep breath. It shot through forth like an arrow, firm yet lasting, with a faint boom vaguely reminiscent of thunder.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Starting tomorrow, I’ll have to switch to a new body-refining medicinal bath recipe.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His cultivation had just reached the pinnacle of the first stage of the Body Refining Realm, the “Refining Skin” stage.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The next stage was “Refining Muscle”!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Refining muscle meant tempering the flesh, excavating and stimulating a body’s latent potential. This elevated a cultivator’s physique to yet another level.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">At the peak of this stage, the muscles were soft as jade when relaxed, and as firm as steel when tensed. Ordinary weapons could no longer penetrate the skin!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">When tempering the skin, the ingredients in my daily medicinal bath cost about five hundred taels. But when I start tempering my muscles, my daily medicinal expenditures will soar to fifteen hundred taels. That’s the only way to achieve harmony with the Pine and Crane Body Refining Technique, and it’s necessary to achieve the strongest possible physique….</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi rose from his bath, got dressed, and sat beside the window, lost in thought.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Only six days had passed since he began his cultivation anew. Although he’d already reached the peak of the Refining Skin stage, he’d also burned through a full three thousand taels of silver!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Of the ten thousand silver Zijin first gave him, only seven thousand remained. Based on Su Yi’s initial estimates, if he started his Refining Muscle stage cultivation, that seven thousand would only last him four or five days!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Were he any ordinary man, he couldn’t possibly have sustained such shocking expenditures.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">I’ll need to find some time to take a look around the Azurecloud Mountains. It’d be wonderful if I could find some spiritual medicines.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Spiritual medicines were different from typical medicinal herbs, as they were born of and nourished in spiritual energy.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Back in the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, with the exception of medicines on the level of “treasures of heaven and earth”, spiritual medicines of all grades were easily purchasable.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But within the Great Zhou’s borders, nevermind “heavenly materials” and “earthly treasures”; even ordinary spiritual medicines were rare, and all of them were incomparably precious, difficult to purchase even with a mountain of gold.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But to Su Yi, this wasn’t actually much of a problem.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Within the Blood Circulation Realm, he didn’t need spiritual medicines, or at least, he could substitute ordinary herbal medicines. At most, it would drag the process out and cost a little extra silver.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Shortly after getting dressed, Su Yi got up and entered the courtyard, then started drilling the Pine and Crane Body Refining Technique as he always did.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The path of cultivation had always been incomparably arduous and dull. Those capable of persisting all had immense will and powerful spirits.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">That was the only way to make something of oneself!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Especially since he wanted to transcend his past self. He naturally couldn’t afford the slightest negligence!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">…..</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Morning the next day.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The skies had yet to brighten, but the entire Wen Family estate was bustling with activity.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Today was the dowager’s eightieth birthday, and numerous VIP guests would soon grace their walls. News of tonight’s event had long spread throughout Guangling City, and many were paying close attention. No one dared slack off.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But all this commotion had nothing to do with Su Yi. After all, in their eyes, he was nothing but an insignificant little live-in son-in-law.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As everyone else scurried about, he carried out his usual routine, stepping through the gates and strolling leisurely outside of the city along the banks of the Great Azure.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">After a while, Su Yi saw the mulberry grove. There were two figures waiting there already.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">They were none other than Xiao Tianque and Zijin.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“This old man greets you, Master Su.” When he saw Su Yi, Xiao Tianque perked up. He smiled broadly, then stepped up to greet him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His complexion was obviously much better than when they’d first met.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Greetings, Master Su!” Zijin stepped forward and greeted him respectfully.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Today, she wore a blue-green dress. Her skin was fair as snow, with willowy eyebrows, almond-shaped eyes, a graceful beauty with an outstanding figure.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“The two of you surely know my identity by now. Don’t you doubt me at all?” Su Yi asked with great interest.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Xiao Tianran said solemnly, “Worldly men have always judged others by their appearance and status. Little do they know, those like you are the true experts!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi laughed and shook his head. “No need to be so polite.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Zijin hesitated, then said apologetically, “Master Su, earlier, I was the one who arranged for people to investigate your background, as well as to monitor your movements in secret. However, I swear by the heavens themselves that I had no other intentions. If I’ve displeased you, I humbly request your forgiveness.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As she spoke, she lowered her beautiful head and bowed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Just don’t do it again.” Su Yi nodded, and Zijin inwardly sighed in relief. Only then did she dare straighten her back.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Master Su, about my injuries….” Xiao Tianque couldn’t help but ask.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Wait just a moment. I’ll attend to your wounds as soon as I’ve completed my cultivation.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As Su Yi spoke, he stopped in a clearing amidst the mulberry trees. He held his breath, focused, and emptied his mind. Then, he gradually began practicing the Pine and Crane Body Refining Technique.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He completely disregarded the two pairs of eyes still watching him from not far away.&nbsp;</span></p><hr/><blockquote><b>Translator's Thoughts</b><p>Not sure if I clarified this yet, but the word \"master\" here? It's not an expression of submission or anything like that; it's basically \"sensei\" in Japanese.&nbsp;</p><p>In an ordinary modern Chinese conversation, it's more like \"mister\", ie a generic but polite honorific used to address men.

Basically, they're being polite, but in a way that acknowledges Su Yi's abilities, not his status or background.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>", "images": {}, "success": true, "original_title": "Chapter 16 - Just Don’t Do it Again", "chapterId": 148720}
