Over the past year, who among them hadn’t heard how worthless and pathetic Su Yi was?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">They didn’t take him the least bit seriously!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Jieyuan continued disdainfully, “Or is that you think, as her ‘husband’, you can take advantage of Lingzhao becoming a Grandmaster’s disciple to improve your situation?&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Let me tell you: even if I killed you here and now, Cousin Lingzhao wouldn’t avenge you!” As he said this, there was a hint of pity in his gaze.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi’s expression only grew calmer. Suddenly, he asked, “Do you know Wu Ruoqiu?”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Jieyuan was suddenly serious. “Did you meet that wandering Daoist last night?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi instantly understood. “Just as I thought. You and your father have long since known about the courtyard’s dangers. Had anyone else spent the night here, I’m afraid they’d have died already.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Jieyuan fell silent. Suddenly, he burst into laughter, a strange look in his eyes. “Su Yi, you were supposed to die last night, but then, it’s not too late.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He waved, his voice cold and indifferent. “Kill him!”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Yes, sir!” The guards scattered throughout the courtyard responded immediately, surrounding Su Yi, their gazes icy and murderous.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“My apologies, ‘Young Master’!”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Clang!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>A short but bulky man drew his iron shortsword, then launched himself off the ground like an arrow&nbsp;</span><span>loosed</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;from its bowstring. He hurtled straight towards Su Yi’s back.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The shortsword slashed a perfectly vertical streak of sword light, fast as lightning.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi didn’t so much as shift positions, but his sheathed sword whipped behind him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The sheath slammed into the short, bulky man’s chest when the shortsword was just half a foot from Su Yi’s back.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Crunch!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The attack looked casual, but it was incomparably overbearing. The stocky guard’s ribs shattered and his chest caved in.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He screamed in agony, but before he could react, the sheath rose and slammed into his neck.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The Blood Circulation Realm, Refining Muscle Stage elite guard fell, knees slamming to the ground with a thud, his neck broken and his head hanging limply. He breathed no more.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It happened in an instant, and throughout the entire process, the sword never left its sheath, nor did Su Yi turn to face his foe. He’d killed him facing the opposite direction, without even looking at him!<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Everyone in the courtyard was horrified.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“That cripple recovered his cultivation!?” Standing beside the well, Wen Jieyuan’s expression darkened.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A year ago, the Sword Chief of Blueriver Sword Manor’s outer sect, Su Yi, lost his cultivation, then married into a Wen Family as a cripple. Everyone in Guangling City knew that.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Yet now, Su Yi had effortlessly slaughtered a Blood Circulation Realm cultivator!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“All of you, attack at once!” The man in black shouted coldly. He was the captain of this group of guards. He was tall and lean, and his eyes flashed. He’d been immersed in the “Refining Sinew” stage for a long time, and he had ample combat experience.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Even as he gave his orders, he led the way forward. He raised a three-foot mace over his head and swung.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Whoosh!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fierce winds tore through the air with an ear-piercing howl.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The other seven guards raised axes, blades, tridents, and various other weapons, then charged as one.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Based purely on the murderous intent emanating from them, it was obvious that they were ruthless and long accustomed to bloodshed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Although he was surrounded, Su Yi gazed only at his sword. He whispered, “Alright then. Today, I’ll baptize you in their blood.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Even as his whisper echoed throughout the courtyard….</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Clang!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A streak of sword light shot forth, and the sword, its blade as dark as night and gleaming with faint purple hues, rose into the air. The metal hummed, as if clamoring for a feast of fresh blood.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The sword was called “Mortal Edge.” The name came from the phrase “I enter the mortal world and sharpen my heart like the edge of my blade.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Clang!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Mortal Edge’s sword light swept across the man in black’s mace, which cracked, then split in half as if it were made of tofu.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The sword’s edge was far too sharp and despotic!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">One swing of the blade, and he cut through both the mace and its wielder’s right arm. A waterfall of blood gushed from the stump, bright red and piping hot.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The man let out a low grunt and retreated in terror, only to see an incomparably bloody scene play out before him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi’s sleeves billowed. He gripped his sword, glanced to the sides like a fallen immortal, and struck six times in rapid succession.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Cut, stab, sweep, slice, burst, split!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Every swing of his sword was fast as the wind and destructive as fire. The scattered attacks were unrestrained, as ethereal as lightning and fleeting as light.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi resembled a cyclone towering into the nine heavens, wanton and unbridled.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Thud!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">One of the guards collapsed, eyes wide with shock, a bloody hole through his throat.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Splurt!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Another guard’s head flew from his shoulders and into the air, his face a mask of lingering terror.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A rapid series of collisions and muffled thuds followed. Some of the guards were hacked to pieces. Others had their throats cut or their chests sliced open….</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fresh blood burst like a display of bright red fireworks, beautiful yet violent, blooming in the skies above the courtyard.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When Su Yi stopped and lowered his sword, everyone but the black-robed captain and Wen Jieyuan had perished. Blood flowed like a river.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This was just like the silence following a sudden crack of thunder.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi just stood there, as calm as ever, sword in hand, utterly at ease. The blade was as dark as the night, and it dripped with blood.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He stood surrounded by seven fresh, still-bleeding corpses, a bloody spectacle.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“That… What kind of sword technique is that?” The black-robed man was shocked out of his wits. He was dazed, and his eyes were bewildered; he was completely intimidated.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Jieyuan was stunned too. He trembled in both terror and fury, and his eyes filled with disbelief.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“If you nourish your sword with slaughter, it grows ferocious. If you temper it in blood, it develops a baleful aura. It’s best to polish your sword with your Dao Heart. But then, although Mortal Edge has a hint of spirituality, it’s ultimately just a mortal weapon. The taint of bloodlust won’t harm it.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi glanced at Mortal Edge, then at Wen Jieyuan. “You’re an ‘esteemed disciple’ of the Wen Family,” he said flatly. “Don’t you dare fight me?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Jieyuan felt a chill course through him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He was only in the Blood Circulation Realm’s Refining Muscle stage, and he’d been pampered from a young age. He’d never seen such a bloody spectacle in his life, and he was already scared out of his mind.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Young Master, run! Hurry!” Suddenly, the nearby man in black shouted, pulled out a crossbow, and aimed it at Su Yi.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Whoosh!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A bolt shot out like lightning, its glint bitingly sharp.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi shifted to the side, dodging with just three inches between the bolt and his throat. The point thudded into the courtyard’s walls, leaving a deep hole and scattering fragments of stone.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">From this, it was clear how powerful the bolt was!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Jieyuan had already come to his senses, and he seized this opportunity to flee the courtyard.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The man in black held his crossbow and rewound it, pulling the trigger and loosing one bolt after another.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The sharp points stirred up howling winds as they shot through the air in rapid succession, straight towards Su Yi, as concentrated as a downpour.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi didn’t retreat. Instead, he advanced, flickering and shifting, allowing the bolts to slip right past him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He was already at the Refining Sinew stage. He moved like an arrow and landed as gently as the wind, nimble as could be.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Even though he walked amidst a rain of projectiles, he seemed calm and composed, dodging each incoming bolt by a hair.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In the blink of an eye, he arrived before the man in black, entirely uninjured, not even a single hair out of place.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“If you do this, you’ll only hurt yourself!” The man in black shouted. He’d already used up all his bolts, and as Su Yi drew near, he couldn’t help but despair.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Strong!<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Too strong!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">So strong that even a Refining Sinew expert like him felt terror and helplessness rise from deep within his heart.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“You saved your master out of loyalty. That’s worthy of praise, so I’ll give you a clean death.” With that, the tip of Su Yi’s sword flashed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Splurt!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The sword went straight through the man’s chest, destroying his heart.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In the last moments before his death, he couldn’t believe how fast and efficient Su Yi’s movements were. It seemed he wasn’t the least bit concerned about how grave the consequences of his actions might be.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The man in black thudded to the ground and collapsed in a puddle of blood.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But Su Yi had already fixed his gaze elsewhere.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Jieyuan had already reached the gates, as frantic and terrified as a dog after losing its master.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">How could Su Yi let him escape so easily?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">With a flick of his toes, a shortsword flew into the air and landed in his palm.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His arms surged with power, and he flung it.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Swoosh!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The shortsword flew like an arrow, fast and ruthless as lightning, then sunk straight into Wen Jieyuan’s back.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The combination of agonizing pain and overwhelming terror put Wen Jieyuan on the verge of collapse.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“If I’d known this would happen, I wouldn’t have had them lock the gates….” Wen Jieyuan’s&nbsp;</span><span>expression filled</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;with despair.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But it was then that—</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Someone opened the gates from the outside, and a group appeared just beyond the courtyard.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The leader was a hulking, mountainous figure in armor and warrior’s robes. When he opened his eyes, they seemed to crackle with electricity.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This was none other than the commander of the city lord’s guards, Nie Beihu.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Commander Nie, save me!” Wen Jieyuan had only just despaired, but now, he was mad with delight. He screamed for help, like a drowning man clutching at straws.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“This….” Nie Beihu’s gaze swept across the courtyard. The sight of so many fresh, bloodied corpses surprised even him. His expression shifted, and he sucked in a cold breath of air.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun and a group of guards had followed him in, and the bloody spectacle shocked them, too. Their nerves went taut.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Then, their gazes landed on the solitary figure standing amidst the carnage: Su Yi.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">They couldn’t calm down. It was obvious to all of them that he was responsible for all this bloodshed!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Commander Nie, hurry! Hurry and capture that villain Su Yi! He’s on a murderous rampage. He killed all my attendants, and he wants to kill me too!” Wen Jieyuan cried out, both bitter and frantic.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He’d been at the banquet a few days ago, and he saw Nie Beihu and Fu Shan make an appearance. He instinctively assumed that since Nie Beihu was on good terms with the Wen Family, he’d back him up.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But what happened next left him stunned.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nie Biehu suddenly came to his senses, clasped his fist, and greeted Su Yi. “I apologize for my late arrival, Young Lord Su, and humbly request your forgiveness.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Commander Nie, you… How could you….” Wen Jieyuan felt as if he’d been struck by lightning. He was tongue-tied, and his eyes bulged. He was too shocked to even speak properly.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nie Beihu ignored him, his expression indifferent. He just looked at Su Yi with utter respect.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi furrowed his brow, then glanced at Huang Qianjun. “Did you invite Commander Nie here?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun froze. He could tell that Su Yi was displeased, and he broke into cold sweats.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He wanted to explain, but in the end, he could only lower his head and grimace. “Yes.”</span></p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "original_title": "Chapter 39 - I Enter the Mortal World and Sharpen My Heart Like the Edge of My Blade", "chapterId": 149401}
