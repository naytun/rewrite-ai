His brow silently furrowed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The yellow-robed elder was called Dongguo Hai. He was a grand elder of the Dongguo Family, a high-level authority figure.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The six others with him were all prominent members of the clan too.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When the group arrived at the scene of the battle and saw the disheveled, blood-covered Dongguo Feng, they were all stunned.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“</span><span>Feng’er</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">, you… You actually lost?” exclaimed Dongguo Hai.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As he spoke, he and his companions scanned the area.
