He inadvertently glanced to the side, only to see that one of the servants had already brewed a steaming pot of medicinal tea for him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Sir, have some water to moisten your throat,” said the servant. He was humble and respectful.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Hu Quan and the others smiled when they saw this.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">By now, the Apricot Clinic’s old-hands were fully convinced of Su Yi’s abilities.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Their shock was more than words could express.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Huang Qianjun stood not far away. He’d witnessed their change in attitude firsthand, and waves coursed through his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Only true skill can wholeheartedly convince others.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He vaguely understood why his father had been so insistent that he find an opportunity to spend more time with Su Yi.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">At first, the staff of the Apricot Clinic had been arrogant and rude, with an air of superiority.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Yet now, all of them had lowered their heads in submission!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Had Su Yi forced them into submission?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">No, he’d used his nigh-miraculous attainments in medicine, wordlessly convincing everyone present!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi picked up the teacup and took a sip. Only then did he address them. “Starting today, I’ll take up residence here.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Hu Quan immediately responded, “Sir, there’s an unoccupied residence behind the clinic. I’ll send someone to clean it and provide various basic daily necessities. Will you need servants to wash your clothes and make your tea or a chef to prepare your meals?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi shook his head. “No need for that. Have them clean the rooms and get the courtyard in order. That’ll be plenty.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Hu Quan nodded and made a mental note of this.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He’d been the Apricot Clinic’s steward to begin with, and he was responsible for all sorts of chores and trifles. Now that he was convinced of Su Yi’s skill, he was willing to serve.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Going forward, you’ll remain in charge of all of the Apricot Clinic’s affairs,” said Su Yi. “Everyone can continue their jobs as usual; I’ll simply be responsible for expenses and revenue.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He certainly had no plans of spending all his time and energy on the clinic.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He thought about it, then added, “Of course, if you encounter particularly confusing symptoms or life-threatening illnesses, you can call on me. Leave ordinary illnesses to our physicians.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As soon as he said this, a man so stalwart, he looked as if he’d been forged of iron walked into the clinic.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Hu Quan and the rest of the staff recognized him at a glance. He’d been there when the clinic first opened its doors, but when he saw that Wu Guangbin wasn’t present, he’d cursed, turned, and left.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Yet here it was again. He’d come back.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Um…. Young Lord Su, I know I was rude earlier, but I hope you can forgive me.” The man awkwardly clasped his fist and apologized.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“You’ve never married, right?” Su Yi’s expression was rather strange.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The man hurriedly nodded. “That’s right.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi took out a piece of paper, wrote a brief message, and passed it to him. “You’re not sick. Follow these instructions and you’ll make a full recovery within three months.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The stalwart man accepted the paper and glanced at it. Despite himself, he was confused. “‘Refrain from…’ Uh, what does this character mean?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Despite themselves, Hu Quan and the rest of the staff were curious. They gathered around, but when they saw Su Yi’s “prescription”, every last one of them burst into laughter.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Brother, this character is pronounced ‘nong’. It has the hand radical on the left, and the radicals for ‘up’ and ‘down’ on the right. Combined, you get….. Well, you ought to understand what I’m getting at, right?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Hu Quan smiled ambiguously as he offered the man his advice.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The man was stunned, but a moment later, realization hit him. His swarthy face flushed red, and he covered his face and fled in embarrassment.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Hahahaha….!” Huang Qianjun finally understood. He clutched his gut and laughed. “He looks so big and strong, yet he likes ‘one-handed self combat’!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Hu Quan and the others laughed too, ambiguous smiles on their faces.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">All men understood this!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">After this little interlude, the atmosphere at the Apricot Clinic became far more harmonious, and the air was full of good cheer.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When he saw that there weren’t any more patients, Su Yi rose. “Take me to my residence so I can have a look around.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Hu Quan hurriedly called two servants, who led the way. After passing through the clinic’s back door, they quickly arrived at a clean, silent courtyard.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">At the same time, in a teahouse not far from the Apricot Clinic….</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">……</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Elder Wu, look at this prescription he wrote! This combination of medicinal herbs and supplements is practically divinely inspired!” sighed a middle-aged man.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His name was Tan Feng, and he was one of the Apricot Clinic’s physicians.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Two others sat beside him. One was a white-haired elder, while the other was a dark-skinned, grim-faced man.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The first was Wu Guangbin, a physician famed throughout the city.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The other was called Wei Tong. Just like Tan Feng, he was one of the clinic’s three practicing physicians.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">However, after learning that Su Yi, the live-in son-in-law, was to take over the clinic’s management, all three of them had come up with excuses to skip work and hide in the teahouse. They planned to wait there and watch Su Yi get kicked out.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">None of them had anticipated that even after waiting for so long, no such thing had happened.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">On the contrary, the patients waiting outside the clinic each received a cure!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This surprised all three physicians. They couldn’t help but call some of the patients into the teahouse to press them for details.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The result practically made them jump.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi, the overlooked, disrespected live-in son-in-law of the Wen Family, really was proficient in the medical arts!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Elder Wu, Su Yi’s method for curing ‘Echo Worms’ really opened my eyes,” sighed Wei Tong.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">One of the patients Su Yi treated had an unusual malady; every time he spoke, a voice within his stomach echoed every word, as if there were some malevolent entity hidden within his body.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But Su Yi said that the patient had inadvertently eaten an Echo Worm. He then picked up a Pharmacopeia and had the patient read each medicine’s name out loud.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Every time the patient read an ingredient’s name, the worm in his stomach repeated it.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But when the patient said the word “omphalia grass”, the voice within its stomach remained silent.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi then immediately ordered a servant to fetch a stalk of omphalia grass and have the patient swallow it. This cured the patient on the spot, as the man coughed up a fingernail-sized bug—the Echo Worm.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Tan Feng sighed along with him. “Also, the way he used silver needles to treat that patient’s arm was entirely unexpected! Even now, I can’t figure out how he pulled it off!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wu Guangbin had been quiet all this time, but he suddenly rose to his feet and strode towards Apricot Clinic.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Elder Wu, what are you doing?” Tan Feng and Wu Tong hurriedly rose as well.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I’m naturally going to apologize!” said Wu Guangbin without so much as a second look.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Tan Feng and Wei Tong glanced at each other, then hurried after him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">……</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The residence behind the clinic.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Three stand-alone, grey-tiled rooms surrounded a courtyard in the shape of the character “品”. One side had a vegetable bed and pergola, and there was a mighty locust tree in the center. A well stood beside it, but the metal was flecked with rust, and chains kept it completely sealed.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">No one had lived there in a long time, so the entire residence was covered in dust and spiderwebs, and the courtyard was full of weeds.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was almost noon, and the sun was blazing hot.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Hu Quan commanded two servants to sweep up and add various accouterments.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi, meanwhile, stood beneath the locust tree and surveyed the courtyard. His brow furrowed slightly.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Sir, the courtyard has been in disrepair for years, but once we get everything in order, it should be comfortable and convenient,” said Hu Quan with a smile.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Has anything bad happened here before?” asked Su Yi, seemingly out of nowhere.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Hu Quan froze, scrunched up his brow in thought, then said, “Now that you mention it, yes. I recall one such incident.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“It was about nine years ago. One of our clinic’s physicians lived here, as well as two apprentice apothecaries. But then, one night, all three of them died suddenly.” Hu Quan pointed to the sealed well. “The physician drowned within the well, but when they pulled up his corpse, his flesh had rotted off. The two apprentices’ corpses were nothing but shriveled skins, and they were hanging from the branches of that locust tree.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As he spoke, Hu Quan pointed to the tree at the center of the courtyard.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi’s eyes flashed. “Shriveled hides? Were their flesh and organs nowhere to be found?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Hu Quan was shocked. “How did you know?”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi didn’t explain. “The residence has been in disrepair ever since, right?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“That’s right. Everyone says it’s haunted… Uh, sir, it’s not that I want to force you to live here, but this is the clinic’s only residence,” Hu Quan hurriedly explained, feeling a bit frantic.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi smiled. “No harm done. Way I see it, this place looks pretty good.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun said ingratiatingly, “Brother Su, won’t you be lonely all by yourself in such a large residence? How about I arrange for some beauties to accompany you? I guarantee both their looks and personalities will satisfy you!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi smiled faintly, but it didn’t reach his eyes. “Do you really think I’m that degenerate?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“How could I?” Huang Qianjun broke into cold sweats and immediately denied it. “Brother Su, don’t misunderstand!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He’d just tried to butter Su Yi up, only to realize that he’d used too much force.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">To his relief, Su Yi merely thought for a moment, then said, “There is actually something you can help me with. Go to the market and fetch me a rooster, the fiercer the better. Also, I need some fresh-cut willow branches and a three-foot-long piece of tempered ten-year peach wood.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">What does he need that stuff for?&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Although he found it strange, the opportunity to do something for Su Yi filled him with delight. He immediately turned and scampered off. “Brother Su, please wait a bit. I’ll be right back!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His words echoed through the courtyard, but Huang Qianjun had already disappeared.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Hu Quan couldn’t help but sigh.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">That Huang Qianjun is an infamous hoodlum young master, yet he’s obeying the Wen Family son-in-law’s every whim. He’s really expanded my horizons.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“Sir, what do you need all that stuff for?”&nbsp;</span><span>Hu Quan was curious too.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">A rooster, peach wood, willow branches…. Don’t the wandering Daoist priests use those to exorcize ghosts? Does he think the residence is haunted?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As soon as this possibility occurred to him, Hu Quan’s heart shook.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A ghost!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Ghosts weren’t at all unfamiliar to the people of Guangling City. There were countless rumors and elaborate tales of vicious ghosts emerging from Mother Ghost Ridge!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I’m preparing just in case.” Su Yi didn’t explain any further.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was then that three figures hurried into the courtyard. When the white-haired elder at the front of the group saw Su Yi, he bowed on the spot. “This humble one is Wu Guanglin. I am ashamed, and have come to apologize!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When Tan Feng and Wei Tong saw this, they hurriedly followed suit.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi glanced at them, then instantly understood. “You didn’t know, so you have nothing to apologize for. This matter ends here. Going forward, the three of you will continue to hold down the Apricot Clinic. You can get up, but I hope this doesn’t happen again.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The three physicians sighed in relief.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Hu Quan was happy too. “I won’t hide it; our new manager might be young, but his medical attainments are superb. You didn’t see it, but…”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Once he started, he kept going, enraptured as he told them all about how Su Yi treated the day’s patients.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">There were numerous details that even the three physicians didn’t understand, but they too were entranced, and their hearts filled with longing.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">By the time Hu Quan finished, their gaze turned respectful whenever they looked at Su Yi.&nbsp;</span></p><hr/><blockquote><b>Translator's Thoughts</b><p dir=\"ltr\">We're officially launched!
