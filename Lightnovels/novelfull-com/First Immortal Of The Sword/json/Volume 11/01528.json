Bang! Bang!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The heavy, forceful sound of kowtowing echoed repeatedly throughout the private dining room.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fu Shan and Nie Beihu were experts long accustomed to bloodshed, but seeing this, they couldn’t help but shudder.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Huang Yunchong’s&nbsp;</span><span>brow</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;knit with flashes of agony. Hidden within his sleeves, his hands clenched, the nails digging into his flesh.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">How could any father bear watching his son forced to kowtow repeatedly? How could he not feel hatred? How could his heart not ache?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But he could only endure!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Today, he’d have no opportunity to lose his temper or get revenge. If he tried, he’d only bring unforeseeable disaster onto the entire Huang Family!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Let’s end this here.” Shortly after, Su Yi suddenly spoke up. He sounded somewhat dispirited.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Yesterday, he predicted that Huang Qianjun would come back for revenge, but he would never have guessed that in the end, he’d just sit there doing nothing while others resolved his problems for him.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This meant that Su Yi had no sense of accomplishment to speak of.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fu Shan sighed in relief, and his taut nerves finally relaxed. He’d been worried that Huang Yunchong would lose control of his emotions and act up.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fortunately, his concerns didn’t become a reality.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Thank you…. Young Lord Su, for your mercy!” Huang Yunchong bowed, head held low. His voice was hoarse.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I said it earlier: I don’t like others fighting my battles for me. That said…. You ought to consider yourselves fortunate. You got lucky today.” Su Yu shot Huang Yunchong a deep look. Then, he got up and stepped through the door.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Had he taken action personally, heads would have rolled!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Unfortunately, Huang Yunchong and the others most likely hadn’t realized this. Otherwise, they’d be celebrating the fact that they were still alive.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Ol’ Huang, I advise you to give up on any thoughts of revenge. Otherwise, I’m afraid you’ll risk the lives of the entire Huang Family!” As he watched Su Yi’s departure, Fu Shan gave Huang Yunchong a cold warning before hurrying after Su Yi.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Choose your next steps carefully.” Nie Beihu had no interest in sticking around to watch the show, so he followed the city lord out the door.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Soon, only Huang Yunchong, Huang Qianjun, and Huang Yi remained.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Yunchong tottered, as if he’d lost all the power in his body, and slumped into his chair. His eyes were lifeless, and in an instant, he seemed to grow much older.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Father…..” Huang Qianjun wailed and clutched his bloodied forehead. His face was smeared with blood and tears, making him look strange, bloody, and altogether horrifying.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Meanwhile, Huang Yin clutched the stump of his severed hand. His face was pale and translucent from blood loss.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“One wrong step, and we almost caused a lifetime of regret…..” A long time passed before Huang Yunchong returned to his senses. His voice was raspy as he said, “Child, remember this: before becoming a Grandmaster and a member of the nobility, you must not… you must not seek revenge….”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">By the time he finished giving this command, his voice carried dense exhaustion and bitterness.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Family Head, are you really just going to let this go?” Huang Yin’s eyes were full of unwillingness.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Yunchong suddenly straightened his back, and his expression was chillingly cold. “If you dare cause trouble,” he said, pausing for emphasis between each word, “Don’t blame me for killing a relative in the name of the greater good!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Yin froze, then sank into silence.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">At that moment, Huang Qianjun, the young silkpants, finally understood the cruelty of reality.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Sometimes, even their Huang Family had no choice but to endure their anger in silence!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>And all of this was because of the Wen&nbsp;</span><span>Family’s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;live-in son-in-law….</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>When he recalled this, Huang Qianjun felt bewilderment wash over him. Su Yi was the live-in son-in-law everyone in Guangling City mocked, the cripple who’d lost his entire cultivation.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">How could he possibly have such a terrifying position?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The first floor of the Immortal Gathering House.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As soon as Su Yi appeared in the stairwell, he saw a middle-aged man in brocade robes waiting for him. The man lowered his head and bent at the waist, a toadyish smile on his face. “I just knew you’d avert disaster and return safely, Young Lord Su!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This was none other than the owner of the Immortal Gathering House, Yue Tianhe, an esteemed and powerful figure within Guangling City.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When Su Yi first arrived, Yue Tianhe had gloated over his imminent misfortune, eager to watch the spectacle. Yet now, he was nothing but warm smiles.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“The Immortal Gathering House’s signboard really is hard as can be. It actually didn’t suffer much damage at all.” Su Yi jeered coldly.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Yue Tianhe smiled awkwardly, but he was thick-skinned. He said abashedly, “Young Lord Su, your exaggeration puts me to shame. As an expression of my remorse, I welcome you to dine at our establishment free of charge from now on!”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi responded with a simple “Oh”, but he said no more. He just walked out of the building.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">City Lord Fu Shan and Nie Beihu hurried after him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“City Lord Fu, Commander Nie.” Yue Tianhe hurriedly bowed in greeting.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Consider yourself lucky that nothing untoward happened to Young Lord Su. Or else, I’d have torn down the entire Immortal Gathering House!” Fu Shan snorted coldly, then turned and left without a second look.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was only after Su Yi, Fu Shan, and Nie Beihu disappeared from beyond the gates that Yue Tianhe straightened his back and wiped the cold sweat from his brow.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Even now, his heat pounded with lingering terror, and struggled to calm down.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Had I known that Su Yi was so capable, I wouldn’t have been so negligent….&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Yue Tianhe thought to himself.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>But he suddenly felt rather confused.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">How could a waste like Su Yi get involved with Fu Shan and Nie Beihu?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This completely overturned his imagination!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">…..</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Outside the Immortal Gathering House.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Commander Fu, Young Lord Su, if there’s nothing else, I’ll be on my way,” said Nie Beihu in a low voice.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fu Shan nodded, then commanded, “Do not spread word of today’s incident.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Just as Nie Beihu turned to leave, Su Yi seemed to recall something. He said suddenly, “Commander Nie, you’ve got yourself a good son.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nie Beihu paused midstep. Then, he continued without a second look, but there was a hint of a smile in his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In this father’s heart, his son, Nie Teng, had a strong sense of gratitude and knew how to repay a kind turn. He was naturally pleased with him!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Guangling City is completely mistaken about Su Yi. Who would have guessed he was friends with Lady Spiritjade?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Fortunately, Teng’er has already made a good impression on him. Perhaps, in the future, we can build an even firmer relationship…..</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nie Beihu was already starting to consider the possibilities.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“By now, I imagine you’ve guessed who Lady Spiritjade is?” asked Fu Shan, his smile amiable and his words polite.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi nodded. “I just didn’t anticipate that she’d arrange for people to tail me. Otherwise, I’m afraid you couldn’t possibly have made it to the Immortal Gathering House so quickly.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fu Shan’s smile froze, and he hurriedly explained, “Young Lord Su, Please don’t misunderstand. Lady Spiritjade….”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“You needn’t explain, City Lord Fu. Regardless, you did me a good turn today, and I’ve never liked owing others’ favors. If you ever run into a problem you can’t resolve, pay me a visit.” With that, Su Yi turned and left.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A figure clad in blue disappeared into the flow of pedestrian traffic, solitary and detached from mortal affairs.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I’m afraid that Su Yi has quite a few secrets….” Only after Su Yi disappeared did Fu Shan retract his gaze. He, too, had many doubts, but he was keenly aware that he couldn’t recklessly investigate.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">What mattered now was reporting back to Lady Spiritjade.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">…..</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The City Lord’s estate, a detached residence.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Beneath the lush foliage of a parasol tree, Zijin listened quietly to Fu Shan’s report.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She had a pair of long, smooth jade legs, which offset her tall and slender figure. Her dark hair was up in a casual bun, fully displaying her peerlessly beautiful, egg-shaped face, thin and curved eyebrows, full red lips, and eyes bright as limpid pools. Although she’d intentionally put on a loose-sleeved, plain white dress, it wasn’t enough to disguise her noble air.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">After hearing Fu Shan’s full account, her star-like eyes were thoughtful. “You’re saying that Master Su went there on his own, and that he seemed calm and composed the entire time?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“That’s right. Oh, yes, just before he left, he said something strange,” pondered Fu Shan.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Let’s hear it,” said Zijin with great interest.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“He said he’s never liked relying on others’ power, and that Huang Yunchong and the others got lucky today.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Lucky…?” Zijin’s eyes flashed with unusual light. “It seems that even if you hadn’t gone to his aid, Master Su already had plans for how to handle this. He’s guessed who I am by now, right?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fu Shan nodded.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“How did he react?”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“That….” Fu Shan hesitated, but in the end, he said, “Lady Spiritjade, he already guessed that I had my people observing him in secret over the past few days.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Zijin’s heart clenched. “Is he angry?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fu Shan hurriedly shook his head. “Actually, no. He just said that I’d done him a favor, and that if I ran into any thorny problems down the line, I could go to him for aid.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Zijin nodded. “Uncle Fu, you can leave.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Yes.” Fu Shan turned and left, while Zijin entered one of the stand-alone residence’s other rooms.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Inside, she saw Xiao Tianque’s gaunt figure brewing tea. He seemed leisurely, and his complexion was far rosier than before.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When he saw Zijin enter, he said casually, “I already heard your conversation now. All I can say is, in sending Fu Shan to the Immortal Gathering House, we inadvertently helped Huang Yunchong. Otherwise, with Master Su’s abilities, I’m afraid the Huangs wouldn’t have left the restaurant alive.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Zijin seemed to want to say something, but she hesitated.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“If you want to say something, just say it. It’s not like there’s anyone else here.” Xiao Tianque smiled and shook his head.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Zijin took a deep breath, then said seriously, “Grandpa, the results of our investigations prove that Su Yi…. Master Su isn’t some otherworldly expert or lofty, inscrutable immortal. He’s just the Wen Family’s live-in son-in-law. Why do you still value him so highly?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Xiao Tianque smiled, then sighed, “Once you reach my age, you’ll discover that so-called ‘status’, ‘position’, and ‘authority’ aren’t the least bit important. What matters is your state of mind, your wisdom, and your cultivation!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“With the methods and keen eyesight Master Su displayed that day, I wouldn’t have been surprised to discover that he was a reclusive expert. Yet he turned out to be the ousted disciple of the Blueriver Sword Manor and the disdained live-in son-in-law of the Wen Family. That’s far stranger!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His gaze suddenly deepened. “I can guarantee that Su Yi has secrets we can’t possibly uncover. That’s the scariest thing about him!”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Xiao Tianque looked up. He could see that Zijin was still doubtful, so he laughed, “No need to overthink it, lass. Don’t forget; since I started taking the concoction he prescribed me, my wounds have healed almost completely. He brought me back from the brink of death. This alone is enough to prove his capabilities!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Zijin nodded repeatedly. “The medicinal recipe he gave us really is mysterious.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Xiao Tianque suddenly recalled something, and he said gravely, “Tomorrow morning, we’ll be meeting with Master Su. You must remember to mind your manners; you mustn’t be the slightest bit negligent.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Zijin couldn’t help but feel irritated. “Grandpa, how many times have you told me that over the past few days? Do you really think I don’t know how to behave myself?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Xiao Tianque burst into laughter, and he said casually, “Forgive my nagging. When we returned from the mountains that day, I thought I was sure to die. I would never have guessed a chance encounter with Master Su would give me a new lease on life. I…. I’m happy!”&nbsp;</span></p><hr/><blockquote><b>Translator's Thoughts</b><p>If it's not clear, a shop's signboard is like... a symbol of its reputation.
