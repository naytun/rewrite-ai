What types of wind and rain</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">&nbsp;hadn’t</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;he overcome?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He knew better than anyone that unbelievable methods, eccentric masters, and rare geniuses existed in great abundance.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The youth before him was undoubtedly not simple in the least!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“You were tailing us in secret earlier, weren’t you?” Zijin scrunched up her brow.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The long-robed elder was at a loss for words. Before Su Yi could respond, he said, “Don’t talk nonsense, girl. Given our young friend’s talents, how could he do something so shameful?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As he spoke, he turned to Su Yi and cupped his fist. His eyes carried a hint of admiration. “My young friend, might I ask if you’ve noticed anything else?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Grandfather, he…..&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Zijin’s eyes widened in disbelief.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">With her grandfather’s status, even if you searched all nineteen cities of Cloudriver Prefecture, who was worthy of him “cupping his fist in respect”?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She couldn’t help but take a second glance at Su Yi. He was tall and thin, with handsome features. He wasn’t at all bad-looking.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">However, his presence was slack and ordinary, as if he didn’t have any cultivation at all….</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Could it be that….</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">His cultivation is so lofty and profound that it’s impossible to discern? Could he really be so terrifying?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Zijin’s family background was exceptional, and from a young age, she’d heard her elders’ tales of Earthly Immortals. They might look ordinary, but in truth, they’d long since transcended the Martial Dao. They were terrifying beings of enormous power!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Is it possible that this is no mere youth, but rather an elder capable of maintaining a youthful appearance?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When this thought occurred to her, Zijin’s heart shook, and a hint of bewilderment appeared on her face.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi would never have guessed that a mere cupped fist would give rise to so many thoughts in Zijin’s mind.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In the face of the long-robed elder’s questions, he said calmly, “Pardon my rudeness, but at your third level ‘Inner Furnace’ cultivation, I’m afraid you won’t be able to break through even if you pluck both Six Yin Grass and Extreme Yang Flowers.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi paused for a moment, then continued, “Or rather, you’ve most likely long-since known that with your age and foundations, there’s no way you can take so much as a single step further down the Martial Dao by relying on ordinary cultivation methods. That’s why you decided to use the power of these two spiritual medicines to forcibly break through, right?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The long-robed elder froze, and he felt a chill run down his spine. It was as if he’d been laid entirely bare, and Su Yi could see through all of his secrets.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When Su Yi first guessed the source of his wounds and the purpose of this expedition, the old man only half believed him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But now, he was absolutely certain that this youth was an expert!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Grandpa, how does he know all that?” Zijin couldn’t help but call out. She’d lost control of her emotions, and her extraordinarily beautiful face was awash with shock.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But after reawakening the memories of his past life, such a simple deduction was simple for Su Yi.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Sir, your insight is astounding. I can’t help but admire you!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The long-robed elder sighed and cupped his fist in respect once more. Even his form of address had changed; he no longer called Su Yi “young friend”, nor did he dare put on airs.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi inwardly nodded.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The Inner Furnace Realm was also known as the Grandmaster Realm!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">With his current incarnation’s seventeen years of life experience, he knew full well that with the elder’s status as a “Grandmaster of the Martial Dao”, he wasn’t just impressive by Guangling City’s standards; he was like a giant of Cloudriver Prefecture!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">After all, in a spiritually-barren land like the Great Zhou, reaching the Grandmaster level was enough to earn you a noble title and intimidate an entire region.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Despite the long-robed elder’s status, he was treating Su Yi with respect. That alone was a rare sight.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Sir, if you can determine my grandfather’s injuries, you must know a way to treat them and save his life, right?” Zijin couldn’t help but ask. Her tender beauty and goose egg-shaped face lit up with expectation. A Grandmaster was like a dragon; the masses could only look up to them.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Sometimes, a single person could determine the rise and fall of a peak-level clan!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">And her grandfather was no ordinary Martial Dao Grandmaster, either.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">If he died from his wounds, it was sure to deal a devastating blow to their entire family!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Zijin was frantic with worry. When she saw Su Yi’s seemingly miraculous abilities, she felt as if she’d clutched her last thread of hope.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The long-robed elder felt a thread of hope too. He cupped his fist once more and said solemnly, “This old-timer is called Xiao Tianque. Within Cloudriver Prefecture, I’m somewhat well known. If you can save my life, I won’t forget the favor!”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He was a mighty Grandmaster of the Martial Dao, and had been for many years. He was well-aware that even another Grandmaster couldn’t possibly have seen through his injuries at a glance!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This alone was enough for him to consider Su Yi “mysterious and inscrutable.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“If I couldn’t treat such trifling wounds, why would I bother saying all that?” Su Yi laughed. Xiao Tianque and his granddaughter both lit up.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“So long as you can treat my wounds, you can ask for anything you’d like in exchange. I won’t refuse any request!” Xiao Tianque’s expression was utterly grave as he made his solemn vow.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But on the inside, he felt great trepidation.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The way he saw it, with Su Yi’s miraculous abilities, ordinary compensation would be nowhere near enough!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But he was in no position to concern himself with that. He’d do whatever it took to live through this, no matter the cost!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi mulled it over, then said, “From your perspective, this might be lifesaving benevolence, but to me, this is but a trifle. How about this? Just give me a token ‘consultation fee’, whatever you see fit.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“What?” Both Xiao Tianque and Zijin were stunned. Their eyes widened, and they dared not believe their ears.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Is there a problem?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“No, it’s not that.” Zijin hurriedly shook her head, her expression strange. She stuttered, “I just wouldn’t… wouldn’t have expected it to be so… so…. Simple….”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Her voice trailed off, and she sounded embarrassed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Su Yi didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">&nbsp;I can fix this with a snap of my fingers. Why make it difficult for you?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Xiao Tianque let out a long sigh, and he smiled bitterly. “You don’t understand, lass. Someone of his level doesn’t care about a bit of money. He’s simply doing this so we don’t owe him a favor.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Ah, so that’s it.” Zijin instantly felt enlightened.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">That was so like an expert; he naturally didn’t need favors from people of their level!&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Zijin hurriedly took a silver note from her purse and presented it respectfully with both hands. Voice chattering, she said, “Sir, here is a ten-thousand-tael silver note. It's a token of our appreciation, so please accept it.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Ten thousand taels? And they’re just handing it over casually?&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Despite himself, Su Yi was stunned. Only then did he realize that this grandfather-granddaughter duo was far wealthier than he imagined.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>It’s worth noting that the Wen Family, as one of the Three Great Clans of Guangling City, only gave Wen Lingzhao and Wen Lingxue three hundred&nbsp;</span><span>taels</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;of spending money per month.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Ten thousand is too much.” Su Yi shook his head. Although he was in dire need of money to buy medicinal ingredients, he disdained making a fortune off something like this.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When Xiao Tianque saw this, he sighed inwardly. He was increasingly certain that the lofty expert before him didn’t care about money at all.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Or in other words, to this mysterious youth, saving his life and treating his wounds…. Was really no big deal!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He wasn’t greedy for wealth, nor did he want them to owe him a favor, yet he could see through him at a glance. If this wasn’t an expert straight out of a legend, Xiao Tianque would even be willing to pluck out his own eyes! In an instant, he became even more respectful toward Su Yi.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He was a wily old-timer, and farsighted, too. He inwardly decided that, once his wounds healed, he’d build a relationship with this lofty expert, no matter what!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But Zijin seemed troubled. She whispered, “But ten-thousand-tael notes are the smallest I have on me.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Su Yi was at a loss for words.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">How wealthy does a family of the Great Zhou have to be for a little girl like this to be so showy with her money?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But before he could say anything, Xiao Tianque said solemnly, “Sir, to the ordinary citizens of this world, ten thousand taels of silver is indeed a massive sum. However, to me, it’s nothing at all, nor is it anywhere near enough to express my gratitude.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“It’s just as you said: to you, this is naught but a trifle, but to me, this is life-saving kindness!”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">With that, he bowed at the waist and said sincerely, “Please, accept it. Only then can my granddaughter and I feel at ease.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When she saw her grandfather bow with such politeness, Zijin was frantic. “Sir, you might laugh when I say this, but within the Great Zhou, one million taels of gold isn’t enough to exchange for the life of a Grandmaster like my grandfather, never mind a mere ten thousand taels of silver.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Please….. Accept it. Otherwise, my grandfather will spend his life tormented by guilt.” As she spoke, she, too, bowed and proffered the silver note.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi felt a bit ridiculous.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>He’d thought this a trifle, a snap of his fingers.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Who would have thought they’d be so determined to throw money at me…?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He couldn’t be bothered to refuse, so he simply accepted it and smiled. “Alright, you two needn’t be so courteous going forward, or this ‘consultation fee’ will burn my fingers.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Xiao Tianque hurriedly rose, his face nothing but smiles.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Zijin sighed in relief. Her brow visibly relaxed, and she looked delighted.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“If you want to treat your wounds, in addition to taking medicine for a week, you’ll need to use a secret art to cleanse your body of corpse poison. Only then can you eliminate all latent danger.” As Su Yi spoke, he wrote out a prescription. It included over thirty types of medicinal herbs in total, but none of them were particularly rare or valuable.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The only item on the list that was the least bit precious was the ten-year-molt of a Jade Toad.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But Su Yi trusted that something like that wouldn’t trouble a Grandmaster like Xiao Tianque.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Thank you for writing me the recipe!” Xiao Tianque held the prescription firmly and bowed once more, his heart full of excitement.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi nodded. “Take this medicine for seven days. After the week is up, wait for me here, and I’ll help you completely disperse any poison lingering within your body.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I have other matters to attend to, so I’ll be on my way.” With that, he turned and left.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Xiao Tianque and Zijin watched until he faded into the distance. Only then did Zijin seem to come to her senses. Her pretty eyes darted about, and she whispered, “Grandpa, if not for him seeing through your secrets, I’d be certain he was a scam artist.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Xiao Tianque snorted derisively. “Girl, don’t take nonsense. Ten thousand taels of silver, that’s all! How could a man like that care about such a paltry sum? Look at how he carries himself! He’s truly got the air of an immortal!<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Remember: next time you see him, you need to be more modest and respectful. You cannot be the least bit negligent!” As he reached the end of his warning, the old man’s gaze turned utterly severe.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Zijin stuck out her tongue, but she said obediently, “Don’t worry, Grandpa. I’ll keep that in mind.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Xiao Tianque grunted, then sighed with emotion, “And here I thought I’d only have a few days to live after returning from Mother Ghost Ridge. Who would have thought I’d have a chance encounter with such a lofty figure? He showed me the right path and wrote out a prescription. What…. What did I do to deserve such fortune?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Suddenly, he hit himself on the head, and he looked vexed, as if he’d only just remembered something. “I must be going senile! Just now, I forgot to ask that gentleman his name!”</span></p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "original_title": "Chapter 7 - A Mystical Immortal Air", "chapterId": 148655}
