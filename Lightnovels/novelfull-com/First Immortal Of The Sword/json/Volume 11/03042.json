She said it had belonged to her late grandfather.</span></p><p data-uid=\"2c5f496b-4cfe-43ff-89b0-8f71b162e56f\"><span>Occasionally, A’Li took out her beast skin and charcoal to converse with Su Yi, but she said little. All Su Yi knew was that they were at the foot of Southern Wilds Mountain, near the Little Blue River.</span></p><p data-uid=\"454ca937-2605-4755-af9d-7e8b45188721\"><span>The village was called Cloud Stream Village, and it was home to about six hundred people. Most of them made their living hunting and gathering herbal medicines.</span></p><p data-uid=\"5f71e7e5-4c6b-489f-84df-ec8ad4c2436e\"><span>A’Li’s parents died when she was little.

Although other villagers brought him back, his wounds were too severe, and he passed away shortly after, leaving A’Li all alone.</span></p><p data-uid=\"9b51f534-62e6-4da1-887c-4fbc2a0f3a47\"><span>A’Li said she had an older sister too. It was just that when A’Li was five years old, a passing immortal took note of her and accepted her as a disciple. A’Li’s sister had left the village to cultivate in the immortal’s sect.</span></p><p data-uid=\"73f7c242-577f-44b1-a4a5-8d50ff7770e2\"><span>A’Li’s grandfather had agreed to let her big sister leave with the immortal, but they’d lost contact since. Ten years had passed since then.</span></p><p data-uid=\"8d15a60f-d783-476d-992e-084bfdc1d556\"><span>When A’Li told him of this, Su Yi could sense her grief and dejection.</span></p><p data-uid=\"c5646176-2cfb-4cb2-aab2-cd62cef35ec9\"><span>As night approached, after A’Li helped Su Yi apply the day’s medicines, Su Yi couldn’t help but ask, “A’Li, how did you lose your voice?”&nbsp;</span></p><p data-uid=\"451f31ef-8e3a-4467-abc0-548e55f3dfc0\"><span>He’d recovered some of his vitality, and he could sit up, albeit with difficulty.</span></p><p data-uid=\"2efd6ed3-a794-412f-a0fa-b263069552c3\"><span>A’Li’s expression shifted dramatically.
