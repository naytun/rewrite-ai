How about…. I help you finish getting even?”</span></p><p data-uid=\"7a89fafa-1621-488f-911e-5596fd89d4c9\"><span>Both the distant onlookers and the experts of factions hostile to Su Yi were visibly stricken.</span></p><p data-uid=\"9ece2b51-1894-4be4-9387-dbdbb297829c\"><span>Feng Jinghai, Lu Dongqiu, and the others’ expressions were completely wooden. They were so overcome by despair that they’d gone completely numb.</span></p><p data-uid=\"ca0793e6-2a93-404f-80a3-8cbe1b1e6ab4\"><span>But Su Yi was a bit frustrated, and he felt strange. He wasn’t used to sponging off another like this. Both in this life and his last, no matter what wind and waves he faced, he’d always faced them with his own power.</span></p><p data-uid=\"4796e3bb-4dae-426d-976f-96a6ce826f33\"><span>Besides, it wasn’t like he was powerless to resolve this situation.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-uid=\"8dd16258-1882-4fb6-b6e9-3b89f118641b\"><span>At the end of the day, Su Yi’s pride and mentality wouldn’t let him stomach this with courage in his convictions. He hadn’t gotten this far relying on other people.</span></p><p data-uid=\"a1285db6-64f2-46a4-8dfa-07211c37288e\"><span>Su Yi thought for a moment, then said, “Fellow Daoist, there’s an attack I’d like to show you.”</span></p><p data-uid=\"247795a6-286a-483b-802b-81f2b3fc0332\"><span>Daoist Master Red Cloud was stunned, and a strange light appeared in her clear eyes. It seemed she’d realized what Su Yi was thinking, and a faint hint of a smile tugged at her lips. She nodded. “You have my full attention.”</span></p><p data-uid=\"28bad582-206b-4ad1-b1f0-3cf1e57a88f5\"><span>Su Yi then swept his gaze across Feng Jinghai and the others. “I’ll give you an opportunity. If even one of you can block my sword, all of you can live.”</span></p><p data-uid=\"89d7b1df-3640-4f2c-bf30-00700660a2e0\"><span>Feng Jinghai, Lu Dongqiu, and the others reacted as if awakening from a dream. They looked at each other, and all of them felt a thread of hope rekindle.</span></p><p data-uid=\"b56923ec-63d3-4770-b249-08ce80ed85ce\"><span>Just one strike, nothing more. If they joined forces and gave it everything they had, they surely had an opportunity!</span></p><p data-uid=\"c5111951-6963-4d7c-80b1-c03e04f38cf0\"><span>“Is that true?” Feng Jinghai dared not believe his ears.</span></p><p data-uid=\"a58cfa21-7dde-4bcb-8a69-5f2fe6f46d18\"><span>If Daoist Master Red Cloud were the one to attack, they’d have given up already.</span></p><p data-uid=\"3aa1712d-ca98-43e3-8c13-91b37a5718c7\"><span>But that didn’t apply to Su Yi.</span></p><p data-uid=\"93c3c0ad-e9f8-456d-a36d-5c2f524bbff4\"><span>“I will guarantee it,” Daoist Master Red Cloud said casually.</span></p><p data-uid=\"53e9f01e-7f5d-4d40-855e-b40f15516e49\"><span>Feng Jinghai and the others cast aside their reservations.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-uid=\"52b63ea5-aaa9-4a57-9e87-266595579d1a\"><span>“Activate!”</span></p><p data-uid=\"70a1ce9b-a8f8-4e09-8193-8b359d7884cd\"><span>Feng Jinghai’s sleeves billowed around him as he summoned twenty-four dazzling spirit pearls. They formed a perfect ring around him, protecting him on all sides.</span></p><p data-uid=\"e098882d-ce58-4093-88fa-d64848c5dad0\"><span>The Twenty-Four Lunar...</span></p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "original_title": "Chapter 1431 - The Five Realms of the Immortal Dao", "chapterId": 199085}
