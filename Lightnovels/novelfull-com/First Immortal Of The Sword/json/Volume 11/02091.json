Aren’t you afraid of cutting your tongue on your sharp words?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Kcch!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Before it had even finished speaking, sword qi flashed through the air and cleaved toward the gray sparrow.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The gray sparrow shrieked and shifted to the side in a flash.

It’s unbelievably quick.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“I just disdain to attack an ant like you.
