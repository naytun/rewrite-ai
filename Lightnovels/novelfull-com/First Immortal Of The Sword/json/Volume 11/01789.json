What could be more joyous?” Su Yi flung the empty gourd to the side, then smiled, a hint of wildness in the depths of his gaze.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Pride comes before the fall. What a pity.” The beautiful, elegant Madam Paulownia Blossom sighed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“What pity? Let’s kill him first!” The Yang Ardent Daoist bellowed. He was the first to charge into the fray.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His hair and beard were sparse, and he was aged and decrepit, like a candle flickering in the wind. However, he had the most explosive temper of the group, and when he attacked, his figure blazed like a freshly-lit furnace, stirring up searing currents of flame.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Boom!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He stepped forward and slapped, attacking through the air.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Dazzling crimson xiantian qi shone between his fingers, like divine flames, unbridled and explosive.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The Crimson Yang Palm Imprint!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This was a martial art as profound as a Daoist Magic. The palm blazed like the sun, with enough heat to incinerate mountains, boil seas, and melt rocks.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As the palm imprint flew through the air, it lit up the night sky like the rise of a blazing sun, illuminating both heaven and earth and burning the nearby vegetation to cinders.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Situ Gong’s eyelids twitched. He could tell at a glance that the Yang Ardent Daoist had gone all out. He was attacking to kill, without holding anything out.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He obviously saw Su Yi as his mortal foe!<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This was a life-or-death battle. It didn’t matter what your cultivation was, or what your background was.

The firelight was dazzling, and they couldn’t remain calm.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>This was the might of a Xiantian Martial Ancestor. Every movement transcended Grandmasters, and they possessed innate “xiantian” power. They were endlessly close to Earthly Immortals!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“As paltry as the glow of a firefly.” Su Yi’s gaze was tranquil. It was only when the palm imprint drew near that he waved his hand.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Boom!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A burst of power emblazoned with the charm of the Grand Dao swept forth.
