Tomorrow, just continue participating in the Orchid Terrace Dharma Assembly as if nothing happened.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Yuan Heng hurriedly acknowledged his orders.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Meanwhile.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Ge Qian took a long detour, passing over a dozen streets.
