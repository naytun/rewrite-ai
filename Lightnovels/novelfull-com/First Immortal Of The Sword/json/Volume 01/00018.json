Servants were as numerous as the clouds, and the entire estate was extraordinarily lively.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Today was the dowager’s eightieth birthday, and the Wen Family had been busy with preparations for days.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It wasn’t just the branch members who’d come to join in the festivities; many major powers and members of factions on good terms with the Wen Family had come to celebrate too.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Word of tonight’s birthday banquet had spread throughout Guangling City, and everyone was paying attention.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi, however, wasn’t concerned about any of this.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He was just an overlooked live-in son-in-law. No one would ask any questions if he didn’t participate.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Or so he thought.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Brother-in-law!” Just as Su Yi returned home, he saw a petite, graceful figure standing there waving at him. Her elegantly beautiful face was nothing but smiles.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">At sixteen, Wen Lingxue was a pure and blossoming beauty.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“What are you standing there for?” Su Yi smiled back.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I’m waiting for you, of course.” Wen Lingxue stepped up to greet him and affectionately wrapped her arm around his. “Brother-in-law, just now, my mom said that when you got back, you were to participate in the birthday banquet too.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Me?” Su Yi was stunned.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue explained, “She said it was on my grandmother’s orders.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi’s eyes narrowed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue’s grandmother was none other than the Wen Family dowager, Liang Wenbi. She occupied a transcendent position within the family; even Family Head Wen Changjing dared not go against her orders.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A year ago, it was Liang Wenbi who personally decided his and Wen Lingzhao’s marriage agreement. Wen Lingzhao, her parents, and the other clansmen’s objections made no difference at all!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi nodded. “Let’s go.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">After reawakening the memories of his past life, he’d thought to himself that he ought to find an opportunity to talk to the family dowager and ask about what happened back then.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The scattered residences of the Wen Family estate were bustling with activity as guests came, one after another, to offer their congratulations.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The Wen Family was one of Guangling City’s Three Great Clans, and their foundations and connections were exceptional. The current leader was Wen Changjing, who had two younger brothers: Wen Changqing and Wen Changtai.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Them aside, the</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Wen Family had several branches, which split off and formed even more branches over time. Today, the Wen Family numbered over a thousand people in total.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Today, countless clansmen would reconnect, and numerous guests would converge, resulting in an extraordinary spectacle.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The area around the clan hall had long since been prepared, and it now held a sumptuous feast.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Lingxue, you’re here!” As soon as Su Yi and Wen Lingxue arrived, the numerous youths waiting outside the clan hall called out to her in greeting, one after another.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">These were members of the Wen Family’s younger generation, and most of them were close to Wen Lingxue in age.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">However, without exception, their brows furrowed when they saw Su Yi. They pointedly ignored him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Except for one youth in brocade robes. “Su Yi,” he said in obvious displeasure, “Who do you think you are? There’s no seat for you here. Hurry up and leave. Don’t even think about ruining the mood!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Shaobei.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He was a handsome, talented member of the Wen Family’s younger generation.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">However, he was born into a branch family, so his status was inferior to Wen Lingxue and other main-branch disciples.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As soon as Wen Shaobei spoke up, the others laughed and chimed in their agreement.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi had married into the family as a live-in son-in-law, and throughout the past year, everyone in the family looked down on him. Worse, they saw him as a good-for-nothing. Even the servants dared mock him openly.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Wen Lingxue scowled. “Wen Shaobei, listen up! It was my grandmother who told me to&nbsp;</span><span>bring Brother-in-law</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;to join us at the banquet! Now you’re trying to kick him out? Are you trying to go against my grandmother’s wishes?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“That….” Wen Shaobei was instantly at a loss for words. The others were stunned as well, and their jaws clamped shut. There was no way they’d dare go against the dowager’s orders!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“Let’s just chat on our own,” he said, feigning casual ease. “We can just pretend&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">he</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;doesn’t exist.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The members of the Wen Family’s younger generation immediately formed a circle, excluding Su Yi and ignoring him completely, as if he were invisible.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Since Wen Lingxue stood with him, they ignored her too.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi naturally wouldn’t concern himself over something like this. He called Wen Lingxue over to the side and whispered, “Lingxue, after the birthday banquet, come pay me a visit. I have something to give you.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Ah? What is it?” she asked curiously.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi smiled. “You’ll find out.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Almost immediately after he said this, someone cried out, “Cousin Jueyuan is here!”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Wen Shaobei and the girls all looked over. Even some of the nearby guests and elders&nbsp;</span><span>stared</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">They then saw a youth in white robes approaching from a distance. He had sharp, sword-like eyebrows and bright eyes, and he looked dignified and impressive. His looks and bearing stood out from the crowd.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Wen Jueyuan! The most outstanding talent of the Wen Family’s younger generation!” someone sighed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Ah, so it was Cousin Jueyuan.” Wen Lingxue’s pretty face lit up with admiration too.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Jueyuan was the son of Family Head Wen Changjing. He entered Pinecloud Sword Manor at nine years old. At thirteen, he became a disciple of Blueriver Sword Manor’s outer sect. Then, just four short years later, he was promoted to the inner sect in a single attempt.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He’d spent his life cultivating, and he’d already reached the fourth layer of the Blood Circulation Realm, “Refining Bone”!&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This level of accomplishment was, within Guangling City, enough to make even major powers sigh over their own inferiority!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Jueyuan was already effectively the leader of the family’s younger generation!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>He walked over and looked at&nbsp;</span><span>Wen</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Lingxue, Wen Shaobei, and the other youths, then gently commanded, “Today is my grandmother’s birthday. You’d best be on your best behavior. Don’t do anything to embarrass the family in front of our guests.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As for Su Yi? Wen Jueyuan ignored him too.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Yes.” All of them hurriedly voiced their agreement.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Jueyuan nodded, but said no more. Instead, he walked directly into the clan hall and took a seat.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">At tonight’s banquet, only high-ranked elders and the very pinnacle of the younger generation were qualified to dine within the clan hall!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The likes of Wen Lingxue and Wen Shaobei currently had no such qualifications.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Thus, when they looked at&nbsp;</span><span>Wen</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Jueyuan, their gazes carried a hint of irrepressible jealousy. They couldn’t help wondering when they’d make it to that level too.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“If my big sister was here, she could definitely sit inside,” said Wen Lingxue with an air of regret</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">No one argued with her. Wen Lingzhao was already a disciple of Heaven’s Origin Academy! That status alone qualified her to sit with the family higher-ups as their equal.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I heard that this birthday banquet is different,” whispered one of the girls seated near Wen Shaobei. “It’s of the utmost importance to the entire Wen Family.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Another youth added, “I heard from my father that damaging rumors about the Wen Family are spreading throughout the city. There are people saying that we’re sure to lose our place among the Three Great Clans within ten years.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Yet another youth muttered, “We’re hosting this banquet specifically to resolve this issue. The more influential characters who participate, the better it’ll be for the family. If we make a good enough showing, those damaging rumors will disappear on their own.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“We’ll just have to wait and see how capable First and Second Uncle are,” said Wen Shaobei. “As for Third Uncle, heh heh….”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He glanced at the nearby Wen Lingxue, but left the rest unsaid.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Within the Wen Family’s main line of descent, Wen Changjing was the family head and held the most authority. He also had the most extensive network, and he never had any shortage of famous and influential guests.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Wen Changqing was the main line’s second&nbsp;</span><span>elder</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">, and he was in charge of the family’s properties and businesses. He, too, had a deep and expensive network.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changtai was different. Although he was the main line’s third elder, he had an unsophisticated nature, and his talent was mediocre. Add that to a weak cultivation, and he had few connections at all. His position within the family wasn’t at all high.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">If he weren’t Wen Changjing and Wen Changqing’s little brother, others might even look down on him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Although Wen Shaobei left the rest of his words unsaid, how could Wen Lingxue miss what he was implying?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Her beautiful face darkened into a scowl. He made fun of Su Yi earlier, and now he was talking smack about her father. Of course she was angry!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">And yet, she couldn’t really argue.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She knew full well that her father… really was a bit overly unexceptional….</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As she thought this, she felt stifled, and her spirits sank.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was then that a big hand patted her on the shoulder. Immediately afterward, Su Yi whispered in her ear, “Lingxue, during our time on this planet, we’ll inevitably become the targets of cold glances and mocking words. If you’re weaker than the person insulting you, there’s no harm in enduring their insults. But if you endure and retreat blindly even when you’re strong enough to fight back, you’ll only encourage their arrogant blustering.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue thought it over, then took a deep breath. “I understand, Brother-in-law.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">With that, she walked right up to Wen Shaobei and said icily, “Apologize.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Her gaze was clear, but her words were cold as ice. Wen Shaobei and the other youths were whispering amongst themselves when they stopped, dazed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Lingxue, what do you mean by that? We were just chatting. How did we offend you?” Wen Shaobei furrowed his brow.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue seemed incomparably imposing, and her clear eyes flashed like thunder as they bore into Wen Shaobei.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“If you don’t apologize,” she said, pausing for emphasis between each word, “I’ll go tell my uncles everything you just said. I’ll be curious to see whether they let you off or not!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;“I….” Wen Shaobei looked uncertain. Those beside him had all shut their mouths, not daring to get involved.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">No matter what, Wen Lingxue was a member of the main bloodline!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Her father was the third&nbsp;</span><span>elder</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;of the main bloodline, Family Head Wen Changjing’s biological younger brother. In terms of status, mere branch members like them couldn’t even begin to compare to her.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>And&nbsp;</span><span>Wen</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Lingxue’s older sister, Wen Lingzhao, was now a disciple of Heaven’s Origin Academy. Even the family head attached enormous importance to her!<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">If, under these circumstances, Wen Lingxue disclosed this matter, there was no need to even question it: Wen Shaobei was the one who’d get in trouble.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I’ll say it once more: apologize!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As everyone watched, Wen Shaobei’s expression changed in rapid succession, and a long time passed before he said anything. Wen Lingxue’s expression grew frostier and frostier. She was just a sixteen-year-old girl, but her anger was shockingly constricting and oppressive.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Finally, Wen Shaobei lowered his head and whispered, his voice as quiet as a gnat, “I…. I was wrong….”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue’s heart instantly filled with indescribable delight, but her voice went cold. “Speak up; I couldn’t hear you.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Shaobei reacted as if he’d been beaten. He slumped, then said bitterly, “Lingxue, I was wrong. Please, don’t take this any further.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The others, meanwhile, were silent as cicadas in winter.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi watched as this played out, and he couldn’t help but nod to himself.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Everyone had to grow up sooner or later.</span></p><hr/><blockquote><b>Translator's Thoughts</b></blockquote>", "images": {}, "success": true, "original_title": "Chapter 18 - The Birthday Banquet", "chapterId": 148722}
