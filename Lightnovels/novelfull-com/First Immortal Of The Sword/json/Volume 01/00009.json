It’s&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">my</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;birthday, so it’s up to me to decide how I spend it.” The girl beside him blinked her beautiful eyes, then smiled. “But later tonight, I’ll celebrate with Mom and Dad.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She paused, then continued, “Besides, my grandmother is turning eighty the day after tomorrow. That’s a major birthday; my parents are busy preparing alongside the rest of the family. They have no time to worry about me.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi’s eyes narrowed slightly, and he nodded.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue’s grandmother was the Wen Family’s dowager, Liang Wenbi. She occupied a transcendent position within the family; even Family Head Wen Changjing didn’t dare go against her wishes.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She was about to turn eighty; the Wen Family naturally dared not be negligent.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Hurry up, Brother-in-law. It’s almost noon!” It was clear Wen Lingxue could barely wait.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Alright.” Su Yi smiled as he caught up to her. At the end of the day, his little sister-in-law had only just turned sixteen, an age like a poem or painting, brimming with youthful vitality.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The Immortal Gathering House.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Guangling City’s largest-scale, highest-level restaurant, considered the top establishment in town.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Those who dined here were either rich or of noble birth.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A common joke went that a single glass of wine at the Immortal Gathering House was comparable to ten years of a poor family’s income!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This was no mere exaggeration.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When Su Yi and Wen Lingxue arrived, the attendants warmly guided them to a private room on the third floor. The decor was old-fashioned and the air smelled of incense.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Seven or eight people were seated inside already. Aside from one lone young man, all of them were girls roughly fifteen years of age.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When Wen Lingxue arrived, she immediately received a warm welcome.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Lingxue, you look stunning today! This is the gift I prepared for you. I hope you’ll pass the test to cultivate at Blueriver Sword Manor soon!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Hee hee, if our classmates found out today was Pinecloud Sword Manor’s number-one beauty’s birthday, I’m afraid they’d stand in line just to deliver presents!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">…..The girls gave her the presents they’d prepared, chattering away as they did so. Their demeanor was both proper and zealous.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi’s gaze swept across the guests. One glance, and he could determine an awful lot.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">These classmates of Wen Lingxue’s were all dressed to the nines, everything carefully chosen. It was obvious that they all had exceptional backgrounds and that they came from prominent families.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Some were lively and generous, some were gentle and reserved, while others were valiant and noble…. In terms of both appearance and bearing, all of them were extraordinary.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">However, presumably because Wen Lingxue was simply too well-dressed and too dazzlingly beautiful, when her classmates compared themselves to her, they all felt varying degrees of barely discernible envy.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">They hid their jealousy well, but they couldn’t escape Su Yi’s keen eyes.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>He couldn’t help but find it funny.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Girls’ friendships might seem close-knit, but in truth, all of them have a hidden agenda. Fortunately, it’s all innocuous.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Nie Teng, what are you doing here?” Wen Lingxue suddenly noticed the only boy among her guests. Her brows scrunched up, and her expression became noticeably colder.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The vibrant atmosphere suddenly grew somewhat stifled.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The youth in question wore robes decorated with jade. His eyes were bright, his eyebrows dashing, and his bearing noble.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The young man smiled, then stepped forward to greet her. “Lingxue, it’s your birthday. Here’s a little something I prepared for you. Please accept it.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He held a box inlaid with gold and jade in both hands. He gingerly opened it, revealing a pale purple jade hairpin for all to see.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Someone had expertly carved it into a Luan about to take flight. It was so exquisitely detailed, it looked alive. It was obvious at a glance that this was the work of a master artisan.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“The ‘Purple Luan Fluttering its Wings’ Hairpin! It’s Master Artisan Mo’s proudest work, and he’s one of the best craftsmen in the prefecture! They say it’s made of a natural Cold Purple Spirit Jade. The materials alone are worth three hundred gold!&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“But after passing through Master Artisan Mo’s divine hands, it’s likely worth thousands!” One of the girls, whose make-up was particularly exquisite, lit up. She’d determined the hairpin’s origins at a glance.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“This…. Isn’t that a bit</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">&nbsp;too&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">precious?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">These girls all had illustrious backgrounds, but they couldn’t help but click their tongues. Nie Teng’s lavish spending left them shocked.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nie Teng was quite satisfied with this result. A faint smile spread across his face, and he asked gently, “Lingxue, do you like it? I prepared it specifically for you.”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>When they heard this, the other girls’ expressions shifted; they couldn’t help but envy Wen Lingxue.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nie Teng.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He was the son of the commander of the City Lord’s Old Guard. His talent was outstanding, his bearing handsome and noble.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He was just sixteen years old, but he was already the man of the hour at Pinecloud Sword Manor. Who knew how many girls admired him?<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A talented, handsome youth like him had just spent a thousand gold to purchase a jade hairpin as an expression of his admiration. This was an enormous honor for any girl.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Who didn’t hope for things like this to happen to them?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Yet&nbsp;</span><span>Wen</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Lingxue’s brow only furrowed even deeper, and her expression turned even frostier. “This gift is too precious for me to accept. You should keep it.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nie Teng’s smile froze, replaced by a hint of distress.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">However, before he could respond, Wen Lingxue called for everyone to take their seats. She even specifically requested that Su Yi sit beside her.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">From beginning to end, she left Nie Teng completely hanging.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">However, when they saw Nie Teng’s predicament, some of the girls couldn’t help themselves. They spoke up, one after another, and warmly invited him to sit down.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nie Teng quickly got his emotions under control and sat down with a smile, as if he’d already completely forgotten about his earlier awkwardness.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">However, whenever his gaze landed on Su Yi, he felt an inexplicable discomfort.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>To tell the truth, it wasn’t just Nie Teng. The girls were all baffled too.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Why did Wen Lingxue invite Su Yi of all people?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Out of respect for her, they tacitly agreed not to say anything. Still, none of them took the initiative to greet Su Yi, much less to exchange pleasantries.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">If not for Wen Lingxue, they would never have consented to sit at the same table as him. Who wanted to get acquainted with the live-in son-in-law everyone laughed at?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Thus, even though Su Yi was seated right there, it was as if he were invisible. They were ignoring him completely.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Brother-in-law, they might ignore you, but I won’t. Whatever you do, don’t get upset.” While the others weren’t paying attention, Wen Lingxue whispered in Su Yi’s ear.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Her breath was like the touch of an orchid, and her eyes were bright and lustrous. Her little face was fraught with concern as she tried to comfort him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi didn’t quite know what to say.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He had the mental fortitude of two lives. Why would he care about something like this?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Before long, a group of beautiful maidservants walked into the room carrying a sumptuous array of dishes. All of them were rarely seen delicacies.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue tilted her head in confusion. “I didn’t order that much food!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nie Teng seemed to perk up, and he said heartily, “Lingxue, today is your birthday. How could we let you spend money on us? Our day at the Immortal Gathering House is entirely on me.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His gaze swept across the other girls, and he put on a lofty air. “Everyone, please eat and drink to your heart’s content. Enjoying yourself is the best way to congratulate Lingxue.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The girls laughed delightedly. Although their backgrounds were exceptional, they couldn’t just dine at a money-pit like the Immortal Gathering House all willy-nilly.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue, however, was not impressed. She said coldly, “How much did this cost? I’ll reimburse you later on.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nie Teng laughed. “Lingxue, don’t be so distant. It’s just one meal. If you really pay me back, when I next return to Pinecloud Sword Manor, the other guys will curse me to death.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Quite a few of the girls laughed and chimed in their agreement, urging Wen Lingxue not to worry about it.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue hesitated, but in the end, she decided not to say anything more.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She did, however, whisper in Su Yi’s ear, “This guy is always like this. At Pinecloud Sword Manor, he loves nothing more than showing off. There’s nothing more irritating than vain guys like him!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Also, I never even invited him to the Immortal Gathering House; he showed up of his own accord. His skin sure is thick!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi laughed. Vanity was a common affliction among youths, and it wasn’t such a terrible vice.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Suddenly, Nie Teng glanced over.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He hadn’t heard what Wen Lingxue said to Su Yi. He could, however, see her pink lips in the intimate act of whispering into Su Yi’s ears!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>His smile froze, and he could no longer suppress the flames of his jealousy. He even felt the urge to get up, wallop Su Yi, and send him packing.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nie Teng forced down his envy and feigned relaxed, casual curiosity. “Su Yi, you’re Lingxue’s brother-in-law, and this is her birthday party. I wonder what present you got for her?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A faint, almost indiscernible hint of a smile tugged at Su Yi’s lips.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">What kind of person was he? He could tell at a glance that this kid resented him and was trying to cause trouble!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As expected, the others all looked over, all of them with different expressions. They could roughly guess that Nie Teng was interested in comparing gifts.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Or perhaps, he was just seizing this opportunity to embarrass Su Yi.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Now that they thought about it, what right did a live-in son-in-law have to sit at the same table as them?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He was humiliating himself and he didn’t even know it!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">This Nie Teng is really detestable!&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue was starting to get angry. She’d long since realized that Su Yi had forgotten about her birthday. How could he possibly have prepared a present?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Yet Nie Teng just&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">had</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;to bring it up!<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I almost forgot about Lingxue’s birthday, which is why I didn’t have time to prepare a present. However, I’ll make it up to her later today, after we return home.” As Su Yi spoke, he looked at Wen Lingxue.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">That was because his words were aimed at her; he didn’t care a whit what the others thought of him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Wen Lingxue was briefly dazed. She pursed her pink lips, but inwardly, there were no words to describe her delight.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">&nbsp;Brother-in-law, he…. He cares about my birthday after all! Mm, that’s right. He’s just been busy lately, so he inadvertently overlooked it, that’s all.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\"><br>As she thought this, her eyes lit up, and a smile gradually spread across her face.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“So, you didn’t bring a present….” Nie Teng had finally found an opportunity to vent his bellyful of jealousy, and he couldn’t resist poking fun. “</span><span>Lingxue’s been</span><span>&nbsp;so good to a mere live-in brother-in-law like you for nothing. Look at you! I wouldn’t have guessed you’d forget even her birthday!”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>The girls in attendance couldn’t help but shake their heads.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">You can’t rely on a wall built in the mud. This Su Yi sure is inept!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">But now that I think about it, he’s the Wen&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Family’s</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">&nbsp;live-in son-in-law, a man who lives by mooching off a woman. What kind of gift&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">could</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">&nbsp;a guy like that even give?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Whatever it is, it’s sure to pale in comparison to Senior Apprentice Brother Nie Teng’s ‘Jade Purple Luan Hairpin’!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">I really don’t get why&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Wen</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">&nbsp;Lingxue cares so much about a live-in brother-in-law like him….</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Many of the girls found it hard to understand, and in their hearts, they felt renewed disdain for Su Yi.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nie Teng saw all of this, and he finally relaxed. But just as he was considering whether or not to strike while the iron was hot and give Su Yi a few more good kicks….</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Bang!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Someone shoved open the private dining room’s tightly-shut door.</span></p><hr/><blockquote><b>Translator's Thoughts</b><p>Just FYI, the word I’m translating as “matriarch” is not the female equivalent of the word used for titles like “Patriarch Reliance.”&nbsp;</p><p>老太君 means the mother of the family head (or other male authority figure). There’s no direct English equivalent that I’m aware of. The closest matches I could think of were “matriarch” and “grande dame”.
