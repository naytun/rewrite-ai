I won’t try anything clever again!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>When Nie Beihu saw this, he couldn’t help but sigh with emotion.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">&nbsp;Huang Yunchong, you old fox! What a clever move! So long as your son follows Young Lord Su, what need is there to worry about his future? He’s sure to make something of himself!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">When I get back, I’ll have to have my son get closer to Young Lord Su too!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Then, he solemnly cupped his fist. “Young Lord Su, City Lord Fu told me days ago that your problems are his problems. So, tell me…. How should we resolve this?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Wen Jieyuan was the son of Wen Changqing, while Su Yi was the Wen&nbsp;</span><span>Family’s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;live-in son-in-law. There was now a blood feud between the two of them. If they didn’t handle this well, it could cause enormous turmoil.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Before Su Yi could respond, Wen Jieyuan struggled to turn and face him. He kowtowed, pleading at the top of his lungs, “Su Yi, I was wrong! I was wrong! I’ll never do it again, so please, spare me just this once! I swear I won’t tell anyone what happened here!”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He trembled from head to toe, his eyes wide with terror.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Even an idiot would have realized the situation wasn’t looking good, so he immediately changed his tune.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But what happened next was beyond everyone’s expectations—</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Huang Qianjun suddenly stepped forward, grabbed the knife in Wen Jieyuan’s back, and shoved it in.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Splurt!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The sharp blade pierced right through Wen Jieyuan, its sharp tip emerging from his chest with a spray of blood.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Jieyuan’s eyes widened, and his jaw dropped. He thudded limply to the ground.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The knife Su Yi had thrown wasn’t enough to deal a fatal blow, but Huang Qianjun’s attack directly severed his life.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nie Beihu and the nearby guards were stunned. They never would have guessed that the one to kill Wen Jieyuan would be the silkpants, Huang Qianjun.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Even Su Yi’s eyebrows shot up; he hadn’t expected this either.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun’s chest heaved, his breathing ragged. He pulled the knife out, splattering blood all over himself.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But it was as if he didn’t notice. He lowered his head, not daring to meet Su Yi’s gaze, then said hoarsely, “Brother Su, I did something conceited again.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi stared deeply at him, then said “Wash the blood off your face, then come back.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">For a moment, Huang Qianjun was dazed. Then he said in surprise, “Brother Su, you’re not mad at me? But just now, I…”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“No need to say more. I understand.” Su Yi waved him away.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun broke into a grin, then rushed off to clean himself up.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Huang Qianjun, that kid! He’s ruthless, brave, and he really went all out. That attack was the pinnacle of perfection!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">With this,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">he’s made</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">&nbsp;himself Su Yi’s co-conspirator and announced his loyalty through his actions. He clearly&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">won himself Young</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">&nbsp;Lord Su’s approval, too.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Nie Beihu couldn’t help but sigh to himself.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Why didn’t I realize that this domineering silkpants was so crafty and brave?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Had Su Yi dealt Wen Jieyuan the final blow, it would have inevitably led to direct conflict with the Wen Family.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">By choosing that moment to attack, Huang Qianjun had effectively redirected all the trouble onto himself.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Even if the Wen&nbsp;</span><span>Family</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;found out what had happened, they’d look to Huang Qianjun for revenge.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This was the risk and sacrifice Huang Qianjun accepted when he pushed in the knife.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But in doing so, he’d really and truly won Su Yi’s approval!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nie Beihu was ruthless and experienced. How could he possibly miss what was happening here?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">That was why he sighed with so much emotion.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He asked himself, had he been in Huang Qianjun’s shoes, could he have made the same choice? Maybe, but he would likely have hesitated. He couldn’t have been so quick or decisive.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nie Beihu clasped his fist. “Young Lord Su, this is the Apricot Clinic, and numerous people saw Wen Jieyuan enter. Today, both he and his guards lost their lives here. I’m afraid we won’t be able to keep this incident a secret.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He paused, then said decisively, “But you can rest assured that I will do everything in my power to resolve this incident!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Jieyuan’s status wasn’t simple; he was the son of the main-line elder Wen Changqing. Someone of Nie Beihu’s status would encounter numerous thorny problems if he tried to resolve this.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But he nevertheless accepted this responsibility.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His reasoning was simple: he had City Lord Fu Shan behind him, and behind Fu Shan was the Lady Spiritjade!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">WIth a clang, Su Yi sheathed his sword and said lightly, “There’s no need to go to such trouble. If Wen Changqing asks, just tell him that they fell at the hands of Wu Ruoqiu of the Deathbringer’s Gate.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This was shifting the blame.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The best part was that Wen Changqing undoubtedly already knew of Wu Ruoqiu’s existence, and at least a little about the courtyard.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">No one would doubt them if they pinned his son’s death on Wu Ruoqiu and the Deathbringer’s Gate.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“The Deathbringer’s Gate? Wu Ruoqiu?” Nie Beihu was dazed; it was obvious he’d never heard of that organization or of Wu Ruoqiu.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Something occurred to Su Yi, and he immediately explained how Wu Ruoqiu had been using the courtyard as a Ghoul Worm farm.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Brilliant!” When Nie Beihu heard this explanation, he couldn’t help but applaud.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wu Ruoqiu was undoubtedly the perfect scapegoat to pin the murders on!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi said gravely, “Commander Nie, remember to tell the city lord. Have him investigate and see if there are any similar ‘haunted houses’ in Guangling City. After all, now that Wu Ruoqiu is dead, there’s no one left to feed the worms. When they get hungry, they’re certain to charge into the city and bring disaster to the citizens.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nie Beihu instantly grew solemn. He cupped his fists. “Young Lord Su, I admire your consideration and your benevolence. We’ll be certain to make this our top priority!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">With that, he turned to his guards and said, “Clean up the corpses. I don’t care how you do it, but make absolutely certain that you don’t leave any clues that might disadvantage Young Lord Su. Do you hear me?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Yes, sir!” The guards acknowledged their orders and got to work.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">They’d worked for the City Lord’s Manor for years. They were elites accustomed to bloodshed, the type to lick the blood off their swords, and they had ample experience resolving such matters. They were ruthless and efficient.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">By the time Huang Qianjun finished washing off the blood and returned, the courtyard was spotless. Wen Jieyuan and the guards’ corpses had disappeared, as if they’d vanished into thin air.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Even the rivers of blood staining the ground were gone without a trace!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun couldn’t help but exclaim, “Commander Nie, why do I get the sense that this isn’t the first time you and the Old Guard have done this?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“It’s just killing people and destroying the corpses, that’s all,” said Nie Beihu offhandedly. “It’s as simple as could be. I’m not bragging when I say that after the Old Guard finishes cleaning a murder scene, not even the Huang Family would be able to find the slightest thread of evidence.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As he spoke, his gaze swept across his subordinates. “Everyone, you know what to do regarding today’s incident, don’t you?”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The guards burst into laughter.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">One of them said, “Sir, let’s go by our usual rules. Treat us to three rounds of drinks, and we guarantee our lips are sealed. It’ll be as if none of this ever happened!”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nie Beihu nodded.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi glanced at Huang Qianjun. “You foot the bill for their drinks.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun hurriedly pounded his chest. “Relax, Brother Su! Leave it all to me!”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nie Beihu couldn’t help but laugh.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi ordering Huang Qianjun to treat the guards was undoubtedly his way of expressing approval for this arrangement.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">That was enough!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nie Beihu thought about it, then whispered a recommendation, “Young Lord Su, I’ve already sent people to request Wen Changqing’s presence. When he gets here, all you have to do is watch.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi nodded.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Time flew by.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A full hour passed before a group rushed through the courtyard gates.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Their leader was a glaring, pale-faced, whiskerless man. This was none other than the Wen Family’s Second Elder, Wen Changqing.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">However, his frantic concern and heavy heart were written on his face. The second he stepped into the courtyard, he said in a low voice, “Commander Nie, where is my son? Where are his guards?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Nie Beihu’s expression filled with grief, and he said hoarsely, “Brother Changqing, when I got here, it was already too late. I’m afraid your son and his attendants&nbsp;</span><span>were</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;already dead.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“What!?” Wen Changqing reacted as if he’d been struck by lightning, and his eyes threatened to pop out of their sockets. “Who was it? Who killed my son?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His vicious gaze swept across everyone in the courtyard, like an infuriated beast looking for someone to devour.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He had two children. Wen Jieyuan was his eldest son, and he was in the prime of his youth. Wen Changjing had poured his heart and soul into training him.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He’d planned to send Wen Jieyuan to Blueriver Sword Manor in the near future.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Who would have thought that his son would die before he got the chance?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“My condolences, Brother Changqing.” Nie Beihu’s face filled with mourning, and he sighed. “None of us could have guessed that malevolent apparitions hid within the courtyard. That heretical Daoist, Wu Ruoqiu, was even more vicious; he summoned evil insects called ‘Ghoul Worms’ to devour your son and his guards whole….”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“Wu Ruoqiu…. Wu Ruoqiu….” Wen Changqing’s expression shifted dramatically, and the veins&nbsp;</span><span>bulged</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;on his forehead. “That blasted wandering Daoist! I thought of him as my friend, yet he dared murder my son?!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Suddenly, he glanced at Su Yi, as if realizing something.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“No, that’s not right!” he exclaimed. “That waste spent the night without being attacked, so why is my son dead?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He was both stunned and angry, and he’d sensed that something fishy was going on.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Instead of answering him, Nie Beihu looked stunned. “Brother Changqing, you’re saying you know the heretical cultivator Wu Ruoqiu? And you <em>knew</em> this residence was haunted and dangerous?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The nearby guards were in uproar. They played along, shouting and clamoring. All of them glared at Wen Changqing and shouted questions.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Wen Changqing, you dared leave that evildoer to wreak havoc?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I never would have guessed that the Wen Family would commit such dark, heretical acts behind closed doors. Simply unforgivable!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“The Wen Family has been consorting with the heretical cultivator Wu Ruoqiu of the Deathbringer’s Gate! I’ll have to inform City Lord Fu Shan of this!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">…..</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The pain of losing his son made Wen Changqing mad with anger, but when he heard the guards’ questions and rebukes, he felt a chill run down his spine, as if someone had poured cold water over his head. This helped him calm down.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He took a deep breath, his expression unsightly as he tried to explain. “Commander Nie, if I were in cahoots with Wu Ruoqiu, why would he kill my son?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“How about this?” said Nie Beihu coldly. “You and I will pay City Lord Fu Shan a visit and have him uphold justice. If you’re innocent, you’ll naturally be free to leave without charges!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changqing froze, and his chest heaved violently.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Before he could make up his mind, Nie Beihu waved to his subordinates. “Come! Escort Wen Changqing to the city lord’s manor!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When he saw this, Huang Qianjun, who’d been playing the part of a spectator, couldn’t help but gasp.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">I’ve seen my fair share of wickedness, but I’ve never seen anyone this black-hearted!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">He isn’t just making the Deathbringer’s Gate and Wu Ruoqiu take the fall for this; he’s even seizing this chance to drag Wen Changqing off.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">How wicked!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">If he makes it to the city lord’s estate, given City Lord Fu Shan’s relationship with Su Yi, Wen Changqing is doomed!</span></p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "original_title": "Chapter 40 - Black-Hearted Nie Beihu", "chapterId": 149402}
