Who knew how many wicked deeds he had to his name?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">If someone like him showed up as a “guest”, it would be no different from a Yama King of Hell appearing on their doorstep!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wu Yong had been furious mere moments ago, but now, he froze, his gaze dark and uncertain. It was as if his legs were full of lead; he dared not leave.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun smiled leisurely. “If you know what’s good for you, just sit tight and follow Brother Su’s commands. Otherwise, I don’t mind sending my people to your home to ‘greet’ your relatives.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">He’s targeting my family?&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wu Yong’s eyes went wide. He slumped like a wilted flower and slunk back to his original location.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Su Yi couldn’t help but shake his head.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">&nbsp;You refused to talk this over. It took a villain to force you to lower your head. Was all this really necessary?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He glanced at Huang Qianjun. “Take it down a notch.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun hurriedly flashed him a toadyish grin. “You’re right to chastise me, Brother Su.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When the lean middle-aged man saw this, he felt a sudden chill.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">After learning that Su Yi was to take up management of the Apricot Clinic, they’d decided to use whatever means necessary to send him packing.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Who wanted to serve a paltry, insignificant live-in son-in-law?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But they never could have anticipated that he’d bring such an infamous ‘attack dog’ with him!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">They dared offend Su Yi, but who among them dared offend the son of Family Head Huang?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Even if Huang Qianjun beat them to a pulp, it was unlikely that the Wen Family could offer much help!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Wen Family Son-in-law, we certainly have no plans to oppose you. Please, be at ease.” The gaunt middle-aged man took a deep breath and clasped his fist, his attitude far more restrained than before.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“You’ve misunderstood. I’m not desperate to keep you all here.” Su Yi shook his head, then said flatly. “Anyone who’s sold themselves to Wen Changqing and his family can leave.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Even before departing for the Apricot Clinic, he knew that it had long since been under the jurisdiction of Wen Changqing and his line.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But as of today, it was Su Yi’s territory. He naturally had to do a little housecleaning first. This would prevent him from hitting hidden snags down the line and save him a lot of trouble.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“What?” Several of their expressions changed immediately.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The gaunt middle-aged man couldn’t help but say, “Wen Family Son-in-law, this isn’t quite appropriate, is it? Even if they’d indentured themselves to the Second Elder, they still work for the Wen Family. Won’t this hurt and disappoint loyal employees?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi just sat there quietly. He said nothing.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun instantly realized it was his turn. He cleared his throat, then swept his gaze around the room. “Everyone, you’d best not make things difficult for my Brother Su!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This delinquent young master’s words carried a powerful implied threat.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Several of the employees left right away, some dejected, some indignant, some bitter….</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But all of them left without voicing a single complaint.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">They couldn’t risk it. What would they do if they offended Huang Qianjun and he really showed up on their doorstep?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Finally, only seven of the Apricot Clinic’s old hands remained.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The gaunt middle-aged man was the steward, Hu Quan. He hadn’t signed any sort of indenture agreement with the Wen Family.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">However, although he didn’t leave, he clearly carried a grudge. His expression was dark and unsightly.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Hu Quan aside, the others were all apprentice apothecaries and assistants.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“What about Doctor Wu?” Su Yi asked suddenly.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He remembered that before, a doctor by the name of Wu Guangbin worked at the Apricot Clinic. He was locally famous, and the citizens of Guangling City trusted him.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Elder Wu inadvertently caught a chill last night,” said Hu Quan perfunctorily. “He’s fallen ill, and he’s currently at home recuperating.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He paused, then continued, “Our clinic has two other physicians, but yesterday, one went home to visit relatives, while the other is visiting a friend in Cloudfall City, on the other side of the Great Azure. Neither is currently at the clinic.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun couldn’t help but laugh coldly. “You’ve got three physicians in total, but all of them are busy with other matters? Isn’t that a bit too much of a coincidence?”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Hu Quan shrugged as if it had nothing to do with him. “I don’t know about that, but no matter what, without a physician on the premises, the Apricot Clinic will need to close its doors and suspend its business…..”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Suddenly, Su Yi interjected, “Our doors remain open. We can start accepting patients right now.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Hu Quan and the others were dumbfounded.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi tapped his fingers against his desk and said, “We’re just treating the ordinary ailments of the common folk. I can do that too.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Pff!” One of the servants couldn’t help but laugh. The others wore strange expressions on their faces; it was clear they took Su Yi’s words as a joke.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun’s expression darkened, and he shouted, “What the hell are you laughing at? Hurry and call in the patients lined up outside!”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He had blind faith in Su Yi.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Then we’re looking forward to seeing the esteemed Wen Family Son-in-law’s medical attainments with our own eyes,” said Hu Quan flatly. He ordered the two servants to open the doors and allow the patients inside.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Before long, a white-haired old woman walked up to the counter. Her gaze swept around the clinic. “Where is Doctor Wu Guangbin?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“He’s not here,” said Su Yi from behind the counter. “I can treat you instead.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But the old woman merely glanced at him, shook her head, then turned to leave.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When Hu Quan and the others saw this, their expressions turned even stranger. They planned to just sit back and watch this farce play out.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi didn’t mind in the least. “Next.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A man so stalwart, he looked as if he’d forged out of iron walked in. When he learned that Wu Guangbin wasn’t on the premises, he shook his head in disappointment.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Why didn’t he say so earlier?” he spat. “You wasted my time!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">With that, he turned to leave.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Sir, you….” Hu Quan repressed his laughter and spoke up. The way he saw it, if things continued like this, Su Yi would only embarrass himself.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Next!” Su Yi said flatly, without the slightest change in expression.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Brother Su, I’ll call them in.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun was a natural-born henchman. When he saw the situation, he turned and charged out of the Apricot Clinic.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Outside, he saw that the line had shrunk; more than half of the would-be patients had left.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Let’s hurry and leave! Doctor Wu isn’t in.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“What’s the Apricot Clinic thinking? They’re letting the Wen&nbsp;</span><span>Family’s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;live-in son-in-law treat patients? They’ve gone mad!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">…..The crowd broke into discussion, and one person left after another.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">This is no good! It’s Brother Su’s first day on the job. How can he just sit around kicking his heels? As his subordinate, if I let this go on, won’t it make me look inept?</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Huang Qianjun’s expression turned ruthless. He walked down the stone steps, and his gaze swept across the patients who’d yet to leave.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Hey! Stay in line, people! If anyone dares leave without authorization, don’t blame me for my bad manners!” he said coldly.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The patients were practically all ordinary folk. The sight of a delinquent silkpants like Huang Qianjun struck terror in their hearts, and none of them dared leave.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“You! Go on in!” Huang Qianjun pointed to a thin, sallow-faced old man.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I….” The man seemed frantic, and inwardly, he cried out in duress.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Old-timer, having my Brother Su treat you is a blessing from your ancestors,” said Huang Qianjun viciously. “Don’t be ungrateful!”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The old man grimaced, then hung his head and walked inside, as if he’d lost his soul.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>When Hu Quan and the others saw this, they couldn’t help but shake their heads.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">This delinquent young master is being deliberately provocative for no good reason. Since when do you have to threaten patients to see a doctor?&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>When he walked in, the old man smiled bitterly. “Doctor Su, I’m perfectly fine. I don’t need medical care at all, so…. Might you just let me go?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi shook his head. “You’re sick.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I’m not!” The old-man straightened his back and denied it.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Yes, you are.”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I’m really not!” The old man was practically in tears.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Hu Quan almost burst into laughter.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Look at this! How absurd!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi rose, walked up to the old man, and said, “Recently, you’ve been having violent coughing fits at night. You’re fatigued, and you regularly have chills and severe pain. Am I right?”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“How did you know?” The man was stunned, too stunned to be anxious.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Hu Quan and the others looked at Su Yi in mild surprise.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Diagnosing patients came down to sight, sound, taking a medical history, and direct examination.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Even Wu Guangbin, who’d spent his whole life immersed in the art of medicine, had to at least ask a patient their symptoms and take their pulse to understand their illness.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Yet now, without doing anything at all, Su Yi had seen through the old man’s symptoms almost instantaneously!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“There’s a problem with your lungs. That combined with old age has resulted in your current symptoms.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">With the memories of his past life, treating the common maladies of ordinary folk was simple as could be.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">After a brief daze, the old man suddenly grew agitated, and his voice shook. “Then how should I treat my illness, Young Lord Su?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His gaze carried a thread of burning hope.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi returned to his desk, took out a pen and paper, and wrote a simple prescription. He passed it to the nearest servant. “Go fetch his medicine.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The servant accepted the paper, only to hesitate.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Let me see.” Hu Quan stepped forward, and after a brief inspection, he sunk into thought. A long time passed before he calmed back down.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He wasn’t a doctor, but he’d worked at the Apricot Clinic for years. He knew at a glance that this prescription was the work of an experienced physician. It was similar to how ministers, despite lacking kingdoms of their own, understood the ways of kings.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A moment later, Hu Quan passed the prescription to the servant. “Go fetch this gentleman his medicine.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Then, he turned to Su Yi, took a deep breath, and said solemnly, “Sir, I apologize for underestimating your abilities earlier and hope you can forgive me.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When the others saw this, they were stunned.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Hu Quan was the steward, and his status was high, second only to the manager.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Yet shockingly, Su Yi’s casually written prescription managed to convince him!&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi said flatly, “It’s just a prescription, not much at all. Next!”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun was still standing in the doorway, and he reacted immediately. “You! Get in here!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This time, a pale-faced man walked in, his expression wracked with agony.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Su Yi took one look at him, then took a silver needle from a nearby drawer. Before the man could even react, he’d&nbsp;</span><span>pricked</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;several acupoints all over his arm.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">An instant later, the man’s agonized expression faded, replaced with surprise and delight. “It doesn’t hurt anymore! I’ve visited more than ten clinics already, but none of them were of any use. I would never have guessed that Young Lord Su could fix the problem with just a few needle pricks!” The man waved his arm repeatedly in excitement and delight.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Despite themselves, Hu Quan and the others were impressed, and their expressions filled with shock. The way they looked at Su Yi changed dramatically.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Treating wounds with acupuncture?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Who would have thought that the family’s low-status live-in son-in-law had such a trick up his sleeves?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Acupuncture fixed the symptoms, but not the root cause. You’ll need a few doses of medicine as well.” Su Yi wrote out a prescription and passed it over.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This time, the servant was incomparably quick. He rushed straight off to fetch the designated medicines.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Next.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Next.”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Next.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">…..the following interval completely turned into Su Yi’s solo performance.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When a patient walked in, he saw through both their symptoms and the root cause of the problem at a glance, without so much as a single question. Without exception, the patients were stunned and fully convinced of his abilities.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Then, it was just a matter of writing a prescription, fetching medicine, and accepting payment…</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">From beginning to end, Su Yi was expressionless, as if he were an emotionless medical puppet.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Hu Quan and the rest of the clinic’s staff were simply dumbfounded.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In all their years of life, they’d never seen anyone treat patients like this before!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This resulted in an enormous commotion outside the Apricot Clinic too.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As one patient after another left the clinic, word spread. In the end, there was no longer any need for Huang Qianjun’s threats. The patients outside clustered together, fighting for a chance to have Su Yi treat them.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Seeing this lively, bustling crowd, Huang Qianjun couldn’t help but cluck his tongue.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Brother Su doesn’t disappoint!
