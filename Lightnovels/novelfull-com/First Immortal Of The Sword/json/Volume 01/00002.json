Her lustrous black hair flowed behind her, and her movingly beautiful eyes shone with intelligence. Her skin was as snowy-white as cream. She was a full-on beauty-in-the-making.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-uid=\"c1fa561e-dc21-4606-91df-1cb694f3775a\"><span>Her flowy blue dress was&nbsp;seemly and&nbsp;appropriate.

Some were jealous or envious, while others were dejected. There was no shortage of beauties among them, but compared to the girl in the blue dress, they were obviously lacking.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-uid=\"89921b76-015f-4b09-a22f-e00378839bee\"><span>They were like fireflies before the light of the moon; they simply couldn’t compete.</span></p><p data-uid=\"93670665-11e6-4026-aa36-ddf531f44ddb\"><span>Amidst the quiet, the girl in the blue dress’s gait was neither leisurely nor hurried. Her complexion was fair, and her features were exquisitely crafted. Her big eyes were clear, and her gaze was penetrating.</span></p><p data-uid=\"3c9a7b5b-d4b7-4caf-b8f9-0d458fe9e03b\"><span>However, her expression was frigid, like an aloof iceberg standing apart from the rest of the world, so cold that others dared not approach her.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-uid=\"18320828-de98-4649-ab10-1eb508bb5d5f\"><span>Wen Lingxue.</span></p><p data-uid=\"e22d3fab-245e-4101-8f0f-aa0fbaf46fb2\"><span>It had only been a year since she entered the Pinecloud Sword Manor, but every last instructor already saw her as a stunning genius.

She was like the pearl of the Pinecloud Sword Manor.</span></p><p data-uid=\"ded68254-c044-431c-8026-de0fa8dc3c80\"><span>But in Su Yi’s eyes, this girl who attracted attention wherever she went was Wen Lingzhao’s little sister.</span></p><p data-uid=\"36859b71-ed53-4612-b9e0-f1fd59a54f0f\"><span>As well as his… little sister-in-law.</span></p><p data-uid=\"11855e82-0060-4f0f-8d78-57611c4d589b\"><span>“She’s getting prettier and prettier.” A hint of a smile flashed across Su Yi’s face.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-uid=\"5c2043f7-cbad-46d1-8de3-2bae4d6c120d\"><span>In the year since his marriage into the Wen Family, practically everyone had disdained and made fun of him, ridiculing him in countless different ways.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-uid=\"1313cdce-6523-443c-b5df-8d4150b4d2a1\"><span>Only Wen Lingxue really treated him as her brother-in-law, and she even regularly argued on his behalf.</span></p><p data-uid=\"4342f36e-d4f7-4878-8e76-e4a4ef2498a2\"><span>“Brother-in-law, what’s the occasion?” When she saw Su Yi in the distance, Wen Lingxue’s gemstone-like eyes lit up with delight and incomparable surprise.</span></p><p data-uid=\"10c6d41a-7181-4915-8291-3d8847539b01\"><span>In an instant, her powdery lips curved into a smile straight from the heart.</span></p><p data-uid=\"0d4d1a08-1b1a-404e-a122-058459cfbd5f\"><span>It was a smile like a sudden sunbeam. Her “iceberg” demeanor melted in an instant.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-uid=\"b1674f15-a24f-4c1f-b341-e2da809bfdf8\"><span>Quite a few male students were visibly dazed, and their hearts pounded in their chests.</span></p><p data-uid=\"c6b6dddf-3139-4cff-bf5e-ecd0f6ac0c08\"><span>“So pretty….” Some people couldn’t help but mutter.</span></p><p data-uid=\"2d74600c-7b34-4291-b8e5-33974d913bf9\"><span>“She…. She actually smiled….” Others were entranced.</span></p><p data-uid=\"583f57da-dd02-45c2-be89-6ab740a092d7\"><span>Someone sighed, “You might not believe me when I say this, but this is the first time I’ve seen Pinecloud Sword Manor’s number-one beauty smile all year!”</span></p><p data-uid=\"0f80f67d-e90b-4747-b745-3baa98cd48eb\"><span>Many others chimed in their agreement. Wen Lingxue’s name contained the character for “snow”, and they thought it suited her. Despite her beautiful appearance, her temperament was icy and aloof.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-uid=\"b7b7725d-80db-4699-9299-65b4861969a2\"><span>Despite studying under the same roof, practically none of them had seen her smile before!<br></span></p><p data-uid=\"a2cfd278-3424-4092-bfa6-3b65090e2b59\"><span>One of the girl’s expressions was complicated. “Ugh.

They’d only serve as a foil to further highlight&nbsp;Wen&nbsp;Lingxue’s shocking beauty.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-uid=\"b43c1d9e-3ec3-46a7-b0db-e0bad5ec9e98\"><span>Facing these varying gazes, Wen Lingxue changed her prior unhurried gait and dashed right up to Su Yi!</span></p><p data-uid=\"d6306ff7-9451-436f-820e-83efc3c0c1c4\"><span>The young men’s pupils constricted. They seemed to have a sudden realization. “Did she… Did Wen Lingxue just smile at that useless waste?”</span></p><p data-uid=\"6963c3a3-6a97-42c9-bede-c8871ced42a1\"><span>It seemed they didn’t dare believe it. They looked at each other.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-uid=\"ee46e877-115e-424b-9c49-3e21977f6f5c\"><span>As far as they knew, although Su Yi was Wen Lingxue’s brother-in-law, he was still just a live-in son-in-law!</span></p><p data-uid=\"09719d4e-3e72-4b9f-9d2b-224bb1d5318d\"><span>With that low, awkward status, it wasn’t just the major characters of the Wen Family that looked down on him; even the servants dared make fun of him.</span></p><p data-uid=\"85f7c175-eb62-481f-b336-59b275a1e435\"><span>This was common knowledge in Guangling City, too.</span></p><p data-uid=\"57b51158-574b-448b-89e8-082ae56a7d53\"><span>Yet Wen Lingxue’s attitude towards Su Yi was incomparably affectionate, and she even let slip an uncharacteristic display of delight when she saw him.</span></p><p data-uid=\"b6ce324b-9b84-460e-94c5-cb7e2ae392da\"><span>Anyone with functional eyes could see that Wen Lingxue was happy!</span></p><p data-uid=\"a0adc5a8-5069-46e6-bb2d-ec3035cc0088\"><span>Strange!</span></p><p data-uid=\"b220b1fa-1384-4b31-adf2-b4e6b843517b\"><span>Something was strange about this!<br></span></p><p data-uid=\"5d84cebd-37ee-4b0a-928a-bd04f416325f\"><span>At first, the young men dared not believe their eyes.</span></p><p data-uid=\"37fd3fe0-6c69-4db6-8abf-23c533b9a570\"><span>When he saw her bright, beautiful smile, Su Yi smiled back. “So, is this how you act when you’re in school?”</span></p><p data-uid=\"2b599851-029f-470c-b8be-41a7ddfd7f27\"><span>This was the first time he’d come to meet Wen Lingxue after class.</span></p><p data-uid=\"0082eb83-c9c0-4730-b1c0-a47c66c3294c\"><span>It was also his first time seeing that icy, aloof demeanor of hers.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-uid=\"364cc877-1a59-440b-aa91-6c7f40256ab2\"><span>It was nothing like his impression of her. In the year following his marriage into the Wen Family, she’d been vibrant and bright, cute and playful. There was nothing remotely “icy” about her.</span></p><p data-uid=\"7f57537b-fd5b-41e9-bf34-b0a7046329f6\"><span>“If I don’t act cold here, who knows how many irritating guys will follow me around and pester me. It’s way too irritating!” Wen Lingxue pressed her lips into a smile. Her voice was crisp and sweet, like the bubbling of spring water.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-uid=\"abfe5f30-7d67-4a98-802e-bfd48555731e\"><span>Su Yi instantly understood.</span></p><p data-uid=\"3cf3e3b2-e063-4770-977f-0d042925b14e\"><span>It was true. Even by the standards of his previous life, Wen Lingxue was a first-class little beauty. Once she grew up a bit more, she was sure to be even more stunning.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-uid=\"2b7fb940-e6f4-43cb-bd78-f205b76ba537\"><span>With that level of good looks, she was destined to have no short of admirers.</span></p><p data-uid=\"82846b82-4728-4744-94bf-bdd0372cfe7b\"><span>Wen Lingxue’s gaze swept around her dazed classmates. She suddenly felt a little guilty, and she pursed her lips in vexation, muttering, “It’s all over! A moment’s joy and I ruined the cold image I spent a whole year building up! It’s all gone to waste….”</span></p><p data-uid=\"bd546fa0-64f2-41de-b9c7-a51b73eee20d\"><span>But then, she chortled and waved valiantly. “Forget it. Who cares what they think? It’s fine so long as I’m happy.”</span></p><p data-uid=\"22460064-ca92-428b-96c9-0e5dbb54c8b1\"><span>She affectionately linked arms with Su Yi, her face nothing but smiles. “Let’s go home, Brother-in-law.”</span></p><p data-uid=\"bcbf65b2-8b6f-48d5-95d6-b8b78ed0b614\"><span>“Alright.” Su Yi smiled back and nodded. Then, the two of them left together.</span></p><p data-uid=\"62744289-e81f-46ae-9888-0c52a860e41a\"><span>The gathered students watched their departure. The area around Pinecloud Sword Manor fell silent.</span></p><p data-uid=\"0ae19a17-d22f-4bb6-8c20-6493c7478ad5\"><span>“Who can explain why on earth Lingxue is so affectionate to that waste?” spat a handsome youth through gnashed teeth.</span></p><p data-uid=\"9a7aebaa-36a4-4150-8383-db6d9c1b5419\"><span>Everyone looked at each other. They didn’t understand either.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-uid=\"c28a0150-f696-4953-9ffe-30b4755e383b\"><span>“He’s a live-in son-in-law, the laughingstock of Guangling City, and a waste who lost his entire cultivation.

Feel free to skip this, as it’s not needed to understand the story, but here’s a quick cultural note for those curious…</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The concept of a live-in son-in-law doesn’t really exist in the west. If you’re curious to know more, or if you’re struggling to understand why the supporting cast are so disdainful about it, here’s a brief overview:</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">I can’t speak to modern Chinese marriages, but in ancient China, daughters traditionally married into the husband’s family, essentially leaving their family of origin behind to join his. This often meant living in his ancestral home and taking care of her new in-laws, especially if her husband was an eldest son.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">Husbands marrying into their wives families instead was not unheard of, but it was an inversion of gender roles, with all the stigma that often entails. Furthermore, since taking on a live-in son-in-law was most common of wealthy families with daughters but no sons, the perception was that such husbands were burdens or moochers, living off a woman instead of supporting their family the way a man should. Any children born under such an arrangement would take on their mother’s surname.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">In colloquial Chinese, the character used to describe such men, “赘” has taken on the additional meaning of “burden” or pointless.” That’s arguably the more common use of the character now.</span></p></blockquote>", "images": {}, "success": true, "original_title": "Chapter 2 - Live-in Son-in-Law, Su Yi", "chapterId": 148592}
