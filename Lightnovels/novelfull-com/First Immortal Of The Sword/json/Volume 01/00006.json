He surveyed the landscape and inspected the heavenly and earthly phenomena.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This was the geomancy of wind and water, “Feng shui.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Although Su Yi currently had no cultivation, he still had the experience and outlook of his past life.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Thus, as he strolled past mountains and rivers, he could discern the shifts in spiritual energy distribution. It differed everywhere you went.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He walked over ten miles along the river. Finally, he stopped in place, a hint of satisfaction in his gaze.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Before him stood an enormous stretch of mountains, the peaks closely clustered together and shrouded in mist year-round.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The Azurecloud Mountains.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">They stretched for eight hundred miles along the banks of the Great Azure.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">If I go any further, I’ll enter the Azurecloud Mountains’ ‘Mother Ghost Ridge’, the place the people of Guangling City tremble whenever they speak of….</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Su Yi stood with his hands behind his back and gazed into the distance.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Mother Ghost Ridge had been seen as a land of mysterious dangers for years.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Rumor had it that, a long time ago, it had been the site of a brutal battle. The malevolent yin energy was so dense that, apparently, vicious apparitions emerged from its forests on a regular basis.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Most of the ghost stories circulated throughout Guangling City involved Mother Ghost Ridge.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">The mountains are locked in yin energies, and the malevolent fog cannot disperse. This really is a ‘blessed land’ for producing violent ghosts.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>After a moment, Su Yi retracted his gaze and sighed to himself,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">It’s a pity that I still don’t have any cultivation. Otherwise, I could go in, look around, and grab a few vicious ghosts to help me search the mountains for spiritual medicines. Then, I wouldn’t have to go to all this trouble to find a secluded cultivation site outside city limits…</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This world really did have ghosts!&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Furthermore, Su Yi knew that ghosts were divided into categories: yin souls, haunts, specters, and phantasms.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, the “Ghost Emperor of the Western Seas” was the most mysterious ghost of all. He started out as an ordinary ghost born on an ancient battlefield, only to become a legend among ghost cultivators.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Although the spiritual energy here is still rather sparse, at my current level, it’s plenty.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;In the end, Su Yi decided to cultivate here.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>This was a mulberry grove adjacent to the Great Azure riverbed. The Azurecloud Mountains stood before him. Both the winds and waters flowed into the mountains, a place where rivers&nbsp;</span><span>converged</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">. It was, albeit barely, a “spiritual ground.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wind drifted by. The flow of spiritual energy in the air was pleasant and relaxing.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Haaah~!</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Su Li let out a long breath of turbid air. His mind and body gradually turned clear and ethereal, like a full moon against blue skies.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Then, he gradually took up his stance and began practicing the Pine and Crane Body Refining art.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">It really is different from cultivating in the Wen Family estate….&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Just a few seconds later, Su Yi noticed that within a hundred meters around him, wisp after wisp of sparse spiritual energy was flowing towards him and fusing into his body.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was as silent and nourishing as a spring breeze and gentle rain.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His blood and energy mellowed, yet they felt full and vibrant, as if they were rejoicing. He felt an abundance of vitality.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi cast aside his scattered thoughts and immersed himself in his cultivation, forgetting himself completely.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Before long, the sun was high in the sky. It was already noon.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi had cultivated for a full six hours!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fortunately, this mulberry grove was extremely remote, and due to its close proximity to Mother Ghost Ridge, people rarely visited. No one had disrupted Su Yi’s cultivation.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Pop!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Suddenly, a crisp sound emanated from Su Yi’s bones and tendons, as if he were chiseling out the barriers within his physical form. His blood and qi coursed through him like a surging river.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His body now resembled an ancient pine, towering into the heavens!<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">And his boiling, vibrant blood and qi resembled an immortal crane beating its wings, roaming about the blue skies utterly at ease. He brimmed with profound, indescribable charm.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The pine and crane, suitable in stillness and movement. Truth and illusion mutually interconnected, both form and meaning!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">At this moment, Su Yi fully grasped the essence and charm of the Pine and Crane Body Refining Technique.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This also marked his entrance into the early stage of the Blood Circulation Realm!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Blood Circulation was the first realm of the Martial Dao, the beginning of cultivation, the foundation of the Great Dao. It was subdivided into four layers: Refining Skin, Refining Muscle, Refining Sinew, and Refining Bone.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Now, one year after losing everything, Su Yi had a cultivation once more!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Clang!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A familiar sword hum reverberated through Su Yi’s sea of consciousness, revealing delight and excitement.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The Sword of the Nine Hells!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Are you happy for me too…..?” Su Yi’s expression subtly shifted.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In his past life, the Sword of the Nine Hells had accompanied him from the moment he first started cultivating. It was by his side as he fought grand battles and pursued the Dao.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But even just before his reincarnation and with the terrifying “Profound Unity Realm” cultivation that struck terror into the hearts of the Wilds, he couldn’t see through the Sword of the Nine Hells’ true nature or discern its secrets.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Its origin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Its nine seals, its divine shackles.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Its mysterious hues.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi could set aside the fame and vast wealth he’d accumulated over the course of his lifetime.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The only thing he couldn’t give up was the Sword of the Nine Hells!<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Thus, before his reincarnation, Su Yi didn’t hesitate to seal his lifetime of memories within the blade and have it reincarnate alongside him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His sword was his life; he couldn’t part from it!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Before long, Su Yi shook his head, calmed his heart, and examined his changes. “Breathing in spiritual energy as I cultivate really makes an enormous difference.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">After reawakening his memories, he’d spent three days bitterly cultivating within the Wen Family estate.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But even added together, his three full days of work paled in comparison to the six hours he’d spent cultivating by the banks of the Great Azure.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The difference was night and day!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“If I cultivate here, it’ll only take me three days to reach the pinnacle of the ‘Refining Skin’ stage.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>As soon as this thought occurred to him, Su Yi shook his head.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">If all I have to do is increase my cultivation boundary, it’ll be as easy as turning over my palm. But I reincarnated to cultivate afresh in pursuit of a dao that transcends my past life!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">With every step I take, I have to ensure that my cultivation is solid and stable. I have to strengthen my foundations.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Su Yi warned himself,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Whatever I do, I cannot be impatient.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Blood Circulation was the first realm of the Martial Dao.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>This was the most fundamental realm, as well as the most important. The foundation he established here would influence his future path and determine how far down it he could walk.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He was using the Pine and Crane Body Refining Art to ensure that, in the Four Realms of the Martial Dao, he hammered out a foundation that far surpassed his former self at the same stage!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Unfortunately, I don’t have a penny to my name. If I had enough money, I could buy some herbal medicines. Then, after a day’s cultivation, I could soak in a medicinal bath and refine the medicines’ essences. That would improve and enhance my physique even further.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Going forward, I’ll have to find an opportunity to earn a little money….</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Just as Su Yi was mulling over his future cultivation, he heard a burst of violent coughing drift in on the wind.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi turned towards Mother Ghost Ridge and saw two distant figures walking towards him, an old man in long robes, and a young woman clad in purple.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The long-robed elder’s steps were weak, and his gaunt face was pallid. As he walked, he coughed so violently, he could barely breathe.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The young woman in purple walked by his side, her radiant, egg-shaped face fraught with concern.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Her purple clothes fluttered about, and a white jade belt wrapped around her waist. She was tall and slender, with an exceptional figure.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Even more unusual, she had an uncommon, distinct air of nobility.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Both the old man and the girl are clearly long-accustomed to rank and power.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Su Yi glanced at them, then looked away.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">However, just as he was about to leave, he paused, then turned to look at the long-robed elder once more.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He instantly discovered something, and despite himself, a hint of bewilderment flashed through his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Both the elder and the girl had long since noticed Su Yi. At first, neither of them paid him any heed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But when Su Yi turned back around to re-examine the elder, the girl couldn’t help but frown. A gloomy look came over her beautiful face. “Sly and shifty. One look, and I can tell he’s no good!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Her pretty features frosted over, and she glared at Su Yi.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>He was stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">This girl’s got quite the temper!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“Zijin, don’t be rude. No matter how worried you are about my injuries, you can’t vent your anger on the innocent.” The long-robed elder’s voice was gentle and kindly. “As you conduct your affairs, subdue yourself and observe propriety. If it’s not proper, don’t say it. Only then can your spirit remain calm, and only then can you avoid the pitfalls of the heart’s&nbsp;</span><span>six thieves.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The girl he called Zijin grimaced. “Grandpa, your wounds are so severe, yet you’re still lecturing me? How could I possibly be in the mood to listen?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The elder couldn’t help but laugh. Then, he turned to Su Yi and briefly cupped his fist. “My young friend, if we offended you, I humbly request your forgiveness.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>As he spoke, he suddenly broke into another violent bout of coughing. The veins&nbsp;</span><span>bulged</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;on his forehead; it was as if he were about to hack up a lung.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Grandpa, you shouldn’t talk anymore!” Zijin’s pretty face was frantic and fraught with worry. She carefully took her grandfather’s arm and helped him up. “Once we get back to the city, I’ll find the best physician around to treat your wounds.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was then that Su Yi interjected, “With wounds like that, an ordinary physician won’t be able to save you. If you delay any longer, you’re certain to succumb to your injuries within three days.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Zijin was so mad, her eyes bulged, and she roared, “What gall! Are you cursing my grandfather to die?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The elder, however, merely grimaced. “Zijin, he’s right. My wounds are all but untreatable.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“That….” It was as if she’d been struck by lightning. Zijin sunk into despair, and her voice quivered, “Grandpa, there’s no way I’ll let anything happen to you! I’ll take you back to the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital right away!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Don’t panic,” said the long-robed elder with a smile. “The heavens determine our fate. I spent my life on the battlefield, and I’ve long since lost my fear of death.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Then, the elder’s gaze returned to Su Yi, and he asked in mild bewilderment, “My young friend, might I be so bold as to ask how you determined the severity of this old man’s injuries?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Su Yi’s impression of him was rather decent, so he didn’t hide anything. “A scarlet flush between the brows, a pallid, bloodless complexion. Yin poison has invaded your lungs. Combine that with a lingering air of death, and if I’m not mistaken, you encountered a ‘Six&nbsp;</span><span>Severings</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Yin</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Corpse’ in Mother Ghost Ridge.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The long-robed elder was visibly moved. “Good eyes!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Zu Jin couldn’t help but chime in, “Something’s not right! Grandpa, didn’t you say that in Cloudriver Prefecture, very few people know that the Azurecloud Mountains’ Mother Ghost Ridge can give rise to Six Severing Yin Corpses?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She was right; that was precisely why her grandfather was so surprised.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Never mind Guangling City; throughout all of Cloudriver Pefecture, practically no one knew this secret.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Yet the youth before them had, after one look at his injuries, seen through their source!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi said flatly, “Discerning that isn’t much. I can even say with certainty that you came here to pluck ‘Six Yin Grass’ and ‘Extreme Yang Flowers.’”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Zijin’s eyes widened, and she asked without thinking, “How could you possibly know that?”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The long-robed elder’s expression changed too. Tidal waves of astonishment rose within his heart.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A youth he’d bumped into by chance had, just by looking, determined both the nature of his wounds and the purpose of this expedition.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Wasn’t that a bit&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">too</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;terrifying!?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“How could I possibly know that?” Su Yi shook his head with a faint sneer. “Girl, don’t tell me you don’t know that anywhere capable of giving rise to Six Severing Yin Corpses is sure to grow Six Yin Grass? It’s a spiritual medicine of extreme yin and extreme chill. And you know what they say; Yin cannot exist without Yang, and Yang cannot grow without Yin. Wherever Six Yin Grass grows, Extreme Yang Flowers are sure to follow.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, this sort of thing was common knowledge!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Yet it was obvious that Zijin was too stunned to even speak.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Even the long-robed elder’s expression filled with unconcealed shock.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In their eyes, the tall, gaunt youth before them suddenly had a newfound, inscrutable air about him.&nbsp;</span></p><hr/><blockquote><b>Translator's Thoughts</b><p><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The Six Thieves is a Buddhist term.
