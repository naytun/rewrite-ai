You had to calm your heart and get down to business.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Those with strong wills could persist in perpetuity.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Those with stalwart hearts could bravely forge ahead.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">These were the two traits universally recognized as necessary for cultivation.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">No matter how monstrously, peerlessly talented you might be, if you couldn’t persist at your daily cultivation, you would never amount to much.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">After finishing his practice, Su Yi turned and headed back. When he was just beyond the city gates, he saw thick, black chains stretching all the way across the thousand-foot-wide Great Azure River.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Thick stone was laid out across them, forming a thousand-foot-long stone bridge between the two banks of the Great Azure.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This was the “Dragon’s Gate Bridge.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">And in the center of the Great Azure, there now stood an arena. It was thirty feet tall and a hundred feet across, formed entirely of black refined iron.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This was to be the stage of tonight’s Dragon’s Gate Banquet.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The arena was thus known as the Dragon’s Gate Arena. The name came from the legend of a carp jumping over the Dragon’s Gate and becoming a dragon.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">There were already countless people walking alongside the riverbank. It was packed and noisy as could be.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">There was no shortage of civilians here to watch all the excitement.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>When night fell, no matter whether you came from Guangling City or their neighbors across the river, only those with invitations were allowed onto the Dragon’s Gate Bridge. Others&nbsp;</span><span>couldn’t so much as step</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;foot on it.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Su Yi.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A group approached from not far away, Wen Shaobei at their forefront. His arms were crossed, and his eyes were narrowed as he laughed, “What about that riffraff friend of yours? Why aren’t you two together?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi’s brow shot up. It took him a second to realize that Wen Shaobei was talking about Huang Qianjun.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Screw your granny! Who do you think you’re insulting?” Suddenly, someone cursed right back at him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">They then turned and saw someone charge out of the crowd, grab Wen Shaobei by the collar, and slap him right across the face.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Whap!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>The resounding slap echoed through their eyes, and Wen Shaobei’s&nbsp;</span><span>cheek visibly</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>swelled</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">. Blood dripped from his lips, and he looked completely dazed.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Young…. Young Master Huang!?” Wen Shaobei was stunned senseless.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Just now, Huang Qianjun was nowhere to be seen! Otherwise, he wouldn’t have dared insult Su Yi right to his face.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He never would have guessed that as soon as the insults left his lips, the delinquent young master, Huang Qianjun, would charge at him!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The Wen Family youths behind Wen Shaobei looked frantic and bewildered.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“You really don’t learn, do you?” said Huang Qianjun with a hideous grin. “In that case, I’ll go right ahead and break your dog legs!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But just as he was about to act….</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“Stay your hand!” An angry snort rang out. No one knew when he’d arrived, but&nbsp;</span><span>Wen</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Jueyuan hurried over, his handsome face utterly cold.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Whap!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>But Huang Qianjun nevertheless slapped Wen Shaobei’s other cheek, making him cough up blood and giving him a nosebleed. He looked as if his face had exploded; he was bleeding, but also crying and&nbsp;</span><span>dribbling</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;snot.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“You….” Wen Jueyuan’s eyes glinted with cold light; he was clearly infuriated.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But a moment later, his body went rigid. He’d just sensed a pair of cold eyes boring into him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\"><br>When he turned to look, he saw the dignified, imposing, purple-clad head of the Huang Family, Huang Yunchong, staring expressionlessly at him!&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Jueyuan instantly cleared his head.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He took a deep breath, repressed his rage, then said coldly, “Huang Qianjun, do you remember what I said that day? If you’ve got the balls, how about we spar at tonight’s Dragon Gate Banquet?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Without even stopping to think, Huang Qianjun said, “Sure, why not?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He then tossed Wen Shaobei away and clapped gleefully. “Wen Jueyuan, I’ve been waiting for this day for a long time!”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His eyes brimmed with viciousness and the blazing will to fight.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Jueyuan was surprised to see him like this; he seemed like a stranger. Despite himself, he furrowed his brow.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Shortly after, he said coldly, “Then I’ll see you tonight. We’re leaving!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Jueyuan’s sleeves swung as he turned and left.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Shaobei and the others scampered after him, both indignant and ashamed.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Who the hell does he think he is?” Huang Qianjun spat, but when he turned to face Su Yi, he was nothing but smiles. “Brother Su, he didn’t anger you, did he?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi shook his head. “You’d best consider how you’re going to face him tonight. I’m going on ahead.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He wouldn’t have guessed that just standing there would result in such an interlude.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Before long, Su Yi disappeared through the city gates.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“So, is Young Lord Su going to participate in the banquet tonight?” Huang Yunchong approached from afar.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He’d originally planned to greet Su Yi, but when he saw that he’d already passed through the city gates, he conscientiously decided against it.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I asked him a few days ago, but the banquet isn’t enough to interest him.” Huang Qianjun shook his head.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Despite himself, Huang Yunchong was a little disappointed. He muttered, “And here we wanted to&nbsp;</span><span>arrange him</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;a seat in the VIP spectator area.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Then, his expression turned solemn. “My boy, if you encounter&nbsp;</span><span>Wen</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Jueyuan tonight, you mustn’t fight to the bitter end. When you lose the advantage, admit defeat. There’s no shame in that.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Mm,” grunted Huang Qianjun. “Father, I’m not afraid of losing.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun sighed. “To the best of my knowledge, the Li Family’s Li Moyun won’t be participating. That means that, throughout all of Guangling City, only Wen Jueyuan has high hopes of seizing first place.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“Even if you’re no match for him, there’s no need to get discouraged. With the miraculous art Su Yi taught us, your future accomplishments are sure to far surpass Wen&nbsp;</span><span>Jueyuan’s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As he said this, Huang Yunchong’s spirits soared, and he broke into a broad smile.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun nodded.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Upon returning to the Apricot Cottage, Su Yi began practicing his sword arts.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Although he’d regained the experience and memories of his past life, he wouldn’t slack off on his cultivation even a little.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Otherwise, there was no point in even talking about surpassing his past self’s accomplishments in the Dao of the Sword.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>It was only after&nbsp;</span><span>night set in that</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Su Yi left the courtyard.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">On the way, he bumped into Steward Hu Quan. “Sir, do you plan to go to the banquet too?”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“That’s right.” Su Yi nodded.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“That works out perfectly! We can go together. I’ve already rented a boat. In a bit, I’ll arrange for drinks and side dishes. We can float on the surface of the lake, admire the lamp-lit fishing boats, and watch the competition. It’ll be too sublime for words!” said Hu Quan with a hearty laugh.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi was stunned. “You rented a boat?”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Hu Quan explained, “Without an invitation, you cannot step&nbsp;</span><span>onto</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;the Dragon’s Gate Bridge. If you want to spectate anyway, you naturally need to board one of the numerous boats gathered here and watch from a distance.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi then pulled a gold-embossed invitation from his sleeve. “Is this one of the invitations you’re talking about?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Hu Quan’s eyes instantly lit up with surprise. “That’s a VIP invitation, the most prestigious kind! With that, you can enter the VIP seating area and sit alongside the city lord!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Oh,” said Su Yi. He put it away, then asked, “If I have this, can I bring others with me?”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Of course you can,” said Hu Quan without hesitation.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Then come with me.” With that, Su Yi headed toward the bridge.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Hu Quan was briefly stunned. When he came to his senses, he hurried after Su Yi, his heart bursting with delight. He never would have guessed that tonight, he’d have the opportunity to step onto the Dragon’s Gate Bridge!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Meanwhile, in a restaurant not far from the Apricot Clinic.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A valiant-looking man whispered, “Young Master, that Su Yi has already left the Apricot Clinic. Based on the direction he headed in, it seems he’s going to watch the Dragon’s Gate Banquet.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Even most of the Li Family thought Li Moyun had begun his journey back to the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital days ago, and that he didn’t plan to participate in the Dragon’s Gate Banquet.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In truth, he’d remained in Guangling City this entire time, secretly preparing to wipe Su Yi out.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The way Li Moyun saw it, killing Su Yi would be as easy as turning over his hand. That part wasn’t even worthy of consideration.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">What concerned him was how to kill Su Yi without leaving behind any evidence.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">And tonight, while practically everyone of note was at the Dragon’s Gate Banquet, was undoubtedly an ideal chance to take Su Yi out.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Not even gods or ghosts would know what had happened!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Then we’ll just wait for him to get back,” said Li Moyun indifferently. “Have someone hide behind the Apricot Clinic and await my orders.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Yes, sir!” The subordinate scampered off to obey.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“</span><span>Lingzhao, once I dispose of that waste, Su Yi, I’ll go looking for you at Heaven’s Origin Academy. Then, you’ll no longer need to fret over this unfortunate sham of a marriage….”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Li Moyun drained a cup of wine as he muttered to himself.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">……</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Outside the city.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Darkness fell, like ink gradually spreading across the dome of heaven.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The grand and imposing Great Azure was covered in densely-packed boats, clustering around the Dragon’s Gate Bridge.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Every boat was well-lit with lanterns and covered in people.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Looking from a distance, hundreds of barges clustered together, and a thousand sails billowed in the wind. Countless lanterns cast their lights against the river’s surface, like a galaxy descending onto the mortal world, and brilliant and colorful as a painting.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The lamplight flickered in the breeze, illuminating the water’s surface. Lights intersected, like countless stars flickering on and off, radiant against the darkness.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When he saw this, even Su Yi, who’d only just stepped through the city gates, was struck by its beauty. “Even the grandest spectacles of heaven cannot surpass the beauty of the human world’s lights. This really is worth a look.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Hu Quan was already overcome with astonishment. “I’ve seen this spectacle several times already, but every time, it shakes me to the core. This is the annual Dragon’s Gate Banquet, the grandest occasion in Guangling City, something worth looking forward to all year!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was indeed quite lively.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Practically all of the citizens had come, families in tow. They clustered along the riverbank, the festivities crowded and lively as could be.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">They were just here to see the lanterns and the scenery.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">After all, they were too far from the Dragon’s Gate Competition to see anything.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Those with the money and authority had long-since hired boats so they could watch from the surface of the lake. They’d drink as they commented on the matches; it was sure to be a delight!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The fierce elites of the city lords’ guards kept watch on both ends of the bridge.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Only those with invitations were allowed to step foot onto the bridge and enter the banquet’s main venue.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>When Su Yi arrived, he was just about to show off his invitation when a guard walked right up to him with a warm, welcoming smile. “Young Lord Su, the city&nbsp;</span><span>lord gave</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;us special orders in advance: tonight, you’re a first-class VIP guest. Please, come this way!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Hu Quan watched from the sides, and despite himself, he was stunned.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Since when did the son-in-law of the Wen Family have such a transcendent position? Even the city lord values him so highly?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">He doesn’t even need an invitation to attend the banquet!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Thank you.” Su Yi nodded, but he wasn’t surprised.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Suddenly, a surprised voice rang out. “Senior Apprentice Brother Su, don’t tell me you want to participate in the banquet too?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi turned and saw Nan Ying standing nearby, surprise written on her pretty face. It seemed she hadn’t expected to see him here.</span></p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "original_title": "Chapter 49 - The Night of the Banquet, Lanterns Like a Painting", "chapterId": 149417}
