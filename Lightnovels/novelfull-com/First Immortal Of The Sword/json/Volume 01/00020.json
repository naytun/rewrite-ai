The master of the house has prepared them for Su Yi and his wife. Kindly accept them on their behalf.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nine-Leafed King Ginseng!&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The group gathered in the hall could no longer remain calm.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Many of these prominent figures’ hearts shook, and their expressions changed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This was a true “spiritual medicine”, a precious treasure of shocking value. Moreover, it wasn’t purchasable at any ordinary market!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A lavish gift! An absolutely lavish gift!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Who would have guessed that the esteemed head of the Huang Family, in addition to offering birthday greetings, would personally prepare such an enormous present for the least prestigious of the Wen Family’s three main-line elders and his family?&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Even&nbsp;</span><span>Wen</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Changjing and Wen Changqing were stunned and uncertain; they couldn’t tell what Huang Yunchong was thinking.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Qin Qing and Wen Changtai could no longer remain seated, and they hurriedly rose to their feet, shocked and flattered.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Thank…. Thank you…!” Wen Changtai hurriedly clasped his fist, and when he spoke, it was with a bit of a stutter. He’d always been a simple, honest sort. When had he ever experienced anything like this?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Yunchong smiled. “You’ve got yourself a good daughter, and a good son-in-law, too!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He particularly emphasized the word “son-in-law”, his tone carrying a subtle hint of emotion.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changtai felt immensely gratified, and he broke into a huge smile. For the head of the Huang Family to praise them so highly was an honor.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“You’re saying that this pair of Nine-Leafed King Ginseng is for Lingzhao?” Qin Qing was still hesitant, as if she dared not believe what was happening. She couldn’t help but ask for confirmation.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Huang Yunchong glanced at the elderly attendant, who hurriedly explained, “Madam, this gift is for your daughter&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">and&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">for your son-in-law.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Qin Qing instantly smiled. Whether the gift was for her daughter or for her son-in-law, it was all the same to her!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">What pleased her most was that, before, Wen Changtai’s table had been desolate, and practically no one had even bothered to greet them. Yet now, Huang Yunchong had shown up, and he didn’t just greet them; he even gave them a generous present! In doing so, he’d made them the center of attention.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This feeling was unquestionably blissful!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Lingzhao, that girl, is really coming along nicely! She didn’t even come back for the banquet, but she’s still made her old mom look good!&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Qin Qing thought to herself in satisfaction.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Yunchong said no more. He’d already made himself clear enough. Whether Wen Changtai and his wife understood or not was their problem.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Just knowing that he’d given this present, which was primarily intended for Su Yi as an “apology gift”, put Huang Yunchong at ease.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Su Yi might not care about a paltry gift like that, but he’s sure to sense that our Huang Family is effectively lowering its head and offering a sincere apology. That ought to be enough,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Yunchong thought to himself.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Brother Huang, please, take a seat.” Wen Changjing smiled and walked over to invite Huang Yunchong over once more.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This time, Huang Yunchong didn’t refuse. However, before taking his seat, he turned to Huang Qianjun and said, “You go sit outside.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun was stunned for a moment, but then he seemed to understand. He immediately turned and left the clan hall.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He didn’t even look at the other tables. Instead, he steeled himself and walked straight over to Su Yi’s table. In a low voice, he said sheepishly, “Brother Su….”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi glanced at the formerly arrogant hoodlum. Huang Qianjun now looked meek and submissive.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Today, you’re here as a guest,” said Su Yi casually. “I, however, am not the host. Sit wherever you please.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun reacted as if an enormous weight had been lifted from his shoulders, and he immediately but cautiously took a seat.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Wen Lingxue’s brows knit faintly, and she seemed a bit confused.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Huang Qianjun seems somewhat different today, as if he’s guilty about what he’s done. He looks downright honest and obedient.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Is this still that same arrogant, vicious silkpants?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Those nearby felt dizzy. They looked at each other, unsure of what was going on. Even Wen Shaobei and his companions could tell that something wasn’t quite right, and their expressions were full of confusion.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi, the disregarded live-in son-in-law, was drinking with great relish. Meanwhile, Huang Qianjun, the silkpants famous throughout the city, was sitting there, mild and reserved.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This scene was jarringly out of place.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">However, no one would offer any explanations.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi wouldn’t say anything, and Huang Qianjun naturally wouldn’t take the initiative to broadcast his own humiliation.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">All of a sudden, the surrounding atmosphere turned rather strange.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Shortly after, yet another voice rang out from the distance, “Li Tianhan, head of the Li Family, is here to offer his congratulations!”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The entire venue burst into uproar, and many of the guests could no longer remain seated.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The Li Family was the most powerful in Guangling City, and the current family head, Li Tianhan, had a vast and powerful network in addition to being capable in his own right. He had connections with many major clans throughout Cloudriver Prefecture.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">And everyone in Guangling City knew that the Li and Wen Families were on poor terms!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Especially recently. Once the Wen Family declined, the Li Family started watching them hungrily, and they made numerous attempts to annex the various businesses under the Wen Family’s control.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was fair to say that the two families’ relationship was as tense as it could get, and while their grudge wasn’t necessarily irreconcilable, they already saw each other as enemies.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Yet now, Family Head Li Tianhan had appeared to wish the Wen Family dowager a happy birthday?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Was he really here to congratulate her?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Or did he have other plans?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As the crowd questioned his intentions, a gaunt, straight-backed man in long, navy blue robes walked over from afar.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>His cold eyes flashed like lightning, and his stride was as powerful as a dragon or&nbsp;</span><span>tiger’s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">. His every movement gave off a formless, imposing pressure. As he passed, no one dared speak. All the guests were as silent as cicadas in winter.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This was Li Tianhan! He was a famous, valiant figure within Guangling City.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A handsome youth in luxurious robes, a scabbard at his waist, followed him. His features bore a distinct resemblance to Li Tianhan’s.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Li Moyun!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>He was Li&nbsp;</span><span>Tianhan’s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;eldest son, as well as an inner sect disciple of Blueriver Sword Manor’s East Court. He was a prominent figure among Guangling City’s younger generation.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“When did he get back?” Wen Shaobei and the other youths’ expressions changed dramatically.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>To the youths of Guangling City, Li&nbsp;</span><span>Moyun</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;was like a tall mountain. The pressure he put on them left them unable to even lift their heads. He was simply in a league of his own.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Although Wen Changjing’s son, Wen Jueyuan, was outstanding too, his reputation was somewhat inferior by comparison.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Brother Li, you honor us with your presence. Forgive us for not welcoming you at the gate.” Wen Changjing was startled into action, and he went up to welcome their new guest. However, his expression was visibly cold and distant, without any of the warmth he used to greet Huang Yunchong.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Today is the dowager’s birthday, and the Wen Family is surrounded by such distinguished guests. How could I miss such an event?” said Li Tianhan flatly. “Oh, I see. I came uninvited, but I trust Brother Wen won’t take offense?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changjing replied expressionlessly, “I wouldn’t dare. You’re here, and that makes you our guest. Please, join us in the clan hall.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Li Tianhan nodded, but before he went any further, Li Moyun suddenly spoke up. “Father, please wait a moment.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Then, as the crowd watched, he walked right up to one of the tables, stopping next to Su Yi. “Junior Apprentice Brother Su, long time no see.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He had an air of playful superiority as he gazed down at Su Yi.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Do you have business with me?” Su Yi asked casually. He couldn’t be bothered to stand up.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">During his time at Blueriver Sword Manor, he’d been the Sword Chief of the outer sect, while Li Moyun was already a disciple of the inner sect’s East Court. He was superior to Su Yi in every way, from his backing and position to his cultivation.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">However, they hadn’t interacted much at all during their time at Blueriver Sword Manor.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Li Moyun stared intently at Su Yi for a moment, then said seriously, “I just wanted to tell you something: someone like you is in no way worthy of Lingzhao!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">With that, he turned and took up his position at his father’s side. Then, father and son strode into the clan hall.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">From beginning to end, he didn’t spare Su Yi so much as a second glance. In doing so, he inadvertently revealed the full extent of his cold indifference, pride, and disdain.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The expressions of the nearby guests grew strange.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Today, Su Yi had drawn far too much attention!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">First, it was Huang Yunchong. Upon arrival, the head of the Huang Family immediately took the initiative to greet Su Yi.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Then, there was Li Moyun, a leading figure of his generation. He’d gone up to Su Yi, unprovoked. Then, without any reservations whatsoever, he told him he was unworthy of Wen Lingzhao!&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Either incident on its own was more than enough to draw attention.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Of course, whether this limelight was a good thing or not was up for debate. Either way, Su Yi didn’t care in the least.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He hadn’t planned to participate in tonight’s banquet at all. If not for his desire to meet with the Wen Family dowager and ask about what happened last year, he would have left a long time ago.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“How detestable that guy is!” Wen Lingxue scowled.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“He’s most likely here for the same reason as Wei Zhengyang,” said Su Yi indifferently. “He’s got his sights set on your sister.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“Brother… Brother Su, your foresight is as keen as a prophet’s!” Huang Qianjun, who’d been sitting there meekly all this time, added tentatively, “To the best of my knowledge, Li&nbsp;</span><span>Moyun</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;has been infatuated with Miss Lingzhao for years, and he’s stated on more than one occasion that he’d marry her or no one at all….”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As he spoke, he snuck a furtive glance at Su Yi’s expression. When he saw that Su Yi wasn’t angry, he continued with renewed courage. “But how could he possibly compare to you, Brother Su? For what he said just now, he deserves a hard slap right in the face!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi smiled faintly. “Are you trying to encourage me to go deal with him?”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun froze from head to toe, then broke out in cold sweats. He hurriedly waved his hands. “Please, Brother Su, don’t misunderstand. His insults were over the line, and it made me angry, that’s all!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">After witnessing Su Yi’s methods in the Immortal Gathering House yesterday, he felt both awe and terror before Su Yi. He was like a mouse who’d seen a cat—no, he was even worse off. He naturally wouldn’t dare try any funny business!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi said nothing, but inwardly, he felt rather strange.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Both Wei Zhengyang and Li Moyun harbored one-sided interest in Wen Lingzhao. This only highlighted just how extraordinarily charming she was.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But at the same time, Su Yi caught a whiff of latent danger. What if one of the two of them made him wear a “green hat”? How could he bear such a thing?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He and Wen Lingzhao might be husband and wife in name only, but it still counted!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi had reincarnated to cultivate anew. He certainly didn’t wish to bear the title “cuckold” in his new life.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">I’ll have to find a chance to break things off with Wen Lingzhao completely. That way, I won’t have to worry about that sort of thing happening….&nbsp;</span><span>Su Yi thought to himself.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">But first, I’ll have to disabuse Wei Zhengyang and Li Moyun of their ideas. If nothing else works, I can always just kill them and be done with it!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Meanwhile, within the clan hall.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">After presenting his birthday gift, Li Tianhan’s gaze swept around his surroundings before finally landing on Wen Changjing. “In addition to offering my congratulations, I have two other reasons for coming here today.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When they heard this, every VIP’s expression seemed to say “I knew it!” They’d long since guessed that Li Tianhan had some other purpose for coming here.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changjing instantly went on guard, and his eyes narrowed. “Brother Li, whatever it is, can’t it wait until after the banquet? Besides, more distinguished guests will be arriving soon, and I’m afraid I have no time to discuss such matters.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Li Tianhan immediately let out a carefree laugh. “Distinguished guests? In the Wen Family’s current state? Brother Wen, don’t tell me you still think the city lord is going to pay a visit in person? To the best of my knowledge, Wen Changqing has made numerous visits to his manor over the past few days, only to be refused at the door!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His words revealed faint traces of disdain and mockery.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The great hall’s atmosphere instantly came to complete standstill. The tension was palpable.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">By now, even the dullest among them could tell that Li Tianhan had come with ill intentions!</span></p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "original_title": "Chapter 20 - An Ill-Intentioned Guest", "chapterId": 148724}
