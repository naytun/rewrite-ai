I hope you won’t take offense.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This time, he addressed Su Yi as “Master”, just like Xiao Tianque and Zijin.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This was a show of respect, as well as an indication that Fu Shan no longer saw Su Yi as a mere youth.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi said thoughtfully, “City Lord Fu, have you encountered a problem you can’t resolve on your own?”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I knew I couldn’t hide it from you.” Fu Shan sighed, a hint of worry on his brow. “I’m here with a presumptuous request, and I hope you can assist me.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Let’s hear it.” Su Yi nodded.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fu Shan paused to organize his thoughts, then said, “The Dragon’s Gate Banquet starts in three days. At first, everything was well under control, but yesterday, I received a letter from the Cloudfall City Lord, Li Jianyu.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“In it, he suggested that we use this year’s Dragon’s Gate Banquet to settle our dispute over Spiritbamboo Island’s ownership.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“If a youth of Guangling City takes the martial arts championship, the island will enter our jurisdiction. The city lord’s estate will take control of it for a period of ten years.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“But if the championship goes to Cloudfall City, the island will fall under their domain.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi was starting to understand. “Is there something special about this Spiritbamboo Island?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Indeed there is.” Fu Shan explained, “The island is thirty miles away from Guangling City along the Great Azure. It's an island in the middle of the river.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“It’s only about three hundred feet across, but it’s a blessed land of concentrated spiritual energy. It includes a thirty-foot bamboo grove. The bamboo is a special variety called ‘Bluejade Spirit Bamboo.’</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“The bamboo is like lustrous jade, bright and flourishing. Every inch of it is a treasure. The roots, shoots, and leaves are all like spiritual medicines, brimming with ample wood element spiritual energy.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“</span><span>And the mature</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;bamboo is a precious spiritual material. If you use it to make weapons, the results are extraordinary, like divine artifacts.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In the past, Guangling City and Cloudfall City took turns controlling Spiritbamboo Island. The island would change hands every three years.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“But ever since Li Jianyu became the Cloudfall City Lord two years ago, he’s seemed intent on ripping up our former agreement. He no longer acknowledges our earlier rules, and he intends to bring Spiritbamboo Island entirely under his control.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Over the past two years, we’ve clashed over Spiritbamboo Island on numerous occasions, and our conflict has only worsened over time. If we don’t resolve it soon, I’m afraid a violent struggle is sure to follow.” When he said this, Fu Shan laughed bitterly.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi said, “It sounds like he’s suggesting resolving this matter at the Dragon’s Gate Banquet. Isn’t that exactly what you wanted?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fu Shan sighed. “Had I known about his suggestion earlier, I would have been happy to agree to his terms, but he only informed me last night. That makes this difficult.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Why is that?” Su Yi’s eyebrows shot up.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“All young martial artists aged eighteen and under are eligible to participate in the Dragon’s Gate Banquet. Had I known about this earlier, I would have prepared and arranged for some capable young talents to participate.” Fu Shan patiently explained, “But time is short; I don’t have time to make such arrangements. By comparison,&nbsp;</span><span>that Li</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Jianyu suggested this implies that he’s long since prepared for it and is fully confident.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Su Yi nodded. “</span><span>That Li</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Jianyu is quite crafty.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fu Shan said coldly, “That old fox is ruthless and crafty. He’s never fought any battle he isn’t certain he can win, and this time is no exception. I’ve already investigated, and it seems he’s long since arranged for a young genius called ‘Mo Tianling’ to take part in the competition.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Mo Tianling hails from Cloudfall City’s Mo Family. He’s eighteen, and he’s at the peak of the Blood Circulation Realm. He spent two years cultivating at Blueriver Sword Manor.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Afterward, he left Cloudriver Prefecture and joined the Cloudlight Marquis’ Redscale Army. He’s spent over a year engaged in slaughter on the battlefield, and he’s grown long accustomed to life-and-death battles. He’s accumulated numerous merits, too.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“A ruthless, experienced fighter like him isn’t someone our academy students, kids who’ve never seen bloodshed, can handle.” Fu Shan sounded fraught with concern, and his brow was tightly knit.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“So it’s him!” The name felt a little familiar, and Su Yi quickly recalled where he’d heard it.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">During his three years cultivating in Blueriver Sword Manor, Mo Tianling was already an inner sect disciple.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>He was cold and harsh, his temper violent and unpredictable. He’d once brutally severed a&nbsp;</span><span>sectmate’s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;right arm in a duel, angering the sect’s higher-ups. In the end, they kicked him out.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi wouldn’t have guessed he’d hear his name again now, years later.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Master Su, I know that it’s unreasonable to ask someone of your status to participate in such a contest, but I really don’t know what else to do,” said Fu Shan. Su Yi’s silence was starting to make him nervous, and his heart pounded in his chest. “It’s fine if you choose to abstain; I can try and think of an alternative solution.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">At first, he hadn’t even considered asking Su Yi for help.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was only after Nie Beihu reminded him that he suddenly recalled that Master Su, whose brilliance even Lady Spiritjade respected, was only seventeen years old!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">At his age, he was naturally qualified to participate in the Dragon’s Gate Banquet.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Thus, after hesitating for quite some time, Fu Shan made up his mind, thickened his skin, and requested Su Yi’s aid.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Of course, he didn’t expect someone of Su Yi’s status to agree lightly. He was here because he thought it couldn’t hurt to ask.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi suddenly asked, “I heard that Blueriver Sword Manor’s Zhou Huaiqiu and Ni Hao are here. Why not ask Ni Hao to participate?”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Fu Shan grimaced and shook his head. “First, there’s no connection between me and Zhou Huaiqiu. Second, he and Ni Hao have been staying with the Li Family. As you know, last time at the Wen Family matriarch’s birthday, my attitude left Li Tianhan deeply displeased,&nbsp;</span><span>so….</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi nodded. “I understand. How about this? When the Dragon’s Gate Banquet starts, I’ll head on over.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">No matter what else he might say, Fu Shan had done him a huge favor back at the Immortal Gathering House. Sure, it had been on another’s orders, but Su Yi couldn’t be ungrateful.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Now that Fu Shan had come to him for aid, he naturally wouldn’t just sit back and ignore him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His opponent might be unworthy of consideration, but the lantern-lit river was a sight to behold.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fu Shan was overcome with delight. He clasped his fist and said, “Master Su, with you there, the outcome is secure. I am no longer the least bit worried!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He then quickly bade Su Yi farewell and left.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi, meanwhile, turned and entered his room, took off his clothes, and sank into the medicinal bath he’d prepared in his wooden bathtub.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He’d agreed to participate in the Dragon’s Gate Banquet, but he was still more concerned about his personal cultivation.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Over the past few days, Huang Qianjun had brought him a bone broth prepared with boiled medicinal herbs every morning.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Add that to his supply of fifty spirit stones, and Su Yi’s cultivation was proceeding at a shocking pace.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Just the night before, he’d reached the very pinnacle of the Refining Sinew stage. His tendons and ligaments were like a young dragon’s, soft and flexible, yet bursting with explosive power.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">If he met the Opening Acupoints stage Wu Ruoqiu now, he could kill him effortlessly.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">As expected, now that I’ve begun ‘Refining Bone’, ordinary medicinal herbs have become essentially useless…..&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Before long, Su Yi furrowed his brow and rose from his bath. His body looked lean, but beneath his clear white skin, his muscles were like carved jade.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His physique wasn’t exactly “bulky”, but every inch of his skin, flesh, blood, and sinew contained enough power to leave an ordinary martial artist in the dust.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>He wiped himself off, got dressed, and sat on his bed in the lotus position, a spirit stone in each hand.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Refining Bone was the final stage of the Blood Circulation Realm.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This stage was far harder to cultivate to perfection than Refining Sinew. The core problem was that tempering one’s skeleton until the “marrow like frost” level was too difficult!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The vast majority of the Great Zhou’s martial artists remained stuck in this stage for their entire lives, unable to achieve higher breakthroughs.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Guangling City.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Here, Blood Circulation Realm cultivators were as numerous as the hairs on an ox, but there were only a handful of Qi Accumulation Realm experts.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This was because it was too difficult to complete “Refining Bone.” It was like an enormous, impassable gorge that prevented many from breaking through to higher realms.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But to Su Yi, the challenge wasn’t the process of Refining Bone, but rather, acquiring sufficient cultivation resources to do so.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Before this, he could still use ordinary medicinal herbs to support his cultivation, but by now, ordinary medicines were no longer of any use.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He needed spiritual medicines, spirit stones, or to cultivate in places with dense spiritual energy!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But all three were unquestionably rare within the Great Zhou’s borders.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">I still have more than thirty first-tier spirit stones. Without any spiritual medicines as supplements, I’ll burn through five spirit stones a day…. I can’t let things go on like this. I should consider leaving Guangling City,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Su Yi thought as he cultivated.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The Great Zhou’s territory was vast, encompassing six provinces and thirty six prefectures.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Each province encompassed six prefectures, and each prefecture had numerous cities.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Like Cloudriver Prefecture. It was just one of the Imperatorial Province’s six prefectures. It alone included nineteen cities.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Guangling City was just one of them.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Within the vast territories of the Great Zhou, Guangling City was just a remote little city at best.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Years ago, Su Yi had chosen the Cloudriver Prefecture’s Blueriver Sword Manor specifically because he liked how remote it was; it was extremely far from the Jade Capital’s Su Family.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In doing so, he hoped to escape the Jade Capital’s Su Family’s influence.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But against all expectations, the very day he lost his cultivation, the Su Family’s power located him almost right away!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As such, shortly after Su Yi reawakened his memories, he made a decision—</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He’d wait until his cultivation reached the peak of the Blood Circulation Realm to leave Guangling City.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">That way, he’d have enough strength to fight back should he encounter any trouble.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>But things&nbsp;</span><span>were</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;different now.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Guangling City was ultimately too remote to have much in the way of cultivation resources. It was sparse and barren as could be.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">If he wanted to continue cultivating, he had to consider finding somewhere with more abundant resources.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Like the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">An old saying went, “Even the cleverest housewife can’t cook without ingredients.” Su Yi couldn’t work without resources, either.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">I don’t have to rush to leave, and no matter what, I have to visit the Azurecloud Mountains before I go.</span><span>&nbsp;Su Yi certainly hadn’t forgotten about the&nbsp;</span><span>Six-Severings</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Yin</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Corpse in Mother Ghost Ridge, nor about the Six Yin Grass or Extreme Yang Flowers.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was highly likely that an inauspicious yin spirit vein was hidden there!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Oh! Rumor has it that Mother Ghost Ridge has a long history of giving rise to various apparitions. When I visit, I should take Qing Wan with me.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Su Yi recalled the lady ghost in the Soul-Nurturing Gourd, and his eyebrows shot up.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The girl’s spiritual affinity wasn’t the least bit shallow!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Neither the inauspicious yin spirit vein nor the Six Yin Grasses were useful to him at his current cultivation.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But to a low-class yin soul like her, they were enormously beneficial!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Three days later.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Countless spectators would watch the curtains open on the Dragon’s Gate Banquet this very night.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi stepped into the morning light and proceeded to the riverside mulberry grove as always.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">To him, this was almost no different from any other day.&nbsp;</span></p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "original_title": "Chapter 48 - Fu Shan’s Request", "chapterId": 149416}
