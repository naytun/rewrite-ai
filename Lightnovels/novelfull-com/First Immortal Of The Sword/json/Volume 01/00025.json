She wore a simple, elegant dress, and beneath the light of the stars, her petite figure looked vibrant, pure, and utterly beautiful.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi was stunned. “What is it?” he asked gently.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue suddenly looked ashamed of herself. “Brother-in-law, seven days ago, me, my parents, and my uncles all saw Big Sister off. I wanted to notify you, but Mom wouldn’t let me….” She trailed off and hung her head guiltily.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi suddenly understood what had happened.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Seven days ago, Wen Lingzhao had begun her journey to Heaven’s Origin Academy. The entire Wen Family had been there to see her off, but they’d “overlooked” him, her husband, the live-in son-in-law.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This didn’t surprise Su Yi at all.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He and Wen Lingzhao were barely even strangers to each other.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">They’d met for the first time on their wedding day.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A year passed before they met for the second time, the night she returned home.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">They were husband and wife, but they hadn’t exchanged so much as a single sentence.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">No, they hadn’t said so much as a single word to each other.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>What&nbsp;</span><span>did surprise</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Su Yi was that Wen Lingxue carried such guilt over this.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Her willowy eyebrows knit together. “Also, I heard how hateful that Wei Zhengyang is, and that he made some absurd, over-the-line comments. Brother-in-law, whatever you do, don’t lower yourself by arguing with the likes of him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I know my sister better than anyone. She’s a bit cold, but there’s no way she’d cross any lines.” She sounded concerned, and her tone was comforting.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi looked right at the girl’s fair face and beautiful features. For a moment, he was stunned. Then, he sighed with emotion. “Who knows how many Bodhisattvas I’ve seen in my life? Yet hardly any have been as kind-hearted as you.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">For the first time in many years, he felt warm inside.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In his past life, he’d sought the Dao with single minded determination. He killed decisively, reaching the pinnacle of the Wilds’ Nine Provinces by climbing over a mountain of corpses and wading through a sea of blood.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Even his nine inheriting disciples both respected and feared him.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Yet in this life, he was the son of a concubine, born into the Su Family of the Great Zhou’s Jade Capital. He’d been neglected from a young age, and he’d developed a withdrawn, gloomy disposition.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Even during the three years he spent cultivating at Blueriver Sword Manor, his personality was too dark and too solitary to make many friends.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">At the time, losing his cultivation and marrying into the Wen Family was no different from falling into the abyss; the shock was too much for him to overcome. He lived like a walking corpse, as if his heart had died.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His circumstances were already so dire, but on top of that, the entire Wen Family looked down on him. Only Wen Lingxue treated him with sincere kindness.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She’d once taken great pains to plant sunflowers in his courtyard in hopes that when he saw their vibrant yellow petals in bloom, it would boost his spirits.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She’d once stuck attentively to his side, gently whispering the grand truths she’d read in books, all in an attempt to comfort him, encourage him, and help him overcome his anguish.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She knew he practically never went outside, so she’d taken it upon herself to prepare all kinds of delicacies and deliver them to his door.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">…..but then, the man he’d been before regaining his memories had never paid her concern any heed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was different now. After remembering his past life, he recalled everything Wen Lingxue had done for him over the past year. Of course he was moved! How could he not be?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She wasn’t just bright and beautiful; she had a pure and kind heart too!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Brother-in-law, you…. Really aren’t angry?” Wen Lingxue looked up, and her clear gaze bore into him. She sounded a bit uncertain.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“You! You’ve overthought this! It’s completely understandable that your sister would resent and oppose our wedding arrangement. As for everyone else, well, if I cared about their opinions, I would have died of anger a long time ago,” Su Yi said with a smile.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue finally let out a long pent-up breath. She smiled, her eyes narrowing like crescent moons as she laughed approvingly. “Brother-in-law, you’re so big-hearted!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Big-hearted?&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi’s expression went a little strange. Back in the Nine Provinces of the Wilds, everyone knew Su Xuanjun was unwilling to suffer the slightest loss and that he was quick to avenge even the tiniest of grudges.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But this little sister-in-law of his really was lovable!<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He couldn’t help but ask, “Lingxue, there’s something I’ve always wanted to ask you. After marrying into the family, everyone has looked down on me—everyone except for you. Tell me, why do you care about me so much?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue responded without hesitation, “I’ve never believed the man my sister married was worthless. I…. I don’t believe my brother-in-law is a good-for-nothing!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As she said this, the young woman’s exquisite features filled with staunch determination.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi laughed. “Why don’t you believe it?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Her big, bright eyes stared intently at him for a moment. Suddenly, she giggled.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“You’re so good-looking,” she said as if it were obvious. “How could you possibly&nbsp;</span><span>be a good-for-nothing</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This answer was entirely beyond his expectations. Despite himself, Su Yi was momentarily stunned. Shortly afterward, he couldn’t help but burst into laughter and give her a thumbs up. “You’ve got good taste!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue giggled, her laughter pure and picturesque.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Lingxue, I heard that a month from now, Pinecloud Sword Manor is hosting their end-of-year competition?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“That’s right.” She nodded, but the smile disappeared from her face. “With my current cultivation, I’m afraid it’ll be difficult to enter the top ten. After all, it’s only been a year since I started cultivating at Pinecloud Sword Manor.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Those who made it into the end-of-year competition’s top ten could enter Pinecloud Sword Manor’s “First Court.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">And becoming a disciple of the First Court meant you were qualified to proceed to Blueriver Sword Manor and continue cultivating there!<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Pinecloud Sword Manor’s influence was limited to Guangling City, while Blueriver Sword Manor’s influence extended throughout Cloudriver Prefecture’s nineteen cities!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The two academies were on completely different levels!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Two days ago, I forgot to prepare your birthday present, but it’s not too late to give it to you now,” said Su Yi. He took a scroll out of his sleeves and whispered, “This is a breathing technique. It’s not the highest level out there, but it’s the best-suited for your current cultivation. If you keep at it for a month, it’ll be enough to get you into the end-of-year competition’s top ten.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue’s eyes widened. “Really?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi smiled and handed it to her. “Would I lie to you? Right, don’t mention this to anyone else. Once you’ve memorized the incantation and understood its profundities, remember to burn the scroll immediately.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As he spoke this last bit, his expression turned serious.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>There was nothing for it! The breathing technique he’d given Wen Lingxue was called the “Abstruse Spiritual Essence Pearl&nbsp;</span><span>Incantation”</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Although he’d only recorded its “Blood Circulation Realm” cultivation techniques, the complete incantation was ranked within the top ten on the “Miraculous Arts of the Imperial Realm Leaderboard”!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Years ago,&nbsp;</span><span>he’d taught</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;it to his youngest disciple, Qing Tang. It was thanks to this very incantation that her cultivation had soared, reaching the Imperial Realm in a single bound and making her the world-renowned “Empress Qing Tang”!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">If a miraculous incantation of this level leaked, even just the Blood Circulation Realm section, it would bring Wen Lingxue no shortage of trouble.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi didn’t want to see that happen.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue instantly grew serious. She carefully put the little scroll away, then nodded firmly. “Brother-in-law, I’ll do as you say.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She still had no idea she’d just inadvertently obtained a stroke of good fortune grand enough to send the world’s cultivators into a mad frenzy.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Had she known, she couldn’t possibly have remained so calm.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi didn’t explain any further. He had plenty of comparably miraculous methods at his disposal.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In his past life, everyone knew of Su Xuanjun's countless miraculous arts and supernatural powers.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“If you’ve got time to spare, come visit me once every seven days,” instructed Su Yi. “I’ll instruct you in the profundities of the Martial Dao’s Blood Circulation Realm.” &nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue’s eyes lit up with wholehearted delight. “For sure!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She knew that, although he’d since lost his cultivation, her brother-in-law had once been the Sword Chief of Blueriver Sword Manor’s outer sect, famed throughout Cloudriver Province.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">With him to guide her, there was no need to worry about failing to make the end-of-year competition’s top ten!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“You should hurry back. If your mom discovers you here, she’s sure to explode,” said Su Yi. He couldn’t help but laugh.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His mother-in-law’s temper was fiery as could be.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue glanced to both sides, as if guilty, then stuck out her little tongue. She immediately said, “Okay, Brother-in-law, I’ll be on my way.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Her graceful figure turned, and she skipped away. It was clear she was in high spirits.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi watched her disappear from his courtyard. Only after she’d gone did he return to his room.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Although it was already twilight out, the Wen Family matriarch’s banquet was still going strong.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But it had nothing to do with Su Yi anymore.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue didn’t participate any further either. When she returned to her room, she took a bath, covered her slender frame in a bathrobe, then sprawled lazily on the bed. From time to time, she raised her legs into the air and kicked the bed, the snowy white of her calves coming in and out of view.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fresh out of the bath, she had a graceful elegance and pure beauty as she lay there, flipping through the scroll Su Yi had given her with the utmost haste.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The scroll was thin, with only ten or so pages worth of text. The characters were full of vigorous sweeps and fine strokes. They were timelessly elegant, and just looking at them was calming to the eye. The sight was calming and tranquil.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Brother-in-law’s handwriting is just as good-looking as he is!</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Wen Lingxue inwardly complimented him, but shortly after, the incantation inscribed within the swooping lines of text drew her attention.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Although this&nbsp;</span><span>tome</span><span>&nbsp;only recorded the Abstruse Spiritual Essence Pearl&nbsp;</span><span>Incantation’s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Blood Circulation Realm method, it was mysterious and obscure, each character and pause rife with profound mysteries.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Never mind Wen Lingxue; even the most experienced cultivators of the Great Zhou couldn’t possibly have comprehended its profundities in a short period of time.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fortunately, alongside the cultivation method were Si Yi’s handwritten annotations. This meant it wasn’t overly difficult for Wen Lingxue to comprehend.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Soon, it was dawn, and the moon declined toward the west.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue had finally read through the entire cultivation method. Her beautiful face was filled with bewilderment, but more than that, undisguisable astonishment.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She was young, but even if she were younger, she wasn’t ignorant of cultivation.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">There was no way she’d fail to realize just how mighty the incantation Su Yi gave her was.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">By comparison, both the Wen Family’s ancestral cultivation techniques and those taught at Pinecloud Sword Manor were crude and full of omissions!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">No&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">wonder Brother-in-law</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">&nbsp;told me not to reveal this incantation to anyone! Mm, he was undoubtedly worried that it would bring me unnecessary trouble…..&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She was stunned, but she could dimly discern his good intentions. The thought made her feel warm inside, and she was both happy and moved.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Before long, she took a deep breath, and her expression turned serious.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>She silently told herself,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Lingxue, Lingxue, no matter how hard it is or what obstacles you have to overcome, you have to find a way&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">for Brother-in-law</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">&nbsp;to cultivate again. He’s currently…. He’s pitiful enough already…..</span></p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "original_title": "Chapter 25 - Abstruse Spiritual Essence Pearl Incantation", "chapterId": 148729}
