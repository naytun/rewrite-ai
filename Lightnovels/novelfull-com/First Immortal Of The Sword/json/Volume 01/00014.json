He suppressed his confusion and asked, “Do I look injured?”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When the man in Confucian robes saw this, he finally relaxed. He said hurriedly, “I’m just glad you’re alright. I’m just glad you’re alright.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">However, when he turned to look at the others present, his easy-going, elegant expression turned cold and severe. “Huang Yunchong, you’ve sure got gall!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His voice boomed like a sudden crack of thunder, striking terror into their hearts.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Yunchong’s expression changed dramatically the moment he saw the man in Confucian robes enter the room. Hearing this rebuke, he froze in place.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Then, he could no longer remain seated. He rose and asked in bewilderment, “Brother Fu, what are you doing here?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“City…. City Lord?” Huang Qianjun was stunned, and he shot to his feet, looking dazed.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">&nbsp;Since when does Su Yi have a connection to the City Lord?&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The man in green seemed frantic too. He immediately put away his dagger, lowered his head, and clasped his fist. “Greetings, City Lord Fu!”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nie Beihu hurriedly greeted him as well. “Your humble subordinate greets you, Your Excellency!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The elegant City Lord was immediately the center of attention.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fu Shan!<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The lord of Guangling City, a grand martial artist of the Qi Accumulation Stage. He held enormous power, his prestige lofty as the heavens!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">So it’s him!&nbsp;</span><span>Su Yi finally understood, only for a new thread of confusion to rise within his heart.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">I don’t think there’s any link between us at all, though?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Suddenly, another possibility occurred to him.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Could it be that…..&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In the end, he said nothing. He just sat back and watched in cold silence.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Huang Yunchong, if I hadn’t come, how could I have witnessed this display of your power?” Fu Shan’s gaze was icy, as imposing as an infuriated sovereign.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>The veins&nbsp;</span><span>bulged</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;on Huang Yunchong’s forehead, and he forced himself to remain calm. He could get away with disrespecting Nie Beihu, but he had no choice but to fear Fu Shan, the lord of the city.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“Brother Fu, I&nbsp;</span><span>investigated this Su</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Yi’s background. Even at his strongest, he was just the Sword Chief of Blueriver Sword Manor’s outer sect.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“And today, he’s nothing but the disregarded live-in son-in-law of the Wen Family. He’s insignificant….” Huang Yunchong said as if thinking out loud. “Brother Fu, I truly don’t understand why someone as lofty as you would go out of your way to help him.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun, the man in green, and Nie Beihu were all wondering the exact same thing.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Insignificant?” Fu Shan’s eyes filled with mockery, but he remained otherwise expressionless. “In light of our prior acquaintanceship, I don’t mind telling you that before I came to the Immortal Gathering House, the young mistress of Spiritjade Prefecture said that if Su Yi lost so much as a single hair on his head, she’d have me offer my head in penance!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His words went off like a thunderclap!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Every last one of them reacted visibly, rooted to the spot.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Are you saying he’s…. Friends with the young mistress of Spiritjade Prefecture?” Huang Yunchong turned to look at Su Yi in utter disbelief.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The young mistress of Spiritjade Prefecture, Lady Spiritjade.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She was a true-blue relative of the imperial family, and although she was born into Lanling’s Xiao Family, the current emperor of the Great Zhou had granted her the title of 'lady’ personally!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Her status was terrifyingly lofty!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But Su Yi was just the low-status live-in son-in-law of the Wen Family. When had he become friends with Lady Spiritjade?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Nie Beihu and that green-robed man reacted as if they’d seen a ghost.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">With their status, they were well aware of the implications of Fu Shan’s words. In Lady Spiritjade’s heart, Fu Shan’s life was nowhere near as valuable as Su Yi’s!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Huang Yunchong, oh, Huang Yunchong. Your actions almost cost me my head!” Fu Shan said coldly.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I…..” Huang Yunchong could no longer remain calm, and he broke out into cold sweats. Even though he was the head of the Huang Family, capable of commanding both wind and rain in Guangling City, he still had to treat Fu Shan with respect.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As for Lady Spiritjade, her status was so lofty that the entire Huang Family put together still couldn’t risk offending her!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Father, who is this ‘young mistress’ of Spiritjade Prefecture? Is…. Is she more amazing than my uncle?” Huang Qianjun asked nervously. He’d realized that something wasn’t right, but he was too young to understand the implications.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Whack!</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\"><br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As soon as the words left his lips, Huang Qianjun felt someone slap him across the face. He thudded to the ground, his cheeks red, swollen, and bleeding.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He’d been slapped silly. Why? Because his father was the one who’d hit him!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Shut your mouth!” Huang Yunchong’s face was ashen, and his eyes were ablaze with fury. His terrifying expression made a chill wash over Huang Qianjun, who quivered from head to toe.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“If your uncle found out about this, I’m afraid he’d divorce your aunt on the spot, kick her out, and draw an irrevocable line between himself and the Huang Family!” Fu Shan laughed coldly.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Huang&nbsp;</span><span>Qianjun’s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;aunt, that is, Huang Yunchong’s little sister, was the favored concubine of Cloudriver Prefecture’s prefectural governor, Qin Wenyuan.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Qin Wenyuan was a lofty figure who stood above the nineteen city lords of Cloudriver Prefecture!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Due to the Huang Family’s connection with him, in the past, Fu Shan wouldn’t have dared provoke the Huang Family lightly.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>But now, everything&nbsp;</span><span>was</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;different!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun finally realized the severity of the problem, and he sat there, frozen and dazed, as if he’d lost his soul. He wanted to stand, but it was as if he'd lost all his strength. No matter how hard he tried, his legs wouldn’t support him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But at a time like this, how could Huang Yunchong find the time to concern himself with his son?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He took a deep breath, then suddenly faced Su Yi and bowed at the waist. Voice bitter, he said, “I had eyes, but I could not see. I didn’t know Young Lord Su was friends with Lady Spiritjade. I was mistaken, and I humbly request your forgiveness!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The private dining room fell into utter silence. Everyone’s hearts churned.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Yunchong was the head of the Huang Family, a towering figure within Guangling City. He even dared to blatantly disrespect Nie Beihu, the captain of the Old Guard.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Even when he faced City Lord Fu Shan, he was merely cautious.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Yet now, because of “Lady Spiritjade”, he was bowing and lowering his head to Su Yi!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Father….” Huang Qianjun was rooted to the spot, intense feelings of helplessness coursing through him. In his heart, his father was like a mountain, capable of covering the heavens with a single hand.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When he saw his father bow to a mere live-in son-in-law like Su Yi, it was as if… the towering mountain in his heart crumbled!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The man in green’s body went taut, his expression gloomy and uncertain.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>When he saw this play out, Nie Beihu inwardly mocked himself</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Look</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">&nbsp;at this situation! Did Su Yi really need help from someone like me?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi’s eyebrows merely lifted slightly.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Family Head Huang had been brazenly arrogant mere moments ago, yet now he was lowering his head and quivering in trepidation. Su Yi naturally understood that Huang Yunchong wasn’t really bowing to him, but rather to “Lady Spiritjade”!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Young Lord Su, how do you propose we settle this matter?” Fu Shan turned and asked lightly. Facing Su Yi, the lord of Guangling City maintained a respectful bearing. He dared not show the slightest negligence.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi’s gaze flicked toward Huang Qianjun. “Do you remember what I said to you yesterday?”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun started. Then, the blood drained from his face, and his lips quivered. “I….”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Before he could continue, Su Yi beat him to the punch. “I said, ‘I’ll give you the chance to get revenge, but if you take it, you’ll have to bear the consequences.’”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun naturally remembered, but yesterday, he hadn’t cared in the least.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Hearing it now, however, every word cut into him like a bone-chilling knife to the heart.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His terror and panic peaked. He couldn’t help but glance at his father, Huang Yunchong.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Yunchong, however, maintained his respectful bow. Despite himself, he was frantic. He grit his teeth and said, “Young Lord Su, I’m willing to single-handedly bear the consequences of this incident!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\"><br>Su Yi shook his head. He glanced at Fu Shan and said, “I can tell that the reason City Lord Fu Shan said all that was to warn you and your son of the potential harm and prevent you from crossing any lines and inviting even greater disaster.\"</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fu Shan’s expression froze. He really had brought up \"Lady Spiritjade” for that exact purpose! After all, Huang Yunchong was the head of the Huang Family. If they pursued this matter to the bitter end, as the city lord, Fu Shan would suffer its impact too.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But Fu Shan wouldn’t have guessed that Su Yi would see through him at a glance!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">After calming himself back down, Fu Shan solemnly clasped his fist. “Young Lord Su, your eyes are bright as torches. As expected, I cannot hide my intentions from you. However, I guarantee that you may resolve this matter however you see fit. I won’t object, no matter what you decide!”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Hearing the city lord’s solemn vow, all three members of the Huang Family’s expressions changed, and their hearts sank.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi’s expression was calm as ever. “I’ve never liked relying on others’ power. Besides, City Lord Fu, you came here to help me; I naturally won’t make things hard on you.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fu Shan inwardly sighed in relief.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">However, he then watched as Su Yi fixed his gaze on the man in green. “You like playing with that dagger, don’t you?” said Su Yi with a faint smile. “Take it back out and cut off your own hand.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The man in green had been fiddling with his dagger from the moment Su Yi entered the private dining room. His words were enigmatic and his movements flippant, but if not for Nie Beihu’s sudden arrival, he would have attacked Su Yi.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi naturally wouldn’t overlook him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The crowd’s hearts went cold.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The man in green was called Huang Yin, and he was the captain of the Huang Family’s guards. He was a peak Blood Circulation Realm expert, and within Guangling City, he was a top-tier martial artist.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">If he lost a hand, it would inevitably have an enormous impact on his cultivation of the Martial Dao!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I…. Might I atone in some other way?” Huang Yin’s expression changed dramatically. He was incomparably nervous.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi said nothing. He just smiled faintly at him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fu Shang gazed coldly at Huang Yunchong.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This formless pressure bore down on Huang Yunchong’s chest. Finally, his expression contorted, and he said, “Huang Yin, do it!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The blood drained from Huang Yin’s eyes, and his eyes went slack and lifeless. Trembling, he retrieved his concealed dagger, pointed its edge at his right hand, and slashed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Splurt!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A still-bleeding right hand fell to the floor. Blood poured down like a waterfall.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Yin’s cheeks twitched with agony, and he was covered in sweat.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Only then did Su Yi nod and avert his gaze. This time, he looked at Huang Yunchong. “Just now, didn’t you say that you wanted me to get down on my knees and crawl out of the Immortal Gathering House, kowtowing with every step? How do you think we should resolve this?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Huang Yunchong’s&nbsp;</span><span>pupils violently</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;constricted. Huang Qianjun, meanwhile, was ashen with fright.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fu Shan and Nie Beihu glanced at each other. They couldn’t help but pity this father-son duo. This was what people meant when they referred to “picking up a stone only to drop it on your own toes!”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">If Huang Yunchong crawled and kowtowed his way out of the building…. It would leave his reputation in tatters. He could forget about ever raising his head in public again!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“Father, I’ll&nbsp;</span><span>kowtow</span><span>! I’ll&nbsp;</span><span>kowtow</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">!” Suddenly, Huang Qianjun sobbed, threw himself onto the ground, and slammed his head into the floor.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Wham!<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The wood below shook. The sound of kowtowing was like the beat of a drum.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Soon, the skin broke, bloodying Huang Qianjun’s forehead!</span></p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "original_title": "Chapter 14 - A Bloodied Forehead", "chapterId": 148708}
