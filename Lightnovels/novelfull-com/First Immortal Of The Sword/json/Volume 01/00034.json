He was thin as bamboo, and he carried a human corpse in each hand.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">With a swing of his arms, he flung both corpses into the courtyard. Then, he sprang into the air and landed beside them.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Eh? Qing Wan, is someone living here?” It was so dark out that the Daoist had only just noticed that someone had swept the overgrown, long-abandoned courtyard. Everything looked fresh and new.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Qing Wan said nothing. Su Yi’s indifferent voice answered him in her place. “Wu Ruoqiu, you’re finally here.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He rose from his bamboo chair, his right hand loosely gripping his peach wood sword. He stood in the darkness, silently staring at his opponent.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wu Ruoqiu looked like he was about forty years old. His complexion was pale and clear, with a willowy beard, a sword strapped to his back, and a yellow-skinned gourd at his waist. He looked as if he’d transcended the world of the mundane.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Who are you? Why do you know my name?” Wu Ruoqiu was stunned, and he instantly went on guard.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As soon as he spoke, he let out a strange, shrill whistle.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But even after waiting for quite some time, the expected results never came.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Wu Ruoqiu’s heart sank, and he was a bit frantic.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">What’s going on? Where are they?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I killed all the Ghoul Worms,” said Su Yi, strolling towards him with complete confidence. “You can shout yourself hoarse if you like, but it won’t do you any good.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Who exactly are you?” Wu Ruoqiu shouted. His eyes glinted sharply, and he readied himself for battle.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Don’t be in such a rush. Before we fight, there’s something I’d like to ask you.” Su Yi was already standing just ten feet from Wu Ruoqiu.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Only then did Wu Ruoqiu see him clearly and realize that he was dealing with a teenager. The tall, lean young man wore blue robes and held a wooden sword. From his aura, Wu Ruoqiu could tell he was still only in the Blood Circulation Realm.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Wu Ruoqiu instantly relaxed, his gaze self-deprecating.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">I’m really turning into a coward. A mere Blood Circulation&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Realm whelp practically</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">&nbsp;scared me out of my wits!&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He stood with his hands behind his back and said coldly, “Young man, you’re still not qualified to discuss things with me. Go call for your master. I’d like to ask him how he teaches his disciples. You clearly don’t have any manners!”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His connection with the Ghoul Worms in the well had been severed, and even Qing Wan was nowhere to be seen. This made Wu Ruoqiu suspect that there was an expert backing Su Yi.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi laughed and shook his head. “If I met someone worthy of being my master, I might very well rejoice, but unfortunately…. I’ve yet to encounter such a person.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wu Ruoqiu was stunned. He jeered, “You’ve yet to even finish growing body hair, but you sure can talk! If you don’t call for your master, don’t blame me for my poor manners!”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The glint in his eyes flashed, and his aura suddenly changed. He circulated his energy, and shockingly, a faint roar, like a surging tide, rang out.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This was the power of the Qi Accumulation Realm.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When a martial artist activated their power, their blood and qi gathered and flared up.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">By guiding your qi in battle, you could ensure that every movement was so precise, it was as if it had been measured with a ruler, not even a millimeter off. This represented an exquisite level of control over one’s own power.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wu Ruoqiu was a Qi Accumulation Realm, Unblocking Acupoints stage cultivator. His skin was like bronze, his muscles like stones, his bones like iron, and his sinews like jade. Ordinary weapons could barely scratch him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A faint hint of mockery tugged at Su Yi’s lips. “‘Poor manners’? I’ll be interested to see just what an Unblocking Acupoints small fry’s poor manners are like!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I’ve traveled this world for a long time, and I’ve seen my fair share of arrogance, but I’ve never seen anyone as arrogant as you!” Wu Ruoqiu laughed in anger.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">An ‘Unblocking Acupoints small fry’?&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Listen to him! Does he even know what he’s saying?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wu Ruoqiu suddenly leaped forward, his sleeves billowing as he reached for Su Yi’s neck.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Boom!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A Qi Accumulation Realm Expert attacked with all the force and speed of lightning, sharp and despotic. His momentum alone could scare Blood Circulation Realm cultivators out of their wits!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wu Ruoqiu’s plan was simple. First, he’d take Su Yi captive. Then, he’d force the expert behind him out of hiding, putting himself in an unbeatable position.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Seizing Su Yi was the task at hand.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But then….</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A hint of an illusory sword flashed in the depths of Su Yi’s gaze, and a vast, cold, terrifying presence surged forth.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Boom!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was as if a bolt of lightning had struck Wu Ruqiu’s spiritual sea. His mind throbbed, and everything went black. It was as if he’d plummeted straight into the endless landscape of hell. A mysterious immortal blade flew in from beyond the heavens, shattering and suppressing destiny.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">At that moment, the four directions, the heavens above, and the ground below all brimmed with terrifying sword intent. The illusory sword hummed, filling his ears like the infuriated roaring of the gods.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A feeling of insignificance, helplessness, despair, and terror rose within Wu Ruoqiu, dealing a devastating blow to his mental state. He almost collapsed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This feeling only lasted an instant.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But after this shock, Wu Ruoqiu paused mid-charge. He was now exactly five steps away from Su Yi.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Five steps. That was the standard distance for a life and death battle between martial artists.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">At five steps away, even an emperor would be hard-pressed to defend himself. At close quarters, a single man was more threatening than a hostile nation!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When he was five steps away, Su Yi took action.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was just a simple stab.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But it was fast! And accurate! And ruthless!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was as if he’d drawn his sword countless times and were acting on pure instinct. His speed and precision were unmatched, as was his ruthlessness.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Spurt!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The dull wooden sword pierced right through Wu Ruoqiu’s chest, shattering his ribs like rotten wood and coming out the other side.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Fresh, hot blood dripped from the tip of the blade, pouring from the newly-opened hole in his back.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The force of the blow was so sudden and violent that Wu Ruoqiu bent forward, like a prawn in boiling water. His eyes bulged, and he looked dazed, as if he dared not believe what was happening.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“You…” he rasped, “Are you really in the Blood Circulation Realm?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Indeed, I’m the genuine article.” Su Yi pulled the sword from the man’s chest, then took three steps back.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wu Ruoqiu shook violently. Blood spurted from the wound like a geyser and poured down like a waterfall. If Su Yi hadn’t dodged just in time, he would have been drenched.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Thud!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wu Ruoqiu tumbled into the dirt, gasping for breath.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His wounds were so severe that he could sense his life force slipping away.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“You… Didn’t you have something you wanted to ask me….? Why… Why did you strike so ruthlessly? If I die, you won’t learn…. Anything at all.” Wu Ruoqiu struggled to speak. He truly didn’t understand.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Oh,” said Su Yi casually, “I’ve already lost interest in knowing.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“.....” Wu Ruoqiu was so angry he hacked up a mouthful of blood. He gnashed his teeth and cried out hatefully, “You ruined my sect’s master plan! Just you wait; they’ll get their revenge!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">With those final words, Wu Ruoqiu collapsed in the dirt and breathed no more. His eyes were still wide with resentment.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He never would have guessed that one wrong move would lead to him falling at the hands of a Blood Circulation Realm teenager.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“He couldn’t even endure a single imprint’s aura.” Su Yi shook his head. “The martial artists of the Great Zhou sure have weak souls….”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Just now, he’d used a thread of the Sword of the Nine Hells’ aura.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was just a single, miniscule wisp, yet it was more than a Qi Accumulation martial artist like Wu Ruoqiu could bear. It dealt a shock directly to his soul.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi had seized the gap this momentary shock created to pierce right through his ribcage.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“If I’d known it would be this easy, I would have faced him directly. It might have been a bit more trouble, but my current cultivation combined with my attainments in the Dao of the Sword would have been enough to kill him.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi had assumed that since Wu Ruoqiu was a heretical cultivator, he was sure to have mastered numerous dark and sinister arts. That was why he chose not to clash with him head on. Instead, he’d expended some of his cultivation to call upon one of his trump cards.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Who would have thought that his foe would rely purely on his cultivation to attack? He hadn’t used any dark or secret arts at all!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“It seems I took the heretical cultivators of the mundane world too seriously,” Su Yi said with an air of self-mockery.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Looking back on it, it wasn’t that Wu Ruoqiu was stupid. It was just that as a Qi Accumulation Realm expert, he’d underestimated his Blood Circulation Realm opponent right from the start.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Clearly, looking weak was actually an advantage; it made foes careless and complacent.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Do you know which sect Wu Ruoqiu belonged to?” Su Yi glanced at the nearby locust tree.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Mystic Master, I… I’m afraid I don’t know.” A panicked, shadowy red figure appeared upon one of its branches.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Her hands fidgeted with the hem of her dress, and she lowered her head. Her little face, still slightly chubby with baby-fat, looked tiny, helpless, and pitiful.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She’d witnessed Wu Ruoqiu’s death firsthand, and if she hadn’t clamped her hands tightly around her mouth, she would have shrieked.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi asked no further questions. He just crouched and started rifling through Wu Ruoqiu’s possessions.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>A sheathed longsword, a yellow gourd, three thousand-tael silver notes, about twenty&nbsp;</span><span>taels</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;of scattered silver in his pockets, and a yellowed scroll so battered, only a few pages remained.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">There was nothing else worthy of attention.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">First, Su Yi put the notes and silver away. Then, he unfurled the scroll.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Most of the scroll was ruined. The remaining pages described the wicked art of raising Ghoul Worms through human sacrifice; the content was utterly dark and heretical.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">After hurriedly skimming the text, Su Yi couldn’t help but feel disappointed. Even if he compared it to other unorthodox or heretical techniques, this scroll’s secret arts were pathetically crude; it was almost hilarious.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But the single line of text at the very bottom of the final page drew his attention:</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“From Weng Yunqi of the Deathbringer’s Gate, to his apprentice, Wu Ruoqiu.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi instantly understood. The sect behind Wu Ruoqiu was this so-called “Deathbringer’s Gate”, and his master was called Weng Yunqi.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Before he died, he said something about me ruining his sect’s plans? It seems that Wu Ruoqiu was raising those Ghoul Worms on the Deathbringer’s Gate’s orders.” Su Yi’s eyebrows shot up.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He had a hunch that this wasn’t the only place the Deathbringer’s Gate was raising Ghoul Worms in.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In other words, there were likely similar “worm farms” in other parts of Guangling City.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi pondered a moment, then ripped the tattered scroll to shreds. If anyone else discovered a vile art like this, it could lead to disaster.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Next, he picked up the sheathed sword.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The sheath was made of iron, and when he drew the blade, the stench of blood and rotting flesh assailed his nostrils.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi furrowed his brow in disgust.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The sword was made of pine, but it was dyed a bloody red, while its edge was a sickly, lustrous green. It was vile beyond belief.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“He actually used the menstrual blood of virgins to temper his sword? What kind of heretical cultivator was he? How worthless!” Su Yi shook his head, feeling repulsed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">Crunch!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi exerted strength through his fingers, crushing the pine sword into shards. Then, he set it on fire until nothing but ash remained.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When he picked up the last remaining object, something finally piqued his interest. “Oh? This gourd is actually rather interesting.”</span></p><hr/><blockquote><b>Translator's Thoughts</b><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">“At five steps away, even an emperor would be hard-pressed to defend himself.
