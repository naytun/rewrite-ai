At noon, he’d return to the city and purchase herbal medicines, then go home to prepare a medicinal bath to refine his body.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Just three days had passed, but he’d already refined all the energy contained within the sesame-seed-sized Spirit Obsidian pieces.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In the process, his cultivation had already reached the peak of the Refining Muscle stage.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The next step was beginning his “Refining Sinew” stage cultivation.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This cultivation speed was already shocking, and his breakthrough came over ten days faster than Su Yi’s initial estimate.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">However, this rate of improvement was also entirely reasonable.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>After all, he was expending fifteen hundred taels worth of medicinal ingredients per day, and the Spirit Obsidian he’d just refined was incomparably precious. Add that to the profundity of the Pine and Crane Body Refining Art, and it would have been difficult&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">not</span><span>&nbsp;to improve.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Just two thousand taels left….” Su Yi slumped in a rocking chair beneath one of the courtyard’s jujube trees, enjoying the sun. Mottled sunlight passed through the leaves, forcing him to squint.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He’d just finished an extreme cultivation session, and his body needed time to rest and readjust.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In just ten days, he’d already spent eight of the ten thousand taels Zijin had given him. Soon, he’d have no choice but to consider how he’d go about earning more.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">But then, there’s no need to panic about making money.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi stretched out his hand and picked up the cup of ginseng tea beside him, then drained it in a single gulp.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Instantly, a refreshing warmth flowed down his throat, then coursed through him like the tide, spreading to every bone in his body. His blood and qi flared in response, and his exhausted flesh began to make a rapid recovery.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In an instant, his full-body exhaustion vanished!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This was a medicinal tea he’d brewed with the Nine-Leafed King Ginseng’s leaves. He’d also added blood poria, fleeceflower root, and other ingredients. The resulting liquid contained abundant life force and spiritual energy.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">If I brew tea from the leaves, use the root hairs to make soup, and chew the fruit raw, this single piece of Nine-Leafed King Ginseng can sustain my cultivation for several days,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">thought Su Yi.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was, after all, a tier-two spiritual medicine; it could satisfy even a Qi Accumulation expert with room to spare.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">Tomorrow morning, I’ll go forge myself a sword!&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He exhaled, and his eyes brightened.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>In the past, he’d used his sword to prove his Dao. In the end, his sword suppressed the starry skies, and he reigned supreme over the Wilds. The people respectfully called him “the Swordmaster&nbsp;</span><span>of Abstruse</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Force.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His choice to reincarnate was similarly for the sake of pursuing the Dao of the Sword to even higher realms!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was fair to say that Su Xuanjun’s life was centered around the Dao of the Sword.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As a sword cultivator, how could he walk around without a weapon?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Suddenly, the voice of a servant girl resounded from the gates. “Sir, the lady of the house requests your presence in the atrium. She says there’s something she wishes to discuss with you.”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">After a moment’s surprise, he called back, “Alright.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">……</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The atrium.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When Su Yi arrived, his mother and father-law were both seated at the dining table.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A sumptuous lunch, the dishes still piping hot, was laid across the table.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changtai glanced at Su Yi, then said, “Sit down and eat with us.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Wait!\" Qin Qing glared at him in displeasure.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changtai immediately shut up, lowered his head, and kept eating in silence.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi was long accustomed to this. His father-in-law, Wen Changtai, was an honest sort, good-natured and unambitious, who wanted nothing more than to live out his days in peace.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Qin Qing set down her chopsticks and said, “Su Yi, have you heard that Lingzhao is about to become the direct disciple of a Heaven’s Origin Academy vice palace master?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi nodded. “I heard.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The day after the dowager’s birthday celebration, word spread that Wen Lingzhao had been chosen by Heaven’s Origin Academy’s vice palace master, Zhu Guqing as her direct disciple.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Within Cloudriver Prefecture, Zhu Guqing was a rare Martial Dao Grandmaster, famed far and wide. To ordinary martial artists, she was like a distant god or soaring dragon.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">For Wen Lingzhao to win the good graces of a Grandmaster like her was an unexpected stroke of fortune, and the entire Wen Family was in uproar.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When word spread, it stirred up great waves and shook the entire city. Who knew how many people were in uproar over this?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But to Su Yi, it was just a bit unexpected, that’s all.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It had been less than half a month since Wen Lingzhao joined Heaven’s Origin Academy, yet she’d already won the favor of a Martial Dao Grandmaster. Not even Su Yi would have anticipated that.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But at the same time, he wasn’t exactly “shocked.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She was to become the disciple of a Martial Dao Grandmaster, an Inner Furnace expert. What did that amount to?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Qin Qing’s beautiful features shone with delight. “This is an enormous stroke of fortune for the entire Wen Family. This very morning, the family head personally promised our family a thousand taels of gold, ten clusters of pearls, and the deeds to nine buildings. Furthermore, he’s decided to place Bluefinch Street’s ‘Apricot Clinic’ under our management!”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As she said this, she looked entranced. She was practically beaming; it was obvious how pleased she was.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The past few days had undoubtedly been among the best of her life. No matter who saw her, they greeted her with a smile and spoke with enthusiasm and flattery.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Even the family head and dowager treated her with noticeably more respect than before!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This left Qin Qing somewhat dazed; it didn’t feel quite real.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“That really is wonderful news,” Su Yi said perfunctorily.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Qin Qing was instantly on guard. “None of this wealth is for you. Don’t even think about it!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He lacked money, but he had countless ways to earn more. What need was there to covet such a paltry sum? He didn’t know what Qin Qing was thinking, either; her beautiful face flitting between different expressions unpredictably.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Finally, she seemed to reach a decision. “It’s been a year since you married into the family. You can’t just sit around mooching off us forever, so I plan to send you to take over the Apricot Clinic’s management!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi was stunned.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Although Bluefinch Street wasn’t in the most prosperous part of Guangling City, it was densely populated and a gathering point for people of all trades.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Apricot Clinic had been in business there for years, and they had no shortage of customers.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>What piqued Su Yi’s suspicion was that the mother-in-law who’d always loathed and detested him was giving him benefits out of nowhere. Was she</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">&nbsp;really</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;doing this out of the goodness of her heart?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He didn’t have to wonder for long. Qin Qing’s expression turned serious, and she said sharply, “I’m warning you, although you’re going to go manage Apricot Clinic, I expect you to turn in a thousand taels of silver a month! Any less, and don’t blame me for being heartless!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Su Yi finally understood.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">That’s more like it! This is the mother-in-law I remember. She’d never do something nice for me without a reason.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changtai couldn’t help but interject, “A thousand taels a month?”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Qin Qing said triumphantly, “I stayed up all night last night, and I finally got the Apricot Clinic’s ledgers in order. If business continues at its current rate, it’ll earn a thousand taels a month, give or take three hundred!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi was stunned. It seemed that in his mother-in-law’s eyes, he was nothing but free hard labor, and unpaid labor at that…</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">What’s even happening here? In my past life, I was the sovereign of the Wilds, the Swordmaster&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">of Abstruse</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">&nbsp;Force. Now, post reincarnation, even my shrewish mother-in-law can exploit me as she pleases?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“What happens if he can’t earn a thousand in a month?” asked Wen Changtai.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Qin Qing snorted, then said deftly, “I’m not unreasonable! He can just pay the rest off later. It’s fine so long as he makes up the difference within three months.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She paused, then continued leisurely, “But in that case, he’ll have to pay a little extra in interest. The more he owes us, the higher the interest will be. If he can’t pay off his debts within three months, he’ll have to pay interest on his interest, and his total debt will grow non-stop, multiplying without end.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Just listening, the mild, good-natured Wen Changtai couldn’t help but gasp. He was starting to feel sorry for Su Yi.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Qin Qing took a sip of tea to wet her throat, and her sharp gaze bore into Su Yi. “You won’t default your debts, right?”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Instead of answering, Su Yi asked a question of his own. “And what if I earn over a thousand taels per month?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Qin Qing burst into laughter. “You might be a moocher, but you’ve still got&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">some</span><span>&nbsp;ambition!&nbsp;</span><span>Even you</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;understand that the more money you earn, the better,” she said approvingly. “Then I’ll go right ahead and tell you that if you earn over a thousand taels, you can keep the rest.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Alright. It’s settled,” Su Yi agreed without a second thought.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Qin Qing was stunned. She never would have guessed that he’d agree so forthrightly, and it left her uneasy.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She thought about it, then warned him again. “If you dare try any funny business, don’t blame me for my poor manners!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Not long after, Su Yi left.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Qin Qing was sending him to the Apricot Clinic tomorrow. He’d live there from now on.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This was actually good news for him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Remaining in the Wen Family estate made everything inconvenient, but it would be different outside.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Soon, only Qin Qing and Wen Changtai remained in the atrium.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changtai couldn’t help but ask, “Why did you send Su Yi to manage the clinic? Second Brother’s been in control there for a long time, and everyone there is on his payroll, from the physicians to the servants.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He sighed despite himself. “If you send Su Yi on his own, they’re sure to bully him! How much is he going to suffer there?”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“If you were as capable as your second brother, how could the dowager have let Su Yi marry into our family in the first place?” snapped Qin Qing. “Do you have any idea how deeply this arrangement has wronged our daughter?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Now look at your oldest brother. He’s the head of the family, with all the power and authority that entails! He’s in control of the entire family’s assets. How impressive is that? Now look at you! You’ve failed at both studying and martial arts, and you never strive for anything! All the good stuff has wound up in your elder brothers’ hands!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“If not for me personally taking charge of our family’s affairs, with your meager capabilities, the rest of the family would have long since bullied us to death!”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Qin Qing rebuked him so viciously that Wen Changtai dared not say a word. He could only grimace. But then, he’d always been like that. He knew full well that compared to his brothers, he was indeed quite mediocre.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Furthermore, Qin Qing’s strong disposition and shrewdness only offset his own ineptitude.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Some time passed before Qin Qing finally seemed to calm down. “I know the Apricot Clinic has always belonged to your second brother, but that’s in the past. From now on, it belongs to us!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“As for whether Su Yi will get bullied… Hmph, don’t look down on that son-in-law of ours.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changtai was stunned. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I heard that a few days ago, Su Yi taught Huang Qianjun a lesson over at the Immortal Gathering House. I initially assumed that the Huang Family wouldn’t let him off, but look at him! He’s still alive and well; they didn’t so much as harm a hair on his head.” Qin Qing laughed coldly. “Although I can’t figure out their reasoning, my instincts tell me that something strange is afoot!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">She paused, then sighed. “It’s a pity. Were he still Blueriver Sword Manor’s outer sect Sword Chief, he might have just barely been a good enough match for Lingzhao.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“But now she’s about to become a Grandmaster’s disciple! Compare her to Su Yi! He has no strong points at all!” Her tone was full of dense resentment.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“If he hadn’t lost his cultivation, he never would have become our son-in-law in the first place,” said Wen Changtai in an attempt to comfort her. “After all, at the time, Lingzhao had yet to enter Heaven’s Origin Academy.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“You shut your mouth!” Qin Qing slammed the table in fury, cutting him off. “Are you comforting me or just poking fun at Lingzhao? Or have you been so ‘frustrated’ lately that you need someone to teach you a lesson?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changtai was visibly uneasy. He smiled sheepishly, but said nothing.&nbsp;</span></p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "original_title": "Chapter 28 - The Apricot Clinic", "chapterId": 148732}
