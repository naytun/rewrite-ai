People were paying attention to what happened here, both in and out of Guangling City.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Anything that happened at an event like this would spread to the outside world almost immediately.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Although, on the surface, Li Tianhan was here to offer his congratulations, he was actually here with ill intentions!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The Wen Family dowager, Second Elder Wen Changqing, and the other family higher-ups all sensed that this wasn’t going well, and each wore a more unsightly expression than the last.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Li Tianhan seemed pleased with this result. He said flatly, “Relax, everyone. Once I resolve these two petty trifles, I’ll be on my way. I certainly won’t do anything to disrupt the festivities.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Then, without giving Wen Changjing or the others any chance to respond, he continued, “First, I’ve been saying lately that with the Wen Family’s current foundations, it’s no longer powerful enough to monopolize Guangling City’s medicinal herb business. Today, you must give up half your shares!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>“Half? Li Tianhan, I’m afraid you’ve gone mad!” The veins&nbsp;</span><span>bulged</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;on Wen Changjing’s forehead. He was so mad, he practically jumped.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The Wen Family higher-ups’ anger was already written in their faces. The family’s primary source of income was the medicinal herb trade; it was the foundation upon which they built their clan.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Li Tianhan’s demands were exorbitant; he wanted to take over half their business in one fell swoop! He was practically demanding their very lives!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>The guests in attendance sucked in breaths of cold air, and their hearts shook.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">The Li Family sure is ruthless!<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Li Tianhan said flatly, “Brother Li, you’ve misunderstood something. Brother Huang and I discussed this matter earlier. The Wen Family is to give up half of their shares in total, but the Li Family will only take thirty percent, while the Huang Family will take over the remaining twenty. If you refuse, well, don’t blame us for our poor manners.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The crowd was dazed, but more than that, terror rose unbidden in their hearts. They’d just realized that Li Tianhan was using the combined power of the Li and Huang Families to force the Wen Family to lower its head!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In a situation like this, if the Wen Family refused, they were in for endless trouble.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">After all, with their current base of power, there was no way they could resist both families at once.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changjing, Wen Changqing and the others were obviously well aware of this. Their hearts sank, and they felt helpless.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Brother Huang is here too. If you don’t believe me, you can ask him directly.” As Li Tianhan spoke, he glanced toward the nearby Huang Yunchong.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Brother Huang, is this true?” asked Wen Changjing in a low voice.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Those seated all glanced towards Huang Yunchong, only to see his expression undergo a series of rapid transformations. In the end, he seemed to make up his mind.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He shot to his feet and said gravely, “It’s not! Don’t talk nonsense! Nothing like that ever happened!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He refuted it three times in a row.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>The guests were stunned, and at a bit of a loss.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">This… What exactly is going on?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Meanwhile, Wen Changjing and company lit up with delight.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">It seems Li Tianhan and Huang Yunchong haven’t formed an alliance after all!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Brother Huang, what’s the meaning of this? Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten the agreement we reached earlier!” Li Tianhan’s expression shifted; he’d clearly been caught off guard.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“What promise? That was just a joke! How was I supposed to know you’d take it seriously?” Huang Yunchong took a deep breath, then said expressionlessly, “Brother Li, I’d like to remind you of something: this is the Wen Family dowager’s birthday banquet! You’d best restrain yourself a little!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“You….” Li Tianhan’s expression darkened.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>However, he’d experienced countless ups and downs in his life, and his keen intuition told him that something unusual was going on.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">That blasted geezer Huang Yunchong! To think he’d turn on me at this critical juncture! Could it be that something unexpected has happened and he no longer dares to get involved?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Brother Li, is there anything else you’d like to say?” Wen Changjing snorted, but inwardly, he felt much calmer. Without the Huang Family’s participation, the Wen Family would only have to face the Li Family. In that case, he still had a bit of confidence.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Li Tianhan quickly got his emotions under control, then said expressionlessly, “Forget it. Let’s set that aside for now and move onto the second matter.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Those seated in the clan hall felt their hearts clench. The first matter was already enough to make the atmosphere so hostile, fighting might break out at any moment. Just how terrifying would the second matter be?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Then, to their surprise, Li Tianhan turned to his son. “Moyun, you say it.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Li Moyun stepped forth, looked around, then spoke in a loud and clear voice, “I heard that Su Yi and Lingzhao are husband and wife in name only, and furthermore, that Lingzhao loathes Su Yi to the core of her being. Thus, I hope the elders of the Wen Family can annul their wedding contract and return Lingzhao her freedom!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A single falling stone could give rise to a thousand waves. Just like that, the entire room was in uproar.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changjing, Wen Changqing, and the other family higher-ups were beside themselves with astonishment.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Who would have guessed that the second matter Li Tianhan had come to discuss was Su Yi’s marriage?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“This….” Wen Changtai and Qin Qing looked at each other, baffled. And yet, they had a sense of deja vu.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Why? Because just seven days ago, Wei Zhengyang of the Cloudriver Prefectural Capital’s Wei Family had said almost exactly the same thing! He, too, had come here for their daughter!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was just…. They never in a million years would have anticipated that their daughter would be in such high demand even after getting married….</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">At the same time, outside the clan hall.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As Li Moyun made this proclamation, countless strange and mocking gazes landed on Su Yi.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The conversations within the clan hall were audible outside, and the nearby guests heard everything going on. They too were incomparably shocked. None of them had guessed Li Moyun would make such a request!&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Many of those present predicted that Su Yi, the live-in son-in-law, would be ousted from the Wen Family that very night!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">After all, the head of the Li Family had come in person. Why would the Wen Family make trouble with the Li Family over a petty matter like this?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Detestable!” Wen Lingxue’s almond-shaped eyes bulged with anger.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun merely laughed coldly. There was even a hint of delight of schadenfreude in his gaze. “This guy’s looking to get himself killed!”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Feigning casualness, he glanced at Su Yi and saw that his brows had faintly knit together. This told Huang Qianjun that they were in for a good show!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“This….” Wen Changjing, Wen Changqing, and the rest of the higher-ups hesitated. All of them looked toward the Wen Family dowager.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was she who single-handedly decided Su Yi and Wen Lingzhao’s marriage, without the least regard for the family’s objections.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Otherwise, Wen Changjing and the others would have kicked Su Yi out a long time ago!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The elderly dowager sensed their gazes, and realized it was time for her to make her position clear. She took a deep breath, then said emphatically, “This marriage contract cannot be annulled, no matter who shows up!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A firm refusal with no room for negotiation!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The Wen Family higher-ups’ hearts sank, and all of them were confused. They didn’t understand why even now, the dowager insisted on maintaining this marriage.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Qin Qing was even a little frantic; she’d opposed this marriage right from the start. Who knew how many times she’d longed to kick Su Yi right out the door?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This was undoubtedly a perfect opportunity to do just that!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Yet the dowager just&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-style: italic\">had&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">to go and refuse!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Li Moyun furrowed his brow in deep displeasure. His gaze turned towards his father, Li Tianhan.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>However, before Li Tianhan could speak, Huang Yunchong let out a long sigh.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“You’re an outsider, yet you’re trying to extend your reach into someone else’s marriage? Moyun, my worthy nephew, please allow this old man to give you a warning: change course as soon as possible!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Li&nbsp;</span><span>Tianhan’s</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>pupils constricted</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">. “Brother Huang, what do you mean by that?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“What do I mean?” Huang Yunchong’s gaze swept across the crowd. Finally, he said in a low voice, “Alright, allow me to make myself clear: have your son give up on Wen Lingzhao. Otherwise, disaster is imminent!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Li Tianhan’s expression shifted.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The others in attendance were at a loss; this was between the Li and Wen Families. Why would Huang Yunchong, the head of the Huang Family, get mixed up in all this?&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was naturally difficult for them to understand.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Li Moyun was displeased, and a sinister look surfaced on his handsome face. “Uncle Huang, surely you don’t think I’m inferior to Su Yi of all people?”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Yunchong’s eyes filled with pity, and he shook his head. “What you’re doing now is known as ‘inviting your own humiliation.’”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Inviting your own humiliation!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Four simple words, but they left the crowd in a daze. They almost wondered if their ears were playing tricks on them.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Just how lofty was Li Moyun? He was the leading figure of Guangling City’s younger generation, an inner sect disciple of Blueriver Sword Manor. With a status like that, how could he possibly be inferior to a waste like Su Yi, a cripple who’d lost his entire cultivation?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Brother Huang, you seem to have become a different person overnight. You’re not just standing in my way at every turn, you’re even interfering in my son’s business!” Li Tianhan’s eyes frosted over, and he was inwardly seething.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He’d come here to make trouble for the Wen Family. He never would have guessed Huang Yunchong would ruin his attempts repeatedly!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Just as Huang Yunchong was about to say something, a low voice emanated from outside the great hall.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Brother Huang is right. Some mistakes, once made, are no different from setting oneself on fire!”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As these words echoed throughout the hall, the tall and stalwart figure of the captain of the city lord’s Old Guard, Nie Beihu, strode inside.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The entire venue was stunned, and the guests were bewildered. They couldn’t see through what was happening.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changjing and the rest of the higher-ups felt the same way; they never would have guessed that the captain of the Old Guard, Nie Beihu, would show up of his own accord.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Even stranger, Nie Beihu had only just arrived, but he’d already pointed the tip of his proverbial spear right at Li Tianhan and his son!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Nie Beihu, what’s that supposed to mean?” Li Tianhan had clearly been caught off guard, and his expression instantly darkened. He could tell that something strange was going on today.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Yunchong’s behavior had been out of character, and although Nie Beihu had only just arrived, he was acting strange too!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In the past, how could either of them have dared treat him like this?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But before Li Tianhan could react, yet another voice resounded from beyond the great hall.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Commander Nie is saying that this is the Wen Family dowager’s birthday. You and your son had best leave as soon as possible so as not to disrupt the festivities!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The tables outside the great hall were in uproar. An endless series of exclamations rang out.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Shortly after, beneath everyone’s disbelieving gazes, a middle-aged man in loose-sleeved Confucian robes strode into the great hall.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“City Lord Fu!” When Wen Changjing realized who this new arrival was, he was overjoyed, and he hurriedly stepped forward to greet the city lord. “Greetings, City Lord Fu.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“City Lord Fu is here too?” Everyone in attendance was stunned. Every last distinguished guest rose with reverence and awe, then greeted the city lord with a smile.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This new arrival was none other than Fu Shan, the lord of Guangling City!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“City Lord Fu…. You…. What are you doing here?” Li Tianhan was dazed, and he’d completely lost his cool. Tidal waves surged through his heart.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He’d long since heard that Fu Shan had no intentions of making an appearance at the banquet whatsoever. Who would have guessed that Fu Shan would show up at this critical juncture?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I’m naturally here to wish the Wen Family dowager a happy birthday,” said Fu Shan calmly. As he spoke, he took a jewelry box from his sleeves and passed it to the dowager with a smile. “This is a token of my good intentions.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The dowager broke into an uncontrollable smile, then thanked him repeatedly.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Only then did Fu Shan turn and look at Li Tianhan, his expression cold. “Brother Li, I made myself perfectly clear. I suggest you don’t stubbornly continue down the wrong path. You and your son had best leave as soon as possible.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Li&nbsp;</span><span>Tianhan’s</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;expression froze in place.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His gaze landed, first on Huang Yunchong, and then on Nie Beihu and Fu Shan. He seemed to have understood something, and his expression shifted continuously. An indescribable iciness coursed through him, and he sank into a lengthy silence.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Finally, Li Tianhan cupped his fist. “Sorry to have bothered you. I’ll be taking my leave now!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">With that, he grabbed Li Moyun by the elbow and dragged him off without so much as a second glance.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>The group gathered in the clan&nbsp;</span><span>hall watched</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;their departure. All of them felt restless and agitated; they couldn’t calm down.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Everyone could see that the esteemed head of the Li Family had tripped and fallen on his face today!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He’d come smug and complacent, only to leave crestfallen and disgraced!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>As for the guests outside the clan hall, they witnessed Li Tianhan and son’s pathetic departure with their own eyes. Wen Lingxue seemed dazed.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">This… What exactly is happening?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Qianjun, meanwhile, couldn’t help but snicker. Look at yourself! What can you call that but ‘inviting your own humiliation’?&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>What about Su Yi? His expression was as calm as ever. He picked up the wine vessel and poured himself another glass, then leisurely drained it. From beginning to end, he remained detached from the situation.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Just like that, the waves Li Tianhan and son stirred up vanished as if in a puff of smoke.&nbsp;</span></p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "original_title": "Chapter 21 - A Cold Glance, Disappearing Like a Puff of Smoke", "chapterId": 148725}
