{"id": 19, "url": "https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/first-immortal-of-the-sword/fiots-chapter-19", "title": "Chapter 19 - When Heaven And Earth Are On Your Side", "volume": 1, "volume_title": "A Sword And Rebirth", "body": "<h1>Chapter 19 - When Heaven And Earth Are On Your Side</h1><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When Wen Lingxue returned to Su Yi’s side, her cold demeanor disappeared, like an icy lake melting and revealing the warm waters below. Her beautiful eyes shone.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Brother-in-law, this feels great!” The young woman’s gaze revealed a thread of excitement.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi laughed, then offered her another pointer. “When conducting yourself in society, knowing how to use your position is a type of knowledge, like sailing with the wind or swimming with the current. Some incredible cultivators can even call upon the power of heaven and earth to prove their dao.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“But at the same time, borrowed power never lasts. An ancient poem states ‘when your situation is advantageous, it seems as though heaven and earth themselves are on your side, but when fortune departs, even a hero struggles to retain their freedom.’ If you rely on external power, external power will eventually cast you away.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When she heard this, Wen Lingxue sank into thought. “Brother-in-law, you‘re saying that when you take advantage of your situation, you have to know the proper limits, and that at the end of the day, what matters most is becoming strong in your own right. Is that it?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi smiled and nodded. She was clever. Some things, he merely needed to touch on for her to understand.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Not far away, a pair of hateful eyes bore into Su Yi.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This gaze belonged to Wen Shaobei.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He dared not offend Wen Lingxue, so he planned to vent his rage on Su Yi instead.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Furthermore, he was confident that there was nothing she could do about it. This was because, throughout the entire Wen Family, no one else cared if Su Yi got bullied.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Su Yi naturally noticed his gaze, but he paid it no heed.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">If that kid dares try anything, I’ll naturally teach him how to behave himself.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He and Wen Lingxue sat at one of the drinking tables. However, Wen Lingxue gradually realized that something was amiss. All the other tables were packed, the guests chatting and laughing amongst themselves. They looked vibrant and bustling.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Their table, however, only had the two of them. They were strikingly, unusually alone, the sight impossible to miss.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Brother-in-law…..” Wen Lingxue glanced at Su Yi. She was a bit angry, but also a bit concerned.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">There was no way she’d miss that both the Wen clansmen and the banquet guests looked at Su Yi as if he were some god of plague, or as if they feared nothing more than failing to avoid him!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi, however, seemed perfectly at ease. He lifted his cup of wine, refilled it, then laughed, “None in attendance are worthy of drinking with us, that’s all.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue couldn’t help but cover her mouth and laugh. She finally relaxed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">A cute little boy was headed in their direction. He looked about six or seven, and it was obvious that he was looking for a place to sit.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Little Mingrong, come sit with me!” Wen Lingxue gleefully waved him over.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The boy agreed excitedly, but when he saw Su Yi, he immediately stopped in his tracks and let out a crisp shout, “I, Wen Mingrong, might be young, but even I disdain to consort with a live-in son-in-law like Su Yi!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Throughout the surrounding area, the lively atmosphere came to sudden standstill. Everyone’s expressions went strange. Then, they burst into laughter. The air filled with the sound of revelry.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Shaobei and his companions clutched their bellies and guffawed, unable to control themselves.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Children spoke without scruples, but that meant that they were the most honest of all.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">His single sentence was enough to reveal just how low Su Yi’s status in the Wen Family really was!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Lingxue’s beautiful face frosted over, and she shot the little boy a vicious glare. Even so, she naturally wouldn’t argue with a child.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When she turned to Su Yi, it seemed he hadn’t even noticed. He was happily drinking away, perfectly content.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">……</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Within the clan hall.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Qin Qing was decidedly displeased.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The seats were packed, prominent figures as numerous as the clouds, but practically all of them were clustered around Family Head Wen Changjing and Second Elder Wen Changqing.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Almost no one so much as inquired at Wen Changtai’s table. She and her husband just sat there, alone and ignored. It couldn’t have been any more awkward.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The feeling of being so blatantly ignored left Qin Qing with a bellyful of resentment. “Look at your older brothers! Now, look at yourself! It seems I can’t count on you ever making something of yourself!”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Qin Qing glared viciously at Wen Changtai. Inwardly, she was overcome with regret. Had she known things would turn out this way, she would have sent her elder daughter a letter and called her back. As a disciple of Heaven’s Origin Academy, she could have at least helped them maintain appearances.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Hahhh… We’re family, so why say something like that?” Wen Changtai sighed.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This only made Qin Qing’s temper flare up. She whispered, “Look at the branch family members! Even they’re making fun of us! Even your eldest brother’s son, Jueyuan, has outshined our entire family!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It seemed as if she were venting all her complaints at once. “If you were even the least bit competent, we wouldn’t be in such an awkward position, now would we?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changtai grimaced, but he didn’t dare argue.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As they spoke, influential figures offered their congratulations, one after another. Every last one of them came bearing lavish gifts, making the dowager beam with delight.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Throughout this process, Family Head Wen Changjing and Second Elder Wen Changqing exchanged pleasantries with their distinguished guests. They both seemed high-spirited and energetic.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Qin Qing watched his play out. She felt like she were sitting on a bed of needles.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was then of all times that a certain childish voice boomed throughout the hall, “I, Wen Mingrong, might be young, but even I disdain to consort with a live-in son-in-law like Su Yi!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This voice had come out of nowhere, but everyone in the great hall heard it. The lively atmosphere instantly came to a standstill.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Immediately afterward, the sound of uproarious laughter emanated from outside. Those inside the clan hall couldn’t help but laugh along.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Who in Guangling City didn’t know of the Wen Family’s live-in son-in-law?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Whose kid was that? He’s got such spirit at such a young age. His future is limitless!” A silver-whiskered elder laughed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This only invited yet another round of laughter.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Qin Qing felt her cheeks redden. She looked at her mediocre husband, then recalled Su Yi, her son-in-law. Despite herself, she felt utterly dismal.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">It’s bad enough that I found myself a useless man, but even my daughter’s husband is a good-for-nothing! Why are the heavens so unfair?&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But then, before the boisterous laughter died down, they heard another voice from afar:</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Family Head Huang Yunchong has come to offer congratulations on behalf of the Huang Family!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Throughout the great hall, everyone instantly grew serious.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In Guangling City, the Huang Family occupied a rock-solid position as the second of the Three Great Clans.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Yunchong, moreover, had shaken the entire city. He wielded true power and authority.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Although there were numerous influential figures gathered within the clan hall, in terms of status, practically none of them were remotely comparable to Huang Yunchong.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Please, come right this way,” said the family dowager from the seat of honor. She was smiling.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Regardless of any prior grudges between the Huang and Wen Families, that the head of the Huang Family would come here in person was an enormous honor. It reflected well on the entire Wen Family.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changjing and Wen Changqing immediately rose and prepared to welcome him.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Outside the clan hall, the various Wen clansmen and guests all glanced over.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Before long, they saw the valiant, purple-robed Huang Yunchong walk inside. His son, Huang Qianjun, was right behind him, followed by two elderly retainers.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">In this formation, they were like stars clustered around the radiant moon.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“The head of the Huang Family!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Uncle Huang is here too?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Brother Huang, what a pleasant surprise! We’re flattered that you’d visit us in person.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">As Huang Yunchong strode along the path, the guests called out their greetings, their expressions humble and even toadyish.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Even the Wen clansmen wore respectul, fervent looks on their faces.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The young Huang Qianjun walked behind his father, looking proud and aloof. He’d long since grown accustomed to scenes like this.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Suddenly, Huang Yunchong paused mid-step, his gaze drawn to a certain location.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The crowd followed his gaze. Throughout the surrounding area, practically everyone had risen to greet Family Head Huang. The one exception was a certain table occupied by just two people, one man and one woman. Neither of them had moved in the slightest, and the sight was jarring.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">They were none other than Su Yi and Wen Lingxue.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-style: italic\">No manners!&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Many of the guests inwardly shook their heads.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>The Wen clansmen, meanwhile, furrowed their brows.&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic\">The esteemed head of the Huang Family paid us a personal visit. How can they remain seated so ostentatiously?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">One of the elders cleared his throat, but just as he was about to rebuke Su Yi and Wen Lingxue, his eyes widened.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">He’d just watched as Huang Yunchong hurried up to their table, bowed slightly at the waist, and clasped his fist. “Young Lord Su.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The entire venue fell silent. Everyone looked utterly baffled.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span>Su Yi seemed to have only just reacted. He glanced up at Huang Yunchong. “Here to offer birthday greetings?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Yunchong nodded. “Exactly.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Oh,” said Su Yi. With that, he looked away and poured himself another cup of wine, paying Huang Yunchong no further heed.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">But Huang Yunchong wasn’t the least bit upset. He seemed to think it perfectly natural that Su Yi wouldn’t rise or bow in greeting.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Many of those present were stunned; they almost didn’t dare believe their eyes.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">It was then that Family Head Wen Changjing hurried over. He smiled broadly and clasped his fist. “Brother Huang, what an honor to have you here! Please excuse me for not going out to meet you by the gate. Please, come with me. Let’s talk further in the clan’s great hall.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When he saw that Su Yi had no objections, Huang Yunchong straightened his back. His presence seemed to change; he now looked utterly dignified and arrogant.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I’ll have to trouble you, then.” Huang Yunchong nodded to Wen Changjing, then followed him into the clan hall.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Those remaining outside watched in a daze. The entire venue fell briefly silent.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Why was Family Head Huang so polite to that live-in son-in-law?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Waves rose in many of the onlookers’ hearts. They were simply shocked.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“What’s going on?” Wen Shaobei and the other Wen clansmen were at a loss. How lofty was Huang Yunchong’s status? Why would he take the initiative to greet someone as lowly as Su Yi?</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The nearby guests’ expressions went strange as well. They sensed that something wasn’t quite right about this.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Brother-in-law, this….” Wen Lingxue was rather confused as well. Her bright eyes flicked towards Su Yi.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“I beat up Huang Qianjun just a few days ago, right? Well, around noon yesterday, Huang Yunchong took the initiative to apologize to me at the Immortal Gathering House.” Su Yi smiled. “Going forward, you needn’t worry about the Huang Family making trouble for you.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">“Ah?” Wen Lingxue was so stunned, she couldn’t even speak.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi’s tone was too casual; she didn’t know if she ought to take his words seriously or not.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">At that moment, within the clan hall, many of the VIP guests sensed something was amiss as well. Huang Yunchong became the center of attention as soon as he arrived.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Huang Yunchong ignored the crowd’s stares and walked right up to the dowager. He ordered, “Someone, present our birthday gift.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">An elderly servant immediately stepped forth and proferred a jade box. “Dowager, this is the gift the master of our house has prepared for you. With this pair of carved hundred-year agate scepters, we wish you all the longevity of the southern mountains and success in all your endeavors.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">The dowager was instantly tickled pink, and she smiled. “Your presence alone is an incomparable delight. What need is there for presents? Changjing, hurry and guide Family Head Huang to his seat.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Wen Changjing smiled and called out to him. “Brother Huang, this way please.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">However, to his surprise, Huang Yunchong merely waved. “Just a moment.”&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Then, as the onlookers watched in disbelief, he stepped up to Wen Changtai and Qin Qing’s table, smiled, and clasped his fist. “Brother Changtai, Sister Qin Qing, I heard that your daughter has entered Heaven’s Origin Academy to continue her cultivation. This is rare, wonderful news! I’ve come bearing a humble congratulatory gift. Please, take it as a token of my good intentions. Whatever you do, you mustn’t refuse it.”</span></p><hr/><blockquote><b>Translator's Thoughts</b><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">The line “when your situation is advantageous, it seems as though heaven and earth themselves are on your side, but when fortune departs, even a hero struggles to retain their freedom” comes from Tang Dynasty poet Luo Yin’s poem, “At Choubi Station”.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"; ; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap\">I couldn’t find an official/professional translation for this one either, so just like the other poems we’ve seen thus far, I translated it myself.
