When he saw how happy&nbsp;</span><span>Chi</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">&nbsp;Jiansu was off in the distance, he felt a bit stifled.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Finally, he couldn’t hold back. “Chi Jiansu, what’s so grand? What’s so wondrous?”<br></span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Chi Jiansu quivered, then whipped around.</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When she saw Zeng Pu, her delighted smile froze in place, and her sharp eyes widened. “When did you get here?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">When he saw her bewilderment, Zeng Pu was inwardly exultant, and his earlier awkwardness turned into inexplicable delight.

We’re in the same boat; neither of us took first place.”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">This caught Chi Jiansu off guard. “Then who beat us?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Zeng Pu grimaced. “Who else? Who could have beaten us but Su Yi?”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Su Yi!</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Chi Jiansu’s gaze focused, but then, she burst into wicked laughter. “So, you’re second fiddle!”</span></p><p style=\"text-align: left\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal\">Zeng Pu’s eyes...</span></p>", "images": {}, "success": true, "original_title": "Chapter 572 - Not One Person Agrees", "chapterId": 162985}
