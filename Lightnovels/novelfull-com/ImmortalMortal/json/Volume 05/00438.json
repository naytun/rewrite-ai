In that instant, he understood why these bug eggs would cluster and throw themselves onto his battleship; it was because the battleship was emanating spiritual energy, which was why these bug eggs surged over in the truckloads. Some of the bug eggs had already started to hatch; that sharp mouth and fire red body, together with those thickly dotted legs, coupled with the strong Yin energy permeating through the air, these were Yin Fire Centipedes.</p><p>Shrill and sharp sounds could be heard. Mo Wuji’s heart sank; these Yin Fire Centipedes had just broken out of their shells but they could actually start gnawing at the exterior of the ship.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s spiritual will landed on the exterior of the ship; indeed, there were faint scars. Moreover, these were newly born Yin Fire Centipedes. If these centipedes continued to grow, and with so many of them…</p><p>Mo Wuji did not dare think any further. He was sure that if the battleship was chewed apart, none of them would be able to survive.</p><p>\"Dao Friend Tong Cheng, control the ship. I will go out to eliminate those things.\" Mo Wuji promptly made this decision.</p><p>\"Dao Friend Mo, you definitely can’t do that. These things aren’t Colourless Leeches. I suspect that they are the eggs of Yin Fire Centipedes….\" Master Pu Zi said immediately. \"Be it Yin Fire Centipedes or their eggs, fire wouldn’t be able to solve the problem.\"</p><p>Not only did Yin Fire Centipedes like Yin energy, they also liked fire. This was a contradiction [1], but the Yin Fire Centipede was a living example of such a contradiction.</p><p>Mo Wuji had a clearer view than Master Pu Zi. He said calmly, \"If I don’t go out, then none of us would survive. Master Pu Zi is right, these are indeed Yin Fire Centipede eggs. I discovered that these Yin Fire Centipede eggs have latched onto our battleship because of our spiritual energy. Soon, they will hatch, and those Yin Fire Centipedes that hatch from their eggs are able to bite through the exterior of our battleship. If our exterior defenses gets bitten through, then we would all die.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji’s words caused everyone to turn silent. They had all heard of the horrors of the Yin Fire Centipede, but they had never encountered one before.</p><p>By the side, Tong Cheng said calmly, \"Dao Friend Mo, Master Pu Zi is right. If these are really Yin Fire Centipedes, then fire definitely wouldn’t be solve the problem. Yin Fire Centipedes are fire-type demonic beasts, fire might even be able to make them stronger.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji nodded, \"I know. But everyone should know that my fire isn’t ordinary fire. Moreover, even if Yin Fire Centipedes do not fear fire, that should be referring to the mature Yin Fire Centipedes. These are merely the larvae and the eggs. I don’t believe that I wouldn’t be able to destroy some eggs.\"</p><p>With that, Mo Wuji directly pulled this ship’s lever.</p><p>In Mo Wuji’s perspective, even if these Yin Fire Centipede eggs did not fear fire, he would still use fire to burn them to death.</p><p>After all, these were just eggs. It was just like eating when you’re hungry; eating a bowl of rice would be able to raise your energy. But if you were to stuff in more food then your stomach could handle, then you would also die of overeating. Moreover, was the Scholar’s Heart an ordinary fire?</p><p>It was a heavenly fire.</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn’t know any water-type or ice-type skills. Otherwise, he wouldn’t need to use the Scholar’s Heart to deal with these fire-type bug eggs.</p><p>\"Kacha!\" With a light sound, Mo Wuji had already stepped out of the Immortal-Traversing Ship. Countless of bug eggs had already thrown themselves into his armour made of Scholar’s Heart flames. Fluttering sounds could be heard from his Scholar’s Heart defenses. No matter how many bug eggs there were, when they landed on the green defenses, they were turned into ash.</p><p>Mo Wuji heaved a sigh of relief; his Scholar’s Heart was indeed able to deal with these bug eggs.</p><p>In a short breath of time, there weren’t any bug eggs around Mo Wuji. Mo Wuji placed both his hands on the exterior of the battleship; his Scholar’s Heart flames came surging out like waves.</p><p>These flames soon formed rings after rings of fire around the battleship.</p><p>\"Puuu!\" The Immortal-Traversing Ship instantly stabilised. Soon, grey hazy space appeared in front of the Immortal-Traversing Ship. Countless of bug eggs were turned to ash under the Scholar’s Heart. The air currents in the air violently crashed against Mo Wuji; Mo Wuji could feel waves of pressure.</p><p>Before Mo Wuji could return to the battleship, a shrill cry sounded through the air. After which, a black figure which was tens of meters long pounced towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>This was a Yin Fire Centipede? Mo Wuji extended his hand, Tian Ji Pole appeared in his palm.</p><p>The Yin Fire Centipede was multi-coloured. It had a total of hundreds of sharp claws, and its mouth was filled with dirty green teeth, causing people’s hearts to turn cold.</p><p>\"Swosh!\" Before that huge Yin Fire Centipede reached Mo Wuji, 10 searing fire blades raced towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji opened both his palms, also shooting out 10 lightning swords.</p><p>\"Boom!\" The lightning swords clashed against the fire blades, exploding flowers of lightning and fire.</p><p>A strong wave of energy swept over. If he wasn't leaning against the Immortal-Traversing Ship, Mo Wuji suspected that he would have been sent flying.</p><p>Seeing that its 10 fire blades were rendered useless, the Yin Fire Centipede swept it's giant tail towards Mo Wuji's waist, and at the same time, opened its mouth and bit towards Mo Wuji's head.</p><p>This was Mo Wuji's first time seeing a centipede that could attack with both its head and tail simultaneously. In merely an instant, the Yin Fire Centipede's face had already approached Mo Wuji. That noxious smell coming from its huge mouth left Mo Wuji slightly nauseous.</p><p>Mo Wuji's Tian Ji Pole transformed into a huge shadow, breaking through space as it moved towards the Yin Fire Centipede's skull. At the same time, he formed a lightning sword which was even thicker than this Yin Fire Centipede and hurled it towards the centipede's abdomen.</p><p>Just when Mo Wuji's Tian Ji Pole was about to strike the Yin Fire Centipede's skull, Mo Wuji suddenly felt a sense of impending doom. His heart tightened as he did not hesitate to teleport away. He even gave up on attacking the Yin Fire Centipede.</p><p>\"Boom!\" A black radiant blade directly shredded Mo Wuji's afterimage. Mo Wuji opened his spiritual eye; an indistinct centipede merged into the Yin Fire Centipede, disappearing. That centipede's size and length was exactly the same as the Yin Fire Centipede.</p><p>Mo Wuji exhaled a breath of cold air. If he hadn't fled early, even with his spatial teleportation, he would have died.</p><p>At this instant, he finally understood how the Yin Fire Centipede got its name. It wasn't because the Yin Fire Centipede liked Yin energy and flames. It was because the Yin Fire Centipede had a separate body, and this separate body was a centipede made of Yin energy.</p><p>That meant that the Yin Fire Centipede had two souls; one was the Yin Centipede, the other was the Yang Centipede. If a person wasn't clear about the characteristics of the Yin Fire Centipede, he would very likely perish under the hands of the Yin Fire Centipede.</p><p>A violent, ripping force could be felt. Because of that battle, the Immortal-Traversing Ship had already left Mo Wuji far behind. An intense suction force could be felt from the bottom of the Immortal Chasm, causing Mo Wuji to be unable to stand firmly in mid air. Waves of pressure continued to sweep out from the Immortal Chasm. This only made it clearer to Mo Wuji that he had to return to the battleship as soon as possible. Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to last for long.</p><p>The Yin Fire Centipede could never imagine that Mo Wuji was able to suddenly avert its killer move. It immediately went into a rage as its huge body pounced towards Mo Wuji once again.</p><p>Similarly, Mo Wuji was bursting with killing intent. He had almost been killed by a centipede, how could he not be angry? At almost the same time the Yin Fire Centipede came over, Mo Wuji also charged towards the Yin Fire Centipede.</p><p>However, before he even reached the Yin Fire Centipede, he raised both his hands. Mo Wuji had used his own killer move - Spatial Imprisonment.</p><p>At that instant, the Yin Fire Centipede had been locked in space. Mo Wuji could even see with his spiritual eye that half of the Yin Centipede had emerged from the Yang Centipede. If it was a few instants later, the Yin Centipede and the Yang Centipede could have attacked him simultaneously.</p><p>How could Mo Wuji give the Yin Fire Centipede such an opportunity; the moment he imprisoned the Yin Fire Centipede, his Tian Ji Pole burst forth with elemental energy towards the Yin Fire Centipede's head.</p><p>\"Pui!\" A stream of green fluid burst out. The Yin Fire Centipede let out an aggrieved roar, plunging towards the bottom of the Immortal Chasm.</p><p>Mo Wuji heaved a sigh of relief. He needed to hurry back to the Immortal-Traversing Ship, otherwise, he would end up like this Yin Fire Centipede. There were countless of dangers in the Immortal Chasm, the Yin Fire Centipede was just one of the billion. Just this one in a billion, had almost already taken his life.</p><p>…</p><p>On the Immortal-Traversing Ship.</p><p>When they saw Mo Wuji burn the Yin Fire Centipede eggs, everyone celebrated. However, the terrifying Yin Fire Centipede came charging over, and soon, Mo Wuji disappeared from the surroundings.</p><p>\"I'm no longer able to discern Dao Friend Mo’s location. I don't even know where he is,\" Tong Cheng said solemnly.</p><p>Everyone glanced towards one another, then cast their eyes towards Master Pu Zi. The idea to traverse the Immortal Chasm was Mo Wuji's, this ship was Mo Wuji's, but now, Mo Wuji wasn't here.</p><p>\"Master Pu Zi, what should we do?\" Jia Qi asked urgently.</p><p>Master Pu Zi walked to the edge of the ship, and looked at the clouds whistling past. After a long moment of silence, \"Dao Friend Mo was unlucky; that Yin Fire Centipede was at least 50 to 55 meters long, that's equivalent to a Heavenly Immortal cultivator. Moreover, I heard that the Yin Fire Centipede had some secret attack method. Even though I'm not sure, but…\"</p><p>Master Pu Zi did not finish his words but everyone understood what he was implying.</p><p>[1] This is because Fire is Yang in nature.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
