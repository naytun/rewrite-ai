However, the spiritual will in Mo Wuji’s spirit storage channel formed a spiritual will whirlpool; this whirlpool was able to block against the violent expulsion force.</p><p>Over what was close to an entire year, this was Mo Wuji’s first time setting his foot on the Immortal Seeking Staircase without being blown away.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t go on to the second step. Instead, he started contemplating on his spiritual will whirlpool. The whirlpool formed from his spirit storage channel was like a Heavenly Immortal Domain, it constructed a space which was safe for him to stay in. Mo Wuji subconsciously glanced at the black whirlpool not far away; he had gained insights on this move from this black whirlpool. Of course, it was also because of his spirit storage channel that he was able to develop this spiritual will whirlpool.</p><p>After some time, Mo Wuji slowly lifted his other leg; he was prepared to set foot on the second step. His spiritual will whirlpool was just like a Heavenly Immortal Domain; it helped construct a safe space for him. Perhaps, this would be the embryo for his future spiritual will domain. Or perhaps, this spiritual will could actually form a tangible domain, and it would definitely be stronger than an average cultivator.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s foot went up the second step.</p><p>A more violent force came bounding over. Mo Wuji did not think twice as he activated all the spiritual will in his sea of consciousness and formed one spiritual will whirlpool after another.</p><p>\"Boom!\" His spiritual will whirlpools clashed against the violent force from the Immortal Seeking Staircase. A sort of soul tearing pain inundated Mo Wuji’s entire mind; this pain almost had Mo Wuji groaning. At the next instant, Mo Wuji was sent flying away.</p><p>\"Bang!\" Once again, Mo Wuji crashed against the sand. This time, he didn’t recover immediately. Even though he had been sent flying countless of times before, because he had his vitality channel, he would be able to recover in an instant. But this time, his recovery from his vitality channel wasn’t so fast, because his sea of consciousness was injured.</p><p>No matter the cultivator, the sea of consciousness was the most important part of him. An injury to the sea of consciousness was worse than a damaged spiritual channel.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s meridians were similar to spiritual channels, and previously, his meridians had been damaged by the spatial blade array. Fortunately, his cultivation was only in the Earthly Immortal Stage and Wen Lianxi had given him a pill. Otherwise, it would have been very hard for him to recover.</p><p>But now, his sea of consciousness had been damaged. What should he do?</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t make another attempt at the Immortal Seeking Staircase. With his damaged sea of consciousness, he would only be courting death by making another attempt at the Immortal Seeking Staircase.</p><p>He carefully swallowed a few pills. Unfortunately, while he had concocted many pills, he didn’t have a single one that could heal his sea of consciousness.</p><p>After sitting down for four entire hours, Mo Wuji finally tried using this spirit storage channel’s spiritual will to probe the degree of damage to his sea of consciousness. The moment his spiritual will seeped into his sea of consciousness, Mo Wuji was stunned.</p><p>His spirit storage channel actually had the same function as his vitality channel and his detoxification channel. The only difference was, his vitality channel recovered vitality and healed physical injuries, and his detoxification channel removed venoms, while his spirit storage channel was actually able to heal his sea of consciousness. In a single circulation, a good half of his sea of consciousness was healed.</p><p>In less than half an incense’s time, Mo Wuji stood back up, brimming with spirit and energy. His sea of consciousness had been fully recovered, and even his spiritual will had been tempered.</p><p>His own created reverse Immortal Mortal Technique was indeed heaven defying. This sort of meridian that could heal his sea of consciousness was superior to an immortal grade cultivation technique, right?</p><p>As Mo Wuji thought of this, he did feel a bit of pride. He had been trapped in a place like this; while he didn’t have an obvious improvement in his cultivation, his rewards were much better. For one, he had become a peak grade Tier 3 Pill Monarch. Secondly, he created his spiritual will whirlpool, this spiritual will whirlpool might become his spiritual will domain.</p><p>And the most valuable thing was, he actually discovered that his spirit storage channel could actually recover his sea of consciousness.</p><p>As he thought of this, his entire body shivered in excitement. Also, if his spirit storage channel could heal his sea of consciousness, then would his elemental storage channel be able to heal his meridians? If his elemental storage channel could heal his meridians, then even if he didn’t meet Wen Lianxi, he could have been able to recover by himself.</p><p>Once Mo Wuji sets his mind on something, he would do it; the immortal elemental energy in one of meridians shook violently, and his meridian had been forcefully torn apart.</p><p>Even though it was only one meridian, the feeling that his body was no longer complete flooded him. At that instant, both his immortal elemental energy and his dao will felt sluggish.</p><p>Mo Wuji immediately reverse circulated with his elemental storage channel, and at the same time, formed a reverse circulation path with his elemental storage channel and that broken meridian.</p><p>A few breaths later, Mo Wuji’s heart was filled with indescribable joy. His elemental storage channel was indeed able to heal his meridian. Previously, he didn’t try it because he didn’t know of that function. From the looks of it, his elemental storage channel wasn’t simply a place where he could store elemental energy, and the same went for his spirit storage channel. He had simply wasted so much of their potential.</p><p>He was completely oblivious to the treasure that he had within him. At this instant, Mo Wuji only wanted to chuckle loudly. His meridian cultivation method was truly exceptional.</p><p>Instants later, Mo Wuji’s torn meridian was completely recovered. Mo Wuji did not hesitate to set his foot back on the Immortal Seeking Staircase, and at the same time, form his spiritual will whirlpool.</p><p>After stabilizing himself, Mo Wuji went on to the second step. The violent force came bounding over again. However, Mo Wuji was not like before; not only did he form spiritual will whirlpools from the spiritual will from both his spirit storage channel and his sea of consciousness, he also formed an immortal elemental whirlpool from the energy within his elemental storage channel.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s spiritual will whirlpools merged with the immortal elemental whirlpool, and at that instant, it formed a unique domain aground Mo Wuji. On the surface, it looked calm and innocuous, but it was actually a domain formed from Mo Wuji’s immortal elemental whirlpool and spiritual will whirlpool.</p><p>The moment the whirlpool domain was formed, Mo Wuji was able to stand firm on the second step.</p><p>Mo Wuji stopped at the second step; his heart was filled with ecstasy. In a year’s time, he had obtained the rights to climb the first step. Alternatively, it could be said that he spent an entire year to gain insights on how to climb the first step. As for the second step, he only took one attempt.</p><p>Sometimes, the things you want may only be separated from you by a thin piece of paper; you only need to lightly touch it and you would be able to get what you want.</p><p>The current him, had broken through that thin piece of paper. Now, not only can he stand firmly on the second step of the Immortal Seeking Staircase, he had also formed a unique Heavenly Immortal Domain that was exclusive to him; the whirlpool domain formed from the fusion of his immortal elemental whirlpool and the spiritual will whirlpool.</p><p>After Mo Wuji understood this principle, his entire body felt relaxed. So what if he didn’t have an immortal lattice? Like everyone else, he could step on the Immortal Seeking Staircase.</p><p>At this moment, Mo Wuji’s mind was clear; he went on to the third step.</p><p>The immortal elemental energy from all his 108 meridians flooded out, forming one immortal elemental whirlpool after another. He didn’t even need to use his spiritual will; he was able to easily reach a higher level on the Immortal Seeking Staircase.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t continue climbing the Immortal Seeking Staircase; on the contrary, he went back down.</p><p>Mo Wuji had never climbed the Immortal Seeking Staircase fully before. Naturally, he didn't know that for other cultivators, they would have to get to the top in a single try. If they made a second attempt, the pressure would increase by an entire fold. [1] Now, he had the confidence of climbing the Immortal Seeking Staircase and enter the Immortal World.</p><p>The reason why he came back down was because he had some debts to settle.</p><p>Firstly, he had to kill Lao Cai to take revenge for Kou Yuan. Secondly, he needed to find Master Pu Zi; regardless of whether Master Pu Zi betrayed them or not, Mo Wuji was going to find him and get the truth.</p><p>There was also one more thing; he estimated that by this time, the Immortal World should have reconstructed the transfer array to Ying Bian City. He, Mo Wuji, wasn’t someone who would swallow his grievances; since he was going to leave, he would destroy Ying Bian City once more.</p><p>If he could do it once, he could do it twice.</p><p>After descending the Immortal Seeking Staircase, Mo Wuji threw out a pile of immortal crystals as he prepared himself to charge into the advanced Heavenly Immortal Stage. When he reaches the Great Circle of the Heavenly Immortal Stage, coupled with his unique whirlpool domain, even a Golden Immortal like Luo Jun would be settled in a short amount of time.</p><p>[1] So it means that the pressure had increased by close to 100,000 folds for him?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
