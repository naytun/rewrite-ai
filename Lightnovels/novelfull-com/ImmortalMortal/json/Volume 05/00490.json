Moreover, killing Bi Kang would not be able to change the reality of the Immortal World controlling the Corner of Yong Ying. He couldn’t stay in the Corner of Yong Ying forever; if he wanted the Corner of Yong Ying to truly be independent, he would have to wrest for power within the Immortal World. However, all this were merely ideals for the current Mo Wuji.</p><p>As he thought of this, Mo Wuji grabbed the crystal ball and said, \"Your three conditions pass.\"</p><p>\"Many thanks Dao Friend Mo. If Dao Friend Mo comes back to my Ying Bian City in the future, you will always be an esteemed guest.\" When Bi Kang heard Mo Wuji’s words, he kenw that he had passed this calamity; Mo Wuji didn’t go on a massacre.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not care about Bi Kang’s pretentious words. Instead, he turned to Hong Ju, \"Hong Ju, you have stayed in Ying Bian City for the longest period of time. I need to ask you a few questions.\"</p><p>Hong Ju hurriedly said, \"Dao Friend Mo, feel free to ask me anything. Hong Ju will answer to the best of my abilities.\"</p><p>Hong Ju, an esteemed Golden Immortal, was currently being so courteous and respectful to Mo Wuji, a Heavenly Immortal. However, Bi Kang and Hu Ming didn’t have the slightest disdain towards him. After all, Mo Wuji was able to kill them easily with a lift of his hand. To behave without respect would only courting death.</p><p>Mo Wuji said with an indifferent expression, \"First question. Half Immortal Domain excavates immortal lattice stones and provides them to the Immortal Domain. Also, in Half Immortal Domain, there’s this acute wood energy; if one stays in Half Immortal Domain for long without expelling this energy, he would gradually be woodified. I heard that there’s a pill that could expel this acute wood energy, it’s called the Wood Dissolving Pill.\"</p><p>As he got here, Mo Wuji specially raised the seriousness in his tone, \"This Wood Dissolving Pill can only be concocted by metal-type pill refiners. I conducted some research in Half Immortal Domain, but I was completely unable to find any metal-type pill refiners. I have already investigated on the pill formula, and I found that it originated from here. Now, can you tell me, are these metal-type pill refiners currently in Ying Bian City?\"</p><p>The moment Mo Wuji raised his voice, Hong Ju subconsciously shuddered; he could even feel Mo Wuji’s killing intent. Even though he had just sat down, he stood back up, frightened by Mo Wuji’s words. He slowly clasped his fists and said, \"Dao Friend Mo’s words are true. Those Wood Dissolving Pills are supplied by Ying Bian City.</p><p>However, those metal-type pill refiners aren’t in Ying Bian City. This is because concocting the Wood Dissolving Pill is damaging to one’s longevity and vital blood. Additionally, metal-type pill refiners have always been very rare. Thus, the Immortal Domain uses all sorts of methods to find metal-type pill refiners from the various low grade planets and bring them to the Corner of Yong Ying. Thereafter, they would be sent to the true Immortal World for fostering. Even the castellan and I do not know where they are.\"</p><p>Not only did Hong Ju answer Mo Wuji’s question, he even said more than what Mo Wuji asked for.</p><p>The moment Mo Wuji heard Hong Ju’s answer, he knew that he wouldn’t be able to get any further news of the metal-type pill refiners here. Hong Ju’s words should be true.</p><p>Mo Wuji nodded, \"Second question. All the cultivators at the Great Circle of the Earthly Immortal Stage from the various planets are sent to Half Immortal Domain. Is this related to the Immortal World?\"</p><p>Hong Ju hurriedly replied, \"Dao Friend Mo, I really don’t know.\"</p><p>Seeing Mo Wuji’s gaze turn to them, Bi Kang and Hu Ming eagerly replied, \"Dao Friend Mo, we don’t know about this too.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t ask any further. He believed that these people were merely ants for being sent to Ying Bian City. It was expected that they don’t know anything.</p><p>\"Third question. I once went into the Yong Ying Prison. It seems like they imprisoned some peak geniuses. What’s that about?\"</p><p>The moment Mo Wuji asked this question, he felt Bi Kang and co.’s faces turn pale white. He suddenly had a feeling that he shouldn’t have asked this question.</p><p>After some time, Hong Ju replied with a trembling voice, \"Such a thing truly happened, but I have only heard rumors about it. This matter isn’t privy to ants like us. Even if Brother Mo were to threaten to kill me, I wouldn’t be able to give you a specific answer. At the same time, I, Hong Ju, swear that if I were to reveal that Dao Friend Mo asked me this question, I, Hong Ju, will be struck by lightning and never be able to reincarnate.\"</p><p>The moment Hong Ju finished swearing, Bi Kang and Hu Ming also hurriedly stood up and started swearing, promising to never reveal of Mo Wuji’s question.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s heart sank. He knew that he should not have asked that previous question. After asking that question, the best solution was to get rid of the three of them. However, this Hong Ju actually swore a poison oath; it would truly be going against his values to kill the three of them now.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not pursue this matter. Instead, he continued asking, \"Fourth question. Who told Ying Bian City that I had a large amount of immortal lattice stones on me, and that Lou Chuanhe had the Immortal-Traversing Ship?\"</p><p>Hong Ju seemed to notice that Mo Wuji had suppressed his killing intent. He didn’t dare to hide anything as he answered promptly, \"It’s Kou Yuan, he…\"</p><p>\"That’s definitely impossible!\" Mo Wuji did not hesitate to interrupt Hong Ju’s words. He had an intuition towards Kou Yuan’s personality; he definitely didn’t believe that Kou Yuan would betray him. The reason why he became friends with Kou Yuan, was entirely because of Kou Yuan’s character.\"</p><p>Hong Ju hurriedly explained, \"Even though Kou Yuan might be a genius, he doesn’t belong to the ranks of absolute geniuses. The reason why he could have his tribulation in Half Immortal Domain and advance into the Heavenly Immortal Stage was because of Luo Jun. In his mind, Luo Jun concealed a Golden Immortal’s primordial spirit imprint. After arriving at the Corner of Yong Ying, when Kou Yuan was battling, that primordial used that chacne to possess Kou Yuan…\"</p><p>\"Where’s Kou Yuan now?\" Mo Wuji no longer bothered to conceal his killing intent. If he didn’t kill this fella that possessed Kou Yuan, he would never be able to live with a clear heart.</p><p>\"Kou Yuan has already entered into the Immortal World,\" Hong Ju answered cautiously.</p><p>\"Then is the Immortal-Traversing Ship with Kou Yuan?\" Mo Wuji snorted, then suppressed his killing intent.</p><p>Hong Ju hurriedly answered, \"No, Kou Yuan seems to have some agreement with some other person from Half Immortal Domain. The Immortal-Traversing Ship was taken away by that other person.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji sighed in his heart; fortunes truly clouded people’s hearts. For some cultivators, friends could never compare to treasures. Moreover, the group of them only formed a temporary alliance.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not have the mood to continue any further. He stood up and said coldly, \"Actually, I intended to kill today, but I’m not a person that enjoys killing. Since you’ve provided the conditions, I woun’t act any further. I hope that the few of you won’t give me an excuse to act. Otherwise, I will definitely make a third visit.\"</p><p>With that, Mo Wuji stepped out of the guest hall and disappeared.</p><p>Throughout the entire process, Bi Kang’s emotions went from anger to rage, to helplessness, then to acceptance… If this was the very start and Mo Wuji had left so arrogantly, he would have thought of ways to eliminate Mo Wuji. But now, he was very calm. To him, Ying Bian City was merely an encampment. After a period of time, he would leave Ying Bian City, and everything that happens here would have no relations to him.</p><p>Hong Ju stood up the moment Mo Wuji left. The reason why he stayed in Ying Bian City was because he believed that Mo Wuji definitely wouldn’t come back. But now, Mo Wuji actually came back to Ying Bian City for a second time. If not for his cooperation, he would have ended up like Lao Cai. He definitely wouldn’t stay in Ying Bian City any further; he had to leave this place. He was able to escape from Mo Wuji’s hands twice, but who knows if there would be a third time?</p><p>…</p><p>This was his second time destroying Ying Bian City’s defensive array, as well as the transfer array to the Immortal World. As for how the Immortal World would react, Mo Wuji completely didn’t give a sh*t.</p><p>At this moment, he was going around all corners of the Corner of Yong Ying, causing a strange phenomena in the Corner of Yong Ying. Previously, the various city squares and cities in the Corner of Yong Ying would hang Mo Wuji’s image. But after Mo Wuji visited these places, those images would be taken down. Everyone who saw this would act as though nothing had happened. Some would even stop and bow towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>Eventually, some city squares and cities now that Mo Wuji was no longer ‘wanted’, and they took the initiative to take Mo Wuji’s image down.</p><p>…</p><p>After leisurely travelling around the Corner of Yong Ying for three to four months, Mo Wuji returned back to the Lifeless River.</p><p>During this time, he met some cultivators from Half Immortal Domain. However, he didn’t meet any familiar faces like Bian Shuangbi and Qu Yang. As for Master Pu Zi, even less news of him could be found.</p><p>Additionally, Mo Wuji felt as though his cultivation could enter into the Golden Immortal Stage at any instant. The cultivation resources in the Corner of Yong Ying was limited, thus, Mo Wuji decided to leave and head towards the Immortal World.</p><p>Originaly, Mo Wuji intended to head straight to the Lifeless Riverbed, then use that gold Immortal Seeking Staircase to go to the Immortal World. However, the moment Mo Wuji reached the banks of the Lifeless River, he was stunned by the scene before him.</p><p>All this while, the Lifeless River had been incomparably calm. It was because of this calm, that the Lifeless River looked vast and majestic. This was especially so for the Lifeless Riverbed; it was simply dead silent. It could be said that except for the battle between the two absolute experts, there hadn’t been any situations in the Lifeless River.</p><p>However, at this instant, the Lifeless River was roiling and crashing. Even the most violent seas wouldn’t have such crazy waves.</p><p>Among the crashing waves, Mo Wuji could even feel an intense and enigmatic energy.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not believe that someone was battling within the Lifeless River because these waves did not seem to be induced by a battle…</p><p>That’s not right, Mo Wuji seemed to recall somethin.</p><p>The Lifeless River was vast and wide, but if there was a wind, it shouldn’t have remained as calm as a dead pool of water. Previously, when he arrived at the Lifeless River with Ku Ya and co., his mind had been occupied with the matter of the betrayal, so he hadn’t noticed this point.</p><p>At this instant, the Lifeless River was crashing and rolling; it did not seem to be the usual Lifeless River. If he were to think conventionally, on a calm day like this, even if there were ripples on the river surface, it should not have such huge waves.</p><p>There seems to be some unforeseen situation in the Lifeless River.</p><p>The moment Mo Wuji thought of this, he saw several flying treasures whizzing by. Soon, they parked at the peripheries of the Lifeless River.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
