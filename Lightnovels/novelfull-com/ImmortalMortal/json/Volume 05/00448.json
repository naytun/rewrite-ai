I believe that I will be able to recover my Tier 9 standards very soon.\"</p><p>Wen Lianxi sighed once more because she would never expected someone to be this thick-skinned.</p><p>She retrieved a pill and handed it to Mo Wuji, \"Swallow this pill and then…\"</p><p>Before Wen Lianxi could get Mo Wuji out of the ship, Qian Shan walked over and reported, \"Little miss, we have reached the Hundred Flowers Manor…\"</p><p>The ship trembled for a bit but before the ship could come to a complete halt, Wen Lianxi heard a laughter, \"Sister Xi, I look forward to your arrival everyday but why did you arrive so late? Did you forget about me…\"</p><p>Before the sentence was completed, a round faced girl in a vibrant red dress appeared in front of the flying ship. In the very next moment, the girl appeared in front of Wen Lianxi.</p><p>\"What, Sister Xi, who’s this? I have never met him before,\" The red dressed girl asked surprisingly when she saw Mo Wuji in front of Wen Lianxi. She was aware that when Wen Lianxi left, the only house servant she brought along was Qian Shan.</p><p>\"Oh…\" Wen Lianxi let out a ‘oh’ and hurried to say, \"This is a rogue cultivator with low cultivation level whom I met on the street. I’ve heard that he knew how to take care of the flowers so I brought him along with me. If you need a gardener to help look after the flowers, we could offer him a job here but if you don’t, we can just let him leave on his own.\"</p><p>\"Thank you sister, I am indeed growing more flowers nowadays and I was just wondering if I should find a few gardeners to assist me. Let him go there himself, I will accompany you there.\"</p><p>Before the red dressed girl could finish, Wen Lianxi smiled and interrupted, \"I am not going there because I want to make a trip to the Yong Ying Thrust Mountain… Qian Shan, bring Mo Wuji to the Hundred Flowers Manor.\"</p><p>Finishing her words, Wen Lianxi turned to Mo Wuji as if she was about to say something but ended up sighing and not saying anything before she turned away and left.</p><p>\"Sister, I will go to the Yong Ying Thrust Mountain with you,\" The red dressed girl followed closely behind her.</p><p>Even though he was only in the Earthly Immortal Stage, Mo Wuji’s spiritual will was incredibly strong. As he could sense that Wen Lianxi whispered some things to Qian Shan, she didn’t understand the reasons why Wen Lianxi acted like this.</p><p>Moreover, her attitude towards him changed and there were traces of disappointment in her eyes. Additionally, she didn’t exhort what he should do, when the next batch of immortal herbs would be sent to him as well as how he could contact her etc.</p><p>\"Follow me,\" Qian Shan’s tone was icy cold as well.</p><p>Mo Wuji kept the jade vase that was in his hand as he followed Qian Shan off the ship.</p><p>The moment they got off the ship, Mo Wuji could smell the rich fragrance of the flowers. Right in front of him was a massive elegant board showing ‘Hundred Flowers Manor’.</p><p>Even though the gatehouse of the Hundred Flowers Manor didn’t look very big, Mo Wuji could feel that the place was filled with spirituality aura.</p><p>\"Pass me the storage ring that little miss gave to you,\" After descending from the ship, Qian Shan said something which Mo Wuji couldn’t make sense of.</p><p>Mo Wuji asked suspiciously, \"Manager Qian Shan, this storage ring is for me to use to concoct pills so how do I improve if I were to give this to you?\"</p><p>Qian Shan shook his head, \"You shall only nurture the flowers in the Hundred Flowers Manor and not think about anything else for now.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji’s heart turned heavy as he didn’t believe that Qian Shan would be daring enough to make such a decision. Furthermore, the storage ring only had a low grade immortal pill furnace which was worth something. Mo Wuji was certain that Qian Shan would not be interested in the few spiritual herbs and the Tier 1 immortal herbs. Also, Mo Wuji could feel Qian Shan’s loyalty to Wen Lianxi so he would definitely not do such things behind her back.</p><p>\"Manager Qian Shan, what is the meaning of this? Bring me to meet your little miss, I want to get things clear,\" Mo Wuji was still confused over the situation presently.</p><p>Qian Shan’s face turned serious, \" Mo Wuji, I know little miss has a very kind heart but you shouldn’t go overboard just because she is kind. If you insist on doing so, don’t blame me for being rude.\"</p><p>Even though Mo Wuji had no idea what was going on, he knew that it would be impossible for him to meet Wen Lianxi again. He took out the storage ring and handed it to Qian Shan without saying anything. There must have been a misunderstanding in between but regardless, Mo Wuji would not be so desperate to beg her.</p><p>\"Master Qian Shan,\" Just as Qian Shan kept the storage ring, an elder with a face full of wrinkles hurried over to greet him.</p><p>Qian Shan nodded and said, \"Deacon Wei, this is a flower boy to help with the planting. See if you need help here and if you don’t, you can let him leave as he wishes. I am going to accompany little miss to the Thrust Mountain so I won’t be staying long.\"</p><p>\"Servant will handle this, please stay safe on your trip,\" The elder replied as he sent Qian Shan off.</p><p>The elder turned to instruct Mo Wuji to follow him only after Qian Shan boarded the flying ship and took off.</p><p>If not for the fact that he received help from Wen Lianxi and even made a promise with her, Mo Wuji would have left long ago. Even if Mo Wuji had no clue about the current situation, he still clasped his fist towards this elder and said, \"Greetings Deacon Wei, I’m Mo Wuji.\"</p><p>Deacon Wei nodded his head but didn’t speak as they entered the Hundred Flowers Manor.</p><p>Mo Wuji used his spiritual will to observe the surroundings very carefully and he failed to recognise the restriction array used for this Hundred Flowers Manor.</p><p>After entering the Hundred Flowers Manor, Mo Wuji was captivated and shocked by the variety of fresh flowers within his sight. This should be called the Ten Thousand Flowers Manor and not the Hundred Flowers Manor.</p><p>In the middle of sea of flowers was a wide path that leads directly to an extremely stylish building. Mo Wuji’s guess was that it should be the residence district of the Hundred Flowers Manor. There were terraces of rice paddies stretching out in between these flowers and Mo Wuji estimated with one glance that there were about thousands of these paddies.</p><p>Even though Mo Wuji couldn’t recognise these flowers, he was after all still a Heaven grade pill refiner so he was aware that a great majority of these flowers were immortal herbs.</p><p>Deacon Wei took Mo Wuji across the sea of flowers and ended up in front of a row of low lying houses. This place was several kilometres away from the stylish building that they saw earlier.</p><p>Just as Mo Wuji was wondering if this was where the gardener would reside in, Deacon Wei pointed to one of the houses and said, \"Mo Wuji, you will stay here in the future. Oh yes, go analyse the flowers here and find me after a few days. I will allocate you the region you are supposed to be in charge of. As for the monthly allowance, you can find me directly to collect it.\"</p><p>As he was speaking, Deacon Wei took out a book to hand it over to Mo Wuji.</p><p>\"I will be receiving monthly allowance?\" Mo Wuji asked because he was here to study Pill Dao and he already found it weird that he was tasked to take care of flowers and now he would be receiving allowance. Weren’t they treating him like a house guard now?</p><p>Deacon Wei revealed a smile by the side of his lips as he showed his mouth full black teeth and said, \"Of course. Even though it is not a lot, it isn’t something everyone has. You must do your job well and if you are not up to standard, you could have nothing to do with the Hundred Flowers Manor very soon.\"</p><p>After Deacon Wei said his piece, he turned and left.</p><p>Mo Wuji scanned through his own residence and saw ‘D115’ on his room. The moment he pushed his door, a pile of dust fell and landed on him.</p><p>Mo Wuji looked at the room and saw how ordinary it was. There were only one bed, one table, one chair and nothing else.</p><p>Even his immortal cave in the Half Immortal Domain was much better than this place. Mo Wuji shook his head and executed a dust technique to clean this whole place of its dust. After cleaning up, he walked over to take a seat at his chair as he took out the jade vase that Wen Lianxi handed him.</p><p>There was only one pill in the jade vase and despite not seeing this pill before, he knew that this was a antidote.</p><p>He seemed to have a little more understanding of the situation now as he placed the pill in his mouth. This pill turned into a faint healing energy as it charged into his sea of consciousness as it resolved the poisonous spiritual will imprint in his sea of consciousness. So this was indeed an antidote pill, could it be that Wen Lianxi felt guilty and didn’t wish to control him through this way anymore?</p><p>Not possible, if this was the case, there would be something wrong with Wen Lianxi’s final attitude towards him.</p><p>Mo Wuji had experienced many incidents before so after pondering for a while, he finally came to a understanding. His final conclusion was that Wen Lianxi didn’t want his help anymore as she terminated their ‘contract’. Wen Lianxi was really kind to help him resolve the toxin in him even after terminating their deal. However, she did take back everything she gave him initially.</p><p>Mo Wuji let out a laughter of ridicule because he was still planning to achieve a lot here. He was thinking of advancing to become a Tier 3 Pill Monarch before leaving but who would have expected that he was thrown back to his original state so quickly.</p><p>Women really have an ever changing mind as her thoughts could change so quickly overnight. Fortunately, she acted fast and healed him the moment she thought about it.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t think too much about it because this woman was still considered very kind. Even after she decided not to work with him, she still found him a job, didn’t mind helping him recover and even detoxified the toxin in him willingly.</p><p>After sorting his mind, Mo Wuji decided to stay here for a few days to find out more about some things before leaving the Hundred Flowers Manor immediately.</p><p>Since the other party no longer had any intentions to work with him, there was no reason for him to stay here. He would definitely pay back the favour that he owed her if he ever meet her again. At the thought of this, Mo Wuji simply calmed his heart down as he started reading through the book Deacon Wei gave him. Initially, Mo Wuji wasn’t too interested in this book because he felt that Deacon Wu was only a gardener with not so high cultivation level so how good could the book from him be?</p><p>Only after Mo Wuji opened the book, he realised that he was wrong. This was a actually a complete book of hundred flowers. Whether it was spiritual herbs or immortal herbs, as long as they bloomed here, it would be recorded in this book. Mo Wuji was engrossed in this book as soon as he opened it.</p><p>Three days later, Mo Wuji gave up the idea of leaving the Hundred Flowers Manor. He spent most of his time studying the flowers at the Hundred Flowers Manor which were graded as immortal herbs and above. He had completely forgotten about finding Deacon Wei after a few days.</p><p>On the ninth day, Deacon Wei took the initiative to find Mo Wuji here.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
