Even though he did not feel any killing intent from Mo Wuji, he was sure that Mo Wuji wasn't lying. When he knew that Mo Wuji had dared to fight with Meng Tianyu, and had even stolen Meng Tianyu's magic treasure, unless he was crazy, he wouldn't have come.</p><p>Needless to say, there was only one outcome for him now. If he didn't say anything, he would die. But if Mo Wuji didn't follow him, he would also die.</p><p>As he thought of this, Lord Axe gritted his teeth and said, \"Dao Friend Mo, you're right. I'm indeed lying to you. Actually, I'm not the one who wants to lure you out, but my superior. You should know that every time the Immortal Domain experts come to trade for blackstone, it would always be Guang Quan handling the transactions. By some chance, I managed to get acquainted with one of those people from the Immortal Domain. That person wants to me to purchase blackstones then sell it to him privately. Because I had to give you my spirit stone slags, I'm no longer able to purchase any more blackstones for him. That person wants to meet you.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji said indifferently, \"You're afraid that I wouldn't go and meet him, then he would take away your little life, which is why you're trying to trick me out, right?\"</p><p>\"That's right.\" The cat's already out of the bag, Lord Axe could only tell the truth.</p><p>\"What's his name? And do you know his rough cultivation?\" Mo Wuji wasn't surprised with Hong Fuji's actions. Even if it was someone else, he probably would have done the same thing as Hong Fuji. However, he was not like any other person. He needed large amounts of spirit stone slags and if he could directly transact with a person from the Immortal Domain, then it would be the best possible scenario.</p><p>As long as this person's cultivation wasn't much higher than his, his life wouldn't be threatened. At the most, he could escape to the Mining Area of Death. The worst situation was if the other party's cultivation vastly exceeded his, and he wouldn't even have a chance to escape.</p><p>When Hong Fuji heard that Mo Wuji sounded like he would go, he immediately said, \"His name is Gong Hou, he should be in the Heavenly Immortal Stage. It's rumored that the cultivators across the Immortal Chasm were at the Great Circle of the Heavenly Immortal Stage at the very most. As for the reason, it should be due to blackstone.\"</p><p>\"Oh, you know the uses of blackstone?\" Mo Wuji instantly got interested. Knowing that the other party was a Heavenly Immortal cultivator, he was no longer afraid.</p><p>Hong Fuji shook his head and said, \"I only know that immortals are related to blackstone. As for the exact relations, I'm not too sure about it myself.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji nodded, \"Alright, I will follow you. Lead the way.\"</p><p>\"Ah… Ok, Dao Friend Mo, please follow me.\" Hong Fuji was filled with ecstasy. He never expected that Mo Wuji would really dare to follow him.</p><p>As he recalled that Mo Wuji even dared to fight Meng Tianyu, he roughly came to an understanding. Mo Wuji was like a baby calf; he was rather powerful and had yet to face anyone much stronger than him. This time, he will definitely know what it means to be an immortal. When he thought about how Lord Gong Hou was going to take revenge for him, Hong Fuji was so excited that even his feet were trembling.</p><p>Mo Wuji casually sent a flying messenger sword to Master Pu Zi, telling Master Pu Zi that he was going to meet an immortal. If he did not return in a day, he wanted Master Pu Zi and co. to immediately leave Half Immortal Domain.</p><p>Master Pu Zi and co. could still reside in Half Immortal Domain because of him. But if he could no longer return to Half Immortal Domain, then Master Pu Zi and co. would be left in a dangerous situation.</p><p>Just as Mo Wuji and Hong Fuji reached the entrance of Half Immortal Domain, an extremely intense spiritual will came scanning over; Mo Wuji hurriedly retracted his aura. This strong spiritual will definitely didn't belong to Guang Quan, nor any other cultivator from Half Immortal Domain. It definitely belonged to an expert from Immortal Domain.</p><p>\"Have the people from Immortal Domain come to the Half Immortal Domain?\" After leaving Half Immortal Domain, Mo Wuji finally asked.</p><p>Hong Fuji nodded, \"That's right. Usually every half a year to a year, they would come and trade for blackstone. That spiritual will that just swept past us should be from an expert from the Immortal Domain.\"</p><p>It was indeed the case. Mo Wuji had a new apprehension in his heart. He was truly not a match for such an expert. From the looks of it, with his ability at Earthly Immortal Stage Level 5, he could only be a king in the Half Immortal Domain. But if he met a real Heavenly Immortal expert, he would still have to be careful.</p><p>…</p><p>Lord Axe was worried that Mo Wuji would change his mind halfway, so he pushed his flying treasure to his max. Mo Wuji's flying car was forged by Master Pu Zi using a huge piece of Celestial Sunflower Gold. No matter how fast Lord Axe went, Mo Wuji was able to casually keep up. This led to a sense of crisis within Lord Axe; if he was ever chased by Mo Wuji, it would be hard for him to escape.</p><p>Half a day later, Lord Axe stopped. Mo Wuji also kept the flying car. He saw a grey robed man sitted cross-legged on a huge piece of black rock. The guy’s eyes were low, and his aura was retracted. Mo Wuji was unable to discern this fella’s cultivation with his spiritual will.</p><p>This person was definitely that Immortal Domain expert trading with Lord Axe. Mo Wuji's face was calm and without emotion, he didn't even exude any ripples of elemental energy. However, his spirit storage channel and elemental storage channel had already been pushed to the max. He could burst out with full power at any moment.</p><p>\"Lord Gong, I have already brought Mo Wuji over. It's this person.\" Hong Fuji stepped forward and kneeled on the floor. His tone was respectful and cautious. Mo Wuji could even hear a sort of relaxedness in his voice.</p><p>\"You are Mo Wuji? The newbie who stole Hong Fuji's blackstones and half immortal stones?\" Gong Hou raised his head and his gaze landed on Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji stared at this immortal in front of him; he had a pair of thin and long eyes, his nose bridge was short to the point where he looked horrendous.</p><p>\"That's right, I am Mo Wuji. I deserved those half immortal stones for selling my blackstones to Hong Fuji. I, Mo Wuji, might not be rich, but I won't stoop so low as to stealing,\" Mo Wuji clasped his fists and said calmly. It's a joke if he were to kowtow to this person like Hong Fuji. Besides his parents, he, Mo Wuji, had never kneeled in front of anyone. A mere Heavenly Immortal, he could even be the pseudo-immortal mentioned by Master Pu Zi, but would he be qualified for Mo Wuji to kneel in front of?</p><p>When Hong Fuji heard Mo Wuji's words, his entire body started shivering, he hurriedly said, \"Lord Gong, because Mo Wuji snatched away my half immortal stones, I'm unable to purchase any blackstone. This is why I'm unable to collect any blackstones for the lord.\"</p><p>Originally, he had a bit of blackstones. But previously, he had to ask Guang Quan for permission to attack Mo Wuji, and all these blackstones ended up in Guang Quan's pocket.</p><p>Gong Hou nodded, he spoke to Hong Fuji in a carefree manner, \"I can't blame you. You've worked so hard over these years, go then…\"</p><p>When he heard the last two words, Hong Fuji's entire body turned cold, a deep sense of impending doom erupted from the bottom of his heart. He immediately knew that Gong Hou wanted to kill him. He couldn't care about anything else, his body burst forth with elemental energy as he tried to escape.</p><p>\"Boom!\" A black light flashed over. Hong Fuji wasn't even able to cry out in pain before he was turned into ash by this black light.</p><p>Even though Mo Wuji didn't use any spiritual will, nor exude any elemental energy ripples, he could clearly feel that this Lord Gong was far stronger than him. That elemental energy enveloping him far exceeded the boundaries of usual elemental energy. Could this be the legendary immortal energy?</p><p>Unfortunately, the Lord Axe that once reigned over the undergrounds of Half Immortal Domain, had disappeared off the face of the world in a single instant.</p><p>\"Mo Wuji, you know why I killed him?\" After Gong Hou killed Hong Fuji, he acted as though nothing had happened as he calmly asked Mo Wuji this question.</p><p>Mo Wuji sneered in his heart, if you want to use this method to intimidate me, a fake immortal like you wasn’t enough.</p><p>\"Why you killed him is none of my business. If your Excellency has nothing else, I won’t continue to accompany you.\" Mo Wuji said might have said that but his feet didn’t move at all. His expression didn’t even change.</p><p>Gong Hou chortled, \"Not bad, you have balls. Ever since you came here, you didn’t protect yourself with any sort of elemental energy defenses. When you see me, you didn’t even kneel. Now, your tone is also so aggressive. Could it be that you think that I wouldn’t dare to kill you?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji said indifferently, \"You can try, but I also want to say one thing. If you do try, we will never have the chance of working together. I would not want to work together with a person that wants to kill me.\"</p><p>After he said this, there was finally a bit of elemental ripples arounds Mo Wuji’s body. However, these ripples were not obvious, like those formed when a gentle breeze blew over a calm lake.</p><p>When Gong Hou heard Mo Wuji’s words, he was instantly enraged. He slowly lifted his hand; he did not attack, but instead, a green pill appeared in his palm.</p><p>\"Swallow this pill. Then I will work with you.\" With that, Gong Hou shot the pill towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not even receive it as he directly flicked the pill back, \"I don’t like working with others when my life is threatened. If Dao Friend Gong wants to carry on like this, then I will no longer be accompanying you.\"</p><p>Thereafter, Mo Wuji’s figure flashed, appearing tens of meters away.</p><p>\"The most peak grade of the Wind Escape Technique?\" Gong Hou’s thin eyes squinted even more. \"No wonder why you’re so reckless with your words, you do have some ability. Say it, what do you want to trade? How many blackstones can you give me?\"</p><p>When Mo Wuji heard Gong Hou’s words, he stopped and said calmly, \"That will depend on how many spirit stones you can provide. If you can provide stones of good enough quality or high enough quantity, I wouldn’t mind even if you fed me poison. For example, that green pill that you just took out.\"</p><p>\"Haha, interesting.\" Gong Hou chortled loudly. This was the first time seeing someone that cared so much for profit, a person who cared more about money than his life.</p><p>Seemingly knowing what Gong Hou was thinking, Mo Wuji said calmly, \"You’re right. I am that person who wants money more than my life. Let’s see whether you have the capability to make me do so.\"</p><p>\"Hong Fuji is able to provide me thousands of blackstone in a year. Now, I want 10 to 20 thousand blackstone. Do you have it?\" Gong Hou’s slitted eyes seemed to glow with sharp light as he stared straight at Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji remained emotionless as he said, \"10 to 20 thousand has its price. 80 to 100 thousand also has its price. If you only want a few thousand blackstones, I’m not really interested in this business.\"</p><p>\"What, you can get 80 to 100 thousand?\" Gong Hou who always thought that he was leading the conversation suddenly stood up. His eyes were filled with emotions. One must know that thousands of blackstones was already a huge number, what more tens of thousands? Actually every year Hong Fuji was only able to provide him 1,000 to 2,000 blackstones.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
