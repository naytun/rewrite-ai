But the actual digging itself is rather taxing, so I don't mind working with you.\"</p><p>\"If we spend the entire five days finding blackstone, how many would you be able to find?\" Jia Qi still wasn't at ease, and asked another question. As for Mo Wuji saying that digging was taxing, she directly ignored it. How could digging be easy for anyone? Moreover, Mo Wuji was in the intermediate Worldly Immortal Stage, and he didn't have the Blackstone Shovel, but he could still excavate blackstone, that was already inconceivable.</p><p>After a brief moment of contemplation, \"I'm not sure. I guess that if I'm only finding without digging, probably around 10.\"</p><p>\"Alright, now can you swear that you won't reveal what I'm telling you, then I will bring you to find that master smith,\" When Jia Qi heard that Mo Wuji could find 10 blackstone in five days, she asked directly.</p><p>Mo Wuji laughed, \"Dao Friend Jia Qi, meeting that master smith is not important to me. I'm not used to swearing. Goodbye.\"</p><p>Working with Jia Qi was really of no importance to Mo Wuji. Moreover, that smith also didn't know the functions of blackstone, so what was the point in meeting that smith? He was even asked to swear an oath then he can meet that person; he had no interest in doing so. Even if that person was an Earthly Immortal King, it would still be useless.</p><p>\"Wait, then will you reveal the matter that I tell you?\" Jia Qi clearly didn't want to give up like that.</p><p>Mo Wuji said indifferently, \"I won't, it's up to you whether or not you want to believe me. I won't swear, nor make you any promises.\"</p><p>\"Alright, I believe you,\" Jia Qi's reply came as a surprise to Mo Wuji.</p><p>Seeing Mo Wuji's surprise look, Jia Qi explained, \"A person that doesn't swear easily, is the more trustworthy person.\"</p><p>After a short pause, Jia Qi suddenly formed a sound proof barrier around them. She started to speak softly, \"That smith can create storage rings.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji stared at Jia Qi doubtfully; he had more than one storage rings on him, being able to create storage rings did not mean much to him.</p><p>Looking at Mo Wuji's expression, Jia Qi knew what was on Mo Wuji's mind. She took a step closer to Mo Wuji and whispered, \"He can create a storage ring that can store blackstone…\"</p><p>\"What?\" Mo Wuji stared at Jia Qi, this news was too staggering.</p><p>Blackstone could not be placed into storage rings, it was definitely an item that was not of this world. It was also because of this that the Half Immortal Domain wasn't afraid of blackstone being stolen.</p><p>If a person could create a storage ring that could store blackstone, the moment this news was revealed, the Half Immortal Domain would immediately eliminate that person or control that person. No wonder why Jia Qi was so cautious; Mo Wuji finally understood the reason behind Jia Qi's words.</p><p>\"I'm not lying to you, that master smith can indeed do that. And the materials used to create that ring, can be found in Half Immortal Domain,\" Jia Qi explained.</p><p>Seeing Mo Wuji's silence, Jia Qi continued, \"Perhaps you think that these blackstones might not be useful to you, and you would rather exchange them for spirit stone slags. But let me tell you, if we manage to leave Half Immortal Domain one day, and enter the true Immortal Domain, these blackstones will be of utmost use.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji naturally wouldn't think that these blackstones were useless. Honestly, if he could conceal these blackstones, he would have sent them into his storage ring a long time ago.</p><p>\"Alright, I agree. After we meet that master smith, if he can really create a storage ring which can store blackstone, we can re discuss the distribution,\" Actually, Jia Qi didn't need to explain any further. The moment Mo Wuji heard that there was a smith that could create storage rings which could contain blackstone, he would not hesitate to agree to work together with Jia Qi.</p><p>A trace of emotion flashed in Jia Qi's eyes, she nodded to Mo Wuji, \"Come, we will talk as we return.\"</p><p>\"Wait, I have six blackstone here, I will sell you five then,\" Mo Wuji pointed to the basket on his back.</p><p>\"Ok,\" Jia Qi immediately understood Mo Wuji's meaning. Since Mo Wuji intended to work with her, he would not want to reveal his ability to search for blackstone. With Mo Wuji's cultivation at the Worldly Immortal Stage, finding too many blackstones at one go was indeed out of the ordinary.</p><p>Fortunately, she had stayed in Half Immortal Domain for quite some time. It could be plausible for her to find seven blackstone if she was lucky. Actually, she had encountered such a situation before. Then, she found 12 blackstone at one go, and she managed to dig up eight blackstone.</p><p>…</p><p>The flying ship punctually stopped at Mining Area F. After Mo Wuji and Jia Qi boarded the ship, they did not discuss any further. There were too many ears on the ship; their matters were not suitable for discussion.</p><p>One day later, the flying ship stopped outside of Half Immortal Domain.</p><p>There was already a station outside of Half Immortal Domain to collect blackstone. Mo Wuji honestly entered the queue.</p><p>Mo Wuji discovered that many people had taken out over 10 blackstones at a go. There were even two that brought out 20 over blackstones. However, there were no few of those that were like him, and only had one blackstone. At the same time, Mo Wuji discovered that among those that collected over 10 blackstones, after handing over the required blackstones, they would not exchange their personal blackstones for spirit stone slags, but chose to keep the blackstone.</p><p>Keeping blackstone seemed to be accepted here. As long as you have enough blackstone, you would be allowed to take away your own blackstone.</p><p>When it got to Mo Wuji's turned, he did the same as the people in front of him. He took out his bracelet, then the one blackstone from his basket.</p><p>\"Mining Area 5109F, one blackstone, obtained five spirit stone slags,\" The cultivator collecting the blackstones took Mo Wuji's blackstone away. At the same time, he took out five spirit stone slags and handed it to Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji knew the distribution in Mining Area F was 2:3:5. That meant that for 10 spirit stone slags (one blackstone), he could obtain five spirit stone slags; Half Immortal Domain would have two, Longevity Sect would have three.</p><p>\"Can I ask whether my Longevity Sect's spirit stone slags would be handed over here?\" When Mo Wuji saw that this fella only gave him five spirit stone slags, he asked directly.</p><p>Before that fella collecting spirit stone slags could answer, a figure flashed from the side and pulled Mo Wuji away.</p><p>\"Brother Mo, you don't have to worry. Longevity Sect will receive it's share from Half Immortal Domain, you don't have to worry. I came to apologize to you…\" The person who pulled Mo Wuji away was Lang Hao, his tone was incomparably modest.</p><p>Lang Hao continued with an apologetic and serious tone, \"Because of my mistake, I forgot to pass you a Blackstone Shovel when you left. I have already brought it over to you, I promise that nothing of the like will happen again.\"</p><p>With that, Lang Hao brought a Blackstone Shovel out of nowhere and handed it to Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji laughed coldly in his heart; this fella must have seen that he had returned with a blackstone, so his attitude changed drastically. Naturally, he wouldn't be courteous as he accepted the Blackstone Shovel. He patted Lang Hao's shoulder and said, \"Dao Friend Lang is too courteous. You don't have to put this matter to heart. It was because I helped Dao Friend Jia Qi, she saw that I had worked hard, so she gave me one blackstone. If I was by myself, I wouldn't have even received one blackstone.\"</p><p>Lang Hao didn't get know whether Mo Wuji's words were true or not. He awkwardly apologised again, and hurriedly bade his farewells.</p><p>Mo Wuji couldn't be bothered about him. He intended to go to an abandoned mining area to search for blackstones after this. There, he didn't need to hand over any blackstones; all the blackstones he dug there would belong to himself.</p><p>By this time, Jia Qi had also handed over the blackstones. She did not find Mo Wuji, but swiftly left by herself. Mo Wuji did not mind, he knew that Jia Qi must definitely be off to discuss with that master smith. She should be requesting for that master smith for permission for Mo Wuji to visit him.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not have a hint of worry, he was sure that master smith would definitely agree. If Jia Qi had not revealed the master smith’s matter to him, that smith would have control. But now that this matter had already been revealed, the control was now in his hands. Unless that master smith found a person to kill him.</p><p>From this, he could see, while Jia Qi might be of a higher cultivation, her experience and wisdom could not be compared to him.</p><p>As for sending a person to kill him, Mo Wuji was not afraid despite being only at Worldly Immortal Stage Level 4. Thus, Mo Wuji did not go to Longevity Sect to find Lang Hao, but returned to his own residences to wait for Jia Qi's news.</p><p>…</p><p>In a small house fort at the outermost region of Half Immortal Domain, the black robed Jia Qi was behaving respectfully in front of a heavily bearded man.</p><p>This heavily bearded man was frowning in contemplation, seemingly digesting the news that Jia Qi had just fed him.</p><p>After half an incense's time, he sighed and said, \"Since that's the case, then I'll meet him.\"</p><p>Jia Qi heaved a sigh of relief, and spoke with guilt, \"Big Brother Pu Zi, I was too careless. I should not have revealed the matter about you.\"</p><p>The bearded man waved his hand, \"Jia Qi, this is not your fault. Even though this person’s cultivation is low, if I'm not wrong, he should be an experienced man. He played with your psychology, which caused you to impatiently reveal my existence. Only if you did that, would you have the chips to bargain with him. Anyway, what’s done cannot be undone. Just call him over then, if this person has malicious intentions, even if I die in Half Immortal Domain, I wouldn’t forge a storage ring for him.\"</p><p>…</p><p>At his own residences, Mo Wuji was still wondering over the uses of blackstone. According to his observation, blackstone seemed to contain some unfathomable energy, something that he had never seen before.</p><p>Two hours later, the restrictions that he installed outside his residences was disturbed. Mo Wuji sent his spiritual will outwards and immediately discovered that Jia Qi had arrived.</p><p>Seeing Mo Wuji walk out, Jia Qi did not enter Mo Wuji's residences, but stood outside and say, \"Dao Friend Mo, if you have nothing on, why don't you follow me for a look?\"</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
