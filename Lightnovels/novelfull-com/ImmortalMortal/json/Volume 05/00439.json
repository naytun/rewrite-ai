If not for Junior Mo, we would not even have the chance to come to this place.\"</p><p>Master Pu Zi went silent. He knew that the moment the Immortal-Traversing Ship turned back, they would be placing themselves in more than multiple times the danger.</p><p>The atmosphere within the ship got a little stifled; everyone seemed to be waiting for Master Pu Zi to make a decision.</p><p>After a whole ten breaths of time, Master Pu Zi still hadn't made a decision. A trace of disappointment flashed across Lou Chuanhe's eyes, he immediately said, \"Since that's the case, then please allow me to leave the Immortal-Traversing Ship. I want to go and look for Junior Mo.\"</p><p>Master Pu Zi inhaled a deep breath of air, his gaze swept across everyone, he solemnly said, \"Everyone, I'm unable to make this decision. Everyone should know, if we turn the ship back, it's very possible that we will plunge ourselves back into boundless Yin Fire Centipede eggs.</p><p>Moreover, there's one point that I haven't mentioned. There's many unstable elements within the Immortal Chasm. If our battleship flashes by, those elements might not even appear. But if we return, it's hard to say, because our battleship would have already alerted those things when we first passed by.\"</p><p>As he said this, Master Pu Zi paused briefly, \"That's why, I suggest that we decide this based on votes. Those who are willing to return to find Dao Friend Mo, raise your hands. Those who are unwilling, don't do anything.\"</p><p>Lou Chuanhe was the first to raise his hand up. What surprised him was that the second person was Ku Ya.</p><p>The third to raise his hand up was Kou Yuan. As he raised his hand, he also said, \"I believe that if any of us here were to fall outside, Dao Friend Mo would definitely return. Moreover, Dao Friend Mo had only fallen outside to save the battleship. If everyone doesn't agree, I'm willing to leave the battleship together with Senior Lou to find Dao Friend Mo.\"</p><p>\"I agree with Brother Kou's words.\" Abacus, Tong Ye and Jia Qi simultaneously raised their hands and said.</p><p>\"I also agree that we should return,\" Tong Cheng said faintly.</p><p>Master Pu Zi also raised his hand and said, \"Alright, then what are we waiting for. Dao Friend Tong Cheng, immediately turn the ship back. We will only stop when we find Dao Friend Mo.\"</p><p>…</p><p>After an incense's time, Mo Wuji's heart had already sank. He felt his elemental energy depleting at an increasing rate. However, he still could not see the shadow of the Immortal-Traversing Ship. At this place, not only did he have to maintain his Scholar’s Heart as defenses, he also needed to control his body to prevent it from plummeting down.</p><p>The only reason why he could persist for so long was because he had three elemental storage channels. If it was someone else, he would have long plummeted to the unknown depths of this Immortal Chasm.</p><p>However, he couldn’t carry on like this. If he couldn’t find the battleship he could only temporarily return back to Half Immortal Domain. Even though the likelihoods of him dying on his way back to Half Immortal Domain was incredibly high, Mo Wuji knew that he had no other option.</p><p>Just when Mo Wuji made this decision, a grey thing which was a little over a meter rushed towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>A pungent odour came. Mo Wuji’s mind went slightly drowsy as he immediately activated his detoxification channel to sweep the energy away.</p><p>This thing was poisonous? Mo Wuji immediately came to an understanding. He hurriedly retreated. This was a huge grey spider; there was some multi-coloured mist circling around the spider.</p><p>Mo Wuji instantly recognised that it was; it was the Immortal Domain’s Gui Water Spider [1]. Mo Wuji was rather speechless; he had barely spent half a day within the Immortal Chasm but he had already seen the Yin Fire Centipede and the Gui Water Spide. As for those invisible Colourless Leeches, he might have already encountered countless of them.</p><p>When the Gui Water Spider noticed Mo Wuji retreating, it began to charge forward with fewer restraints.</p><p>Even though Mo Wuji’s abilities had been severely affected, he would not be bullied by a simple Gui Water Spider that was less than 2 meters long. Before this Gui Water Spider reached him, Mo Wuji’s figure flashed. That multi-coloured venomous water brushed past him, and thereafter, Mo Wuji raised his hand and shot out multiple lightning swords.</p><p>These lightning swords directly pierced through the Gui Water Spider. Exploding a few columns of foul water, his lightning swords sent this Gui Water Spider into the depths of the Immortal Chasm.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not even have the time to heave a sigh of relief before he heard waves of \"Chi Chi\" sounds resounding behind him. He slowly turned his head, and when he saw the scene in front of him, his head started to go numb.</p><p>Thousands upon thousands of Gui Water Spiders rushed towards him. He could only imagine, if he was encircled by so many Gui Water Spiders, he wouldn’t be able to escape even if he had three heads and six limbs. If this was anywhere else, he could use the boundless lightning sword skill. But here, what could he use? Moreover, these Gui Water Spiders were roughly equivalent to an Earthly Immortal. Some of the bigger Gui Water Spiders were even more terrifying than Earthly immortals.</p><p>\"Run!\" Mo Wuji immediately gave up on his idea to return to Half Immortal Domain. These Gui Water Spiders had already blocked his path back, so what could he do?</p><p>Mo Wuji changed his direction. A slight breeze picked up beside him and he activated his Wind Escape Technique to the max. His entire body seemed to move like wispy cloud as he entered the depths of the Immortal Chasm.</p><p>In half an incense’s time, the Immortal-Traversing Ship appeared.</p><p>\"It’s a horde of Gui Water Spiders…\" Standing at the front of the ship, Master Pu Zi and Tong Cheng exhaled a breath of cold air. Dense numbers of Gui Water Spiders came rushing towards them.</p><p>\"Hurry, fire the cannons. Use the earthing cannons…\" At the very first instant, Ku Ya uttered the orders. Tong Ye, who was controlling the earthing cannons, did not hesitate to fire the huge cannon in his hands.</p><p>\"Boom!\" A beam of radiant yellow light shot out from the Immortal-Traversing Ship. At almost the same instant it was fired, it struck the Gui Water Spider horde.</p><p>A yellow column, which seemed to contain the power to explode a planet, rose. Thousands upon thousands of the Gui Water Spider had been shredded into pieces. Layers of multi-coloured mist formed on the Immortal Chasm.</p><p>\"So impressive…\" Everyone exhaled a breath of cold air. They never thought that the cannons on the Immortal-Traversing Ship would be so powerful. Just one shot of the cannon was able to turn those countless amounts of Gui Water Spiders into mists of water. How could it be so impressive?</p><p>Master Pu Zi said, \"Of course it’s impressive. Those years ago, Dao Lord Wu You had personally come to the Immortal Chasm. He had conducted an in depth research on the terrifying things that exist within this chasm. It was exactly because of this, that Dao Lord Wu You create these various kinds of cannon fires. The earthing cannon was the most suitable to deal with Gui Water Spiders. However, if you used the earthing cannon against Void Toads, then even a 100 of shots wouldn’t be useful. With the same logic, if you used the heavenly fire cannon against the Gui Water Spiders, it wouldn't be useless. This is the logic of opposites within the five elements.\"</p><p>\"Everyone look…\" Tong Cheng suddenly pointed at the huge monitor screen on the battleship.</p><p>The screen showed dense hordes of things swarming over, just like a black cloud moving towards them.</p><p>\"It’s Gui Water Spider, how many of them are there?\" Abacus exhaled a breath of cold air.</p><p>Master Pu Zi sighed, \"Let’s return then. Going on any further wouldn’t have any meaning.\"</p><p>No one said anything; everyone was clear that Master Pu Zi was speaking the truth. Facing such a terrifying number of Gui Water Spider, even if there had copious amounts of earthing cannons, it would be useless. Moreover, they only had two earthing cannons. After firing one, they only had one earthing cannon ammunition left.</p><p>This time, even Lou Chuanhe didn’t say a word. He knew that it wasn’t that Master Pu Zi didn’t want to save Mo Wuji, but there was truly no other means. If the Immortal-Traversing Ship were to continue to charge forward, it would only be placing everyone in danger. Moreover, with such concentrated numbers of Gui Water Spiders, even if Mo Wuji was any more impressive, he would probably have perished.</p><p>The Immortal-Traversing Ship turned back, fleeing at the fastest speed possible. That horde of Gui Water Spiders seemed to know that the Immortal-Traversing Ship had killed many of their comrades. Thus, they didn’t give up and chased the Immortal-Traversing Ship relentlessly.</p><p>…</p><p>At this instant, against expectations, Mo Wuji was completely calm. He knew that this was the only path he could take. In this place, there was no way he could return. He could only push on.</p><p>As he thought of this, he grabbed a cloth bag and tied it to his body. At the same time, he filled it with low grade immortal crystals. Out of his 3,000,000 low grade immortal crystals, he had placed over 2,000,000 of them on the Immortal-Traversing Ship. He still had roughly 500,000 to 600,000 on him.</p><p>Luckily, he still had these crystals. Otherwise, even if he had any more elemental energy, it would be depleted. He needed to constantly replenish his elemental energy, and these immortal crystals were his source of energy.</p><p>In this sort of place, he could not take out his flying treasure. Using a flying treasure might only be placing himself in further danger, and he might even be using much more elemental energy.</p><p>[1] Gui is also related to Yin.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
