  "body": "<p>The competition at Yan City Plaza had reached a fever pitch. The air crackled with excitement as cheers erupted from the crowd, igniting a fire within the competitors. Each fighter pushed themselves beyond their limits, driven by the desire to secure a spot in the coveted Zhen Mo Continent.</p>\n<p>Jiang Xiushan and Feng Zhengqiu had chosen to sidestep the issue of competition boundaries. Yet, the battles on the ten stages unfolded with an unspoken code of conduct. No cultivators at the Yuan Dan Stage dared to challenge those at the Transcending Mortality Stage, nor did any True Lake Stage cultivators take on their Yuan Dan counterparts.</p>\n<p>This was about more than pride; it was about reputation. To challenge someone significantly weaker would invite scorn from the experts of Zhen Mo Continent. The crowd’s disapproval could easily escalate into chaos.</p>\n<p>A Yuan Dan Stage cultivator might dispatch a Transcending Mortality Stage opponent in an instant, but the outcome of a single match was never guaranteed. The tides could turn in the next round, with a True Lake Stage cultivator emerging victorious.</p>\n<p>True Lake Stage cultivators under fifty were rare, but they existed. Take Feng Luojian, for instance, who had reached True Lake Stage Level 2 before hitting that age milestone.</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin stood proudly on Stage Number 1, her heart swelling with joy. At Transcending Mortality Stage Level 9, she had effortlessly defeated two opponents. One more victory would propel her into the next round.</p>\n<p>Though her cultivation level wasn’t the highest, her stunning beauty drew the loudest cheers from the audience.</p>\n<p>\"Hmm!\" Xia Mu, who had been indifferent to the competition until now, turned his gaze to Stage Number 1. Upon seeing Cen Shuyin, he found himself captivated, rising to his feet without realizing it.</p>\n<p>She was breathtaking. Even in Zhen Mo Continent, he had never encountered anyone like her. What pleased him further was her openness; she didn’t hide her ethereal beauty behind a veil.</p>\n<p>While Cen Shuyin’s talent might not rival that of Bei Suting, Xia Mu, as the star lord of Zhen Mo Continent’s Star King Mountain, felt no shame in desiring a woman he adored.</p>\n<p>The tall, red-faced man beside Xia Mu anticipated his thoughts. \"That’s Cen Shuyin, the legacy disciple of Heaven Seeking Palace’s Sword Lake. Her talent is exceptional. Heaven Seeking Palace is the top sect in Lost Continent. There’s a place called Heaven Seeking Staircase within it. I heard she reached the 54th step at Transcending Mortality Stage Level 7, placing her 50th.\"</p>\n<p>\"What’s the Heaven Seeking Staircase?\" Xia Mu asked, his brow furrowing.</p>\n<p>The red-faced man replied gravely, \"It’s no ordinary place. From my inquiries, the Heaven Seeking Staircase is a genuine ancient treasure. Even the elders of Heaven Seeking Palace are uncertain of its grade. No one has ever reached the top. The higher your cultivation, the greater the pressure. But since you’re younger than the geniuses here, I believe you can reach the top if you decide to climb it.\"</p>\n<p>Xia Mu nodded. \"Good. After this, we’ll climb the Heaven Seeking Staircase.\"</p>\n<p>The red-faced man continued, \"Even if you hadn’t asked, I would have suggested it. The origins of the Staircase are shrouded in mystery. Who knows what opportunities await at the top? I’ve heard that the higher one climbs, the more one understands cultivation and the more one achieves in the future.\"</p>\n<p>\"Not bad.\" Xia Mu’s interest piqued. \"Let’s settle on climbing the Heaven Seeking Staircase. After Cen Shuyin finishes her match, ask her to come over. I have a surprise for her.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, Sir,\" the red-faced man replied quickly.</p>\n<p>He understood the kind of surprise Xia Mu had in mind. It was the sort of surprise that only an arrogant woman like Bei Suting would refuse. For anyone else, it would be a delightful surprise.</p>\n<p>On the Heaven Seeking Staircase, Mo Wuji focused his elemental energy, intentionally forming a circulation route with his 100th and 101st meridians as he stepped onto the 99th step.</p>\n<p>The moment his foot touched the ground, a fierce pressure and swirling force surged toward him. Mo Wuji’s elemental energy erupted from his 100th and 101st meridians, pushing back against the onslaught.</p>\n<p>He advanced easily onto the 99th step, then the 100th, 101st, and 102nd steps…</p>\n<p>\"Crack!\" When he reached the 103rd step, his legs finally buckled. Though his elemental storage meridian still supplied energy, his body could no longer endure. Frustrated, he glanced up. Only five steps remained; if he could conquer them, he would stand atop the Heaven Seeking Staircase.</p>\n<p>Battling the overwhelming pressure from the 103rd step, Mo Wuji swallowed several healing pills. He began circulating his spiritual energy using the Immortal Mortal Technique to hasten his recovery.</p>\n<p>As the technique took effect, gusts of spiritual energy swirled around him, crashing into his body. The stagnation in his cultivation that had plagued him for months vanished, and his level began to rise.</p>\n<p>Determined, Mo Wuji clung to the 103rd step, absorbing spiritual energy. While standing on the Staircase, the energy felt ordinary, but once he began to draw it in, it seemed denser than that from Heaven-grade spirit stones.</p>\n<p>This energy was unlike anything he had encountered. A Heaven-grade spirit stone’s energy was dense and pure, infused with a hint of cultivation-enhancing dao. The energy here felt tailor-made for cultivation. Using the Immortal Mortal Technique in this environment was like a fish returning to water.</p>\n<p>If not for the increasingly daunting pressure, Mo Wuji would have relished the opportunity to cultivate in peace. Yet, a minute of cultivation felt like an eternity of suffering.</p>\n<p>His elemental energy crackled as it surged. Mo Wuji’s stagnant cultivation skyrocketed to the Great Circle of Transcending Mortality Stage Level 12.</p>\n<p>He suppressed his joy. He estimated that he wouldn’t need the Gold Forming Pill, and at this rate, he could break through to the Yuan Dan Stage. Still, he swallowed three Gold Forming Pills, uncertain if he could withstand the rising pressure on the 103rd step.</p>\n<p>A powerful wave of elemental energy burst forth from the pills, colliding with the surrounding spiritual energy before rushing into his 102nd meridian. The previously blocked meridian opened wide.</p>\n<p>An exhilarating emptiness flooded his body, filling him with strength and relaxation.</p>\n<p>New elemental energy flowed into the 102nd meridian, forming a circulation route with the 100th and 101st meridians. The pressure on the Staircase eased, allowing him to rise. His broken leg healed, and he stepped onto the 104th step.</p>\n<p>105th, 106th, 107th step…</p>\n<p>The pressure on the 107th step was nearly double that of the previous ones, draining the elemental energy from Mo Wuji’s three storage meridians.</p>\n<p>\"Splat!\" He collapsed on the 107th step, spitting blood and feeling streaks of crimson appear across his skin from the immense pressure.</p>\n<p>Only one step remained. He stood, swaying, and with every ounce of determination, lifted his leg onto the 108th step.</p>\n<p>On Stage Number 1 in Yan City, a man in white robes with long hair landed before Cen Shuyin. \"Great Evolution Sect’s Tao Yuan is here to spar with Junior Cen. Please make your move.\"</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin frowned, irritation bubbling within her. Heaven Seeking Palace had been overshadowed by Great Evolution Sect on both contribution points boards. As a legacy disciple of Heaven Seeking Palace’s Sword Lake, her Transcending Mortality Stage strength made it challenging to break into the Hundred Sect Alliance’s Contribution Points Board. Killing a Transcending Mortality Stage Level 9 cultivator yielded only 26 points, while a Yuan Dan Stage Level 1 could net up to 100 points.</p>\n<p>To enter the Contribution Points Board, being in the Earth Realm was essential. Not everyone was as exceptional as Rogue Cultivator 2705.</p>\n<p>A disciple from Great Evolution Sect stepped forward to challenge her. Cen Shuyin showed no mercy, her long sword transforming into a whirlwind of sword qi aimed at Tao Yuan.</p>\n<p>Waves of sword qi crashed against the stage, creating a scene reminiscent of a tempestuous sea. Most would expect Tao Yuan to retreat, but he charged forward, elemental energy swirling around him.</p>\n<p>When the sword waves struck his glowing barrier, explosions of elemental energy erupted, dissipating into the air. It was clear that Tao Yuan’s defensive energy was a specialized skill.</p>\n<p>Experts in sword dao sensed the tension. If Cen Shuyin couldn’t break through Tao Yuan’s defense, defeat was inevitable.</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin understood this too. Her expression hardened. This defensive skill seemed designed to counter sword arts. Unless her sword waves surpassed Tao Yuan’s elemental barrier, breaking through would be a challenge.</p>\n<p>\"I’m sorry, Junior Cen. I can’t grant you the slot for entering Zhen Mo Continent,\" Tao Yuan’s voice, laced with amusement, reached her ears. He raised a long whip, clearly intending to provoke her.</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin scoffed. \"Wait until you’ve won before you start spouting nonsense.\"</p>\n<p>With that, her hands wove intricate seals. Streams of elemental energy coalesced in her palms, crackling with power.</p>",
