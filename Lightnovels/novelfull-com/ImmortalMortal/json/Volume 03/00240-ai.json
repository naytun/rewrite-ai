  "body": "<p>Mo Wuji's flying ship sliced through the air, its speed unmatched. Yet, behind him, Cen Shuyin pursued relentlessly. He spotted her soon after leaving Heaven Seeking City, her ship a dark silhouette against the sky.</p>\n<p>At first, he thought he was being chased by Lei Clan dogs. He contemplated retrieving a laser cannon, ready to fire a warning shot. But as he focused, he realized the ship was under Cen Shuyin's control. She stood at the stern, her figure unmistakable.</p>\n<p>Curiosity gnawed at him. What could she possibly want? He doubted she recognized him as Rogue Cultivator 2705. Their brief interaction during the application for a contribution point token had been just that—brief. She had merely facilitated the process; she couldn’t have seen the details on his token. Unless, of course, she possessed a spiritual will as strong as his.</p>\n<p>It was even less likely she could identify him as Mo Wuji. The disguising mask Ren Tianxing had given him was effective. With her cultivation level, she shouldn't be able to see through it.</p>\n<p>So why was she after him?</p>\n<p>An hour passed, and seeing that Cen Shuyin showed no signs of relenting, Mo Wuji landed his ship in a nearby forest. She followed suit, her ship touching down not far away. With determination, she approached him. \"May I ask if you're Rogue Cultivator 2705?\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji's voice was slightly hoarse as he replied, \"That's right. Why are you looking for me?\"</p>\n<p>A spark of surprise lit up Cen Shuyin's eyes. \"I'm Cen Shuyin from Heaven Seeking Palace Sword Lake. Because—\"</p>\n<p>\"Because we want to know if the rumors are true.\" A voice cut through her words, sharp and sudden.</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin turned, her expression shifting to one of alarm as she recognized the black-robed youth. \"Gu Shaoyin?\"</p>\n<p>He nodded, a smirk playing on his lips. \"That's right. Now step aside and let me take over.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji's frown deepened as he glanced between Cen Shuyin and Gu Shaoyin. He hadn’t expected her to summon him only to join forces with this newcomer. Yet, he felt no fear. Gu Shaoyin, also in the Extreme Mortal Stage, was strong, but Mo Wuji sensed a weakness in his spirit ring—it was unclear and feeble compared to his own.</p>\n<p>Gu Shaoyin clasped his fists, addressing Mo Wuji. \"Star King Mountain's Gu Shaoyin. You are the Rogue Cultivator 2705 whose name echoes across the Lost Continent?\"</p>\n<p>Wonder filled Gu Shaoyin's heart. Mo Wuji appeared unremarkable, lacking any aura of a powerful cultivator. He couldn’t fathom that this pale scholar was the infamous Rogue Cultivator 2705. Discontent brewed within him; back in Zhen Mo Continent, he had bested countless experts, reigning supreme on the Mortal Board. Yet here, Rogue Cultivator 2705 was a name even the common folk knew.</p>\n<p>\"That's right. Why do you seek me?\" Mo Wuji met Gu Shaoyin's gaze, calm and steady. He sensed the strength radiating from Gu Shaoyin, who was also in the Transcending Mortality Stage.</p>\n<p>\"Then accept my punch. Let’s see if you truly deserve the title of Rogue Cultivator 2705…\" Gu Shaoyin launched a punch toward Mo Wuji, his interest in using a spear fading.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji stood firm, his own fist flying forward. He had little regard for other cultivators at his level. His spiritual will began scanning the area, wary of any hidden threats.</p>\n<p>\"Bang!\" The collision of their fists sent shockwaves through the air, a deafening roar echoing as elemental energy exploded around them.</p>\n<p>\"Bam!\" Their fists met with a force that cracked the earth beneath them, debris scattering in all directions. Mo Wuji felt the jarring impact reverberate through his bones, one fracturing under the strain. Gu Shaoyin's elemental energy surged, relentless, as if it would not cease until it had crushed Mo Wuji into the ground.</p>\n<p>A tremor of fear coursed through Mo Wuji. He had never encountered such a formidable opponent in the Transcending Mortality Stage. Gu Shaoyin had yet to reach the Yuan Dan Stage, but the intensity of his energy ignited Mo Wuji's fighting spirit.</p>\n<p>No matter the realm, this was a challenge worthy of his full effort.</p>\n<p>Elemental energy surged through his channels, flooding into his fist. He unleashed it with abandon, a torrent of power aimed at Gu Shaoyin.</p>\n<p>\"Crack crack…\" Gu Shaoyin's bones shattered under the pressure. Yet, the force sent Mo Wuji flying, his feet rooted to the ground.</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin, watching from a distance, was pushed back by the explosive energy, stumbling several meters away.</p>\n<p>\"Peng!\" Gu Shaoyin landed, his feet carving deep grooves into the earth as he steadied himself. He stared at Mo Wuji, the disdain in his eyes replaced by seriousness and respect.</p>\n<p>After a moment, he drew his spear. \"You're strong. I take back what I thought. You are the only Transcending Mortality cultivator worth my utmost effort.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji summoned the Tian Ji Pole into his palm, intrigued by Gu Shaoyin's willingness to reconsider. Perhaps he would spare this one.</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin watched in disbelief. Both were Transcending Mortality Stage cultivators? Why did their battle seem more impressive than those she had witnessed between Yuan Dan Stage cultivators?</p>\n<p>In that moment, she realized Gu Shaoyin had only shown a fraction of his power during their earlier confrontation. Now, he was revealing his true strength.</p>\n<p>She inhaled sharply. Gu Shaoyin's might was staggering, but Mo Wuji's effortless display of power left her breathless. If anyone had claimed his contributions were mere luck, she would have dismissed it. But now, she understood the truth.</p>\n<p>\"Chi chi…\" Gu Shaoyin's spear sliced through the air, sending waves of killing intent toward Mo Wuji. The atmosphere thickened, each breath becoming a struggle.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji recognized the strength behind Gu Shaoyin's attack. It reminded him of the pressure he had felt when Honest Qi had trapped him in space. A mere Transcending Mortality cultivator was exerting the same unbearable weight.</p>\n<p>His elemental energy surged, and he swung the Tian Ji Pole, unleashing trails of invisible sword qi.</p>\n<p>\"Boom!\" The clash of their powers sent a shockwave through the area, dust swirling around them. Gu Shaoyin's spear arts held the upper hand, and despite Mo Wuji's elemental energy, he found himself at a disadvantage.</p>\n<p>Gu Shaoyin stood tall, calm and collected. \"If you had a pole art, I wouldn't be your opponent. But now, you are not my equal. Prepare to face my Surface Slicing Spear Shadow…\"</p>\n<p>With a swift motion, he raised his spear, shadows forming around him, enveloping Mo Wuji in a deadly embrace. No matter where he turned, the spear shadows threatened to slice him apart.</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin's heart sank. Though her abilities paled in comparison, she recognized the truth. Rogue Cultivator 2705 was stronger than Gu Shaoyin, yet lacked the skills to match his prowess.</p>\n<p>She pondered the hardships Mo Wuji must have faced to reach this level. In a sect, a simple pole art would have been a given. But he had forged his path alone, and while others saw only his glory, she glimpsed the struggles that had shaped him. Today, she witnessed it all.</p>",
