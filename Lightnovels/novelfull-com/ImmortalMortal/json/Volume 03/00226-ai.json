  "body": "<p>Mo Wuji ignored Jing Gumu's presence, his focus unwavering. \"Everyone, follow my elemental energy circulation path to transfer elemental energy while you wait for me,\" he instructed, his voice steady.</p>\n<p>He had long understood that the Revolving Star Passage Technique was a sacred art, even without Jing Gumu's reminder. Pu Qian and the others, without needing further prompting, began to channel their elemental energy according to Mo Wuji's technique, enhancing the energy for the Revolving Star Passage Technique. This alleviated much of the pressure on Mo Wuji.</p>\n<p>With a swift motion, he ignited the Boundless Lightning Rain, directing it fiercely toward Jing Gumu. The room transformed into a battleground, one half engulfed in swirling black sword shadows, the other crackling with blue lightning.</p>\n<p>\"Stop…\" The residual soul of Jing Gumu quivered in panic. The threat of being reduced to ashes loomed large, extinguishing any hope of reincarnation.</p>\n<p>But Mo Wuji had no intention of halting. The lightning rain intensified, each bolt a testament to his resolve. In the heat of battle, he spoke no unnecessary words; all discussions would wait until the enemy lay defeated.</p>\n<p>As Jing Gumu's shadow began to fade, a brilliant golden light erupted from the spiritual vein beneath the bed. Suddenly, the sword rain garrote array that had ensnared them vanished, leaving Mo Wuji's expression darkened. Two possibilities raced through his mind: the aftereffects of battling a formidable foe or Jing Gumu's escape.</p>\n<p>\"Head senior brother, did we kill the residual soul?\" Zhuang Yan's voice broke the silence, her eyes scanning the now quiet room.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji shook his head. \"No, that fella must have had a supreme top-grade escape magic treasure. He slipped away just as I was about to finish him off. I suspect he’s left with only a breath of life and will need to seek permission from the heavens to return for cultivation.\"</p>\n<p>\"At least he didn’t have time to take anything with him,\" Mo Wuji said, moving to collect two storage rings. The items the Tian Ji Sect had gathered were improving with each step toward rebuilding.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping let out a breath of relief. \"We were lucky to survive an encounter with a True God expert and even kill one. No one would believe us if this rumor spread.\"</p>\n<p>Suddenly, a thought struck her. \"Head senior brother, was the black-clothed man chasing Granny Linglong an alien cultivator? If so, we could earn a massive amount of contribution points...\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji quickly retrieved his points accumulation jade token, his eyes widening at the number displayed.</p>\n<p>Rogue Cultivator 2705, Contribution Points: 112,076, Ranking: 1st.</p>\n<p>The back of the token showed he had already spent over 10,000 points, contributing to his ranking among cultivators.</p>\n<p>\"Rank number 1... My god…\" Sang Yiping gasped, her eyes wide as she processed the information.</p>\n<p>\"Head senior brother, you really are Rogue Cultivator 2705!\" Pu Qian exclaimed, realization dawning on him. Though he had never visited Yan City, he had heard tales of the legendary figure, a god-like character in the eyes of many cultivators.</p>\n<p>Zhuang Yan shared in the shock and excitement, realizing the legendary Rogue Cultivator stood right beside her, now their head senior brother. The rumors surrounding 2705 would only grow more fearsome. What kind of strength must one possess to top the Hundred Sect Contribution Points Board with over 100,000 points?</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji pondered aloud, \"My luck must be extraordinary to have killed a True God Stage Level 1 expert and gained over 100,000 points. Just imagine the treasures we could acquire with that.\"</p>\n<p>At the contribution points exchange center, a board displayed the points awarded for each alien cultivator killed. The highest level listed was for Nihility God Stage Level 9. Mo Wuji now understood he would earn 100,000 points for defeating a True God expert.</p>\n<p>He tucked the jade token away. \"We’ll exchange these points when we return to Yan City. For now, everyone, check the jade vases for more pills.\"</p>\n<p>The house, once orderly, now lay in disarray. Mo Wuji’s lightning rain and the sword rain garrote array had shattered many vases, leaving a trail of broken pottery.</p>\n<p>Following Mo Wuji's command, they began to gather the fallen vases.</p>\n<p>\"I found a vase of Earth Yuan Pill…\"</p>\n<p>\"A True Position Pill…\"</p>\n<p>\"I discovered a Jaded Spiritual Pill, a Tier 6 spiritual pill!\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah… a vase of Gold Forming Pill!\"</p>\n<p>Pu Qian's discovery captivated everyone. Though the Gold Forming Pill was only a Tier 4 pill, it held immense value. It was the key to advancing from the Transcending Mortality Stage of the Mortal Realm to the Yuan Dan Stage of the Earth Realm. Its spiritual herbs were rare and costly, and the pill itself was notoriously difficult to concoct.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji rushed over, taking the vase from Pu Qian's hands. \"You’re right; this is indeed the Gold Forming Pill. Now, everyone, report your cultivation levels.\"</p>\n<p>\"I’m at Transcending Mortality Stage Level 7!\" Pu Qian declared first.</p>\n<p>\"I’m at Transcending Mortality Stage Level 4,\" Nie Zhengnong followed.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping added, \"I’m only at Transcending Mortality Stage Level 1.\"</p>\n<p>\"I’m at Spirit Building Stage Level 7,\" Zhuang Yan chimed in.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji nodded. \"I’m at Transcending Mortality Stage Level 12…\"</p>\n<p>The four stared at him, mouths agape. Transcending Mortality Stage Level 12? Was there even such a level?</p>\n<p>\"Head senior brother, are you saying you’re in the Extreme Mortal Stage?\" Sang Yiping finally asked, astonished.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, I am in the Extreme Mortal Stage,\" Mo Wuji confirmed, the traces of spirituality within him invisible to others.</p>\n<p>Pu Qian and the others inhaled sharply. Extreme Mortal Stage? It explained Mo Wuji's strength. They had heard of cultivators reaching Level 10 in a single stage but never of anyone achieving the Extreme Realm. Their head senior brother was truly exceptional.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping, still in disbelief, asked, \"But doesn’t the Extreme Realm only have 10 levels? Why is there a Level 12?\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji shook his head. \"I’ve had no mentor. I’ve navigated this path alone, learning through occasional conversations. As for reaching Level 12, I’m as puzzled as you.\"</p>\n<p>Everyone shared his confusion, unsure why he had attained such a level.</p>\n<p>\"Head senior brother, your potential is immense. Tian Ji Sect’s future looks bright under your leadership,\" Nie Zhengnong said, excitement bubbling within him.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping stood firm. \"This news about head senior brother being in the Extreme Mortal Stage must remain secret. Otherwise, it will hinder Tian Ji Sect's growth.\"</p>\n<p>Everyone nodded in agreement.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji added, \"Sang Yiping is right. A sect's strength relies on both its legacy and its actual power. I asked everyone to report their levels to remind you of your own cultivation. The True Position Pill is perfect for Transcending Mortality cultivation, and we have the Gold Forming Pill to help advance to Yuan Dan Stage. I’ll gather the spiritual energy from the vein, and I believe everyone will soon advance to the next realm.\"</p>\n<p>\"Great,\" Pu Qian agreed eagerly. He had worked hard to reach his current level and had never encountered such favorable conditions for cultivation. Joining Tian Ji Sect had been the best decision he made.</p>\n<p>Noticing Zhuang Yan's slight disappointment, Mo Wuji handed her a vase. \"These are Transcending Mortality Pills to help you advance to the Transcending Mortality Stage and then to the Yuan Dan Stage.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, head senior brother!\" Zhuang Yan beamed, grateful for his assistance.</p>\n<p>Quickly, they divided the pills, tidied the house, and found spots to settle.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji set up an energy gathering array to draw in spiritual energy from both the vein and the outdoors. In no time, the room filled with a dense surge of spiritual energy.</p>\n<p>He sat down, beginning to absorb the energy, hoping to break into the Yuan Dan Stage. Power was everything, a lesson he had learned deeply during this journey.</p>\n<p>The concentrated spiritual energy flowed toward them, and Mo Wuji’s absorption rate was astonishing. Soon, the room fell silent once more.</p>\n<p>In Yan City, a crowd of cultivators gathered before the Hundred Sect Alliance Contribution Points Board. They stared in disbelief at the new name occupying the top rank, someone they recognized yet never expected to see there.</p>\n<p>Rogue Cultivator 2705, Contribution Points: 112,076, Ranking: 1st.</p>\n<p>Xi Yixuan of the Great Evolution Sect, once ranked first, now stood second with only 57,208 points—less than half of Rogue Cultivator 2705’s total. Feng Luojian, in third place, had barely 50,000 points.</p>\n<p>A Rogue Cultivator overshadowing both the Heaven Seeking Palace and the Great Evolution Sect was a disgrace for the two sects. Even worse, his points alone surpassed the combined totals of the second and third ranks.</p>",
