  "body": "<p>Mo Wuji stood on the deck, his heart racing as he finally grasped the true destructiveness of the cannons. A chill ran down his spine. Even the Three-eyed Dhuta might be powerless against them. These cannons, he suspected, were not of the Lost Continent. They had likely descended from another planet, a terrifying thought. If they fell into the hands of a madman, it would spell disaster. With such formidable firepower, he wouldn’t even need to bring the ship to confront the Yu Lin Lei Clan. One cannon could obliterate them.</p>\n<p>“Everyone, get down from the cannon forts. These cannons are too powerful; we cannot reveal them,” Mo Wuji commanded, his voice steady but urgent.</p>\n<p>“Yes, head senior brother,” the four replied in unison. The presence of such a powerful battleship, armed with those incredible cannons, ignited a spark of hope within Tian Ji Sect. Morale surged.</p>\n<p>Once the four had disembarked, Mo Wuji raised his hand, storing the battleship in his ring.</p>\n<p>“Head senior brother, how many alien cultivators do you think we just killed?” Sang Yiping asked eagerly, her eyes sparkling with curiosity.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji retrieved his contribution point token, a frown creasing his brow. “You all don’t have a contribution point token, so the points might actually go to me.”</p>\n<p>As he examined the token, disbelief washed over him. Sang Yiping and the others gathered around, their expressions mirroring his shock.</p>\n<p>“We killed at least 10,000 alien cultivators, right? Why are the points still at 112,076? We didn’t earn a single point?” Sang Yiping lamented, frustration evident in her voice.</p>\n<p>All eyes turned to Mo Wuji. He pondered the point system, then spoke slowly, “I guess those cannons are so powerful that they disintegrated the souls of the alien cultivators into nothingness. That’s why the token didn’t record any points.”</p>\n<p>“At least head senior brother is still number one. Otherwise, I would really be unhappy,” Sang Yiping replied, though her tone suggested she still struggled to accept the explanation. The fact that Mo Wuji remained at the top provided her with some comfort.</p>\n<p>“Let’s move towards the battle and gather news on this war,” Mo Wuji said, his mind racing. He was less concerned about the contribution points and more about whether to bring his companions back to rebuild Tian Ji Sect or to leave altogether.</p>\n<p>If the alien cultivators defeated the Hundred Sect Alliance, no amount of cannon power would stop the overwhelming tide of enemies. If word of his cannons reached them, they wouldn’t come looking for him with mere flying ships.</p>\n<p>A bleak silence enveloped Yin Tomb Beach. The black-haired, white-bearded man stood on the ground, his hands empty, not even wielding a magic treasure. Beneath him lay the lifeless bodies of several True God experts, their breaths extinguished.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, an alien True God expert, positioned far from the black-haired man, dashed toward the flying ship hovering above. The cultivators of the Hundred Sect Alliance finally reacted. They realized the alien cultivators intended to take the people aboard the ship hostage, knowing the black-haired man’s power.</p>\n<p>Everyone’s gaze fixed on the black-haired man, expecting him to rush to the flying ship’s aid. But to their confusion, he strolled calmly toward the battlefield’s center, seemingly oblivious to the True God expert’s sneak attack.</p>\n<p>“Bang!” A powerful surge of elemental energy erupted, and the figure of the alien True God expert was hurled from the flying ship, crashing hard onto the ground.</p>\n<p>The alien True God, though injured, was not dead. The sight left the entire Yin Tomb Beach in shock. Even the ten aboard the flying ship had dispatched a True God expert in an instant. Clearly, they were not to be trifled with.</p>\n<p>Where did these experts come from? What were they doing here?</p>\n<p>Regardless of their origins, the Hundred Sect Alliance felt a surge of hope. Bei Suting waved her hand, signaling everyone to retreat behind her.</p>\n<p>In this war, the Hundred Sect Alliance had suffered heavy losses, over a hundred thousand cultivators, including five True God experts. It was a devastating blow to their strength. Initially, she had intended to lead the remaining survivors into a desperate fight against the alien cultivators. But now, with the appearance of this ship, a glimmer of hope flickered.</p>\n<p>Before she could fully comprehend the situation, she focused on recovering from her injuries, waiting for the right moment.</p>\n<p>Garber approached the black-haired man, his face pale. He bowed deeply, clasping his fists. “Floating Star’s Garber greets senior. I didn’t know you were passing by. I seek your understanding regarding our mistakes.”</p>\n<p>The Hundred Sect Alliance cultivators exchanged cold glances. This was the weight of power. Before the black-haired man’s arrival, Garber had attacked without hesitation. Now, he wore a forced smile, masking his fear as he apologized.</p>\n<p>The black-haired man’s voice was cold. “You’re from the Floating Star. Why are you here?”</p>\n<p>Garber’s heart raced. “If senior likes this place, I will withdraw immediately and leave it to you.”</p>\n<p>The black-haired man chuckled, though his expression remained icy. “Do you think I need your Floating Star’s permission to stay here? I’ve been on this land for hundreds of years.”</p>\n<p>Garber’s mind raced. His Floating Star had been campaigning on the Lost Continent for two to three years. When had such a powerful expert emerged?</p>\n<p>The Hundred Sect Alliance cultivators felt a surge of excitement. They hadn’t anticipated such a supreme expert hiding on the Lost Continent. This individual alone could annihilate the alien cultivators.</p>\n<p>Realization struck Garber like a cold wave. He bowed again, panic evident. “Forgive me, senior. We will retreat immediately. We won’t set foot here again.”</p>\n<p>The black-haired man chuckled once more, “You think you can come and go as you please? This isn’t your backyard.”</p>\n<p>With that, he raised his hand and struck Garber with a swift slap.</p>\n<p>Garber saw the blow coming, but even with his True God Stage Level 3 cultivation, he couldn’t evade it.</p>\n<p>“Pfff!” Garber was reduced to a mist of blood before everyone’s eyes.</p>\n<p>“Dared to trespass on my land. Complete annihilation.” After dispatching Garber, the black-haired man soared into the air, gathering a vast killing intent that he hurled toward the over a hundred thousand alien cultivators. The sheer force of his aura compelled many to kneel.</p>\n<p>Complete annihilation. Those words echoed ominously.</p>\n<p>The alien cultivators erupted into chaos, desperate to flee. Whether they could fly or not, they fell beneath the black-haired man’s power. Each wave of his hand claimed countless lives. In mere moments, over a hundred thousand cultivators were slain.</p>\n<p>True God experts and Spirit Building Stage cultivators alike were nothing but ants beneath his might.</p>\n<p>The Hundred Sect Alliance stood frozen, awestruck. Even if they had ten times the number of alien cultivators, it wouldn’t be enough to withstand him.</p>\n<p>Bei Suting rallied her comrades. “Let’s join in the killing.”</p>\n<p>The alien cultivators had lost all will to fight. The Hundred Sect Alliance surged forward, and within moments, no alien cultivators remained on Yin Tomb Beach.</p>\n<p>The ground was littered with corpses, a grim reminder of the slaughter that had unfolded in less than an hour. In the previous battle, the alien cultivators had managed to resist. But now, they were utterly helpless. This was no longer a war; it was a one-sided massacre.</p>\n<p>“Lost Continent, Heaven Seeking Palace’s Bei Suting greets senior. Thank you for your assistance, allowing my Lost Continent’s cultivators a chance to survive,” she said, bowing deeply before the black-haired man.</p>\n<p>His gaze swept over Bei Suting and the survivors from the Hundred Sect Alliance. He shook his head, sighing. “Cultivation is too low, talent is also too low…”</p>\n<p>Bei Suting fell silent. If anyone else had said her talent was lacking, she wouldn’t have cared. But the black-haired man’s words struck a chord, making her question her abilities.</p>\n<p>“I’m not talking about you. I’m referring to these cultivators. Yours is still acceptable,” he added, noticing her slight despondency and offering a small consolation.</p>\n<p>Among the tens of thousands of survivors, including the Great Evolution Sect Head, no one dared to speak. With such an expert present, even a mere breath from him could obliterate them.</p>\n<p>“May I ask if senior is a hidden Heaven Realm expert of our Lost Continent?” Bei Suting inquired reverently. This was a pressing concern. If these experts weren’t from the Lost Continent, what were their intentions in annihilating the alien cultivators?</p>\n<p>The black-haired man shook his head. “We’re from the same planet, but not the same continent. We hail from the Zhen Mo Continent. As for our motives, we’ll discuss them later.”</p>\n<p>“Senior traversed the Five Elements Desolate Domain to reach here?” Bei Suting’s understanding deepened. The black-haired man’s strength made sense; he was from the Zhen Mo Continent. Many in the five empires were unaware of it, but she was not. The journey across the Five Elements Desolate Domain was a daunting task for a Lost Continent cultivator.</p>\n<p>The black-haired man nodded. “That’s correct. This time, I hope to enhance the abilities of the Lost Continent. Otherwise, every time alien cultivators arrive, we’ll have to make that arduous journey. It would tire us out.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, senior.” Bei Suting felt her caution dissipate, replaced by a burning anticipation.</p>\n<p>As the first dean of the Heaven Seeking Palace, her goal was to nurture the strongest cultivators of the Lost Continent. Yet, in reality, her power was only enough to defend against a few others at the True God Realm.</p>",
