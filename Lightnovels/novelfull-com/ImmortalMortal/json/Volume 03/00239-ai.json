  "body": "<p>Mo Wuji stood in the dimly lit room, the door clicking shut behind Pu Qian. He gestured for everyone to take a seat, his brow furrowed with concern. \"What’s going on? Why does everyone look so relieved to see me?\"</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping, ever the first to speak, leaned forward. \"Head senior brother, we followed your instructions to investigate the Nine Moons Pill House in secret.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji's heart raced. \"No news?\" His voice was edged with urgency. Since parting ways with Zhen Shaoke and the others, he had thrown himself into his cultivation, tirelessly opening his meridians and searching for spiritual herbs. Just when he thought he could finally catch his breath, the aliens had invaded.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping nodded, her expression serious. \"Three months ago, a deacon named Fei Bingzhu came to Heaven Seeking City. He bought a store at a high price. With the war against the alien cultivators, many merchants fled to Yan City, making prices drop. Fei Bingzhu seized the opportunity.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji's excitement bubbled up. \"Where's the store?\"</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping's sigh was heavy. \"The Nine Moons Pill House had just finished furnishing. It hadn’t even opened before it was destroyed in a single night. Deacon Fei was killed, along with Treasurer Sun Jingyi.\"</p>\n<p>A chill swept through Mo Wuji. His fists clenched, heart pounding. Fei Bingzhu had been there during his struggles, a beacon of support. To think he had met such a fate in Heaven Seeking City was unbearable.</p>\n<p>\"Who did it? Did you find out?\" Mo Wuji's voice was low, a promise of vengeance simmering beneath the surface.</p>\n<p>Pu Qian spoke up. \"It was the Yu Lin Lei Clan. That’s why I insisted Junior Sang and the others stay here.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji cursed inwardly. The Yu Lin Lei Clan again. It all made sense now. Their anxiety was justified; if they discovered his presence, they would not hesitate to act.</p>\n<p>He pieced together the clues. Hou Yucheng had revealed his identity at the auction; the Yu Lin Lei Clan would have easily traced that back to him. As an outer disciple of the Heaven Seeking Palace, he was vulnerable. They had already targeted Hou Yucheng, a mere inner disciple. What chance did he stand?</p>\n<p>\"Have the Yu Lin Lei Clan’s men left?\" Mo Wuji's mind raced with strategies.</p>\n<p>\"After the Nine Moons Pill House was destroyed, they took over the store. I checked; it’s already being refurbished and will open soon,\" Pu Qian replied.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji nodded, determination hardening within him. He would annihilate the Yu Lin Lei Clan before he even thought of rebuilding the Tian Ji Sect. His power was still insufficient, but he would not delay. The Nine Moons Pill House and Zhen Shaoke’s lives were at stake.</p>\n<p>\"Yiping, are there any cultivator cities near Tian Ji Sect?\" Mo Wuji shifted his focus.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping responded quickly. \"There’s a small town called Heaven's Gate Town nearby. It wasn’t bustling, but merchants frequented it. Now, with the Tian Ji Sect destroyed, it should be deserted.\"</p>\n<p>Her voice was soft, tinged with sorrow. The destruction of the Tian Ji Sect meant the end of years of development for Heaven’s Gate Town. The surrounding bandits would surely ravage it.</p>\n<p>\"Pu Qian, refine this flying car immediately. Once you’re done, take Yiping, Zhuang Yan, and Nie Zhengnong to Heaven's Gate Town and wait for me,\" Mo Wuji ordered, his tone brooking no argument.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping's eyes widened. \"Head senior brother, you…\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji cut her off. \"I need to stay here. I’ll wait for the right moment to strike at the Yu Lin Lei Clan's store.\"</p>\n<p>\"Head senior brother, the alien war is over. Things are different now. Heaven Seeking City is close to the Heaven Seeking Palace. If you destroy a store, it could cause a stir,\" Nie Zhengnong cautioned, his voice steady.</p>\n<p>Pu Qian understood Mo Wuji's resolve. \"If that’s the case, we’ll stay behind with you. We’ll leave as soon as we finish.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji shook his head. \"This is my personal matter. It’s better if I handle it alone. The less involvement, the better.\"</p>\n<p>His intent was clear. He wasn’t just going to destroy the Yu Lin Lei Clan members occupying the Nine Moons Pill House's store; he intended to wipe them off the face of the Lost Continent. The thought ignited a fierce killing intent within him.</p>\n<p>Seeing his determination, Pu Qian and the others fell silent.</p>\n<p>With Mo Wuji’s spiritual will guiding him, Pu Qian refined the flying car in just two hours. They checked out of the inn and left Heaven Seeking City.</p>\n<p>Two hours later, they reached the outskirts. Pu Qian pulled out the flying car. As he gestured for the others to board, he asked, \"What if the Tian Shang princes come looking for trouble?\"</p>\n<p>\"Kill them,\" Mo Wuji replied without hesitation. The Tian Ji Sect would not cower before the Ming Han Empire. He had no doubt they wouldn’t dare cause trouble over two princes.</p>\n<p>His words resonated with Sang Yiping and the others. The once-tolerant Tian Ji Sect was no more.</p>\n<p>\"If there are any survivors from the Tian Ji Sect, bring them back,\" he added, his voice firm. He believed the Yu Lin Lei Clan wouldn’t leave guards at the Tian Ji Sect after their destruction.</p>\n<p>Once Pu Qian and the others were safely in the flying car, Mo Wuji altered his appearance to that of the pale-faced Rogue Cultivator 2705 and re-entered Heaven Seeking City. He settled into a small inn, remaining there for three days.</p>\n<p>He had his reasons. He needed to ensure Pu Qian and the others were far away, find a retreat path, and assess the strength of the Lei Clan's store.</p>\n<p>As he suspected, the Yu Lin Lei Clan had only assigned two Transcending Mortality Stage cultivators as defenders, with the rest being Spirit Building and Channel Opening cultivators.</p>\n<p>Three days later, Mo Wuji checked out of the inn and walked boldly toward the Lei Clan’s store.</p>\n<p>\"Apologies, friend. Our store isn’t open yet,\" a Channel Opening Stage cultivator said, stepping in front of him.</p>\n<p>\"Are you a Lei Clan disciple?\" Mo Wuji asked suddenly.</p>\n<p>The cultivator puffed out his chest. \"Yes! Our Lei Clan Merchant House is all Lei Clan disciples. You can rest assured, but I must ask you to leave until we open.\"</p>\n<p>\"Get out of here!\" Mo Wuji’s hand shot out, slapping the cultivator. He flew back, crashing against the wall, lifeless.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji inhaled deeply. He hated resorting to violence, but this was the path he had chosen. The attendant may not have been responsible for the deaths of the Nine Moons Pill House or Tian Ji Sect, but he had to pay the price for Mo Wuji’s journey.</p>\n<p>\"Who dares cause trouble at my Lei Clan?\" Shadows erupted from the store, surrounding him.</p>\n<p>\"Rogue Cultivator 2705. The one you seek, here for revenge,\" he declared. Invisible Sword Qi materialized in his hand, forming a net that ensnared the cultivators. Today, he sought not only vengeance for Fei Bingzhu but also for the Tian Ji Sect and its fallen head.</p>\n<p>The strongest among them was merely at Transcending Mortality Stage Level 3, a mere child compared to Mo Wuji’s power.</p>\n<p>Blood fog swirled as he unleashed his fury. In ten minutes, seven or eight Lei Clan disciples lay dead, their souls wandering.</p>\n<p>An hour later, Mo Wuji left Heaven Seeking City, alert and ready. The destruction of the Lei Clan store was just the beginning. Now, he would wipe out the entire Yu Lin Lei Clan.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Cen Shuyin left Yan City, unaware of the eyes that followed her. She piloted a crude flying ship toward Heaven Seeking Palace, having traded her flying car for Mo Wuji's Lightning Flash from the alien battlefield.</p>\n<p>Though the ship was unrefined, it was faster than her previous vehicle. In a few days, she reached the outskirts of Heaven Seeking City.</p>\n<p>As she scanned the area, her heart skipped. There was Mo Wuji, leaving the city.</p>\n<p>\"Rogue Cultivator 2705?\" Cen Shuyin had never seen him, but she had heard countless tales. In Yan City, his pale face was infamous, his likeness sold in portraits everywhere.</p>\n<p>Could it be? Her heart raced with excitement. She had to inform Rogue Cultivator 2705 of what she knew.</p>",
