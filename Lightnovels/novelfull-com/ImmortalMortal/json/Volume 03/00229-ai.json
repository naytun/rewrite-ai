  "body": "<p>Garber's expression shifted, a flicker of regret crossing his face. He had spoken too freely. The mention of Bei Suting, the First Dean of the Heaven Seeking Palace, had instantly bolstered the morale of the opposing force. He needed to act quickly, to dampen their spirits before the battle commenced. The stakes were high; the Floating Star could face devastating losses if they didn't act decisively.</p>\n<p>In the air, a woman with a scarf obscuring her features stood at the forefront of the two armies. Her silhouette was slender and graceful, a true femme fatale. Ignoring Garber's words, she addressed the cultivators of the Hundred Sect Alliance, her voice ringing clear and strong. \"These alien scum have invaded our homeland. How will we respond?\"</p>\n<p>\"Kill!\" The response was thunderous, a chorus of voices rising in unison.</p>\n<p>\"They have slain our brothers and sisters, and now they expect us to kneel. What will we do?\"</p>\n<p>\"Kill!\" The fervor in their voices intensified, a wave of courage washing over them.</p>\n<p>Even the calmest among them felt their blood boil, the urge to charge into battle overwhelming.</p>\n<p>\"What are we waiting for? Follow me! Kill them all!\"</p>\n<p>\"Kill! Kill! Kill!\"</p>\n<p>The pent-up rage exploded, sweeping through the ranks of the Hundred Sect Alliance like a tidal wave. They surged forward, fierce as tigers, ready to unleash their wrath upon the alien invaders.</p>\n<p>Garber realized he had lost the battle for morale. With no other options, he turned to his own troops. \"Cultivators of the Floating Star, do you wish to return to that forsaken, barren land? Do you want to slowly perish on that energy-starved planet? Our future, our chance to cultivate in this fertile land, hinges on this war. Everyone, kill!\"</p>\n<p>With a deafening clash, the two sides collided.</p>\n<p>Killing intent thickened the air, blood clouds swirling ominously. Debris flew as elemental energies clashed, creating explosions that shook the very ground of Yin Tomb Beach. The once-silent beach, steeped in darkness, now echoed with the sounds of death and battle.</p>\n<p>Screams of agony mingled with roars of fury. Cultivators fell, their bodies piling upon one another as the relentless tide of battle surged forward. There was no retreat; only the singular, consuming thought: Kill!</p>\n<p>This battle was unlike any before. There would be no respite until one side lay defeated.</p>\n<p>From dusk until late afternoon, the conflict raged on. The stench of blood permeated the air, drowning out the cries of war.</p>\n<p>The Hundred Sect Alliance's initial momentum began to wane. This was the first interplanetary war for the Floating Star cultivators, but their overwhelming numbers slowly crushed the resistance of the Hundred Sect Alliance.</p>\n<p>A man in a red robe, bald and wild-eyed, laughed maniacally above the battlefield. \"Another True God has fallen to me! The Floating Star shall rule this land!\"</p>\n<p>\"The Heaven Seeking Palace's Elder Mu An has been slain…\"</p>\n<p>The Hundred Sect Alliance, already on the back foot, found themselves in an even more precarious position. Yet, as they witnessed the green-robed lady battling three True God experts alone, no one dared to retreat. She was Bei Suting, the beacon of hope for the Hundred Sect Alliance.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, a flying ship emerged from the Sky Sea, cutting through the air towards the Five Great Empires. Onboard were Mo Wuji and his companions, just returning from their journey.</p>\n<p>As they neared the Tian Shang Empire, Pu Qian, the most perceptive among them, noticed something amiss. \"Head senior brother, something feels off. Look at that blood fog; it’s thick enough to form clouds.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji halted, his gaze drawn to the ominous fog in the distance. Even from afar, it was a chilling sight.</p>\n<p>\"That must be the battlefield between the Hundred Sect Alliance and the alien cultivators. It looks intense,\" he replied, recalling similar scenes from the Thunder Fog Forest.</p>\n<p>\"What should we do?\" Sang Yiping asked, urgency lacing her voice.</p>\n<p>Their current strength was insufficient; they would be easy prey in such a chaotic war. The thought of dying before avenging the Tian Ji Sect was unbearable.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji steered the ship to a mountain peak. \"Everyone, disembark.\"</p>\n<p>Once they were a safe distance away, he retrieved an incomplete battleship from his storage ring.</p>\n<p>\"This is a battleship?\" Sang Yiping exclaimed, recognizing its potential despite its unfinished state.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, but it’s not complete. I had planned to enlist the Three-eyed Dhuta to finish it, but for now, we can at least prepare it for defense,\" Mo Wuji explained.</p>\n<p>The ship lacked the necessary runes for flight, rendering it immobile. However, it was equipped with cannons and ammunition. If they could install the cannons, they might stand a chance against any sudden attacks.</p>\n<p>\"Impressive!\" Pu Qian exclaimed, already climbing aboard to inspect the cannons.</p>\n<p>\"We need to install the laser cannons, golden beam cannons, and heavenly fire cannons first,\" Mo Wuji instructed, pointing to the designated areas.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the installation process was straightforward. With Mo Wuji's knowledge of arrays, they managed to set up sixteen massive cannons in just four hours.</p>\n<p>\"Are we just going to wait here?\" Sang Yiping asked, eyeing the ammunition Mo Wuji was placing behind the cannon forts.</p>\n<p>\"We'll wait. We leave when the war is over,\" he replied, fully aware of the precarious situation.</p>\n<p>If the Hundred Sect Alliance won, the defeated alien cultivators would scatter, and they would be in danger. If the Alliance lost, the alien forces would rampage unchecked. Hiding seemed wise, but Mo Wuji sensed that this battle was pivotal. It could determine the fate of the Five Great Empires.</p>\n<p>Staying put would allow them to gauge the outcome and choose their escape route wisely. Charging into battle would be futile; his strength alone couldn't alter the war's course.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, on Yin Tomb Beach, Bei Suting faced four opponents, True God experts closing in on her. Her defensive magic treasure held strong, but the odds were against her.</p>\n<p>As another True God from the Hundred Sect Alliance fell, the pressure on Bei Suting intensified. Even the most novice cultivator could see that her defenses were crumbling.</p>\n<p>\"Dean Bei, flee! We will protect you. You are our hope for the Lost Continent,\" a cultivator urged, desperation in his voice.</p>\n<p>Others echoed his plea, recognizing the truth. Bei Suting was their greatest asset, the only one who had reached the Extreme Mortal Stage and beyond. She had come to fight for her people, not to cower.</p>\n<p>\"I, Bei Suting, will fight alongside my comrades. This is my honor, and perhaps yours too. There will be no retreat; I will fight for the Lost Continent!\"</p>\n<p>\"Fight! Never retreat!\" Her words ignited a fire within the Lost Continent cultivators, a final rallying cry before the inevitable.</p>\n<p>Garber, witnessing Bei Suting's defiance, seethed with anger. \"If you refuse to submit to the Floating Star, we will show no mercy. Annihilate them! Gerald, take 10,000 soldiers and slaughter everyone in sight. We don’t need these worthless pigs!\"</p>\n<p>The outcome was nearly decided, and Garber knew that sending troops away would only demoralize the Lost Continent fighters.</p>\n<p>\"Yes!\" A man in a gold cloak stepped forward, his aura sharp and commanding. He was a Nihility God Stage expert.</p>\n<p>\"What will you do when you leave?\" Garber demanded.</p>\n<p>\"Kill everything in our path. Not even chickens or dogs will be spared,\" the gold-cloaked man replied, his voice steady.</p>\n<p>\"Good. Proceed,\" Garber commanded, satisfied.</p>\n<p>With a wave, the gold-cloaked man led a fleet of battleships from Yin Tomb Beach, each filled with bloodthirsty cultivators ready for slaughter.</p>",
