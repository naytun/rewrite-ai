Once his elemental energy and spiritual will ran out, he would die.</p><p>At this point, Mo Wuji directly threw out large quantities of lightning bolts. Originally he had the Scholar’s Heart to cover and protect him, so he technically did not need lightning bolts and just had to charge forward. However, after some time he noticed a pattern. The more Star Scorpions he killed, the more blocked his way. This meant that it was never ending, and the more he charged forward, the thicker the wall of Star Scorpions.</p><p>Hence Mo Wuji tried to increase his rate of attacks at the area ahead of him, and as expected, more Space Scorpions rushed over to block him.</p><p>His lightning bolts continued to stretch out further, not to attack the Space Scorpions by his side, but those much further away.</p><p>After Mo Wuji’s attack, he could no longer see the open space in front of him.</p><p>This was because even more Space Scorpions had instinctively blocked his path, and with his spiritual will, Mo Wuji realised that the Space Scorpions behind him had thinned out.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, he knew that this was the moment to escape. As long as he could turn around in the shortest time possible and take out his flying ship as fast as he could, there was a chance of escaping.</p><p>For this he had to be extremely fast, as those Space Scorpion, while not smart, were not stupid either. Once they found out that he had turned around suddenly, it would put them on guard even more. The next time he tried to create such an opportunity, it would be much more difficult.</p><p>It was a pity that the Scholar’s Heart still had no offensive capabilities, otherwise if he could throw out a large wave of green fire, no matter how many Space Scorpions there were, they would just be a joke.</p><p>Another few waves of lightning bolts landed in front, and Mo Wuji drew out the spherical flying ship.</p><p>Indeed, Mo Wuji’s sudden turning around motion confused the Space Scorpions blocking his way momentarily. By the time they charged forward again, his flying ship had been started up, and he charged out leaving a blur behind.</p><p>Two hours later, the figures of Space Scorpions left the field of vision of Mo Wuji’s spiritual will, and he finally sat down at the bow of the flying ship, sweating profusely.</p><p>This had been the closest of close shaves, as he was nearly done in by the Space Scorpions.</p><p>…</p><p>\"Hmm, who is that guy that just appeared at rank 9831 on the Earth Board? His name is so weird, Rogue Cultivator 2705?\" On the large plaza in Nine Mo City, someone noticed the unusual name that had been added onto the Earth Board.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not know that the name \"Rogue Cultivator 2705\" would appear on the Earth Board, as he would have reported a name if he knew that he would continue to be represented as Rogue Cultivator 2705 after killing the Great Circle of True Lake Stage cultivator after remaining nameless. Even using the name \"Mo Wuji\" was better than having \"Rogue Cultivator 2705\" appear on Zhen Mo Continent.</p><p>\"I know who the original rank 9831 was, his name is Fu Zhize, an expert a half step into Nihility God Stage, who had killed a seriously injured Nihility God Stage Level 6 expert out of luck a year ago. That Nihility God Stage Level 6 expert was originally rank 9831 on the Earth Board, but because Fu Zhize killed him, he was able to get onto the Earth Board.\"</p><p>To most cultivators, the 10,000 names on the Heaven, Earth, and Mortal Boards were not really much. Many could regurgitate any name on any of the three boards.</p><p>\"That’s right, I’ve heard of that before. This guy is afraid of being challenged by others, so who knows where he hid to. This Rogue Cultivator 2705 is quite lucky, to be able to meet this sham Fu Zhize. Hmm, Rogue Cultivator 2705, isn’t he…\"</p><p>Another cultivator remembered who Rogue Cultivator 2705 was in the middle of his sentence. Such a famous person, and one could say that no one that followed the three board would not know who Rogue Cultivator 2705 was.</p><p>\"He he, you’re not that hopeless after all. Who was the previous rank 1 of the Mortal Board? Wasn’t it Rogue Cultivator 2705? I heard that Gu Shaoyi admitted that he isn’t a match for this guy too.\"</p><p>The surrounding people all sucked in a breath of cold air, and could not believe that this was true.</p><p>Rogue Cultivator 2705 becoming rank 1 on the Mortal Board and going on the Earth Board was definitely true, and nothing surprising. The shocking thing was, just how long ago did Rogue Cultivator 2705 become rank 1 on the Mortal Board? Even if Rogue Cultivator 2705 advanced to Yuan Dan Stage, the Earth Board had no Yuan Dan Stage cultivators on it up till today.</p><p>Even the worst was in the advanced True Lake Stage, and those would have got on the board with exceedingly good luck, then disappeared soon after. A good example would have been Fu Zhize.</p><p>Rogue Cultivator 2705 could have advanced to Yuan Dan Stage, but he definitely couldn’t reach True Lake Stage in a mere few years’ time right? So what if he had really reached True Lake Stage? The Earth Board was not the stage for True Lake Stage cultivators, and even those that scraped through were in advanced True Lake Stage. It was basically the territory of Nihility God Stage experts.</p><p>\"Rogue Cultivator 2705, I heard his dao companion was forced into a corner in space by the young hall master of the Star King Mountain’s Star Wars Hall…\"</p><p>\"Don’t spout nonsense, otherwise you won’t even know how you were killed.\"</p><p>…</p><p>The same discussion happened on all plazas in Zhen Mo Continent with the three boards erected in them. Initially, all talks of Rogue Cultivator 2705 had died down after his name left the Mortal Board, but now he had become the main topic for everyone’s conversations.</p><p>…</p><p>Star King Mountain’s Star Lord Summit. A middle aged man wearing ordinary clothes stood with his hands behind his back, on the edge of a cliff, gazing into the long winding rivers in the distance.</p><p>A brown robed old man speedily walked over, softly speaking behind the middle aged man, \"Star Lord, Rogue Cultivator 2705 has appeared again. I heard that he got to rank 9831 of the Earth Board.\"</p><p>\"Oh, based on the duration of time, he should be at most in Yuan Dan Stage right? A Yuan Dan Stage entering the Earth Board, he’s this extraordinary? No wonder he became rank 1 on Star King Mountain’s Mortal King Board.\" The middle aged man referred to as Star Lord suddenly turned around, and spoke agitatedly.</p><p>\"That’s right, have the men that the Xia Clan sent to Lost Continent returned?\"</p><p>The brown robed man quickly replied, \"They haven’t, including Worldly Immortal Stage Gu Qi. I suspect that there’s some top notch expert on the Lost Continent that made all of them stay behind.\"</p><p>The middle aged Star Lord nodded his head, \"This is not impossible. Back when the Lost Continent’s rules were not destroyed, they had more prodigies, and there were many more experts over there as compared to Zhen Mo Continent. You should instead focus on monitoring the Xia Clan, and don’t allow them to return to the Lost Continent again. But since Rogue Cultivator 2705 has come to Zhen Mo Continent, I doubt that the Xia Clan will want to go back to the Lost Continent.\"</p><p>\"Yes Star Lord. Should I look for Rogue Cultivator 2705, and protect him from the shadows? Otherwise I’m afraid that the Xia Clan will harm him.\" The brown robed old man whispered.</p><p>After a long period of silence, the middle aged Star Lord sighed, \"A genius that requires protection is not truly a genius. Let him be. If he is able to survive, it means that he is indeed the person that will save our Zhen XIng. If he can’t even survive, then there’s no need to talk about anything else. Moreover, he was able to make it so far precisely because he is a rogue cultivator with no one to protect him.\"</p><p>As he finished speaking, the middle aged Star Lord shook his head, seemingly mumbling to himself, \"It’s a pity that this guy is too pale, with the look of a scholar. He’s not the ideal person…\"</p><p>He had obtained the details of how Rogue Cultivator 2705 looked like from the Xia Clan, which described Mo Wuji’s pale scholar disguise.</p><p>...</p><p>At the same time in Star King Mountain’s Star Wars Hall Xia Clan.</p><p>Xia Mu had just come out from cultivation, and as compared to when he had just arrived at the Lost Continent a few years ago, the Xia Mu now had a stable and sharp aura about him. The aura around him had settled down, and he began to appear like an expert.</p><p>\"Young master, there’s news about Rogue Cultivator 2705.\" The short Rhodes ran in excitedly. Since Ceng Houyi was killed, most of Xia Mu’s tasks were entrusted to him.</p><p>\"Where?\" A pleasant look of surprise instantly appeared on Xia Mu’s face as he suddenly stood up. However, he soon thought of his father’s teachings, hence sitting down once again, and suppressing the rashness in his heart.</p><p>Rhodes replied, \"He got on the Earth Board, and is rank 9831.\"</p><p>This made Xia Mu stunned for a while, before he spoke again, \"This guy is indeed impressive, to be able to reach rank 9831 in a short few years’ time.\"</p><p>He was indeed rather shocked, as he had barely reached the top 1,000 in rank on the Earth Board after hustling till today. At the same time, he was very aware that his rank was fake. In actuality, he might really be outside the top 2,000 ranks.</p><p>\"I want to report this to my father.\" Xia Mu soon came to a decision.</p><p>The Rogue Cultivator 2705 could sneakily take out Ceng Houyi, hence he probably was seeking death if he faced Rogue Cultivator 2705 alone. On top of that, he had forced Rogue Cultivator 2705’s dao companion to her death, so Rogue Cultivator 2705 probably had a big grudge against him.</p><p>A deep voice laced with joy came from the door, \"My son seems to have improved recently, to know how to plan before taking action.\"</p><p>\"Father,\" Xia Mu immediately stood to one side and bowed upon seeing the man that had entered. It was his father that had come in, Star King Mountain Star Wars Hall’s Hall Master Xia Dandao.</p><p>\"Greetings Hall Master,\" Rhodes bowed respectfully towards Xia Dandao before leaving carefully.</p><p>Xia Dandao walked to the seat that Xia Mu just stood up from, and spoke, \"Star Lord has noticed that Rogue Cultivator 2705, so if you want to act, you cannot act openly. This will be bad for the Xia Clan. Find out his location first.\"</p><p>\"Yes father.\" Xia Mu quickly replied. Rogue Cultivator 2705 definitely had to die by his hands. He was no longer the Xia Mu from a few years ago. Even if his father had not said so, he would not have openly gone to kill Rogue Cultivator 2705.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
