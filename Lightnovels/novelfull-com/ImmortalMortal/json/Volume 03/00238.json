This was her private matter, who was he to ask such a question?</p><p>\"If you're unwilling to answer, I would think that your words were just to stall me. Don't tell me that my appearance is too bad and not worth Junior Shuyin's eyes?\" The smile on Xia Mu's face disappeared and his tone also turned cold.</p><p>Rage slowly brewed within his heart, he had never received such a treatment before. He was a proud child of the Star King Mountain and was an existence respected by all on Zhen Mo Continent. Lost Continent, this sort of trashy place, actually rejected him two times in a row. Unless they thought that this special envoy was a herbivore who didn't dare to kill?</p><p>Cen Shuyin did not stand far from him, and could naturally feel Xia Mu's rich killing intent. She was forlorn. Ever since she entered the Heaven Seeking Palace and became the Sword Lake Master, Shen Kongjian’s disciple, no one dared to covet for her looks. It was also because of this, that she was an outstanding existence, not only in the Heaven Seeking Palace, but in the entire Five Great Empires.</p><p>But now, Special Envoy Xia was clearly threatening her, but there was nothing she could do. Cen Shuyin's despondence was because of her lamentation towards her change in fate. At the same time, she was lamenting the disappearance of her Master Shen Kongjian in the alien battlefield.</p><p>\"Ha ha…\" Feng Zhenqiu chuckled, clasped his fists and said, \"Special Envoy Xia, don't be hasty to get angry. I understand this child, Shuyin. Her skin is thin [1], and if not for Special Envoy Xia’s question, she would not even mention the matter of her dao companion. Indeed, not many people know about her dao companion, and I happen to be one of them.\"</p><p>Cen Shuyin stared at Feng Zhenqiu in astonishment; she did not have a dao companion, those words were only meant to fool Xia Mu.</p><p>Before Xia Mu could speak, Feng Zhenqiu continued, \"Actually, Special Envoy Xia also knows this person's name.\"</p><p>\"I know? Who?\" Xia Mu was stunned as he turned towards Feng Zhenqiu. In actuality, when Cen Shuyin did not reveal the name of her dao companion, he suspected that Cen Shuyin was merely trying to stall him. But now, Feng Zhenqiu proactively stood forward to talk about Cen Shuyin's dao companion, so he was naturally shocked.</p><p>\"He is a rogue cultivator, his alias is Rogue Cultivator 2705. He is extremely secretive in his movement and actions and even Cen Shuyin wouldn't know where her dao companion is.\" Feng Zhenqiu chuckled.</p><p>Rogue Cultivator 2705 only revealed himself once and disappeared without a trace. The Heaven Seeking Palace and Great Evolution Sect had tried searching for the said man, but had never been able to find him. Using Rogue Cultivator 2705 was the most suitable method to stall Xia Mu.</p><p>The Heaven Seeking Palace and Great Evolution Sect were, after all, the two strongest sects on the Lost Continent. Even they weren't able to determine Rogue Cultivator 2705’s whereabouts, so Feng Zhenqiu believed that this Xia Mu would definitely be unable to do so.</p><p>Cen Shuyin's heart sunk, and she was not the least bit happy. Even though she was thankful for Feng Zhenqiu's help, she was not willing to drag another down. She had not even met this Rogue Cultivator 2705 before. If it was possible, she would rather Dean Feng to not have uttered those words. Because the moment Xia Mu finds Rogue Cultivator 2705, he definitely would not live past an incense's time.</p><p>She was also clear of Feng Zhenqiu's intentions; he believed that Xia Mu definitely wouldn't be able to find this Rogue Cultivator 2705. But who could be definite of such things?</p><p>This caused Cen Shuyin's heart to be filled with guilt and discomfort. She had always cultivated with a pure heart, but while Feng Zhenqiu's words saved her, they also left a scar on her heart.</p><p>If Rogue Cultivator 2705 was really killed because of her, her lifetime's pursuit of the greater dao would be ruined. Even if he turned out fine, this scar would still affect this pursuit. Her personality did not allow such a thing, and her dao could not take such guilt.</p><p>It was because of this dao heart that when she exchanged a skill from an outer disciple, she would try her best to offer what she could.</p><p>Dean Feng had said such words but she could not refute them. If she refuted them, Xia Mu could very well eliminate Dean Feng.</p><p>If she could turn back time, she would rather say that she did not want a dao companion. Saying that she already had one would only implicate others.</p><p>Xia Mu furrowed his brows and thought for awhile. He suddenly said, \"I recall it now, isn't he number one on the Hundred Sect Alliance's Contribution Point Board?\"</p><p>Feng Zhenqiu hurriedly said, \"That's it. Even though his talents are exceptional, he does not like to be reined in by a sect. That's why he chose to be a rogue cultivator. With his sort of talent, many big sects don't catch his eye. His standards for women are naturally higher as well.\"</p><p>Feng Zhenqiu was trying to imply that Rogue Cultivator 2705 and the gorgeous Cen Shuyin were a compatible match.</p><p>Xia Mu regained his calm, looked towards Cen Shuyin and said, \"You go and find that Rogue Cultivator 2705. This sort of talent would go to waste on this continent.\"</p><p>Cen Shuyin went silent without a word. She couldn't explain that Feng Zhenqiu's words were wrong, nor could she acknowledge that Rogue Cultivator 2705 was her dao companion.</p><p>\"Shuyin, you can go down first. If you can contact him, then help extend the special envoy's invitation. But of course, going to the Zhen Mo Continent is entirely up to him.\" Feng Zhenqiu hurriedly interjected for Cen Shuyin to leave. If this carried on, this Xia Mu might get enraged and start a slaughter.</p><p>Cen Shuyin bowed towards Feng Zhenqiu and was just about to leave when Defender Xu suddenly asked, \"What's the cultivation level of this Rogue Cultivator 2705?\"</p><p>Cen Shuyin stopped in her tracks; she did not even know Rogue Cultivator 2705, how would she know his cultivation level? She did hear that he was in the Transcending Mortality Stage but she did not believe those rumours. Even if a Transcending Mortality Stage cultivator was super lucky, he still wouldn't be able to get to the number one spot.</p><p>Great Evolution Sect Head, Jiang Xiushan, helped her out of the tangle, \"Answering Defender Xu, it's rumoured that Rogue Cultivator 2705 is in the Transcending Mortality Stage. He is a pale faced scholar without a high cultivation but his true power is amazing. According to the accounts of a Heaven Seeking Palace Pill Pagoda's True Lake cultivator, during the initial wars with the alien cultivators, he was surrounded by more than hundred alien cultivators but he completely annihilated all of them. Not only that, he even that True Lake cultivator's life and killed an expert half a step into the Nihility God Stage. Among the hundred over cultivators which surrounded him, there were even some Yuan Dan Stage, Earth Realm cultivators.\"</p><p>It was just a casual question but the answer made Defender Xu stand up in shock, as he as asked in a higher pitch, \"He's so amazing? Are these just rumors?\"</p><p>Jiang Xiushan also hurriedly stood up and clasped his fists and said, \"These aren't rumors. Many people have heard him acknowledge it and that was also when he killed a clan member of my Great Evolution Sect's legacy disciple. Of course, when he killed that Nihility God Stage expert, the expert was already seriously injured.\"</p><p>Defender Xu nodded, \"Even so, that's something very amazing. If we find the person at hand, we must definitely bring him to the Zhen Mo Continent. This sort of talent is needed in the Star King Mountain.\"</p><p>Special Envoy Xia hastily added, \"Defender Xu can be rest assured. I will definitely find Rogue Cultivator 2705 and not let his talent go to waste.\"</p><p>Standing far away, Gu Shaoyin revealed a derisive smile. Even if he was surrounded by hundred over cultivators, with a few Yuan Dan cultivators in the mix, be wouldn't be able to kill them all. How would this Rogue Cultivator 2705 be able to do it? The Lost Continent must have specially created this Rogue Cultivator 2705 in this war against the alien cultivators to raise everyone's morale. Why didn't this Rogue Cultivator 2705 dare to meet others? Because he was just a person of fiction.</p><p>Cen Shuyin's heart was filled with contempt. Defender Xu should be looking for Rogue Cultivator 2705 out of pure appreciation but this Special Envoy Xia must definitely be due to unkind intentions.</p><p>\"Seniors, Shuyin will take her leave.\" After clasping her hands once more, Cen Shuyin left the main altar. She decided, she would immediately return to the Heaven Seeking Palace Sword Lake and enter closed door cultivation. So what if she couldn't go to the Zhen Mo Continent? Her master was able to cultivate to the True God Stage on the Lost Continent. She could definitely do the same.</p><p>...</p><p>After an incense's time, that red faced man whispered beside Xia Mu's ear, \"Cen Shuyin has left Yan City alone. I guess that she must have gone to find that Rogue Cultivator 2705.\"</p><p>Back at the selection, Stage Number 5 had two Yuan Dan Stage cultivators whose battle had captured everyone's eyes. Xia Mu's eyes remained on Stage Number 5 as he said simply, \"Follow her and do it.\"</p><p>That red faced man did not reply and stood behind Xia Mu for some time. Then, he left as though nothing had happened.</p><p>\"Why are you following too?\" The moment he left Yan City, the red faced man noticed that Gu Shaoyin was following him.</p><p>\"Elder Ceng, I want to see whether that Rogue Cultivator 2705 is truly that amazing or simply sheer fiction,\" Gu Shaoyin said with a bow.</p><p>The red faced man laughed, \"That's okay, then follow me.\"</p><p>Some things were hard for him to do. Fortunately, there was this fool who only knew about cultivation to do it for him. He was too clear about Gu Shaoyin, Gu Shaoyin was a fella who only had cultivation and the pursuit for strength in his heart. After hearing about Rogue Cultivator 2705, his interest must have been piqued. If he didn't have a look personally, he would be uncomfortable.</p><p>If he wasn't such a person, he wouldn't have followed them over from the Zhen Mo Continent to the Lost Continent.</p><p>…</p><p>Due to the long war, the bustle of the Heaven Seeking City had gradually declined. Even though the war had ended, the Heaven Seeking City had yet to regain its previous flourishing crowds.</p><p>The moment Mo Wuji walked into Heaven Seeking City, he was welcomed by the cold and spacious streets.</p><p>\"Head senior brother…\" As Mo Wuji reached the Immortal Training Inn, he saw Pu Qian who was wandering around the entrance. When Pu Qian called out to him, his voice seemed to contain some anxiety.</p><p>\"This is not a good place to talk. Let's go in first.\" Mo Wuji indicated to Pu Qian and they walked into the inn.</p><p>In the spacious room, Sang Yiping, Zhuang Yan and Nie Zhengnong were all there. From their expressions, Mo Wuji could guess that something just have happened.</p><p>The few saw that Mo Wuji had returned and they heaved a sigh of relief as they stood to greet him.</p><p>[1] The opposite of thick skin.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
