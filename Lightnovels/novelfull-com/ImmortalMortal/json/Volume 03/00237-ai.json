  "body": "<p>Cen Shuyin's brow furrowed as she listened. Her voice was icy, \"If you are truly that strong, then show me your skills.\"</p>\n<p>The crowd parted, creating a wide circle around them. The black-robed youth, Gu Shaoyin, stood at the center, his confidence palpable. If he weren't from Zhen Mo Continent, he might have choked on his own bravado. To claim no one in the Lost Continent could last even half an incense stick against him was sheer arrogance.</p>\n<p>\"I’m merely following orders,\" he replied coolly. \"I won’t engage in battle with you.\"</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin sheathed her sword, her tone unwavering. \"Then leave. I won’t accompany you.\"</p>\n<p>Gu Shaoyin raised his spear, his demeanor unyielding. \"Very well. I, Gu Shaoyin, will test your strength.\"</p>\n<p>Without a word, Cen Shuyin’s sword trembled in her grip. Brilliant streams of sword radiance surged toward him, a fierce response to his arrogance. Unlike her previous duel with Tao Yuan, this time, her sword radiance transformed into a torrential rain, slicing through the air with deadly intent.</p>\n<p>Gu Shaoyin shifted, his spear tracing a graceful arc. From that arc, an invisible wave of killing intent surged forth.</p>\n<p>\"Bang! Bang! Bang!\" The clash of energies erupted like a series of firecrackers, illuminating the sky. The shockwaves forced nearby cultivators to retreat, their faces pale with fear.</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin’s heart sank. She was acutely aware of her precarious situation. Her sword rain was being overwhelmed, and an unseen force held her back. If she attempted another strike, she sensed his spear would shatter her defenses and pierce her heart.</p>\n<p>This man was far stronger than Tao Yuan. As she struggled to maintain her sword rain, her Lightning Flash began to coalesce.</p>\n<p>\"Crack!\" The sound echoed like shattering ice. Before she could unleash her technique, her sword rain disintegrated, and an icy spear hovered threateningly at her throat. The roles had reversed; she was now the one on the brink of defeat.</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin felt a wave of despair wash over her. She had never claimed invincibility, but she had believed no Transcending Mortality Stage cultivator from the Five Great Empires could best her so effortlessly. Yet here she was, having barely executed one sword art before being subdued.</p>\n<p>Was the cultivation level in the Lost Continent truly so inferior to that of Zhen Mo Continent? The memory of the white-haired expert flashed in her mind, confirming her fears.</p>\n<p>The onlookers, who had cheered for her earlier, fell silent. Cen Shuyin had dazzled them by defeating Tao Yuan, yet now she stood powerless against a Transcending Mortality Stage cultivator from Zhen Mo Continent. Their hearts chilled, mirroring her own.</p>\n<p>Gu Shaoyin withdrew his spear, his gaze fixed on her, unyielding and silent.</p>\n<p>Despite their disdain for him, the cultivators knew better than to provoke Gu Shaoyin. A reckless attack could spell disaster, even for an early Yuan Dan Stage cultivator. For a typical Transcending Mortality Stage cultivator, a direct confrontation would mean certain death.</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin’s survival hinged on the special envoy’s presence. Others would not be so fortunate.</p>\n<p>She sheathed her sword, her voice cold. \"I will accompany you to see Special Envoy Xia.\"</p>\n<p>Though she hadn’t promised to leave immediately after her defeat, her tone conveyed her intent. Cen Shuyin had never gone back on her word. A spoken promise was a bond she honored.</p>\n<p>Gu Shaoyin nodded, a flicker of appreciation in his eyes. He despised hypocrisy.</p>\n<p>\"Junior Shuyin, please take a seat,\" Xia Mu, dressed in purple, gestured to a chair with polite authority.</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin shook her head. \"In the presence of the special envoy and esteemed seniors, I prefer to stand. Please, if you have any instructions, let me know.\"</p>\n<p>Feng Zhenqiu, seated nearby, nodded in agreement. Cen Shuyin embodied the pride of Sword Lake, exuding a humble yet confident aura.</p>\n<p>Xia Mu chuckled, not pressing her to sit again. His initial invitation was a gesture of generosity; he felt no one warranted a second.</p>\n<p>\"Your sword art is remarkable, and your lightning techniques are impressive. Do you possess lightning affinity spiritual roots?\" Xia Mu inquired directly.</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin replied evenly, \"That is my cultivation secret. While my level may not compare to yours, I hope the special envoy understands.\"</p>\n<p>Xia Mu waved his hand dismissively. \"It’s fine. I believe you have untapped potential. It would be a waste to keep you here.\"</p>\n<p>Feng Zhenqiu chimed in, \"The special envoy is correct. Shuyin is striving hard in this competition. After the first round, I believe she will easily advance into the top 100.\"</p>\n<p>Xia Mu nodded. \"That’s possible, but I have an even better idea.\"</p>\n<p>He smiled at Cen Shuyin. \"Even if you make it into the top 100, it only qualifies you for entry into Zhen Mo Continent, not directly to Star King Mountain. I have the means to grant you direct access.\"</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin’s eyes sparkled. She had heard tales of Star King Mountain and knew the black-robed youth across from her hailed from there. Gaining entry would be a dream realized.</p>\n<p>Seeing her excitement, Xia Mu’s smile widened. \"I am Xia Mu, the special envoy from Star King Mountain. I have faith in your strength and potential. I assure you, I am worthy of your consideration…\"</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin’s thoughts raced. His words felt off. He spoke of potential and an invitation to Star King Mountain, but what did that have to do with his worthiness?</p>\n<p>\"My mentor taught me that finding a good dao companion is crucial. It can alter a cultivator’s path. If I wish to invite someone as my dao companion, I will be direct. If you agree, I would like to be your dao companion. Together, we could explore Star King Mountain and contribute to its legacy…\" Xia Mu continued, his smile unwavering.</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin’s disbelief grew. How brazen to propose such a thing in front of so many!</p>\n<p>Understanding his confidence, she realized he believed she would accept, eager to reach Star King Mountain.</p>\n<p>She almost blurted her true feelings—that she had never considered a dao companion. But she held her tongue, knowing that such honesty would play into his hands.</p>\n<p>If he suggested they could postpone the dao companion discussion and focus on their current relationship while striving together at Star King Mountain, she would have no grounds to refuse.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, special envoy, but I already have a dao companion, so I cannot accept your request,\" Cen Shuyin said, bowing slightly.</p>\n<p>Feng Zhenqiu nearly applauded her response. Well said.</p>\n<p>Xia Mu’s smile faltered, but he maintained his composure. \"When discussing dao companions, it’s about striving together for cultivation. You must have noticed the vast differences in cultivation levels and knowledge between the Lost Continent and Zhen Mo Continent. Just look at your fight with Shaoying…\"</p>\n<p>Defender Xu interjected, unable to contain himself. \"Special Envoy Xia, please refrain from using Gu Shaoying as an example. It may mislead the cultivators of the Lost Continent into thinking their methods are inferior. While the cultivation level and culture here may not match Zhen Mo Continent, the gap isn’t insurmountable.\"</p>\n<p>Xia Mu’s frustration was palpable. He felt as if he had swallowed something foul. Defender Xu seemed intent on undermining him. Every time he tried to assert his authority, this old man countered him. If he ever secured a position at Star King Mountain, Xu would be the first to go.</p>\n<p>\"Defender Xu is correct,\" Xia Mu begrudgingly acknowledged, though his irritation simmered beneath the surface. He needed to maintain favor with the Immortal King to enhance his chances of success.</p>\n<p>\"Senior, did you say Gu Shaoying is ranked first in Zhen Mo Continent?\" Cen Shuyin’s eyes brightened as she turned to Defender Xu.</p>\n<p>Xu Chihuang smiled. \"Indeed. Zhen Mo Continent has three major ranking boards: Mortal, Earth, and Heaven. Gu Shaoying has long been in the Great Circle of the Transcending Mortality Stage Level 10, considered at the Extreme Mortal Stage. His current journey is to seek opportunities to ascend to the Earth Realm. No one in Zhen Mo Continent can defeat him. Even if you cannot win against him, do not belittle yourself. Your sword art is commendable, and your lightning technique has even greater potential.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, senior, for your guidance.\" The knot in Cen Shuyin’s heart unraveled. She may be strong, but she knew she could not defeat the top-ranked cultivator from Zhen Mo Continent.</p>\n<p>In that moment, she understood Xia Mu’s motives. He aimed to undermine her confidence, suggesting that Zhen Mo Continent’s standards were vastly superior to lure her in. While she was indeed interested in Zhen Mo Continent, it would not be through becoming someone’s dao companion.</p>\n<p>\"Since you have a dao companion, I won’t press further,\" Xia Mu said, though his laughter held a cold edge. \"I’m curious to know which genius disciple has captured your heart.\"</p>",
