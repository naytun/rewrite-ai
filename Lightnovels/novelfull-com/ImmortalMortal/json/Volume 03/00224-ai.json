  "body": "<p>The group exchanged glances, uncertainty hanging in the air. Sang Yiping, Nie Zhengnong, and Zhuang Yan felt the weight of their ignorance. They were not well-versed in the intricacies of their situation. Pu Qian, however, leaned back, too indifferent to ponder deeply. But with Mo Wuji's probing questions, they began to grasp the multitude of hidden issues.</p>\n<p>\"Did you put those items back, head senior brother?\" Sang Yiping finally pieced it together.</p>\n<p>Zhuang Yan hesitated, \"Maybe the Heaven Sect’s sect head used some trick to leak news about the immortal estate.\"</p>\n<p>\"No way. The Heaven Sect’s Sect Head is greedy. Just look at the treasures he hoards,\" Sang Liping interjected. \"If head senior brother hadn’t returned the ring, it would have been filled with treasures.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji smiled, \"I plan to take the ring, but first, we need to address these problems. Also, the spirit energy here is unusually dense. Yet, we haven’t seen any energy gathering arrays. I suspect there’s a spiritual vein nearby.\"</p>\n<p>\"A spiritual vein?\" Shock rippled through the group.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji nodded, his spiritual will sweeping the area. He sensed the densest energy where Jing Gumu lay. To investigate the vein, they would need to move his corpse, but Jing Gumu had explicitly warned against it.</p>\n<p>As they pondered Mo Wuji's revelation, his expression shifted to alarm. \"Everyone, come here quickly!\"</p>\n<p>He dashed into the room where Jing Gumu rested. Trusting him completely now, the others followed without hesitation.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping opened his mouth to ask what was happening, but raucous laughter echoed from outside.</p>\n<p>\"Is that the True God Stage expert?\" Zhuang Yan's voice trembled.</p>\n<p>Panic washed over their faces. That laughter was unmistakably terrifying, and it could only belong to the True God Stage expert.</p>\n<p>\"It's him, and he knows we're here,\" Mo Wuji's voice quickened. They faced someone far beyond their strength. Even if he was injured, he was still a formidable opponent.</p>\n<p>Seeing their confusion, Mo Wuji rushed to a corner behind Jing Gumu’s corpse, signaling for the others to follow. As they gathered, he began tossing spirit stones and pulling out simple array flags. Some were low-grade flags he had purchased, while others were scavenged from storage rings.</p>\n<p>Minutes passed, and he finally paused.</p>\n<p>\"Head senior brother, are you setting up a concealment array?\" Nie Zhengnong asked, recognizing his actions.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji confirmed, \"Yes, it’s a basic concealment array, along with a sound isolating array.\"</p>\n<p>Gratitude surged within him for Chu Xingzi. Without his guidance, Mo Wuji wouldn’t have been able to recognize or set up even simple arrays.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping chimed in, \"Granny Linglong said the black-clothed man is at True God Stage Level 1. Even if he’s injured, can this concealment array block his spiritual will?\"</p>\n<p>Hope flickered in the eyes of Pu Qian and the others, waiting for Mo Wuji’s reassurance.</p>\n<p>But he shook his head. \"This array won’t hide us from a True God Stage cultivator. He’ll sense it the moment he enters.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah…\" They fell silent, realizing that if the array couldn’t conceal them, why were they even using it?</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji remained composed. \"We have no other options. It’s the best we can do.\"</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping and the others lowered their heads, understanding that their head senior brother was trying to deceive himself. This was all he could manage.</p>\n<p>\"This trick has a name where I come from: deceiving yourself,\" Mo Wuji added.</p>\n<p>\"What does that mean?\" Zhuang Yan asked, but she quickly grasped the implication. It was akin to covering one’s ears to steal a bell—fooling only oneself.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping pressed, \"Head senior brother, there must be a reason behind your actions, right?\"</p>\n<p>With a sigh, Mo Wuji replied, \"I can only hope my guess is right. Everyone, stay quiet. He’ll find us soon.\"</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the door to Jing Gumu’s room burst open, splintering the walls.</p>\n<p>If Mo Wuji’s instincts were correct, the black-clothed man who had slain the corpse cultivator would be standing there. He didn’t probe the man with his spiritual will, but he could see the injuries were as Granny Linglong had described—no improvement. The man likely underestimated them, thinking Mortal Realm cultivators were no threat.</p>\n<p>The black-clothed man scanned the room, and when his gaze landed on Mo Wuji and the others, a cold grin spread across his face. They thought they could hide with such a pathetic concealment array? How naive.</p>\n<p>Ignoring them, he focused on the three items near the corpse. His eyes gleamed with greed as he stepped forward to seize them.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji exhaled in relief. As long as the man didn’t attack immediately, they had a chance. Though they hadn’t interacted with him, his actions spoke volumes. He had killed the corpse cultivator without a word and had taken Granny Linglong’s strike, intent on claiming the corpse cultivator’s spoils. This man was proud and single-minded. Once he set his sights on something, he wouldn’t be swayed.</p>\n<p>The black-clothed man rifled through the scroll Jing Gumu had left behind, flipping the jade seal without using his blood to refine it. He shoved Jing Gumu’s corpse aside, dismissing the dead man’s warning.</p>\n<p>As he did, a sense of unease washed over him. The youth in blue had manipulated him into fighting the corpse cultivator, and now he realized the youth wasn’t a fool. He must have known the concealment array wouldn’t block his vision. Perhaps he hadn’t anticipated the black-clothed man’s arrival.</p>\n<p>Better to eliminate the youth first.</p>\n<p>Dense spiritual energy surged, emanating from the spiritual vein beneath the corpse. Excitement coursed through the black-clothed man. He hadn’t expected such a treasure to lie beneath the dead body. No wonder Jing Gumu had warned against moving it.</p>\n<p>But then, a realization struck him.</p>\n<p>Before he could react, a powerful divine spirit surged into his consciousness.</p>\n<p>Spirit possession? A grimace twisted his features. He hadn’t anticipated someone attempting to transfer their spirit into him.</p>\n<p>He quickly sat cross-legged, battling the invading spirit in his consciousness, intent on tearing it apart.</p>\n<p>\"Crack!\" Mo Wuji tore through the concealment array, stepping forward first.</p>\n<p>The black-clothed man understood immediately. This youth was cunning, having manipulated him yet again.</p>\n<p>\"What’s happening, head senior brother?\" Sang Yiping asked, eyeing the black-clothed man, who writhed in agony.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji seized the moment, unleashing a barrage of electroballs at the black-clothed man. \"Quickly, take him down!\"</p>\n<p>His instincts had been right. The dense spiritual energy confirmed the presence of a spiritual vein, and he could sense it beneath Jing Gumu’s body.</p>\n<p>The black-clothed man had realized the truth too late. Why would a dead man sit atop a spiritual vein? The only explanation was that he wasn’t entirely dead. With a divine spirit present, the corpse could not attack, but it could possess.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji had no idea that divine spirits could take over others. Anyone would have sensed the spiritual energy and moved the corpse aside. But once someone touched Jing Gumu’s body, the divine spirit would have the opportunity to invade their consciousness.</p>\n<p>Though the black-clothed man wasn’t Jing Gumu’s ideal target, he had pushed the corpse aside, prompting the spirit to act.</p>\n<p>As Jing Gumu initiated the possession, the black-clothed man was momentarily distracted. Mo Wuji seized this chance, ready to strike.</p>\n<p>The rest of the group began to comprehend the situation, drawing their spiritual items to attack the black-clothed man.</p>\n<p>Despite his severe injuries, the black-clothed man was still a True God Stage Level 1 expert. He couldn’t be easily defeated by Mo Wuji’s lightning strikes, even if they were relentless.</p>\n<p>\"Boom! Boom! Boom!\" Lightning crackled around him. The black-clothed man laughed, confident that he could suppress the spirit and then deal with the youth who had outsmarted him. He knew Mo Wuji’s cultivation level was only Transcending Mortality Level 1.</p>\n<p>But then, an overwhelming fear gripped him, as if he were staring death in the face.</p>",
