  "body": "<p>In the bag Zhuang Yan received, several boxes of clothes lay nestled inside. These garments had been taken by Mo Wuji from the black-clothed woman’s storage ring in the Thunder Fog Forest. Zhuang Yan’s clothes were torn, leaving her back exposed. It felt only right to offer them to her.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, that’s too valuable. I haven’t done anything to deserve this,\" Pu Qian protested. Though he lacked the ability to use spiritual will, his cultivation at the Transcending Mortality Stage and strong elemental energy allowed him to sense the bag's contents easily.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji noticed Zhuang Yan opening her mouth to speak, but he waved his hand to silence her. \"Compared to my life, this is nothing. Spirit stones, no matter how high in quality, will eventually run out. Friends are the only true treasure. I’m fortunate to have made friends with you, brother Pu and sister Zhuang.\"</p>\n<p>His words rang true. He barely knew Pu Qian and Zhuang Yan, yet he hadn’t expected Zhuang Yan to return after he had helped her. In the world of cultivators, selfishness was rampant. If Zhuang Yan had come back, it was likely due to his earlier assistance. Pu Qian’s choice to return and help him solidified Mo Wuji’s view of him as a true friend.</p>\n<p>\"Brother Mo, it’s more my good fortune to befriend someone like you,\" Pu Qian declared, securing the storage bag at his waist. He had witnessed Mo Wuji saving Zhuang Yan in a dire situation, one that even her husband might have hesitated to intervene in. Yet, Mo Wuji was practically a stranger to her.</p>\n<p>Zhuang Yan, at Spirit Building Stage Level 7, never imagined she would possess a storage bag of this caliber. The bag contained top-grade pills and spirit stones, but what truly moved her was Mo Wuji’s thoughtfulness in including large boxes of women’s clothing.</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, brother Mo. I’ll go change now.\" Zhuang Yan accepted the storage bag, her gratitude evident. She believed Mo Wuji was the type who always had a solution, so he likely wouldn’t mind parting with a few storage bags.</p>\n<p>In truth, Mo Wuji didn’t care about the bags. He already had several, along with four storage rings.</p>\n<p>\"Go inside to change; we’ll wait for you out here,\" he instructed, pointing to the ship's door.</p>\n<p>\"Ahh…\" Zhuang Yan’s face paled as she recalled the ship’s eerie interior, causing her to hesitate on the outer deck.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji sighed, \"Then change on the outer deck. We’ll wait for you on the sea.\"</p>\n<p>He tossed a few broken poles into the water, then pulled Pu Qian along as he leapt onto one of them.</p>\n<p>\"Brother Mo, leaving sister Zhuang Yan alone…\" Pu Qian’s eyes widened in shock at Mo Wuji’s decision. But Mo Wuji smiled reassuringly, \"Don’t worry. The ship is safe now. I’ve been here for quite some time.\"</p>\n<p>Pu Qian didn’t grasp it right away, and Zhuang Yan felt a chill of fear. Yet, she trusted Mo Wuji wouldn’t harm her. Quickly, she donned a set of clothes and jumped off the ship.</p>\n<p>Once she landed on the pole Mo Wuji had prepared, her racing heart began to settle. Being alone on the ship had terrified her more than the thought of dying. It was clear how much courage it took for her to return for Mo Wuji.</p>\n<p>She soon realized that Mo Wuji’s safety on the ship was no coincidence. He must have known it was secure, likely having dealt with whatever threat had been aboard. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have left her alone.</p>\n<p>Pu Qian was more aware of the situation. He suspected that Mo Wuji had eliminated the threat and that the storage bags they received were taken from it.</p>\n<p>However, he chose not to delve deeper into it. Some things were better left unsaid.</p>\n<p>The trio soon reached the island, only to find that the five who had gone ahead had already departed.</p>\n<p>\"The immortal estate should be on this island, but it’s likely a fake. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be so many maps leading to it,\" Pu Qian sighed, gazing at the island’s heart.</p>\n<p>Zhuang Yan’s expression darkened. \"I’m not sure how we’ll return later.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji had no answer. They were close to the location marked as the immortal estate, and they still needed to search for Aunt Eleven and Mo Xiangtong. They had let the ship drift, as keeping it there might have benefited the five who had abandoned them. Mo Wuji had no intention of giving them any advantage.</p>\n<p>\"Let’s explore deeper into the island. Perhaps we’ll uncover something,\" Pu Qian suggested, his optimism shining through.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji led the way, with Zhuang Yan in the middle and Pu Qian bringing up the rear.</p>\n<p>The island lacked tall mountains, but countless ridges stretched before them. Thorns and vines tangled around them, while poisonous snakes and ants lurked nearby.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, even Zhuang Yan, the least experienced, was at the advanced Spirit Building Stage. Despite the absence of clear paths, they moved at a decent pace.</p>\n<p>After two hours, Mo Wuji halted. He didn’t need to consult the map; the destruction before him was evident.</p>\n<p>\"This place has been recently destroyed. Wait, the immortal estate’s location on the map seems to be here,\" Pu Qian said, pulling out the map. \"That’s right, this is the spot. The seven mountains on either side resemble a ladle, and the immortal estate should be right in the center. It seems others have visited this place before us.\"</p>\n<p>Using his spiritual will, Mo Wuji discovered a staircase leading underground. After clearing some soil, he uncovered a stone slab. Below it lay a spiraling staircase. Unfortunately, his spiritual will couldn’t penetrate deeper.</p>\n<p>\"Brother Mo, we can descend from here. The map indicates it. But why have others come here before us?\" Zhuang Yan asked, puzzled.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji chuckled, \"My observation skills are sharp. While we walked, I heard sounds that suggested the ground was hollow.\"</p>\n<p>In truth, Mo Wuji had analyzed everything with his spiritual will, a secret he kept even from his friends.</p>\n<p>\"Let me try.\" Pu Qian drew a mace from his storage bag and swiftly cleared the fresh soil. This mace, a low-grade spiritual item Mo Wuji had given him, made quick work of the task. He hesitated to use his heavy sword just yet.</p>\n<p>With a few strokes, a medium-sized bluestone slab was revealed. A flick of the mace flipped it open, revealing an endless stone staircase. A cold gust of air wafted up from below, indicating the underground was frigid.</p>\n<p>Deep down, Mo Wuji felt disappointment. If this was an immortal estate, then his own home couldn’t be much worse. Everyone knew the map was likely a fake, but it would be absurd if it led to a place even a mortal could construct.</p>\n<p>Even a shabby immortal estate should have some concealment, defense, or killing arrays. Yet, all that lay before them was a simple staircase, easily dug by hand.</p>\n<p>\"If this is an immortal estate, then my house is not much worse,\" Pu Qian echoed Mo Wuji’s thoughts.</p>\n<p>Zhuang Yan interjected, \"Brother Mo, brother Pu, this place lacks any special aura. It seems like it could have been dug by a mortal. But how would a mortal have reached here?\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji nodded. It was indeed unlikely for a mortal to arrive at this location. While the sky sea had few strong demonic beasts, the giant waves and howling winds were beyond what mortals could endure.</p>\n<p>\"Let’s go in and take a look. I’ll lead,\" Mo Wuji decided, stepping onto the stone staircase.</p>\n<p>\"I’ll cover the back. I’ll return the bluestone slab to its original state later,\" Pu Qian offered, taking his position at the rear.</p>\n<p>As Zhuang Yan followed Mo Wuji, she pulled out an illumination stone. A ten-meter radius around the staircase lit up, revealing that the staircase was surrounded by bluestone. Clearly, the creator of this staircase was no ordinary person.</p>\n<p>At the staircase's end stood a stone door. When Mo Wuji let his spiritual will seep through, he was momentarily stunned. Beyond the door lay a stone hall filled with familiar faces. Jiang Xiapeng and his group had arrived before them. To his surprise, nearly twenty people filled the hall, including over ten unfamiliar faces.</p>\n<p>In the center of the stone hall stood an object resembling a yurt, surrounded by the gathered crowd.</p>\n<p>As Mo Wuji pushed the stone doors open, twenty pairs of eyes turned toward the three of them. Qi Wenxuan’s face lit up with relief. \"Yanyan, I was so worried about you! Thank goodness you’re safe. Come quickly to my side.\" Zhuang Yan merely nodded, remaining close to Mo Wuji and Pu Qian. She had initially hesitated to join the sea expedition, but Qi Wenxuan’s promises of protection had persuaded her. Now, she realized those words held little weight.</p>\n<p>\"Latecomers, behave yourselves and stand at the back,\" a sharp voice commanded as Mo Wuji approached the stone mound at the center of the hall.</p>",
