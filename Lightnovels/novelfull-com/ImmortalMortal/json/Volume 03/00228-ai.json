  "body": "<p>Mo Wuji's gaze swept across the ship, a marvel of cultivation and technology. His heart raced as he spotted the naval cannons, not mounted on cannon forts but integrated into the very structure of the vessel. The ship was a treasure trove of blueprints and books, each one whispering secrets of power and destruction.</p>\n<p>He focused his spiritual will, scanning the blueprints. They revealed the ship's design: an Incomplete Immortal Battleship, 640 meters long and 230 meters wide. It was armed with ten laser cannons, ten space sundering cannons, three penta-elemental cannons, and five extermination cannons. The bow and flanks were forged from Celestial Sunflower Gold, a material that allowed it to glide through the void. The requirements for the laser cannons were daunting: Earth grade spirit stones, Radium Crystals, Earth Heart Flame, Brilliant Rainbow Crystals...</p>\n<p>With each detail he absorbed, Mo Wuji's excitement grew. This was no mere ship; it was a moving fortress. The thought of its power sent shivers down his spine. Even a True God Stage expert would think twice before confronting it. His spiritual will brushed against the ship's bow and flanks, confirming the Celestial Sunflower Gold's quality. The sheer volume used was staggering—over a hundred times what he had previously acquired. The wealth of the ship's former owner must have been immense.</p>\n<p>Yet, a shadow loomed over his excitement. The ship was incomplete. Without knowledge of smithing, he had no way to finish the Incomplete Immortal Battleship. He pressed on, searching the storage ring. Most of it was empty, save for a small pile of items that initially appeared to be rubbish. But as he focused, he realized they were cannon ammunition, meticulously categorized: laser cannon, space sundering cannon, heavenly fire cannon, heavy water cannon...</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji's heart raced. This ship could be a game-changer. He might not know how to smith, but he could find someone who did. He had already transferred his belongings to a larger ring, and as he observed his companions lost in their cultivation, he quietly exited the room.</p>\n<p>In the expansive hall outside, he began refining the black-clothed man's intermediate grade flying ship. Cen Shuyin's flying car had been a low-grade piece of equipment, lacking in speed and space. But this ship was different—spacious and equipped with decent defenses. It would serve them well on their return.</p>\n<p>Days passed. Just as Mo Wuji completed the refinement, the air around him began to tremble, more violently than before. He sensed that Pu Qian was on the verge of a breakthrough, ready to transcend into the Earth Realm Yuan Dan Stage.</p>\n<p>Half a day later, the ripples in space faded, and Pu Qian emerged, radiating dense spirituality and newfound confidence. He had indeed entered the Yuan Dan Stage.</p>\n<p>\"Congratulations, Pu Qian!\" Mo Wuji exclaimed, genuinely pleased. Pu Qian's advancement was a boon for the Tian Ji Sect.</p>\n<p>\"Head senior brother, I’ve never experienced such a fulfilling cultivation session. The spiritual energy was abundant, and the pills plentiful. It was incredible!\" Pu Qian's joy was palpable. He had expected to reach this stage in ten years, yet here he was, having soared through it in mere months.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji chuckled, \"When we return, we’ll take this spiritual vein back to the Tian Ji Sect. It will provide a foundation for everyone to cultivate.\"</p>\n<p>He had a vision for the Tian Ji Sect—a place rich in spiritual energy, essential for rebuilding. Without strength, their efforts would be meaningless. He wanted to restore the sect to its former glory, not just in name.</p>\n<p>\"Head senior brother, that might not be feasible. When we return, we must do so discreetly. We can't go back to the original Tian Ji Sect just yet. We need to grow stronger first,\" Nie Zhengnong interjected, having emerged from his own cultivation. He had reached Transcending Mortality Stage Level 8, surpassing even Pu Qian.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji remained silent, his thoughts diverging from Nie Zhengnong's. He envisioned a bold return, not a stealthy one. However, he understood the risks; the Yu Lin Lei Clan could strike before they were ready.</p>\n<p>\"Do any of you know skilled smiths in the Five Great Empires?\" Mo Wuji asked, his eyes gleaming with determination. His Incomplete Immortal Battleship could turn the tide against the Yu Lin Lei Clan, a sect that was merely above average in strength.</p>\n<p>\"I'm not very familiar with this, but perhaps junior apprentice sister Sang might know more,\" Nie Zhengnong suggested, knowing Sang Yiping often dealt with external affairs.</p>\n<p>Pu Qian chimed in, \"The Heaven Seeking Palace Smith Summit’s Summit Lord Zhang Pingshan is quite impressive. His spiritual equipment is highly sought after.\"</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping and Zhuang Yan joined the conversation, revealing that the true master at the Smith Summit was the Three-eyed Dhuta, a guest elder renowned for his exceptional smithing skills.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji nodded, recognizing the potential. After returning to the Heaven Seeking Palace, he would seek out the Three-eyed Dhuta to help complete his Immortal Battleship.</p>\n<p>\"We’ve been cooped up here for months. Once we extract the spiritual vein, we’ll head back and rebuild the Tian Ji Sect,\" Mo Wuji declared, determination etched on his face.</p>\n<p>The spiritual vein, previously extracted by Jing Gumu, was now easily sent into Mo Wuji's storage ring. Two hours later, they charged out of Sky Lake Island on their flying ship.</p>\n<p>At Yin Tomb Beach, a desolate stretch near Yan City, the atmosphere was thick with tension. Hundreds of thousands of cultivators gathered, the air heavy with the scent of impending conflict. The war had not yet begun, but death loomed close.</p>\n<p>The alien cultivators had infiltrated the Lost Continent, prompting the Five Great Empires to form the Hundred Sect Alliance. Initially, they had managed to repel the invaders, but as the war dragged on, the balance of power shifted. The alien forces grew stronger, and the Hundred Sect Alliance faced relentless defeats, losing ground and territory.</p>\n<p>Now, the battlefront lay at Yin Tomb Beach, perilously close to Yan City. If they lost this ground, the Hundred Sect Alliance would crumble, and the alien cultivators would seize control of the Five Great Empires.</p>\n<p>Above the battlefield, eight True God Stage experts from the Hundred Sect Alliance hovered, a testament to their gathered might. In stark contrast, more than ten alien experts loomed ominously in the air, their presence a chilling reminder of the odds stacked against them.</p>\n<p>\"Feng Zhenqiu, the difference between my Floating Star’s forces and yours is as vast as the heavens and the earth. If your Hundred Sect Alliance continues to resist, don’t blame me for the massacre. Surrender now, and I might spare you,\" a grey-haired alien leader threatened, his voice dripping with menace.</p>\n<p>Feng Zhenqiu remained silent, but a clear, resolute voice cut through the tension. \"In the Lost Continent, there’s a sect called the Tian Ji Sect. Their motto is that cultivators stand till their deaths; there are no rats who kneel while alive. We’re warring, so stop the nonsense!\"</p>\n<p>\"Support the Dean! We’re warring! Stop the nonsense!\" The cultivators of the Hundred Sect Alliance roared, their spirits ignited, the air crackling with their determination.</p>",
