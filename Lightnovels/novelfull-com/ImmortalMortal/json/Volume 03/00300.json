Even though these five array flags had been fallen, no entrance was opened and it even sealed the exit up. However, it allowed Mo Wuji to see the concealment array.</p><p>Cen Shuyin was right, there was indeed a concealment array. Mo Wuji guessed that when the five original array flags were replaced, not only would the exit be sealed, the concealment array would appear and new passages would emerge.</p><p>He wasn't able to fully accomplish that was definitely related to the array flag. He was using the array flags forged by Xing Huang, it was expected that it might pale in quality.</p><p>To others who don't know of the array dao, they would be completely stumped at this point. But Mo Wuji was different. When he reached this step, he knew how to uncover the hidden entrances.</p><p>Mo Wuji fetched out a few array flags and threw them out. When the array flags were in place, a subtle spatial ripple appeared; Mo Wuji swung down towards this spatial ripple.</p><p>\"Boom!\" Huge patches of rock and rubble exploded, revealing a long passage in front of Mo Wuji and Cen Shuyin.</p><p>Cen Shuyin was inwardly shocked at Mo Wuji's power and knowledge over arrays. She had also interacted with the array dao before, but this place looked no different from any typical place. However, Mo Wuji was able to make use of array flags and reveal the location of the hidden passage.</p><p>Moreover, Mo Wuji only needed a single strike from his pole to open up the entrance to the passage. Ostensibly, Mo Wuji's power was multiple times of hers; no wonder why Mo Wuji was able to get here. What she didn’t know was that when Mo Wuji had first arrived, he hadn’t even advanced into the True Lake Stage and he almost perished under the tumultuous and crazed Thorny Wind Whip.</p><p>\"Follow behind me, we'll go in and take a look. The spiritual energy inside is richer, so there's definitely something good.\" Mo Wuji gestured towards Cen Shuyin and started to walk in.</p><p>The passage was only slightly inclined downwards, it wasn’t an especially steep descent. As they walked through the passage, Mo Wuji and Cen Shuyin could tell the two walls of the passage were made from rock far harder than the toughest smithing material. After all, facing the constant beating from the rushing winds of the Thorny Wind Gate, any soft rock would have long weathered away without a trace.</p><p>The passage was not considered long; the two merely walked for half an incense's time before reaching the end. At the end, there was a stone space which resembled a room. The stone room was simple, there was a futon at the center and above the futon was a stone table. Atop the stone table lay two legacy crystal balls. By the side of the table, there was a row of words: Those who wish to succeed me are to kneel ~ Typhoon.</p><p>Mo Wuji never expected that this deeply hidden place would actually be a legacy holding.</p><p>Cen Shuyin looked at Mo Wuji and said, \"I have the legacy of my sect. You're a rogue cultivator so you should succeed this legacy. I wonder what kind of person this Senior Typhoon was, to actually leave behind his legacy within the Thorny Wind Gate.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji shook his head, \"I have my own legacy, I don't need this one. Moreover, you were the one who discovered this location, meaning that you are the fated one.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji was not being pretentious, he really didn't care much about the legacy. Instead, it was the rich spiritual energy which interested him; it was a good place to cultivate.</p><p>Cen Shuyin saw that Mo Wuji did not seem to be lying. She knew he was not a pretentious person, so she took a few steps forward and looked at the two crystal balls. After a brief hesitation, she still chose to kneel on the futon.</p><p>A wave of rich spirituality instantly danced and wrapped around Cen Shuyin,bring with it a hum of beautiful music. The two legacy crystal balls flew by themselves, landing within Cen Shuyin's hands.</p><p>As Cen Shuyin grasped the two crystal balls, her entire body went slack, her hands even started to tremble constantly.</p><p>Mo Wuji even thought that something had went wrong with Cen Shuyin, he hurriedly stepped forward and asked urgently, \"Senior apprentice sister Cen, are you okay?\"</p><p>Cen Shuyin barely calmed herself down. Taking her deep breath, she brought one of her trembling arms in front of Mo Wuji and offered the crystal ball, \"This is for you…\"</p><p>Even though Mo Wuji could see that Cen Shuyin genuinely wanted to give him this crystal ball, he could also see the desire in Cen Shuyin's eyes. Clearly, Cen Shuyin also strongly desired the legacy from this crystal ball.</p><p>Mo Wuji's heart was filled with doubt. He knew that Cen Shuyin offered the crystal ball to him to repay his saving grace. After all, Mo Wuji had a rough understanding of Cen Shuyin's personality. However, he did not understand what on earth this thing could be for Cen Shuyin to want it so badly. He casually received the crystal ball and scanned it with his spiritual will before asking doubtfully, \"I'm not able to read anything from the legacy crystal ball unless I accept the legacy. What is it?\"</p><p>Cen Shuyin said with a quivering voice, \"This is an Immortal Grade legacy technique - Typhoon Formula.\"</p><p>Immortal Grade technique? Mo Wuji's heart reverberated with shock. The highest graded technique he knew was at the Treasured Heaven Grade. The Immortal Grade was above that and was even rumoured to be able to allow a cultivator to fly.</p><p>Flight, this was a thing of legend. Regardless of the Lost Continent or the Zhen Mo Continent, he had never heard of anyone flying. Those who could cultivate to become a Worldly Immortal was already as rare as a Phoenix feather or a Qilin horn. What more those who could fly? The inability of flight did not necessarily mean that there was a problem with a cultivator's talent or resources. Most of the time, it was because the cultivator was lacking a supreme cultivation technique.</p><p>He finally understood the desire within Cen Shuyin's eyes. A manual which could cultivate flight, which cultivator wouldn't want that? If he didn't create his own cultivation technique, his thirst for this manual might even be stronger than Cen Shuyin.</p><p>If this manual was exposed, definitely all the experts on the planet would come rushing over to fight for it; countless of them would die in the process. If not for her wish to repay his gratitude, Cen Shuyin definitely wouldn't bear to offer up this Typhoon Formula.</p><p>\"If I'm not wrong, you should have ice-affinity spiritual roots?\" Mo Wuji asked plainly.</p><p>To others, an Immortal Grade technique might be something they would madly scramble over but Mo Wuji didn't really care much for it. His Immortal Mortal Technique was merely a Mortal Grade technique, but with his modification, it had become a completely different technique from the Immortal Mortal Technique. It was very different from every other technique. It was the reverse circulation technique. This technique was extremely compatible with him, allowing him to cultivate at an superb pace. Not only an Immortal Grade technique, even if it was above the Immortal Grade, he would not change his cultivation technique.</p><p>Moreover, he only needed a single glance to tell that the Typhoon Formula was a wind-type cultivation technique. Even if he wanted to change, he wouldn't be able to do so.</p><p>Cen Shuyin nodded, \"Yes, but I had a hidden series of spiritual roots, which are wind-affinity spiritual roots. Wind-type cultivation techniques are the rarest among unique elemental spiritual roots. That's why my master got me to develop my ice-affinity spiritual roots.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji handed the Typhoon Formula back to Cen Shuyin, \"Senior apprentice sister Cen, this technique is not suitable for me. Since you have succeeded the legacy and you also have wind-affinity spiritual roots, you should keep it for yourself.\"</p><p>Cen Shuyin stared at Mo Wuji in astonishment, she never expected for a person to not be tempted by an Immortal Grade technique. Even if he didn't use it on himself, he could still exchange it for copious amounts of cultivation resources.</p><p>Soon, she came to an understanding. Mo Wuji was a person who would risk his life to save a female slave; giving up on an Immortal Grade technique was not something out of the ordinary. After all, he was not an ordinary human.</p><p>\"Then I will pass this to you,\" Mo Wuji handed over the other crystal ball to Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not even take a look, directly pushing it back to her, \"Thanks, but I have my own cultivation technique and skills. I truly do not need this…\"</p><p>\"It's an escaping art, the Wind Escape Technique…\" The moment Cen Shuyin uttered those words, Mo Wuji immediately stopped continuing on what he wanted to say.</p><p>If there was something that was still appealing to him, it would be an escaping art of the five elements. If there was something that could attract his attention, it would an escaping art of the five elements. What he lacked the most now was an escaping art and among all escaping arts, the elemental ones were the best. The wind-type escaping arts were even more attractive than those of the five elements. Now, Cen Shuyin actually obtained just that.</p><p>Mo Wuji instantly turned awkward; he had already rejected it, but now that Cen Shuyin mentioned that it was the Wind Escape Technique, it would be a little disgraceful to take back his words.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, this Wind Escape Technique was comprehended by Senior Typhoon, to pass it onto a second person would cause it to drop by a grade…\"</p><p>\"Why?\" Mo Wuji interrupted Cen Shuyin's words and asked doubtfully.</p><p>Cen Shuyin explained, \"According to the explanation Senior Typhoon left behind in his legacy that the strongest Wind Escape Technique is based upon the enlightenments from the Escaping Wind. If this person passed down the Wind Escape Technique as a legacy, it would be a different Wind Escape Technique based on his attainment over the wind element.\"</p><p>\"Gaining enlightenment of the Wind Escape Technique from the escaping wind? What does that mean?\" Mo Wuji was completely unable to comprehend Cen Shuyin's words.</p><p>Cen Shuyin continued, \"Senior Typhoon said that the Escaping Wind is a naturally born spiritual grass. This spiritual grass is extremely rare and it seemed no different from any ordinary grass. Because this little grass does not have any spiritual energy, it does not have any dao halos, nor does it have any tier… The only difference that sets this little grass apart is that the entire grass is full of with wind runes, giving it a grey colour…\"</p><p>Escaping Wind is a type of grass? Don't I have one of this grass that Cen Shuyin is talking about?</p><p>Mo Wuji celebrated in his heart; he never expected that he would actually obtain such a heaven defying treasure from that battle between the two Howling Wind Beasts.</p><p>With the Escaping Wind, why would Mo Wuji still care about this Wind Escape Technique legacy? Seeing Cen Shuyin push the Wind Escape Technique back towards him, Mo Wuji did not hesitate to push it back again, \"I don't need this too.\"</p><p>Cen Shuyin was stunned as she stared at Mo Wuji; if Mo Wuji rejected everything, then she really didn't know what to do. There were only two things here; Mo Wuji had already given the Immortal Grade technique up to her, and now he was letting her have the Wind Escape Technique too?</p><p>\"Originally, I did need an escaping art, but from your words, I found out that I already have a strain of Escaping Wind. I’ve decided to stay here to gain enlightenment over the Wind Escape Technique, an escaping art is extremely important to me. This place is rich in spiritual energy, you should stay here too and accept the legacy.\" Mo Wuji did not hide anything. He didn't even ask for Cen Shuyin to thank him.</p><p>\"Alright,\" When Cen Shuyin understood the reason why Mo Wuji rejected the Wind Escape Technique, she felt that Mo Wuji was especially dashing.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
