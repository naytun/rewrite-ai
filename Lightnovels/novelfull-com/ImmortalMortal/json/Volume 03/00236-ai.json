  "body": "<p>Tao Yuan, seasoned in battle, sensed something amiss as crackling noises echoed around him. With urgency, he hurled the long whip in his hands toward Cen Shuyin, his movements swift and deliberate.</p>\n<p>\"Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!\" The sound of lightning erupted, shattering the elemental energy layer surrounding Tao Yuan.</p>\n<p>\"Bang!\" Cen Shuyin's long sword intercepted the whip, sending a flurry of radiant swords hurtling toward him. This was the advantage of a sword cultivator—striking with brilliance at any moment.</p>\n<p>As Cen Shuyin's attack broke through his defenses, panic surged within Tao Yuan. He knew the radiant swords were not to be underestimated. He stumbled backward, the elemental energy on his whip fading fast.</p>\n<p>Swords of light sliced into his shoulders, and in an instant, a cold blade pressed against his neck.</p>\n<p>Pale and breathless, Tao Yuan froze. \"Senior Cen, I admit defeat.\"</p>\n<p>With a flick of her wrist, Cen Shuyin sheathed her sword, her voice icy. \"Had it not been for your contributions against the alien cultivators, my sword would have pierced your neck.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you, senior, for your mercy.\" Tao Yuan's face flushed red, and he leapt off the stage. Sharing the same cultivation level as Cen Shuyin, he acknowledged her superiority with respect.</p>\n<p>A thunderous applause erupted from the crowd, the atmosphere in the Heaven Seeking Palace’s Sword Lake electric with excitement. Despite the Great Evolution Sect's higher ranking, Cen Shuyin's victory over Tao Yuan bolstered Heaven Seeking Palace's reputation.</p>\n<p>Jiang Xiushan chuckled, \"This Sword Lake disciple wields a lightning attribute skill. No wonder Tao Yuan couldn't match her.\"</p>\n<p>Feng Zhengqiu understood the implication behind Jiang Xiushan's words. It suggested that Cen Shuyin's triumph stemmed not from her sect's teachings but from an external lightning affinity skill.</p>\n<p>\"Indeed,\" Feng Zhengqiu added. \"Without that defensive skill, Tao Yuan would have surely fallen to Shuyin's sword waves. I heard he acquired it from the Lost Sky Ruins.\"</p>\n<p>Jiang Xiushan's expression darkened, but he remained silent, knowing the truth of Tao Yuan's skill.</p>\n<p>Xia Mu observed the scene with amusement. \"Neither of you are wrong. Elder Ceng, please summon Junior Cen. Her sword art and lightning strikes are exceptional—quite a rarity in this competition.\"</p>\n<p>\"Understood,\" replied the tall man behind him, turning to relay the message to a black-robed youth who swiftly departed.</p>\n<p>The surrounding spectators, including Feng Zhengqiu and Jiang Xiushan, shifted their focus to Xia Mu. They sensed his formidable presence, aware that he was not one to be trifled with.</p>\n<p>\"Crack!\" A wave of pressure crashed down on Mo Wuji, causing his leg to break once more as he stepped onto the 108th step.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, the oppressive force dissipated, replaced by a thick mist. To his astonishment, all his wounds healed, even the newly broken leg.</p>\n<p>What a remarkable place! How wonderful it would be to cultivate here.</p>\n<p>As he contemplated his cultivation, he recalled opening his 102nd meridian on the previous step. Yet, he remained in the Transcending Mortality Stage Level 12, only reaching its Great Circle. The three Gold Forming Pills he had consumed should have propelled him to the Earth Realm.</p>\n<p>Disappointment washed over him. He set aside thoughts of advancing to the Yuan Dan Stage. With the 102nd meridian opened, a period of closed-door cultivation would suffice for the breakthrough. There was no need to rush.</p>\n<p>The 108th step revealed a platform several meters wide, with a pure white stone slab at the forefront. Carving his name there would secure his place at the top of the rankings.</p>\n<p>At the back of the platform, a small table held a palm-sized token made of an unknown material. Mo Wuji's spiritual will couldn't penetrate it. As he approached, he noticed an inscription: \"I risked my life to obtain the Immortal Seeking Token. The Heaven Seeking Staircase was picked up from the street by me... If anyone manages to obtain the Immortal Seeking Token from here, please avenge me. The man I have a grudge with is named Pang Zui... Never mind, since you could obtain the Immortal Seeking Token, you must be extremely talented, so please do something for the cultivators of Zhen Xing... Ji Feiqian.\"</p>\n<p>This was perplexing. How could the Heaven Seeking Staircase be found on the streets? If Ji Feiqian was truly powerful enough to discover such a treasure, who could possibly challenge him? Pang Zui must have been exceptional. And Zhen Xing—was it another name for the Lost Continent?</p>\n<p>The last line urged him to assist the Zhen Xing cultivators, but what could he, a mere Transcending Mortality Stage cultivator, do against them?</p>\n<p>Shaking his head, Mo Wuji tossed the Immortal Seeking Token into his storage ring.</p>\n<p>\"Crack!\" A sharp sound rang out as the table, once intact, crumbled into ashes.</p>\n<p>Something strange was afoot. Puzzled, he surveyed his surroundings.</p>\n<p>Having achieved his goal, he decided to leave the sect and find Sang Yiping and the others to return to Tian Ji Sect. He had no intention of lingering in Heaven Seeking Palace.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji turned and sped down the staircase, ignoring the white jade slab meant for carving names. His purpose was not fame but to challenge the staircase. Despite not advancing to the Yuan Dan Stage, he had opened his 102nd meridian.</p>\n<p>As he descended, the pressure from the staircase vanished. In mere moments, he reached the bottom.</p>\n<p>The sky began to brighten, and he hurried to the Sect Hall of Affairs.</p>\n<p>The Hall was quiet, a stark contrast to its earlier bustle, with only a few disciples on duty.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji approached the outer disciple’s administrative area, where a one-eyed old man sat reading. He knocked on the window, presenting his outer disciple identity token. \"Apprentice brother, I would like to start the sect leaving process.\"</p>\n<p>The old man nearly dropped his book, his hands trembling. \"You want to start the sect leaving process?\"</p>\n<p>With a smile, Mo Wuji replied, \"Yes, I really want to start the process. Do I need to provide anything else?\"</p>\n<p>The old man shook his head, \"No need.\"</p>\n<p>While entering Heaven Seeking Palace was challenging, leaving was relatively simple. Only legacy disciples with exceptional talent required their summit lord to be informed. Outer disciples merely needed to surrender their identity tokens.</p>\n<p>\"Hey, your identity token still has 1,000 contribution points...\" the old man exclaimed.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji recalled that the points belonged to Cen Shuyin. As he was leaving, they would be wasted if discarded.</p>\n<p>\"Can these contribution points be transferred to someone else?\" he asked quickly.</p>\n<p>\"Sure, just tell me which disciple, and I’ll transfer them,\" the old man replied patiently.</p>\n<p>\"Please transfer them to Sword Lake’s legacy disciple, Cen Shuyin.\" He wanted to return the points to their rightful owner.</p>\n<p>The old man shook his head, thinking that even if Mo Wuji transferred 10,000 points to Cen Shuyin, she wouldn't know who he was.</p>\n<p>After a moment, the old man looked up. \"You’ve left the sect, so you need to exit immediately. If you don’t leave within six hours, the sect executioners will hunt you down.\"</p>\n<p>\"Thank you.\" Mo Wuji bowed respectfully, turning to leave without hesitation. He couldn't wait to depart from Heaven Seeking Palace.</p>\n<p>\"Special Envoy Xia? Why is he asking for me? I don’t even know him,\" Cen Shuyin frowned at the black-clothed youth before her. Among those from Zhen Mo Continent, she only remembered the black-haired, white-bearded expert. Special Envoy Xia was the purple-robed youth from the main altar, but what did that have to do with her?</p>\n<p>The black-robed youth grinned. \"I’m just a messenger. Perhaps Special Envoy Xia sees potential in you and might allow you to enter Star King Mountain.\"</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin's eyes sparkled with hope. She was deeply committed to her cultivation, having devoted herself entirely to sword dao since joining Heaven Seeking Palace's Sword Lake. She was willing to lower herself for her goals, having begged an outer disciple like Mo Wuji multiple times.</p>\n<p>Her efforts bore fruit. Lightning Flash not only boosted her contributions but also enabled her to defeat Tao Yuan.</p>\n<p>\"I heard Zhen Mo Continent’s cultivation culture is much stronger than the Lost Continent’s. Is that true?\" Cen Shuyin inquired, noting the black-robed youth's origins.</p>\n<p>The youth replied proudly, \"Absolutely. For cultivators of similar levels, Zhen Mo Continent surpasses all others. For instance, if I’m at the Great Circle of Transcending Mortality Stage, I doubt any other cultivator at that level could last more than half an incense's time against me.\"</p>",
