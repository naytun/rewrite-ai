  "body": "<p>The courage of the Hundred Sect Alliance cultivators flickered like a dying flame. They had fought valiantly, but as they witnessed 10,000 alien cultivators leaving the battlefield, a chill gripped their hearts. The sight of their comrades being mercilessly slaughtered drained their spirit and strength.</p>\n<p>The alien cultivators, too, paused in their relentless assault. They watched, cold and calculating, as their comrades executed the defeated Hundred Sect Alliance cultivators. No one was allowed to escape. The air was thick with the intent of complete annihilation.</p>\n<p>Both the Lost Continent cultivators and the alien forces understood the grim reality: this war was over. The Lost Continent would soon vanish, replaced by a new continent, one that would belong to the Floating Star.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, a flying ship surged into view. At its bow stood ten figures. Among them, a man with black hair and a white beard leaped from the ship, charging toward the alien cultivators.</p>\n<p>True God experts from the alien front stepped forward to confront him.</p>\n<p>\"Boom boom boom!\" Explosions of elemental energy erupted in the air. A few figures fell from the sky, lifeless.</p>\n<p>Gasps filled the air. The battlefield fell silent. One man had faced multiple True God experts, and in a mere moment, several had been killed. Was this a dream? When had the Lost Continent produced such a formidable expert?</p>\n<p>On a distant mountain, Mo Wuji gazed intently at the blood-soaked battlefield.</p>\n<p>\"Head senior brother, should I go take a look?\" Pu Qian asked, concern etched on his face.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji nodded. \"That sounds good. Take this flying ship and go over. If you encounter any trouble, return immediately.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\" Pu Qian took control of the flying ship, heading toward the Yin Tomb Beach.</p>\n<p>\"Yiping, tell me more about the Tian Ji Sect lands,\" Mo Wuji said, fiddling with a laser cannon's ammunition.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping nodded. \"The Tian Ji Sect is on the periphery of the Ming Han Empire. It forms a triangle with the Great Evolution Sect and the Heaven Seeking Palace. But many don’t even know we exist.\"</p>\n<p>\"Wasn’t the Ming Han Empire the first to fall to the alien cultivators? I heard Da Ke City has been occupied,\" Mo Wuji inquired.</p>\n<p>\"Da Ke City is indeed occupied, but the Ming Han Empire still exists. Our Tian Ji Sect remains unnoticed at the periphery. We occupy hundreds of square miles, with one main mountain and over a hundred secondary summits, all naturally formed. A river runs through the center, the Tian Ji River. We are a natural sect, unlike the Great Evolution Sect, which created many of their summits.\"</p>\n<p>\"With such a prime location, why didn’t the bigger sects seize it?\" Mo Wuji asked, puzzled.</p>\n<p>\"Though the Tian Ji Sect's environment is good, it’s barren spiritual land. Spiritual energy is sparse, and even with an energy gathering array, we can’t gather dense spiritual energy,\" Sang Yiping explained.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji realized the truth. A sect's purpose was to gather power, not merely to exist. Without suitable cultivation land, growth was impossible. The Lotus Sword Summit back in the Formless Blade Sect came to mind. The sparse spiritual energy around the Tian Ji Sect explained why other sects overlooked it.</p>\n<p>\"When we return, I’ll find ways to install a formation to protect the Tian Ji River and the mountain peaks. I’ll also rebuild the Tian Ji Summit,\" Mo Wuji declared. He was adept with arrays and possessed an impressive spiritual vein.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping shook her head. \"I’m afraid that’s not possible.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why?\" Mo Wuji asked, curious. Was the land so peculiar that a protective array couldn’t be established?</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping lowered her gaze. \"More than half of the secondary summits have been rented out. We only have the main summit and ten secondary summits left.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji was taken aback. A sect renting out its mountain summits? This was new to him.</p>\n<p>\"The Tian Ji Sect is so short of spirit stones?\" he asked, frowning. Even if a sect lacked resources, renting land seemed extreme.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping sighed. \"The renters are two major powers. One is the Ming Han Empire’s 14th prince, who controls the Ming Han - Tian Shang Alliance established on our land. It generates wealth for him and houses some of our desperate disciples. The second is a mountain fortress belonging to the Ming Han Empire’s 26th Prince, known for shady dealings. Our Tian Ji Sect hasn’t seen a single copper coin in rent.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji felt a deep lament for the Tian Ji Sect. A sect of cultivators caught in the grip of mortal princes, forced to rent their land. It was a humiliation beyond measure.</p>\n<p>\"The Ming Han Empire has many Earth Realm experts, while our Tian Ji Sect is merely a Xuan sect. We can’t fight back,\" Sang Yiping’s voice softened, revealing her own sense of injustice.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji opened his mouth to respond when Pu Qian’s flying ship trembled as it approached.</p>\n<p>Something was wrong. Mo Wuji quickly loaded the laser cannon ammunition. \"Everyone, take charge of a cannon. Face it toward Pu Qian’s ship and wait for my command.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\" Even without Mo Wuji’s orders, Sang Yiping and the others sensed the urgency. Pu Qian’s ship appeared damaged.</p>\n<p>Moments later, Pu Qian burst out, shouting, \"These people are animals! They’ve started genocides across many prefectures. Adults, children—anyone alive, they kill!\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji’s expression hardened, a wave of killing intent rising within him. Coming from Earth, he could not tolerate the senseless slaughter of innocents. These beings were worse than animals; animals killed only out of hunger.</p>\n<p>\"They’re here…\" Nie Zhengnong’s voice trembled.</p>\n<p>Ten flying ships blotted out the sky, each filled with cultivators. They radiated killing intent, bloodied and fierce, like demons risen from Hell.</p>\n<p>\"There are nearly 10,000 of them…\" Nie Zhengnong’s voice quaked. Zhuang Yan’s voice was unsteady, filled with dread.</p>\n<p>Could they survive such overwhelming odds?</p>\n<p>Pu Qian rushed back to the battleship. \"There are at least 10,000 of them, and a Nihility God expert among them. My ship was nearly destroyed!\"</p>\n<p>He suddenly recalled something. \"Head senior brother, I should have lured them away…\"</p>\n<p>They had a battleship and various cannons, but 10,000 was far too many. Even a few True Lake Stage experts could easily wipe them out.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji replied firmly, \"I wanted you to lure them here. Pu Qian, get to a laser cannon. When we fire, follow my command. Even if we die, we’ll take some of them with us.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes.\" The others felt a surge of confidence, hands readying their cannons. The sound of the alien ships grew louder. Mo Wuji’s spiritual will sharpened, allowing him to see the faces of the cultivators aboard.</p>\n<p>He raised his hand. \"Everyone, choose a flying ship. I’ll take the leading one. Fire!\"</p>\n<p>\"Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!\" Four shots rang out, each a different color, shaking the very fabric of space. The gunners were left in awe.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji’s laser cannon unleashed a blinding white light, revealing a faint black crevice. A sense of vastness emanated from it, causing him to shiver.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the crevice vanished quickly, leaving only destruction in its wake.</p>\n<p>The explosions lit up the sky, a terrifying fire consuming half of it. Mo Wuji and his companions were drenched in sweat, overwhelmed by the intensity.</p>\n<p>\"Head senior brother, what just happened? Why was there white light and fire?\" Sang Yiping’s voice trembled, fear evident.</p>\n<p>\"Should we keep firing?\" Zhuang Yan asked, her agitation clear. She sensed the destructive power of their cannons.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji inhaled sharply, contemplating. \"No need. I underestimated these cannons. We only needed one shot. I wasted three. Luckily, Pu Qian hasn’t fired yet.\"</p>\n<p>While the others were blinded, Mo Wuji’s spiritual will revealed the aftermath. Not only had the alien ships been destroyed, but the surrounding land had been turned to a molten sea.</p>\n<p>After a moment, the fire subsided, revealing a deep pool where the ships had once been.</p>\n<p>\"Did we destroy those flying ships?\" Zhuang Yan asked, astonished.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji nodded. \"Indeed. Not a trace remains. That pool is all that’s left from our cannons.\"</p>\n<p>They collectively gasped, staring at the emptiness. What a terrifying battleship. Even the Heaven Seeking Palace would fall before its might.</p>\n<p>\"So impressive,\" Pu Qian finally breathed, awe-struck.</p>",
