She remained silent, unsure of how to proceed.</p>\n<p>Granny Linglong, perceptive as ever, noticed Sang Yiping's desire to speak with Mo Wuji privately. \"My flying treasure has some issues,\" she stated. \"I need to go repair it.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji quickly retrieved the lavender plank and handed it to Granny Linglong. \"Senior, I found this floating in the sea. It has the Pill Pagoda mark.\"</p>\n<p>Granny Linglong accepted the plank with gratitude. \"Thank you. This belongs to me. Back in the Sky Sea, someone ambushed my flying treasure. With this, I can repair my ship faster. We can return together later.\"</p>\n<p>She moved aside to start fixing her treasure. Meanwhile, Pu Qian and Zhuang Yan took the opportunity to wait nearby. Mo Wuji planned to leave soon, but he wouldn’t abandon them.</p>\n<p>Once the trio departed, Sang Yiping and Nie Zhengnong suddenly knelt before Mo Wuji.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji was taken aback and stepped back. \"What’s the meaning of this? Please, get up.\"</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping remained on her knees, her voice pleading. \"Tian Ji Sect's Sang Yiping greets the sect head.\"</p>\n<p>Nie Zhengnong followed suit. \"Tian Ji Sect's Nie Zhengnong greets the sect head.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji sensed something was amiss. He was familiar with the Tian Ji Sect; his Immortal Mortal Technique came from there, and he held deep gratitude for it.</p>\n<p>\"Please, stand up and speak. There must be a mistake. I'm just a small outer disciple from the Heaven Seeking Palace, not your sect head,\" he insisted. He began to wonder if their kneeling was connected to the Immortal Mortal Technique.</p>\n<p>\"No,\" Sang Yiping replied, her head bowing lower. \"Before our previous sect head passed away, he designated you as our Tian Ji Sect's next sect head. May Senior Mo accept this designation.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji pulled them up, confusion etched on his face. \"Why? I don’t think I’ve even met your sect head. When discussing important matters, there’s no need to kneel.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" Sang Yiping inhaled deeply. \"A few months ago, our sect head received an invitation from Rogue Cultivator 2705…\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji's brow furrowed. \"Junior Sang, you know I'm Rogue Cultivator 2705, but I never invited your sect head for anything.\"</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping wiped a tear from her eye. \"I know, but our sect head believed it was you. He urgently sought you out and went to Yin Tomb Beach. After that, he never returned.\"</p>\n<p>\"Did you find out who did it?\" Mo Wuji's expression turned serious. He would not let anyone use his name to harm others.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping gritted her teeth. \"It was the Yu Lin Lei Clan…\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji's thoughts raced. Could this be connected to him?</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping continued, \"To find you, the Yu Lin Lei Clan searched all of Yan City. They noticed our Tian Ji Sect's ranking on the Contribution Point Board. We don’t have outstanding talent, so it was expected we wouldn’t appear on the rankings. But when you exchanged contribution points for something from our sect, our ranking rose rapidly. The Lei Clan discovered that rise…\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji understood the implications. The Yu Lin Lei Clan's greed was insatiable; they likely wanted to force the Tian Ji Sect to reveal what he had exchanged for. They might even use the sect to track him down.</p>\n<p>\"I never expected the Yu Lin Lei Clan to be so shameless,\" he sighed. \"If they wanted to find me, your Tian Ji Sect would naturally know.\"</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping's resolve was firm. \"Even if we did, our sect head would never reveal anything. Our teaching is: our disciples will stand till death. No Tian Ji Sect disciple kneels while alive.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji felt a surge of respect for the Tian Ji Sect. In the world of cultivation, many sects betrayed their own. It took immense courage to uphold such a principle.</p>\n<p>\"After the Lei Clan killed our sect head, they secretly attacked the Tian Ji Sect encampment, leading to our destruction. Perhaps only the two of us remain.\"</p>\n<p>\"What?\" Mo Wuji's heart ignited with anger.</p>\n<p>If the Yu Lin Lei Clan had killed the Tian Ji Sect's head and destroyed the sect, they were truly despicable. He had to help the Tian Ji Sect seek vengeance. His actions in Yan City had drawn the Lei Clan's wrath upon them.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping clenched her fist. \"Before this, the First Elder predicted the Yu Lin Lei Clan might extinguish our sect. To prepare, we dispersed our talents to train. If the sect was destroyed, we would follow the sect head’s wishes and find you to appoint you as the next sect head, ensuring our heritage wouldn’t be lost.\"</p>\n<p>She bowed deeply, this time not kneeling.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji realized he had been chosen to inherit this role because of the Immortal Mortal Technique, not because he was Rogue Cultivator 2705.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping's eyes glistened with tears. \"Our sect head knew the Immortal Mortal Technique is extraordinary. He believed there must be a reason you exchanged so many contribution points for it. If you can cultivate with that technique, it makes sense for you to be our sect head. He said you are a dragon among men, hiding among mortals. Our Tian Ji Sect might not catch your eye…\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji raised his hand, stopping her. \"Junior Sang, you don’t need to flatter me. I’ve decided to accept this role. From today, the Tian Ji Sect’s heritage will not be broken. I will personally seek vengeance for the destruction of the Tian Ji Sect.\"</p>\n<p>The connection between him and the Tian Ji Sect was clear. He was willing to be their sect head solely for revenge.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping and Nie Zhengnong brightened, especially Sang Yiping. She saw Mo Wuji's talent, but he chose to hide among rogue cultivators. It wasn’t for lack of ambition. When she explained her reasons, he agreed without hesitation.</p>\n<p>In the outside world, Rogue Cultivator 2705 was hailed as a hero for his sense of justice and kindness. It seemed to be true.</p>\n<p>\"Sang Yiping, Nie Zhengnong greets the sect head.\" They began to kneel again, but Mo Wuji raised his hands to stop them.</p>\n<p>\"From now on, besides closed ones and masters, our Tian Ji Sect disciples will never kneel.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes,\" they replied eagerly.</p>\n<p>In truth, a cultivator should kneel for no one but their closest and masters.</p>\n<p>\"Sect head…\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji interrupted, \"Just call me head senior brother. It sounds much closer.\"</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping quickly responded, \"Yes, senior apprentice brother. This is the sect head token of our Tian Ji Sect. The sect head's Tian Ji Sword disappeared with him.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji took the token, feeling a chill seep into his hand. It appeared completely white, yet he sensed an image hidden within. Even with his spiritual will, he couldn’t discern it clearly.</p>\n<p>After storing the token, Mo Wuji turned to the sea, his voice steady. \"One day, I will reclaim the sect head's sword from the Lei Clan.\"</p>\n<p>Granny Linglong was still busy repairing her treasure, so Mo Wuji approached Pu Qian and Zhuang Yan.</p>\n<p>\"Brother Pu, Junior Zhuang, what are your plans now?\" Mo Wuji asked, feeling comfortable enough to speak directly.</p>\n<p>\"I plan to find a sect and see if I can become an inner disciple,\" Zhuang Yan replied.</p>\n<p>Zhuang Yan was unwilling to return home after Qi Wenxuan's betrayal.</p>\n<p>Pu Qian chuckled. \"Even though I didn’t obtain the immortal estate, I gained a friend in Brother Mo. I wonder where you’ll go next; you seem familiar with that senior.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji didn’t reveal that the senior was Granny Linglong. He didn’t want to complicate things for Pu Qian and Zhuang Yan.</p>\n<p>\"The Tian Ji Sect was destroyed because of me. I vow to rebuild it and take revenge. If you’re willing, join me in the Tian Ji Sect,\" he stated plainly, feeling a bond with them.</p>\n<p>Pu Qian was taken aback. \"Brother Mo, to be a sect head or elder, you must be appointed. It’s not enough that you want to rebuild the Tian Ji Sect.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji held up his sect head token. \"Brother Pu, I am already the Tian Ji Sect Head. This was the previous sect head's wish. If you join, I will be your head senior brother. If not, you can leave with that senior, and we’ll still be friends.\"</p>\n<p>Pu Qian clasped his fists, determination in his eyes. \"Pu Qian is willing to join the Tian Ji Sect. Greetings, head senior brother.\"</p>\n<p>Zhuang Yan followed suit. \"I will join Brother Pu in the Tian Ji Sect. Greetings, head senior brother!\"</p>",
