  "body": "<p>Mo Wuji and his companions approached the entrance, their eyes drawn to a flattened boulder. Just a few meters ahead loomed a massive black door, its material a mystery.</p>\n<p>Underwater, Pu Qian and the others perceived the door as solid rock. Yet, only Mo Wuji's spiritual will could detect the small gap nestled in the center of it.</p>\n<p>He raised a hand, signaling Pu Qian and the others to pause. With careful steps, he approached the door and pushed it gently. Channeling more elemental energy, he nudged it open, revealing a steady movement.</p>\n<p>A brilliant beam of golden light burst forth, stunning Mo Wuji and his companions. Before them lay a vast hall, its walls adorned with gleaming golden inlays that radiated opulence.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji waved to Sang Yiping and the others, stepping forward as the first to enter.</p>\n<p>As he crossed the threshold, the immense water pressure vanished, replaced by an astonishing dryness. It felt as if he had stepped into a mythical Dragon Palace, where water flowed outside but could not breach the colossal door.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping and the others followed, experiencing the same relief. She instinctively gazed upward at a luminous pearl hanging above the door. \"This must be a Water Dispelling Pearl, keeping the seawater at bay,\" she remarked.</p>\n<p>The group stared at the pearl, their minds racing with thoughts of its value. A single Water Dispelling Pearl could surpass even the finest spiritual items.</p>\n<p>\"Could there truly be an immortal estate here?\" Sang Yiping's voice trembled with excitement. The presence of the pearl hinted at something extraordinary.</p>\n<p>\"The concentration of spiritual energy is remarkable,\" Pu Qian added, his enthusiasm palpable. He had never encountered such a rich aura since he began his cultivation journey. If this was just the entrance, he could only imagine the treasures that awaited deeper within.</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping's face lit up with anticipation as she turned to Mo Wuji. \"Head senior brother, what should we do?\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji's spiritual will swept across the hall. \"We won't know if this is an immortal estate until we explore further. However, that pearl isn't a Water Dispelling Pearl; it's merely an illumination array. The water's absence is due to a water-dispelling array inside.\"</p>\n<p>Disappointment washed over the group at his revelation.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji chuckled, \"Even if there's nothing here, the spiritual energy makes this a prime spot for cultivation. Let's investigate.\"</p>\n<p>They moved deeper into the lavish hall, where inscriptions caught their attention. \"So what if youâ€™ve gotten an immortal estate? So what? So what?\"</p>\n<p>The repetition of \"So what?\" left them puzzled.</p>\n<p>\"Is this really an immortal estate? Have we entered one?\" Sang Yiping's astonishment was evident.</p>\n<p>Even the usually quiet Nie Zhengnong was captivated, marveling at his fortune to follow Mo Wuji into this place.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji sighed, \"This must be where the immortal estate's inheritance took place. Unfortunately, we are merely standing in the hall. The true estate has likely been claimed long ago. Look here.\"</p>\n<p>He pointed to the floor, where faint footprints formed a circle around a dust-free square in the center.</p>\n<p>\"Are you saying the immortal estate was in the middle? People walked in circles before entering it? But where is the estate now?\" Sang Yiping asked, her curiosity piqued.</p>\n<p>Pu Qian chimed in, \"I've read that top-grade treasures possess consciousness. They recognize their owners and leave with them. Perhaps the immortal estate departed with its new master.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji pondered this, uncertain about the workings of an immortal estate.</p>\n<p>\"What a pity,\" Sang Yiping lamented, frustration evident in her voice. \"We find ourselves in a hall that looks magnificent due to an illumination array, yet we leave empty-handed.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji scrutinized the footprints, deducing they belonged to two individuals. He wished fervently that they were from Mo Xiangtong and Aunt Eleven.</p>\n<p>\"We might not be leaving empty-handed. Look, there's another door,\" he announced, rising to investigate the right side of the hall.</p>\n<p>He pushed against an unmarked wall, revealing a small door.</p>\n<p>As they stepped through, they were taken aback to find a small bedroom. A bed lay in the center, upon which rested a dried corpse. In front of it were a leather roll, a ring, and a crystal-clear jade seal.</p>\n<p>Beside the bed stood shelves made of an unknown material, filled with an array of jade vases.</p>\n<p>Confusion swept through the group. Could this corpse have been cultivating here?</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji approached, retrieving the leather roll, ring, and jade seal. The words on the roll were clear and legible.</p>\n<p>\"Some Jing Gumu fought with over ten experts from the Zhen Mo Continent for the Six Cleanse Immortal Estate before escaping to the Sky Sea, burdened and weary. He landed on Sky Gourd Island to recuperate. After recovering, the Six Cleanse Immortal Estate proved useless to him. What was the point of such a struggle?</p>\n<p>Years of closed cultivation brought him to his limit. Reflecting on the past, he felt a deep sadness. He had no fate with the Six Cleanse Immortal Estate, so it remained in the hall for those with destiny. Those who enter this small room, please take everything. The jade seal can ignite the immortal estate. With a drop of blood, it can recognize its owner. My remains shall not be disturbed...\"</p>\n<p>\"I know who this Jing Gumu is,\" Sang Yiping exclaimed after reading the leather roll.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji turned to her, intrigued. \"Who is he?\"</p>\n<p>\"He was the sect head of the Heaven Sect. I've heard he collected rare treasures from heaven and earth, pursuing anything precious with fervor...\"</p>\n<p>\"Ah, Jing Gumu?\" Pu Qian interjected, recognition dawning.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji pressed on, \"Is this Jing Gumu well-known? Why haven't I heard of the Heaven Sect?\"</p>\n<p>Sang Yiping explained, \"The Heaven Sect was once the largest sect in the Five Big Empires. Even the current Heaven Seeking Palace might not surpass it. Jing Gumu was rumored to have reached the late stage of the heaven realm, the only expert in the Five Big Empires to do so. However, he was reclusive and arrogant, leading to a downfall after his sudden disappearance.\"</p>\n<p>\"Why did the Heaven Seeking Palace seek to remove the Heaven Sect?\" Mo Wuji asked.</p>\n<p>\"I've heard the name Heaven Sect was a taboo for the Heaven Seeking Palace. One represents Heaven, while the other seeks it, a clear hierarchy. When Jing Gumu was alive, they dared not speak out. But after he vanished, they showed no restraint,\" Sang Yiping clarified.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji nodded, placing the items back where he found them. \"Let's discuss this outside.\"</p>\n<p>The four of them followed Mo Wuji, who not only left the pills untouched but also returned the items he had taken.</p>\n<p>Once outside the small room, Mo Wuji began, \"From the message left by the Heaven Sect's sect head, we can infer several things. First, moving forward from this Sky Sea leads to the Zhen Mo Continent. Second, Jing Gumu, despite being at the late stage of the True God Stage, was severely injured there, indicating many powerful experts reside in the Zhen Mo Continent. Third, the message outside the immortal estate was likely penned by Jing Gumu. Lastly, the Sky Gourd Island may have sunk because someone took the immortal estate. Perhaps Jing Gumu set up the defenses to prevent disturbances.\"</p>\n<p>Pu Qian nodded in agreement with Mo Wuji's deductions.</p>\n<p>Yet, Mo Wuji's brow furrowed as he posed a question. \"Did you notice a few underlying issues?\"</p>\n<p>\"What issues?\" Sang Yiping and the others asked in unison.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji pointed to the hidden room, \"Firstly, the jade seal mentioned by Jing Gumu to ignite the immortal estate remains here, yet the estate itself is missing. If it wasn't ignited, how could it be gone? Secondly, Jing Gumu escaped to recuperate here, but who distributed the sea maps of the immortal estate? Lastly, if people could locate the immortal estate, how could they overlook the room where Jing Gumu lay?\"</p>\n<p>As he spoke, a chill ran through Mo Wuji. If Aunt Eleven and Mo Xiangtong had indeed taken the immortal estate, it was possible they had missed Jing Gumu's room. Neither had cultivated before and were likely unaware of the cultivator's door Dao. Yet, the jade seal remained, raising questions about how they could have taken the estate.</p>",
