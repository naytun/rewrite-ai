  "body": "<p>Cen Shuyin jolted, surprise flashing across her face. Special Envoy Xia had asked about her dao companion. Such a question felt intrusive, a private matter that was none of his concern.</p>\n<p>\"If you're unwilling to answer, I might think your words are just a stall. Don't tell me my appearance is too lacking for Junior Shuyin,\" Xia Mu's smile vanished, replaced by a cold tone.</p>\n<p>Rage simmered within him. He had never been treated this way. As a proud child of Star King Mountain, he was revered across Zhen Mo Continent. Yet here, in this wretched Lost Continent, he faced rejection twice. Did they think him a timid herbivore who wouldn’t retaliate?</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin stood close, feeling the weight of Xia Mu's killing intent. A sense of forlornness enveloped her. Since entering the Heaven Seeking Palace and becoming the Sword Lake Master, no one had dared to covet her beauty. This distinction made her exceptional, not just in the palace but across the Five Great Empires.</p>\n<p>Now, however, Xia Mu's threat loomed over her. She felt helpless, lamenting her fate's cruel twist. The absence of her Master Shen Kongjian in the alien battlefield weighed heavily on her heart.</p>\n<p>\"Ha ha…\" Feng Zhenqiu chuckled, clasping his fists. \"Special Envoy Xia, don’t be quick to anger. I know this child, Shuyin. She’s shy. If not for your question, she wouldn’t even mention her dao companion. Few know of him, but I happen to be one.\"</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin stared at Feng Zhenqiu, astonished. She had no dao companion; her words were merely a ruse to mislead Xia Mu.</p>\n<p>Before Xia Mu could respond, Feng Zhenqiu continued, \"In fact, Special Envoy Xia knows his name.\"</p>\n<p>\"I do? Who?\" Xia Mu's surprise was palpable as he turned to Feng Zhenqiu. He had suspected Cen Shuyin was stalling, but now, with Feng Zhenqiu's intervention, he was intrigued.</p>\n<p>\"He's a rogue cultivator, known as Rogue Cultivator 2705. He moves in secrecy. Even Cen Shuyin wouldn’t know his whereabouts,\" Feng Zhenqiu chuckled.</p>\n<p>Rogue Cultivator 2705 had only shown himself once, then vanished. The Heaven Seeking Palace and Great Evolution Sect had searched for him in vain. Using this rogue cultivator's name was a clever way to stall Xia Mu.</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin's heart sank. Though grateful for Feng Zhenqiu's help, she felt guilty for dragging another into danger. She had never met Rogue Cultivator 2705. If Xia Mu found him, he would surely perish within an incense's time.</p>\n<p>She understood Feng Zhenqiu's intentions; he believed Xia Mu would never locate Rogue Cultivator 2705. But certainty was a dangerous illusion.</p>\n<p>Guilt and discomfort filled Cen Shuyin. She had always cultivated with a pure heart. While Feng Zhenqiu's words had saved her, they left a scar on her conscience.</p>\n<p>If Rogue Cultivator 2705 were harmed because of her, her lifelong pursuit of the greater dao would be shattered. Even if he survived, the guilt would haunt her. Her nature wouldn’t allow such a burden; her dao could not bear it.</p>\n<p>Because of this, when she exchanged skills with an outer disciple, she always offered her best.</p>\n<p>Dean Feng's words were unassailable. To refute him would risk Xia Mu's wrath against Dean Feng.</p>\n<p>If only she could turn back time. She would have claimed she had no dao companion. Saying she had one only implicated others.</p>\n<p>Xia Mu furrowed his brows, deep in thought. \"I remember now; isn’t he at the top of the Hundred Sect Alliance's Contribution Point Board?\"</p>\n<p>Feng Zhenqiu quickly added, \"Exactly. Though his talents are exceptional, he shuns the constraints of a sect. That’s why he chose the rogue path. With his caliber, he wouldn’t be easily impressed by any sect. Naturally, his standards for women are high.\"</p>\n<p>Feng Zhenqiu implied that Rogue Cultivator 2705 and the stunning Cen Shuyin were a perfect match.</p>\n<p>Xia Mu regained his composure, turning to Cen Shuyin. \"You should find Rogue Cultivator 2705. Such talent shouldn’t go to waste on this continent.\"</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin fell silent. She couldn’t explain that Feng Zhenqiu was mistaken, nor could she admit that Rogue Cultivator 2705 was her dao companion.</p>\n<p>\"Shuyin, you may leave. If you can contact him, extend the special envoy's invitation. But ultimately, it’s his choice to come to Zhen Mo Continent,\" Feng Zhenqiu interjected, eager for her to exit. Prolonging this conversation might provoke Xia Mu into violence.</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin bowed to Feng Zhenqiu and turned to leave when Defender Xu suddenly asked, \"What’s the cultivation level of this Rogue Cultivator 2705?\"</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin halted. How could she know? She had never met him. She had heard rumors of him being in the Transcending Mortality Stage, but she doubted them. Even a lucky Transcending Mortality Stage cultivator wouldn’t reach the top spot.</p>\n<p>Great Evolution Sect Head, Jiang Xiushan, came to her aid. \"Defender Xu, it’s rumored that Rogue Cultivator 2705 is in the Transcending Mortality Stage. He’s a pale-faced scholar, not highly cultivated, yet his true power is remarkable. During the initial wars with the alien cultivators, he faced over a hundred of them and annihilated them all. He even killed a half-step Nihility God Stage expert.\"</p>\n<p>What began as a casual question shocked Defender Xu, who stood up, his voice rising. \"Is he truly that impressive? Are these just rumors?\"</p>\n<p>Jiang Xiushan nodded vigorously. \"These aren’t mere rumors. Many have heard him acknowledge it. He killed a clan member of my Great Evolution Sect's legacy disciple. The Nihility God Stage expert he defeated was already gravely injured.\"</p>\n<p>Defender Xu nodded, impressed. \"If we find him, we must bring him to Zhen Mo Continent. Such talent is essential for Star King Mountain.\"</p>\n<p>Special Envoy Xia quickly added, \"Rest assured, Defender Xu. I will find Rogue Cultivator 2705 and ensure his talent isn’t wasted.\"</p>\n<p>From a distance, Gu Shaoyin smirked. Even if surrounded by a hundred cultivators, no one could kill them all. Rogue Cultivator 2705 was likely a fabrication, a morale booster for the Lost Continent. Why didn’t he dare show himself? Because he was a mere myth.</p>\n<p>Cen Shuyin felt contempt. Defender Xu sought Rogue Cultivator 2705 out of admiration, but Xia Mu's intentions were far from kind.</p>\n<p>\"Seniors, Shuyin will take her leave.\" After clasping her hands again, Cen Shuyin exited the main altar. She resolved to return to the Heaven Seeking Palace Sword Lake and enter closed-door cultivation. So what if she couldn’t go to Zhen Mo Continent? Her master had reached the True God Stage on the Lost Continent. She could do the same.</p>\n<p>After an incense's time, a red-faced man whispered to Xia Mu, \"Cen Shuyin has left Yan City alone. She’s likely gone to find that Rogue Cultivator 2705.\"</p>\n<p>At the selection, Stage Number 5 showcased a battle between two Yuan Dan Stage cultivators, captivating everyone. Xia Mu's gaze remained fixed on Stage Number 5 as he commanded, \"Follow her and do it.\"</p>\n<p>The red-faced man didn’t respond immediately. He lingered behind Xia Mu for a moment before departing as if nothing had happened.</p>\n<p>\"Why are you following too?\" The red-faced man noticed Gu Shaoyin trailing him.</p>\n<p>\"Elder Ceng, I want to see if Rogue Cultivator 2705 is truly remarkable or just a fabrication,\" Gu Shaoyin replied with a bow.</p>\n<p>The red-faced man chuckled. \"That’s fine; follow me.\"</p>\n<p>Some tasks were challenging for him. Thankfully, this fool, obsessed with cultivation, would handle it. He knew Gu Shaoyin well; strength was his sole pursuit. Hearing about Rogue Cultivator 2705 piqued his interest. If he didn’t see it for himself, he wouldn’t be satisfied.</p>\n<p>If he weren’t so single-minded, he wouldn’t have followed them from Zhen Mo Continent to the Lost Continent.</p>\n<p>The long war had dulled the vibrancy of Heaven Seeking City. Even after the conflict ended, the city hadn’t regained its former liveliness.</p>\n<p>As Mo Wuji stepped into Heaven Seeking City, he was met with cold, empty streets.</p>\n<p>\"Head senior brother…\" Upon reaching the Immortal Training Inn, he spotted Pu Qian loitering at the entrance, his voice tinged with anxiety.</p>\n<p>\"This isn’t a good place to talk. Let’s go inside,\" Mo Wuji suggested, leading Pu Qian into the inn.</p>\n<p>In the spacious room, Sang Yiping, Zhuang Yan, and Nie Zhengnong awaited him. Their expressions hinted that something significant had occurred.</p>\n<p>Seeing Mo Wuji return, they sighed in relief and stood to greet him.</p>",
