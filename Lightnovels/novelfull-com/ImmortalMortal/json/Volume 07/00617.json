He was a peak Immortal Emperor, did he need to ‘request’ for a pill refiner who was not even at the Immortal King Stage to do something?</p><p>However, he was helpless as Mo Wuji did not seem to place a regional tyrant like him in his eyes. Even though the other party's cultivation wasn't high, as a Pill Emperor, Mo Wuji did have the qualifications to use the word 'request’. As he thought of this, Zhuo Pingan calmed down; his tone was tranquil as he said, \"That's right. I'm requesting for you to concoct the Seven Runes Glimpsing Pill for me.\"</p><p>The way he said 'request’ was especially jarring.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not mind Zhuo Pingan's attitude. It was true that an Immortal Emperor was a peak existence. However, there were still several other Immortal Emperors. On the other hand, he, Mo Wuji, was the one and only cultivator without spiritual roots. His existence was no less unique to an Immortal Emperor, and moreover, he was the a Honored Grade Tier 7 Pill Emperor. That was an existence which was even rarer than an Immortal Emperor.</p><p>\"Why should I concoct the pill for you?\" Mo Wuji furrowed his brows slightly. Supposedly, he shouldn't be the one asking this question; Zhuo Pingan should have taken the initiative to suggest a remuneration and they would negotiate.</p><p>However, he never thought that this fella would be so thick-skinned, to not mention anything about remunerations. Did this fella think that it would be an honor for Mo Wuji to concoct a pill for a Grand Emperor like him? Mo Wuji didn't need this kind of bullsh*t honor.</p><p>Indeed, when he heard Mo Wuji's words, Zhuo Pingan's face sunk; the malicious intent in his heart threatened to explode once more. It was just as Mo Wuji expected, he had never unintended to offer Mo Wuji any form of remuneration. At the most, he could allow Mo Wuji to use his name.</p><p>\"Da Huang, prepare to fight. We will try to leave immediately.\" When Mo Wuji felt Zhuo Pingan's anger and malicious intent, he was also ruffled.</p><p>He did not come here to please Zhuo Pingan, but to have a mutual negotiation. It could even be said that he came to offer help. But this old thing seemed to constantly want to his power to threaten him. Even he, Mo Wuji, had limits to his patience.</p><p>\"Pill Master Mo, what do you mean by that? Why aren't you willing to concoct pills for me?\" Zhuo Pingan opened his palm and that folding fan appeared in his palm. At the same time, his domain started to extend outwards. However, he did not merely use his domain and his aura this time, his heavy killing intent also swept towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>A Grand Emperor had a Grand Emperor's pride. Did this mere ant think that it was very impressive because it had an immortal puppet? Today, his, Zhuo Pingan's, patience had been pushed to the limits. It was his first time speaking with such patience to an ant, but he never expected this ant to think that it was on top of the entire world because of an immortal puppet.</p><p>Mo Wuji directly retreated to the entrance of the staircase and said coldly, \"Who do you think you are? Why must I concoct pills for you? Da Huang, fight.\"</p><p>Zhuo Pingan didn't lay his hands on Mo Wuji, he merely wanted to his killing intent to suppress Mo Wuji. He didn't think that Mo Wuji didn't even fear him and even took the initiative to attack.</p><p>Da Huang had already released its punch; minute tears began to appear in the space around it. Its immortal elemental energy exploded violently, causing the protective array within this room to make ricketing and cracking noises.</p><p>A simple punch had directly sealed this area in space.</p><p>Han Long, who actually wanted to help, immediately felt difficulty breathing. She anxiously retreated, her heart was in aghast. Previously, she thought that as an Immortal King, she would at least be able to offer a bit of help. But the moment Da Huang came with this punch, she knew that in the battle between Immortal Emperor level experts, she didn't even have the rights to intervene.</p><p>However, the next scene left Han Long stunned. Supposedly, if she didn't have the rights to intervene, then Mo Wuji should have even lesser rights. However, Mo Wuji was actually standing beside Da Huang as it attacked. Not only that, he even wielded his saber and slashed towards Zhuo Pingan.</p><p>Mo Wuji's cultivation was clearly much lower than hers… However, when she thought about how Mo Wuji was able to advance from a Tier 6 Pill King to a Tier 7 Pill Emperor in merely have a year, and that Mo Wuji was able to concoct such a unique Draining Immortal King Pill, Han Long came to an understanding. A person like Mo Wuji should not be judged using conventional means.</p><p>There was no need to talk about how Mo Wuji could advance to Tier 7 Pill Emperor in such a short time, just the fact that Mo Wuji dared to remain so calm on front of a powerhouse like Zhuo Pingan was something that she, Han Long, wouldn't be able to do.</p><p>If Han Long's heart was pounding in astonishment, then Zhuo Pingan's heart was reverberating in shock.</p><p>Han Long only saw Mo Wuji slashing his saber. But she didn't know that Mo Wuji's domain was able to merge with Da Huang's domain, creating a whirlpool effect that suppressed Zhuo Pingan's domain.</p><p>More importantly, that slash of Mo Wuji's was like a winding river cascading from the Heavens. That incomparably tyrannical killing intent left a deep impression in Zhuo Pingan. This slash did not pose a threat to him now, but if this slash continued to grow, then there will come a day when he will no longer be able to defend against this slash. This slash encompassed a natural killing aura, and from the looks of it, it was a prelude of a more powerful slash.</p><p>This thought only fleeted across Zhuo Pingan's head. He immediately half-opened his folding fan, and similarly, he swept up a heaven shaking wave of force which boomed towards Da Huang's punch. As for Mo Wuji's slash, he didn't care about it. That slash was very strong, but its strength came in its potential. But now, this saber wasn't of any threat to him.</p><p>\"Boom!\" The two juggernauts of elemental energy slammed against each other in this tiny building. Rips appeared in the space between them. It was as though firecrackers had exploded within the room as the room began to fall apart. Indeed, it was as Zhuo Pingan had predicted, Mo Wuji's slash was like an ocean, but it didn't cause a splash.</p><p>Zhuo Pingan lightly waved his folding fan. Soon, the crumbling room reverted back to its original appearance, as though no explosion had happened.</p><p>\"Let's go Da Huang.\" Da Huang seemed to be raring to fight but Mo Wuji extended his arm and stopped it. He could tell that Da Huang was slightly weaker than Zhuo Pingan. If Zhuo Pingan really went all out, he would still be able to escape, but Da Huang would definitely be reduced to shreds.</p><p>Zhuo Pingan didn't continue either. He also knew that with this immortal puppet, it did not seem possible for him to keep Mo Wuji. The only possibility was that as he was destroying Da Huang, Mo Wuji would use that opportunity to escape.</p><p>This would be of no benefit to him at all. There was no need to say how Mo Wuji's future was bright and limitless, he would be losing out if he offended such a fella with potential. Moreover, Mo Wuji was the Tier 7 Pill Emperor that he was searching all over for.</p><p>\"Pill Master Mo, I was too reckless. I, Zhuo Pingan, would like to apologize.\" Zhuo Pingan threw away his pride and clasped his fists towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>If Da Huang was the one suppressing Zhuo Pingan in the previous battle, Mo Wuji would not hesitate to leave even if Zhuo Pingan apologized. But in reality, during that exchange, even though he had helped, Da Huang was still in the losing end.</p><p>If he were to leave now, Zhuo Pingan should not continue to stop him, but how was he going to deal with Lun Cai? If Da Huang wasn't able to defeat Zhuo Pingan, then it also shouldn't be able to trump over Lun Cai. Mo Wuji did not wish for Da Huang to be destroyed in a skirmish with Lun Cai. Thus, after Zhuo Pingan apologized, Mo Wuji also stopped. He clasped his fists in return, \"Dao Friend Zhuo was too serious. I can here to offer help to Dao Friend Zhuo help. How could I have known that Dao Friend Zhuo looks down on me.\"</p><p>How could Zhuo Pingan, this cunning fella, not know that Mo Wuji was here to negotiate for his protection. His original intention was to simply lend Mo Wuji his name. But now, he could tell that he wasn't even able to keep Mo Wuji here, so he could only say, \"Pill Master Mo, let's start on a clean slate. I have the Seven Runes Glimpsing Pill Formula here, can Pill Master Mo take a look and see whether you are able to concoct it?\"</p><p>With that Zhuo Pingan already fetched a jade letter and handed it to Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji waved his hand and said, \"Let's temporarily not talk about the pill formula. As long as it's a Tier 7 Pill, I will definitely be able to make it. If Dao Friend Zhuo doesn't believe me, you can take a look at this Green Bodhi Pill.\"</p><p>When he finished speaking, Mo Wuji retrieved a Green Bodhi Pill and threw it to Zhuo Pingan. If he saw the formula and didn't come to an agreement with Zhuo Pingan, then things would be bad.</p><p>The moment the Green Bodhi Pill entered Zhuo Pingan's hand, a trace of agitation appeared on his face. The Green Bodhi Pill was a pill that he used and saw frequently. The pill that Mo Wuji took out was completely perfect; and this was even his first time seeing such a fresh unique grade Green Bodhi Pill.</p><p>Zhuo Pingan very seriously handed the pill back to Mo Wuji and he asked in a low tone, \"Pill Master Mo, if you have any conditions, say them. If I, Zhuo Pingan, am able to do it, I will definitely offer my help.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji nodded; now that's the way. If you had such an attitude from the start, wouldn't things have been much faster?</p><p>\"Let me first tell you what I can do. Firstly, I can definitely be able to concoct at least a Four Runes Glimpsing Pill. However, I estimate that the actual pill that I concoct would be have Five Runes. Secondly, twenty years later, I promise Dao Friend Zhuo that I would be able to concoct a true Seven Runes Glimpsing Pill.\"</p><p>He did not see the Seven Runes Glimpsing Pill Formula, but he did know about the Heavenly Desolate Grass and the Heavenly Nature Grass. The Heavenly Desolate Grass is an extremely difficult immortal herb to purify, so it's expected that other pill refiners weren't able to purify out the Heavenly Nature Grass. At the same time, Mo Wuji was very confident with his own Pill Dao. He believed that if other Pill Emperors were able to concoct a Four Runes Glimpsing Pill, then he would definitely be able to do it too.</p><p>The reason why he estimated that he was able to concoct a Five Runes Glimpsing Pill was because Mo Wuji did not think that those pill refiners only managed to concoct the Four Runes one because they weren't able to get the Heavenly Desolate Grass to a purity of 90% and above. When the Heavenly Desolate Grass was purified to above 90%, it would become the Heavenly Nature Grass.</p><p>\"You're able to concoct a Seven Runes Glimpsing Pill twenty years later?\" Zhuo Pingan was truly emotional this time. If Mo Wuji was able to concoct the true Seven Runes Glimpsing Pill twenty years later, then he would be willing to promise anything. No, there's no need to talk about twenty years, even if it was a century, or two centuries, he would be willing to wait.</p><p>Mo Wuji said calmly, \"That's right. I am sure that I will be able to concoct the Seven Runes Glimpsing Pill twenty years later. The condition is that you follow me for the twenty years. If anyone is blind enough to do anything to me, then you will need to help me discipline that person.\"</p><p>Zhuo Pingan did not hesitate to say, \"As long as you are able to concoct a Glimpsing Pill with four runes or above right now, I believe that you will be able to concoct the Seven Runes Glimpsing Pill twenty years later. I, Zhuo Pingan, will be willing to follow you for twenty years, but the premise is that I will not follow you to take your revenge. I will only appear when someone lays his hands on you. I also wouldn't help you if you offend go about offending people for no apparent reason.\"</p><p>Zhuo Pingan was, after all, an Immortal Emperor; he had his own sense of discernment. If Mo Wuji randomly offended people everywhere he went, then how many enemies would he, Zhuo Pingan, have to accumulate? Even if he managed to get the Seven Runes Glimpsing Pill twenty years later, it would still be a loss. Thus, he definitely needed to make things clear now.</p><p>Mo Wuji chuckled, \"If I, Mo Wuji, want revenge, I also wouldn't want for you to interfere. I only need for you to tell me if you can do this. Even if no one comes to offend me throughout this twenty years, and even if you never made a move at all, our transaction will still conclude.\"</p><p>\"Alright, deal.\" Zhuo Pingan lifted his hand and a spiritual will imprint appeared in mid air. Then he stared at Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not form his own imprint to merge with Zhuo Pingan's. Instead, he waved his hand and dispersed Zhuo Pingan's spiritual will imprint, then he said calmly, \"Gentlemen’s agreements are as clear as water. I believe Dao Friend Zhuo, and Dao Friend Zhuo must have trust in me too.\"</p><p>\"Hahahaha! Then I, Zhuo Pingan, will trust you this once!\"</p><p>\"Since that's the case, then may Dao Friend Zhuo please take out the pill formula. I will attempt to concoct the Seven Runes Glimpsing Pill now.\" Mo Wuji said on the spot.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
