Honored Grade Tier 5 Pill King?\" Zhuo Pingan’s gaze landed on Mo Wuji. As for Han Long and Da Huang, he acted as though he didn’t notice them.</p><p>Mo Wuji lifted his hand and brought out two stone stools and he first said to Han Long, \"Han Long, first take a seat. The host doesn’t have the habit of treating his guests with courtesy but we can’t allow ourselves to suffer.\"</p><p>\"I’m fine standing.\" Han Long wasn’t as bold as Mo Wuji. In front of Zhuo Pingan, she really didn’t dare to take a seat.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t really care. As long as Zhuo Pingan didn’t use his strength to suppress him, then he didn’t need to feel inferior. Thus, Mo Wuji didn’t hesitate to sit down.</p><p>Seeing Mo Wuji invite himself to sit, an additional hint of disdain appeared in the corner of Zhuo Pingan’s eyes. To act so unbridledly in front of him, Zhuo Pingan; did this Mo Wuji think that this would improve Zhuo Pingan’s impression of him? And he even dared to bring his own guests here; besides his Pill Dao, this Mo Wuji did not seem to know anything else.</p><p>To Mo Wuji, the Immortal World was the same as the cultivation world. Only the strong could speak. Now that he had Da Huang, even if Da Huang wasn’t as powerful as Zhuo Pingan, Mo Wuji believed that Da Huang wouldn’t be far off. Moreover, Mo Wuji did not believe that an invalid like Zhuo Pingan would attack him, someone who had no enmity with Zhuo Pingan and could even be of help to Zhuo Pingan. Since that’s the case, Mo Wuji did have the rights to talk to Zhuo Pingan on equal standings.</p><p>Thus, Mo Wuji directly ignored Zhuo Pingan’s contempt and said indifferently, \"Half of Dao Friend Zhuo’s words were wrong. I am indeed Mo Wuji, but I’m not a Honored Grade Tier 5 Pill King, but a Honored Grade Tier 7 Pill Emperor.\"</p><p>\"Is what you’re saying true?\" Zhuo Pingan suddenly stood up at stared squarely at Mo Wuji. As for the disrespect that Mo Wuji showed him previously, he had already cast it aside.</p><p>When he heard this answer from Mo Wuji, even though he was a wise and firm late stage Immortal Emperor, he still couldn’t maintain his calm.</p><p>Mo Wuji looked calmly towards Zhuo Pingan; he did not reply to Zhuo Pingan’s words. He knew that this was a crucial time to balance the power. Once the power was balanced, it would be easier for him to negotiate.</p><p>\"Stay in the Cape of Peace and concoct pills for me. Even if you have offended Lun Cai, he wouldn’t dare to touch you.\" Zhuo Pingan was, after all, an Immortal Emperor. In an instant, he was able to make his decision. As a Honored Grade Tier 7 Pill Emperor, Mo Wuji did deserve to act arrogantly in front of him.</p><p>As for the girl that Mo Wuji brought in, he was willing to let her go. Of course, that was based on the condition that Mo Wuji concocts pills for him.</p><p>\"I can concoct pills for you, but there will definitely be conditions. At the same time, I will not be staying in the Cape of Peace.\" Mo Wuji’s tone remained calm.</p><p>A vicious expression flashed across Zhuo Pingan’s eyes, thereafter, an intense energy suddenly came pressing down on Mo Wuji. There was clearly nothing in front of him but Mo Wuji could actually feel something pressing against his chest, forcing him to be unable to breath. This aggressive energy didn’t simply stop there; instead, it got heavier and heavier.</p><p>Standing by Mo Wuji’s side, Da Huang could also feel this vehement Immortal Emperor aura. A faint green light shot out from its eyes, and thereafter, a fierce energy no inferior to Zhuo Pingan’s burst out.</p><p>The two forces clashed in mid air and the space in between them started to hum.</p><p>A hint of astonishment appeared in Zhuo Pingan’s face; he only just discovered that he had completed disregarded this immortal puppet. This immortal puppet actually had such an intense dao aura; from the looks of it, it was at least a Grade 9 immortal puppet.</p><p>Zhuo Pingan finally understood why Mo Wuji would act so boldly in front of him; it was because of this immortal puppet. He sneered in his heart, even if it was a Grade 9 immortal puppet, it was still useless in front of him.</p><p>As he thought of this, Zhuo Pingan’s aura raged with greater intensity. Previously, he didn’t intend to injure Mo Wuji. Not only couldn’t he injure his pill refiners, he didn’t want to waste a single bit of his pill refiner’s vitality.</p><p>Similarly, Da Huang’s aura also started to grow; whether it was its dao domain, or its oppressive aura, Da Huang was in no way inferior to Zhuo Pingan. In fact, it even started to surpass Zhuo Pingan’s aura.</p><p>Zhuo Pingan startled; this was definitely not a Grade 9 immortal puppet. He knew that he would no longer be able to merely use his aura to intimidate Mo Wuji.</p><p>Just when he intended to personally take action, Mo Wuji suddenly said, \"Zhuo Pingan, if you try to lay your hands on me, I will immediately leave the Cape of Peace. As for the matter of the cooperation, I believe that you aren’t the only one that needs to cooperate with.\"</p><p>When he heard Mo Wuji’s words, the malicious intents within Zhuo Pingan’s heart suddenly soared; a mere ant-like cultivator actually dared to threaten him, Zhuo Pingan.</p><p>\"Da Huang, prepare to fight.\" Feeling Zhuo Pingan’s malicious intents, Mo Wuji stood up and took a few steps back. He was also prepared to fight. Naturally, Han Long also braced herself to help Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji understood that his cultivation was low, but he should be able to aid Da Huang. Moreover, he had his own hidden cards such as his spatial imprisonment and his spirit storage channel.</p><p>Even though these things would only be a mere itch to Zhuo Pingan, but in a fight between experts, even a mere itch could have a huge impact on the outcome of the battle.</p><p>\"Very good. You have the rights to discuss with me.\" Zhuo Pingan’s malicious intents gradually faded as he stared at Mo Wuji calmly.</p><p>In his heart, he was still feeling very resentful. In that instant, he did want to attack to teach this immortal puppet a lesson. How dare an immortal puppet dare clash with him in terms of aura, it was simply courting death.</p><p>But eventually, he had no choice but to suppress his feelings. There was no other reason but the fact that Mo Wuji was a Honored Grade Tier 7 Pill Emperor. Mo Wuji had such a puppet, which meant that Mo Wuji did not need to help him, Zhuo Pingan, to concoct pills. What if Mo Wuji was really very young? The pill Mo Wuji concocted might possibly thoroughly treat his ailment.</p><p>Seeing Zhuo Pingan calm down, Mo Wuji also signalled for Da Huang to stop.</p><p>\"You’re really a Honored Grade Tier 7 Pill Emperor?\" Zhuo Pingan took in a deep breath, then he stared at Mo Wuji and asked solemnly.</p><p>This time, Mo Wuji didn’t remain silent. He answered with great certainty, \"That’s right, I am indeed a Honored Grade Tier 7 Pill Emperor. A few months ago, Han Long was still a Grand Luo Immortal but she’s now an Immortal King because of a Draining Immortal King Pill that I concocted for her.\"</p><p>\"Are you more than 1,000 years old?\" Even though Zhuo Pingan already guessed that Mo Wuji wasn’t likely to me more than 1,000 years old, he still wanted to verify it.</p><p>\"No.\" Mo Wuji answered simply. In his heart he was thinking: There’s no need to talk about 1,000 years old, he was still far from being 100 years old.</p><p>Zhuo Pingan nodded, his face was expressionless and aloof, as though he wasn’t the same person that was shocked after knowing that Mo Wuji was a Honored Grade Tier 7 Pill Emperor.</p><p>Mo Wuji was sure that he had met Zhuo Pingan’s requirements. As for why Zhuo Pingan wasn’t as emotional as he had been previously, it was perfectly normal. Previously, Zhuo Pingan thought that he, Mo Wuji, was simply a fish that had no capability to resist. That’s why Zhuo Pingan didn’t need to care about his emotions. But now that Zhuo Pingan knew how strong Da Huang was, he naturally wouldn’t reveal any primal emotions before the negotiations concluded.</p><p>Whether Zhuo Pingan revealed his emotions or not wasn’t critical to Mo Wuji. If they couldn’t come to an agreement, then he could just forget about it. He did have the base card.</p><p>\"This bird of yours is not bad.\" Zhuo Pingan suddenly changed the topic and focused his attention on Shuai Guo.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t know the meaning behind Zhuo Pingan’s words. Logically, he should be ralking about Da Huang, but he unexpectedly praised the unassuming Shuai Guo.</p><p>Da Huang said discontently, in its low and muffled voice, \"Did you think that it was that tiny bird that blocked you? It was me, Da Huang, ok? Your words are really too unpleasant to the ears. Why don’t we spar once and I’ll let you see my power.\"</p><p>\"Da Huang, don’t talk nonsense.\" Mo Wuji scolded Da Huang. He didn’t want Da Huang to actually fight with Zhuo Pingan. It wasn’t because he was afraid of Zhuo Pingan, but because Da Huang was simply a money burning machine. Moreover, he only had five of those crystals that could power Da Huang.</p><p>Every time Da Huang made a move, he would have one less move which he could use to ensure his own safety.</p><p>\"You can talk?\" Even though Da Huang was able to block his aura previously, Zhuo Pingan didn’t really care too much about it. But now when he heard Da Huang speak, he was truly shocked.</p><p>A speaking immortal puppet; that meant that this immortal puppet had an equipment spirit. Any equipment with an equipment spirit was a first class equipment. A puppet could also have an equipment spirit?</p><p>Da Huang pouted its lips and didn’t answer.</p><p>Zhuo Pingan continued, \"I take back my previous words. You are not bad too.\"</p><p>After saying that, Zhuo Pingan turned and looked at Mo Wuji with greater seriousness, \"Have you heard of the Seven Runes Glimpsing Pill?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji shook his head, \"I’m sorry. Even though I’m a Tier 7 Pill Emperor, I don’t know many pill formulas.\"</p><p>Zhuo Pingan didn’t find it unexpected; he continued, \"The Seven Runes Glimpsing Pill has three main ingredients. The first one is the pill refiner’s vitality.\"</p><p>After saying this sentece, Zhuo Pingan paid special attention to Mo Wuji. Actually, this wasn’t a hidden secret. There were a few people in the Cape of Peace that know that he needed pills with vitality inserted in them.</p><p>When he saw that Mo Wuji didn’t have any reaction after hearing his sentence, he knew that Mo Wuji was already cognizant of that fact. Even though he was a tyrant in his own right, Zhuo Pingan actually heaved a sigh of relief. If it was before this meeting, such a thing wouldn’t have happened.</p><p>When he, Zhuo Pingan, needed pills, there was no need to talk about vitality. Even if he asked for their lives, the pill refiner would still have to give it.</p><p>\"Secondly, it needs the Green Bodhi Flower…\" Zhuo Pingan continued speaking. There was nothing much about the Green Bodhi Flower. Even though it was expensive, it wasn’t that difficult to procure it. This immortal herb was also the primary ingredient for the Green Bodhi Pill, one of the peak healing pills.</p><p>\"Thirdly, it needs the Heavenly Nature Grass.\" When Zhuo Pingan said this, his eyes dimmed. This Heavenly Nature Grass was truly too hard to obtain.</p><p>\"It needs the Heavenly Nature Grass?\" Mo Wuji asked in astonishment.</p><p>Zhuo Pingan nodded, \"That’s right. That’s what the pill formula says. The Heavenly Nature Grass is a Tier 7 immortal herb and it is already hard to find. Over these few years, I only managed to find the Heavenly Desolate Grass. The Heavenly Desolate Grass is, after all, only at Tier 5. The worst part is that the Heavenly Desolate Grass is extremely hard to purify. All this time, even the best Pill Emperors are only able to concoct Four Runes out of the Seven Runes Glimpsing Pill…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t interrupt him. Only he knew that the Heavenly Desolate Grass was actually the precursor to the Heavenly Nature Grass; their only difference was just a difference in purity.</p><p>The Pill Emperors that Zhuo Pingan found didn’t even understand about the Heavenly Desolate Grass and Heavenly Nature Grass. So what dog’s fart Seven Runes Glimpsing Pill could they concoct?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
