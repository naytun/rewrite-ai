If Mo Wuji used that Winding River move again, he would very likely fall into a disadvantage and then be surrounded by the others.</p><p>If the item on Gai Guangyi wasn't too important to him, he might already have fled. Fortunately, Wan Ping soon discovered that Mo Wuji's slash wasn't Winding River, but an extremely ordinary looking slash. He slashed with the Coloured Glass Saber in his hand, and he allowed his domain to burst forth strongly.</p><p>\"Boom!\" Mo Wuji's saber light was shattered; the entire sky became filled with Wan Ping's coloured glass saber light.</p><p>Wan Ping rejoiced; he realised that he had overestimated Mo Wuji. Mo Wuji seemed to only have those two good slashes; this third slash easily unraveled.</p><p>\"Crack!\" After Mo Wuji's saber light was shattered, the coloured glass saber light landed on Mo Wuji's domain. Even if Mo Wuji's domain was any stronger, it wasn't able to defend against Wan Ping's coloured glass saber light.</p><p>In everyone's eyes, the only thing Mo Wuji could do at this moment was to retreat; the faster, the better. Otherwise, Mo Wuji would be completely restrained by Wan Ping.</p><p>The bearded middle-aged man could clearly see that Mo Wuji was in a fire condition. The moment Mo Wuji retreated, the three of them would be sitting ducks in front of Wan Ping’s saber. At this point, the best choice for the three of them was to retreat as well. However, this middle-aged man was very clear that the moment he retreated, Mo Wuji would very likely be maimed by Wan Ping's coloured glass saber light.</p><p>He, Gai Guangyi, had always done things true to his character; leaving now would be a betrayal to their alliance. Moreover, if he retreated, this youth who helped them deal with Wan Ping would be heavily injured. When that happens, they also wouldn't be able to escape.</p><p>As he thought of this, not only didn't he escape, his magic treasure began to concentrate with more immortal elemental energy.</p><p>Mo Wuji naturally knew what situation they were in. Thus, he really appreciated the decision that Gai Guangyi made. This was a forthright man; at least this man didn't take the opportunity to flee, leaving him to fend for his own.</p><p>Since Mo Wuji had already decided to kill Wan Ping, how could he be the one to retreat in injury? Not only didn't he retreat, he even took one step forward. He seemed to send himself towards the Coloured Glass Saber. Then, he punched.</p><p>Suddenly, an Yin Yang Taiji Seal appeared in front of his fist. That seal rapidly expanded, forming a huge grey energy.</p><p>This death energy pervaded and filled the air. At this instant, the entire space seemed to be brimming with the energy of death. Mo Wuji's eyes were closed tightly, his face was pale white. Endless amounts of immortal elemental energy, spiritual will and vitality were being sucked away by this punch.</p><p>At this instant, there was no need to even talk about Wan Ping who was the target of the attack, even the three people teaming with Mo Wuji felt their hearts turning cold. A sense of impending doom surged into their minds as their hearts became filled with despair.</p><p>That's not right, within the death and despair, there's a hint of life. However, this hint of life seems so distant and hard to grasp.</p><p>\"What punch is this?\" Wan Ping completely forgotten that his coloured glass saber had landed on Mo Wuji and had only draw a bit of blood. His entire mind had been drawn to this punch.</p><p>Within this punch, there was life. Even though it was only several inches away from him, that life felt like it was as distant as an unending chasm. More than life, was the death within this punch. Even though the punch hadn't landed, Wan Ping could already feel the beckoning of death.</p><p>Mo Wuji's face turned increasingly pale. He had the vitality channel, but it was truly hard for him to support using this move against a Grand Luo Immortal like Wan Ping.</p><p>\"Wheel of Life and Death! You should be honored that I used this punch to send you to hell.\" Mo Wuji's voice was slightly raspy, it was like his punch, devoid of life.</p><p>Wan Ping struggled to slash with his Coloured Glass Saber, but the energy of death was too oppressive. All his energy had been suppressed by this energy and he wasn't even able to properly wield his weapon.</p><p>\"No, you can't kill me…\" Wan Ping's eyes were finally filled with fear and disorder. Perhaps such an expression was more suitable for his youth like appearance.</p><p>\"You're not the first Vast Ocean Immortal School disciple I killed, and you won't be the last one either. Go on then. There's no need for any attachments…\"</p><p>\"Bang!\"</p><p>The moment Mo Wuji's words were uttered, the Wheel of Life and Death landed on Wan Ping. Wan Ping's eyes dimmed and his body instantly turned grey. In just that short time, death energy bad completely wrested away all his life.</p><p>\"Pff!\" The body exploded. Mo Wuji extended his hand and grabbed Wan Ping's storage ring. At this moment, Wan Ping was dead in both body and soul. As for his Coloured Glass Saber, it fell into the West Moat Ocean; Mo Wuji couldn't be bothered to pick it up.</p><p>At this instant, he was also like a lamp running out of fuel. If not for his vitality channel, he really wouldn't have dared to his Wheel of Life and Death.</p><p>The exuberant vitality from the channel rapidly moisturized Mo Wuji's entire body. The vitality channel also drew in vitality from the surroundings which also moisturized Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji's grey, defeated face and withered spiritual will also recovered rapidly. However, he still wasn’t able to move; Wan Ping wasn’t weak, just to kill Wan Ping, he had depleted much of his energy.</p><p>Gai Guangyi and co. stared blankly at Mo Wuji. Even after a long time, they didn’t say a word.</p><p>Previously, they thought that Mo Wuji was definitely going to be heavily injured and they expected the worst. However, with just one punch, this youth killed the Grand Luo Immortal Wan Ping. They, themselves, knew exactly how terrifying that punch was, because they had also felt the overwhelming energy of death within that punch.</p><p>If this punch had been targeted at them, not one of them would have survived. If a person could release such a deadly punch, one could easily tell how terrifying that person was. In their eyes, there was an additional tinge of reverence.</p><p>After half an incense’s time, Mo Wuji finally opened his eyes. He turned and saw Gai Guangyi and co.</p><p>\"Friend, many thanks for lending a hand to help us. If this friend didn’t do that, the three of us would probably have ended up in Wan Ping’s hands.\" Gai Guangyi noticed that Mo Wuji had stopped healing himself, and he immediately clasped his fists towards Mo Wuji in gratitude.</p><p>Mo Wuji smiled, \"It was mutual. If the three of you didn’t help to hold him down, Wan Ping might already have escaped. My name is Mo Wuji, how may I address the three of you?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t say those words purely out of courtesy. During his battle with Wan Ping, because of the three of them, Wan Ping was only able to exhibit 70% of his strength. Mo Wuji was never weaker than Wan Ping, and now that Wan Ping wasn’t able to fully display his abilities, his killing ace, the Wheel of Life and Death, was able to murder Wan Ping without fail.</p><p>The bearded middle-aged man hurriedly said, \"I am Gai Guangyi.\"</p><p>Thereafter, he pointed at the good looking woman and said, \"This is Wu Nian, and the big fella beside her is Ji Chai.\"</p><p>Ji Chai was indeed a big man; he was more than 2 meters tall and he had a strong and muscular physique.</p><p>\"Previously, I heard Wan Ping say that the three of you are heading to the Cape of Peace. May I ask where the Cape of Peace is? Is it near to here?\" The time Mo Wuji spent in the Immortal World wasn’t very long, moreover, he was swept out of the Immortal World after a short time here, so he still wasn’t very familiar with the places here.</p><p>\"Brother Mo doesn’t know of the Cape of Peace?\" Gai Guangyi was shocked. The fact that Mo Wuji didn’t know about the Cape of Peace was even more unbelievable than the fact that Mo Wuji was lost in the West Moat Ocean.</p><p>Mo Wuji hurriedly said, \"Ever since I ascended into the Immortal World, I had always been behind closed doors. That’s why I’m not too familiar with this place.\"</p><p>Regardless whether Mo Wuji’s words were true or not, Gai Guangyi decided not to question him. Instead, he said with prudence, \"Brother Mo, that Wan Ping is an important figure in the Vast Ocean Immortal School. If Brother Mo isn’t the disciple of some big sect, then I would suggest that Brother Mo follows us to the Cape of Peace.\"</p><p>\"I’d like to hear more details about the place,\" Mo Wuji clasped his fists and said.</p><p>Gai Guangyi continued speaking, \"The Cape of Peace is a place which prohibits killing. In that place, even if there are any sort of grievances, killing still isn’t allowed. As long as you didn’t offend someone as powerful as an Immortal Emperor, then you would be safe when you reach the Cape of Peace. No one would dare to lay hands on you.\"</p><p>\"What if I offended an Immortal Emperor?\" Mo Wuji asked. After all, he had really offended an Immortal Emperor. Even though he still didn’t know how he offended Immortal Emperor Lun Cai, but since Immortal Emperor Lun Cai had killed his men, he wouldn’t let this matter rest.</p><p>Gai Guangyi didn’t know that Mo Wuji had offended Immortal Emperor Lun Cai; he only thought about the matter of Mo Wuji killing Wan Ping. Wan Ping was a genius of the Vast Ocean Immortal School, and the Vast Ocean Immortal School did have an Immortal Emperor. Thus, Mo Wuji wasn’t wrong to say that he had offended an Immortal Emperor.</p><p>\"If you have offended an Immortal Emperor, then you can only go to the Cape of Peace’s Peace Resthouse. The owner of the Peace Resthouse is called Zhuo Pingan. [1] As long as you go to Peace Resthouse, it would be equivalent to being under his shelter. To anyone who dared to fight in Peace Resthouse, there’s only one word: Death. In the countless of years, Peace Resthouse had sheltered many pursued cultivators.</p><p>It was exactly because of the existence of the Peace Resthouse that the Cape of Peace formed. Eventually, it became a rule that in the Cape of Peace, no killing could take place. Of course, this rule does not extend to Immortal Emperors. But Immortal Emperors still wouldn’t do anything in the Peace Resthouse itself,\" Gai Guangyi explained.</p><p>So impressive? Mo Wuji suddenly thought of a movie that he had watched back on Earth. That movie was called Peace Hotel. Anyone that went to the hotel were not allowed to fight.</p><p>Mo Wuji was very clear that anyone who could operate such a resthouse must be incomparably strong. However, he also knew another thing; anyone who would open such a hotel would eventually be killed.</p><p>\"Brother Mo, the Vast Ocean Immortal School would definitely be able to trace Wan Ping’s death to you. The moment a genius like Wan Ping gets killed, the person who killed him will leave threads behind. There’s no need to talk about senior, there might already be an imprint of the three of us,\" Seeing Mo Wuji’s silence, Gai Guangyi continued.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not think that Gai Guangyi was blindly speaking; Gai Guangyi’s words were very logical. He was an array master, so he, himself, had done much research on imprints. Back when he was in Zhen Xing, he also suffered under the imprint of the Broken Sect. Of course, with his current abilities and his 108 meridians, the Vast Ocean Immortal School should forget about leaving any imprints on him. However, the Cape of Peace did catch his interest.</p><p>He had offended far too many people. Perhaps one day, when he had no other roads to take, he could really make a trip to the Cape of Peace.</p><p>As he thought of this, Mo Wuji clasped his fists and said, \"Then I will have to trouble Brother Gai to lead the way. I will also be heading to the Cape of Peace.\"</p><p>[1] Pingan means peace or safety.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
