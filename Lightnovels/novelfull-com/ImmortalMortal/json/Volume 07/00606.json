I also know that my request is crossing the line; I don't have the Draining Immortal King Dao Fruit but yet I still wanted Pill Master Mo to help me concoct a batch of Draining Immortal King Pills. However, I do have something to offer; I can tell you a secret of the Great Desolate Sea Domain. If they know of that place, even Immortal Emperors would personally come and fight for it,\" Han Long spoke in a solemn tone.</p><p>Mo Wuji had an indifferent expression on his face; he didn't respond to Han Long's words. Only when it was in his hands, then could it be considered a secret. If it wasn't in his hands, then it was simply an unknown. Thus, he wasn't very enthusiastic about Han Long's suggestion; he even wanted to send her off.</p><p>Han Long could clearly see Mo Wuji's indifference. Before Mo Wuji could even express his idea of sending her out, she hurriedly added, \"Pill Master Mo, you shouldn't know the current value of a Draining Immortal King Dao Fruit, right? Due to some unknown reason in the Immortal World, all the Draining Immortal King Dao Fruits that were grown by cultivators suddenly withered. Only wild Draining Immortal King Dao Fruits could survive. However, how many wild Draining Immortal King Dao Fruits are there? So after knowing that you have many Draining Immortal King Dao Fruits on you, there are already countless of people that have their eyes on you.\"</p><p>\"There's no need for you to remind me. I also know that I'm in a precarious position,\" Mo Wuji furrowed his brows and said, his tone was still indifferent. Previously, he did overlook and forget that he had the Draining Immortal King Dao Fruit. If he remembered it previously, perhaps he wouldn't have come to the Cape of Peace.</p><p>Han Long did not seem to mind Mo Wuji's attitude and she continued, \"In the Great Desolate Sea Domain, there's a land of immortal herbs that has yet to be opened. It's said that it's even more abundant than Yunxian Immortal Valley. Moreover, I even know that there's a Emperor Dao Fruit...\"</p><p>When she mentioned the Emperor Dao Fruit, Han Long paid special attention to Mo Wuji's expression. She believes that anyone would be emotional if they heard of the Emperor Dao Fruit, much less a pill refiner like Mo Wuji.</p><p>To her disappointment, Mo Wuji didn't even raise an eyebrow. Clearly, he didn't really care much about Han Long's words.</p><p>Mo Wuji naturally didn't care about it, he already had one Emperor Dao Fruit and that thing wasn't even useful to him at this time. Why would he need so many Emperor Dao Fruit?</p><p>\"I'm not interested.\" Mo Wuji shook his head. At this moment, he was thinking about how he should hide from Grand Emperor Lun Cai. It wasn't safe in the Cape of Peace, nor did he want to leave with any other people.</p><p>\"I can introduce someone to protect you. Even Grand Emperor Lun Cai wouldn't dare to do anything to you.\" When Han Long saw that Mo Wuji wasn't even interested in the Emperor Dao Fruit, she decided to make one final attempt.</p><p>Mo Wuji looked at Han Long doubtfully; was this woman mad, would such an expert who wouldn't even fear Grand Emperor Lun Cai want to protect a Grand Yi Immortal like him?</p><p>When Han Long saw a hint of interest flash across Mo Wuji's eyes, she began to speak even more spiritedly, \"The person I'm introducing is Zhuo Pingan. I believe that since you've come here, you would definitely know about Zhuo Pingan, right?</p><p>Before this, Mo Wuji really didn't know a thing about Zhuo Pingan. But after Gai Guangyi's introduction, he did know a bit about that fella. He's the one in control of the Cape of Peace, the owner of Peace Resthouse and the unscrupulous money maker. Mo Wuji guessed that this fella's strength must be exceedingly high.</p><p>\"Why would he want to protect me?\" Mo Wuji did not think that his mere status as a Tier 6 Pill King would earn the protection if an expert like Zhuo Pingan.</p><p>Han Long said enigmatically, \"Because Zhuo Pingan needs a Pill Emperor to concoct pills for him, and the Pill Emperor who concocts pills for him would change every other decade. Think about it, how many Pill Emperors are there in all seven Immortal Domains combined? If he changes a Pill Emperor every decade, then no number of Pill Emperor would be enough. So if you can become a Tier 7 Pill Emperor…\"</p><p>Before Han Long could finish speaking, Mo Wuji's eyes turned cold. Han Long could clearly feel the iciness in Mo Wuji's eyes and she subconsciously stopped talking.</p><p>Mo Wuji said coldly, \"Dao Friend Han Long, we have no grudges or enmity between us so why must you try to harm me?\"</p><p>Han Long looked at Mo Wuji in doubt; when did she try to harm him?</p><p>Mo Wuji could see Han Long's confusion and his tone momentarily eased, \"Since Zhuo Pingan needs to change a Pill Emperor every other decade, it would mean that the pills he require is concocted with the Pill Emperor's vitality and longevity. If the Pill Emperor concocts such pills for a prolonged time, his vitality would suffer greatly. Once his vitality falls to a certain level, he would no longer be able to concoct that pill. Tell me, when Zhuo Pingan chooses a Pill Emperor, does he show a preference for younger ones?\"</p><p>Han Long jolted but she immediately reacted; she subconsciously said, \"That seems to be the case.\"</p><p>She wasn't a pill refiner but with this simple prompt by Mo Wuji, she came to a complete understanding. Mo Wuji was right.</p><p>\"Sorry, I didn't know that concocting some pills would require vitality and longevity. Actually, I don't have the rights to meet Zhuo Pingan, I only wanted you to agree to my request,\" Han Long said apologetically.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn't say anything further. Actually, if Zhuo Pingan really needed some vitality pill, he was suitable for that job. He had the vitality channel. If he ran out of it, he would only need to absorb vitality from the surroundings.</p><p>However, unless he had no other choice, he really wouldn't choose to do such a thing. Concocting pills for Zhuo Pingan to get rid of Grand Emperor Lun Cai's threat was equivalent to jumping into a sea of fire after escaping from a mountain of blades.</p><p>\"Tell me about your secret in detail. If it's feasible, I'm willing to follow you to make a trip to the Great Desolate Sea Domain,\" Mo Wuji sighed; he really didn’t have any better alternative. If he was trapped in the Cape of Peace by Grand Emperor Lun Cai, then he wouldn’t be able to leave even if he wanted to.</p><p>Seeking refuge in Peace Resthouse would only be drinking poison to quench your thirst.</p><p>Han Long’s eyes sparkled; she hurriedly said, \"In the Great Desolate Sea Domain, there’s an unremarkable and inconspicuous place which holds an immortal herb garden. That immortal herb garden is protected by a high grade array, and it is guarded by a powerful Puppet Beast. The reason I know of this place was because I managed to obtain an ancient treasure map. Eventually, I took the risk to travel there and all this turned out to be true.\"</p><p>\"You say that it’s guarded by a powerful Puppet Beast? What class is it?\" A glimmer appeared in Mo Wuji’s eyes.</p><p>Han Long didn’t hide anything, \"That Puppet Beast is at least Class 7 or above. I even suspect that it might be Class 9… But there’s no need for you to worry, that Puppet Beast seems to be running out of energy and its movements are slow and sluggish. At the moment, it doesn’t pose any threat.\"</p><p>After saying that, Han Long decided to incite Mo Wuji by adding, \"That garden is left behind by an ancient power. A majority of the herbs inside are Tier 7 and above. If Pill Master Mo wants to advance to become a Pill Emperor, that place would be of great help. Moreover, there might even be other treasures in there.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t continue asking about that herb garden in the Great Desolate Sea Domain. Instead, he asked, \"Why did you request for a batch of Draining Immortal King Pills? Usually, people would only ask for a single pill.\"</p><p>Han Long took in a deep breath, then she spoke in a steady and firm voice, \"Because I want revenge. My breasts were chopped away by a beast. Just because he wanted to please another woman, a woman who he thinks is better than me, that beast did such a vicious action. The reason why I need an entire batch is because I have two junior sisters. Supposedly, they had a 50% chance of being able to advance to become Immortal Kings. But because of me, they were implicated and suffered the same fate. Now, they are no are longer able get a glimpse into the Immortal King Stage. So, I want to use this to compensate them.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji thought in his heart: There were really human scum everywhere. Just to make another woman feel happy, he actually sliced off the breasts off several other woman. One can only imagine what a pervert this fella was. If this fella had the misfortune of meeting Mo Wuji, then there’s only one word for that scum: Death.</p><p>To an immortal, it was true that severed breasts could be recovered. But the fleshly body was a an immortal’s most important foundation and source of power. The moment it was damaged, even if it was recovered, the dao foundations would still be affected. An Immortal King had always been a peerless existence, and almost every Immortal King had perfect bodies. For such cultivators who had their dao foundations damaged, unless they used some heaven defying treasure, they typically weren’t able to regain their original appearance.</p><p>The reason why Han Long didn’t use any precious treasure was probably because she was carrying the hope that she could advance to the Immortal King Stage with two Draining Immortal King Pills. Once she advanced into the Immortal King Stage, the damage to her body would naturally heal itself, and she would regain her perfect body.</p><p>But how expensive was a Draining Immortal King Pill? It was already hard to obtain one of it, much less two. There’s no wonder why Han Long was asking him for a batch of Draining Immortal King Pills with such fervour.</p><p>After Han Long finished speaking, she looked at Mo Wuji expectantly. She was worried that Mo Wuji might reject her again.</p><p>This time, Mo Wuji didn’t hesitate. Even if he didn’t work with Han Long, it was still likely that he was going to go to the Great Desolate Sea Domain. After all, he was being pursued by so many powerful people; there really wasn’t many good places he could flee to.</p><p>\"I agree. When I advance to become a Tier 7 Pill Emperor, I will help you concoct a batch of Draining Immortal King Pills.\" The moment Mo Wuji made a decision, he wouldn’t falter.</p><p>\"Many thanks Pill Master Mo.\" Han Long was so emotional that even her voice was trembling. \"I suggest that Pill Master Mo and I head to the Great Desolate Sea Domain now. The methods of those Immortal Emperors are truly too terrifying. Even though there aren’t any transfer arrays in the Cape of Peace, no one can be sure of when they will arrive. Especially Immortal Emperor Lun Cai, his beloved concubine is still alive so he’s constantly trying to catch you.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji sneered; this fella killed four of his people from Tian Ji Pill Court, and he still expects Mo Wuji to save his concubine? Did this Immortal Emperor Lun Cai think he was the God of Creation?</p><p>He, Mo Wuji, wasn’t such a magnamimous man. If he were to see Grand Emperor Lun Cai now, he would only say one sentence: Keep your neck clean and wait.</p><p>On the other hand, Mo Wuji appproved of Han Long’s words. It was better for them to leave the Cape of Peace as soon as possible, every day spent here was an additional day of danger.</p><p>\"Dao Friend Han Long, you recently made a trip to the several Immortal Domains, did you hear anything about the Devil Moon Immortal School?\" Mo Wuji didn't intend to ask this question, but he was truly unable to hold it in. Moreover, he had already formed an agreement with Han Long and before it was fulfilled, Han Long wouldn't be likely to lie to him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
