However, immediately after, he said, \"Pill Master Mo, ever since I, Gai Ao, entered the Dao, this is the first time a mere Grand Yi Immortal addressed me as an immortal friend.\"</p><p>Gai Ao? A thought immediately flashed in Mo Wuji’s mind as he instantly knew who this man was.</p><p>He had never seen Gai Ao before, but he had heard of this name. Lin Gu was the one who told him about it; Gai Ao was the Heavenly Emperor of Six Paths Immortal Domain. He was also the expert who went to the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond to save his daughter. The reason why Lin Gu knew that it was possible to resurrect someone using the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond was because of this precedence of Gai Ao.</p><p>If this person in front of him was Gai Ao, then clearly, this person’s cultivation was extraordinary. From the looks of it, this gorgeous beauty in the red dress was very likely to be Gai Ao’s daughter, Gai Feiyan.</p><p>\"Mo Wuji greets Heavenly Emperor Gai. Because of my inexperience, I wasn’t able to recognise the Heavenly Emperor. I seek the Heavenly Emperor’s forgiveness,\" Mo Wuji clasped his hands and said apologetically.</p><p>He had no enmity with Gai Ao, so Gai Ao probably wouldn’t cause any trouble for him. From the way he looked at it, a person like Gai Ao definitely wouldn’t want to form any relations with a mere Grand Yi Immortal like him. Previously, he had addressed Xu Suren as a senior, but he did not necessarily have to address Gai Ao in the same way. In terms of cultivation, he did, indeed, have to address Gai Ao as a senior. But from a different perspective, he was also an Emperor level figure. If a Pill Emperor could be compared to an Immortal Emperor, then he could indeed, grudgingly, be placed on the same level of seniority as Gai Ao.</p><p>Since they were on the same level of seniority, then why must he lower himself. Not only was Xu Suren an Immortal Emperor, Xu Suren’s achievement in the Smithing Dao was vastly above his in the Pill Dao. Moreover, Xu Suren also cultivated the Immortal Mortal Technique. To address Xu Suren as a senior was very suitable.</p><p>\"You’re really a Tier 7 Pill Emperor?\" The red dressed girl suddenly asked out of curiosity.</p><p>Mo Wuji, once again, clasped his fists and said, \"Mo Wuji greets this senior sister. I am indeed a Tier 7 Pill Emperor.\"</p><p>\"This is my daughter, Gai Feilan,\" Gai Ao suddenly grinned and said.</p><p>Mo Wuji suddenly startled. Immediately, he knew the meaning behind Gai Ao’s words: You called my daughter Senior Sister, so whether you say it out loud or not, I am your senior.</p><p>When he heard Gai Ao’s words, Mo Wuji impression of him actually improved. He immediately said, \"The Heavenly Emperor’s love for your daughter is known throughout the Immortal World. Mo Wuji admires your act deeply.\"</p><p>\"Hahaha…\" Gai Ao chuckled once more, \"It isn’t easy to get admired by a Pill Emperor like you. This time, I specially came to Heavenly Chasm City to see the Pill Emperor that dared to go against the Lightning Sect, and even dared to go to Soul Condensing Immortal Pond to save his friend.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji noticed that when Gai Ao was speaking, Gai Feilan’s beautiful eyes were staring at him, giving him a feeling of apprehension.</p><p>\"The Heavenly Emperor must be joking. This little one behaved recklessly as though I was a Heavenly Emperor. I guess I give off the impression of overestimating my own strength.\" Mo Wuji did not know what these two’s intentions were, so he could only reply casually.</p><p>Gai Ao’s face turned serious and his tone also became solemn as he said, \"Even though I don’t know what treasure you had which allowed you to survive the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond, but seeing how you took the risk to participate in Yong Ying Grand Alchemy Competition, then obtained the Underworld Heart Flower, and eventually go to the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond to save a life, I know that you are a person that values kinship and friendship. So today, when Guang Xing came to you asking for the Great Kun Buddhist Lamp, I helped you to avert the trouble.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji sighed. Indeed, everyone already knew about the Great Kun Buddhist Lamp. If this Heavenly Emperor also wanted the Great Kun Buddhist Lamp, then he really wasn’t able to protect it.</p><p>\"Ah…\" Mo Wuji intentionally acted surprised.</p><p>\"It doesn’t matter whether you’re feigning it or not, we will talk in greater detail when we go inside. Anyway, I have one thing to say to you, I really admire you,\" Gai Ao snickered, then he went into the Heavenly Chasm Pond.</p><p>Mo Wuji saw that Gai Feilan seemed to be waiting for him, so he hurriedly said, \"Senior Sister Feilan, please head in first. I will walk behind you.\"</p><p>Gai Feilan’s face had actually turned red. She lowered her head with an ‘En’, then she swiftly walked in.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s EQ was definitely not lower than 250. The moment he saw Gai Feilan’s expression, he jolted slightly. In his heart, he was thinking: That doesn’t seem right. He had never met Gai Feilan before, so was there a need for such an expression and attitude? Moreover, Gai Feilan was already at the Great Circle of the Grand Luo Immortal Stage, which was much higher than him. He did not think that he had the looks of Adonis. To be able to attract a girl with a single look was simply bullsh*t.</p><p>When the hostess, that was receiving the guests, saw that the Gai father-daughter pair had entered, she hurriedly said, \"Pill Master Mo, the castellan tells you to be careful. Everyone here is too strong, he is unable to help you.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji nodded and expressed his thanks. Then, he also walked into the Heavenly Chasm Pond. He had the help of Da Huang, so as long as the other party wasn’t on the level of Gai Ao, he was confident that he should still be able to protect himself.</p><p>The moment he entered the Heavenly Chasm City, he felt rich immortal spiritual energy rush towards him. A waterfall, of unknown origins, cascaded over a lotus flower pond and a few immortal cranes flew around the sky. The fragrance of the lotus from the lotus flower pond pervaded through the air, evoking the sense of being in a dreamy paradise.</p><p>A few covered bridges and rotating pavilions floated in mid-air, immersed in the rich immortal spiritual energy, adorning this dream-like place with greater mysticism.</p><p>Immortal wine and immortal fruits floated in mid-air, and they were all over the place. Anyone could casually pluck one out and consume it. In a pavilion not far away, there were some immortal ladies dancing gracefully.</p><p>Many of the immortals that were already here were engaged in their own conversations, occasionally taking a sip of the immortal wine. Not only did Mo Wuji not know a majority of the people here, he didn’t even see most of them before. However, there was one thing Mo Wuji did know, that was the cultivation of these other guests were very high. There basically wasn’t another Grand Yi Immortal. Even if there was, that Grand Yi Immortal was accompanying a senior.</p><p>Mo Wuji also casually grabbed a cup of immortal wine and drank it. The cold and distinct wine fragrance instantly exploded in his mouth; that feeling of intoxication directly spread into Mo Wuji’s meridians. Even though Mo Wuji wasn’t cultivating, he could feel his cultivation rising.</p><p>What an amazing immortal wine; Mo Wuji praised in his heart. All this while, he had always been eating pills, using immortal essence or using piles of immortal crystals. It was the first time that he had such amazing effects with a single cup of wine.</p><p>From the looks of it, he had only been living a peasant life in the Immortal World. He had never thought of getting some of such wine. As he thought of this, Mo Wuji grabbed another cup of wine.</p><p>A whole different wine sensations spread throughout his entire body. Mo Wuji did not only feel his entire body relaxed, all the way down to his pores, but he could also feel his cultivation rising.</p><p>Another one. Mo Wuji was not going to let such a good opportunity go to waste. He grabbed a third cup of wine.</p><p>Three different cups, three entirely different flavours.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not hesitate to grab a fourth cup. He was very curious whether every cup here contained a wine of a different flavour, and whether every cut could bring a rise to his cultivation.</p><p>\"Where did such a cockroach come from?\" A voice suddenly resounded, causing Mo Wuji, whose eyes were slightly close in enjoyment, to open his eyes.</p><p>Mo Wuji stared coldly at the fella who just spoke. It was a tall and sturdy man who was barefooted. What was most drawing about him was his long hair. It wasn't because of its length, but because the hair was gold in colour.</p><p>Because of his towering figure, the long spear on his back did not look jarring.</p><p>This person's cultivation wasn't high; he should be in the Grand Luo Immortal Stage. However, his killing intent had already started to seep out of his body, giving off the impression that he had just emerged from a sea of blood and corpses.</p><p>\"Ni Ju, this is no cockroach. Let me introduce the all of you, this is Honored Grade Tier 7 Pill Emperor Mo.\" A delicate voice same over. Thereafter, three ladies walked over.</p><p>The one in front was a pretty dame. On first glance, this pretty dame wasn't particularly stunning. However, the more you looked at her, you could feel her startling magnetism. She was different from other women; usually, people attract others with their outer appearance. However, this pretty dame's attractiveness came from the inside. She had the kind of beauty that got better the more you looked at her.</p><p>Among the two ladies behind her, Mo Wuji recognised one of them. She was Mo Xianmo. Previously, when Yan Zhenjiang acted all pompous in front of him, she was the woman who he asked to screw off.</p><p>The other lady was even prettier than Mo Xianmo, and she seemed to have the same quality as that pretty dame. The more you looked at her, the prettier she got. She gave the impression of an otherworldly beauty.</p><p>These three people weren't simple, especially that pretty dame. Mo Wuji suspected that she had that special characteristic because of a unique cultivation technique. Not only that, her cultivation was not low. In Mo Wuji's perspective, she should at least be a Quasi-Emperor, or an expert half a step into the Immortal Emperor Stage.</p><p>Could these three ladies be from the Green Immortal House?</p><p>\"Ni Ju greets Senior Qing Yang.\" When the tall, barefooted and golden-haired man saw the pretty dame, he actually bowed.</p><p>After bowing, he immediately turned and stared at Mo Wuji coldly, \"So you're Mo Wuji, the fella that said that anyone who killed a disciple of Tian Ji Sect would become your enemy? Oh right, not long ago, I just killed a few disciples of Tian Ji Sect. Let me think how I killed them… Oh, I remember now, I skinned them and impaled them and I dragged them into the immortal city. Yup, that's how I did it. Actually, that's what I do every time I kill a Tian Ji Sect disciple…\"</p><p>A deep killing intent started to brew in Mo Wuji's heart. At the end of the day, he was the Tian Ji Sect Head back in Zhen Xing. This b*stard had killed the Tian Ji Sect disciples in such a brutal way, and after he killed them, he even humiliated them. If he wasn't able to settle this enmity, then he didn't deserve to be a sect head.</p><p>Feeling the killing intent emanating from Mo Wuji, that pretty dame said, \"Pill Master Mo, let me help you with an introduction as well. Ni Ju is the disciple of the Great Sword Path's Elder Sa Jian. I heard that Elder Sa Jian has just stepped into the late Immortal Reverent Stage.\"</p><p>Great Sword Path’s Sa Jian? Mo Wuji immediately recalled who that was. Tian Ji Sect was destroyed because of Sa Jian. This fella also had another disciple called Huang Sha. Huang Sha ascended from Yong Ying Immortal Domain, and he killed 317 geniuses from Yong Ying Immortal Domain before escaping to join the Great Sword Path.</p><p>Mo Wuji forcefully suppressed his killing intent as he clasped his fists to that pretty dame and said, \"May I know how I may address this immortal friend?\"</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
