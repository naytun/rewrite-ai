There are all facing the main street. In the Cape of Peace, a standard stall would cost at least 2,000 immortal crystals a day, and it would be very hard to get your hands on one. As long as you stay in Peace Hotel, you only need 1,000 immortal crystals a day to rent a stall here,\" The man pointed at the row of stalls and said proudly.</p><p>\"Then we’ll stay here,\" Mo Wuji said to Gai Guangyi and co, \"that fella had quite a bit of immortal crystals so there’s temporarily no need to worry about immortal crystals.\"</p><p>Actually, Mo Wuji had yet to open Wan Ping’s storage ring. However, he said these words to imply to Gai Guangyi that they also had a share of Wan Ping’s immortal crystals.</p><p>Gai Guangyi wasn’t a garrulous kind of person; when he heard Mo Wuji’s words, he expressed his consent.</p><p>When he heard that Mo Wuji had agreed to stay here, the smile on that solicitor got even wider as he said, \"We even have a deluxe suite, not only does it have a spiritual beast room, it also has pill rooms, smithing rooms, and even…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji lifted his hand and directly interrupted this fella’s words, \"There’s no need to introduce anything else. You only need to tell me, if the we stay in a normal room, is it possible to have four rooms for three years for 1,500,000 high grade immortal crystals. If it’s possible, then we’ll take a room immediately. If not, then we will leave right now.\"</p><p>\"Ah…\" This fella was dumbfounded. Who would bargain like Mo Wuji? He sliced the price by 150,000 immortal crystals at a single go, and he didn’t even give the other party a chance to negotiate. Moreover, this price that Mo Wuji stated was definitely impossible.</p><p>\"Of course it’s possible. I will call the shots then. Four rooms, 1,500,000 immortal crystals for three years.\" A clear crisp voice sounded; a pretty woman walked out.</p><p>When he laid eyes on this woman, the first person that came to Mo Wuji’s mind was Lou Yueshuang. This woman was also very pretty, but just like Lou Yueshuang, she was flat-chest. She’s truly a beautiful woman, but the ironing board at the front was a real pity.</p><p>As she waited for Mo Wuji to pay the immortal crystals, this woman said to Mo Wuji with some slight overtone in her voice, \"My name is Han Long, I’m the person in charge here. Perhaps in the future, I would need your help.\"</p><p>\"You recognise me?\" Mo Wuji furrowed his brows and said calmly.</p><p>Han Long smiled, \"To be honest, I don’t know you. It’s just that I recently made a trips to several Immortal Domains recently and I find you very familiar. If you don’t mind, I will visit you later.\"</p><p>Gai Guangyi was an experienced man; he didn’t say anything much, he only bid his farewells to Mo Wuji then hurriedly brought the other two to their rooms.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not mind. When he returned to his room, he brought Shuai Guo out.</p><p>100,000 over thousand high grade immortal crystals a year; this was already not a bad price even when compared to other Immortal Domains. However, the room here wasn’t very big; in Mo Wuji’s rough estimations, it was at most 20 square meters.</p><p>The first thing Mo Wuji did was to install a defensive array and a warning array. Even though fighting was not allowed here, he wasn’t going to go defenseless.</p><p>Before Mo Wuji could complete installing all his arrays, the seal on his door was activated. Mo Wuji released the seal and he saw Han Long standing at his door with a huge smile on her face.</p><p>\"It was bold of me to come unannounced. I seek Pill Master Mo’s understanding.\" The moment she opened her mouth, Han Long exposed Mo Wuji’s identity as a pill refiner. This let Mo Wuji know that the other party definitely recognised him.</p><p>\"Dao Friend Han, please come in.\" Mo Wuji nodded and allowed Han Long in.</p><p>Han Long didn’t behave courteously; she invited herself to sit as she entered the room. Waiting for Mo Wuji to reform the seal back on the door, she said, \"Does Pill Master Mo know his own predicament?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji clasped his fists and said, \"Pray tell.\"</p><p>Han Long’s tone turned serious, \"Pill Master Mo, not long ago, I went to several Immortal Domains. I have to tell you an unfortunate bit of news. Immortal Emperor Lun Cai already knows that you’re alive and he’s searching for you everywhere. I even heard that Yong Ying Immortal Domain’s Heavenly Emperor Kui Fengyun and the Vast Ocean Immortal School seem to be looking for you. They said that you are related to the death of Bai Chitian. There’s also this sect called Mirage Mountain that seems to be looking for you, even claiming that there’s a sect destroying grievance on you.\"</p><p>\"Then what about the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance?\" Mo Wuji wasn’t surprised that these people were looking for him; he had destroyed Hai Yi Continent’s Mirage Mountain and the Immortal World’s Mirage Mountain clearly went ahead to spread news of his survival.</p><p>Han Long said, \"The Pill Dao Immortal Alliance did not say anything, nor did they indicate any opinions.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji laughed coldly in his heart; not saying anything in itself was an opinion: the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance had completely abandoned him.</p><p>\"What about my Tian Ji Pill Court?\" Mo Wuji asked. From Han Long’s tone, he could tell that Han Long seemed to have specially investigated on him.</p><p>Indeed, Han Long answered, \"Tian Ji Pill Court was destroyed by Immortal Emperor Lun Cai. I heard that he even killed four people.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji suddenly stood up. Even though he already knew that Immortal Emperor Lun Cai had killed the people in Tian Ji Pill Court, when he heard it again, he could not help but want to charge out and kill Immortal Emperor Lun Cai.</p><p>Han Long didn’t do anything; she knew that since Mo Wuji came here, it meant that he wasn’t going to do anything rash.</p><p>Even though Mo Wuji wasn’t here to run away from his enemies as Han Long thought, he still calmed down. Immortal Emperor Lun Cai was not someone he could handle; there was no need to talk about Immortal Emperor Lun Cai, none of the people pursuing him were people he could handle.</p><p>Four people of Tian Ji Pill Court were killed. From the looks of it, Dou Hualong, Yi Lan and co. were probably already dead. Mo Wuji sighed in his heart; he originally gave refuge to those surviving disciples of Tian Ji Sect in his Tian Ji Pill Court. However, the contrary happened, they had been implicated by him. This filled his heart with guilt and discomfort.</p><p>\"If I was the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, for a Honored Grade Tier 5 Pill King, I would definitely come forward and make a stand. I wouldn’t allow Immortal Emperor Lun Cai and the rest continue to search for you.\" When Han Long saw Mo Wuji calm down, she made a statement on the side of Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji said indifferently, \"If no one in Tian Ji Pill Court were killed, I would have forgiven them. But now, I will not forgive them. Perhaps I wouldn’t seek the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance for revenge, but for me to reconcile with the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, is impossible. The Pill Dao Immortal Alliance didn’t stand out to say anything because they already know that I wouldn’t have any association with them.\"</p><p>If Mo Wuji knew what the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Head Xiao Lishi said, he would definitely be shocked at how terrifying Xiao Lishi was. Xiao Lishi had never met him, but was completely clear with the way that Mo Wuji thought.</p><p>The only difference was that Mo Wuji did not intend to antagonize the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance. Because of this, the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance was worried that Mo Wuji would cause problems for them in the future, so they wanted to choke this fire before it got any bigger.</p><p>\"So Pill Master Mo, it isn’t entirely safe for you in the Cape of Peace. Perhaps only Peace Resthouse can assure your safety,\" Han Long said.</p><p>Mo Wuji stared at Han Long in doubt, \"I’m now considered a customer of your Peace Hotel, but you’re advising me to stay at Peace Resthouse?\"</p><p>Han Long sighed, \"Because I’m stating the truth. I believe that in less than a month, countless of experts would come to the Cape of Peace to look for you. If you were taken away from Peace Hotel by an Immortal Emperor, it would also be detrimental to my Peace Hotel. Of course, I’m not talking about a fall in reputation.\"</p><p>What kind of person was Mo Wuji? He could already see through Han Long's intentions, \"Dao Friend Han, just go straight to the point. I believe that you didn't say those words completely because of Peace Hotel.\"</p><p>When Han Long heard Mo Wuji's words, she specially stood up and bowed to Mo Wuji, \"Pill Master Mo, I did indeed come here to ask you for help. The reason why I know so much about you was because I had specially investigated about you. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to locate your whereabouts. I never expected that when I disappointedly returned to the Cape of Peace, I would meet you. Perhaps, this is a kind of fate.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t say anything. He glanced at Han Long’s flat chest and felt a little confused. Han Long was at the Great Circle of the Grand Luo Immortal Stage. If she wanted a fuller chest, she didn’t need to specially find him.</p><p>Han Long felt Mo Wuji’s gaze; she shook her head and said, \"Pill Master Mo, I’m not referring to my chest. I know that you are a Honored Grade Tier 5 Pill King, and perhaps, you would soon be able to concoct Tier 6 immortal pills…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji interrupted Han Long’s words, \"Dao Friend Han Long, you just said something wrong. I’m not a Honored Grade Tier 5 Pill King. I’m already a Tier 6 Pill King.\"</p><p>When he was a Xuan Immortal, Mo Wuji could already concoct Tier 6 immortal pills, albeit low grade ones. Now that he had advanced to the Grand Yi Immortal Stage, even though he hadn’t tried to concoct any pills, Mo Wuji believed that he could definitely be able to concoct high grade Tier 6 pills. This was how confident he was of himself.</p><p>Mo Wuji guessed that Han Long probably wanted to engage in some trade with him. Since that’s the case, it would be better for him to have as many chips as possible. Since Han Long knew his predicament and still wanted to trade with him, she probably wouldn't do anything bad.</p><p>Mo Wuji's words seemed to be within Han Long's expectations; Mo Wuji was a Honored Grade Tier 5 Pill King, so how he be unable to concoct Tier 6 immortal pills? She nodded, \"Pill Master Mo, I want you to help me concoct a batch of Draining Immortal King Pills, but I don't have any Draining Immortal King Dao Fruit.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji frowned slightly, \"Dao Friend Han, I'm indeed a Tier 6 Pill King but I'm unable to concoct the Draining Immortal King Pill.\"</p><p>Han Long was currently in the Great Circle of the Grand Luo Stage, so it was not unexpected that she wanted the Draining Immortal King Pill. However, Mo Wuji wouldn't casually agree to such a request. It's true that he was unable to concoct Draining Immortal King Pill, but even if he was able to, he wouldn't agree to it. His cultivation was not high and he had too many enemies. If news got out that he could also concoct the Draining Immortal King Pill, wouldn't he be courting his own death? Moreover, Han Long didn't even have the main ingredient, the Draining Immortal King Dao Fruit, but she was still asking for a batch of pills. That's simply asking for too much.</p><p>Han Long didn't seem to know what was on Mo Wuji's mind; she continued speaking, \"I know that Pill Master Mo is unable to concoct the Draining Immortal King Pill, but I know that Pill Master Mo has a large number of Draining Immortal King Dao Fruits on him…\"</p><p>When Mo Wuji heard this, his face changed slightly. Previously, he had the backer of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, so it wasn't a problem for him to have the Draining Immortal King Dao Fruits on him. But now, if everyone knew that he had so many Draining Immortal King Dao Fruits, how terrifying would that be?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
