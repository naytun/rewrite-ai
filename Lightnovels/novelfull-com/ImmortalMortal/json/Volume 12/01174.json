If you have any escape methods, hurry and bring me away. I promise that I will not disappoint you.\" Kun Yun anxiously reacted. Seeing that Mo Wuji was still calmly speaking with Min Yuan, he hurriedly transmitted a message to Mo Wuji.</p><p>Unfortunately, Min Yuan had already installed a voice trasmission seal over this area. The moment Kun Yun sent that message, it was repeated out loud by the seal.</p><p>Kun Yun awkwardly stroked his head and carefully walked to the back of Mo Wuji. He was truly afraid of this fake Sage.</p><p>Mo Wuji chuckled, \"Kun Yun, did you betray me? Why were there ten fellas waiting outside for me? I'm not going to be calculative with that. Yes, I can bring you away. However, when we arrive at your treasure trove, I will get first-pick.\"</p><p>\"Anything you say, you only need to bring me away.\" At this point, how could Kun Yun still care about his hidden treasures?</p><p>Mo Wuji turned and looked at Min Yuan, \"You still haven't answered my question. Who on earth could have attacked you? You are a Sage after all, albeit a fake one.\"</p><p>\"You truly have balls…\" Min Yuan laughed in anger. Immediately, he conjured an elemental hand which grabbed towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>Previously, Mo Wuji was able to escape from him at his Sage Mountain. But if he allowed Mo Wuji to escape again, then he, Min Yuan, was truly useless.</p><p>When Min Yuan made a move, the 20 Unity Gods also surrounded Mo Wuji, sealing off all paths of retreat.</p><p>Looking at Min Yuan's overconfidence, Mo Wuji chuckled. This fella still thought that his cultivation was still the same. Mo Wuji didn't even retreat; he also conjured an elemental hand.</p><p>When Min Yuan saw that Mo Wuji had actually used an elemental hand to deal with his own, he stared at Mo Wuji in disbelief.</p><p>He had seen crazy people but this was the first time he saw someone as crazy as Mo Wuji. Originally, he only intended to capture Mo Wuji. But now that he saw Mo Wuji behaving so crazily, Min Yuan could no longer act patiently. The dao ripples within his elemental hand flowed and powerful Laws burst forth from the elemental hand.</p><p>He wanted to crush Mo Wuji's fleshly body into pieces. After which, he would force Mo Wuji's primordial spirit to explain where Mo Wuji actually got his balls from.</p><p>\"Boom!\" Mo Wuji's elemental hand clashed against Min Yuan's elemental hand. Laws exploded messily and disintegrated.</p><p>The spatial domain around them also started to collapse. Min Yuan immediately felt his body turning heavy and a powerful spatial force wrapped around him.</p><p>Just as a flame of anger ignited in his heart, it was doused by a bucket of cold water. The Laws that disintegrated were all his. Mo Wuji's Laws were like a firm boulder; after they destroyed his Laws, they went on to control the space around them. His anger instantly vanished and was replaced by a deep sense of fear.</p><p>\"You…\" Just as Min Yuan uttered this single word, a horrifying finger shot towards his forehead.</p><p>This Heaven and Earth could no longer tolerate him, Min Yuan. That finger which seemed to encompass the vastness of the universe stabbed towards his forehead.</p><p>How could Min Yuan waste any time? He waved his hand and whipped out a golden blanket.</p><p>\"Bang!\" Another violent explosion of Laws and elemental energy burst forth. Min Yuan could only feel that his domain and Laws were turned into juice by that finger.</p><p>A sense of helplessness inundated him. Min Yuan didn't even know how he could flee.</p><p>\"Crack!\" The sound of bone shattering could be heard. By the time Min Yuan could take another good look at Mo Wuji, all his spirit channels were already sealed. His Dao Laws were also restrained by Mo Wuji. An elemental hand was currently weapped around his neck, suspending him up in the air.</p><p>How was this possible? Min Yuan's eyes were filled with aghast. He completely couldn't believe that Mo Wuji could have gotten so strong. Could Mo Wuji be a Sage? Who else but Sages could be this strong?</p><p>It wasn't just Min Yuan, even the 20 Unity Gods that came with him were equally helpless. Mo Wuji's overwhelming strength was more than they could take.</p><p>The 20 Unity Gods only hesitated for a brief moment before transforming into 20 beams of light that shot away in all directions.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn't even bother chasing after those cultivators. He looked at the strangled Min Yuan and sighed, \"You actually call yourself a Great Sage with this bit of power? The way I look at it, your balls are bigger than mine.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji could not help but sigh. He felt that Min Yuan's power was roughly the same at Fang Shiyu. He had fought with Fang Shiyu before; Fang Shiyu was still a huge distance away from an actual Sage.</p><p>Even though Min Yuan probably lost so quickly he underestimated him, Min Yuan could probably only last a few more exchanges with him.</p><p>\"Brother Mo…\" Kun Yun stared agitatedly at the restrained Min Yuan. His voice was shaking.</p><p>In terms of salutations, he naturally changed from his usual Old Brother Mo to Brother Mo. [1]</p><p>Against Min Yuan, he could only die. On the other hand, he knew that Mo Wuji wasn't a greedy and covetous person. Of course, the premise was that he had to treat Mo Wuji with sincerity. Otherwise, what happened in his sea of consciousness previously would happen again. He was too clear of the way that Mo Wuji thought. If he worked with Mo Wuji, the best method was to try any schemes.</p><p>\"What do you want?\" Min Yuan struggled to spit out those words.</p><p>Mo Wuji said indifferently, \"What do I want? I have always treated those that tried to kill me equally. That is, kill.\"</p><p>\"Wait…\" Sensing Mo Wuji's rising killing intent, Min Yuan didn't dare to gamble with his life.</p><p>\"If you have anything to say, then say it.\" Mo Wuji eased his killing intent.</p><p>Min Yuan sucked a breath of air and said, \"You should know. Before the previous Cataclysm arrived, many people left their treasures with me for safekeeping. As long as you let go of me, I will give a portion of those treasures to you.\"</p><p>\"Only a portion?\" Mo Wuji laughed.</p><p>Min Yuan directly closed his eyes and said, \"That's right, only a portion. If you are going to kill me because I don't give all of them to you, then do it. Take it that I didn't say anything.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji's spiritual will landed on Min Yuan. Even after a long observation, he could tell that Min Yuan wasn't intentionally acting calm. Not only that, he could sense that Min Yuan had a sort of death conviction.</p><p>Mo Wuji sighed. This was the first time that he saw a fella who treasured his treasure more than his life. This fella was clearly a petty man and such a person actually called himself a Great Sage. If this Min Yuan encountered a vicious person, he would be dead by now.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn't really care about whether he killed Min Yuan or not. He only cared about the things that Min Yuan could give him. The Cataclysm was coming and he needed to raise his cultivation. Otherwise, he would also be in danger.</p><p>\"What can you offer? I want to see whether it's enough to buy your life.\" Mo Wuji said indifferently. At the same time, he loosened his grip around Min Yuan's neck.</p><p>\"What do you need?\" Min Yuan didn't answer Mo Wuji. Instead, he replied with a question.</p><p>Mo Wuji was thinking that he needed at least 1,000 peak-grade god spiritual veins and tens of thousands of high-grade god spiritual veins. However, he paused before he said what he thought. An expert negotiator definitely wouldn't reveal his bottom line.</p><p>He, Mo Wuji, wasn't an expert negotiator but he understood that simple principle.</p><p>\"You are the one that's pleading me. It's not the other way around. If your items aren't enough to satisfy me, then we will have to call off this deal. Regardless, there would be treasures waiting for me at Kun Yun's side. I can simply take Kun Yun's treasures and kill you to quench my anger.\" Mo Wuji stared at Min Yuan and spoke with an incomparably indifferent voice.</p><p>This time, Min Yuan didn't hesitate. He spoke with a clear voice, \"I can give you 10,000 peak-grade god spiritual veins, 100,000 high-grade god spiritual veins, 10 Tier 9 god herb gardens, 100 god herb gardens that are below Tier 9 and 821 peak-grade smithing materials. Among the smithing materials include a Ferry Bamboo…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji inhaled a breath of cold air. This fella was too rich. At a single go, he could offer 10,000 peak-grade god spiritual veins. He even had the Ferry Bamboo, that was one of the five greatest Houtian materials. The Rootless God Steel that he used to forge his Half Moon Weighted Halberd was also one of the five greatest Houtian materials. In other words, this Bamboo Ferry was a treasure on the same level as his Rootless God Steel.</p><p>Mo Wuji suddenly thought of a phrase: Poverty restricts one's imagination. Just now, he only wanted 1,000 peak-grade god spiritual veins. That was simply…</p><p>Kun Yun interjected, \"Min Yuan, before the previous Cataclysm came, countless cultivators left their treasures with you. Now, you are only offering this bit. Do you think that Brother Mo would agree?\"</p><p>Min Yuan said calmly, \"I can only offer these. If he agrees, then he will agree. If he doesn't agree, then he can kill me. I, Min Yuan, definitely wouldn't make a second offer.\"</p><p>\"I agree. As long as you can take out what you offered, I will not kill you in the Resting Land of Gods. Of course, if you offend me again in the future, then don't blame me for behaving without mercy.\" Mo Wuji didn't hesitate to say. He obtained these things as easily as picking money from the road. Moreover, they were extremely important to him. As for killing Min Yuan, it didn't really matter to him.</p><p>A petty person like Min Yuan was really true to his words. Such a person would rather allow himself be killed than to give his treasures away.</p><p>[1] It becomes a more formal Brother Mo. This is the same Brother Mo that Huan Ti and Tong Ming uses.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
