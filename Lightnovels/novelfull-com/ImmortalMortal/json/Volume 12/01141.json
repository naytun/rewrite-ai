One of the primordial spirits was immediately reduced into nothingness. Because of some red ring of protection, the other primordial spirit wasn't immediately killed.</p><p>However, even with that protective ring, that primordial spirit got significantly weaker.</p><p>Before Mo Wuji could attack for a second time, that primordial spirit shouted with a sharp voice, \"Dao Friend, please stop. I know of a great place to cultivate. It would definitely allow Dao Friend to make a breakthrough in the shortest time…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji, who actually wanted to strike again, forcefully stopped his actions.</p><p>He had come here to cultivate. This primordial spirit had stayed in the World of Ruins for god knows how many years; it definitely had a greater understanding of the locality than him.</p><p>When he saw Mo Wuji stop, this primordial spirit heaved a sigh of relief. It said with a tinge of lingering fear, \"I have eyes but I was blind to have actually offended this Dao Friend. To make up for my mistakes, I have decided to tell Dao Friend about the best location to cultivate which I only found after searching for millions of years.\"</p><p>This primordial spirit clearly knew how to quickly show that it could help Mo Wuji. That way, he could preserve his little life.</p><p>Mo Wuji snorted coldly and brought out the directional crystal ball that Tong Ming gave him.</p><p>When Mo Wuji's spiritual will entered the crystal ball, he was dumbfounded. Supposedly, a location marker would appear in the crystal ball when he arrived at the World of Ruins. However, there actually wasn't any marker; the crystal ball was still pitch black.</p><p>With such a crystal ball, how was he going to find the gathering place?</p><p>Mo Wuji didn't believe that Tong Ming would like about such things. If Tong Ming would lie here, then he wouldn't even have wanted to cooperate with Mo Wuji in the first place.</p><p>Mo Wuji's face turned slightly unsightly as he kept his directional crystal ball. From the looks of it, something had happened to the World of Ruins. Thus, the marker inscribed by Tong Ming wasn't able to be seen.</p><p>\"Dao Friend…\" Noticing Mo Wuji's unpleasant expression, this primordial spirit muttered nervously.</p><p>\"Hurry and lead the way. If you're lying, then don't blame me for behaving impolitely.\" Mo Wuji wasn't in a good mood; his voice contained a hint of killing intent.</p><p>\"Yes, yes. Dao Friend can rest assured. I'm sure that you will be satisfied with that location…\" After saying this, the primordial spirit hesitated slightly before he stuttered, \"After I bring Dao Friend over, can Dao Friend spare me once…\"</p><p>\"Lead the way first. We'll see if I'm satisfied.\" Mo Wuji said harshly.</p><p>Without a gathering place, he was increasingly worried for Ji Li. Tong Ming and Huan Ti were both cunning old foxes. It would be weird if these primordial spirits could possess them. As for Lian Ji, he stayed in a place like Cosmos God City for so long, thus he definitely wouldn't fall so easily.</p><p>This primordial spirit didn't dare to waste any time; it hurriedly floated ahead and led the way.</p><p>In less than half an incense's time, another primordial spirit charged out. This time, Mo Wuji didn't wait for this primordial spirit to utter any nonsense. He directly sealed the space around the primordial spirit and threw a ball of his Scholar's Heart at it, burning it into nothingness.</p><p>When the leading primordial spirit saw Mo Wuji's might, it started to shiver in fear. Which one of the primordial spirits here weren't past experts? But today, they were nothing more than ants in front of Mo Wuji. If Mo Wuji hadn't used the Spiritual Will Arrow previously and used this flame instead, he would have already lost his life.</p><p>\"What's your name and how long have you been here?\" Mo Wuji casually asked as he followed behind this primordial spirit.</p><p>\"Junior is called Wan He. After the Cataclysm, I had always been here…\" Wan He's voice was shaky. He was afraid of offending Mo Wuji. At the same time, he lowered his status to a junior.</p><p>\"Which God Throne did you obtain?\" Mo Wuji asked.</p><p>Wan He hurriedly and carefully answered, \"Junior didn't have a God Throne…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji didn't think that a fella without a God Throne could actually survive in this broken world for so many years. Clearly, this fella's tenacity was truly strong.</p><p>The place that Wan He talked about wasn't very far. After another incense's time, he stopped. They were still in this dried-up riverbed.</p><p>It was just that Wan He stopped at a tiny crack. This crack was only 15 centimetres wide and it was unfathomably deep. Mo Wuji's spiritual will only managed to reach a certain limit before he could not scan any further.</p><p>\"Senior, it's down there. It's just that it is slightly deep. I only went down once before and that single trip took me ten years…\" Wan He looked at Mo Wuji cautiously.</p><p>\"Since that's the case, then follow me and take a look.\" With a sweep of his hand, Mo Wuji brought Wan He to him and they entered the crack.</p><p>Wan He was wrapped around by a trace of elemental energy. His heart started to quiver with fear. His spiritual will couldn't be considered weak but they were actually moving at a speed where he couldn't even release his spiritual will. Clearly, Mo Wuji's speed was overwhelmingly strong. He suspected that even Sages might not be that fast.</p><p>In just a few days, Mo Wuji stopped. There was only a black stone in front of him.</p><p>After repeated sweeps with his spiritual will, Mo Wuji finally verified that there was only this black stone here.</p><p>\"This is the cultivation holyland?\" Mo Wuji's face sank and turned slightly unsightly.</p><p>Wan He could sense Mo Wuji's anger. He hurriedly said, \"Senior, please catch your breath. If you wait here for a few days, rich god spiritual energy would seep through. It's just that the time is extremely short and I only managed to discover it by chance. I believe that this is definitely the best-hidden spot for cultivation.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji stared at this primordial spirit and said, \"I will believe you this once.\"</p><p>After saying that, Mo Wuji crossed his legs and sat down. His spiritual eye started to examine this black stone.</p><p>In just a day, a terrifyingly rich wave of god spiritual energy seeped out of the black stone. Mo Wuji's spiritual eye happened to be on this black stone. Thus, the moment the god spiritual energy seeped out, his spiritual eye caught some slight movements.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not hesitate to inscribe ten array runes on this black stone. Indeed, a crack appeared. With a flash, Mo Wuji disappeared into this crack.</p><p>The god spiritual energy outside had already dissipated. When Wan He saw that Mo Wuji had disappeared, how could he dare to stay here any further? He hurried up. Even though he knew that it would take him 10 years to leave, he didn't want to stay here and wait for Mo Wuji.</p><p>The moment Mo Wuji's surroundings went clear, he knew that he had passed through that black stone.</p><p>At this instant, Mo Wuji's spiritual will swept out in a huge wave. Soon, he saw a huge pool. The pool water was faint gold. A kind of god spiritual energy that Mo Wuji had never felt before swept across him. His entire body felt incomparably relaxed.</p><p>He suspected that this wasn't even god spiritual energy. Instead, it was a form of spiritual energy which surpassed god spiritual energy.</p><p>Moreover, Mo Wuji actually didn't sense any Laws here.</p><p>This caused him to remember the Heavenly Chasm back in Immortal World. There was a space within the Heavenly Chasm which was devoid of life and elemental energy. There, Su Xi and him obtained the Void Nirvana Root. The reason why his cultivation could proceed so smoothly wasn't only due to his cultivation technique. The Void Nirvana Root had a huge part to play as well.</p><p>This place was similar; there weren't Laws and elemental energy. The only thing he can sense is the spiritual energy from the gold pool.</p><p>Something's not right, there's a stone statue next to the pool.</p><p>When Mo Wuji saw the stone statue, he knew that something was wrong. Immediately after, he knew that this wasn't a stone statue but a living person.</p><p>That stone statue seemed to know that Mo Wuji had discovered him. He sighed and said, \"Ai, how many years has it been? I haven't even recovered from the previous Cataclysm, but could it be that a more terrifying one is coming?\"</p><p>\"Who are you?\" Mo Wuji opened his hand and the Half Moon Weighted Halberd on his back landed in it.</p><p>The stone statue sighed, \"This is my place and you're actually asking me who I am?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji chuckled, \"This is your place? I don't think so, right? Although I don't know who this place belongs to, I'm sure you're not the first owner.\"</p><p>The stone statue nodded in agreement, \"You're right; I'm not the first owner. However, I can tell you that I am its last owner. Since you're here, then you don't have to leave.\"</p><p>With that, the stone statue suddenly reached out for Mo Wuji.</p><p>His hand was extremely slow; he seemed like an aged old man.</p><p>Mo Wuji looked at this slowly moving hand blankly. He was slightly speechless as he said, \"What has this world become? Why does every single person believe that they are so powerful and that they could easily crush others?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji could not be blamed for feeling speechless. He was experienced in combat and battles. Even his weakest enemy would try to seal the other party's space before attacking. However, when this stone statue attacked, it actually didn't form any spatial ripples. He, Mo Wuji, could still move normally.</p><p>If this kind of attack could crush him, then he would be better off smashing himself against a piece of tofu.</p><p>His Half Moon Weighted Halberd slashed out, conjuring a silver river which cascaded down to this horribly slow stone statue.</p><p>\"Kacha!\" A loud, crisp sound resounded. This stone statue's hand suddenly exploded and several drops of gold blood fell.</p><p>\"You… How are you able to use sacred arts…\" This stone statue seemed as though it had seen the world's most terrifying scene. It stared at Mo Wuji and spoke with a tone of intense disbelief.</p><p>Mo Wuji came to a sudden realisation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
