The moment he released his aura, the faint rumble of thunder could be heard in the air.</p><p>In just a single breath’s time, nine dancing lightning bolts came crashing down.</p><p>Yan Li’s physique was clearly not weak. Even though he didn’t charge up to face the lightning like Mo Wuji, he didn’t need to take out any form of defensive treasure; he simply accepted the blows of the lightning.</p><p>Waves of lightning landed on Yan Li. They tore through Yan Li’s skin, splashing fresh blood all over his body. Yan Li was truly tough; he didn’t release any grunts of pain, nor did he use any defensive treasure.</p><p>Standing by Mo Wuji’s side, Mo Qingche witnessed the sight with a palpitating heart. She said worriedly, \"Grandpa, this Lightning Calamity is so terrifying. In the future, would I also have to face it?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji said calmly, \"That’s right. If you wish to pursue greater heights, you need to pass a tribulation of lightning. If you fail, then you would be reduced to ashes.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t even try to encourage Mo Qingche. As a cultivator, if she couldn’t even accept this, then any encouragement was useless. He couldn’t possibly stay by Mo Qingche’s side the whole time; Mo Qingche would eventually have to walk on her own path.</p><p>Mo Qingche seemed to understand Mo Wuji intentions. She firmed her resolution and said, \"Grandpa, rest assured. In the future, when I’m facing this lightning, I definitely will not falter.\"</p><p>One day later, the Lightning Calamity finally dispersed. The bloodied and fatigued Yan Li finally passed it and he was greeted by rainbow clouds of recovery.</p><p>In half a day, Yan Li excitedly sprang out of the lightning-blasted ditch.</p><p>\"Big Brother, that Lightning Calamity is truly refreshing. I already feel the power of ascension. As long as I release my Heavenly Immortal aura, we would immediately be able to ascend.\" Yan Li elatedly ran over; his voice was filled with excitement.</p><p>Mo Wuji could also clearly feel a qualitative change in Yan Li; Yan Li was much stronger than before. Mo Wuji nodded and said, \"You can ascend now. I will follow you.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji hadn’t left the Immortal World for a long time, and this time was simply nothing for the experts of the Immortal World. However, the reason why Mo Wuji was so anxious was because of what he left behind.</p><p>It was true that he destroyed the Great Sword Path, but Mo Wuji was clear that the Great Sword Path’s greatest expert, Yi Minghu, was still alive.</p><p>There’s no need to talk about Yi Minghu. All three of the Grand Emperors and the Quasi-Emperor that surrounded him and tried to kill him were all still alive.</p><p>Moreover, his enemies weren’t simply these four. There were still Grand Emperor Lun Cai and the Alliance Head of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance.</p><p>It could be said that during his absence, his Ping Fan was left in a precarious state.</p><p>What kind of people was in Ping Fan? There was only one newly-advanced Grand Emperor, Wei Zidao. Wei Zidao’s abilities were not bad; he was able to control a faction within Sword Prison. However, compared to true experts, Wei Zidao wasn’t anything special.</p><p>\"Alright.\" Yan Li responded and immediately released his aura.</p><p>A loud rumble came from the vast void; a passage began to form above Yan Li’s head. A strong force of suction directly swept Yan Li up, sucking him away.</p><p>Mo Wuji extended his hand and grabbed Mo Qingche; he rushed up the passage together with Yan Li.</p><p>Just as Mo Wuji entered the passage, a powerful force of repulsion tried to push Mo Wuji away.</p><p>There seemed to be an obstacle within the passage. Yan Li was able to pass this obstacle unhindered, but Mo Wuji and Mo Qingche were blocked.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s heart race; he was clear that once Yan Li fully ascends, this passage would disappear completely. He would no longer be able to use this passage to return to the Immortal World.</p><p>At this instant, Mo Wuji didn’t hesitate any further. He retrieved a page of the Book of Luo to protect Mo Qingche. After which, he grabbed his Kun Wu Sword and cleaved down towards this obstacle.</p><p>A violent sword intent swept outwards, forming a tear on that obstacle. Mo Wuji then punched towards that tear, blowing it apart. A small gap appeared in front of Mo Wuji. Mo Wuji hurriedly grabbed Mo Qingche and raced through that gap.</p><p>Various kinds of spatial blades sailed past him. Even though Mo Wuji had a strong late-stage God Physique, injuries still formed throughout his body.</p><p>Mo Wuji was inwardly glad that he had used the Book of Luo to protect Mo Qingche. Otherwise, among these terrifying spatial blades, he would have no means of protecting Mo Qingche. The power of the Laws of the Heaven and Earth was truly terrifying. Now, he was trying to go against these Laws. If he were any weaker, he would have probably been killed.</p><p>After getting through that obstacle, Mo Wuji immediately felt immortal spiritual energy. A ripple filled with natural runes appeared in front of Mo Wuji. Mo Wuji was an array master and he had also recently learnt about different kinds of talismans. Thus, he only needed a single glance at these runes to know that they were transfer dao runes formed from the dao aura of the Heaven and Earth.</p><p>Mo Wuji had never ascended before. However, his spiritual will detected that Yan Li had entered those dao runes. Grabbing onto Mo Qingche, he went into those dao runes.</p><p>Indeed, after stepping into the dao runes, an otherworldly sensation flooded towards him. At the next instant, Mo Wuji landed in a deep pool surrounded by mists of spiritual energy.</p><p>Above this deep pool, there was a line of huge golden words: Luo Ling Immortal Domain Tenth Ascension Pond.</p><p>\"Big Brother, the immortal spiritual energy here is really rich.\" Yan Li was incomparably excited. As he was speaking, he had already sat down and started to stabilise his cultivation.</p><p>On the other hand, Mo Qingche’s cultivation was too low to feel the benefits from the ascension pond.</p><p>Mo Wuji waited for Yan Li for half a day. After Yan Li stabilised his Heavenly Immortal cultivation, he also stopped cultivating.</p><p>…</p><p>Mo Wuji knew that every Immortal Domain had several ascension ponds. It was just that he didn't come to Immortal World through the usual means, so his understanding towards the ascension ponds was limited.</p><p>No immortals were allowed into the ascension pond. One reason for that was because the passage to the cultivation world was in the ascension pond. Even though an ordinary person could not open the passage, this was still a top secret of the Immortal World.</p><p>After Mo Wuji and co. left the ascension pond, they arrived at a huge hall.</p><p>Before the three of them could ask anything, two immortals came to them, \"Are the three of you newly ascended?\"</p><p>The one speaking was a Golden Immortal. The moment he finished his question, he felt that something was wrong. Yan Li did have the aura of a newly ascended Heavenly Immortal. However, Mo Wuji and Mo Qingche looked no different from mortals. They didn't even have the aura of ascension on them. How could they also be newly ascended immortals?</p><p>\"You brought mortals into the Immortal World?\" The other person stared at Yan Li and shouted.</p><p>There weren't many people in the hall, but when they heard those words, they all swarmed over. In their perspectives, anyone that could bring mortals during ascension definitely had some powerful treasure.</p><p>Usually, it should be safe for a newly ascended immortal. Not only did the Immortal Domains extend some form of protection towards these newly ascended immortals, experts also wouldn't lower themselves to attack a newbie.</p><p>After all, how could a newly ascended immortal possibly be worth attacking?</p><p>But now that Yan Li had revealed himself to have some peak grade treasure, things were different.</p><p>Mo Wuji was rather speechless; an ordinary cultivator could bring a mortal up to the Immortal World? These people needed to add some points their intelligence. He was an Immortal Emperor, one that wasn't restricted by the Laws of the Heaven and Earth at that. Even so, he needed to borrow the help of Kun Wu Sword to use the ascension passage to get to the Immortal World. How could an ordinary person be capable of doing such a thing?</p><p>Yan Li said disdainfully, \"Are you stupid? If I had a treasure to bring mortals up to the Immortal World, I wouldn't reveal bring the mortals into this hall.\"</p><p>\"Let's go, Yan Li.\" Mo Wuji wasn't in the mood to waste any time. He knew of Luo Ling Immortal Domain. Immortal Empress Wen Lan was from Luo Ling Immortal Domain. Not only that, the Great Sword Path that he exterminated those years ago was also from Luo Ling Immortal Domain.</p><p>Seeing Mo Wuji and co. leave the hall, the few cultivators gave each other knowing glances. Thereafter, they all sped after Mo Wuji and co.</p><p>Facing newly ascended cultivators, they didn't dare to publicly attack them in an immortal city. If the group of them walked into an immortal city, then things would no longer be so easy.</p><p>Mo Qingche asked in confusion, \"Grandpa, aren't mortals prohibited from using the ascension passage? These people seem intent on stopping us. Since that's the case, why don't they use that as an excuse?\"</p><p>Yan Li snickered, \"If they used that excuse, then our treasures would no longer belong to them.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji didn't even bother to place these puny fish in his eyes. His spiritual will had already spread into the distance. He didn't specifically try to break open the immortal city's seals. With the strength of his spiritual will, he was able to quickly locate the position of the transfer array.</p><p>Through that scan, Mo Wuji also found out where they were. This was a famous immortal city in Luo Ling Immortal Domain - Ding Po Immortal City.</p><p>Mo Wuji was all too familiar with Ding Po Immortal City. Those years ago, those big sects had set up a trap array here in an attempt to ambush him. Because of Han Qingru's warning, he was able to avoid it. Even so, he almost perished in the void outside Ding Po Immortal City.</p><p>Mo Wuji also knew of a cultivator from Ding Po Immortal City called Chen Hu. Chen Hu was an Eight Star Talent. Back in the third level of the Broken World, he had a trade with Chen Hu. Chen Hu's character was not bad; he was steady and magnanimous. Mo Wuji even heard that Chen Hu's father was also an Immortal Emperor. However, he also heard that Chen Hu had already perished in Cosmos Edge.</p><p>He never thought that he would return back to Ding Po Immortal City. From the looks of it, he was rather fated with this immortal city.</p><p>Mo Wuji's spiritual will soon extended beyond Ding Po Immortal City. Outside Ding Po Immortal City, a huge wanted order was erected.</p><p>Mo Wuji knew that person on the wanted poster all too well. It was himself. It was written clearly on the poster, he was accused of plundering the resources of the Immortal World, killing the innocent, and committing many other misdeeds. All cultivators were encouraged to do a good deed and kill Mo Wuji. At the same time, anyone that provided news on Mo Wuji would be hugely rewarded.</p><p>Seeing this wanted order, Mo Wuji's heard sunk. He wasn't afraid of being arrested; with his power, who in the Immortal World would dare to arrest him? Instead, he was worried about his Ping Fan Immortal School. If even he, the sect head of Ping Fan, was wanted, it would be weird if Ping Fan was left unscathed.</p><p>Mo Wuji's spiritual will continued to extend outwards. When he saw several corpses nailed below the wanted order, Mo Wuji was thoroughly incensed.</p><p>There was a clear description below those corpses: Mo Wuji's companions.</p><p>Mo Wuji opened his palm, calling out Shuai Guo and Da Huang. He had an overcast expression as he said, \"Da Huang, you and Shuai Guo protect Yan Li and Qingche. Today, many people are going to die.\"</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
