But before that, I will return to my Ping Fan Immortal School. No matter who they are, anyone that dared to kill the innocent of my Ping Fan Immortal School must pay the price.\" Mo Wuji didn’t continue further; he didn’t have time to talk about how he had exterminated the Gods Race and that the Human Race now had rights in Cosmos Edge.</p><p>\"Sect Head Mo, under the leadership of the Very High Heavens and three huge sects, many experts have gathered to attack it. That entire area is prohibited from entry.\" A person within the crowd explained Ping Fan’s current situation. In reality, no one was really clear about the exact situation; all these information were largely based on rumours.</p><p>\"Sect Head Mo, we are willing to follow you.\"</p><p>…</p><p>Mo Wuji clasped his fists and said, \" There are some people in Ding Po Immortal City that participated in the attack on my Ping Fan Immortal School. I hope that everyone can provide the names of those people.\"</p><p>\"I know, Ma Kangxuan, Di Yi…\"</p><p>\"There’s also Wan Mi’s disciple…\"</p><p>In a short period of time, more than a hundred names were mentioned. With a quick scan with his spiritual will, Mo Wuji found that there were approximately a hundred people in the Castellan Estate. He was worried that Ping Fan might be in danger. He directly formed a huge palm of immortal elemental energy.</p><p>The entire Castallen Estate was crashed into dust.</p><p>\"Immortal Friend Chen San, Ding Po Immortal City no longer has a Castellan. I have to trouble Immortal Friend Chen San to temporarily control Ding Po Immortal City,\" Mo Wuji said before he left.</p><p>Chen San answered seriously, \"Sect Head Mo, I am naturally willing to take up the mantle. It’s just that I want to follow Sect Head Mo to Ping Fan Immortal School. I, Chen San, might not very strong, but I might be able to be of help.\"</p><p>\"We are also willing to help Mo Wuji, kill those shameless b*stards of the Very High Heavens,\" Some people shouted from the crowd.</p><p>Mo Wuji could only say, \"I, alone, am enough to deal with the matter regarding Ping Fan. After I’m done with that, and when I’m going to storm the Very High Heavens, I welcome everyone to join me.\"</p><p>\"Since that’s the case, I will stay here and organise Ding Po Immortal City. In the future, I will definitely follow Sect Head Mo to the Very High Heavens.\" Chen San said in a straightforward manner. He was clear that Mo Wuji wasn’t boasting. With Mo Wuji’s power, even if there were any more people encircling Ping Fan, it still wouldn’t be enough.</p><p>\"Brother Qu, what happened to these friends of your?\" Mo Wuji turned to Qu Yang and asked.</p><p>Qu Yang clasped his fists towards Mo Wuji and said, \"The few of us were from Half Immortal Domain. Previously, we helped to speak up for Brother Mo and we were caught by the men from the Castellan Estate. Wan Mi personally nailed us to the city wall. If not for that b*stard Wan Mi torturing me, I would have died a long time ago. The three of them truly died for no good reason. I have implicated them, ai…\"</p><p>It was exactly as Qu Yang said; among the four of them, only he was alive. These three people could not even be called people anymore. It was more accurate to call them dry wood; their bones were withered and there was no intact piece of meat left on their bodies.</p><p>Seeing these three corpses, Mo Wuji could only sigh in his heart. He didn’t know these people. It could be said that these people managed to survive and come to the Immortal World because of him. They wouldn’t have expected that when they got to the Immortal World, they would be killed over a single sentence by a b*stard like Wan Mi. If Mo Wuji knew about this beforehand, he definitely wouldn’t have let Wan Mi have such a simple death.</p><p>\"Brother Qu, are you willing to follow me back to Ping Fan?\" Mo Wuji invited Qu Yang. However, he could guess that with Qu Yang’s pride, Qu Yang probably wouldn’t follow him.</p><p>Indeed, Qu Yang said, \"I know that if I go to Ping Fan Immortal School, my path would be smoother. However, I swore that I would definitely rebuild the Absolute Saber Sect in the Immortal World one day. Thus, I cannot follow Brother Mo.\"</p><p>\"Then Brother Qu, take care of yourself. Also, I have to request Brother Qu to help me take care of the funerals of these few friends.\" Mo Wuji clasped his fists towards Qu Yang, then he bowed towards the three withered corpses. After which, he retrieved his flying car and sped off with Shuai Guo, Da Huang and Mo Qingche.\"</p><p>He didn’t directly give Qu Yang a storage ring; when he left, he secretly slipped a ring on Qu Yang’s finger. By the time Qu Yang calms himself down, he would naturally notice it.</p><p>\"Go, let’s also go to Ping Fan immortal Sect. After Ping Fan emerges from its encirclement, I will be the first to follow Sect Head Mo to storm the Very High Heavens.\" The moment Mo Wuji left, someone within the crowd shouted.</p><p>\"Right. Also, we should spread the disgraceful deeds of the Very High Heavens to all the Immortal Domains. We must let everyone open their eyes and see the true appearance of the Very High Heavens.\"</p><p>…</p><p>The area around Ping Fan Immortal School was indeed sealed. The ones that sealed it were five Grand Emperors, namely Great Sword Path’s Yi Minghu, Lightning Sect’s Lei Guyun, Vast Ocean Immortal School’s Jin Yusheng. There were also two Grand Emperors from the Very High Heavens, one was Dao Emperor Zi Changluo’s loyal subordinate, Ping Lishang, and the other was the Jin Clan’s Jin Yu.</p><p>Ping Fan Immortal School was built on the edge of Extreme Glade Sea, a portion of it was even built on Extreme Glade Sea itself. Under the combined attack of many experts, Ping Fan’s herb farm and immortal city had already been destroyed. Countless simple immortals and mortals were killed.</p><p>Even so, Ping Fan had not been completely broken through. It was rumoured that when the Very High Heavens first invaded Ping Fan Immortal School, an expert passed by. This expert had driven away the experts from the Very High Heavens.</p><p>After this expert sent the men from the Very High Heavens’ away, that expert didn’t stay in Ping Fan for long. It was just that before this expert left, this expert left a defensive array over Ping Fan that was far above Grade 9 immortal arrays. Even the Grand Emperors of the Very High Heavens weren’t able to forcefully break this array apart.</p><p>However, the most powerful of defensive arrays will still experience a day of its destruction. After multiple years of attack on the defensive array, Ping Fan had been forced into a corner. One could imagine that this array would eventually be collapsed.</p><p>…</p><p>Mo Wuji stood outside Ping Fan Immortal School. It was exactly as he heard: Ping Fan’s territory had been sealed. Outside the seals, there was a sign: Ping Fan Immortal School opposes the Dao and disrupts the order of Immortal World. Their Sect Head, Mo Wuji, bullies the weak and behaves arrogantly. By orders of the Very High Heavens, Ping Fan Immortal School will be destroyed, all living things will be killed…</p><p>Below this sign, there were also the imprints of several huge sects. The most conspicuous ones were from Great Sword Path, Lightning Path, Vast Ocean Immortal School, Mirage Mountain, and Immortal Universe Sword School. What left Mo Wuji confused was that he didn’t see the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance. And if that wasn’t enough, he also didn’t see Lun Cai’s Unfettered Emperor Palace.</p><p>Logically, Lun Cai should he the person that was most eager to kill him.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s spiritual eye could see through the seals clearly, the outer fringes of Ping Fan Immortal Sect had already been reduced into a wasteland. Chen San said that Ping Fan Immortal School was slightly broken, but at this instant, Mo Wuji could see that it was far from that. In fact, Ping Fan had already been forced into the Extreme Glade Sea itself.</p><p>Mo Wuji could also see why Ping Fan was still standing. It was because someone had installed an additional peak grade array around Ping Fan; this array was one that even he couldn’t install. He could only feel some signs of the immortal sealing array from it.</p><p>Mo Wuji then saw the cultivators attacking the array. He inhaled deeply. The killing intent in his heart now was far greater than when he was dealing with the Gods Race.</p><p>Even Shuai Guo and Da Huang, who were standing by Mo Wuji’s side, could clearly feel Mo Wuji’s killing intent.</p><p>Mo Wuji opened his hand and the Half Moon Weighted Halberd appeared in his palm.</p><p>He didn’t know how long it had been since he used his Half Moon Immortal Halberd. At this instant, only the Half Moon Weighted Halberd could fully display his killing intent and rage.</p><p>\"Boom!\" His Half Moon Immortal Halberd conjured a huge halberd light. With a flash of the halberd light, it struck right at the core of the seals. The seal formed by the five Grand Emperors were directly turned into dust by this single halberd slash.</p><p>\"Who dares to attack the seal?\" An early stage Immortal Emperor shouted harshly. Before he even revealed himself, a blinding light came shooting towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t even falter. He only took half a step forward and that light directly dissipated. Following which, his Half Moon Weighted Halberd moved lightly. This early stage Immortal Emperor didn’t even have the chance to speak; he was sliced in half and his primordial spirit had shattered.</p><p>There were thousands of people encircling Ping Fan Immortal School; the lowest cultivation here was already at the Grand Luo Immortal Stage. Mo Wuji saw seven Immortal Emperors and there were four Grand Emperors among them.</p><p>When Mo Wuji killed that early stage Immortal Emperor, all the attackers reacted. They stopped their attacks on the array and stared at Mo Wuji warily.</p><p>\"This Emperor is the Very High Heavens’s Ping Lishang. Who are you? Why did you destroy my Very High Heavens’ seal? Do you want to be an enemy of the entire Immortal World?\" An icy-cold voice sounded.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t even answer. His Half Moon Weighted Halberd conjured millions of halberd light; these halberd light then transformed into a huge span of desert. No life seemed capable of surviving in this grand desert.</p><p>As Grand Desert was forming, three silver rivers came cascading down from the sky. Winding River was majestic and brimming with killing intent.</p><p>After Mo Wuji’s sea of consciousness strengthened, his Winding River had become more powerful. If not because Mo Wuji didn’t want anyone to escape, he would have sent five of his Winding River down.</p><p>\"This person is Mo Wuji. Everyone, attack together…\" Lei Guyun shouted harshly. Seeing that Mo Wuji had the galls to attack them, killing intent rushed into his mind.</p><p>Mo Wuji wanted to kill him, Lei Guyun. He, Lei Guyun, also wanted to kill Mo Wuji. Thus, the moment he saw Mo Wuji, he instantly pounced towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>The first one to respond to Lei Guyun was Vast Ocean Immortal School’s Jin Yusheng.</p><p>When Jin Yu saw Mo Wuji, he also eagerly charged over. He followed behind Lei Guyun and Jin Yusheng. He was clearer than anyone else about how terrifying Mo Wuji was. However, he also needed to be close to snatch the stuff on Mo Wuji. Only he knew exactly how many priceless treasures Mo Wuji had.</p><p>\"Pff! Pff! Pff!\" Multiple mists of blood formed. Under Mo Wuji’s halberd light, except the Immortal Emperors and some powerful Immortal Reverents, no one survived.</p><p>\"Boom! Boom! Boom!\" Three silver rivers came cascading down. The Immortal Emperors that were under the river were directly sliced in half.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t even bother about the cultivators that he had easily squashed. Instead, he welcomed the oncoming Lei Guyun with a finger. No one will escape from this place alive; he will no longer show any mercy.</p><p>Under this finger, the sky started to change colour and the clouds started to tremble.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
