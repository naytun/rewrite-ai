Before he died, he saw a trail of blood form on Mo Wuji's chest. At the same time, he saw six other Immortal Emperors suffer the same fate as him; they all perished under Mo Wuji's Half Moon Weighted Halberd.</p><p>This person's too strong. This was this black-robed Grand Emperor's final thought.</p><p>Mo Wuji simultaneously used three sacred arts: Grand Desert, Winding River and Wheel of Life and Death. In a short time, he killed seven Immortal Emperors, including the black-robed Grand Emperor. He, himself, received a deep scar on his chest from that black-robed Grand Emperor's square gong.</p><p>It could be said that if not for Mo Wuji's strong physique and his Grand Desert's trap array, that square gong could have ripped him in half at a single go.</p><p>Mo Wuji took in a deep breath, then he activated his Grand Desert once more. Millions of halberd light instantly transformed into array flags, forming a complete Grade 7 immortal killing array. It was true that a Grade 7 array was unable to trap an Immortal Emperor. However, this array was formed from Mo Wuji's sacred art. Thus, it would continuously change according to Mo Wuji's will.</p><p>At the same time, he shot two Spiritual Will Arrows. These two Spiritual Will Arrows were locked onto two late-stage Immortal Emperors. As for the remaining six Immortal Emperors, which were at the early and intermediate stage, Mo Wuji slashed out his Winding River once more towards them.</p><p>\"Boom! Boom! Boom!\" The boundless halberd light was struck down by the combined attacks of the eight Immortal Emperors. Explosions reverberated throughout the entire Heaven’s Beyond Dao Plaza.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s Winding River descended down at an oblique angle; this beautiful halberd light came cascading down like a crescent ring.</p><p>\"Pff! Pff! Pff!\" Mists of blood exploded. At this point, Mo Wuji felt a wave of weakness from his sea of consciousness. He knew that he was over-extended himself.</p><p>Two early-stage Immortal Emperors didn’t even have the ability to resist as they were cut down by Mo Wuji’s oblique Winging River. That one late-stage Immortal Emperor, that hadn’t been locked on by Mo Wuji’s Spiritual Will Arrow, and two intermediate stage Immortal Emperors used the instant that Mo Wuji used to kill those two early-stage Immortal Emperors to break through Mo Wuji’s Grand Desert Array. Thereafter, three magic treasures came simultaneously towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s sea of consciousness ached. The spiritual will in his spirit storage channel came to supplement it.</p><p>Even so, the gap in Mo Wuji’s Grand Desert Array became bigger and bigger. Now, there was another magic treasure that came towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s sense of danger was tingling. At this point, Mo Wuji could no longer hold back on his methods; he took out two pages of the Book of Luo.</p><p>Even in the Oblique Space Sea Island, Mo Wuji didn’t take out the Book of Luo. This was because he didn’t want others to know that he had the Book of Luo. Even though he still didn’t want others to know, when his life was being threatened, Mo Wuji could no longer keep them under covers.</p><p>Ape Mo had been paying attention to Mo Wuji. He knew that Mo Wuji was very strong, but Mo Wuji was currently facing 15 Immortal Emperors at the same time. Even though they might not be attacking in a group formation, it still wouldn’t be easy to deal with them.</p><p>When he saw Mo Wuji get injured by that black-robed Grand Emperor, and was also currently being targeted by multiple magic treasures, Ape Mo prepared to act.</p><p>But just at this moment, he saw Mo Wuji take out two pages of the Book of Luo. These two pages were like two huge barriers; the four magic treasures were blocked by the barriers formed from the Book of Luo.</p><p>An intense rumble pervaded through the air; the surrounding space started to tremble. Ape Mo sighed in relief. He knew that when Mo Wuji took out the Book of Luo, Mo Wuji would no longer be in danger.</p><p>\"Mo Wuji, I, An Xuecheng, have wanted to kill you for a long time. Today, you finally presented yourself in front of my door…\" An airy voice could suddenly be heard. Thereafter, three figures could be seen charging towards them.</p><p>Two figures charged straight to Ape Mo. The other one, a man in white robes, descended from the air and punched towards Mo Wuji’s Grand Desert Array.</p><p>\"If you want to attack, you would first have to ask me, Ape Mo.\" Ape Mo wielded his Wolf Fang Mace. The moment this Wolf Fang Mace appeared, the space under it seemed to go under the Wolf Fang Mace’s control.</p><p>At this point, Nong Xiaoyu and Yan Wei, who had already retreated to the fringes, hurriedly retreated once more.</p><p>The two early stage Immortal Emperors, that wanted to block Ape Mo, weren’t even able to take out their magic treasures before they were sealed in place by Ape Mo’s domain and the Wolf Fang Mace’s killing intent.</p><p>\"Pff! Pff!\" Two mists of blood exploded; these two Immortal Emperors died simultaneously. Ape Mo didn’t even bother retrieving his Wolf Fang Mace. He formed a hand seal and the Wolf Fang Mace sped towards An Xuecheng.</p><p>Feeling his life being threatened, An Xuecheng could not help but retract the fist that he was aiming towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>…</p><p>Mo Wuji’s sea of consciousness ached. Four Immortal Emperors grabbed this opportunity to attack Mo Wuji. Mo Wuji’s Book of Luo had only given him a short instant.</p><p>Those two late-stage Immortal Emperors that were locked on by Mo Wuji’s Spiritual Will Arrow also grabbed this opportunity. Even though the two hadn’t released themselves from the Spiritual Will Arrow, they still sent their magic treasures flying towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>\"Boom! Boom! Boom!\" The magic treasures landed on Mo Wuji’s Book of Luo. The Book of Luo’s majestic aura started to dissipate. At this instant, Mo Wuji’s Winding River merged with his Grand Desert. Once again, another three mists of blood formed.</p><p>\"Kacha!\" Mo Wuji’s ribs shattered. Even though he was protected by the Book of Luo, and he had his Grand Desert Array, he was still unable to remain unscathed.</p><p>The ashen Mo Wuji had a trail of blood flowing out the corner of his lips. However, he didn’t retreat. His Winding River had just fully merged with his Grand Desert. A Setting Sun and a 30-meter long halberd light directly tore through this space.</p><p>The Four Halberd Strikes’ Setting Sun and Remnant Chasm were simultaneously released. As he used these two sacred arts, Mo Wuji grabbed a handful of Zhi Nature Pills and popped them in his mouth.</p><p>This was the first time he used all Four Halberd Strikes: three intent-level sacred arts and one killing sacred art.</p><p>His sea of consciousness was already aching before this. After using these two sacred arts, the violet lake within his sea of consciousness began to surge with greater intensity. The violet energy within the violet lake instantly filled the entire sea of consciousness. At this instant, the ache caused by the overuse of spiritual will faded rapidly.</p><p>Mo Wuji celebrated wildly. He never thought that the violet lake in his sea of consciousness could have such a useful power.</p><p>The spiritual will in his sea of consciousness gradually regained its strength. Likewise, the aura in the Setting Sun and the Remnant Chasm began to surge. At this time, Mo Wuji did not hesitate to release another sacred art, Boundless Lightning Rain.</p><p>Because of Mo Wuji’s previous insufficient spiritual will, the power in his two Spiritual Will Arrows weakened significantly; they weren’t even able to kill those two late-stage Immortal Emperors. Even so, those two Spiritual Will Arrows were still insanely strong. Those two late-stage Immortal Emperors were heavily injured to the point where they were strongly vomiting blood. Their sea of consciousness even started to evaporate.</p><p>These two heavily injured late stage Immortal Emperors weren’t even comparable to an early stage Immortal Emperor.</p><p>Space trembled; the sun started to set. The remaining Immortal Emperors all felt a sense of desolation; they felt a grief which seemed to tear at their very souls. A 30-meter long Remnant Chasm came descending down towards them. No one was able to dodge.</p><p>Even though they knew that Mo Wuji was also injured, no one chose to attack Mo Wuji. They all retreated frantically.</p><p>\"Crack!\" Whether it was a domain or a magic treasure, they all shattered. Thereafter, boundless lightning bolts came flashing towards them. Multiple corpses fell from the sky.</p><p>The surroundings finally calmed down. Only a single late-stage Immortal Emperor was left. He stood there, staring blankly at the bloodied Mo Wuji. 15 Immortal Emperors attacked Mo Wuji; there were even three late-stage Immortal Emperors and a Grand Emperor among the 15. How long had it been? He was the only one left?</p><p>A sense of weakness pervaded throughout Mo Wuji’s body. However, Mo Wuji did not care as he waved his Half Moon Weighted Halberd to conjure a halberd light.</p><p>\"House Master Mo, please stay your hand. I concede defeat. I’m an Immortal Emperor of Cosmos Edge, I don’t have much enmity with you…\"</p><p>This late-stage Immortal Emperor cried out frantically. He wanted to escape, however, this entire space was sealed by Mo Wuji’s domain. He couldn’t even retreat.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t even bother saying a word. The halberd light sailed through the air. After that blood mist dissipated, Mo Wuji swept up the ten over storage rings.</p><p>There was no need to talk about your identity as someone from Cosmos Edge. Even if you were the boss of the Heaven’s Beyond Cosmos, as long as you tried to kill Mo Wuji, Mo Wuji would not show mercy. Moreover, among the ten over Immortal Emperors that attacked him, the only ones that posed a true threat were the three late-stage Immortal Emperors and that black-robed Grand Emperor.</p><p>\"Pff!\" An Xuecheng coughed out a mouthful of fresh blood as he came falling from the sky. He stared at Ape Mo in aghast.</p><p>Previously, he thought that Ape Mo was just a random lackey of Mo Wuji’s. Now, he knew Ape Mo was an expert that could even kill Grand Emperors.</p><p>\"Who are you? Why…\" An Xuecheng did not continue asking. He saw that Mo Wuji had slaughtered the last Immortal Emperor. An Xuecheng’s heart suddenly started to tremble. He even felt regret for antagonising Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji had single-handedly killed 15 Immortal Emperors, among which were three late-stage Immortal Emperors and a Grand Emperor. He, An Xuecheng, could only dream of such power.</p><p>It was true that he, An Xuecheng, was one of the Five Great Grand Emperors of Cosmos Edge. However, if he was in Mo Wuji’s position… No, even if the number of Immortal Emperors attacking was reduced by half, he would still die. Moreover, Mo Wuji had the help of a heaven-defying expert like Ape Mo. There was no longer anyone that could threaten Mo Wuji in Cosmos Edge.</p><p>\"House Master Mo, previously I was not in Cosmos Edge. That may be the reason for our misunderstanding…\" An Xuecheng no longer had any thoughts of killing Mo Wuji. Anxiety could be heard in his voice.</p><p>This was the Cosmos Edge. If Mo Wuji was bent on killing him, he definitely wouldn’t be able to escape.</p><p>Mo Wuji completely disregarded An Xuecheng’s words. He only spoke to Ape Mo, \"Ape Mo, when I’m killing this person, you need to make sure that he doesn’t escape…\"</p><p>Before he even finished speaking, Mo Wuji had already taken a step forward. His whirlpool domain came surging towards An Xuecheng.</p><p>Until now, Ape Mo finally answered, \"Wuji, rest assured. If I can’t even defend against a</p><p>mere intermediate stage Immortal Emperor, then I, Ape Mo, might as well be sleeping.\" [1]</p><p>It was true that An Xuecheng was powerful. Even so, he was only a mere intermediate stage Immortal Emperor.</p><p>\"Mo Wuji, you won’t get any benefits from killing me. If we join hands, we will both get to benefit…\" Seeing Mo Wuji’s surging killing intent, An Xuecheng hurriedly retrieved his magic treasure and released his domain. His mouth never stopped moving.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s face was calm. He only sent a finger towards An Xuecheng.</p><p>[1] I think this is cos the Oblique Space Sea Island has different standards. Like how Grand Emperors there are actually far more powerful than Dao Emperors in Cosmos Edge.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
