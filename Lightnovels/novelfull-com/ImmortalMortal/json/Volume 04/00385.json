Initially, the two of them wanted to support Mo Wuji in his fight but they realised it would be impossible to even go any closer to Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji immediately released a lightning web which instantly restrained the futon.</p><p>In only a few breaths time and a crackling sound, Mo Wuji’s lightning web was dissipated by the temperature of the flaming futon 1  .</p><p>Mo Wuji guessed that Cang Jue must have used this futon to massacre the entire Nine Mo City because there was a flame within the futon which he couldn’t visibly see but was extremely powerful.</p><p>He mustn't let this futon continue expanding outwards because who knew how terrifying the end state of this expanding futon could be? If he were to wait till this flame reached the Piercing Wind City, even if he was still alive, he wouldn’t be able to do anything to save the city.</p><p>His Tian Ji Pole was swung out as it turned into pole shadows charging towards the futon.</p><p>\"Boom!\" Tian Ji Pole struck against the futon with about 3 metres radius and instead of breaking this futon, it ignited a formless flame that covered the entire sky. The insane heat scorched across space and even burnt Mo Wuji’s hair.</p><p>It seemed like because of the power of Mo Wuji’s pole, the flaming futon stopped expanding as it started to bend downwards instead.</p><p>This space within the futon was about to engulf Mo Wuji into its centre as the temperature was even more terrifying than before.</p><p>\"You are merely a Worldly Immortal Stage expert and you dare act against me?\" Cang Jue chuckled before slapping the futon a few times.</p><p>A few flaming radiances were then shot out from the futon towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>The temperature within the futon space was frightening and even though he had experienced the testing heat of the Scholar’s Heart, he could still feel the heating up of his body and even his elementary energy shield was unable to fend against it. The moment his elemental energy shield was burnt away by this heat, his clothing and skin would be next. Mo Wuji took in a breath of cold air because it wasn’t because he was careless that he was trapped by the flaming futon but because he was curious how powerful it was.</p><p>Mo Wuji tried to teleport and he noticed that in this flaming space, there seemed to be a unique law which constraint him as every time he teleport, he only moved a tiny step.</p><p>Mo Wuji barely managed to dodge the incoming flaming radiance while Cang Jue was still ferociously hitting on the flaming futon.</p><p>As more flaming radiance were being shot over, the temperature within the flaming futon was still rising and Mo Wuji’s movement were getting increasingly constraint. Finally one flaming radiance shot across Mo Wuji’s waist and as he felt the heat, the blood that was splattered out from his body was burnt into nothingness in an instant.</p><p>Mo Wuji sighed yet again because he had never seen such a powerful magic treasure before. This magic treasure only involved him getting attacked and he won’t even have a chance to talk face to face with Cang Jue, let alone fight back.</p><p>\"Kacha!\" The flaming futon finally enveloped the entire flaming space as Mo Wuji was directly trapped in the centre of the flaming space.</p><p>However, Mo Wuji managed to keep his cool as he knew that it was because he lacked combat experience which resulted in him getting trapped in such a scenario. He was confident that this Cang Jue was nothing compared to Zhu Qu and that Mo Wuji’s strength was at least 10 times stronger than when he faced Zhu Qu previously.</p><p>However, he didn’t even have the chance to exchange blows with Cang Jue and was immediately trapped in this flaming futon. If he was slightly more experienced in such situations, he would have immediately attacked Cang Jue instead of the flaming futon.</p><p>Mo Wuji raised his hand and shot out countless of lightning swords and these lightning swords could only make the futon tremble a little but was still unable to break through it.</p><p>After a few attempts and getting shot at by the flaming radiance two more times, Mo Wuji gave up on the idea in trying to break the space within the flaming futon.</p><p>The Scholar’s Heart instantaneously formed a new shield on the elementary energy shield that was protecting him previously and since it was against flames, he decided to use his own flame to defend himself before thinking of a new idea.</p><p>Cang Jue didn’t even bother about Mo Wuji retrieving his Scholar’s Heart shield as he continuously smacked against the flaming futon to release even more flaming radiances towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>Cang Jue had been battling since a long time ago so he naturally had more experience than Mo Wuji. Even if he didn’t bother about what Mo Wuji was doing, he didn’t underestimate his opponent too because since Mo Wuji could kill Bao Lie, Hoover and eventually becoming the Star Lord of the Star King Mountain, he must be pretty capable.</p><p>Presently, as long as he was able to get rid of Mo Wuji, he would no longer have any obstructions in obliterating the city. He also believed that even without using his flaming futon, he would be able to kill Mo Wuji easily. But however, since he had a reliable way to finish Mo Wuji off, why should he bother fighting head to head with Mo Wuji?</p><p>\"Bang bang bang bang…\" Endless amount of flaming radiance shot against Mo Wuji’s Scholar’s Heart’s shield as the countless amount of flaming radiance formed a massive flaming ray splattering in the middle of the space within the flaming futon. The splattering flaming ray was like a drop of water meeting a sponge as it was completely absorbed by the Scholar’s Heart shield before disappearing without a trace.</p><p>In the next moment that Mo Wuji realised this, he was elated because he didn’t even use much elemental energy and these flaming radiances were being swallowed by the Scholar’s Heart shield.</p><p>Initially, Mo Wuji took out his Scholar’s Heart with the intention to protect himself from the flaming radiance and buy some time as he think of another way to deal with the situation he was currently stuck in. Now that he realised that his Scholar’s Heart would be able to go against the flame within the flaming futon, why would Mo Wuji stand on any ceremony? He immediately drove his Scholar’s Heart to penetrate out of the futon as he started to refine the flaming space that was extended from the flaming futon.</p><p>After tens of breath, Mo Wuji knew that his guess was right. As the Scholar’s Heart continued to absorb the burning hot flaming radiance and the rising temperature from the flaming futon, it’s strength continue to soar and become even greater than before.</p><p>Besides this, following the Scholar’s Heart’s absorption of the heat, the flaming space produced by the flaming futon was shrinking and getting weaker.</p><p>Since Mo Wuji was able to notice that, Cang Jue would naturally be able too. His flaming futon was his greatest trump card and the reason why he used it the moment he saw Mo Wuji was because Mo Wuji had killed Bao Lie, the white-eyed wolf and many other space beasts of the Space King Mountain which resulted in a lot of hatred in his heart for Mo Wuji.</p><p>Cang Jue might look like an ugly joke but he was actually quite a logical fella. The greater the hatred for Mo Wuji, the more he had to be cautious. The cautiousness that he displayed was evident in the execution of his greatest technique to restrain Mo Wuji from the on start before slowly venting his anger and hatred on him.</p><p>However, before he could even restrain Mo Wuji, his triumph card was actually controlled by Mo Wuji. How was it possible?</p><p>Cang Jue wanted to retrieve his flaming futon immediately but he realised that his own flaming futon was being controlled by another type of flame as the essences of his flame was continuously being absorbed by Mo Wuji’s flame. Every second passed and Mo Wuji’s flame was getting stronger while his own flame was getting weaker.</p><p>At this moment, Cang Jue couldn’t be bothered about being cautious anymore as he took a step into the flaming space within the flaming futon. He raised his hand and his Six Clouds Knot was already charging towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>As the white Six Clouds Knot was surrounding Mo Wuji, he felt like he was in an intense battlezone and that his fighting will was about to be restrained by the aura of this battlezone.</p><p>The Nirvana Pole Shadows started to leave the Tian Ji Pole as its elemental energy exploded within the flaming space.</p><p>As the elemental energies clashed with each other, it was like a heavy steel hammer being struck against Mo Wuji’s chest. Mo Wuji could clearly feel the pain of his opponent’s elemental energy tearing his skin.</p><p>As compared to Mo Wuji, Cang Jue was angrier and more shocked. The fact that Mo Wuji’s flame was able to restrain his flaming futon already made him extremely shocked and now Mo Wuji was actually capable of contending against his elemental energy despite only being at the Worldly Immortal Stage? One must know he was a Class 9 beast and even if he was only in the elementary stage of Class 9, it was still extremely rare among all the space beasts.</p><p>Mo Wuji wasn’t fearful because in one exchange of blows, Mo Wuji knew clearly that Cang Jue was really like an ant compared to Zhu Qu.</p><p>Without waiting for Cang Jue to act, Mo Wuji stepped out of the space and shot out several lightning swords at Cang Jue and then a space imprisonment. After introducing the Scholar’s Heart to this battle, the space within the flaming futon was no longer controlled by Cang Jue.</p><p>Ever since he met Cang Jue, Cang Jue was the one who had the initiative to attack and Mo Wuji was all along the passive one but it was finally his turn to take the initiative.</p><p>Cang Jue grunted as his Six Clouds Knot released a bunch of white radiance to go against the blueish lightning radiance from the lightning swords.</p><p>At this instant, Cang Jue felt something was amiss and even though Mo Wuji’s lightning sword was indeed strong, it wouldn’t do any harm to him. Logically speaking, now that Mo Wuji finally had the opportunity to attack, he wouldn’t waste it just like that right?</p><p>Something must be wrong and at the thought of this, more elemental energy surged into his Six Clouds Knot and it was just about to transform.</p><p>Simultaneously, Cang Jue noticed there was a fluctuation in the space surrounding him. The space no longer seemed to be the same space just moments earlier as he couldn’t even sense Mo Wuji’s position now.</p><p>Not good, a deathly aura penetrated into his will at the thought of this.</p><p>Presently, why would Cang Jue even bother continue attacking Mo Wuji? His entire body was getting distorted crazily and all he wanted in this instant was to leave his position.</p><p>\"Puff!\" A steel pole struck against Cang Jue’s neck and the pain of broken bones was spreaded across his body as Cang Jue didn’t even bother about the flaming futon anymore. He simply turned and wanted to run away.</p><p>The combination of the space imprisonment and the Nirvana Pole Shadow had already turned into Mo Wuji’s sure kill technique but he didn’t expect Cang Jue to still be able to dodge the fatal strike.</p><p>In a second, Cang Jue had already escaped over 3 metres away from Mo Wuji.</p><p>If he was fighting anyone else, Cang Jue could have escaped just like that but against Mo Wuji, a distance of 3 metres was really not considered significant as he managed to appear behind him in an instant.</p><p>\"Boom!\" Before Cang Jue could escape yet again, Mo Wuji punched Cang Jue from his back.</p><p>\"Bang!\" Cang Jue was only focused on leaving so how would he have known Mo Wuji would suddenly appear behind him. The next thing he knew was that his huge body was like a rubber ball being thrown and sent flying by Mo Wuji.</p><p>Yan Ze and Su Yu, who had already retreated to the periphery of the Piercing Wind City, knew they simply couldn’t afford to get involved in the fight. Under the intense flames, they wouldn’t even know who had the upper hand in the fight.</p><p>At this moment, they saw Cang Jue flying up and a hole with the size of a fist appeared at the back of Cang Jue’s chest.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
