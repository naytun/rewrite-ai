While he had 108 meridians and had access to peak grade god spiritual energy in the Heavenly Mortal Sect, he knew that it was impossible to break through to the next stage so quickly.</p><p>Rumours spread that there were peak grade treasures after the incubation so Mo Wuji would naturally not want to miss out.</p><p>\"Sect Head, you don’t have to worry about me. Three days later, I will bring the sect’s disciples over to the God Domain punctually.\" Mo Wuji said convincingly.</p><p>\"Since that is the case, I shall make my move first. Do prepare yourself too.\" Shi Su stood up as he was rather satisfied with Mo Wuji thus far.</p><p>Just like how his master described, Mo Wuji’s innate character and capabilities were all extraordinary. The only drawback was his poor aptitude for cultivation. The most likely cause of this problem should be during the spiritual roots transformation.</p><p>…</p><p>Three days later, Mo Wuji brought Ku Cai into the plaza of the sect. At this moment, there was already a massive flying ship stopped in the middle of the plaza. It was about ten times more impressive and glamorous than the flying ship that brought him here.</p><p>There were at least over hundreds of people on the plaza. However, Mo Wuji only recognised a mere tens of people there.</p><p>\"Wuji, why did you bring Ku Cai along?\" Shi Su was also on the plaza and when he spotted Ku Cai, he hurried over to question.</p><p>Mo Wuji whispered, \"Sect Head, Ku Cai had already advanced into the Nascent God Stage. Her dark spiritual roots will not reveal itself even during the spiritual roots test.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji was also very impressed by Ku Cai’s progress. With his 108 meridians, his rate of cultivation was definitely considered rapid. From the Cultivation World to the Immortal World, he really hadn’t seen a few cultivators with a faster rate than his. Back then, Murong Xiangyu’s progress was only faster than his because she had the few pages of the Book of Luo. Otherwise, Mo Wuji was certain than Murong Xiangyu’s cultivation would definitely not surpass him.</p><p>However, Ku Cai’s rate of cultivation was really frightening. In just half a year, Ku Cai was able to conceal her dark elemental energy as well as taking a step into the Nascent God Stage. Presently, Ku Cai was already in the Great Circle of the Nascent God Stage Level 1. On the other hand, Mo Wuji had barely been able to stabilise his cultivation at Nascent God Stage Level 1.</p><p>\"Ah, really?\" Shi Su asked emotionally.</p><p>Following that, Ancestor Pang Jie transmitted a message over. \"Wuji, Ku Cai really managed to conceal her dark spiritual roots while being in the Nascent God Stage? This matter mustn’t be taken lightly because if anything were to happen outside, our Heavenly Mortal Sect would be in trouble.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji walked over and bowed to Pang Jie, who was coincidentally nearby. \"Ancestor, it is indeed true.\"</p><p>Pang Jie nodded before saying to Ku Cai. \"You follow me up to the flying ship for the test.\"</p><p>\"Yes, Ancestor.\" Ku Cai answered promptly.</p><p>After Pang Jie brought Ku Cai away, Shi Su brought Mo Wuji to the crowd of disciples before saying with a clear voice. \"This is the External Affairs Hall Lord Mo Wuji who is currently residing in the Mortal Mountain. He would be the Head Disciple of our Heavenly Mortal Sect during this trip to the God Domain Nest.</p><p>Just like how Mo Wuji didn’t recognise many of them, only some of the disciples in the crowd could recognise Mo Wuji.</p><p>Other than the few disciples who knew Mo Wuji beforehand, the rest of the disciples merely expressed their welcome pretentiously. Evidently, they could tell from Mo Wuji’s faint dao spirituality that he was only able to become the External Affairs Hall Lord because of connections.</p><p>\"Sect Head, why is our sect sending so many disciples over?\" Mo Wuji looked shockingly at the hundreds of disciple standing on the plaza.</p><p>Shi Su revealed a bitter smile. \"49 disciples will be heading over this time around but it will be 50 including Ku Cai. My Heavenly Mortal Sect had just been rebuilt and even though we managed to recruit quite a few decent disciples, the time period was simply too short. I doubt we will be able to gain any advantage in the fight for the God Domain Nest. Ai…\"</p><p>Everyone knew the importance of the God Domain Nest. However, the fight for it was not something a single God King could resolve.</p><p>Mo Wuji looked around and noticed that there were a few disciples in the Nascent God Stage Level 8 and 9. Even so, Mo Wuji was able to empathise with Shi Su’s helplessness. These Nascent God Stage Level 8 and 9 experts had clearly not cultivated much in the Heavenly Mortal Sect. Just like Yin Lin and Di Butong, they were probably already in the Nascent God Stage Level 7 when they joined the sect.</p><p>A strength like this might seem decent on first look but when compared to the talented disciples from the bigger sects, there was really nothing they could do.</p><p>Very soon, Wei Jie announced the orders of Ancestor Pang Jie that all the disciples heading towards the God Domain Nest could board the ship now.</p><p>The team leading the Heavenly Mortal Sect were Pang Jie, Mo Wuji and Elder Wei Jie. Sect Head Shi Su and the remaining elders only came to send them off.</p><p>After Mo Wuji boarded the flying ship, Ku Cai had returned to his side too. Her face was full of smiles as her dark spiritual roots were clearly hidden well in the test Pang Jie did for her.</p><p>Among the 50 disciples including Mo Wuji and Ku Cai, Yin Lin and Di Butong were also in it. This made Mo Wuji’s impression of the Heavenly Mortal Sect much more favorable once more. This proved that the Heavenly Mortal Sect respected their relationship with their disciples. In terms of strength, Yin Lin and Di Butong should never have been chosen to enter the God Domain Nest. He also made it into the group only because he was slightly capable in managing events. In fact, he was even rewarded with the title of ‘Head Disciple’.</p><p>Now, even Ku Cai was allowed to join them for this trip.</p><p>Once the flying ship started moving off, Wei Jie called out for all the disciples heading towards the God Domain Nest. Wei Jie was originally a falsifier but other than Mo Wuji and co. not many of the newer disciples knew what he had done. To the other disciples, they only knew Wei Jie as an elder of the sect; a very old and qualified type of elder.</p><p>This was the reason why the crowd of disciples acted very discipline when Wei Jie was talking.</p><p>Wei Jie nodded his head with a stern look on his face. \"All of you are very fortunate because not every sect would have a God King to accompany their disciples to the God Domain. But all of you have the luck and honour of the very best.\"</p><p>Wei Jie was truly capable of hoaxing people with good words. With a few sentences like this, all the disciples here started feeling proud and thankful.</p><p>Wei Jie nodded satisfyingly, \"From today onwards, Mo Wuji will be your Da Shixiong[1] and you can report everything to Wuji. If Wuji is unable to settle any problems, I will step out to help. Alright, the journey including transfers to the God Domain Nest will take months so please go and rest up.\"</p><p>Having said that, Wei Jie simply waved his hand casually before heading straight back to the ship’s cabin.</p><p>A few friendlier or slightly weaker disciples came forward to greet Mo Wuji. Despite the fact that Da Shixiong, Mo Wuji’s cultivation level was below them, Wei Jie had already mentioned he would be the one leading the group of them. They had only joined the sect for a few months so they naturally wouldn’t go against the instructions of an elder.</p><p>\"Wuji, I know that you’ve joined the sect several months earlier than the few of us. According to the order, you are indeed our senior brother. However, as our Heavenly Mortal Sect aspires to become a peak grade sect, only the strong can lead the way. I hope to ‘consult’ Hall Lord Mo and if I lose, I will definitely regard you as Da Shixiong and listen to you.\" Not everyone would obey Elder Wei Jie’s words and the moment Wei Jie left, a tall built young man stood out.</p><p>Even though Mo Wuji was only in the Nascent God Stage Level 1, he could tell that this fella should be in the Nascent God Stage Level 9.</p><p>Mo Wuji sighed because none of the original disciples of the Heavenly Mortal Sect would make such comments. After the mass recruitment, the close friendship and bond between members of the sect disappeared gradually. In the fight for benefits and authority, everyone lost the most precious and valuable spirit of the sect.</p><p>\"What is your name?\" Mo Wuji asked faintly.</p><p>Mo Wuji was well aware that Elder Wei Jie wasn’t the one who made the decision for him to lead the group of disciples. It was Pang Jie and he knew that he must not give away this title of Da Shixiong so easily. It would not only disappoint Pang Jie but also suffer a huge loss in terms of his own benefits.</p><p>If he were to lead the group and the Heavenly Mortal Sect was only awarded one slot to enter the God Domain Nest, he might have that opportunity to enter. If he gave away this opportunity to lead the group, he would simply be giving the chance to enter the God Domain Nest away. Ever since Mo Wuji cultivated his dao, he knew of the logic to grasp chances when it came.</p><p>\"I am Disciple Pu Yin of the Main Mountain. May Hall Lord Mo show me your way.\" The tall man walked out as he clasped his fists towards Mo Wuji. However, he didn’t draw any magic treasure.</p><p>Because the Heavenly Mortal Sect had just been reopened, all the other disciples resided in the Main Mountain. Mo Wuji was the only disciple who had his own mountain. After a specific period of time, there would be grand competition in the sect. After that, the many disciples would then be split into the various God Mountains taken care of the various Mountain Lords.</p><p>The Heavenly Mortal Sect doesn’t have a lot of Mountain Lords so all these disciples here could become a Mountain Lord like Mo Wuji in the future..</p><p>Because Pu Yin knew that Mo Wuji was also a disciple and while he was already a Mountain Lord, his status wasn’t much higher than the rest. In terms of cultivation level, Mo Wuji’s one was not even comparable to his own.</p><p>Simultaneously, he heard that Mo Wuji was chosen to become a Mountain Lord not because of his aptitude but because he knew how to host a guest reception. In Pu Yin’s eyes, events like guest reception are jobs for the service disciples, the lower class disciples. Previously, the Heavenly Mortal Sect didn’t have any lions so even the monkey dared to address themselves as the overlord. He, Pu Yin, was much better in every aspect when compared to Mo Wuji. This was why he dared to step out to challenge Mo Wuji’s position. With his current ability, Pu Yin was certain that he would also become one of the Mountain Lord in the near future.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s eyes landed on the other disciples before asking calmly. \"Anyone else, like Junior Brother Pu Yin, feels unsatisfied with me being your Da Shixiong?\"</p><p>Hearing that Mo Wuji continued calling him junior brother so unhesitatingly, Pu Yin’s anger started surging from within.</p><p>A red robe woman stood out with her fists clasped, \"Hall Lord Mo, I am Main Mountain’s Disciple Dan Ya. We are all in awe of Hall Lord Mo’s capability in hosting the guest reception for our God King well. However, I still feel that Senior Brother Pu Yin’s words are also true. The God Domain Nest is not a children’s playground and we would be going there to fight. Senior Brother Pu Yin is in the Nascent God Stage Level 9 so I feel more certain with him.\"</p><p>Dan Ya looked very pretty with a nice figure and clear voice. Her cultivation level was also not weak as she was at the Nascent God Stage Level 8.</p><p>Just as Dan Ya finished speaking, yet another disciple stood out. He was a short and fat fella in the Nascent God Stage Level 5. He spoke while smiling, \"I am Main Mountain’s Disciple Jiao Xiangqi. I also believe that Senior Brother Pu Yin’s words are true and just like what Senior Sister Dan Ya mentioned, we are not going there to play…\"</p><p>[1]: Da Shixiong also refers to Big Senior Brother if everyone remembers from very long ago.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
