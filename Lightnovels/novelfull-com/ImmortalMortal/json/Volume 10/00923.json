A huge tearing force came over; the strength of Mo Wuji's God Physique was revealed at this moment.</p><p>Supposedly, the five strings should have directly torn Mo Wuji into pieces. But because Mo Wuji's physique was too strong, only two managed to penetrate through his body. Moreover, their explosive elemental energies were neutralised within Mo Wuji's body. As for the remaining three, they were all blocked by Mo Wuji's bones.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s sea of consciousness suddenly started to tremble. Even though only two strings pierced through his body, the dao laws within these two strings actually tried to seal his sea of consciousness.</p><p>\"Kid, let’s see where else you can go to…\" Wu Liang’s cold laughter suddenly sounded beside Mo Wuji. At the same time, a cold light sailed through the air, cleaving towards Mo Wuji’s forehead.</p><p>Mo Wuji was inwardly very shocked. Not only was this Senior Brother Death very strong, he also had many methods. Even his very own teleportation couldn’t allow him to appear out of the depths of the gorge in such a short time. This was because there was a strong gravitational force within this gorge; it was easy to enter but hard to leave. Moreover, this Senior Brother Death was even able to do it without him noticing it.</p><p>This was probably due to some spatial transfer ability in this fella’s Five Elemental String, allowing Wu Liang to directly be sent out from the depths of the gorge.</p><p>However, such a method was not enough to kill him, Mo Wuji. There was no need to talk about how these two strings didn’t manage to completely seal his sea of consciousness. Even if his sea of consciousness was completely sealed, he still had his spirit storage channel.</p><p>At the same instant that Wu Liang tried to kill him, Mo Wuji made his move. His Half Moon Weighted Halberd conjured a huge, silver river which cascaded down towards Wu Liang.</p><p>Mo Wuji was shocked, but Wu Liang was even more so. Even God Monarchs would face difficulties against his Five Elemental String’s Five Elemental Space. The moment the Five Elemental String was in place, even if it couldn’t tear his opponent’s body apart, it would still trap him within the Five Elemental Space.</p><p>Even though this puny Nascent God didn’t notice his Five Elemental String, only two out of the five managed to pierce through his body. Clearly, his opponent was an extremely strong physique temperer that was at the late stage God Physique at the very least. It was already an incredible feat for a mere Nascent God to reach the late stage God Physique.</p><p>As he thought about Mo Wuji’s strength, Wu Liang suddenly had a weird sense of excitement. He, Wu Liang, believed that he was extremely strong despite being at the Nascent God Stage. Besides his talent, a more important reason for this were the secrets that he, Wu Liang, had.</p><p>His greatest secret was his Five Elemental String.</p><p>He definitely didn’t believe that this incredibly strong Nascent God in front of him didn’t have any secrets. As long as he managed to kill this fella, all those secrets would belong to him.</p><p>Fantasies are beautiful, but reality is often very cruel. Before Wu Liang’s cold light approached Mo Wuji’s forehead, an overbearing sensation of death wrapped around him. He lifted his head to see a cascading, silver river.</p><p>At this point, how could Wu Liang still want to try and kill Mo Wuji? Even though he could end Mo Wuji’s life at the expense of his own, he wouldn’t do such a thing. His figure immediately flashed as he tried to escape. Suddenly, he felt as though the space around him had been sealed. Wu Liang was actually unable to flash away.</p><p>In his anxiety, he directed the cold light, which he shot towards Mo Wuji, towards the silver river. It was also at this instant that Mo Wuji’s Spatial Imprisonment ended.</p><p>\"Kacha!\" The halberd light crashed against the cold light, turning the cold light into nothingness. In that short gap, Wu Liang was finally able to move.</p><p>\"Pff!\" A trail of blood gushed out. The halberd light which could have cleaved Wu Liang in half only managed to decapitate one of Wu Liang’s arms.</p><p>Wu Liang’s figure flashed as he charged into the depths of the gorge.</p><p>He managed to bring away three of the Five Elemental String. The two that pierced through Mo Wuji were locked in place by Mo Wuji’s elemental storage channel and spirit storage channel. Wu Liang wasn’t able to quickly pull them out and he also didn’t dare to tangle himself with Mo Wuji any further.</p><p>Mo Wuji pulled out those two strings and threw them into his Undying World. A greyish white mist oozed out of his injuries. An intense sensation of weakness began to spread throughout his body. His detoxification channel went into action and swept that greyish white mist away.</p><p>What a strong Law of the Five Elements ; Mo Wuji exclaimed inwardly. This Law of the Five Elements was actually able to create a fatal poison. This was the first time he saw such a thing. If he didn’t have his detoxification channel, then he might have really fallen by that.</p><p>To be famous throughout the entire God Domain Nest, this Senior Brother Death truly had some moves.</p><p>Without waiting for his injuries to fully heal, Mo Wuji charged into the depths of the gorge. Even if there weren’t any treasures below, Mo Wuji didn’t intend to let Wu Liang off.</p><p>…</p><p>The gorge couldn’t be considered shallow but it also wasn’t as deep as Mo Wuji imagined. In merely half an incense’s time, Mo Wuji found Wu Liang with his spiritual eye. The bloodied Wu Liang was sitting among a pile of crushed rocks.</p><p>He chuckled, \"Kid, I, Wu Liang, will die here today. But you are going to die with me…\"</p><p>Wu Liang’s words stopped abruptly. He stared at Mo Wuji in shock and he muttered, \"This is not possible. Why aren’t you poisoned?\"</p><p>At this moment, Mo Wuji felt a terrifying venom assailing him; his detoxification channel continuously converted this poison in elemental energy.</p><p>\"So that poison wasn’t manifested due to Wu Liang’s Five Elemental String.\" Mo Wuji immediately came to a realisation when he saw Wu Liang’s face of defeat. The poison wasn’t from the Five Elemental String but this gorge. Both him and Wu Liang didn’t notice it. Thereafter, the Five Elemental String pierced through his body, allowing the poison to invade inside him. He only managed to detect the poison when his detoxification channel went into action.</p><p>Previously, he thought that Wu Liang was the one that poisoned him. Now, he knew that it wasn’t related to Wu Liang. Because at this instant, Wu Liang was also poisoned.</p><p>Mo Wuji no longer cared about Wu Liang. He didn’t need to do anything; this poison was enough to easily kill Wu Liang. His gaze turned towards an eight-sided crystal floating behind Wu Liang. This crystal was the size of a fist and it was floating above the crushed rocks.</p><p>When Mo Wuji’s spiritual will landed on that crystal, the majestic aura of the Heaven and Earth came surging over. At the same time, he felt an immense pressure. This pressure was so strong that it made it hard for him to breath. Mo Wuji hurriedly retracted his spiritual will as he stared at this crystal in shock.</p><p>\"What is this?\" Mo Wuji muttered to himself. Ever since he came to God Domain, he furiously filled himself with knowledge on various kinds of materials and herbs. However, he actually didn’t recognise this eight-sided crystal.</p><p>\"You actually don’t recognise this thing, you’re…\" Wu Liang suddenly started to chuckle. His energy was getting weaker.</p><p>Mo Wuji stared at Wu Liang coldly, \"What’s this thing?\"</p><p>Wu Liang finally stopped his maniacal laughter. He looked at Mo Wuji with a hint of irrepressible envy, \"You are under a disguise, right? If I’m not wrong, you are the one that took away the Medicinal Cauldron Stone when the newly incubated God Domain Nest first opened. That person that took it also disguised himself.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji said faintly, \"Seeing that you are about to die, I will tell you the truth. You’re right, I’m the one that took the Medicinal Cauldron Stone.\"</p><p>When Wu Liang heard Mo Wuji’s confession, his eyes were filled with unwillingness. He, himself, had obtained many opportunities, but he was never like Mo Wuji, to obtain so many great opportunities in a single year. If he could move, he would definitely strangle Mo Wuji and take away all those treasures.</p><p>\"Tell me, did you attack me because of Qu You?\" Wu Liang stared at Mo Wuji. If Mo Wuji really attacked him because of a woman, he, Wu Liang, would really die with regrets.</p><p>\"Thin monkey. A man of your eminence is apt to be forgetful. Not long ago, you even prayed for me to live longer. I didn’t think that you would forget it so quickly. Let me tell you, my name is Mo Wuji…\" Mo Wuji took a step forward and looked down coldly at Wu Liang.</p><p>When Wu Liang heard Mo Wuji’s name, he was instantly stunned still. After some time, he said with a trembling voice, \"It’s you, it’s actually you…\"</p><p>He finally understood why Mo Wuji didn’t get affected when his name, Senior Brother Death, was mentioned. Back then, he thought that Mo Wuji was a fool that didn’t know how impressive the Ten Vicious Cultivators were. That was why he chuckled towards Mo Wuji and prayed for Mo Wuji to live a long life. During that time, he had already decided to kill Mo Wuji. It was just that he didn’t meet Mo Wuji since then.</p><p>Now, he finally understood that it wasn’t because Mo Wuji didn’t know about the Ten Vicious Cultivators. Instead, it was because this fella didn’t even place the Ten Vicious Cultivators in his heart… At the same time, he also knew why Mo Wuji wanted to kill him. He was obsessed with killing the disciples of the Heavenly Mortal Sect. Even on the Battle Stage itself, he killed more than one Heavenly Mortal Sect disciple. It would be weird if Mo Wuji didn’t want to kill him.</p><p>\"Pff!\" He coughed out a mouthful of black blood. Wu Liang cried out harshly, \"I hate you! What virtues and abilities do you have? To actually be able to obtain the Medicinal Cauldron Stone and the Primal God Lattice…\"</p><p>Before he finished speaking, Wu Liang’s head tilted to the side. All signs of life disappeared without a trace.</p><p>It’s actually a Primal God Lattice? Mo Wuji looked at that eight-sided crystal in shock. He knew how valuable the Primal God Lattice was; it was something that exceeded a Five Star God Lattice. It was something of legends; he didn’t think that he would actually see one in real life.</p><p>Seeing the Primal God Lattice of legend was indeed enough to excite Mo Wuji. However, unlike other cultivators, Mo Wuji didn’t anxiously rush over and grab it.</p><p>Other Heavenly Immortals needed to condense their immortal lattice. He, on the other hand, didn’t condense an immortal lattice. However, wasn't he still able to reach the Nascent God Stage? Thus, a god lattice, even the Primal God Lattice, wasn’t enough to excite Mo Wuji greatly.</p><p>On the other hand, his gaze landed on the dead Wu Liang. Wu Liang’s life force had disappeared and his Laws had dispersed. These were clear signs that he was dead.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t leave it like that. He swept Wu Liang’s ring away. At the same time, he threw a ball of fire towards Wu Liang.</p><p>The lifeless Wu Liang suddenly opened his eyes. He cried out harshly, \"Mo Wuji, you’re truly vicious…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji was really got a shock. He actually couldn't tell that this fella was alive. At this moment, his Scholar's Heart began to burn with greater frenzy. Instants later, Wu Liang was completely burned into nothingness.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
