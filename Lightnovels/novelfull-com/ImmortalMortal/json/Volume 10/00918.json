Even though the encampment is very safe, we will need someone to take charge over here. I wonder whether any junior brother or junior sister is willing to volunteer for that role?\"</p><p>The remaining disciples glanced toward each other. More than ten breaths of time passed but no one came forward.</p><p>Mo Wuji sighed inwardly. Just as he was about to speak, two cultivators stepped forward at the same time.</p><p>\"Zhan Chou is willing to take over the affairs of Heavenly Mortal Sect for the time being.\"</p><p>\"Yu Minyi is willing.\"</p><p>Zhan Chou was a medium built, had long hair that reached his shoulders, and his cultivation was at Nascent God Level 8. On the other hand, Yu Minyi was a female cultivator who was also at Nascent God Level 8.</p><p>Clearly, these two people came forward because their cultivations were relatively strong. At the same time, they felt that Mo Wuji was more suitable than Pu Yin to be the head disciple.</p><p>Mo Wuji brought out two jade tokens and handed them to Zhan Chou and Yu Minyi, \"Keep these jade tokens. When Ancestor Pang Jie returns, the two of you can go to newly incubated God Domain Nest to try your luck.\"</p><p>\"This is a jade token to enter the newly incubated God Domain Nest?\" Zhan Chou accepted the jade token agitatedly; his voice was even trembling slightly.</p><p>He had also taken part in the battle for the jade token. If not for his luck, he might have already been killed.</p><p>\"Da Shixiong, this is…\" Yu Minyi was also extremely emotional. She didn’t think that she could obtain this jade token. She didn’t take part in the battle but she did go to the God Domain Nest Sea as well as the place to find insights on Laws. However, her efforts were to no avail.</p><p>Mo Wuji nodded, \"That’s right. These are jade tokens to enter the newly incubated God Domain Nest. However, the two of you must wait for Ancestor Pan to return before you can enter.\"</p><p>\"Yes, we will definitely wait for Ancestor Pang to return.\" Zhan Chou’s words were slightly incoherent.</p><p>The number of placings to enter God Domain Nest might be more than ten thousand. However, you couldn’t simply look at this number. How many Nascent Gods and Heavenly Gods were there in the entire God Domain? Most of these cultivators wouldn’t have this opportunity. And now, this opportunity was in front of all of them.</p><p>\"Senior Brother Wuji, I am also willing…\" Seeing Mo Wuji take out the jade tokens to enter the newly incubated God Domain Nest, several other disciples also came forward.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji waved his hand, \"We will leave it at that. Now, Elder Wei Jie, Ku Cai, Zhu, Yin Lin, Wei Ru, Chang Yizhi and Shi Bian will follow me to the newly incubated God Domain Nest. For the disciples staying in the sect encampment, all of you are to listen to the orders of Zhan Chou and Yu Minyi.\"</p><p>Even Elder Wei Jie didn’t speak at the moment, much less the other disciples. Most of them felt regret in their heart. Besides Elder Wei Jie and Shi Bian, who earned his own jade token, the people that Mo Wuji brought with him were the ones that followed him from the beginning.</p><p>Mo Wuji had a total of 10 jade tokens. Excluding the people that followed him from the beginning, he gave one to Elder Wei Jie and two to Yu Minyi and Zhan Chou. He actually had one more left.</p><p>However, Mo Wuji didn’t intend to give this jade token away. He couldn’t ignore the fact that these people didn’t support him to become the Da Shixiong. Now, they didn’t even dare to step forward to take charge of the encampment when Elder Wei Jie and him wouldn’t be around. Such disciples must be dreaming if they think that he would give a jade token to them.</p><p>…</p><p>Even after they left the sect encampment, Wei Jie still couldn’t believe that he had obtained a jade token to enter the newly incubated God Domain Nest.</p><p>\"Wuji, how did you get so many jade tokens?\" Wei Jie said as he examined his jade token closely.</p><p>Mo Wuji laughed faintly, \"I know a disciple from a big sect. He gave me some jade tokens.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t want to talk too much about the jade tokens. Thus, after that simple answer, he turned to the group and said, \"Various junior brothers and sisters, even though we have exchanged communication beads, the newly incubated God Domain Nest is vast and boundless. After we enter, we should all try to go in the same direction.\"</p><p>\"We know. Thank you, Wuji.\" Wei Jie carefully kept the jade token. As for the mask that Mo Wuji owed him, he had already cast that matter aside.</p><p>How could a mere mask compare to a jade token to enter the newly incubated God Domain Nest?</p><p>In half a day, Mo Wuji, Wei Jie and co. came back to the periphery of the newly incubated God Domain Nest. The area was still the same as before - filled to the brim. The only difference was that an array had been installed over the entrance and there was an array gate in place.</p><p>\"Ancestor is over there.\" Yin Lin noticed Ancestor Pang Jie standing in the distance.</p><p>Ancestor Pang Jie and several other God Kings were clearly here to manage the order for the newly incubated God Domain Nest. Mo Wuji sighed in his heart. Heavenly Mortal Sect didn’t manage to obtain a placing but its God King still had to come here to do menial work. Indeed, one was nothing without strength.</p><p>Even though there were many people here, Pang Jie noticed them when they arrived. He had an apologetic look on his face as he nodded towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji was about to speak when he saw a familiar figure. Yu Zhenna. The moment he saw Yu Zhenna, Mo Wuji’s heart turned cold. He definitely couldn’t forget this woman. Looks like the silhouette he saw previously was really this woman.</p><p>At this instant, Mo Wuji didn’t dare to try and discern her cultivation. Instead, he subconsciously took a few steps back.</p><p>A bale and browless man took a step into mid-air. He spoke loudly, \"The newly incubated God Domain Nest is now opened. Cultivators with the entrance jade token are to enter orderly. Because there are Nascent Gods and Heavenly Gods this time, we hope that everyone would work together and not start disputes.\"</p><p>Under normal circumstances, there would be few disputes in the opening years of a God Domain Nest. It wasn’t because of such words but because the area in a God Domain Nest was extremely huge and everyone was bound to find something good. Thus, there was no need to fight one another.</p><p>\"That’s God King Uncruel.\" Seeing Mo Wuji lower his head, Elder Wei Jie transmitted that message to Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji simply acknowledged but he didn’t speak any further.</p><p>\"That b*stard Pu Yin is really shameless. He’s actually standing together with the people from Phoenix Soul God Estate.\" Yin Lin’s eyes were sharp. While God King Uncruel was speaking, she managed to find Pu Yin.</p><p>\"There’s no need to care about him. Everyone, don’t let your spiritual will and eyes stray around.\" Mo Wuji hurriedly warned in a hushed voice.</p><p>It wasn’t because he was afraid of the rules. Instead, it was that he was afraid of Yu Zhenna. Until now, he still didn’t know of this woman’s origins. However, since she could stand here, and near the front nonetheless, showed that her origins were far from ordinary.</p><p>When God King Uncruel finished speaking, he waved his hand and said, \"Everyone, you can now enter the new God Domain Nest.\"</p><p>The array gate opened and a passage formed out of white light led towards the depths of the newly incubated God Domain Nest.</p><p>Mo Wuji specially stood at the back; he couldn’t stand too close to Yu Zhenna.</p><p>\"Mo Wuji, why are you here?\" An anxious voice could be heard.</p><p>Mo Wuji turned and saw Xi Nianmo beside him. Xi Nianmo stared at Mo Wuji with shock and worry. In her eyes, Mo Wuji was still that intellectually damaged person. Thus, she found it hard to understand how Mo Wuji could get here.</p><p>Seeing the genuine anxiety in Xi Nianmo’s eyes, Mo Wuji knew that Xi Nianmo was truly worried about him. Compared to Liu Ruting, Xi Nianmo was more than a hundred times more compassionate.</p><p>At this instant, seeing how anxious Xi Nianmo was of him, he could only say, \"My condition has improved. This time, I came to see this lively event. Are you going in too?\"</p><p>Hearing that Mo Wuji’s words were much more coherent than before, Xi Nianmo sighed with relief, \"This isn’t a place you should be. I suggest that you return back. I came here with my sect. It’s just that I don’t have a token so I’m only here to watch the show.\"</p><p>\"Ah, token? I have one here.\" Mo Wuji hurriedly passed his final token to Xi Nianmo.</p><p>\"You actually have this sort of token?\" Xi Nianmo received the token and stared at Mo Wuji in astonishment.</p><p>\"You should hurry in. I will be with my friends.\" Mo Wuji nudged Xi Nianmo.</p><p>Xi Nianmo was so excited that her arms were shaking. She carried a huge vengeance and she could only dream of entering this newly incubated God Domain Nest. However, she never had such an opportunity. Even though her talent was acceptable, she had just joined the sect. So how could she get the chance to obtain such a jade token?</p><p>\"Thank you, Big Brother Mo. Take care of yourself. If it’s possible, wait for me at God Domain Nest. When I return, I will bring you to my sect.\" Xi Nianmo anxiously walked into the array gate.</p><p>She didn’t have time to ask Mo Wuji how he got this token. She only felt grateful towards him. Back then, she had only provided Mo Wuji with a little bit of help. But now, she got such a great opportunity in return. This was especially important as she needed to furiously raise her cultivation.</p><p>\"We should go in too.\" Mo Wuji finally said to Wei Jie and co. when he saw Yu Zhenna walk into the array gate.</p><p>\"Wei Jie, why are all of you here?\" When they were not far from the array fate, Wei Jie received a transmission from Ancestor Pang Jie.</p><p>Wei Jie hurriedly transmitted in response, \"These jade tokens are all from Wuji. He’s bringing us in with him. There’re still two jade tokens in the encampment. When Ancestor returns, two more people can come in.\"</p><p>\"Good, good…\" Pang Jie looked on towards Mo Wuji; his heart was filled with delight. Mo Wuji truly didn’t disappoint him. Not only was Mo Wuji able to obtain a placing for himself, he even brought eight other disciples with him.</p><p>Compared to that Pu Yin who went in alone, Mo Wuji’s performance was more befitting of a head disciple.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
