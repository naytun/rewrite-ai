It was just that the names on the wall had changed to the names of Tier 2 god pills. Moreover, the area of the room increased by roughly an entire fold.</p><p>In the same half an incense's time, Mo Wuji easily concocted a batch of Rain Storing God Pill and obtained the validation as a Tier 2 God Pill Refiner. Thereafter, he spent one incense's time on the third level to concoct a batch of Spirit Plundering God Pill and attained the Tier 3 God Pill Refiner validation.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn't even take two hours to reach the fourth level. Moreover, this was his slow pace. If he decided to be faster, he could reach the fourth level within an hour. On the fourth floor, there was no difference with the first floor, except the area of the room and the price of the god herbs.</p><p>On the fourth floor, Mo Wuji chose the Xuan Life God Pill. This was a god pill state could stabilise a person's dao heart. It was not that hard to concoct. The only inconvenience was that it would take a long time to purify the god herbs. However, to Mo Wuji, this was not a problem; he had always been good at refining god herbs.</p><p>Although Mo Wuji intentionally slowed down his pace, he still concocted a batch of only 6 high-grade Xuan Life God Pill within an hour. Others spend more time in order to concoct higher quality pills while he spent time so that his pills would be worse.</p><p>With Mo Wuji's capabilities, he could definitely concoct a full batch of 9 unique grade Xuan Life God Pill in a much shorter time. However, Mo Wuji didn't want to cause too much of a stir; he simply wanted a chance to go to Nirvana Learning Academy. After he goes to Nirvana Learning Academy, he would take a look at the Land of Mortals.</p><p>When he first heard about the Land of Mortals, Mo Wuji had a faint feeling that the Land of Mortals would provide an invaluable help to his Mortal Dao, and this feeling only got more intense as the days passed. It was only until he got a new enlightenment about his Mortal Dao that he discovered that the feeling had weakened significantly.</p><p>Following his decision to restructure his Undying World, the feeling was no longer as fervent as before.</p><p>This caused Mo Wuji to suspect that the importance he placed on the Land of Mortals previously might be due to the wrong direction that his Mortal Dao had been going in. Perhaps going to the Land of Mortals would have allowed him to discover that his Undying World should not use external elemental sources, but his own Laws.</p><p>Although his desire to go the Land of Mortals had weakened significantly, Mo Wuji still decided to make a trip to Nirvana Learning Academy's Land of Mortals. After all, his Immortal Mortal Technique originated from the Nirvana Learning Academy Land of Mortals, so he could be considered part of its legacy. Moreover, Nirvana Learning Academy was relatively safe for him to stay and raise his powers.</p><p>Because of this change in attitude, there was no need for Mo Wuji to be too outstanding. He only needed to get validated as a God Pill King and take part in the assessment. That was more than enough.</p><p>The black token in his hand was now covered with faint gold radiance. Moreover, the words had also changed: Rogue Cultivator 2705, Tier 4 God Pill Master. Mo Wuji was very satisfied as he walked towards the fifth level of the Pill Dao Honour Tower.</p><p>The fifth floor was the same as the fourth floor, just that it was much bigger.</p><p>Just as Mo Wuji was prepared to pick an easy Tier 5 god pill, he stared at the white jade wall flusteredly.</p><p>On the previous levels, there would be the names of various pills on the white jade wall. However, there was only one name on the wall of the fifth level - Five Claws Violet Dragon Pill.</p><p>Mo Wuji carefully examined the surroundings and confirmed that there weren't any other names. There was only the Five Claws Violet Dragon Pill.</p><p>In his helplessness, Mo Wuji could only tap on the Five Claws Violet Dragon Pill.</p><p>After tapping the pill name, there wasn't god crystal price as before. There was only a row of words saying: Inscribe your required god herbs on a jade letter and send it through the transfer array whirlpool.</p><p>Mo Wuji stopped. Others did not know the pill formula for the Five Claws Violet Dragon Pill but he did. Back in the Corner of Yong Ying, he purchased a pill furnace. The Five Claws Violet Dragon Pill Formula was hidden in the furnace. Not only was there the Five Claws Violet Dragon Pill, there was also the formula for the Zhi Nature Pill and the Glassy Blood Exchange Pill.</p><p>He had never used the Glassy Blood Exchange Pill but the Zhi Nature Pill had helped him many times.</p><p>According to the note on the Five Claws Violet Dragon Pill, it was a tierless pill. Now, it actually appeared in the assessment for Tier 5 god pills. Did this mean that the Five Claws Violet Dragon Pill was a Tier 5 god pill?</p><p>However, why would the Pill Dao Honour Tower require the pill refiners to provide the pill formula by themselves? How many people would even have such a pill formula? Mo Wuji did not believe that every pill refiner was like him and could obtain this pill formula by chance.</p><p>When he first obtained the Five Claws Violet Dragon Pill Formula, be only recognised a small number of the herbs on it. Among those that he recognised, they were all Tier 9 immortal herbs. Now that he was a Tier 5 God Pill King and had obtained the legacy of God Pill King Green Robes, his knowledge towards herbs had increased significantly. Even so, the few herbs that he recognised from the pill formula were the same Tier 9 immortal herbs.</p><p>One must know that God Pill King Green Robes's introduction to god herbs included almost all of the god herbs in God Continent which were Tier 6 and below. After obtaining this legacy, he was still only able to recognise those few Tier 9 immortal herbs. The only possibility was that those herbs he did not recognise were all above the Tier 6 god herb level.</p><p>Since that's the case, then the Five Claws Violet Dragon Pill definitely wasn't a Tier 5 god pill.</p><p>If it wasn't a Tier 5 god pill, then why was it placed here to assess Tier 5 God Pill Kings? The only explanation was that the Pill Dao Honour Tower also didn't know the pill formula for the Five Claws Violet Dragon Pill and they were searching for it.</p><p>Mo Wuji shook his head, took a final look at the surroundings, then left resolutely. Even if he handed over the pill formula and the other party was able to offer the god herbs, he wouldn't be able to concoct it.</p><p>…</p><p>The top floor of the Pill Dao Honour Tower.</p><p>Seeing Mo Wuji turn and leave, a few pill refiners turned and glanced towards one another.</p><p>A red-faced man dressed in a Yin Yang symbol robes said in displeasure, \"Looks like this Rogue Cultivator 2705 also doesn't know the pill formula of the Five Claws Violet Dragon Pill.\"</p><p>\"Eh, it seems like our judgement is wrong. This kid isn't the descendant of the Eternal River Pill Dao.\" Another person sighed.</p><p>Sitting at the very top was an old man with a flat nose. He frowned but he didn't say a word.</p><p>\"Brother Jian, could it be that you have a different opinion?\" Seeing this flat nosed elder frown, that red-faced man asked doubtfully.</p><p>When this red-faced man spoke previously, his words were filled with displeasure. But when he was speaking to this flat nosed elder, his words were filled with respect. This flat nosed elder was called Jian Sha. He was the most powerful pill refiner in Nirvana Learning Academy. He also had another alias - God Pill King Flat Nose.</p><p>Jian Sha said solemnly, \"How long did this person take to go from the first level to the fourth level and obtain the title of a Tier 4 God Pill Master? Not even four hours. This even included the time to choose the pills and to receive the god herbs.</p><p>The few of your should have delved in the Pill Dao for at least a few hundreds of thousands of years, right. Have you heard of a pill refiner that could concoct four batches of pills in less than half a day? One of the batches was even the Tier 4 Xuan Life God Pill? There's no need to talk about anyone else. Even I would need half a day just to concoct a batch of the Xuan Life God Pill. My pill concoction pace should be considered fast, right? But this Rogue Cultivator 2705 is multiple times faster than me.\"</p><p>A white-faced, clean-shaven old man sighed, \"If there's truly such a fast pill refiner, then he has to be the descendant of the Eternal River Pill Dao.\"</p><p>Jian Sha nodded and said in a low voice, \"Dao Friend Zhai's words are right. With this person's concoction speed, as well as his herb refinement purity, there's at least an 80% chance that he's the heir of the Eternal River Pill Dao. The Five Claws Violet Dragon Pill was created by the Eternal River. As the descendant of the Eternal River Pill Dao, how could he not know the pill formula of the Five Claws Violet Dragon Pill?\"</p><p>\"Could it be that the Five Claws Violet Dragon isn't a Tier 5 god herb…\" The clean-shaven old man was slightly nervous.</p><p>This time, before Jian Sha could speak, that red-faced man said, \"The Five Claws Violet Dragon Pill is definitely a Tier 5 god pill. According to the incomplete pill formula that we obtained, the herbs needed for the Five Claws Violet Pill were all Tier 5 ones, and they are all extremely rare and valuable ones. Clearly, it's a Tier 5 god pill.\"</p><p>Jian Sha said, \"That's right. It's indubitable that the Five Claws Violet Dragon Pill is a Tier 5 god pill. It's simple to ascertain whether that Rogue Cultivator 2705 has the pill formula of the Five Claws Violet Dragon Pill. We only need to check whether he's the descendant of the Eternal River Pill Dao…\"</p><p>\"Brother Jian, the Eternal River Pill Dao isn't the only Pill Dao which has fast concoction speeds. There's also the Agriculture Emperor of Nirvana Learning Academy's Land of Mortals…\" This time, the one speaking was a man with only one arm. From his appearance, he looked very young. It was unknown why his arm wasn't recovered.</p><p>Don't underestimate this person because he didn't have an arm; he was a reputable God Pill King in Nirvana Learning Academy. He also had a nickname, called God Pill King One-Arm. It was an honour for anyone to obtain his or the God Pill King Flat Nose's pills.</p><p>Jian Sha nodded, \"That's right. But after the Agriculture Emperor died those years ago, all his techniques that were passed down, if there were any, were all low levelled ones. As for his legacy, it should have been severed a long time ago. More importantly, while the Agriculture Emperor was fast, his pill quality has always been average. This was because his refinement could not make it. With this Rogue Cultivator 2705's refinement standard, he definitely isn't the descendant of the Agriculture Emperor.</p><p>Caihe, I will leave the investigation of that Rogue Cultivator 2705 to you. If he's really the descendant of the Eternal River Pill Dao, then be sure not to alarm him. It's enough to relay the news back. There's no need to rush the matter. This Rogue Cultivator 2705 should have come to Nirvana Dao City to take part in the Nirvana Learning Academy's assessment. He shouldn't be leaving for the time being. Now, he's only a Tier 4 God Pill Master. If he wants to obtain the rights to take part in the assessment, he would need to go to the Rogue Cultivator Alliance. You can use the Rogue Cultivator Alliance to pressure him.\"</p><p>\"Alright,\" The one-armed youth responded. His name was Shi Caihe.</p><p>The red-faced man chuckled, \"If this kid is really the descendant of the Agriculture Emperor and didn't obtain the King Title because of our misunderstanding, I guess he would probably turn in his sleep.\"</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
