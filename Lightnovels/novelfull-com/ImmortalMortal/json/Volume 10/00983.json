Of course, I also need 500,000 high-grade god crystals,\" Mo Wuji said calmly.</p><p>If this World Bearing Pill was sold at an auction, its price would definitely be astronomical. But now, Mo Wuji was only asking for 500,000 god crystals and his room. Jin Yongwu didn't even hesitate as he directly said, \"Alright, I will move out now and hand over the room to you.\"</p><p>The main reason why Jin Yongwu came to Nirvana Dao City in the first place was to find means to advance to the World God Stage. Now that a unique grade World Bearing Pill was placed in front of him, he would be an idiot to reject it. There was no need to talk about the 500,000 god crystals; even if Mo Wuji asked for a slightly higher amount, he would not have hesitated to accept it.</p><p>\"Since that's the case, I will have to thank Dao Friend Jin.\" Mo Wuji clasped his fists and said.</p><p>He possessed the World Channel, so basically all the World Bearing Pills that he concocted were unique grade. Moreover, he only dared to do this because Chi Bing was with him. If not for Chi Bing, Mo Wuji definitely wouldn't dare to take out his World Bearing Pill so openly.</p><p>Under the dazed stare of the attendant, Mo Wuji and co. moved onto Room 73A. Chi Bing was slightly speechless; only a person like Mo Wuji would use the World Bearing Pill to trade for a place to stay. Moreover, she was the one who gave him the Moonlight Fruit for the World Bearing Pill.</p><p>God Joy Resthouse could be considered a top-rate rest house in Nirvana Dao City, and A-type rooms were the more luxurious rooms. Room 73A had a total of four rooms. Mo Wuji, Chi Bing and Chi Chuan each took one while Da Huang and Shuai Guo shared the last one.</p><p>Chi Bing had not been in the God King Stage for a long time. Thus, the moment she entered her room, she immediately started to stabilize her cultivation. On the other hand, because of the influence of Da Huang, Chi Chuan also became more diligent and grabbed this opportunity to cultivate.</p><p>Only Shuai Guo didn't do anything; it wanted to follow Mo Wuji and stroll around the city. However, after Mo Wuji installed the seals around the room, he didn't even bring Shuai Guo with him. In its helplessness, Shuai Guo could only cultivate together with Da Huang.</p><p>Mo Wuji naturally wasn't going to bring Shuai Guo with him. After all, he was going to Nirvana Dao City's plaza to obtain the King Title for his Pill Dao.</p><p>Nirvana Dao City was very safe and Chi Bing knew that Mo Wuji was undoubtedly a Tier 5 God Pill King, so she didn't need to follow Mo Wuji to Nirvana Dao Plaza.</p><p>As he passed by the plaza on the left, Mo Wuji specially took a slight pause. At least the cultivator outside the city wasn't lying. The Nascent Gods on the battle stages were all very powerful. There were a total of 30 stages and Mo Wuji saw that one of the cultivators on the stage was definitely not weaker than Wu Liang, one of the Ten Vicious Cultivators.</p><p>However, after he reached Nascent God Level 6, Wu Liang couldn't even hold a candle to him. Just as Mo Wuji was leaving, he saw a Nascent God Level 7 cultivator being cleaved in half by a Great Circle Nascent God; only his primordial spirit remained.</p><p>That terrified primordial spirit desperately tried to reconnect with his body. However, he was helpless against the strong residual dao energy from his opponent's attack. No matter what he did, this primordial spirit couldn't re-enter his body.</p><p>The judge at the side of the stage couldn't care much about this. He simply threw a fire towards the decapitated body, burning it to ashes. At the same time, he harrumphed harshly, \"Primordial spirits aren't allowed to stay in Nirvana Dao City. You have two hours to leave the city.\"</p><p>That miserable primordial spirit didn't even dare to stay as he hurriedly left the area.</p><p>The crowd was very calm as they saw this. Clearly, such things were extremely common.</p><p>Mo Wuji sighed emotionally about the difficulty in pursuing the Dao. After this competition, exactly how many Nascent Gods would have died? Moreover, those that dared to fight on the stages were generally those that had their methods. After this competition ends, a significant number of capable Nascent Gods would be lost.</p><p>Indeed, just as Mo Wuji was thinking of this, a cultivator was sent flying off the stage. As this cultivator was in mid-air, he suddenly exploded. His body, as well as his primordial spirit, were vaporized into ashes. Nothing was left of him.</p><p>Mo Wuji shook his head. He no longer wanted to watch any further as he walked past the Battle Plaza and towards the Dao Honour Towers.</p><p>Only victory and defeat mattered in this sort of battle; there were no other restrictions. Death wasn't a strange sight.</p><p>As he entered the plaza on the right, it felt much more spacious. Seven towering glass towers were built in the arrangement of the Big Dipper, resulting in a spoon-like layout. However, the architecture of each glass tower was different. For instance, the Pill Dao Tower was shaped like a huge cauldron.</p><p>Words floated at the front of each glass tower. In front of the Pill Dao Tower were the words - Pill Dao Honour Tower. Besides the Pill Dao Honour Tower, there were also the Equipment Dao, the Array Dao, the Talisman Dao, the Evil Dao, the Witch Dao and the Sacred Art Dao.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn't expect that the Witch Dao actually had a tower here.</p><p>Mo Wuji saw plenty of cultivators walking into various Dao Honour Towers, but he also saw many being transported out.</p><p>Today, he had come to validate his Pill Dao. Even though his Array Dao was already in Grade 4, his Pill Dao was his most impressive Dao at the moment.</p><p>\"You're a rogue cultivator?\" Just as Mo Wuji walked to the Pill Dao Honour Tower, a yellow-robed cultivator approached him.</p><p>Mo Wuji stared at this yellow-robed cultivator quizzically, thinking whether there was a need to register just to enter the Dao Honour Tower.</p><p>\"That's right, I'm a rouge cultivator.\" Mo Wuji nodded.</p><p>\"What tier of a pill refiner are you?\" This yellow-robed cultivator continued asking.</p><p>Mo Wuji said indifferently, \"My tier is my own business. What has it got to do with you?\"</p><p>The yellow-robed cultivator casually brought out a jade token, flashed it and continued, \"I'm the in-charge of the Rogue Cultivator Alliance's Pill Dao Assessment. Thus, all rogue cultivators that come to assess their Pill Dao need to go through me. Otherwise, even if you are a Tier 4 God Pill Refiner, you wouldn't have the rights to participate in the Alliance's internal selection.\"</p><p>\"What do I need to do?\" Mo Wuji asked calmly.</p><p>\"If you are a Tier 3 God Pill Refiner, you need to pay a fee of 20,000 high-grade god crystals and two vases of Tier 3 god pills. If you are a Tier 4 God Pill Pill Refiner, you need to pay a fee of 50,000 high-grade god crystals and one vase of Tier 4 god pills,\" This yellow-robed cultivator said to Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji laughed indifferently, \"I apologize. I don't have any god crystals, nor do I have that many god pills.\"</p><p>This yellow-robed cultivator wasn't angered. Instead, he brought out a leather scroll and said, \"This time, we will only pick eight pill refiners. Take a look at how many Tier 4 God Pill Refiners have registered. Let me tell you, the names on this scroll are Tier 4 God Pill Refiners who have already obtained the validation from the Dao Honour Tower. I haven't even brought out the records for the Tier 3 ones; there are much more of them.\"</p><p>\"How can there be so many Tier 4 God Pill Refiners?\" Mo Wuji muttered in shock.</p><p>Mo Wuji knew exactly how difficult it was for a rogue cultivator to be a Tier 4 God Pill Refiner. Moreover, not everyone cultivated the Immortal Mortal Technique like him. If not for his Immortal Mortal Technique, and his Gold Nirvana Dao Sand, he couldn't have advanced to the Tier 5 level.</p><p>\"Of course there aren't many of them that are rogue cultivators.\" The yellow-robed cultivator kept the scroll, \"if you don't wish to hand over the god crystals, then forget about it. However, if we cannot verify that you're actually a rogue cultivator, then you cannot take part in the internal selections for the Rogue Cultivator Alliance.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji came to a realisation. No wonder why there were so many Tier 4 God Pill Refiners. Most of them were probably from big sects. For those extra one or two placings, these sects had their pill refiners pose as rogue cultivators. The number of rogue Tier 4 God Pill Refiners probably didn't even number more than one or two. In other words, the eight placings for rogue pill refiners were basically going to the hands of the big sects.</p><p>Fortunately, he was already a Tier 5 God Pill King, otherwise, he would really have to pay the god crystals. Moreover, Mo Wuji was sure that the amount stated was only the registration fee. If he was validated as a Tier 4 God Pill Refiner, then the number of god crystals that he would have to pay afterwards would definitely be astronomical.</p><p>\"After I obtain the validation as a Tier 4 God Pill Refiner, do I still need to pay more god crystals to take part in the selection?\" Mo Wuji's voice was lined with a hint of disdain.</p><p>\"That's right.\" This yellow-robed man stared calmly at Mo Wuji. He knew that Mo Wuji would definitely be paying him the god crystals. An opportunity to enter Nirvana Learning Academy was truly too rare. Even if it was a 1% chance, a Tier 4 God Pill Refiner would pay for it. There were even plenty of Tier 3 God Pill Refiners that came to try to luck.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, I don't have a single god crystal.\" With that, Mo Wuji no longer cared about this yellow-robed cultivator as he walked into the Pill Dao Honour Tower.</p><p>This yellow-robed cultivator stared blankly at where Mo Wuji just stood. He almost couldn't believe his eyes. This was the first time he saw a fella that didn't want to rely on the Rogue Cultivator Alliance just because of god crystals. Did this fella really think he was a Tier 5 God Pill King? Moreover, to a pill refiner, a few tens of thousands of god crystals wasn't a huge amount.</p><p>After entering the Pill Dao Honour Tower, Mo Wuji saw a pill room which was roughly 10 square foot in area. Besides a white jade wall, there was nothing else in the room.</p><p>The white jade wall was listed with various names of Tier 1 god pills. Behind the names, there was a time limit. There was also some lines of instructions: After concocting the pill, you would need to use the jade vase provided here and inscribe your name on the jade vase.</p><p>Mo Wuji looked around. After verifying that there weren't any pill furnaces, god herbs or fires, he casually pressed Nascent True God Pill. The time limit was 2 hours.</p><p>Soon, a transfer array whirlpool appeared. A few words were written clearly above it: 29 high-grade god crystals. Mo Wuji placed 29 god crystals in the transfer array whirlpool, and soon, several herbs and a jade vase appeared.</p><p>Previously, Mo Wuji had taken part in the Immortal World's Pill Dao Tower's assessment. This method was different from the one back in the Immortal World, but it was similar to the Pill Tower back in Heaven Seeking Palace. The Pill Dao Tower in the Immortal World provided the pill formulas but only the names were provided here.</p><p>Mo Wuji brought out his pill furnace and his fire. The Nascent True God Pill was the lowest grade among Tier 1 god pills, thus he didn't even need half an incense's time to finish the concoction.</p><p>After sending the Nascent True God Pills into the jade vase, he inscribed the name 'Rogue Cultivator 2705' on it. Thereafter, he placed the jade vase in the transfer array whirlpool.</p><p>Mo Wuji was still worried that the High Firmament God Sect was still searching for him. Thus, before he entered Nirvana Learning Academy, he didn't want to reveal his name. Moreover, the name didn't matter in this sort of assessment. Thus, he casually used the name of Rogue Cultivator 2705.</p><p>In less than an incense's time, a black token landed in front of him. The token wrote: Rogue Cultivator 2705, Tier 1 God Pill Refiner.</p><p>Following which, a flight of stairs suddenly appeared in front of him. Mo Wuji guessed that the next level was to assess Tier 2 God Pill Refiners. From the looks of it, each pill refiner would be transported into their own individual spaces once they entered the Pill Dao Honour Tower.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
