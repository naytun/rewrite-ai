Instead, they silently waited for Kun Yun to explain about the God Thrones.</p><p>Indeed, after Kun Yun expressed that sentence of discontent, his face turned serious as he said, \"There aren't many God Thrones. The fight for each God Throne is an annal filled with bloodshed and massacre. Besides some God Thrones which have sealed themselves, the true God Thrones include 8 Sages, 4 Dao Monarchs, 3 Rogues, 12 God Emperors, 108 Principal Gods and 108 Valued Gods. Within the 108 Principal Gods, there are 36 Ministers and 72 Lords. Besides all these, there're also 10,368 Minor Gods.\"</p><p>As Blazing Heaven and co. heard this, they were all dumbfounded. Mo Wuji, on the other hand, said, \"Old Brother Kun Yun, according to what you've said, there's actually quite a number of God Thrones.\"</p><p>Kun Yun sneered, \"Quite a number of God Thrones? Do you know how many God Worlds there are in the boundless universe? Do you know how many experts there are in every God World that would fight just for a Minor God Throne?</p><p>Just a little over 10,000 God Thrones and you feel that it is quite a number?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji remained firm, \"Old Brother Kun Yun, you said that you are a Throned God. What's your God Throne?\"</p><p>Kun Yun said proudly, \"I'm one of the 36 Ministers of the Principal Gods. It's just that I almost had my soul destroyed during the Cataclysm. But as long as I'm still alive, my God Throne will not be taken away.\"</p><p>When Blazing Heaven and co. heard that Kun Yun was one of the 36 Ministers of the 108 Principal Gods, they all hurried to stand up and bow once more.</p><p>Mo Wuji's heart was inwardly shocked. He knew exactly how powerful Kun Yun was. Such an expert was only one of the 108 Principal Gods? According to what he thought, even if Kun Yun wasn't one of the 4 Dao Monarchs and 4 Rogues, he should at least be a God Emperor, right?</p><p>From the looks of it, even though they aren's Sages, the 12 God Emperors, 4 Dao Monarchs and 3 Rogues were definitely supreme experts.</p><p>\"How is it? You're scared, right? Old Brother Wuji, follow me properly. After I take back what is mine, I will definitely help you obtain a Minor God Throne,\" Kun Yun said complacently.</p><p>Mo Wuji shook his head and sighed, \"Old Brother Kun Yun ah. I thought that even if you didn't manage to get yourself a Sage Throne, you should be able to barely make it to a God Emperor Throne. I didn't think that you are merely one of the 36 Ministers. Moreover, you were beaten to the point where you are begging to live in a lower world.\"</p><p>\"You…\" Kun Yun almost coughed out blood at Mo Wuji's words. What do you mean 'merely one of the 36 Ministers'? Those years ago, which person didn't hurry to kowtow when they heard his name?</p><p>Mo Wuji waved his hand, \"Don't be agitated. I'm just encouraging you to improve yourself.\"</p><p>Kun Yun laughed bitterly, \"Improve myself? Your words sound even better than a song. But do you know what that entails? There's no need to talk about the 12 God Emperors. Even the top of the 36 Ministers is a Great Quasi-Sage that's close to the Sages. I only managed to obtain one of the 36 Thrones because of my luck.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji stood up, \"Old Brother Kun Yun, tell me. How can I help you? This time, I will definitely help you. Of course, I also want to go out and take a look whether I can get one God Throne to sit on.\"</p><p>Kun Yun waved his hand, \"Old Brother Wuji, with these words of yours, my confidence has been bolstered. It's true that my physical body had collapsed during the Cataclysm. However, others did not do much better than me. Many didn't even retain their primordial spirits. This is the opportunity that you are looking for.\"</p><p>As he said this, Kun Yun saw the envy and desire in Blazing Heaven and co.'s eyes. He chuckled and said, \"Your paths of Dao are too ordinary. However, as long as I am able to sit stably in my 36 Ministers Throne and Brother Wuji gets a God Throne, it isn't impossible for the rest of you to rank among us. Of course, after Old Brother Wuji and I leave, his Mortal Sect's business needs to be left to the rest of you. Mortal Sect would affect the stability of Old Brother Wuji's future God Throne. Thus, it would also affect your future.\"</p><p>This time, Wen Mingyang and Scoured Sea seemed to stand at the same time, \"Senior, rest assured. Sect Head Mo can also rest assured. After the two of you leave, Mortal Sect will be the most important sect of our God World.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji clasped his fists towards Blazing Heaven and co., \"My wife is lost in the God World. Before I leave with Old Brother Kunyun, I need to find my wife Shuyin. I hope that you Dao Friends would be able to extend your help.\"</p><p>Kun Yun felt slightly helpless. He knew that it was impossible to advice Mo Wuji against finding Cen Shuyin.</p><p>\"Sect Head Mo, your wife is?\" Blazing Heaven hurriedly asked.</p><p>Although they all believed that Mo Wuji's dao companion was Qu You, Mo Wuji had clearly stated that his wife's name was Shuyin. Facing such short of matters, it wasn't proper for them to ask him openly.</p><p>Mo Wuji lifted his hand and drew an image, \"This is my wife, Cen Shuyin. She should have arrived at God World. It's just that there's no longer any news of her besides her arriving at the periphery of God Burial Valley.\"</p><p>\"Sect Head Mo can rest assured. With me here, I will definitely return to you with news as soon as possible.\" Blazing Heaven said in a straightforward manner.</p><p>As he spoke, he had already shot out multiple flying swords.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not suspect Blazing Heaven's words. After all, Blazing Heaven used to be the number one person in the God Domain. Although he might not be able to rally large masses, he should still have a high position in God Domain.</p><p>According to Mo Wuji's thoughts, he intended to spend half a year to find Cen Shuyin.</p><p>What he didn't expect was that after merely half a day, a flying messenger sword charged into Mortal Sect and landed in Blazing Heaven's hands.</p><p>After looking at the contents of the sword, Blazing Heaven's face changed.</p><p>Mo Wuji could no longer care about courtesy. His spiritual will directly penetrated into Blazing Heaven's flying messenger sword.</p><p>The contents of the sword were very clear. Years ago, someone saw a person, that looked like the woman that Mo Wuji drew, entering God Burial Valley alone.</p><p>Mo Wuji immediately felt his brain buzzing. Cen Shuyin walked into God Burial Valley? Why? Could she also have been forced inside?</p><p>It was just that Mo Wuji didn't have the time to investigate why Shuyin entered God Burial Valley. He needed to pay a visit to God Burial Valley as soon as possible.</p><p>Looking at Mo Wuji's expression, Kun Yun knew that things weren't good. Indeed, after sending his spiritual will into the flying messenger sword, he understood Mo Wuji's feelings.</p><p>Indeed, Mo Wuji clasped his fists towards Kun Yun and said, \"Old Brother Kun Yun, I'm truly sorry. I will temporarily be unable to follow you. I intend to go to God Burial Valley.\"</p><p>After saying that, Mo Wuji drew the sketches of Immortal Empress Wen Lan and Lin Gu and passed them to Blazing Heaven, requesting for his help with the two of them as well.</p><p>Kun Yun's expression was ugly but he did not flare up. Instead, he said solemnly, \"Old Brother Wuji, how is the lack of a dao companion a worry? God Thrones are the things that are truly important. Now that the God World is restored, if we don't rush to do that thing, we might not even have leftovers.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji shook his head. He wasn't in the mood to refute Kun Yun's words. He needed to go to God Burial Valley. It's true that God Burial Valley had become a flat plain. However, Mo Wuji did not completely lose hope. That's because there was still a rock cave in God Burial Valley.</p><p>According to Tian Nu's words, that stone cave was likely to be the safe zone of God Burial Valley. Originally, he wanted to search for Cen Shuyin and establish his Mortal Sect, which was why he didn't have the time to enter the stone cave. But now that he heard that Cen Shuyin had entered the God Burial Valley, he definitely needed to visit that stone cave.</p><p>Kun Yun could only say, \"Actually, the place that I want to go is also the God Burial Valley. That place is slightly special. How about this, I will follow you to search God Burial Valley. But if we are unable to find her, then you will follow me to complete my task. How about that?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji did not hesitate to shake his head, \"I intend to go to a rock cave in God Burial Valley. I don't even know if I'm able to come out alive after I enter, so…\"</p><p>\"You actually know of God Burial Valley's God Burial Cave?\" Kun Yun asked in shock, \"That's also the place that I want to go. How did you know of it? That place definitely wouldn't reveal itself…\"</p><p>Towards the end of his sentence, Kun Yun started to frown. Originally, the place he needed help to get to was God Burial Cave. However, he was sure that God Burial Cave wouldn't reveal itself. Since it couldn't be seen, how did Mo Wuji know about it?</p><p>At this point, a golden light suddenly descended and hung above Nirvana Ocean.</p><p>Although everyone was within Mortal Sect's main mountain, they could still see the golden light in the distance. The golden light soon transformed into a golden staircase. Following which, a deep voice came from that staircase, \"Announcing Sage Luo Xu's decree. Congratulations to this God World for restoring the Laws. Now, the Sage will perfect this God World and share the Dao.</p><p>All sects are to join hands to erect a tower. This tower must be 99,999 meters tall and it must be built using the materials obtained from the Chasm of Laws. After the tower is completed, plant 49 peak-grade god spiritual veins and name is Gods Tower. After completing Gods Tower, Sage Luo Xu will reward multiple God Thrones. They would go to those that contributed the most to the Gods Tower…\"</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
