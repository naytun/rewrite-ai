After all, he didn't know much about this.</p><p>Just as Mo Wuji said these words, he felt a sensation instantly brush across his entire body.</p><p>What a powerful spiritual will. Mo Wuji's heart shuddered, and at the same time, he prepared himself for battle.</p><p>Ku Xinren clearly scanned Mo Wuji. However, he did not sense any aura from an Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo. He sighed and said, \"If you can help me obtain an Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo, I would lend you the Time Plate for 10,000 years.\"</p><p>He believed that if Mo Wuji had the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo, he would be able to detect its aura. As for his words that he would lend the Time Plate to Mo Wuji if Mo Wuji helped him obtain the Bamboo, he knew that they were complete nonsense.</p><p>Was it so easy to leave once in the Resting Land of Gods? If a person could leave the Resting Land of Gods, then he, Ku Xinren, wouldn't have stayed in this wretched place for so many years.</p><p>Ko Wuji said indifferently, \"I heard from Kun Yun that your alias is Dao Monarch Darkness. If my guess is not wrong, you should be one of the four Dao Monarchs under the eight Sages, right?\"</p><p>Ku Xinren said in disdain, \"Since when have the four Dao Monarchs been under the eight Sages? I, Ku Xinren, am Dao Monarch Darkness. Everybody knows that, there's no need for you to remind me.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji chuckled, \"You are a Dao Monarch. However, you are now struggling under a fake Sage. Life should definitely be heart-wrenching for you. If I were you, I would willingly give the Time Plate to the person who could bring you the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo which could allow you to return to the peak of your power. Otherwise, do you think that anyone would trade the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo just for 10,000 years of your Time Plate? Only an idiot would do that.\"</p><p>Even though he said such words, Mo Wuji had already prepared himself to be an idiot. The Time Plate was something that he needed.</p><p>Against expectations, Ku Xinren didn't get angry. Instead, he went silent. After some time, he finally said, \"Even if you know of the whereabouts of an Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo, you would have no means of leaving the Resting Land of Gods, much less God Burial Cave.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji waved his hands, \"That's my business. You only need to say whether you are willing to trade with me. As long as you are willing to trade with me, then you only need to leave everything up to me.\"</p><p>After contemplating for some time, Ku Xinren finally said, \"The difference between the value of an Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo and the Time Plate is astronomical. If it were you, would you be willing to do the trade?\"</p><p>\"Wrong.\" Mo Wuji did not hesitate to say. \"Senior's words are erroneous. I wonder whether Senior had started cultivation as a mortal?\"</p><p>Ku Xinren swept his eyes across Mo Wuji and said calmly, \"There's no need for you to remind me, I know that you cultivate the Mortal Dao. Otherwise, you wouldn't have the aura of a mortal. Your words are right, I started cultivation as a mortal.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji continued, \"Let's say that you were still a mortal. You are carrying a huge piece of gold as you travel through the desert. You are going to die of thirst soon. Now, an option is placed in front of you. You need to exchange your huge piece of gold for a bottle of water. Would you be willing to do it?\"</p><p>Ku Xinren went silent again. How could he not understand the meaning of Mo Wuji's words?</p><p>Carrying a piece of gold in the desert was already a burden. If he was going to die of thirst and this burden could be transformed into a bottle of water, any sane person would agree to it, right?</p><p>This was the same for him. He had the Time Plate, but wasn't it also a burden? Countless people coveted his Time Plate, forcing him to hide here in this wretched place. The value of the Time Plate is countless times higher than the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo. But to him, the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo was that bottle of water while the Time Plate was the burdensome piece of gold.</p><p>\"Your way with words is amazing. However, one Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo is still unable to trade for my Time Plate. Even if I had to die of thirst, I wouldn't wish to fall prey to such a disadvantageous trade,\" Ku Xinren said indifferently.</p><p>\"What else do you want?\" Mo Wuji asked calmly. In his heart, however, he was bursting with excitement. As long as the other party was willing to quote a price, then things would become simpler.</p><p>\"Ten peak-grade god spiritual veins. Remember, peak-grade.\" Ku Xinren extended his palm. \"Besides that, give me your best treasure to nourish the fleshly body. It must at least be in the Xiantian level…\"</p><p>When he heard Ku Xinren's words, Mo Wuji was slightly startled.</p><p>Noticing this, Ku Xinren said calmly, \"Why? Is the price too high?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji inhaled a deep breath. He did not hesitate to say, \"Deal.\"</p><p>He did not think that the price was too high. In fact, he thought that it was too low. He had 700 to 800 peak-grade god spiritual veins on him. Even if Ku Xinren asked for 100, he wouldn't have minded. He didn't think that Ku Xinren would only ask for ten. As for the Xiantian treasure which can nourish the fleshly body, he had the Breath of Hongmeng. That thing was not inferior to a Xiantian treasure, right? At the most, he would give Ku Xinren a bottle of the Breath of Hongmeng.</p><p>However, Mo Wuji did not know how impressive a single peak-grade god spiritual vein was. The reason why he had so many was because of the Chasm which restored the God World's Laws. If not for the Chasm, every single peak-grade god spiritual vein would be a supreme treasure that countless experts would fight for.</p><p>Even when Kun Yun gave him the 500 peak-grade god spiritual veins, it wasn't because he thought that these god spiritual veins would end up with Mo Wuji. In his mind, if Mo Wuji was able to help him open his Dao World, then it would have been worth it. If Mo Wuji couldn't do that, then Mo Wuji's body would perish into the Dao. When that happens, those spiritual veins would return to him, Kun Yun.</p><p>Ku Xinren did not know about this. If he did, he would definitely have asked for 1000 veins.</p><p>\"Alright. You can go and find these things now. After you find them, you can return and do the trade.\" Ku Xinren waved his hand.</p><p>\"There's no need. I have the items here.\" As he spoke, Mo Wuji brought out a jade vase and a storage ring and threw them to Ku Xinren.</p><p>\"The Breath of Hongmeng?\" Ku Xinren didn't send his spiritual will into the storage ring. Instead, he was grasping the jade vase agitatedly; his body even seemed to be shaking.</p><p>The Breath of Hongmeng, this was actually the Breath of Hongmeng…</p><p>The highly yearned Breath of Hongmeng was actually brought right to his doorstep. Even though he was holding it in his hands, he still suspected that it might be an illusion.</p><p>\"This thing should be enough to nourish your fleshly body, right?\" Mo Wuji said contentedly.</p><p>Ku Xinren's spiritual will entered the storage ring; ten peak-grade god spiritual veins lay silently inside. Each vein even contained the energy of creation. This was definitely the energy of creation and these were definitely creation god spiritual veins. Compared to an average peak-grade god spiritual veins, these were many levels higher.</p><p>\"Good stuff, good stuff…\" As Ku Xinren was saying this, he had already stored these items in his world. No matter what Mo Wuji was going to say next, he wasn't going to return the Breath of Hongmeng and god spiritual veins.</p><p>After storing the items, he looked at Mo Wuji in a completely different light, \"You can rest assured. As long as you can bring me the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo…\"</p><p>\"Don't need. My Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo is already here.\" Mo Wuji opened his palm and a 30-centimetre-long, crystal-clear bamboo appeared on his palm. The leaves of this ice bamboo were like snowflakes. Each had six round cloves and there were a total of eight leaves.</p><p>Originally, this Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo had nine leaves. However, Mo Wuji had plucked one off and it was resting in his Mortal World.</p><p>\"It's the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo, it's actually the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo…\" Ku Xinren's voice could no longer be described simply as shaking. At the same time, his eyes were filled with extreme desire. With both the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo, not only could he recover his power, he might even grow more powerful.</p><p>Mo Wuji only needed a single look at Ku Xinren's gaze to know that this thing was more useful to Ku Xinren than he had made it out to be.</p><p>\"Hurry and give it to me. Give the Bamboo to me.\" Ku Xinren anxiously extended a hand imprint and tried to grab the Bamboo.</p><p>Mo Wuji kept the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo and harrumphed coldly. His aura swept outwards, instantly dissipating Ku Xinren's hand imprint.</p><p>\"I respected you, which was why I called you 'Senior'. But what's the meaning of this? Out of the three things, I have given you the Breath of Hongmeng and the peak-grade god spiritual veins. You haven't even shown me the Time Plate but you want me to hand the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo to you? Since when was there such a method of trade? This is the first time that I, Mo Wuji, saw such a thing.\" Mo Wuji's expression was slightly overcast.</p><p>As he was speaking, his spirit storage channel had already enveloped this bamboo house. If Ku Xinren dared to play any tricks, then don't blame him for attacking.</p><p>Ku Xinren suppressed his agitation. He said anxiously, \"It's my fault…\"</p><p>After which, he brought out a round plate. This plate gave off an ancient and majestic aura; it seemed to contain the powerful Laws of Time. Mo Wuji had encountered many supreme treasures; he even had the Furnace of the Heaven and Earth. Thus, he only needed a single glance at this round plate to know that it was definitely the Time Plate.</p><p>Mo Wuji nodded and he brought out the Extreme Ice Heavenly Bamboo. He took a step forward and said, \"Let's pass the items at the same time.\"</p><p>As he was speaking, Mo Wuji had brought his hand slightly forward.</p><p>Even though the item in Mo Wuji's hand was what he desperately needed, Ku Xinren still wavered at the instant before the trade.</p><p>The Time Plate. HIS Time Plate. Those years ago, he used this Time Plate to transcend many levels. Even Sages would have some apprehensions against him. The reason why he could become one of the four Dao Monarchs wasn't because of his Laws of Darkness but because of his Time Plate.</p><p>Because of his Time Plate, he could advance rapidly and fight for cultivation resources.</p><p>Today, he actually had to give the Time Plate away. This was no less than bleeding his heart dry.</p><p>He subconsciously looked at Mo Wuji. Mo Wuji's expression was calm, seemingly unafraid that he would play any tricks. Ku Xinren sighed. He still hesitated slightly as he brought the Time Plate slightly forward. He had not considered fully about what he should do.</p><p>If he was stronger, he would definitely kill Mo Wuji and obtain all of Mo Wuji's treasures.</p><p>But now, his power had fallen to an all-time low. It was the same as Mo Wuji's analogy; now, he was a mortal that was dying of thirst in a desert.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
