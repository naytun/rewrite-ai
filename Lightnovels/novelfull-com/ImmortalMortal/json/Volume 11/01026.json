That oldest Heavenly God cultivator was so flustered that he started to mutter to himself.</p><p>A few breaths of time passed before this oldest cultivator finally regained his countenance. He stared at Mo Wuji in shock, \"You're not a Nascent God, your cultivation hasn't been restricted…\"</p><p>As he was speaking, this cultivator was scanning around for an escape path with his spiritual will. He had come to realise that he shouldn't be worried about Huang Huang's death, but for his own life.</p><p>The Cosmos Edge's defensive array was installed by Mo Wuji. The moment this Gods Race cultivator sent his spiritual will outwards, Mo Wuji was able to detect it</p><p>Indeed, this oldest Heavenly God cultivator started to rapidly retreat after he found an escape path. At the same time, another Gods Race Heavenly God cultivator followed him in retreat.</p><p>Mo Wuji stood on his spot. He simply released two punches.</p><p>Two Domain Crushing Fists. These fists were like two scorching Suns capable of tearing through space. They whizzed through the air towards the two fleeing Heavenly Gods.</p><p>These two Heavenly Gods' cultivations had been restricted to the Great Circle of the Nascent God Stage due to their regulation talismans. When they sensed Mo Wuji's Domain Crushing Fist, they did not think about defending against it. Instead, they tried to retreat with greater frenzy. They seemed to be very confident in their escape techniques.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn't chase after them. He couldn't even be bothered to bring out his magic treasure.</p><p>\"Bang! Bang!\" These two fleeing Heavenly Gods seemed to slam against an invisible wall; they were unable to move any further. These two Heavenly Gods would never be able to notice Mo Wuji's void array runes.</p><p>At the next instant, the two Domain Crushing Fists landed on the two Heavenly God cultivators.</p><p>Two mists of blood exploded.</p><p>Except for that white-faced cultivator caught by Mo Wuji's elemental hand, three of the seven Gods Race cultivators were eliminated in the blink of an eye.</p><p>The remaining Heavenly God and three Nascent Gods looked at Mo Wuji with ashen faces. They had killed countless people from other races. When it was time for time to be killed, they finally felt fear.</p><p>\"You can't kill us. We're from the true Gods Race. In our Gods Race, not only do we have countless supreme God Kings, we also have many Unity Gods… If you wipe us out, even though they're many worlds away, the experts of our Gods Race will still come after you. As long as you don't kill us, we can swear a soul oath…\" That remaining Heavenly God cried out anxiously.</p><p>Before Mo Wuji could say anything, a voice broke through the air sharply, \"Brother Mo, don't listen to him. None of his words is true…\"</p><p>\"Ce Hong, you b*stard thing, you still dare to show yourself.\" When he saw who was the one speaking, Ni Kai shouted harshly.</p><p>If not for those Gods Race experts that were still alive, Ni Kai would have charged in front to kill Ce Hong.</p><p>Mo Wuji had detected Ce Hong a long time ago with his spiritual will. In his eyes, Ce Hong was already a dead man.</p><p>\"Brother Mo, back then, Jiao Luan coveted the Curse Arts, which was why he wanted to tear apart the defensive array that Brother Mo had laid down. It was truly hateful that I had been possessed by his words and I followed him to tear apart your seals, releasing the Gods Race's curse runes.\" Ce Hong seemed to be very agitated. He said all these words in a single breath.</p><p>Noticing that Mo Wuji didn't have any expressions on his face, nor any intentions of attacking, Ce Hong sighed in relief. He knew that an expert like Mo Wuji would definitely lust over peak-grade sacred arts. As long as he mentioned the Curse Arts, he would have a chance to survive.</p><p>After saying those words, Ce Hong caught his breath and continued slowly, \"It was too late for regrets. Fortunately, we obtained the Curse Arts and I have thoroughly memorised it. The reason why the Gods Race cultivators hadn't killed me was because they wanted my Curse Arts. I had always been trying to find ways to kill these beasts. However, I was helpless with my inferior cultivation. I could only use my Curse Arts to exchange for some time…\"</p><p>\"Are you done?\" Mo Wuji looked emotionlessly towards Ce Hong.</p><p>\"Ah…\" Ce Hong didn't understand the meaning behind Mo Wuji's words. He promptly added, \"A thing like the Curse Arts definitely couldn't be given to the Gods Race. It's truly too strong. I've decided to pass the Curse Arts to Brother Mo…\"</p><p>\"If you're done, then you can die.\" Mo Wuji opened his hand and an elemental hand grabbed towards Ce Hong. Thereafter, he formed another ten void runes and he threw a flame into those runes.</p><p>Ce Hong's cried out miserably, \"Mo Wuji, the Curse Arts is definitely the top sacred art in the entire universe. Don't tell me you don't want such a sacred art…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji couldn't be bothered with Ce Hong's words. This fella had brought the Gods Race over, resulting in the deaths of millions of people. It would be weird if he spared such a person.</p><p>Within the flames, Ce Hong's cries became increasingly miserable and shrill. Ni Kai subconsciously shivered. Those years ago, Mo Wuji had killed several Dao Emperors and Grand Emperors in Cosmos Edge. Since then, Ni Kai knew that Mo Wuji definitely wasn't a soft-hearted person.</p><p>Looking at the cruel way that Mo Wuji was killing Ce Hong, he was secretly glad that he hadn't coveted the Great Curse Arts. Otherwise, if he managed to survive the Gods Race cultivators, he would currently be burning within those flames.</p><p>The surviving Gods Race cultivators looked at this scene with trepidations in their hearts. Even the fella that tried to use the Gods Race to threaten Mo Wuji did not continue speaking.</p><p>Mo Wuji's gaze swept across the group of them, \"This time, there are several people from the Gods Race that came over. Besides the group of you, is there anyone else?\"</p><p>That Heavenly God clasped his fists towards Mo Wuji and said, \"This Dao Friend should have come from the God World. I'm willing to reveal everything, I only request…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji said coldly, \"Your hands are stained with the blood of the innocent. You have no rights to make any requests. Are you going to speak or not?\"</p><p>This Heavenly God cultivator's heart trembled. After which, he simply decided to close his mouth and keep silent.</p><p>Mo Wuji opened his hand once more. His powerful whirlpool domain wrapped around this Heavenly God cultivator, throwing him beside the howling Ce Hong.</p><p>The terrifying flames surged towards him. Another voice joined the anguished howls. This Heavenly God immediately tore apart his regulation talisman. The pressure from the Laws of the Heaven and Earth pressed down on him. His body directly crumbled into pieces. Before his primordial spirit could emerge, the flames swept over, burning him into nothingness.</p><p>Staring at the frightened Gods Race cultivators, Mo Wuji said coldly, \"To the one who is willing to answer me honestly, I will give him a swift death. And at the same time, he would have a chance to reincarnate…\"</p><p>\"Senior, I can answer you…\" The Gods Race cultivator that was first grabbed by Mo Wuji eagerly said when he heard those words.</p><p>\"Senior, I can also answer you…\" Another Gods Race cultivator cried out anxiously.</p><p>The remaining two looked at one another. As they were hesitating, Mo Wuji's elemental hand had already grabbed them.</p><p>\"Wait, Senior, I can also answer you…\" One of the Nascent Gods cried out in shock.</p><p>\"Too late.\" As he was speaking, Mo Wuji had already thrown the two of them into the flames.</p><p>Seemingly knowing that Mo Wuji was out of patience, that white-faced Gods Race cultivator hurriedly said, \"Senior, there were a total of 10 of us that came. Among which, one of us had been overzealous when cultivating the Curse Arts and his soul was destroyed. Another person heard that there were Black Spatial Fruits in Oblique Space Sea Island, so he went over.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji's heart jolted. He naturally knew how valuable the Black Spatial Fruits in Oblique Space Sea Island were. The Black Spatial Fruits could definitely be named as Dao Fruits. This was because each fruit contained a strand of the Laws of Space.</p><p>Ape Mo said disdainfully, \"Even if his cultivation was stronger, he wouldn't be able to break into Oblique Space Sea Island.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji nodded. He did agree with Ape Mo's words. If Oblique Space Sea Island didn't open by itself, it was definitely hard for an external force to try and open it. At the very least, Mo Wuji believed that a Heavenly God wouldn't be able to open it. What more a Heavenly God that had been restrained with a regulation talisman?</p><p>\"I'm worried that this person would get wind of what happened and flee. And by the time Sect Head Mo leaves, this Gods Race cultivator would re-emerge and cause havoc,\" Lu Ziting said worriedly.</p><p>By this time, the howling Ce Hong and two Gods Race cultivators had already been turned into ashes. Mo Wuji opened his palm and slaughtered these two remaining Nascent Gods. After which, he said, \"There's no need to worry. Ape Mo, you, Sect Head Lu and Dao Friend Ni Kai can consolidate our powers here in Cosmos Edge. There's still a lot of surviving cultivators here. Now that I have killed the Gods Race cultivators that were using the Curse Arts, those cultivators will be able to recover from their curse. I need to hurry back to the curse runes at Gods Precipice Continent and find some ways to seal it up.\" Mo Wuji said nonchalantly.</p><p>Ni Kai anxiously said, \"Brother Mo, what if that Gods Race cultivator that went to Oblique Space Sea Island comes back? What do we do?\"</p><p>\"Da Huang, you and Shuai Guo will stay here. If that Gods Race cultivator comes back, the two of you will try and find some ways to tie him down.\" Mo Wuji called Da Huang and Shuai Guo out.</p><p>Da Huang was already at Nascent God Level 9 while Shuai Guo was at Nascent God Level 5. The two of them would definitely be able to defend against a Nascent God cultivator.</p><p>\"My lord, you can rest assured. If that Gods Race ant comes, I definitely won't let him escape,\" Shuai Guo patted his chest.</p><p>Mo Wuji couldn't be bothered with this fella. He hurriedly gave some instructions to Ape Mo and co., then he disappeared with his Wind Escape Technique.</p><p>Ni Kai was worried but he did not feel right suspecting Shuai Guo's and Da Huang's capabilities. Lu Ziting, on the other hand, didn't think too much about this. He had already hastened towards Cosmos Edge. There were still many Human Race survivors there.</p><p>…</p><p>Not long after Mo Wuji left, a silver light sped into Cosmos Edge. At this time, Ni Kai and co. had only just arrived into Cosmos Edge as well. Lu Ziting didn't even have time to start rallying the surviving cultivators.</p><p>\"What's the matter?\" The silver light landed. A tall male cultivator with long hair appeared. He stared questioningly at Lu Ziting and co. At the same time, he sent his spiritual will outwards. What happened to the energy from the Curse Arts? Where did his Gods Race comrades go off to?</p><p>Ni Kai said anxiously, \"It's that fella that went to Oblique Space Sea Island. Dao Friend Ape Mo, hurry and send a message to City Lord Mo…\"</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
