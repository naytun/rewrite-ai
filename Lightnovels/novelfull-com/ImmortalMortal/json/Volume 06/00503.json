There definitely must have been a huge spirit gathering array with cumulated the immortal spiritual energy from the natural surroundings. This sort of environment was the best for cultivation. At least, this sort of environment would strongly complement immortal crystals; it would be much better than cultivating with immortal crystals solely.</p><p>Mo Wuji even thought that if he could stay in this immortal ruins for two months, he would very likely be able to advance from the early Golden Immortal Stage to the intermediate stage.</p><p>Regardless of how long Murong Xiangyu and co. were going to stay in this Sharphorn Immortal Ruins, Mo Wuji decided that he was definitely going to find a place to stay. Thereafter, it would be best if he could advance into the intermediate Golden Immortal Stage here.</p><p>Mo Wuji circled around the huge streets and alleys for close to a day, till he even started to suffer from a massive headache, but he was still unable to find a place to stay.</p><p>The prices of the rooms here in the Sharphorn Immortal Ruins were truly too expensive. Occasionally, he would find some rooms, but not only were the prices astronomical, the rooms weren’t quiet, and the environment was simply unbearable.</p><p>Thus, Mo Wuji decided to temporarily give up on finding a place; he would first go to a teahouse and gather some news to make sense of his situation. Just at this moment, a slightly sharp voice called out to him, \"This senior, may I ask if you’re looking for a place to stay?\"</p><p>The one who called him was a rather thin Heavenly Immortal cultivator; the skin on his face was especially black, but his teeth were completely white; he left a very deep impression on a person.</p><p>\"That’s right, I’m indeed looking for a quiet place to stay. Do you have a solution?\" Mo Wuji replied.</p><p>Mo Wuji knew that he shouldn’t underestimate this sorts of cultivators that found business along these streets; such people had their own unique methods.</p><p>\"I wonder what kind of room senior is looking for, and do you have any conditions?\" The thin cultivator immediately replied respectfully.</p><p>With the number of immortal crystals on him, Mo Wuji couldn’t be considered a sugar daddy; but he should have enough to find a suitable place to stay. When he heard this thin cultivator’s words, he knew that he would very likely be able to get a room, \"Firstly, it needs to be quiet. Secondly, it needs to be suitable for cultivation. Lastly, the environment must be nice.\"</p><p>The moment he heard Mo Wuji’s words, this thin cultivator knew that he had met a rich man. He was instantly enlivened, \"If senior isn’t anxious, if you wait for another four hours, I will be able to help senior find a suitable place to stay. The introduction fee is only 500 high-grade immortal crystals.\"</p><p>He knew that for cultivators like Mo Wuji, what they cared about wasn’t immortal crystals, but the environment.</p><p>Mo Wuji stared at this thin cultivator curiously, \"Why must I wait for four hours?\"</p><p>This thin cultivator was afraid that Mo Wuji was sceptical of him, so he hurriedly explained, \"Because I know of a very good immortal resthouse. Four hours later, a few customers would be leaving. If senior is able to leave me a communication bead, I can inform you when the time comes.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji wanted to ask this fella some questions, so he said simply, \"Then I will wait with you. You can just bring me to a teahouse near the resthouse that you’re recommending.\"</p><p>When the thin cultivator heard Mo Wuji’s words, he said ecstatically, \"I’m called Dou Hualong. Senior, please follow me.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji never expected that this thin cultivator that did such odd jobs would have such a grand name: Dou Hualong. [1]</p><p>One incense’s time later, Dou Hualong brought Mo Wuji to a teahouse by the side of the river; the moment Mo Wuji arrived, he fell in love with the environment. Not only was it quiet, it was very suitable for cultivation.</p><p>Seemingly noticing Mo Wuji’s contentment, Dou Hualong pointed to a grand resthouse not far from the tea house, \"Later, we will be going to that Riverface Immortal Resthouse. I know the people there; I’ve already informed them to immediately arrange for you to enter the moment the previous customer leaves. There’s no more unique grade rooms and high-grade rooms; there’s only an intermediate grade room, and it costs 1,000 high-grade immortal crystals per night…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji inhaled deeply; the price was truly too high: 1,000 high-grade immortal crystals a night, but he only got an intermediate grade room. The moment this Dou Hualong heard of his conditions, that fella didn’t even consider the prices. Looks like this fella occasionally met with some wealthy people.</p><p>Fortunately, Mo Wuji still had some high-grade immortal crystals; he could still afford 1,000 high-grade immortal crystals a night. The key thing was that in this sort of environment, he would definitely be able to advance into the intermediate Golden Immortal Stage quickly.</p><p>\"Alright, let’s go in and talk.\" Mo Wuji could get immortal crystals easily; besides sighing at the astronomical price, he didn’t say anything further.</p><p>After the two found a corner and sat down, Mo Wuji directly asked, \"Do you prefer tea or wine?\"</p><p>Even though the time since he advanced into the Immortal Realm could not be considered short, he had always been a \"blind\" immortal. There were loads of questions which he wanted to ask, and this Dou Hualong in front of him was his best answer.</p><p>A hint of desire emerged in Dou Hualong’s eyes as he said, \"The Green Bamboo Immortal Wine is not bad, but the price is too steep; one flask requires 2,000 high-grade immortal crystals.\"</p><p>By now, Mo Wuji was already used to the exorbitant prices here in Sharphorn Immortal Ruins. He gestured to the waiter, \"Bring two flasks of Green Bamboo Immortal Wine.\"</p><p>The waiter's speed was really fast, he swiftly arrived in front of Mo Wuji and Dou Hualong with two wine flasks inscribed ‘Green Bamboo’.</p><p>After Mo Wuji paid the 4,000 high-grade immortal crystals, he pushed one flask to Dou Hualong while he opened the other one for himself. Mo Wuji didn't know much about wine, he also hadn't had any good wine ever since he came to the Immortal World. After he opened this Green Bamboo Immortal Wine, its distinct and intense fragrance struck him, making him feel especially comfortable; even before he drank the wine, a pleasant sensation had already spread throughout him.</p><p>As he brought the flask up to his lips to take a sip, the pleasant sensation instantly flooded his pores; Mo Wuji could not help but praise, \"Truly some good wine.\"</p><p>The only thing this wine was lacking was a sort of viciousness. Even though its texture was good, there were some imperfections in its beauty.</p><p>On the other hand, Dou Hualong anxiously brought the flask to his mouth, and with a ‘glug’, an entire mouthful had already entered him. After swallowing that mouthful of wine, he sighed contentedly. He clasped his fists towards Mo Wuji and said, \"Many thanks senior for treating me to this good wine. As long as it's something I, Dou Hualong, know, I will definitely answer them. Senior, feel free to ask me questions.\"</p><p>Clearly, he also knew that Mo Wuji didn't bring him here especially to treat him to wine; Mo Wuji probably wanted to ask him some questions.</p><p>\"Many thanks.\" Mo Wuji also clasped his fists in return. After a short pause, he asked, \"Because I've always been confined to my family clan, cultivating, this is my first time out here. So I don't really know of the rough situation of the Immortal World. I hope Dao Friend Dou will be able to shed some light.\"</p><p>Hearing Mo Wuji's simple question, Dou Hualong was especially spirited as he answered, \"The Immortal World has seven huge Immortal Domains, namely Luo Ling Immortal Domain, Zero Heaven Immortal Domain, Gods Immortal Domain, Mahesvara Immortal Domain, Sala Buddha Immortal Domain, Six Paths Immortal Domain and Yong Ying Immortal Domain.</p><p>Among which, Zero Heaven Immortal Domain is the demon domain, Gods Immortal Domain is the god domain, Six Paths Immortal Domain is the devil domain, and Sala Buddha Immortal Domain is the Buddhist domain.The weakest is Yong Ying Immortal Domain, while the strongest is rumoured to be Buddhist domain. As for the most mysterious, it would have to be the god domain. The Sharphorn Immortal Ruins that we're in now should be within the Mahesvara Immortal Domain's territory. However, I heard that Mahesvara Immortal Domain's Heavenly Emperor doesn't really like governing, so Sharphorn Immortal Ruins gradually became independent.\"</p><p>As Mo Wuji heard all this, he finally had a rough understanding of the Immortal World. Just as he was about to ask about Star-grade geniuses, Dou Hualong suddenly whispered to him, \"Actually I heard that there's another Immortal Domain called the Underworld, and its closest to Six Paths Immortal Domain. Recently, it's been rumoured that you must go through the Six Paths Immortal Domain in order to get to the Underworld.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji's heart tightened; he hurriedly asked, \"Then is the Underworld the place which controls reincarnation?\"</p><p>\"I'm not sure about that. But I heard that some of the absolute experts in the Immortal World would go to the Underworld if their closed ones died; they would find their closed ones’ souls there and bring them back to life. Of course, this is merely a hearsay. As for the validity of it, I'm not very sure.\" Dou Hualong seemed to subconsciously lower his volume.</p><p>Mo Wuji suddenly asked with great urgency, \"Then if a close one dies and loses her primordial spirit and soul, as long as her fleshly body is present, then it's possible to go to the Underworld to find her soul?\"</p><p>Dou Hualong was slightly stupefied, but after a short pause, he answered, \"According to the rumours, it's possible. It's said that within the void in between Six Paths Immortal Domain and the Underworld, there's the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond. As long as the fleshly body is present, and if enough world treasures are brought there, then it's possible to reform the soul and bring that cultivator back to life.\"</p><p>\"Then which are the world treasures needed?\" Mo Wuji almost stood up.</p><p>Dou Hualong shook his head, \"I only heard all these rumours. I'm not sure whether they are even true.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji immediately regained his countenance; he knew he had been too anxious. If Dou Hualong knew of such things, then they must definitely be common knowledge. And if what Dou Hualong says was true, then with his current ability, then he would only be dreaming if he wanted to go to the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond. By the time his power gets to that level, he would easily have heard of such rumours.</p><p>\"Tell me about Star-grade geniuses then.\" Mo Wuji could feel Dou Hualong’s astonishment, so he took the initiative to change the topic.</p><p>If Mo Wuji’s intense attention on the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond left Dou Hualong astonished, then Mo Wuji’s question about Star-grade geniuses had left him thoroughly shocked. Fortunately, he had his professionalism; even though he was slightly dazed over why Mo Wuji would ask such simple questions, he still explained, \"Actually, for a cultivator to reach great heights, not only is hard work and fate important, the most important factor is actually talent. Those cultivators with great talents and spiritual roots are called Star-grade geniuses.</p><p>And to make things more convenient for sects to accept disciples, there are different grades within the geniuses, from One Star to Nine Star. Typically, only Five Star Geniuses and above have the rights to become an Immortal Emperor. For Nine Star Geniuses, as long as they don’t die, they have a 50% chance of becoming an Immortal Emperor.\"</p><p>\"Oh, then Star-grade geniuses are classified based on the number of spirit channels they open, right?\" Mo Wuji tried to bring the explanation into his own terms.</p><p>Dou Hualong explained, \"Spirit channels are only one factor. Typically, Five Star Geniuses and above have more than 100 spirit channels…\"</p><p>As he got here, Dou Hualong suddenly looked at his communication bead; he stood up and said, \"Senior, Riverface Immortal Resthouse’s room is now open. Should we go over now?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji also stood up, \"Of course we should go now. Let’s go.\"</p><p>He still had many questions that he wanted to ask Dou Hualong, but he wasn’t in a rush, he could wait till he advanced to the intermediate Golden Immortal Stage first. On the other hand, it was so hard to find a place to stay in Sharphorn Immortal Ruins, so he should settle that first.</p><p>\"Oh right, senior. A few months later, some big sects from a few of the Immortal Domains will be coming to Sharphorn Immortal Ruins to accept disciples. Riverface Immortal Resthouse is not far from the plaza that they will be holding the event at. If senior is interested, you could take a look,\" Dou Hualong said as they walked out of the teahouse.</p><p>[1] Probably because of the dragon (long) in the name.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
