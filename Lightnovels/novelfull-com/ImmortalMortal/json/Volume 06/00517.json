After saying that, he placed the Fire Heartstone back into the jade box, but he didn’t pass the box back to the woman from Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>The moment Cha Kai saw this situation, he knew that if he was bent on having this Fire Heartstone, he would be forming an enmity with Mo Wuji. Anyway, if Mo Wuji hadn’t come, Ao Tiancheng wouldn’t have simply let him have the Fire Heartstone. Since Mo Wuji had spoke in such a manner, he straightforwardly said, \"Since Elder Mo likes that stone, then I don’t want it, Elder Mo can have it.\"</p><p>With that, he glanced meaningfully at Ao Tiancheng, then said in an eccentric manner, \"I’m wondering how Immortal Friend Ao is going to compensate you. I believe that Immortal Friend Ao would take the initiative to pay for this Fire Heartstone.\"</p><p>Ao Tiancheng snorted, turned and left.</p><p>He could forget about the Fire Heartstone, but if this Mo Wuji must be dreaming if Mo Wuji expected him to spend his own immortal crystals to purchase this Fire Heartstone as compensation.</p><p>Mo Wuji said indifferently, \"Ao Tiancheng, if you dare leave this establishment without compensation, I will do two things. One, I will request for the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance to immediately end all deals with the Surging Dragon Golden River. Two, after I purchase this stone, I will beat you back at where you came from. Oh right, don’t worry, I will not ask the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance for help. I will beat you by myself.\"</p><p>With that, Mo Wuji stared at Ao Tiancheng with an icy cold expression; he wasn’t kidding when he said those words. He was a Honorary Elder; it definitely wouldn’t be a problem to ask the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance to do that. If the alliance couldn’t even do such a simple thing, then he would rather not be a Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Honorary Elder.</p><p>As for beating Ao Tiancheng back at where he came from, Mo Wuji wasn’t lying about that.</p><p>He didn’t even fear Ao Tiancheng. With his identity, even if he had a huge battle with Ao Tiancheng back at Ao Tiancheng’s home ground, he wouldn’t even face any consequences. More importantly, battling with Ao Tiancheng would only bring him benefits, and not consequences.</p><p>But it would be different for Ao Tiancheng. Since someone had come knocking on his door but he wasn’t able to do anything about it, he would be losing all of his face.</p><p>Ao Tiancheng stopped and a sharp light emerged from his eyes. Intense killing intent rose from his heart; if this wasn’t Sharphorn Immortal Ruins, he would have already attacked Mo Wuji.</p><p>However, his rationality was still there. He took a few deep breaths, then threw a storage ring to Du Ju, \"This is the payment for the Fire Heartstone. Goodbye.\"</p><p>After saying that, he turned and left. To be honest, he had never suffered such grievances ever since he started cultivation. If it was possible, he really wanted to have a huge battle with Mo Wuji and talk with his abilities and fists.</p><p>However, he wouldn’t simply forget about the grievances he suffered today. He did not believe that Mo Wuji would stay cooped up in Sharphorn Immortal Ruins for his entire life. As long as Mo Wuji dares to leave Sharphorn Immortal Ruins, then Mo Wuji couldn’t blame him for trying to take his life.</p><p>It was just that he had no choice but to relent today; Surging Dragon Golden River’s dependence on the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance was not small. Even the pills he used to advance to the Xuan Immortal Stage was from the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance. Moreover, the Surging Dragon Golden River still needed many more strategic pills for the Grand Zhi Immortal Stage, or even the Immortal King Stage.</p><p>If the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance was to be offended, then his Surging Dragon Golden River would gradually be trampled under others’ feet.</p><p>Another reason was that he was really afraid that Mo Wuji would go to where he came from and beat him. He, Ao Tiancheng, was a proud man. If a Golden Immortal came knocking on his door for a fight, wouldn’t he be losing his reputation? There was no need to talk about how mysterious Mo Wuji’s power was. Even if the other party’s power was very low, could he still dare kill the other party?</p><p>Now that Mo Wuji obtained what he wanted, he clasped his fists to Du Ju and Cha Kai, \"Many thanks Dao Friend Du and Dao Friend Cha. This Mo will be leaving now, we will meet again in the future if I need any help.\"</p><p>He knew that it was impossible to get Ao Tiancheng to apologize. And when the two meet again privately in the future, they were sure to be in a life and death battle.</p><p>Since he had beat Ao Tiancheng down, Mo Wuji naturally wouldn’t want to form hostilities with Cha Kai. Moreover, Cha Kai seemed to have the intentions of befriending him; having one friend was definitely better than having one enemy,</p><p>\"Of course, of course. Let me send Elder Mo out,\" Du Ju grinned.</p><p>\"I’m also leaving. Since it’s convenient, I will leave with Elder Mo,\" Cha Kai also stood up and smiled. Either way, there was nothing bad from befriending a branch elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance.</p><p>…</p><p>In a rest house near Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion, Shen Muqing had called for some tea as she waited; she really wanted to know how things would have turned out.</p><p>There were no sounds from Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion for a long time; she even wondered whether Mo Wuji and Dou Hualong had already been killed inside.</p><p>Sharphorn Immortal Ruins did not permit killing, but Mo Wuji had destroyed the Treasure Pavilion’s stone lion. Under such circumstances, it was possible for Mo Wuji to be killed.</p><p>After some time, she saw Ao Tiancheng leaving with a face full of killing intent and resentment. She could not help but think: Could Cha Kai have won?</p><p>The answer soon appeared in front of her eyes. She even thought that her eyes were fooling her and she immediately rubbed her eyes.</p><p>Mo Wuji and Dou Hualong walked out without harm. Not only that, the Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion’s Shopkeeper Du Ju was behind them with smiles plastered all over his face; he was clearly sending Mo Wuji off. Even Cha Kai was walking beside Mo Wuji, seemingly also sending Mo Wuji off.</p><p>After walking for some distance out of the Treasure Pavilion, Cha Kai actually clasped his fists to Mo Wuji and bid his farewells. Du Ju also seemed to speak some words of courtesy before turning and returning back to the Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion.</p><p>Mo Wuji really left Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion without losing a single hair.</p><p>Shen Muqing was not a fool; she immediately knew what was going on. As expected, Mo Wuji was of startling origins, otherwise, Du Ju and Cha Kai wouldn’t have behaved in such a manner. He was even personally sent out by the shopkeeper despite destroying the Treasure Pavilion’s stone lion.</p><p>Moreover, there was also that Ao Tiancheng that left first; that guy clearly seemed to suffer some loss. Why would Ao Tiancheng suffer a loss? Even if Shen Muqing used her limbs to think, she could also deduce that it was because Ao Tiancheng was the one to cause Dou Hualong’s injuries.</p><p>Shen Muqing inhaled deeply; she had missed the opportunity to befriend Mo Wuji. This incident had also let her understand one principle: if she wanted to befriend a person, she should not worry or fear anything. If she had an attitude that only cared about the benefits and did not want to share hardships, then she would be completely unable to make a true friend. She guessed that Mo Wuji wasn’t ordinary, but when she could contribute to help him, she hesitated.</p><p>Fortunately, she was now acquainted with Mo Wuji, so she didn’t waste her previous efforts. Even though she couldn’t become a bosom friend of Mo Wuji’s, she was an acquaintance at the very least, and she even left behind a favour. There was nothing bad about that.</p><p>…</p><p>Mo Wuji did not immediately return to Riverface Immortal Resthouse, but headed to the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance. Dou Hualong told him that Gong Yi had already helped him set up a store; he wanted to see how the store turned out.</p><p>\"Elder Mo.\" Just as Mo Wuji reached the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Sharphorn Branch, Gong Yi received the news and came to welcome him.</p><p>Mo Wuji said respectfully, \"Deacon Gong, I will be behind closed doors during this period of time. I will have to trouble you for help.\"</p><p>Gong Yi grinned to the point where his eyes couldn’t be seen and he said hurriedly, \"There’s no trouble, no trouble at all. We’ve already found a store. It was primarily due to Manager Guo’s help, I was merely a runner.\"</p><p>As he spoke, Gong Yi brought out a scroll and passed it to Mo Wuji, \"This is the store’s contract deed. In the future, this store would be Elder Mo’s.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji originally wanted to rent a store; he never expected that Guo Qi would buy him one. He hurriedly said, \"Then I would have to thank Sister Guo. I need to do that personally, and pass her the money at the same time.\"</p><p>Purchasing a store in Sharphorn Immortal Ruins definitely didn’t cost a small number. Even if Mo Wuji wasn’t able to afford it, he wanted to know the price, then think of how he could repay it.</p><p>Gong Yi hurriedly said, \"Manager Guo, President Shang and Pill King Shunan have left Sharphorn Immortal Ruins due to an urgent matter. President Shang even said that he would invite Elder Mo for a banquet when he returns.\"</p><p>Leave Sharphorn Immortal Ruins for an urgent matter? Something that could get the few important figures of Pill Dao Immortal Ruins to leave at the same time definitely wasn’t a small matter.</p><p>\"Elder Mo, let me bring you to the store.\" Gong Yi was very quick-witted. Mo Wuji was a capable Pill King that even Manager Guo and Second President Shang wanted to befriend. Now that he had the opportunity, he would naturally help and befriend Mo Wuji.</p><p>\"Alright, then I would have to trouble Deacon Gong.\" Mo Wuji nodded.</p><p>…</p><p>The store that Guo Qi found for Mo Wuji was half an hour away from Pill Dao Immortal Alliance; it could not be considered very far. Even though it wasn’t in the the busiest place in Sharphorn Immortal Ruins, there was a constant and steady flow of people.</p><p>What left Mo Wuji most satisfied was that this store wasn’t small. It was hundreds of square meters in area, and it even had three floors.</p><p>It was already considered incredibly to have such a store in Sharphorn Immortal Ruins. Even some sizeable sects would not be able to have such a territory.</p><p>The moment he entered the store, Mo Wuji saw rows of shiny product cabinets. Even though the cabinets were empty, it showed that the person who decided the layout had been very diligent.</p><p>\"Many thanks Deacon Gong.\" Mo Wuji expressed his gratitude sincerely.</p><p>Gong Yi waved his hand slightly awkwardly. He seemed to have something to say but he felt uncomfortable saying it.</p><p>Mo Wuji asked curiously, \"Does Deacon Gong want to say something?\"</p><p>Gong Yi suddenly kneel on the ground, \"Elder Mo, my Pill Dao has been stagnant. I want to plead elder to be my teacher.</p><p>Mo Wuji startled; this fella was really something. This Gong Yi was already a Grand Yi Immortal, but he wanted to take a Golden Immortal as a teacher?</p><p>\"Please stand up and take. I’m also in the process of learning, so I can’t take any disciples,\" Mo Wuji said indifferently.</p><p>It wasn’t because he didn’t want to take in disciples, but it was because Gong Yi didn’t satisfy his standards for a disciple.</p><p>Seeing Gong Yi stand up despondently, Mo Wuji consoled, \"You’re also the Assessment Deacon for Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, so it isn’t convenient for you to come here…\"</p><p>\"Elder Mo, I can come here and work for you. Our Pill Dao Immortal Alliance doesn’t care too much about this. Our pill refiners don’t get restrained by the alliance, they can do anything they want,\" Gong Yi said hurriedly.</p><p>Mo Wuji sank into contemplation; his pill house was opening, so he would need some help. This Gong Yi was slightly snobbish, but he was an experienced person. As he thought of this, Mo Wuji nodded, \"Since that’s the case, you can work here. I can give you some pointers occasionally, but regarding me being your master, there’s no need to talk about that.\"</p><p>\"Many thanks Elder Mo,\" Gong Yi rejoiced and said. What he wanted now was to be by Mo Wuji’s side and study the Pill Dao.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
