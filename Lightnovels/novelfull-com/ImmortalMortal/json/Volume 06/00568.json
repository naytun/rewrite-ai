Mo Wuji’s spiritual will and immortal elemental energy had been completely expended, and his body was corroded to the point that it looked as though as he had just been taken out from a pot of boiling magma, bloodied and full of frightening wounds.</p><p>At this point, he even lost the ability to look within his sea of consciousness, much less take out healing pills. The only thing he could do was to hide within the partially refined page of the Book of Luo and not move.</p><p>…</p><p>Cen Shuyin’s body had always stayed by Mo Wuji’s side. He not only used the Breath of Hongmeng to nourish it, but also used the vitality within his vitality channel to try to awaken her.</p><p>Not only ago, her soul had absorbed a large amount of Underworld Heart Flowers, so it had perfectly fused with the physical body upon contact.</p><p>What kind of treasures were Tier 9 immortal herbs and the Breath of Hongmeng? Even if Cen Shuyin was a real immortal instead of a low leveled cultivator, the Underworld Heart Flower could still easily fuse her soul and body together to revive her.</p><p>Before two hours were up, Cen Shuyin opened her eyes and sat up. She could feel the intense changes to her spirit channels. Every spirit channel was filled with burning spirituality. While she had just woke up, she knew that her aptitude was nothing like it was previously. But before she could search for Mo Wuji, a even more shocking thing happened: new spirit channels began to open. 94, 95…</p><p>This continued until 102 spirit channels appeared. There was no need to cultivate intentionally, and the surrounding immortal spirit energy gushed into her wildly, raising her cultivation level at an insane rate.</p><p>The unguided immortal spirit energy filled her to the point of bursting, so she had no choice but to calm down and cultivate. Her cultivation technique was Typhoon Formula, which wasn’t something any low level cultivation technique could compare to. Its speed of absorbing immortal spirit energy was unparalleled.</p><p>Nihility God Stage, True God Stage, Worldly Immortal Stage…</p><p>Lin Gu stared at Cen Shuyin in disbelief. She knew that Cen Shuyin’s cultivation level was very low, but she didn’t expect her to have such heaven defying talent. Being able to cultivate here was nothing surprising. After all, Cen Shuyin had absorbed the aura of the Underworld, so she could cultivate above the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond.</p><p>What shocked Lin Gu the most was the rate that Cen Shuyin’s cultivation level increased. In slightly over 10 days,she had reached the Great Circle of Earthly Immortal Stage.</p><p>As long as one did not advance to Heavenly Immortal Stage, there would basically be no lightning tribulation in the Immortal World. Hence, lightning tribulation awaited Cen Shuyin if she continued to advance her cultivation level further.</p><p>\"Elder Sister Shuyin, Brother Mo went into the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond…\" Lin Gu said with a sad tone as she saw Cen Shuyin stop cultivating.</p><p>While Cen Shuyin could sense that Lin Gu’s cultivation level was much higher than hers, she did not even find it unusual that Lin Gu had called her ‘elder sister’. The only thing on her mind was Mo Wuji charging into the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond.</p><p>It took a short few breaths of time for her to completely wake up, and she recalled that Wuji had slashed at the soul behind her as she charged out of the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond. Afterwhich, he dove straight in.</p><p>By now, while she was unsure why Mo Wuji could achieve all this, it was clear that her body was brought over by Mo Wuji, and the Underworld Heart Flowers were obtained by him to search for her soul.</p><p>Without saying a single word, Cen Shuyin leapt up towards the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond through the floating array platform that Mo Wuji set up.</p><p>Lin Gu was shocked, and quickly pulled her back with a large hand formed with immortal elemental energy.</p><p>\"Do you want to die? This is the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond that’s linked to the Underworld. The yin energy inside is frightening, and now you have a physical body. You’re no longer a soul, so once you go in, it’ll be courting death.\" Lin Gu chided.</p><p>Gazing upon the grey lake-like surface of the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond, Cen Shuyin mumbled to herself, \"Wuji jumped into the Soul Condensing Immortal Pond for me, where should I go now…\"</p><p>Lin Gu could understand that Cen Shuyin did not mean that she had no physical location to go to, but it reflected that her heart was empty, with nowhere to look towards.</p><p>\"Elder Sister Shuyin, in the past I did not understand why Brother Mo put his life on the line to save you, but now I do. But you also have to think for him. Do you know how difficult was it for him to rescue you? To obtain the Underworld Heart Flowers, he offended Heavenly Emperor Yifang. To come here, he gave up much more. It wouldn’t be right if you took Brother Mo’s efforts to save you lightly after he had just rescued you.\" Lin Gu said sincerely while looking at Cen Shuyin.</p><p>These words stunned Cen Shuyin for a moment. She understood what Lin Gu was saying, but what was the point of it if Mo Wuji used his life to exchange for hers?</p><p>Initially, she was willing to give up her life for Mo Wuji because she had recognised him as her husband. This was not only because he had seen her body in full glory at the Thorny Wind Gate, but more importantly as he was Rogue Cultivator 2705, the person that could have given up his life to save her.</p><p>Her mother had told her in the past, if she met a person that could die for her, then she should marry him. If she also died for him when he was in danger, then it would be true love. This was why she ignited her vitality to rescue Mo Wuji, to save the person that had already become her husband in her heart.</p><p>The scene before her soul crumbled remained crystal clear in her mind, as she told Mo Wuji, \"...I’ld really like to find out what it feels like to have a dao companion…\" Her mother had said before, this was love. She had never thought that she could be revived and meet with Mo Wuji once more.</p><p>It was a pity that their reunion lasted for mere breaths worth of time, before Mo Wuji swapped places with her. She went to the side of the living while Mo Wuji went to the Underworld. When, when could she and Mo Wuji both be alive, and become true dao companions? The two of them roaming the Immortal World side by side…</p><p>Seeing Mo Wuji gazing into space, Lin Gu sighed and continued, \"If you continue living and work hard on your cultivation, perhaps in the future you will be able to enter the Underworld to save Brother Mo. If you continue wasting away like you are now, then there’s no chance of that happening at all.\"</p><p>\"But Wuji doesn’t even have his physical body anymore.\" Cen Shuyin mumbled.Deep inside, Lin Gu knew that chances saving Mo Wuji was near zero. Without a physical body, there was no way to revive Mo Wuji even if they used 10,000 stalks of Underworld Heart Flowers. Thus she just sighed to herself, and ceased speaking.</p><p>Unexpectedly, Cen Shuyin was the one who calmed down. She looked into the Soul Condensing Immortal Pool and said, \"Maybe I can enter the Underworld directly to bring back Wuji.\"</p><p>She did not gain anything in the Underworld, but at least heard if rumors that a supremely strong person once tore through the dimension of the Underworld to take a soul away.</p><p>Perhaps there would be one day that she could cultivate to this extent, then she would bring Mo Wuji’s soul away.</p><p>When she thought of this, Cen Shuyin became calm. She had to work harder on cultivation.</p><p>\"Thank you elder for saving me. Did elder come here with Wuji?\" Cen Shuyin knew that Lin Gu’s cultivation level was many times greater than hers, so even though she did not know why Lin Gu referred to her as ‘elder sister’, she couldn’t disrespect Lin Gu.</p><p>With quick waves of her hand, Lin Gu replied, \"My name is Lin Gu. I’m friends with Mo Wuji. You are Brother Mo’s… so it’s natural for me to call you elder sister.\"</p><p>Lin Gu wasn’t completely sure of Cen Shuyin’s relationship with Mo Wuji, hence she could only mumble her way out of it.</p><p>Seeing that Cen Shuyin still had things to say, Lin Gu stopped her, before continuing, \"Let’s not argue about titles and honorifics. You can just call me Lin Gu. The title ‘elder’ makes me feel like a stranger.\"</p><p>Upon hearing that, Cen Shuyin didn’t argue any further. She knew that many things had happened, so she sat down and asked, \"Lin Gu, can you tell me what exactly happened here, to compel Wuji to come here to save me?\"</p><p>Regarding Mo Wuji’s past, Lin Gu didn’t know much. But for the incidents that occurred after Mo Wuji arrived at the Sharphorn Immortal Ruins, she had a rough idea of them. Without withholding anything, she recounted it all to Cen Shuyin, and at the end, she took out the page of the Book of Luo. While passing it to Cen Shuyin, she explained, \"Brother Mo left this page of the Book of Luo before he left. Refine this first, then we should be able to leave this place and return to the Immortal World.\"</p><p>The fame of the Book of Luo long preceded it, and Lin Gu was very touched that Mo Wuji would trust her enough to lend it to her. Which cultivator wouldn’t eye the Book of Luo? She wasn’t an exception either. But she valued her friendship with Mo Wuji even more. On top of that, there was the gratitude she felt towards him too. As someone willing to give away her life to him, what was a page of Book of Luo?</p><p>That’s right, the Book of Luo could help her bring Cen Shuyin out of the whirlpool. There was no doubt about it. What kind of thing was the Book of Luo?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
