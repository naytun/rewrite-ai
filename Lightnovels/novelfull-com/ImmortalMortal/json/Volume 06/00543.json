What he was concerned about was the opening of the Yunxian Immortal Valley after this alchemy competition so if something happened to the alchemy competition and they decided not to open the Yunxian Immortal Valley, where could he go to find his Underworld Heart Flower</p><p>\"What happened there?\" Mo Wuji managed to regain his composure very quickly.</p><p>\"My father sent me a message saying that the Heavenly Immortal was pressured by a lot of experts to change the conditions of the competition. To remove the restriction to the domains and the age limit..\" Wen Lianxi’s voice was filled with disappointment.</p><p>Mo Wuji heaved a sigh of relief because the competition wasn’t cancelled and the only change would be that the stature of pill refiners participating would be much higher than before. However, he should still be able to participate in the competition right? So why was Wen Lianxi so disappointed?</p><p>After pondering for a while, Mo Wuji finally understood why Wen Lianxi was as disappointed as she looked. The removal of these restrictions meant that any pill refiner of any immortal domain would be able to participate and even Pill Emperors would be eligible to participate. In such a scenario, Wen Lianxi believed that Mo Wuji would no longer be able to get into the top 50 with this increased level of competitiveness.</p><p>Try imagining who wouldn’t want to visit a place like the Yunxian Immortal Valley? Even some Pill Emperors would be interested so let alone the members of the all the other huge sects and Sky Lords.</p><p>What did it signify for one’s future the moment one managed to obtain a Tier 9 Immortal Herb?</p><p>\"Lianxi, you don’t have to worry because this wouldn’t affect us too greatly,\" Mo Wuji comforted her with this sentence.</p><p>Mo Wuji was truly not worried because he was after all an honoured grade Tier 5 Pill King who could even concoct low grade Tier 6 pills. This meant that he could also be considered as a Tier 6 Pill King. Given his present strength, even if all the pill refining experts in the immortal domain participated, it shouldn’t be too huge a task for him to get into the top 50.</p><p>Mo Wuji was well aware that there wasn’t too many Pill Emperors even if you looked across all 7 immortal domains. Furthermore, the Pill Emperors might not even participate in the competition and so what even if they do lower their ego to participate? He only had to get into the top 50 and not the top 5.</p><p>Mo Wuji could also guess the reason why the Heavenly Emperor was pressured. It should be because experts from the other domains were jealous of the Yong Ying Immortal Domain’s Yunxian Immortal Valley so they pressured the Yong Ying Immortal Domain’s Sky Lord to increase their odds of earning a slot to enter the Yunxian Immortal Valley via the competition.</p><p>\"My father requested for me to return the jade token immediately…\" Wen Lianxi found it hard to break this to Mo Wuji.</p><p>Initially, it was extremely tough to find a strong pill refiner to represent the Water Ying Immortal City but now, there were simply way too many pill refiners that could help them such that the Water Ying Immortal City didn’t even need to go looking for them and these experts would come looking for them.</p><p>Mo Wuji was able to empathise with Wen Lianxi because there were indeed way too many pill experts from the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance and even he was from the alliance. Mo Wuji was certain that all the strong and experienced pill refiners of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance would be going around looking for participation slots just like him.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t continue to promise Wen Lianxi anything because there were way too many experts around and even if he was confident he could get into the top 50, he wasn’t 100% certain as well. Moreover, he had already told Wen Lianxi that it wouldn’t affect their odds of getting into the top 50 so if Wen Lianxi really wanted to take his participation slot back, there was nothing he could do.</p><p>However, he believed that even without Wen Lianxi’s jade token, he would still have his ways of getting a slot for the competition. At the very most, he would just take out his Pill Dao Immortal Alliance honoured grade elder’s identity token.</p><p>Noticing Wen Lianxi’s pale face, Mo Wuji continued, \"I am 70% certain that I could get into the top 50 for the Water Ying Immortal City. Also, let me say something which might not be too pleasant to your ears. Even if you were to take this jade token back and give it to someone else to represent you, the outcome wouldn’t be any better.\"</p><p>Why would Wen Lianxi not know how true Mo Wuji last sentence was? Without the restrictions put in place, the Water Ying Immortal City’s competitive strength would not be very high. All the decent Pill Kings would have been taken away by the others and they could only choose from the pool of below average Pill Kings.</p><p>Normally, Tier 4 or 5 Pill Kings were considered to be quite incredible but in this competition, they wouldn’t mean much and could even be considered to be the weakest among all the other competitors.</p><p>\"Big Brother Mo, I trust you. You should stay here first while I go talk to my father. When the time comes, all you need to do is to represent the Water Ying Immortal City in this competition,\" Wen Lianxi finally made up her mind. She had already made a mistake once and if she were to make another mistake yet again by asking for the jade token back, it wouldn’t be a misunderstanding anymore. It would be a problem with her character.</p><p>After saying what she needed to say, Wen Lianxi bowed to Mo Wuji and left.</p><p>Mo Wuji hurried to stop Wen Lianxi, \"Hold on, let’s exchange messages for communication purposes.\"</p><p>Wen Lianxi shook her head, \"It's okay because I am worried that my father might force me to spill the beans. I have to leave now so thank you Big Brother Mo in advance.\"</p><p>Wen Lianxi was truly worried because even if his father didn’t force her, her mother would be nagging by her ear to get her to reveal Mo Wuji’s identity.</p><p>Watching Wen Lianxi hurrying out of the resthouse, Mo Wuji sighed.</p><p>He recalled the equally stunning Ji Yue and how she was constantly using others. Be it Ji Yue or Murong Xiangyu, their characters were simply not a match for Wen Lianxi.</p><p>Just as Mo Wuji was about to send Ji Yue a message, he received Ji Yue’s message saying that she didn’t use his identity token and found an accommodation at the Yue Gui Immortal Resthouse. She had even booked a room for him.</p><p>…</p><p>Ying Valley Immortal Resthouse was the number one immortal resthouse in the Yong Ying Immortal Domain. Whether it was the location in the Yong Ying Immortal Domain or grandness of its architecture, it was second to none in the Yong Ying Immortal Domain.</p><p>Even though Water Ying Immortal City was only a low grade immortal city, the castellan, Wen Hou, was still qualified to stay in the Ying Valley Immortal Resthouse.</p><p>Presently within a room on the fourth level of the Ying Valley Immortal Resthouse, Wen Lianxi stood in the centre with her head lowered and hands by the side. There were 4 people seated on top and other than Water Ying Immortal City’s castellan, Wen Hou, there was also Tier 4 Pill King Tan Liang who was supposed to help the Water Ying Immortal City in this alchemy competition.</p><p>Even though Tan Liang was only a Tier 4 Pill King, he was the representative of the highest alchemy standard for Water Ying Immortal City.</p><p>One of the other two people seated was a man wearing a crown who was expressionless as if he didn’t bother about anything. The last person had an air of arrogance around him as he looked at Wen Lianxi loftily. Even Wen Lianxi’s mother could only sit somewhere further away from them.</p><p>\"Lianxi, hurry up and greet the two Pill Kings from the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, Pill King Geng Ji and Pill King Di Baisheng,\" The moment Wen Lianxi entered the room, Wen Hou hurried to remind her.</p><p>Wen Lianxi bowed obediently, \"Wen Lianxi greets Pill King Geng Ji and Pill King Di Baisheng.\"</p><p>Geng Ji didn’t react as he appeared as though he didn’t hear Wen Lianxi’s greetings while Di Baisheng simply maintained his proud face before nodding at her.</p><p>Wen Hou said in a hurry, \"Lianxi, quickly take out the jade token for the alchemy competition. Pill King Geng Ji and Pill King Di Baisheng are both Tier 5 Pill Kings of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance and it is truly our Water Ying Immortal CIty’s blessing that both of them are willing to represent us in this competition…\"</p><p>\"How about Uncle Tan?\" Wen Lianxi was shocked as she temporarily forgot that she couldn’t take out the jade token and was worried for Tan Liang instead.</p><p>Tan Liang had been giving his all for the Water Ying Immortal City and kicking Uncle Tan Liang out immediately after someone slightly more capable wanted to participate in the competition seemed a little too absurd right?</p><p>Tan Liang heard that Wen Lianxi was concerned about him so he hurried to laugh it off, \"Lianxi, don’t have to worry about me. I am happy now that we have Pill Kings from the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance to help represent our Water Ying Immortal City.\"</p><p>Wen Hou nodded, \"Lianxi, you don’t have to worry about all these so just pass me the jade token for the competition.\"</p><p>\"Father, I am sorry but I cannot get the jade token back anymore…\"</p><p>When Wen Hou heard this, his face turned solemn because he passed a jade token to his daughter, a daughter he adored so much and a daughter who knew it was impossible to find a better participant than Tan Liang. If even Tan Liang couldn’t get into the top 50, why would any random pill refiner that Wen Lianxi found be able to do so?</p><p>Now that the Water Ying Immortal City had some glimpses of hope, how could he allow his daughter to give the precious jade token away so casually? Furthermore, how could he offend these two people beside him?</p><p>\"Lianxi, you have to be understanding and quickly hand the jade token over,\" Even Wen Lianxi’s mother, Yan Qianling couldn’t help but to comment.</p><p>Wen Lianxi lifted her head and said sincerely, \"Father and mother, I am truly unable to get the jade token back because I’ve met a pill refiner who said he will represent my Water Ying Immortal City in this competition so I gave him the jade token. When we parted, I forgot to ask him for a communication bead so even I have no idea where he is now.\"</p><p>After Wen Lianxi said this, the few people in the room exchanged glances.</p><p>The nonchalant Geng Ji finally opened his eyes widely as all he did was grunt with a face of unhappiness, \"Since the Water Ying Immortal City has someone so capable to participate in this competition, you shouldn’t need us anymore. We shall make our move first.\"</p><p>Immediately after he said this, Geng Ji stood up and soon after, Di Baisheng followed suit.</p><p>\"These two Pill Kings please hold on because I will definitely find the jade token and send it directly to both your hands,\" Wen Hou stood up anxiously as he said this.</p><p>\"Since this is the case, find us after Castellan Wen had found the jade token,\" Immediately after this, Geng Ji and Di Baisheng no longer cared about Wen Hou as they simply left their seats and left the room.</p><p>\"Lianxi, you are in huge trouble,\" After the two Pill Kings left, Yan Qianling sighed. She couldn’t understand why her obedient daughter would ever make such an absurd move.</p><p>\"Father and mother, since the Yong Ying Immortal Domain Grand Alchemy Competition loosened up with the rules, even Pill King Geng and Pill King Di might not be able to…\"</p><p>Wen Lianxi was kind in nature so she didn’t say that they would not be able to earn the slots even if they were to enter and represent us.</p><p>Wen Hou’s face was still serious as he didn’t bother about Wen Lianxi.</p><p>Yan Qianling sighed once more before saying, \"Lianxi, do you know how serious the consequences would be now that we have rejected the help of two Pill Kings from the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance? Ai…\"</p><p>Wen Lianxi’s heart turned heavy as she had forgotten that those two were from the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance. Even the Yong Ying Immortal Domain’s Sky Lord had to be respectful to the Pill Kings from the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance. Now that she mentioned she no longer had a pill token with her, they must be thinking that the Water Ying Immortal City was messing with them.</p><p>The Water Ying Immortal City was already filled with troubles but now, she had offended two more important figures.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
