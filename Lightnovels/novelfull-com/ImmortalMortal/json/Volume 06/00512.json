Furthermore, from Mo Wuji’s judgement, her cultivation level should be in the advanced Xuan Immortal Stage. With a body full of immortal aura, she was actually much stronger than the Hong Qi who he killed previously. Despite having advanced into the intermediate stage of the Golden Immortal Stage, Mo Wuji predicted that he wouldn’t have a high chance of winning her if they were to fight head on. However, if he was in the advanced Golden Immortal Stage or the peak of the Golden Immortal Stage, he was confident that he would be able to deal with her.</p><p>The yellow dressed woman walked over to Mo Wuji and bowed slightly before revealing a slight smile, \"Little girl’s name is Shen Muqing and I am a disciple of the Floating Flower Immortal Valley from the Luo Ling Immortal Domain. I’ve noticed the extraordinary deportment of Brother Yan so I wanted to make friends with you. I’m sorry to disturb you so abruptly so I seek Brother Yan’s forgiveness.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji stared at Shen Muqing with his eyes wide opened and replied only after staring blankly for a few moments, \"Fairy Shen, are you sure you didn’t make a mistake? I appear extraordinary to you? I am merely an ordinary cultivator with ordinary spiritual roots who just made it into the Golden Immortal Stage so how extraordinary can I look? Fairy Shen was walking together with a bunch of geniuses so I guessed that you must be a star genius as well too. Could it be that you came to make a fool of me, a person who had just been embarrassed for accepting a divorce on the streets?\"</p><p>This time, Mo Wuji wasn’t over thinking as he really did have his suspicions. Why would a delicate, pretty and star grade talent like Shen Muqing want to make friends with an ordinary person on the streets like Mo Wuji? Moreover, she addressed herself as ‘little girl’ which was even more ridiculous. It would make sense if Shen Muqing knew that he was an honorary Tier 4 Pill King but Mo Wuji was certain that she wasn’t aware of that.</p><p>To put it in a sentence, Shen Muqing was wealthy, talented and beautiful while he was only a random loser.</p><p>Shen Muqing maintained her demure smile before saying, \"I do admire Brother Yan sincerely. If Brother Yan doesn’t mind, would you like to have a cup of tea with me at the tea house nearby?\"</p><p>Is she asking me out? Mo Wuji thought to himself. He had no clue what Shen Muqing’s motives were but he would rather fewer troubles if possible. Furthermore, he had something more important on hand; which was to get Dou Hualong find out more about the incident involving the purple gourd.</p><p>\"I am sorry, I was dumped and so I am feeling extremely dejected at the moment. I would like to head back to rest. After I get over this, it would be my extreme honour to be invited by Fairy Shen,\" Mo Wuji clasped his fists and said.</p><p>A trace of disappointment flashed across Shen Muqing’s eyes as she continued to maintain her smile, \"Since this is the case, I shall not disturb Brother Yan anymore. Could you tell me where you are currently staying?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji knew that even if he chose not to tell her, she would be able to find out easily. Therefore, he casually replied \"I am staying at the Riverface Immortal Resthouse. Goodbye, Fairy Shen.\"</p><p>After he answered her, Mo Wuji turned and left while Dou Hualong followed closely behind Mo Wuji. If it was in the past, Dou Hualong would definitely be curious as to why his big brother rejected Shen Muqing but he understood his big brother’s intentions now.</p><p>His big brother was not only an honorary Tier 4 Pill King but also an elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance so why would a small fry like Shen Muqing mean anything to Mo Wuji?</p><p>As she watched Mo Wuji’s back view, Shen Muqing revealed a faint smile as she shook her head, \"Actually, I believe you said something wrong. Murong Xiangyu was actually very suitable for the Supreme Dao Sect’s cultivation technique.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji suddenly thought of something as he appeared to have realise why Shen Muqing wanted to find him. Perhaps she really only wanted to make friends with him and nothing else.</p><p>Even though Mo Wuji’s guess was not completely accurate, it was pretty close to the truth. Other bystanders might think that Mo Wuji was merely a poor bug who just got dumped and even he told her how pitiful he felt. However, Shen Muqing was certain that the Yan Ye in front of her wasn’t feeling like that. When Murong Xiangyu took out her certificate of marriage to divorce, Yan Ye didn’t even have any emotion so how could he be feeling so dejected so shortly after?</p><p>Yan Ye looked like a mess but in front of so many geniuses and even the peak grade expert like Gu Zijian who was wooing Murong Xiangyu, he didn’t even reveal any feelings of inferiority. Even after being dumped by Murong Xiangyu, Yan Ye could still warn her that she wasn’t suitable for the Supreme Dao Sect’s cultivation technique. This was definitely not something someone who truly loved Murong Xiangyu could pull off.</p><p>This was not the only factor as Yan Ye looked extremely ordinary and didn’t have any spirituality around him so he should be a mediocrity. She had this unique ability which was that she could roughly sense the other party’s age. Even though she wasn’t able to tell Yan Ye’s specific age, she could sense that Yan Ye was younger than her and in fact, way younger than her. For a cultivator way younger than her to cultivate to the Golden Immortal Stage? How could he be mediocre?</p><p>More importantly, this cultivator looked extremely ordinary and he didn’t have a tinge of spirituality around him which made him extraordinary.</p><p>Her main reason for coming out would be for the opening of Level 3 of the Broken World as well as to cultivate, broaden her horizons and make friends with outstanding heroes from all across the world. Before she left, her master told her that reading 10,000 books would not be more beneficial than traveling 10,000 miles. One must neither look down on anyone nor self-deprecate yourself in front of someone.</p><p>Other than cultivating to become stronger, help from others was equally important. If she were to make friends with one more capable man, she would have one more source of help in the future.</p><p>Since her intention was to make friends with outstanding figures, how could she miss out on someone like Mo Wuji? Furthermore, so what if she misjudged him? Based on the fact that he could speak so calmly in front of so many geniuses, he was a person worth befriending.</p><p>…</p><p>The moment they returned to their residence, Mo Wuji handed Dou Hualong a storage ring, \"Hualong, I will be undergoing closed doors cultivation for a period of time. This storage ring and the items inside are for you to cultivate and when you’re taking a break from cultivating, help me find out more about the battle between the Yong Ying Immortal Domain’s Heavenly Emperor and the Devil Moon Immortal School’s Heavenly Emperor. Also, help me find out more about the purple gourd as well as the opening of the Level 3 of the Broken World.\"</p><p>\"Roger that, big brother,\" Dou Hualong took over the storage ring excitedly.</p><p>After Mo Wuji entered his room for his closed door cultivation, his spiritual will had already seeped into the storage ring. He was so excited at the sight of the items in the storage ring that he shivered. There were over 1,000,000 low grade immortal crystals and hundreds of thousand intermediate grade immortal crystals, over 20,000 high grade immortal crystals and even all sorts of pills. The item that made him the most excited was the Falling Dust Immortal Pill, an item which was the dream treasure of every Heavenly Immortal cultivator.</p><p>As for some Grade 3 Immortal equipment and Grade 2 flying magic treasure that he saw, he was simply dumbfounded momentarily.</p><p>It was indeed a dream to have a big brother who was a pill king, otherwise, how could he, Dou Hualong, live such luxurious life? He was simply like a mouse dropping into a pile of rice. No, he, Dou Hualong, would be a dragon-like expert in the future so how could he compare himself to a mouse?</p><p>He must work hard to accomplish the tasks his big brother assigned him.</p><p>…</p><p>Mo Wuji’s own cultivation required a tremendously large amount of resources but he had to treat others right so he didn’t ill-treat Dou Hualong and gave a huge chunk of his cultivation resources to him as well. Furthermore, he was a pill king and an elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance. If he was lacking, he should be lacking of heavenly treasures and not these low grades immortal crystals and pills.</p><p>As he returned to his own room, Mo Wuji took out the storage ring Nong Yong gave. This was a reward from the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Headquarters so Mo Wuji predicted that it shouldn’t be too shabby.</p><p>Since this was a reward, the restrictions on the storage ring were extremely simple to lift. After he lifted the restrictions, Mo Wuji only saw 200 Tier 5 immortal herbs.</p><p>Mo Wuji was a little astonished because wasn’t this a little petty? 200 Tier 5 immortal herbs were even lesser than part of the rewards given by the Sharphorn Immortal Ruins Branch. To an ordinary cultivator, 200 Tier 5 immortal herbs might be a fortune but it was simply nothing to Mo Wuji.</p><p>Just as Mo Wuji was about to feel disappointed, he saw something like flying shuttle which was about an inch long. The flying shuttle was blurry gray in colour so it blended in with the space of the storage ring and if one didn’t look closely, one wouldn’t be able to tell that it was there.</p><p>Mo Wuji lifted his hand and grabbed the flying shuttle in his hands and a faint immortal spirituality that appeared as though it was going to escape circulated around the space in the storage ring.</p><p>Mo Wuji seeped his spiritual will into this flying shuttle and he almost cried out in surprise. This was actually a Grade 7 flying immortal treasure.</p><p>A Grade 7 immortal flying treasure was something treasured even by an Immortal King, let alone a Golden Immortal Stage cultivator like himself.</p><p>Flying treasures and defensive treasures were naturally worth more than an offensive magic treasure so a Grade 7 immortal flying treasure would definitely be something everyone coveted for.</p><p>If he had a Grade 7 immortal flying ship back when he was in the Half Immortal Domain, he wouldn’t think of completing his Immortal-Traversing Ship.</p><p>Very soon, he figured out the intentions of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance. It was to protect him. By giving him Tier 5 immortal herbs, they wished that he would be able to advance to become a Tier 5 Pill King and the flying shuttle was for him to escape in times of danger.</p><p>It seemed like it was the right decision to join the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance because just this Grade 7 immortal flying treasure made it worth it.</p><p>Mo Wuji took out the storage ring Shang Yu gave once more and there was indeed an identity token of an elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance in the Sharphorn Immortal Ruins Branch. Other than this, there was also a pile of Tier 5 immortal herbs and tens of Tier 6 immortal herbs.</p><p>The most item that appealed to Mo Wuji the most was the ancient book. The moment Mo Wuji flipped opened the ancient book, he had even more admiration for Shang Yu. This second president definitely sent what he was lacking over to him.</p><p>This was a book to describe pill formulas and after briefly going through this ancient book, Mo Wuji noticed that there were about over a thousand pill formulas ranging from Tier 1 to Tier 7 immortal pills. Even though some pill formulas like the Zhi Desolate Pill and etc was missing, almost every commonly seen pill formulas were in this book.</p><p>After giving him so many valuable items and even let him choose three items from the treasury, it seemed like Mo Wuji had no reasons to reject whatever requests Shang Yu threw at him in the future. Regardless, he owed Shang Yu a huge favour.</p><p>After packing up the things into his storage ring, the first thing Mo Wuji did was to refine the flying shuttle. If he didn’t refine his flying shuttle, he wouldn’t have the mood to concoct the Tier 5 immortal pills.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
