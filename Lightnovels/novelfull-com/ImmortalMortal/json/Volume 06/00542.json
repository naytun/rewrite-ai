When Mo Wuji called for her, she hurried to bow and then said, \"Pill Master Mo, please don’t address me as Senior Sister. If you still respect me, Pill Master Mo can address me directly as Lianxi.\"</p><p>\"Alright Lianxi, please take a seat,\" Mo Wuji didn’t mind because in terms of cultivation, he was still slightly higher than Wen Lianxi. In terms of status, he was not too far off to address her as Lianxi.</p><p>Only upon hearing this, Wen Lianxi sat down cautiously before saying, \"Pill Master Mo, I was blind to have thought of you as a cheater back then.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji hesitated for a while before saying, \"Actually, you were not wrong because I did lie to you back then.\"</p><p>\"Ah…\" Wen Lianxi looked surprisingly at Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji explained helplessly, \"Back then, I was a peak grade Tier 3 Pill Monarch and could also be considered to be a low grade Pill King. However, I claimed to be a Tier 9 Heavenly Pill Master which was a lie.\"</p><p>Only Mo Wuji was aware that his statement of his was the lie and his claim back then held more truth. However, he had no choice but to lie because there would be problems if he didn’t lie and then went on to display the skills of a Pill King in the Yong Ying Immortal Domain Grand Alchemy Competition.</p><p>If he were to mention that he was a Tier 3 Pill Monarch previously, it wouldn’t be too much of a surprise for him to have became a Pill King now.</p><p>\"I know, I know and I have truly let Pill Master Mo down. Back then, I…\" Wen Lianxi spoke and was about to stand up.</p><p>Mo Wuji used his hand to prevent Wen Lianxi from standing up before smiling, \"We shall let bygones be bygones and if it wasn’t for your life-saving grace, I wouldn’t even be sitting in front of you now. This was the main reason why I didn’t put that incident to heart so you don’t have to worry about it.\"</p><p>One look at Wen Lianxi’s expression and he knew that Wen Lianxi was apologetic about poisoning him back then. However, Mo Wuji really didn’t mind the fact that she placed a poison in him not because she wanted to harm him but because she didn’t know him. Anyone else, including himself, would have done the same. Moreover, Wen Lianxi did take the initiative to hand him the antidote because if he didn’t receive the antidote, he wouldn’t bother sitting in front of her now.</p><p>It was solely because of the antidote which made Mo Wuji extremely grateful for Wen Lianxi. Back then, he still wasn’t fully aware of the uses of the elemental storage channel so without Wen Lianxi, he wouldn’t have any idea on recovering his cultivation. In a place like the Corner of Yong Ying, if he didn’t have any strength, he would be killed by others easily.</p><p>Furthermore, if it wasn’t for Wen Lianxi, he would never have gotten the Grass, Wood, Stone. One must know that the Grass, Wood, Stone was of massive help to Mo Wuji and it was one of the main reason why he could advance so quickly to become a Pill King. Of course, the other main reason would be his own extraordinary Pill Dao.</p><p>There were far too many people in this world who only remember the bad of people. Even if someone were to treat one well for the entire life, as long as one did something unsatisfactory, the same person would remember it for life. As for the good, one would completely forget it immediately.</p><p>Back on earth, Mo Wuji watched an interview before. It was about a young girl who left house after being reprimanded by her mother. When she was starving and freezing on her own outside, a kind hearted uncle gave her a bowl of noodles to eat. After that, she was extremely grateful and believed that this uncle treated her better than her parents and even wanted to acknowledge this uncle as his father.</p><p>At this moment, she forgot how she came to this world and who fed her through her growing years.</p><p>This was a bad habit deeply rooted in a human’s heart but Mo Wuji was definitely not someone like that. He would never forget Wen Lianxi’s kind acts over some unimportant matters. Because of this gratitude, he would completely forget all the other unimportant matters which made him different from the rest.</p><p>\"You knew back then that I placed poison in you?\" Even though she knew the answer, Wen Lianxi still sounded it out.</p><p>Mo Wuji chuckled, \"Back then, I was afterall a pill master who was close to being a pill king but what made me glad was the fact that you brought me the antidote eventually.\"</p><p>At this moment, if there was a gap on the ground, Wen Lianxi would force herself through it to avoid the embarrassment. She wasn’t restrained by Mo Wuji’s act of stopping her as she stood up and bowed, \"Thank you Big Brother Mo for your magnanimity to forgive a clueless person like me.\"</p><p>Wen Lianxi understood Mo Wuji’s words which meant to say that even if she didn’t hand him the antidote, the poison wouldn’t have affected Mo Wuji. Mo Wuji said that he was grateful that she handed him the antidote but it wasn’t true gratitude but a confirmation of her character. Otherwise, she wouldn’t be qualified to be talking to him like she was now.</p><p>After she finished, Wen Lianxi continued, \"The reason why I came here today is because I wish to ask Big Brother Mo for your help.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji nodded, \"Say it, as long as it is within my means, I will go all out to help you.\"</p><p>Wen Lianxi sat back down and even though she was slightly embarrassed to say it, for her father and for Water Ying Immortal City, she had no other choice, \"Big Brother Mo, are you aware of the upcoming Grand Alchemy Competition held by the Yong Ying Immortal Domain?\"</p><p>\"Yes I am aware,\" Mo Wuji was definitely aware because this was also the reason why he was here and even if Wen Lianxi didn’t ask, he would ask her about it.</p><p>Wen Lianxi didn’t find it surprising because to her, Mo Wuji might have already become a Pill King now and his trip here would definitely be for the Yunxian Immortal Valley.</p><p>\"Actually, other than the Yunxian Immortal Valley was another important reason for the Grand Alchemy Competition,\" Wen Lianxi continued.</p><p>\"What reason?\" Mo Wuji asked.</p><p>Wen Lianxi regained her composure before saying in a gentle tone, \"Because after this competition, a few lower grade immortal cities of the Yong Ying Immortal Domain would turn into subsidiary cities of other cities and lose its sovereignty. If they performed well, the lower grade immortal cities could advance to become a intermediate or even top grade immortal cities.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji inquire curiously, \"What does that mean? I know there are three grades of immortal cities but I have never heard of subsidiary cities.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji wasn’t completely clueless as to the grades of immortal cities. In the Yong Ying Immortal Domain, the Yong Ying Immortal City was considered to be a first class immortal city, a Heavenly Emperor’s immortal city. Following which would be high grade immortal city, intermediate grade immortal city and low grade immortal city. The best high grade immortal city could even be as strong as a Heavenly Emperor’s immortal city. For example, young castellan Zuo Yixian came from the Sea Canopy Immortal City and it was of similar status as this Yong Ying Immortal City.</p><p>Wen Lianxi knew that Mo Wuji should have just arrived from the Corner of Yong Ying so he wouldn’t know too much about all these hence, she wasn’t too surprised. She simply explained, \"Subsidiary immortal cities are intermediate or high grade immortal cities’ vassals and the castellan of these subsidiary cities would listen to every order of the intermediate or high grade immortal cities. Normally, the castellan of the subsidiary cities would be killed and every output produced from the subsidiary cities would belong to someone else but themselves.</p><p>My father is the castellan of the Water Ying Immortal City and if my Water Ying Immortal City were to turn into a subsidiary city, my family would have no escape route. Even my mother and I would have to be attached to someone else and my father would most probably be killed. Therefore, I would like to request Big Brother Mo to represent my Water Ying Immortal City in the competition this time round and save my entire clan.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji finally understood why Wen Lianxi was so anxious when she first saw him. Mo Wuji had originally intended to look for a powerhouse to represent so that he could participate in the Grand Alchemy Competition. This would be the perfect opportunity for him to help Wen Lianxi.</p><p>As he noticed how nervous Wen Lianxi was as she grabbed onto her dress tightly, Mo Wuji chuckled, \"I was still wondering what could it be. I was intending to participate in the competition and since this is the case, bring me to meet your father.\"</p><p>Hearing Mo Wuji’s words, Wen Lianxi handed a jade token to Mo Wuji excitedly, \"There is no need to meet my father. My Water Ying Immortal City has two slots for the competition and my father gave me one which made me free to choose anyone.</p><p>Wen Lianxi had no other choice which was why she was at the Yong Ying Immortal City’s Celebrity Immortal Conference. The conference would gather a few more notable and reputable young cultivators which she hoped to find someone capable. Eventually, she heard news of Mo Wuji was why she hurried over.</p><p>Mo Wuji took over the jade token and comforted her, \"I have accepted your request so do not worry. Oh yes, are there any restrictions for the Yong Ying Immortal Domain Grand Alchemy Competition?\"</p><p>\"There are only the age and domains restriction. The first condition would be that one must come from the Yong Ying Immortal Domain and the second condition would be that one must not be older than 500 years old. In the competition this time round, one must aim for the top 50,\" The rock in Wen Lianxi’s heart was finally removed as she saw Mo Wuji accepting the token. Mo Wuji was someone who Pill King Lian Tan admired so he mustn’t be too poor.</p><p>Mo Wuji pondered for a while before saying, \"Previously, I’ve done something in the Corner of Yong Ying so I wish to change my name to Mo Xinghe to represent the Water Ying Immortal City this time round.\"</p><p>Wen Lianxi hurried to say, \"I’m aware of all those incidents but those aren’t important right now. After the incident regarding the Lifeless River, nobody bothered about the incident at the Corner of Yong Ying. Even though someone complained to the Heavenly Emperor, the Heavenly Emperor didn’t have any reaction too. Furthermore, the people you killed back then were some unimportant people so naturally, nobody paid too much attention to it.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji knew that Wen Lianxi was a little too simplistic as he was friends with Zuo Yixian and Cang Heng, he knew that the incident involving the Corner of Yong Ying and the Yong Ying Prison was not that simple. Even if the Half Immortal Domain collapsed and the Corner of Yong Ying wasn’t given as much attention as the past, he would still invite a lot of unnecessary troubles the moment he was found out.</p><p>However, Mo Wuji wasn’t fearful of that because he came to participate in this Grand Alchemy Competition with something to depend on. Given his status as an Honoured Grade Elder at the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, nobody would dare to touch him even if they knew he came from the Half Immortal Domain. He wanted to change his name only because he really didn’t want too much troubles.</p><p>After finding a slot for himself to participate in the competition, Mo Wuji’s spirits was lifted as he stood up, \"Since this is the case, I will head back to rest first and when the competition starts, I will definitely not waste any time.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji was desperate to find a place to refine his Book of Luo. There was still about half a year before the competition begins so it would be a waste if he didn’t make full use of this spare time.</p><p>Wen Lianxi stood up together with Mo Wuji and she was also feeling much better than when she first arrived. Before she had a chance to bid goodbye to Mo Wuji, her communication bracelet lit up. Just as Wen Lianxi’s spiritual will landed on the bracelet, her face turned pale instantly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
