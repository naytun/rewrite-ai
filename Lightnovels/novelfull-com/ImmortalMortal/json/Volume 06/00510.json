These are the rewards given by the Sharphorn Immortal Branch as well as the identity token of Elder Mo as an elder in the branch.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t check on the storage ring here as he kept it immediately before expressing his gratitude.</p><p>\"Elder Mo is being too courteous. Now that the treasury is open, Elder Mo can pick three treasures for yourself,\" The delicate woman extended her arm and said respectfully.</p><p>Gong Yi, who was standing by the side, knew that he had completed his task so he hurried to bid his goodbye and left.</p><p>The woman stood outside the treasury while Mo Wuji nodded at her before entering the treasury.</p><p>The Pill Dao Immortal Alliance’s treasury in the Sharphorn Immortal Branch was not considered big but the treasures inside were definitely valuable. The moment Mo Wuji stepped inside, he could feel all sorts of immortal aura as there were not only high tier immortal herbs, a variety of treasured ores and even some technique jade letters.</p><p>Mo Wuji had no intentions to choose any of the magic treasures, immortal herbs or even immortal pills because firstly, he had his Half Moon Halberd. Even though it was incomplete, he would fix it eventually. Secondly, he was a pill refiner himself so why would he choose any immortal pills? Lastly, immortal herbs could be found so if he had to choose something now, he would choose something more practical than immortal herbs.</p><p>Before Mo Wuji could circle this treasury once, he grabbed a transparent rock. This was the Supreme Nirvana Fire Essence which Mo Wuji fought so hard for at the auction place of the Jing Yun City Square. It was also the reason why Mo Wuji formed a feud with the Seven Smoke Sect of the Immortal World. The pity was that because the Supreme Nirvana Fire Essence didn’t help his Scholar’s Heart advanced to become an immortal flame. However, he would naturally not miss out on this rock now that he had seen it here.</p><p>With this extra Supreme Nirvana Fire Essence, Mo Wuji was absolutely sure that his flame could advance to become an immortal flame. Even if he couldn’t get anything else, it would still be a worthwhile trip if his flame advanced into an immortal flame.</p><p>Just as he picked up the Supreme Nirvana Fire Essence, Mo Wuji saw a simple and crude, dark grey coloured saber which was as wide as a person’s back. There was actually a sort of killing intent and doughtiness within this saber that was similar to his Half Moon Halberd.</p><p>This saber was definitely a good item with experience. Mo Wuji had his Half Moon Halberd but the pity was that it was still not complete. Moreover, with his new status as an elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, he had intended to find out more about the situation of the Broken World which he couldn’t manage to do so previously. As compared to those geniuses, his status could be even higher than theirs.</p><p>Geniuses were only cultivators with the potential to be great and if they were to die or encounter any setbacks, they would no longer be geniuses. Mo Wuji’s status as an elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance was as genuine as it could ever get.</p><p>If he wanted the capabilities to enter the third level of the Broken World, he needed a better immortal equipment and this saber was fitting.</p><p>At the thought of this, Mo Wuji picked up this grey coloured saber. An intense killing intent surged towards Mo Wuji and he knew that the only reason it contained this much killing intent was that it had killed countless of experts.</p><p>Regardless, Mo Wuji was resolute in getting this saber.</p><p>Mo Wuji just entered this treasury not too long ago and he had already chosen two items. He didn’t rush to pick the third but scanned through the entire treasury once before picking up a chopping board with a radius of one inch. This chopping board might look like an imitation but it was actually a Grade 5 immortal equipment.</p><p>The reason why Mo Wuji chose this chopping board was not only because it was a Grade 5 immortal equipment but because it was capable of attacking as well as defending. Mo Wuji really wanted a technique to strengthen his body but was unable to find one. Therefore, if he couldn’t find a technique like this, he would need a better defensive immortal equipment and this chopping board was his choice.</p><p>Even though there were still many items that Mo Wuji wanted, he had already chosen three items as he walked out of the treasury with some regrets.</p><p>This time, he arrived at the big hall on level 1 and Dou Hualong was still waiting for him even after a few days. The moment Mo Wuji came out, Dou Hualong welcomed him with a look of surprise, \"Big brother, how was your assessment?\"</p><p>From Dou Hualong’s judgement, Mo Wuji should be a Tier 1 Pill Monarch since he had spent three days inside.</p><p>Mo Wuji chuckled as he took out his Honoured Grade Tier 4 Pill King’s token, \"Hualong, it seems like we wouldn’t be rushing to leave the Sharphorn Immortal Ruins anytime soon.\"</p><p>Previously, Mo Wuji wanted to leave the Sharphorn Immortal Ruins in a hurry because he didn’t have any protection. Now that he was an honorary Tier 4 Pill King, no one would dare to touch him even if he opened a pill house here in the Sharphorn Immortal Ruins.</p><p>Dou Hualong received the purple token and couldn’t start trembling the moment he saw the words on it, \"Big brother, you are a Tier 4 Pill King and an honorary one… Is this for real?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji kept his Pill King identity token and patted Dou Hualong’s shoulder, \"It is as real as real gold. In fact, I am even a reputable elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance.\"</p><p>Hearing Mo Wuji’s words, Dou Hualong was even more thrilled than Mo Wuji. He couldn’t believe that a random brother he decided to follow actually had such unbelievable talents. Back then, he only followed Mo Wuji because he felt that Mo Wuji was generous and treated him equally and that he had a chance to leave the Sharphorn Immortal Ruins someday.</p><p>Never in his dreams would he expect that Mo Wuji would be an honored grade Tier 4 Pill King. In normal circumstances, even a Grand Yi Immortal would be submissive in front of an honorary Tier 4 Pill King. He, Dou Hualong, must have been a saint in his previous life to find a backer as unbelievable as Mo Wuji. Big brother was right, even if Dou Hualong didn’t leave the Sharphorn Immortal Ruins in the future, he would still be able to enjoy a life of a rich here.</p><p>\"Elder Mo, if you don’t want to stay in a hotel, the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance could provide a residence for you. I can arrange everything meticulously for you,\" A voice suddenly interrupted Dou Hualong’s obscenity.</p><p>Mo Wuji replied politely, \"Many thanks, Deacon Gong. I’m currently staying at the Riverface Immortal Resthouse as for accommodations…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji sighed for a moment before saying, \"It would be ideal if Deacon Gong is able to find a small gatehouse in the Sharphorn Immortal Ruins for me.\"</p><p>\"Elder Mo wishes to open a pill house?\" Gong Yi understood Mo Wuji’s intentions immediately.</p><p>Mo Wuji nodded, \"Yes. Of course, it is okay if you’re unable to find one.\"</p><p>\"Wuji, you should find me for things like this. You are not treating me like your sister if you choose not to find me for this. Don’t worry, I promise to find a small gatehouse for you,\" Guo Qi walked over smiling.</p><p>Gong Yi hurried to pay his respects as he prepared to leave.</p><p>Guo Qi called out for Gong Yi, \"Deacon Gong, you are a capable person. After I found a shophouse for Wuji, help me settle the administrative affairs before handing it to Wuji.\"</p><p>\"Roger that. Many thanks, Manager Guo,\" Gong Yi couldn’t be any more elated.</p><p>Mo Wuji sighed at Guo Qi’s high level of interpersonal skills because she barely said a few sentences and she managed to pull Mo Wuji so much closer to her as if she had known him for years.</p><p>\"Thank you, sister Guo,\" Mo Wuji didn’t stand on any ceremony because since he had decided to join the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, he should work on his relationships with the many elders and important figures here too. Even if Guo Qi didn’t find him, he would take the initiative to visit her as well as the number 1 Pill King.</p><p>\"There’s no need to be so courteous to me. When the time comes, Deacon Gong will hand things over to you properly so don’t worry and rest well,\" After finishing her sentence, Guo Qi brought Mo Wuji out of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Branch’s hall politely.</p><p>…</p><p>\"Big brother, I feel like I am still dreaming,\" After being some distance away from the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, Dou Hualong was still in disbelief.</p><p>Who was Guo Qi? She was a manager of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance of the Sharphorn Immortal Ruins and she actually walked Mo Wuji out of the hall so politely. And if she asked Mo Wuji to address her as a sister, didn’t it mean that Mo Wuji was the brother of the manager of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance?</p><p>\"This is nothing. Once you have sufficient resources for cultivation, you would be on the same level as them too,\" Mo Wuji comforted Gong Yi.</p><p>Other than wanting to accumulate some cultivation resources, the reason why he wanted to set up a pill house was so that he could build a platform to rebuild his Tian Ji Sect, which he had promised to do so.</p><p>\"Roger, big brother,\" Dou Hualong had absolute faith in Mo Wuji.</p><p>\"Oh yes, something big happened during the three days you were assessing yourself,\" Dou Hualong held the task Mo Wuji assigned him close to heart and didn’t stop collecting information even when he was in the hall of the Sharphorn Branch’s hall.</p><p>\"What happened?\" Mo Wuji asked.</p><p>Dou Hualong lowered his voice and answered, \"Two days ago, a Heavenly Emperor of the Yong Ying Immortal Domain had a massive battle with the number one expert Gu of the Devil Moon Immortal School in the Six Paths Immortal Domain. I’ve heard that the battle flipped the entire battlefield upside down and the killing intent could even be felt 10,000 miles away.\"</p><p>\"Gu?\" Mo Wuji asked curiously.</p><p>Dou Hualong nodded, \"Yes, the number one expert of the Devil Moon Immortal School was called Gu and I’ve heard that he was an Immortal Emperor expert. Even the Heavenly Emperor of the Devil Domain had to be respectful towards him.\"</p><p>\"So why was he fighting with the Heavenly Emperor of the Yong Ying Immortal Domain?\" Mo Wuji was still lost.</p><p>Dou Hualong chuckled and said, \"According to the information I received, it was because of the birth of a purple gourd which ignited the fight between the two Emperors.\"</p><p>\"The birth of a purple gourd?\" Mo Wuji panicked as he thought of the gourd lying in his Undying World. And there was even the Breath of Hongmeng. If the gourd was lying here, why would the two Emperors be fighting for?</p><p>Dou Hualong continued in his low voice, \"Rumours were that the purple gourd was an inheritance of the Lifeless Dao Sect and it was the sole reason why the Lifeless Dao Sect was exterminated many years ago. The gourd contained the Breath of Hongmeng, something every human being dreamt of possessing.\"</p><p>\"So who took that gourd?\" Mo Wuji was still shocked because he really couldn’t wrap his head around this. Could there be two gourds? Or could one of them be fake?</p><p>If it was a fake, it would definitely not incite a war between the Emperors.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
