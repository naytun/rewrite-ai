The Pill Dao Immortal Alliance was lacking young blood, now that Hu Zhenyu had spotted a future Pill Emperor, how could he simply let this talent go?</p><p>…</p><p>After another 20 to 30 names appeared, Mo Wuji's heart gradually settled down. He discovered that among those pill refiners whose names had already appeared, almost all of them had concocted Tier 6 pills, but their pill success rate was pitifully low.</p><p>On average, they were either intermediate or low grade pills. And there was no need to talk about a full batch, it was already rare for them to obtain a third of a full batch. A few refiners that tried to concoct the relatively hard Tied 6 pills practically only managed to get 2 to 3 low grade pills.</p><p>Mo Wuji soon understood the underlying reason. It wasn't due to the incapabilities of these pill refiners, but because of the fire.</p><p>The fire here was limiting their capabilities; they should originally able to concoct six pills, but because of the fire, they could only obtain 1 to 2 pills, and the quality of the pills was really lacking.</p><p>Mo Wuji secretly thought to himself that he had the greatest advantage in this competition. He wasn't picky about his flames; a better flame would cause his pill concoction to be faster and his quality to be better. But even with a bad flame, he could still successfully concoct the pill. Even though there was definitely an impact, it wasn't to the point of other pill refiners where he would fail his concoction.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not recognize any of the names on the screen; he was also not interested in knowing these people. He only hoped that his name was in the top 50; as long as his name was in the top 50, it meant that he had succeeded.</p><p>The display screen soon came to the 51st place: Participating Immortal City - Intermediate Grade City, Red Emperor Immortal City; Participating Pill Refiner - Fei Gao. Pill - Tier 6 Immortal Copious Pill. 8 pills - 4 high grade, 4 intermediate grade. Points: 71.315.</p><p>When Mo Wuji saw that he wasn't the 51st name, his heart completely settled down; he knew that he had definitely advanced into the top 50.</p><p>He was in the top 50 in both the first and second rounds, so he would definitely be in the overall top 50.</p><p>Mo Wuji knew this Fei Gao; this fella obtained 6th place in the first round. He never expected that this fella could be so good at purification, but his pill concoction would be so lacking. Don't just look at this fella's 6th place in the first round; because he didn't get into the top 50 in the second round, it was still uncertain whether he would eventually end up in the overall top 50.</p><p>In the first round, everyone's point difference was extremely small; the point difference between the 1st and 100th place was only a little more than 1 point.</p><p>It was exactly because of the tiny point gaps that Mo Wuji previously did not dare confirm that he would enter the top 50 even though he got 1st place in the first round.</p><p>Actually, with this sort of competition format, the top 50 in the second round would basically be the overall top 50.</p><p>At this instant, the 50th place also appeared: Participating Immortal City - High Grade City, Pu Luo Immortal City; Participating Pill Refiner - Wen Chengbu. Pill - Tier 6 Sword Qi Domain Splitting Pill. 6 pills - 5 high grade, 1 intermediate grade. Points: 73.521.</p><p>The moment this score appeared, Mo Wuji knew that the Fei Gao that obtained 6th place in the first round had been eliminated. This Wen Chengbu's first round score was still at the other display screen: 91.461. Even though he didn't get into the top 50 in the previous round, his total score still exceeded Fei Gao.</p><p>If even Wen Chengbu got more than 73 points, it would be harder for Fei Gao to get into the top 50.</p><p>Indeed, the 49th place had a score that was more than 75 points. When Fei Gao saw this score, he could only sigh in emotion and sat down dejectedly. He was only behind by a little bit, just a little bit more and he could have gotten into the top 50. However, this little bit was extremely hard to get.</p><p>Knowing that he had definitely gotten into the top 50, Mo Wuji didn't care any further. He also sat down and closed his eyes. At the same time, he was considering how he should leave Yong Ying Immortal Domain after he entered Yunxian Immortal Valley and obtained the Underworld Heart Flower.</p><p>…</p><p>When the 50th place came out and it still wasn't Mo Wuji's name, Water Ying’s Castellan Wen Hou could no longer hold it in as he stood up in excitement.</p><p>Ever since he became the castellan of Water Ying Immortal City, he never thought that there would be a day when Water Ying Immortal City would be promoted to an intermediate grade city. At this instant, Water Ying Immortal City's promotion was set in stone, they only needed to wait for all the results to be flashed.</p><p>\"Lord Husband…\" Yan Qianling tightly grabbed Wen Hou's hands, pulling him to sit down.</p><p>Only she could best understand her husband's heart; ever since the Yong Ying Grand Alchemy Competition began, Wen Hou's heart had been on tenterhooks. He was clearer than everyone else that if Water Ying Immortal City failed in the competition and got reduced to become a subsidiary city, their lives would be especially miserable.</p><p>Thus, ever since the announcement of the competition, he searched everywhere for pill refiners to compete for him. It was also because she wanted to ease her father's anxiety that Wen Lianxi went to the Corner of Yong Ying to search for pill refiners. Unfortunately, besides his old friend Tan Liang, his Water Ying Immortal City wasn't able to find any other suitable pill refiner.</p><p>As the saying goes: a watched flower never blooms; just when Wen Hou had given up hope, his daughter found him an extraordinary pill refiner. Not only did this pill refiner obtain 1st place in the first round, he even entered the top 50 in the second round.</p><p>With such results, would Water Ying Immortal City ever have to worry that they would become a subsidiary city? As the castellan of Water Ying Immortal City, Wen Hou was now thinking of the important matters to settle when Water Ying got promoted to the intermediate grade.</p><p>Wen Hou and his family weren't the only excited ones in the plaza. The other person that was incomparably excited was naturally Lin Gu.</p><p>The reason why Lin Gu asked Mo Wuji to help her was because she didn't know any better Pill King and because she knew that Mo Wuji was a Honored Grade Tier 4 Pill King.</p><p>Even before the second round ended, Lin Gu knew that she had made the right choice. In the first round, even Pill Emperors weren't a match for Mo Wuji. He was simply an existence that defied the logics of heaven. Perhaps, he might actually be able to treat her mother.</p><p>…</p><p>While Mo Wuji was nonchalant towards the results on the display screen, the other cultivators were staring at it eagerly. At this point, almost everyone wanted to know Mo Wuji's exact placing in the second round.</p><p>Mo Wuji concocted a Tier 5 pill in the second round. Even though he chose the Immortal Cleansing Grand Zhi Pill which was one of the most valuable and difficult pill to concoct in Tier 5, Tier 5 was nonetheless Tier 5, there was a definite qualitative difference with a Tier 6 pill. If a Tier 5 pill could obtain one of the better placings, then people actually began to suspect that Mo Wuji's results were not real.</p><p>The display screen quickly came to the 6th place: Participating Immortal City - High Grade City, Ping Yi Immortal City; Participating Pill Refiner - Liu Tiao. Pill - Tier 6 Huang Jade Pill. 11 pills - 10 high grade, 1 intermediate grade. Points: 87.762.</p><p>5th place: Participating Immortal City - Low Grade City, Water Ying Immortal City; Participating Pill Refiner - Mo Xinghe. Pill - Tier 5 Immortal Cleansing Grand Zhi Pill. Full batch of 12 pills - 12 unique grade. Points: 90.000.</p><p>When these results came out, the crowd began to discuss with further fervor. Now, no one thought that the results were fake. This was because the concocted pills were all here and it couldn't be faked. A few people in the know knew that when the second round results were fully released, the seals over the top 50 pills would be removed and everyone would be allowed to see them with their spiritual wills.</p><p>In the second round, the highest point a Tier 5 pill could get was 90 points. This meant that Mo Wuji's Immortal Cleansing Grand Zhi Pill managed to obtain all the points. How startling was that?</p><p>…</p><p>\"Congratulations old Brother Wen Hou. In the future, you will be also be a high grade immortal city like us. If you're free, do come to my Lu Yun Immortal City for a visit.\" The moment Mo Wuji's results came out, Lu Yun Immortal City's castellan took the initiative to greet Wen Hou.</p><p>Mo Wuji, this heaven defying talent actually had relations to Water Ying Immortal City. There was no need to talk about how Water Ying Immortal City was going to become a high grade city, even if Water Ying Immortal City wasn't a high grade city, he also would have come to form relations with Wen Hou and Mo Wuji.</p><p>After Lu Yun Immortal City, various other high and intermediate grade city castellans came to greet Wen Hou with smiles plastered on their faces. Their tones and attitudes were courteous to the max.</p><p>This was different from the previous round of greetings. Now that Mo Wuji was set to enter the top 5, these castellans were so warm that you would think they were old bosom friends of Wen Hou.</p><p>Even though Wen Hou was grinning the whole time, he was still feeling rather delirious. Since when did he get such treatment as the castellan of Water Ying Immortal City?</p><p>In the previous gatherings of castellans from the various immortal cities in Yong Ying Immortal Domain, he had the fortune of participating in two of them. Don't just see his status as a castellan of an immortal city; in that sort of gathering, he could only stay at one corner. Occasionally, some people would come to him and speak a few passing words, but most of the time, he was ignored. Now, many high grade city castellans had come to greet him, and intermediate and low grade city castellans came to praise him with a humble attitude.</p><p>As he awoke from his bliss and honor, Wen Hou became especially clear that none of this was earned by himself; all this prestige was brought to him by the unreasonably young pill refiner on the stage.</p><p>…</p><p>The display screen had already shown the 4th place: Participating Immortal City - High Grade City, Bai Ding Immortal City; Participating Pill Refiner - Kuang Zhiyao. Pill - Tier 6 Void Indigo Pill. Full batch of 12 pills - 1 unique grade, 9 high grade, 2 intermediate grade. Points: 91.549.</p><p>Void Indigo Pill was considered one of the hardest Tier 6 pills to concoct. It was already extremely impressive that Kuang Zhiyao was able to concoct a full batch of Void Indigo Pills. His score of 91.549 was very fair.</p><p>3rd place: Participating Immortal City - Intermediate Grade City, Saint Glass Immortal City; Participating Pill Refiner - Wu Yunsheng. Pill - Tier 6 Ice Soul Heaven Dust Pill. Full batch of 12 pills - 3 unique grade, 9 high grade. Points: 93.322.</p><p>2nd place: Participating Immortal City - High Grade City, Lu Jie Immortal City; Participating Pill Refiner - Heng Jun. Pill - Tier 6 Huang Jade Pill. Full batch of 12 pills - 9 unique grade, 3 high grade. Points: 95.413.</p><p>1st place: Participating Immortal City - High Grade City, Long Light Immortal City; Participating Pill Refiner - Gong Yangxue. Pill - Tier 6 Serpentine Soul Pill. Full batch of 12 pills - 6 unique grade, 6 high grade. Points: 97.339.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
