Rumours were that just before he made his escape, Gu managed to capture one of the Yong Ying Immortal Domain’s Heavenly Emperor’s concubine…\" Dou Hualong was so good at his job he even reported details of the rumours heard from the streets.</p><p>Just when Mo Wuji was about to continue questioning, a group of people who just arrived across the streets made Mo Wuji stopped. Out of the eight people who arrived, Mo Wuji recognised two of them. One of them was Yan Ye’s titular wife Murong Xiangyu and the one following closely behind Murong Xiangyu, Qiao Qianyan.</p><p>Presently, Qiao Qianyan was walking at the back while Murong Xiangyu was walking in front together with a stylish purple robed youth. The purple robed youth had a sharp face and a good built. Everyone was able to tell that he was a lightning type expert as his entire body was enveloped with rich lightning bolts. At this moment, he was smiling widely while having a great conversation with Murong Xiangyu which was similar to how Qiao Qianyan used to converse with Murong Xiangyu in the past.</p><p>\"Big brother, the purple robed youth walking in front is called Gu Zijian and he’s an unbelievable strong Eight Star Genius from the Lightning Sect of the Mahesvara Immortal Domain. If he didn’t need to go to the Broken World, he could have been in the advanced Grand Yi Stage already. These geniuses are approaching us, we should…\" Dou Hualong whispered cautiously into Mo Wuji’s ears.</p><p>Dou Hualong wanted to suggest that they shifted out of their way but as he spoke, he recalled that his big brother Mo Wuji was actually a reputable elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, a status even higher than a genius so there was simply no need for him to make way.</p><p>Mo Wuji saw Qiao Qianyan’s eyes constantly sweeping across Murong Xiangyu’s body and he couldn’t help but found it funny as Gu Zijian had replaced his position. He guessed that in Murong Xiangyu’s eyes now, the present Qiao Qianyan was the ‘Yan Ye’ following behind the previous Qiao Qianyan and herself.</p><p>Women of the Supreme Dao Sect were indeed heartless because any ordinary woman would try to salvage some pride of Qiao Qianyan in circumstances like this. Even if she didn’t intend to go on further with Qiao Qianyan, she should still occasionally talk to him so that he had a chance to walk in front with them.</p><p>Despite Dou Hualong not completing his sentence, Mo Wuji understood his meaning and patted his shoulder before saying, \"We will stand aside and let these geniuses walk past first.\"</p><p>His status as an elder was not for him to abuse and misuse just to bully some people. It was to protect himself. Mo Wuji was not so bored that he would be so calculative with these geniuses.</p><p>\"Yan Ye? What are you doing here?\" Murong Xiangyu had not completely fallen in love with another man and had yet to completely forget Yan Ye so when he saw Mo Wuji by the street, she stopped and furrowed her brows immediately.</p><p>Murong Xiangyu stopped in her tracks so Gu Zijian got everyone else to halt as they looked curiously at Murong Xiangyu and Yan Ye.</p><p>\"Xiangyu, who is this man?\" Gu Zijian asked Murong Xiangyu while staring at Mo Wuji.</p><p>Murong Xiangyu answered calmly, \"He is my titular husband.\"</p><p>\"Ah…\" Other than Qiao Qianyan, all the other geniuses heard Murong Xiangyu’s answer and looked shockingly at both Mo Wuji and Murong Xiangyu.</p><p>Mo Wuji’s face was full of scars and with one look, everyone could tell that his cultivation level was very low. Not considering all these, the main point was that Mo Wuji’s spirituality was not evident and everyone could tell that his potential was limited. Murong Xiangyu was not only a Six Star Genius she was also an extremely gorgeous woman. Why would such a delicate and outstanding woman have such an ugly and ordinary dao companion like Mo Wuji?</p><p>Everyone turned to look at Gu Zijian as they all knew Gu Zijian was wooing Murong Xiangyu presently. Moreover, Murong Xiangyu treated Gu Zijian decently and there was a high possibility that the two of them could become dao companions.</p><p>In fact, some of them didn’t understand why Murong Xiangyu didn’t conceal the fact about her relationship with Yan Ye. As long as she concealed it well and then settled the divorce with Mo Wuji in secret, she could still become Gu Zijian’s dao companion.</p><p>Gu Zijian’s expression turned ugly because he truly liked Murong Xiangyu. Murong Xiangyu was not only shockingly talented, he fell in love with her looks the moment his eyes fell on her.</p><p>More importantly, Murong Xiangyu wasn’t very clingy so even after they became dao companions, she wouldn’t affect his cultivation.</p><p>\"You have yet to answer my question,\" Murong Xiangyu furrowed her brows even more.</p><p>Mo Wuji really wanted to ask her to mind her own business but his identity was Yan Ye. Even if he wanted to expose his true identity, he wouldn’t want to explain to Murong Xiangyu in front of so many people. More importantly, he really wanted to tell Murong Xiangyu that he didn’t wish to continue playing this bullsh*t dao love game with her.</p><p>Murong Xiangyu sighed once more as she noticed that Mo Wuji still chose to remain silent. She recalled the countless talented experts that she had met over the past few days in the garden of the Sharphorn Immortal Ruins. Hearing their detailed explanations of the cultivation dao, she had realised how narrow her social circle was previously.</p><p>Even these people around her now, which one of them wasn’t a genius among geniuses? In fact, even Qiao Qianyan was way more impressive. As for the Yan Ye in front of her, she shook her head in disappointment. Perhaps Yan Ye would never understand any one of this dao reasoning of the cultivation dao.</p><p>Since she would have to make a decision sooner or later, there was no point in dragging any longer. If she had interacted with these geniuses even before she came to Sharphorn Immortal Ruins, she probably wouldn’t have brought Yan Ye along with her.</p><p>So what if she fell in love with Yan Ye eventually? She would not only harm herself but also Yan Ye. Yan Ye was too ordinary so perhaps she would never be able to fall in love with him completely.</p><p>She really shouldn’t be too stubborn because it wouldn’t do anyone good by delaying any further. Moreover, Yan Ye and her current social circle was simply two worlds apart.</p><p>She retrieved a red colour marriage certificate as she handed it to Mo Wuji, \"We shall end our relationship. This was the marriage certificate that we exchanged initially, pass me yours.\"</p><p>Exchanging of marriage certificates on the streets?</p><p>Mo Wuji looked surprisingly at Murong Xiangyu as he realised how the actions of the members of the Supreme Dao Sect couldn’t be explained by logic. More accurately, they had no ethical reasoning at all.</p><p>Mo Wuji took over the marriage certificate as he threw it into his storage ring without looking at it. After all, it wasn’t even his to begin with. Mo Wuji subconsciously glanced at the experts around Murong Xiangyu and thought that maybe these experts were the one who stimulated her decision.</p><p>Murong Xiangyu naturally noticed Mo Wuji’s glances and felt uncomfortable. Even though she would not admit, she knew that it was perhaps because of the gathering of these experts, she had made her decision before entering the Broken World.</p><p>She just came out of the Supreme Dao Sect so she would also wish to have an earth-shattering type of love so as to let her soul and heart undergo sublimation and eventually complete her dao heart.</p><p>\"I know how you feel but sometimes, we cannot make great demands for something like fate,\" Murong Xiangyu still felt a little apologetic because after all, Yan Ye came over with the sole purpose to purify her dao heart. Even though Yan Ye might die in the Broken World, he might get lucky and be met with some opportunities too. Who knew that even before they made their way to the Broken World, she had completely erased Yan Ye off her heart by ending the fate between them.</p><p>She really wanted to comfort Mo Wuji but she just didn’t know how to do it.</p><p>Mo Wuji waved his hand and said, \"Don’t worry, I’m fine. Congratulations on finally ending our fate… that…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji wanted to hand over Yan Ye’s certificate of marriage to Murong Xiangyu but just as his spiritual will landed within the storage ring, he realised that he didn’t have the certificate of marriage with him. He had already handed it to Yan Tianyu to pass it to Yan Clan’s Yan Yi.</p><p>Murong Xiangyu looked at Mo Wuji’s expression of unhappiness and she thought that Mo Wuji didn’t mean what he just said and he really didn’t wish to hand over the certificate of marriage. Even if Mo Wuji didn’t hand over the certificate of marriage, it wouldn’t affect her but she still felt as though there was a knot in her heart.</p><p>\"That I am sorry. I don’t have the certificate of marriage with me because I left it with my sister Yan Yi. You can ask her for it anytime you want,\" Mo Wuji continued apologetically.</p><p>Murong Xiangyu nodded as she heaved a sigh of relief, \"It’s okay, I have to make a trip back after I am done with things here anyway.\"</p><p>After finishing her sentence, Murong Xiangyu turned to Gu Zijian and explained, \"Senior brother Zijian, sorry for wasting a little bit of your time. Let’s go now.\"</p><p>Gu Zijian was full of smiles because to him, this Murong Xiangyu was pledging her loyalty to him by not only saying these on the streets, she ended her fate with Yan Ye in front of him. A woman like herself was definitely worth his love.</p><p>\"Murong Xiangyu…\" Mo Wuji called out for the Murong Xiangyu who was about to leave.</p><p>To Murong Xiangyu, Mo Wuji and herself were two completely unrelated people now. At most, she would still admit that she recognised him. Mo Wuji really got her frowning by calling out to her like that.</p><p>Despite noticing Murong Xiangyu’s furrowed brows, Mo Wuji continued, \"I have something serious to say and even though you might not like it, I have to say it.\"</p><p>Murong Xiangyu remained emotionless.</p><p>Mo Wuji laughed as he didn’t feel sad or disappointed at all and he didn’t even care if Murong Xiangyu was the type to turn her back on her lover and leave for another man as she wished. Even though Dou Hualong’s news might ensure his safety, he was indeed living dangerously while being anonymous back at the Lifeless Dao Sect’s secret domain. He was still very grateful for Murong Xiangyu for bringing him here to the Sharphorn Immortal Ruins as he has had his own improvements here too.</p><p>\"I believe that you are not suitable to cultivate the Supreme Dao Sect’s technique,\" Mo Wuji said sincerely.</p><p>\"Anything else?\" Murong Xiangyu looked calmly at Mo Wuji.</p><p>\"Nothing else,\" Mo Wuji chuckled and the reason why he said this was because he felt that the Supreme Dao Sect was also a supreme sect. A member of a sect like this should be extremely loyal and stubborn with her love but to Mo Wuji, Murong Xiangyu changed her mind way too frequently when it came to love. She simply didn’t seem like a disciple of the Supreme Dao Sect.</p><p>Murong Xiangyu didn’t even bid goodbye as she turned and left.</p><p>Mo Wuji shook his head and patted Dou Hualong before leaving, \"Hualong, let’s go. We should head back to rest too.\"</p><p>At this moment, he was even more relaxed than Murong Xiangyu. He couldn’t believe that something like this was settled so easily here when he initially expected more twists and turns.</p><p>\"Are you called Yan Ye? Please hold on,\" A clear voice called out for Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji turned his head and saw a woman. She recognised this woman as one of the geniuses who was walking alongside Murong Xiangyu and co. Now that Murong Xiangyu had left, why did she come back for?</p><p>...</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
