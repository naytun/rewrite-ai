It would at most take half a day even if Mo Wuji were to fly over alone.</p><p>When Mo Wuji and Lin Gu reached the Yunxian Immortal Valley, this place was already filled with all sorts of cultivators. Mo Wuji had experienced too many of such situations so he was well aware that whenever a place with immortal herbs was about open, it would be filled with cultivators waiting outside.</p><p>Moreover, the Yunxian Immortal Valley was filled with high tier immortal herbs and it rarely opened. Even though less than a hundred people would enter the Yunxian Immortal Valley, the number of businessmen here was insane. It could be said that almost every peak grade merchant house in the entire Immortal World would be here.</p><p>This was because there was a particular time that the Yunxian Immortal Valley would be opened and when it reached the specific time, the Yunxian Immortal Valley would open automatically. If the Yong Ying Immortal Domain wished to open it before the specific time, it would have to be within three years of the designated time.</p><p>Early opening would require a large number of immortal spiritual veins and the Heavenly Emperor of the Yong Ying Immortal Domain exhausted a total of 10 immortal spiritual veins to open the Yunxian Immortal Valley ahead of the designated time. This showed how desperate the Heavenly Emperor was for the Yunxian Immortal Valley to be opened.</p><p>Restrictions were placed around the Yunxian Immortal Valley and the cultivators outside could feel the increasing density of the immortal energy from within.</p><p>Because Mo Wuji was one of the top 3 of the alchemy competition and also an honorary Elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, majority of the cultivators outside came up to greet him the moment he arrived.</p><p>\"This should be the young and promising Pill Master Mo right?\" A clear voice could be heard and an extremely elegant looking man walked over with a smile on his face.</p><p>This was a tall cultivator with tiny eyes.</p><p>Even though he looked extremely elegant, Mo Wuji only need one look at this man and his entire body felt uncomfortable. It felt as though countless of caterpillars were crawling up his body, a feeling of extreme disgust.</p><p>Moreover, this person’s cultivation was so unbelievable that Mo Wuji even suspect that his cultivation level should be much higher than the second President of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Sharphorn Immortal Ruins Branch as well as Murong Xiangyu’s mentor.</p><p>This person was definitely a dangerous figure so Mo Wuji clasped his fists cautiously, \"I wonder how may I address Your Excellency?\"</p><p>\"My name is Wan Fan. Pill Master Mo is a busy man so it is only normal that you don’t recognise me,\" This cultivator smiled but still maintained his elegance.</p><p>Mo Wuji eyes shrinked slightly because he really don’t recognise this fella but he was definitely not unfamiliar with the name Wan Fan. This fella was actually someone who could be considered to be on the same level as the Heavenly Emperor of the Yong Ying Immortal Domain.</p><p>Sect Head of the Vast Ocean Immortal School, the Zero Heaven Immortal Domain’s peak sect. He had nothing against the Sect Head of the Vast Ocean Immortal School but the key was that he had a huge enmity with the Vast Ocean Immortal School.</p><p>Vast Ocean Immortal School’s Star Grade Genius Bai Chitian was killed by him and Fu Bei of the same Vast Ocean Immortal School was also slashed by Mo Wuji’s saber before escaping. Now that Wan Fan was here, nothing good would come out of this. It was no wonder Mo Wuji felt that this person was dangerous because this man was definitely here to kill him.</p><p>\"So you are the reputable Sect Head Wan,\" Mo Wuji clasped his fist casually and since the two of them were meant to be nemesis, there was no need for pretence.</p><p>Wan Fan stared at Mo Wuji for a while before smiling, \"I’ve heard that Pill Master Mo had been to the Broken World not too long ago so I was wondering if Pill Master Mo had met my two good-for-nothing disciples, Bai Chitian and Fu Bei, of the Vast Ocean Immortal School in the Broken World?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji said faintly, \"I have met too many people in the Broken World and other than a few exceptional cultivators whom I remembered their names, I couldn’t recall any other names.\"</p><p>\"Haha,\" Wan Fan laughed out loud, \"Pill Master Mo was a natural genius so you would naturally not remember these mediocre people. In actual fact, the purpose of my visit here today is to strike some deals with Pill Master Mo. I know that Pill Master Mo has two jade tokens to enter the Yunxian Immortal Valley and I would like to trade for one jade token with Pill Master Mo. Of course, the price would be decided by Pill Master Mo and regardless of the price, Pill Master Mo would be a distinguished guest in the Vast Ocean Immortal School. As for the past matters, I, Wan Fan, will forget everything.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji sneered, this fella was actually threatening him. He, Mo Wuji, was not someone who was afraid of threats. Mo Wuji’s guess was that Wan Fan should be a Immortal Veteran but so what if he was a Immortal Veteran?</p><p>\"My apologies, I have arrangements for both my jade tokens so I am unable to take it out to trade with this Dao Friend here,\" Mo Wuji replied calmly.</p><p>Wan Fan’s face turned cold and his tone became serious, \"My Vast Ocean Immortal School’s Star Grade Genius Bai Chitian had not returned from the Broken World and I heard that he met you inside?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji responded faintly, \"I have already said that I’ve met too many people inside. I will definitely not remember every Tom, Dick and Harry I meet inside.\"</p><p>\"Alright, you have guts,\" Wan Fan’s killing intent shrouded his entire body as if he was about to explode in anger.</p><p>Mo Wuji grabbed his honoured grade Tier 4 Pill King jade token and his immortal energy seeped into it. A purple light shot out and in just a few breaths, two cultivators wearing the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance’s robes appeared in front of them. These two people seemed to know Mo Wuji’s origins and immediately greeted him, \"Elder Mo called for us?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji just learnt how to ask for help using his jade token and he didn’t expect it to be this effective. This showed how powerful the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance was and in fact, as long as an important figure of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance was around, there would be hidden protectors from the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance.</p><p>Perhaps because of this, no one dared to offend the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance.</p><p>These two people were evidently stronger than the two enforcers from the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance previously and Mo Wuji used his spiritual will to sense that these two people should be in the Immortal King Realm.</p><p>Even though both of them were still far weaker than Wan Fan in front of him, they were not people Wan Fan could use his aura to suppress casually.</p><p>Mo Wuji nodded and pointed to Wan Fan, \"This person threatened me just now so I shall hand him for you two to handle.\"</p><p>Wan Fan’s expression changed drastically because even though the Vast Ocean Immortal School was powerful, it was definitely not a match for the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance. He didn’t expect Mo Wuji to be this fearless to summon the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance’s enforcers even when he didn’t say any words of threats.</p><p>If he knew that Mo Wuji would complain so casually, he would definitely not be so long-winded with him. Even if he had to kill Mo Wuji, he would also do it in the dark.</p><p>The two Pill Dao Immortal Alliance enforcers were both wearing sesame coloured robes and the slightly taller enforcer’s eyes landed on Wan Fan before saying calmly, \"Sect Head Wan, your Vast Ocean Immortal School is not a small sect so are you sure you want to provoke my Pill Dao Immortal Alliance?\"</p><p>As the taller cultivator spoke, the other enforcer had already grabbed a faint gold Messenger Arrow Talisman. Wan Fan was definitely not someone they could deal with so they would need reinforcement too.</p><p>Wan Fan was shocked because how would he know that Mo Wuji would be so illogical to take out his jade token even after he didn’t do anything. He hurried to take a step forward and clasped his fist, \"Two Dao Friends here, it was a complete misunderstanding earlier on. If I wanted to act against Pill Master Mo, given my strength, why would Pill Master Mo still be standing there unharmed? Perhaps the way I spoke caused the misunderstanding so Pill Master Mo, please forgive me.\"</p><p>The two Pill Dao Immortal Alliance enforcers clearly didn’t want to act against the Vast Ocean Immortal School over a small matter like this so both of them looked over to Mo Wuji.</p><p>Even Wan Fan knew that Mo Wuji had a complete control over the situation here. If Mo Wuji were to take this seriously, even if he killed Mo Wuji instantly, his Vast Ocean Immortal School would immediately become one of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance’s enemy.</p><p>Mo Wuji was naturally not so foolish to act against Wan Fan now. Without mentioning that Wan Fan might act like a cornered dog by jumping over the wall desperately, Mo Wuji had a pile of more important matters to settle now.</p><p>He gave Wan Fan a cold glance, \"Sect Head Wan, please be more cautious as you speak in the future. Your Vast Ocean Immortal School can threaten others but please don’t ever threaten me ever again.\"</p><p>After saying this, Mo Wuji clasped his fist towards the two Pill Dao Immortal Alliance enforcers, \"Many thanks to these two Dao Friends for your timely help. If anything were to happen to me in the future, both of you can help me report. To plead for Pill Emperor Nong Yong, Pill Emperor Gong Yangxue and Pill Emperor Heng Jun to seek justice for me. Because the culprit would definitely be the Vast Ocean Immortal School.\"</p><p>Wan Fan heard this and almost spat out blood because he didn’t even do anything. All he did was to use words and killing intent to threaten Mo Wuji and Mo Wuji framed him so shamelessly. Furthermore, there was nothing he could do now and given Mo Wuji’s character, who knows if he would hurt himself if he tried to act against Mo Wuji?</p><p>The two enforcers stared coldly at Wan Fan without saying anything.</p><p>Wan Fan helped extremely dismayed as he simply grunted and left. At a moment like this, there was nothing for him to say.</p><p>\"Big Brother Mo, don’t you think you went a little overboard?\" After the three of them left, Lin Gu asked Mo Wuji cautiously.</p><p>Mo Wuji shook his head helplessly, \"Not at all because do you know that even if I were to kneel down and hand that old j*rk the jade token to enter the Yunxian Immortal Valley, he would still kill me eventually. Since this is the case, why should I stoop so low to do that?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji was well aware of how a shameless person like Wan Fan would act and that any act of trying to please him would not change his resolve to kill Mo Wuji. Therefore, he decided to be ruthless to let his opponent know of his status and that he was not someone his Vast Ocean Immortal School could offend so casually.</p><p>Lin Gu understood Mo Wuji very quickly and sighed. Despite Mo Wuji threatened Wan Fan, leaving the Yong Ying Immortal Domain would still be filled with a lot of dangers. A old j*rk like Wan Fan would appear as if he was afraid of the threat of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance but he would definitely not let Mo Wuji off in his heart.</p><p>Wan Fan believed that whether it was Mo Wuji or any important figure of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, the moment Mo Wuji was dead, the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance couldn’t publicly accuse the Vast Ocean Immortal School even if they guessed it was done by them.</p><p>\"Boom!\" An extremely oppressive sound was heard and a path appeared in front of everyone. The path exuded dense immortal energy and there were three huge words floating above the path: Yunxian Immortal Valley.</p><p>Kui Fengyun’s voice could be heard, \"May I ask all those cultivators with a Yunxian Immortal Valley jade token to enter the Yunxian Immortal Valley and those without the tokens to stay behind. Cultivators to enter the Yunxian Immortal Valley must be below the Grand Yi Stage otherwise, you would be denied entry. Because of the early opening of the Yunxian Immortal Valley, the total time to pick immortal herbs would be reduced to half a year.\"</p><p>When he heard this, Mo Wuji heaved a sigh of relief because he was afraid that anyone could enter the Yunxian Immortal Valley. It was good that they had restrictions on the level of the cultivation. What he didn’t know was that the Yunxian Immortal Valley was a place to harvest immortal herbs so strong experts were never allowed to enter. This was to prevent the destruction of the immortal spiritual vein during a fight between two powerful experts.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
