Under the barrage of the rich immortal spiritual energy, his cultivation broke past the intermediate stage as he arrived at the late Golden Immortal Stage.</p><p>Mo Wuji could feel that the immortal spiritual energy around him seemed to get weaker, so he stopped his cultivation. The moment he opened his eyes, he discovered that the immortal mist did indeed become thinner. He couldn’t cultivate any further; if he cultivated any further, he might actually suck this Immortal Training Pool dry of its immortal spiritual energy. Moreover, the Broken World would be opening soon, and he didn’t want to miss that opportunity.</p><p>Mo Wuji stood up. Just when he was thinking about leaving, his heart suddenly pounded. Spiritual energy rapidly condensed around his forehead; his spiritual eye appeared.</p><p>What left Mo Wuji pleasantly surprised was that he discovered that his spiritual eye was now stronger by multiple times; he could even see the outlines of the restrictive arrays around this Immortal Training Pool.</p><p>His spiritual eye really improved together with his cultivation. As he thought about how his spiritual eye could now see through arrays, Mo Wuji’s heart became filled with anticipation. The moment his spiritual eye reaches a certain level, then even if he wasn’t able to understand an array, he could use the spiritual eye to help him. Previously, he didn’t care too much about his spiritual eye, but from the current looks of it, this sacred art was really amazing.</p><p>Mo Wuji cleaned himself up and walked out the Immortal Spirit Pool.</p><p>The moment he reached the first floor’s hall, Mo Wuji saw Gong Yi waiting for him.</p><p>\"Congratulations Elder Mo for coming out of your session.\" When Gong Yi saw Mo Wuji, he happily came over to pay his greetings.</p><p>This Gong Yi was definitely wise about the ways of the world, he actually waited out here for Mo Wuji; Mo Wuji started to think that this person was the most suitable person to run the store. It would be best if he could get a huge pile of immortal herbs during his trip to the Broken World, then he could concoct a large amount of pills for Gong Yi to sell.</p><p>Seeing Mo Wuji nodd his head, Gong Yi knew that his actions were right. He hurriedly said, \"Hualong is cultivating in the store. I know that the Broken World would open soon, so I came to bring the elder over.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji was just intending to go to the Broken World. Now that he heard Gong Yi’s words, he promptly replied, \"Since that’s the case, I will have to trouble you. Oh right, during my closed doors session, nothing special happened right?\"</p><p>Gong Yi speedily answered, \"Nothing much. A Star-grade genius called Shen Muqing came to visit once. But when she heard that you were behind closed doors, she didn’t make any further visits. Also, Luo Ling Immortal Domain’s Immortal Emperor Wen Lan gained some insights while in a waterfall. To confirm her dao, she used the Noble Goldfire Shade to suppress the fates and created the Waterfall Immortal Sect. At the same time, she’s inviting various experts to participate in her immortal tea assembly.\"</p><p>He might have heard from Dou Hualong that this Elder Mo was interested in all kinds of news. Thus, Gong Yi specially went to listen to some gossip. Indeed, he discovered that Mo Wuji looked very satisfied after hearing these news.</p><p>The departure area for the Broken World was not very far from Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Sharphorn Branch. The two of them conversed as they made their way over, and in an incense’s time, they arrived at their destination.</p><p>\"Elder Mo, the Transfer Tower from Sharphorn Immortal Ruins to the Broken World is in front. You just need to show your identity token to enter. Typically, those heading to the Broken World would go to the Tower half to one month in advance. That way, they would be able to get on the transfer array first, and then have a better position. Not only would having a better position affect your reputation, it would also be beneficial to your cultivation,\" Gong Yi pointed to a tower and said.</p><p>Mo Wuji was very satisfied with Gong Yi’s work attitude, \"Gong Yi, you can return first. Hualong isn’t very experienced, take care of him as much as you can. Wait for me to return, I will guide you to become a Tier 4 Pill King.\"</p><p>Gong Yi was so excited that his hands started trembling. Even though he knew that Mo Wuji had misspoke, it should be guiding him from Tier 2 to Tier 3, but to him, there was no difference. Over all these years, he was just lacking that bit to become a true Tier 3 Pill Monarch.</p><p>Even if he got the guidance of a Honored Grade Tier 4 Pill King like Mo Wuji, it still wasn’t a casual thing for him to get past that gap.</p><p>\"Yes, Elder Mo.\" Gong Yi bowed, then waited at the side.</p><p>Mo Wuji walked into the Transfer Tower.</p><p>\"Show your invitation token to the Broken World.\" The moment Mo Wuji entered, a cultivator blocked him.</p><p>Mo Wuji took out his Elder Identity Token. The cultivator casually received Mo Wuji’s jade token, but when he saw that Mo Wuji was a Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Branch Elder, his expression immediately turned serious.</p><p>After carefully examining the authenticity of the jade token, this cultivator respectfully passed the jade token back to Mo Wuji with both his hands, \"Elder Mo, please head up to the third floor.\"</p><p>Truly a good thing to use. Mo Wuji nodded to this cultivator, kept his jade token and entered.</p><p>…</p><p>The moment Mo Wuji entered the Transfer Tower’s third floor, he found that it was already full of people.</p><p>The seats here seemed to be stratified. Close to the winders, the relatively brighter chairs seemed to be engraved with nine stars. Not so close to the window, the relative more spacious chairs were inscribed with eight stars. The chairs further away had seven stars, then six stars, then five stars. The chairs furthest away and the chairs at the corner did not have any engravings or logos.</p><p>His merely swept through the room with his eyes and he saw the clear distinction. Those that occupied the star seats were experts brimming with spiritual aura. The ordinary looking cultivators would sit at the outer chairs; some of them were even standing.</p><p>At the same time, he saw a few familiar people: Murong Xiangyu, Qiao Qianyan, Ao Tiancheng. There was even that Gu Zijian who was by Murong Xiangyu’s side.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not care too much about it. Since there were some empty seats, he was not going to stand outside. He randomly found a seat close to the window and sat down. After all, they weren’t going to be transferred away immediately, and this seat had an good view and felt more comfortable.</p><p>The moment she saw Mo Wuji, Murong Xiangyu frowned. She could not figure out why Mo Wuji would come to this place. One must know that none of the cultivators here were ordinary people. Even those sitting at the corners had huge backgrounds. They were either Five Star Geniuses, or cultivators that had high statuses, but low cultivation. [1]</p><p>\"Yan Ye, what are you doing here?\" Qiao Qianyan was the first one to ask this question.</p><p>Mo Wuji smiled, \"I already changed my name. I’m no longer called Yan Ye, but Mo Wuji.\"</p><p>Qiao Qianyan did not care about Mo Wuji changing his name; he continued, \"Dao Friend Mo, I suggest that you don’t sit there.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji was Murong Xiangyu’s first dao companion, which caused him to feel discontented with Mo Wuji at the start. But now, Mo Wuji was no longer related to Murong Xiangyu, and he had also been kicked out of the relationship. This made him feel that Mo Wuji and him were fellow sufferers. Moreover, Mo Wuji came from the same place as him, so Qiao Qianyan was more familiar with Mo Wuji than the other cultivators here.</p><p>\"Why?\" Mo Wuji asked curiously, \"Could this seat already have been reserved?\"</p><p>\"You’re right, that seat was indeed reserved. The person who reserved your seat there is me,\" A slightly raspy voice came over, and a youth with a slender figure and fair skin walked in.</p><p>Mo Wuji was thinking inwardly: This fella looks so delicate, he’s simply a woman.</p><p>\"Go off then. I won’t cause you trouble.\" The delicate youth walked in front of Mo Wuji, his voice was calm.</p><p>Mo Wuji frowned slightly; he turned his gaze to Ao Tiancheng, \"Ao Tiancheng, tell me, is this seat reserved? If it really is reserved, then I will make way.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji hadn’t asked Gong Yi this question. Thus he didn’t know whether the waiting seats to the Broken World could not reserved. If it was really true that the seats could be reserved, then he was indeed being unreasonable by taking another person’s seat.</p><p>Ao Tiancheng didn’t have to mood to care about Mo Wuji, but he was slightly worried that Mo Wuji was going to be unreasonable. He had seen how unreasonable this fella could be. This fella simply used his saber to destroy the Void Piercer Treasure Pavilion’s stone lion without reason or warning. If this fella really caused trouble for him here, he really might be unable to go to the Broken World. On the other hand, Mo Wuji, as a Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Branch Elder, would still have the chance to go to the Broken World even if he caused trouble here.</p><p>However, he did want to see this fella fighting with Huan Xiuran.</p><p>As he thought of this, Ao Tiancheng said calmly, \"The seats here can’t be reserved, it’s first come first serve. The reason why your seat is said to be reserved is because of the silent rule that the seats near the window are for Nine Star Geniuses.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji came to an understanding; that meant that this fair youth in front of him was a Nine Star Genius. There was no need to talk about this fair youth in front of him, if another Nine Star Genius came, that genius could also sit at his seat. Even though he was no Star-grade genius, he, Mo Wuji, was the progenitor of the meridian cultivation method. Compared to a Nine Star Genius, he wasn’t far off, right? Moreover, if he had enough cultivation resources, with his 108 meridians forming a huge cultivation path, how would Nine Star Geniuses compare to him? There would definitely lose.</p><p>He was bent on having this seat; and he had the rights to sit there.</p><p>Even though Ao Tiancheng was a Seven Star Genius, his explosive temper was famous. Everyone in the room never thought that this fella with an explosive temper would patiently answer Mo Wuji’s question. He didn’t even lean towards Huan Xiuran; this momentarily left everyone flabbergasted.</p><p>\"Sorry, I came here first. You can go find another seat.\" Now that Mo Wuji knew that it was impossible to reserve seats, he did not hesitate to reject Huan Xiuran’s request; he even felt some discontent in his heart. If the seats were classified based on talent, then who could say that this fella was more talented than him?</p><p>Huan Xiuran coldly asked, \"I wonder Sir is which sect’s Nine Star Genius? Why haven’t I seen you before?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji said indifferently, \"Whether I’m a Nine Star Genius or not is not related to you. Who says that only Nine Star Geniuses can sit here? Why can’t Ten Star Geniuses take this seat?\"</p><p>Originally, Mo Wuji didn’t care too much about having a good position. But now that he saw a Nine Star Genius try to take his seat, he felt that Gong Yi wasn’t kidding about having a good position.</p><p>\"Since that’s the case, let me see how tough your bones are, and your talented you are to sit here.\" Huan Xiuran’s voice was calm, but his killing intent could no longer be concealed.</p><p>[1] Because those with high cultivation (Grand Yi Immortal and above) weren’t allowed to go during the first year of the opening.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
