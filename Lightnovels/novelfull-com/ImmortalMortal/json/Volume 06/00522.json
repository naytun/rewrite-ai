But towards this mysterious Mo Wuji, really no one dared to do anything.</p><p>Bai Chitain’s face turned cold; he also knew Mo Wuji. He really never expected that Mo Wuji would spoil his show at the time like this. Even though Mo Wuji was mysterious, he, as a late stage Xuan Immortal, didn’t fear this Golden Immortal.</p><p>\"Immortal Friend Mo, even though I don’t know your background, I can guess that your background isn’t ordinary. This place was discovered by everyone. Now we want to break this place apart to get the treasure from within. You’re considered one of the last few to arrive, so what rights do you have to stop us from getting the treasure?\" Bai Chitian’s voice was icy cold, it even contained a hint of killing intent.</p><p>Mo Wuji sneered, this fella was really devious, with just a simple sentence, this fella was able to create dissatisfaction towards him. If someone were to initiate an attack on him now, he might actually be encircled and killed. Sometimes, when people were in numbers, they might not place some mysterious enigmas in their eyes.</p><p>Seeing the range of expressions on the surrounding cultivators’ faces, Mo Wuji chuckled, \"What an idiot, did I say that I was stopping everyone? And what do you mean when you said that I was among the last to arrive? There were many other cultivators that came later; I’m not the only one. Are you saying that after the array is opened, these latecomers would get a smaller share?\"</p><p>After rebutting Bai Chitian, Mo Wuji raised his volume and said, \"The reason why I disagree was because I have the means to break through this array in an even shorter time.\"</p><p>Bai Chitian looked at Mo Wuji in disdain, \"You know what array this is? Do you know that natural arrays usually don’t have any traces or marks to take advantage of? All attacks on it would be converted to nothingness. A mere cultivator that has yet to reach the Xuan Immortal Stage actually dares to spout such nonsense about breaking the array.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji calmly said, \"Just now, I heard you say that you need 6 hours to break this array. That’s such a long time, in that time, my dinner would have already gone cold. I only need 1 hour to break this array.\"</p><p>\"Is it true that Immortal Friend Mo only needs 1 hour to break this array?\" A tall and bearded youth asked seriously.</p><p>Mo Wuji glanced at this person and immediately knew that this was a fella was an exceptional talent. Just from the spiritual aura around this person, Mo Wuji could tell that this fella was at least a Seven Star Genius; he might even be an Eight Star Genius.</p><p>\"That’s right. I’m sure that I will be able to break this array within 1 hour,\" Mo Wuji said confidently.</p><p>\"Alright, as long as Immortal Friend Mo is able to break this array within 1 hour, I, Chen Hu, promise that after we enter, you would be the first to pick an item,\" The bearded man did not hesitate to promise.</p><p>Mo Wuji had jumped out so suddenly. If not for an item, he wouldn’t have done such a thing. Thus, Chen Hu was very straightforward to give Mo Wuji what he wanted.</p><p>Bai Chitian’s lips started twitching as he wanted to say some words. However, there was nothing that he could say. He required 6 hours to break the array while the other guy only needed 1; that was 6 times faster than him. In the third level of the Broken World, wasn’t time the most valuable thing? Everyone knew that they had to properly make use of this time in order to find the true treasures. If they wasted this time, then others would have already found the treasures.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not waste any time; he brought out some array flags and installed them around the perimeter of the heap of earth.</p><p>He installed a total of 49 array flags. Thereafter, he waved his hand and said, \"I have installed 49 array flags. Immortal friends here, have two people stand at each flag. The leftovers will stand beside me.\"</p><p>Bai Chitian thought that Mo Wuji really knew of a way to solve this array. But now when he saw Mo Wuji’s methods, he knew that he had been overthinking it. Mo Wuji was using a method of spreading the arrack force; it would be unheard of if it could actually break this array within an hour.</p><p>Chen Hu said loudly, \"Immortal friends, please form pairs of two and follow according to Immortal Friend Mo’s instructions.\"</p><p>He, himself, stood by Mo Wuji’s side.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not mind. After waiting for the other people to get into position, he brought forward the sabre that was on his back and said, \"Soon, I will lead the attack on the array’s foundations. Those standing beside me will attack the same spot as me. When I say ‘Break’, the immortal friends standing at the 49 array flags will attack.\"</p><p>After Mo Wuji finished speaking, the sabre in his hand formed a huge radiant blade which he cleaved downwards.</p><p>Everyone present paid attention to Mo Wuji’s sabre; even though everyone wanted to break the array, they also wanted to know exactly how strong Mo Wuji was.</p><p>The radiant blade formed by Mo Wuji was as huge as 30 meters long. The sabre light swung downwards, looking as though it was tearing space into half.</p><p>Even though the power of Mo Wuji’s sabre was very powerful, everyone heaved a sigh of relief. This was because the power behind that attack really showed that Mo Wuji was indeed in the Golden Immortal Stage. Even though he was stronger than an average Golden Immortal, he was not a level where he could match with Xuan Immortals.</p><p>After Mo Wuji started attacking, those beside Mo Wuji took out their magic treasures and started striking at the same spot.</p><p>Compared to the Xuan Immortals, Mo Wuji’s attack power was indeed weaker. However, Mo Wuji did not seem to care as he continued to swing his sabre downwards.</p><p>He wasn’t even using his full strength; with so many people attacking this array, would he even need to use his full strength? At the most, he had only displayed 20% of his power. After all, there were experts all around looking at him, he was not going to show all his cards. Moreover, he had already offended that Bai Chitian.</p><p>After attacking for a whole two to three minutes, Mo Wuji suddenly shouted, \"Break!\"</p><p>The other cultivators had been waiting for this command of Mo Wuji’s; the moment Mo Wuji uttered that word, shining beams of magical equipment light simultaneously attacked the different spots on the array. With that single combined attack, the crowd started to hear a series of rumbling sounds.</p><p>Everyone was incomparably delighted. But at this moment, Mo Wuji shouted even louder, \"Attack with more strength!\"</p><p>\"Boom! Boom! Boom!\" Another hundred radiant lights struck down on the array.</p><p>\"Crack!\" A loud tearing noise resounded. The original heap of earth had now disappeared. In its place, a huge mountain gate appeared.</p><p>\"Haha, Immortal Friend Mo truly wasn’t spouting nonsense. There’s no need to talk about an hour, that wasn’t even half an incense’s time, and the array had already been broken. Come, let’s go inside.\" Chen Hu chuckled and led the way inside together with Mo Wuji. Behind the mountain gate, was a huge hall. At the centre of the hall, there was a stone table and there were various kinds of things on the stone table.</p><p>Mo Wuji was not surprised; there must have been a problem with the array, which was way there was that metal-type energy. Otherwise, even if he understood this natural array, he wouldn’t have broken it in such a short time.</p><p>Bai Chitian swiftly charged to the front; he even overtook Mo Wuji and Chen Hu.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t chase after him. His spiritual will had already scanned the stone table and he knew that there were seals on the things on the table. Even if Bai Chitian reached before him, Bai Chitian wouldn’t be able to immediately snatch anything away.</p><p>Chen Hu said indifferently, \"A dishonest man will never be welcomed. Immortal Friend Mo, you can take the first pick.\"</p><p>Bai Chitian also noticed that the things on the stone table were sealed. Even though he could not wait to break the seal and take one of the jade boxes away, he had to wait for Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji really had a good impression of Chen Hu’s magnanimity. Even though others might disagree, Mo Wuji was still going to take the jade box. But since Chen Hu had already explained it, Mo Wuji naturally wouldn’t hesitate. He took a step forward and formed a few hand seals, the seals on the stone table easily broke apart. Mo Wuji easily sent that jade box into his storage ring.</p><p>The moment that jade box disappeared, the surrounding metal-type energy disappeared.</p><p>When Bai Chitian saw Mo Wuji casually take that jade box away, his eyes turned red. If not for the fact that he knew he couldn’t make a move here, he would have already attacked Mo Wuji.</p><p>\"There are only three items here. Besides the jade box that Immortal Friend Mo had already taken, there’s still a technique manual and a pagoda-shaped magic treasure. We have more than a hundred people here, how are we going to split it?\" Even though there were two other things on the table, no one made a move.</p><p>Chen Hu’s gaze landed on Mo Wuji, but Mo Wuji didn’t say anything. Then, Bai Chitian said, \"If there were many things on the table, then it wouldn’t matter if Immortal Friend Mo took an item first. But now that there are only three items, I suggest that Immortal Friend Mo takes out your item then we bid on all the items here. Thereafter, Immortal Friend Mo can take a larger percentage of the immortal crystals. How about that?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji gave Bai Chitian a single, cold glance as he said emotionlessly, \"Bullsh*t.\"</p><p>\"Hmm, other people might be scared of you, but I, Bai Chitian, have nothing to fear.\" Bai Chitian had been waiting to cause trouble for Mo Wuji. Now that Mo Wuji had cursed him, how could he hold back?</p><p>Mo Wuji also wanted to get rid of this detestable fella. However, he knew that he wouldn’t be able to do anything much to Bai Chitian at a place like this.</p><p>He directly ignored Bai Chitian, but clasped his fists to the crowd and said, \"There’s definitely more than these three items here. Because behind this place, there’s still another seal.\"</p><p>The moment Mo Wuji finished, he took a step forward and swung his sabre.</p><p>\"Boom!\" Another loud rumble resounded. A garden suddenly appeared at the back of the hall. There was only a single fruit tree in the centre of the garden. The moment Mo Wuji slashed through that array, that rich and fragrant immortal energy wafted over.</p><p>\"It’s the Draining Immortal King Dao Fruit!\" Many voices cried out at the same time. Almost everyone recognised that the tree in front of them was a Draining Immortal King Fruit Tree. Moreover, that tree had more than a hundred fruits.</p><p>\"Haha, it’s really the Draining Immortal King Dao Fruit.\" Chen Hu chortled, clearly very satisfied with this outcome.</p><p>The Draining Immortal King Dao Fruit was a Tier 7 Immortal Fruit. This fruit could be eaten directly or used to concoct the Draining Immortal King Pill. The Draining Immortal King Pill was a true Tier 7 immortal pill; such a thing could not simply be purchased by money. This was because this pill’s function was to help Grand Luo Immortals to gain enlightenment on the Immortal Dao and step into the Immortal King Stage.</p><p>The Immortal King was an expert that possessed a dao seat. No matter how strong a Grand Luo Immortal was, it couldn’t compare with this qualitative difference with an Immortal King.</p><p>\"According to my estimates, those Draining Immortal King Dao Fruits are at least 100,000 years old,\" A thin Xuan Immortal said emotionally.</p><p>The older a Draining Immortal King Dao Fruit, the more valuable it was. A 100,000-year-old Draining Immortal King Dao Fruit was simply something many could only wish for.</p><p>\"Immortal Friend Mo, you are the one that discovered this garden, and you are the one that broke it open. You suggest how it should be distributed,\" Chen Hu said as he turned towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji clasped his fist to the crowd and said, \"Various immortal friends, there are a total of 131 Draining Immortal King Dao Fruits on that tree while there are 122 of us here. I suggest that everyone gets one Draining Immortal King Dao Fruit first.\"</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
