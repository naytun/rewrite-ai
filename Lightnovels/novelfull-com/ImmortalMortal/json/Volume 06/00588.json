His treasure-hunting plate could no longer sense the energy of the unique treasure which meant that Mo Wuji had swept the treasure away with him.</p><p>He had no clue as to how Mo Wuji was able to find the piece of the planet which contained the treasures but no matter what, he would not let someone walk away with something he had been searching for years.</p><p>At this moment, he had no hesitation as he instantly went towards the direction that Mo Wuji escaped in.</p><p>…</p><p>Mo Wuji knew that Jin Yiren would not let him go so he constantly executed his Wind Escape Technique madly. As compared to his Grade 7 immortal flying shuttle, his Wind Escape Technique would not leave any traces behind. Even if there were the slightest of traces left behind, he had left much earlier than Jin Yiren so the energy in space would definitely have wiped out these possible traces.</p><p>Even though he didn’t injure Jin Yiren badly, Mo Wuji wasn’t disappointed. Not only did he managed to obtain the 11 fire-red crystals, he gained insights on his very own blade sacred art. The first blade was the Grand Desert, second blade was the Winding River and the third blade, Setting Sun.</p><p>He had only just gained enlightenment on his first blade, Grand Desert and he was able to obtain the advantage in a battle with Jin Yiren. Unfortunately, his second and third blade had yet to form up properly because the moment he was able to execute both the second and third blade too, he would no longer need to escape. This was because Jin Yiren would definitely be the one who would be trying to escape.</p><p>After being on the run for multiple days, when Mo Wuji could no longer feel Jin Yiren’s aura and felt that he was relatively safer, he stopped. Following which, he boarded his flying shuttle before allowing it to be autopilot mode.</p><p>Mo Wuji entered his own Undying World as he landed directly on the piece of the planet he sent in. Other than the 11 fire-red crystals on it, everything else looked perfectly normal.</p><p>After breaking apart the restrictions on it, Mo Wuji didn’t seem to sense any peculiarity within the 11 fire-red crystals. Even though it’s red colour was the same shade of red as a flame, he didn’t feel any burning sensation at all.</p><p>After placing all 11 fire-red crystals on the floor, other than a type of energy which even Mo Wuji was unable to perceive, there was also an extremely warm feeling. The only unique point was that every single one of the fire-red crystal felt like a lotus flower petal.</p><p>If he were to add one more fire-red crystal and put all 12 of them together, it would really resemble the Tier 12 Red Karmic Fire Lotus. However, Mo Wuji was aware that this was not possible and that the Tier 12 Red Karmic Fire Lotus would not be separated into these. Furthermore, Mo Wuji had seen the Red Karmic Fire Lotus before and if the one he saw was real, the real Red Karmic Fire Lotus should be in the third level of the Broken World.</p><p>At the thought of the fact that the Fire Elemental Bead could be related to these crystals, Mo Wuji picked up a crystal and drew his Scholar’s Heart simultaneously.</p><p>The moment the Scholar’s Heart was drawn out, it let out a shrill cry as if it was pregnant with a new life. Following which, the green flame instantly wrapped around the fire-red crystal.</p><p>It felt different as compared to when the Scholar’s Heart advanced with the use of the fire heartstone. The flame of the Scholar’s Heart actually converged and eventually turned into a green fire cocoon with no movement at all. Mo Wuji’s spiritual will seeped into the green fire cocoon and all he saw was a pure green and red energy. He was not able to see the specific process of what happened.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t touch the Scholar’s Heart and went to keep all the remaining 10 fire-red crystals into one jade box before sealing it up. Afterwards, he went to check on the spaceship.</p><p>Mo Wuji could tell that this spaceship was in a mess because of the battles it got into. There were even some blood stains and a few laser guns that were lying on the floor.</p><p>Mo Wuji was a biologist and a pharmacy scientist and even though he recognised that it was a spaceship, he wasn’t all too familiar with such technologies.After looking through for half a day, he didn’t find any azimuth coordinates that was related to Earth. With reference to the words on it, he realised that this spaceship was sent up by an alliance on Earth. As for when did his Earth had a new alliance, Mo Wuji had no idea and didn’t want to know.</p><p>After one more round of thorough checks, Mo Wuji lost interest in this spaceship when he confirmed that he couldn’t make use of this spaceship to return to Earth.</p><p>Ever since Mo Wuji decided to throw the memories of Xia Ruoyin away, he was not as eager to return to Earth. He was more eager to return to the Immortal World because he had his friends and future there. The pity was that up till today, Mo Wuji had no clue as to how to return to the Immortal World.</p><p>He was slightly helpless and frustrated when he thought that Jin Yiren could know the way back to the Immortal World. Unfortunately, he was his enemy and was definitely not able to have a good talk with him if he met him again.</p><p>The universe was so vast and even if a puny Xuan Immortal like himself were to exhaust all his energy to search for his way back, it might still be futile.</p><p>Fortunately, he had gained some rewards and the first was that he was aware that his technique would not be restricted by the Laws of Heaven and Earth. Secondly, he obtained a physique tempering technique and enlightened his blade sacred art. Thirdly, he even managed to obtain 11 valuable looking fire-red crystals.</p><p>He decided to continue cultivating because he still had a pile of immortal crystals with him. Additionally, he had plenty of immortal pills after coming out from the Yunxian Immortal Valley which would be enough for him to cultivate for a period of time. Who knows that maybe one day, after he reached the Grand Yi Stage and felt the pressure of the Heaven and Earth, he would be swept up back to the Immortal World?</p><p>Mo Wuji was indeed very optimistic. He knew that there was no difference between controlling the flying shuttle himself and setting it to autopilot because he had no specific destination anyway.</p><p>However, Mo Wuji didn’t start cultivating inside the flying shuttle or in his Undying World but chose to cultivate on the deck of his flying shuttle. He only installed a defensive array and not a concealment array because he wanted people to notice him. The moment he met a cultivator in space, he might be able to find his way back to the Immortal World.</p><p>…</p><p>Gods Immortal Domain, Unfettered Emperor Palace.</p><p>A skinny and tall man wearing an Immortal Emperor crown was staring at the people kneeling in front of him with a gloomy and stern face. This skinny and tall man was the Gods Immortal Domain’s peak grade Immortal Emperor Lun Cai who was also known as Grand Emperor Lun Cai.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, those who were in the advanced Immortal Emperor Stage would be qualified to be addressed as Grand Emperor in the Immortal World. However, the truth was that every Grand Emperor would be one of the strongest in their region because if one didn’t have the true capability, even if others were to address him as an Grand Emperor, one wouldn’t dare to acknowledge it too. A Grand Emperor in the Immortal World comes with supreme honour and would be considered as a symbol of true power and strength.</p><p>Immortal Emperor Lun Cai, was indeed a Grand Emperor at the pinnacle of the advanced Immortal Emperor Stage and was shockingly strong.</p><p>After a full incense worth of time, Immortal Emperor said in a solemn tone, \"Lai Yi, are you certain that the Mo Wuji went to the Soul Condensing Immortal Pool?\"</p><p>A young looking man walked over and bowed, \"Yes, and he didn’t return after he went there.\"</p><p>Lun Cai was very familiar with the Soul Condensing Pool so he didn’t ask if the young man went to check thoroughly. If a Xuan Immortal like Mo Wuji entered the Soul Condensing Immortal Pool, he would basically be courting death.</p><p>Immortal Emperor Lun Cai’s face turned serious again as his tone sounded even more furious than before, \"Hong Ling, what have you found out?\"</p><p>A red hair girl walked over hurriedly, \"That Mo Wuji was a Pill King of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance and was even an elder. He had participated in the Yong Ying Immortal Domain Grand Alchemy Competition and had went to the Yunxian Immortal Valley. Other than this, he also had a pill house in the Sharphorn Immortal Ruins, called the Tian Ji Pill House.\"</p><p>Lun Cai said with an icy cold tone, \"Inform the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance immediately that it was a small matter that Mo Wuji died at the Soul Condensing Immortal Pool but he actually affected the life of my imperial concubine. I need everyone around him to be buried for my concubine. Because of my respect for the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, I would not be calculative with them but I hope that when I am acting against Mo Wuji’s pill house and the people around him, the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance would not interfere. Otherwise, they shouldn’t blame me for turning nasty against them. And also that Devil Moon Immortal School who provided Mo Wuji a slot to enter the Soul Condensing Immortal Pool should also be held responsible…\"</p><p>If Mo Wuji was here, he would definitely be dumbfounded at the sight of such unreasonable person. He had not even met, let alone promise, Immortal Emperor and simply because he had some medical skills, he made Immortal Emperor Lun Cai so infuriated that the people around him had to be buried.</p><p>In fact, he wasn’t even aware that Lun Cai was looking for him during this period of time.</p><p>…</p><p>Pill Dao Immortal Alliance was a massive and tyrannical existence in the Immortal World. The only reason Lun Cai could be so unreasonable was because Mo Wuji was dead.</p><p>Presently, at the headquarters of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, Vice Head, Hu Zhenyu had an ugly expression on his face. The main reason was not only because of Immortal Emperor’s lack of respect but more importantly, the fall of Mo Wuji whom he held high hopes for.</p><p>His eyes swept across a young man called Lai Yi before saying faintly, \"Does this mean that if my Pill Dao Immortal Alliance refuse to let Lun Cai act, Lun Cai would go head to head against us? My Pill Dao Immortal Alliance had really not met such an opponent before, someone who would threaten us all the way till our doorsteps.\"</p><p>Lai Yi replied calmly as he bowed, \"Alliance Head Hu’s words are too serious. Since that Mo Wuji was an elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, this meant that he was a part of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance. However, he disregarded the high regards held of him by the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance and actually risked his life to enter the Soul Condensing Immortal Pool and died eventually. This was evidently a display of the lack of appreciation for the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance. Grand Emperor Lun Cai had also mention that as long as the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance allowed us to act against the people around Mo Wuji, the Grand Emperor was willing to take out…\"</p><p>\"Hmph!\" before Lai Yi could finish speaking, Hu Zhenyu let out a cold grunt, \"What? Are you trying to scare my Pill Dao Immortal Alliance with the reputable name of a Grand Emperor? The fact that my Pill Dao Immortal Alliance was able to maintain our foothold in the Immortal World for such a long time was mainly because we were never afraid of threatens.\"</p><p>Lai Yi hurried to respond, \"My Unfettered Emperor Palace always had huge respects for the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance so we would never dare to scare the alliance. Grand Emperor was merely suggesting and it would of course be fine if the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance is not agreeable.\"</p><p>Grand Emperor Lun Cai’s words were naturally not as gentle and polite as how Lai Yi expressed because Lun Cai really did say that he would not be nice if the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance was not willing to show some face to him. Lai Yi would definitely not say the original words of Immortal Emperor Lun Cai because if he did, there would definitely be a upcoming war.</p><p>\"Vice Alliance Head, why don’t you listen to Grand Emperor Lun Cai’s condition?\" An extremely obese man with small eyes walked out and said.</p><p>This obese man, Ren Qian, was also an elder of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance and was a Tier 7 Immortal Emperor. He held a high status in the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance and was only slightly less commanding than the Vice Alliance Head. Among the many elders, he was also the one with the most authority.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
