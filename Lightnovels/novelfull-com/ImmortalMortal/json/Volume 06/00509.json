However, it was true that the Heavenly Desolate Grass was a Tier 5 immortal herb.</p><p>Mo Wuji was still wondering how he could purify the Heavenly Desolate Grass in his head when a white light enveloped him and sent him out of the pill room.</p><p>The moment the light disappeared, Mo Wuji saw his surroundings and knew that his assessment had ended. He was currently at the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Sharphorn Branch’s seventh floor, the same place where he left from.</p><p>\"Pill King Mo, I’m Gong Yi and I’m the Assessment Deacon for the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Sharphorn Branch. Congratulations Brother Mo on becoming the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance’s honored grade Pill King!\" Before Mo Wuji could even react, a middle-aged man with a slightly thin face appeared in front of him and bowed to him. This man’s voice even contained a hint of flattery.</p><p>Mo Wuji recognised this fella, he was one of the two people sitted at the center of the room before the assessment. When Mo Wuji first entered, this fella didn’t even stand up.</p><p>\"Greetings Pill King Mo. My name is He Xingwen and I am also an Asssessment Deacon for the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Sharphorn Branch. Congratulations Brother Mo on attaining the acknowledgement as a Pill Dao Immortal Alliance’s honored grade Pill King.\" The other pill refiner also walked over, bowed, and congratulated Mo Wuji with extreme courtesy.</p><p>When he first came for the assessment, these two didn’t even care about him. But now after his assessment, these two had such a great change in attitude. Mo Wuji, however, did not care too much about it. There were many of such people in the world, this Gong Yi and He Xingwen weren’t the only ones.</p><p>\"Greetings deacons. May I ask, what does a honored grade Pill King mean?\" Mo Wuji clasped his fists and asked.</p><p>Gong Yi had already brought a chair for Mo Wuji to sit down. Then, he explained, \"After passing the Pill Dao Pagoda’s fourth level, you would have already become a Pill King for the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance. Only an extremely rare number of people would be given the ‘honored grade’ title. The condition was that you needed to concoct a full batch of unique grade immortal pills during that assessment. Only then would you earn the title of ‘honored grade’.\"</p><p>He Xingwen added, \"Compared to an ordinary Pill King, a honored grade Pill King would have much greater rewards.\"</p><p>\"What rewards?\" Mo Wuji stood up excitedly. The Pill Dao Immortal Alliance’s rewards should be not bad right?</p><p>Gong Yi hurriedly said, \"For an average Tier 4 Pill King, the alliance would award 50 strains of Tier 5 immortal herbs. Additionally, any pills or ingredients purchased at a Pill Dao Immortal Alliance branch would be at a 20% discount.</p><p>On the other hand, not only would a honored grade Pill King be rewarded 100 strains of Tier 5 immortal herbs, he could also pick an item from the Branch Treasury. He would also be able to enjoy a 50% discount for pills and ingredients purchased at any Pill Dao Immortal Alliance branch. Moreover, the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Headquarters also has other rewards…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji was incomparably elated; this was simply sending him a pillow when he wanted to sleep. The reason why he had yet to become a Tier 5 Pill King, was primarily because he never had the immortal herbs to practise on. If he had Tier 5 immortal herbs previously, he wouldn’t have simply achieved the honored grade Tier 4 level. Instead, he would have been a honored grade Tier 5 Pill King.</p><p>Right at this instant, a glowing light suddenly appeared in the middle of the room. Following which, a faint shadow appeared within the light. The shadow grinned and spoke to Mo Wuji, \"Congratulations Pill King Mo for becoming a honored grade Tier 4 Pill King in my Pill Dao Immortal Alliance. I’m Nong Yong. Even though I’m unable to personally go to Sharphorn Immortal Ruins to congratulate you, I would still like to represent Pill Dao Immortal Alliance to congratulate Pill King Mo. I would now to bestow you your honored grade Tier 4 Pill King identity and the rewards, and at the same time, I would like to invite Pill King Mo to become a honorary elder for my Pill Dao Immortal Alliance.\"</p><p>When Gong Yi and He Xingwen saw this faint shadow, they hurriedly kneeled and said harmoniously, \"Greetings Lord Pill Emperor.\"</p><p>Gong Yi anxiously said to Mo Wuji, \"Pill King Mo, this is our Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Headquarters’ Tier 7 Pill Emperor, Elder Nong Yong.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji hurriedly clasped his fists and bowed, \"Younger Student Mo Wuji greets Senior Nong. Many thanks Senior Nong for your appreciation, Mo Wuji would definitely contribute much to the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance.\"</p><p>Nong Yong had a face full of smiles; he was very satisfied with Mo Wuji's reply, especially the part about \"younger student\" had improved his impression of Mo Wuji.</p><p>He lightly waved his hand and a storage ring had already started to float in front of Mo Wuji. A faint violet jade token also floated in front of Mo Wuji. Mo Wuji hurriedly accepted the storage ring and the jade token, then clasped his fists in gratitude.</p><p>\"Not bad, not bad. When you come to the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Headquarters, you can come and find me.\" With that, Nong Yong's figure flashed and vanished. The light in the hall also disappeared.</p><p>\"Greetings Elder Mo.\" Gong Yi and He Xingwen were now even more courteous and respectful towards Mo Wuji; they could see that Mo Wuji had a bright future ahead of him.</p><p>After Mo Wuji returned the gestures, he hurriedly brought the jade token up for a look.</p><p>At the corner of the jade token, there was the word 'honored’. Then, there was the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance's logo; it was an ancient style pill furnace with a fire on top of it.</p><p>Thereafter, there were the words Tier 4 Pill King. And finally, there was a row of words: Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Honorary Elder.</p><p>Mo Wuji also saw Gong Yi's and He Xingwen's Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Token hung at their waists. However their jade token was orange in colour and it said Tier 2 Pill Monarch.</p><p>Being an honored grade was pretty solid; he hadn't even done anything for the alliance but he had already received a reward. Furthermore, the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance was simply a leviathan. Now that he had the status of its honorary elder, no matter how godly that Blade Scar Mountain was, it still wouldn't dare mess with him, right? Only that Yong Ying Immortal Domain's Heavenly Emperor still posed a problem to him. He didn't know whether his title as a honored grade Tier 4 Pill King would be enough to fend off a Heavenly Emperor. Of course, the best thing would be for the Heavenly Emperor to not even know of him.</p><p>Just when Mo Wuji wanted to take a look at what was inside the storage ring, three cultivators walked into the seventh floor.</p><p>The person right at the front was a man with almond-shaped eyes. This man was very tall, he was more than an entire head taller than Mo Wuji. Based on this fella’s aura, Mo Wuji could tell that this fella’s cultivation was much, much higher than his; at least, he wasn’t even able to discern this fella’s cultivation level. Mo Wuji had met Murong Xiangyu’s master, and he felt that this person’s cultivation was even higher than Murong Xiangyu’s master.</p><p>Behind the almond eyed man, there was healthy looking elder. Even though he had some wrinkles on his face, his beard and hair were all black. His entire body seemed to exude pill aura; clearly, he was an incredible pill refiner. Beside this elder, there was a pretty woman.</p><p>This woman did not have any sort of pill aura, but she had some other kind of quality that made her feel like an extreme expert.</p><p>\"Greetings President Shang, Pill King Gu and Manager Guo.\" The moment the three entered, Gong Yi and He Xingwen immediately bowed respectfully.</p><p>The almond eyed man chuckled as he clasped his fists towards Mo Wuji, \"Congratulations Pill King Mo for obtaining the title of Pill Dao Immortal Alliance’s Honored Graded Tier 4 Pill King. It is also by Sharphorn Branch’s honor that Pill King Mo was willing to have your assessment here in our branch. Come, come, let us introduce ourselves to Pill King Mo. My name is Shang Yu, I’m the Second President for the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Sharphorn Branch. Because the First President, Brother Zhang Xixu is behind closed doors, he is unable to personally come and congratulate you.\"</p><p>As he finished that sentence, Shang Yu pointed at the healthy elder and the woman and said, \"This is my Sharphorn Branch’s number one Pill King, Gu Shunan. He is an existence that is infinitesimally close to the Tier 7 Pill Emperor level. The other person is my Sharphorn Branch’s Manager Guo Qi.\"</p><p>Even though Gu Shunan was a Tier 6 Pill King infinitesimally close to the Tier 7 Pill Emperor level, he was still especially courteous as he clasped his fists to Mo Wuji and said, \"Pill King Mo was easily able to become a Honored Grade Tier 4 Pill King at such a young age, your future is clearly limitless. Ever since the inception of our Sharphorn Branch, Pill King Mo is our very first Honored Grade Pill King.\"</p><p>Guo Qi also smiled sweetly and clasped her fists towards Mo Wuji, \"Pill King Mo’s future is limitless. In the future, we will have to depend on you.\"</p><p>The moment Mo Wuji heard their introductions, he knew that they were all big shots of the Sharphorn Branch. However, he did not believe that an ordinary Tier 4 Pill King would warrant such attention and courtesy, even the Second President and the number one pill king in the branch was here.</p><p>The reason why these people were here was definitely because of the ‘Honored Grade’. It was just as Gu Shunan said, he was a person with unlimited potential.</p><p>Mo Wuji was also very clear that his status was still far from the people in front of him. He hurriedly clasped his fists and said respectfully, \"Seniors are too courteous. Mo Wuji greets President Shang, Pill King Gu and Manager Guo. Junior is still learning, I will still have to look to all of you for help in the future.\"</p><p>Guo Qi snickered, \"Pill King Mo, you are already a honorary elder of the Headquarters, there’s no need to call us seniors. If you look up to us, then calling me Sister Guo is enough. I still have to depend on you in the future.\"</p><p>Shang Yu chuckled, \"Pill King Mo, Junior Sister Guo is right; it’s best if we address ourselves without seniority. I have also come here to become an elder at my Sharphorn Branch. This is not a honorary elder title, but an actual one.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji’s heart pounded and he immediately said, \"President Shang, my cultivation is limited. Aren’t I still lacking too much to be an elder?\"</p><p>Shang Yu waved his hand, \"A Honored Grade Pill King has the privelege to be an elder at any branch of the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance. If I don’t act now, you might even be pulled away by some other branch. Brother Mo, if you look up to this big brother here, then let’s walk hard together for Sharphorn.\"</p><p>After saying that, Shang Yu turned his head to Gong Yi, \"Gong Yi, later bring Pill King Mo to my Sharphorn Branch’s best treasury. Let him choose three treasures, these would be my Sharphorn Branch’s welcoming gift.\"</p><p>\"Yes!\" Gong Yi bowed as he responded; his voice was filled with agitation. Now that he had the chance, he would need to score some points with Elder Mo.</p><p>At such a time, Mo Wuji naturally wouldn’t say any pretentious words. He immediately clasped his fists and expressed his gratitude.</p><p>\"Brother Mo can first pick your things, then have a good rest. When the time comes, I will hold a grand welcoming dinner for you in the best hotel in Sharphorn Immortal Ruins.\" Shang Yu’s words left one feeling as though he was cleansed by the Spring Wind. Even though Mo Wuji knew that he was only trying to pull the relations closer, Mo Wuji could not help but praise Shang Yu’s elegant manner of doing things.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
