Very soon after, he realised the extremely bad state his body was in.</p><p>Mo Wuji took out a Tier 5 immortal pill and placed it into the cultivator’s mouth before saying, \"If I didn’t rescue you, you would have been dead. Please tell us what happened to you?\"</p><p>The cultivator was finally stabilised as he looked at Mo Wuji and then the other cultivators around him, took a deep breath before saying in a calm tone, \"There is a Golden House in front which is emitting golden light all around it. The house was full of peak grade pills, magic treasures, techniques…\"</p><p>The cultivator only spoke till here before his lips revealed a strange smile. Mo Wuji sensed that something was amiss but before he could do anything, this cultivator fell to the ground with blood flowing out even from the corner of his eyes as his expression turned black, dead.</p><p>Mo Wuji raised his hand and a flame turned this cultivator into flying ashes. Mo Wuji was surprised at the strength of the dao as all he saw was the cultivator depleting vitality and primordial spirit. What he didn’t notice was that this cultivator was already severely poisoned. When he touched the cultivator, Mo Wuji only managed to stabilise his primordial spirit but because his detoxification channel had no reaction, he didn’t even think that this cultivator would have the toxin in him.</p><p>This toxin must not be simple because even his detoxification channel wasn’t able to sense it immediately.</p><p>\"Big Brother Mo, what happened?\" Zuo Yixian hurried forward to inquire as the rest of the cultivators came closer to find out what had happened too.</p><p>Mo Wuji said discreetly, \"According to this person, there should be a Golden House with a lot of good items in front. My guess is that one shouldn’t enter this house and the moment one enters, one would end up like him. Additionally, there is even a strong toxic in this Golden House so we must not touch anyone who comes out from this Golden House.\"</p><p>\"So are we going out now?\" Another cultivator asked.</p><p>Mo Wuji nodded, \"We can’t stay here for long so we have to leave sooner or later. When we are out, everyone please try to stick closer to each other so we can look out for one another.\"</p><p>\"When are we leaving?\" Another cultivator from the crowd asked.</p><p>\"There is no hurry. We shall wait for the fog to retreat once more before leaving,\" Mo Wuji’s eyes fell on Zuo Yixian and called out, \"Yixian, since you address me as a big brother, I shall not stand on any ceremony with you.\"</p><p>Zuo Yixian had been cultivating since day one and was even a Star Grade Genius so now that Mo Wuji said something like this, he knew that Mo Wuji needed his help with something so he replied instantly, \"As long as it is within my capabilities, Big Brother Mo can assign me to any task.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji chuckled, \"Don’t worry, it is not so serious as I just wanted to ask some questions. Your status in Yong Ying Immortal Domain should be quite decent right?\"</p><p>Zuo Yixian responded, \"Yes, I am the young castellan of the Sea Canopy Immortal City and the Sea Canopy Immortal City is considered a Heavenly Emperor city out of all the Yong Ying Immortal Cities so we are indeed quite powerful.\"</p><p>\"Alright, I shall ask you a few questions then. The first question is do you know about the immortal lattice stones?\" Mo Wuji did not rush to ask the second question because the reason why he could even ask this question was due to the status he had now.</p><p>After asking this question, Mo Wuji looked towards the rest of the cultivators, \"Everyone can wait at the entrance of the array and the moment I settle things here, I will bring everyone out.\"</p><p>The majority of them were interested in the conversation but didn’t continue standing there as most of them retreated to the entrance as per instructed by Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji noticed that other than Murong Xiangyu, a round face cultivator didn’t retreat like the rest of them. Just as Mo Wuji was about to ask him, the round face cultivator clasped his fist and said to Mo Wuji, \"Big Brother Mo, I am Cang Heng, a disciple of the Virtual Qing Dao. I have some understandings of the immortal lattice stones so I stayed behind to answer Big Brother Mo’s question.\"</p><p>Zuo Yixian, who was standing by Mo Wuji’s side, hurried to explain, \"Big Brother Mo, the Virtual Qing Dao that Cang Heng is in is one of biggest few sects in the Yong Ying Immortal Domain. Senior Sister Nong Xiaoyu of the same sect was already in the intermediate Grand Yi Stage. As an Eight Star Genius, she was one of the peak talents of the Yong Ying Immortal Domain. In fact, the Virtual Qing Dao was located in the Yong Ying Immortal City so Cang Heng would naturally know more about the immortal lattice stones than I do.\"</p><p>Murong Xiangyu hurried to explain too, \"I know a bit of the immortal lattice stones too which was why I stayed behind too.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t have any objections as he carried on, \"Since this is the case, can someone start explaining more about the immortal lattice stones?\"</p><p>Cang Heng took the initiative to speak, \"Let me start by stating something all the Heavenly Immortal Stage experts know. Without the immortal lattice, one wouldn’t be able to move on from the Heavenly Immortal Stage and the immortal lattice is a person’s way of Immortal Dao. Only after condensing the immortal lattice, a person’s Dao would be able to have a direction and an objective. In other words, one would have the true foundation of Immortal Dao. Immortal lattice stones were the most basic method for many Heavenly Immortals to condense their immortal lattice. The immortal lattice stone contains a type of heavenly dao energy so as long as one uses immortal lattice stones to condense the immortal lattice, one would be able to feel the nature’s immortal way easily.</p><p>However, it was very rare to get immortal lattice stones as most of the immortal lattice stones came from the Half Immortal Domain. I’ve heard that a few Half Immortal Domains had fallen and turned into Immortal Chasm which made immortal lattice stones even rarer.\"</p><p>\"So all of you used immortal lattice stones to condense your immortal lattice too?\" Mo Wuji asked.</p><p>Zuo Yixian replied, \"No, those with greater qualifications and status would normally not use immortal lattice stones to condense their immortal lattice.\"</p><p>\"Why not?\" Mo Wuji blurted.</p><p>Zuo Yixian explained, \"This was because the origins of the immortal lattice stones was very mysterious. Rumours were that it came from the condensation of Dao insights of the ancient men of God. The moment someone used immortal lattice stones to condense his immortal lattice, he would have someone else Dao insights imprinted on him. It would not be consequential for cultivators with lower cultivation level but it would be problematic for stronger experts to advance even further if they were to be influenced by someone else’s Dao insights.\"</p><p>After pausing for a moment, Zuo Yixian continued, \"Therefore, for most of us here, we feel for and be enlightened by nature’s laws of heavenly dao before using peak grade cultivation resources to condense our immortal lattice. Of course, it would be extremely tough to condense your immortal lattice using this method as one would need to have a certain power of understanding as well as great wealth. One cannot afford to lack either one of this condition.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji felt a thump in his heart as some of his friends used immortal lattice stones to condense their immortal lattice.</p><p>\"The second question. Do any of you know about the Yong Ying Prison?\" Mo Wuji didn’t continue asking about the immortal lattice stones as he inquired about the Yong Ying Prison immediately. He had long wanted to ask this question but simply couldn’t find someone with great understanding of the Yong Ying Immortal Domain.</p><p>At the instance Mo Wuji asked this question, Zuo Yixian and Cang Heng’s expressions changed and even Murong Xiangyu’s expression turned strange.</p><p>Mo Wuji lifted his hand and set up a sound insulation restriction before saying in a solemn voice, \"If the few of you think that it is tough answering this question of mine, you can pretend that you didn’t hear it. However, if you treat me as your friend, please answer me.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji judged others based on how he would treat others. If he treated Zuo Yixian and co. as friends and if they were to ask him this question, he would not hesitate to answer them. If Zuo Yixian and co. were not willing to answer, he would stop asking. At the same time, he wouldn’t continue treating the few of them as his true friends and would part with them after they made it out of here.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t have many cunning plots when it came to making friends. If he could help, he would help and friends who only wanted benefits from him should stay far away from him.</p><p>Cang He stood out, \"I shall answer this as I know slightly more about this matter than Brother Zuo and Senior Sister Murong. The truth was that other than the big war, the decline of the Yong Ying Immortal Domain was also due to the lack of reserve geniuses.\"</p><p>Cang He was much more experienced than Murong Xiangyu but because of Mo Wuji, he even addressed Murong Xiangyu as Senior Sister Murong.</p><p>Since this was the case, shouldn’t we protect those geniuses who rose up from the cultivation world? Why lock them in the prison?\" Mo Wuji furrowed his brows.</p><p>Cang He sighed, \"The problem lies here. Most of the geniuses, who rose up to the Yong Ying Immortal Domain, with no exception were disciples of those big sects. They cultivate in the Yong Ying Immortal Domain as they received a large amount of cultivation resources. After they reached a certain standard, they would leave the Yong Ying Immortal Domain in search of their own sect. In most instances, most of the sects don’t belong in the Yong Ying Immortal Domain.</p><p>These genius disciples had terrifying talents and the rate of cultivation was faster than anyone else. After they found their own sect, the rate at which they grew stronger was even faster. Occasionally, the various immortal domains would have a war to fight for resources and just like this Broken World, there would definitely be more of such wars in the future. The homegrown genius cultivators and some disciples with potentials of the Yong Ying Immortal Domain would normally die in the hands of these experts who rose up from the cultivation world.</p><p>These cultivators who rose up from the cultivation world were vicious, heartless and decisive in their methods of killing and they were definitely way stronger than the homegrown geniuses. Thousands of years ago, there was a Star Grade Genius called Huang Sha and he was one who rose to the Yong Ying Immortal Domain from the cultivation world. However, he was a disciple of the Great Sword Path of the Zero Heaven Immortal Domain. After he reached the Xuan Immortal Stage in the Yong Ying Immortal Domain, he entered his Great Sword Path in the Luo Ling Immortal Domain. During a battle in a secret domain, he single-handedly killed 317 genius disciples of the Yong Ying Immortal Domain causing the Yong Ying Immortal Domain to suffer a great damage to their overall elemental energy.</p><p>As time passed, Yong Ying Immortal Domain got weaker and weaker and if this continued, the domain would be swallowed by other domains very soon. Therefore, the Yong Ying Heavenly Emperor and many sect heads of the peak sects discussed and decided to let cultivators who soared up from the world of cultivation to enter the Half Immortal Domain. In fact, the Half Immortal Domain has existed for many years and those who entered the Half Immortal Domain used to have opportunities to enter the Yong Ying Immortal Domain. They were only restricted many years later. The moment they were met with genius graded Four Star and above, they would be sent straight to the Yong Ying Prison.\"</p><p>\"Will those who make a blood oath in the Yong Ying Prison be released?\" Mo Wuji was started to understand.</p><p>Cang Heng sighed once more, \"It was indeed like what you’ve said. Those who made a blood oath to fight for Yong Ying Immortal Domain or to be a spy in their own sects for the Yong Ying Immortal Domain would be released to live for the Yong Ying Immortal Domain for all their life. However, most of the star grade geniuses were arrogant and proud individuals so they would never make such a vow as it would mean that they would constrain their Immortal Dao. Most of their concerns were not that they had to fight for their own sect but because they were not willing to constrain their Immortal Dao.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji still didn’t understand as he asked again, \"Even if the Yong Ying Prison was hidden by the Yong Ying Immortal Domain, the Half Immortal Domain was not something that could stay hidden so why hadn’t the other Immortal Domains come forward to intervene?\"</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
