If you can’t get over a small ditch, how will you be able to achieve the Great Dao? Let me make the decision, you and Xiangyu can go to the Broken World together with this Yan Ye. When you emerge, you will naturally understand the meaning behind my words today.\"</p><p>\"Yes, master.\" Qiao Qianyan bowed as he responded.</p><p>Mo Wuji cursed in this heart; this old bastard actually likened him to a ditch!</p><p>The purple robed woman handed a jade token over to Murong Xiangyu, \"Xiangyu, you can bring Yan Ye up with you to the ship. Yan Ye is not inside the namelist, so if anyone asks you, take this jade token out. Due to the Heavenly Emperor’s matter, Dao Friend Tu and I will have to stay here to handle somethings.\"</p><p>\"Yes. Many thanks, master.\" Murong Xiangyu accepted the jade token and bowed respectfully.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t say anything; now, he had to wholeheartedly act in front of Murong Xiangyu.</p><p>\"Go on then. Let’s not delay any further.\" The purple robed woman waved her hand towards Murong Xiangyu.</p><p>Murong Xiangyu bowed once more, then turned and left the hall. Qiao Qianyan took the first step and hurried to walk beside Murong Xiangyu.</p><p>Mo Wuji was now like a little attendant, as he followed along from the back. In the corner of her eye, Murong Xiangyu glanced towards Mo Wuji and sighed in her heart. She started to suspect that Mo Wuji was placing the wild wishes, that he had towards Ji Yue, on her. If that’s really the case, she could only say that Yan Ye was bringing trouble onto himself.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t care about what any of them were thinking. In his mind, he only wanted to say: The two people in front, can’t you walk a little faster?</p><p>Fortunately, Murong Xiangyu didn’t waste any time. The moment the left the encampment, she immediately fetched her flying ship and said to Qiao Qianyan and Mo Wuji, \"Senior Brother Qiao and Yan Ye can board my ship.\"</p><p>Qiao Qianyan hurriedly expressed his thanks and went up on Murong Xiangyu’s ship. Mo Wuji also didn’t dally around as he hurriedly boarded too.</p><p>Murong Xiangyu’s flying ship flashed into a shadow, charging out from the Lifeless Secret Domain area, and disappearing into the distance.</p><p>Without any further orders from the Heavenly Emperor, no one dared to stop a ship of the Supreme Dao Sect.</p><p>…</p><p>The flying ship moved speedily throughout the journey. Murong Xiangyu stood at the bow of the ship, staring into the vast starry sky in front of her; it was unknown what she was thinking.</p><p>Qiao Qianyan was standing beside Murong Xiangyu, speaking to her in a soft volume.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t want to incite the hatred of Qiao Qianyan, so he simply went to the stern of the ship. As for the ship’s compartments, he didn’t intend to enter them.</p><p>He didn’t know what kind of place the Broken World was, but in his heart, he was thinking whether it was possible if he went off by himself. But if he were to get noticed by the Heavenly Emperor of an Immortal Domain, then things wouldn’t be good.</p><p>Mo Wuji didn’t know what Murong Xiangyu and Qiao Qianyan were chatting about, nor was he interested. Now, he was only thinking about the Broken World. Apparently, there were people from other Immortal Domains going to the Broken World, and Murong Xiangyu’s master had also said that the Broken World wasn’t in Yong Ying Immortal Domain. Whether or not Yong Ying Immortal Domain’s Heavenly Emperor got wind of him, it was best for him to get as far away as possible from Yong Ying.</p><p>Half a day later, Mo Wuji cast all these thoughts aside and brought out some intermediate grade immortal crystals to start cultivating.</p><p>This was the Immortal World; even without immortal crystals, the surrounding immortal spiritual energy was more than ten times that of the Corner of Yong Ying.</p><p>The moment he started cultivating, Mo Wuji soon forgot about the flow of time.</p><p>It was also after some unknown period of time, he was awoken by Murong Xiangyu, \"Yan Ye, we’re already here. Follow me to the big ship.\"</p><p>Only then did Mo Wuji discover that Murong Xiangyu’s flying ship was now parked in a huge plaza, and in the centre of the plaza, there was a gigantic flying ship. How was this a flying ship? This was simply a moving city. Moreover, the plaza itself was like an immortal city; it was protected by a defensive array that even Mo Wuji’s spiritual will couldn’t penetrate.</p><p>\"Junior Brother Yan sure is hardworking. Even during our journey, you didn’t forget to cultivate,\" Qiao Qianyan spoke to Mo Wuji the moment Mo Wuji disembarked the flying ship; his tone even contained some hints of admiration.</p><p>Regardless of whether Qiao Qianyan’s expression was sincere, Mo Wuji definitely didn’t believe that Qiao Qianyan would respect him. He didn’t want to say anything, so he simply smiled in response.</p><p>\"Junior Brother Yan, everyone on this void ship is a peak genius from Yong Ying Immortal Domain, and there are even some absolute experts. Remember to be careful with both your words and actions, and don’t cause trouble. To these people, we’re merely small fry.\" Seeing Mo Wuji remain silent, Qiao Qianyan continued to give him a serious instruction.</p><p>Mo Wuji knew that the other party was referring to him when he talked about ‘small fry’. Whether it was Qiao Qianyan or Murong Xiangyu, they were both Six Star Geniuses. Naturally, they weren’t small fry. Thus, he said indifferently, \"Small fry like me have my own small methods. There’s no need for you to worry.\"</p><p>Murong Xiangyu glanced at Mo Wuji; even though she didn’t actually meet with Yan Ye for many times, she seemed to feel that this Yan Ye in front of her was different from the Yan ye she remembered. While he spoke passionately while in front of her master, she did not think that he would still be so resilient during normal interactions.</p><p>Whether it was status, appearance, or talent, Yan Ye was 108,000 li [1] away from Qiao Qianyan; when he interacts with Qiao Qianyan, he should be acting submissively. However, not only did he not have any hint of submission, Yan Ye was neither haughty nor humble as he spoke to Qiao Qianyan.</p><p>\"Yan Ye, follow closely behind me. Otherwise, you would be able to board the ship.\" Murong Xiangyu couldn’t make sense of these questions, so she rather not think of them. She indifferently instructed Mo Wuji, then went up on the ship.</p><p>\"How long till the ship moves?\" Mo Wuji couldn’t be bothered to call her \"Junior Sister Xiangyu\", this sort of action would disgust himself. They were merely using one another, so there was no need to address each other by terms like ‘junior sister’. Murong Xiangyu wanted to use him, so he was also using her. By the time they reached the Broken World, the two of them could walk on their lovey-dovey bridge, while he would walk on his broad and open road.</p><p>\"There’s still half a month.\" Murong Xiangyu didn’t seem to care that Mo Wuji didn’t address her.</p><p>Indeed, there were two cultivators conducting identification checks as they boarded the flying ship; Murong Xiangyu and Qiao Qianyan both took their own identity jade tokens out. Before those two cultivators could question Mo Wuji, Murong Xiangyu proactively took her master’s jade token and said, \"Yan Ye is also invited by my Supreme Dao Sect, and will be following me to the Broken World.\"</p><p>That cultivator nodded and didn’t say anything further, simply allowing the three of them onto the ship. He even gave a jade token to Murong Xiangyu. For bigger sects like the Supreme Dao Sect and the One Sword Sect, there was some room for leeway. Moreover, Murong Xiangyu’s master was considered a renowned figure, and was also a Summit Lord of the Supreme Dao Sect; so this was within her power.</p><p>Murong Xiangyu glanced at the jade token in her hands, then handed it to Mo Wuji, \"If there’s nothing important, try not to leave the ship. Because you are an additional passenger, your room is one of the low-grade compartments. This ship will be traversing across the Immortal Domain Void, so it will take at least half a year.\"</p><p>\"Many thanks.\" Mo Wuji hurriedly accepted the jade token. There was no need to talk about a low-grade room, he would be satisfied with a storeroom.</p><p>Regardless, not only did Murong Xiangyu bring him out of Yong Ying Immortal Domain, she even found him a room. Thus, Mo Wuji was still extremely grateful to her.</p><p>Murong Xiangyu didn’t respond to Mo Wuji. After handing Mo Wuji the jade token, she directly left with Qiao Qianyan to the high-grade compartments.</p><p>Mo Wuji looked at the jade token in his hand: Low-Grade Compartment D, Room 3770. With his fastest speed, he located his room, opened the door, and rushed in.</p><p>Even if Murong Xiangyu hadn’t reminded him, he wouldn’t have casually left his room. He was mired in danger all the way till this ship leaves.</p><p>Even though he had already entered his room, Mo Wuji was still feeling anxious and worried; he didn’t know whether his choice was right. By entering this gigantic ship, he was sealing all his paths of retreat. If the Heavenly Emperor managed to track him from the Lifeless Secret Domain, then he could only resign to his fate.</p><p>The low-grade compartment room was extremely small; Mo Wuji estimated that it was roughly 10 square meters. There wasn’t anything in the room, merely a simple screening restriction.</p><p>Mo Wuji added his own spiritual will screen, then took a futon out and started cultivating. In this sort of place, it was best to be as low profile as possible.</p><p>…</p><p>Half a months passed in a flash. When the flying ship started to shake into motion, Mo Wuji finally heaved a sigh of relief. From the looks of it, Yong Ying Immortal Domain’s Heavenly Emperor hadn’t identified him. As long as this ship leaves Yong Ying Immortal Domain, he would no longer have to be worried.</p><p>Mo Wuji carefully scanned outwards with his spiritual will. Even though he was in a low grade compartment room, he could still detect that the ship had already rushed into space.</p><p>Now that he could finally be relieved, Mo Wuji started to install all sorts of arrays and restrictions. Previously, the ship hadn’t moved, so he couldn’t be too extravagant. Now that he was going to cultivate wholeheartedly, he would naturally have to install some defensive arrays.</p><p>After spending two days, the entire array system in the room had been ramped up; there was even a monitor array. Only then, did Mo Wuji take out a huge pile of high-grade immortal crystals and immortal pills and started cultivating.</p><p>Now, he urgently needed to raise his power. Naturally, he would use whatever he can. If not for the fact that he might cause some displeasure, he would have even installed a spirit gathering array.</p><p>[1] This is the distance travelled during the Journey to the West.
