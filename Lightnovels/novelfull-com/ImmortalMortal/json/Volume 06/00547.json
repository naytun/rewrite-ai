The second round should be a pill concocting competition; he wasn't even able to concoct an intermediate grade Tier 6 pill, so his points would definitely be dragged down. If he didn't get enough points in the first round, he would very likely be kicked out after the second round.</p><p>Mo Wuji saw that the display screen had already showed the 300th placing. Participating City - Intermediate Grade City, Wind Plains Immortal City; Participating Pill Refiner - Ma Tian. Points: 90.112. Advanced into the second round.</p><p>Mo Wuji was inwardly celebrating in his heart; celebrating that he had his own unique methods of purifying herbs. Otherwise, he would already have been eliminated in the first round.</p><p>As a pill refiner, Mo Wuji knew that it was already relatively impressive to refine the Jade Pomegranate Immortal Grass to 90%. Even though the difficulty of purifying the Jade Pomegranate Immortal Grass could not be compared to the Heavenly Desolate Grass, its difficulty was renowned among immortal herbs below Tier 7. Even many Tier 6 herbs weren't as difficult to purify as the Jade Pomegranate Immortal Grass.</p><p>However, a person almost got eliminated despite exceeding 90%. Even though he wasn't eliminated, he was the 300th place and was on the fringe of being eliminated.</p><p>\"Father, Brother Mo's name still hasn't appeared. That means that our Water Ying Immortal City gas entered the top 300 in the first round. Even if he doesn't participate in the second round, we would still retain our low grade immortal city position.\" Seeing the 300th placing come out, Wen Lianxi almost stood up in her excitement.</p><p>She was especially anxious when it came to her Water Ying Immortal City's results.</p><p>Wen Hou tightly clenched his fists; the excitement on his face exceeded his daughter's.</p><p>If not for the fact that the number of the people left on the stage tallies with the placings, he would have suspected that this was fake.</p><p>\"Impressive, truly impressive. I truly didn't judge him wrongly, this person's potential simply cannot be measured…\" Tan Liang stared at Mo Wuji and muttered to himself.</p><p>\"Uncle Tan, do you think Brother Mo can enter the top 50?\" Unconsciously, Wen Lianxi clenched both her fists tightly. Even though she wanted to calm herself down, the agitation in her voice couldn't be concealed.</p><p>Tan Liang took in a deep breath, \"Entering the top 50 might be very difficult. Even if he were to enter the top 50 now, it would still be impossible for him to obtain that in the end. Because the second round will be a pill concoction round; pill concoction is very different from purification. A low tiered pill refiner would be able to purify an immortal herb to a high degree, if he has exceptional talent. However, even if he has incredible luck, a low tiered pill refiner would never be able to concoct a higher tiered immortal pill. The results can't be cheated, and luck simply won't help much.</p><p>Your friend is able to purify the Jade Pomegranate Immortal Grass to above 90%, that is extremely, extremely impressive. It's something that I can never compare to. It wouldn't be an impossibility that he would surpass average Pill Emperors in the future. Do you know that Pill Master Ma Tian that just got 300th place? He is actually a Tier 6 Pill King, and even among Tier 6 Pill Kings, he is among the top.\"</p><p>Wen Hou glanced at the conversing pair and an idea, which was the same as his wife's, popped up in his head. If this Mo Wuji could become his son-in-law, how good would that be?</p><p>This display screen had already showed the 294th place: Participating Immortal City - Low Grade City, Lightning River Immortal City; Participating Pill Refiner - Fei Yuan. Points: 90.216. Advanced into the second round.</p><p>293rd place: Participating Immortal City - High Grade City, Lu Yun Immortal City; Participating Pill Refiner, Gong Ke. Points: 90.219. Advanced into the second round.</p><p>…</p><p>Ever since the 2000th placing, the point difference between contestants was extremely small. Even those that aren't pill refiners know that this was expected; in the purification of immortal herbs, even a minuscule raise in purity was a difficult challenge. Some pill refiners would never be able to increase the purity from 90% to 91% in their entire lives. Sometimes, this sort of purification could not be improved simply because of practice.</p><p>There were only 300 people left on the competition area. Knowing that they have advanced to the second round, some of the pill refiners heaved a sigh of relief and starting sizing up the other pill refiners around them.</p><p>Usually, pill refiners that managed to get to the final 300 were basically the top among the top; most of them recognised each other.</p><p>Mo Wuji's young and unfamiliar place instantly caught the attention of some of the relieved pill refiners. Who was he? He was able to get into the top 300 at such a young age?</p><p>These pill refiners tried to search for Mo Wuji's name on the display screen but when the looked, they only saw familiar names.</p><p>The display screen was already at the 120th name: Participating Immortal City - Intermediate Grade City, True Cliff Immortal City; Participating Pill Refiner - Ao Xilun. Points: 91.051. Advanced into the second round.</p><p>Even the 120th place had appeared but there were still no unfamiliar names. Many of the pill refiners started to discuss among themselves; who was Mo Wuji? He was actually able to get into the top 120.</p><p>When Mo Wuji saw the 120th place True Cliff Immortal City, he suddenly recalled that this he knew this immortal city. There was a young castellan called Zhong Zhen who he met in the Lifeless Secret Domain. That guy was not bad and helped him once. Seeing that True Cliff Immortal City managed to get 120th in the first round, Mo Wuji was also happy for Zhong Zhen.</p><p>Names continued to show up on the display screen. It was now at the 51st place: Participating Immortal City - High Grade City Lu Jie Immortal City; Participating Pill Refiner - Yuan Feng. Points: 91.671. Advanced into the second round.</p><p>…</p><p>11th place: Participating Immortal City - High Grade City, Sea Canopy Immortal City; Participating Pill Refiner - Chai Xiao. Points: 91.899. Advanced into the second round.</p><p>Sea Canopy Immortal City, yet another familiar immortal city. Mo Wuji knew Sea Canopy Immortal City’s young castellan, Zuo Yixian. That Zuo Yixian was also not bad, and his Sea Canopy Immortal City actually got 11th place in the first round. As long as Zuo Yixian came back from the Broken World, he would definitely come back to Sea Canopy Immortal City. Perhaps, he could visit Zuo Yixian after this competition was over.</p><p>The display screen was already at the 7th place: Participating Immortal City - High Grade City, Ping Yi Immortal City; Participating Pill Refiner - Liu Tiao. Points: 92.232. Advanced into the second round.</p><p>6th place: Participating Immortal City - Intermediate Grade City, Red Emperor Immortal City; Participating Pill Refiner - Fei Gao. Points: 92.301. Advanced into the second round.</p><p>5th place: Participating Immortal City - High Grade City, Bai Ding Immortal City; Participating Pill Refiner - Kuang Zhiyao. Points: 92.411. Advanced into the second round.</p><p>…</p><p>By this point, whether it was the pill refiners on the stage, the pill refiners off the stage, or anyone who understands the situation, could not help but be engaged in their own discussions.</p><p>Almost everyone who didn't know Mo Wuji was now casting their eyes on him. This was because they knew who was that 5th place. Kuang Zhiyao, a half step Pill Emperor from the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance. At a place where almost all the experts in Pill Dao in the entire congregate, it wasn't particularly astonished for a half step Pill Emperor to obtain 5th place. What left everyone astonished was that a person that everyone didn't recognise, Mo Wuji, still hadn't had his name appear on the display screen yet. This unreasonably young fella was actually an existence in the top 4?</p><p>\"Who is he? He actually entered the top 4? He surpassed Senior Kuang?\"</p><p>\"Could something have gone wrong with the display screen? Or is there a problem in the grading array?\"</p><p>A few eliminated pill refiners stood up in agitation. If there was a problem in the grading array, that would mean that the first round was faulted and everyone could compete again.</p><p>There was no need to talk about those pill refiners, even the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance's Vice Alliance Head Hu Zhenyu was staring at Mo Wuji in astonishment. He also didn't recognise Mo Wuji, and he knew that Mo Wuji's name had yet to appear.</p><p>As for the display screen, he knew that there definitely wouldn't be a fault.</p><p>\"Father, could there have been something wrong? Brother Mo’s name still hasn't appeared.\" If Wen Lianxi was pleasantly surprised previously, then now, she was in slight fear.</p><p>Wen Hou was also confused. He, himself, did not believe that Mo Wuji would perform better than a renowned half step Pill Emperor.</p><p>Tan Liang stared at the huge display screen before he said hesitatingly, \"That might not be the case. One must know that this Master Mo previously purified a Tier 8 spiritual herb to 100%...\"</p><p>Tan Liang directly raised Mo Wuji to Master Mo Wuji.</p><p>\"But that's a Tier 8 spiritual herb, a thing of the cultivation world. Now, we're talking about one of the hardest immortal herbs to purify in the Immortal World, the Jade Pomegranate Immortal Grass…\"</p><p>Wen Hou stopped speaking, because the 4th place just appeared.</p><p>4th place: Participating Immortal City - Intermediate Grade City, Saint Glass Immortal City; Participating Pill Refiner - Wu Yunsheng. Points: 96.009. Advanced into the second round.</p><p>The moment this name appeared, the entire area, both on and off stage, went into a buzz.</p><p>There was a huge qualitative jump between the 4th and 5th place; 5th place Kuang Zhiyao only got a little more than 92 points but 4th place We Yunsheng actually got more than 96 points.</p><p>One must know that in the purification of immortal herbs, every increase in 0.X was already a huge improvement; there was no need to talk about 4 whole points. Moreover, the higher the purity, the harder it was to improve.</p><p>However, no one felt that this was a problem, because Wu Yunsong was a true Pill Emperor; he was one of the few Pill Emperors that did not belong to the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance.</p><p>Even though Kuang Zhiyao was a half step Pill Emperor, he was still a distance away from a true Pill Emperor.</p><p>\"He surpassed a Pill Emperor, he actually surpassed a true Pill Emperor…\"</p><p>Because of the murmurs of discussion, even those people who didn’t know the situation now knew that there was a young pill refiner in the competition area that still hadn’t had his name appear on the display screen. This sort of thing was extraordinary, how could anyone not take notice of Mo Wuji now?</p><p>Even though many eyes were on him, Mo Wuji remained calm; he had completely no fear. Even though the Jade Pomegranate Immortal Grass was hard to purify, he had displayed his full capabilities in this competition. If not for the competition limits on the fire, he would have even brought out his Scholar’s Heart.</p><p>3rd place: Participating Immortal City - High Grade City, Lu Jie Immortal City; Participating Pill Refiner - Heng Jun. Points: 96.163. Advanced into the second round.</p><p>Heng Jun was also a Pill Emperor, but Heng Jun was a Pill Dao Immortal Alliance’s Pill Emperor. By this point, everyone was already numb. An unknown young man had actually exceeded two Pill Emperors. Now, only two names were left: one was this young man, while the other was another Pill Dao Immortal Alliance’s Pill Emperor, Gong Yangxue.</p><p>No one believed that Mo Wuji could really enter the top 2. In some of the audiences’ hearts, they were wondering how the organising committee was going to fix this mess.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
