The first two levels of the Broken World have already been opened and can be entered at any time. Even though many people have already went in, the first two levels still remain places where many people continue to go to. They have all sorts of treasures in the first two level, and there were all sorts of cultivators that stream in and out of them everyday. The third level of the Broken World would open half a year later. The reason why so many geniuses have gathered at Sharphorn Immortal Ruins is because they're waiting to go to the third level.\"</p><p>\"Does that mean that Grand Yi Immortals aren't able to enter the third level?\" Mo Wuji asked curiously.</p><p>Gong Yi answered, \"Only when it first opens. One year after the third level opens, Grand Yi Immortals would be able to enter it. For example, anyone can go to the first and second level of the Broken World. However, within the first year that the third level opens, only cultivators at the Xuan Immortal Stage and below would be able to enter.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji came to an understanding; even though he was not a Xuan Immortal, he would be able to enter the third level. The moment he exceeds the Xuan Immortal Stage, he would no longer be able to do so.</p><p>\"If I want to go to the Broken World, do I need to apply for anything?\" When Mo Wuji thought about how so many Star-grade geniuses want to go to the Broken World, he started to believe that there must be many treasures in there.</p><p>Gong Yi hurriedly said, \"Elder Mo is a Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Branch Elder. You just need to show your Elder Identity Token.\"</p><p>So simple? Mo Wuji was still thinking if he needed to find anyone to gain access to enter the Broken World, but he never expected that his identity token would already be enough.</p><p>\"Since that's the case, then Gong Yi, you can stay in the store. But don't start doing any business. I also need to be behind closed doors for a period of time. Wait till I come out and return from the Broken World before we officially open shop,\" Mo Wuji instructed. He was very clear that his power was still too low.</p><p>Even though he did not fear Ao Tiancheng, he couldn't do anything to Ao Tiancheng either. With his current power, he could only preserve himself in front of Ao Tiancheng. This self-preservation even required him to use his spatial teleportation.</p><p>It was incredibly difficult to reach the late Golden Immortal Stage in half a year's time, but no matter what, he was going to try.</p><p>\"Elder Mo, if you are going to have a closed doors cultivation session, then I suggest that you do it at the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance's Immortal Training Pool. Elders and above are allowed to cultivate there, and it's much more effective than using immortal crystals and spirit gathering arrays,\" Gong Yi hurriedly said when he heard that Mo Wuji was going to be entering closed doors.</p><p>\"Immortal Training Pool?\" Mo Wuji asked quizzically.</p><p>Gong Yi nodded, \"Yes, the Immortal Training Pool. That's the place that the elders and presidents use to cultivate. It's one of the most important places in our Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Sharphorn Branch.\"</p><p>\"How do I go there?\" Mo Wuji asked urgently.</p><p>\"I will bring Elder Mo over,\" Gong Yi did not hesitate to say.</p><p>…</p><p>Mo Wuji got Dou Hualong to help him check out of his room at Riverface Immortal Resthouse, while he hurriedly followed Gong Yi to the Immortal Training Pool. This trip to the Broken World was no joke; there would be many Star-grade geniuses going and most of them were in the Xuan Immortal Stage. When it comes to cultivation, he was still at the bottom of the crowd.</p><p>\"Gong Yi, is the strongest person in our Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Sharphorn Branch the currently cultivating President?\" Mo Wuji asked as they made their way.</p><p>Gong Yi replied, \"Yes, I heard that the President is already at the edge of the Immortal Emperor Dao Seat. This time, after he comes out of his closed doors, he would very likely have become a Quasi-Emperor. Once the President becomes a Quasi-Emperor, then our Sharphorn Branch…\"</p><p>\"The President hasn’t reached the Immortal Emperor Realm?\" Mo Wuji interrupted Gong Yi’s words as he asked in astonishment. He believed that since the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance was so strong, their Branch President here would naturally be an Immortal Emperor expert.</p><p>Gong Yi was feeling rather helpless; this Elder Mo could be said to have the best talent in pills that he had ever seen; Elder Mo’s future potential was limitless.</p><p>But how could an elder with such great potential with pills know so little about cultivation?</p><p>\"Elder Mo, the total number of Immortal Emperors in our Pill Dao Immortal Alliance can be counted in one hand; this even includes some Great Immortal Emperors that don’t reveal themselves to the world. In reality, it is already very incredible that our Sharphorn Branch has a Quasi-Emperor,\" Gong Yi replied in a detailed and respectful manner.</p><p>In reality, he was already overestimating when he said that the number could be counted in one hand. The Pill Dao Immortal Alliance probably didn’t have five Immortal Emperors; Gong Yi wasn’t sure, but in his perspective, it was very likely to be so.</p><p>When Mo Wuji heard these words, he frowned slightly.</p><p>If they didn’t even have five Immortal Emperors, what did the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance have which allowed it to lord over everyone else?</p><p>After some time, Mo Wuji asked another question, \"Gong Yi, I heard that the Devil Moon Immortal Sect’s Elder Gu is in the late Immortal Emperor Stage, and he even fought with the Yong Ying Immortal Domain’s Heavenly Emperor over a purple gourd. Does that mean that the Devil Moon Immortal Sect is a peak grade sect?\"</p><p>Gong Yi temporarily forgot Mo Wuji’s identity as he sneered, \"The Devil Moon Immortal Sect has an Immortal Emperor? They must be bragging. If they had an Immortal Emperor, it would merely be one in the early stage. I know that Elder Gu, he is merely someone who was at the Quasi-Emperor stage for quite some time.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji asked doubtfully, \"If the Elder Gu isn’t even in the Immortal Emperor Stage, then how was he able to battle with Yong Ying Immortal Domain’s Heavenly Emperor? And was even able to damage Yong Ying Immortal Domain’s Heaven and Earth?\"</p><p>Gong Yi replied, \"Yong Ying Immortal Domain is ranked the lowest among all the seven Immortal Domains. Its Heavenly Emperor is called Kui Fengyun, who’s only a Quasi-Emperor. Yong Ying Immortal Domain might have some Immortal Emperors but it’s definitely not Heavenly Emperor Kui Fengyun.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji sank into silence; he did not believe that Gong Yi would lie to him. The only possibility was that the intel he got was wrong. But that did not seem impossible; Dou Hualong was merely a worker doing odd jobs on the streets, the information that he could obtain were basically those that were being spread around by the common people.</p><p>When any news gets spread around, there was bound to be distortions in the truth. This was especially so for battles like this, the people spreading the rumors wanted to exaggerate and glamorise the battle, thus they would make it sound especially incredible and impressive.</p><p>Seeing Mo Wuji turn silent, Gong Yi explained, \"Ever since the ancient times, being an Immortal Emperor is an extremely difficult thing. Not only must one have the fate, one must also have the luck; one cannot solely do it based on talent alone. Because it’s heard to become an Immortal Emperor, many sects have addressed their Quasi-Emperors as Immortal Emperors. But in reality, there is a huge difference; 100 Quasi-Emperors would still be ants in front of 1 Immortal Emperor.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji patted Gong Yi’s shoulder, \"Gong Yi, this information of yours is very useful to me. Thank you.\"</p><p>Indeed, if he didn’t interact with something personally, the news that he obtains might not hold water. Moreover, don’t underestimate Gong Yi because he was acting like a little kid fawning over Mo Wuji. In reality, a majority of geniuses could not compare to Gong Yi’s background. An Assessment Deacon for the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance, just this title alone was enough to suppress many people. And being at this position, Gong Yi would naturally receive more reliable news.</p><p>Gong Yi felt a little overwhelmed by favor; what he said was merely the most basic of knowledge.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not continue asking Gong Yi about the purple gourd. Either way, that matter was temporarily not related to him.</p><p>When they finally reached the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance entrance, Mo Wuji suddenly thought of something and he immediately turned to ask, \"Gong Yi, if Yong Ying Immortal Domain’s Heavenly Emperor isn’t in the Immortal Emperor Stage, then why don’t the other Immortal Domains attack it?\"</p><p>Gong Yi lowered his voice and pointed above his head, \"I head that outside of the seven Immortal Domains, there is still the Very High Heavens. Many of the Immortal World’s rules and order is because of the Very High Heavens.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji did not ask any further; he could faintly feel that he should not continue asking about this. Even if he did, Gong Yi also wouldn’t know anything much. As Mo Wuji started to know more things, ht started to feel that the Immortal World wasn’t some great Heaven, it was still a world filled with petty and narrow-minded people that only served themselves.</p><p>…</p><p>Mo Wuji did not expect that the Pill Dao Immortal Alliance’s Immortal Training Pool would be at the basement level 2; that meant that it was one level below their treasury.</p><p>After bringing Mo Wuji here, Gong Yi stopped and pointed to the huge stone gate in front of them, \"Elder Mo, behind that stone gate is our Pill Dao Immortal Alliance Sharphorn Branch’s Immortal Training Pool. Only the jade token of elders and above can open it.\"</p><p>\"I understand. Gong Yi, you can return to the store first. Wait till I come back from the Broken World, I will go to the store and teach you some pill techniques.\" Mo Wuji knew what were Gong Yi’s thoughts. Even though a part of Gong Yi’s actions was due to respect, more importantly, Gong Yi wanted help to improve in the Pill Dao.</p><p>To Gong Yi, cultivation was not as important as pill mastery when he was looking for a teacher.</p><p>\"Yes, many thanks Elder.\" Now that Gong Yi had obtained Mo Wuji’s promise, he contentedly left Pill Dao Immortal Alliance.</p><p>After Gong Yi left, Mo Wuji brought out his Elder Identity Token and inserted it into the groove next to the stone gate.</p><p>Indeed, after he inserted the jade token, the stone gate started to emit a series of ‘Ge Ge’ sounds as it opened slowly.</p><p>Even before he walked into the stone gate, Mo Wuji could feel the rich delight of immortal spiritual energy.</p><p>Mo Wuji hurriedly pulled out his jade token and swiftly entered the Immortal Training Pool. After Mo Wuji entered, the heavy stone gate also started to slowly close.</p><p>This was a huge hall. In the center of the hall, was a huge pool that was more than a hundred square meters in area. At the center of the pool, there was a stone futon.</p><p>There were fogs of immortal mist rolling around the surface of the pool. The immortal spiritual energy here wasn’t merely rich, it even contained a form of natural dao energy.</p><p>Mo Wuji hurriedly leap towards that stone futon. Sitting cross-legged, he activated all 108 of his meridians.</p><p>108 small circulation paths formed. Thereafter, these small circulation paths joined to form a huge circulation path. Within instants, a huge immortal spiritual energy formed a huge wave that flooded towards Mo Wuji. The immortal mist seemed to have found a gap as it furiously streamed towards Mo Wuji’s surroundings, before disappearing within Mo Wuji’s body.</p><p>The unrestrained Mo Wuji was like a huge millstone; as copious amounts of immortal spiritual energy surged in him, he continued to grind it down like a mill, then converting it into his own power.</p><p>Ever since Mo Wuji reached the intermediate Golden Immortal Stage, he clearly felt his cultivation speed getting stagnant. But at this instant, as he furiously cultivated within the Immortal Training Pool, his stagnant cultivation was activated again and it continued to rise steadily.</p><p>His sea of consciously expanded; his immortal elemental energy continued to condense; his meridians continuously became wider....</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
