The reason why he lured Du Hong out of the city square was because he wanted to ascertain his true power now that he had stepped into the Immortal Reverent Stage.</p><p>Even if he wasn't able to match Du Hong, he could easily escape with his Wind Escape Technique.</p><p>In less than an hour, Du Hong's figure suddenly flashed and appeared in front of Mo Wuji.</p><p>\"There's no need to go to your ambush site. Call your companion out, I'm too lazy to continue running along with you,\" Du Hong uttered in a calm and indifferent tone; he didn't even take out his magic treasure.</p><p>Mo Wuji also stopped in his tracks. He wielded his Half Moon Weighted Halberd as he said, \"You're so boring. I wanted to bring you further away from Heaven's Beyond City Square; how could I know that you would want to bring your death forward.\"</p><p>Du Hong frowned. He discovered that his guess was off. In what why did this Pill Emperor in front of him look like he was preparing an ambush? This fella clearly wanted to have a head-on battle with him, could this fella be an Immortal Emperor as well?</p><p>\"You're an Immortal Emperor?\" The expression on Du Hong's face hardened. With a wave of his hand, a pitch black whip appeared in his palm.</p><p>Not only that, an immortal guard appeared on his chest.</p><p>Since Mo Wuji dared to utter such words, he was clearly an Immortal Emperor as well. Du Hong didn't believe that an Immortal Reverent would dare to fight one alone.</p><p>\"Let's cut the crap. Look out for my halberd.\" Mo Wuji stepped forward into the air, his Half Moon Weighted Halberd cleaved down towards Du Hong like a huge mountain.</p><p>\"You're only an Immortal Reverent?\" Du Hong was dumbfounded. Even though Mo Wuji's halberd strike was strong, the moment it emerged, he knew that Mo Wuji wasn't an Immortal Emperor.</p><p>When an Immortal Emperor attacked, his attack would be infused with his personal dao aura and contained the Laws of the Heaven and Earth; and his sacred art would be capable of shaking the Heaven and Earth. Thus, it was possible for an Immortal King to challenge an Immortal Reverent, but it was absolutely impossible for an Immortal Reverent to pit himself against an Immortal Emperor. An Immortal Reverent could only depend on the quality of his immortal elemental energy. An Immortal Emperor, on the other hand, could beckon the power of the Heaven and Earth.</p><p>Immediately, Du Hong felt rage rush into his head. A mere Immortal Reverent had really dared to lure him out for a one on one battle. Was there something wrong with this fella's brain? He really thought that Mo Wuji was a tiger disguised as a pig, but this Mo Wuji was really a pig. It was unknown how such an idiot could become a Pill Emperor. Perhaps he had always been surrounded by protectors. Now, he no longer had any protectors around him, but he continued to think that he was the number one person in the entire world.</p><p>\"Idiot…\" Du Hong speechlessly kept his immortal guard. He extended his Immortal Emperor Domain and a Law which contained the power of the Heaven and Earth sealed this part of space. If he had to use both his attack and defence type magic treasures to deal with a mere Immortal Reverent, wouldn't he, Du Hong, be throwing all his face away?</p><p>Mo Wuji sneered; his whirlpool domain also extended outwards at this very instant. The reason why he didn't immediately display his domain was because he wanted Du Hong to underestimate him. Indeed, he wasn't an Immortal Emperor, and it's true that he didn't know how to infuse the Laws of the Heaven and Earth into his attacks. However, he had his own Grand Dao. There was no need to talk about being an Immortal Reverent; the moment he became an immortal, he already had his own Dao infused into his moves.</p><p>\"Boom! Boom! Boom! Kacha! Crack, crack, crack…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji's whirlpool domain clashed against Du Hong's domain, immediately shattering the space between them.</p><p>Du Hong's heart started to pound heavily; he actually felt his Immortal Emperor Domain being ground inch by inch by Mo Wuji's whirlpool domain. Before he could even react, a halberd light, that seemed as tangible as an actual halberd, cleaved down towards him.</p><p>Cold sweat oozed out of Du Hong's back. If Du Hong still didn't know that Mo Wuji wasn't a simple Immortal Reverent, then he would have really have wasted all his years of cultivation. Despite not being an Immortal Emperor, Mo Wuji was actually able to behave normally against his power of the Laws of the Heaven and Earth, Mo Wuji could even shatter his domain. Within Mo Wuji's domain, he could feel an ordinary, but hard-to-explain Grand Dao. Clearly, his Immortal Emperor dao aura wasn't able to provide him with an advantage over Mo Wuji.</p><p>However, Du Hong also knew that it was too late for him to retrieve his guard. The whip in his hand transformed into a huge dragon. Its mouth opened like a huge black hole, devouring Mo Wuji's halberd light. At the same time, its tail zoomed towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>\"Boom…\"</p><p>Unending waves of immortal elemental energy exploded around them. The sand from the desert wasteland filled the air and the reverberating sounds of explosions echoed in the sand.</p><p>A violent burst of immortal elemental energy broke into Mo Wuji's domain. Mo Wuji felt a huge pain in his chest as he immediately felt the sweet taste of blood in his mouth.</p><p>Mo Wuji knew that when battling experts with a vastly higher cultivation, he definitely couldn't allow his opponent to regain his composure. If that happened, they would form a deadlock which was anything but good for him.</p><p>Mo Wuji forcefully endured his impulse to cough blood as he threw his entire body into Du Hong's domain. At the same time, he threw a punch outwards. Du Hong's Laws might be able to frighten other Immortal Reverents, but he must be dreaming if he thought that was enough to suppress him, Mo Wuji.</p><p>Because Du Hong underestimated Mo Wuji, his domain was gradually being shattered by Mo Wuji's whirlpool domain. And now, with Mo Wuji's Domain Crushing Fist, Du Hong's domain immediately exploded.</p><p>Feeling that his Immortal Emperor aura was useless against Mo Wuji, Du Hong snorted coldly and his guard appeared. The whip in his hand whipped out once more, conjuring a pitch black whip shadow which sped towards Mo Wuji. At the same time, he solidified his spiritual will and tried to forcefully envelop Mo Wuji's Half Moon Weighted Halberd.</p><p>Mo Wuji felt it the moment his Half Moon Weighted Halberd got restrained by Du Hong's spiritual will; his heart was filled with shock.</p><p>He had the Starsea Sacred Technique which was a technique used to temper one's sea of consciousness. Even though Mo Wuji didn't wholeheartedly cultivate that technique, he already had a preliminary understanding of it. This technique wasn't merely used to temper the sea of consciousness. Once the sea of consciousness strengthens to a certain level, it would allow spiritual will to become a means of attack; spiritual will would no longer only have an auxiliary function.</p><p>Once spiritual will could be used as an attack, it would countless of times stronger than immortal elemental energy attacks.</p><p>Unfortunately, Mo Wuji had always been on the run; while his cultivation had risen, his attack methods remained limited. He also had plenty of treasures on him, but he had never had the tiem to refine them and study them,</p><p>Now that his Half Moon Weighted Halberd had been sealed by Du Hong's spiritual will, Mo Wuji knew that he was going to be at a disadvantage. He did not have a primordial spirit, but he was sure that his sea of consciousness was definitely stronger than an early stage Immortal Emperor like Du Hong. Even so, Du Hong was able to use spiritual will to seal his weapon; it was useless even though his sea of consciousness was stronger.</p><p>Unfortunately, he didn't even have time to contemplate these matters. At this moment, DU Hong's black whip shadow suddenly exploded within Mo Wuji's domain. It transformed into countless of tiny black whip shadows. Even though these whip shadows were formed in the shape of whips, they were extremely sharp as they easily penetrated through Mo Wuji's whirlpool domain.</p><p>\"Boom!\" Mo Wuji's Domain Crushing Fist completely shattered Du Hong's domain, landing strongly on Du Hong's chest guard. A huge rebound of energy exploded within Du Hong, forcing him to cough out an arrow of blood.</p><p>However, Du Hong's expression remained fierce. He knew that he had merely been injured. Mo Wuji, on the other hand, would be thoroughly ravaged by his whip shadows. Even Mo Wuji's primordial spirit could only dissipate under his Spirit Splitting Whip.</p><p>By this time, even Du Hong could not help but praise Mo Wuji's relentlessness. If Mo Wuji chose to retract his punch and retreat, he wouldn't have been surrounded by Du Hong's Spirit Splitting Whip. Of course, that was only within Du Hong's calculations. If Mo Wuji kept his fist and retreated, he would transform his Spirit Splitting Whip to become his Spirit Splitting Killing Array. Mo Wuji would merely be delaying his death.</p><p>It was just as Du Hong predicted; his Spirit Splitting Whip directly pierced through Mo Wuji's whirlpool domain, enveloping Mo Wuji's entire body.</p><p>\"Pff! Pff! Pff!\" As fogs of blood oozed out of Mo Wuji's body, he snatched his Half Moon Weighted Halberd back from Du Hong's spiritual will.</p><p>Trails of blood continued to shoot out of his body. At this instant, even his face was being ravaged by Du Hong's Spirit Splitting Whip.</p><p>\"You're actually okay?\" Du Hong grabbed his Spirit Splitting Whip and stared at Mo Wuji in aghast.</p><p>In his mind, Mo Wuji's body should have been completely ravaged into a huge fog of blood due to his Spirit Splitting Whip. He definitely didn't think that only many scars of blood would form on Mo Wuji.</p><p>Don't simply look at the fact that Mo Wuji currently looked no different from a blood man. Du Hong was clearer than anyone else that Mo Wuji's injuries were much lighter than his.</p><p>He forcefully accepted Mo Wuji's fist, all so his attack could utterly destroy Mo Wuji's fleshly body. However, his Spirit Splitting Whip only managed to form scars on Mo Wuji's body. For immortals, such superficial wounds were no different from itches.</p><p>Mo Wuji's eyes were as calm as a pool of dead water. He didn't even respond to Du Hong's words as his Half Moon Weighted Halberd transformed into a cascading river.</p><p>\"You have a late stage God Physique?\" Du Hong suddenly understood what was going on. Only a late stage God Physique could withstand his Spirit Splitting Whip and remain unharmed.</p><p>Even though he didn't fall into an obvious disadvantage, a trace of fear suddenly appeared within Du Hong's heart. As an Immortal Emperor, he had seen countless of geniuses. However, he had never seen a God Physique cultivator, much less one in the late stage.</p><p>If Mo Wuji continued to meet his force with force, even an early stage Immortal Emperor like him wouldn't be able to wind.</p><p>The Winding River cascaded down from the sky, transforming in the silver coloured light. The light enveloped the entire space around Du Hong, including Du Hong's domain.</p><p>\"Spirit Splitting…\" Du Hong maintained a fierce expression on his face as he attacked with his Spirit Splitting Whip once more. His black whip seemed to melt like a cube of ice, instantly filling the entire space with black energy. Mo Wuji immediately felt his spiritual will turning sluggish and his entire sea of consciousness being invaded by this black energy.</p><p>This was a sacred art that could destroy one's primordial spirit? Mo Wuji immediately came to an understanding. The universe was so vast, there was indeed a myriad of different methods. To think that there was such a move that could destroy one's primordial spirit during a battle. Unfortunately, this fella met him, Mo Wuji.</p><p>He did not have a primordial spirit. Instead, he had a vast and boundless sea of consciousness, and within that sea of consciousness, there was a huge violet lake.</p><p>The violet energy within the violet lake churned, instantly sweeping away that black energy within his sea of consciousness. With this violet lake, Du Hong's Spirit Splitting Whip would be useless even if Mo Wuji had a primordial spirit. What's more, Mo Wuji didn't even have a primordial spirit.</p><p>At the same instant Mo Wuji expelled Du Hong's black energy, he punched outwards. However, this punch only moved a short distance before it suddenly stopped. At this moment, Mo Wuji's face suddenly turned blank.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
