The hook nosed man cried out mournfully as he lost the ability to defend against Shi Jinwen’s raging waves of elemental energy.</p><p>Shi Jinwen also knew that her power had reached its peak, and that was the best she could do. She just hoped to heavily injure hook nose and give Yan’Er and co. a chance to escape. Little would she expect that hook nose would suddenly be attacked by Mo Wuji, giving him no chance to deal with her attack. Her elemental energy unreservedly surged towards hook nose. Even after it landed, she was still staring at Mo Wuji in shock as she wondered how his sneak attack managed to get through.</p><p>Without any obstacles or set-up defenses, Shi Jinwen’s attack was no longer going to simply heavily injure hook nose, but fatally strike him. At the instant hook nose’s waist was struck with Mo Wuji’s electroball, his internal organs were also torn apart by Shi Jinwen’s waves of elemental energy.</p><p>Mo Wuji would not waste such an opportunity as he grabbed his Tian Ji Pole and swung it downwards.</p><p>\"Pu! Ka…\"</p><p>A teeth shaking sound could be heard; the hook nose’s brain was crushed into meat juice with Mo Wuji’s pole.</p><p>Mo Wuji slowly exhaled a breath of air as he turned and dragged his Tian Ji Pole behind him.</p><p>Not far away, the heavily injured Shi Jinwen stared blankly at the hook nose’s falling corpse then at the turning Mo Wuji. She was momentarily at a loss for words.</p><p>\"Remember to cultivate properly and work hard to live.\" Mo Wuji also stood in front of Yan’Er in a daze before he entrusted her with that simple sentence. Thereafter, he turned and slowly walked far away. His voice was hoarse and husky, he was like a nomad travelling in the desert who had not seen water for a long time.</p><p>After brushing shoulders with death countless of times, Mo Wuji truly understood that living wasn’t easy.</p><p>That hook nose’s storage bag, he’ll just leave it behind for Yan’Er.</p><p>\"Who is he?\" It was only after Mo Wuji’s figure disappeared in the distance that the green robed lady beside Yan’Er asked this question.</p><p>\"I… don’t recognise him ah…\" Yan’Er was at a loss for what to say. Up till now, she did not understand why Mo Wuji would risk his life to save her. Furthermore, he even asked her to cultivate properly and work hard to live before he left. In her memory, she had never befriended a black-faced monk. Unless this man was from her forgotten past? Didn’t master tell her that everyone she knew were all mortals? How could she have known such an expert?</p><p>\"You don’t know him but he sacrificed himself to save you?\" The other purple robed lady asked.</p><p>\"Yan’Er…\" Shi Jinwen swallowed some pills and called out loud.</p><p>\"Ah, senior apprentice sister, are you alright?\" Yan’Er finally came to her senses, she immediately ran over to help pick Shi Jinwen up.</p><p>Shi Jinwen looked towards the direction Mo Wuji disappeared in and asked doubtfully, \"Yan’Er, you know him?\"</p><p>Yan’Er shook her head. She really didn’t know this scar faced, blood covered, wound riddled, black faced monk.</p><p>\"Holy sh*t…\" That green robed lady suddenly cried in shock.</p><p>The three others simultaneously shifted their gazes over, wondering what she was calling out for.</p><p>The green robed lady pointed at the hundreds of corpses lying within and around the lightning, trembling as she said, \"He couldn’t have possibly killed all of them by himself right?\"</p><p>The four suddenly went silent. It was only after some time that the purple robed lady spoke, \"It must him. His entire body is covered in blood, with no skin left uncovered. There are also lightning scars all over his head and body, clearly he just emerged from that lightning lake…\"</p><p>\"I know who he is, he is that Rogue Cultivator 2705. No wonder why he’s ranking is so high, he’s really strong ah…\" The green robed lady finally reacted and said loudly in astonishment.</p><p>...</p><p>Perhaps it was because of the clash with the Thunder Fog Forest’s demonic beasts, or perhaps it was due to some other reason. The alien cultivators lost devastatingly in this Thunder Fog Forest War. The alien cultivators gave up on their encampments within the Thunder Fog Forest and started to retreat.</p><p>...</p><p>Yan City Immortal Jade House. This wasn’t only the number one hotel in Yan City, it was also the number one hotel in the entire Tian Shang Empire.</p><p>Not only was the environment pleasant, the spiritual energy was dense and rich and it’s horizons was wide and spacious. From the Yan City Immortal Jade House, one can easily see the Hundred Sect Alliance’s contribution points ranking on the Yan City Plaza. Additionally, the Yan City Immortal Jade House had a specialised transaction hall.</p><p>During the war between the Five Great Empires and the alien cultivators, there were naturally many spoils of war. A portion of cultivators would trade these away at the marketplace, but there were some who would also go the the Yan City Immortal Jade House.</p><p>Recently, the alien cultivators had withdrawn from the Thunder Fog Forest and regrouped with the alien cultivators within the Tian Shang Empire. Naturally, the Five Great Empire’s cultivators rushed to the Yan City encampment. This caused Yan City to burst with activity, and Yan City Immortal Jade House also became more lively.</p><p>To attract more people, the Immortal Jade House directly changed all ten of its floors into teahouses. Here, people could chat and talk while drinking tea. At the same time, they could engage in simple trade without needing to visit the transaction hall.</p><p>More and more cultivators liked to visit the Immortal Jade House. Here, they could talk carefreely and drink to their heart’s content.</p><p>Besides the war with the alien cultivators, the hottest topic of discussion was the contribution points ranking shown on the Yan City Plaza. The topic of greatest discussion wasn’t the Rank 1 Great Evolution Sect’s Xi Yixuan, nor was it the Rank 2 and 3 Heaven Seeking Palace’s Feng Luoqiu and Gou Zihan, but the anonymous rogue cultivator, Rogue Cultivator 2705.</p><p>In half a year, Rogue Cultivator 2705, this black horse, catapulted straight into the Hundred Sect Alliance’s contribution points rankins. Not only that, he even charged straight up to Rank 10. Over the past few months, Rogue Cultivator 2705 soundlessly disappeared as he got overtaken by genius after genius.</p><p>Many people even began to suspect that this Rogue Cultivator 2705 met with some great luck and managed to kill an expert at the Great Circle of the Nihility God Stage. That’s how he got 9000 points at one go. It was like this till two months ago when Rogue Cultivator 2705 soared back to fame. At one go, his points jumped by over 3000. With a total number of contribution points of 12076, he charged up to the top 6.</p><p>The Hundred Sect Alliance Contribution Point Board refreshed to reflect this new results. Seeing Rogue Cultivator 2705 at Rank 6 with 12076 points, the number of people who attributed his points to luck gradually lessened.</p><p>Luck might work once, but it wouldn’t always be so good. Furthermore, this time around, many clearly saw how the points rose. It wasn’t a simple jump of 3000, but a gradual increase of points.</p><p>According to a shop assistant from the Immortal Jade House, he was standing right in front of the board at Yan City Plaza on that fateful day. He personally saw Rogue Cultivator 2705’s contribution points rising gradually. Within two hours, it refreshed more than a hundred times.</p><p>The cultivators who were sitting near the window were also discussing about Rogue Cultivator 2705. When one of them mentioned the words of that shop assistant, another cultivator immediately chided, \"That’s impossible. I can believe that the points changed for more than a hundred times. After all, points were the cumulation of the constant killing of alien cultivators. But you say that the points changed a hundred times within two hours? Forgive me for not believing you, but your words are simply too absurd.\"</p><p>\"Why is it impossible?\" The cultivator who relayed the shop assistant’s story was a little discontented. The other cultivator’s words made him seem like he was speaking blindly.</p><p>The disbelieving cultivator said plainly, \"Think about it. If the points kept changing more than a hundred times within two hours, what would it mean? It would mean the Rogue Cultivator 2705 had been surrounded by hundreds of alien cultivators. Facing the siege of hundreds of cultivators, he did not kill all of them at one go, but killed each of the alien cultivators one at a time, what would it mean then? It shows that this rogue cultivator’s power isn’t high. A rogue cultivator with a low cultivation, encircled by hundreds of alien cultivators. Not only wasn’t he killed, he slashed them down slowly one at a time. Is that possible? Unless you’re telling me that his opponents are all pigs at an abattoir, waiting to get slaughtered?\"</p><p>The relaying cultivator was stunned by these barrage of questions, and he stuttered, \"Hearing your explanations, it doesn’t really seem possible.\"</p><p>\"Why is it impossible? I can confirm that it’s true. I can also confirm that Rogue Cultivator 2705 has yet to advance into the Earth Realm.\" A clear, crisp voice said with a hint of dissatisfaction.</p><p>That voice was a little too loud and it immediately attracted everyone’s attention.</p><p>The one speaking was a lady in a green skirt. She saw the crowds converging their attention on her, and she continued to speak loudly, \"I personally saw the aftermath of his battle. The entire area was surrounded with the corpses of alien cultivators, while he was also heavily injured. Still, he even helped my Heaven Seeking Palace Pill Pagoda’s Senior Jinwen to kill an expert at the Great Circle of the True Lake Stage.\"</p><p>The green skirted lady was exactly one of the two ladies with Yan’Er. She had always believed that Mo Wuji was Rogue Cultivator 2705.</p><p>\"Who’s to know that what you’re saying is true? Many people claim that they know 2705 but those claims turned out to be false.\" Someone spoke out among the crowd.</p><p>Rogue Cultivator 2705 wasn’t the only person with such an illustrious reputation, any cultivator who could enter the top 100 was a proud child of heavens. Each and every one of these cultivators had an immense popularity in Yan City. If they entered the Immortal Jade House, the Immortal Jade House would not accept any fees and would even feel proud.</p><p>Rogue Cultivator 2705 was in Rank 6, naturally, he was in the Five Great Empire’s hall of fame. If an average sect head were to meet him, the sect head would still need to pause and say hello. To be personally acquainted with this kind of genius was akin to sticking gold on your face.</p><p>Thus, many people wanted to acquaint themselves with the geniuses on the Hundred Sect Alliance Contribution Point Board. But a majority of these geniuses already had an established reputation with a well-known name. Only Rogue Cultivator 2705 was anonymous and unknown. It was because of this, that many people claimed that they knew Rogue Cultivator 2705.</p><p>\"I am the Heaven Seeking Palace Dao Gate’s inner disciple, Xue Tongsi. When the incident happened, I was not the only one present; Senior Jinwen was also there. Moreover, Heaven Seeking Palace’s number one genius, Yan’Er, and the Great Evolution Sect’s junior Ling Yizhen were also there. Rogue Cultivator 2705 even risked his life to save Yan’Er. Would I need to lie about such things?\" The green skirted lady’s face swelled till it looked a little ugly. When they linked her to those imposters who claimed that they knew 2705, she could not help but be angry.</p><p>\"This senior is indeed a Heaven Seeking Palace’s inner disciple, she wouldn’t lie.\" Someone among the crowd recognised Xue Tongsi.</p><p>\"Senior Xue, how did this Rogue Cultivator 2705 look like?\" Another person among the crowd asked.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
