This made him even more worried. At his current pill refining level, he would not burn any spiritual herbs while refining pills anymore, so if Granny Linglong would occasionally burn some, was she really as impressive as others made her to be?</p><p>Then the lady behind the giant pill furnace came into view. She looked at most thirty, with a brown dress draped over her body. On top of that, she was rather beautiful. A pair of doll like eyes paired with slender eyebrows, with silky black hair tied in a bun, she appeared pure yet carrying an aura of nobility.</p><p>This is Granny Linglong? She’s obviously a beauty in her prime. Mo Wuji almost thought that they were pulling wool over his eyes. But immediately, he realised that this was not possible. No one would have the ability and the courage to impersonate Granny Linglong at the temporary encampment of Heaven Seeking Palace.</p><p>\"What have you sought me out for?\" Seeing that Mo Wuji stared at her without uttering a word, Granny Linglong frowned slightly.</p><p>This jolted Mo Wuji back to his senses, and he quickly bowed respectfully, \"Junior Mo Wuji greets Granny Linglong.\" He dared not expose a single bit of the thoughts in his mind.</p><p>\"Speak.\" Granny Linglong was much more direct.</p><p>With another bow, Mo Wuji spoke worriedly, \"This is Yan’Er. She is the person closest to me. I, Junior Mo Wuji, have made this trip to request…\"</p><p>Granny Linglong interrupted Mo Wuji at this, \"You want to beg me to save her?\"</p><p>\"Yes, Junior Mo boldly requests you to do so.\" Mo Wuji could sense that Granny Linglong was not as bad as what Yan Qianyin and others made her out to be, but the only thing out of place was that she seemed a little too young. The term \"Sister Linglong\" would perhaps have been more appropriate.</p><p>Granny Linglong’s gaze swept across Yan’Er’s body, then replying, \"Someone tried to steal her spiritual roots but failed, which made her spirit channel network turn into a mess, her mind’s gone haywire and her memories have disappeared. She has at most two years left to live.\"</p><p>The news came as a shock to Mo Wuji; at this moment, there was nothing holding him back anymore, so he bowed even lower than before and pleaded, \"Please Granny Linglong, please help her. I will do anything.\"</p><p>With a glance, Granny Linglong knew Yan’Er’s condition. She could not have faked this level of skill. While spiritual roots snatching and the spiritual roots transfer Shen Lian mentioned was different in their name, but from Mo Wuji’s perspective, there was no difference in meaning.</p><p>At this moment, Mo Wuji felt even more strongly how Yu Zhi felt when he came to beg him; he was now in a similar situation.</p><p>\"I can save her.\" Granny Linglong was straightforward in her reply. These words were like the words of an angel to Mo Wuji’s ears, and his voice trembled as he said, \"I beg you, Granny Linglong, to be merciful, and use your skills to save Yan’Er. Yan’Er has always been lonely and suffering…\"</p><p>To Mo Wuji, while Yan’Er was always by his side, she was an orphan, and never could enjoy life. Instead, she always kept taking care of him.</p><p>\"But why should I save her? How is she related to me in any way?\" Granny Linglong’s rebuttal made Mo Wuji sink into the depths of despair. He finally understood how difficult it was to get Granny Linglong to help. This was just the start, and he could not find any reason to back himself up.</p><p>\"If you cannot give me a reason to do so, then please leave. I won’t be so calculative with you.\" A tinge of irritation appeared in Granny Linglong’s voice.</p><p>\"Granny, while I do not have any Immeasurable Soul-forging Crystal…\"</p><p>Before Mo Wuji could complete his sentence, Granny Linglong angrily interrupted him, \"What are you even doing here without a single Immeasurable Soul-forging Crystal? Get out.\"</p><p>A killing aura immediately enveloped Mo Wuji, and gave him the feeling that he would be torn to pieces the next moment if he made a wrong move.</p><p>\"Ah…\" Mo Wuji was shocked. Even though he thought that it was hard to talk to Granny Linglong, she did not seem like someone who did not know how to interact with others. However within a blink of the eye, she had such a drastic change in attitude.</p><p>At this point, Granny Linglong became very agitated as she pointed at Mo Wuji and chided him, \"Do you know how difficult it is to save her? She has to follow me for 10 years, and learn my heart technique. If I did not desperately need Immeasurable Soul-forging Crystals, even if you gave me ten thousand pieces of them, I would not even bother...Screw it, as long as you can give me one piece of Immeasurable Soul-forging Crystal, I’ll help to save her.\" As Granny Linglong reached the end of her speech, she seemed to be rather sad and tired of things, before returning to her depressed and disappointed state.</p><p>Mo Wuji then took out a jade box, \"Granny, while I do not have any Immeasurable Soul-forging Crystals, I managed to obtain an ice flower…\" Afraid that Granny Linglong would not even bother to take a look, he opened up the box for her.</p><p>\"Get out, get out right now…\" Granny Linglong’s voice abruptly stopped, and both eyes widened to their maximum as she stared at the jade box in Mo Wuji’s hands. Countless breaths later, she broke into a high pitched scream before rushing to his side, snatching the jade box from him.</p><p>\"Hahaha…\" The next moment, Mo Wuji could only hear the wild cackling of Granny Linglong. If he did not have to beg this woman to save Yan’Er, he would have thought that she was crazy, and brought Yan’Er away a long time ago.</p><p>\"An Immeasurable Soul-prolonging Flower, you actually found an Immeasurable Soul-prolonging Flower, haha, haha...Linglong, what I’ve been waiting for has arrived, it’s arrived…\" Granny Linglong kissed the jade box while laughing like a mad woman.</p><p>Mo Wuji calmed down immediately. From Granny Linglong’s words, it seemed as though the Immeasurable Soul-prolonging Flower was useful to her, and what he just produced was exactly that.</p><p>A few minutes passed, Granny Linglong’s laughter slowly died down. She carefully took out a new jade box and transferred the Immeasurable Soul-prolonging Flower into it. Then, she threw Mo Wuji’s jade box to one side.</p><p>After completing all that, she took a deep breath, before gazing warmly at Mo Wuji and saying, \"Mo Wuji, thank you for the Immeasurable Soul-prolonging Flower you brought. I’ll help you heal Yan’Er now. For one Immeasurable Soul-prolonging Flower, other than having me save Yan’Er, I can still agree to another request of yours. Tell me what you want.\"</p><p>Granny Linglong’s tone was very warm and friendly, giving off the vibes of a proper lady. It was no longer the demeanor of a crazy woman which was present until a moment ago. The only thing was that her voice was trembling slightly, an apparent sign that she had not completely calmed down from the excitement of receiving an Immeasurable Soul-prolonging Flower.</p><p>Mo Wuji steeled his nerves, then went into a relaxed state. As long as Granny Linglong agreed to save Yan’Er, he did not have to worry any further.</p><p>With his worries behind him, his mind became much clearer, \"Granny, what is this Immeasurable Soul-prolonging Flower? It’s even better than the Immeasurable Soul-forging Crystal?\"</p><p>Now Granny Linglong’s mood seemed to be exceptionally good, as she patiently explained, \"What’s the Immeasurable Soul-forging Crystal compared to the Immeasurable Soul-prolonging Flower? Even if there was a house full of Immeasurable Soul-forging Crystals, they would not be able to match up to a single Immeasurable Soul-prolonging Flower petal. Strictly speaking, the previous incarnation of a Immeasurable Soul-prolonging Flower is a Immeasurable Soul-forging Crystal. But for a Immeasurable Soul-forging Crystal to turn into a Immeasurable Soul-prolonging Flower, it’s really too difficult. Only an extreme minority of an extreme minority of Immeasurable Soul-forging Crystals will form its own will under extremely cold conditions, and these Crystals with wills of their own will absorb the soul energy from the surrounding Crystals, slowly turning into an Immeasurable Soul-prolonging Flower over time. For one to grow into a Immeasurable Soul-prolonging Flower of similar caliber to the one you took out, the conditions are so tough to an extent that you can’t even imagine…\"</p><p>Granny Linglong carried on, \"Your luck is not bad, to be able to actually obtain an Immeasurable Soul-prolonging Flower. For your information, I would have expected you, as a Channel Opening Stage cultivator, to have frozen to death before even getting anywhere close to this flower. I really don’t have the faintest idea how you did it. Tell me about the whole process. Were there other things in the area where the Flower grew?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji quickly responded, \"I obtained it at the bottom of an ice mountain. Back then, I entered a large hall in the ice mountain, which had many tunnels, and in one of the tunnels, I was able to obtain this stalk of Immeasurable Soul-prolonging Flower. It was indeed freezing cold in there, but I could still endure it. It’s such a pity that there was only one stalk of the Flower, and nothing else.\"</p><p>There was at least 90% truth in his words, because with Granny Linglong’s ability, she could find out that he went into the ice mountain from the bracelet. However, the lie was that he had no bracelet on him, so Granny Linglong naturally had no way of finding out which tunnel he got the Flower from. As soon as he finished speaking, Mo Wuji could feel a powerful spiritual will entering his storage bag. This made him celebrate in his mind. Luckily he hid his own storage bag at his accommodation before coming here.</p><p>Granny Linglong’s spiritual will circled Mo Wuji’s storage bag for awhile, before being withdrawn, and she nodded, \"Not bad, your luck is indeed rather good.\"</p><p>With that, Granny Linglong paused for a moment before continuing, \"Yan’Er’s spirit channel network is rather messed up, and she’s not really conscious. Because the spiritual root stealing caused her to lose her memories, it would be very difficult even for me to restore them…\"</p><p>\"Elder, but you just said…\" Mo Wuji got a shock, and frantically asked.</p><p>Granny Linglong waved him off, \"You don’t need to worry. As long as you’ve come to me, her life is in no danger. But as for her memories...I’ll have to take a look at her spiritual roots first…\"</p><p>After speaking, Granny Linglong grabbed the wrist of Yan’Er, and soon announced confidently, \"It’s indeed a valuable mutant wood affinity spiritual root.\"</p><p>\"Elder, what’s a mutant wood affinity spiritual root?\" Mo Wuji questioned.</p><p>\"There are often only Wind, Lightning, and Ice affinity mutant spiritual roots, but once a five element spiritual root mutates, its future potential even exceeds that of the wind, lightning and ice affinity spiritual roots. Mutant wood affinity spiritual roots are the best for pill refiners.\"</p><p>With some hesitation, Granny Linglong carried on, \"I’ve only taken in two disciples my whole life, and since you’ve offered an Immeasurable Soul-prolonging Flower, if you’re willing, I can take her under my wing as a closed disciple. However…\"</p><p>Mo Wuji immediately bowed, \"It’s Yan’Er’s good fortune for elder to take her in as a disciple. If you have any further instructions, please speak freely.\" He himself did not have a master, and Granny Linglong’s abilities were extremely advanced too. Furthermore, she was number 1 within the Heaven Seeking Palace’s Pill Pagoda. Why wouldn’t Mo Wuji agree if she wanted to take Yan’Er as a disciple?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
