She was constantly calling out for her young master, but it was not because she had recognised Mo Wuji, but it was because these were the words she had constantly been calling.</p><p>“Jing… Fei... Lan!” Mo Wuji uttered those three words one at a time. He only knew that the woman who snatched Yan’Er away was Jing Feilan. After being snatched away by her, Yan’Er ended up on the streets, seemingly a little deranged. If he did not kill that woman, he would be living in vain all his life.</p><p>Yan'Er's body was covered in dirt, and her hair was withered and yellow. As Mo Wuji held her within his arms, he could feel that she was at most 10 to 20kg. It was easy to deduce that she must have suffered a lot.</p><p>Due to the fury in his heart, Mo Wuji clenched his fists angrily, his nails piercing into the meat in his palm. Fresh blood flowed but he was seemingly unaware.</p><p>\"Just now, you kicked Yan'Er?\" Holding Yan'Er up, Mo Wuji walked towards the man who kicked Yan'Er.</p><p>He previously swore that he would not let Yan'Er go through any further suffering. However, in just this short period of time, she went through an unfathomable one. Not only did she end up as a homeless nomad, she was even unreasonably bullied. Mo Wuji was willing to take the pain that Yan'Er had been through, so that she would no longer suffer. After all, she had already suffered enough taking care of him.</p><p>The man's eyes swept across Mo Wuji, and he said cold, \"Yes, this lord here kicked her. What are you going to do to me?\"</p><p>\"Kacha! Ah! (Pa!)...\" With a quick motion, Mo Wuji kicked the man's knee, and the sound of breaking bones could be heard. At the same time, Mo Wuji slapped the man's mouth. If all these suffering happened to him, he could tolerate it and wait for the right moment to act. But he was unable to tolerate Yan'Er being bullied. Sometimes, if you really can't tolerate something, why remain patient?</p><p>The man's scream of pain was dispersed with Mo Wuji's slap. He sat on the ground paralysed, hugging his knee, spitting out a few teeth and fresh blood.</p><p>As there were too many people and Mo Wuji was only at the periphery of the square, his actions only attracted the attention of the few in his immediate surroundings.</p><p>The surrounding people could feel Mo Wuji's aggression and immediately dispersed, emptying the space. Mo Wuji no longer cared about that fella as he turned around to leave with Yan'Er.</p><p>\"Is she your friend?\" Shen Lian hurried over and whispered in Mo Wuji's ear.</p><p>As Mo Wuji was about to answer, a gloomy voice called over, \"Do you think you can just leave after beating someone during the Spring Immortal's Gate?\"</p><p>The one speaking with a young man with a long face and slitted eyes. On his back, was a long sword. His hair was tied into a bun and he was wearing a pair of light shoes. Mo Wuji had met with a lot of cultivators recently; one look and he knew that this person was a cultivator.</p><p>\"Wu Jingwu, what is the meaning of this?\" Shen Lian, who was by Mo Wuji's side, furiously questioned.</p><p>It was then Mo Wuji knew that this long faced, slitted eyes youth was acquainted to Shen Lian. This fella probably came to cause trouble for him because of his relations with Shen Lian.</p><p>Wu Jingwu looked at Shen Lian and said, \"Junior apprentice sister, can you please not hang around these lowly mortals? It will only lower your status. Master has been unable to find you, and he knew that you would secretly take part in the Spring Immortal's Gate. But there's no need for you to try anything. Do you think that after I reveal your status, any other sects would dare to accept you?\"</p><p>Having said that, Wu Jingwu turned back, seemingly trying to call people over.</p><p>Shen Lian coldly said, \"Wu Jingwu, if you do anything which implicates Mo Wuji, I will never let you off. I, Shen Lian, swear: I will do what I say.\"</p><p>Wu Jingwu's expression turned unsightly as he turned to Mo Wuji and asked, \"Who is this guy?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji turned to Shen Lian and said, \"Senior Shen, I will be leaving first. We will meet again if fate permits.\"</p><p>With that, Mo Wuji turned and left hurriedly with Yan'Er, totally ignoring Wu Jingwu.</p><p>\"Wuji, what happened?\" Ding Bu'Er ran over.</p><p>Mo Wuji looked seriously at Ding Bu'Er and said, \"Bu'Er, continue trying your best. It will be good if you get selected by a sect.\"</p><p>\"Ok. After my test, I will immediately rush back.\" Ding Bu'Er did not know who Yan'Er was, but he had his guesses.</p><p>…</p><p>When Mo Wuji returned to his suite, he immediately helped Yan'Er wash up. He did not know how Yan'Er ended up like this, but looking at her emaciated look, he knew that if he did not coincidentally find her during the Spring Immortal's Gate, he would never have seen her again.</p><p>After Yan'Er lost her self-consciousness, she was constantly calling out \"young master\". Mo Wuji knew that Yan'Er must have been looking for him. It was this persistance... this persistance had led her here.</p><p>Mo Wuji personally cooked some porridge for Yan'Er and fed her. After she had gone to sleep, he went out to buy a whole pile of medicinal herbs, as well as some clothes for Yan'Er.</p><p>Even Mo Wuji did not know whether he could treat Yan'Er's current situation.</p><p>It was late into the evening but Ding Bu'Er still did not return. On the contrary, it was Shen Lian who returned to the suite.</p><p>\"Sorry, I dragged you into my problem just now.\" The moment she returned, Shen Lian immediately apologized to Mo Wuji.</p><p>Mo Wuji waved it off, \"It's okay, I wasn't dragged into anything in the end. That person was your senior?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji made it sound simple, but he knew that he was in an extremely dangerous situation back during the Spring Immortal's Gate. If any enforcement immortal masters noticed, he would have met his dead end. In front of those immortal masters, his life meant as much as an ant's.</p><p>Shen Lian shook her head, not wanting to discuss about Wu Jingwu. Seeing Mo Wuji brewing some medicine, she turned to Mo Wuji's room and asked, \"How about I go and take a look at your friend?\"</p><p>\"You understand medicine?\" Mo Wuji asked puzzledly.</p><p>Shen Lian hesitated, but she still said, \"My father is an Earth Pill Refiner.\"</p><p>\"What's an Earth Pill Refiner?\" Mo Wuji still did not understand.</p><p>Shen Lian stared at Mo Wuji with her eyes wide open, speechless. After some time, she asked, \"Aren't you a drug refiner? You even spent 370 thousand gold coins to purchase some refining equipment, but you don't know what's an Earth Pill Refiner?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji said awkwardly, \"I'm not actually a certified drug refiner. I merely tried my hand at it after purchasing some medicinal ingredients.\"</p><p>Shen Lian facepalmed, but she continued to explain, \"In pill refining, nine tiers of spiritual pills can be concocted. Tier 1 to 3 spiritual pills are classified as Mortal grade spiritual pills. Tier 4 to 6 are Earth grade, while Tier 7 to 9 are Heavenly grade. Above that, are the Immortal grade spiritual pills. Being able to refine a certain tier of spiritual pills would classify you as a pill refiner of the same tier. Thus, there are nine tiers of pill refiners, or you can also see it as three grades of pill refiners.\"</p><p>\"So an Earth Pill Refiner can refine Tier 4 spiritual pills at the very least? What tier is your father? Is an Earth Pill Refiner very impressive?\" Mo Wuji bombarded Shen Lian with a barrage of questions.</p><p>Shen Lian became even more speechless. it was only after a whole 10 seconds did she finally say, \"In the entire Xing Han Empire, there isn't even a Heavenly Pill Refiner. Do you think an Earth Pill Refiner is impressive?\"</p><p>Mo Wuji hurriedly stood up and said to Shen Lian, \"Senior Shen, please help me take a look at Yan'Er.\"</p><p>\"Her name is Yan'Er? What a nice sounding name,\" As Shen Lian spoke, she had already started walking towards Mo Wuji's room. She was curious to see the kind of girl Mo Wuji was so concerned over.</p><p>She had stayed with Mo Wuji for nearly a month. Even though the two of them did not interact much, she had a basic understanding of Mo Wuji. Her beauty was definitely world class, and her figure would arouse jealousy among 99% of women. However, Mo Wuji did not treat her warmly due to her beauty nor her figure. She was clear that Mo Wuji treated her warmly, and even invited her to his suite, was entirely because of her greater understanding of cultivation. It had nothing to do with her appearance.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
