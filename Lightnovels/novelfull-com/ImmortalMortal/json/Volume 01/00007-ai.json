  "body": "<p>Mo Wuji felt a wave of relief wash over him as he considered the implications of his hiring by Lu Jiujun. \"Owner Lu, does this mean you need my assistance in developing a new drug for Dan Han Drug Refinery?\" he asked, recognizing the urgency of his financial situation. The amount of gold coins he required was substantial, far beyond mere tens or hundreds.</p>\n<p>Lu Jiujun hesitated, his brow furrowed. \"I don't necessarily need you to create an entirely new drug. The downfall of Dan Han Drug Refinery stemmed from our overzealous attempts to innovate. We invested too many resources into new drug development, which ultimately failed to materialize in time, allowing our competitors to seize the opportunity. Perhaps you could start with our existing formulations as a foundation, which would save considerable time and effort.\"</p>\n<p>Lu Jiujun's assessment was accurate. Following Mo Tiancheng's disappearance, Dan Han Drug Refinery had been left with excess profits. Eager to improve, Lu Jiujun had hired several renowned drug refiners to develop a new drug. Unfortunately, after Mo Tiancheng had siphoned off most of the profits, the remaining funds proved insufficient for new drug development. Consequently, all efforts were in vain, leading to the refinery's decline.</p>\n<p>Many attributed the failure of Dan Han Drug Refinery to Lu Jiujun's reckless spending, but he alone understood that even without his insistence on new drug development, the refinery was destined to fail.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji was less concerned about Dan Han Drug Refinery's reputation, as its products had lost their competitive edge over the years. Cheng Lin Pill Workshop offered similar efficacy at more attractive prices. His involvement felt more like a desperate struggle for survival.</p>\n<p>\"If I am to be the sole researcher for this new drug, I require 70% of the profits from its sales,\" Mo Wuji stated firmly, realizing the gravity of his financial needs. He had no intention of starting with the drug that Dan Han Drug Refinery had previously pursued.</p>\n<p>\"That's out of the question. You lack any qualifications and dare to demand 70% of the profits? What kind of logic is that? I could hire a drug refiner for 200-300 gold coins a month,\" Lu Jiujun retorted, rising in irritation.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji remained unfazed; he had navigated countless negotiations in his past life, and such remarks no longer intimidated him. \"Owner Lu, do you truly believe a pharmacist earning 200-300 gold coins a month can successfully develop a new drug? Even if they do, they could easily leave for another refinery with the formula. Are you confident you could still profit? And even if you signed a contract, would you have enough funds to pay their monthly salary if the development takes longer than expected? I am different; until the new drug is developed, I will only take 10 gold coins a month from you.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji sensed that Lu Jiujun lacked the funds to hire a competent drug refiner, so he decided to take a gamble with this proposal.</p>\n<p>\"On top of the profit-sharing, you also want me to pay you 10 gold coins a month?\" Lu Jiujun's tone softened as he processed the situation.</p>\n<p>\"Absolutely, Owner Lu. Your decision to hire me already reflects your wisdom. Given my current circumstances, you must understand that I cannot develop a new drug on an empty stomach. Moreover, even if I fail, your losses will be minimal. However, if you spend hundreds of gold coins on a drug refiner who fails, well, I fear we might end up as neighbors,\" Mo Wuji chuckled.</p>\n<p>Lu Jiujun's irritation grew at Mo Wuji's grin, and he vowed to confront anyone who labeled Mo Wuji as mad or eccentric; he was clearly not.</p>\n<p>\"No, I can only offer you 50%,\" Lu Jiujun finally replied after a moment of contemplation.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji's argument was sound. Even if he failed to develop a new drug, Lu Jiujun's maximum loss would be a few dozen gold coins. In contrast, hiring a qualified drug refiner could cost him thousands, potentially leading to his downfall.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji stroked his chin thoughtfully. \"Fifty percent is acceptable, but not of the current profits. I want 50% of Dan Han Drug Refinery's shares. If you agree, we can sign the contract now. If not, I will take the drug refiner test and obtain the certification. Don't tell me I can't take the test without a diploma; I have my ways. Once I have the certificate, well...\"</p>\n<p>Lu Jiujun sighed, realizing Mo Wuji had struck a nerve. Even if he sought another pharmacist, no one would believe him if he offered them 80% of the profits.</p>\n<p>\"Alright, I agree. Prince Mo, you must commit fully to this endeavor, as the future of Dan Han Drug Refinery now rests on your shoulders. From this day forth, you will be the Chief Drug Refiner of Dan Han Drug Refinery.\" Lu Jiujun was done negotiating. Once the new drug was developed, its sales would determine the refinery's profits, aligning the shares of the workshop with those of the new drug.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji clapped Lu Jiujun on the shoulder. \"Brother, you're a clever man. Watch as I bring you prosperity and revive Dan Han Drug Refinery. By the way, lend me 10 gold coins first; I'm short on rice at home.\"</p>\n<p>Lu Jiujun's expression twitched, but he ultimately retrieved a small pouch and handed it to Mo Wuji. \"Brother Mo, we will soon be family, so there's no need for formality. If you ever find yourself short on gold coins, you can always request an advance on your salary. I'll prepare everything; just come to my workshop tomorrow to sign the contract.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji accepted the pouch, feeling the weight of exactly 10 gold coins inside. He felt a surge of joy as he noticed everyone in the association staring at Yan'Er, who appeared anxious. She had likely returned to check on him.</p>\n<p>\"Alright, I'll be at Dan Han Drug Refinery tomorrow...\" Mo Wuji called out, waving his hands as he exited the tea room. \"Girl...\"</p>\n<p>After the initial confusion and the back-and-forth with Lu Jiujun, Mo Wuji regained his composure.</p>\n<p>\"Young Master...\" Yan'Er rushed over to him.</p>\n<p>\"Come on, let's head home and grab something nice to eat on the way,\" Mo Wuji suggested, pulling Yan'Er along as he bid farewell to Lu Jiujun and left the association.</p>\n<p>Truthfully, the half bowl of rice he had for breakfast had barely satisfied his hunger. With the gold coins he now possessed, it would be a shame not to indulge in a feast.</p>\n<p>As they walked, Mo Wuji's gaze was drawn to a tall, light gold tower across the street, emblazoned with the words \"Cheng Ling Spirit Opening Tower.\"</p>\n<p>When he had first come to seek employment, he had only noticed the Rao Zhou Association and had overlooked the Cheng Ling Spirit Opening Tower behind him.</p>\n<p>Yan'Er noticed Mo Wuji's pause and sighed. \"Young Master, that's where you open your spirit. You've been there before.\"</p>\n<p>Yan'Er subtly reminded him of his mortal roots. Understanding her intent, Mo Wuji replied, \"Yan'Er, eating can wait. Let's visit the spirit opening tower first.\"</p>\n<p>To Mo Wuji, obtaining spiritual roots and the ability to cultivate was paramount. His earlier negotiation with Lu Jiujun had been solely to facilitate his cultivation. Given his capabilities, he could easily earn a living.</p>\n<p>\"Ahh...\"</p>\n<p>Yan'Er gasped as Mo Wuji pulled her toward the tower.</p>\n<p>\"Stop right there! This is where people measure and open their spirits. Those not involved are not allowed inside,\" a guard called out as Mo Wuji and Yan'Er approached the entrance.</p>\n<p>\"Young Master, to open your spirit, you must first register and pay the required gold coins to gain entry. If anyone is caught cheating, the punishment is severe...\" Yan'Er whispered, concerned that Mo Wuji might act recklessly.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji nodded, recognizing the gravity of the situation. He was there to learn about the procedures for opening a spirit and the associated costs.</p>\n<p>\"Huh?\" A voice interrupted before Mo Wuji could respond.</p>\n<p>\"Little girl, are you here to open your spirit?\" a man with a white beard inquired, his voice hoarse.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji and Yan'Er turned to see a couple nearby. The man appeared distinguished, while the woman exuded an air of nobility that made those around her hesitant to stare.</p>\n<p>Yan'Er instinctively stepped back and shook her head.</p>",
