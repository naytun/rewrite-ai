Fortunately, this knife he got from Hu Fei was not bad; it did not even bend under the pressure.</p><p>\"Pa!\" The lightning landed harshly on Mo Wuji's chest.</p><p>Mo Wuji could feel a hot searing pain spreading throughout his body. After experiencing that near death crisis in the lightning lake, Mo Wuji was no longer a rookie. He immediately controlled that lightning to enter his second meridian to break apart the clog.</p><p>It might have been be due to luck, but the lightning took the initiative to burn the clog.</p><p>The searing pain rushed towards Mo Wuji's second meridian. Without a sound, Mo Wuji could faintly feel that part of the obstruction had been burnt off.</p><p>While all this was taking place within his meridians, Mo Wuji immediately retreated and climbed to higher ground. This wasn't like the lightning lake; this was a place infested with sea beasts. If he lay on the floor, he would either be killed by the sea beasts, or trampled to death.</p><p>What came to him as a pleasant surprise was that the lightning bolts were gentler than the those in the lightning lake. Fighting with these crocodiles was dangerous, but it was also an opportunity. If he was careful, he could very well open his second meridian.</p><p>On the other hand, the lightning crocodile was a little shocked. Its deadly lightning actually failed to kill Mo Wuji. After a brief moment of inaction, it rushed towards Mo Wuji again, now with a greater vengeance. Seemingly, it was bitter and infuriate that Mo Wuji was not affected by its attack.</p><p>Yet another lightning bolt raced towards Mo Wuji. This time, Mo Wuji was smarter. He knew he wasn't like that immortal master; he could not simply slice the lightning crocodile into four parts. He probably couldn't even slice it into two parts. It was hard to even leave a mark on the crocodile's hard scales.</p><p>Mo Wuji continued to ignore that lightning bolt. In fact, he wasn't even fast enough to avoid it. When the lightning arrived together with the crocodile, Mo Wuji immediately used the knife in his hands to stab at the crocodile's throat.</p><p>That immortal master was right; Mo Wuji's knife could pierce the crocodile's throat. The knife met with some resistance but it was different from stabbing a hard steel plate like before. Red blood splurted out onto Mo Wuji's arm, causing half of his body to be stained bloody red.</p><p>The lightning crocodile cried out, and sent out countless lightning flashes to converge onto Mo Wuji. Mo Wuji's body became riddled with scars, even his hair was charred black.</p><p>Yet another sensation of pain; Mo Wuji felt like his body was being cut into small pieces, and his body trembled endlessly. On the other hand, the lightning crocodile did not seem to be affected by the blood spurting out of its throat as it pounced angrily towards Mo Wuji. Mo Wuji had thoroughly infuriated this Six-footed Lightning Crocodile.</p><p>The pain he felt was not for nothing. Mo Wuji could feel that his second meridian was opening wider.</p><p>Mo Wuji bit his tongue, using his steadfast determination to force himself to stand up. At the same time, he opened a bottle of the channel opening solution and put it into his mouth.</p><p>The surrounding people started to retreat. Mo Wuji did not kill the lightning crocodile, and only managed to anger it. No one was willing to bear the brunt of the crocodile's anger.</p><p>Not only did Mo Wuji not retreat, he endured the excruciating pain as he pounced towards the lightning crocodile.</p><p>Anyone who saw Mo Wuji would think of the same thing: This guy is mad! Under such heavy injuries, he did not retreat but chose to face the lightning crocodile. Was he crazy? Even if he was looking for death, he should not look for such a painful method.</p><p>\"Pa, Pa...\" Two more electro-balls landed on Mo Wuji's chest. At the same time, Mo Wuji's knife also made its way to the crocodile's throat.</p><p>The second meridian continued to be opened by the lightning. The crocodile's gaping wound also became bigger.</p><p>The lightning crocodile had incredible vitality. Despite being stabbed twice, it still crazily rushed towards Mo Wuji.</p><p>Experiencing near death crises before, Mo Wuji was able to stay calm. He continued to drink another bottle of the channel opening solution and thrust out his knife.</p><p>After three times, Mo Wuji's whole body was completely stained with blood. He didn't even know whether the blood was his or the crocodile's. Every time he was hit by the electro-balls, he stubbornly stood back up, drinking the channel opening solution and stabbing out his knife.</p><p>This became a cycle: Mo Wuji stabbed the crocodile, the crocodile sent lightning flashes or electro-balls towards Mo Wuji, Mo Wuji drank the channel opening solution, Mo Wuji stabbed the crocodile...</p><p>The surrounding people looked in shock. This lightning crocodile had incredible vitality, but this little servant had more! These two fellows seemed to be competing in their vitality and perseverance; the one who could no longer stand the pain became the loser. This servant definitely wasn't crazy. How could a crazy person last for so long?</p><p>If not for the large numbers of lightning crocodiles, these people would have stopped to see the battle between Mo Wuji and the lightning crocodile.</p><p>Ultimately, the crocodile was still made of flesh and blood. After being stabbed by Mo Wuji for close to ten times, its huge 3m long body collapsed on the deck.</p><p>The moment the crocodile collapsed, Mo Wuji felt his entire body being relieved.</p><p>His second meridian was finally opened. Mo Wuji's hands started to tremble; he did not know whether this was due to him using excessive force, or his sheer excitement from opening his second meridian.</p><p>As he almost got killed by the lightning crocodile and felt a hellish amount of pain, he also received a new life. This kind of results earned from hardship, made Mo Wuji cherish them more.</p><p>With two meridians opened, Mo Wuji's whole body felt relieved but extremely fatigued. He needed to rest for a while.</p><p>The scene of Mo Wuji bravely using his little life to kill the lightning crocodile remained vividly in everyone's mind. Seemingly inspired by Mo Wuji's heroic drive, more people started to bravely confront the lightning crocodiles. Countless people were killed, but countless lightning crocodiles were killed as well.</p><p>After killing that crocodile, it was only normal for Mo Wuji to sit down and rest. In fact, it would be weird if he didn't.</p><p>But what made everyone go into disbelief was that after resting for a short quarter of an hour, Mo Wuji drank his solution and rushed towards another lightning crocodile.</p><p>A few people looked at Mo Wuji in shock. Was this guy mad? Or was he just ballsy? With his previous performance, no one would blame him if he chose to retreat from the fight. In fact, his act of heroism might even get him the recognition of an immortal master.</p><p>Mo Wuji wasn't mad; he was very clear that this was a rare opportunity. He had his channel opening solution, and there was such an abundant source of lightning to help him open his meridians. Wouldn't he be an idiot if he did not grab this opportunity?</p><p>His sharp knife stabbed into the crocodile's throat. Angry and infuriated, the crocodile pounced at Mo Wuji and spit out an electro-ball.</p><p>The scene replayed itself. Mo Wuji was constantly being struck by the lightning flashes or electro-balls, he drank some solution and fought again.</p><p>Over and over, the cycle continued. Mo Wuji was never discouraged.</p><p>\"This guy is ballsy...\" Some distance away, a young woman saw Mo Wuji's actions and praised in surprise.</p><p>A young man beside her laughed, \"He's just reckless, pitting his life against the sea demon's... Well, you can't blame him. He has never cultivated nor made any contact with martial arts. He can only resort to this barbaric method.\"</p><p>[TL NOTE] Hi readers!
