  "body": "<p>\"Young man, please wait,\" an elderly voice called out just as Mo Wuji was about to exit the association.</p>\n<p>Turning around, Mo Wuji encountered a middle-aged man whose face mirrored the age of his voice.</p>\n<p>\"You called me?\" Mo Wuji assessed the man, noting his sharp eyes that seemed to grasp everything in sight.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, I did. If you don't mind, we could find a quieter place to talk,\" the middle-aged man suggested, gesturing towards a tea room adjacent to the association hall.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji smiled, \"Of course, I don't mind.\"</p>\n<p>As Mo Wuji followed the middle-aged man to the tea room, whispers began to circulate among the association members.</p>\n<p>\"Isn't that Lu Jiujun, the owner of Dan Han Drug Refinery? Everyone knows he's just a fake drug refining assistant. Is he really trying to recruit that madman? Isn't he worried his workshop will shut down again? He can't be that bright.\"</p>\n<p>\"Ha! You know it, yet you still say it. If Lu Jiujun were clever, he wouldn't have let Dan Han Drug Refinery fall apart. He may look shrewd at first glance, but he's not. Just look at the state of Dan Han Drug Refinery.\"</p>\n<p>\"Who doesn't know Lu Jiujun is foolish? It's a shame what happened to Dan Han Drug Refinery. It used to be one of the finest drug refining workshops in Cheng Yu State, perhaps even in the Xing Han Empire. Now, it's just a small workshop. At this rate, it might vanish completely...\"</p>\n<p>\"How lucky Lu Jiujun was to inherit Dan Han Drug Refinery! Even if it failed, at least he had it. He doesn't have to scrounge for jobs like the rest of us.\"</p>\n<p>Unbeknownst to Mo Wuji, these discussions faded into the background as he settled into the tea room with Lu Jiujun. The latter ordered a pot of Rao City's Chunxiao tea.</p>\n<p>As the light green tea was poured, a delicate fragrance wafted through the air. Mo Wuji took a sip, the rich flavor enveloping his senses, prompting him to exclaim, \"Good tea.\"</p>\n<p>Previously, Mo Wuji had not focused on tea but rather on more complex matters. Despite sampling various teas, none compared to this one. He noted that the tea seemed hastily prepared, lacking the meticulous attention to detail that could elevate its flavor even further.</p>\n<p>Lu Jiujun smiled, \"Rao City Chunxiao is one of the three major teas of Cheng Yu State, presented annually as a tribute to the royal clan. What we're drinking is made from old leaves, which are not easily affordable for the average person. Allow me to introduce myself: I am Lu Jiujun, the current owner of Dan Han Drug Refinery.\"</p>\n<p>At this point, Lu Jiujun paused, expecting Mo Wuji to respond with recognition, \"Oh, it's Dan Han Drug Refinery, I know that.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji understood the implication behind Lu Jiujun's words. It seemed Dan Han Drug Refinery held more significance than he initially thought, yet he replied apologetically, \"I'm sorry, Owner Lu, but I really haven't heard of Dan Han Drug Refinery.\"</p>\n<p>Lu Jiujun's jaw dropped in disbelief. Who in Rao Zhou had not heard of Dan Han Drug Refinery? Despite its recent decline and the absorption of many stores and workshops, its past reputation should not have faded so quickly.</p>\n<p>After a moment of surprise, Lu Jiujun chuckled self-deprecatingly, \"I suppose I was overthinking it. Prince Mo has been too focused on restoring his country; naturally, he wouldn't pay attention to commercial matters.\"</p>\n<p>Seeing that Lu Jiujun understood, Mo Wuji directly stated, \"You know my history, Lu Jiujun. You wouldn't be here to hire me as a drug refiner, would you?\"</p>\n<p>Though he had boasted about being a drug refiner in the association, Mo Wuji was aware that no one took his claims seriously.</p>\n<p>Lu Jiujun took a sip of tea, set the cup down calmly, and smiled, \"Prince Mo is correct; I am here to offer you the position of Chief Drug Refiner.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji was taken aback. He instinctively paused, his hand hovering near the cup, and replied incredulously, \"Perhaps Owner Lu hasn't heard of me? Are you sure you didn't mistake my words for mere bragging or the musings of an average person?\"</p>\n<p>Lu Jiujun responded with calm assurance, \"I may not be able to refine drugs, but I have a discerning eye. When you spoke your bold words, I saw a man filled with substance and confidence. That is not the demeanor of someone who is merely boasting. Your recent statements convinced me that you are not an irrational person. Therefore, I decided to take a chance and believe in what you said. So, Prince Mo, are you interested in working with me?\"</p>\n<p>Lu Jiujun added, \"By the way, I also have a nickname: Mad Lu. The reason my Dan Han Drug Refinery fell so quickly was due to my reckless decisions.\"</p>\n<p>Even as he spoke, Lu Jiujun doubted his own words. He wasn't hiring Mo Wuji solely based on confidence. While that played a role, there was a more significant reason he understood well. Mo Wuji's grandfather, Mo Tiancheng, held an identity unknown to most—a high-level drug refiner.</p>\n<p>The Lu family's Dan Han Drug Refinery gained its fame in Rao Zhou largely due to the support of Northern Qin Prefecture Lord, Mo Tiancheng. Despite their friendship, the Lu Clan had to pay a hefty price for Mo Tiancheng's backing.</p>\n<p>In essence, if not for the majority of the profits going to Mo Tiancheng, Dan Han Drug Refinery might not have fallen so swiftly. Thus, even if others doubted Mo Wuji's claims of being a drug refiner, Lu Jiujun held a degree of belief. If he were in Mo Tiancheng's position, he would have certainly passed down his skills to his descendants. Coupled with Mo Wuji's evident confidence, Lu Jiujun felt a glimmer of hope. However, Mo Wuji remained unaware of this underlying connection.</p>\n<p>Upon hearing Lu Jiujun, Mo Wuji regained his composure. He didn't believe Lu Jiujun sought him out for the Chief Drug Refiner position purely out of faith in his honesty. Mo Wuji understood that nothing comes without a cost; if Lu Jiujun were truly so bold, Dan Han Drug Refinery likely wouldn't be in its current predicament.</p>\n<p>\"What? Don't tell me Prince Mo was actually lying? Now that I'm offering you a position, you're backing out?\" Lu Jiujun observed Mo Wuji's silence and added.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji remained unfazed by Lu Jiujun's words, taking another sip of tea before responding, \"I can join, but what would my pay be?\"</p>\n<p>\"50 gold coins per month, with all accommodations provided. Additionally, as long as your requests are reasonable, Dan Han Drug Refinery will do its best to meet them,\" Lu Jiujun concluded, watching Mo Wuji intently. He expected that such a generous offer would excite Mo Wuji. While this salary was not on par with that of an actual drug refiner, it was several times higher than what one would earn at Cheng Ling Pill Workshop.</p>\n<p>However, the reality left Lu Jiujun feeling disheartened. Mo Wuji seemed unfazed, calmly sipping his tea. Just as Lu Jiujun was about to lose patience, Mo Wuji posed an unrelated question, \"Owner Lu, I've heard that opening the spirit is extremely expensive. How much does it actually cost?\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji was no stranger to money. He had once been thrilled at the prospect of earning 10 gold coins when he was unknown, simply seeking a quick job to support Yan'Er and himself. Even if he secured the position, he would likely leave after a month.</p>\n<p>However, Lu Jiujun would certainly not allow him to depart after just one month; a contract would likely bind him.</p>\n<p>Lu Jiujun regarded Mo Wuji with confusion. He had heard that Mo Wuji had previously attempted to open his spirit, only to discover he had a mortal root. What was the intent behind this question?</p>\n<p>Despite not grasping Mo Wuji's motives, Lu Jiujun responded in detail, \"There are three methods to open the spirit. The first is to use an elixir, which is the most common approach. The price varies based on the elixir's grade, with the cheapest costing at least 10,000 gold coins. The second method is...\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji interrupted, \"Owner Lu, if the cheapest option is 10,000 gold coins, then there must be a maximum price, right? What would that be?\"</p>\n<p>Lu Jiujun chuckled, \"There is no maximum price. I've heard that not even the entirety of Cheng Yu State can afford the most precious elixir.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji understood. He had no idea how much Mo Xinghe's parents had paid for an elixir to open his spirit, but he surmised that the cheaper the elixir, the poorer the outcome of the spirit opening.</p>\n<p>Lu Jiujun continued, \"The second method is to enlist an expert to help open the spirit. The fee depends on the expert's discretion. Generally, they won't accept less than 10,000 gold coins, and a starting price of 1 million gold coins is considered cheap. The third method is something not found in Cheng Yu State. I've heard that the Xing Han Empire has an array that can open the spirit, but only those deemed qualified can enter.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji fell silent. Regardless of the method, even if he earned 100 gold coins, it would take years to accumulate enough to open the spirit!</p>\n<p>\"Owner Lu, have you opened your spirit? With a minimum price of 10,000 gold coins, I doubt many can afford that. Does that mean the poor have no chance of opening their spirits?\" After a long pause, Mo Wuji finally spoke.</p>\n<p>Lu Jiujun shook his head, \"I went for a test and found I only had mortal roots. Moreover, I have no interest in cultivation, so I never attempted to open my spirit.\"</p>\n<p>\"Does the test before opening the spirit also cost money?\" Mo Wuji inquired.</p>\n<p>\"Of course, it costs money—usually around 500 gold coins. Even if the test indicates spiritual roots and you manage to open your spirit, it doesn't guarantee you can cultivate.\"</p>\n<p>\"What if the test shows mortal roots? Can you still open the spirit?\"</p>\n<p>Lu Jiujun laughed, \"While I don't know much about this, I do know the success rate would be less than 1%. Only those who refuse to accept their lack of spiritual roots, despite knowing they have mortal roots, would still spend money to attempt to open the spirit.\"</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji finally grasped the situation. His father had been desperate, knowing Mo Wuji had mortal roots, yet still spent money trying to help him open the spirit.</p>",
