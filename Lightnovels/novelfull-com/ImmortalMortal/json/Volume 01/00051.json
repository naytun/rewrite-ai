He did not have the permission to do so for other techniques, but at least for this one, he could make such a decision.</p><p>The moment Mo Wuji intended to open the manual, the middle aged man laughed, “My suggestion would be that if you want to make progress in your cultivation for the long term, it would be better to accumulate some points and purchase a higher quality Mortal technique. The Immortal Mortal Technique only goes by this name in this shop. Once you leave the shop, this technique goes by another name.”</p><p>“What’s the other name?” Mo Wuji blurted.</p><p>The middle aged man pointed at the manual in Mo Wuji’s hands, “Once you open this manual, you will be able to see its actual name.”</p><p>With that, Mo Wuji hurriedly flipped open the manual. Below the words “Immortal Mortal Technique’’, there were a few small unassuming words “Basics of Cultivation”</p><p>When Mo Wuji saw those three words, he almost coughed up blood. If this middle aged man did not remind him, he would have bought this manual. What’s more, if anyone asked him, he would say that he was training in the Immortal Mortal Technique, which might make him a big laughing stock.</p><p>The shop assistant saw that something was amiss, and quickly added, “This is the most basic of the beginner techniques. If you train with this technique, even if you change to another technique in the future, there will be no negative effects. I can assure you, there are no other techniques that are more foundational than this one.”</p><p>Mo Wuji retorted snidely, “Of course there will be no negative effects. Didn’t I just hear that training this Immortal Mortal Technique requires a large amount of time and resources? By the time I have the ability to change to other techniques, won’t I already be close to dying from old age?”</p><p>The shop assistant chuckled, but did not rebut what Mo Wuji said.</p><p>The middle aged man spoke once again, “Technically this shop assistant is not wrong. Even though the technique takes up a long period of time for training, but it has been passed down for countless years, and went through all kinds of refinement, thus making it flawless. Whenever you have a higher quality cultivation technique, you can really swap it out at any moment.”</p><p>Mo Wuji flipped the manual open. The shop assistant did not lie about its contents. The technique was highly detailed, not only stating clearly how to circulate spiritual energy, but also showing diagrams indicating the direction of flow within spirit channels. On top of that, there were introductions to certain parts of the spirit channel network in the body.</p><p>Mo Wuji never cultivated before, and no one had ever taught him how to. The positions and names of spirit channels were completely foreign to him. What more the direction of flow within them.</p><p>The shop assistant took out another book and passed it to Mo Wuji, “My friend, if you purchase the Immortal Mortal Technique from me, I will also give you this introductory book on spirit channels for free.”</p><p>Mo Wuji closed the manual, saying to the shop assistant, “Could you stop bringing up Immortal Mortal Technique. What I want to buy now is this Basics of Cultivation. Speak. What is the lowest price that you can offer? That’s right, I still have 250 points, how much money would I have to add on top of that to get this manual and the free gift?”</p><p>He was rather impatient. Either he bought this manual, or he would leave the shop empty handed. The amount of money he had could not purchase anything else.</p><p>Hearing that Mo Wuji really intended to purchase this Basics of Cultivation, the shop assistant immediately broke into a smile and said, “Just add 70 thousand gold coins…”</p><p>“I’ll add another 50 thousand gold coins. If you are willing to sell it, I will take it off your hands immediately. Otherwise, I’ll go to another shop.” Mo Wuji said without hesitation.</p><p>Subtracting the money spent at the hotel, He only had approximately 100 thousand gold coins on him. He would have to scrimp and save this sum of money. Initially, he felt that 100 over thousand gold coins was a large sum. But only after walking into this shop did Mo Wuji realise that he was poorer than a beggar. At this rate, he would have to find some way to earn money for meals.</p><p>“Deal.” The shop assistant passed both the Immortal Mortal Technique and the Introduction to Spirit Channels to Mo Wuji without hesitation.</p><p>Mo Wuji took out the orange rewards card to pay with his 250 points, then taking out a 50 thousand dollar gold note. He finally obtained the cultivation technique of his dreams: the Immortal Mortal Technique. No wait, it’s the Basics of Cultivation.</p><p>Carefully wrapping both books up and stuffing them into his clothes, Mo Wuji decided to find somewhere to test his spirit roots, before going back and seeing if he could cultivate.</p><p>As Mo Wuji was about to leave, he turned around and saw that the middle aged man had not left yet. The man did not know Mo Wuji at all, but yet still helped to explain many things to him. It looked like this guy was here to look for him, but he had just arrived in Chang Luo City!</p><p>“Thanks brother for all those explanations. I noticed that you’ve been here for quite some time, could it be that you’re here to look for me?” Mo Wuji respectfully asked.</p><p>The middle aged man smiled and nodded, “I didn’t help much just now, and you still purchased this manual in the end. But you’re right, I’m here for you.”</p><p>Without prompting from Mo Wuji, he explained, “This is a token representing a service disciple of the Formless Blade Sect.”</p><p>Mo Wuji instinctively took the ice cold token, and asked with suspicion, “But I don’t even know you, why are you giving me this token?”</p><p>The middle aged man warmly replied, “Don’t worry, this token was given to me by Qin Xiangyu. She asked me to pass it to you. If you don’t intend to use it, just keep it by your side. You never know when it might come in handy.”</p><p>Qin Xiangyu? Mo Wuji immediately remembered the lady that lived next to him. That woman seemed pretty normal, but she gave off an aura of distinction. Her figure was even more attractive. That sort of curvaceous body was not only beautiful, but also did not seem like kitsch. Perhaps, this was what an actual aura felt like.</p><p>He only helped her conveniently initially, who knew that this woman would remember him, even giving him a title of service disciple within a sect.</p><p>This didn’t make sense, Qin Xiangyu was a servant like him. How could she have obtained a token for service disciples from such an immortal sect, and afford to give one to him?</p><p>Seemingly reading Mo Wuji’s mind, the middle aged man explained, “Xiangyu’s younger brother, Qin Chen, is the Formless Blade Sect’s second elder’s direct disciple, and had left home for over ten years. Because of the Spring Immortal Gate Conference, they were able to meet, and she obtained this token from him.”</p><p>Mo Wuji finally understood. No wonder she could easily obtain such a token.</p><p>“As this matter has been concluded, I will take my leave.” The middle aged man did not introduce himself, and after Mo Wuji received the token, automatically bade farewell and left.</p><p>After the man had left, Mo Wuji then grabbed the shop assistant and asked, “May I ask what level is the Formless Blade Sect?”</p><p>The shop assistant looked at the token in Mo Wuji’s hand in admiration, replying, “The Formless Blade Sect might not be the best sect around, but it’s at least an Earth level Sect, a below average one.”</p><p>Only a below average Earth level sect. Mo Wuji was slightly disappointed, but still felt greatly indebted to Qin Xiangyu. There might be many people who keep grudges, but much less who remember other people’s goodwill.</p><p>Putting the token away, Mo Wuji decided to still get his spirit roots tested. If he had spirit roots, and of a decent quality, then he might actually stand a chance to go for the Spring Immortal Gate Conference. When that happens, he would not be only a service disciple, maybe even an outer disciple.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
