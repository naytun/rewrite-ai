He was always smiling, and he did not put on airs even towards a house attendant like Mo Wuji.</p><p>Feng Cheng Marquisate’s heir, Ji Changhe also stepped forward and advised Cao Hao.</p><p>This was a place where geniuses across Xing Han Empire gathered in their journey to Chang Luo. Causing a ruckus here would get one punished. A light punishment would be the stripping of participation rights and being sent back home. On the other hand, a punishment could even be as heavy as a direct execution! It didn't matter whether one was a prefecture prince, one could still be executed. A genius from Cheng Yu State was nothing in this large Xing Han Empire.</p><p>Cao Hao snorted and stared fiercely at Mo Wuji. Then, he turned and walked towards the inn. From the looks of things, Cao Hao probably would not act against Mo Wuji.</p><p>\"Mo Wuji, just because you helped the little miss doesn't mean you can do whatever you want. If you act like this again, we'll immediately send you back to Cheng Yu State,\" Shao Lan said while giving Mo Wuji an unsatisfied glare.</p><p>Han Ning's face was also unsightly. Even though she did not say anything, it was clear that she agreed with Shao Lan's words.</p><p>Mo Wuji smiled and did not care. When he gave Han Ning the Two-leaved Fire Grass, she was extremely grateful to him. However, as time passed, her gratitude tapered down. This was the reason why Mo Wuji was unwilling to be friends with people from big families. They were used to being in a high position overlooking the rest of the world. As a result, they acted arrogantly and did not treat others as their equal.</p><p>They would only greet you with a smile if you gave them benefits. Once the benefits were gone, that smile would disappear as well. They would definitely not remember what you had done for them.</p><p>This trip to the royal capital was Han Ning's reward to Mo Wuji for his meritorious service. If he committed a mistake, she would simply take away this reward and even punish him. This was not a relationship between friends, but a superior-inferior relationship.</p><p>Mo Wuji came from Earth so he would not accept being the inferior within a relationship. Sooner or later, he would separate from Han Ning. Before that happened, he would dedicate his efforts for her. Han Chengan's saving grace might have been unintentional and he might not have expected any returns, but Mo Wuji would definitely return the favour.</p><p>\"Why don't we all settle down. We still have to stay here for the next three days,\" Han Ning said as she followed Cao Hao and co. into one of the inns.</p><p>\"Wait...\" After Han Ning and Shao Lan entered the inn, Mo Wuji and the other two were stopped.</p><p>\"He [1], what is the meaning of this?\" Peng Maohua's face turned ugly when he was stopped.</p><p>Mo Wuji recognised the man blocking their way. He was He Feng, one of Cao Hao's attendants.</p><p>Han Ning did not stay silent and questioned Cao Hao, \"Cao Hao, what's the meaning of this?\"</p><p>Before Cao Hao could speak, an attendant from the inn came out and said apologetically, \"Dear customers, we are really sorry but our Yue Hai Inn does not have enough rooms. Your group of five only gets one room so these three attendants would have to stay outside or in our warehouse.\"</p><p>Han Ning's gaze landed on Yang Junsong, \"Yan Junsong, you're in charge of booking the rooms. Why is it that my house attendants do not get a room while the others do?\"</p><p>Cao Hao said loudly, \"Ah, there is no other way. We arranged the rooms on a first-come, first-serve basis. You can't expect my attendants to sleep outside even though they came first right?\"</p><p>Yang Junsong's face looked rather awkward as he embarrassedly asked Cao Hao, \"Prince, we are all part of the same team. Why don't you allow them to squeeze with your attendants?\"</p><p>Cao Hao thought for a long time before saying reluctantly, \"How about this... I will get my guys to squeeze. But there's only enough space for two people. That, that who... Aren't you very strong and brave? You can stay outside then.\"</p><p>Everyone knew that Cao Hao was specifically targeting Mo Wuji.</p><p>Han Ning was a favoured genius, and could be considered a Channel Opening Stage cultivator. Even though she did not like that Mo Wuji offended Cao Hao, she did not remain silent, \"Cao Hao, are you sure you want to do this?\"</p><p>Everyone could feel that Han Ning was on the verge of exploding. Only Cao Hao seemingly did not feel it as he continued to say calmly, \"Sister Ning, our families have a very deep relationship. Otherwise I would not have brought you to find Immortal Master Lu. I care for you and I do not wish for you to cause a fission in our cooperation just because of one person.\"</p><p>After hearing Cao Hao's words, Han Ning calmed down like a deflated balloon. Her fiery rage was extinguished as she remained silent.</p><p>In just a few seconds, she turned to Mo Wuji and said, \"Wuji, it's going to be tough on you. Just erect a tent outside and stay outside.\"</p><p>She did not say another word as she turned and left.</p><p>Mo Wuji smiled and he did not care. On the way to the royal capital, he would try his best to help Han Ning. Once they reached the capital, he would no longer have anything to do with her.</p><p>\"Wuji, wait... I will accompany you.\" Ding Bu'Er hastily said. He also turned to Han Ning and said, \"Little miss, I will accompany Wuji.\"</p><p>\"Do whatever you want,\" Han Ning coldly threw out that sentence and hurried into the inn.</p><p>Mao Penghua hesitated but he chose to enter the inn with Han Ning and co.</p><p>After leaving the inn, Mo Wuji patted Ding Bu'Er's shoulder, \"Bu'Er, you have a nice comfortable room. Why do you want to follow me and sleep in a tent?\"</p><p>Bu'Er laughed, \"Wuji, do you know why I'm even able to join this trip? Isn't it because of you? I'm very sure that, after we get to the royal capital, and if the little miss gets selected by a sect, there'll be nothing left for me. Previously, in the Thunder Fog Forest, I believe that you did not find the Two-leaved Fire Grass by luck. Since I can't follow the little miss, I can only follow you. Don't ask me to go back to Cheng Yu because I know a certain someone will not go back as well.\"</p><p>\"Bu'Er, I can see that you'll have a promising future now that you've chosen to follow me,\" Mo Wuji joked.</p><p>\"Mo Xinghe...\" A clear, crisp voice interrupted his conversation with Ding Bu'Er.</p><p>\"Oh, it's Miss Wen. How fortunate to see you here. You're as elegant as always. But can I ask Miss Wen not to call me by my previous name? I have already changed it to Mo Wuji.\" After leaving Rao Zhou City, Mo Wuji felt like shackles had been removed from him. He no longer had to be worried or afraid about his words and actions. He did not expect that Wen Manzhu would also go to the royal capital. Like Han Ning, she should be a participant of the Spring Immortal's Gate.</p><p>\"Ah.. Wuji, it's getting late. I should set up the tent before all the good spots get taken away. Enjoy your conversation ah.\" Ding Bu'Er saw Mo Wuji and Wen Manzhu talking so he found an excuse to leave. He knew about Mo Wuji's situation and that things were awkward between Mo Wuji and Wen Manzhu.</p><p>\"Sorry, it slipped my mind,\" Wen Manzhu said apologetically.</p><p>She had many doubts in her heart. She was sure she understood Mo Wuji more than anybody else, but in the two recent times that she had met Mo Wuji, she felt like she no longer knew him. She could see that Mo Wuji had changed drastically. In the Cheng Yu Worker's Union, Mo Wuji felt foreign to her, like a knife covered with flour. Now, Mo Wuji was like a knife hidden in a scabbard.</p><p>\"Wuji... Can we talk?\" Wen Manzhu said. In fact, she had wanted to speak with Mo Wuji for a long time.</p><p>Ever since Mo Wuji came up the Nine Lives Healing Solution, he nestled in a Prefecture Duke's residence and never came out. She tried to find ways to meet him but she was unsuccessful. She even heard from her father that Mo Wuji gave the Nine Lives Healing Solution formula away to protect himself.</p><p>She found it hard to understand. Why was it that there were such huge changes every since Mo Xinghe changed his name?</p><p>Mo Wuji laughed nonchalantly, \"If the senior beside you doesn't mind, we can talk for as long as you want ah.\"</p><p>[1] ‘He’ is a surname in this situation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
