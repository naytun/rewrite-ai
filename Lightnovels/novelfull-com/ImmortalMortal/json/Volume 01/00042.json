Tuo Baqi also settled down. Even though he suspected that Mo Wuji was the one who knocked him out, he did not want to cause any troubles on his way to Chang Luo.</p><p>On the other hand, Mo Wuji, Yuan Zhenyi and Ding Bu'Er met daily to drink and explore the Makeshift Market. Hearing Yuan Zhenyi's peculiar stories and experiences with cultivators, Mo Wuji really loosened up.</p><p>One particular morning, just as Mo Wuji was lifting his tent flap to leave for his daily washing up, he heard a loud rumble. He looked up to see a gigantic ship docked by the seaside and he almost called out in surprise.</p><p>The deck of the ship alone could fit several football fields. If the rooms and compartments at the centre were included, the ship should have had an estimated area of 100,000 square meters.</p><p>Mo Wuji took in a breath of cold air. It was bigger than an aircraft carrier! An aircraft carrier was designed with a huge deck. On the other hand, this ship was designed with large decks surrounding an even larger living quarters, which were at the centre of the ship. These rooms were in layers, just like a modern apartment building.</p><p>What powers this huge thing? Earth's aircraft carrier was not as big as this, and it already required nuclear power to power it. There shouldn't be nuclear power here too, right?</p><p>\"Wuji, you're scared, right? I also got a huge shock when I first saw it, \" Ding Bu'Er's voice called out.</p><p>At this moment, Mo Wuji could see that he was not the only one in shock and awe; the seaside was filled with people.</p><p>\"Wuji, quickly pack up and follow me to the ship. Bu'Er, you can follow your little miss up the ship,\" Yuan Zhenyi said as he walked out from a crowd.</p><p>Ding Bu'Er understood that he would have to follow Han Ning to get on the ship, \"Wuji, Brother Zhenyi, I will go first. We'll meet at Chang Luo.\"</p><p>Yuan Zhenyi laughed, \"What Chang Luo? We can meet on the ship itself. There are very few restrictions on this ship; as long as you have money, you can have a very comfortable life on the ship.\"</p><p>...</p><p>Yuan Zhenyi was protecting a kind-looking noble named Ji Xing. When Mo Wuji followed Yuan Zhenyi up the ship, he only smiled and nodded to Mo Wuji, not saying anything.</p><p>After an hour, Mo Wuji and Yuan Zhenyi were assigned to a large shared house for 50 people.</p><p>\"Zhenyi, if we stay in this shared house, how will we help if anything happens to Ji Xing?\" Mo Wuji was no longer a rookie and he knew how dangerous this ship could be.</p><p>\"He has his personal bodyguard. If anything happens, we just need to hurry and rush over. Actually, guards like us mainly protect the young master from sea demons. I heard that there have been many sea demon attacks on the way to Chang Luo. When that happens, we can rush over and protect him swiftly. After all, he is also on the same level as us. Only the extreme geniuses get to stay at the higher levels. Well, if anything happens, you don't have to go. Ji Xing understands that you are only borrowing Aunt Eleven's place to board this ship, and you're not actually a guard,\" Yuan Zhenyi explained.</p><p>Hearing about the sea demons, Mo Wuji became really curious. This ship was so huge, what kind of sea demon would actually dare to attack this ship?</p><p>Mo Wuji and Yuan Zhenyi were among the last to come, and were assigned beds close to the door. Many people go in and out of the door, making it difficult for it to rest.</p><p>\"Wuji, this ship is different from the beach before. If anyone gets killed here, nothing much will happen to the killer. To avoid anything unfortunate, try not to make conflicts with others,\" Yuan Zhenyi pulled up his bed next to Mo Wuji and whispered.</p><p>Hearing Yuan Zhenyi's words, the neighbouring people also slightly nodded their heads.</p><p>Mo Wuji did not need Yuan Zhenyi to remind him; he would avoid trouble here to safely get to Chang Luo. Once he reached Chang Luo, there were two important things he needed to do. Firstly, he needed a cultivation technique. Secondly, he needed to find a source of lightning which was not fatal, so that he could open all his body's meridians.</p><p>Nearly an hour later, Mo Wuji felt a slight tremor and knew that the ship's engine had started.</p><p>\"Zhenyi, what powers this ship?\" Mo Wuji could not suppress his curiosity and asked.</p><p>Yuan Zhenyi shook his head, \"I'm also not sure. This is also the first time I boarded this ship.\"</p><p>\"I heard that there's a powerful immortal master who uses a powerful array to drive this ship. I also heard that it might be some sort of energy source which powers this ship. That energy source is very useful for cultivation and can be traded,\" a sweet, magnetic female voice sounded over.</p><p>Mo Wuji turned his head to see that there was a woman sleeping on the bed beside him. She was around 30 years old. Her hair was tied in a tight bundle, her skin was pale white, her facial features were not very outstanding but there's this beauty about her. Together with her voice, she could be considered a very splendid woman.</p><p>Mo Wuji subconsciously sat up and asked puzzledly, \"There's co-ed living here?\"</p><p>Yuan Zhenyi laughed, \"Why would there be a need to separate the men and women? Being able to stay in this kind of shared house is our good luck!\"</p><p>The woman smiled and also sat up, nodding at Mo Wuji and Yuan Zhenyi, \"Greetings, I'm Qin Xiangyu from the Ba Prefecture.\"</p><p>When Qin Xiangyu sat up, Mo Wuji found her body to be more perfect than her face.</p><p>Mo Wuji laughed, \"I'm Mo Wuji from Cheng Yu, and this is Yuan Zhenyi from Chang Yan.\"</p><p>\"Aren't Chang Yan and Cheng Yu at war? You two...\" Yet another person interrupted. This time, it was a youth with light golden hair.</p><p>Yuan Zhenyi said with a slight disdain, \"The war between Chang Yan and Cheng Yu has nothing to do with us.\"</p><p>\"Wuji...\" The sound of hurried footsteps could be heard. Mo Wuji easily recognised that it was Ding Bu'Er's voice.</p><p>Mo Wuji hurriedly got down from his bed and asked, \"Bu'Er, what happened... Why is there blood on your body?\"</p><p>After slowing down his pants, Ding Bu'Er hurriedly said, \"Some people have acted against the little miss. Peng Maohua and I aren't strong enough. From the looks of it, those people are looking to kill the little miss...\"</p><p>Mo Wuji furrowed his eyebrows; the ship just started and something like this happened? He did not ask anything further and said, \"Come, bring me over.\"</p><p>\"Wait...\" Yuan Zhenyi stopped Mo Wuji. \"Wuji, that Han Ning drove you out, and did not even allow you on this ship to Chang Luo. You have nothing to do with her anymore, why do you need to put your feet back into these muddy waters? Furthermore, the help you've given her was more than enough to repay her.\"</p><p>Mo Wuji said calmly, \"Her father may not have intended for it, but he did save my life. Perhaps what I gave her was enough to repay her, but in my heart, a saving grace cannot be repaid through items or money. Now that I know something bad is happening to her, I do not feel comfortable leaving her alone. On the account that the Old Duke saved me, I will help her one more time. After we reach Chang Luo, we can go on our separate paths. Zhenyi, you can wait for me here. Bu'Er, let's go.\"</p><p>Finishing his words, Mo Wuji was prepared to rush out of the shared house. He lived by this principle: Gratitude and grudges must be repaid. The Old Duke's saving grace would be repaid with another saving grace. Regarding the Two-leaved Fire Grass, Han Ning could take it as a gift.</p><p>There was also another reason why he had to save Han Ning. He might have been driven out by Han Ning, but Ding Bu'Er was still under her. He might not need to save her, but he needed to rescue Ding Bu'Er. Helping Han Ning was the same as helping Ding Bu'Er.</p><p>Yuan Zhenyi laughed, \"Aren't we brothers? If you're going, then I'm going too. Let's go!\"</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
