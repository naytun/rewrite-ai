  "body": "<p>Mo Wuji did not assist Yan’Er to her feet, sensing the immense pressure and suffering she endured after Mo Xinghe's descent into madness. He gazed at the distant silhouettes of towering buildings, clenching his fist in determination. \"Starting from scratch isn't a problem,\" he thought.</p>\n<p>Despite the monarchy-like system in this world, its technological advancements mirrored those of Earth, with public transportation and electronic devices. Mo Wuji felt confident in his ability to survive.</p>\n<p>\"Yan’Er, let's head back,\" Mo Wuji suggested, pulling Yan’Er, who seemed lost, as he admired the skyscrapers.</p>\n<p>Though he was reborn from Earth, reclaiming the Northern Qin Prefecture seemed impossible. While he might not aspire to kingship, Mo Wuji believed he could establish himself here, given his expertise as a top biologist and botanist. His ability to extract plant essences to create a meridian-opening solution had led to his lover's betrayal, ultimately resulting in his rebirth in this world.</p>\n<p>The value of his solution remained uncertain. The existence of meridians was a debated topic, often mentioned in traditional Chinese medicine, yet rarely proven. However, if meridians could be expanded to a tangible state, one's power could increase significantly, potentially leading to Olympic victories.</p>\n<p>Unexpectedly, his lover, whom he trusted with his life, betrayed him at his moment of success. He still couldn't comprehend why she stabbed him with a dagger.</p>\n<p>\"Yes, Master...\" Yan’Er finally calmed, her eyes glimmering.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji sighed, \"Yan’Er, do I look like a young master? Call me by my name from now on. The past is behind us. Today marks a new beginning. My name is Mo Wuji, not Mo Xinghe.\"</p>\n<p>\"Yes, Master,\" Yan’Er replied quickly.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji didn't press further; some habits were hard to break. \"It's getting dark, let's go back. Tomorrow, I'll find a job.\"</p>\n<p>Though Mo Wuji hadn't returned home, he had plans. With his parents deceased and the family's wealth gone, the Mo Family was bankrupt. Mo Xinghe's madness added to their struggles. Yan’Er worked tirelessly, even playing along with Mo Wuji's delusions. Their survival was a feat in itself.</p>\n<p>\"Master, you don't need to work. Stay home, and I'll find another job,\" Yan’Er insisted, trying to dissuade him.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji observed Yan’Er's worn dress and simple hair ornament, saying nothing. Words couldn't convey the hardships Yan’Er endured with Mo Xinghe.</p>\n<p>Rao Zhou City had castle gates and walls, but no guards. People came and went freely, day or night. The gates symbolized status rather than defense.</p>\n<p>Mo Xinghe's focus on restoring his country left him oblivious to Rao Zhou City's dynamics. Mo Wuji, piecing together Mo Xinghe's memories, realized the city's bustling nature.</p>\n<p>Entering the city with Yan’Er, Mo Wuji was struck by Rao Zhou City's vibrant energy. Crowded streets and brightly lit shops reminded him of a modern Earth city.</p>\n<p>This lively area was beyond Mo Wuji's means. After bypassing the busy streets, they reached a dimly lit, disorganized residential area after an hour's walk.</p>\n<p>From afar, Mo Wuji saw their cluttered living space. Despite nearly free rent, they struggled to afford it. Without the landlord's sympathy, they might be homeless.</p>\n<p>\"Aiyo, the king is back. Make way for him,\" a voice interrupted Mo Wuji's thoughts.</p>\n<p>\"Hu Fei, move aside,\" Yan’Er, usually trailing Mo Wuji, stepped forward protectively, pushing him behind her.</p>\n<p>In the dim light, Mo Wuji saw a youth with heavily gelled hair. Though Hu Fei claimed to make way, he blocked the street defiantly.</p>\n<p>\"Little Yan’Er, Big Brother Hu bought you some pig meat. You're making me sad,\" Hu Fei said, fiddling with a lotus leaf packet.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji's stomach growled. Yan’Er hesitated, eyeing the packet. Alone, she wouldn't care about Hu Fei. But today, Mo Wuji hadn't eaten, and their home was devoid of food. What could she do?</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji, unaware of Yan’Er's thoughts, acted before Hu Fei could touch her. He kicked Hu Fei in the chest.</p>\n<p>Hu Fei, surprised by Mo Wuji's reaction, staggered back. Mo Wuji felt as if he kicked steel, forced to retreat from the impact.</p>\n<p>\"Master, are you alright?\" Yan’Er rushed to support Mo Wuji.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji, shocked by Hu Fei's resilience, wondered if he was a martial artist.</p>\n<p>\"You’re courting death...\" Hu Fei, enraged by Mo Xinghe's unexpected defiance, drew a knife and charged at Mo Wuji.</p>\n<p>Bystanders watched silently as Hu Fei advanced. No one intervened.</p>\n<p>\"Hu Fei, stop! It's broad daylight, and you dare commit murder?\" Yan’Er cried, unaware it was night.</p>\n<p>\"Ha ha, I've wanted to rid of this fool. He attacked me first, so even if I kill him, I'll only face a fine. Yan’Er, I'm doing this for you. Follow me, and you'll have food and clothes,\" Hu Fei taunted, undeterred.</p>\n<p>Yan’Er, desperate, shielded Mo Wuji with her body.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji, now calm, recalled Cheng Yu State's law: if attacked first, killing in defense resulted in a minor fine.</p>\n<p>Regretting nothing, Mo Wuji pulled Yan’Er aside, facing Hu Fei. \"Hu Fei, touch me, and you'll die a horrible death,\" he warned.</p>",
