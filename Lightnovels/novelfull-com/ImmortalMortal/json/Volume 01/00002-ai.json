  "body": "<p>Mo Wuji did not assist Yan’Er in getting up. He sensed the immense pressure and suffering she had endured since Mo Xinghe's descent into madness. As he gazed at the distant silhouettes of the high-rise buildings, he clenched his fist in determination. “Even if I have to start from scratch, what's wrong with that?”</p>\n<p>This world, though seemingly a monarchy, boasted a level of science and technology akin to Earth, complete with public transport and electronic devices. How could he fear for his survival?</p>\n<p>“Yan’Er, let's head back first,” Mo Wuji said, gently pulling her up as she remained lost in thought.</p>\n<p>Despite his rebirth from Earth, reclaiming the Northern Qin Prefecture felt like an impossible dream.</p>\n<p>While he may not aspire to be a king, Mo Wuji was confident he could carve out a place for himself here. After all, he had been a leading biologist and botanist in his previous life. His ability to extract essences from various plants and concoct a solution to open meridians had led to his lover's betrayal, ultimately resulting in his rebirth in this new world.</p>\n<p>He remained uncertain about the true value of his solution. The concept of meridians, often referenced in traditional Chinese medicine, existed in a gray area. How many could genuinely prove their existence or publish research on them?</p>\n<p>But imagine if meridians could be expanded to the point of being tangible. The potential for power would be immense—one could compete in Olympic long-distance running or weightlifting and stand a chance of victory.</p>\n<p>What he never anticipated was that the woman he had envisioned spending his life with would betray him. To this day, he struggled to comprehend why she would stab him in the back at the moment of his success.</p>\n<p>“Yes, Master...” Yan’Er finally found her voice, a glimmer of hope in her eyes.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji sighed, “Yan’Er, do I appear to be a young master? From now on, call me by my name. The past is behind us. Today marks a new beginning. My name is no longer Mo Xinghe; I am Mo Wuji.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, Master,” Yan’Er replied quickly.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji chose not to press the issue further; some habits were too ingrained to change. “The sky is darkening; let's return. Tomorrow, I will seek employment.”</p>\n<p>Though he had yet to return home, he had some plans in mind. With the death of his parents and the collapse of his family's wealth, the Mo Family had long since gone bankrupt. Following that, Mo Xinghe had lost his sanity. Alongside work, Yan’Er would have to engage in this foolish game with him. Their mere survival was a small blessing.</p>\n<p>“Master, you don’t need to find a job. From now on, just stay home. I can find work; that will suffice.” Yan’Er quickly interjected upon hearing Mo Wuji's intention to seek employment.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji glanced at Yan’Er's tattered dress and the simple hair ornament adorning her yellow hair, but he remained silent. Some truths could not be conveyed through words alone. Until his death, Mo Xinghe had never grasped the hardships Yan’Er faced alongside him.</p>\n<p>Rao Zhou City had castle gates and walls, yet no guards. Day or night, anyone could come and go freely.</p>\n<p>In essence, the city gates and walls of Rao Zhou City served as symbols of status rather than as defenses against war.</p>\n<p>Mo Xinghe had been fixated on restoring his country, oblivious to the dynamics of Rao Zhou City. Mo Wuji could only glean from Mo Xinghe's faint memories that Rao Zhou City was bustling with activity.</p>\n<p>Upon entering the city with Yan’Er, Mo Wuji was immediately enveloped by the vibrant chaos of Rao Zhou City. Wide streets teemed with a dense flow of people, flanked by brightly lit shops. For a moment, he questioned whether he had stepped into a modern city from Earth.</p>\n<p>However, this lively area was not a place Mo Wuji could afford to reside in. After navigating through the busy streets for nearly an hour, they arrived at a disheveled residential area, where the lights flickered dimly.</p>\n<p>From a distance, Mo Wuji could see the disarray of their living space. Even though the rent was nearly nonexistent, it was still beyond their means. If not for the landlord's sympathy, they might not even have a roof over their heads.</p>\n<p>“Aiyo, the king is back. We better make way for him,” a sudden voice broke Mo Wuji's train of thought.</p>\n<p>“Hu Fei, move aside,” Yan’Er, who had been half a step behind Mo Wuji, suddenly stepped forward like an angry little leopard, pushing Mo Wuji behind her.</p>\n<p>In the dim light, Mo Wuji spotted a youth with slicked-back hair. Though he claimed to make way for Mo Wuji, he stood defiantly in the middle of the street.</p>\n<p>“Little Yan’Er, Big Brother Hu brought you half a catty of pig meat. You’re making me feel sad,” Hu Fei said, fiddling with a lotus leaf packet in his hands.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji's stomach rumbled disappointingly. Yan’Er, who had initially intended to push Hu Fei aside, hesitated as she eyed the lotus leaf packet.</p>\n<p>“Isn't this better? You and Big Brother Hu are no strangers...” Hu Fei said, moving closer to put his arm around Yan’Er's shoulders. Despite the scar on her face and her malnourished body, she still possessed a pretty face.</p>\n<p>Yan’Er's eyes flickered with uncertainty. If she were alone, she would have dismissed Hu Fei without a second thought. But today, the young master had gone the entire day without food, and his stomach was growling. What could she do if they returned home with nothing to eat?</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji was unaware of Yan’Er's internal struggle. He didn't wait for Hu Fei's hand to reach Yan’Er's shoulder before he kicked out with his foot.</p>\n<p>Hu Fei was caught off guard by Mo Wuji's sudden reaction, receiving a solid kick to the chest.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji felt as if he had kicked a steel wall, stumbling back from the impact.</p>\n<p>“Master, are you alright?” Yan’Er rushed over to support Mo Wuji.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji glanced at Hu Fei, who had only taken a single step back, and was taken aback. His current body was indeed weak; he couldn't even knock Hu Fei down. Was Hu Fei a martial artist?</p>\n<p>“You're asking for death...” Hu Fei, shocked by the weak Mo Xinghe's sudden defiance, seethed with anger and drew a foot-long knife from his waist, charging at Mo Wuji.</p>\n<p>Bystanders witnessed Hu Fei's aggression but remained silent, offering no assistance.</p>\n<p>“Hu Fei, stop! It’s broad daylight; you dare to commit murder?” Yan’Er's face turned pale, failing to notice that night had already fallen.</p>\n<p>“Ha ha, I've long wanted to rid myself of this idiot. Today, he struck first. Even if I kill him, I’ll only face a fine. Yan’Er, I’m doing this for you. If you come with me, you’ll have food and clothes...” Hu Fei continued, showing no intention of backing down.</p>\n<p>Yan’Er's anxiety peaked. She had no choice but to shield Mo Wuji with her body.</p>\n<p>In that moment, Mo Wuji regained his composure. He recalled that Cheng Yu State had laws allowing for self-defense; if someone attacked you first and you killed them, you would only face a minor penalty.</p>\n<p>Realizing it was too late for regrets, Mo Wuji quickly pulled Yan’Er aside and fixed his gaze on Hu Fei. “Hu Fei, if you dare to touch a single hair on me, you will die a horrible death.”</p>",
