  "body": "<p>In the bustling capital of Cheng Yu State, Rao Zhou City, Mo Wuji's decision to apply as a drug refiner assistant left the recruitment officer and the surrounding crowd in shock. It was uncommon to see someone as young as Mo Wuji in this role, especially since most assistants were elderly men. His youth suggested great potential and a promising future, a rarity not just in Cheng Yu State but throughout the Xing Han Empire.</p>\n<p>However, Mo Wuji faced a significant hurdle: he lacked the necessary qualifications. When asked about his credentials, he admitted he was self-taught and had neither a certificate nor a teacher. This admission drew laughter from the crowd, who saw him as a fraud. The recruitment officer, representing the prestigious Cheng Ling Pill Workshop, was not amused by what she perceived as a mockery.</p>\n<p>Amidst the tension, a young man named Cai Zhaoxu mocked Mo Wuji, but his laughter was cut short by Wen Manzhu, a prominent figure in the association. Wen Manzhu, the daughter of a Prefecture Marquis, approached Mo Wuji with a pouch of gold coins intended for Yan’Er, a gesture Mo Wuji declined, valuing his pride over financial aid.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji's encounter with Wen Manzhu revealed his disdain for opportunistic relationships, contrasting with his appreciation for Yan’Er's unwavering loyalty. Despite Wen Manzhu's offer of employment at her family's ore refinery, Mo Wuji rejected it, expressing his ambition to become a drug refiner rather than settling for lesser roles.</p>\n<p>His bold declarations were met with skepticism and laughter, as the crowd doubted his sincerity and sanity. Yet, Mo Wuji's resolve was clear: he would not repeat past mistakes and would pursue his true aspirations with renewed determination.</p>",
