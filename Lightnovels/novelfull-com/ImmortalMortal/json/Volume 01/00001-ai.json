I’ve succeeded…” In a chaotic lab, Mo Wuji laughed maniacally, clutching a porcelain bottle as if he had lost his mind.</p>\n<p>“Ding…” A glass cup shattered on the floor, tea spilling everywhere. A stunning girl in a crimson cheongsam stood at the doorway, staring blankly at the frenzied Mo Wuji. After a moment, she spoke, her voice trembling, “Wuji, did you really succeed?”</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji turned to the beautiful girl at the entrance, realizing that Xia Ruoyin had come to serve him tea. The news had shocked her so much that the cup slipped from her hands.</p>\n<p>“Ruoyin, there’s no mistake this time. I tried just half of the bottle, and I could feel a fire igniting in my meridians, gradually opening and expanding them. They’re still in the process of opening, but we’ve succeeded.”</p>\n<p>With the porcelain bottle in hand, Mo Wuji excitedly approached her, grasping her hands. “Ruoyin, you’ve worked so hard. All these years, I’ve been consumed by my research on the Channel Opening Solution, neglecting you. Let’s marry. Afterward, we’ll start a company to produce the Channel Opening Solution. I believe we’ll create a sensation worldwide.”</p>\n<p>The girl finally steadied herself, though her voice still quivered. “Did you record the drug formula?”</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji nodded. “Don’t worry, Ruoyin. I have all the information on my laptop. Here, take a look…”</p>\n<p>As he turned to walk toward his laptop, a sudden chill gripped him, followed by a searing pain in his back. He glanced down to see the tip of a blade protruding from his chest, realizing he had been stabbed from behind.</p>\n<p>The agony made him dizzy, and his strength began to wane. Slowly, he turned his head, his gaze landing on the hands gripping the blade—Xia Ruoyin’s. With wide eyes, he whispered, “Ruoyin… Why? Why?”</p>\n<p>He couldn’t fathom that the woman he had cherished for so long would betray him.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry, Wuji. I’m so sorry…” Xia Ruoyin trembled, her body shaking as she realized she had killed the man she had loved for over a decade.</p>\n<p>Two tears slipped from Mo Wuji’s eyes as he felt his body grow colder. Consciousness faded, and his vision dimmed, yet he fought to keep his eyes open, staring at Xia Ruoyin. “If you wanted the formula… you just had to ask. I would have given it to you… why?”</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji didn’t cry because he was dying; he had never shed tears in his life. But today, the deepest pain came not from his wound but from the betrayal of his beloved.</p>\n<p>Perhaps Xia Ruoyin didn’t understand her place in Mo Wuji’s heart. If she had simply asked, he would have willingly sacrificed everything for her. Yet, on this fateful day, the woman he would have died for had plunged a knife into his back.</p>\n<p>The question would linger unanswered for a long time. Perhaps he would never find peace in death. His dimming eyes finally closed, leaving two tears resting at the corners.</p>\n<p>“Pa-ta…” Xia Ruoyin’s own tears fell, mingling with his, washing away the remnants of his sorrow.</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------</p>\n<p>The Fallen Prince</p>\n<p>\"Gua….\" The piercing cry of a crow jolted Mo Wuji awake. As he lifted his head, he saw a solitary crow soaring above, quickly vanishing into the distance.</p>\n<p>“Where am I?” Mo Wuji felt disoriented. He appeared to be sitting atop a freshly piled grave, surrounded by seven or eight children kneeling before him. Among them, a young girl in a floral blue dress held a bamboo basket.</p>\n<p>As he struggled to comprehend the situation, the young girl spoke softly, “Everyone behaved well today, but there are no more sweets left, so let’s call it a day and return tomorrow to play again.”</p>\n<p>“Were these games played in the previous emperor’s dynasty? Why does this scene feel so familiar?”</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji was struck with shock; this scene mirrored the final moments of the novel featuring Mu Rongfu. Driven mad by his duties to his country, Mu Rongfu had lost his beautiful cousin and childhood sweetheart, Wang Yuyan, to another man. In the end, all he had left was a servant named Abi. This present scene echoed the moment after Mu Rongfu’s descent into madness, where Abi gathered children to play with him.</p>\n<p>\"Long live my King, goodbye my King. We will return for more sweets tomorrow…\" The children chanted as they dispersed in disarray.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji scanned his surroundings and noticed several young men and women passing by. His gaze fell on a lady in a purple skirt, and he was captivated by her beauty, momentarily forgetting his predicament.</p>\n<p>The lady in the purple skirt met his gaze, her expression a mix of confusion, sympathy, and disappointment. The other young men and women laughed and whispered among themselves as they walked past him.</p>\n<p>“Could it be…?”</p>\n<p>Suddenly, a horrifying thought struck him. “Am I reborn into Mu Rongfu’s body after my death? Did our souls truly cross over in this world?”</p>\n<p>“And why would my soul crossover? What was I doing before this?”</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji’s head throbbed as he tried to piece together the situation. He recalled that after successfully developing the solution, his beloved had betrayed him. Overwhelmed with sorrow, he struggled to think clearly.</p>\n<p>The flood of information overwhelmed him, and it took two full hours for him to grasp the reality of his situation.</p>\n<p>He realized this was no longer the Song dynasty, nor was he merely reborn into Mu Rongfu’s body.</p>\n<p>This wasn’t even Earth! He was in Rao Zhou City, the capital of Cheng Yu state, and he was Mo Xinghe, the prince of Northern Qin Prefecture. His father had named him Mo Xinghe after the Xing Han Empire.</p>\n<p>Mo Xinghe couldn’t recall the full extent of this world, but he knew the Xing Han Empire was not the only empire. Each empire was divided into states, and each state further divided into prefectures.</p>\n<p>Mo Xinghe belonged to Northern Qin Prefecture under Cheng Yu State, which was part of the Xing Han Empire.</p>\n<p>Nineteen years ago, Mo Xinghe’s grandfather, Mo Tiancheng, was the lord of Northern Qin Prefecture. After arriving in Cheng Yu state, he mysteriously disappeared. Consequently, Northern Qin Prefecture required a new lord, one who needed the approval of the State Lord.</p>\n<p>Had Mo Tiancheng not vanished, he could have passed the throne directly to his children. However, with his disappearance, the successor had to personally seek the throne before all the other lords.</p>\n<p>Mo Xinghe’s parents brought him to Rao Zhou City for two reasons: to locate Mo Tiancheng and for Mo Guangyuan to gain recognition from the other lords to succeed his father’s throne.</p>\n<p>Initially, the process of succeeding the throne seemed straightforward. No one anticipated the numerous obstacles that would arise. Mo Xinghe's parents spent vast sums of money and ran around for over a decade, yet they still failed to secure the throne.</p>\n<p>After their deaths from illness, Mo Xinghe inherited his father’s obsession with the throne. With his parents gone, the Mo family had exhausted their resources. Mo Xinghe wandered for years, achieving nothing. When he learned that Northern Qin Prefecture had fallen under Cheng Yu’s lord, he lost his sanity and was reborn as Mo Wuji.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji also recalled the identity of the lady in the purple skirt. Her name was Wen Manzhu, the daughter of a close friend of Mo Xinghe’s parents. Mo Xinghe and Wen Manzhu were childhood sweethearts, and while they were not formally promised to each other, everyone believed they would grow up together.</p>\n<p>As the Mo Clan lost their chance at the throne, and with the death of Mo Xinghe’s parents, the Wen Clan gradually distanced themselves from him. As Wen Manzhu matured, she gravitated toward princes from more influential families.</p>\n<p>Feeling two drops of tears on the back of his hand, Mo Wuji looked up to see a sorrowful young girl with a scar on her face.</p>\n<p>Like Abi, who remained loyal to Mu Rongfu, this girl named Yan’Er was the only one who stayed by him, despite being merely a servant. Without Yan’Er, Mo Wuji might never have been reborn, and no one would have known how long the original Mo Xinghe would have remained dead.</p>\n<p>Aside from the scar on her face, Yan’Er appeared malnourished. She was pale, her hair a dull blonde, lacking the vitality typical of a young lady.</p>\n<p>“It still doesn’t make sense…” Mo Wuji shivered. The Mo Clan was still part of the royal family, so even if Mo Xinghe’s father failed to claim the throne, he shouldn’t have died in poverty in this wealthy nation. Was it not possible for him to leave Rao Zhou City and return to Northern Qin Prefecture? Or was it that the Mo Clan received no support or funds?</p>\n<p>Something was definitely amiss…</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji looked up to see Yan’Er wiping her reddened eyes, gently asking, “My King, can we return now?”</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji bowed his head and sighed, feeling a mix of emotions for both Yan’Er and his current state. Even while engaged in such childish games, Yan’Er still sought his permission as if they were truly in an empire.</p>\n<p>However, he quickly realized he should be most upset with himself. He felt conflicted—grateful for his life, heartbroken over his lover’s betrayal, and saddened by the loss of his former life on Earth.</p>\n<p>Seeing Mo Wuji silent for a while, the overly cautious Yan’Er spoke again, “My King, the sky is getting darker…”</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji sighed as he gazed at the setting sun. He wasn’t sure if he was lamenting for Mo Xinghe or his own fate. Finally, he said, \"Let’s go back…”</p>\n<p>Yan’Er’s surprised expression reflected her confusion, but without needing to explain further, he added, “Let’s return to the dynasty…”</p>\n<p>With that, he attempted to stand, brushing off the dirt from his legs. However, his legs had fallen asleep from sitting too long. Fortunately, Yan’Er was there to assist him.</p>\n<p>As Yan’Er helped him through the sparse forest, Mo Wuji busied himself with the swirling thoughts in his mind.</p>\n<p>\"What kind of world is this...?” he murmured to himself as they walked in silence for a few minutes.</p>\n<p>“My King, what did you just say?” Yan’Er asked, not quite understanding his words.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji shook his head. “Yan’Er, please don’t call me your King anymore. Just address me by my name.”</p>\n<p>Since both Mo Wuji and Yan’Er would continue to live together, there was still much to explain.</p>\n<p>Feeling a bit touched, Yan’Er asked excitedly, her trembling hands still clutching the bamboo basket, “Young master, are you feeling better?”</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji replied with a hesitant smile, “Perhaps I haven’t fully recovered or remembered everything, but I won’t act like an idiot anymore.”</p>\n<p>Fearing he might inadvertently reveal too much, he simply stated that he hadn’t completely recovered.</p>\n<p>\"Then…” Yan’Er seemed to want to say something but hesitated.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji understood she wanted to ask if he still wished to play with the children tomorrow, but she feared it might remind him of the previous dynasty’s events and drive him mad again.</p>\n<p>Patting Yan’Er’s back, Mo Wuji chuckled, “I’ve lived the Emperor’s life before, and I’m already tired of it. Let’s skip tomorrow and instead focus on how to survive moving forward.”</p>\n<p>Yan’Er dropped the bamboo basket, tears streaming down her cheeks as she knelt on the ground, mumbling to herself…</p>",
