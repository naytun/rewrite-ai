I’ve succeeded…” In a chaotic lab, Mo Wuji laughed maniacally, clutching a porcelain bottle as if he had lost his mind.</p>\n<p>“Ding…” A glass cup shattered on the floor, tea spilling everywhere. A stunning girl in a crimson cheongsam stood at the doorway, her eyes wide as she stared at the ecstatic Mo Wuji. After a moment of silence, she spoke with a trembling voice, “Wuji, did you really succeed?”</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji turned to the beautiful girl at the entrance, realizing that Xia Ruoyin had come to serve him tea. The news had shocked her deeply; her excitement caused the cup to slip from her hands.</p>\n<p>“Ruoyin, there’s no mistake this time. I only tried half of the bottle, but I could feel a fire igniting within my meridians, gradually opening and expanding them. They’re still in the process of opening, but we’ve succeeded!”</p>\n<p>With the porcelain bottle in hand, Mo Wuji excitedly approached the girl and grasped her hands. “Ruoyin, you’ve worked so hard. All these years, I’ve been consumed by my research on the Channel Opening Solution, neglecting you. Let’s marry! Afterward, we can start a company to produce the Channel Opening Solution. I believe our venture will soon become a global sensation.”</p>\n<p>The girl finally steadied herself, though her voice still quivered. “Did you record the drug formula?”</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji nodded. “Don’t worry, Ruoyin. I have all the information saved on my laptop. Here, take a look…”</p>\n<p>As he turned to walk toward his laptop, a sudden chill coursed through him, followed by excruciating pain in his back. He glanced down to see the tip of a blade protruding from his chest, realizing he had been stabbed through the heart.</p>\n<p>The pain made him dizzy, and his strength began to wane. Slowly, he turned his head, his gaze falling on the hands gripping the blade—Xia Ruoyin’s hands. With wide eyes, he whispered, “Ruoyin… Why? Why?”</p>\n<p>He couldn’t fathom that the woman he had loved so dearly for years had betrayed him.</p>\n<p>“I’m sorry, Wuji. I’m so sorry…” Xia Ruoyin’s hands trembled, her body shaking as she realized she had killed her lover, the man who had loved her for over a decade.</p>\n<p>Two tears formed at the corners of Mo Wuji’s eyes. He felt his body growing colder, consciousness slipping away, yet he refused to close his eyes. He continued to gaze at Xia Ruoyin, murmuring, “If you wanted the formula… you only had to ask. I would have given it to you… why?”</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji didn’t cry because he was dying; he had never shed tears in his life. Yet today, the deepest pain came not from the wound in his back but from the betrayal of his beloved.</p>\n<p>Perhaps even Xia Ruoyin didn’t understand her place in Mo Wuji’s heart. Had she asked for the formula, he would have willingly sacrificed everything for her. Yet, on this fateful day, the woman he would have died for had plunged a knife into him.</p>\n<p>The question may linger unanswered for ages. Perhaps he would never find peace in death. His dimming eyes finally closed, leaving two tears resting at their corners.</p>\n<p>“Pa-ta…” Xia Ruoyin shed her own tears, which fell onto Mo Wuji’s cheeks, washing away his sorrow.</p>\n<p>-----------------------------------</p>\n<p>The Fallen Prince</p>\n<p>\"Gua….\" The shrill cry of a crow jolted Mo Wuji awake. As he lifted his head, he saw a lone crow soaring above him, quickly vanishing with its piercing calls.</p>\n<p>“Where am I?” Mo Wuji felt disoriented. He appeared to be sitting atop a freshly piled grave, surrounded by seven or eight children kneeling before him. Among them, a young girl in a floral blue skirt held a bamboo basket at his side.</p>\n<p>As he struggled to comprehend the situation, the young girl spoke softly, “Everyone behaved well today, but there are no more sweets left. Let’s call it a day and return tomorrow to continue playing.”</p>\n<p>“Were these games played in the previous emperor’s dynasty? Why does this scene feel so familiar?”</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji was taken aback; this scene mirrored the final moments of the novel featuring Mu Rongfu. Driven mad by his duties to his country, Mu Rongfu had lost his beautiful cousin and childhood sweetheart, Wang Yuyan, to another man. In the end, all he had left was a servant named Abi. This present scene echoed the aftermath of Mu Rongfu’s madness, with Abi gathering children to play with him.</p>\n<p>\"Long live my King, goodbye my King. We will return for more sweets tomorrow…\" The children scattered, chanting in disarray.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji scanned his surroundings and noticed several young men and women passing by. When his gaze landed on a lady in a purple skirt, he was captivated by her beauty, momentarily forgetting his predicament.</p>\n<p>The lady in the purple skirt exchanged glances with Mo Wuji, her expression a mix of confusion, sympathy, and disappointment. The other attractive youths seemed to laugh and discuss him as they walked by.</p>\n<p>“Can’t be…”</p>\n<p>Suddenly, a horrifying thought struck him. “Could it be that after my death, I was reborn into Mu Rongfu’s body? Did our souls truly cross over in this world?”</p>\n<p>“And why would my soul crossover? What was I doing before this?”</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji’s head throbbed as he tried to piece together the situation. He recalled that after successfully developing the solution, his beloved had betrayed him. Overwhelmed by sorrow, he struggled to think clearly.</p>\n<p>After two long hours of contemplation, he finally grasped the reality of his situation.</p>\n<p>This was no longer the Song dynasty, nor was he merely reborn into Mu Rongfu’s body.</p>\n<p>This wasn’t even Earth! He was in Rao Zhou City, the capital of Cheng Yu state, and he was Mo Xinghe, the prince of Northern Qin Prefecture. His father had named him Mo Xinghe after the Xing Han Empire.</p>\n<p>Mo Xinghe couldn’t recall the full extent of this world, but he knew that the Xing Han Empire was not the only empire. Each empire was divided into states, and each state further divided into numerous prefectures.</p>\n<p>Mo Xinghe belonged to Northern Qin Prefecture under Cheng Yu State, which was part of the Xing Han Empire.</p>\n<p>Nineteen years ago, Mo Xinghe’s grandfather, Mo Tiancheng, was the lord of Northern Qin Prefecture. Upon arriving in Cheng Yu state, he mysteriously disappeared. Consequently, Northern Qin Prefecture required a new lord, one who needed the approval of the State Lord.</p>\n<p>Had Mo Tiancheng not vanished, he could have directly passed the throne to his heirs and reported it to the State Lord. However, with his disappearance, the successor had to personally travel to the state to claim the throne in front of all the other prefecture and state lords.</p>\n<p>Mo Xinghe’s parents had brought him to Rao Zhou City for two reasons: to locate Mo Tiancheng and for Mo Guangyuan, his father, to gain recognition from the other lords and succeed his father’s throne.</p>\n<p>Initially, ascending the throne seemed straightforward. No one anticipated the myriad obstacles that would arise. Mo Xinghe's parents had spent vast sums of money and devoted over a decade to this pursuit, yet they still failed to succeed.</p>\n<p>After their deaths from illness, Mo Xinghe inherited his father’s obsession with the throne. With the demise of his parents, the Mo family had exhausted their wealth. Mo Xinghe wandered for years, achieving nothing meaningful. When he learned that Northern Qin Prefecture had fallen under Cheng Yu’s lord, he lost his sanity and was reborn as Mo Wuji.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji also recalled the identity of the lady in the purple skirt. Her name was Wen Manzhu, the daughter of a close friend of Mo Xinghe’s parents. Mo Xinghe and Wen Manzhu were childhood sweethearts, and while they were not formally promised to each other, everyone believed they would eventually be together.</p>\n<p>As the Mo Clan lost its chance to ascend the throne, and with the death of Mo Xinghe’s parents and his subsequent madness, the Wen Clan gradually distanced themselves from him. As Wen Manzhu matured, she gravitated toward princes from more influential families.</p>\n<p>Feeling two drops of tears on the back of his hand, Mo Wuji looked up to see a sorrowful young girl with a scar on her face.</p>\n<p>Like Abi’s unwavering loyalty to Mu Rongfu, this girl, Yan’Er, remained by his side as his servant. Without her, Mo Wuji might never have been reborn, and no one would have known how long the original Mo Xinghe would have languished in death.</p>\n<p>Aside from the scar on her face, Yan’Er appeared malnourished. She was pale, her hair disheveled, lacking the vitality typical of a young lady.</p>\n<p>“It still doesn’t make sense…” Mo Wuji shivered. The Mo Clan was still part of the royal family, so even if Mo Xinghe’s father couldn’t claim the throne, he shouldn’t have died in poverty in such a wealthy nation. Was it not possible for him to leave Rao Zhou City and return to Northern Qin Prefecture? Or was it that the Mo Clan had received no support or funds?</p>\n<p>Something was amiss…</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji looked up to see Yan’Er wiping her reddened eyes, gently asking, “My King, can we go back now?”</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji bowed his head and sighed, feeling a mix of emotions for Yan’Er, his current state, and his body. Even while engaging in such childish games, Yan’Er still had to be polite, seeking permission as if they were truly in an empire.</p>\n<p>However, Mo Wuji quickly regained his composure, realizing he should be most upset with himself. He felt a whirlwind of emotions—grateful to be alive, heartbroken over his lover’s betrayal, and saddened by the loss of his former life on Earth.</p>\n<p>Seeing Mo Wuji remain silent, the overly cautious Yan’Er spoke again, “My King, the sky is getting darker…”</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji sighed, gazing at the distant setting sun. He was unsure whether he mourned for Mo Xinghe or lamented his own fate. Finally, he said, \"Let’s go back…”</p>\n<p>Yan’Er’s surprised expression reflected her confusion. Without further explanation, he sighed, “Let’s return to the dynasty…”</p>\n<p>With that, he attempted to stand, brushing off the dirt from his legs. However, after sitting for so long, they felt numb. Fortunately, Yan’Er was there to assist him.</p>\n<p>As Yan’Er helped him through the sparse forest, Mo Wuji busied himself with the jumble of thoughts swirling in his mind.</p>\n<p>\"What kind of world is this...?” The two walked in silence for a few minutes before Mo Wuji muttered to himself.</p>\n<p>“My King, what did you just say?” Yan’Er asked, puzzled by his words.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji shook his head. “Yan’Er, please don’t call me your King anymore. Just address me by my name.”</p>\n<p>Since both Mo Wuji and Yan’Er would continue living together, he felt it necessary to clarify.</p>\n<p>Touched, Yan’Er asked excitedly, her trembling hands still clutching the bamboo basket, “Young master, are you feeling better?”</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji replied with a hesitant smile, “Perhaps I haven’t fully recovered or remembered everything, but I won’t act like a fool anymore.”</p>\n<p>Fearing he might inadvertently reveal too much, he simply stated that he hadn’t completely regained his memory.</p>\n<p>\"Then…” Yan’Er seemed to want to say something but hesitated.</p>\n<p>Mo Wuji understood she wanted to ask if he still wished to play with the children tomorrow, but she feared it might remind him of the previous dynasty’s events and drive him mad again.</p>\n<p>Patting Yan’Er’s back, Mo Wuji chuckled, “I’ve lived the Emperor’s life before, and I’m already tired of it. Let’s skip tomorrow and instead focus on how to survive moving forward.”</p>\n<p>Yan’Er dropped the bamboo basket, tears streaming down her cheeks as she knelt on the ground, mumbling to herself…</p>",
