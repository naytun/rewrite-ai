The sky was ablaze, and no signs of darkness could be seen.</p><p>Lou Cheng walked pleasantly in the twilight, slowly leaving the darkness of his room, brewing the fighting plan.</p><p>Only one more step and his mission would be complete!</p><p>Then he could tell his teacher the good news!</p><p>When he entered the arena, he went to the exclusive lounge. He saw the staff member, Fang Siqi, who served the seeded fighters, waiting expectantly.</p><p>“Hello.” The white-collared beauty bent in the standard style.</p><p>“Hello.” Lou Cheng nodded feeling slightly strange.</p><p>Today, Fang Siqi was barely familiar. She usually tried to make him feel at home by chatting politely, but now, she was obviously in an estranged mood.</p><p>Lou Cheng shook his head silently and without giving it another thought, walked toward his room.</p><p>Suddenly, he perceived that Fang was secretly watching him.</p><p>“What?” Lou Cheng calmly asked, he did not cover up his doubts.</p><p>“Nothing.” Then Fang Siqi asked curiously, “Mr. Lou Cheng, did you not see the news?”</p><p>“What news?” Lou Cheng asked in surprise.</p><p>Was there any special news?</p><p>After the game last night, he’d browsed the forum and news, enjoyed the praise in the report and excitement of the fans, but hadn’t found anything strange!</p><p>As for today, first he’d slept with the little fairy, then he’d studied the fighting videos of the remaining seven opponents, and finally he’d exchanged intimately with Yan Zheke, indeed he’d had no time to pay attention to the news.</p><p>The news related to the Martial Arts Competition included the news from all aspects only at the end of the game, praising the winners or criticizing the losers. After a few hours there were deeper reports with more technical contents. This was Lou Cheng’s favorite part. It could help him summarize the game, and it helped him to find his own problems.</p><p>The next day, the vast majority of the news was just frying leftover rice, and Lou Cheng would only watch it if he had free time.</p><p>“You really don’t know?” Fang Siqi was stunned, looking into Lou Cheng’s eyes, dark, deep, and peaceful, “Anyway, it’s not a big deal. I have to deal with other things.”</p><p>She stepped on high heels and left. Lou Cheng was confused.</p><p>What news? Lou Cheng went into his lounge with this question, took out his phone, logged in and searched.</p><p>What he saw scared him. A gang of people were quarreling on his fan forum, which annoyed Eternal Nightfall and Brahman a lot.</p><p>This was just the aftermath of a hot topic, how could the main battlefield be in a small private forum?</p><p>Seeing these messages, Lou Cheng understood what had happened. The lip-reading expert had interpreted what Qiu Lin said, and then tipped-off the reporters, leading to great distrust of the Youth Tournament Committee.</p><p>As one of the protagonists, he was no doubt mentioned. While some people sympathized with him, took pity on him, cheered for him, and unswervingly supported him, others suspected that this was his own fault, for the purpose of avoiding a strong enemy through deliberate speculation, dressing up as the weak, and smearing the Committee as well as the Gao Fen martial arts. It was extremely vicious.</p><p>This was really lying in the gun. No wonder Fang Siqi had looked at him like that. Lou Cheng suddenly understood, neither laughing nor crying.</p><p>Fang Siqi was a staff member of the Martial Artist Association and the Youth Tournament Committee!</p><p>He’d seen the post of the lip-reading expert “Bull Demon King” last night, but hadn’t cared. He’d thought it was just a little controversy in their own forum, and would not spread.</p><p>His mood had not been much affected, because the focus of the quarrel was no doubt on the Youth Tournament Committee. The attention on himself was not as bad as the journalists being sprayed for lack of professional ethics.</p><p>“Do not worry about it, it’s in God’s hands.” Lou Cheng closed his eyes, adjusting his mind.</p><p>Anyway, he hadn’t expected to have to avoid Zhang Zhutong and Han Zhifei, rather he was prepared to fight against them!</p><p>…</p><p>At 7.20p.m. Fang Siqi sounded the door of Lou Cheng’s lounge room, and informed him that he could be admitted and sit in the first position on the left side of the second row of guest’s area.</p><p>Lou Cheng patted the martial arts suit, proudly stood up, and went to the exit, where he met Zhang Zhutong, Han Zhifei and Liu Xunzhen. These fighters kept away from him quietly and seemed to want to avoid arousing suspicion.</p><p>They were the mainstays of Gao Fen martial arts.</p><p>“Do you think he did it? To ensure the first four?” Zhang Zhutong asked leisurely with his hands in his pockets. No one knew whether he was asking Han Zhifei on the left, or Liu Xunzhen on the right.</p><p>He did not bother to lower his voice, it seemed he was not afraid to be heard by Lou Cheng, or maybe, he deliberately let him hear.</p><p>“Perhaps, the ultimate beneficiaries are the most suspicious.” Liu Xunzhen said concisely.</p><p>Zhang Zhutong laughed. “He may be scared by Qiu Lin’s words, and not want to encounter me in the quarter-finals, so he found people to make a big deal, to make use of his physical metamorphosis advantage.”</p><p>Witnessing Lou Cheng defeating Qiu Lin, he’d considered him as the main opponent, inferior only to Han Zhifei.</p><p>So, now the confrontation of the souls would start!</p><p>You tell the story better than Anderson… Lou Cheng mocked, but didn’t reply.</p><p><em>Taking this kind of thing seriously could cause failure. It was easy to let it affect the state of the game.</em></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Lou Cheng visualized in his mind a scene of freezing water to ice.</p><p>Han Zhifei said in low voice,</p><p>“It might not be him. He might not be the only beneficiary.”</p><p>“Who else?” Liu Xunzhen frowned.</p><p>“The Committee, and television stations.” Han Zhifei looked around, “Don’t you think the attention paid to the game has increased a lot with this tip-off, and such a quarrel?”</p><p>Those who did not watch the Youth Tournament, but had glanced at the news, and even some friends in other provinces, were now attracted to see the broadcast.</p><p>In this impetuous era, being noted was a good thing, whether it was praise or blame.</p><p>Liu Xunzhen sulked, and didn’t say anything more. He had been persuaded by Han Zhifei to some extent.</p><p>This type of hype was common to the entertainment circle, the quarrel was played round after round before the broadcast of some films and television dramas.</p><p>For the committee, as long as the final performance was justified, was such a quarrel to increase the number of critics, not a good thing? For television stations, the audience ratings improved, the cover crowd increased, and their faces were not hurt, wasn’t it great?</p><p>Zhang Zhutong nodded thoughtfully and said with a smile,</p><p>“It seems that I have misunderstood.”</p><p>He said this easily, as if the previous accusations never happened.</p><p>…</p><p>Yan Zheke came to the arena once the guests had been seated.</p><p>She followed the tips, found her position, and found Gu Shuang and Xing Jingjing.</p><p>“Is something wrong?” Yan Zheke asked carefully.</p><p>Gu Shuang smiled and said, “There will be no problem, it has nothing to do with us.”</p><p>After speaking, for insurance purposes, she sent the following words with messenger: If the Organizing Committee wants to check, it should just check the television station, who deserves it for speculating.</p><p>In Yan Zheke’s proposal, she reminded the TV station and other people through a mediary, she’d finally found a public relations company that had a good relationship with the television station to coordinate it.</p><p>“Alright, I feel relieved.” Yan Zheke gave a gentle smile.</p><p>This must not affect Lou Cheng’s image!</p><p>While they whispered, many eyes were attracted to the beautiful Yan Zheke, including Cao Lele and Qiu Hailin in the back row.</p><p>“Look, look, isn’t that Yan Zheke of Class three?” Cao Lele pulled at the sleeves of his teacher.</p><p>Qiu Hailin looked over, and saw Yan Zheke wearing a chiffon shirt with a half up hairstyle, in the noisy environment she possessed a kind of quietly blooming beauty. As a girl herself she could see a slight absence, “It is. She has also come to watch the game.”</p><p>“Yan Zheke?” Hearing their words, Jiang Fei and Cheng Qili, who knew the secret love story turned around in surprise, to view the radiant girl.</p><p>This was the second time they’d seen Yan Zheke, and after more than a year, they felt she was more beautiful than a goddess. She was more self-confident and graceful than she’d been in high school from what they could remember. They could see she really was charming.</p><p>Being looked at by others this way, Yan Zheke, with a small achievement in meditation, certainly had the subtle induction. She glanced over subconsciously, and saw a few strange, but slightly familiar men and women.</p><p>Jiang Fei… She first recognized Jiang Fei, because Lou Cheng had shown her their group photo on his phone.</p><p>She suddenly understood that this was Lou Cheng’s group of friends and relatives. The one wearing black half-rim glasses with acne should be Old Cheng-Cheng Qili. The guy with a wine-colored face was most likely Tao Xiaofei. The one with the large bald forehead was the class 4 leader Qiu Hailin. The pretty little girl was Cao Lele, Lou Cheng’s old desk-mate. The man wearing gold-rimmed glasses, was that Lou Cheng’s father? Was the woman next to him Lou Cheng’s mother?</p><p>She did not know why, but Yan Zheke suddenly felt inexplicably shy. Her face flushed as she said hello to Jiang Fei and the others shyly.</p><p>Jiang Fei knew about the relationship between her and Lou Chang, she could not be without courtesy…</p><p>In front of her were his mother and father, she could not be without courtesy…</p><p>After greeting them, she immediately turned to sit down, clutching her hot face, and complained to Gu Shuang,</p><p>“Why did you pick this spot?”</p><p>“What’s the matter with it?” Gu Shuang looked up foolishly.</p><p>“Lou Cheng’s father and mother are sitting behind us… ” Yan Zheke said quietly.</p><p>Gu Shuang was surprised at first, then she laughed.</p><p>“Coincidental, completely coincidental! The ugly daughter-in-law will have to see her mother in-law… ”</p><p>“Pooh!” Yan Zheke was shy.</p><p>…</p><p>“Yan Zheke knows us? To give us a greeting?” Tao Xiaofei was stunned, Cao Lele was also confused.</p><p>“Maybe, maybe she knew me,” said Qiu Hailin, not confidently.</p><p>As the leader of Class four, she had contacted Yan Zheke several times.</p><p>Jiang Fei tightly closed his mouth, for fear that he would accidentally expose his secret, the pitiful sight of the iron chain was vivid!</p><p>“Lele, that girl is your classmate? Beautiful! More beautiful than the internet star!” Qi Yunfei and Chen Xiaoxiao also noted the waving of Yan Zheke.</p><p>Qi Fang followed by laughing, “The girl is very good-looking.”</p><p><em>It is your new daughter-in-law,</em> Jiang Fei secretly mocked.</p><p>…</p><p>Sitting in his position, Lou Cheng did not care about the eyes of others. He was smiling and watching Yan Zheke telling him that his Mom and Dad were behind her.</p><p>“Should this count as meeting the parents?” His mouth upturned, pressing the keyboard.</p><p>At this point, the guests took the first player.</p><p>“No. 18, Lou Cheng.”</p><p>Uh… Lou Cheng looked up toward the arena.</p><p>Yan Xiaoling and the others also focused on the lots, swearing that the results were not right, they would begin to black the committee!</p><p>Guests had drawn out the opponent of Lou Cheng.</p><p>“No. 6, Meng Jiefeng.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
