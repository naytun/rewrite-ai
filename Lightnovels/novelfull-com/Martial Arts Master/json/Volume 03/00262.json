Is she more powerful than the ninth seed?” Qi Fang, Lou Cheng’s mum asked, nervous after hearing the drawing result.</p><p>She vaguely remembered that Jiang Fei had once mentioned it, but she was too worried to check if it was true.</p><p>“Yes.” Jiang Fei’s voice was soft. He himself felt a little hesitant.</p><p>Though they did not pin high hopes on Lou Cheng to win the first or even the second prize, they sincerely hope that their old classmate would fulfill his wish. After all, Lou Cheng himself said he was aiming for a spot in the top 4. Who knew he would meet the powerful fifth seed right at the beginning of the top 16 competition, putting his friends on the edge.</p><p>His misfortune was not at an ordinary level!</p><p>“I thought the top 8 competition would be the true beginning of his test… ” Qiu Hailin sighed. Qi Yunfei and the other girls unconsciously clenched their fists.</p><p>…</p><p>In Lou Cheng’s fan forum, Eternal Nightfall or otherwise known as Yan Xiaoling tagged users Unparalleled Dragon King and Okamoto’s Fan at once. “Hurry and tell me how powerful this Qiu Lin is. I’ve seen her personal data, but I’m still confused!”</p><p>She was always frank and had never pretended to be a know-it-all for appearances’ sake.</p><p>Unparalleled Dragon King sent her a funny emoji. “She’s a strong one. I feel like she can go against Lou Cheng. They share some common characteristics.”</p><p>“Can you say everything you want in a single sentence?” Yan Xiaoling replied with an angry emoji.</p><p>“With your low IQ, I’m worried you couldn’t understand them all at once.” Per his habit, Unparalleled Dragon King just had to make fun of the moderator as usual.</p><p>What she found most admirable was the little girl would never get angry no matter how they made fun of her. She would even play along with them and be self-deprecating, giving the forum a happy atmosphere. However, she would sometimes get annoyed and delete a lot of her close friends without reason. She often had mood swings.</p><p>“Oh, that’s right… Then you think of them slowly.” Sure enough, Yan Xiaoling did not get mad, as she just replied with a cute emoji.</p><p>Unparalleled Dragon King sent an emoji of red faced Nike smile. “Lou Cheng can do six successive bursts, she’s almost there… ”</p><p>“Why, why, why? Her supernatural ability is not stamina-based!” Brahman appeared, asking in confusion.</p><p>Unparalleled Dragon King’s response was quick. “It’s a long story. Let me drink some sh*t first… Qiu Lin came from a martial arts aristocratic family. Her supernatural ability is metalizing parts of her body. But instead of training herself to be a warrior specialized in supernatural ability, she devotes all her energy into practicing kung fu. When she was 18, she became certified as a Professional Ninth Pin with her ancestral Vajra Body Palm and Lotus Step, making her a rising star in the Xing province martial arts circle.</p><p>“But she wasn’t content and felt there were still defects in her ancestral kung fu. Thus she went to Daxing Temple with her ancestor’s relics. As you know, Daxing Temple only accepts monks. How could they accept her? However, the girl spent a whole year going to the pavilion halfway up the mountain to beg them. She greatly moved the temple’s abbot, Fayuan, and he gave her seven days to read three books of physical invulnerability known as Lotus Print, Vajra Body (both were of Vajra Realm) and six-syllabled Sanskrit mantra (of Womb Realm).”</p><p>“And then? What happened?” Yan Xiaoling urged him to continue as if she was listening to a story.</p><p>This elder sister’s experience was quite interesting!</p><p>“Then? Then Qiu Lin got further enlightenment through the body movements of Lotus Print and made progress in learning Lotus Step. What’s more, she gained basic knowledge of Hong Sound, which was one of the six-syllabled Sanskrit mantras. Once she made the Hong sound, she was able to realize her potential, restore energy, activate her Qi and blood, and temporarily enhance her strength. All these helped her to make five successive bursts earlier this year.”</p><p>“Sounded so powerful… ” Brahman praised heartily. “But she can’t match my idol since five successive bursts are her limit! What’s more, my idol hasn’t shown his limit yet.”</p><p>“You’re good at math!” Okamoto’s Fan cut into their conversation.</p><p>Unparalleled Dragon King smiled through tears. “Please pay attention to the key point! Hong Sound means draining the pond to catch the fish. That means it can be used only once a day, or she won’t be able to fight in the following matches. Even using it once would exhaust her, limiting her next performance.”</p><p>“Wait, how do you pronounce ‘Hong’? Sounds like a cow. Don’t you think it’s embarrassing to imitate a cow’s sound in a fight?” Yan Xiaoling asked after a short silence.</p><p>“It’s ‘Hong’! It’s different from ‘moo’!” Okamoto’s Fan helplessly replied.</p><p>…</p><p>“Cheng?” Hearing Wang Lili’s rising voice, Lou Debang, Lou Zhiqiang, and the others all turned their gaze to the television, not understanding what it had to do with Lou Cheng.</p><p>The screen had returned to the match on the arena, leaving no traces of Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Mom, did you also see that?” Lou Yuanwei was cheering as if he found an ally.</p><p>He did not see wrongly earlier!</p><p>“Yes. Why is Cheng appearing on TV? He’s even sitting in the front rows!” Though Wang Lili knew nothing about the tournament, she knew those sitting in the front rows were either rich or influential people.</p><p>“What are you talking about?” Lou Debang asked in the manner of the head of a family.</p><p>“What are you talking about?” Lou Debang asked in the manner of the head of a family.</p><p>There was no Cheng on the television!</p><p>Lou Yuanwei took a breath. “Grandpa, wait a minute. You’ll definitely see him later!”</p><p>It seemed that the world had changed a lot before he could notice it!</p><p>“So what if he’s there? Is he any better than us if he’s on TV?” Lou Zhiqiang replied out of the blue.</p><p>He seldom said anything good about others. If an ordinary guest was invited for dinner and presented with some dishes that were distasteful to him, he would not mention anything as not to sour the atmosphere. But Lou Zhiqiang was different. He would directly express his dissatisfaction and even criticize it.</p><p>When someone sent him a gift, he would even find fault with it in front of the sender’s face.</p><p>…</p><p>Upon learning who his opponent was, Lou Cheng stopped paying attention to the drawing and matches of other fighters. He lowered his head to discuss about Qiu Lin with Yan Zheke.</p><p>“… In several of her previous matches, her opponents weren’t strong enough and she didn’t seem to use her full strength.” Finally Yan Zheke reminded him, “Gu Shuang said last month Qiu Lin had mentioned several times in private parties that she aimed to be in the top 3 of this tournament. She wouldn’t say that if she didn’t have the confidence!”</p><p>In his mind, Lou Cheng whined that he also said his goal was the top 4… He sent her a pitiful face and took advantage of the moment to ask for comfort. “My opponent this time is so strong! Coach Yan, I need more cheering!”</p><p>Like shouting out the complete word “sweetie”!</p><p>“Well, just wait.” Yan Zheke rolled her eyes in embarrassment, scolding him in her heart that he was increasingly shameless in taking advantage of her.</p><p>Er, why was she agreeing without hesitation? That made him nervous. Looking at the surprising text, he found it rather unsettling.</p><p>Ke would not play a trick on him since his opponent was a tough master, would she?</p><p>Not daring to probe further in case Yan Zheke explode in anger and go back on her words, Lou Cheng swallowed his confusion and turned his attention back on his opponent.</p><p>…</p><p>In the first round, first seed Zhang Zhutong had a fierce battle with fourth seed Zuo Zhen. Their fight lasted for six minutes. It was Zhang Zhutong who finally won after accumulating advantages and made it to the top 8 first.</p><p>In the audience, Lou Cheng saw up close the power of Zhang Zhutong’s Smelter Force.</p><p>After the interlude, the referee exchanged positions with the game supervisor to take a few minutes to recover his strength.</p><p>The game supervisor went up to the arena. Stopping at the center of it, he raised his right hand.</p><p>“Second round of the top 16 competition. Lou Cheng versus Qiu Lin!”</p><p>“It’s really Cheng!” In the Lou’s living room, Lou Yuanwei stood up while Lou Debang picked up his presbyopia glasses in disbelief.</p><p>Wang Lili and her husband exchanged looks, feeling as if they were in a dream.</p><p>Lou Cheng took a deep breath, stood up from his seat, and sent his girlfriend a text.</p><p>“Coach Yan, it’s my turn!”</p><p><em>Why hasn’t your cheering come yet?</em></p><p>Yan Zheke let out a soft humph and announced her surprise for him.</p><p>“Cheng, I’m at the airport.”</p><p>“Airport?” Lou Cheng was stunned momentarily before seeing the light. “Are you coming back?” He was overjoyed.</p><p>This was what he had been looking forward to for the past few days!</p><p>“I’ll be able to see you tomorrow.” Yan Zheke sent a shyly smiling emoji. “Are you satisfied with this kind of cheering?”</p><p>“I’m very satisfied! Very satisfied!” Lou Cheng’s face was lit up with pleasure, his motivation rising.</p><p>He must not lose this round! He must not welcome Coach Yan with failure!</p><p>Putting the phone in his pocket, Lou Cheng strode along the brilliant road under the full glare of the cameras and went up the arena with confidence. He then handed his belongings to the new game supervisor, who was the former referee.</p><p>Qiu Lin went on the arena almost at the same time. She was wearing a pale yellow martial arts suit with black stripes over it. The front of her suit was embroidered with the words “So I’ve heard”. The big screen showed the words embroidered on her back:</p><p>“From heaven to earth, I’m the mightiest!”</p><p>Despite the seemingly arrogant words, what Lou Cheng got was a sense of Buddhist zen rhyme.</p><p>Towering over Lou Cheng by half a head, Qiu Lin was handsome and valiant with extremely short hair and neutral facial features. After the referee marked the beginning of communication time, she smiled.</p><p>“You’re now the public enemy of the Gaofen martial arts circle.”</p><p>“Why do you say that?” Lou Cheng asked curiously.</p><p>He did not remember provoking anyone from that circle!</p><p>The corners of Qiu Lin’s mouth turned upwards. “You’ve only learned kung fu outside the province for a year, yet you easily defeat most of us. Doesn’t that suggest that our province’s martial arts circle is too weak?”</p><p>As a 21-year-old, she was good at all kinds of popular expressions.</p><p>“You all think too much… ” Lou Cheng found the whole thing ridiculous.</p><p>“Just as there are no champions in the literature circles, there are no one who wants to come second in martial arts. It’s normal for fighters to compare with one another,” Qiu Lin replied cheerfully. “Our consensus is that we’ll stop you from reaching the final at any costs. That’s why you’re fighting me so early in the tournament. Believe me, if you win today’s match, your opponent tomorrow will be either Han Zhifei or Zhang Zhutong.”</p><p>What? Was she kidding? Though stunned at first, Lou Cheng soon realized Qiu Lin nearly trapped him.</p><p>Was she trying to evoke his resentment and shake his peace of mind?</p><p>To make it easier for her to restrain him with the Buddhist Zen method?</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Lou Cheng visualized the scene of freezing water into ice. He froze his distracting thoughts along with the “water”, turning his mind as clear and pure as a mirror again.</p><p>No matter if she was telling the truth or who his opponent will be tomorrow, he should first do well in this match!</p><p>Lou Cheng stopped talking. He closed his eyes and began adjusting his body condition.</p><p>The referee, who was the former game supervisor, glanced at the electronic clock and once again raised his right hand.</p><p>“Begin!”</p><p>Boom! A deafening clamor burst from the arena and a thunder cloud materialized from thin air. Qiu Lin’s martial arts suit swelled with air as she closed in on Lou Cheng in just one move.</p><p>Lotus Step, Buddha Voice! Lou Cheng was stunned that Qiu Lin had advanced her ancestral body movement to the level of Buddha Voice.</p><p>It was normal for a punch or a kick to produce a clear and crisp sound of sliced air. But body movements were different. Through the changes made from quick movements, swift changes in direction, and muscle adjustments along the spinning force, only a fighter who had mastered her movements to a certain degree could make the same explosion sound. In Taoism, it was called To Tread Dubhe and Alkaid; in Buddhism, it was Buddha Voice Is with You.</p><p>“Lotus Step, Thundercloud Movement.” In the Xing province satellite TV studio, guest commentator Yu Hong gave Qiu Lin a word of praise.</p><p>There were eight garjita in Buddhism. They were vimoksa garjita (Emancipation Voice), anasrava garjita (Charity Voice), simhanda garjita (Roaring Lion Voice), maha-simhanda garjita (Great Roaring Lion Voice), prajna garjita (Wisdom Voice), maha-prajna garjita (Great Wisdom Voice), jala-dhara garjita (Thunder Cloud Voice), and maha-jala-dhara garjita (Great Thunder Cloud Voice). Among them, Great Thunder Voice was the embodiment of the intendment of delivering all living creatures from torment. It was also referred as “the voice of Buddha expounded, as great as thunder”. The Great Thunder Temple, the famous Buddhist building, derived its name from it. While Great Wisdom Voice symbolized Prajna, Great Roaring Lion Voice symbolized majesty and virtue. Only warriors of physical invulnerability were able to master them.</p><p>As for the other five voices, they varied with different forces and kung fu. Each had its own merits. Though Qiu Lin’s Thunder Cloud Voice was limited by her martial arts realm and could only improve her body movements most times, she could made great shocks with Thunder Cloud Voice to defuse the influence of Tremor Punch. It would also enhance her imposing manner, which strengthened her Buddha’s Warrior Attendant Fist!</p><p>The one step Qiu Lin took immediately narrowed the gap between them. Lou Cheng was still suffering from the Thunder Cloud Voice buzzing in his ears when he saw Qiu Lin approaching, swinging her right hook and an iron-like fist.</p><p>Whether it was due to the wind, her bulging muscle, or a combination of both, Qiu Lin’s sleeves were puffing with air along with her blowing fist!</p><p>Buddha’s Warrior Attendant Fist, Jingang Swings Gada!</p><p>The strong wind resulting from the Lotus Step was pooling on Lou Cheng’s face, even affecting his breathing patterns. At the critical moment, he took a step back. He lowered his center of gravity and made a Force Concentration. He swung his arm during the withdrawing and strengthening phase, fiercely pouncing on his opponent with the recoil.</p><p>Thunder Roar Zen, Repulse Tremor!</p><p>It was just the start of the match, but he was already using the outbreak of Dan stage without being stingy!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>When the ‘bomb’ exploded to produce shock waves, Lou Cheng’s full-frontal attack was not enough to touch Qiu Lin, who hadn’t made Force Concentration yet. She retreated with graceful, little steps, like a dancing dandelion.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s fist hit straight into the metal. It hurt so much that he wanted to swing it a couple of times. But considering the situation, he was unwilling to give up his chance. Taking a sudden breath, he again made Force Concentration in preparation for another opportunity to pounce at his opponent.</p><p>After recovering from the slight tremor, Qiu Lin began moving with lotus-like movements and graceful footwork. She made it hard for Lou Cheng to distinguish the direction she was actually going.</p><p>Bang! The thunder cloud followed her changing movements, dragging the whole arena under the dark clouds, with endless echoes of thunder.</p><p>In an instant, Lou Cheng was unable to locate Qiu Lin. His contracted Qi, blood, force, and spirit, was about to burst out, but they no longer had a target.</p><p>This time, his double bursts seemed to be in vain.</p><p>This was exactly Qiu Lin’s strategy to trick Lou Cheng into making an outbreak of Dan stage so she could approach and storm him before he could restore his energy.</p><p>She did not believe that he could still make 10 fold, 20 fold, or even more explosion.</p><p>Boom! When the thunder boomed, Qiu Lin took the opportunity to slide next to Lou Cheng.</p><p>“What… ” In the studio, guest commentator Yu Hong blurted in surprise.</p><p>He saw Lou Cheng standing still with an empty body, for there was no change on his contracted Qi, blood, and spirit.</p><p>What seemed quite normal was completely abnormal in his eyes!</p><p>For a warrior at Dan stage, Force Concentration meant setting his will as a core, collapsing and condensing all his Qi, blood, force, and spirit around it. After contracting those elements, there must be mutually exclusive activities among them, which would cause an outbreak of force without fail.</p><p>In other words, once Force Concentration was completed, there would definitely be an outbreak of force. There would not be a delay. That was unless the warrior was above the Dan stage.</p><p>That was why Qiu Lin had tricked Lou Cheng into making an outbreak of Dan stage with her Lotus Step.</p><p>However, Lou Cheng had retained his Force Concentration for more than a second!</p><p>Teacher Yu Hong frowned, wondering if this was some kind of talent or supernatural ability.</p><p>…</p><p>Since Qiu Lin changed her position too often to stay a target, Lou Cheng gave up launching another immediate attack and retained his Force Concentration. Instead, he waited for his opponent’s next move.</p><p>As for the reason why he was able to retain Force Concentration?</p><p>Was it not normal? The Jindan within his body had not collapsed at all.</p><p>He just imitated the operation rule of it to make a fake Force Concentration. It had always been capable of maintaining its balance through spinning, unless he made changes to the system.</p><p>If not for the limited endurance of his other body parts, he would have retained it forever!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Slithering to Lou Cheng’s side at an inconceivable angle, Qiu Lin’s expression turned serious after a flash of light. Without hesitation, she withdrew all her Qi and blood to make Force Concentration and turned into a fierce Vajra Body with bulging muscles.</p><p>Qiu Lin sensed Lou Cheng’s odd condition the moment she approached him, but it was too late for her to stop!</p><p>She was here at last! Lou Cheng relaxed his mind and spouted the Qi and blood in his Dantian, allowing the force to surge. He swung his left shoulder and arm to fiercely smash Qiu Lin.</p><p>Thunder Roar Zen, Single Hand Punch!</p><p>Bang! The wind flattened their hair in another explosion of sound. They both swayed momentarily before finally losing control of their feet, crushing the black tiles underneath.</p><p>Boom! Qiu Lin, who was still suffering from the shock, drove force into her footwork and flashed behind Lou Cheng like a ghost under the thunder cloud. Then she made Force Concentration and threw out her right fist, a move named Jingang Strikes Bell!</p><p>Double Explosion!</p><p>Nearly at the same time, Lou Cheng strode forward. He withdrew his Qi and force, condensing them into a ball that suddenly exploded.</p><p>Taking this opportunity to lean to his side, Lou Cheng threw his right arm at Qiu Lin who was behind him with a strong arc trajectory.</p><p>Thunder Roar Zen, Sudden Tremor!</p><p>Bang! The moment they collided, Qiu Lin’s bulging muscles shrank and condensed all her force to gather Lou Cheng’s remaining force, her own Qi, and blood in an instant and contract them into a point.</p><p>Known as Wisdom King Guards Temple in Buddha’s Warrior Attendant Fist, it was an advanced method for self-defense and borrowing strength, as still as the mountain rock!</p><p>Now she stood where she was without shaking or moving, as if Lou Cheng’s attack had not influenced her at all.</p><p>At this moment, a point in Qiu Lin’s Dantian exploded and the surging force almost instantly stretched her body. All her veins and tendons surfaced on her skin, shining like metals!</p><p>Now her body was so big she almost blocked Lou Cheng’s entire view. Taking a step forward, she began punching Lou Cheng fiercely, evoking a series of explosion sound.</p><p>Buddha’s Warrior Attendant Fist, Jingang Subdues Demons Movement!</p><p>In the face of her attacks, Lou Cheng seemed unable to block it directly as he twisted his waist and began rapidly retreating.</p><p>Zhang Zhutong, who was in the waiting room, sighed when he noticed the situation.</p><p>“What a pity. He can’t dodge Qiu Lin’s attacks forever.”</p><p>Confronting the strong with more strength was the only way to resist the combination of Jingang Subdues Demons Movementt and Lotus Step.</p><p>It seemed like it was no longer necessary for him to fear Lou Cheng’s abnormal stamina.</p><p>Since matches between high-ranked Dan stage warriors were too severe to be maintained for long, they could not be arranged in different days for broadcast needs. Thus, the semi-finals and finals were scheduled in the same evening!</p><p>…</p><p>Hum!</p><p>Qiu Lin’s tendons and bones suddenly made sounds along with her organs, her mouth spitting a solemn Zen sound.</p><p>When the Zen sound echoed within her body, Qiu Lin’s face became flushed as her Qi and blood began to flourish. As if motivated, she immediately returned to her initial form with all her weakness eliminated.</p><p>She will not give Lou Cheng any opportunities!</p><p>While she was still pulling her punches, Qiu Lin made another outbreak and narrowed the gap between her and Lou Cheng with Lotus Steps, giving him no chance to dodge or use Force Concentration.</p><p>Even the ignorant ones in the audience knew who had the upper hand due to Qiu Lin’s violent movements and ferocious attacks!</p><p>Lou Cheng came to an abrupt stop. He stormed heavily on the ground to swing his body and throw his fist at Qiu Lin without hesitation.</p><p>It seemed so unbearably weak since he did not use Force Concentration.</p><p>In his mind however, there was a red sun falling into a frozen river!</p><p>For him, stepping back was not running away. It was his trick to numb Qiu Lin’s sense of crisis and feed her arrogance. He would then get time to prepare for his knockout blow.</p><p>Thunder Roar Zen, Severe Warning!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>When their fists collided with each other, Lou Cheng flew backward like a kite with a broken string to defuse the horrible shock the Buddha’s Warrior Attendant Subdues Demons Movement and Qiu Lin’s metalized body brought. Otherwise, his bones would likely be cracked or even broken.</p><p>“She wins… ”</p><p>“Qiu Lin wins!”</p><p>Many in the audience began making the same assumption. In their eyes, success was within spitting distance for Qiu Lin, since she only needed to catch up with Lou Cheng and deal her killing blow.</p><p>Qiu Lin, however, was stunned on the arena with her face rapidly turning pale. Above her blue-black lips, her eyes were frozen without light in them.</p><p>It seemed like she had suddenly understood some Buddhist symbolism and lost herself in that imaginary world!</p><p>Both feet onto the ground, Lou Cheng took two steps back and defused the influence of Qiu Lin’s force. He poured all his strength into his Jindan, driving him back at Qiu Lin’s side in a flash. During the movements, he stretched his right hand to catch Qiu Lin’s throat.</p><p>Only then did Qiu Lin metalize her neck to resist Lou Cheng’s attack, as if she had just awakened from a long, frozen period.</p><p>But she did not expect Lou Cheng’s blow to be a deception made in a situation when she had not fully recovered and was unable to take swift Absolute Reaction. Swinging his center of gravity, Lou Cheng flashed to the back of his opponent and clapped on both sides of her temples.</p><p>The referee was momentarily stunned before raising his right hand and shouting.</p><p>“Lou Cheng wins!”</p><p>The whole stadium was quiet without any response.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
