Before he knew it, Lou Cheng’s figure had already dominated his vision. He felt as if that left punch was completely unavoidable.</p><p>At this critical moment, he crouched down like an agile monkey and successfully dodged the Lou Cheng’s Thunder Roar Zen. Then, he put his left hand behind his hip, pushed out with his right hand and swiftly extended towards his enemy’s crotch.</p><p>This was the Crotch catching Movement that enabled its user to dodge and attack at the same time!</p><p>It wasn’t like Lou Cheng had never used a similar move before, but they were all executed on the spot with extremely rough follow-ups since he had never practiced it on purpose before. Meanwhile, the “stealing peach” movement of “monkey shape” was the culmination of god knows how many generations of fighters. One careless mistake would put Lou Cheng into a tight spot due to its follow-up movements.</p><p>So his heart immediately became calm. He still put forth Thunder Roar Zen with his left fist and the punch created many rings of invisible ripples.</p><p>With this subtle anti-force, the rebound of the spine and the change in the center of gravity, he forcefully pulled away from his body and flashed to the side. Then he tightened his thigh and kicked at Hou Yue who was still crouched on the ground with a crisp sound.</p><p>Hou Yue didn’t succeed in the martial style, stealing peaches, so he pressed down with the left hand in his pocket and exerted a force on it to help him jump out leisurely. He had displayed perfectly one of the changes of Crotch-grasping Movement.</p><p>He took this opportunity to rush in front of Lou Cheng and exerted a force on the abdomen. Then he contracted the fascia in his body and punched his opponent with his right arm at an extraordinary speed to not allow the enemy any time to prepare for the Tremor Punch.</p><p>Lou Cheng crossed his arms in an unhurried way to stop the attack and he even borrowed a little power from this attack.</p><p>But at this moment, the force on Hou Yue’s shoulder suddenly erupted. He made his left hand into a fist and punched it out which was quicker than Lou Cheng’s counterattack and also quicker than his reverberation!</p><p>This was the “Continuation” in the Fly Fall Punch!</p><p>With features like gurgling and an endless river, the core of this martial style was to give up exerting force from his feet and to purely attack with the corresponding parts of the muscles, joints, and fascia. Although the power this martial style was certainly weaker than the former, it was faster and was quicker. Hou Yue hoped that he could interrupt Lou Cheng’s rhythm who was still tightening his muscles and preparing for the Ice Sect Force.</p><p>To win by speed!</p><p>As soon as Lou Cheng saw that Hou Yue’s left fist had generated powerful wind force and this was rushing towards him, Lou Cheng took a breath, raised his right arm, stabilized his waist and suddenly exerted force into his feet.</p><p>Bang! The moment they collided, Lou Cheng straightened his knee and turned his waist. He shook most of his muscles to throw out a powerful Swing Force!</p><p>Hou Yue at that moment felt like he was sitting on a “flying chair” in the amusement park and flew towards the other side involuntarily.</p><p>He quickly adjusted his center of gravity in the air. The moment he landed, he rushed forwards step by step just like an agile monkey. While Lou Cheng rushed up to close the gap. At last, he had come up behind Hou Yue after several steps.</p><p>With the corresponding changes of the muscles and fascia in his body including the five viscera and six bowels, Lou Cheng visualized a brimming river within his mind.</p><p><em>Maybe my Thunder Roar Zen couldn’t influence Hou Yue badly with one or two strikes, so the Frost Force would be much better!</em></p><p><em>If I don’t take this opportunity to make this “monkey” stiffen up and slow down, he would continue to jump around and I would consume more energy!</em></p><p>Feeling the breath which was close behind him, Hou Yue suddenly stepped on the ground hard and his two feet stopped just like two nails firmly pinned to the ground. He turned his body with his momentum and swung his waist. Within his mind, he visualized a full mountain dam.</p><p>Crash!</p><p>The dam wall collapsed, so all the water poured out in a torrent looking like it was about to sweep everything away. This scene affected the corresponding muscle and fascia in Hou Yue’s body so he punched out his two fist ferociously.</p><p>There was an overwhelming attacking force, punching force, as well as a swing force which could blow away any opponent. He could even integrate several different styles into the one punch, which meant that he had really mastered this fist move.</p><p>This was the “Dam Burst” in Fly Fall Punch!</p><p>Lou Cheng was so confident that he didn’t dodge or hide from this attack. The cold current in his body began to build up and the brimming river in his mind was frozen which made the spray become like crystal in a moment, changing the cold current into a surging tidewater.</p><p>This was the Frost Force!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Hou Yue’s fist was very skillful. He punched his fist, not to the right and left, but in the up-and-down direction. Combined with the power like a flood overflowing the dam, part of the frost force had been washed away. He even threw Lou Cheng away.</p><p>However, at the same time, his body was trembling due to coldness infiltrating into his inner body. His lips instantly became blue and his arms stiffened which stopped him from using this opportunity to counterattack.</p><p>Pound! Pound! Pound! He heard his own intense heartbeat and felt the blood in his body rushing into his trunk and limbs.</p><p><em>“I’m alive again…” For a moment, he actually thought to himself.</em></p><p><em>This was the result even after I had punched and dispersed part of the frost force!</em></p><p><em>That’s terrible!</em></p><p>After Lou Cheng was flung out, he stretched his body in the air and landed steadily. He moved forwards so quickly that he even cracked the black bricks. He turned around and began to attack ferociously again.</p><p><em>I have to take the advantage of this situation while my opponent’s body is still cold and stiff so that I can force him to trade blows with me directly!</em></p><p>Confronted with this unrelenting attack, Hou Yue took a final minute to breathe deeply and to make a humming sound. He shook his muscles, fascia, five viscera and six bowels by his inner tempering. He also resolved part of the chill force. As Lou Cheng was close in on him, he lifted his leg quickly and escaped from this attack with his agility.</p><p>One of them kept fleeing while the other kept chasing. They constantly shifted their positions on the ring just like a tiger trying to catch a monkey.</p><p>During this process, Lou Cheng thought he had found an opportunity to beat his opponent down, so he attacked him with Thunder Roar Zen. However, at the final second, his opponent would always barely dodge his attack with his strange and flexible movements.</p><p>In the stand of the guest team, Yan Zheke wrinkled her soft and beautiful eyebrows and said to herself, “I feel something is wrong with him…”</p><p>Geezer Shi sitting next to her said casually,</p><p>“He is too impatient.”</p><p>“Ah?” Yan Zheke turned around in bewilderment.</p><p>Geezer Shi laughed. “After experiencing the battle of life and death, he had learned something useful. But he still needs further training to know how to judge the situation. There is no basic strategy that can be suitable for all situations. So confronted with an opponent like Hou Yue, if he is so impatient and attacks ferociously without considering other factors, the result may not turn out well.”</p><p>“You can recall the battle now to see how far Tremor Punch has missed the target…”</p><p>Yan Zheke suddenly understood, but she still frowned. She clearly remembered that she had discussed with Cheng how to fight with Zhou Zhengquan and Hou Yue in the previous few days. Their discussion focused mostly on Hou Yue in addition to Zhou Zhengquan. And at that time, they planned that they would fight him by focusing on themselves instead of fighting with him based on movements or sneak attacks. They also decided to block his movements by taking every opportunity to use mercurial balance and to attack him at close range.</p><p><em>But Cheng was too impatient!</em></p><p><em>Is there anything in the ring that I haven’t noticed which is forcing Cheng to behave like this?</em></p><p><em>Is that Hou Yue’s ace card?</em></p><p>On the ring, after they had traded blows for a while, Hou Yue gradually became a little slower because he was affected by the residual frost force and he had consumed some energy. He finally slowed by half a beat because he was forced to change his center of gravity and was being blocked continuously by Lou Cheng. This allowed Lou Cheng to close in.</p><p>Lou Cheng moved his left leg in front of his body to guard against any Crotch-grasping Movement by his enemy. Then his right arm tightened and compressed the corresponding muscles, combined with the thunder in his mind, he hit out a Tremor Punch.</p><p>This time, he had enough confidence and good follow-up changes which stopped the opponent from escaping!</p><p>Hou Yue suddenly paused with a solemn face. He dropped his waist and stabilized his center of gravity as the corresponding muscles in his body suddenly shrank.</p><p>There were many gushes of water constantly gathering and rising within his mind which finally accumulated to achieve a mighty flood. The water poured down from the cliff and hit the ground ferociously which then splashed with an intense spray.</p><p>This was “Waterfall” in the Fly Fall Punch!</p><p>This was a difficult technique and had a few shock effects like Tremor Punch!</p><p>This was the killer move Hou Yue had barely mastered in the recent half year. He had been waiting until today to see how ferocious this blow was!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lou Cheng and Hou Yue crossed their fists which caused ring upon ring of concentric ripples to appear in the air. Both of them felt their muscles and fascia shaking and trembling!</p><p>Because Hou Yue was already prepared for this, his abdomen wriggled. He made a humming sound to barely stop the shock effect. He seized the opportunity to move forwards and punched out his fist which looked like a waterfall!</p><p>At this critical moment, Lou Cheng who has been on the alert for Hou Yue’s secret movement suddenly breathed out forcefully and grunted. His abdomen sent out this sound which was like thunder. He created a reverse shock to offset most of the effect.</p><p>He twisted his muscles and straightened his spine. He bounced backwards before Hou Yue’s fist hit on him. Then he moved back two steps and calmly escaped from the blow.</p><p>Next, he began to move forwards and punched out at his enemy with his left arm as he visualized the Thunder Cloud in his mind.</p><p>Because Hou Yue hadn’t recovered from the last attack, he couldn’t dodge in time. All he could do to defend himself was to cross his arms.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Confronted with the Thunder Roar Zen, his body seemed to be shaken forcefully and his blood roiled ceaselessly.</p><p>Lou Cheng would never give him the opportunity to dodge, so he raised his arms and punched Hou Yue arrogantly again and again.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>Hou Yue felt so stunned that he could see stars and his blood rose into mouth while he was hit by Lou Cheng. He staggered and stood on the ring by himself relying on his desperate perseverance.</p><p>Lou Cheng held his Thunder Roar Zen and stopped in front of his opponent. While Hou Yue had already lost focus and all his energy. He fell on the ground without any external force, and then he retched constantly.</p><p><em>“Oh, finally I won…”</em> Lou Cheng breathed in relief with a clear mind. He felt that the Jindan (the Golden Elixir) in his body was sending out a hot current to relieve the exhaustion in his body. At the same time, he felt that he was a little more light headed.</p><p>In the guest team stand, Yan Zheke stood up gladly with her clenched fist, but then she thought of the collection of videos she had seen before.</p><p><em>Most of the mighty fighters didn’t choose to fight patiently but were ferocious and impatient just like Cheng when they were confronted by Hou Yue!</em></p><p><em>“Is it because…”</em> She suddenly thought of a possibility.</p><p><em>Is this because Hou Yue had a supernatural ability which could cause his opponents to become impatient?</em></p><p>Lou Cheng subconsciously rubbed his temples and also sensed something wrong. <em>“At first, I just planned to go all out without hiding my ability or preserving my strength. Then I planned to display Frost Force without hesitation if I had the chance so that I could defeat Hou Yue as soon as possible to save more energy. But, the reality was that the more I battled, the more impatient I was. I even started to compete with him against his strengths which made me miss several Thunder Roar Zens.</em></p><p><em>My consumption is much more than I expected!”</em></p><p>After he realized this, he recalled the battle and suddenly understood that the worry and anxiety he had felt in the beginning felt like was similar to increasingly heavy rain falling on a building.</p><p>This is not normal!</p><p>Can Hou Yue affect my emotions?</p><p>Lou Cheng squinted and couldn’t help but look at Hou Yue who was held by others so he could exit the ring. Lou Cheng saw that Hou Yue could not even stand independently with his two weak legs.</p><p>At the same time, he also saw Zhou Zhengquan taking off his coat and walking towards the ring calmly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
