But after being shocked so many times over Lou Cheng’s progress, as if he had become an entirely new person, he was now used to it. No, to be precise, Lou Cheng no longer surprised him. Instead, he felt like this was how things should be.</p><p><em>Did he give up on mixing the training about Cultivation?</em></p><p>Geezer Shi decided that he did not. Otherwise, Lou Cheng would have informed him and asked about the regular Dan stage training. Since Lou Chen did not do so, that meant he had already achieved what he wanted!</p><p>Further, with his limits, it was impossible for him to complete the six successive bursts without any improvements. Was this the result of fusing his Cultivation?</p><p>As a Mighty One of physical invulnerability, how was it possible that he did not notice if Lou Cheng was in the state of passing his limit? He just was not that accurate. So unlike what Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke thought, even he knew that there were times when Lou Cheng will feel exhausted. That was why Geezer Shi could not understand his current condition.</p><p>What exactly did this kid do?</p><p>Suspicion cranked up, Geezer Shi looked at the phone next to him. But it had been a long time since Lou Cheng had given him a call to ask for help. This time that brat seemed to have even forgotten about reporting his near Dan stage status.</p><p>This made him feel like a very useless master…</p><p>He wondered if he was a forgotten old man…</p><p>…</p><p>The minute Lou Cheng retrieved his phone from the people-in-charge, a beautiful and formally-dressed journalist dressed stopped him. Microphones were shoved in his face, waiting for his response.</p><p>“Nice to meet you, Lou Cheng. I’m Wu Wei from Xing province satellite TV. Do you have time for an interview? It won’t take too long.” The beauty showed a practiced smile and handed Lou Cheng the microphone.</p><p>“Sure.” Lou Cheng turned a little to face the camera directly.</p><p>With a smile, Wu Wei said, “You’re the first in this tournament to defeat a seeded fighter, basically pulling an upset win. Before, you were unknown to us and to the Committee. Your performance showed a clear ability to be a seed.”</p><p>On the day of the tournament banquet, she was also there and made several interviews. She deliberately asked this question to incite controversy and create hype.</p><p>“Perhaps it’s because I’ve been studying in another province all this while and didn’t have much fame here. Besides, I felt like I’ve made a lot of progress lately. No one can tell simply by watching previous matches I’ve been in,” Lou Cheng calmly replied.</p><p>Wu Wei was a little disappointed. She continued to ask with her professional smile, “Have you really just spent one year learning martial arts? Oh, I’m very curious about this. I think the audience in front of the television are too.”</p><p>“I started October last year,” Lou Cheng answered without concealment. This was something people can find out online very easily.</p><p>“One year training to reach Dan Stage… You’re really a rare genius!” Wu Wei was very generous with her compliments.</p><p>There was still a broadcast later and not much time was allocated for this interview, she did not harp on this. She switched the topic and asked, “Is it your first time fighting against someone with supernatural ability? You look like you won pretty easily. What do you think about it?”</p><p>“It wasn’t easy. Strategizing against a fighter with supernatural power is different. It gave me some trouble. I wasn’t so calm as I looked earlier. I felt I was walking on a tightrope. I almost reached my limit.” Lou Cheng was being modest.</p><p>As for how close he came to his limits, that was up for anyone to guess!</p><p>“Is that so… ” Wu Wei glanced at the other rings and asked her last question. “Lou Cheng, what’s your goal for the Youth Tournament this year? Top 16?”</p><p>Considering how he had expended all his strength to win this round, Lou Cheng thought being too modest would make him look hypocritical. So he gave a confident answer instead.</p><p>“Top 4.”</p><p>Top 4 did not mean the fourth. It included the fourth, the third, the second, and the first!</p><p>“Top 4… ” Wu Wei was pleasantly surprised for she finally got something that can make people tune in to her program. “Then I wish you luck. Thank you for accepting this interview.”</p><p>…</p><p>Since the matches were held in intervals, some of the big screens were replaying the previous match. Some of them were even broadcasted live and aired Lou Cheng’s interview to the thousands of spectators present.</p><p>“Top 4… ” Zhang Zhutong had already unclenched the fists in his pockets. But after hearing what Lou Cheng said in the interview, his eyebrows lifted. His fighting desire rose.</p><p>It was neither for revenge nor jealousy. It was the pure desire to defeat a strong enemy.</p><p>Top 4? He thought that it would have to depend on Lou Cheng’s luck.</p><p>Han Zhifei touched the scar on his face and whispered something to himself as well.</p><p>“Top 4… ”</p><p>“What a coincidence. Me too!”</p><p>“And I want to fight for the championship as well!”</p><p>“Top 4… ” Han Ying and Xiong Yu were muttering to themselves as well, but they did not seem to find Lou Cheng prideful or arrogant at all.</p><p>A fighter of Dan stage who could complete six successive bursts in a row had the right to say something like that!</p><p>“Top 4!” Qi Yunfei’s eyes sparkled. She raised her hands and shouted. “Brother Lou Cheng is so handsome!”</p><p>From the way he said “Top 4” neutrally and calmly, it did not sound like he was announcing his goal, but rather a destined result!</p><p>Under a thousand gazes in the audience, in a broadcasted interview with the satellite TV, he dared to give such an answer. That confidence, that calmness…</p><p>She thought Brother Lou Cheng was too handsome just now!</p><p>“I need to ask for more autographs from Cheng… Who knows I might be able to make a huge profit out of this… ” Jiang Fei muttered to himself, unabashedly unambitious. When Cao Lele, Qiu Hailin, and the others overheard him, they burst into laughter.</p><p>It was the first time that Qi Fang and Lou Zhisheng saw their son appearing on television. They recalled how, as a toddler, Lou Cheng ran around with an open-crotch pants. They were suddenly overwhelmed with emotions.</p><p>…</p><p>The moment when Lou Cheng stepped out of the arena and entered the seated area, he saw Wu Ting, Zhang Qiufan, and the rest.</p><p>They were all so excited that their faces turned red. Their eyes lit up when they saw him and they began speaking over each other.</p><p>“Sir Lou, you were awesome!”</p><p>“You were super cool in the match!”</p><p>“Excellent!”</p><p>Lou Cheng shook his head with a smile. He extended his right hand and gave everyone high fives, furthering exciting them.</p><p>Wei Renjie stepped forward just then and laughed. “Lou, we’ve known each other for half a year but I actually didn’t notice that you’re such a terrific fighter. I must be dim-sighted from old age. I can’t imagine someone who has been training for such a short time can be so powerful.”</p><p>“I myself can’t imagine I would be this strong half a year ago. How could you, Mr. Chairman?” Lou Cheng replied, smiling.</p><p>That also meant that, back during the winter vacation, he imagined he would be in Dan Stage in one or two years.</p><p>After exchanging a few words of greetings, Wei Renjie made his offer. “Lou, are you interested in joining the preliminaries team of Xiushan and do something for your hometown?”</p><p>He knew there was not much hope for it. If Lou Cheng really wanted to join the preliminaries, Chu Weicai would have already mentioned it.</p><p>“Mr. Chairman, you know why I can’t. I’m studying in Song city and I have the martial arts club in our college too. I don’t have time or energy to do this, even if I want to.” Lou Cheng politely refused his offer.</p><p>This was what he firmly thought and he would not change his mind.</p><p>He knew a bird in hand was worth two in the bush. He understood his priorities.</p><p>“I understand, I understand.” Wei Renjie sighed. He then asked with the smile, “Then let me ask you a favor. We’re setting up an official team after the tournament and we’ll have a special training. We’ll be inviting a lot of strong fighters to be our instructors. Will you join us? The salary is negotiable.”</p><p>Instructor? Salary? Lou Cheng considered his August plans in August and became interested.</p><p>“I’ll see if I have the time.”</p><p>“Alright. Let me know when you’ve decided.” Wei Renjie and Lou Cheng exchanged phone numbers.</p><p>After he dealt with all the VIP class students, Lou Cheng waved at his parents in the auditorium and Qin Rui and the others who were further away. He pointed at his phone, indicating he had a phone call to make first.</p><p>He walked along the aisle and made it out of the arena. He looked for a quiet place and made his call.</p><p>With any doubt, the number he dialed was Couch Yan’s.</p><p>“Hello?” When Yan Zheke saw the call, she was delighted and her expression became very soft. She sat up with her legs crossed.</p><p>The man who seemed very confident in his interview with the reporter of satellite TV now leaned against the wall, totally relaxed and unconcerned with his image. He chuckled and asked, “Did you see?”</p><p>Did she see the surprise he meant for her?</p><p>“See what? Hmph, I didn’t see anything!” Yan Zheke understood him enough to get his point, but she still grumbled. “You almost reached Force Concentration! It couldn’t be something that you achieved recently, but you kept it from me for so long! You’re so good at hiding things! In the future, if you want to hide anything, I think I wouldn’t be able to find out either!”</p><p>Uh, this was not how he wanted the direction of this conversation to go… Lou Cheng braced himself up and chuckled. “I’m just trying to surprise you. If you knew, it wouldn’t be a surprise. Plus, it’s because we didn’t train together every day. Otherwise I wouldn’t be able to hide it even if I wanted to. When we get married and live together in the future, how will I be able to hide any secrets from you, Detective?”</p><p>“Who wants to get married to you?!” Yan Zheke became embarrassed and punched her stuffed toys.</p><p>Cheng really unabashedly said everything!</p><p>He even mentioned about living together every day!</p><p>Hehe… Lou Cheng successfully switched the topic. He then said flirtily, “The match is over. Won’t Coach Yan give me some compliments?”</p><p>“What compliment?” Yan Zheke asked, lips tugging at the corner.</p><p>“You should say Lou Cheng is incredible! Lou Cheng is awesome! Lou Cheng is amazing!” Lou Cheng dramatically joked, basking in joy over his victory.</p><p>“Pfft… ” Yan Zheke laughed so hard she nearly fell. “Cheng, you’re getting funnier, but also cheekier!”</p><p>“I’m just trying to break the ice,” Lou Cheng answered modestly.</p><p>Hearing what he said, Yan Zheke’s heart was moved. She bit back her urge to giggle, one hand clutching her face. She closed her eyes and praised him in an exaggerated manner.</p><p>“Lou Cheng is incredible! Lou Cheng is awesome! Lou Cheng is amazing!”</p><p>After the shouting, she couldn’t help giggling.</p><p>This was it! She must be infected by Cheng. How could she be so pompous!</p><p>Lou Cheng couldn’t help laughing, entirely relaxed. When his laughter subsided, he asked very gently, “Ke, when are you coming back?”</p><p>“In two or three days… I’ll finish the entry level of inner practice soon.” Yan Zheke became calmer as well, but she could not resist the urge to see him. “You must wait for him.”</p><p>“Two or three days? Don’t worry. I can wait!” Lou Cheng promised.</p><p>…</p><p>In the afternoon, Lou Cheng drew lots and got a Top 9 fighter as his opponent. Their match was scheduled at the No. 3 arena, in the fifth round. But before it was his turn, it was announced that enough contestants were eliminated so he need not compete anymore.</p><p>He was officially the Top 32 of Youth Tournament this year.</p><p>After having dinner and then taking a walk with his parents, Lou Cheng returned to his hotel.</p><p>When he entered the hotel lobby, he noticed many people turning to look at him, seemingly discussing something.</p><p>Due to the broadcasting of the satellites TV, he had become somewhat famous in the martial arts scene in his province… He shook his head and smiled, throwing this to the back of his mind.</p><p>The most important thing was to enter the Dan Stage!</p><p>…</p><p>The next morning, Lou Cheng received a call from Yan Zheke after getting back from his morning exercise.</p><p>“Cheng, your opponent has been announced… ” Her tone was a little off.</p><p>Were the match-ups for the Top 32 elimination already announced? It was still so early. Lou Cheng asked in surprise, “Who?”</p><p>Yan Zheke cleared her throat. “Sister Jingjing. She has connections in the martial arts club of Xing province. She was informed immediately after the match-ups were announced.”</p><p>“Sister Jingjing?” Lou Cheng frowned a little.</p><p>It was another fighter with supernatural ability.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
