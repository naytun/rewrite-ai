Cough… You’ve got trouble already so quickly?”</p><p>“Master, no. It’s not a martial arts problem but something else,” explained Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Name it then. What’s the matter? You killed another guy?” asked Geezer Shi casually.</p><p>“Fine, master deems me as a homicidal maniac now.” Lou Cheng pissed on himself in secret before briefing about his seeking for a part-time job and Gushan Martial Arts School’s two offers. Then he asked,</p><p>“Master, which one do you think I should choose?”</p><p>“Your heart is leaning to the first one, isn’t it? Hundreds of thousands of yuan are placed before you. It’s hard for you not to feel tempted,” answered Geezer Shi with a laugh.</p><p>Lou Cheng heaved a sigh and went on to explain. “I’m very tempted but with some kind of a guilty conscience, I don’t think I should take it. I’m not worth it yet… A Professional Ninth Pin part-time instructor can make ten grand per month on average. Okay, it is probably considered a scarce resource in Xiushan and we have it doubled. That’s way too much for two months’ work.”</p><p>One can not reap where he/she has not sown. Bigger profit comes with bigger risk!</p><p>“You sound sober enough.” Geezer Shi chuckled. “First of all, anyone with a discerning eye can easily see that your overall strength is among the best few in the body refining stage. Considering your young age, short training and great potential, you are more than just an average Professional Ninth Pin martial artist so the average salary and benefits won’t apply to you. Second, cough-cough… That martial art school’s first offer is pretty much a bundle sale. In this circle, once you allow them to use your name, you must bear the corresponding responsibility.</p><p>“If you can turn around and leave everything behind after, taking this money is not a big deal. However, that’s not you. You fought your life for an old friend. After dinner comes the reckoning. If someone capable challenges the school, will you stand up against them? If they get in trouble and turn to you for aid, will you step out to help? If they bully the competitors and dominate the market under your name, will you pry into their conduct?</p><p>“A man, especially those living in this circle, relies on his face. I’m not saying such bundle deals are all bad. Well known martial artists more or less have some income from such cooperation. Cough-cough… But remember to shine your name and learn the other party’s lowdown and morality before making your decision. Don’t be dragged down without knowing why.</p><p>“Ask yourself if you are willing to tie your future to that martial arts school for that amount of money. Yes, I’ve been a bit dramatic. Just trying to make a point.”</p><p>Lou Cheng asked himself the question and pondered.</p><p>“I got it, master. I know what to do.”</p><p>I better not bite off more than I can chew!</p><p>“Terrific. I have one more line for you. Money is important but your center should be your martial arts training. Improve yourself and you’ll have more opportunities to make more money.” Geezer Shi warned before hanging up.</p><p>Lou Cheng spent a few minutes on calming himself down. Instead of answering Qin Rui, he dialed Yan Zheke’s mobile number.</p><p>Sitting at the dinner table, Yan Zheke was having a bowl of porridge made by her father with homemade pickled veggies while chatting with her parents, enjoying their company.</p><p>Her mobile began to ring and vibrate.</p><p>The corners of her mouth went upward and her eyes and brows softened after a quick glance at the phone, excited, perturbed and concerned.</p><p>“I need to answer this,” said Yan Zheke in her slender voice. She picked up her phone and quickly went to the living room. As the phone call connected, she made her way upstairs.</p><p>“Hello. What’s up?” Yan Zheke intended to sound flat and stiff.</p><p>Watching her daughter from behind, Ji Mingyu sighed over her daughter’s softened eyes and unconscious smile.</p><p>Silly girl! Who can you fool?</p><p>She glanced at her husband, who seemed completely unaware, and spoke to herself,</p><p>Only these crude men!</p><p>Hmm! Your little princess is pretty much taken away. You don’t feel anything!</p><p>Noticing the different tone of Yan Zheke, Lou Cheng put on a gentle smile and asked, “Your parents are around?”</p><p>Yan Zheke went upstairs to her bedroom like a little whirlwind. Leaning to the door, she burst into a silent laugh. “Not anymore.”</p><p>“That’s good. I have something to consult Coach Yan.” Lou Cheng moved to the side, leaving the entrance to Jishan House open.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s sweet dimples appeared. She answered merrily, “Go ahead. I’ll give you some good advice.”</p><p>It doesn’t sound bad at all.</p><p>“Ke, remember I told you I wanted to work part-time in some martial arts club? I asked Qin Rui to help me and his master offered me a position… ” Lou Cheng informed his girlfriend of the entire matter.</p><p>Yan Zheke listened carefully with a smile on her face. She really liked it that Lou Cheng always discussed things with her before making up his mind, giving her a strong feeling of involvement as a partner breathing the same air and sharing the same fate together.</p><p>She understood Lou Cheng was not indecisive. At critical moments, he was actually a man of determination, very reliable.</p><p>“I agree with Coach Shi’s opinion. Cheng, you don’t need to get too involved with Xiushan’s martial arts clubs.” Yan Zheke put her thoughts into words carefully. “Uncle Xing and my mom both mentioned martial arts clubs in small places like Xiushan usually have ties to local gangs. You might get dirt on yourself.</p><p>“My dad likes to read old books. One of his favorite lines is ‘There’s something you should do but some are not’.”</p><p>Lou Cheng planned to get some information on Gushan Martial Arts School from Yan Zheke. Her words strengthened his decision. He promised with no hesitation, “Hmm. I’ll follow Coach Yan’s advice and take the second offer.”</p><p>My father-in-law sounds intellectual… Hmm… It’s quite different from praising my master…</p><p>Yan Zheke chuckled, highly satisfied. She then threw another question. “Have you got your medicine?”</p><p>“I’m right outside the drugstore,” laughed Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Which one?” asked Yan Zheke with a bright smile, her eyes rolling with beams.</p><p>“Jishan House, allegedly the best drugstore in Xiushan that sells genuine medicine at a fair rate.” Lou Cheng enjoyed chatting with his girl.</p><p>Yan Zheke smiled, her lips pursed. “That I can promise you. Don’t you find the name familiar?”</p><p>“Familiar how?” Lou Cheng was baffled.</p><p>Yan Zheke burst into a laugh. “Remember? Empress Dowager’s family name is Ji!”</p><p>“Empress Dowager is Empress Dowager to me… ” Lou Cheng made a joke.</p><p>Holy crap! What a small world! I’m going to Empress Dowager’s drugstore!</p><p>Concerned Lou Cheng might feel inferior, Yan Zheke went on to explain, “My dad used to be a poor doctor. Empress Dowager didn’t have much to do when she first came to Xiushan. She started her own business while coaching private students. It took her much time and effort to make the company survive. When they finally made peace with my grandparents, the company began to take shape and develop. I grew up in a relative’s courtyard, much more lively and bustling than now. Wherever I went, I would meet some uncles and aunts who loved to pinch my face.”</p><p>“He-heh. That’s quite similar to my quarter.” Lou Cheng knew his girlfriend’s background pretty well that he didn’t think much about it nor care. He joked along. “I thought you were quite ill in your earlier years without much a cheek.”</p><p>“A bit baby fat… ” Yan Zheke was slightly embarrassed.</p><p>She could tell her boyfriend didn’t feel uncomfortable about it. He was still full of confidence.</p><p>Lovers in a hot relationship could talk about random stuff forever. The phone call lasted until Ji Mingyu urged Yan Zheke to go down. She found it hard to tear herself away from her boyfriend but had to say goodbye to Cheng and start her day — spending the morning with her parents and visiting her grandpa in the County of Zhengque.</p><p>…</p><p>Holding the hot phone, Lou Cheng dialed Qin Rui’s number, determined.</p><p>“Cheng, you’ve decided?” Qin Rui sounded full of joy.</p><p>My old classmate is about to work part-time in the school as a capable Professional Ninth Pin martial artist. All the schoolmates will look up upon me!</p><p>“Yeah. I just phoned my master. I’m not done training with him yet so I can’t use my name as an advertisement. You know, in this circle we must honor teachers and esteem truth.” Lou Cheng blamed his master.</p><p>He felt lost after turning the first offer down. “300,000 yuan… My dad hasn’t saved this much after decades of hard work… ”</p><p>Never mind. In this world, there’s something we should do but some are not.</p><p>“Understood!” Qin Rui had sympathy for his opinion. “So you’ll take the VIP class? I’ll tell my master right away. Sigh… Cheng, you are already this powerful, still not done training? Your master is too strict… When can you finish? After reaching the Dan stage?”</p><p>From this, not hard to guess how brilliant Lou Cheng’s master must be!</p><p>“Maybe… ” answered Lou Cheng, his face blank as he had no idea when his training would end.</p><p>Dan stage? High-ranked Dan Stage? Or physical invulnerability stage?</p><p>Qin Rui called back after a few minutes and laughed. “My master said it won’t be a problem. Come over if you have time today. Let’s clinch the deal.”</p><p>“Sure. I’ll be over in one hour.” Lou Cheng exhaled, feeling at ease as everything settled.</p><p>He hung up and walked in Jishan House. He purchased bags of medicine according to the Seven Posts, which cost him over 1,700 yuan.</p><p>“1,700 for one week’s medicine… Two months… It will be 15,000… ” Lou Cheng did some calculation and was shocked by how money consuming it was to enter the Dan stage.</p><p>That’s if I can wield my strength as one in two months!</p><p>No wonder Ke asked me to save my money…</p><p>To keep his recipe secure, he didn’t let the drugstore cook the medicine for him. He brought the bags back home and then headed over to Gushan Martial Arts School.</p><p>Outside his destination, he fixed his clothes and hair and whisked away the dust before going in.</p><p>From today, I’ll be a coach here. I must care for my appearance!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
