Any student with a Pin ranking can teach them, right? Why are you worried about insufficient manpower?” Lou Cheng asked while stomach rumbled. The barbecue meat was not ready yet.</p><p>Qin Rui laughed and said, “You don’t understand. Now, everything needs to be divided into ranks. Our Summer Class is three times a week, half a day each session. Different classes are sorted into suitable times. There are also several classes with tuition. Casually find a set of students with Pin, that is the lowest class, 888 for two months. The more powerful teachers are 1288. Our disciples teach for 2088. Nominally they will follow their teachers. They don’t only pay, but they also need to have connections.”</p><p>“And this works?” Lou Cheng listened with full of interest. The only uncomfortable part was that his stomach was burning with hunger.</p><p>Although he was more mature than when he first entered the university, the social class that he had contact with was relatively monotonous. So many things were still confusing.</p><p>Qin Rui gently patted the table and said, “Believe me! At first, we did not want to split the classes like that either, but the parents were dissatisfied. Oh, how can my child practice with so many other people? What can he learn? What if he is not taken care of? What if he is hurt? Do you have a better class here? One with fewer students and more a powerful teacher, money is not a problem!”</p><p>He pinched his throat when he was saying the last few sentences, which looked quite vivid and funny. Qi Yunfei and Ding Yanbo could not help but laugh out loud like two small quails.</p><p>Ding Yanbo did not think Brother Rui even had such a side.</p><p>“Comparison is the source of human progress… ” Lou Cheng forged a famous sentence. His nose wiggled as the fragrance of barbecued meat made it to his nose.</p><p>Qin Rui drank some coconut juice and continued, “College students speak well. Who doesn’t have that bit of competitive spirit? If you were to do part-time, you’ll probably be scheduled for the most advanced classes. And believe it or not, there will be a team of students waiting to enlist. You are a rare Professional Ninth Pin in Xiushan… ”</p><p>Before he could finish, Lou Cheng humorously added,</p><p>“Living!”</p><p>Puff… Qi Yunfei just drank some soymilk and almost spit it out.</p><p>Qin Rui smiled and breathed. “The moment, you, our living advertisement is out, the other martial arts clubs can only shut down. We definitely wish you would come!”</p><p>“I don’t think you need my name in your promotions right?” In this regard, Lou Cheng was shy and easily embarrassed.</p><p>“Okay. You want to be modest,” said Qin Rui frankly. “I can’t decide what to do. I’ll ask my master tomorrow and give you a call.”</p><p>He was not the owner of that martial arts dojo. It was impossible to promise the salary or bonus Lou Cheng could get at this moment.</p><p>“Sure, sorry to trouble you.” Lou Cheng sincerely thanked him.</p><p>At this moment, wistfully, he finally saw the first batch of barbecue being sent over.</p><p>Later, he ate and replied to Yan Zheke, while chatting with Qin Rui about high school students and the Xiushan martial arts circle. By the time they had eaten enough, it was close to 9:30 p.m.</p><p>After paying the bill and saying goodbye, Lou Cheng looked at his cousin and said,</p><p>“Feifei, it’s late already. Are you going back with me?”</p><p>“Yup.” Qi Yunfei replied while lightly nodding.</p><p>She was so well-behaved that Lou Cheng was a little surprised. He thought she would drag her feet and refuse to do so!</p><p><em>When did this the little devil become so easy to talk to?</em></p><p>He did not reveal his doubts. They said goodbye to Qin Rui and Ding Yanbo. He stopped a taxi and they went straight to their district.</p><p>In the car, Qi Yunfei maintained a quiet and silent attitude. Lou Cheng was amazed. He guessed that she must have been stunned by something.</p><p>Just now she was cheerful and playful!</p><p>“Feifei, how are you? You seem a little depressed.” Lou Cheng looked at the taxi driver in the front seat and asked her with concern.</p><p>Qi Yunfei awakened from her daze and said, “I played the whole day. So I’m a little sleepy.”</p><p>“I’m also sleepy. I didn’t even take a nap.” Lou Cheng reached up with his hand and covered his mouth, yawned, and smelled the heavy barbecue flavor.</p><p>Entering their estate, back at home, his mother Qi Fang greeted them when he was just about to open the door.</p><p>“You bad boy. Why did you come back so late? Where did you go?”</p><p>“Uh, how come you two came back together?”</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed and said, “We met on the way home. Mom, today when you called, why didn’t you say Feifei was coming?”</p><p>Qi Fang laughed twice. “I must have been too busy and forgot about it.”</p><p>She sniffed and said, with a voice of disdain, “Barbecue! You had a barbecue, that’s why you are back so late? I told you that those things were not hygienic. We never know if the meat they use is good or bad. Eat less!”</p><p>Familiar nagging, familiar concern. Lou Cheng did not have the slightest thought of arguing, so he just replied, “Yes, yes, yes.”</p><p>Qi Fang continued for a while. Then suddenly, she patted her head and said, “Oh, I almost forgot to tell you. Cheng, you sleep in the living room tonight. We’re giving your room to your cousin.”</p><p>“Mom, am I your real son? This is my first day back home!” Lou Cheng said jokingly.</p><p>Qi Fang went back to the sofa and sat down next to Lou Zhisheng. She smiled and said, “I only dare do this, precisely because you’re my biological son.”</p><p><em>Eh, did mum just become fashionable…</em> Lou Cheng chuckled. He did not hurry to pack things, sitting down on the single sofa instead. He had intended to have a chat with his father and mother. But all Qi Yunfei did was to go to the room after a quick greeting. After changing clothes, she went straight to the bathroom.</p><p>Lou Zhisheng pushed up his gold-rimmed glasses, looked at Lou Cheng with a smile, and said,</p><p>“Nice. You’re looking good. Martial arts is a very useful thing.”</p><p>Hearing this sentence, Qi Fang looked up and took a breath. She carefully looked at her precious son, then she laughed and said,</p><p>“If your dad didn’t mention it, I would not have noticed. All I could see is that you’ve lost weight. Your spirit is good! You seem more ‘shuntou’ as compared to your father when he was young!”</p><p>“Shuntou” is Xiushan dialect, meaning handsome.</p><p>“How is it about me again?” Lou Zhisheng complained and sipped a mouth of tea. After pondering for a dozen seconds, he said “Cheng, is it expensive to practice martial arts? If you do not have enough money, although we’re not that rich, we still have some savings.”</p><p>Lou Cheng did not expect that his dad would make such an offer from the start. In a daze, he asked, “Dad, why did you suddenly ask?”</p><p>To Improve from the body refining stage to the Dan stage required a nutritional medicine soup and other things to cooperate with the practice of martial arts so that the strength of the body could integrate as a whole. Though this would cost a lot, he had already made his plans. Besides the Youth Tournament within the province at the end of July and early August, he also intended to get a part-time job at Gushan Martial Arts School. Along with his private savings of 20,000, he should have enough.</p><p>Lou Zhisheng let out a sigh.</p><p>“Your dad is a knucklehead, only knowledgeable about his own work, and not too concerned about other aspects. Since I knew that you intend to travel down the path of a martial artist, I wanted to do some research, only to find out that I’m of no use. I don’t understand anything. I can only watch TV and ask the young men in our factory. They said that Professional Nine Pin to Eight Pin is a threshold to cross. It’ll be very expensive. You called your mother before to tell her the news, so you should be at this threshold, right?”</p><p>Father and mother did not ask much about martial arts related things, so Lou Cheng thought that his family was not for or against martial arts. Who knew they had been quietly concerned, inquiring about it, and preparing. This love had no regrets, without a word.</p><p>Puff… he breathed out, barely laughed, and said, “Dad, Mom, you don’t have to worry. I received a bonus from fighting in the competition. And I’ll have a part-time job at a classmate’s school during summer break. I should have enough. If not, I’ll ask you for help.”</p><p><em>Mom and Dad have already worked hard enough just to afford my tuition fees!</em></p><p>“You keep that little bit of money to spend. Don’t scrimp and save too much, you’ll be easily looked down on by roommates and friends!” Qi Fang interrupted.</p><p>“What is ‘a little’ money?” Lou Cheng laughed, “I’ve more than 20,000 on my card!”</p><p>He only told mum he had prize money from the preliminaries, but not specifically how much. Qi Fang took it for granted, thinking that it was no more than a thousand.</p><p>“More than 20,000?” Qi Fang widened her eyes, Lou Zhisheng could not help but push up his glasses.</p><p>Oops, he accidentally exposed how much his private savings was… Lou Cheng quickly laughed and said, “Yes, at your son’s current strength, making a few thousand CNY is very easy. Save your money for a bigger house. I can’t sleep in the living room every time my cousin comes, right?”</p><p>Qi Fang laughed, covered her eyes, then said, “Oh, our child has a gift… ”</p><p>Lou Zhisheng drank his tea and took a long breath,</p><p>“Your mother was right, you really have more skills than when I was young… ”</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled. “This is called ‘the blue dye extracted from indigo is bluer than indigo’.”</p><p>These words made the old couple laugh. The topic moved from martial arts to the other matters. And Qi Yunfei slipped into the room while rubbing her half -long-half-short hair. She turned on her computer and seriously watched the content of the last search, a section of fighting videos with Lou Cheng in them!</p><p>After watching a video, she could not help but look outside. It seemed unbelievable that the protagonist on the arena was in the living room. She could not believe that it was her cousin!</p><p>In the living room, Lou Zhisheng and Qi Fang knew their son had to exercise every day, so they went back to their room after 10.</p><p>Lou Cheng took out his boxer briefs, intending to take a shower before sleeping. He had just walked two steps when he remembered his cousin was in the house. So he went back to his backpack and took out the pajamas that Yan Zheke gave him.</p><p>He could not wear boxers and run around in front of a 15-year-old girl, right?</p><p>He knew how to avoid trouble now that he was older. <em>Hey, Zheke certainly did not expect the pajamas she gave would come in handy at a time like this!”</em></p><p>Lou Cheng’s thoughts flew. Suddenly he heard his bedroom door opened.</p><p>Qi Yunfei was standing at the door with her face flushed. She grinned and shouted,</p><p>“Big brother Lou Cheng!”</p><p>“Huh?” Lou Cheng looked at her in bewilderment.</p><p>“Nothing, I just wanted to call you that.” Qi Yunfei shut the door, feeling very happy.</p><p><em>Haha, I have a super powerful brother!</em></p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
