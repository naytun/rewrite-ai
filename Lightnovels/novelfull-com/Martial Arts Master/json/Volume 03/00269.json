But at this moment, he understood the meaning behind those four words. Out of the blue, without any signs, he was suffering from a sudden massive headache on the arena!</p><p><em>“No, it was not a sudden headache!” He instantly understood when he remembered the irritable change in his ears earlier.</em></p><p>This was the unique skills of Plague Sect that used inaudible sounds to cause headaches in the listener!</p><p><em>And the opponent will most definitely take advantage of your illness to defeat you!</em></p><p>Meng Jiefeng pursed his mouth, a strong fighting desire glistening in his eyes. He twisted his back, kicked his right leg behind him like a scorpion swaying its tail.</p><p>The mistake fighters who were close to or had just entered the Dan stage made the most often was thinking they could use Force Concentration to handle any issue. Although the Headache Ululating could be reduced by shrinking the qi and blood, using Force Concentration blindly at such a limited distance was akin to serving oneself as a human sandbag for the opponent.</p><p>Even if an ordinary attack will expend some of his power, making it difficult for him to directly use Force Concentration later on, he could still kick Lou Cheng’s vital parts!</p><p>Pia! His dark blue trousers were pulled tight and his right leg bulged three times its former thickness. Causing a ripple in the air, he ferociously kicked between Lou Cheng’s legs.</p><p>Horse kick and scorpion swings tail!</p><p>The minute Lou Cheng understood it, he recalled his life-or-death fight with the Professional Ninth Pin in Dark Sect. His flesh crawled. He felt like he was once again teetering on the dangerous edge of life.</p><p>He had no fears, panic, or hesitations. With a heart as still as a lake of ice, he calmly made his decision. He moved his arm that had most of its force dissipated, stretching the tendon, and unleashed his force within a short distance. He opened his palm wide and caught Meng Jiefeng’s back, and ripped his dark blue martial arts suit in the process.</p><p>Dang! Meng Jiefeng also moved against his attack. His skin bulged as dark-blue as iron which abruptly blocked the claws that could even tear the metal chain apart.</p><p>Lou Cheng did not expect to break the defense of Metal-like Refined Body in one hit. The force in his fingertips was smooth and clear, so he stopped gripping and pressed his hand downwards.</p><p>Meng Jiefeng’s center of gravity sank under Lou Cheng’s pressure and the right leg that he had extended lost all its strength halfway to his kick. But it slowed only a short moment before recovering its ferocious momentum.</p><p>Thanks to the rebound from his force on Meng Jiefeng’s back, Lou Cheng moved his center of gravity all the while enduring his headache. He made a forceful turn, barely dodging the dangerous horse kick. He took a few steps backwards to put some distance between he and his opponent. He withdrew his qi and blood and held his force to condensing all the sensations of his headache.</p><p>“Well done! Offense is the best defense! Lou Cheng’s response to the sudden attack is too beautifully done!” When Lou Cheng showed his five fingers, the guest commentator in the broadcasting studio complimented him. “Everyone can watch the playback later. Just now Meng Jiefeng’s abdomen bulged and his throat moved. Obviously, he attacked with inaudible sounds. If I’m not mistaken, those are attacks that cause a headache from Plague Sect. He has never used it before, so it’s not something that can be easily detected. To think Lou Cheng can respond that way when he’s suffering from the headache, it really shows how great his actual fighting ability is. Eh… ”</p><p>He suddenly paused because he saw that Meng Jiefeng was not disappointed when his kicks missed his enemy. He turned around by this trend and attacked Lou Cheng face to face. When Lou Cheng was still doing the Force Concentration, his eyes turned dark and his abdomen became round again. His throat trembled and sent out an invisible sound with the help of “soundless bell”.</p><p>HUM!</p><p>The blood vessels in Lou Cheng’s forehead twitched. He once again felt the pain of headache. It seemed that his spirit was also affected. Before he could complete his attempt of Force Concentration, his preparation had become a total chaos.</p><p>The sound attacks in Plague Sect attacked not only the flesh but also the spirit!</p><p>After Meng Jiefeng’s twin Headache Ululating attacks, his face also paled despite being a strong fighter of the Dan stage. Taking advantage of the chaos in his opponent’s body, he inhaled. His temple bulged, tinting his skin red.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>It seemed as if gunpowder exploded in his body. He swung his right arms, thrusting himself forwards. He propelled his body to cut through the air, shortening the distance. It allowed him to run into Lou Cheng’s chest like a bomb.</p><p>He used a technique that combined the Modern Blast Punch with Tremor Punch!</p><p>He had entered this Youth Tournament with the unpopular idea of advancing into the top four, he thought.</p><p>After his attempt at Force Concentration was interrupted earlier, Lou Cheng dared not make a second attempt so soon. It was too late for him to doge and he was left to endure the impact of Meng Jiefeng’s aggressive fist squarely on his body. He first took a short breath and stabilized his qi and blood, visualizing a scene of overhead dark clouds and thunder.</p><p>Pia! His hand, wrist, and arm muscles tightened. He swung his shoulder and punched with his right fist.</p><p>Seabed Tremor!</p><p>Tremor Punch against Tremor Punch!</p><p>Bang! Without smoke and only waves of wind blowing in all direction, a loud sound came from the arena. Lou Cheng’s qi and blood twisted in him. His vital organs were all affected. He felt so sick that his throat was dry and his head was dizzy.</p><p>Meng Jiefeng shared similar feelings, but he endured better than his opponent because what he practiced was Metal-like Refined Body. He shrank the muscles in his abdomen and thickened his neck, making the dark green veins protruding under his skin form an odd floral pattern.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>He did not retreat. He hit out a ferocious pound with his bulging left arm, his fist glowing a green light.</p><p>Lou Cheng was afraid his opponent’s unique skills would once again affect him. He did not dare use Force Concentration in his current state. He could only control his organs through inner practice, compressing his muscles to make a reverse wave to offset his attack. His back muscles made a brief appearance and his hands were crossed in front of his body to block Meng Jiefeng’s fist.</p><p>Phew!</p><p>The sound of whistles rang everywhere. Lou Cheng felt his opponent’s fist turning hot and cold, giving him an empty feeling like he was being hurt by the dark wind. He could not help shuddering. He had a feeling he was about to fall ill.</p><p>The Chill Frost? He thought of an idea and visualized the scene of a red sun falling into an icy river without hesitation.</p><p>He did not have time to prepare Severe Warning, but that was not his goal anyway. Based on the pre-match discussions, he visualized the collision between ice and fire, leading to the explosion of his supernatural ability and dispersion of the weird force invading his body.</p><p>Kill the person with ice and fire!</p><p>Bang! Lou Cheng’s face sometimes turned red, sometimes green. The cold currents mixed with the hot waves surged to eliminate the feeling of emptiness and exhaustion.</p><p>However, it was impossible for Meng Jiefeng to wait for him to recover. He continued to use killer moves on Lou Cheng without stopping.</p><p>With the use of Chill Force, Lou Cheng had gotten rid of the continuous negativity of Headache Ululating. He exerted force into his feet, lowered his waist, and used Force Concentration!</p><p>Boom! The force gushed. Meng Jiefeng’s skin bulged, exposed a dark green color. His figure became a little bigger. He took a step forwards and bent backwards. Throwing out his right arm, he wielded it like a spear.</p><p>Pulley Lift!</p><p>Just as Lou Cheng had gotten rid of the effects of Chill Force, he was now confronting such a ferocious attack.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, normal fighters of the Dan stage would have no time to defend themselves with Force Concentration. The defeat was inevitable.</p><p>However, Lou Cheng inhaled slightly and instantly restrained his qi and blood, spirit and force. But he did not try to pursue the ultimate state. He also did not try to condense a “point” or create a quick, half-baked Dan.</p><p>In it contained a way to balance and to rotate!</p><p>When the half-made human body big Dan became solid, it would explode and create reasonably strong “waves”.</p><p>“It’s also possible this way, huh… ” The guest commentator, Yu Hong, whispered to himself.</p><p>This seemed like an imitation of Force Concentration by the fighters who lacked understanding about martial arts, but in essence, this was different. Aside from its smaller impact, it was basically Force Concentration.</p><p>In a split second, Lou Cheng half-finished the eruption of the power of Dan stage. His muscles bulged and his body leaned forwards. He quickly moved his shoulders before he suddenly punched out a fist downwards.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As their fists collided, Meng Jiefeng bent his back and the muscles on his arm were so powerful that his sleeves were almost ripped apart. He was completely unleashing the power of “Raise”.</p><p>Lou Cheng was only unleashing half his outbreak, so he was obviously weaker than an opponent using his full strength. Attacked by the pulling force, he found it difficult to stabilize his center of gravity and he was abruptly thrown into the air.</p><p>From the beginning, one passive step was followed by a series of even more passive steps!</p><p>In a life-and-death match, every movement was meant to be fatal!</p><p>Yan Zheke covered her mouth unconsciously because she was afraid that she would cry out of Lou Cheng’s name. Before the fish jumped over the dragon gate and under the condition that he didn’t have the flying supernatural ability, if a fighter left the ground passively, it meant that he was about to lose the match.</p><p>Meng Jiefeng did not do so well before this match, but this time he showed all his strength!</p><p>“How powerful.” Zhang Zhutong’s chuckle was full of complications.</p><p>Meng Jiefeng had become much stronger since last year. If it was him who confronted Meng Jiefeng instead of Lou Cheng, he would likely be forced into passivity as well.</p><p>It was not only Lou Cheng who can drop surprises! Qiu Lin can, so can Meng Jiefeng.</p><p>After he sent Lou Cheng flying in one move, Meng Jiefeng once again breathed into his Dantian and made a Double Explosion.</p><p>Crack! With the broken sound, he rushed at Lou Cheng with a bullet-like speed. Lou Cheng had just begun adjusting his center of gravity, two meters from the ground.</p><p>Had he not blocked Meng Jiefeng with his half outbreak, he might not even be able to adjust his center of gravity!</p><p>Seeing Meng Jiefeng standing below and waiting for a chance to attack him, Lou Cheng breathed in and lowered his upper body.</p><p>He took a short time to adjust his muscles and prepare his visualization of the scene of a red sun falling into an icy river.</p><p><em>Bring it on!</em></p><p>Take his Severe Warning!</p><p>Seeing Lou Cheng lowering himself so much he almost showed the crown of his head, Meng Jiefeng suddenly laughed and stepped next to Lou Cheng.</p><p>It was not as if Meng Jiefeng missed out on Lou Cheng and Qiu Lin’s match and did not know his simplified movement of physical invulnerability. Knowing Lou Cheng had the time to prepare, how he could go strength against strength with him?</p><p>As his joints accumulated power, the fascia on his wrist protruded and turned a terrifying black and green.</p><p>He pierced the air with Eagle Claw and defended himself with Shooting Fillip.</p><p>Lou Cheng was not disappointed to find his opponent being cautious. He seized the chance when his enemy on the move and used Force Concentration mid-air.</p><p>His body suddenly curled up with the introversion of qi and blood, force and spirit. He rolled himself as a ball. He then quickly stretched his body in the air. With the power from the outbreak of Dan stage, he kicked out his right foot ferociously.</p><p>Pia! His right foot kicked on Meng Jiefeng’s Eagle Claw. Rebounding, he changed his position and kicked his opponent’s throat at the same time. It seemed that he wanted to use it as a stepping stone to go upwards like Goddess Chang flying to the moon!</p><p>Meng Jiefeng swayed after Lou Cheng’s violent kick. He thought he might have to retreat and lost the chance to win if his enemy was not mid-air or using all his power. If he waited for Lou Cheng to land and use Force Concentration again, it would be difficult for him to defeat an opponent who can use an unlimited amount of successive bursts. After all, he had used Headache Chime twice himself.</p><p>He raised his left arm against Lou Cheng’s feet. Then he turned over and exerted force on Lou Cheng’s legs so that he could fly even higher!</p><p>Lou Cheng used the momentum to jump over his opponent’s head. He landed further away, like a bird seeking for the ground. But Meng Jiefeng moved his center of gravity and took three steps backwards. Once again he stood on the position. Inhaling and compressing his qi and blood, he made Force Concentration.</p><p>Bang! His temple bulged. His back straightened and he punched a Rocket-like Punch towards the sky!</p><p>A real rocket!</p><p>When he was making Force Concentration, Lou Cheng was also making one of his own. Lou Cheng unified his qi and blood and dropped with a fast speed, allowing him to change position in time.</p><p>Boom! That point exploded. Lou Cheng tightened his muscles and extended his right hand to catch his enemy’s fist.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>His vessels and tendons were so prominent that they could not help trembling from the impact of the explosion. But his five fingers were firmly holding the opponent’s right fist.</p><p>Buzz! While he was doing his inner practice to eliminate the effect of the tremor, Lou Cheng heard the sound of the opponent’s actions through his connection with Meng Jiefeng and his perfect meditation ability.</p><p>He was going to punch out his left fist, his Collapsing Sea Floor fist… Lou Cheng thought of a new idea and began to pressing his opponent instead of grasping. His body abruptly bounced, avoiding Meng Jiefeng’s chain attack in time.</p><p>He then seized the opportunity to sink his center of gravity once again. Finally, he landed on the ground before his enemy made his kick.</p><p>With his feet on the ground, Lou Cheng took a breath before he used Force Concentration again. He then swung his left arm from the other side.</p><p>Double successive bursts!</p><p>At such a close distance, Meng Jiefeng had no other way, but to make a Double Explosion as well. His temples bulged as he lashed out his Modern Blast Punch to trade fists with Lou Cheng.</p><p>Bang! They both trembled at the same time. Meng Jiefeng defended himself with Metal-like Refined Body, but Lou Cheng once again casually completed Force Concentration, his condition completely recovered.</p><p>Triple Explosion!</p><p>He wanted to suppress his opponent using his ability to pull off successive bursts!</p><p>The unique skills in Plague Sect were indeed powerful, but he would not give Meng Jiefeng the opportunity to use them!</p><p>Bang! Because Meng Jiefeng could not catch up with the fighting speed, his arms began trembling and his qi and blood also rolled over. He lost his center of gravity as well.</p><p>Lou Cheng took this opportunity to catch up to him. He began to hit his opponent who had a Metal-like Refined Body.</p><p>Dang! Dang! Dang!</p><p>One tremor! Two tremors! Three tremors!</p><p>Lou Cheng hit on Meng Jiefeng’s metal-like body and punched out the tremors, not giving Meng Jiefeng any opportunity to recover or use the unique skills of Plague Sect!</p><p>Four tremors! Five tremors! Six tremors! Lou Cheng was excited as if he was Thor. From above, he punched his opponent on the shoulder.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A crisp sound echoed. Meng Jiefeng staggered and fell to the ground in dizziness, without sustaining any visible external injuries.</p><p>Lou Cheng was so excited that he wanted to hit two more tremors, but the referee stopped him.</p><p>“Lou Cheng wins!”</p><p>The sound was so loud that the audience actually had a hearty and delighted feeling!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
