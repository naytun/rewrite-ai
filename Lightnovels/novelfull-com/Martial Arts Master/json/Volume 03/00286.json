He despised the troublesome trivialities like networking, quarrels, and secret conflicts.</p><p>Faithful to martial arts; faithful to his beloved. Even if it was just carrying textbooks and discussing about coursework, it was so much better than playing power politics to get to the top!</p><p>He realized Mo Jingting’s tense body had relaxed. With a smile, she said sweetly, “Junior Master, your words earlier are incorrect. Nowadays, professionalism is key. We have professional managers and talented disciples to take care of the company. The leader Grandmaster just does the monitoring. How is he busy? He’s still carefree!”</p><p>What did she mean? Where was her true position? What were her true feelings? Or was she coming up with idle talk to dissipate the awkwardness… Lou Cheng paused, confused by the words coming from his niece apprentice.</p><p>Compared to her, Lou Cheng was still inexperienced with life.</p><p>“You lying girl, I can never hear a word of truth from your mouth. Since the beginning of our company, how many subsidiaries we have started? How many industries have we entered? Just supervising them alone is enough to give me a headache. Besides, I don’t only have to worry about these things. I also have to worry about our internal affairs, alliances, and the entire martial arts world. I’ve completely jumped into a pit where I’m forced to work hard,” Geezer Shi said, wearing a smug expression of superiority.</p><p>“There are professionals who aid you. The Grandmaster has so much free time as he only needs three to four hours to deal with work,” Mo Jingting said, grinning.</p><p>Geezer Shi ignored her and turned towards his silly apprentice.</p><p>“Don’t rush into your answer. Think about it carefully. Don’t worry about external factors. If you’re intimidated by such small obstacles, how will you survive the martial arts world?”</p><p>“Don’t consider other things and ask yourself what you really want. Someone once said a taste of power is enough to get one addicted. Don’t rush into your decision to supplement your inexperience.”</p><p>He spoke in his usual voice without a shred of seriousness, but Mo Jingting who reading between the lines became stunned. She subconsciously frowned.</p><p>Was this the strength of a Mighty One with physical invulnerability?</p><p>Lou Cheng need not care about external factors, because everything was fine as long as he was around?</p><p>“Yes, Master.” Lou Cheng closed his eyes, recalling the past. He imagined certain scenes on TV and hearsay.</p><p>Geezer Shi grinned. “I won’t say much about the benefits of leading the sect. If you want to stay out of the limelight, you can apply for the top professional competitions. You don’t have to put all your eggs in one basket.”</p><p>“I don’t have to join Wuyue Club?” Lou Cheng was wide-eyed in surprise.</p><p>Knowing the conditions of the sect, he thought he would have to join the Wuyue Club for sure once he acquired High Pin and gained his physical invulnerability.</p><p>Could he betray the sect?</p><p>Geezer Shi tutted. “Wuyue Club is just an alliance, it’s not sect. We’ll have done our jobs if we can have even one fighter of physical invulnerability to represent Wuyue Club and fight in the top career competition. Other clubs are more willing to enroll external talents. You’re neither imparting martial art outside, holding the power, nor damaging the foundation of the club. It’s not a betrayal to join. There are a few examples of this.”</p><p>“But sects like Daxing Temple and Shangqing Sect need not invite guests. Just take Yanzhao League and Longhu Club for examples. They have no shortage of Mighty Ones wanting to join them. Oh, you can also marry into Shushan Study. I don’t mind it.”</p><p>Marry? Lou Cheng broke into cold sweat and even wanted to roll his eyes at his master.</p><p>Marry into Shushan Study? Mo Jingting’s full lips were half-open. Deep in thought, she took a breath.</p><p>Geezer Shi sighed.</p><p>“Shang Qing, Shushan, and Longhu. These three held the Restriction Sect in the Taoist School. I’ve been longing for it for years… ”</p><p>Shangqing Sect, Shushan Study, and Longhu Club held the first Restriction Sect of the Five Sects Unique Skill in the Taoist School? Upon discovering such a secret for the first time, Lou Cheng blurted out, “I thought the government would have some of them… ”</p><p>No wonder these three dominated the Top Six lists year after year.</p><p>Geezer Shi looked as if he was speaking to a group of fools. “It took Longhu Club only about 30 years to catch up with our established sect. Who do you think is behind them?”</p><p>“Oh, I see!” Lou Cheng ignored his master’s expression.</p><p>He took out his phone and habitually shared this with Ke.</p><p>“I know… My grandparents have experienced… I think the one Shushan Study has is called Tai Qing Article… ” Yan Zheke sent a bewildered emoji and shared her secret with her boyfriend. “I only recently found out about Longhu Club. I’m so ill-informed… It’s totally my grandparents’ fault. They rarely tell me these things!”</p><p>“Exactly! My master looked at me as if he was looking at a fool… ” Lou Cheng grumbled.</p><p>“You’re silly indeed. Silly Cheng! You don’t even know someone’s hitting on you!” Yan Zheke humped.</p><p>“This shows that I’m honest and simple. I only have my fairy in my heart.” Lou Cheng flirted with ease.</p><p>After their conversation earlier, Mo Jingting drove the car in silence.</p><p>Leaving the roundabout and turning into the hillside road, she returned to her usual liveliness and smiled. “Junior Master, sect is still formally located half way up the Yanbing Mount, but people seldom go there except for formal ceremonies. But it’s a great vacation place, especially in the summer.”</p><p>“Why?” Lou Cheng asked with suspicion.</p><p>Geezer Shi was gruff. “The present cannot match up to the past. To establish sect in the wild, thousand miles from any inhabited region, are you waiting for someone to bombard or rob it?”</p><p>Mo Jingting chuckled. “The sect operates in the so-called Ice God Tower in the most prosperous business district. They handle everyday affairs there, but live separately. Only junior apprentices are accommodated together. Hehe, every year they’ll be grounded here for extra training.”</p><p>Moshang was the capital of Wu Yue.</p><p>As Mo Jingting introduced the place, Lou Cheng was looking at the information his fairy provided, such as the famous disciples and the master-to-disciple succession of teachings in sect.</p><p>Halfway up the mountain, he already had a preliminary, but complete understanding of Ice God Sect.</p><p>He Yi, Sheng Guitian, and his little-known master were the Three Great Heads of physical invulnerability of the former generation. There were still several peers of the Dan stage, but their physical conditions had degraded and they rarely came out in the public.</p><p>In his generation, there was Senior Yuejian, who had physical invulnerability, and four high-ranked seniors of the Dan stage. They were responsible for different affairs in the sect and aided the leader. There were also ten other peers of the Dan Stage who took care of the business side of the sect.</p><p>And in his generation, the oldest one was only in his thirties. There were two people of the high rank and 10 of lower rank, including Zhu Tai. Some of them entered the Wuyue Club and tempered themselves with the Mighty Ones of the physical invulnerability while others fought in professional competitions.</p><p>One of the sects in the Wuyue Club had more than 30 people in the Dan stage, showing its terrifying power. The Shangqing Sect alone probably had more people of the Dan stage than the whole Xing province.</p><p>For the next generation, there were not many disciples and they were all underage.</p><p>“We’re here,” Mo Jingting said briskly, stopping the car outside the gate.</p><p>Nearby was a sea of pine forest, the leaves fluttering in the wind like waves, bringing a cool breeze in the hot summer. The gate was made of huge stones inscribed with the words of Ice God Sect on it, quaint and simple.</p><p>“Let’s first visit the Grand Uncle. You will officially take him as your teacher tomorrow.” Geezer Shi got out of the car slowly.</p><p>“Okay.” Lou Cheng followed after him.</p><p>Mo Yanting unbuckled her seatbelt and leaned out of the window with a smile.</p><p>“Junior Master, let’s add each other on WeChat. We’ll be fellow disciples from now on. Little poor me will be under your care in the future.”</p><p>“I barely use WeChat.” Lou Cheng’s refusal was polite.</p><p>He did register a Wechat account, but since the people around him seldom use it, he could not be bothered either.</p><p>“Okay then.” Mo Jingting pursed her lips, looking a little chagrined. She sat upright and drove the car to the parking area.</p><p>Geezer Shi stood watching them in silence. He tutted and said, “This lying girl is so mischievous. When she was still in the sect, so many seniors lost their minds over her and even quarreled from jealousy. Heh, in the end none of them even manage to touch her hand.”</p><p>“Master Shi, it’s probably not nice to say that?” Lou Cheng said, his mouth twitching.</p><p>He was their elder. How could he say that about the younger generation behind their backs?</p><p>“What’s not nice? If they dare do it, then I can talk about it!” Geezer Shi chuckled. “That little girl has grown so sociable and mischievous after becoming an actress. You shouldn’t let her cheat you. What’s not nice? If they dare do it, then I can talk about it!” Geezer Shi chuckled. “That little girl has grown so sociable and mischievous after becoming an actress. You shouldn’t let her cheat you.”</p><p>“Master Shi, don’t worry. I’m not that kind of guy.” Lou Cheng replied calmly.</p><p>His type was the fairy kind!</p><p>As these words were spoken, a text from an unknown number arrived.</p><p>“Junior Master, this is my phone number. Hope we can take care of each other in the future. Your cute and lovely niece apprentice : -D.”</p><p>Lou Cheng shook his head, finding the girl a little annoying. He then saved the number as Niece Apprentice Mo.</p><p>Geezer Shi said nothing and led Lou Cheng through the hall into the inner chamber. Passing the scouting disciples, they arrived at place with a plaque that read ‘Ice Queen Pavilion’.</p><p>“Have you considered what I’ve said before?” Geezer Shi stopped at the door and asked his question once again.</p><p>“Master, my answer is the same. I want to devote myself entirely to martial arts,” Lou Cheng replied earnestly.</p><p>Once he became stronger, he will definitely receive corresponding advantages and leave the intrigues and power struggles behind!</p><p>Was it not better to live simply and freely?</p><p>“Alright. Let’s go.” Pushing the door open, Geezer Shi led his disciple in.</p><p>An grey- and thin-haired old man sat behind the desk, with sagging cheeks and deep wrinkles around his eyes. He went up to them with a smile. “Jian Guo, this must be Lou Cheng.”</p><p>Jian Guo?</p><p>Shi Jianguo?</p><p>That was his master’s name?</p><p>Lou Cheng wanted to burst out laughing. He calculated his master’s age and decided the name really carried the characteristics of his generation!</p><p>But what it lacked was a feeling of greatness!</p><p>How about Great Master Shi Jianguo?</p><p>Geezer Shi glared at Lou Cheng and said, “Yes, senior. This is my good-for-nothing disciple!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
