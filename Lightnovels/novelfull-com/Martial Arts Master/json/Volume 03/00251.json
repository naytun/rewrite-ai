He knew about these twelve seeded fighters of this youth tournament and saw most of them in the official filmed advertisement. That was why he felt familiar with Zhang Zhutong’s figure.</p><p>Seeded fighters of this tournament were of Professional Seventh or Eighth Pin and a few Professional Ninth Pin martial artists with supernatural ability. The Committee probably didn’t have time to watch every Professional Ninth Pin participant’s match videos to select. Lou Cheng’s latest fight wasn’t good enough to be chosen anyway.</p><p>In other words, a seeded fight needed the Eighth Pin fighting power at the very least, which was way beyond Lou Cheng’s league back to before the summer holiday.</p><p>Well, that was another time. Right now he no longer felt inferior to those seeded fighters.</p><p>Chen Xiaoxiao suddenly realized she had just asked a very wrong question and touched the tender spot upon hearing his answer. She hurried to remedy, “Brother Lou Cheng, next time you will be qualified!”</p><p>“I should be qualified now… ” murmured Lou Cheng to himself. He didn’t seem to mind the young girl’s innocent question and answered with a smile, “I hope so… Let’s loop back to the front gate. We can’t get out here.”</p><p>Without much knowledge of Lou Cheng’s strength, Qi Fang and Ma Xi quickly forgot about the qualification matter for the banquet. They followed Lou Cheng back to the front gate while discussing cheerfully the earlier situation. They headed towards a Nanyun restaurant.</p><p>On the way to the restaurant, Lou Cheng rushed to consult Ming. “Talker, are you there?”</p><p>“Don’t you ask me if I’m here. Say what you gotta say,” joked Cai Zongming.</p><p>“I’m treating my high school classmates and my folks to dinner. What an awkward combination! I have nothing to talk with them at all. What shall I do?” Lou Cheng described his problem.</p><p>Cai Zongming answered with a smirk,</p><p>“Make fun of yourself. That’s your only way out!</p><p>“You are the joint connecting the two parties at the table. Your parents must be interested in your embarrassing moments in school and your classmates can add on some materials, and vice versa.”</p><p>It made sense at first but soon Lou Cheng felt terrified. “Considering my mom’s personality, she will make all my worst moments known. How could I face my classmates after? What kind of advice is this?”</p><p>I haven’t told Ke of all my embarrassing moments!</p><p>Cai Zongming threw back his head and laughed aloud.</p><p>“This is the only thing I can think of for now. Good luck!”</p><p>Lou Cheng gnashed his teeth for a while before moving on to ask Coach Yan for advice. Combining their different opinions, he felt confident in leading the conversation during the meal.</p><p>With a private room reserved in advance, he went straight in after meeting Jiang Fei and Qiu Hailin outside the restaurant. As everyone took a seat, he began his self-deprecation. His talking about their high school days loosened the atmosphere gradually and everyone found comfort at the table.</p><p>Lou Cheng stepped out of the room for the bathroom before hot dishes were served. He saw Cao Lele looking around while washing his hands after.</p><p>“Here!” He waved.</p><p>Cao Lele came over, complaining, “The design has a big problem here. I couldn’t see the sign from that direction.”</p><p>Sharing a table for a long time, Lou Cheng and her were pretty close. Noticing no one was around, she casually asked out of curiosity, “Lou Cheng, I heard you are teaching in Gushan Martial Arts School part-time?”</p><p>According to Fatty Jiang, he’s already reached the Professional Ninth Pin. Must it be pretty good in Xiushan?</p><p>“Yeah. Why?” Lou Cheng smiled, looking puzzled.</p><p>Cao Lele pouted and laughed at herself, “Without supervision, I’ve gained 5 kg in one year away from home studying. I’m pretty much a ball now. So I’m thinking about going to the gym to lose a few pounds.”</p><p>Lou Cheng took a second look at her and noticed his petite neighbor’s round face.</p><p>He withheld his laughter and desire to joke on her weight, answering earnestly, “I’m no expert on fitness but Gushan Martial Arts School has certificated gym coaches.”</p><p>Cao Lele was prepared for his sneer and jeer but to her surprise, Lou Cheng didn’t scoff at all.</p><p>She looked at him, much surprised, and commented with a tinge of emotion, “Lou Cheng, you’ve changed so much in merely one year. I can hardly recall your looks from high school. Our classmates and I are still marking time, seeing a bit more of the world and nothing more.”</p><p>Tall and straight, calm and gentle, confident and charming, Lou Cheng doesn’t look like a freshman at all.</p><p>“Should I say thank you for your kind words?” asked Lou Cheng with a smile.</p><p>“I’m not being kind but stating the truth.” Cao Lele put on a restrained smile. Driven by her curiosity, she added, “Fatty Jiang told me you’ve got a girlfriend? She must be outstanding.”</p><p>So you can be well suited!</p><p>“Yeah.” Thinking about Coach Yan, a bright smile broke on Lou Cheng’s face. His eyes softened.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s content made Cao Lele jealous. She suddenly began to look forward to a romantic relationship. She wanted to have someone whose eyes would shine while talking about her.</p><p>Lou Cheng cut the conversation short and returned to the room after a wave.</p><p>His attitude was a bit distant considering their long table sharing relationship. Lou Cheng did it on purpose for two reasons. First, studying in different cities, they didn’t stay in close contact. They would share a few words in their class’ group chat and she would seek help for her computer on rare occasions. Second, he wanted to limit his relationship with other girls to this level as he was no longer single.</p><p>This Nanyun restaurant was pretty decent, with dishes well adjusted to the Xingsheng people’s taste. Both the guests and the hosts were in the best of pleasure</p><p>as many of Lou Cheng’s embarrassing deeds were dug out, becoming a fun topic for Qiu Hailin, Cao Lele and Qi Yunfei.</p><p>“Thank goodness… Everything is under control… ” Lou Cheng felt fortunate. He walked his parents and three cousins back to the hotel before taking a ride from Tao Xiaofei to Tianshui Hotel.</p><p>The youth tournament’s banquet was still on with lights blazing and guests mingling.</p><p>…</p><p>The next morning, Lou Cheng led his cheering squad to Gaofen’s martial arts stadium after his morning training and introduced everything to them.</p><p>The youth tournament shared a similar setting with the Warrior Sage Challenge Tournament. A central ring was surrounded by nine small rings with big screens showing fights of each ring.</p><p>As Lou Zhisheng and Qi Fang gradually adjusted themselves to the atmosphere, Lou Cheng heard a voice.</p><p>“Sir Lou!”</p><p>Turning around, he saw Wu Ting waving at him while jumping, her two ponytails shaking as if thrilled.</p><p>“What a coincidence!” said Lou Cheng with a smile. He then noticed the Chairman Wei Renjie who had his hair combed back and a few men that he didn’t know. One guy’s qi and blood is close to boiling. His eyes were terrifying.</p><p>“This must be Sun Yixing, the capable ninth pin fighter Master Shu recommended!” Nodded Lou Cheng while thinking.</p><p>This average looking ninth pin fighter enjoyed a great reputation back in his days. He defeated several applicants from nearby cities and earned one number for Liao to use wisely.</p><p>Wu Ting showed a bright smile. “Not a coincidence. I’ve been looking for you.”</p><p>Wu Ting’s voice drew Wei Renjie, Wu Qinggui and Sun Yixing’s attention to Lou Cheng, who at that moment was more like a tour guide with a group of all ages than a fighter.</p><p>“Lou, you are also in?” Wei Renjie didn’t address Lou Cheng by his full name after a few times encounters.</p><p>“Yeah,” answered Lou Cheng calmly with a mild smile, “Have to show my family around first.”</p><p>The two parties separated after a quick chat about the weather. Wei Renjie’s secretary approached with a few sheets of paper. “Chairman, this is Xiushan fighters’ schedule for today.”</p><p>Wei Renjie passed it to Sun Yixing after a brief browse and spoke with a smile, “Sun, all yours.”</p><p>I can’t tell if it is good or not.</p><p>Sun Yixing beamed, “My pleasure!”</p><p>He added, “No professional fighters would come to watch the first three rounds if not for this… ”</p><p>…</p><p>In a dark bedroom, an attractive woman woke up to no one by her side. The other half of the bed was already cold.</p><p>Covered by a dressing gown, she stepped to the window where she saw Zhang Zhutong practicing martial arts in the garden, his upper body bare, muscles twinkling, and sweat dripping down.</p><p>“Can’t even take one day off… ” Complained the pretty lady.</p><p>…</p><p>In a park, Xing Jingjing stood in a dark corner with her eyes closed, performing one move after another.</p><p>…</p><p>In a martial arts club, a youth with a faint scar on his face stood in silence. His body seemed hollow as if he didn’t exist.</p><p>…</p><p>By a pond of withered water lilies, a man with some grey hair grabbed the air and a crayfish flew out of the mud.</p><p>…</p><p>Three days later, a room was beautifully lit by the morning sunlight.</p><p>Lou Cheng took a shower, washing the weariness from his morning exercise. Standing by the window in a black-edged white martial arts suit, he looked down at the martial arts stadium in the shape of a ladybug while fixing buttons on his cuffs.</p><p>The fourth round starts today.</p><p>He turned around as his suit was carefully fixed and picked up his mobile. As he expected, he got one voice message from Yan Zheke in Jiangnan.</p><p>He lifted the phone to his ear and touched the screen with his thumb. Her soft, clear voice sounded just like the very first voice message she sent to Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Lou Cheng! Lou Cheng! Lou Cheng, come on!”</p><p>Her cheering had more fondness and love than in Yanling.</p><p>The corners of Lou Cheng’s mouth moved upwards. Carrying a big smile, he played the message again and again before putting his mobile away and walking out of the room into the bright sunshine with his number plate.</p><p>Swaying in his hand, the number plate bore an elegant decorative design and a simple number,</p><p>18!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
