He was Shen Guitian, one of three elders with physical invulnerability. He seemed to have maintained himself better than Lou Cheng’s master and head of the sect, Grand Uncle. He did not look old at all.</p><p>That sturdy man with black hair and no hint of wrinkles ought to be Senior Yang Xianlong of Lou Cheng’s generation. He was the one with authority within Ice God Sect. With the gradual dwindling of Master He Yi, he was practically the leader of the sect.</p><p>Besides the elders, the only woman who had a seat was most definitely his true senior Shi Yuejian. With her dark eyebrows and large eyes, she looked above average and gentle. Though she was more than 30, but she only looked like 24 or 25. Noticing his stare, her gentle eyes turned towards him. She nodded at him with a smile.</p><p>Among the next generation of disciples, Yang Xianlong’s second disciple Zhu Tai sat in front, on the right. He was 29, a fighter of Fifth Pin. He did not originate from the current martial arts circle. Since he had joined a place like Xing province, where the local martial arts scene was not thriving, he would surely be in endless glory and pursued after. But he now wore a pair of black-rimmed glasses and was silent. A simple glance was enough to see that those glasses were not the prescription type. They seemed more like a veil to cover the windows to his heart.</p><p>Opposite Zhu Tai was the angular-faced Lei Fang. This highly anticipated disciple had ordinary looks, but looked smart and was filled with confidence and vitality, if he walked down the road, he would certainly attract no less attention than many handsome boys. As Lou Cheng observed him, Lei Fang was also looking at him with a conflicted expression.</p><p>Mo Jingting sat next to Lei Fang. From time to time, she would whisper to her junior. She controlled the volume of her voice very well, not at all affecting the atmosphere of the hall.</p><p>After looking around, Lou Cheng had a basic understanding of the situation. The strong ones in the Dan stage or above who could return had already returned. They could be regarded as giving a lot of face to the sect. As for the weaker disciples, there were too many of them. Only ten or so participated as representatives.</p><p>Among the guests in the ceremony, he saw the two people Coach Yan once especially mentioned.</p><p>They were the two proud disciples of Huang Ke, the Gun King. One was 25-year-old Zheng Yu in level-five Dan, the other was 22-year-old Qian Qiyue in level-six Dan. They were a pair of handsome man and beautiful lady who were also observing him with interest.</p><p>Those sent by Dinghai Sect and Hanchi Sect were all fighters in the Dan stage. They were about 30 of them and they looked polite, but distant.</p><p>As for the other guests, Lou Cheng could not recognize any of them. He could only guess that they were representatives from the Faction.</p><p>From the corner of his eye, he observed the people in the hall. He noticed Master He Yi leaving his seat and walking up to the incense table. Master He Yi respectfully bowed at the plaques of the founders of the sect and then stood upright.</p><p>“Bring the Ice Marrow Bead!”</p><p>Ice Marrow Bead? After catching up on relevant knowledge of the sect under the little fairy’s guidance, Lou Cheng became excited. He held his breath.</p><p>This bead was said to be formed from the first founder Yang Chenghui. It was full of mystery and was the safeguarding object of the school.</p><p>Just as the thought crossed his mind, he saw a faint blue light rising slowly and turning the incense case clear, making it look like a cold fantasy.</p><p>He Yi took a clear bead half the size of his fist out of the secret compartment under the statute. The bead seemed to be formed out of condensed pure blue light, creating an illusion of ice and snow.</p><p>Zheng Yu, Qian Qiyue, and the rest stared at the bead without blinking. The bead was not usually kept here, making it a rare sight.</p><p>Yet Lou Cheng was stunned, as the bead had some similarities to the Jindan in his body. But they were not actual resemblances, but rather abstract.</p><p>What was that ice bead exactly?</p><p>He Yi placed the ice bead in the middle of the case. Turning around, he announced the start of the ceremony.</p><p>Lou Cheng cleared his thoughts and followed the orders. He headed into the hall, and walked to the front of the incense case step by step. He stopped when there was a distance of one meter.</p><p>“Thanks to the founders!” Yang Xianlong shouted in a sing-song voice.</p><p>Lou Cheng respectfully did as ordered. First he kowtowed, then he offered three incense sticks on the altar.</p><p>He was rather nervous as he followed the procedure. If he went by how things developed in certain novels, the Jindan in his body might trigger the ice bead and create an illusion that will shock everyone.</p><p>Fortunately, such thing did not happen!</p><p>If something did happen, it showed that his Jindan will interact with the outside world without his control. That would be dangerous!</p><p>“Thanks to the masters!” Yang Xianlong continued “singing”.</p><p>Lou Cheng thought of his master’s hard work and sacrifice to get him the looking-thinking picture from Zhu Rong Force without asking for any returns. Without the slightest resistance in his heart, he kowtowed again.</p><p>“The ceremony is complete! Disciple Lou Cheng, serve the tea!” After finishing, Yang Xianlong returned to his ranks.</p><p>Lou Cheng picked up the cup of tea from the disciple beside him. Carrying the cup with two hands, he handed it to Geezer Shi.</p><p>When the cup of tea entered the range of the dark blue light of the ice bead, the temperature rapidly lowered and a thin layer of ice covered the surface.</p><p>Geezer Shi accepted the cup and took a sip. He grinned.</p><p>“Hurry up and give your greetings to your Grand Uncle.”</p><p>“Nice to meet you, Grand Uncle.” Lou Cheng turned towards He Yi.</p><p>He Yi took out a card that flashed ice crystal colors and gave a slight smile.</p><p>“You’re now the disciple of the 27th generation. In accordance with the rules, you have no title in the door and no subsidies. But with this card, you can get practice-related learning materials and Dan medicine from our sect and Wuyue Club once a month.”</p><p>Sure enough, even the martial arts Faction was advancing with the times. On TV, sects usually used things like token. But in reality, they have upgraded to membership cards. Loud Cheng could not help wanting to laugh, but he suppressed his mirth. He accepted the card and thanked the Grand Master.</p><p>The welcoming process for a new disciple was considered over. He Yi began introducing the other disciples to Lou Cheng. Zheng Yu and Qian Qiyue who was watching the ceremony turned to Lei Fang, looking as if they were waiting for a good show.</p><p>Yet, what surprised them how unexpectedly well-behaved Lei Fang was. The willful and arrogant Lei Fang did not even try to verbally attack Lou Cheng. Rather, it was Mo Jingting who was constantly laughing, as if she was very familiar with Lou Cheng.</p><p>Just as they were wondering what was going on behind the scenes, Geezer Shi coughed twice.</p><p>“Let’s go, you brat.”</p><p>Let’s go? Lou Cheng looked at his master in surprise.</p><p>He had just finished meeting his fellow disciples! Should there not be some kind of ceremonial feast to welcome him?</p><p>“You’ve already worshiped the founders and met your fellow disciples. If you’re not leaving, what are you still doing here?” Geezer Shi did not say anything else. With his hands behind his back, he proudly walked out of the hall.</p><p>The sky outside had already darkened, with gathering grey clouds with cold wind blowing, covering all the features of the summer.</p><p>“This… ” Zheng Yu and Qian Qiyue turned to look at Shi Jianguo. They could feel that, though he had yet to start anything, he had already commanded a certain degree of harmony with the surrounding nature.</p><p>The wind became more ferocious as it poured inside the hall, causing Lou Cheng to shiver. He obeyed his master’s command, as per Couch Yan’s instructions. He turned around and walked out of the hall, catching up to Geezer Shi who was walking slowly.</p><p>Today he would follow his master. Whatever Geezer Shi commanded, that was what he would do. Even if the sky fell, there was a tall mountain that would shield him!</p><p>Shi Yuejian frowned. She helplessly sighed and followed after them.</p><p>Hualala!</p><p>The wind whistled and many white flakes fluttered down. Zheng Yu reached out her hand to take one. It was slightly cold to the touch. She had seen real snowflakes.</p><p>The snowing became heavier and heavier, turning the trees white and covering the earth with in a blanket of snow. The snow piled up at the top of the houses, enveloping the entire Ice God Sect.</p><p>It was early August, the peak of summer. Even if the hillside was cool, it was simply relative to the temperature outside. But at this moment, a storm was brewing here!</p><p>Qian Qiyue stared at the snowflake dumbly, but the coldness on his face and the snow in his palm felt incredibly real.</p><p>He turned towards his senior in surprise and saw the same shock in Zheng Yu’s eyes.</p><p>Not even their master was capable of reaching this level!</p><p>Mo Jingting, Lei Fang, and the others stared motionlessly and shivered involuntarily. They recalled there was once a rumor in the sect that Geezer Shi was once one of the strongest, once approaching taboo levels of strength, but unfortunately…</p><p>Was this his terrifying full strength?</p><p>Lou Cheng inexplicably looked around and wore the same expression of shock. He stepped on the squeaky layer of snow and followed his master and senior out the Faction.</p><p>The vast world was entirely white, how clean!</p><p>He Yi stood there, staring at this scene. He suddenly understood what his junior wanted to tell him.</p><p>It was not that Geezer Shi did not have the ability to compete for power. He simply did not want to and disdained the power struggle!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
