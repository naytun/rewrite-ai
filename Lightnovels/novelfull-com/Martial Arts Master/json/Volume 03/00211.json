A faint but pure will for battle replaced the disappointment and unwillingness, burning in his eyes.</p><p>Sun Jian was approaching towards them. He said with a jibe at himself, only half-jokingly,</p><p>“I always complained you guys together would kill my opportunity to shine in the ring. But right now I wish you two could save me from having to go in the ring… ”</p><p>If they were having a conversation online, he would add a laughing with tears emoji here.</p><p>Lou Cheng was close to a laugh. He tried to talk with due solemnity,</p><p>“Do your best. Enjoy the moves of a true Professional Ninth Pin rival.”</p><p>“Enjoy?” Sun Jian shivered unconsciously. Taking a glance at Zhuo Yanjun who was calm and breathing evenly, he felt like a frog about to challenge a viper.</p><p>A competent Professional Ninth Pin rival in nearly perfect status… What can I do?</p><p>There’s nothing to enjoy. I’m about to be tortured…</p><p>However, how could I find my exact problems without confronting one Professional Ninth Pin rival in person? How could I face my father after graduation?</p><p>He took a deep breath and reached out his right hand to Lin Que.</p><p>The usual coldness had recaptured Lin Que’s face. He lifted his arm and slapped Sun Jian’s right palm.</p><p>As a student of psychology, he knew very well that such an action was a way to cultivate collective consciousness and enhance the group cohesion. He didn’t want to uncover it or exclude himself.</p><p>Sun Jian passed the two teammates and went up the flight of stairs, less nervous than Li Mao but just as anxious.</p><p>The gap between Zhuo Yanjun and him was too big to be narrowed by crying out slogans or burning up enthusiasm.</p><p>Last year when Chen Changhua issued a challenge to Lin Que, he was one of the better Amateur First Pin fighters, feeling great about himself and getting ready for the Professional Ranking Event. In the end, he suffered a bitter rout. After six months of hardcore training, he was finally qualified for the Professional Ninth Pin level at the end of last month. A long-sought dream had come true.</p><p>Named one of the capable ninth pin fighters, Zhuo Yanjun should be of a similar level as Lin Que six months ago if not slightly better. I’ve got the Amateur Third Pin certificate and am probably of the Second Pin at my best, still much weaker than Chen Changhua six months ago. The gap can easily be imagined.</p><p>“Whatever. I’ll just show my style and spirit… ” Sun Jian tried to comfort himself as he got in a starting stance.</p><p>Once the referee called the beginning of the match, he launched a surprise attack as planned instead of moving about, dashing at his rival like a tiger coming down a hill, his back bent and knees straightened.</p><p>Zhuo Yanjun apparently didn’t see this coming, but she was confident and capable, taking one stride forward calmly to block Sun Jian’s footwork. Her right shoulder pulled a sudden strength, throwing her arm out downward like a sword.</p><p>Bam! Sun Jian’s right arm muscles inflated, exerting strength to throw a fierce punch out to block the rival’s slash.</p><p>His knuckles made a sudden sound. Five fingers sprang open with an abrupt explosive force, turning the fist into a claw and biting on Zhuo Yanjun’s forearm in a split second.</p><p>Flower-tearing and Willow-striking Hand!</p><p>Zhuo Yanjun’s arm softened like a noodle and then suddenly shook with great might, tightened up like a sword or an iron stick. Sun Jian’s hand was shaken off.</p><p>She then turned her body sideways, her abs inflating and fascia tugging, pushing her left elbow out rapidly like a dagger.</p><p>That was an infusion of the Fly Fall Punch’s continuation and the Blackwater Sword’s melee piercing, fast and compact.</p><p>Sun Jian had no time to duck or to exert strength from his feet. He struggled to drive his shoulders to swing his arms to block the elbow.</p><p>Bam… He was forced to take one step backward but Zhuo Yanjun went on with more strikes, pushing him into a frantic status. Eventually, her sword hit him right in the chest, almost knocking him out of consciousness.</p><p>“Round Five, Zhuo Yanjun won!”</p><p>“The final result. Dongling Squad wins!”</p><p>The referee’s announcement was welcomed by Zhang Jingye’s silence and the hometown crowd’s restrained claps.</p><p>Phew… Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke both heaved a sigh, rather gloomy.</p><p>The defeat had been predicted and the chance of turning the table was still there. However, a loss is a loss, an upsetting result.</p><p>Seeing a Donglin Television Station reporter approaching, Lou Cheng quickly gathered himself together and turned to ask Yan Zheke, “Do I look alright?”</p><p>“You look great!” Yan Zheke smiled, her eyes beautifully shining. “Good luck!”</p><p>“Yes.” Lou Cheng took off the big white towel from his shoulders and stood up.</p><p>“Hello, Lou Cheng. I’m Zhang Hai, a reporter from Donglin TV. May I ask you a few questions?” The reporter sounded the note of stereotyped fanaticism.</p><p>Lou Cheng didn’t try to conceal his disappointment for the defeat.</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Zhang Hai, a young man in his early 20s, very approachable, put on a smile.</p><p>“Lou Cheng, you guys did great today. I would give you a 9/10.</p><p>“I’ve read your information. This is your first time confronting an eighth pin Dan stage rival in nearly perfect status, isn’t it? What do you feel?”</p><p>Lou Cheng took a moment to reflect on it. “He’s very powerful, suppressing me in every way. However, I think I could have done better.”</p><p>“Ohh? What made you say that?” asked Zhang Hai, seemingly very interested.</p><p>Lou Cheng forced a bitter smile. “I guess I cared too much about it and didn’t have much experience. I was rushing it a lot in the first fight, intending to finish the opponent quickly. I made many mistakes and the emotion went on to the second match. I couldn’t make a better, wiser choice at the critical moment.”</p><p>He didn’t reveal Hou Yue’s supernatural ability and acted as if he didn’t notice it at all to trick Dongling Squad to bet heavily on this in the next round.</p><p>All is fair in war!</p><p>“Understood. You’ve only trained for under a year. It’s perfectly normal that you don’t have enough experience. Take it easy.” Zhang Hai gave some comfort before continuing with his list of questions.</p><p>He stopped politely after a few more questions and turned to Lin Que.</p><p>Lou Cheng took a few steps back, getting closer to Yan Zheke, and asked in a low voice, “Ke, did I do okay?”</p><p>Could anybody tell I was lying? Would Dongling Squad be alarmed?</p><p>Yan Zheke smiled and nodded, showing her dimples. “Very sincere and real.”</p><p>Her limpid eyes rolled as she wiped her smile partially off. “You look like a great liar. Would you lie to me like that?”</p><p>“Err… ” Lou Cheng’s mouth opened slightly, speechless.</p><p>That was very different from what I was expecting!</p><p>Shouldn’t you give me some compliment?</p><p>This deceiving strategy was from you!</p><p>Feels tricked again…</p><p>After a brief thought, he started to find it amusing. “How can my small thoughts ever get away from Coach Yan? I can fool everyone but you!”</p><p>“Hmm… ” Yan Zheke nodded first but soon her pretty face straightened. “You fool everyone but me? Tell me, which girl do you plan to fool?”</p><p>Another trick… Lou Cheng was stunned, afraid of giving an answer.</p><p>Yan Zheke burst into a laugh looking at the stunned Lou Cheng. The gloominess from today’s loss completely faded away.</p><p>The silly Cheng is so adorable!</p><p>On the other side, Zhang Hai had just finished his opening remark in front of Lin Que, about to get on his first question.</p><p>“Lin Que, today you experienced the eighth pin Dan stage rival’s continuous explosions. What do you think?”</p><p>Lin Que holding a white towel to wipe the sweat answered calmly,</p><p>“Very powerful.”</p><p>“A man of few words indeed… ” Zhang Hai kept his smile. “What would you comment on your own performance?”</p><p>“I lost.” Lin Que squeezed two words out of his mouth before leaving for the visiting team locker room.</p><p>“I lost? What kind of answer is this? I was asking for a comment.” Zhang Hai was totally lost.</p><p>Yan Zheke in a distance sighed and lowered her voice to Lou Cheng.</p><p>“In my cousin’s dictionary, a loss means a terrible fight.”</p><p>“A loss means a terrible fight?” Lou Cheng pondered on the line.</p><p>I also hate to lose but I can’t be extreme like Lin Que.</p><p>Different people have different personalities…</p><p>He felt bad for the reporter. He needed an interpreter to complete an interview with Lin Que…</p><p>…</p><p>The trip back was tiring, constantly on the run. The crew arrived at Songcheng University new campus around 9 pm. They ate on the train to save time.</p><p>Seeing weariness on Yan Zheke’s face, Lou Cheng didn’t want to drag her to a lakeside stroll. He held her hand on the pedestrian walkway and slowly walked her to her dorm building.</p><p>Shortly before they arrived, he intended to ask Yan Zheke out tomorrow to go shopping as the award money had sat in his account, ready to pay for a ring.</p><p>In a close relationship as them, a date shouldn’t be a difficult thing to ask. But Lou Cheng was trying hard to make an excuse in hopes of creating a surprise.</p><p>Yan Zheke looked up, a bit shy as she was also thinking about asking Cheng out on a date to shop for a ring as a surprise.</p><p>What should I say if I want to ask him out?</p><p>Her lips pursed, eyes looking into the distance. When she was finally ready to bring it up, she heard Lou Cheng’s voice, “Ke, could you go shopping with me tomorrow? My martial arts shoes are worn out again. I need a new pair or two… ”</p><p>Lou Cheng hadn’t finished his excuse, a beautiful smile already climbed on Yan Zheke’s face, darkening all the street lamps.</p><p>“Okay!”</p><p>“Hmm!” Lou Cheng didn’t know why the girl seemed so pleased but her smile totally moved him.</p><p>… …</p><p>Back in his empty dorm, he realized Zhao Qiang and other roommates would spend the night in Donglin to have a social meetup there tomorrow.</p><p>“Hmm… Only girls can temporarily pull Qiang away from study.” He shook his head with a smile and grabbed a thermos bottle to wash up.</p><p>He heard the sound of the key turning in the lock and saw Cai Zongming walk in.</p><p>“You are back?” Lou Cheng said, shocked by his sudden appearance.</p><p>Cai Zongming answered with a smirk, “Surprise?”</p><p>“Damn your surprise!” Lou Cheng looked behind Ming’s back, puzzled. “Where is Qiang?”</p><p>“In Donglin. They will take the train tomorrow 5 pm.” Cai Zongming sounded as if it was a matter of course.</p><p>“How come you are back early?” Lou Cheng let out a laugh and asked.</p><p>Cai Zongming clicked his tongue. “I have the special training tomorrow morning. Also, I have a girlfriend already. Setting up for them is enough. Why should I stay there and watch the Model Worker show off his love?”</p><p>“Ohh… ” Lou Cheng showed his understanding with a smirk and commented, “Talker, I didn’t think you could stick to the special training!”</p><p>Cai Zongming’s face suddenly turned.</p><p>“Of course! I’m a man who lives up to my words!”</p><p>He switched to an aroused voice,</p><p>“Cheng, I’ll be on the bench next term!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
