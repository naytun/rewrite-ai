Yan Xiaoling carried her luggage and left the registration stand. Following her senior sister, she found her dormitory, No.401, third unit, second block.</p><p>She wore a large white T-shirt with a knot on the lower hem and a pair of hidden heel shoes. Rather than active and outgoing as she often appeared online, she looked quiet as a quail.</p><p>After saying thanks to her senior sister, she opened the half-closed door and found the A room. The moment she entered the room, she saw a black kitten running away.</p><p>She was frightened to jump up. She cried for a moment, then turned around to look outside. She wanted to find where the black cat had gone, but at that moment, she came face to face with a set of eyes hidden behind a pair of glasses.</p><p>She leaned aside and moved her head slightly. Then she looked around the empty living room, but she still couldn’t find the black kitten.</p><p>“Have you seen a cat? A black one, it runs fast.” She asked the roommate in front of her directly.</p><p>She should be my roommate… She thought suspiciously. Because the girl was wearing a pair of round glasses and dressed in dull colors, she looked a little old-fashioned. She also looked as if she was wearing her aunt’s clothes and had left home too quickly.</p><p>“You must be seeing things.” The girl answered her calmly.</p><p>“Probably…” Yan Xiaoling looked for it once more, but still couldn’t find the black kitten. She then laughed embarrassedly, “Hello, I am Yan Xiaoling. From now on, we are roommates!”</p><p>The other girl nodded, “He Zi, the bed beside the window is mine.”</p><p>She pointed to the left side.</p><p>“He Zi (Box) ?” Yan Xiaoling did not understand, so she asked again.</p><p>“You can read the name list on the door.” In addition to her round glasses, her face was also very round.</p><p>“There is a name list on the door?” Yan Xiaoling looked to the other side in bewilderment, then noticed a white paper with black words, “He Zi (He Purple), ah, if I pronounce it quicker, it will sound like He Zi (Box)!”</p><p>“Box is my nickname …” He Zi pushed her glasses and smiled politely. “How do you know that you are a member of A room if you didn’t see the name list?”</p><p>Yan Xiaoling was stunned for a few seconds and answered her in a low voice, “by my intuition …”</p><p>The moment she finished her words, she saw there was a flash of light passing through He Zi’s glasses, as if she recognized delusion.</p><p>But, but my intuition is right!</p><p>Just then, another girl came into the room wearing a suit of red traditional Chinese clothing with white decoration on it unusually. She was pretty and young.</p><p>One girl dresses like an aunt, the other wears traditional Chinese clothing. It is worthy of being called the Academy of Art because everyone is so independent and unique. But they are all good-looking, including me… Yan Xiaoling was lost in her mind until the new Girl made a self-introduction, “Hello, I am Mu Jinnian, I arrived last night.”</p><p>“Hello, hello, I am Yan Xiaoling.” Yan Xiaoling answered her happily. She wanted to shake hands.</p><p>“What should I do? Both of them are taller than me! Even with my hidden heel boots!” She thought sadly.</p><p>After chatting for a while, Yan Xiaoling took out her phone and looked through the forum. She saw many replies.</p><p>“Go to the Martial Arts Club as soon as possible. Do a live feed about Lou Cheng!”</p><p>“Don’t be afraid!”</p><p>“If you dare not to see him, then I will call you Coward Xiaoling!”</p><p>“Do a live feed about visiting the Martial Arts Club, or make a live show about eating sh*t. It depends on you!”</p><p>…</p><p>F*ck, why did I make so many promises? I even said that I would go to the Martial Arts Club and take a photo of Lou Cheng as soon as I reached Songcheng University… Grr, I am so aggrieved, I am so sad… When Yan Xiaoling saw the urgings of Brahman and the other people, she felt a little excited but still had some irresolvable tension in her heart.</p><p>I’m going to see my idol, my idol!</p><p>She looked up and asked her roommates without holding any hope,</p><p>“I want to go to the Martial Arts Club, will you join me?”</p><p>Normal freshmen should have been more concerned with military training…</p><p>However, the moment she finished her words, two answers came in unison,</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Uh … Yan Xiaoling first looked at the girl with the round face, He Zi. Then she turned to see the cool girl, Mu Jinnian. Suddenly, she did not know how to react to them.</p><p>I was just asking to be nice…</p><p>Soon, she recovered from her loss. She would receive courage from her roommates’ accompaniment. She laughed.</p><p>“Ok, let’s go now!”</p><p>As for my luggage, I will clean it up when I get back!</p><p>La La, Lou Cheng, I’m coming!</p><p>…</p><p>Walking through the square, passing the bridge and the teaching area, the three girls finally arrived at the Martial Arts Club.</p><p>Because the school had not officially opened yet, they found several people in the stadium. Only a few people were busy posting slogans on the wall.</p><p>The red slogan with black words filled the arena with a burning passion. All the slogans had the same content, which was setting goals,</p><p>“The National Final Round!”</p><p>The moment Yan Xiaoling saw these four words, she suddenly felt like fuming in anger. She subconsciously moved closer to the people who were posting slogans, suddenly feeling so familiar with the boy who was directing the work.</p><p>“I, I, I know you!” She stammered for a long time and finally cried out excitedly.</p><p>Cai Zongming glanced at the girl who looked like Lolita. He thought suspiciously but smugly, “Maybe I have my own fan? Because of my handsome face?”</p><p>He had no time to answer her. Yan Xiaoling continued, “You are Lou Cheng’s classmate, aren’t you? You did an interview at the tv station together! I have seen the video many times!”</p><p>Cai Zongming covered his face with his hand and said in a half self-mockery and half-joking tone, “I have degenerated to such a level? People only recognize me because I’m Lou Cheng’s classmate?”</p><p>Yan Xiaoling took a few pictures of the martial arts club and updated them in the forum. It took her courage to ask,</p><p>“Where is Lou Cheng?”</p><p>Standing next to her, Mu Jinnian asked, “Where is Lin Que?”</p><p>He Zi was looking around the arena carefully.</p><p>Cai Zongming sighed and with his hands outstretched, he replied, “It isn’t time for them to start the special training officially. They have to find places to temper themselves.”</p><p>“Then why are you still here?” Yan Xiaoling blurted out disappointedly.</p><p>I finally gathered the courage to come here!</p><p>“Why I am here? I have to be here because I am the manager of the martial arts club!” Cai Zongming found this annoying but funny at the same time.</p><p>“You are the club manager?” Yan Xiaoling almost showed the “how can you be the manager” look. Mu Jinnian also doubted his words.</p><p>“What’s the problem? Don’t I look like the club manager?” Cai Zongming was not annoyed for being doubted. He only smiled and said with gnashing teeth, “Yes, I really don’t look like a manager! I agree! The last club manager graduated this year. Normally, the new manager should be selected from the members who were best at martial arts so that he could convince people to follow him. Well, they all said this job was troublesome, so they glanced at it and left without a word… I was also about to refuse it, but the teacher said the school has decided to let me be the manager. As a substitute, I don’t know how I became the manager of the Martial Arts Club?”</p><p>He had learned some sentences modes after being influenced by Comrade, Zhao Qiang.</p><p>“Oh oh oh, it sounds like Lin Que’s style…” Mu Jinnian smiled with her eyebrows bending slightly.</p><p>Oh, she is a fan of Lin Que … Yan Xiaoling lifted her small chest and laughed happily, “Also sounds like Lou Cheng’s style! Haha, well done!”</p><p>She gave him a complimentary expression.</p><p>After chatting for a while, they were much more familiar with Cai Zongming, so Yan Xiaoling gradually showed her true character. Full of expectation, she asked, “When do the martial arts classes begin? Can I register now?”</p><p>“You’re a freshman, aren’t you? There is an official recruit for you after the military training…” As Cai Zongming was finishing his words, he suddenly noticed two familiar people approaching. He raised his hand and greeted them quickly, “Senior Brother Sun, Senior Sister Lin! ”</p><p>Sun Jian laughed: “You are indeed the new club manager. You are so diligent, right? We passed by and found you easily.”</p><p>“I serve for the people!” Cai Zongming pretended to say it seriously which amused everyone. “Senior Brother Sun, Senior Sister Lin, I thought you would be busy writing essays and finding jobs and wouldn’t have time to come to the Martial Arts Club.”</p><p>Relying on his outgoing and talkative character, he had developed good relationships with many members who participated in the special training of the Martial Arts Club.</p><p>Sun Jian paused for a moment. Then he smiled and said, “We have studied in this university for four years, and would like to leave a beautiful end for our school life. The two Dan stage fighters are so powerful and competitive all around the country now. Our club can definitely make more new progress than the last several years. Hehe, Lou Cheng and Lin Que can help us win the glory! That’s the reason why we are here! Fighting for the national final round!”</p><p>“For the national final round!” Cai Zongming took out his hand to touch their fist. There was expectation and hope in his eyes.</p><p>Watching this scene from the side, Yan Xiaoling suddenly hoped that time would pass more quickly so that November could come.</p><p>Oh, it’s a pity that I didn’t get to see Lou Cheng!</p><p>Even after walking out of the martial arts arena, Yan Xiaoling still felt melancholy. On the contrary, He Zi said thoughtfully, “The confrontation between muscle and blood, I really want to write an article about it …”</p><p>“Uh, you can write articles?” Yan Xiaoling looked at her roommate in surprise.</p><p>“I am not only good at writing, but also chatting. After we are familiar with each other, I can chat with you until you’re cried out.” He Zi smiled.</p><p>What a strange roommate she is… Yan Xiaoling rubbed her face and quickly began to think about other things.</p><p>I am so pissed off I didn’t see Lou Cheng!</p><p>…</p><p>“Well done. Practice makes perfect.” Beside the lake, Geezer Shi folded his arms and watched his foolish apprentice practicing the “Zhu Rong Force”.</p><p>Lou Cheng changed his practicing posture. He smiled a bit proudly before making his request,</p><p>“Master, I want to awaken the supernatural ability to the second degree.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
