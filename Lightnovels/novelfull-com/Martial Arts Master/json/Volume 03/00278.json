His entire body seemed like it was a high-speed mack truck. While the platform shook gently, he rushed forward and was in front of Lou Cheng. Twisting his waist and arm to form a Forward Punch, he violently slammed forward.</p><p>This attack looked no different than an ordinary Forward Punch, but there was absolutely no sound while he carried it out. This kind of attack and manner brought a frightening kind of silence, to the point where even the sound of the wind couldn’t be heard.</p><p>With two warriors facing each other, this was quite surreal!</p><p>By understanding the concept of ‘receiving’, Lou Cheng could attack silently by tightening his muscles to offset the inherent explosive sound of the hits. However, he couldn’t do it as well as Han Zhifei. This corresponded with the special strength he had in rotating as well as his ability to undulate and get free.</p><p>Lou Cheng realized this and understood that Han Zhifei acted in this way with a purpose for he showed no fear when he left Lou Cheng with sufficient time to prepare “Severe Warning”, and he must have corresponding countermeasures just like Zhang Zhutong before.</p><p>As for how to counterattack, and how to adapt, Lou Cheng could think of a few possibilities. However, he couldn’t make a precise plan of attack. All he could do was proceed cautiously. Visualizing a Thunder Cloud, he braced all of his arm muscles, stepped forward, swung his shoulder, and with his veins and arteries bulging, threw a Blast Punch.</p><p>At that moment, amongst the crack and their two fists about to exchange blows, Han Zhifei’s martial arts suit suddenly bulged, revealing sharp and clearly defined muscles like those of an ancient hero. As it disappeared amongst the movement and Rest, it caused a stir of sound amongst the people, as it was an interesting turn of events.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The air stirred like a strong gale was taking over, and Han Zhifei’s fist mysteriously changed. There was a strange feeling of nothingness or emptiness as the surrounding airflow began to reverse and coalesce. It was obvious to even the naked eye as a cushion of air was momentarily created.</p><p>With the protection of this cushion, this could be a considered a simplified version of physical invulnerability. I need to break away!</p><p>And with his ’empty’ fists condensing air for future use, it wasn’t just limited to this!</p><p>Whoosh! The two collided and the air cushion cracked. Han Zhifei pulled back, and without the slightest warning flicked his wrist, rising above Lou Cheng’s own fist.</p><p>Han Zhifei’s five fingers opened, exposing blackish blue veins as he grasped for his opponent’s wrist.</p><p>Lou Cheng remained calm as he stretched his muscles, the sound of thunder echoed through his mind.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Han Zhifei’s muscles bulged and shook from the attack while his fingers and wrist trembled.</p><p>Shaking his shoulders loose, Lou Cheng’s right hand traced a splendid arc and headed for his opponent’s opposing wrist.</p><p>Big or Small Hand Wrap!</p><p>Han Zhifei’s expression twitched slightly. He abruptly sucked in air and his body became a vacuum, consisting only of his right arm.</p><p>Lou Cheng pressed down with all of his fingers, but it was if he was grasping air. All he could feel was the emptiness inside him. Like a fish, he wriggled free and slipped away with ease and began to recover his power.</p><p>How could it be this simple! Lou Cheng focused his eyes, threw his elbow joint out with a sharp crack, and twisted his own arm free. Accelerating like electricity, his palm and fingers formed together to become like a sword, stabbing towards Han Zhifei’s right wrist.</p><p>This wasn’t any kind of special style, but rather, he was simply utilizing his elbow muscles to throw out two hits!</p><p>It wasn’t possible to maintain a vacuum state for long. Han Zhifei didn’t dare lower his guard while straightening his waist. He hurriedly threw his right shoulder backwards and quickly pulled his arm to hide from Lou Cheng ‘s pointed ‘sword’. At the same time, he tensed up his muscles and threw out his left arm in an attempt to hit his opponent.</p><p>Simultaneous retreat and offense!</p><p>Lou Cheng followed his right hand closely. This was the moment he’d been waiting for to create a strong chain of attacks.</p><p>As expected, when Han Zhifei threw out his left fist, it was hindered by the injury to his ribs. The movement wasn’t sufficiently smooth, and there was a split second of sluggishness!</p><p>In that split second, Lou Chen’s Qi and Blood came surging back. Using his spirit to hold onto his lower muscles, he stood in a Human Body Big Dan.</p><p>Due to Han Zhifei’s experience, he knew that Lou Cheng was seizing the moment to take advantage of his mistake. Han Zhifei abruptly stopped his movement and followed up with “Force Concentration”.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>When everything was condensed to such an extreme point, the backlash would also be extreme. Lou Cheng’s body expanded a few centimeters. With his energy bursting, he stepped forward and swung his left arm with a Forward Punch so explosive that it seemed to tear through the air and leave a trace.</p><p>Now that everyone knows from my last match that my bodies consumption rate is too big, and after a half hour’s time I’ll be unable to recover completely, I might as well go with it. I’ll open up my Qi for a frantic attack. Something that’ll really wow them.</p><p>In that case, I’ll first arrange that “small objective”, and achieve three consecutive explosions!</p><p>Han Zhifei was too slow by a beat. In the face of his enemies’ aggressive assault, there was only time to for him to allow the Dan stage to reach his arms, crossing them in front of his body.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At the impact point, there was a wafting of air. Though Han Zhifei remained standing, solid as a rock, Lou Cheng wound back up, wriggled his muscles, with an echo resounding inside his body, he once again consolidated his Dantian so that he wouldn’t in the least let up his full bodies strength.</p><p>Lou Cheng took a small step forward and leaned his body downwards like before. After his right arm swelled up to an astonishing degree, he abruptly formed a fist and slammed down. While performing this stance, it was as if he’d somehow grown, and it seemed as if he’d slam his opponent’s lower body directly into the arena.</p><p>Brutal Blizzard Double Explosions!</p><p>Han Zhifei simply didn’t have enough time to evade. He could only once again do Force Concentration and raised his arms up to block.</p><p>As Lou Cheng’s fist hit, Han Zhifei pulled back, losing a large part of his power. After flipping and pausing, he abruptly blocked.</p><p>Bang! Lou Cheng’s body shook again, but he quickly recomposed his balance. His spirit, Qi, Blood, and movements were all focused together. As Han Zhifei blocked, he bounced back, sliding back a step, quickly gaining some distance.</p><p>Bang! Lou Cheng’s internal strength surged forth. He put his waist forward and tensed his thighs. With almost no rest time, his right foot thrust out. As it went through the air it seemed like a phantom filling the blank space that his opponent had created a moment ago, landing in front of his opponent like an avalanche.</p><p>As Han Zhifei fell back, he lost his balance again and used Force Concentration, making his entire body an empty vacuum. Then, with his temples pulsating, his leg flew out, kicking Lou Cheng’s foot.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Cracks exploded on the sides of their shoes, and the pieces fell to the ground like butterflies. Han Zhifei had learned a lesson from Zhang Zhutong, making sure to break away from Lou Cheng’s fast and violent “24 Blizzard Strikes” in advance. He launched into his stanch, coiling into a pillar and striking.</p><p>Lou Cheng had tentatively arrived at his objective. He had applied pressure to Han Zhifei and now held the upper hand by cutting down on his dissipation.</p><p>Actually, just then, at most he could have done four strikes. Five strokes would have completely emptied him regardless of whether he relied on the Jindan, so his plan was always to aim for three strikes. This way, by taking it nice and easy, he could throw in a few Tremor Punches and still be able to throw two consecutive strikes.</p><p>His current tactic was to make Han Zhifei believe Lou Cheng failed in his attack. When he was near the end of his rope, he would use an attack that didn’t take a lot of energy like the Tremor Punch and he could piece together his opponent’s dissipation!</p><p>This was similar to the fight with Zhang Zhutong, but that time he had done his utmost to avoid this aspect of it.</p><p>His choices changed as he faced different opponents. The previous “Smelter Force” was a minimal burden to his body, yet the overlaying power was quite scary. The longer he fought, the more Lou Cheng was at a disadvantage. Han Zhifei was someone who had fought many battles. The power consumption of his “Phantom Fist” was probably equivalent to that of the Frost Force, so he figured that he had much more physical strength than him!</p><p>As for the “Phantom Fist” changing and becoming a hidden attack, Lou Cheng figured that the Tremor Punch could handle it. Just a moment ago when they made contact, it had immediately “detonated” his muscles and caused him to shake and break up the invisible move.</p><p>Even though this would reduce how much of a shock Han Zhifei would receive, it was dependable, and all that he could do.</p><p>Bang bang bang! Crash crash crash! Lou Cheng firmly carried out his plan and responded to Han Zhifei’s assault with unending Tremor Punch’s regardless of whether he was or wasn’t using the “Phantom Punch” move.</p><p>In the course of this, he could not defend himself since he had so few opponents that were as strong as him, he had grown somewhat complacent!</p><p>As long as he seized the advantage, Lou Cheng could immediately counter-attack, suppress his opponent, and then respond with steady defense. Ordinarily, Han Zhifei would not give him too many opportunities, but today his left rib had an injury. It was obvious through the holes of his clothes, and when it was revealed from time to time, it could be attacked.</p><p>With fists and feet flying, the two men hit with abnormal intensity. Staring from the packed spectator’s lounge, Yan Zheke’s heart was in her throat as she waited anxiously for the victory to become clear.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s body had an injury. There was still the influence of the ‘Smelter’ in his muscles and veins. The more he hit, the more painful and harder to bear it was. His punching strength was also influenced the more he fought. In contrast to the beginning, in this kind of state, in front of Han Zhifei, he simply wouldn’t be able to last more than 10 moves. Fortunately, today Han Zhifei also seemed exhausted and hadn’t been able to take advantage of the several times he’d shown weakness.</p><p>Another spell of fighting passed. Even though Han Zhifei didn’t perceive anything definite, through relying on his original street smarts and bloodthirst, as well as his rich fighting experience, he could sense that something wasn’t right.</p><p>Under this kind of attack, it looked as if his opponent, who was on the verge of collapse, was afraid that he also wouldn’t collapse. At that time, his physical strength declined down to a thread, to a point where it was truly dangerous!</p><p>He couldn’t let him pull him down! Han Zhifei narrowed his eyes and made a decision. At once, he revealed the hole in his clothing, showing the weak and injured left rib.</p><p>Lou Cheng made his move and slid forward. His left hand lifted to protect his body and his right arm waved, his fist shooting forth, exploding towards his opponent’s left rib.</p><p>Han Zhife had a grave expression. Unexpectedly, he hadn’t gone to take care of his opponent’s violent attack. He abruptly drew in a breath of air, made his body an empty vacuum, and again did Force Concentration!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>As Lou Cheng punched, he felt as is Han Zhifei’s bones had contracted, his muscles had caved in, and he’d created a stiff ’empty cavern’ in its place. It was dangerous to do this in order to avoid the explosive burst.</p><p>No good! He straightened his body and spread his legs apart, but he discovered that the ‘Empty Cavern’ had reduced his spirit, Qi, and blood, and it was exerting some kind of mysterious force on his physical body, making it so that he was leaning forward against his own will.</p><p>Not good!</p><p>A similar thought once again flashed through his mind, and Lou Cheng didn’t hesitate. He summoned his willpower, dipped his body, and caused his Qi and Blood to flow back, using it to correspond with his spirit and physical strength, allowing him to stand firmly and withdraw his fist.</p><p>Coming to this situation, he was unable to consider doing a few more Dan Stage explosions!</p><p>Just as Lou Cheng finished his Force Concentration, Han Zhifei threw out his left fist. His muscles momentarily burst through his martial arts suit and once became strong and defined as ancient warriors. They moved and came into friction with the air, creating a sound just like a long dragon’s roar!</p><p>Lou Cheng’s eyes widened his Qi and Blood instinctively agitated. His Dan Stage power surged forth and he lifted up both of his hands to obstruct his opponent’s fists.</p><p>Whoosh! He felt like he’d been hit by a strong steam of water, canceling out his own block, which was in strange contrast to the appearance that the punch had seemed to have taken on.</p><p>A split second after, the softness turned hard as a great power and intensity arrived.</p><p>The Phantom Punch Technique, Joining Strength and Gentleness!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lou Cheng was pressed back two steps by this forcible punch. He left behind two crack-filled footprints as he stomped down and lost his balance!</p><p>He had no choice, he could only do “Two Consecutive Strikes”. It was a firm and dependable stance, but a vague thought.</p><p>Han Zhifei saw that victory was near. Without hesitation, he once again used “Force Concentration”, swelled up his body, and slammed into him with his side!</p><p>Bang! Lou Cheng blocked the hit with some difficulty, but the stance of his two hands was loosened, creating an opening to his stomach and lower abdomen.</p><p>It seemed as if his response had also become sluggish. He was so tired he felt like he could collapse right there on the spot.</p><p>Han Zhifei’s body was also exhausted. He couldn’t finish three consecutive strikes, but he couldn’t let himself miss this opportunity. Gritting his teeth, he wriggled his muscles, stomped forward, threw out his left arm with an explosion and Phantom Fist!</p><p>Burning himself dry wasn’t too bad!</p><p>At this moment, there would be a victory!</p><p>As everyone watched the situation change, they all continuously held their breath, perhaps out of anticipation, or perhaps due to saying a prayer.</p><p>There was no time to block, so Lou Cheng did something that he had thought over for a long time but had never actually used in battle.</p><p>If you’ve been run ragged, how would you temporarily raise your spirits?</p><p>First, you could splash some cold water on your face to wake yourself up. This was perhaps seen as the most common reply.</p><p>So Lou Cheng worked into the Power of Frost, making a cold current condense and rush up into his mind, floating past his face and out to the surface!</p><p>If agitated by approximately zero degree temperatures, the body’s protective mechanisms would start up. Hormones started to secrete. He suddenly felt clear-headed and his train of thought was if it had been restored back to normal!</p><p>Was this just a “method” of drawing out his own body’s potential?</p><p>Lou Cheng seized this short moment to stir up his spirits. He lowered his waist down to his thigh, congealed his blood into its own power, and stretched his muscles. Observing to the side, the referee raised his eyebrows.</p><p>Whoosh! Han Zhifei hit the center of Lou Cheng’s stomach but it was as if he’d hit a rotten piece of wood. The power of Lou Cheng’s Qi and Blood rushed forth. His muscles expanded and he rushed forth with a mad attack, making a frightening vibration.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Han Zhifei’s body bounced. His Qi and Blood boiled over, while in his mind there was a spell of dizziness. Relying on his instinct and Chinese boxing techniques, Lou Cheng straightened his arm and stabbed towards his opponent’s throat with his fist like a sword.</p><p>Afterwards, he himself felt that this attack would be blocked.</p><p>At this very moment, Lou Cheng’s spirit was extremely drained, and he simply wasn’t able to consider what kind of situation he was in. In front of his eyes was darkness, and he was dizzy to the point where he couldn’t quite see the top of the arena.</p><p>The referee reached out his hand for support, covered his hand with his palm, raised his right hand and announced clearly,</p><p>“Final round, Lou Cheng wins!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
