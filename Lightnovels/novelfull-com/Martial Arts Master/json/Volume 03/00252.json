While he was still far from the Professional Ninth Pin level, amateur fights, except for those like Dai Linfeng and Zhou Zhengyao, were no longer a match in front of his outstanding body gift. He scored an easy victory over an Amateur Second Pin fight in Round One and, followed by another bloodless win over an Amateur Third Pin. In the third round, he encountered a powerful rival and won by a narrow margin, advancing to Round Four with two other members of Gushan Martial Arts School. Even chairman Wei Renjie and the leading fighter Sun Yixing praised him in person.</p><p><em>A merry heart makes a cheerful countenance.</em> He felt much more confident, full of gratitude for Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Yeah. Come with us. The shuttle bus is very convenient!” added Xu Rongfei joyfully.</p><p>The other two members who had made their way into the fourth round were Dai Linfeng and him. He was lucky to encounter three comparably weak opponents but it was also thanks to Lou Cheng’s instructions. Members who had taken a private session with Lou Cheng all achieved a better result than their expectation. Genuine knowledge comes from practice. Now they held sincere admiration for this quiet young martial artist and the money in their pocket was ready to be made use.</p><p>Glancing across them, Lou Cheng answered leisurely,</p><p>“Thanks but no need. I’ll run over to warm up my body.”</p><p>He waved and ran through the lobby out of the hotel, then followed the road towards the stadium with the constant rhythm of his steps.</p><p>Watching him from behind, Xu Rongfei commented with a tinge of emotion,</p><p>“Brother Lou is more and more like a real master… He can probably make it to the top 16 this time… ”</p><p>In his point of view, Lou Cheng was pretty much invincible among all the fights of Professional Eighth Pin or lower. He should have a good chance taking a seat in the top 16 unless something really odd happened.</p><p>Qin Rui agreed. “I think he can easily make it unless he gets a super bad draw and encounters one of the twelve seeded fights early. Ha-hah. Soon we can see Cheng in Apotheosis of Fighters.”</p><p>The main point of being qualified as a seeded fight was to enjoy the privilege in the drawing which protected them from encountering other seeded players before the final stage of the top 32 fights.</p><p>Behind them, Chu Weicai shook his head slightly and muttered to himself with a restrained smile,</p><p>“Top 16?”</p><p>“Hey… ”</p><p>…</p><p>As soon as Lou Cheng entered the martial arts stadium of Gaofen, he went straight to the big screen to check today’s match table.</p><p>He spotted his name sharply after a few minutes’ wait.</p><p>“Ring 6, Round 4. No. 18 Lou Cheng, 19 years old of Professional Ninth Pin v.s. No. 29 Xiong Yu, 21 years old of Professional Ninth Pin.”</p><p>“How lucky… ” Lou Cheng clicked his tongue.</p><p>There were very few fierce matches between two Professional Ninth Pin fighters in this round. And he got one.</p><p>He looked closer and noticed the fight between Xiong Yu and him was not in the broadcast program as there would be another focal match taking place in the central ring at the very same time between the No. 1 seed Zhang Zhutong and another Professional Ninth Pin fighter.</p><p>Lou Cheng lowered his head, his fingers typing fast to report the news to Ke with her favorite pitiful emoji.</p><p>“Without Coach Yan’s blessing, my first rival is a Professional Ninth Pin fighter!”</p><p>“Ha-hah!” Yan Zheke had no intention to hide her pride. “Wait for me to come back with bliss!”</p><p>She continued with an emoji, a hand stroking his chin and eyeballs rolling. “That Xiong Yu has very bad luck… ”</p><p>Confronting Cheng who has just agglomerated his martial arts will and achieved the core force of the Ice Sect is pretty much the same with challenging a seeded fighter!</p><p>“We can’t underestimate our rival!” answered Lou Cheng seriously.</p><p><em>So hard for me to earn some sympathy…</em></p><p>“Hmm. Let me search for his information for you.” Yan Zheke tied her hair up and quickly started to gather his information.</p><p>The information of a Professional Ninth Pin fighter from a certain province must be available online. Instead of going to the service desk for his rival’s information, Lou Cheng went to Ring Six. While waiting for Coach Yan’s reply, he tested his parents and Jiang Fei about his match.</p><p>…</p><p>“No. 18 Lou Cheng… ” Before the big screen, Xiong Yu murmured quietly this strange name.</p><p>Slim and small at the first sight, his body was actually thick and solid like a mountain. His round face and the close-set cast of her features were rather amusing. A member of Gaofen’s Jianxian Hall, Xiong Yu had been training in the local Zhenshan Martial Arts Club, well known for his consummate Xuji Divine Penetrating Fist.</p><p>“Never heard about it. Must be from another city. We should do some research,” said Xiong Yu’s companion, a fine lady with thin brows. Dressed like an office lady, her imposing and mighty qi and blood well lit her face up.</p><p>They were surrounded by a few reserve fighters of Jianxian Hall who immediately took their mobile out to search on the internet upon hearing Sister Ying’s command.</p><p>As the juniors were helping gather information on his rival, Xiong Yu spoke to Sister Ying with a smile, “Sister Ying, your match is in the afternoon?”</p><p>He held great respect for Han Ying, the younger sister of Han Zhifei, a 25-year-old martial artist of the Professional Seventh Pin, one of the vice masters of Jianxian Hall, and the No. 2 seed in this youth tournament.</p><p>“Yes, against an Amateur First Pin fighter,” answered Han Ying carelessly.</p><p>“Brother Zhifei’s rival is also of Amateur First Pin,” said Xiong Yu uncertainly.</p><p>Contestants who had registered for this kind of tournament would rarely quit in front of a powerful opponent. They might have no chance in winning but the experience of confronting a Professional Seventh Pin fighter in the Dan stage itself would become something they could brag about after. It wouldn’t be worth mentioning how many bouts he made to others.</p><p>While the pair chatted away, those reserve fighters turned grave. One of them blurted out, “Sister Ying, Brother Xiong, this Lou Cheng… Seems no easy target.”</p><p>He tried hard to not sound negative.</p><p>“No easy target?” Xiong Yu took over his mobile with a frown and began to read. Han Ying pressed her head over.</p><p>The two stopped to exchange a glance, seeing astonishment in each other’s eyes.</p><p>It’s not “not easy”!</p><p>It’s hard! It’s impossible!</p><p>When did Xingsheng get this 19-year-old top Professional Ninth Pin fighter? With supernatural abilities of fire and ice! A master of Tremor Punch and one of the core forces of the Ice Sect!</p><p>“Xiong, how lucky you must be… ” Han Ying heaved a sigh before forcing a bitter smile on her face.</p><p>Xiong Yu roared, “His certificate was from Songcheng. Bloody hell! Why is he back here for the youth tournament?”</p><p>He took a few deep breaths after the complaint and then continued,</p><p>“Perfect! How can I arouse my potential without a worthy rival!</p><p>“He has Tremor Punch and the core force of the Ice Sect. So what? It’s useless if he can’t hit me!”</p><p>We are both of the Professional Ninth Pin. How big a gap can we have?</p><p>How do I know I can’t win without a fight?</p><p>I’m a capable Professional Ninth Pin fighter!</p><p>…</p><p>Lou Zhisheng and Qi Fang led Chen Xiaoxiao and Jiang Fei towards the stand near Ring Six, passing by the central ring surrounded by numerous media.</p><p>Sitting in two rows, the young, used to looking for answers online, took out their mobile at once to search about Lou Cheng’s rival Xiong Yu.</p><p>“Sounds pretty powerful!” Cao Lele blurted out after a moment of reading.</p><p>With little knowledge in martial arts, she was shocked by the match video of two capable Professional Ninth Pin fighters. Unconsciously, she began to worry about Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Powerful?” Qi Fang’s ears were sharp, her heart in suspense as she asked.</p><p>My poor son gets a joker for his first match?</p><p>He would be so upset if knocked out in the first match…</p><p>“Yeah, quite strong… ” Qiu Hailin drew in a long breath quietly after watching a few videos.</p><p>Her big forehead was still bare.</p><p>In response to their shock and fear, Tao Xiaofei said with disdain, “That’s nothing. Search for Brother Lou’s videos to watch. Way better!”</p><p>Much ado about nothing!</p><p>“That’s right. He’s nothing comparing to Brother Lou Cheng!” said Qi Yunfei and Chen Xiaoxiao in unison.</p><p>“Seriously?” Qiu Hailin and Cao Lele exchanged a look, realizing they had been missing some really important stuff.</p><p>Although on the cellular data connection, they searched again. They could hardly believe the awe-inspiring fighter was the humble, polite, and smiling Lou Cheng, the lights coming up in their eyes.</p><p>How did he become so strong in such a short time?</p><p>Can’t tell at all!</p><p>“Ha! This is Cheng?” Qi Fang craned her neck to look at Cao Lele’s mobile. “I can hardly recognize this is my son.”</p><p>In current trending words: My son is such a fresh meat!</p><p>Jiang Fei burst into a laugh and then lowered his voice to Cheng Qili. “Cheng, do you think his mom could recognize him after this fight?”</p><p>Cheng Qili ignored the joke, focusing on Qiu Hailin and Cao Lele’s expression changing with a worried look on his face. He was not afraid but suddenly felt inferior before Lou Cheng.</p><p>Contradistinction hurts!</p><p>Listening to their discussion in silence, Lou Zhisheng came to realize one thing while glancing at the video:</p><p>Fattie Guo called yesterday to inform them the award money would stay unchanged…</p><p>…</p><p>A Little Fairy had just made a post in the forum of Lou Cheng’s fans.</p><p>The 3rd Youth Championship Tournament of Xingsheng, Round 4, Lou Cheng v.s. Xiong Yu (Professional Ninth Pin)!</p><p>Unparalleled Dragon King commented at once with the pushing sunglasses emoji, “I knew Lou Cheng would attend this tournament!”</p><p>“Ahh… My heart of a young lady is thirsty like hell!” Yan Xiaoling the Eternal Nightfall opened the youth tournament’s official website to look for a live streaming link, feeling in heaven.</p><p>No fight for over two months. The quiet forum became quieter with only five or six active users. Of course, Brahman of determination and a strong will in her summer holiday was one of them. Her comment showed up after a dozen seconds. “Name yourself! How do you know our idol is in this tournament?”</p><p>A Little Fairy gave an irrelevant reply,</p><p>“I take up the cudgels for others!”</p><p>In front of the computer, Yan Zheke was smiling, propped on her elbow. She changed an ID on purpose so no one could find out she was Lou Cheng’s girlfriend.</p><p>Before Brahman could throw another question, Eternal Nightfall lashed about and wailed, “No broadcast! No broadcast! I’m gonna die!”</p><p>Lying in bed, Yan Xiaoling sobbed. She pulled out one thing to comfort her wounded soul.</p><p>A letter of admission with the key word:</p><p>Screenwriting and Directing in Academy of Art, Songcheng University!</p><p>…</p><p>Watching the two young girls lashing about and wailing, Yan Zheke sneered, very pleased with herself. “You can’t watch it live but I can. I’m prepared!”</p><p>She first replied Lou Cheng’s message, analyzing Xiong Yu’s style and features. Then she opened the group chat Gallantry and Justice of her best girlfriends and tagged Gu Shuang, “Shuang! Shuang! Are you there yet?”</p><p>Gu Shuang was the very first friend she mentioned to Lou Cheng. She dated a terrible man who lived off her money while secretly seeing another girl and attempted to attack her when she went for an explanation but only to be beaten up by Yan Zheke.</p><p>Sitting next to Xing Jingjing on an upper-level stand, Gu Shuang glanced at the big screen from time to time and chatted with her best friend. She smiled upon receiving the message and replied, “I’m here already. Ke, Ke, give some patience, would you? The first round hasn’t started yet. He-heh. Another girl in love… What happened to your coolness and elegance?”</p><p>“Hmm? I was never cool or elegant!” Yan Zheke sat upright.</p><p>“You had already been cool and elegant in my mind! You appear to be polite, smiling, approachable and easy going but in fact, you accept very few as your friends. Right, little fairy?” Gu Shuang teased her with the name from Lou Cheng. Ever since Yan Zheke shared some of her love stories with her besties, they often poked fun at her.</p><p>Gu Shuang adored Yan Zheke for this. She wouldn’t feel as special if the little fairy did have tons of best friends.</p><p>Yan Zheke flushed, ignoring the appellation little fairy. She reminded her, “You have promised you will broadcast it for me!”</p><p>Broadcast with her mobile camera!</p><p>“I remember that. Too early,” answered Gu Shuang carelessly.</p><p>Of the same height with Yan Zheke, she wore a little black dress and maroon-colored shoulder-length wavy hair. Her delicately featured face bore a suggestion of makeup, sending a faint seductive charm which was beyond her age, resembling a mature lady after a few years in office.</p><p>Xing Jingjing took a brief look at her and sighed.</p><p>Ever since her hurtful first love, this wealthy bestie lost her faith in love and became a player circulating among boys and men, enjoying their love and attention without giving back and holding a tentative relationship with one or another, playing in the field or being a playgirl in her own words.</p><p>Men can play. So can women!</p><p>…</p><p>Seeking sympathy from Yan Zheke through messages, Lou Cheng actually had zero contempt in Xiong Yu. “Shipwreck in a Ditch takes place everywhere every day. He would lose so much face if he lost against great odds.”</p><p>A lesson he had learned from the past was it’s okay to feel content but never get about himself!</p><p>After reading Yan Zheke’s analysis and watching the videos she sent carefully, Lou Cheng developed a rough idea of what to expect from the coming battle. The first two matches respectively between a Professional Ninth Pin fighter and an Amateur Second Pin and an Amateur First Pin had finished quickly and the third fight was about to start.</p><p>Lou Cheng put away his phone and fixed the cuffs and legs of his martial arts suit before heading to Ring Six leisurely. As he had expected, he saw Xiong Yu there, to whom he nodded a greeting.</p><p>Xiong Yu and Han Ying also recognized Lou Cheng from those impressive combat videos. Mild and reserved, flat and self-effacing, he looked like a spectator more than a fighter.</p><p>Their facial expression changed as it was very different from what they had learned about Lou Cheng, a sharp and fierce martial artist very close to the peak of the body refining stage.</p><p>Is he stagnating or has he already gone beyond their imagination?</p><p>If Lou Cheng has already touched the threshold of the Dan stage, considering his previous performance, he would be a great sleeper in this youth tournament.</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled at their reaction and moved his eyes to the fight between two Amateur First Pin fighters in the ring.</p><p>Ha, no fighter is stupid. They’ve watched my previous combat videos and realized my shocking progress!</p><p>“However, my progress will be much greater than you could ever imagine.” Lou Cheng let his thoughts go wild while chatting with Yan Zheke on the phone.</p><p>The third match ended in ten minutes. The referee shouted after a quick break,</p><p>“Match Four, Lou Cheng v.s. Xiong Yu!”</p><p>…</p><p>Wu Ting had been watching the big screen for Ring Six. As soon as she saw Lou Cheng, she said to Wu Qinggui next to her, “Dad, I’m going to watch my coach’s fight!”</p><p>I’ll cheer for him by the ring!</p><p>“Don’t run about!” said Wu Qinggui naturally.</p><p>“I won’t,” promised Wu Ting while shaking her father’s arm like a spoiled child, “Just over there by Ring Six. Come to find me later.”</p><p>Wu Qinggui wanted to follow his daughter over but sent his bodyguard instead seeing Wei Renjie focusing on Sun Yixing’s match.</p><p>Wu Ting ran to Ring Six in her flipflops after a cheer. She shouted loudly with her hands around her mouth,</p><p>“Coach Lou, fighting!”</p><p>Facing Xiong Yu and waiting for the conversation time, Lou Cheng turned his head and smiled upon hearing her voice.</p><p>I’m afraid Zhang Qiufan didn’t make it… Only Wu Ting is here…</p><p>Wu Ting wrote a message in a group chat on her phone after:</p><p>“Hurry! All posts! Rally! Coach Lou’s match is about to kick off!”</p><p>…</p><p>Gu Shuang dragged Xing Jingjing to the ring and found a good spot for filming. Instead of beginning her broadcast straightaway, she chatted more, “Ke, Ke! Your man looks pretty handsome right now, ignoring his face of course.”</p><p>“Damn! Who is my man? Can you talk properly?” cursed Yan Zheke silently before urging her, “How can you talk at such a critical moment? Hurry! Broadcast!”</p><p>“No rush. The conversation time is not worth it,” answered Gu Shuang carelessly. “I’ll start to broadcast when the actual fight begins. Let’s do a small interview first. Ke, Ke, how do you feel right now? Excited?”</p><p>She couldn’t resist teasing the little fairy more.</p><p>Yan Zheke sent a sniggering emoji,</p><p>“How do I feel?</p><p>“I want to strangle you!”</p><p>She learned it from Lou Cheng and Cai Zongming’s conversation. A word and a blow.</p><p>…</p><p>Standing before Lou Cheng, Xiong Yu quickly deliberated his strategy.</p><p>While everyone thinks I will make it a skirmish fight to avoid his Tremor Punch and the core force of the Ice Sect, I will launch a surprise, deadly offensive from the very beginning.</p><p>To make it work, I must strengthen his thought about my skirmish fight.</p><p>“Talk time starts,” announced the referee.</p><p>Xiong Yu began at once sincerely,</p><p>“I’ve watched your combat videos. How unlucky I am! I thought I could conquer a few weak opponents like a big fish eating the small but I got you, a shark!”</p><p>“Interesting!” Lou Cheng slowly adjusted his body condition and responded with a smile. “Fights are mobile. Victories against overwhelming odds</p><p>do happen.”</p><p>Strength is the key to victory but not the only key.</p><p>Xiong Yu continued with his plan after a sigh, “I envy you for your Tremor Punch and the core force of the Ice Sect. One of the two would be enough for me to become superior to all Professional Ninth Pin martial artists in Gaofen but those seeded fighters.”</p><p>He emphasized on his envy and fear for Lou Cheng’s Tremor Punch and the core force of the Ice Sect to mislead the rival that he wouldn’t dare meet strength with strength.</p><p>The referee raised his right hand in the nagging whining and announced loudly,</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>On the stand, Lou Zhisheng and Cao Lele suddenly straightened their body, locking their eyes on the match. Gu Shuang rushed to open her video camera to begin the broadcast whereas Wu Ting showed a frown of displeasure for her buddies late for the fight.</p><p>Xiong Yu immediately shook off his fear upon the referee’s call. He stamped his foot and dashed into Lou Cheng rapidly as if the floor had shrunk. A low roar echoed in his body which steadily grew into a mountain shattering shriek, driving his right arm to launch a punch.</p><p>Xuji Divine Penetrating Fist!</p><p>The rival’s punch was at his face in one blink. Lou Cheng remained calm, his abs plucking up, pulling his tendons from both sides. His right hand reached out with five fingers wide open towards Xiong Yu’s wrist, piercing through the wind.</p><p>Xiong Yu’s back suddenly sprang and his right arm tightened, his punch turning into a drag, throwing a low kick with his left foot at Lou Cheng’s ankle. Fast, accurate and fierce!</p><p>The punch was a distracting trick and this kick is the essence!</p><p>A deadly move of the Xuji Divine Penetrating Fist, Earthdragon Turn.</p><p>His kick was still in the air when Lou Cheng’s ankle began to feel dumb. He shifted his weight and withdrew his move, sliding sideways like a ghost.</p><p>Fake Dan stage, Absolute Reaction!</p><p>Lou Cheng took one stride and tightened his muscles to swing his left arm at the opponent before Xiong Yu could take back his leg. In Lou Cheng’s head were Thunder Cloud’s loud screams.</p><p>Bam! Xiong Yu blocked the strike hurriedly. His body was pushed away, blood and qi boiling, muscles and tendons shivering as if hit by a bomb.</p><p>Before he could perform an inner training to work off the shiver, Lou Cheng’s right fist already arrived. He quickly adjusted, visualizing a rolling river becoming Ice-bound all of a sudden.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As their fists touched, the cold current ran powerfully, dragging Xiong Yu into an ice crevasse. His body froze.</p><p>Lou Cheng shook his arm and flapped across the rival’s neck before taking it back. He smiled as the referee called,</p><p>“Match Four, Lou Cheng wins!”</p><p>He-heh. It feels great to be a shark once in a while!</p><p>Gu Shuang had just got her video camera ready, aiming at the ring.</p><p>“Err… ” Her smile turned stiff hearing the referee’s announcement and seeing the two separated. She talked to Yan Zheke in a loss, “It was fast… ”</p><p>I was just about to start!</p><p>Yan Zheke found it brusque but amusing. She said in exasperation,</p><p>“We shall break off our relationship!”</p><p>I told you to begin from the talk time!</p><p>Wu Ting looked at her buddies with sympathy and heaved a sigh before murmuring to herself,</p><p>“Too weak!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
