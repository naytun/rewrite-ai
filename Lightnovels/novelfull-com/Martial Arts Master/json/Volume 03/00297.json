It also helped to sketch out the perfect outline of the girl. Her skin looked pink and white under the shining sunlight</p><p>Lou Cheng again pulled Yan Zheke to his side with his left hand. Although he had thought of several opening remarks in his mind, he vetoed them quickly.</p><p>“Ke…” In the end, he only pronounced her name with a charming voice.</p><p>“Yes?” Yan Zheke’s body tightened slightly. She turned to her boyfriend and gently gave a response, but she consciously avoided looking him in the eye.</p><p>Under this condition, Lou Cheng did not say anything. After he heard the word “yes”, he moved his right hands to touch the girl’s face and lowered his head. At first, he touched her lips with his own lips, then he kissed her gently. As Yan Zheke’s tightening body gradually relieved, she seemed to find the familiar feeling. She raised her head and closed her eyes. She then opened her mouth unconsciously.</p><p>Their tongues were chasing each other. Lou Cheng controlled the passion in his heart and released it bit by bit.</p><p>After a while, Yan Zheke moved her head backward to escape from his increasingly fierce kiss. With shiny lips, she said in a peevish tone, “Let’s continue to see ph…”</p><p>Until she finished her words, she found that she was held into Lou Cheng’s powerful body. All coldness of the frost faded, leaving the burning ripples in their heart lake. Her lips were covered by Lou Cheng’s lips who put his tongue into her mouth excitedly.</p><p>The atmosphere between them grew hot. After Lou Cheng tasted the sweetness of her mouth, heard her gradual heavy breath, and felt the intimacy from their tangled tongues, he felt his blood was burning. His left hand which was circling the girl’s waist suddenly moved back. He then moved his right hands downward to reach the bottom of her T-shirt and touched her seductive and delicate skin.</p><p>He found that Yan Zheke again tightened her body, but he continued to engulf her mouth and moved his hand forward slowly with expectation and tension.</p><p>Realizing that he was about to reach the destination, his heart beat heavily like a drum. At this moment, Yan Zheke lifted her left hand to press his palm and made a thin voice from her throat.</p><p>Lou Cheng at first felt very lost. He was going to have to endure his passion. He took back his hand. However, he found that the left hand the girl pressed on his palm was extremely weak and her body was trembling gently.</p><p>Boom, the happiness in his mind seemed to explode. Blood rushed to his face. He gently moved his right hand and broke through her pretended prevention easily.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s legs closed together with her toes bending and grasping. The album on her knees slid forwards and dropped to the ground. It was turned to the photo of Lou Cheng standing naked in the bathtub.</p><p>Time went by, and the girl’s white T-shirt fell down covering the album. Her legs moved to the edge of the bed.</p><p>The sunlight coming in the room through the window had become abnormally beautiful. Lou Cheng thought that he would never forget the scene before him. He would never forget his amazement as he witnessed Yan Zheke’s body.</p><p>He lowered his head to lick her body as if he was going on a pilgrimage, as if he was violating it.</p><p>Time passed slowly. Suddenly Lou Cheng’s right hand which was exploring the lower part was pressed tightly. Yan Zheke who had been biting her lips and only making the occasional sound opened her charming eyes and said in a gentle but firm tone,</p><p>“No…”</p><p>Feeling her insistence, Lou Cheng took back his hand. He then kissed the girl and said with a bitter smile, “I need to go to the bathroom.”</p><p>“Ok…” Yan Zheke lowered her eyes and answered him. She grabbed the quilt by her side to cover her body. She breathed heavily, and her face flushed red.</p><p>When Lou Cheng opened the door and ran out quickly, she suddenly curled up and raised the quilt to cover her head. She even cursed him several times from under the quilt,</p><p>“Lecherous Cheng! Lecherous Cheng! So lecherous!”</p><p>After Lou Cheng handled himself, he washed his face. When he went back to the room, he saw that his girlfriend had already put on her clothes neatly. She reclined on his bed against the pillow, with the album which had fallen down earlier open at her side.</p><p>“Hmm!” The moment she saw him, Yan Zheke turned around, and said the word with a heavy voice to show her dissatisfaction. “Deviant!”</p><p>She muttered in a low voice, while Lou Cheng’s heart was full of joy and satisfaction. He walked over and lied down next to her. He held her in his arms again.</p><p>Yan Zheke struggled slightly, but then she relaxed her body. She leaned her head on his body again and pinched his arm with her right hand to show her shyness and anger.</p><p>“You only want to make out with me!”</p><p>Lou Cheng recalled what had happened just now. He’d then felt that the sunshine coming into the room was so bright, the room was hot but comfortable, everything was so great. So there was a sincere smile on his face. All his mind was filled with happiness and sweetness because he found that their relationship had been assured they’d become closer.</p><p><em>Yes, she is my wife!</em></p><p><em>My wife!</em></p><p>Yan Zheke found that he did not answer her, so she quietly raised her head and glared at him. Annoyed, she asked, “Why are you laughing like a fool?”</p><p>“I feel like you have already become my wife!” Lou Cheng replied with a smile.</p><p>“Pooh…” Yan Zheke cursed him with a blush remaining on her face.</p><p>Thinking of the previous scenes, Lou Cheng chuckled with relief. He sighed,</p><p>“Girl’s undergarments are really hard to unbutton. Even with my flexible fingers and smooth force, I almost failed to unbutton your bra. Yes, mainly because I’m too impatient.”</p><p>In the past, he would never have said such shameful words directly in front of Yan Zheke. However, he didn’t know why. He thought that they didn’t need to avoid this topic anymore for their relationship had achieved a new level.</p><p>Hearing his words, Yan Zheke was stunned. She had never thought that Lou Cheng would talk about something like this with her. On the one hand, she felt shy and annoyed. On the other hand, she felt what he’d said was a little funny, so she fiercely twisted him,</p><p>“You are a hooligan!”</p><p><em>How can you say such a thing to me!</em></p><p>“Hey, hey.” Lou Cheng bore her twisting with a smile.</p><p>He knew that Ke was not really exerting force into her fingers. She could tear a piece of meat from his body with her fingers’ current power!</p><p>“Are all the boys so dirty?” Recovering from the shame, Yan Zheke blinked her eyes, and questioned him with slight curiosity.</p><p>She found that the topic Lou Cheng talked about before wasn’t so resistant and repellent to her.</p><p><em>My bra has been unbuttoned by Cheng, so to talk about such things seems to be normal…</em></p><p>“I think except a few men, most men are the same. But the problem is how dirty they are, is different. This is a feature people are born with. If they are not curious about sex or don’t look forward to having sex, then they may have some problems… How about girls? Except for girls like Dirty Tong?” Lou Cheng felt so relaxed, he answered frankly.</p><p>“We are not,” Yan Zheke at first denied. She looked at her toes and pretended to say it normally, “But we still know something, emm, something, not, we are not as innocent as boys think…”</p><p>Speaking of this, she began to blame Li Liantong, “I learned a bit about it through reading romance novels. What I learned next was all taught by Dirty Tong! She even said that she had entered many online chatrooms and found that married women were much more dirty and violent than most men…”</p><p>“Really?” Lou Cheng asked in astonishment.</p><p>“I don’t know whether it’s true or not. I’ve never entered into such groups…” Yan Zheke played with Lou Cheng’s stomach using her right hand. She pressed it, pinched it, rubbed it and outlined his muscles with her finger like a naughty child.</p><p>She was stunned to see Lou Cheng react again to her touching.</p><p>“You, you…” She stammered.</p><p>Lou Cheng would never tell her that he had recalled what happened just now because he was stimulated by her touching, so he said with a hollow laugh,</p><p>“My qi and blood is particularly vigorous, isn’t it…”</p><p>“Super invincible pervert!” Yan Zheke blushed slightly and gnashed her teeth to say this sentence. She turned over to get off the bed before putting on slippers.</p><p>“Where are you going?” Lou Cheng asked quickly.</p><p>“The bathroom.” Yan Zheke answered in an annoyed tone.</p><p>After washing her face, Yan Zheke stood in front of the mirror. When she saw her pink face and moist eyes, she suddenly felt it was time to become a woman.</p><p>Love, was not only in the spirit. Love was also about sexual desire.</p><p>The blending of body and soul is the basis of a long-term relationship.</p><p>She thought it over and over for she was naturally sensitive as a girl. She also thought about many unrelated things and had all kinds of emotions. Her mind was complicated.</p><p>After a few minutes, she patted her face and went back to Lou Cheng’s bedroom.</p><p>However, the moment she saw this fool, all her emotions suddenly disappeared leaving only softness in her heart. She pursed her lips and said with pretended gruffness,</p><p>“I want to continue to see these photos! I blame it on you, the big pervert!”</p><p>“Okay.” Lou Cheng answered happily, hugging her once again.</p><p>Compared to before, he felt that more inexplicable burdens had been put on his shoulders.</p><p><em>It is my duty, but also my happiness.</em></p><p>I can’t relax the practice of martial arts at all!</p><p>Later, they certainly kissed and did some sweet things. Lou Cheng tried to control his desire so as not to push her.</p><p>Around four thirty, he went out of the community. After a few minutes, Yan Zheke followed him.</p><p>After taking a taxi, they came to a lake where they finally said a reluctant goodbye.</p><p>Just as they were about to separate, Yan Zheke suddenly reached out to twist Lou Cheng’s right hand, the one he had used to touch her. She then turned around and hummed,</p><p>“Pervert!”</p><p>After finishing her words, she ran into her house quickly so that he wouldn’t have time to react.</p><p>Touching his hand, Lou Cheng felt very warm and happy. He couldn’t stop laughing, so he just stood there, watching the girl as she disappeared from view.</p><p>…</p><p>Even during dinner, he was still occasionally thinking about their afternoon.</p><p>Girls had a special fragrance, not just the aroma of a shampoo or shower gel. Something more.</p><p>What excuse could he make next time to get her to come to his house?</p><p>Glancing at her son, Qi Fang looked at Lou Zhisheng and said casually,</p><p>Han Er’s wife told me that a particularly pretty girl came to our community this afternoon. I don’t know which boy could have such a beautiful friend…”</p><p>Eh… Lou Cheng suddenly woke up from his daze. He admired the gossiping ability of his neighbors.</p><p>If Ke came to his house again, they would know that he was the boy…</p><p>After finishing dinner and helping to clean up the table, Lou Cheng sat on the sofa, chatting with his mother. He listened to her complain that his dad had gone out to play chess again. He took out his phone and began to share with Yan Zheke the impression she had made on the neighbors.</p><p>As they were chatting, Yan Zheke suddenly asked,</p><p>“Cheng, do you think that I’m being selfish?”</p><p>No…”, Lou Cheng was confused, “Why would I think that?”</p><p><em>Where was this coming from?</em></p><p>Yan Zheke sent him a sentence without using an emoji, “Because of what I said this afternoon. I said that we could occasionally hang out in your home. Didn’t you think there was a problem with my words?”</p><p>Lou Cheng now understood the meaning of the word “occasional”. He asked, “Do you mean that we should live alone instead of living together with parents?”</p><p><em>Ke has planned so far ahead! I have never considered such thing. I think there are at least several years for us to plan!</em></p><p>“Yes,” Yan Zheke added, “I have never told you but I am a little selfish. I regard myself as the center of my life and then I draw circles outside the center. The innermost circle is the parents, then followed by relatives and best girlfriends, and I draw other circles in turn… ”</p><p>“Yes, I know. I have asked you which circle your husband belongs to.” Lou Cheng thought of this thing.</p><p>“Well, I will tell you the answer now. My husband also is the center of my life. After we have our own family, we should maintain a certain distance with our original family. Thinking like this is very selfish, isn’t it?” Yan Zheke asked him again.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
