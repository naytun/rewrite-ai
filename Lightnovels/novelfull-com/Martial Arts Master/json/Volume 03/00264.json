All of your friends and family, wherever they are, they must be watching the game broadcast, as long as they are free. So you might as well share the joy with them now.”</p><p>“That’s different. I’ll be too embarrassed to say anything.” Lou Cheng made a joke through self-deprecation.</p><p>Actually, it was too private and sweet to be said in public…</p><p>Wu Wei almost lost control of her laughter, it took great effort to stop it. “All right then, I won’t ask you to say anything to them. The first question, all is known to all. The Force Concentration will immediately rebound with an outbreak of force once it is completed unless the user himself has reached the physical-invulnerability state. However, you were able to maintain the state of Force Concentration for two to three seconds, right? It’s not in accord with common sense. So how did you do it?”</p><p>It was the key question that had been emphasized several times by the staff in the studio.</p><p>Lou Cheng had already prepared for it, so he smiled and said, “Don’t fire and ice contradict each other? But both ice and blaze supernatural abilities exist within my body and they are always in balance. My Force Concentration was actually based on them, so it could last for a longer period of time. As for more details, not only could I not explain with brief words, but also these are my private martial arts secrets.”</p><p>This explanation was the same as what he’d given to Yan Zheke, except it had been more detailed with the law of the Diametrical Unity, the theory of Circulating Balance, etc.</p><p>“The balance of ice and blaze supernatural abilities… ” In the Xing province satellite TV studio, Yu Hong repeated Lou Cheng’s words as if it reminded him of something and immediately eliminated his bewilderment.</p><p>“The balance of ice and blaze supernatural abilities… ” Geezer Shi sat in front of the television and scoffed.</p><p>It seemed that his scamp disciple had actually applied Longhu Immortal’s method, “forming a tai chi Bagua within one’s body with ice and fire as yin and yang to balance his condensed Dan”, into the process of Force Concentration. This was something quite unique.</p><p><em>So the brat did have some talent…</em></p><p>“Oh, so that’s the way it is,” Wu Wei acted as if he was suddenly seeing light. “The second question, what was your last unique skill that stunned Qiu Lin so quickly? Was it a simplified physical-invulnerability movement? You hadn’t taken any pre-actions and we were all taken by surprise.”</p><p>“Because I haven’t totally mastered it.” Lou Cheng replied with self-deprecating humor, “Even a simplified physical-invulnerability move is too difficult and complex for me to apply in actual combat at present. So, I had to simplify it according to my condition, kind of like grasping the trunk and ignoring the other details.”</p><p>As a variant version, his Severe Warning had mixed the visualization method based on the theory of “Diametrical Unity”, the effect tended to be freezing.</p><p>“A simplified Simplified Physical Invulnerable Move?” Wu Wei asked in reply with humor.</p><p>“Somewhat.” Lou Cheng put on a gentle smile without defending himself. It was better to play the fool at present.</p><p>“Second question, what did you talk about with Qiu Lin during the communication time? You seldom exchange ideas with opponents, right? Were you making a psychological attack?” Wu Wei smiled.</p><p>“Just a casual chat. We shall just compete in terms of kung fu instead of the tongue.” Lou Cheng kept smiling.</p><p>He didn’t mention what Qiu Lin had said at all, so no one knew if he was telling the truth or not. Since he would encounter the top 3 fighters sooner or later, what he needed to do now was just handle them.</p><p>“Yeah.” Seeing that the arena was being cleaned for a stars’ performance to be held later, Wu Wei ended the interview, “Lou Cheng, thanks for your time. You have entered the top 8 and are within a hair of the top 4, may your wish come true.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Lou Cheng replied with a smile.</p><p>As a dedicated reporter who was good at making the best use of limited time, Wu Wei blocked Qiu Lin’s path as soon as she left Lou Cheng. The poor girl had just recovered from the shock.</p><p>“Qiu Lin, what did you think of the match?”</p><p>Qiu Lin touched her cold face and put on a wry smile, “Just before the referee announced the result, I still believed that I would be the winner.”</p><p>She had never expected to be defeated by a single attack…</p><p>“What was your feeling at the final moment? Just after you were struck by the blow?” Wu Wei raised another question that most of the audience wanted to ask.</p><p>Qiu Lin thought for a while, and then told the truth half-jokingly,</p><p>“My feeling? I was frozen… ”</p><p>“So the coldness lowered your IQ? Sure enough, it was a physical-invulnerability move related to the Ice Sect Force.” Wu Wei said with relief, “What did you talk about with Lou Cheng during communication time?”</p><p>Qiu Lin curled her thin lips and said, “I made up a story to scare him but failed.”</p><p>“What was it?” Wu Wei asked curiously.</p><p>Recalling her failure, Qiu Lin gnashed her teeth in anger.</p><p>“That’s a secret!”</p><p>“All right,” Wu Wei gave her a professional smile. “Thanks for your cooperation. We all think you performed very well, like a powerful Buddha’s warrior attendant.”</p><p>“I personally dislike this simile… ” said Qiu Lin, the corners of her mouth twitching.</p><p>In the TV station, an executive slapped his thigh and said,</p><p>“Let’s call them Six Jinggang (Buddha’s warrior attendant) and Eight Fairies! As for the number four, what noun could follow it?”</p><p>…</p><p>“No, I’ve just defeated such a tough opponent and won an important match. I want to share it with the most important person first, er, share it with my family and friends… ”</p><p>Yan Zheke was watching Lou Cheng’s interview with her earphones. When hearing his words, her immediate reaction was disgust, but then her heart softened. Smiling to show her dimples, the girl’s eyes soon turned into two shimmering lakes reflecting the starlight.</p><p>When Lou Cheng finished the interview, and got back to his private restroom, Yan Zheke immediately sat straight, looking around carefully.</p><p>She was in the VIP airport lounge for the first-class cabin, and there were not many people here. She occupied a corner with a small round glass coffee table before her, while the sofa in front of her was empty.</p><p>As soon as she moved her tablet to the coffee table, her cell phone began to play Cheng’s exclusive ring.</p><p>The corner of Yan Zheke’s lips immediately curled up as she unplugged the earphone and answered the call, her voice softened unconsciously.</p><p>“Hello, Cheng?”</p><p>The idiot had called her first, as expected.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s heart quivered when he heard the girl’s soft voice. Standing up from the sofa, he smiled and replied,</p><p>“I almost lost the game.”</p><p>“Was that possible? Though it was breathtaking, I always believed that everything was in your hands.” Yan Zheke said in surprise.</p><p>Lou Cheng explained with a smile, “Qiu Lin was too self-confident and even arrogant. If she had made the most of The Lotus Step and Buddha Voice, I would have suffered big time. Thanks to Coach Yan’s blessing, she made the wrong choice and wasted her great strength!”</p><p>“Pft… Are you praising me?” Yan Zheke burst out laughing with curled eyebrows and eyes.</p><p>What a surprise that Cheng could make a girl laugh!</p><p>“I’m telling the truth! When that reporter asked me to share my joy with someone just now, I felt an urge to express gratitude to Coach Yan for her instruction behind all my achievements, and also for her efforts in all these days.” Lou Cheng smiled with a lowered voice.</p><p>“You’re so disgusting!” Yan Zheke covered her mouth with one hand while her body trembled with laughter.</p><p>Curling the corner of his lips, Lou Cheng echoed Yan Zheke’s words occasionally while waiting patiently for the girl to stop laughing.</p><p>Eventually, they both calmed down without saying anything. They were just listening to each other’s breath in silence as if feeling the lover’s heart.</p><p>As their emotion was being brewed along with the fast-spreading quiet atmosphere, Lou Cheng finally opened his mouth.</p><p>“Ke, what’s your flight time? When will it arrive?”</p><p>“Ten o five, and it’ll arrive at around one o’clock.” Yan Zheke’s voice was faint. She was still immersed in the atmosphere just now.</p><p>“One o’clock a.m.? It’s unsafe at night.” Lou Cheng was concerned.</p><p>“Gu Shuang will pick me up. Go to sleep on time and get sufficient rest since you still have a Top Eight competition tomorrow, do you understand? Or I’ll leave you alone!” Yan Zheke smiled; her eyes were lit with joy.</p><p>“Okay okay, I’ll obey Coach Yan’s order and wait for you tomorrow!” Lou Cheng said happily.</p><p>After chatting for a while, Yan Zheke suddenly recalled something and tried hard to stifle a laugh.</p><p>“Let’s continue our talk later through messenger. It’s time for you to call your parents. Remember you promised to share the joy with friends and family?”</p><p>Hey hey, obviously I was saying that to correct myself and satisfy the audience.</p><p>Isn’t the saying “forget one’s mother as soon as he gets a wife”?</p><p><em>Er, what am I thinking about…</em></p><p>“That’s true… ” Lou Cheng recalled what he’d said.</p><p>After finishing the conversation, he hurried to call his mum.</p><p>“Hi Mom, I was taking a shower in the restroom since I was all sweaty.” Lou Cheng made an excuse for his being late.</p><p>Not knowing what had happened in the restroom, Qi Fang immediately set suspicions aside and replied with great joy, “You’re right, it was actually the time for you to take a shower. Cheng, are you injured? That girl seemed to be too fierce.”</p><p>“I’m fine and feeling good. We have professional physical therapists here to help me relax myself,” Lou Cheng added since his mom would definitely raise this question. “Mom, I’ve entered the top 8 and will get at least a one-hundred-thousand bonus.”</p><p>“I know I know. Have a good rest in the room, don’t come out!” Qi Fang laughed more happily.</p><p>She had already known about the bonus from Jiang Fei and Cao Lele.</p><p>…</p><p>While Lou Cheng was chatting with his mom, Yan Zheke signed into the forum and went through the posts, experiencing the excitement of Lou Cheng’s fans.</p><p>Her feelings were complicated. She knew that Eternal Nightfall, (Yan Xiaoling) had been accepted by Songcheng University and was preparing to join the Martial Arts Club. On the one hand she felt happy and was quite interested in it since this junior sister was so cute, on the other hand she still felt a little weird because of Yan Xiaoling’s admiration of Cheng.</p><p>After going through the other fans’ replies with a smile, she was about to log out when she noticed a new post:</p><p>“I’m a lip-reading expert, let me translate the communication between Lou Cheng and Qiu Lin!”</p><p>Oops, she’d forgotten to ask him about it… Yan Zheke clicked open the post to read the Bull Demon King’s words:</p><p>“You’re now the public enemy of the Gaofen martial arts circle.”</p><p>…</p><p>Reading line by line, Yan Zheke stopped when it came to the prediction of Lou Cheng’s next opponent. Either Han Zhifei or Zhang Zhutong? Yan Zheke frowned in anger.</p><p>Was it true or not?</p><p>Was Qiu Lin making up lies to sting Lou Cheng or simply telling the truth?</p><p>As thoughts flashed through her mind, Yan Zheke clicked open the dialog box and messaged Xing Jingjing: Sister Jingjing, could you please find me a reliable lip-reading expert?</p><p>She knew many similar experts were cooperating with the police.</p><p>Xing Jingjing was confused. “Why do you want such an expert?”</p><p>Yan Zheke didn’t conceal anything. “I want a transcription of Cheng and Qiu Lin’s communication.”</p><p>Gu Shuang appeared, “What’s wrong with their communication? Did Qiu Lin flirt with your man?”</p><p>Yan Zheke had absolutely no doubt. “Not in the least! @Shuangshuang, are you familiar with any reporters or public relations firms? I want to make the shady dealings public and attract more attention to it.”</p><p>Thus the whole martial arts circle of Gaofen would have to avoid arousing suspicion no matter whether they had done it or not. Gossip was a fearful thing!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
