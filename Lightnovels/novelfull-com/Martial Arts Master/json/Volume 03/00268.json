It’s so convenient!” She smiled and patted Lou Zhisheng who stood by her side.</p><p>Because matches weren’t held during the day, the group of family and friends often visited Gao Fen together.</p><p>“That’s superstition.” Lou Zhisheng muttered, but the smile on her face was difficult to cover.</p><p>Cao Lele, Qiu Hailin and others had similar thoughts. They also thought that the chance was pretty good because this opponent was weaker than Qiu Lin.</p><p>They became very happy and looked forward to the beginning of the game. Only Jiang Fei, who felt like a fishbone was stuck in his throat, was not happy. He really wanted to tell everyone that Yan Zheke was Cheng’s girlfriend.</p><p><em>Why can’t people just be honest?</em></p><p><em>I really suffer a lot for this friendship!</em></p><p>…</p><p>“The No.6 seeded fighter is Meng Jiefeng.” Yan Zheke puffed out her cheeks. She thought that this opponent was neither good nor bad.</p><p>It could only be said that this opponent was better than Han Zhifei or Zhang Zhutong.</p><p>“Ke, your boyfriend is so lucky. His opponent is the No.6 seeded fighter, Meng Jiefeng. He is certainly weaker than Qiu Lin, right?” Gu Shuang’s tone gradually became unsure as she noticed Yan Zheke and Xing Jingjing were looking at her like she was an idiot.</p><p>Xing Jingjing answered her, “This opponent isn’t much weaker than the former, even though this one plays more ferociously.”</p><p>“Sister Jingjing, he has made huge progress in the past six months, hasn’t he?” Yan Zheke asked with great concern.</p><p>The reason she’d asked Xing Jingjing was that Meng Jiefeng was the rising star of the Gao Fen police system. He was also a mighty member of Professional Eighth Pin. He barely took part in the Challenge Tournaments aside from the contests of their own system, so videos of his contests were hard to find. Prior to this youth tournament, he hadn’t fought in public since the Spring Festival.</p><p>Xing Jingjing thought for a while and answered, “Hmm, I heard that he has improved and mastered a more ferocious playing style.”</p><p>She then emphasized the “ferocious playing style” once again.</p><p>Yan Zheke understood what she’d said completely. After Meng Jiefeng graduated from the martial arts school, he’d joined the army. He’d made a large contribution to the troops, so he was rewarded with the opportunity to learn the “Chill Force” in the fragments of Plague Sect!</p><p>When facing him, his opponents would often become weaker and weaker. If they were careless for a while afterward, they would then get a fever and feel extremely weak even if they had won the contest. So, his nickname was Flu Virus.</p><p>He had another problem. Aside from the “Chill Force”, whether he had other martial arts styles in the fragments of the Plague Sect or not, people did not know. Anyway, he had never used other styles in the Challenge Tournament. He always fought with other fighters using the Metal-like Refined Body and the Modern Xingyi.</p><p>Thinking of these, Yan Zheke could not help but worry about Lou Cheng. She picked up the phone and sent Lou Cheng the information that Xing Jingjing had revealed just now.</p><p>…</p><p>“No.6 seeded fighter?”</p><p>In the Lou family’s living room, Lou Debang suddenly became excited and picked up the phone next to him. He called someone and said loudly, “Hey, Old Liu, are you watching TV right now? Ah, you are watching. Have you watched anything from Xing province? It’s rebroadcasting my grandson’s contest, the youth tournament for the young fighters of the whole province. He made it into the top eight. In the next contest, he will compete with the No.6 seeded fighter! Which grandson? The son of Zhisheng, Cheng!”</p><p>“Old Zhu, haven’t I told you before? Turn to the Xing Province Satellite Television as soon as possible, Cheng is going to be on!”</p><p>…</p><p>Lou Cheng’s grandparents informed their friends and relatives one by one. They were so excited that their faces were flushed.</p><p>Wang Lili pulled Lou Zhiqiang aside and whispered, “Have you told Old Xin and your other friends? This is a glorious thing for our family. After this, Weiwei will also be more confident when he has a blind date later.</p><p>“What are you talking about? What if he loses?!” Lou Zhiqiang never spoke positively.</p><p>Lou Yuanwei sat on the single sofa next to them and felt like he was in a dream when he was watching the happy atmosphere in the living room.</p><p><em>Isn’t Cheng living the life I always dreamed of?</em></p><p><em>The life of hopes and a better future…</em></p><p>…</p><p>In the QQ group of Lou Cheng’s classmates in Senior High.</p><p>Du Liyu whose nickname was “Little Xin” sent a link,</p><p>“Everyone should go to support Cheng. The next contest is to decide the final four fighters. And Cheng will fight with the No.6 seeded fighter!”</p><p>“What are you talking about?” His former desk mate, Tong Hua, was bewildered.</p><p>Not until Du Liyu answered her question, Jiang Fei who has borne for quite a while answered, “She is talking about Lou Cheng. He is participating in the Provincial Youth Fighter Championship! He has advanced to the quarterfinals!”</p><p>“Really?” Xiong Tao was surprised.</p><p><em>The Provincial Youth Fighter Championship? It sounded like a prominent contest!</em></p><p>In high school, they had known that he was good at studying, but they didn’t know that he was so good at sports.</p><p>“Really, now even I throw myself down at Cheng’s feet in admiration.” Qin Rui who sat with most of the members in Gushan Martial Arts School said.</p><p>Because he was an expert acknowledged by all the classmates, the students in class four believed him a little and clicked the link to watch the video.</p><p>…</p><p>Lou Cheng’s fan forum had kept up its active atmosphere since this morning.</p><p>The members, Nie Qiqi and “All Good Names Are Taken By Dogs” felt so pleased to see the return of the familiar funny moderators, “Eternal Nightfall” and “Brahman”. They supported Lou Cheng and kept cheering for him.</p><p>The newly joined forum members, like “Bull Demon King” and “Innocence” were against the tyranny and showed their disdain for the lottery result. They thought it was inevitable because the tyranny had been exposed to the public. They hoped that Lou Cheng could defeat his opponent and advance in the semifinals.</p><p>But others, like “Bad girl”, “Cunning woman”, held a conspiracy belief. They used this result to debate with the people who believed in the tyranny. They said it had been made by Lou Cheng on purpose. They hoped Lou Cheng would get the flu and become seriously sick.</p><p>Watching people debating in the forum constantly, the members who didn’t care too much like Eternal Nightfall, Brahman, Unparalleled Dragon King, and Okamoto’s Fan sighed, they wanted to return to the previous, harmonious and stable forum like before.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s crazy fans, Eternal Nightfall and Brahman admitted that they were weak in debating.</p><p>…</p><p>Because it was the first battle, the dance and song program had ended before Lou Cheng had time to discuss much with Yan Zheke. After the ring was cleaned up, the referee came out. Lou Cheng had to put down the phone and began to meditate to clear his mind and improve his state.</p><p>“The first match: Lou Cheng vs. Meng Jiefeng.” The referee glanced at the electronic clock, and made a gesture to both sides.</p><p>At first, Lou Cheng had the impulse to wave to Yan Yanke in the stand, but he thought of her special reminder and sensed the camera’s focus, finally stopping himself.</p><p>He couldn’t show off their relationship in front of the audience, or his father-in-law would bring a knife from Gao Fen to kill him tonight…</p><p>Recalling the scene when Yan Zheke had offered to kiss him and cheer for him later, he took a breath and walked along the brilliant road under the brightness of floodlight towards the stone stage.</p><p>He was like a new car. Every step he took was like every trip the car ran. His physical state gradually mixed in his mental state. His momentum slowly rose until he set foot on the ring. Then a series of crisp, low bombing sounds appeared in his body and his muscles and bones made a rising sound.</p><p>Seeing such strong momentum, the audience held their breath and felt the Number 18 fighter, Lou Cheng, become much taller.</p><p>Meng Jiefeng was neither tall nor short with inch-long hair. He had sharp eyes and wore a dark blue martial arts suit which made him slightly charming. He stepped onto the ring almost at the same time as Lou Cheng.</p><p>He stood on the ground casually and introverted his momentum, introverted so that not to fight against Cheng directly.</p><p>The referee raised his right hand and announced,</p><p>“Three-minute talk time.”</p><p>Meng Jiefeng said with a smile, “You must feel a lot of pressure?”</p><p>“It’s normal.” Lou Cheng answered with a humble attitude.</p><p>“No, you are lying!” Meng Jiefeng’s eyes became sharp as if he was interrogating a criminal, “You are afraid of the influence of my ‘Cold Force’ which would make you sick after this battle, so you will lose the battle next day and never have the chance to advance in the semifinals. Then your competence won’t be testified, and everybody will believe that you advanced in the semifinals by some other tricks. You will end up dying like a normal person and be criticized by everyone. They will charge you as a villain.”</p><p>He wanted to bury the seed of hesitation in the heart of his opponents so that his opponent would make mistakes and be unable to decide which way to go when judging something.</p><p>“I have a clear conscience. Whatever others say won’t influence me at all”. Lou Cheng said honestly, “If I have an opponent, I will challenge him in the right way. If there are some discredits, I will also challenge him in the right way. To answer the doubt by the victories I’ve obtained is my martial arts belief. Maybe it sounds a little immature, but it’s my real position.”</p><p>“When I set foot in the ring, I only consider the opponent in front of me in my heart and to defeat him with my power. This is the significant respect I have to give him. As for the next battles or the final impact, I don’t care about them so much.”</p><p>Because of the disturbance before this battle, he had reflected a little. With this conversation, he again summarized his thoughts.</p><p>In the actual combat, whatever you feared would happen to you more easily, so you had to keep a firm mind.</p><p>Meng Jiefeng shrank his eyes slightly and laughed, “I hope you can remember what you said just now.”</p><p>He did not say anything more for he knew the standard and was afraid of having a bad effect.</p><p>After a while, the referee checked the time. He once again raised his right hand and suddenly waved,</p><p>“Begin!”</p><p>Meng Jiefeng’s muscles and fascia suddenly bulged causing his martial arts suit to look very tight. And people could see that every piece of his tendons and vessels extruded from his exposed body parts. They all looked dark blue like iron so that the skin was as hard and cold as steel.</p><p>“Metal-like Refined Body” was the euphemism for it!</p><p>Meng Jiefeng used his back as the axis as he moved one step forward. He twitched the fascia on his side and stretched his right arm.</p><p>CRACK! His neck suddenly thickened and rubbed the air to make a bombing sound. The pieces of dark blue tendon and vessel seemed to outline many frightening flower patterns on his body.</p><p>PIA! The crisp sound rang constantly. His right fist punched out at high running speed.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s heart Lake was as clear and quite as ice. In a flash, his center of gravity moved backward. He bounced his spine and ran backward.</p><p>After entering Dan stage, his Condensation Stance seemed to have improved because of the wonderful feeling he had. It didn’t mean that he had predictions or the absolute reaction to dangers, but it could help him have a clearer mind, a more intuitive vision, and make a more accurate judgment.</p><p>Seeing that his opponent was moving back, Meng Jiefeng stepped on the ground hard. He ran forwards with the power coming from the precise rebound.</p><p>But just at the moment that his body leaned forwards slightly, Lou Cheng suddenly stopped. His center of gravity sank. He then exerted force into his feet and turned back to fight against his opponent within a split second. He tightened the muscles on his back and punched out his right fist. This was a ferocious counterattack!</p><p>He played this attack so properly just as Meng Jiefeng finished his punch that he didn’t have the time to strike a new attack. It was an embarrassing situation for Meng Jiefeng.</p><p>HISS!</p><p>Meng Jiefeng took a breath and slightly withdrew his force. He followed with a release that made his right fist come back strangely, his left arm extended and slashed out to the other side. The dark blue flower pattern on his neck became clearer.</p><p>This was the result of all the forces in his body uniting as a whole!</p><p>Seeing his arm was about to be struck by the opponent’s fist, Lou Cheng suddenly changed the center of gravity and dragged his arm which he actually flailed out abruptly to the other side. He disappeared from Meng Jiefeng and flashed behind him.</p><p>During this abrupt process, the force of Lou Cheng changed and rounded transparently and fluently so that his twisted movements looked very smooth and natural.</p><p>“Dan Stage!” In the TV broadcasting room, the guest host, Yu Hong, said in a praising and emotional tone.</p><p>“Dan stage!” Zhang Zhutong did not return to the restroom. He stood by the ring and exhaled a breath.</p><p>What he was unwilling to face had still happened. After so many battles, Lou Cheng had kept improving himself and shortened his practicing time to become a real Mighty Fighter of Dan stage.</p><p>The moment that Lou Cheng arrived behind his back, he tried his best to bounce his back so that he can exert new force into his right fist. With tight muscles and thunderclouds in his mind, he chopped Meng Jiefeng’s spine.</p><p>PIA!</p><p>The fist was so ferocious that Meng Jiefeng’s hair prickled and made him feel slightly bitter.</p><p>But he did not look panicked at all, he even began to laugh.</p><p><em>So great, you’re behind me now!</em></p><p>Within his mind, there suddenly appeared a big vicious bell, covered in floral motifs.</p><p>HUM!</p><p>His belly wriggled and his visceral rubbed. A sound came from his throat, so low that others could not hear.</p><p>Just as Lou Cheng’s fist was about to strike, his ear suddenly moved. There was a sudden, throbbing pain in his head and his arms softened involuntarily.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
