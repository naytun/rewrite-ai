He did not have Song Li’s QQ number, but Du Liyu invited him to join the chat after he spread the news of Du Liyu and Song Li’s relationship. In the chat, Song Li criticized and educated him and he had also made profound reflections.</p><p>He directed his message to “Old Memories” specifically. “Song Li, Song Li, are you around? There’s something I want to ask!”</p><p>Jiang Fei was feeling a mixture of uneasiness, nervousness, excitement, and anticipation. He wanted to both confirm and deny certain things, making for a contradictory situation.</p><p>The “Old Memories” Song Li instantly replied, “What is it? Don’t ask me about any secrets. I’ll never tell a blabbermouth like you!”</p><p>He took a breath before asking, “Is Yan Zheke staying at her grandfather’s place these days?”</p><p>“Why are you asking about this?” she responded. She was on alert, suspicious that Fatty Jiang had ulterior motives.</p><p>He picked up the cup next to him and took a gulp of water before typing his reply. “I want to confirm one thing. Hehe. If you answer me, I’ll tell you a secret as well.”</p><p>She was instantly curious. “What secret? Say it first!”</p><p><em>Perhaps it had something to do with Ke.</em></p><p>“If you don’t answer my question, I can’t verify the secret!” He exposed some hints of this secret.</p><p>After thinking about it, she decided it was not an important thing and replied, “Yes, Ke is at her grandfather’s place. We even agreed to go shopping together after she returns… ”</p><p>So Yan Zheke was really at her grandfather’s place! He was so surprised that his jaw dropped after reading just the first half of the reply.</p><p>Though he had long prepared for this, there was still a stormy sea within his heart and he began recalling the past.</p><p>The beautiful girl who attracted attention even when dressed in an old-fashioned military training uniform…</p><p>The joy he shared with Cheng and the other students when they peeped at the girl as they passed by Class Three…</p><p>The details about her that he had heard from others…</p><p>The loveliest, purest memories about his youth and girls…</p><p>The gentle smile on Cheng’s face when he was chatting on the phone during the winter break…</p><p>“I’m too stupid! I should’ve guessed a long time ago!” Jiang Fei smacked his forehead, remembering how he had once asked Lou Cheng if the girl he was courting was from Songcheng University. His answer was yes.</p><p>If the girl was a Songcheng University student and someone he knew, who else could she be except Yan Zheke?</p><p>“Hey, Fatty Jiang. Where’s the promised secret? Where are you?” After there was no reply from him for a long time, Song Li sent an urging message.</p><p>Jiang Fei subconsciously raised his hand to reply, but accidentally knocked down the cup next to him, spilling the water inside.</p><p>He picked up the computer in a hurry and took out the paper towels to wipe the table. He then sighed and cursed in a low voice.</p><p>“What a bastard! Cheng, I really envy you!”</p><p>On one hand, he was sincerely happy for his friend. On the other, he felt lost and dejected.</p><p>Cheng was not the only one with a crush on Yan Zheke…</p><p>For many boys, Yan Zheke was like the purest beautiful dream of their youth, untouched by other aspects of their high school. But the dream now belonged to Cheng alone…</p><p><em>This guy really made Yan Zheke his girlfriend!</em></p><p>Though Cheng was much stronger now, he still could not believe that Yan Zheke would fall for him!</p><p>He soothed his complex emotions and put down the computer to reply Song Li.</p><p>“The secret is that Yan Zheke is dating someone… ”</p><p>After sending this reply, he inexplicably felt a sense of loss.</p><p>“What? Ke is dating? How can I not know?” a shocked Song Li replied.</p><p>She often talked to Yan Zheke, even chatting every day. How could she not notice Ke was in a relationship?</p><p>It must be a lie.</p><p>No, that did not seem right. She suddenly realized that her focus was completely on Du Liyu this semester. They were in the honeymoon stage of their relationship and she unknowingly missed out on a lot of things.</p><p>She carefully thought it over and remembered Yan Zheke would often bring up the Martial Arts Club in their conversations. Each time they came to that topic, she would mention a familiar name.</p><p>“She’s dating Lou Cheng?” Song Li asked with sudden realization.</p><p>How could she be unaware of this!</p><p>When a girl inadvertently mentioned a boy again and again, it could not be any more obvious!</p><p>F**k! How could Song Li guess it instantly? Were Cheng and Yan Zheke demonstrating their relationship that openly? Jiang Fei stunned for a while before replying, “Yes. They started dating last semester.”</p><p>He found it hard to imagine what Yan Zheke would like when she was in love…</p><p>He suddenly frowned, feeling like he had made a mistake in telling Qin Rui this secret.</p><p>If he was in Cheng’s shoes and made Yan Zheke his girlfriend, he would not refrain from informing the world about it. Why did Cheng want to hide their relationship?</p><p>Were there any reasons that forced him to do this?</p><p><em>Oh no. He had already revealed it…</em></p><p><em>What was wrong with his blabbermouth?!</em></p><p>Jiang Fei picked up his phone uneasily, having decided to give Lou Cheng a call.</p><p>If he turned himself in, he could probably avoid a death sentence? Right?</p><p>…</p><p>Lou Cheng picked up his ringing phone and found that the 10,000 yuan from the Martial Arts Club had been deposited into his account. He smiled at Qin Rui.</p><p>“Let’s take a break. You can try again later. Don’t rush. The more impatient you are, the more difficult it is for you to meditate.”</p><p>“Okay.” Qin Rui opened his eyes and stretched his neck. He picked up his phone placed on the training equipment next to him.</p><p>“It’s really Yan Zheke… ”</p><p>His eyes widened and his knees almost buckled. Only one thought came to his mind.</p><p>He wanted to worship Brother Lou!</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Lou Cheng asked in concern after noticing his unusual expression. However, as soon as he finished his sentence, Lou Cheng felt the phone in his palm vibrating.</p><p>Fatty Jiang? Lou Cheng was puzzled when he answered the call. “Hey, Fatty Jiang. What’s up?”</p><p>What was up that he had to give him a call in a rush?</p><p>Jiang Fei swallowed his saliva with difficulty and asked, “Cheng, be honest. Are you dating Yan Zheke?”</p><p>It was as if a thunder had stricken Lou Cheng’s head and he only replied after being stunned for a moment. “How did you know?”</p><p>He was planning to deny it, but he could not say it. This relationship was his utmost pride.</p><p>“Weren’t you unwilling to tell us who your girlfriend is? That’s why I thought it wouldn’t be necessary for you to hide her identity if we don’t know her. So that means it’s someone we all know… ” Just as Jiang Fei wanted to reveal his involvement with his accomplice Qin Rui, he suddenly stopped. He decided to cover it up using the hints Cheng gave during the winter break.</p><p>However, Lou Cheng suddenly understood and remembered what Qin Rui’s inexplicable question. He turned around and glared at Qin Rui, making his knees feel really weak this time.</p><p>“So you had Qin Rui set a trap for me?” Lou Cheng interrupted the Jiang Fei’s explanation.</p><p>“I was just curious,” Jiang Fei answered with a faint laugh.</p><p>Lou Cheng said gruffly, “How can you be so gossipy? I didn’t tell you because I was worried you’d tell everyone we know. You didn’t tell everyone, did you?”</p><p>“I did… ” Jiang Fei answered in a weak tone, and then he immediately took the courage to say, “You should’ve just told me your relationship directly and warned me not to reveal it. I don’t even know what’s going on, so how could I keep it a secret… ”</p><p>Lou Cheng felt like everything before his eyes went black. “Who, who else did you tell? Du Liyu also told you not to spread about his relationship back then!”</p><p>How could he believe in his blabbermouth!</p><p>“Qin Rui and Song Li. Oh, maybe Du Liyu will also see it,” Jiang Fei answered honestly.</p><p>Qin Rui, Song Li, and Du Liyu? It was still fine. He could still control the present situation… Relieved, Lou Cheng did not have time to strangle Fatty Jiang because he wanted to first deal with the problem. “Hurry up and tell Song Li and Du Liyu not to tell others. I’ll have Ke warn them again. I’ll handle Qin Rui on my own.”</p><p>Ke… He called her name so easily and so familiarly… Jiang Fei nearly clenched his fist and cried. He replied quickly, “Okay, I’ll do that immediately. But why are you hiding this? This is great news!”</p><p>Lou Cheng thought it for a while and thought it was inconvenient to explain it over the phone. “Come to Gushan Martial Arts School. I’ll tell you and Qin Rui face-to-face.”</p><p>“Deal.” After hanging up the call, he immediately messaged Du Liyu and Song Li. A funny thought popped into his mind. He wondered if he would be assassinated if he went to Gushan Martial Arts School.</p><p>Lou Cheng ended the call and turned to look at Qin Rui.</p><p>Qin Rui gave him a thumbs up and smiled sweetly. “Brother Lou! I’ll sincerely call you Brother Lou! I don’t know how many boys in our grade who will insanely hate and envious of you!”</p><p>That included himself!</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled helplessly. “Don’t spread this news.”</p><p>“Why?” Qin Rui asked him in astonishment.</p><p>Like Jiang Fei, he thought this was incredibly great news.</p><p>“I’ll tell you why when Fatty Jiang arrives.” Lou Cheng clicked the first number his speed dial to call Yan Zheke.</p><p>When the call went through, they spoke at the same time.</p><p>“Cheng, Song Li has guessed that we’re dating!”</p><p>“Ke, Fatty Jiang has guessed our relationship!”</p><p>Both of them stunned for a while. Yan Zheke blinked and said, “What’s going on? Tell me everything from the beginning.”</p><p>So it was not Song Li who guessed it on her own… How dare Song Li acted like a famous detective in front of her!</p><p>“Here’s what happened… ” Lou Cheng told the whole story to her, including Jiang Fei’s reasoning process and how he casually answered Qin Rui’s questions. He felt a little chagrined.</p><p>He was too careless and had no vigilance. How could he hide their relationship from his father-in-law in the future!</p><p>Yan Zheke noticed her boyfriend’s chagrin and all her unhappiness suddenly vanished. She laughed. “You’re an idiot, Cheng… The future IQ level of our family still relies on me!”</p><p>“I’ll warn Song Li and Du Liyu again. They’ll probably won’t go around telling everyone. As for Qin Rui and Jiang Fei… why don’t we treat them to a meal as thanks for not spreading the news?”</p><p>Lou Cheng could not help laughing after hearing his girlfriend’s suggestion. “Ke, I know you’re far better and more mature than me in dealing with interpersonal relationships. But it shouldn’t be too serious and formal between guys. I’ll give them a little warning in a while!”</p><p>“Okay. I’ll trust you.” Yan Zheke pursed her mouth and smiled, showing her dimples. “Don’t worry about it too much. In fact, I’m prepared to tell Song Li, Sister Jingjing, Gu Shuang, and the others these few days about our relationship. This way, they can be our shields while we date!”</p><p>For example, she could give the excuse of shopping with Song Li and turn to where Cheng was.</p><p>When it came to these things, of course she must explain to the other party and align their alibis.</p><p>“Pfft. So you mean Jiang Fei and Qin Rui are the only ones who shouldn’t have found out? Heh, I’ll kill them to shut them up in a while,” Lou Cheng joked. Unable to conceal his longing for her, he asked, “Ke, when will you come back?”</p><p>Yan Zheke touched the necklace she was wearing and bit her lower lip. “I’m supposed to come home tonight but it’s overcast and windy outside now. It looks like it’s going to rain heavily. I’m worried my parents may get into an accident if I ask them to pick me up now so I told them to wait. That means I’ll only be returning tomorrow night or the night after… ”</p><p>Lou Cheng did not become flirty because Qin Rui was beside him. He comforted his girlfriend a little and ended the call.</p><p>When Qin Rui finished another round of still stance, Jiang Fei arrived near the Gushan Martial Arts School.</p><p>“Cheng, where are you guys? Do I come in just like this?” he asked on the phone.</p><p>Lou Cheng pondered and answered, “Wait outside. We’ll find a quiet place to talk.”</p><p>A few minutes later, three of them met at the side of the martial arts club where there was a block acting as the parking lot for bicycles and electric vehicles.</p><p>Observing his surroundings, Lou Cheng finally felt at ease when he saw there was only an old lady guarding the vehicles. He first joked.</p><p>“I gathered you here to assassinate you!”</p><p>Jiang Fei and Qin Rui burst out laughing, not feeling as high-strung as they did previously.</p><p>“Cheng, do you know how many people who would be envious of your relationship with Yan Zheke? Why are you hiding it?” Jiang Fei asked directly.</p><p>Lou Cheng shook his head and laughed bitterly. “Ke’s family doesn’t want her to date while she’s in university.”</p><p>“Oh!” Jiang Fei suddenly understood. “You should’ve told us directly. We’d definitely keep your secret!”</p><p>“That’s right. If you don’t say it, we’ll be guessing so much that the secret would be exposed more easily.” Qin Rui also agreed with Jiang Fei.</p><p>“I don’t trust your blabbermouth!” Lou Cheng stared at Fatty Jiang and laughed. “This won’t do! I have to imprint deeply on your mind an impression of your punishment so you’ll instinctively stop your mouth when you want to tell others!”</p><p>“What impression?” Jiang Fei was very curious.</p><p>Lou Cheng looked around and walked towards the parking lot where it was blocked by some concrete barriers and a few of thin steel chains.</p><p>“Think about your own neck.” Lou Cheng smiled with some threat. He suddenly set his center of gravity downwards and thrust his right hand at a frightening speed to grab onto the thin steel chain. He exerted force using the joints of his fingers and muscle fascia in his hand.</p><p>Pah! He crushed the chains with his hands!</p><p>Jiang Fei and Qin Rui both were dumbfounded and took a step back subconsciously, touching their throats.</p><p>That bloody chain was made of steel!</p><p>Lou Cheng repositioned himself and smiled. “Did you remember it well?”</p><p>This was the great power he gained only after beginning to truly master the martial arts!</p><p>He heard a severe shout coming from behind him.</p><p>“Hey, stop right there!”</p><p>The old lady who was guarding the vehicles ran over to them and glared at Lou Cheng. “Which department do you belong to? Which company do you work in? Are you working in the Gushan Martial Arts School? How can you simply damage public property?”</p><p>Like a shooting machine gun, she blabbered on.</p><p>Lou Cheng felt at a loss, and then said with a dull face,</p><p>“Aunt, could… could you please stop? I’ll compensate for it. Is that good enough?”</p><p>This impression was truly deep…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
