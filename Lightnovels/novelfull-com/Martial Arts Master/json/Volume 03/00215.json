The Frozen River centered on freeze and cold waves, stilling all even the surging kinetic energy. Lou Cheng, whose understanding of physics was limited to textbooks, could not find in which dimensions or aspects they were in concordance for the moment.</p><p>People naturally resorted to something familiar for clues when they had no methods or way of thinking. Similarly, there was only one thing that Lou Cheng was familiar with and could count on, the balance of ice and blaze of his internal Jindan.</p><p>“The balance between ice and blaze… The ice is similar to the essence of the Frozen River. But the blaze has nothing to do with the sound of the Thunder Cloud… ” Lou Cheng puzzled over this problem, as if trying to solve an impossible chemical equation.</p><p>“Thunder Cloud, thunder, Thunder Cloud, blaze… ” he whispered, attempting to associate the two things together. Shortly afterward he thought about a stance training he had practiced before, Lightning and Fire Stance —— Thunder and lightning made blaze!</p><p>Lou Cheng got excited as he thought of it. He believed he had found the right way. The truth was he found he reached a dead end soon.</p><p>The key of the Thunder Cloud visualization was the vibration of thunder, rather than the cleaving of lightning!</p><p>Lou Cheng heaved a sigh and suppressed his depression with the Freeze Water To Ice.</p><p>“Um, Ke had told me that I should think over it from different angles or way of thinking when unable to work out a question.” Lou Cheng remembered Yan Zheke’s instruction, pulled himself together and started to rethink this problem.</p><p>He consulted his curve wrecker girlfriend when he had time for self-learning.</p><p>“From different angles, change my way of thinking, from different angles, change my way of thinking… ” a train of thought came to Lou Cheng’s mind. He concentrated on what he wanted and what he was familiar with. New ideas continuously occurred and then were denied.</p><p>“The balance between ice and blaze, the balance between ice and blaze… ” Lou Cheng repeated it as if delirious. An odd idea flashed across his mind all of a sudden.</p><p>“I have the ice of the Frozen River and the blaze of the Lightning and Fire Stance. So the balance between ice and blaze?”</p><p>“Although it has nothing to do with the Thunder Roar Zen, it indeed achieved the balance between ice and blaze!”</p><p>“Um, I have to temporarily get rid of the thinking of the combination of the Severe Warning and the visualization of the Thunder Cloud and Ice-bound.”</p><p>“The balance between ice and blaze had been achieved… Master has mentioned Longhu Immortal emulated yin and yang with ice and blaze, yin and yang, yin and yang… ” he was stunned at the thought of this.</p><p>It might be a sign of a positive outcome!</p><p>Yin and yang, negative and positive, negative and positive electric charges generated thunderclouds!</p><p>Even though I can not associate the Frozen River with negative charges for the moment, I can think about it from the perspective of the ancient naive materialism. Yin and yang collide to produce thunder and lightning!</p><p>The Jindan (the Golden Elixir) of Longhu Immortal obviously supports my opinion!</p><p>Lou Cheng was suddenly enlightened, in the best of moods. When two reactants cannot react with each other, a catalyst is necessary to be put in, isn’t it?</p><p>After deliberating upon this, Lou Cheng suppressed his excitement and started his meditation, visualization, and concealment of spirit and qi.</p><p>A giant river went rolling, bitter cold suddenly falling, both banks being covered by snow and the waves freezing. A Frozen River picture was visualized in Lou Cheng’s mind.</p><p>Lou Cheng did not attempt to mix ice and blaze together in his own way, because his understanding was not deep enough for him to do so. Although he had known the theoretical basis of the Jindan, the balance between ice and blaze, he did not know how to put it into practice. What he could do now was to imitate it laboriously with the Jindan as a catalyst.</p><p>Lou Cheng put some attention on the following moves. Lowering his weight, he pulled in the brightness of the Vast Nebula to make the visualized picture of the Frozen River change in a marvelous way.</p><p>He took this opportunity to visualize the Lightning and Fire Pillar through the Great Sun surrounded by the brightness.</p><p>A bolt of silvery white lightning hit the frozen river, fire blazing on the surface of the river!</p><p>The visualization of ice and blaze struck at the foundation of the other. Lou Cheng straightway withdrew his spirits from the visualization and came back to the state of silence and clarity.</p><p>He settled the last clarity and led the “contradiction” to the Jindan following the subtle link between them.</p><p>The nebula slightly vibrated and then slowly moved around, immediately assimilating the contradiction. The visualized blaze oddly blasted off and hung on the horizon, becoming an “arctic sun” shining but not warm enough to melt frost.</p><p>The sun without some warmth shone upon the frozen river, making the surface glittering in a dreamy way. The fragile balance between ice and blaze recovered!</p><p>Lou Cheng did not have time to show his excitement. He quickly concentrated on the current feelings and tried to remember the subtle changes of his body.</p><p>When his spirit was about to dry up, he controlled the ice and blaze and made them collide head-on.</p><p>The Sun turned to be a fireball, crashing down on the frozen river!</p><p>At the last moment, Lou Cheng tried to put into the river the essence of the visualization of the Thunder Cloud, cold waves and hot currents. Make the ice act as yin, and blaze as yang.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The ice and blaze collided, yin and yang dashed together!</p><p>Geezer Shi leisurely watched Lou Cheng ponder long over the question and perceived his reaction to failures. Finally, he laughed and shook his head. He walked to a tree slowly, taking out his wine pot to please himself with a sip.</p><p>After a few of steps, his expression suddenly changed. He turned around in a flash and looked down at the ground.</p><p>Blasts of cold air swept through the ground, leaving transient ripples of white frost!</p><p>“What’s the hell?” Geezer Shi looked up at Lou Cheng with astonishment and rare bewilderment.</p><p>Lou Cheng was mentally exhausted. He rubbed his temples for headache relief before he found his master was looking at him with surprised eyes.</p><p>The final collision was totally out of control for Lou Cheng. He had to think about the lessons for improvement afterward.</p><p>It was impossible to succeed in the complete integration in mere a single day!</p><p>Geezer Shi cleared his throat before Lou Cheng reported his progress to him.</p><p>“What were you doing?”</p><p>“Master, you told me that you wanted to integrate the two visualizations. Longhu Immortal followed the example of Yin and Yang with ice and blaze. Yin and Yang generate thunder and lightning. So I pulled in the Lightning and Fire Pillar as Yang, and the Frozen River as Yin to create thundercloud for vibration.” Lou Cheng did not explain that the key lay in the understanding and grasp of balance between ice and blaze, which could activate the Jindan to complete the pull-in. Because he thought it might be too difficult for his old master to understand it with a low-level science attainment.</p><p>Geezer Shi generally understood the intention of Lou Cheng without much pondering, laughing grudgingly.</p><p>“Good! A young man of the new age! Good idea. But the power of the Lightning and Fire Stance is far away from the Frozen River. You can’t achieve the true balance between ice and blaze. A good blaze visualization is necessary.”</p><p>Being praised, Lou Cheng smiled, “You don’t need to be in a hurry. Take your time for that.”</p><p>It was precisely because the power of the Lightning and Fire Stance was far away from the Frozen River. The cold waves of frost could run over the hot current of blaze in the last collision, generating the similar effect of the Severe Warning. No one knew whether the ice and blaze would cancel out or intertwine with each other and mutated to something strange if they reached the balance. It was against Lou Cheng’s intention. He had better keep it in his heart when there were only six days left for the competition.</p><p>Moreover, a good blaze visualization required the fighter to be sensitive to the visualized picture. Even if he was very familiar with the visualization method as if traveling along a familiar road in a light carriage, it would still take several days for him to cross the threshold. He did not have enough time!</p><p>“Um.” Geezer Shi lowered his head and waved his arm, “Go to jogging. Don’t force yourself for visualization. It might hurt your brain. You can continue tomorrow.”</p><p>“Yes, master!” Lou Cheng answered cheerfully and walked away.</p><p>Seeing Lou Cheng walk far away, Geezer Shi breathed a sigh of relief and said in a self-mockery way.</p><p>“The youth of today indeed have bold vision and courage in action. Give me a fright!”</p><p>I narrowly lost face before my disciple!</p><p>He paused and shook his head.</p><p>“But It’s hard to say whether it’s good or bad for the competition at the weekend. Back in the day when I was young. Sign… ”</p><p>…</p><p>At nine o’clock, night wind with coolish damp air from the lake dispersed the accumulated heat during days of scorching sun. Students felt long-absent comfort.</p><p>Yan Zheke stayed in the classroom to do self-studying after her last class to wait for Lou Cheng.</p><p>Lou Cheng took over Yan Zheke’s canvas shoulder bag and casually carried it on his own shoulder. He held the girl’s hand, walking to the long bridge together.</p><p>Yan Zheke was concerned about what they had talked about on the school bus yesterday. She asked, “Cheng, didn’t you say that you would attempt to figure out the opposition and unity of the two visualization methods?”</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled, “Yes, I did. I initially succeeded with right direction and way of thinking! Ke, can’t you pretend to forget it and ask me a few days later? I wanted to give you a surprise!”</p><p>That was why he did not mention it for the day.</p><p>“I have a good memory!” Yan Zheke said with a smiling face, “Your initial success is also a surprise for me… ”</p><p>She pursed her lips and smiled, gracefully glancing to the side.</p><p>Thanks to my advice!</p><p>Yet, Cheng is really amazing. He succeeded within only a single day, creating another miracle as he always did.</p><p>Lou Cheng never forgot to praise Coach Yan. He said sincerely, “My success should be attributed to the Diametrical Unity that you taught me, and your instruction that I can change my way of thinking when I encounter difficulties.”</p><p>Lou Cheng described his general thinking process but left out the Jindan (the Golden Elixir) and some details.</p><p>Sweet dimples appeared on Yan Zheke’s cheeks. She smiled with a little bit of proud and shy emotion. Yan Zheke said playfully, “Look, it’s my merits!”</p><p>“Right, right, you’re the pillar of our home!” Lou Cheng pounced on the opportunity to flirt with Yan Zheke in a praising tone.</p><p>“Our home… “Her sparkling eyes took a look at him and subconsciously turned to her left hand where there was a simple but classical style of ring.</p><p>My Cheng…</p><p>Lou Cheng noticed what she was looking at. He smilingly reached out his left hand to touch her, making their rings show in a pair.</p><p>It reminded Lou Cheng of his excitement yesterday and the responsibility on his shoulders, as well as Yan Zheke’s cute trick. He cleared his throat, “Ke, we still have about half an hour. Why not go for a walk along the lakeside… ”</p><p>It was an unalterable principle that the man should take the initiative in such things!</p><p>Yan Zheke blushed after a brief blank, remembering her trick last night. She wanted to say something but only uttered one word looking towards the side with messy thoughts and racing heartbeat.</p><p>“Um… ”</p><p>We are just going for a stroll. It’s not a big deal.</p><p>The thin voice sounded shy and timid, which raced Lou Cheng’s heartbeat too. He held the girl’s hand, walking down the long bridge and turning to the path to the lakeside.</p><p>They walked for a while in the increasingly quiet lakeside. Yan Zheke’s heartbeat raced up, so did Lou Cheng.</p><p>“If Cheng wants to go further, to what extent should I permit… ” she thought, quivering with excitement and fear.</p><p>Yan Zheke had confidence in her boyfriend after their conversation during the May Day holiday and according to Cheng’s excellent performance. She believed he could control himself and tried to suppress her imagination. Yet, she still held instinctive fear for the unfamiliar things she had never experienced.</p><p>Lou Cheng looked around to make sure no one else here. He asked Yan Zheke to sit on the bench at the edge of the grove, standing in front of her.</p><p>Yan Zheke wore her white patterned short-sleeved t-shirt. Her heart beat so fast that her charming and soft body quivered obviously.</p><p>His throat was dry when he saw the girl looked down with her long black hair falling as beautiful as a fairy on a drawing. He slowly bent down.</p><p>Yan Zheke felt Lou Cheng’s movement, her heartbeat racing up again. She could not help keeping a firm grasp on her skirt.</p><p>Is he coming?</p><p>At this time, Lou Cheng got down on one knee and took her nervous left hand. Looking at her ignorant eyes, he lowered his head and gave a sweet kiss on her middle finger where the ring was.</p><p>Yan Zheke never thought they began in such way. She felt like drunk after a brief blank with both her body and heart turning soft. She shyly and happily watched Lou Cheng move his lips upward, from her middle finger to the back of a hand, to the wrist, to the forearm and to the upper arm.</p><p>Even though his warm kiss was not on some sensitive part, she still felt he kissed on her heart.</p><p>When his kiss left the girl’s arm, he pushed aside her hair and gently put his lips on her white and slim neck.</p><p>His kisses fell on her face, her chin, cheeks, tip of the nose, eyebrows. The girl closed her eyes, embracing all of this quietly.</p><p>Lou Cheng released his passion a little by a little. He targeted his kiss on her little and cute earlobe, nibbled her rubine-like ear affectionately.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s body shivered violently and then felt the kiss on her lips.</p><p>She attempted to meet the kiss on her initiative this time. The young lovebirds kissed passionately, and Lou Cheng kept his hands to himself.</p><p>It was natural and understandable that he wanted to go further. Yet, he knew that they were at the lakeside, rather than a private room. Although there was no one around, he should show enough respect to the girl.</p><p>…</p><p>Sweet time was always fleeting. Coming back to his dorm, Lou Cheng recalled what had happened just now and the success he had made in the morning, high-spirited emotion emerging in his heart with the passion to work hard.</p><p>I have to complete the Severe Warning for the competition at the weekend!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
