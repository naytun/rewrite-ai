It felt like he had stepped into a trap.</p><p>His arm went soft. His entire being felt like a top being spun around. He shakily slid two steps to the side, using the Yin-Yang Twist to try and find some respite.</p><p>Zhou Zhengquan’s entire body, as well as his qi and blood, had arrived at a point where he could strike in the blink of an eye. His swollen muscles and tendons seemed to burst through his skin like a volcanic explosion.</p><p>In this moment, Zhou Zhengquan somehow seemed like he was both several centimeters taller and several kilograms heavier.</p><p>Crack! The green bricks disintegrated underneath his feet, and his body was like an eagle as he violently “flew” and landed advantageously in front of Lin Que. Visualizing the stored up flood within him rushing forth, he bent his waist and threw his arm forward, making a fist and thrusting out.</p><p>The Fly Fall Punch’s “Dam Burst”!</p><p>He was like a wild animal in his violence, making it so that you couldn’t evade, and couldn’t dodge!</p><p>This strength was equivalent to an Eighth Pin in Dan Stage!</p><p>Just then, as Lin Que was leaning his legs inwards, he paused. He’d predicted long ago that this “Pitfall” would occur, and using all of his strength, energy, qi, and blood, he used gravity to pull it all down and form into a “sphere”!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The “sphere” rushed forward with an explosive power, surging outwards. Accompanied by the image of a fiery comet tearing through the horizon in his mind, Lin Que threw forth his right fist, lifted up his arm, and heroically slammed it to the ground!</p><p>Crack! Lin Que pushed against the inside of his legs, braced his body and waist, and then threw his shoulder forward, throwing out a punch like a fired artillery shell.</p><p>“This…” Jiang Lan’s pupils contracted as she found that she had a renewed knowledge of Lin Que. “Force Concentration” was the main sign of the Dan Stage. Even though he could only concentrate it into a “sphere” and not a single point, it explained a lot.</p><p>Perhaps before Summer Break let out at Songcheng University he’d achieve “Full Dan Stage”!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Zhou Zhengquan and Lin Que’s fists collided together with an oppressive sound, creating shockwaves around them and a raging wind!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>It was as if a meteor from above had hit Zhou Zhengquan. Not only did he get a terrible shock, but it was like he had just gone face to face with a giant explosion. All he could feel were his bones and viscera undulating endlessly, and his qi and blood boiling over.</p><p>Imitating the explosiveness of the Dan Stage’s “Meteor Force” was not a run of the mill occurrence!</p><p>Even more importantly, Zhou Zhengquan was already not at his peak state due to the remaining influence of Lou Cheng’s Frost Force lingering inside his body. Even in the face of a single punch, his insides and outsides would be moved. It nearly made him paralyzed, and for a moment he’d lost the ability to move.</p><p>Snap! Crack! Lin Que had been thrown to the side by his opponent’s boundless strength. He stumbled backward, crushing a brick with every step. After five steps in a row he steadied himself and blew out a breath of air.</p><p>Under the “flood” of the “Dam Burst” his Yin-yang Twist unexpectedly couldn’t release that much power. He’d nearly broken his arm!</p><p>This was the might of the Dan Stage and the Flying Fall Punch’s “Dam Burst” put together. Were it not for Zhou Zhengquan locking up, he could have already taken the opportunity for victory!</p><p>Lin Que stomped his foot and launched his body forwards his opponent like a comet rushing towards the ground.</p><p>Taking advantage of his weakness and take him down!</p><p>Bang! Lin Que adjusted his balance as he rushed forward a few steps and twisted his waist. He tensed his back and arm muscles and ferociously threw out his left fist.</p><p>Zhou Zhengquan was always a vain person, and in this critical moment his expression was calm. His qi and blood, strength, vibration, icy chill, stiffness and his spirit came together and once again contracted into a single point.</p><p>He positioned his arms, and let his inner strength explode, screaming outwards. Abruptly turning his waist, he threw out his thigh in an intense and terrible ‘Swing Force”.</p><p>When Lin Que’s fist hit its target, it was as if a 10 wheeler had slammed him. It felt like he was in a daze and that his body was going to fly away of its own will.</p><p>In this moment, Zhou Zhengquan again contracted his explosive power and reconcentrated it to a single point. It was like his entire body had lost all of its air, blood and life force.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Due to this sudden explosion and the violent surge directed at his legs, it caused his shoes to split open.</p><p>With the help of this force, Zhou Zhengquan could surpass the human bodies’ limits. He pounced towards Lin Que, who had just fallen to the ground, with such speed and spanning such a large distance that it caused Ye Youting and other Professional Ninth Pin fighters to feel like it was supernatural.</p><p>The record average people set in the long jump could not compete with this.</p><p>Zhou Zhengquan had planned his attack while Lin Que had been falling to the ground. Pouncing like a tiger hunting its prey, accompanied by the screeching wind, he landed in front of Lin Que in no time. Bending his waist and bracing his thigh, he delivered three consecutive powerful hits with all of his power concentrated into one Dantian point.</p><p>At last, in this moment, he’d arrived at the absolute limits of his power. He was now using his Killer Move which was normally used to take down a Mighty one in Dan stage.</p><p>“Three Consecutive Fly Fall Strikes”!</p><p>Ordinarily, there was a limit to how many times someone at the Eighth Pin Dan Stage could attack. On top of that, when dealing with successive attacks such as this, once reaching three or four hits, the body would simply “overload” and problems would arise.</p><p>Zhou Zhengquan practiced an off-branch of the Water Sect school, Flowing Condensation. Therefore he could surpass the “Two Consecutive Strikes” that an ordinary Eighth Dan Stage would do and accomplish “Three Consecutive Strikes”.</p><p>Even if a similar Eighth Pin expert like Wei Shengtian was here, if he were to exert his full power, he would also be in imminent danger!</p><p>Three or four strikes in a single maneuver, this was the real deal!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Attacking with that kind of power, all kinds of feelings rushed forward. Zhou Zhengquan’s body swelled, his muscles clear and defined, along with vague, indistinct changes.</p><p>Inside his mind, he visualized a continuous convergence of the flood, and an unending increasing of power. After bringing back his feet in a majestic display, he slammed them down in a great torrent, violently slamming to the ground with a resounding crash.</p><p>He lifted his right arm up, made a fist, and exerting all of his strength, struck down with a loud bang.</p><p>The Fly Fall Punch’s “Waterfall”!</p><p>This time, he’d make Lin Que stay down, rather than letting him get away.</p><p>Bang! The explosion rang out as his fist slammed down. Lin Que just balanced himself when encountering such a hopeless strike.</p><p>He breathed in quickly. His entire body shivered as his qi and blood concentrated and formed into a single sphere.</p><p>In his mind, he again visualized himself as a flaming comet splitting open the sky. He lowered his waist and positioned his legs, arranging his stance.</p><p>Since he couldn’t escape, he’d have to do his best!</p><p>There was a loud rumble. Like a comet falling to earth, Lin Que summoned his courage and threw out the “sphere”, his temples pounding. All of the muscles in his body expanded, but his back was compressed and stretched taut.</p><p>Bang! His feet pressed down and his waist lowered. He made a fist with his right hand and slammed forward in an attempt to bat away his opponent’s fist.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Their fists collided, and the two fighters’ bodies simultaneously shook as if they’d been shot out of the cannon.</p><p>Zhou Zhengquan absolutely had the advantage, as the tremor that he’d received wasn’t at all severe, but his bodies’ reserves were far from being sufficient to win against Lin Que. He had all the classic symptoms: something like a ringing in his ears, nonstop shaking, his qi and blood rolling over, and a dry throat.</p><p>This made him want to pull out his left leg, but he didn’t have enough time to keep up.</p><p>As Lin Que was slammed by the fist coming down, both of his legs seemed to sink into the bricks. All of the muscles and tendons in his body all began to tremble, and he was unable to control the shaking.</p><p>At that moment, he moved back and forth stiffly like a puppet as if he’d just been launched from a catapult. It looked like there was an invisible giant in the pit of his stomach pushing and pulling him about.</p><p>“Yin-yang Twist”!</p><p>In this critical moment, he depended on the Yin-yang Twist to lend him some strength. With this “self-banishment,” he could get some distance between him and Zhou Zhengquan to avoid being met with another strike.</p><p>Zhou Zhengquan’s “Three Consecutive Fly Fall Strikes” was exceptionally terrifying. Even after resisting it, Lin Que still was unable to figure it out. All he could do was throw out his thigh, fall to the ground and roll away.</p><p>If he didn’t do this, he’d definitely get seriously injured!</p><p>During this process, Lin Que was in total control of his body, which had been blended together. His tendons throbbed in succession, his muscles swelled, and he quickly slammed to the floor, simultaneously creating and expending energy.</p><p>Zhou Zhengquan had difficulty finding his balance as he shook from the cold current. Although he had caught up, he felt like his body was suddenly barren, and he was unable to maintain his natural posture.</p><p>“Agh, if I could just strike without any problems, Lin Que would lose…” The sad thought occurred to him that he was fighting a losing battle. Were it not for the two Frost Forces, the consecutive Tremor Punch’s he’d received, and his dissipation being greater than predicted, this would have been the time when he could have collected the victory along with the spoils!</p><p>Breathing slowly, Zhou Zhengquan took large strides and stepped up to Lin Que. Although his opponent’s right fist was at his side, Lin Que took the opportunity to turn and, without the slightest warning sign, threw out his left leg. So quick and fierce was the strike that his foot had about 500kg of force.</p><p>Bang! Dan Stage Mighty One’s Absolute Reaction. Zhou Zhengquan’s body was slow by half a beat and he didn’t have time to defend himself. He had no opportunity to grasp the leg, and all he could do was reluctantly brace his muscles and give a low kick to ward it off.</p><p>Bang! Amongst the impact, Lin Que hit quickly and stood up once again. Not fleeing, and not yielding, he stood up and punched forward.</p><p>Fighting until this point, Zhou Zhengquan truly was reaching his limit. However, he saw that Lin Que was sweating like a fountain, and his face was pale. He obviously was also not relaxed. He clenched his jaw as he carried out the Fly Fall Punch’s “Continuation,” bringing close combat to his opponent.</p><p>Until this moment, Lou Cheng had been holding his breath ever since Zhou Zhengquan’s “Three Consecutive Strikes”. He’d been shaken to his core due to his brother-in-law’s narrow escape a moment ago.</p><p>If it were himself, even though he was in optimal condition, he was afraid he also would not be able to ward off the kind of attacks Zhou Zhengquan was using. After all, his own Frost Force required preparation, he was unable to do it in a split second.</p><p>Was this really an Eighth Dan Stage Mighty one’s true fighting ability?</p><p>As he turned the thought over in his mind, he suddenly noticed that Yan Zheke who just gave him a massage tightly squeezed his left hand with her right hand.</p><p>“Relax…” He consoled her, reaching out and patting the back of her hand.</p><p>Yan Zheke pursed her beautiful lips and nodded gently.</p><p>…</p><p>Bang! Crash! The more Zhou Zhengquan struck, the more fearful he became. It was as if he was facing an emotionless robot, who wasn’t in the least bit afraid or worried.</p><p>His weariness had begun to be obvious, but his face was still cold and his gaze was steady. It couldn’t help but make him suspect that he’d made some mistake.</p><p>Lin Que used the Yin-yang Twist as his core technique. He then relied on his entire strength to launch a chain of “24 Blizzard Strikes”. The more he hit, the more violent and insane he became, gradually wearing down his opponent.</p><p>Zhou Zhengquan was powerless to strike out again. He had no choice but to painfully prop himself up and wait for his enemy to reach his limit.</p><p>After a dozen or so strikes, Lin Que twisted his body and mixed in rebounds. He raised his left arm above his head, and his right fist flew out with lightning speed in a Seabed Burst Punch!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The shattered Zhou Zhengquan wasn’t able to square up his hands in time, and got a direct hit.</p><p>Bang! Lin Que’s punch reverberated. His left fist once again went out, stopping short of Zhou Zhengquan lower abdomen.</p><p>Zhou Zhengquan froze. Panting for air, he said matter-of-factly,</p><p>“Fine, I submit.”</p><p>Lin Que sighed heavily and didn’t respond. Sweat rolled over his eyelids, obscuring his vision. His expression was just as indifferent as before, the points of his eyes as steady as they always had been.</p><p>The referee raised his right hand and loudly declared,</p><p>“Round Three, Lin Que wins!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
