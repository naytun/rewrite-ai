Or, does he want to show off in front of his old friends?</em></p><p><em>He is indeed the master who is perfect at showing off!</em></p><p>Thinking about it, since he is a man obsessed with backup, he decided to copy the videos to his computer, that way they were safe, even if something happened to his mobile phone.</p><p><em>This is the “great achievement” of my master!</em></p><p>Changing thoughts, he suddenly slowed.</p><p><em>F*ck, where is my computer? And, not just my computer, where is all my luggage?</em></p><p>Geezer Shi cleared his throat before going to leave the room. He was going to go downstairs and take it easy, but he heard Lou Cheng mumbling in a helpless tone,</p><p>“Master, it seems that I left my luggage back on the mountain… ”</p><p><em>“On the mountain?”</em> Geezer Shi was also stunned for a moment, and then he suddenly remembered that he had forgotten to pack-up for his stupid apprentice back in the Songtao Pavilion. He had been too busy with covering the mountains with snow.</p><p>After they had chatted leisurely, for more than two hours, they even enjoyed a substantial lunch, and then, both of them completely forgot this whole packing thing.</p><p>They stood there for half a minute, looking at each other in shock.</p><p>Geezer Shi, being mature, was able to calm down instead of becoming flustered, and he laughed while saying,</p><p>“You, little boy, are so shocked by such a normal scenario? Even though you forgot your luggage, Haha, it doesn’t matter at all… Why are you looking at me like that? You can easily find a nephew to send your luggage to you.”</p><p>After saying this, he walked out through the door quickly and went to take a nap.</p><p>Lou Cheng didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, as he watched his master leave. He covered his face with his hands and sighed deeply.</p><p><em>Showing off his great power was exciting as long as he didn’t forget his own luggage on the mountain…</em></p><p><em>What’s more, master, because you were so rushed to show off your great power that you didn’t even give me an opportunity to exchange my contact information with my other nephew!</em></p><p><em>Currently, I only have Mo Qingting’s phone number. Will I have to rely on her?</em></p><p><em>Well, she looks like a troublemaker. If I had it my way, I would never have anything to do with her. I should find my senior Sister and ask her to help me find a nephew on the mountain to do me this favor.</em></p><p>Lou Cheng stopped overthinking and took out his phone. He intended to write an e-mail with the videos attached, to his master.</p><p>While writing the email he was smiling, hoping it would cheer up the old man, but, midway, he became sad.</p><p><em>Will my master still have a chance to do something like this in the future?</em></p><p><em>Is it possible for him to recover from his injury?</em></p><p><em>Will he really only live for another seven or eight years?</em></p><p>Thinking about all of this, Lou Cheng felt very uncomfortable. He wanted to do something for his master, but under the condition that he did it by his own identity, his own strength, his own circle friends, and his own knowledge, even though it was much lower than his master’s. <em>“How can I deal with this thing which even my master and Senior Sister can’t solve?”</em></p><p><em>Even I can’t find any clue or the location of his injury. I hope that his cultivation will be effective.</em></p><p><em>Even if the way of cultivation was effective, I’ll have to wait for the results of the study to help me to extract things. This process would last, at least, one to two years. Especially the extracting part, which needed more time, because, under the condition that Longhu Immortal has achieved the peak of physical invulnerability if there were any crucial things in the Jindan, it could only appear in the process during which I achieve the physical invulnerability. I still find this fact from the “Ice and Fire sky” which he has practiced for about a year.</em></p><p>There was still a long way to go.</p><p>As a boy of nineteen, Lou Cheng was confident and he believed that he could change the world. He also thought that as long as he made the effort, he would be rewarded for it. His experience last year only solidified this belief. However, he was currently feeling helpless and sad. He was feeling small and weak, wanting to help his master, but not knowing how.</p><p><em>All I can do now is burying this feeling, deep in my heart, and leave it untouched. Over the next few years, I will strive to find new hopes and enhance my strength as much as possible.</em></p><p>Even though there were a lot of uncomfortable and helpless feelings in one’s heart, people would still have to face life with a smile.</p><p>This is life, and, this is growth.</p><p>Lou Cheng took a breath and slowly exhaled it. He moved his thumb to send the videos.</p><p>Lou Cheng changed over to another application and sent a message to Yan Zheke,</p><p>“Ke, is there an expert who is very good at curing internal injuries in your grandfather’s sect? The main symptom is a cough… ”</p><p><em>Of all the people I know, it seems that only Ke’s grandfather might be able to find a man who would be able to help my master.</em></p><p>Yan Zheke at first sent the emoji with the “face with a hand wiping a cold sweat”, then she added a “hold your head” emoji. She replied, “Stupid Cheng, you could directly say that you want to help Coach Shi… ”</p><p>While they were chatting that morning, she had heard him mention that Coach Shi had been injured and was in bad health. Now, even though Lou Cheng was trying to hide it, she was keenly aware of his depression and sadness. She felt a shock in her heart and then she connected it to the previous words he had said. So, she added in a hurry, “Is his body hurt again because he changed the weather? Has his health condition gotten worse?”</p><p>Coach Shi had taught her martial arts for about a year. Even if he always often made fun of her, she still felt that he almost became her master. What’s more, Coach Shi was Lou Cheng’s master. If you love a person, you also love his dog. So how could she not worry about Coach Shi?</p><p>Lou Cheng told her about the current health condition of his master and what his Senior Sister had observed. At last, he was too worried to send an emoji,</p><p>“I don’t know what I can do now… ”</p><p>“Do what you can do. Never feel that you are omnipotent… Try to practice your martial arts more and more, and become a powerful person as soon as possible. This may be the most urgent thing which Coach Shi wants to see. While you are achieving your higher level of martial arts, you can gain contacts with stronger people and find more ways to help him… ” This was the first time, for Yan Zheke, to face such a sad thing, so she had no idea how to comfort the foolish Cheng.</p><p>Lou Cheng knew that this problem wasn’t going to be solved immediately, nor was it an easy idea for him to tackle now. His mood slowly eased after he heard the girl’s soft words and it eased his feeling of helplessness.</p><p>By the end, Yan Zheke’s words returned to the initial topic and she said, “The Shushan Study has some forefathers who are always reading about discourse and practicing alchemy. I will call my grandfather and ask him right now. Coach Shi is also my coach. So, my grandfather will understand and provide assistance.”</p><p>“Well, okay. Although, I think my master must have asked someone from the Shushan Study before… ” Lou Cheng replied with a bitter smile.</p><p><em>Since I am feeling so down, I can get Ke to keep me company. Her gentle words and understanding. I am so lucky to have her in my life.</em></p><p>After waiting a moment, Yan Zheke sent him an “opening a pair of stunned eyes” emoji, “My grandfather said that your senior sister has specifically gone to Shushan for your master. But, unfortunately, even the leader of the Shushan Study and the other elders tried, together, to cure your master, it still didn’t work… ”</p><p>“That’s what I thought… ” Lou Cheng looked at the phone screen with another bitter grin.</p><p><em>If there was anyway, my Senior Sister and my master’s old friends had certainly tried them.</em></p><p>“You needn’t worry too much. You said that coach could live another seven or eight years and now with the fast development of science and technology, there are many innovations. The mighty fighters who are at the peak of martial arts often fight against each other, so their unique skills will integrate with each other. They then will surpass their predecessors, which means, that maybe after a few years, people could discover a way to cure Coach Shi. Maybe Dragon King or Warrior Sage will someday break to a higher level? My grandfather said that Coach Shi had a close relationship with the Longhu Club and also developed a good relationship with the Wu Guang Taoist in the Shangqing Sect. And, as long as he is alive, there is hope!” Yan Zheke made an effort to say this with a positive attitude.</p><p>“Yes, as long as he is alive, there is hope!” Lou Cheng repeated her words to help ease his feelings of sadness and depression.</p><p><em>While I’m waiting for science and martial arts to develop, I can try to improve myself to achieve my physical invulnerability as soon as possible and unlock the secret of Jindan, so I will be able to find an effective way in the end!</em></p><p>If the old friends of my master worked out something through Cultivation, I would be willing to cooperate with them wholeheartedly!</p><p>That afternoon, after he had adjusted his mood, he began his daily tempering. He also began to learn the marrow and charm of the Prairie Fire Diagram and the Zhu Rong Diagram.</p><p>At the beginning of his learning, he hadn’t intended to use the Jindan to speed up his progress, because it would hinder his perception of visualizing other diagrams in the future.</p><p>Not every visualizing diagram would be about ice and fire, so he couldn’t rely on the Jindan completely!</p><p>After he practiced martial arts for three hours, Lou Cheng was sweating. In addition, he felt more relaxed and relieved.</p><p>As the Youth Tournament ended, I officially visited my sect. Later, I may be able to stop running around and worrying about trivial things like social interactions. So I can focus on practicing martial arts and spending more time with the person I love.</p><p>Life is too short, so we have to cherish the time we have, when we are together.</p><p>…</p><p>The next day, he said goodbye to his master first, who was about to go to the secret military base. He then took his luggage that a nephew named Liu Tang had brought to him and got into the car of Senior Sister, Shi Yuejian. She drove him to the Shang Gao airport and he took a plane, successfully returning to the Xing province.</p><p>After, Lou Cheng changed from a plane to take the high-speed train from the nearby the airport. Lou Cheng arrived at the bullet train station in Xiushan while carrying his backpack.</p><p>Before departing, he reported his agenda to Yan Zheke, and then he moved to a big step outside.</p><p>At that moment, a young girl, who looked like a high school student, suddenly stopped him. She said with curiosity and excitement, “You are the champion of the youth tournament, aren’t you? I have seen you on the television, several times!”</p><p>“Yes, yes.” Lou Cheng was too caught off guard to deny it.</p><p><em>When had the young girls become so brave?</em></p><p>“Oh, I know I’m right. Can you sign something for me? You are so powerful. Many students in my class like you and think you are the big hero of Xiushan~!” This young girl threw her backpack in front of her body so she could find her pen and notebook.</p><p><em>Big hero?</em> Hey… Although his mood had not completely recovered yet, he still couldn’t help but feel happy. He took the pen and signed his name which was written like the flying dragon and Phoenix.</p><p>The little girl solemnly put away her notebook and waved goodbye to him while wearing a big smile. She took a few steps and the suddenly turned around, dragging her luggage. She laughed while saying,</p><p>“Hero Lou, you need to practice your writing ~!”</p><p>Lou Cheng froze there for two seconds and watched her run away. Until then, he came to God and thought to himself, <em>“My calligraphy isn’t so bad. It is fairly good. Well, not like a writer whose pen name is very long, if compared to that my calligraphy was as bad as a primary student’s.”</em></p><p>He then complained about this issue to Yan Zheke, which made her laugh for a long time. At last, she sent a “laughing while covering the mouth” and said, “Cheng, you will become more and more famous in the future. It’s time for you to buy a pair of plain glasses to cover your face just like movie stars. I don’t like that there were a bunch of onlookers around us when we were together in public.”</p><p>After saying this, she sent a “touching the round bulging belly and exhaling” emoji before adding, “It also doesn’t make sense. If you really did that, the following day the rumors would be spread through the campus like wild fire. It would be like the time that leader of martial arts, named Lou, was brutally dumped by his girlfriend. The muscle man defeated by an intellectual with glasses.”</p><p>Puff… Lou Cheng laughed aloud, then he felt a warmth within his heart</p><p><em>Ever since last night, Ke has been trying to cheer me up because she wants to resolve my depression.</em></p><p><em>How could I not notice what’s in her warm mind?</em></p><p>Walking out of the train station, he decided not to take the bus and, instead, took an illegal taxi because he wanted to get home as soon as possible.</p><p>On the way home, one of the ideas he had entertained became clear after the experience with his master, and that was to buy his parents a house, a house in Xiushan!</p><p>Cherish the time with our parents and treat our parents well when they are alive!</p><p>Love the one you’re with now! This was what his experience had taught him to be the most significant.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
