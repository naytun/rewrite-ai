Even though he was a professional Ninth Pin fighter, he had problem visualizing and thus was unable to utilize his internal training to reduce the impact of the detonation. He collapsed to the ground, an incessant buzzing filling his head. The only sensation he felt was a soft, cushy surface that rose up and down. It turned him round and round, causing him to break out in cold sweat and making him nauseous.</p><p>The referee watched as Liu Xunzhe trembled and even twitched on the ground and closed his eyes, a kind expression taking over his face. He nodded at Lou Cheng, raised his right hand, and made the announcement.</p><p>“Second round: Lou Cheng wins!”</p><p>The audience broke into an uproar. The reason why the majority paid any attention to this match at all was due to the seeded player. The audience were anticipating a good show of Liu Xunzhen’s power, but unexpectedly an ordinary, unknown contestant pulled an upset win. The contestant only used less than a minute to end the match, overturning the seed.</p><p>“Lou Cheng?”</p><p>“Who is he?”</p><p>“Why is he so strong?”</p><p>These thoughts were echoed in the minds of many in the audience. They were eager to learn about this young warrior. Viewers watching both on the TV and computer screens had already heard Lou Cheng’s introduction, so they could only take their own phones and type furiously on their keyboards. This was the so-called artificial intelligence, yes, artificial plus intelligence.</p><p>In that instant, except for the whooping, there were very limited cheering and applause in the venue.</p><p>“He won just like that?” Lou Cheng’s mother Qi Fang was the kind of person who watches for fun. She was simply happy to see his son defeating who they called the seed. She did not quite understand how, she only thought her son was really fast and agile.</p><p>“Uhh… ” Jiang Fei, Cheng Qili, and Tao Xiaofei were too dumbfounded to answer.</p><p>While they did fantasized about Lou Cheng winning, but they did not expect him to win so quickly and seemingly so effortlessly!</p><p>Cheng’s power was beyond any of their imagination.</p><p>While the opponent was still covering up his shame after an inexplicable defeat, the viewers of their match found it pretty creepy. Yet if Lou Cheng but if he allowed himself to be played on his opponent’s pace, regular folks in the audience would find it difficult to understand the true extent of his invisible power. They would also find it difficult to emphasize with the danger that was akin to walking on a tightrope. Thus, after the embarrassing opening for Lou Cheng, his opponent Liu Xunzhen was basically defeated without any resistance and gave him an easy win.</p><p>“Didn’t they say the Seeded fighter is a popular choice to win the tournament?” Lou Zhisheng was excited for his son’s victory, yet he could not contain the curiosity and doubt in his mind at the same time.</p><p>“That’s because Brother Lou Cheng brother is more powerful! He’s even more likely to win the tournament hottest!” Qi Yunfei exclaimed, her eyes still firmly glued on the big screen.</p><p>Beside her, Ma Xi and Chen Xiaoxiao nodded enthusiastically.</p><p>In their match earlier, Lou Cheng’s movements and attacks when his Dan stage exploded were so fast that the unprepared close-up camera could not keep up with him. Thus the audience was only given a bird-eye view of the match, getting just one glimpse of the whole picture. The details were temporarily lost to them and it made not much difference with them just directly staring at the arena.</p><p>Only when the close-up and slow motion playback ended, did the three girls see how Lou Cheng’s muscles bulged after his Dan outbreak. His fascia protruded and he actually, incredibly, became taller. It made him look regal, full of strength, and very manly.</p><p>Yes, very manly.</p><p>“He’s an even more popular candidate to win the tournament… ” Cao Lele clutched his mouth as she whispered to herself. Qiu Hailin seemed unsure, but there was an inexplicable excitement on her face.</p><p>…</p><p>“Sextuple Explosion… ” The hands Zhang Zhutong put in his pocket subconsciously turned into two fists. He turned around to look at Han Zhifei, Qiu Lin, and the other top five seeds, noticing from their expressions they were as shocked as he was.</p><p>There was not much difference between the Seventh and Eighth Pin in Dan stage. But for a person to rise so quickly through the ranks, there must be something in him that was greatly enhanced. It could be that he learned some tricks, such as successfully pulling off Sextuple, Septuple, Octuple Explosion, or having such fine control of his body that he could manipulate even the most subtle of places, or refining his speed to a point where it exceeded human limits…</p><p>Taken together, they were astonished at Lou Cheng’s Sextuple Explosion. They were surprised that a guy who had yet to enter the Dan stage would be this level, but they were far from being fearful of this so-called black horse.</p><p>It was the same for the warriors whose fighting powers were almost equal to the Seventh Pin.</p><p>Of course, it was not difficult for them to notice some things. Only one thought was in their heads.</p><p>If they were to meet Lou Cheng in a knockout match, then it would be best to encounter him as soon as possible!</p><p>Lou Cheng was very, very close to reach the Dan stage. If given some more fighting opportunities, he might really ascend to the Eighth Pin. If they did not take advantage of his current flaws now, when would be a better time?</p><p>More importantly, his physical metamorphosis had been intuitively revealed. In the compact schedule of the tournament, the further his fight was, the more obvious his advantage would be!</p><p>He really was a monster…</p><p>Zhang Zhutong’s glamorous female companion looked around, not completely grasping their reactions. She only understood that the young warrior in the ring looked powerful, seemingly enough to be dubbed a rival.</p><p>…</p><p>“Sextuple Explosion?” Gu Shuang’s mouth was perfectly cherry-shaped, but at the moment had become O-shaped.</p><p>Even though she did not practice martial arts and only took some physical fitness exercises classes, her close friends Yan Zheke and Xing Jingjing were closely involved in it. She was more or less influenced by them, so she naturally understood what the outbreak of Dan stage meant, as well as what successive explosion were.</p><p>It seemed that the majority of Eighth Pin Dan stage was not capable of doing Sextuple Explosion?</p><p>Xing Jingjing pressed her lips tightly together and nodded after a while. “Yes.”</p><p>“That’s so awesome… ” Gu Shuang sighed, and then shivered. “Ke’s man is so powerful. Sister Jingjing, will you still be able to educate him? How?”</p><p>She did not want her friend to be educated in return!</p><p>Xing Jingjing responded with a poker face.</p><p>“My ability is really different from Liu Xunzhen’s… ”</p><p>…</p><p>Holding her computer, Yan Zheke was curled up in bed while she watched the match. When she saw that Lou Cheng had actually completed his preliminary strength of the force, she was first stunned and then harrumphed, in both happiness and anger.</p><p>“You didn’t tell me!”</p><p>She snickered in her mind, thinking that foolish Cheng wanted to give her a surprise.</p><p>But it was truthfully quite a surprise…</p><p>Her worries began to fade as the match went on. Instead, her eyes gradually became wider and wider, just like brightly flashing stars.</p><p>“Sextuple Explosion… ” She whispered to herself, proud and joyful.</p><p>Her cell phone then rang. She picked it up and saw that it was a text from Li Liantong. She found it both curious and funny, so she replied with one word: “Leave.” In her mind, she thought that Dirty Tong was really too dirty.</p><p>…</p><p>In Lou Cheng’s fans forum, user Unparalleled Dragon King was surprisingly the first to post. He tagged users Eternal Nightfall, Brahman, The Wonton Seller, and the others.</p><p>“It’s still that familiar Lou Cheng! His strength improves so unbelievably fast. Again and again, he creates a miracle… He reminds me of the original Warrior Sage Challenge Tournament. He also makes me believe it’s very possible he’ll become the Mighty One with physical invulnerability!”</p><p>“Haha, when my idol joins the Longhu Club, his left hand will be ice, his right will be fire. That’ll be perfect!” User Brahman was still persistent with her dream.</p><p>User Eternal Nightfall laughed. “Hahaha, how can my eyes be wrong?”</p><p>“Oh and congratulations for getting a new skill: female intuition,” user Unparalleled Dragon King chimed in.</p><p>As the match was broadcasted through Xing Province Satelitte Television, they saw the increase of people in the forum after a long stagnation.</p><p>…</p><p>After the referee announced the results of the match, Lou Cheng looked at Liu Xunzhen who was trembling on the ground. Without saying anything, he turned around and walked off the arena.</p><p>At first, he promised he would not rely on Jindan to test his own strength. He ended up borrowing a little of that power, or else he could only complete Quintuple Explosion and not be able to end the match so easily.</p><p>After understanding the reason to fight and finding his source of strength, he tempered and improved his will power in martial arts to make breakthrough of spirit force; while for the physical strength, which he had been tempering to his extreme through Jindan, he was much better than warriors at the same level, and was at abnormally high level even without Jindan now.</p><p>With these two, he was able to complete Quadruple Explosion without Jindan even though he was still not completely at Dan stage.</p><p>Yes, that was Quadruple Explosion. It was a number he estimated. His Jindan will have to restore its strength and coordinate with his spirit to continue the rest of the bursts.</p><p>But when he actually tried it out, Lou Cheng found there were mysteries to the Force Concentration completed via Circulating Balance. The burden on his body was not quite as heavy. That was why he could complete the Quintuple Explosion.</p><p>Many factors had contributed to the scene just now!</p><p>…</p><p>At Xing Province television broadcast studio, the host could not help exclaiming.</p><p>“Fantastic! I’ve not seen anyone who could defeat Liu Xunzhen so easily in the past few years! Really powerful! Our Xing Province martial arts circle has an heir now.”</p><p>Next to him, Yu Hong shook his hand and said, “It really wasn’t easy.”</p><p>He would give anyone who dared to say doing Sextuple Explosion was easy a taste of his medicine!</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes. But no matter what, he’s very powerful, very miraculous,” the host excitedly answered. “We’ll go to the on-scene reporter and see her interview Lou Cheng.”</p><p>…</p><p>Wei Renjie watched the match with a dumbfounded expression and only recovered after a while. He then noticed Lou Cheng stopped by a group of reporters. An idea flashed in his mind. He smiled and said to Wu Ting, “Tingting, aren’t you going to congratulate your coach?”</p><p>“Oh, that’s right!” Wu Ting jumped up in excitement and pulled Zhang Qiufan and her other friends to go with her.</p><p>Wei Renjie adjusted his clothes and followed after them.</p><p>At this moment, he forgot Sun Yixing, who was still immersed in shock.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
