Even if it was 8 a.m., it was still intolerable and overbearing to many people.</p><p>After knowing that his rival in the Top 32 Knockout was Xing Jingjing, Lou Cheng’s mind started to turn and he recalled the content that Yan Zheke had described.</p><p>This friend of his girlfriend had the supernatural ability to affect the surrounding air. She could manipulate what her opponent saw and heard. This would result in a hallucination effect.</p><p>It seemed like it could be countered by Absolute Reaction… Lou Cheng mumbled under his breath. Then he laughed softly and said, “Ke, hehe, Coach Yan, do you have any video clips of Sister Jingjing’s fights?”</p><p>“Yes. I have some, but I don’t think they will be of much use… Last year, Sister Jingjing only took part in the University Martial Arts Competition. Plus Huahai had Ann Chaoyang, the Seventh-Pin lead fighter, so her chance to fight an opponent with Dan stage, never came. I don’t think any of the fights she had with other Professional Ninth-Pin fighters would make a good reference for you… ” Yan Zheke answered as she thought about the possibilities.</p><p>A year before Peng Leyun entered Shanbei University, Huahai University was the champion of the National University Martial Arts Competitions. Their foundation was strong, and they had many Mighty Ones. Even now, Ann Chaoyang who was in the fourth year was considered a martial arts prodigy along with Peng Leyun and Ren Li. Also, because he always looked sleepy, people called him “Powerful Sleepy Tiger.” It was said that he was racing towards the Sixth-Pin.</p><p>“Hmm, but we should still take a look at it. This will give me an objective and clear impression of her supernatural ability. If I were to lose to her on this end, how am I going to face everyone? How am I going to be able to face your gang of best friends?” Lou Cheng said humorously.</p><p>“Oh, true… Cheng, today I’m not going to root for you… ” Yan Zheke’s tone became faster and lighter. “If you lose to Sister Jingjing, I think I can laugh at you for at least half a year. ”</p><p>Having said this, she added another point seriously, “Don’t be careless. I think that, maybe, Absolute Reaction, is not that reliable or effective against her.”</p><p>“Huh?” Lou Cheng was filled with shock and suspicion.</p><p>“Think about it. What’s the basic principle of Absolute Reaction?” Yan Zheke said softly in a deep tone.</p><p>Lou Cheng started thinking about the things he had learned and seen. “After a fighter has trained to the finest details, and all the strength within their body is under their complete control. Adding in the combination of spirit, qi, and blood makes the body becomes sensitive to the surrounding energy. No matter what moves the opponent tries to throw out, regardless of whether they are prepared or have a line of sight, the fighter will sense the incoming attack. This is what we call Absolute Reaction.”</p><p>“So, what do they use to sense the disturbance?” Yan Zheke was leading him on.</p><p>“Air… ” Lou Cheng suck in a breath uncontrollably.</p><p>Considering this, it was completely plausible that Xing Jingjing’s supernatural ability would affect the execution of Absolute Reaction…</p><p><em>This is not going to be an easy fight…</em></p><p>At that moment, the first thing Lou Cheng thought about was a special characteristic of the Jindan. The special ability that helped Lou Cheng sense Zhan Xuming getting closer. This could possibly block the supernatural ability of Xing Jingjing. However, he thought about it again and decided to give up on that idea. This was because it would have gone against his original plan and principle. He did not want to rely on the Jindan, but to fight using his own strength and ability.</p><p>During the battle with Liu Xunzhen yesterday, he did use the Jindan right at the end to recover from his fatigue, but at that time, the game was already set. He had already won, so there was no impact on the match. If he did not use it, it would just mean a little extra trouble after the match.</p><p>However, if he was to rely on the Jindan this round, it would not be interesting at all.</p><p>He had to think carefully about how to fight in the next round… Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke exchanged some warm words before they ended the call. He took off his clothes and stood under the flowing water in the shower, his thoughts flying everywhere and his mind churning the whole time.</p><p>…</p><p>One side was her boyfriend, the other side, her best friend. Yan Zheke was somewhat troubled by this situation. After the call, she sat on her bed, with her feet tucked under. She thought about the battle in the morning.</p><p><em>Whose side should I stand on?</em></p><p>Just at this moment, someone knocked on the door. She quickly changed the way she was sitting. She sat nicely with her legs crossed in front of her and said, “Who’s there? Sister Linxi?”</p><p>She could somehow recognize the footsteps of her cousin, Ji Linxi.</p><p>“Your ears are good!” Ji Linxi opened the door and stood there smiling, while leaning against the door frame. “We’re heading out to the sea to have some fun. Want to come along?”</p><p>She was half a head taller than Yan Zheke. Her looks could be considered as better than average and she looked resembled a younger version of Ji Mingyu, as compared to her younger cousin.</p><p>“No, not going. Not fun at all. I don’t like those gatherings, they are too loud and messy.” Yan Zheke’s pretty brows scrunched together a little.</p><p>To be honest, taking Grandpa’s yacht out to sea and enjoying the clear blue skies would really lift her spirits. It would also help her relax. If there were some fish around, she could even have a chat with them. It would be interesting.</p><p>But now, without Lou Cheng to keep her company, she did not care about these activities. Plus her cousin invited her friends and they would be having a different kind of gathering and party in Shanghai. Since she did not like such gatherings, she decided to reject it.</p><p>Ji Linxi laughed heartily and said, “I see, a lot of boys will be disappointed. They are all waiting for our pretty and demure lady.”</p><p>Because Yan Zheke’s father had good genes, in this generation of the Ji Family, Yan Zheke’s looks were top of the top. In addition, she was always gentle and had the aura of a scholarly person.</p><p>“Demure? When was I ever demure?” Yan Zheke burst out laughing.</p><p><em>Yup, I’ve got to let Cheng know that people have praised me for being demure!</em></p><p>“You’re always quiet and demure when we have dinners and gatherings! You never talk!” Ji Linxi laughed. “Alright, it’s fine if you don’t go. Just go shopping with me when I’m back.”</p><p>“Ah… ” Yan Zheke frowned.</p><p><em>This was not a simple task at all!</em></p><p>After she bid her cousin goodbye without moving an inch, she remembered the conversation that they had just now. Then suddenly, she realized, within those few sentences she had actually “nagged” at Lou Cheng twice…</p><p>Thinking about her earlier dilemma again, she already knew the answer, so she smiled and mumbled to herself,</p><p>“Sorry, Sister Jingjing!”</p><p><em>I would totally ditch friends for a guy!</em></p><p>…</p><p>He jogged slowly into the arena. Lou Cheng stopped in front of the large screen to confirm the fights.</p><p>“Center arena, morning, fourth match, number 18, Lou Cheng, 19 years old, Professional Ninth Pin vs. number 79, Xing Jingjing, 20 years old, Professional Ninth Pin.”</p><p>Fourth match… Lou Cheng was just about to leave the screen when a girl suddenly appeared next to him wearing professional clothes. Grinning, she smiled and said, “Mr. Lou Cheng, right?”</p><p>“Right, anything I can help you with?” Lou Cheng asked curiously.</p><p>“Fang Siqi, staff from the committee of this youth competition.” The professional looking lady’s smile was as refreshing as the spring breeze. “I’ll bring you to your lounge.”</p><p>“My lounge?” asked Lou Cheng. He heard her and became a little confused. He insisted on seeing her documents and name tag before he was convinced.</p><p>Fang Siqi smiled and answered, “You’ll understand once you’re there.”</p><p>She stretched out her hand and signaled for him to join her. She brought Lou Cheng through the arena. When they reached the other end of the arena, they entered a lounge with many rooms.</p><p>“Mr. Lou Cheng, we have a quiet room for you, with a viewing room, a wood figure room, a massage room, a water therapy room, and a shower room… They could help you relax and recover before or after the competition… You can choose any of those without a label… ” Fang Siqi explained in detail.</p><p>Lou Cheng seemed to remember something. He asked, “Is this the VIP lounge for seeded fighters?”</p><p>“Yes, you’ve sufficient rights to be here.” Fang Siqi answered humbly.</p><p>If Lou Cheng was already 24 or 25 years old, even if he was performing as extraordinarily well as he is currently, a black horse, the lead of Committee would still not make such an arrangement. Everyone was working on principle, so they had no fear of offending someone.</p><p>However, a 19-year-old fighter of Dan stage, with less than one year experience in Dan stage, raised their expectations on how much more he could develop. So they couldn’t miss this chance to make a good impression. It was normal in this line of work.</p><p>“I understand.” Lou Cheng nodded his head and did not say anything else.</p><p>After he had mentioned this to Yan Zheke, he suddenly felt some more pressure.</p><p>He just managed to get into the VIP lounge. If in the next match he was beaten by Xing Jingjing, it would be quite embarrassing!</p><p>…</p><p>Starting from the Top 32, the only fights remaining would be in the center arena. 16 matches, eight in the morning, eight in the afternoon, with some minor programs in between.</p><p>This also meant that all the remaining matches would be broadcast!</p><p>Seeing the television crew get ready, Wei Renjie smiled at Chu Weicai and Sun Yixing. He said, “If Lou Cheng wins another two or three rounds, our name, our brand, Xiushan would be known by all… Such a pity that he doesn’t have time to take part in the preliminaries… ”</p><p>Sun Yixing had already confirmed Lou Cheng’s physical and mental condition with Chu Weicai. He did not have the slightest bit of jealousy. He earnestly said, “If he could take part, with the state our province is in, maybe we’d have hope in getting into the second round of the preliminaries.”</p><p>He simply could not even think of protesting. He had no benefits to offer and no chance of persuading such a genius.</p><p>Of course, comparing them would also injure his pride. Especially with Wei Renjie repeatedly mentioning Lou Cheng. Sun Yixing was facing a great amount of pressure and jealousy.</p><p>“Lou Cheng’s future is not at Xiushan… ” Chu Wei said, half sighing.</p><p>After yesterday, together with Lou Cheng, the name of Gushan Martial Arts School was a black horse that everyone in the province knew of. His promotional value was definitely more than a million!</p><p>This was the advantage of being friends first!</p><p>Wei Renjie listened intently and felt a surge of emotions. “Yes, you’re right. The pond is too small for such a big fish.”</p><p>…</p><p>A few matches later, Lou Cheng finally received a signal from the staff to leave his lounge. He walked out, and with many pairs of eyes staring at him, he stepped up on to the arena. Xing Jingjing was already standing there. She was wearing a black martial arts suit, making her skin look even fairer and colder.</p><p>Seeing her, Lou Cheng suddenly thought of something his girlfriend had said earlier.</p><p>Sister Jingjing’s supernatural ability stemmed from fear and the desire to avoid danger.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
