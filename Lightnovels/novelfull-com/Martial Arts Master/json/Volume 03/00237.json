Afterwards, they decided to arrange an impromptu date. They saw a movie, hung out in a bookstore, strolled down the street, chased little kids, and ate some food.</p><p>At the end of it all, Yan Zheke, who was in high spirits, went and took two exclusive seats in a children’s carousel. Looking at Lou Cheng and laughing, she took out her phone and took quite a few photographs of herself at that moment.</p><p>Since this wasn’t a private occasion, the two of them absolutely couldn’t snuggle or whisper sweet nothings to one another. It was only in the movie theatre that they could lean against each other, ear to ear and temple to temple. However, even with the situation like it was, Lou Cheng didn’t feel any kind of regret or dissatisfaction. He was happy, fulfilled, and filled with abundant joy and happiness all at once.</p><p>Of course, at his age, if there was an opportunity to be more intimate he thought it would be even better.</p><p>Just as the two of them were discussing going to Old Liu Barbeque for dinner, Yan Zheke got a call from Empress Dowager.</p><p>After talking for a moment, she put away her phone. Wrinkling her nose, she said, “Empress Dowager wants me to come back home for dinner. It’s like she knows I’m with you, but she didn’t say anything… ”</p><p><em>Actually, it doesn’t take a genius to figure out who I’d suddenly come to Xiushan for, particularly given how smart and experienced the Empress Dowager was..</em></p><p>“Empress Dowager has been around the block and knows that a little tact is called for. Where there’s oppression, there’s resistance.” Lou Cheng started to joke. He could guess roughly what Empress Dowager was thinking. She wouldn’t forbid him and Ke from going out together, she’d just prevent them from going out too often. It’s like they said: dry, sweltering heat caused young boys and girls full of vigor to wear thin clothing. If you weren’t careful, it was a recipe for disaster.</p><p>Of course, this is all built on the idea that Empress Dowager doesn’t understand me. There really is no need for her to be worried, I’ll respect Ke. Out of respect for both of their futures, I’m willing to restrain myself.</p><p>“Mmm, I need to get back and make the Empress Dowager happy. Give her a back and shoulder massage, stuff like that.” Yan Zheke half-jokingly sighed as she sensed her mother’s machinations. She batted her eyes and with shining pupils looked at Lou Cheng. “Are you going to give me some rice dumplings tomorrow?”</p><p>“Absolutely!” Lou Cheng answered without any hesitation.</p><p>Yan Zheke let a laugh escape and with a soft gaze said, “It’s a shame that I won’t eat them tomorrow.”</p><p>“Eh?” Lou Cheng was bewildered.</p><p>Yet you still ask!</p><p><em>Hehe, teasing Cheng is too fun! Yan Zheke giggled, ”</em> Empress Dowager said once the morning is over she’ll take me to eat some Yunshui family noodles. They opened a shop close to the hospital that my father worked at before. It’s a big part of my memories. It’s too bad, they moved and we didn’t know where to, but recently it was rediscovered by the Empress Dowager.”</p><p>“Can I go ‘accidentally’ run into you?” Lou Cheng said with a grin.</p><p>“Sure! All you need is not to be afraid of confronting Empress Dowager!” Yan Zheke replied, her face full of laughter.</p><p>Thinking about Empress Dowager’s imposing manner, Lou Cheng wiped the nonexistent cold sweat on his forehead and said, “This… all son-in-laws are afraid of their mother-in-laws!”</p><p>Yan Zheke laughed, “Alright then! Actually, I’m not sure where exactly that shop is located either. Wait until we go tomorrow and then Big Sister will bring you there!”</p><p>“Okay.” Lou Cheng thought for a moment and said again, “In that case, should I give you rice dumplings two days from now?”</p><p>“No need.” Yan Zheke said with a smile, “Empress Dowager is going on a business trip tomorrow night. She’s busy with a big project and won’t be back for a few days. We can do morning exercises together, and eat rice dumplings together!”</p><p>“Alright!” Lou Cheng was instantly full of anticipation.</p><p>After getting their luggage, he booked a car online. On the way, he dropped off Yan Zheke at the entrance to her neighborhood. It was a quiet oasis in the midst of the chaos, located at a villa in a small neighborhood facing a lake behind the business district.</p><p>After reluctantly parting ways, Lou Cheng remembered to give his Mom a call.</p><p>“Mom, I’m on my way back to eat!” he stressed this point.</p><p>Qi Fang replied with irritation, “You didn’t say anything before, my foods all done steaming, and there’s nothing for you.”</p><p>“Oh… ” Lou Cheng was dumbstruck as he came to the profound realization that perhaps she was not his ‘Mommy’ anymore.</p><p>Sensing Lou Cheng’s lifelessness, Qi Fang laughed, “Feifei wants to eat some Old Huang’s sliced chicken. Go buy some, and while you’re at it, order some for yourself.”</p><p>“Okay!” Lou Cheng stretched out the word, conveying his happiness.</p><p>The sliced chicken had been Xiushan’s specialty throughout the ages. During Lou Cheng’s childhood when supplies weren’t particularly plentiful, an ordinary household would want to eat chicken, but this was quite a luxury, and the sliced chicken came about as a result. Vendors took chicken meat, boiled it, then cut it into slices and soaked it in a red sauce broth. Walking through the strings of alleyways, pressed for cash, even the greediest children would reach out and scrounge up enough money for two or three pieces, enough to satisfy their appetite. This was one of the most beautiful memories from Lou Cheng’s childhood.</p><p>Nowadays, as long as it wasn’t a hard-up household, eating a chicken every once in a while was still feasible, and sliced chicken had step by step withdrawn from the pages of history. Now there was only the “Old Huang Shop” because they were meticulous about their ingredients. Their enticing flavors and appetizing freshness had caused them to become a steady vendor, making both stewed and cold dishes.</p><p>Snapping a photo of the food and giving Yan Zheke a look, Lou Cheng carried it back home and waited for Qi Fang to say it was dinnertime.</p><p>Half-full from eating, Qi Fang asked, “What have you been doing out there for the past few days?”</p><p>“Haven’t I told you? I’ve got a classmate, I’m working part-time at his masters Martial Arts School.” Lou Cheng poured juice onto the sliced chicken and mixed it together.</p><p>Lou Zhisheng stopped using his chopsticks, and he drank a mouthful of Ningshui county’s original hardproof liquor, “Just like that, you’ve already started working? A week and a few days?”</p><p>“Monday, Wednesday, and Friday mornings from 9 to noon, but there are a lot of times where I’ll stay at the school and borrow their Strength Training Gym to train or give the disciples some guidance.” Lou Cheng hadn’t thought about how him not at home very often would make his Mother and Father feel insecure.</p><p>A large part of that time had been spent going on a date…</p><p>“That’s good, what a relief.” Qi Fang sighed. She had been afraid that her son would run himself ragged for the sake of making money. Half because she was curious and half because she blurted it out without thinking, she asked, “In that case, how much could you make in a month?”</p><p>Anytime the topic of money is brought up, it piques everyone’s curiosity. Not only did Lou Zhisheng glance over, even Qi Yunfei who was busy chewing chicken turned her head, full of interest in her male cousin.</p><p>“Umm… ” Lou Cheng hesitated for a moment, but then calmly replied, “They’re giving me more than 50,000 yuan for two months.”</p><p>He hadn’t figured in his one-on-one coaching fee. Even though at the moment only Qin Rui had signed up, he believed after he was upgraded, other disciples and ambitious martial arts students also wouldn’t be able to resist coming and trying it out.</p><p>“50,000?” Qi Fang’s chopsticks stopped in mid-air. Lou Zhisheng’s food touched his lips but he forgot to put it inside his mouth. Only Qu Yunfei, who had heard about Ding Yanbo being upgraded, seemed as if she had been prepared.</p><p>“Yeah.” Lou Cheng nodded.</p><p>Qi Fang blurted out, “Cheng, are you messing with us? You only have to work three afternoons a week, and for two months they’ll give you more than 50,000?”</p><p>According to her view of her son, what had he done in order to deserve this? It wasn’t like he was a magical warrior that could split thunder and fling fire like those on television!</p><p>“How is that possible? Gushan Martial Arts School has been open for quite a few years!” The retort came from Qi Yunfei, but she already knew.</p><p>Lou Cheng said with a laugh, “Mom, relax. You can go ask around. That’s about what a peak Professional Ninth Pin can earn every month. Although Gushan Martial Arts School is certainly being considerate, it’s not over the top.”</p><p>“Really?” Qi Fang’s face was still full of suspicion.</p><p>It was a great thing, but it made other people unwilling to believe it!</p><p>Lou Zhisheng put down his drinking glass and said steadily, “Slow down. I’ve heard people say that a professional fighter’s salary is quite good. Cheng, did you sign a contract? Nowadays it’s impossible to protect yourself without one!”</p><p>This was a lesson he had learned the hard way. Before when he had gone out to work part time, at first it was all done through friends and acquaintances, so everyone felt awkward when it came to contracts. As a result, a large amount of his salary hadn’t been paid, and even now some of it had still not been given to him.</p><p>“I’ve signed one. Dad, relax. They wouldn’t dare try to play me like that.” Lou Cheng answered with a chuckle.</p><p>In addition to his master, just in the Xiushan locality alone, Chief Xing could also make life difficult for the Gushan Martial Arts School. Furthermore, he himself could also play dirty, kick the door down and smash up their signs.</p><p>“The contracts over there? Let me see.” Lou Zhisheng still wasn’t completely at ease.</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled and shook his head. He turned back to his room, found the contract, and handed it over to his Dad.</p><p>Was this the Lou family version of being once bitten, twice shy? As this thought floated in his mind, Lou Cheng didn’t merely think it was funny, but also felt that he loved his Father dearly.</p><p>After this you won’t have to work so hard and go through so much toil!</p><p>Lou Zhisheng looked carefully and then passed it to Qi Fang who had come over. He breathed a satisfied sigh of relief,</p><p>“Not bad, not bad. You’ve grown up and become a man. Your mother and I with our salaries and lucky bonuses put together can make about 80,000 yuan after it’s all said and done. And that’s on a good year. In two months, you make what I can in the better part of half a year… ”</p><p>He was emotional and was getting a bit long-winded. Qi Fang keenly interrupted and said, “What’s the one-on-one coaching fee?”</p><p>“It’s just a bit of special attention, making up a class with just one student,” Lou Cheng answered simply, afraid that his Mom wouldn’t understand if he spoke too professionally.</p><p>When bringing up make up classes, Qi Fang understood, “Is it calculated by number of classes, or by the hour?”</p><p>“By the hour, 800 per hour.” Lou Cheng explained truthfully.</p><p>“Wow, 800 for one hour, 8 hours in a day would be 6,400, and one month would be more than 190,000. Cheng, you’ve really grown up!” Qi Fang was beaming.</p><p>Lou Cheng stared at her sluggishly, “Mom, your math is so good… ”</p><p>The first point was that it was impossible that many people would ask for instruction. The second was that there were still other things that had to be done, for example, a martial arts group would often have to attend class. After he was done explaining, Qi Fang was a little bit regretful for how she’d originally behaved, and brought up Lou Cheng’s cousin Lou Yuanwei. Apparently, he had behaved himself for about half a year, but now he again was making a fuss about starting up his own business.</p><p>As soon as they were finished eating and Lou Cheng’s Mother and Father went out for a stroll, Qi Yunfei leaped in front of Lou Cheng, and with her eyes twinkling said,</p><p>“Brother Lou Cheng, you’re so awesome!”</p><p>“Get to the point.” Lou Cheng eyes were like torches.</p><p>“Hehe, it’s still three months until my birthday. Since you’ve got that much money, shouldn’t you give me an ‘interesting’ gift?” Qi Yunfei said deviously.</p><p>Lou Cheng, smiled faintly, “I’ll have to look at your behavior. If you’re too absorbed in love and don’t feel like studying…. heh… you understand.”</p><p>Qi Yunfei nodded, and signed heavily. “I’m really jealous that you can earn this much money while in college. All I can do is to rely on my Mom and Dad. I have to save up a bit if I want to do anything.”</p><p>“It’s good that you’re aware of your jealousy. Just study hard. In the future you’ll be able to make some money, and there’s hope you can become independent in your financial affairs.” Lou Cheng used the new word that he had learned.</p><p>Qi Yunfei could only shoot him a glance, “Brother Lou Cheng, you’re sound more and more like an old man, seizing any available opportunity to educate people!”</p><p>Lou Cheng thought for a moment and chuckled, “Perhaps my attitude has changed… ”</p><p>He no longer was a naive and innocent youth. Instead, he hoped that he could assume some responsibilities, shoulder some burdens, and be a man that could protect a certain female.</p><p>Qi Yunfei earnestly sized him up. After quite some time she smiled sweetly, “Actually, you were pretty handsome just then Brother Lou Cheng. If you weren’t my brother, I couldn’t say for sure whether I’d like you or not!”</p><p>Lou Cheng tsked,</p><p>“If you weren’t my sister, I wouldn’t give you a second glance!”</p><p>Finished speaking, he looked up and laughed, taking his pajamas and other toiletries and heading to take a shower.</p><p>Qi Yunfei was frozen in place. After a few seconds she gritted her teeth,</p><p>“What a lovely mood he’s in!”</p><p>…</p><p>Early next morning, Lou Cheng drank some medicine and jogged to the park. He wanted to experiment with the indescribable early stages of the “Absolute Reaction” that had happened before. Through the use of the Jindan, he wanted to seize the Cultivation trait and see how he could integrate it into his martial arts, and see if he could start to open up what he could call his own path.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
