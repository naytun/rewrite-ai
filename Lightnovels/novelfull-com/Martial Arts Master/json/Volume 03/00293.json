He also made a backup of the valuable things on his computer. He even did some household chores.</p><p>After he completing the chores, his mother, Qi Fang, slowly came back from the community office. The moment she walked into the house, she saw the clean coffee table, so she looked at her son suspiciously and just found him standing there proudly like he was waiting to be praised. She blurted out,</p><p>“Cheng, what has happened to you?”</p><p>“Nothing’s wrong.” Lou Cheng denied, “While I’m in school, don’t I still need to clean up my dormitory? I didn’t have anything else to do just now so it was more of an impulse.”</p><p>Qi Fang didn’t pay much attention to his words. At first, she smiled with satisfaction, but then she began to complain, “You, as my child, how could you not tell us that you will go to visit your sect officially, in advance! We had no time to prepare specialties for your master. That was very impolite. What’s more, I know that your master is great, so he may have looked down upon our little gifts. But, we still had to express our appreciations to him. In some TV series, some people say that it’s not the gift that counts but the thought itself.”</p><p>“Mom, that was because my sect held the ceremony too quickly. And, be easy, I helped you prepare the specialty for my master, the four bottles of hard liquor from Ningshui County that were the original-proof spirits. My master was very satisfied. He liked the liquor very much.” Lou Cheng comforted his mother with a smile.</p><p><em>Or, was this because your daughter-in-law is very considerate?</em></p><p>Qi Fang looked him up and down, revealing a suspicious look, “When did you become so thoughtful… ”</p><p>Although her son had grown up and become mature, it was still hard for her to comprehend the details of these interpersonal communications with himself.</p><p><em>But, I didn’t even have time to teach him that!</em></p><p>As for his father, well, it would have been great if he hadn’t neglected those details!</p><p>“Yes, uh, thanks to you. You influenced me by your words and deeds.” Lou Cheng flattered his mother, ignoring his own consciousness, which made Qi Fang feel very happy. She walked into the kitchen and began to prepare dinner.</p><p>Lou Cheng stopped himself from telling his mother about his plan to buy her a house. He decided to wait for his dad to arrive and bring it up while they were chatting over dinner. Bringing it up he started solemnly, “Mom, dad, you can you find time to look at the real estate around our house? Something that is within a three year period. ”</p><p>“What?” Qi Fang replied confused.</p><p>Lou Cheng explained it thoughtfully, “Since I won the championship I have the six hundred thousand reward. So, I was thinking that I could buy us a new house. Not to mention, our house is so small it is inconvenient to entertain guests.”</p><p>“Oh… ” Qi Fang was surprised and then laughed happily, “Cheng, I’m so glad that you are so thoughtful, but you don’t need to buy it! While we wait for another two years, we will be able to save enough money for the downpayment. Also, Fatty Guo and his family are treating your dad well and even raised his salary. He even gave him the technical bonus as well.”</p><p>Lou Zhisheng also could not resist laughing. He could barely contain his happiness and said, “Your mother is right, you are so thoughtful to offer. But, we are not so poor that we can’t save money. Six hundred thousand Yuan is a large amount of money for us in this small place, but I have also heard that you need to spend a lot of money on practicing martial arts. You shouldn’t waste your money like this, you should save it for yourself since you will need to spend plenty of money in the future.”</p><p>“Yes, Cheng, your future is bright, so you won’t be staying at ritual places like Xiushan in the future certainly. I have even heard that the housing price in big cities is quite high, more than ten thousand Yuan per square meter. So, if you want to buy a comfortable and roomy house, you wouldn’t even be able to afford the down payment with just six hundred thousand Yuan. You should just save it to marry your wife in the future.” Qi Fang said with a smile.</p><p><em>“Why the script change? How did we start talking about the housing price in big cities?”</em> Lou Cheng’s mouth twitched slightly. However, he didn’t correct his mother’s misunderstanding.</p><p>Not all the house prices were over ten thousand Yuan in the large cities.</p><p>He thought for a while. He then deliberately showed a confident posture,</p><p>“Dad, Mom, why are you talking about things so far into the future? I mean, with my current strength and level, even if I don’t make any progress in the future, I could still earn one or two million Yuan a year. Also, if I am lucky enough, I can win several championships and get the higher rewards, so, I will be earning more money than this six hundred thousand Yuan. Until then, the downpayment doesn’t mean anything to me.”</p><p>“What’s more, the housing price in Xiushan isn’t that high. You have said that the housing price nearby is only 3,500 per square meter. The housing price of the better district is only 4,000 Yuan, so if I buy you a house which is one hundred and twenty square meters, I can still have ten thousand Yuan left which is enough for my spending within two years. In addition, I can earn money by myself later… You keep your savings. Besides, don’t you plan to give it to me in the future?”</p><p>Lou Cheng couldn’t help but joke to get rid of the concerns in his parent’s minds.</p><p>Qi Fang was persuaded a bit by his words, “I also heard that the housing price of Xiushan is rather low, but it will rise later and if we don’t buy a new home now, we will be wasting more money on it in two years… ”</p><p>“This housing price is low? Xiushan is not a big city, how would its housing price rise? Maybe, it will fall later.” Lou Zhisheng shook his head in disagreement.</p><p>“But, we just want to live in the house instead of investing.” Lou Cheng added, “Don’t you feel that our house is rather small?”</p><p>“However, we have so many acquaintances in this community. They are your uncles and aunts you know. Your dad and I usually chat or play cards with them. So, if we moved to another community, we would be very bored without your company.”</p><p>“Mom, you think too much. We are going to select a new house in the surrounding buildings. After you have dinner, you could come back here by walking. What’s more, you also have to work in the community during the day.” Lou Cheng continued to persuade her.</p><p>Qi Fang stopped talking. She began to look at Lou Zhisheng and just found that he was also was pondering, instead of objecting.</p><p>“Actually, our house is small and it is inconvenient to serve our guests. In two years’ time, Cheng may come back home with his girlfriend, and we can’t make his girlfriend feel like an imposition… ” Qi Fang rambled, beginning to agree with Lou Cheng unconsciously.</p><p>Lou Zhisheng poured a little wine from the bottle and drank it in one gulp. At last, he had made a decision,</p><p>“Cheng, you only need to provide us with four hundred thousand Yuan. We will make up the rest money. Also, you should write your name on the real estate license.”</p><p>“Well, okay.” Lou Cheng could tell that his father had made up his mind and that there was no point in arguing further.</p><p>Qi Fang sighed, and soon she became excited, “Then, I will ask somebody tomorrow and look for a new house nearby through the real estate company!”</p><p>“It would be better to hire an agent to deal with this kind of thing. The person that others recommend can’t always be trusted. Wasn’t Chen Hui cheated out of over ten thousand Yuan last time?” Lou Zhisheng said seriously.</p><p>Watching his father and mother talking about the house thing so excitedly, Lou Cheng smiled by their side. He felt very happy and satisfied. All of the depression he had been feeling during the last two days had dissipated.</p><p><em>Cherish the present moment and look to the future. Try not to worry about the things that you can’t solve now and try to love the people around you!</em></p><p>After chatting for a while with his parents, Lou Cheng took out his phone and sent Yan Zheke a message,</p><p>“Ke, I plan to take four hundred thousand Yuan out from my bonus to buy my parents a new house… ”</p><p>He usually felt the need to discuss this kind of thing with Coach Yan…</p><p>Yan Zheke had heard about this plan before, so this came as no surprise. She “snickered” and said,</p><p>“That’s good. But, why are you telling me this? Deciding how you spend your money should be left up to you~!”</p><p>“I am your Cheng. Of course, I have to tell you.” Lou Cheng replied her with a “sinister” smile.</p><p>Yan Zheke gave a “rolling eyes” and said,</p><p>“So, if I do not agree with you, will you not buy it?”</p><p>“I believe you will agree with me.” Lou Cheng sent a “smile with red face” emoji.</p><p>This is the tacit understanding of a worldview, values of worth, and philosophy about life which was shared by both of them.</p><p>Yan Zheke sent a “single-hand holding her chin and looked up” emoji and said, “I mean what if?”</p><p>Lou Cheng felt the weight of her question, how was he to answer it?</p><p>This kind of tricky quandary is an eternal problem!</p><p>Just as he began to type, his girlfriend sent a “smile with a covered mouth” emoji and replied, “Are you frightened by my question? Well, you don’t need to answer me, because I will answer you. If two people have such a big contradiction on their basic values, their relationship won’t last for too long.”</p><p>“However, Cheng, I recently read many posts and Weibo, so assuming that you can only earn a few thousand Yuan per year and you are so lucky to win six hundred thousand Yuan. In addition, the house, in which your parents live, is a little old and small, so you will still take out four hundred thousand Yuan to buy them a new house even though they already have one?”</p><p>Lou Cheng thought a moment and sent a “smile bitterly” emoji, “In that case, I think I shouldn’t buy it because people need to know their limitations.”</p><p>“Yan Zheke sent a “sitting well-behaved” emoji and replied him, “So, you can see, whether the fact you are able to buy your parents a house with no psychological burden or the fact I only think that you are so kind and thoughtful for doing this instead of having other ideas, is based on our full ability and our strength. Money isn’t equal to strength, but it definitely is an important part of strength.</p><p>“Ah… I feel I have been instructed by my life instructor once again!” Lou Cheng said with sincerity.</p><p>“Hey hey.” Yan Zheke sent a “make progress” emoji, “So, young man, work harder! Try to earn more money and improve yourself!”</p><p>This is the key to solving this problem.</p><p>Seeing this sentence, Lou Cheng suddenly understood that Ke was still comforting him over the thing with his master, even though she was trying to do it indirectly. She was trying to stop me from sticking to my own decadence so that she can help me see the light and hope in life.</p><p>He smiled and sent her a “kiss” emoji,</p><p>“Yes, I’ll work hard… ”</p><p><em>From now on, show a smile.</em></p><p><em>From now on, I will not blame myself and I won’t feel helpless. Go for my goals with excitement.</em></p><p><em>From now on, I will hold a firm belief and hope.</em></p><p>At that time, he felt so firm and clear-minded, so he also made another decision. He found Wei Renjie’s phone number in his contact book, and then he called Chairman Wei, Wei Renjie.</p><p>“Hello, Lou, ah, have you already gone back to Xiushan?” Wei Renjie said with a smile.</p><p>“Yes, ah, because I have to go back to work at the martial arts dojo on time. You know, I can’t receive my salary for doing nothing.” After Lou Cheng greeted him, Lou Cheng directly got to the topic, “Chairman, I can only help with guiding their special training one day a week. You know, I am unable to teach them the martial arts from my sect, so, I can only be an instructor or be their sparring partner. That is to say, I can accomplish all this in just one day a week.”</p><p>Because he was born here, he loved the mountains, the river, and this city deeply. If he could, he still wanted to do something good for his hometown.</p><p>Wei Renjie said gladly, “Great, okay. One day is enough. Even if you just stand there and do nothing, you will be setting a good model for them.”</p><p>Today, things had become different from the past. Right now, Lou Cheng is the most powerful young fighter in our province. He ranked the first.</p><p>Lou Cheng hung up the phone and told Yan Zheke about the conversation. His mind became quiet and peaceful, as calm as the scene outside the window. Through the window, he could see some lamps shining in the darkness.</p><p><em>Tomorrow, I will do my morning exercises with Ke and practice martial arts even harder.</em></p><p><em>Tomorrow, I will take up my responsibilities by going to the martial arts school and instructing the VIP students.</em></p><p><em>Start with the small things, start from dribs and drabs!</em></p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
