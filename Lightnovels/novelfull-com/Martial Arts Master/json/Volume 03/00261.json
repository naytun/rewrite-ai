He then found a quiet place to call Yan Zheke, telling her about Gu Shuang and Xing Jingjing’s visit. He did not want her to have any negative feelings towards her close friend for causing his injuries.</p><p>After some more flirting, Yan Zheke ended the call to continue her Internal Trainning Methods of Meteor force. Slowly making his way back with one hand in his pocket, Lou Cheng suddenly thought of something when he walked past the stores. He immediately texted Jiang Fei: “Fatty Jiang, I’m outside. Do you guys want snacks? I see sausage, corn… ”</p><p>The past few days, he had been busy practicing, preparing, watching, and joining the matches. He had no time to accompany his parents and three cousins, except for meals. It was Jiang Fei and his friends who did all those for him, so he should reward them with food and drinks.</p><p>“Of course! How can there be no snacks while watching Martial Arts Competition?” Jiang Fei replied instantly and turned around to ask Qiu Hailin and Cao Lele. “What do you want to eat? Cheng says it’s his treat!”</p><p>It was akin to how most people would never watch a movie without popcorn in hand!</p><p>“Me, me, me! I want a roast sausage and a corn cob. Tell Brother Lou Cheng that I want more pepper with my sausage!” The first to reply was Qi Yunfei, who had been carefully listening to them. As she spoke, she could feel herself almost drooling. “And add a cup of iced cola!”</p><p>It must be that she was too nervous earlier!</p><p>With Qi Yunfei taking the lead, everyone else also gave up trying to be courteous. The girls ordered both, while Fatty Jiang, Cheng Qili, and Tao Xiaofei only ordered sausages. Lou Cheng’s parents were in high spirit and ordered two corns.</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled upon receiving the list of orders. He bought all food they wanted and even bought a few bottles of drinks. Lugging multiple bags, he returned to the stadium and walked to his group of families and friends through the aisle.</p><p>“Here you go, your roast sausages and corns… ” He distributed the food from left to right, a warm smile etched on his face.</p><p>His behavior gave them an odd, unbelievable feeling, as if they once again no longer recognize the Lou Cheng who was in front of them.</p><p>Even though he had come out of a battle bloodied and injured, he was now acting as if nothing had happened and was enjoying the tournament with everyone else like an ordinary person.</p><p>Was he still the gifted warrior who fought like a lion the past few days? Was he still the rising star of Xing province martial arts circle who appeared on the television?</p><p>His attitude towards family and friends was as usual, never once changing.</p><p>…</p><p>In the meeting room of Xing province TV station in the evening, a man who seemed to be the leader took out a cigarette without lighting it. He spoke in a local accent. “Since we’ve got our top 16 in the Youth Tournament, it’s time to decide the shortlist of Apotheosis of Fighters. I want to nominate 18 fighters in total, adding two more who’s particularly strong in some aspect. Do you have any opinions?”</p><p>“No, director. What nicknames do we call them this time?” a woman wearing semi-rimless glasses asked.</p><p>“I don’t have any ideas at the moment. This meeting is for everyone to brainstorm. Come on, make your suggestions.” The leader smiled while fiddling with his unlit cigarette.</p><p>A young man with a messy hair thought for a while. “Nicknames like the Four Emperors, Six Kings, Eight Immortals?”</p><p>“Four Emperors, Six Kings, Eight Immortals? What will those Mighty Ones with Physical Vulnerability who are already called kings think? Isn’t it conceited for contestants of a Youth Tournament at the provincial level to have such nicknames?” A man addicted to web novels rejected the suggestion.</p><p>“That’s true… ” The woman with semi-rimless glasses thought for a while before making her suggestion. “What about Four Big Dippers, Six Earth Fiends, Eight Little Immortals?”</p><p>“Four Stars and Six Comets don’t rhyme, but Eight Fairies is pretty good. We’ll use that. As for the other two nicknames, think about them in these few days and decide them the next meeting.” The leader then changed the topic. “We don’t have to discuss about the top 16, but who do you nominate for other two positions?”</p><p>“I nominate Xing Jingjing. Her control over her supernatural ability of illusion is great. If she hadn’t encountered Lou Cheng, she would’ve easily defeated the following several seeded fighters,” the woman with semi-rimless glasses answered without hesitation.</p><p>“I’m also for Xing Jingjing.”</p><p>“I agree.”</p><p>The others also agreed.</p><p>“Then Xing Jingjing will be among the Eight Fairies,” the leader said with interest. “Since she creates magic-like illusion and is ranked in the Eight Fairies, I have a nickname that suits her well.”</p><p>“Which is?” the messy-haired young man asked curiously.</p><p>“Little Devil Immortal! What do you think?” The leader smiled proudly.</p><p>The woman with semi-rimless glasses looked stunned and then replied with a blank face.</p><p>“If you think it’s nice, then it must really be nice.”</p><p>“That’s settled then! Let’s decide the next one.” The leader thumped on the table in the manner of a swordsman, pleased with his talent for coming up nicknames.</p><p>He will name Top 16 Athelets one by one!</p><p>…</p><p>In the afternoon, Lou Cheng went to the stadium as usual. He watched every match, feeling as if he had gone back to the days of Little Warrior Sage Challenge Tournament. Though he was almost a Dan stage warrior, he attached the same importance and showed the same respect to the competition as before.</p><p>Anyone below 26 in the top 32 of the provincial level must not be an ordinary person. Watching them fight up close would more or less benefit him. Besides, the winner could be his opponent tomorrow night.</p><p>Beginning from the top 16 competition, the matches were scheduled at the night prime time to attract the highest level of attention. This way, working adults could come to the stadium with their families or snuggle in their couches or beds to peacefully enjoy the tournament.</p><p>Lou Cheng felt more relaxed the next morning as he had no matches scheduled. Besides practicing his still stance, move stance, and his own fighting style, most of his time was spent on practicing the Danqi State.</p><p>When he was about to finish exercising, Lou Cheng dropped into a stance and closed his eyes. He recalled his body’s subtle changes during the Sextuple Explosion and what he had visualized after the outbreak of Dan stage. He once again tried to experiment with “withdraw”.</p><p>When his will sank and stirred the situation, his Qi, blood, and force fused together. It spun around and closed into each other with signs of integration.</p><p>It sharpened Lou Cheng’s perception of his surroundings. He can even sense the arrival of a mosquito with evil intentions.</p><p>That delicate perception lasted for only the briefest moment before the balance was broken. Lou Cheng felt his Qi, blood, and force began surging outwards, forcing him to open his eyes and ease the burden on his body.</p><p>The outbreak of Dan stage relied not only on one’s energy and stamina, but also on his ability to withstand pressure. That was not something Lou Cheng was worried about. On one hand, he was making rapid progress through ultimate practice. On the other, he could reduce the pressure and exhaustion with the help of Jindan.</p><p>After trying again and again, he gradually inched closer to the Dan stage.</p><p>“It’s pretty efficient to practice through actual combat. Maybe I’ll become a real Mighty One of the Dan stage by the end of the Youth Tournament… ” Withdrawing his stance, Lou Cheng’s thought was cheerful despite his exhaustion.</p><p>…</p><p>It was 7.30 at night. Gaofen Martial Arts Gymnasium was brilliantly illuminated, with the central arena laid out as a temporary stage for fighters to draw lots. In front of the stage, there were chairs with names written on their backs. The seats were for special guests and the top 16 fighters.</p><p>Other than the median dividers between zones, the stands around the arena were full under a blanket of shadow. People were eating popcorn, taking photos, and discussing the upcoming match. While some were real martial arts lovers, there were also those who came to enjoy the atmosphere with their families.</p><p>Lou Cheng sat in the second row of guest seats, third from the left. He live broadcasted the performance on stage to Yan Zheke, while patiently waiting for the lots-drawing ceremony.</p><p>Besides training and eating, he had been analyzing videos of other fighters with his girlfriend the whole day. That was just in case he was selected for the first match and had no time to study his opponent’s videos. There were only 15 fighters left besides him!</p><p>“Why are they still not drawing lots yet?” Lou Cheng complained.</p><p>Yan Zheke sent a snickering emoji. “Are you nervous?”</p><p>“Not exactly. I’m just concerned,” Lou Cheng replied with a smile.</p><p>He was indeed a little nervous. It would be embarrassing if he could not hold on until Ke returned or failed to rank in the top 4 as per his goal. But as an experienced fighter who has joined many tournaments, such thoughts were normal and he did not have to worry about them.</p><p>At the same time, Yan Zheke was sitting in the departure lounge, watching the match broadcast using her tablet and earphones.</p><p>Chatting with her boyfriend, she was filled with anticipation.</p><p>She kept two things secret from Lou Cheng. One was that she had crossed the threshold of the inner-refining method and was given permission to “graduate” from her grandparents’ lessons. The other one was that she had booked a 10.05 flight tonight and would be back after the top 16 competition. Gu Shuang would be picking her up from the airport.</p><p>Hehe, she can also give him a surprise!</p><p>…</p><p>Xiushan.</p><p>Lou Yuanwei was lying on the couch with sagging spirits, watching his mom switch between channels consistently and listening to his grandparents discussing about trivial household affairs with dad.</p><p>After making comprehensive a research, he found his initial plan to be unrealistic. So he had to give up creating unnecessary setbacks for himself temporarily and once again looked for a new way out.</p><p>He inadvertently caught sight of a familiar figure in TV and blurted out,</p><p>“Mum, which channel did you stop at just now?”</p><p>W-was there something wrong with his eyes? He seemed to see someone!</p><p>Wang Lili gave her son a reproachful look. “Which one do you mean?”</p><p>“Mom, switch the channel again.” Lou Yuanwei suddenly straightened himself, his eyebrows knitting.</p><p>Wang Lili returned to the channel in confusion, nagging, “If you want to watch something, just say it outright.”</p><p>“Stop, stop, stop!” shouted Lou Yuanwei, as his eyes lit up.</p><p>Wang Lili stopped at the Xin province satellite TV station and carefully looked at the screen. Then she said in surprise,</p><p>“Isn’t that Cheng?”</p><p>…</p><p>“First seed Zhang Zhutong will fight… ” One special guest drew a small ball. “… with fourth seed Zuo Zhen!”</p><p><em>“A battle of powerful warriors…”</em> Sighing, Lou Cheng suddenly heard his name. “No. 18 Lou Cheng… ”</p><p>When the screen began to show a clip of his previous match, the guest reached into the box.</p><p>“He’ll battle the fifth seed Qiu Lin!”</p><p>The fifth seed Qiu Lin? Lou Cheng narrowed his eyes, feeling a little disappointed. But he was not afraid of Qiu Lin. Instead, he gradually became interested in their match.</p><p>Qiu Lin was a genuine Mighty One of Eighth Pin who had once joined the Ranking Event of Seventh Pin. Though she ultimately failed to get the rank, it showed her great confidence in her abilities.</p><p>Besides, her ancestor was once a secular disciple of Daxing Temple and she herself have the supernatural ability of metalizing parts of her body!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
