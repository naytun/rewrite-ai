Besides being good at Buddha’s Warrior Attendant Fist and metalizing part of her body, Qiu Lin preferred fighting her opponents with brute strength after demotivating them. What was more, she did not know Lou Cheng had mastered simplified movements of physical invulnerability. Considering all of this, it was not difficult to see that Qiu Lin ought to handle with a variant of Severe Warning. He would not need to worry about her dodging his attacks.</p><p>Facing an opponent at this level, Lou Cheng had never thought about hiding his strength and unique skills or not giving his all!</p><p>However, Lou Cheng found things were not as simple as he had expected at the beginning of this match. Seeing Qiu Lin once again make a breakthrough in the realm of Lotus Step and Buddha Voice, Lou Cheng realized he would not have the time to prepare for the pre-conditions of Severe Warning!</p><p>Thanks to two months of intensive training and the improvement of his own realm, Lou Cheng could use Severe Warning at a faster speed. But it was, after all, a simplified movement of physical invulnerability. It required Lou Cheng to adjust his corresponding muscles, tendons, and organs as he did when using Frost Force. But Qiu Lin’s Thundercloud Movement would not even give him the chance to react.</p><p>Lou Cheng was therefore forced to gradually give Qiu Lin an impression of weakness and feed her arrogance. After directly blocking Qiu Lin’s Triple Blow, Lou Cheng accurately determined that she was going to use “Hum” sound to suppress her potentiality. He seized the opportunity to retreat and rapidly prepare for the next round of the face-to-face fight.</p><p>If Qiu Lin had accomplished four successive bursts by herself and spared no time on “Hum” sound, or if she had known Lou Cheng’s mastery of the simplified movement of physical invulnerability, and thus used Lotus Step and Buddha Voice to climb on Lou Cheng’s back before attacking to prevent a head-to-head collision, then it would have been anyone’s guess who would win.</p><p>In other words, his victory was largely due to Qiu Lin being unaware of his unique skill and taken off guard.</p><p>Now that he had used this advantage, it would no longer be as effective in the following matches.</p><p>Thoughts flashing through his mind, Lou Cheng looked at Qiu Lin, who had just turned around, and cupped his fist in greeting.</p><p>“Thank you for your mercy.”</p><p>Qiu Lin’s face was still pale as her lips quivered.</p><p>“What unique skill was that?”</p><p>Even now, Qiu Lin still could not quite believe she had lost, or the feeling of having her mind frozen.</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled and imitated her words.</p><p>“That’s a secret.”</p><p>He coolly turned and left the arena, persevering despite his exhaustion.</p><p>It was not that easy to bear the brunt of Triple Blow and Severe Warning!</p><p>…</p><p>In the waiting room, there was a moment that Zhang Zhutong almost felt like the match was unreal.</p><p>How could Lou Cheng turned the tide against Qiu Lin, who had the upper hand, in such a short time?</p><p>Qiu Lin’s face appeared on the screen with her lackluster eyes and seemingly frostbitten lips. This reminded Zhang Zhutong of Lou Cheng’s retreat and “weak” counterattack without Force Concentration.</p><p>It was not because Lou Cheng feared Qiu Lin and dared not to go head-on-head with her, or he forgot Force Concentration in his nervousness. He was actually deliberately setting a trap!</p><p>What a tricky move!</p><p>Considering Qiu Lin’s strength and physique, added with the fact that she had flourished her blood with the “Hum” sound, Lou Cheng could not have made her so visibly stiff purely with Ice Sect Force. A simple Force Concentration could help her seize a winning chance.</p><p>This movement was not simple… Zhang Zhutong’s pupils contracted pupils, some post-match fear rising in him.</p><p>If it was not Qiu Lin, but him who first encountered Lou Cheng in the top 16 competition, the result would still be not cheerful when met with that move!</p><p>Facing a fighter who could make in-time outbreak, cause great injury to his opponent, has firm control of himself, and make the most of his abnormal stamina, who could defeat him?</p><p>As a Dan stage warrior, Zhang Zhutong soon got rid of his fear with a clear heart and firm will. He began analyzing Lou Cheng’s performance.</p><p>Why did he take a few steps back before making his move instead of using it directly?</p><p>Did he need to prepare?</p><p>Thinking about it, Zhang Zhutong gradually confirmed his suspicion and found a way to counter Lou Cheng’s move.</p><p>The host in the studio appeared on the screen then, consulting the special guest with a questioning look. “Teacher Yu Hong, I still can’t understand the final collision. Lou Cheng was obviously the one who was blown away and lagging behind, but why was it Qiu Lin who was stunned into standing still?”</p><p>Thinking for a while, Yu Hong said, “If I didn’t see it wrongly, it should be a simplified physical invulnerability move related to Frost Force… ”</p><p>“A simplified physical invulnerable move?” The host gasped in shock.</p><p>“A simplified physical invulnerability move… ” Zhang Zhutong lifted his head in surprise.</p><p>…</p><p>“A simplified physical invulnerability move?”</p><p>In the waiting room beside Zhang Zhutong’s, Han Zhifei was quiet for a long time. Han Ying, who had benefited from association with her elder brother, turned to Xiong Yu blankly, only to find the boy as dazed as her.</p><p>Xiong Yu recalled his match with Lou Cheng. Back then, he still dreamed getting a winning chance if only he tried hard enough. With the benefit of hindsight, he felt a joke, like a frog in a well.</p><p>Lou Cheng was like an iceberg in the ocean. What he had shown above the water was just a small part of his strength. That was why he would give Xiong Yu a new impression after every match!</p><p>How fearsome was he?</p><p>What would happen if he utilized all his strength?</p><p>…</p><p>“Lou Cheng wins?” Qi Yunfei rubbed her eyes, unable to believe what she had seen.</p><p>No one answered her.</p><p>Just a dozen of seconds ago, Qiu Lin was still as arrogant as a Vajra Body, making most of the audience sure that she would soon win this round. However, she inexplicably failed without even able to resist any attacks after a brief encounter with Lou Cheng.</p><p>Qi Yunfei quickly snapped back into focus. Seeing Brother Lou Cheng coolly standing on the arena and recalling his curious attack that had turned the tide, Qi Yunfei immediately understood what enigmatic meant, as well as what it meant to handle complicated matters with ease. Her adoration for Lou Cheng turned into sprouting little stars.</p><p>She was this close to being an actual brother-obsessed girl! Looking excitedly around her, she found Chen Xiaoxiao and the others had similar reactions.</p><p>“Brother Lou Cheng is so great!”</p><p>In the quiet stadium, she shouted in excitement with her sharp voice.</p><p>Hearing Qi Yunfei congratulating Lou Cheng, Ma Xi fell into an inexplicable silence.</p><p>She recalled what her second elder brother had told her during Lunar New Year. He said once he had gained more confidence, broadened his horizon, and enriched his mind, he would regard all the monetary disputes in their family as trifles that he need not care about or fight for.</p><p>She had been doubting him until she saw his performance today. Looking at her second elder brother, who had stunned the whole stadium, acting in an elegant and confident manner, she began to believe in what he had said for the first time…</p><p>…</p><p>There was the same silence in the living room of Lou family.</p><p>When Lou Cheng turned around to leave the arena, Lou Yuanwei blurted out something. It was more like he was speaking to himself.</p><p>“Is it really Cheng?”</p><p>When did he become Superman?</p><p>If he had not heard wrongly earlier, it was the top 16 competition of the provincial Youth Tournament. That was to say, Cheng was among the top 16 young warriors in this province. No, he had just made the top 8!</p><p>With such strength, if Lou Cheng wanted a career in politics after graduation, he will be at the same level as a deputy director or even director of a police department. If he wanted to go into business, he could easily make a fortune by running a martial arts club. He would doubtlessly be either wealthy or respectable!</p><p>Wang Lili and Lou Zhiqiang subconsciously turned to look at their father. They saw his stunned expression, before he took off his glasses to rub his eyes as he whispered to himself.</p><p>“Our ancestors has blessed us, our ancestors has blessed us… ”</p><p>Cheng had brought honor to the family name!</p><p>…</p><p>“Haha, my idol is such a miracle man. He can even master a simplified physical invulnerability move! Sure enough he had the mysterious air of a secret master!” Brahman sent a string of red hearts.</p><p>Eternal Nightfall, or Yan Xiaoling, commented with an emoji circling on the ground.</p><p>“I can’t take it anymore! A maiden heart is thumping in me. Get out of the way, I’m going to show off!”</p><p>She posted her acceptance letter from Songcheng University, but forgot to mosaic her name on it in excitement.</p><p>“Oh, so your real name is Yan Xiaoling. What an honest, dependable and simple name,” said Unparalleled Dragon King. No one knew whether she was praising or making fun of her.</p><p>“Of course, I’m different from those pretty and coquettish girls outside!” Now that her real name was exposed, she no longer bothered about being shameless. Yan Xiaoling showed her true self thoroughly. After all, it was not the first time she was this careless. “The key point! Look at the key point!”</p><p>“Wow, girl. You’re really accepted into Songcheng University!” Brahman replied, changing his tone.</p><p>“Well, I’ll be Lou Cheng’s junior in the new semester! I’ll join the Martial Arts Club!” Yan Xiaoling said excitedly.</p><p>Brahman sent an emoji biting its handkerchief with envy. “Could you get an autographed photo for me?”</p><p>“Brahman, what is our relationship? I’ll definitely bring you a pile of photos!” Yan Xiaoling laughed in smug satisfaction.</p><p>“What relationship? Father-daughter relationship!” Brahman emphasized.</p><p>Okamoto’s Fan cut in with a grinning emoji. “Lingling, don’t indulge in tall talk. I bet you’ll be as shy as a quail the moment you see Lou Cheng. Never mind asking for his autographs, you might not even dare to speak a single word to him!”</p><p>“Nonsense!” Yan Xiaoling replied fiercely. “I-I-I-I don’t even dare to approach him!”</p><p>In real life, she was that weak and coward…</p><p>Leaving no chance for the others to reply, she sent an angry emoji and continued, “Don’t escape, you cheater! I’ll beat you up! The pronunciation of ‘Hum’ you told me is wrong!”</p><p>“Eh, how did you out?” Okamoto’s Fan sent a surprised emoji.</p><p>Yan Xiaoling replied with an emoji with an expression of ‘see this bunch of flowers? I rather throw it away than give it to you’.</p><p>“I’m not deaf! That old commentator has repeated it several times as ‘Hum’ sound!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Ke’s boyfriend is so strong… ” Gu Shuang praised, stunned by Lou Cheng’s performance.</p><p>Though she knew little about martial arts and could hardly understand the matches earlier, Gu Shuang learned about Qiu Lin and her strength as a famous young fighter in the Gao Fen martial arts circle from various people.</p><p>However tough Qiu Lin was, she lost to Lou Cheng within several moves.</p><p>Such a comparison gave her a clear understanding of who Ke called Silly Cheng and his strength for the first time.</p><p>Xing Jingjing, who was sitting beside her, took a breath. Her expression shifted slightly.</p><p>“Sister Jingjing, what do you think Lou Cheng’s nickname will be?” Gu Shuang’s thoughts soon jumped to another topic.</p><p>Though Xing Jingjing was always calm and cold, she could not help gnashing her teeth when it came to nickname. She replied plainly,</p><p>“I don’t know… ”</p><p>“He ended all his matches within several moves… Haha, will he get a nickname as Fast Shooter?” Gu Shuang burst into laughter.</p><p>…</p><p>In the departure lounge, Yan Zheke sighed with relief. She could still feel the wild thumping of her heart.</p><p>Before the match, she had discussed with Lou Cheng about the proper fighting style to defeat Qiu Lin. She also knew her boyfriend would seize the opportunity to handle his opponent with simplified physical invulnerability moves. But there were still a lot of differences between rehearsal and actual combat. What was worse, they had never expected that Qiu Lin had improved her body movement to the realm of Lotus Step and Thundercloud Movement.</p><p>Yan Zheke had been worrying about Lou Cheng the whole match.</p><p>Knowing her boyfriend was the winner, the girl put on a smile and seated herself properly, waiting for Lou Cheng’s call.</p><p>He would definitely call her at once!</p><p>…</p><p>As soon as Lou Cheng left the arena, he was blocked by the reporter Wu Wei.</p><p>“You seemed to be in a hurry?” Wu Wei passed him the microphone and smiled. “You don’t want to be interviewed?”</p><p>“No. I’ve just defeated such a tough opponent and won an important match. I want to share my joy with someone most important to me, er, with my families and friends,” Lou Cheng replied cheerfully, the corner of his lips curled and his eyes soft.</p><p>Lou Zhisheng, Qi Fang, and the others were watching the broadcast on the screen. Just as they were about to talk, they heard a girl sitting nearby saying, “Ah, he’s so cute like that! I’m dragged into his fan club!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
