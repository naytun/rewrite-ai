The afternoon sunlight was hot and piercing. The people of Gushan Martial Arts School astutely let down the curtains so the interior of the bus turned comfortably dark.</p><p>Lou Cheng was basking in the warmth reaching through the curtain and the cool air-conditioning above his head. He closed his eyes and recalled the events and emotions he experienced since beginning to learn martial arts.</p><p>It was only until recently that he understood the true meaning behind his master’s ten words.</p><p>‘Human body big Dan’ referred to the state when all the force in his body became unified as a whole. ‘Round lump’ meant that all the force, Qi, blood, and spirit becoming mellow and transparent. ‘Shining brightness’ was understanding what one was fighting for and putting it into practice. And then one should ensure the will was firm and the spirit clear step by step, so he can shine.</p><p>Body refining was a certain extreme level of physical tempering. Dan Stage, on the other hand, would involve the spirit and will to break one’s threshold!</p><p>In the middle of his reminiscence, he overheard many disciples excitedly talking to each other.</p><p>“I hope that I won’t meet too powerful fighters early in the tournament so I can break into the third round!” Xu Rongfei said, turning to Qin Rui.</p><p>Qin Rui answered with both anticipation and nervousness, “Among the fighters in the bus, I’m afraid only Senior Dai can advance into the third round with any certainty… ”</p><p>“You don’t want to advance?” Xu Rongfei snickered.</p><p>Qin Rui blurted, “Of course I want to! What an honor it would be! I also want to advance to the fourth round to get more attention!”</p><p>Youth Tournament was established to encourage the teenagers in this province to work hard and move forward. It was a little different from the smaller Warrior Sage Challenge Tournament. In the first three rounds of the tournament, the professional-level fighters would not participate. This was so that amateur-level fighters can use their skills and learn from one another.</p><p>For amateur fighters, the result of this tournament was also a point of pride. One may say, for example, “What? You lost in the second round of the Youth Tournament? Oh, my luck is much better. I advanced to the fourth round and confronted a Professional Ninth Pin!”</p><p>When everyone shared the same rank, this was one of the few ways for them to differentiate their actual power and abilities!</p><p>Listening to these words and feeling that kind of desire, Lou Cheng smiled with his eyes closed.</p><p>Initially, his only purpose was the reward money. He did not have any other ideas. But now, as a fighter who has opened the door to Dan stage, he can start thinking about some other goals.</p><p>In that instant, he also felt a little smug.</p><p>Chu Weicai also had his eyes closed, taking in the excitement and happiness of the disciples around him. A thought came to him.</p><p>“It’s so nice to be young, one can be hopeful and lively… ”</p><p>Lively… When he thought over this one word, he realized that he seemed to have neglected something important.</p><p>Ideas flashing in his mind, Chu Weicai suddenly clenched his hands and opened his eyes to stare at Lou Cheng in front of him.</p><p>Perhaps because they were often in close contact, he did not even notice the changes in Lou Cheng’s body.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s Qi and blood were originally vivacious to a boiling point. He gave off a sharp and strong aura that made him look like a powerful fighter. But he now appeared calm and serene. All his Qi and blood had become incredibly ordinary!</p><p>Perhaps he… Chu Weicai’s pupils shrank. He did not dare to believe his own suspicion.</p><p>But the changes in front of him were an obvious answer!</p><p>This was too unbelievable! He was both shocked and glad.</p><p>…</p><p>Tianshui Hotel, the hotel Gushan Martial Arts School booked, was not far from martial arts arena in Gao Fen. The environment was also quiet and cool. The price was not high either; it was about 400 yuan per night.</p><p>Lou Cheng also chose this hotel. He booked a king-size room on the 12th floor.</p><p>He put down his luggage and stood beside the French window. Drawing the curtains, he overlooked the beetle-shaped arena. He felt inexplicable happiness at overlooking something from a high place.</p><p>Just after he took a photo and sent it to Yan Zheke, he received a call from Qin Rui.</p><p>“Hey, Cheng! Do you want to eat with us? My master wants to treat us to a feast today to give us a good start!” Qin Rui laughed.</p><p>Lou Cheng was still by the window, one hand in his pocket. He gave a small smile. “No thanks. My parents, Jiang Fei, and the rest are here. I have to eat with them.”</p><p>“Look at my weak memory!” Qin Rui patted his forehead. “Then you all have a good time!”</p><p>After ending the call, Lou Cheng immediately called Jiang Fei.</p><p>“Hey, Fatty Jiang! I’ll treat you all to dinner later. Don’t wander around!”</p><p>Fatty Jiang was also staying in a nice hotel because Tao Xiaofei, the rich kid, volunteered to pay for their accommodation. But they were not staying in the same hotel as his parents were.</p><p>Jiang Fei was somewhat surprised. “Cheng, since when have you become so polite and good at taking initiative? I thought you’ll only agree to treat us after some begging!”</p><p>“Are you eating or not? If you don’t want to eat, then the deal’s off! Why do you speak so much nonsense!” Lou Cheng laughed gruffly.</p><p>Tao Xiaofei and Fatty Jiang drove his parents and cousins all the way to Gao Fen and also came to cheer him on. If he did not even treat them to a meal, he would feel very guilty about it.</p><p>Of course, such acute social awareness was all thanks to the influence of Coach Yan!</p><p>Jiang Fei laughed heartily. “Of course we have to eat! We’re still waiting for the meal you promised when we found out about your relationship with Yan Zheke!”</p><p>He was forgetful and had already forgotten the sour feelings and the sense of loss at that time.</p><p>“Fine. Ke and I will treat you later.” Thinking that his girlfriend will be coming to Gao Fen, Lou Cheng agreed without hesitation.</p><p>Empress Dowager was so far from this city anyway!</p><p>Jiang Fei nodded with satisfaction. “Then we’ll pick you up and go to the hotel your parents are staying in.”</p><p>“It’s fine. I’ll go there myself. You guys adjust your timing and meet me there.” Lou Cheng walked out of the door while he was still on the phone. He wore a white short-sleeved T-shirt, beige trousers, and a pair of brown vintage leather shoes. His style gave him a leisurely feeling.</p><p>On his way to Ming Qi International Hotel, he easily picked out a restaurant for dinner later: a Yunnan restaurant nearby the hotel. This was all thanks to Coach Yan’s recommendations as she was a frequent visitor of Gao Fen.</p><p>He arrived at the five-star hotel quickly because there was no traffic jam. He had to wait for a while because the hotel elevator required access cards. He then caught a ride with other hotel patrons before finally making it to the 17th floor. He knocked on his parents’ door.</p><p>“What five-star hotel? Doesn’t it feel the same as other hotels? The room’s only a little bigger and newer… ” Qi Fang was still upset over the use of the bonus as she complained to her son.</p><p>Lou Cheng stepped on the soft carpet and went along with his mom’s complaints. “That’s right. Which hotel can’t we stay in as long as it’s clean? Dad, mom, prepare to leave. Fatty Jiang and Tao Xiaofei will come soon. I’m planning to buy them a meal.”</p><p>Lou Zhisheng pushed his glasses and happily said, “You should treat them indeed. Cheng, you’re really mature now.”</p><p>After waiting for his three cousins to get ready, the six of them walked into the elevator to get to the ground floor.</p><p>Ding!</p><p>When the elevator door opened on the ground floor, a few familiar faces appeared in front of them.</p><p>Guo Min was waiting for the elevator with his wife Wan Rongli, children Guo Huairou and Guo Huaien, as well as bodyguard Xie Tong.</p><p>“Old Lou, all of your family are here today?” When Guo Min recognized Lou Zhisheng and Qi Fang, his eyes lightened up and he greeted them with a smile. Wan Rongli and Guo Huairou raised their chins in arrogance.</p><p>Just then, the gazes of their families froze when they saw a gently smiling Lou Cheng beside Lou Zhisheng.</p><p>Guo Huairou and others recalled the words: “He came”, “He left”, as well as the figure of this young man floating away.</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled and nodded as a way of greeting.</p><p>Guo Min and the others were surprised and apprehensive. They subconsciously began to smile and also nodded.</p><p>It really was him!</p><p>Why was he here?</p><p>Lou Zhisheng modestly laughed. “Manager Guo, I thought you’ll arrive here tomorrow. This is my son, Lou Cheng. These are my nieces. All of you can call him Uncle Gou.”</p><p>Lou Cheng stepped forward and smiled.</p><p>“Hello, Uncle Gou.”</p><p>“Yes, yes… ” Guo Min stared at a casually-dressed Lou Cheng with his gentle smile in bewilderment, finding it difficult to answer.</p><p>Uncle Gou…</p><p>Guo Huairou and the rest turned into clay figurines as they blankly responded to Lou Cheng’s greeting.</p><p>“Manager Guo, we still have something to do. We’ll go now.” Lou Zhisheng was holding the elevator door for them.</p><p>“Yes, yes… ” Guo Min’s reply was the same as before.</p><p>Lou Cheng said nothing. With two hands in the pocket, he walked behind his dad. He then leisurely strode to the side door as it was closest route to the Yunnan restaurant.</p><p>Guo Min inhaled sharply as he watched that family leave, feeling like he had just survived a bad incident.</p><p>…</p><p>When they arrived at the side door, Qi Yunfei, Chen Xiao Xiao and Ma Xi was shocked by the noisy and lively scene there.</p><p>Before the door, the floor was laid with red carpet extending all the way to the stairs. There were set spears and short cannon on both sides, as well as boys and girls carrying banners and slogans.</p><p>“W-What are they doing?” Qi Yunfei whispered to herself in bewilderment.</p><p>Lou Cheng glanced at the scene, also perplexed. He then noticed a familiar figure coming in from the door. To be precise, Lou Cheng was familiar with that person, but that person did not know him.</p><p>That person was the first seed of the Youth Tournament, the 27-year-old Dan stage Seventh Pin, Zhang Zhutong.</p><p>Genius fighters like Peng Yueyun and Ren Li had yet to appear in this generation in Xing province, not even fighters in the level below. Zhang Zhutong, as a fighter who could reach the Dan stage Seventh Pin when he was 23, was close to master the Inhuman level. It was not completely hopeless for him to try and achieve physical invulnerability. He can be considered a key fighter who had attracted the expectations and attention of the whole province.</p><p>Zhang Zhutong was as tall as Lou Cheng. When he wore the white martial arts suit, it made him look very handsome. His eyes were sharp and deep. He wore a smile and seemed pretty proud of himself.</p><p>With a beautiful lady as his companion, he walked on the red carpet and wore a casual expression when facing the flash of the cameras.</p><p>A girl next to Qi Yunfei answered her questions excitedly.</p><p>“Dinner party! It’s the dinner party for this Youth Tournament! Don’t you guys know?”</p><p>“I don’t know… ” Qi Yunfei shook her head innocently.</p><p>The girl gave her a simple explanation. “The Youth Tournament is the day after tomorrow, isn’t it? So the committee specifically organized a dinner party for the seed players. Many powerful fighters and celebrities are coming!”</p><p>As she was talking, she raised the banner and screamed.</p><p>“Zhang Zhutong!”</p><p>Qi Yunfei suddenly understood, then she turned to look at her cousin. She wanted to say something, but she felt embarrassed to say. However, Chen Xiaoxiao asked innocently.</p><p>“Brother Lou Cheng, why aren’t you invited?”</p><p>Lou Cheng was watching Zhang Zhu Tong turn towards the stairs. He shook his head with a smile.</p><p>“Maybe I’m not qualified yet.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
