Mr. Gan, I see Lou Cheng is very painful and he’s been retching. In your eyes, how much impact of the concussion he was affected?”</p><p>Gan Le sighed. “His body refining is close to the peak. He won’t show any retching if he is feeling well and could control his body. Well, I had confidence in him earlier and thought he would have a great opportunity to win Hou Yue in the later match with his great physical strength so long as he could defeat Zhou Zhengquan. Now, well, the outcome of the victory will be reversed.”</p><p>“So serious?” Fang Juexiao asked while knowing the answer. He knew that the audience watching the broadcasting was certainly very concerned about this point, even the students present would read the forums and look the broadcasting in the interim, to find out Lou Cheng’s current state from both of their explanations.</p><p>Gan Le nodded as a mighty one in Dan stage, smashing a lot of people’s expectations. “Yes, quite seriously.”</p><p>Fang Juexiao made a pity look. “Unfortunately, this is no dialogue time to let him recover. Well, Hou Yue is about to board the arena, let’s switch the picture back to the scene.”</p><p>…</p><p>Yan Xiaoling felt her heart tightened after listening to the analysis of the two explanations, she posted in forum eagerly, tagged Unparalleled Dragon King, Road to the Arena and so on: “Come out come out, is our Lou Cheng’s injury serious?”</p><p>Unparalleled Dragon King replied with a sigh emoji, “My vision and judgment can be better than a mighty one in Dan stage?”</p><p>“I agree with the explanations, Lou Cheng is deeply affected and his status is terrible.” Road to the Arena replied seriously.</p><p>Brahman post an expression of holding back the tears. “What should I do? I want to cry… ”</p><p>“Don’t cry, let’s cheer Lou Cheng on!” Yan Xiaoling patted herself quickly, she bit her lips while clenched the fists, perturbed but expected to look at the live scene as tears still welled up in her eyes.</p><p>…</p><p>In Songcheng University martial arts’ arena, Li Liantong and other people got nervous and flushed with an inexplicable care and bad feeling when they saw Lou Cheng’s painful expression on the big screen even though they hadn’t read the forum and listened to the explanations.</p><p>“How was he?”</p><p>“Did he get hurt?”</p><p>“Would he lose the next competition?”</p><p>The outburst of excited shouting because Zhou Zhengquan fell to the ground a moment ago had come into silence. Including Fan Yanxi, many female students who are in prayer put their hands on the lips.</p><p>“Go, Lou Cheng!”</p><p>At the host team seats, Yan Zheke walked toward the stone steps without noticing other people’s gaze. She looked distressed and worried as her teeth bit lightly on her lip and her fists somehow clenched.</p><p>On the arena, Lou Cheng came to a little, he held his emotions without reviewing, rethinking and upsetting. He concealed his spirit and qi, visualized thundercloud and moved his belly little by little at once. He shocked every corner of his body in a moment through internal training methods to adjust the state of the body.</p><p>He tried to recover as much as possible.</p><p>The energy wasn’t completely independent of the body, it also relied on the state of body. Just like the people who caught cold, they were not only tired and weak, but also thinking slowly. When Lou Cheng suffered a tremendous impact, his spirit automatically had a small decay. He could not play “Severe Warning”.</p><p>“Later I should defend first, then using the supernatural ability with the help of Frost Force or simply hiding in the normal moves, consuming the limit as soon as possible to squeeze Jindan, this is a non-solution if I fell into a dangerous situation!” Lou Cheng quickly made the decision. “Don’t give up easily!”</p><p>This was not just because in Donglin he showed confidence and rhetoric to Ke, not only due to self-satisfaction, he failed to live up to Brother-in-law’s effort and pain. There was one more important factor:</p><p>“I want victory!”</p><p>“I just want to win but nothing else!”</p><p>He took a breath and thunder growled from his belly.</p><p>…</p><p>When the referee announced the result of the third game, Hou Yue jumped up from his seat and ran to the arena without thinking anything.</p><p>He always remembered that before he walked out of the locker room, senior brother Zhou told him: once he heard the announcement of the last game, he should run to the arena immediately without any delay.</p><p>When he came close, he suddenly shocked because he saw his senior brother was lying on the ground with messy hair and curled like a shrimp as he looked painful and even vomit a little yellow bile.</p><p>“Is this senior brother Zhou?”</p><p>In Hou Yue’s memory, senior brother Zhou Zhengquan was very focused on his appearance and style as his hair and clothes had always been arranged meticulous, and also tried his best to be gentle and calm every word and deed. His most worship idol was Xie An who was playing the chess-like nothing happened after he heard the news of Fei River’s success.</p><p>He had lost before, but he always left gracefully in these rare failures. Senior Sister Zhuo and Li ridicule him for being a gentle rather than getting any merits.</p><p>But now, senior brother Zhou was so miserable and lost his manner. To create the chance for him to win Lou Chen, senior brother Zhou even throw his most valued image away.</p><p>Hou Yue who would be 18 in a few days was at the age that could be easily moved and excited. When he thought about this, His eyes immediately turned red and he burst out the rage of battle as well.</p><p>“Whatever the cost may be and whatever the level may fight for, I can’t fail senior brother Zhou’s expectations!”</p><p>Hou Yue just went to the stone steps as Zhou Zhengquan had been helped by the staff down. When they passed by each other, Zhou Zhengquan who with pale face and messy hair whispered softly.</p><p>“Try hard… ”</p><p>Hou Yue nodded his head vigorously and clenched his fists, said,</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>When faced with a strong enemy like Lou Cheng, even if he was weak and pain, Hou Yue couldn’t win without trying hard to take the chances when his body was still affected by the shock.</p><p>Hou Yue boarded the arena, stood in the previous position where Zhou Zhengquan stood before. He heard the sounds of buzzing from Lou Cheng’s body.</p><p>Lou Cheng opened his eyes and let out a turbid breath, he switched instantly from internal training to combat situation.</p><p>The referee raised his right hand, waving steadily:</p><p>“Begin!”</p><p>Lou Cheng whose calves were still shaking didn’t move, even if he could, he wouldn’t move. Because of this state, Chasing a monkey who ran all over the arena wasn’t a wise decision. A little inattention might affect his mood, he thereby hit more and more urgent and compounded the problem.</p><p>Thereupon, he took a breath and froze heart lake to ice. He calmly observed Hou Yue’s every move, not just only waiting for his attack, but also seizing the time to recover.</p><p>The longer the battle is, the better for himself!</p><p>Hou Yue bounced around Lou Cheng with his flexible footwork. He suddenly strode to his opponent’s side as he saw an opportunity, he twisted his waist and wrung all the strength into a strand, then threw a punch towards the center of Lou Cheng’s waist.</p><p>Lou Cheng lowered himself into a half-sitting position and moved his spine. With the explosive force of shoulder, he clenched his fists and threw a downward punch.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Both of them wobbled a little in the muffled sound. When Lou Cheng thought Hou Yue would keep moving and dodging around but saw Hou Yue clenched his teeth and opened his eyes wide while he exerted the force from foot and crushed the ground.</p><p>“Would he like to use the Fly Fall Punch-Waterfall to trigger the residual effect of my body?” Lou Cheng instantly understood the intention of Hou Yue, but he knew that his status wasn’t enough to support him to dodge at this time, so he clenched the teeth either, then adjusting the corresponding muscle fascia and moving the related five viscera and six bowels to visualize a roaring river.</p><p>No one was a coward here!</p><p>With the courage of death, Lou Cheng Ice-bounded the silty water so that the spray became crystal and the whole world instantly stilled. He swelled his arm muscle and threw an upward punch like bore the weight.</p><p>This was the flood of cold current and the power of frost!</p><p>At this moment, Hou Yue suddenly clenched his fists with a downward cut in a great momentum like “Down it cascades a sheer three thousand feet”.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>When the two fists met, a brief hazy appeared just like the hoarfrost turned into mist. Lou Cheng’s body trembled visibly once again, his facial muscle was hard to convulse.</p><p>The residual effect of his body was influenced a lot so that his previous attempt to recover was wasted.</p><p>Hou Yue shivered constantly and his lips turned purple, his hands and feet were frozen stiff.</p><p>Dong dong dong! His heart jumped, expanded and contracted rapidly to spurt the hot blood to dispel the chilliness in his body.</p><p>Then he made a choice which was contrary to his style and disposition that he visualized the water uprose and accumulated once again, then he twisted his waist and sprang the arm out.</p><p>“I will not back down even a half step!”</p><p>In the meantime, Lou Cheng also moved his belly and visualized Thunder Cloud to reverse offset. He relieved preliminarily while he saw Hou Yue’s sinister face and the attack he maintained. Lou Cheng didn’t have time to change visualization, he could only turn internal training to external fight: He tightened his arm and thrust the fist upward.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>There seemed to be an explosive sound on the arena, both of them backed up a step as the rebounded power.</p><p>Hem! Hou Yue exerted internal training method, with his red eyes and uncleared shockwaves, he rushed forward while he broke the black bricks. He fought so crazy and concentrated so that he wasn’t like the one he used to be.</p><p>At this time, Lou Cheng was so uncomfortable that he wanted to lie down directly. Therefore he had no time to squeeze Jindan but only managed to take a breath and with the force of venture and bet in the roaring of thunder, waved his arm to use Seabed Tremor!</p><p>The fall flew down and hit the ground. Hou Yue didn’t use downward cut with fist, just fisted on the side to block Lou Cheng’s Thunder Roar Zen.</p><p>Bang!A sound of thunder came out of nowhere, the audience went quiet because of the shock. The residual effect of Lou Cheng’s body was completely detonated that he lost all the energy and his qi and blood surged out of his throat, he felt so dizzy and tingling that he collapsed to the ground.</p><p>And Hou Yue who stood opposite to him that had gotten him one Frost Force and twice Tremor Punches, he couldn’t stand anymore as his muscles sniffing, the joints trembling and his qi and blood boiling, so he fell on the ground with a loud crash.</p><p>After fighting with three moves continuously, Hou Yue who didn’t well at this way and Lou Cheng who was in the poor state were both collapsed on the ground at the same time.</p><p>The referee stood by them and was counting down silently.</p><p>Li Liantong, Fan Yanxi and other audience felt their angsty hearts were going to spit at first, then came to shout one name in chorus with tears:</p><p>“Lou Cheng! Lou Cheng!”</p><p>“Lou Cheng! Lou Cheng! Lou Cheng!” Yan Xiaoling, Brahman and others who were now sitting in front of the computer screens also whispered the name and wanted to give him the courage and power through the screen to help him up again.</p><p>“Lou Cheng! Lou Cheng!” Yan Zheke, Sun Jian and others were also shouting with the audience, but they stood at the side of the arena and the audience sat in the auditorium.</p><p>Lin Que subconsciously clenched his fists with his eyes staring at the arena fixedly.</p><p>Lou Cheng saw Hou Yue fell on the ground from the corner of his eye, he tried to stand up first by adjusting his body’s situation while he was still retching and finishing one internal training with visualizing thundercloud.</p><p>However, even his mind and thoughts were still in shock, he was unable to visualize.</p><p>“Lou Cheng!” “Lou Cheng!” in the measured shouting, one figure struggling to get back up, he stood steadily while his legs were still trembling.</p><p>An indescribable silence had replaced the shouting at once because the person who stood up was Hou Yue.</p><p>Hou Yue took a deep breath and stepped toward to Lou Cheng’s side when he still looked pale.</p><p>He didn’t need to do anything else. The referee raised his right hand and announced the result:</p><p>“Round Four, Hou Yue wins!”</p><p>When Hou Yue heard the result, he looked back at his team seats immediately with his face already covered with tears and snot.</p><p>“Senior brother Zhou, I win!”</p><p>“I live up to your expectations!”</p><p>Lin Que unclenched his hand and buried his face in the hands. Li Liantong, Wu Qian, Fan Yanxi and other students couldn’t help crying.</p><p>“We have experienced all kinds of hardship, how can we stop here? We are only one step away from the success.”</p><p>When Lou Cheng heard the announcement hazily, he was filled with pain and chagrin at once.</p><p>“It’s all my fault!”</p><p>“I get dizzy in success!”</p><p>“I have failed to live up to my responsibility to act!”</p><p>At this time, someone with the familiar scents helped him up.</p><p>As he turned half round, he saw Yan Zheke’s beautiful face.</p><p>As long as he thought the promise that he didn’t keep and her expectation that he broke eventually, all the swagger and confidence had vanished like soap bubbles. He was too guilty and shame to face Yan Zheke.</p><p>He whispered in pain,</p><p>“Sorry… ”</p><p>Yan Zheke felt pity for the boy in front of her who was at a point of extreme anguish, she spoke softly with red eyes, “You played very well and you’re very close to winning.”</p><p>“I should play better… ” Lou Cheng clenched his fists, he wanted to punch himself to resolve the shame and self-accusation inward.</p><p>“I could surmount every difficulty to win the victory!”</p><p>Yan Zheke knew that the more they said, the more they grieved. She dropped this conversation and said firmly,</p><p>“Next time we win it back!”</p><p>Winning the prize back in next time? Lou Cheng was stunned, he made the commitment to her,</p><p>“Right!”</p><p>He calmed to down a little and went back to the seats. When he saw Lin Que who was miserable and the other people like Sun Jian who staring blankly, he couldn’t help blaming himself. He took a breath and said solemnly,</p><p>“Sorry, I didn’t play well this time!”</p><p>Li Mao answered right away, “No, you’re good enough! The rest of us are too weak!”</p><p>Because of that, now everything means nothing when they lost this competition, they couldn’t expect to play the substitute competition.</p><p>“Right, we are so weak that we could only count on the two of you!” Lin Hua said with tears in his eyes.</p><p>Lin Que also put down his hands, with his sad eyes, he said firmly,</p><p>“It is also my fault, I’m not good enough… ”</p><p>When Lou Cheng heard his teammates were rushing to take responsibility, tears blurred his eyes.</p><p>At this moment, Geezer Shi remained silence for a while, then said,</p><p>“Do you understand?”</p><p>Lou Cheng hung the head down and nodded slightly. “Yes!”</p><p>“Never get dizzy with success!”</p><p>Geezer Shi sighed. “Then I teach you another word. You could neither get dizzy with success nor lose vigor in depression.”</p><p>“Lost the vigor?” Lou Cheng looked up in bewilderment.</p><p>Geezer Shi nodded his head.</p><p>“Yes, the courage to pursue, the courage to exert, the courage to struggle!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
