It was not until he went to Yanling for the Little Warrior Sage Challenge Tournament that he saw a world of ice and snow while touching large snowflakes for the first time.</p><p>However, the scenery in front of him greatly surpassed his prior memories of snow, for at least 5cm of snow had piled up under his feet in less than a minute, which was now creaking and showing footprints under each of his steps. In the vast expanse of whiteness, he could see nothing several meters in front of him except for the wind and snow.</p><p>Lou Cheng was subconsciously about to say something, but all of his words were blocked from his mouth by the wind and snow.</p><p>A man with this level of Kung Fu could definitely be called a living immortal!</p><p><em>No wonder my master said that there were lots of myths and legends based on the deeds of mighty warriors!</em></p><p><em>When can I develop such a strength?</em></p><p>While all of these ideas flashed across his mind, Lou Cheng followed his master and older sister to leave the school. In the clean white world, he looked to a nearby parking lot, where he saw all the cars were covered with a thick frost.</p><p>As Shi Yuejian waved her right hand, the wind immediately grew stronger; enough to blow away all the frost that was on her car. Until this time, Lou Cheng did not get a clear view of this stylish sports car that bore an unfamiliar brand name.</p><p>After opening the door and seeing her dad get in, Shi Yuejian spoke gruffly,</p><p>“Cough if you want…”</p><p>A fit of violent coughing burst from Geezer Shi’s smiling mouth before he could say something in response, making Lou Cheng scared and worry greatly.</p><p>At the same time, Lou Cheng’s feeling of being at the mercy of a never-ending Brutal Blizzard abruptly stopped, and big snowflakes pouring down from the sky also began to slow down and tail off.</p><p>“Senior, senior sister, is my master OK?” he blurted out.</p><p>Shi Yuejian took a deep breath and sighed. “Not severe enough to kill him…”</p><p>Saying this, she put on a soft smile for she could do nothing for her dad. “Your master’s too proud to accept his old age and declining health. He could’ve taken other precautions to protect you instead of making such a special effect…”</p><p>” <em>Cough</em> , I’m fine! <em>cough</em> , I, <em>cough</em> , I’m not like your junior brother, <em>cough</em> , not as stupid as him, <em>cough</em> , I secretly, <em>cough</em> , borrowed, borrowed some strength, <em>cough</em> , from the Ice-core Bead,” Geezer Shi explained stubbornly.</p><p>Seeing him appear to come around, Lou Cheng breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p>“Master, it’ll be fine as long as you come around. Rest up and I’ll be back soon!” Stepping to the other side of the car, Lou Cheng took out his cellphone to record the snow-covered landscape and blizzard, then sent it to Yan Zheke.</p><p>Shi Yuejian whispered with a strange facial expression,</p><p>“I can’t understand the youth nowadays, either… ”</p><p><em>If I had suffered such a shock at his age, I wouldn’t have the mindset to take photos!</em></p><p>” <em>Cough</em> , I don’t know, either…” Geezer Shi turned to look at his stupid disciple through the window, who was intently recording the amazing scenery regardless of the snow covering him, which stunned his master.</p><p>Without Geezer Shi’s support, the snowflakes turned smaller and sparser, gradually stopping along with the blizzard weakening, in dozens of seconds. The dark cloud vanished and then the sun came out to shine on the snow-covered Binshen Sect in silence.</p><p>Lou Cheng stopped taking photos, and patted his head and clothes to brush off the snow. He then came back to Shi Yuejian’s car with an embarrassed smile. “Senior sister, sorry to keep you waiting because of me being impulsive.”</p><p>“Don’t be so polite. You are my dad’s first disciple and my first junior brother, I’ll protect you for any reason. So just withdraw your honorifics and regard me as your sister.” Shi Yuejian smiled softly and pointed at the car. “Get in and let’s discuss it on the way.”</p><p>“Okay.” Lou Cheng replied briskly, being affected by her attitude.</p><p>He sat by his master’s side and closed the door.</p><p>Shi Yuejian started the car and drove up the mountain highway.</p><p>It took no more than four minutes for the cloud to thin out and the snow to stop. In another black car, a man who was focused on his cellphone tilted and raised his head to relax his neck.</p><p>Then all of a sudden, his gaze froze on the white trees and field outside.</p><p>“This is…” Unfastening his seat belt unconsciously to get out, he saw that the car was also covered with a layer of snow. There were some kids making a snowman in a strange shape on its hood.</p><p>He immediately took out his cellphone to make a call.</p><p>“Honey, what’s today’s date? Which month is it?”</p><p><em>How come I forgot that winter had already come?</em></p><p>……</p><p>In the Ice God Palace, the guests looked at each other in shock, unable to speak for a long time.</p><p>Seizing the time to take photos and videos and email them to her master, Zheng Yu walked out of the hall to find a secluded area where she made a phone call while Qian Qiyue was on the lookout.</p><p>“What happened in the Ice God Sect?” someone asked in a deep, low voice.</p><p>His two disciples, who were usually calm and rational, would not bother him if nothing happened.</p><p>“Master, check your inbox. I’ve sent some photos and videos to you… Shi Jianguo, the elder Shi of the Ice God Sect, just threatened us with his almighty power.” Zheng Yu was still talking incoherently since he had not yet calmed down.</p><p>Huang Ke, the Spear King, spoke without asking more questions. “All right, I’m right near a computer.”</p><p>Though being in his 40s, Huang Ke was still struggling to learn computers as digital devices grew more and more popular presently.</p><p>Hearing the sound of a mouse clicking on the phone, Zheng Yu could do nothing but wait patiently for his master’s comments.</p><p>After a while, Huang Ke broke the silence in a low voice.</p><p>“No wonder he’s a legend…”</p><p>……</p><p>While the car was running quietly, Lou Cheng suddenly heard a snore-like breathing.</p><p>Following the sound, he turned his gaze and found that Geezer Shi had already fallen asleep sitting against the seat and appeared to be very tired.</p><p>“Senior sister, my master is in ill health, isn’t he?” Lou Cheng lowered his voice, but he knew that Shi Yuejian could clearly hear him.</p><p>Shi Yuejian gave him a wry smile. “You can say that it’s not very good, or else I wouldn’t control the drinking of this mighty one of physical invulnerability. But sometimes, I turn a blind eye to it since I don’t want to force a poor old man to quit his hobby…”</p><p>After grumbling for a long while, she concluded, “My father’s only three years older than your headmasters. Most physical-invulnerability warriors are able to keep a youthful appearance like your senior uncle Shen, who looks like a middle-aged man with some gray hair. Anyway, none of them would look like my dad as a man in their 70s or even 80s.”</p><p>“What? My master is just in his 60s… But another senior uncle of mine, the chief of this sect, also looks like an aged man. Why?” Lou Cheng asked in confusion.</p><p>Shi Yuejian was amused. “Our senior uncle is very old actually, for he’s the eldest disciple of his generation and three years older than my dad. His 90th birthday was celebrated last year. As the chief of this sect, every day he would deal with all kinds of sect affairs, heart and soul, so no wonder he is aging quicker than the other physical-invulnerability warriors…”</p><p>She paused to sigh with concern. “Senior uncle had already been a physical-invulnerability warrior and began to help his master to teach his junior sisters and brothers when my dad entered the sect. He was both a teacher and a brother to my dad. Dad would never argue with him about something unless it was of principle…”</p><p>She was actually prompting Lou Cheng.</p><p>” <em>Considering his age, Yang Xianlong should not be senior uncle’s eldest disciple. Maybe his senior sisters and brothers had all died in that age of war…</em> ” Thinking about this, Lou Cheng asked cautiously, “Is master’s poor health caused by past wounds?”</p><p>“Yeah, don’t ask more about this. We’ll let you know when the time is right,” replied Shi Yuejian in a soft voice.</p><p><em>Considering the self-healing capability of a physical-invulnerability warrior, what a bad injury it must be to almost destroy his body!</em></p><p><em>And what a horrible might his enemy must have to be able to injure him so severely!</em></p><p>Lou Cheng was almost struck with fright by the ups and downs of his thoughts.</p><p>“Can it be healed? Have you found any radical cures?” he asked with great concern.</p><p>He should also devote all his efforts to treating Geezer Shi.</p><p>Shi Yuejian slightly shook her head. “None at present. We have tried all kinds of treatments but none of them have succeeded. Hope that the newest military study will come out soon, or maybe those seniors that are studying cultivation methods will make breakthroughs…”</p><p>” <em>Cultivation?</em> ” Lou Cheng was lost in deep thought as if he could see the dawn but had not found the right direction yet.</p><p>“Let’s stop talking about it. Anyway, it’s not difficult for my dad to live seven or eight more years, and maybe the problem will be solved before then.” Shi Yuejian changed the subject into an anecdote of this sect to enliven the atmosphere.</p><p>At that time, Yan Zheke’s response to his videos arrived.</p><p>“What happened? How could it be snowing in June? Or no, August!</p><p>“Cheng, you’re there to formally acknowledge Coach Shi as your master, not to move the heaven to tears~”</p><p>She said jokingly with a “bewilderment” emoji to show her confusion.</p><p>Not to mention that the Ice God Sect was not at the mountaintop, and even if it was, it could not be snowing on such a small mountain as Yanbin during this season!</p><p>Typing with both hands, Lou Cheng summarized what had happened just now in vivid words with the help of the videos.</p><p>“…How powerful Coach Shi is…” Yan Zheke sent a “Dodge” emoji. “Even my grandpa couldn’t be his match…”</p><p>” <em>She only mentioned grandpa instead of both of her grandparents, so her grandpa must be the tougher one…”</em> Lou Cheng thought for a while and said, “I once watched a video of Warrior Sage, and he seemed to be also able to do these kinds of things. But what he made was not a Brutal Blizzard…”</p><p>“Yeah, I’ve watched it, too! So Dragon King should also be able to do this. Cheng, what a terrific master you have!” Yan Zheke acclaimed in surprise and joy, and then sent a “scratching its head” emoji. “But coach Shi seems to be in, in poor health…”</p><p>“Yeah, it is said that he was once badly injured, or he wouldn’t have come to our university to be a coach.” Lou Cheng sent a “sigh with relief” emoji.</p><p>Maybe it was fate…</p><p>All of a sudden, a text from niece Mo arrived.</p><p>“Grandmaster is really a mighty one, I can hardly believe what I’ve seen!”</p><p>Lou Cheng was not afraid of Mo Qianting, he just wanted to keep her at a distance instead of avoiding seeing her or turning a deaf ear to her message. Besides, as a conscientious boy, Lou Cheng did not want to make friends with someone who was so calculating.</p><p>So he just replied politely, “I’m also shocked.”</p><p>“Wow, little uncle finally replied to my message! Hey, I thought that you changed your phone number!” Mo Qianting replied quickly.</p><p>Taking a glance at the text, Lou Cheng decided to ignore that nonsense and continue to chat with his senior sister and Yan Zheke, or log into the forum to see that his area had become more active than before. “Eternal Nightfall” and “Brahman” agreed with what the Weibo article said about the present four Heavenly Sons—Lou Cheng had greatly improved his strength, which was too dream-like for them to accept. So maybe he should be more moderate!</p><p>Without their noticing it, the car had arrived at Shi Yuejian’s house, where Geezer Shi had gotten into the car yesterday.</p><p>“Well, back in the day I would not be tired at all after doing all of this.” Geezer Shi woke up just in time and sighed with emotion. “After all, I’m old.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
