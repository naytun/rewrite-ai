Blood was Qi, Qi was energy and energy was the base of spirit. He felt so fresh and pure as if he could light up his whole surroundings and there was no obstacle in his way anymore.</p><p>The soft and delicate breathing of the girl came into his ears, linking his pulse. A wave of light swung in his heart, echoing the dawn light outside the window.</p><p>Human body big dan, circular and bright.</p><p>Lou Cheng sensed a wonderful feeling. He closed his eyes and held his breath with ears dropped. He tried to be isolated from his own senses, but deep down in his heart and in his mind, he was outlining the scenes outside. The dark brown carpet, the curtains with no shade cloth, the bed with the white quilt, the girl who was sleeping with her body huddling up on one side. Her mouth was shining with the crystal light of dribble. Outside the house, there were birds flying over, an old man jogging, and brilliant sunlight…</p><p>This picture wasn’t totally static, it kept developing and changing. For example, an ant was climbing next to the window trying to come in, but it couldn’t penetrate the smooth glass.</p><p>This wonderful sentiment faded quickly. Lou Cheng opened his eyes, and the “Force Concentration” was off. Looking to the window, he was stunned to see an ant climbing in the sunlight, an ant that wasn’t there before.</p><p>“What is happening?” Lou Cheng felt inexplicable surprise. He wanted to try again but could not grasp the same kind of wonderful feeling.</p><p>Was it because when he transformed the body into a big Dan, the initial blend of the Spirit, qi, and blood and other things stimulated the Jindan, which activated its feature similar to Ice Mirror, or blended other forces?</p><p>Lou Cheng was curious. He intended to explore this in daily training little by little.</p><p>He moved his body a little, feeling the real change from when he’d entered into the Dan stage.</p><p>Since the breakthrough was just a process, not an essential point, he guessed he had improved himself enough. As for now, he didn’t have a thorough improvement. His improvement of the Force Concentration and the power exploding more strongly was just because of the initial blend of spirit, qi, and blood. Using “as the arm moves the finger” was a strange way to describe it, but it indeed expressed better his subtle feeling when he arranged his forces and controlled his body.</p><p>In this respect, since he could do the explosion many times, the simplified version of physical invulnerability, it seemed that he was qualified enough to get the job certificate of Seventh Pin!</p><p>Of course, there was still a big difference between him and the real seventh or eighth pin. Starting from Dan stage, he could refine his physical body, improve his physical strength and exceed the limit of a human body. Force and speed, they were among the keys needed for him to make the most important breakthrough in the future.</p><p>According to some semi-true and false information spread online, the basic essence of “Training the inner radicular pulp” was that the variation came step by step from the spiritual influence of the gene, the combination of visualization, core energy training and the feedback of the universe. Therefore, for people who were close to physical invulnerability, people of high-ranked Dan Stage and the mighty ones who could master physical invulnerability, their descendants could have the variation ability naturally. However, for these experts, it was easy to become possessed by the Devil, causing genetic crash.</p><p>“Phew, another half a year to improve my physical strength, and I can be almost at Seventh Pin…” Lou Cheng thought about this happily. Then he stepped next to the window, and isolated the sunlight by closing the curtain and the shade cloth together to make the room dimmer and more suitable for sleep.</p><p>He looked back at Yan Zheke’s peaceful and pretty face, smiled and whispered in her ears.</p><p>“Coach Yan, I am going to do my morning exercise.”</p><p>He gently left the room and closed the door. He went to a nearby park to consolidate the realm of Danqi.</p><p>Breaking through this threshold, he could really gain a foothold in the martial arts community and begin to provide for Ke’s future!</p><p>No need to waste his time anymore. Lou Cheng would save a lot of time by putting more energy into adapting to this realm. Before his martial art practice had been mainly at the body refining stage. Even if he was now at Dan Stage, he could still use the old moves, but it had to combine with the current features, not to be used indiscriminately.</p><p>And fighting with someone like Qiu Lin, a strong Dan fighter, had made him learn and experience a lot, especially the “Wisdom King Guards Temple”, which gave him some ideas and new directions that he wanted to try.</p><p>His bulging muscles caused friction sounds, which was offset by the blasting boom of rubbing his fists and kicking his legs. Lou Cheng started to make his moves. The more he practiced, the more it became silent, like the roaring waves hidden in the turbulent.</p><p>…</p><p>In a sunny restaurant, full of light, Yu Hong was sitting in the parent position. He squinted his eyes and smiled.</p><p>“The sun in the summer comes out really early… ”</p><p>It gets hot too early!</p><p>He picked up the stack of newspapers next to his hand, casually browsing through it, and waited for his wife to cook him some breakfast.</p><p>“Now only stubborn old men like you still read the newspaper. We all learned to go on the Internet… ” his wife nagged him, carrying a dish from the kitchen.</p><p>“It’s just my habit.” Yu Hong took the plate with a laugh.</p><p>Eating quietly for a moment, the grandchild who had come over to spend his summer break with them, suddenly spoke. “Grandpa, Grandpa, look at this news and these posts from Weibo!”</p><p>“What news?” Puzzled, Yu Hung took the phone.</p><p>He fixed his eyes on it, and was shocked at the headline:</p><p>Shady Deal! Xing Province Youth Tournament Committee Deliberately Suppressed Genius!</p><p>Scrolling down the screen, Yu Hong read quickly to the end. He couldn’t help but proclaim,</p><p>“Absurd!”</p><p>Was there no professional ethics for the journalists these days? This kind of thing could be made into news?</p><p>Something said in a casual conversation should be treated seriously?</p><p>The grandchild looked at him with fear, and whispered, “It’s quite a hot debate online right now.”</p><p>“Really? Let me see.” Yu Hong said with his gloomy seriousness.</p><p>His face gradually turned to a frown as he read all the information on the internet.</p><p>There were two groups of people arguing online. One group advocated that it was just something said in casual conversation and shouldn’t be taken seriously. It was very schematic to make a big deal out of it. This suited Yu Hong’s taste. But another group thought it was impossible that wind had come from the hollow cave, so there must be something behind this. Because reputation was very important in the field of martial arts, it wasn’t surprising that something like this was happening.</p><p>With all the quarreling, the debate was getting more and more attention by not only the people who were usually concerned about the Youth Tournament but also some ordinary people. They rolled up their sleeves and picked their side to quarrel.</p><p>Having looked for a long time, Yu Hong felt that this would not be the case if the debate continued. He picked up his phone to call the chairman of the province’s Martial Artist Association.</p><p>The number of people who were at the high-rank Dan Stage was just a handful, so of course they knew each other.</p><p>“Old Yin, did you see the news about the Shady Deal?” Yu Hong started direct to the point, not beating around the bush.</p><p>Yin Huaming forced a smile. “Yes, of course, I saw it. I didn’t pay much attention, when I first heard that some lip-reading experts had disclosed something about this. But after just one night, this thing has gotten enormous public attention. These journalists just want a scoop, they try to make a name for themselves by criticizing everyone. Qui Lin is so careless, why would she say something so intimidating? Plus, why do the online users care so much about this kind of news? If no one cared, then it would fade soon, so no one takes it seriously.”</p><p>He was whining and complaining.</p><p>“We old fellows don’t know much about the things on the internet. Besides, who knows anyway?” Yu Hong comforted him. “What are you going to do about it?”</p><p>“Have a news conference with Qiu Lin to clarify it. Emphasize the common sense of casual conversation and silent treatment.” Yin Huaming sighed.</p><p>Yu Hong thought about it for a moment, then asked, “What if Lou Cheng draws Han Zhifei or Zhang Zhutong by the lot tonight?”</p><p>Yin Huaming remained silent for a while before replying, “Then it will be one disaster after another, adding insult to injury.”</p><p>Even if one jumped into the Yellow River, one could not wash oneself clean.</p><p>He didn’t wait for Yu Hong’s reply and continued, “There are two ways to solve this. One is to find the reporter who broke the news to draw lots, so it doesn’t matter what result she draws. Second, well, for insurance purpose, do not let Lou Cheng draw Han Zhifei or Zhang Zhutong… ”</p><p>…</p><p>At 8:30 am, already so tired mentally, Lou Cheng put away his stance, bought some breakfast, and returned to the hotel.</p><p>I will harvest a lot in this training!</p><p>The sun had been shining so bright outside, yet inside the room, it was very dim. Lou Cheng found that Yan Zheke was still sleeping. He put down the breakfast gently, took some clothes to change into and left the room again.</p><p>“Hey, Qin Rui, are you up?” He called his old classmate and asked bluntly.</p><p>“Yes, and the morning training is finished already. Want to get some breakfast together? The breakfast at this hotel is quite good.” Qin Rui smiled to answer.</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed. “I’ve already eaten. Can I take a shower in your room?”</p><p>“What’s the matter? Is the bathroom in your room is broken?” Qin Rui asked in surprise.</p><p>Lou Cheng took a breath, “Long story, I can’t bother with the details.”</p><p><em>He couldn’t tell him that Yan Zheke was sleeping in his bed, and he was afraid to wake her up, so couldn’t take a shower in his own room.</em></p><p><em>What would people think?</em></p><p>“Well, okay.” Qin Rui thought it was strange, but he agreed anyway.</p><p>After showering, Lou Cheng was back in his room and sat at the edge of the bed next to the girl. Watching her pure and flawless face, he suddenly felt like he needed to take a nap as well.</p><p>He took off his pants, pulled back the quilt, cautiously moved on the bed and lay down next to his fairy.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s arms naturally stretched out to him, and the warm temperature from his body woke her up. Eyes still fogged with sleep, she stammered,</p><p>“You, you, me… ”</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>“I came to catch up on sleep.” He laughed, with his left arm against the bed to support his body.</p><p>Sleep… Yan Zheke looked out the window at a loss, “What time is it?”</p><p>“Almost nine o’clock. I have finished the morning exercises, and brought you some breakfast.” Lou Cheng laughed again, “But you are really easy to wake up, even if my movement is quiet.”</p><p>“I was just sleeping and suddenly there was one more body beside me. It would be strange if you didn’t wake me up!” Yan Zheke rolled her eyes and gradually recalled what had happened before. Then she grumbled, “Why didn’t you wake me up! We agreed that we were gonna do the exercises together!”</p><p>“I saw that you were sleeping very peacefully. I didn’t have the heart to wake you up.” Lou Cheng was getting closer to his fairy, touching her skin.</p><p>Yan Zheke pouted playfully. “I was just feeling a little sleepy. I wanted to take a nap for a while, to refresh myself, so that I could do the exercise better. I thought that you would remind me in time, but, humph!”</p><p>After the painful waiting of half a night, Yan Zheke felt so assured and comfortable kissing Cheng. The sudden relax had made her feel sleepy and tired immediately.</p><p>As Lou Cheng was trying to hold her in his arms, she pushed back the quilt and got off the bed from the other side.</p><p>“You, where are you going?” asked Lou Cheng, a little bit disappointed.</p><p>Yan Zheke didn’t look back. She pouted and said gruffly,</p><p>“To change my pajamas!”</p><p>“Well, I’m waiting for you yo~ ” Lou Cheng responded happily and deliberately copied the way the little fairy talked.</p><p>“Aha, you are getting funnier and funnier!” Yan Zheke was squatting next to her trolley case and then she laughed so hard that she couldn’t even stand straight. Her blush had deepened when she’d said “Change my pajamas,” and now it was returning to normal.</p><p>She went to brush her teeth and put cotton pajamas on. She closed her eyes and worked up the courage to get back into the bed. Then she put her foot on Lou Cheng’s lap and chuckled, “Hairy legs!”</p><p>The familiar body temperature, familiar smell and familiar feeling, made her dizzy. Thinking about the half-naked picture that Lou Cheng had sent to her, she couldn’t help but giggle.</p><p>“What?” Lou Cheng asked, feeling her skin.</p><p>“Nothing, just feel like laughing.” Yan Zheke lied on one side, and curiously put her hand on his abdomen.</p><p>The room was dim, and their bodies were very close. Some secret fragrance was floating between their noses, and Lou Cheng’s breathing had become very heavy. His heartbeat sped up and his body became excited.</p><p>Yan Zheke was also a fighter and had good listening skills, so she sensed it immediately. She patted Lou Cheng, blushing.</p><p>“Sleep tight!”</p><p><em>What was she thinking about!?</em></p><p>“It’s hard not to have a reaction when I see you,” he replied, helplessly.</p><p>“But I also need to sleep well.” Yan Zheke adjusted her body, well-behaved, and secretly snickered.</p><p>“Ok, ok. Sleep.” Lou turned around and hugged her, forcing himself to freeze into ice.</p><p>…</p><p>A day of “ear to ear and temple to temple”, Yan Zheke went to find Gu Shuang and did her exercises, meanwhile Lou Cheng accompanied his family and friends for dinner.</p><p>In the evening, after having studied all the information about the other candidates, Lou Cheng took a deep breath, stood up and said,</p><p>“I should go to the stadium.”</p><p>Yan Zheke stood up as well and helped him to arrange his collar on tiptoe. She kissed him on his face and encouraged him:</p><p>“Go for it!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
