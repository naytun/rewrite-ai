Therefore, he had seen this rather memorable-looking reporter a couple of times.</p><p>Shu Rui remembered the no-interview rule before a match clearly, so she had no choice but to stand up and smile sweetly.</p><p>“Hello to you too. Do your best~”</p><p>After the short exchange of regards, Zhou Zhengquan stared straightly ahead and walked forwards with steady footsteps and a straight back.</p><p>It was only when they left the reporter’s seat that Hou Yue moved closer to his senior brother with a look of excitement on his face. He lowered his voice and asked, “Senior brother Zhou, why didn’t you chat longer with reporter Shu?”</p><p>As a standard hyperactive eighteen years old teenager, the next thing Hou Yue enjoyed gossiping the most other than martial arts was games and girls. Every time they met Shu Rui or watched Yan Zheke in her match videos, they would often bring them up in discussion with his senior and junior brothers later. Now that they ran into Shu Rui in the flesh again, he couldn’t help but tease Zhou Zhengquan a little about her.</p><p>“Accepting interviews before a match makes one susceptible to emotions.” Zhou Zhengquan answered calmly and indifferently.</p><p>“That’s true…” Hou Yue nodded. Then he winked and said again, “Senior brother Zhou, do you have plans to get her phone number or QQ ID or something later?”</p><p>Zhou Zhengquan let out a soft laugh.</p><p>“No, I don’t.”</p><p>Asking a girl for contact on my own accord would damage my image!</p><p>“Monkey, can’t you focus a little more on the match?” Li Shengnan was perceptive, and she scolded Hou Yue when she heard what he said.</p><p>Hou Yue stuck out his tongue in secret before answering with all smiles,</p><p>“Got it! I’m always focused when in a match. But it hasn’t started yet, has it?”</p><p>Meanwhile, Shu Rui watched the team vanishing into the locker room’s entrance and shook her head. She let out a sneer and said,</p><p>“What a showy person…”</p><p>Do you really think there’s a kind of man that I haven’t met yet in my life?</p><p>…</p><p>When Lou Cheng, Yan Zheke and the others reached the martial arts arena, there weren’t many audiences yet in the venue. However, the students they ran into along the way often recognized them the moment they saw their attire and temperament. Even if they didn’t, they would know that he was the leading player of the Martial Arts Club, Lou Cheng from the incredibly identifiable Yan Zheke beside him.</p><p>“Do your best! Everyone in our dorm had come over to cheer for you all!” A candid male student swung his fist in midair.</p><p>“Do your best, Lou Cheng!” Although the girl’s voice was obviously shaking from embarrassment, she ultimately gathered her courage and shouted out the words.</p><p>Lou Cheng didn’t expect that he would receive such warm treatment, and he wasn’t sure how he should react on the spot. In the end, he could only return the greeting by nodding, waving and smiling stiffly…</p><p>With a smile on her face, Yan Zheke restrained the laughter that was about to escape her lungs and walked forwards calmly as if she didn’t recognize the guy beside her.</p><p>It was only when they were about to reach the locker room’s entrance that she let out a faint chuckle and said,</p><p>“It feels good to be a ‘superstar’, isn’t it?”</p><p>Lou Cheng gave his stiff facial muscles a rub before smiling bitterly. “I finally understood what it means to be ‘overwhelmed by favor’…”</p><p>This was the support of his fellow students!</p><p>They were both a pressure and a driving force behind his back!</p><p>While overwhelmed by emotions, he pushed the locker room’s door open and allowed Yan Zheke to enter first. He and the rest of the team followed closely behind her.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The bustling noise that filled the martial arts arena was isolated outside.</p><p>…</p><p>At 3 p.m. sharp, all the participants of the preliminaries gathered inside the locker room. Geezer Shi took a sip of wine, wiped his mouth and surveyed the surroundings once before chuckling. “Little Yan, you may speak for this pre-match meeting again.”</p><p>“Me again?” Yan Zheke was both annoyed and amused.</p><p>Just who is the real coach here? I’m throwing in the towel!</p><p>Everyone including Lou Cheng broke into big or small laughter after they heard their conversation. The tension that were brewing prior to a match instantly dissipated by a lot. Even Lin Que had drawn an indiscernible curve along his lips to express that brief moment of amusement he felt.</p><p>Yan Zheke rolled her eyes at her boyfriend before pursing her lips and said, “Judging from Wensheng School’s usual conduct and the fact that they’d won the first match, I believe that they’ll take the steady approach. They’d likely strive to make as little mistakes as possible.”</p><p>Fine, I’ll speak! I’ve discussed this plenty of times with Cheng anyway!</p><p>She didn’t describe the depth of thinking the analysis in detail, however. This was to prevent everyone from being confused by it.</p><p>“This means that they’ll still not risk starting off with their Eight Pin Dan stage fighter, or leaving him for the last match. They’d send out Zhou Zhengquan second just like last time.” The girl’s eyes were firm as she declared this confidently. “If Zhou Zhengquan went up first and ran into the Lin Que-Lou Cheng order, then they may very well repeat Fearless Squad’s fate and be taken out by Lou Cheng’s abnormal stamina. But if they sent him out last, there’s also the risk that we may start with Lou Cheng and cause them to lose two matches in a row.”</p><p>Her analysis was built on the basis that the enemy had no idea that even Cheng could become tired or exhausted.</p><p>Judging from what happened on and after the match, it would appear that she was the only one who realized this!</p><p>“So they’ll be going with the same lineup as last time?” Sun Jian raised his hand and asked.</p><p>Yan Zheke shook her head in a very coach-like manner. “More or less, yes, but I believe that they’d make some minor tweaks to their lineup and put Hou Yue at the last.”</p><p>“Why is that?” Li Mao and Guo Qing asked in unison.</p><p>“Wensheng School knew very well that they couldn’t hide the fact that Hou Yue possessed a supernatural ability from us. Therefore, he was no longer usable as a surprise factor. Also, his fighting style works very well as the last member of the lineup.” Yan Zheke answered him with bright and spirited eyes, “Imagine this: if we go by the Lou Cheng-Lin Que order, then as long as Zhou Zhengquan performed relatively well during his match, Lin Que would be weary and weakened even if he wasn’t as exhausted as he was during the previous match. This outcome is perfect for someone who is well versed in the Monkey style like him.”</p><p>“Moreover, his supernatural ability is pretty special. Even if Lin Que is guarded and alert against it, once he’s weakened he’d still be easy for prey to his ability’s influence.”</p><p>“If we let Lin Que go first, then he’d be worn down regardless if he goes up against Zhuo Yanjun or Li Shengnan. Some pressure will be lifted off Zhou Zhengquan’s shoulders, and as a Dan stage fighter, even if she couldn’t beat Lou Cheng at his full might, there is a high chance that she’d be able to injure Lou Cheng. After all, the ‘Waterfall’ move of Fly Fall Punch is somewhat similar to Tremor Punch.”</p><p>“Lou Cheng may have abnormal stamina, but it doesn’t mean that he is indestructible. If Zhou Zhengquan left a lasting effect on him, then he’d face great trouble when going up against Hou Yue’s hit-and-run style.”</p><p>Sun Jiang understood Yan Zheke’s words and felt that it made a lot of sense. However, another question popped up in his mind: “If Hou Yue is so suited to fight last, then why didn’t Donglin Squad do so during the previous match?”</p><p>“First, they were planning to surprise us with his supernatural ability. Second, Hou Yue’s fighting style is extremely exhausting to himself too. Also, we’ve only talked about Lou Cheng and Lin Que but not you, senior brother Sun Jian.” Yan Zheke smiled faintly. “Hou Yue will be exhausted after he took them out. He may not necessarily be able to beat you afterward, so it’s likely that they might lose the match with a 2 to 3 score. That’s why they sought for victory last time, and stability this time.”</p><p>When she was done speaking, she swept a glance across everyone’s faces and finally remembered a thing called embarrassment. She spoke with a slight blush on her face,</p><p>“My analysis is finished.”</p><p>In the end, the final say of the lineup fell in Coach Shi’s hands.</p><p>Beside Yan Zheke, Lou Cheng took the momentary pause to ponder about the pros and cons of the timing of his appearance.</p><p>If appeared first, then he would be fighting Zhou Zhengquan at his peak. With Zhou Zhengquan’s strength and experience, he might not necessarily find the chance to use ‘Severe Warning.’ Therefore, the only good thing about this matchup was that he wouldn’t be weary from Hou Yue’s supernatural ability and would definitely do better than he did at Donglin. He would have the chance to force out multiple bursts from the enemy.</p><p>If he appeared later, then Zhou Zhengquan’s strength would fall off considerably after battling Lin Que. He was confident that he could create an opportunity to use ‘Severe Warning’ then. However, the problem was that ‘Severe Warning’ put a lot of burden on his current self, and it wasn’t like he had nothing else to do after beating Zhou Zhengquan. There was still Hou Yue waiting for him as his next opponent. This meant that he wouldn’t be able to drop all thoughts of retreat, caution, and reservation of strength and stake it all against Zhou Zhengquan for the opportunity to use ‘Severe Warning’.</p><p>It would appear that going first would be the better choice for him.</p><p>However, Lou Cheng didn’t make the most advantageous choice for himself. This was because he noticed another problem.</p><p>They must win this match with a 3-1 victory to have a chance at turning things around. This meant that the person who showed up later absolutely couldn’t afford to lose, and would bear the full pressure of winning the match for the squad. It was one thing if Lin Que won, but if he lost then it would be a huge blow to him judging from the amount of pride and desire for victory he displayed, and the apology he forced out of his mouth during his large match. He would be filled with guilt; guilt strong enough to upset even a normal person for a long time, much less a guy with a bit of mental illness like him.</p><p>He could not put the burden on him. He could not worsen his condition!</p><p>He wasn’t pitying Lin Que, but protecting him. He didn’t do this just for Yan Zheke’s sake, but also because they shared a bond of comradeship built from being the two greatest pillars of the Martial Arts Club, and fighting side by side for many matches!</p><p>His shoulders were used exactly for this moment as a leading player and a man!</p><p>I’ll be the one to bear this burden!</p><p>Lou Cheng exhaled and interrupted Geezer Shi before he could speak,</p><p>“Coach, I wish to go second!”</p><p>His teammates immediately focused their gazes on him. There were puzzlement, astonishment, worry and rare surprise.</p><p>Volunteers seldom occurred in this team!</p><p>Lin Que pursed his lips and took a step forwards. He stared straight into Geezer Shi’s eyes and said,</p><p>“Coach, I’d like to go second!”</p><p>Lou Cheng had predicted this reaction from Lin Que from the beginning. While complaining about his brother-in-law’s strong pride, he explained his reasons with a calm look on his face, “I learned a killer move as of late. It’ll be perfect to use after Zhou Zhengquan had gotten weak.”</p><p>Geezer Shi chuckled. “I see that everyone’s eager to contribute their strength. I know that Lou Cheng has recently learned his killer move, so he shall appear second.”</p><p>Lin Que turned his head and cast a deep glance at Lou Cheng. Finally, he gave Lou Cheng an imperceptible nod.</p><p>He retreated back to his corner and no longer said anything.</p><p>“The order will be Lin Que, Lou Cheng and Sun Jian. Please make your final adjustments before the match starts.” Geezer Shi said leisurely.</p><p>Yan Zheke was an incredibly smart girl. She figured out her boyfriend’s thoughts the moment he made his offer. Therefore, after she pulled him away and sat down at a different corner of the locker room, she lowered her voice with dimples on her cheeks. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Do we still need to say thanks between us?” Lou Cheng cracked a joke from the past.</p><p>Yan Zheke rolled her eyes at him before shooting a smile. “I’m saying on behalf of my cousin!”</p><p>“Your cousin doesn’t need to thank me either, unless he doesn’t think of me as his comrade!” Lou Cheng said seriously. However, he thought his reply was overly serious, and so he chuckled in a low tone and said, “Unless he doesn’t think of me as his brother-in-law!”</p><p>Yan Zheke stared embarrassedly at the guy who was growing more and more thick-skinned every day. She itched to give him a pinch, but when she recalled that he was about to go into battle, she forcefully restrained the urge and let out an angry humph.</p><p>Lou Cheng felt happy listening to the girl’s coquettish protest. He closed his eyes and prepared to rest.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s expression grew soft as she watched his movements with spirited eyes. She moved next to his ears and whispered softly,</p><p>“Cheng, you’re so good~!”</p><p>Now this was the proper thank you a girlfriend should say to her boyfriend!</p><p>The corner of Lou Cheng’s lips immediately curled upwards, but he didn’t open his eyes. He simply grabbed Yan Zheke’s delicate hands and drew strength from it so he could better steady himself better.</p><p>This was pressure, but also a driving force behind his back!</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the away team’s locker room, Wensheng School’s leader Ni Mingfei cast a glance across his disciples’ faces. Hou Yue immediately stopped running all over the locker room.</p><p>“We’ll focus on steadiness this match. Zhengquan shall enter second just like last time. This way, he could be fight offensively or defensively.” Ni Mingfei said concisely but comprehensively, “Little Yue, they must be on guard against your supernatural ability now, so you’ll go last. You must win even if you have to eke out a victory. Yanjun, you’re the vanguard. Be it Lou Cheng or Lin Que, you must remember no matter who your opponent is, don’t be afraid, and perform at your usual standard. Do you all understand?”</p><p>“We understand!” Hou Yue and Zhuo Yanjun answered in unison. Meanwhile, Zhou Zhengquan took out his own crimson black colored martial arts suit and went into the shower room.</p><p>…</p><p>At 3:27 p.m., Fang Juexiao suddenly looked up spiritedly inside Songcheng TV Station’s broadcast room. He said to the guest Gan Le beside him,</p><p>“They came out. Both sides had come out!”</p><p>The BGM of the broadcast was filled with the noise of blowing trumpets.</p><p>The participants of the first match were made clear after they obtained the fresh list of names and order:</p><p>Lin Que would be battling Zhuo Yanjun once more!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
