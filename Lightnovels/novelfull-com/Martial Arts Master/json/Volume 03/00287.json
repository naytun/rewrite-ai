Good.” The lines at the corners of He Yi’s eyes gradually softened. “I watched your last two matches. You’ve gone beyond the Professional Eighth Pin within one year… Possibly already at the Professional Seventh Pin. It is rare as hen’s teeth in our Ice God Sect’s history.”</p><p>“Hmm… Master Uncle knows better than master… ” Lou Cheng gave a silent judgment before answering with a smile, “I can’t reach Professional Seventh Pin within one year. I won’t sign up for the October’s Ranking Event. I’m preparing for the April one.”</p><p>I defeated Zhang Zhutong and Han Zhifei because no one knew about my abnormal physical strength. The rival made a bad decision and I was blessed with good fortune and quick wit. I got the championship of the Youth Tournament with great difficulty, during which I’ve revealed my condition to the world.</p><p>I’ll have a less than 50/50 chance of qualifying the Professional Seventh Pin if I attend the October Ranking Event. Better to wait until my foundation becomes firm and my body limits are surpassed to sign up for the next Ranking Event in end of April or beginning of May with everything under control.</p><p>The prerequisite, of course, is there’s no significant difference in strength improvement when the Jindan is pressed again.</p><p>He Yi nodded his approval. “That’s good. Not imperious or short-tempered like your master in his youth.”</p><p>“I was full of energy!” Retorted the grey-haired Geezer Shi Jianguo.</p><p>He Yi shook his head with a smile, “The childhood shows the man and vice versa. Okay. Take Youth Lou to settle at Songtao Pavilion. Tomorrow morning 9:15 sharp he’ll become an apprentice officially.”</p><p>He turned to Lou Cheng. “Tomorrow we’ll just go through the motions</p><p>. You are pretty much already a disciple of our sect and here is your home. Don’t feel tied up. Take a walk tonight and communicate with your fellow disciples. Don’t be shy. Everyone is friendly.”</p><p>He emphasized the word friendly as if it was final.</p><p>“Don’t get too close to Tingxuan Pavilion so the guests won’t be disturbed. There are guests from Haixi Sect, Dinghai Sect, and Hanchi Sect for the ceremony,” added He Yi.</p><p>“Guests for the ceremony?” Lou Cheng blurted out in surprise.</p><p>Isn’t it too much?</p><p>“We are of the same breath and branches all these years to achieve the current situation. They came with good intentions and we can’t turn them away,” said He Yi thoughtfully.</p><p>“Hey, we old blokes are here. Let them watch. What could happen?” Said Geezer Shi gruffly. “I’ll take him to Songtao Pavilion.”</p><p>He Yi nodded. “Go ahead. If you are too tired, wait for tomorrow to meet your fellow disciples.”</p><p>Watching the two step away from Ice Queen Pavilion, a robust man came down the stairs. Appearing to be around 40 years old, his eyes bore heaviness and vicissitudes, his hair black and skin with few lines.</p><p>“Master, isn’t this ceremony too serious?” asked the man with a frown.</p><p>He Yi laughed, “Serious? It wouldn’t be necessary if it was only a man of the Professional Seventh or Eighth Pin to join the sect. But he reached this level in less than one year… He’s not even 20 years old yet.</p><p>“You’ve heard his conversation with your Uncle Shi. He’s not interested in management. Xianlong, don’t think too much or secretly make mischief, which would ruin the atmosphere of the sect and make us a joke in front of the Haixi Sect and Dinghai Sect.”</p><p>This is the eldest disciple Yang Xianlong, a 50-year-old Professional Fourth Pin Dan stage fighter, in charge of the Bingshen Sect’s routine matters.</p><p>His brows were not soothed. He muttered out of concern, “The spoken words fly.”</p><p>“So you want a contract? They have given their words before me. They won’t break their promises as long as I’m still capable.” He Yi shook his head. “Tell Lei Fang. If he can reach the physical invulnerability, it will be his and no one can take from him. But if he can’t and someone else succeeds first, it’s not his and he can’t get it. Strength is everything in a martial arts sect. He can get rid of one or two with his relations and outside support but he can’t push out everyone.”</p><p>“Yes, master.” Yang Xianlong bowed low before turning around to leave from the Ice Queen Pavilion.</p><p>Standing in the lonely room, He Yi heaved a long sigh.</p><p>…</p><p>The Songtao Pavilion had a great view of a sea of trees dancing with the wind from the second-floor window.</p><p>“Don’t stroll about tonight and have a good rest. Tomorrow you get over with the ceremony, take a look at your fellow disciples and come to mine. I’ve got the visualizing chart of the Zhu Rong Force.” Geezer Shi disappeared quickly with four bottles of the original-proof spirit.</p><p>“Zhu Rong Force?” Lou Cheng was full of joy and anticipation.</p><p>It had been a long journey and he felt a bit tired mentally. Chatting with his fairy in bed while bullshitting with his friends and browsing forums and Weibo, he felt free from restraints and had no intention to make friends with his fellow disciples.</p><p>Half a day’s leisure from an ephemeral existence!</p><p>After dinner served in the room, he took out his laptop, planning to play some game before a video call with Yan Zheke.</p><p>Ke is visiting someone.</p><p>“Anybody fancies a game? I’ll ask again if no one is available now.” Lou Cheng sent the same message to his university dorm group and high school friends group.</p><p>Little Ming laughed, “You are either spending time with Yan Zheke or busy in the Challenge Tournament when we are short of hands. Now you are free and want a game with us? You can’t have everything. Treat us to some seafood at least. Bro Cheng… Master Cheng… The award money was 600,000!”</p><p>“You see the bills? I can buy so many presents for my Ke. Why should I buy you any seafood?”</p><p>To quibble with Casanova every day can be fun.</p><p>“Gross! You are getting nastier and nastier! Your Ke… ” Cai Zongming was close to throwing up. “Your fingers are more and more flexible and your head more and more responsive. Playing with you is not fun… ”</p><p>Of course, it’s no fun to be bullied all the time…</p><p>“I’ve been holding back or the screen would have been broken.” Lou Cheng laughed loud with his hands on his waist. “By the way, Casanova, how’s your training in the summer holiday?”</p><p>“Ha-hah… I find no match in my city. That would be bragging. Honestly, I think I’m the best in my compound. I’ve made great progress, close to the Amateur Second or Third Pin level,” answered Cai Zongming with some hesitation.</p><p>Qin Mo the Beast, a rich kid from Songcheng and a roommate of Cai Zongming’s, interrupted, “Excellent! You are both here. Please help me vote! One phone number can give vote ten times.”</p><p>“What vote?” asked Lou Cheng casually.</p><p>“An evaluation. Vote for my Jingting!” Qin Mo sent a link to a poll of a music program.</p><p>“Holy cow! I can’t believe you beast is a true fan!” Cai Zongming jeered at him mercilessly, showing his nature of a talker.</p><p>Qin Mo looks up in the wind. “There is a white beam of moonlight in everyone’s heart. She happened to hit me.”</p><p>“Get lost! Jingting is mine!” Old Qiu gave his usual response.</p><p>Zhao Qiang the Erudite sighed, “It’s the estrus again… All we can do is to give some insignificant help.”</p><p>Reading this random conversation, Lou Cheng’s lips twitched.</p><p>I was once a fan of Mo Jingting’s shows and songs. Not… She’s nothing like the image her company created for her. Meeting someone in person is not as good as knowing her by her reputation!</p><p>Jiang Fei responded before he could answer. A few of them began to play.</p><p>As soon as Yan Zheke got online at home, Lou Cheng immediately pretended to fall offline, defrauding his teammates.</p><p>A message from Nephew Mo came in during his video call.</p><p>“Junior master, is Munekado beautiful at night?”</p><p>“Nope! Go away!” Lou Cheng gave a silent judgment before putting his mobile away. He continued with the video call and planned to reply when he got time but he soon forgot.</p><p>…</p><p>On the second floor of Tingxuan Pavilion, a well-shaped long-haired girl was watching the sea of pine trees at night.</p><p>“Sister, why do you think Master sent us here to watch the ceremony? Their senior masters are here and we are no match.” A youth with a cherubic face came out of a room.</p><p>The long-haired girl laughed, “Simple. We stand there for comparison. A 25-year-old high Pin fighter and a 22-year-old Six Pin fighter. This is a comparison.”</p><p>“That Lou Cheng has reached the Seventh Pin within one year. Pretty impressive.” The youth with a cherubic face flung up his hands and started to browse Weibo.</p><p>All of a sudden, his eyes shone upon seeing a hot piece of news.</p><p>“Apotheosis of Young Fighters in Xingsheng – Four Heavenly Sons!”</p><p>The most liked comment was:</p><p>“Do they deserve to be called Heavenly Sons? In my opinion, only Peng Leyun and Ren Li of their generation can live up to this reputation!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
