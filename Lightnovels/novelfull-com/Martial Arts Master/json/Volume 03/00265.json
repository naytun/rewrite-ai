When he picked up the phone, he found the message notifications on his phone almost full.</p><p>So many? Lou Cheng opened it in surprise and scrolled down to read the messages one by one.</p><p>Du Liyu gave him a “thumbs up”, and said, “Cheng, you’re awesome! You’re the only one whom I appreciate in this class! Come on, advance into the semi-finals!”</p><p>Xing Chengwu sent a short message: “Haha, Lou, good. You made a good reputation for Xiushan. Keep up the good fight and fully exert yourself!”</p><p>His high school teacher, Old Wu, also left a text message: “Very good, very good, Lou Cheng. I hope you will develop more and more in the field of martial arts and go further and further!”</p><p>Lou Yuanwei sent a “surprising face eyes” emoji, “Cheng, when you come back and then we can talk more about it… Our grandpa lets me tell you that you are the pride of our family.”</p><p>Wu Ting said, “Lou Sir, you were hot! You are totally gonna enter the top four (strewing flowers to the sky emoji)!”</p><p>Zhang Qiufan sent a “smiling” emoji and said, “Lou Sir is terrific!”</p><p>Wei Renjie said concisely, “Congratulations on entering the top eight.”</p><p>…</p><p>Surprised by all the congratulatory messages from his friends and family, Lou Cheng felt so much pride and joy.</p><p>The prime-time relay of Xing Province Satelite Television was really outstanding!</p><p>It was no surprise that his High school homeroom teacher, Old Wu had recognized him because he was a martial arts lover. He was always paying attention to The Youth Tournament. But he hadn’t expected that even his cousins had seen it!</p><p>He wondered if his Empress Dowager and his future father-in-law had watched it. If they did, how had they judged his performance?</p><p>Lou Cheng was happy to share this with Yan Zheke. He found his ointment and began to cure today’s wounds. Fighting head-on with a metalized fist wasn’t a laughing matter. It had been even more painful than punching a steal iron plate!</p><p>…</p><p>Yan Zheke finalized the last thing, she felt so content and relieved.</p><p>Don’t bother Cheng with this kind of little thing, he always praises me!</p><p>At this point, she heard the airport radio broadcasting a notice. Her flight would be delayed by an hour.</p><p>A little bit of worried, she logged on the software to see the situation and she found that due to weather, the flight couldn’t land and the plane was about to land at the airport of the neighboring province. That is to say, it might be late for more than an hour, and the flight could even be canceled.</p><p>“Oh, so outrageous,” she muttered to herself.</p><p>But still, she had to keep smiling and chat with Cheng. She couldn’t let him find out that her flight had been canceled, he might worry, and it would affect his rest.</p><p>Yan Zheke took a deep breath and she was going to reply to Lou Cheng but at that moment she received his new message: “Ke Ke, your flight will be late for an hour?”</p><p>“How do you know?” Yan Zheke was shocked and confused.</p><p>“Jiang Nan Fei Xing province, 10:05 pm. With these two pieces of information, I would be an idiot if I couldn’t find the flight number. When I checked it online, there was an app that sends updates on this flight so I downloaded it.”</p><p>Watching him ramble to boast himself, Yan Zheke was very touched. She started to smile again gradually, her bad mood seemed to have dissipated a lot. She whispered to herself, “Such a fool.”</p><p>Lou Cheng said, “You are going to arrive at two o’clock in the morning? Won’t you be too tired?”</p><p>Yan Zheke said, “It’s fine. It’s normal for the plane to be very late (trying not to cry sticker).”</p><p>In the past, she would have been reluctant to wait all night for the flight. She would rather just cancel it and arrange accommodation to avoid waiting so long. But this time she wanted to wait. She didn’t want to postpone for another day.</p><p>I can’t let her feel so bored waiting… With this idea in mind, Lou Cheng chatted with the girl until almost 11 pm.</p><p>Unfortunately, the flight was then delayed again until 12:30 pm.</p><p>Painfully, Lou Cheng suggested said, “Maybe your cousin can pick you up? And then come back tomorrow?”</p><p>Even if he did not have flight experience, he could see that his girlfriend wouldn’t be able to take the flight until 1 am.</p><p>Yan Zheke pursed her lips, and replied, “I’ve waited so long already, I can’t give up now. If there is a delay again, I will go back!”</p><p>If it was delayed again, she would just cancel the flight.</p><p>Lou Cheng said, “This makes me think of a famous quote, ‘I’m here anyway’.” Lou Cheng deliberately lightened the atmosphere to ease his girlfriend’s feelings.</p><p>Yan Zheke said, “Haha… Don’t ever say this again. Owing to this sentence, I’ve suffered many losses!” Yan Zheke smiled and suddenly she felt that waiting wasn’t so tough.</p><p>Lou Cheng wanted to ask her what kind of losses, but in light of the current situation, he decided to ask her later.</p><p>Lou Cheng asked, “Is Gu Shuang still coming to pick you up?”</p><p>“I don’t know yet. I’m not even sure whether I can take the flight tonight or not. I told her that she can sleep first and I’ll call her when I land.” Yan Zheke had arranged everything already.</p><p>Before Lou Cheng started the next topic, she realized something and said, “You still haven’t slept yet! What time is it? You have the game tomorrow (frowning sticker)!”</p><p>When Coach Yan got angry, Lou Cheng’s heart trembled. He explained, “I’m just afraid that you will feel lonely. Plus, my match is in the evening. I can catch up on sleep tomorrow afternoon.”</p><p>Yan Zheke smiled very lightly. “I am not a child anymore.” She replied with an embarrassing emoji.</p><p>Lou Cheng said, “You are not a child, but you are a little fairy lol!” Lou Cheng typed at the keyboard quickly, laughing.</p><p>Yan Zheke raised her eyebrows, tilted her head, and then replied, “Well okay, you’d better sleep. I’m a little sleepy, and I’ll take a nap for a while. When I board, I’ll send you a message. But you aren’t allowed to reply because you need to sleep well!”</p><p>“Ok, well, good night. Don’t catch cold while sleeping.” Lou Cheng exhorted again.</p><p>Ke Ke had told him that the airport’s air-conditioning was very strong.</p><p>He put down the phone and turned on the mode of concealment of spirit and qi, Lou Cheng fell into sleep rapidly. But he didn’t sleep very well. He was concerned about someone, waiting for a message.</p><p>Ding! The sound of his phone. He awakened immediately, and grabbed his phone.</p><p>Yan Zheke said, “Finally… (burst into tears sticker)”</p><p>It was 00:50 am.</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled with the emoji of patting your head sticker.</p><p>Yan Zheke said, “Go back to sleep(glaring anger face emoji)!” Yan Zheke asked the air hostess for a blanket gently.</p><p>Feeling more assured, Lou Cheng fell into sleep again but this time he slept more deeply, and he didn’t turn the phone into silent mode.</p><p>Then, he woke up again because of the app reminder: Due to airport traffic control, the flight can’t take off until 2 am.</p><p>Yan Zheke hadn’t told him, because with the blanket covering her body, half an hour ago she had already fallen asleep.</p><p>If take off was at two, the plane would land at five o’clock. Lou Cheng set his alarm for 4:50 am.</p><p><em>Getting up half an hour earlier won’t be that different, besides I can catch up on sleep again in the afternoon!</em></p><p>…</p><p>At 4:50 am, when the clock rang, Lou Cheng got up immediately without any struggle and stopped the alarm.</p><p>He picked up the phone, looked first to see whether there was any message from Yan Zheke. With no message received, he determined the landing time with the application, 5:15 am.</p><p>I guess I could make it on time? Keke said that it takes more than 10 minutes to get out of the airport… Lou Cheng washed his face quickly, rinsed his mouth, changed clothes and dashed out of the room with his wallet.</p><p>The Gao Fen was very peaceful at 5 o’clock in the morning, only the road lamp was lit up. The air was crisp and fresh without the hustle and bustle of daylight.</p><p>The road was empty, only the occasional car sped by from time to time. While looking for a taxi, Lou Cheng thought about a famous saying, and then said to himself with a secret smile on his face, “Now I know how Gao Feng looks at 5 o’clock in the morning.”</p><p>Under normal circumstances, outside the nice hotel, there was no shortage of taxis. It didn’t take long for Lou Cheng to get a taxi. When he got into the car he sent Yan Zheke a message: I am on my way to the airport. I’ll pick you up. No need to call Gu Shuang.</p><p>No traffic jams, the car ride felt as smooth as wind. Lou Cheng sat in the back seat, resting with his eyes closed.</p><p>At 5:20 a.m., the app notification and Yan Zheke’s message arrived one after another.</p><p>“Hum, are you able to bargain?” Yan Zheke sent an “angry face” emoji.</p><p>Lou Cheng typed his message in a pleasant mood: Just half an hour earlier than usual, no big deal. I will sleep again in the afternoon.</p><p>Soon I get to see Ke Ke!</p><p>Yan Zheke said, “Humph! You’re here anyway. What can I do!” Yan Zheke sent a (There’s nothing I can do) sticker, but when she typed the words “You’re here anyway”, she suddenly smiled and felt a kind of sweetness.</p><p><em>I didn’t mean what I said…</em></p><p>The car at night drove so fast. Lou Cheng entered into the arrival hall and waited for his fairy whom he kept yearning for day and night. After a few minutes, he saw her walk out with her luggage.</p><p>She wore a very simple, plain white T-shirt, jeans and sneakers, she also had a knitted garment. She had bright eyes and graceful eyebrows, delicate facial features, as always.</p><p>Lou Cheng gazed at her for a few seconds, then he went over to her, took her suitcase and held her slightly cold hands, like a long time couple walking towards outside.</p><p><em>Unfortunately, there are many people here …</em></p><p>Yan Zheke bowed her head down with her hanging hair. Her face was flushed red, following Lou Cheng quietly.</p><p>After a few steps, Lou Cheng laughed lightly and said,</p><p>“It’s like taking my wife back home.”</p><p>“Pooh, how cheeky and shameless you are… ” Yan Zheke turned to look in another direction and pretended to rebuke him, but in her eyes there was an apparent shyness.</p><p>“Come to my place and rest a little bit? Wait until Gu Shuang has slept enough.” Lou Cheng proposed.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s eyes dropped and she agreed, “I need to send her a message, let her sleep peacefully.”</p><p>Seeing the girl agree so easily, Lou Cheng felt her trust in him. Though his heart felt warm, he still teased her,</p><p>“Trust me so easily? You’re not afraid of me doing bad things?”</p><p>Yan Zheke gave him a cold stare, “Well, you have to do your morning exercises and train for the match. I’m not afraid at all.”</p><p>“I’m a person of formidable physical strength,” Lou Cheng cracked a joke.</p><p>Yan Zheke suddenly blinked her eyes and posed a pitiful gesture. “How could you bully such a poor girl like me?”</p><p>In front of her boyfriend, she was becoming more and more relaxed.</p><p>Facing such a cute girl, Lou Cheng felt that he had no immunity at all, so he responded in a hurry, “Ok, ok, no bad things!”</p><p>“Haha,” Yan Zheke laughed soon, very proud.</p><p>They got in the car. They didn’t talk too much but the time passed quickly, the destination was already in sight.</p><p>Lou Cheng held the girl’s hand while dragging her luggage. They walked into the elevator and came back to the door of his room.</p><p>Yan Zheke opened the door, and looked around a bit. “Your place seems quite nice… ”</p><p>Lou Cheng closed the door, ignoring the luggage, and stepped quickly in front of the girl. He held her forcefully, smelled her fragrance that he was familiar with, and whispered in her ear, “Ke Ke, I missed you.”</p><p>Yan Zheke’s body reacted stiffly first, but after she heard this sentence, her body became soft. She clasped his back quietly with her arms.</p><p>They kissed each other fiercely to relief the pain from longing each other every day. The girl stepped back little by little, and somehow, they were close to the edge of the bed.</p><p>Lou Cheng lifted his head with great patience, but looking at her red cheeks and amazing eyes, he almost kissed her again.</p><p>“You, you have the match… ” Yan Zheke avoided looking him in the eyes, breathing slightly, shy and timid.</p><p>“I know… ” Lou Cheng yelled into the air, “I’m gonna wash my face with cold water!”</p><p>“Go, I will wait for you and we can do the morning exercises together.” Yan Zheke twinkled her watery eyes and laughed with her mouth closed.</p><p>Lou Cheng rushed into the bathroom, wiped his face and stayed there for a couple of minutes. When he came out, he found that Yan Zheke was lying on the bed on one side already with her even breathing.</p><p>Just a few minutes, and she had fallen asleep. It seemed that she was really very sleepy… Lou Cheng didn’t say anything. He squatted down, holding her ankle to take off her shoes while listening carefully in case of waking her up if he was not gentle enough.</p><p>He put her shoes on the floor, took off her knitted garment and then he rolled the quilt back to cover her body.</p><p>Finishing all this, he watched Yan Zheke’s beautiful and quiet face in sleep. He smiled, leaned over and pecked at her pink lips. He whispered,</p><p>“Little fairy, good morning.”</p><p>When he raised his head, the rising sun shone a few rays of light on the bed, which dyed the bed a little brighter. It made the girl look like a painting, peaceful and quiet.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Lou Cheng felt so quiet in his heart.</p><p><em>This is the meaning of being a guardian knight.</em></p><p>He closed his eyes, recalling what had happened in the past, then, naturally, he made a “close” attempt.</p><p>Blood restrained, strength withdrawn, and spiritual force embraced, when they spun to a certain extent, they interlinked together naturally.</p><p>At once, Lou Cheng perceived a sense of gratification and satisfaction gained from the infinite universe, and all the energy of the cosmos dropped into his heart.</p><p>When water flows, a channel is formed. The body can be transformed into one big dan.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
