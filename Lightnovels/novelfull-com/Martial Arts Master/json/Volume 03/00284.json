Afterwards, he came to the VIP lounge of his airport company and treated himself with a free buffet.</p><p>As the boarding time drew close, Lou Cheng did not hear any news that the airplane was late, which made him quite satisfied. It was his first fight and there was no delay. He had to brag about it to Ke. After that, he left the VIP lounge and got on the plane without waiting in line.</p><p>This was a medium-sized passenger aircraft, so seats in the first-class cabin and business cabin didn’t differ much from those in the economy-class cabin. The only difference was the space. The first two cabins had four seats in a row, with two seats on each side while the economy cabin had six seats in a row.</p><p>According to the boarding pass, Lou Cheng found his seat, put his bag in the overhead compartment and then sat beside the window, watching the blazing sun outside.</p><p>Honestly speaking, what Master Ba mentioned last night got on his nerves. It was too much for a person who had not seen the world. He was so paranoid that he could not control his thoughts. Although it was something that was not likely to happen, like an interlude in a movie or a spray in an ocean, what if he really encountered a maniac!</p><p>He had read many novels, so he knew killing had nothing to do with one’s level of martial arts. In fact, as long as there was a good arrangement, a good plan, even a powerless kid could kill a strong adult. Mighty ones in Dan stage or with physical invulnerability had their family and career. They belonged to the upper-middle class and definitely would not risk their lives for this sum of money. But what about other people?</p><p><em>I am not afraid of shooting, but poisoning would be impossible to prevent. Am I gonna spit out the food the minute I sense something wrong? What a waste of food! Moreover, bomb, car accident or any accidents could just kill me…</em> Lou Cheng was wandering in his mind. Unconsciously, seats next to him were occupied. Soon the plane started to taxi, the air traffic flow management was over and the plane took off smoothly.</p><p>According to books he read from stalls, intelligence organization of certain country excelled at killing people with an airplane crash because it was not easy to be found out… When Lou Cheng thought of this, his heart skipped a beat out of fear. He had to force himself to get rid of this idea. He took a deep breath, visualized a scene of turning water into ice and started to recall what Coach Yan had analyzed before.</p><p><em>It won’t go out of control. You guys are in the same sect. These elders and the government would not stand by and let you disciples fight between life and death. It’s the bottom line.</em></p><p><em>Thirty billion RMB for your life? It sounds strange. I put two and two together. There are only two possible situations. One is that somebody discloses such information on purpose, like beating the grass so as to scare the snake. The other is to make a mess. Nothing will happen afterward.</em></p><p><em>Don’t think too much. Act normal and follow the rules. You leave the rest to your master. Just have some faith in his experience and ability.</em></p><p><em>Coach Yan is indeed a rational girl who is good at analysis…</em> Lou Cheng felt the turbulence when his plane hit a rocky air stream. Again he looked outside and was instantly amazed by this beautiful sky view.</p><p>Below the plane was a boundless sea of cloud. The cloud looked a lot like white snow, piling up like a mountain and then changing into waves and other sorts of strange shapes. Meanwhile, the blazing sun from afar cast gleaming lights on the earth, dyeing everything to gold.</p><p>The real heavenly palace! The real fairyland!</p><p>Two and a half hours later, his plane arrived at Shanggao Airport of Wuyue Province on time. Lou Cheng let go of his final worry.</p><p>If anything happened during that flight, there wasn’t much he could do. He would be a sitting duck. However, when he stepped on the real ground, he was not 100% sure he could decide his fate rather than the god, but at least he could make the best of everything accordingly.</p><p>No wonder some mighty ones had no love for airplanes. They preferred taking trains or ships regardless of the distance. Taoist Wuguang, the head of Shangqing Sect as well as the master of that Warrior Sage Qian Donglou, acted exactly like this.</p><p>Upon landing, Lou Cheng restarted his cell and messaged Yan Zheke about his safe arrival. After that, he took his bag, got off the plane, collected four bottles of hard liquor and came to the airport pickup hall.</p><p>Looking around, he suddenly saw a sign that read like “Xing Province, Lou Cheng”. As he took a close look, Lou Cheng found it was a young lady holding the sign.</p><p>The girl was about five-foot-seven, wearing a pair of sunglasses that almost cover half of her face. She had a roman nose and pouty lips.</p><p>With her shiny black hair going straight down, she was wearing a light-color T-shirt, a white knee-high skirt and a pair of sandals, which attracted many men’s sight.</p><p>Do not underestimate that pair of legs which looked straight and fair. Judging from her qi and blood boiling inside, Lou Cheng knew she had no problems whacking some brains with her kicks.</p><p><em>Welcoming service from the sect?</em> At second thought, he walked toward the lady. She also noticed him from his constant glance. She was puzzled for a while and soon waved her right hand in excitement.</p><p>“Junior master, junior master Lou Cheng.”</p><p>“You are?” Lou Cheng came near her and asked with caution.</p><p>The lady, still wearing her glasses, answered with a big smile, “I’m your martial niece, your adorable, cute and pretty niece. I heard you were coming, so I volunteered to pick you up at the airport. Shall we go to the parking lot? Meanwhile, we can have some small talks. My name is Mo Jingting, you can call me Jingjing, Tingting or Jingting.”</p><p>“Mo Jingting?” The name sounded familiar to Lou Cheng. However, he kept calm upon hearing these playful words since he had seen his little fairy being coquettish. He took out his phone and answered with a smile, “Let me give a call to my master first.”</p><p>“OK.” Mo Jingting collected the sign and waited for him in a graceful posture. Still, she did not take off her glasses.</p><p>“Hello, master, I am here. Do I have a martial niece called Mo Jingting? She picked me up at the airport.” Lou Cheng asked.</p><p>Geezer Shi chuckled, “That girl is a hard nut to crack. Tell her to give me a ride as well. Em… Never mind, hand the cell and I will talk to her in person.”</p><p>“Fine.” Lou Cheng passed the cell to Mo Jingting.</p><p>“Uh-huh… OK… Grandmaster, rest assured. We are coming… ” Mo Jingting hung up the phone and gave it back to Lou Cheng.</p><p>Without confirmation, Lou Cheng surely would not go to the parking lot with a strange woman. During the ride, Mo Jingting acted all open and outgoing. She kept asking around as if she was about to do a thorough background check on Lou Cheng.</p><p>On the contrary, Lou Cheng was reserved. He responded with discretion.</p><p>When they got on an Audi Q7, Mo Jingting finally took off that giant pair of glasses. Her face appeared in delight and shyness.</p><p>She looked beautiful and innocent with her thick but not ugly eyebrows. Her eyes seemed to be out of focus by nature, making her glances so affectionate that people might easily develop feelings for her.</p><p>Lou Cheng checked at her again. Suddenly he understood why her name sounded so familiar.</p><p>He even listened to her song last night!</p><p>She was that star who started her profession as an actor and by far had released two albums. She only became popular in recent years. Now she was about 21 or 22 and many guys fantasized about her during their bedtime talk. Old Qiu and that animal next door all took her as their dream girl.</p><p><em>OMG! She is my martial niece!</em></p><p><em>What the fxxk! She was several years older than me. How could she still give me the puppy dog eyes?</em></p><p>Catching the look of surprise on Lou Cheng’s face, Mo Jingting expertly fastened the seatbelt and explained, “Did you recognize me, junior master? You know, my beauty and youth will be wasted if I spent all my time fighting in the ring. So, I become a martial actor, plus our sect has some connections in the entertainment circle. And in case you wonder why I am here, I take a few days off after finishing my concert the day before yesterday. When I heard the sect is about to throw a ceremony for your apprenticeship, I volunteered to help, out of curiosity. That’s all. Right, junior master, help me adjust the rearview mirror. Up a bit and turn outwards. Oops, it’s too much. Never mind, let me do it.”</p><p>She unfastened the seat belt, leaned forward to Lou Cheng and reached out to adjust the rearview mirror near the front passenger seat. Her light yet lasting perfume kept penetrating into Lou Cheng’s nostrils.</p><p>Moreover, from Lou Cheng’s angle, he could see a tempting view, a view that every man was dying to see, as long as he looked down.</p><p>Instead, he backed up a bit and looked steadily forward. Currently, what occupied in his mind was his martial niece being a superstar.</p><p><em>But my Ke is a lot more beautiful than that superstar…</em> He tried to hide his smile but his look had already given him away.</p><p>Lou Cheng did not talk until Mo Jingting finished adjusting the rearview mirror, refastened the belt and started the car again.</p><p>“Ma – martial niece, what’s the name of our sect?”</p><p>“Grandmaster did not tell you?” Mo Jingting replied in astonishment.</p><p>“Nope… ” Lou Cheng honestly answered.</p><p>Mo Jingting could not help laughing, “Junior master, did grandmaster lure you into our sect? Jesus! He was so irresponsible. How come he didn’t tell you anything?”</p><p>“Our sect is called God Ice Sect and we acknowledged Ice Queen who created the Ice Magical Kungfu thousand years ago as the founder. However, as a matter of fact, our sect started around 573 years ago thanks to Yang Chenhui from Wuyue. He got the incomplete work of Ice Magical Kungfu. Around 100 years ago, to compete the Ice Magical Kungfu, our sect founded the Wuyue Club with other sects like Haixi, Hanchi, and Dinghai. Owing to this, we became the strongest power at that time. Now there is only one movement missing in Unique Skill of the Ice Sect and we also have the incomplete work of Death Sect.”</p><p>Speaking of this, Mo Jingting turned to Lou Cheng and pursed her lips.</p><p>“Junior master, if you have heard some bad rumors recently, don’t trust. Haixi, Hanchi, and Dinghai all want to put our Ice God Sect into disorder. They’d love to see our sect caught up in endless infighting.”</p><p><em>Do those sects give out the information that somebody paid 30 million for my life? If so, what’s their purpose? To stir up the disorder in God Ice Sect?</em> Lou Cheng was lost in his thoughts. He took a minute and then started to talk again, “Were there any conflicts inside the Wuyue Club?”</p><p>As speaking, he quickly messaged Yan Zheke with a shocking emoji.</p><p>“It is Mo Jingting who picked me up at the airport, the one who sings ‘Wait for the Wind’. I can’t believe she is actually my martial niece!”</p><p>“It’s her… Cheng, you belong to the Ice God Sect… ” Yan Zheke instantly replied.</p><p>Looking ahead, Mo Jingting signed, “In Ice God Sect, there are four fighters with physical invulnerability. They lead the Wuyue Club. Three of them are aged grandmasters. In the next generation, only martial uncle Yuejian could help keep up the appearance of our sect. Outside we had to deal with the pressure from Huang Ke in Haixi Sect and ‘Clown’ in Dinghai Sect. Those guys do not want to compromise the cooperation, yet was willing to change the current situation.”</p><p>“Huang Ke from Haixi sect…” Lou Cheng whispered his name. Everyone who frequently watched top professional events must know him.</p><p>The forty-five-year-old Mighty One!</p><p>The “Spear King” in our generation!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
