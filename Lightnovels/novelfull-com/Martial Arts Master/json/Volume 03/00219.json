Such immediate victories have always been something that makes people happy.</p><p>Upon hearing Lin Que’s name fall upon his ears, Lou Cheng couldn’t help but move closer to Yan Zheke and sigh into her ears, “Being on the verge of the Dan Stage is admirable.”</p><p>Indeed, if he and his Brother-in-law switched places, and he encountered Zhuo Yan Jun’s “Black Water Swordplay”, it would be impossible to take his entire bodies strength and have it be as one, stopping on a dime and promptly slamming down to block. When you were faced with such speed and ferocity and other characteristics such as this, for the most part all you could do was try and seize any opportunity or dodge quickly. Afterwards, you’d fall directly into your opponents follow up attack. If you were even the slightest bit careless, you could end up being like a Shipwreck in a ditch.</p><p>This seemed like the original Dark Sect Ninth Pin. Creating a shadow with the Power of Blaze, twisting in a flash and simultaneously unleashing a string of attacks. If he died right then and there, he knew that at that moment, regardless of which aspect of martial arts you considered, he was not as good as his enemy.</p><p>Similarly, his Brother in law had broken up the “Double Yin-Yang Wave,” something he was at the moment unable to do. He had to learn by “doing” as physical training could only get you so far, and in the end, you were producing something intangible.</p><p>Of course, this wasn’t to say that if he were to face the Double Yin-Yang Wave he would be completely helpless. If he were able to seize it properly, he could manage to shake loose and break it.</p><p>Yan Zheke looked happy, and her lips curved into a smile after she heard Lou Cheng sigh. She lowered her voice, and jokingly said, “This is your little objective!”</p><p>Little objective? Smelling her fragrance, Lou Cheng grinned. Achieving First Pin in the first year, physical invulnerability and other things weren’t that far off. It didn’t feel like it was real, but it hadn’t been that long that he’d just entered the world of Martial Arts. Having reached the peak that he was at today, he was entitled to fumble around a bit when it came to learning about unifying his entire bodies strength as one through real experience.</p><p>They were all real, right in front of his eyes. He could practically reach out and touch them!</p><p>Thinking about how the next step for him could take him to this kind of level, it truly got him pumped up! To use an old popular saying, it was, “exciting.”</p><p>This will be my “Little Objective” for the rest of the year!</p><p>…</p><p>On the away teams side, Zhou Zhengquan pulled at his black martial arts suit, taking large, light strides towards the arena as if he was a fairy. When he ran into Zhou Yanjun, he nodded.</p><p>“Better than I’d expected.”</p><p>This was a tactful way for him praise Zhuo Yanjun. Were it not for Lin Que being on the edge of the Dan Stage, the victor wouldn’t have been so evident.</p><p>Zhuo Yanjun curbed her rising disappointment, and forced herself to say, “Get up there quickly, otherwise you’ll give him time to recuperate.”</p><p>Just then in that round, Lin Que had exerted all of his strength to end the battle quickly, so his exhaustion was quite significant.</p><p>Zhou Zhengquan smiled and nodded. His body steady, he pushed down and took a large step onto the arena, standing in opposite Lin Que.</p><p>In this moment, the crowds cheering became more spirited. Amongst them, the majority realized quite clearly that the biggest trial had arrived!</p><p>The referee lifted his spirits and threw down his right hand, not giving either side a chance to adjust,</p><p>“Begin!”</p><p>Lin Que’s tendons made a sound and charged towards Zhou Zhengquan with lightning speed as if he wanted to repeat what had happened before: using a scrambling attack to gain the upper hand. He was treating it as if it were a life or death battle and he had to “fight to kill” the powerful enemy.</p><p>The battle is to the strong!</p><p>It looked like this, but as a matter of fact, Zhou Zhengquan didn’t at all have the feeling that he was soon about to be struck.</p><p>A Dan Stage Mighty One, Absolute Reaction!</p><p>However, Zhou Zhengquan didn’t dare slack off because he suspected after Lin Que’s “Absolute Reaction” he would again utilize the “Hidden Intention” ability. In other words, he would coalesce all of his blood and Qi, strength, and other similar things and charge them all into one hidden point until he truly made a move and in a flash revealed himself. In that case, under certain circumstances, even if he had an Absolute Reaction, there not necessarily may be enough time to resist.</p><p>Zhou Zhengquan withdrew, falling back a few steps, his movements natural and unrestrained like calm running water. Lin Que pushed out and like a rainbow shooting towards the sky, threw his foot out. His body became like a comet in a grandiose display of strength and discipline.</p><p>In this moment, Zhou Zhengquan felt like he’d been born yesterday as he was unable to ward off the attack. His own stance was obviously stifled by his opponent, to the point that it caused a kind of spiritual rippling. It was easy to make errors in judgment in similar circumstances such as this.</p><p>Chuckling, he stopped on a dime, bound both of his legs together, quickly shook his waist, and balled his right hand into a fist, hammering it down with a scream.</p><p>This wasn’t just a shaking movement, but rather was a twisting move with the help of his waist. Twisting his entire body as one, it was only possible to use an attack that was weaker than “Force Concentration.”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Not only did the air crack like an explosion, but his fist clenched and crushed down like a stone, becoming like an invisible arrow flying towards Lin Que’s face.</p><p>Lin Que felt like a strong wind was assaulting his senses. He could barely open his eyes. While his physical energy was somewhat sluggish, his state of mind was steady and didn’t waver in the slightest. He blinked both eyes and, borrowing from the strength of his previous pounce, straightened his back and quickly moved to and fro. Not in the slightest way retreating allowed him to strike with a Forward Punch.</p><p>As far as following up with another combination, he’d already prepared. Once Zhou Zhengguan was hit by his hammer, he immediately went into a Yin-Yang Twist to gain power and quickly struck out with a “Meteor Force” He exploded forth as if he was in the Dan Stage, completing two consecutive strikes, as if he wanted to determine the winner of the battle with just these few strikes!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As Punch after punch rained down, Zhou Zhengquan’s Qi, blood, and spirits suddenly vanished. His arm immediately became soft and limp, making Lin Que seem as if he was hitting an empty space. It also made the terrible might and verocity of just before seem like nothingness.</p><p>His blood began to flow, his strength converged, and his lower abdomen seemed as if it was concentrating into the Dan.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Human Body Big Dan exploded, it’s vast power surging out. Due to Zhou Zhengquan’s softness and limpness, the right fist of his opponent sprang back with a resounding crack, spontaneously taking advantage of Lin Que’s “Yin-Yang Twist” power.</p><p>This power was quite enormous. When faced with it, Lin Que body began to shake and he was involuntarily tugged backward as if by an “invisible rope”, going back two steps.</p><p>Zhou Zhengquan took a large stride and advantageously arrived in front of his opponent. In his mind, he visualized a stream building up power and bursting forth, and accordance with his blood and qi once again contracted and consolidated downwards.</p><p>Double bursts!</p><p>This was the Fly Fall Punch’s “Waterfall”!</p><p>All of the strength in Lin Que’s entire body was as one. Within two steps he’d already adjusted his balance, but his opponent had caught up earlier. With his right fist held high, he rained down like a hammer blow.</p><p>Once again, there was no time to dodge or retreat. He quickly drew in a breath of air and condensed his blood, Qi, and energy into a sphere.</p><p>Lin Que’s temples pounded and his face burned red, and just then, the “sphere” exploded, like a squall carrying everything away.</p><p>Lin Que wasn’t the least bit intimidated as he compressed his muscles and twisted his arms, tilting upwards as he went into a Meteor Force.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A sound rattled out as if it was a thunderclap. Zhou Zhengquan and Lin Que’s fists seemed as if they were frozen in midair. The two mens bodies both vibrated, and their muscles shook violently.</p><p>Zhou Zhengquan didn’t even let out a groan, once again holding back his Qi and Blood. He was still forming the Dan, shaking as his power, spirit, and everything else contracted into one point.</p><p>His inner mind was a deluge of waves crashing forward, like a dammed lake building and building until it finally burst.</p><p>Bang! Zhou Zhengquan’s entire body rushed forth and there was an explosive bang like a dam bursting. Underneath his rapidly twisting waist, his left arm flowed out.</p><p>The Fly Fall Punch’s “Dam Burst”!</p><p>Three consecutive explosions of the Dan Stage!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Zhou Zhengquan’s left fist became a hammer ferociously striking out, constantly exploding out with streams of air.</p><p>From the beginning, he’d drawn from the lesson he learned from Lou Cheng in the last fight. He wouldn’t again be overcautious. He’d use all of his strength and go all out, and wouldn’t hold back at all!</p><p>This would certainly eat up a massive portion of his energy, but at least he wouldn’t be bringing the effects of the Tremor Punch entering the next round. If he was terrified of the smallest thing and kept thinking over Lou Cheng’s battle, then it was very possible that he wouldn’t merely be able to lower his own bodies energy consumption, but the energy that would be left over would be unstable, making it even more difficult!</p><p>Lin Que wasn’t truly in the Dan Stage, so it was impossible to link up consecutive strikes naturally. Under these circumstances, his entire body trembled, but his expression was steadfast and his face contained no sign of fear. His temples again pounded, his muscles became taut, and like a meteor his fist flew outwards from his waist.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Both sides collided and a boundless energy rushed forth. Lin Que again couldn’t stand steadily. With difficulty, he used the “Yin-Yang Twist” and flew backward to avoid breaking his arms or receiving any other kind of injury.</p><p>Zhou Zhengquan had previously expected this and didn’t shake at all. He caught up with him in a few steps and before his opponent could regain his balance, twisted his shoulder and threw out his right arm, stopping short of Lin Que’s throat.</p><p>At this moment, Lin Que’s feet had just touched the ground.</p><p>The might of the “Three consecutive strikes” could sweep away any and all fighters under an Eighth Pin!</p><p>The referee raised his left hand, and yelled emotionlessly,</p><p>“Round Two, Zhou Zhengquan wins!”</p><p>Lou Cheng took a deep breath and stood up from his seat.</p><p>To be honest, he hadn’t thought that Zhou Zhengquan would use the Three Consecutive Strikes in the opening round. He’d thought that both fighters would have been intertangled for some time.</p><p>However, this was also good. Even though Brother-in-law hadn’t allowed Zhou Zhengquan to have any remaining influence or shakiness, at least he didn’t have to worry about him using his killer move!</p><p>Extending his hand and grasping Yan Zheke for a moment, he stepped forward and headed towards the arena.</p><p>At first, the crowd was still, and then exploded in screams and yells,</p><p>“Lou Cheng!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
