Bam! Bam!</p><p>Lou Cheng extended both of his fists to smash, push, hammer, and slam. Each strike was heavy and carried purple flames as he executed an incessant barrage of attacks, just like the fire that burned in the open field.</p><p>When it came to close combat, whether it was Fire-like invasion or Blizzard Blast, both of them were leaders of the field. And Lou Cheng was a martial artist who specialized in this field. He momentarily suppressed Talin, making him busy just to deal with him.</p><p>However, Talin’s Undead Body had endless strength that allowed him to move as fast as the wind. Because of this, he had an edge over Lou Cheng. In addition, his body was solid and close to the level of one who practiced the martial arts, Golden Bell Clover. Ordinary attacks and burns were ineffective against him. Therefore, he used simple, rough moves to withstand his opponent. Despite being at a disadvantage, he didn’t panic and was far from losing.</p><p>If it wasn’t so extraordinary, the Undead Body wouldn’t be one of the top tier secret arts of the branch of the Witch King.</p><p>Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!</p><p>As the two of them collided, purple flames flickered down and the greyish white dimmed. Thunderous roars erupted from time to time and seemed to merge into one. At the same time, the battle felt nowhere near finishing.</p><p>As they fought, the areas where Lou Cheng and Talin collided made white shockwaves that burst around them. Strong gusts of wind kicked up the soil and even the broken branches of the trees.</p><p>Shadow Hunter, Cheng An, was an Inhuman class expert. He had initially wanted to get closer to help Lou Cheng pin down Talin and finish off this Physical Invulnerability expert who had countless strange techniques. But in the end, he couldn’t break through the wind barrier. The closer he got, the harder it was. Towards the end, he couldn’t move even an inch.</p><p>Seeing that the battle had come to a standstill with no chance of the match ending any time soon and no opportunity to escape, Talin’s heart sank. His Undead Body could only last five more minutes.</p><p>As these thoughts popped up in his mind, he gritted his teeth, shifted his arms forward and turned them into two pythons that bound to Lou Cheng’s fists tightly.</p><p>Dull green light erupted from his eyes. Below his greyish white and cracked skin, black smoke was rising. In an instant, his body shrunk substantially.</p><p>As the black smoke appeared, it took the shape of a circle that surrounded Lou Cheng. It contracted rapidly and trapped him tightly.</p><p>Witch King’s secret arts. Ghost Lock!</p><p>Facing this, Lou Cheng took a deep breath and retracted his blood flow and qi rapidly. He forcefully moved his fists.</p><p>Melding Ice and Fire together and forming them into a Dan, he shifted the stars and traced out an awe-inspiring Fighting formula.</p><p>Talin didn’t take the opportunity to attack, but instead pulled back both of his arms and made strange seals in front of him.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Lou Cheng’s body began expanding and gradually grew out of the Ghost Lock. As the Ghost Lock crumbled layer by layer, Talin’s figure turned blurry and seemed to become a greyish white shadow.</p><p>The shadow distorted and collapsed into nine parts that dashed towards different directions of the forest. Each shadow looked like a decoy, but each one had the chance of being the real body.</p><p>Secret art of escape from the branch of the Witch King, Nine Aberrations!</p><p>Lou Cheng quickly reformed his Ice Heart and extended his All-Seeing God. But to his surprise, he wasn’t able to tell which shadow was the true Talin.</p><p>Seeing that he was about to escape from the area his mind had covered, an idea occured to him. He lifted both of his hands and traced an ancient word before shouting in a serious tone,</p><p>“Dequeuing!”</p><p>Dequeuing Formula of the Nine Words Formula!</p><p>The initial use of this secret art was to combine the powers of a team to complete a team attack. Just like in a tug-o-war match, it would give every member a power-up. Their distractions and messiness would also be sorted out.</p><p>However, such a link wasn’t possible here. After executing Dequeuing Formula, the other party also had to willingly let go of their desire to resist in order for it to be effective, in order to avoid powering up the enemy.</p><p>In addition, Smith and the others were all beyond the area where his mind could sense. Therefore, they weren’t in the effective range of the Dequeuing Formula.</p><p>Lou Cheng used it now as a beacon of light more than anything.</p><p>The real Talin would resist. As for the illusory shadows, they couldn’t react to it unless they had intelligence.</p><p>This meant it would become clear who was real and who was fake.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, Lou Cheng hadn’t taken the conventional route, but instead managed to find a way to counter Nine Aberrations.</p><p>A mysterious vibe spread rapidly as his mind seemed to have become like a radar.</p><p>After a quick moment, the reaction happened. Lou Cheng aimed at the greyish white shadow to his right and threw out his punch.</p><p>Zzz zzz zzz! Behind his back and below his legs, waves and waves of light blue flames shot out to propel him through the layers of air barriers. He appeared suddenly behind the figure and smashed towards the back of his opponent’s head.</p><p>Talin’s eyes contracted and the dim green light turned into small dots.</p><p>He had not expected Nine Aberrations to be able to fool Lou Cheng for long. However, he didn’t think he would figure it out so quickly. This was a confidence he had garnered through hundreds of battles.</p><p>If he had been able to enter a safe zone, he would have had all kinds of methods to escape from his tracking.</p><p>In the end, Lou Cheng didn’t seem to have been delayed at all and was able to see through the facade in a blink of an eye.</p><p>This was a shock to Talin and made him feel desperate.</p><p>As these thoughts passed through his mind, a cruel look flashed in Talin’s eyes. He flipped forward to avoid the metal punch aimed at the back of this head. Following the momentum, he raised his right arm trying to regain his balance.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Lou Cheng ignited Emperor Yan force and lowered his shoulders suddenly. He forcefully changed the direction of his fist and changed his punch to a hammer strike.</p><p>At this moment, Talin’s lifted left arm exploded suddenly. Flesh and blood scattered around him and onto Lou Cheng.</p><p>Zzz zzz zzz! Amidst the horrifying sounds of collision, the skin under the navy blue martial arts suit began rotting. Bumps of pus began rising on Lou Cheng’s arms, shoulders, chest, and face. Talin’s flesh seemed to have insects inside it. Small objects wriggled as they attempted to dig into his skin.</p><p>Witch King’s self-damaging secret art, Bloody Flesh Spiritual Venom!</p><p>The intense pain caused Lou Cheng’s hammer strike to lose all its strength and his body stopped. Using the opportunity, Talin accelerated once again as he dove towards the forest at the edge of the open field.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s Ice Heart was shaking but hadn’t collapsed. He endured the intense pain and executed Lord Emperor’s Purple Flame.</p><p>Purple flames spilled out of Lou Cheng and flowed like liquid on the surface of his body. Talin’s flesh was ignited. The insects turned black before they started to burn.</p><p>There wasn’t an insect that wasn’t afraid of the flames. If there was, all Lou Cheng had to do was to increase the temperature once again.</p><p>Pa pa pa! Amidst the purple flames, the small grains were either turned to ash or fell off the body after being burnt charcoal-black. As for Lou Cheng’s skin, muscles, and hair, there were just small contractions and the smell of barbeque meat.</p><p>This was the ability to control fire by a Physical Invulnerability expert from the Fire Sect!</p><p>As the purple flames around him started to flicker, Lou Cheng endured the pain and lifted both of his arms. Locking down on Talin, who was moving right and left, back and forth, Lou Cheng started making hand seals.</p><p>An ancient word was traced and Lou Cheng shouted,</p><p>“Confrontation!”</p><p>The hatred and desire to escape in Talin’s mind weakened substantially as he turned lazy and sleep-like, recuperating from the injury.</p><p>Not good! He bit the edge of his tongue to increase his attentiveness.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s mind was visualizing different ancient words. After using the simplified Attainment Formula, he took two strides and came to the side of Talin. Shaking his arm, he smashed his fist across.</p><p>Talin broke free from his lethargy. He immediately lowered his left shoulder, which had lost its arm, to block Lou Cheng’s right fist.</p><p>Although he rushed, he didn’t panic. He remembered to spread the grayish white gas below the surface of his skin to prevent himself from being frozen and stiffened. As for explosions and burns, he would rely on the resiliency of his body.</p><p>As the two of them came into contact, Lou Cheng suddenly turned his fist into a palm. Exerting strength and pushing, he straightened his back and leapt above his enemy. With his head facing down, he threw his left punch towards the baihui pressure point.</p><p>Talin’s Undead Body had outstanding strength and extreme speed. However when it came to close combat techniques, he wasn’t a match for Lou Cheng. Seeing the approaching punch, he could only duck his head and lift his right fist in a hurry.</p><p>But Lou Cheng’s left hand opened up once again. He pressed lightly on Talin’s fist and injected Ice Spirit Force. After which, he pushed off and jumped behind his opponent. In mid-air, he tensed his right leg and whipped it like it was attached to an iron spring.</p><p>Talin felt a chill in his body and slowed down. By the time he thought of pouncing forward or leaning to the side, it was already too late. All he could do was to protect his vitals as he was hit by Lou Cheng’s kick on the shoulder.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>His shoulder collapsed and his flesh became blurry. Although his arm was still intact, he couldn’t exert his strength anymore.</p><p>Feeling a chill down his spine, Talin turned his body around as though he had no bones. He looked at Lou Cheng and the flames in his eyes began burning strongly. Creepy and horrifying vibes arose.</p><p>Lou Cheng, who had just landed and tilted his body, suddenly felt his surroundings turning dark. The deep holes caused by his cannon shot, the thick forest, Smith, and the others disappeared.</p><p>The darkness was quickly tainted dim green and blood-red. The figure of Talin appeared, now over a hundred meters tall. Skulls and arms were growing out of his body and countless, unblinking eyes looked down together.</p><p>The strong sense of fear was real as they turned into a sea of insects that covered the skies. They flooded down as the monster Talin pressed his huge palm downwards.</p><p>Secret mental technique of the branch of the Witch King, Savage Tribute!</p><p>Lou Cheng’s body turned transparent as though he was made of ice. Under the attacks, cracks appeared on his body.</p><p>Despite having Enemy Heart Freezing Move, he still wasn’t able to completely neutralize the invasion of his enemy.</p><p>At the critical moment, Lou Cheng suddenly disappeared from the eyes of the monster Talin.</p><p>Besides the dim green and blood-red light, darkness was gathering at the edge with countless bright stars. The hundred-meter-tall giant and countless insects became insignificant, and the horrifying atmosphere was substantially weakened.</p><p>Talin was about to react when the stars moved at high speed and formed nine mystical, ancient words.</p><p>Confrontation! Army! Fighting! Swordsman! Wholeness! Formation! Dequeuing! Forwarding! Attainment!</p><p>In an instant, nine ancient words glowed brightly and pierced the mental territory. They ripped the dim green and blood-red atmosphere and eradicated the insects and giant.</p><p>Talin leaned back instinctively as the edge of his nose started bleeding greyish white liquids.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Smith and the rest grabbed the opportunity and fired rocket launchers, forcing Talin to escape frantically.</p><p>With both of his arms gone or handicapped, his moves failing, and now surrounded by strong enemies, he felt desolate.</p><p>A cruel light flashed in his eyes once again. Talin looked at Lou Cheng and shouted loudly,</p><p>“Let’s die together!”</p><p>His greyish white body ignited as he turned his flesh and mind into the most lethal curse. Silently, the curse swept towards Lou Cheng, making it hard for him to know where to hide.</p><p>Secret art to perish together with the enemy from the branch of Witch King, Life Curse!</p><p>He wanted to use a curse ignited by his own life to break through the supernatural defense of his enemy.</p><p>The alarm in Lou Cheng’s mind sounded loudly. Without thinking, he retracted his breathing and blood flow, balanced the Ice and Fire, and formed a miniature Jindan.</p><p>After the real Jindan broke and integrated into his body, his ability to rebound curses was strengthened. However, he was still far from a Longhu Immortal who specialized in this. Therefore, the ability wasn’t as strong as when the Jindan was around.</p><p>However, this Longhu Immortal ability didn’t come out of the blue. It was based on his Jindan technique, Nine Words Formula, and his secret arts.</p><p>Sadly, for those Physical Invulnerability experts who specialized in curses, Lou Cheng had now obtained all the fundamentals of Longhu Immortal, meaning he could increase his ability to rebound curses while in battle.</p><p>The stars moved and the Nine Words were traced out once again. They formed a complicated ancient seal and emitted strange energy in all directions.</p><p>The bloody light vanished and the flames on Talin’s body were extinguished. His body melted like a candle.</p><p>Vitality vanished from Talin’s eyes as he mumbled,</p><p>“Why was everything countered by you…”</p><p>His voice faded to silence as he turned into a puddle of flesh and blood.</p><p>Smith, Dwyane, Cheng An, and Jian Dan looked on from afar. They had forgotten to put down their weapons.</p><p>A Physical Invulnerability expert had passed away right in front of their eyes!</p><p>And his opponent was just one person.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
