He was the final, magical boss from his teenage dreams.</p><p>His white clothes were gray with dust, and remnants of the destruction could be seen in the burn holes and blood stains. Perspiration was dripping down Qian Donglou’s forehead at a speed visible to Lou Cheng’s naked eyes. His right arm sagged powerlessly while he could barely lift his left, which still trembled. Purple sparks flickered in his black hair, which was messed up as if it had been chewed on by dogs.</p><p>This was what Lou Cheng saw of the Warrior Sage, Qian Donglou, at this moment. His perspective was different from those of the battle videos or interviews. He was looking from the perspective of a victor.</p><p>He is also a human who can suffer injuries and look like hell. There are times when he’s not quick enough.</p><p>A surge of indescribable emotions welled up in Lou Cheng as he experienced a transformation.</p><p>When he had first entered the circle of Physical Invulnerability experts and begun to learn the world of title matches and the professional league, he harbored a mentality of respect and yearning. His mindset was of someone on a pilgrimage, which originated from his dreams and years of building up.</p><p>But now, with Qian Donglou having lost to him, that feeling dissipated suddenly. His dream sank and those exalted names lost their halos. What Lou Cheng saw now was what those names truly represented.</p><p>They were made friends through martial arts and made enemies from fighting against each other to clinch the titles. They were truly living people and opponents that could be defeated!</p><p>Pfft. Is this what it’s like to have a little of the strong expert’s mentality? Lou Cheng silently deprecated himself as he retracted both of his hands.</p><p>When he saw Qian Donglou turned around, he clasped his right fist in his left palm, bowed and said,</p><p>“Thank you for your guidance.”</p><p>With these words, he was flooded with indescribable happiness. He wanted to share it with his wife, his seniors, his friends, and his family.</p><p>Hehe. I finally can say these words to the Warrior Sage!</p><p>This feeling was amazing, and Lou Cheng was already looking forward to the next time. He was filled with visions of him facing off against a complete Warrior Sage in the future, which motivated him even more to face his next opponent.</p><p>No matter who he is, I will challenge him as an enemy. If I lose, I will not be demoralized, and if I win, I will cheer wildly for the victory!</p><p>Qian Donglou glanced at him and greeted him with a single hand and a slight smile. After which, he walked back to the seats of the Shangqing Sect, still a little wobbly.</p><p>This reaction was even more exhilarating than a compliment. Not bad… As Lou Cheng thought about it, he tried to use every precious moment to regulate his breathing and blood flow to reduce the numbness and inability to control his body, as he prepared to face off against the second expert from Shangqing Sect.</p><p>Hmm. Who will it be? And what’s their specialty?</p><p>As he wondered, Lou Cheng suddenly realized he didn’t know anything about the second Physical Invulnerability expert from the Shangqing Sect.</p><p>Who is it…Why haven’t I paid any attention to it…</p><p>In the Longhu Club seating area, Chen Qitao didn’t move from his upright sitting position. However, the gloominess on his face had faded substantially. Ning Zitong also heaved a sigh of relief and felt more confident about the future.</p><p>After battling the Warrior Sage, Lou Cheng’s mentality should have undergone quite a change. The strategy of exhaustion is no longer just wishful thinking…</p><p>“Not too shabby…” Coach Lu Yan mumbled softly.</p><p>On the Shangqing Sect side, it was nothing out of the ordinary that Peng Leyun had been lost in his head throughout the match. He put himself in the shoes of Lou Cheng and watched attentively until the match ended, before sinking deep in thought and pondering what he would do, how he would react to him, and how he could have done better than Lou Cheng. He failed to notice when someone beside him stood up.</p><p>…</p><p>“Lou Cheng wins the second match!”</p><p>In Brutale, dawn had just broken. Yan Zheke raised her arms abruptly and opened her mouth as if to shout. But when the voice reached her throat, she woke from her joy and placed both of his hands over her mouth, so that her stifled shrieks were barely audible.</p><p>She was in the hotel for the Financial Summit Forum and the female classmate beside her was still deep in sleep.</p><p>I almost lost my composure… Yan Zheke glanced at Jennifer before sticking out her tongue, as if she had been caught in the act.</p><p>She went back to the screen and quickly took a screenshot before it changed. After which, she read through it several times in detail before making a copy and giddily emailing it to herself.</p><p>Taking out her laptop, she logged into her account, opened the storage drive, and located a folder named “Foolish People Have Good Luck.” She copied and pasted the received screenshot into the folder and downloaded the videos that were made available.</p><p>After transferring the videos, she saw older titles such as “Husky’s First Physical Invulnerability Match” and “Silly Cheng Finally Defeats Peng Leyun” among others.</p><p>After keeping silent for a while, she excitedly gave a new name to the new videos and screenshots. One of them was “First Battle with Warrior Sage,” and another “Cheng is the Best!”</p><p>Covering her mouth and lifting her head, she looked out the window. Suddenly, she let out an “Oh!”</p><p>I almost forgot that this isn’t a title match. Cheng still has another battle!</p><p>Yan Zheke solemnly took out her tablet.</p><p>Uhm…Who is his opponent?</p><p>…</p><p>“The second match, Lou Cheng wins!”</p><p>Cai Zongming had forgotten his joy in complaining about the commentators. He was looking at the image where Lou Cheng held his palms to Qian Donglou’s temples. It was as though he wanted to dissect the image down to pixels to look for signs of photoshop, or blaze the image into his memory.</p><p>When Lou Cheng made the great leap to become a Physical Invulnerability expert, he had similar feelings, though they had diminished by now. Is this expert, with his hands against the Warrior Sage’s temples, truly the same friend who had dressed badly, lacked confidence, and feared taking any risks in the past?</p><p>If anyone else knew, they would have a great time making fun of him!</p><p>He had watched him transform slowly and achieve his success gradually. However, when Lou Cheng reached the stage, a place he’d never dreamed he’d stand, wasn’t it natural to feel like everything was unreal?</p><p>Cai Zongming took a breath to calm himself before posting a comment saying,</p><p>“My brother!”</p><p>When his message was sent, it immediately drew intense replies. His screen exploded in notifications.</p><p>“My best friend!”</p><p>“My older brother!”</p><p>“My husband!”</p><p>“The father of my child!”</p><p>“My father!”</p><p>“Grandfather!”</p><p>Damn, who are these people…They’re more shameless than me! Cai Zongming burst into laughter.</p><p>…</p><p>“Lou Cheng wins the second match!”</p><p>When she heard the sentence, Eternal Nightfall, Yan Xialing, immediately jumped up and took a screenshot before uploading it to the forum.</p><p>“Haha, his first successful challenge against the Warrior Sage!”</p><p>“What’s so special…I mean, fighting in the professional league, it was just a matter of time before something like this happened.” The Unparalleled Dragon King forum faked nonchalance regarding Yan Xiaoling’s excitement.</p><p>She didn’t mind at all and laughed, “The beginning of everything is always harder. With this success, there will be another one that follows. He fought Warrior Sage at thirty percent of his strength. Next time, it will be fifty, then seventy, then ninety, then a perfect form, raging Warrior Sage. Just thinking about it is exciting!”</p><p>“Do you think this is a game? How do you even come up with this?” replied a shocked Brahman.</p><p>“I’m just applying what I’ve learned! Thinking about what that means…I’m going to cry now,” said Yan Xiaoling.</p><p>Nie Qiqi and the others breathed sighs of relief and commented, “She’s still the silly Ling. Still that emotionally challenged girl…”</p><p>“Alright, let’s stop talking. The third match is starting soon!” the Unparalleled Dragon King reminded.</p><p>“Damn, I almost forgot,” Yan Xiaoling cursed.</p><p>“Who is his opponent?” Brahman was completely lost.</p><p>“Probably…..” Unparalleled Dragon King glanced at the participant list before announcing “Taoist Lightless!”</p><p>Why do I feel like that name is spelt incorrectly?</p><p>…</p><p>Lou Cheng saw his next opponent. He had silverish white and black hair in roughly equal proportions, looked amiable and peaceful, wasn’t tall or short, wasn’t fat or skinny—overall, he looked like an average man, with no unique characteristics to make him stand out.</p><p>Wu… Wu… Taoist Wuguang… Lou Cheng finally recalled the name from the depths of his memories.</p><p>The sect leader of Shangqing Sect and a title expert who no one can even remember!</p><p>Before coming to Sky Thunder Mountain, I watched many matches of him. I also concluded several useful things about him and made targeted preparation. How did I almost forget about him?</p><p>What did I find out about him previously? Why do I feel like he’s pretty ordinary with no specialty…</p><p>As Lou Cheng raked his brain to try to recall, Taoist Wuguang had already placed his shimmering longsword in front of him. There was a distance of thirty meters between them and several high-voltage electric posts that had fallen. Strands of broken cables intersected on the floor and formed a contrast against the remaining cables still hanging in the air.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
