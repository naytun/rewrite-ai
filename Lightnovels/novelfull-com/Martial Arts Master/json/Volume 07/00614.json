Upon hearing the mummy’s definitive words, Constantine was clearly shocked for a moment. This was because he did not notice any expert approaching.</p><p>In this aspect, he was confident that he was several notches stronger than the mummy. How could he possibly speak out first before he even noticed it!</p><p>Could it be that the reinforcement was so strong that he was able to escape my senses? And that he had used a special method to inform the mummy?</p><p>Seeing the doubts in Constantine’s eyes, the mummy opened his mouth, pulling the bandages near his mouth in the process, and said, “Listen carefully again.”</p><p>“Listen?” Constantine closed his eyes, tilted his head slightly and listened attentively to the changes to the surrounding. However, he still couldn’t detect any signs of a “Terror Grade” expert.</p><p>On the other end, the roar of the engine could be heard from far. There were also the sounds of tanks’ tracks rotating and uniform and orderly footsteps.</p><p>“An army?” Constantine opened both of his eyes.</p><p>“Nile’s 35th fully-motorised division.” The mummy gave a definite answer. “They are one of the five ace armies that are the most loyal to the Pharaoh. By now, they should have set up a wartime airport in the wild. Their commander, Lieutenant General Amon, is also a “Demigod”, the equivalent of your “Terror Grade”.”</p><p>Constantine drank a mouth of red wine and asked with doubts, “Isn’t this a secret mission? Why are we getting the army involved? Are you trying to stop me from getting back to America?”</p><p>“Sathah stays in the military base and so are the leaders of the Brotherhood. They have many troops, various types of high-tech equipment and powerful weapons. If we encounter them in the wild and aren’t trapped in a certain area, there’s nothing we would need to be worried about. However, if we wish to sneak into the base or even attack them directly, with just the two of us, we would just be dying in vain. Even with Amon, the outcome will not change at all. To deal with a military fortress, the best way is still to use a fully equipped regular army and using fighter planes for airstrikes.,” the mummy explained.</p><p>After finishing his lines, he added, “Sathah has noticed the Pharaoh’s intention and will definitely take counteractions. We can’t let this drag on any further. After all, as long as we can tidy up this place, there will only be one place left. When the situation stabilized and the Pharaoh returns, it doesn’t matter how the international community would find this. In the worst case, we just have to get some scapegoats.</p><p>“Alright!” Constantine turned around and walked to the window. Through the thin curtains, he looked down to the streets. He saw armoured vehicles, main fighting tanks and artillery launching cars moving through at a steady speed towards the military base that was some distance away. The war was going to start any second!</p><p>Within the building, the footsteps of one wearing leather boots resonated. It was as though they were announcing the arrival of an expert.</p><p>Knock knock knock!</p><p>In less than a minute, someone was knocking the door. The pace was slow and extremely polite.</p><p>“General Amon, please come in.,” The mummy said politely.</p><p>Following the creaking sounds, the door was pushed open, revealing a man in a brown and green general uniform. He had hair that touched his ears, blue eyes that looked like gems that formed from the ocean and deep facial features. He could definitely be considered as a suave and charismatic man with Nile’s style.</p><p>“Sathah has made use of his personal channels to inform various countries and accused Pharaoh of creating the mutiny and slaughtering his own people. He had requested for the international community to send an observation team to investigate. Moreover, he claimed that he has complete and definitive evidence.” Lieutenant General Amon took a look at Constantine before continuing in a low voice, “We don’t have much time left!”</p><p>As he spoke, several formations of bombers, under the cover of fighter planes, whizzed past the window towards the military base.</p><p>…</p><p>Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!</p><p>Lou Cheng, who was hiding in the east part of the building, could hear explosion after explosion and felt the earth shaking lightly.</p><p>He was rather surprised and left his hiding spot. He climbed to the top floor of a tall building and looked towards the direction where the sounds of explosions came from. From his location, he saw flames raging from time to time at the location of a military base. Towards the end of it, they no longer stopped. As for the skies, airplanes were roaring passed at low height.</p><p>“The rebels and the regular army were exchanging fire again? It looks pretty intense…” Lou Cheng didn’t have the support from the intelligence unit and could only make a rough conjecture based on the signs shown.</p><p>However, there was one thing he could be sure of and that was that the mummy from before shouldn’t have the time to look for reinforcements and pursue him at Fartouat. In other words, Siris and his families were completely safe!</p><p>“Should I take this chance to find a physical invulnerability expert to spar with, or should I leave Khukhang and find another opportunity in Deeka? It’s easy to get injured or be disturbed in a battleground with fighter jets flying over…” Lou Cheng mumbled to himself while being in deep thought and was a little hesitant.</p><p>Just as he pushed off with his hand and landed on the ground from the external side of the tall building, he suddenly noticed a trail of sand dust approaching quickly from the desert that was east of Khukhang.</p><p>“Another physical invulnerability expert? It seems like she’s not completely there yet and was at a similar state as I…” Lou Cheng acutely judged. Silently, he moved through complete darkness and arrived at the position that figure was expected to enter into Khukhang.</p><p>A strong gust of wind exploded as the figure approached quickly from afar. Lou Cheng squinted his eyes and was shocked. The incoming person was actually Ren Li! “Sunny Star” Ren Li!</p><p>Why is she here for?</p><p>Lou Cheng quickly released his technique that hid his presence. He strode out of the corner and revealed himself.</p><p>Ren Li slowed herself, frowned and asked before Lou Cheng could speak, “Why are you here?”</p><p>She was wearing a light green martial arts suit and carried a bronze-yellowish sword scabbard. Her hair was tied up in a ponytail, making her exquisite face looked like a Barbie doll. Despite running through the desert, there wasn’t any trace of dust on her face. Her pair of big and bright eyes were full of vitality, just like her nickname, “Sunny Star”</p><p>Lou Cheng thought about it for a few seconds before seriously asking in an indirect manner, “Where do you think you are?”</p><p>“Isn’t this place Deeka?” Ren Li seemed to be experienced in such situations and instantly returned a question.</p><p>I knew it… Lou Cheng almost covered his face and sighed. He turned to Ren Li and answered honestly, “This is Khukhang.”</p><p>“Khukhang… Which country is Khukhang in?” asked Ren Li while feeling a little guilty.</p><p>“It’s also part of Nile but it’s three hundred kilometres south of Deeka.,” explained Lou Cheng patiently. Nonetheless, he couldn’t help but curse silently.</p><p>How strong a heart and how obtuse are the seniors of Kongtong School to agree to letting such a clueless person head to the war-torn zones for training!</p><p>Aren’t they afraid that she will just make her way to the headquarters of a strong enemy?</p><p>Ren Li had a sudden realization and said confidently and righteously, “They didn’t remind me!”</p><p>“They?” Lou Cheng looked around as he replied.</p><p>Ren Li felt a little embarrassed and explain, “I have a global positioning device on me and a satellite phone. If I head in the wrong direction, they would call and correct me.”</p><p>“It isn’t that bad. Look! You just have to make a turn, keep going straight and you will be at Deeka.,” said Lou Cheng perfunctorily.</p><p>Theoretically speaking, these words would apply to any other place.</p><p>“So that’s how it is… So I wasn’t lost…” Ren Li mumbled to herself as she slowly regained her joy and confidence.</p><p>She scrutinized Lou Cheng for a while before replying with a faint smile, “I heard from Priest that you happened to make the breakthrough too. That’s great, me too! Because of this, I got delayed a day and took an unnecessary route for a day. In the end, I couldn’t meet up with Priest at Fartouat and could only agree to meet in Deeka.”</p><p>Based on the way you travel, you might not even be able to meet him at Deeka too… Lou Cheng was about to speak again when an explosion erupted from the faraway military base again. Wave after wave of explosion came, seemingly forming a wall. Instantly, they accumulated into violent tremors, making it felt like the whole city was shaking.</p><p>Did the ammunition depot get bombed? As Lou Cheng was still making conjectures, Ren Li’s eyes brightened up and asked, “There’s a war going on over there?”</p><p>It seems pretty intense!</p><p>“Yeah.” Lou Cheng didn’t try to mask the fact.</p><p>“Let’s go take a look and learn from it!” suggested Ren Li excitedly. “If we encounter a physical invulnerability expert that lagged behind, I’ll let you give him a shot first!”</p><p>She makes it sounds like a present to a kid… Lou Cheng had the same thoughts initially and did not hesitate any further. He made his decision decisively and said, “Alright! But you definitely cannot be rash… Yeah, don’t be rash!”</p><p>He kept the words “cause trouble” back.</p><p>“Relax, I have tons of experience!” replied Ren Li sincerely.</p><p>I’m a martial artist that has been through lots of trials in the war-torn zones!</p><p>Lou Cheng kept his thoughts to himself and rushed towards the location of the military base in front of the highly confident Ren Li.</p><p>They both controlled their speed as they diverted some attention to guard against the surrounding and hid their movements. It was as though they had blended into the darkness, moving within it like ghosts.</p><p>As they approached the battlefield, they found a tall building in the vicinity. From the outside of the building, where the windows had all shattered, they arrived at the balcony by jumping and leaping in less than twenty seconds. From the balcony, they looked towards the military base.</p><p>There was fire everywhere and thick smoke filled the air. Sounds of explosions and gunshots were incessant, making everything seem like scenes from a big film. This caused Lou Cheng to be a little lost.</p><p>At this moment, Lou Cheng noticed from his peripheral vision that there were also flames rising and sounds of explosion erupting from a place not too far away. The surface of the buildings in that direction had been turned to dust. Strong winds were blowing intensely and fire sparks and black fog would appear from time to time in mid-air.</p><p>“A battle between physical invulnerability experts!” said Ren Li. She had also noticed the situation there and her eyes were shining terrifyingly bright.</p><p>Without needing her to suggest, Lou Cheng said directly, “Let’s go and take a look. But be careful and don’t let them notice us.”</p><p>“Alright!” Ren Li carried her sword, took a step forward and rushed to the edge of the balcony. Leaping into the air, she jumped towards a relatively lower building several tens of meters away.</p><p>She was just like a gust of wind and was extremely fast. As she descended, she landed safely and stood firmly.</p><p>Lou Cheng knew that he did not have such an ability. After all, everyone had things they specialized in. Therefore, as he ran, he retracted his breathing and blood flow. Exerting strength from his Dan and pushing off with both of his legs, he successfully jumped to the side of Ren Li as the edge of the balcony he jumped off from collapsed.</p><p>Through their respective methods, the two of them cruised through the city and quickly approached the battlefield of the physical invulnerability experts. They stopped at a tall building and looked down from the high ground.</p><p>At this moment, Lou Cheng used a technique that Cultivators used to hide their presence and mind. Suddenly, his existence became faintly discernible. Ren Li also used the unique technique of Kongtong School. Incessant strong winds started blowing around her, covering all her motions.</p><p>Looking afar, Lou Cheng saw someone familiar. It was that mummy expert that had pursued Siris and his family!</p><p>…</p><p>Sathah had not expected Pharoah to be so ruthless and directly mobilize his ace army to attack his base. As the situation got chaotic and he was on the verge of losing, he led a group of leaders of the Brotherhood and attempted to escape quietly from the fortress.</p><p>However, he had underestimated Constantine’s extremely strong senses in the dark and the mummy’s ability to detect. He was quickly discovered and suffered an ambush, resulting in two of the leaders being killed in an instant.</p><p>And now, Sathah was facing off against Constantine and Lieutenant General Amon at the same time. He was in a tight spot but still constantly sought an opportunity to escape.</p><p>He knew that once the mummy had finished off the other two leaders, he wouldn’t be able to escape even if he wished to!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
