He saw Peng Leyun, Ren Li and Ann Chaoyang discussing the headline.</p><p>He moved his thumb to review the conversation records. “Hipster” was the one who shared the link to the news. After several minutes, Ren Li appeared and asked curiously, “Why am I the west?”</p><p>“That’s because Kongtong Mountain is in the west [-..-]. ” Ann Chaoyang used two full stops that looked like nostrils to express his emotions.</p><p>“Is it? [A face of doubts expression]” replied Ren Li.</p><p>Peng Leyun appeared and replied, “[Detective Conan’s twitching smile expression] Didn’t you take geography in high school?”</p><p>Ren Li answered righteously, “The geography textbook didn’t say anything about Kongtong Mountain being in the west!”</p><p>“Is it?” Peng Leyun tagger Ann Chaoyang to the question.</p><p>Ann Chaoyang responded, “[Sweating profusely expression] I graduated from High School five years ago. How would I remember?”</p><p>Reading up to this point, Lou Cheng couldn’t help but send an [LOL expression] to the group chat.</p><p>Peng Leyun seemed to be unwilling to give up as he posted the question again, “Lou Cheng, do you have any impression?”</p><p>“I chose the science track when I was in High School [Laughing sheepishly expression]” replied Lou Cheng. “As for geography tests, our school was very lax about it. As long as you don’t take out the textbook and flip it in front of the invigilating teacher, they don’t really care what you do… Even so, I scored lower than an eighty…”</p><p>“It couldn’t be? If I can flip the books in an exam, my score would definitely be above a ninety.” In that instant, Peng Leyun started to doubt Lou Cheng’s intelligence.</p><p>At that time, he was in a daze for over half an hour. Yet, he still scored well in the geography test.</p><p>Lou Cheng replied, “[Covering face in embarrassment expression] I had only discovered my two naughty cousins had torn away a portion of my geography textbook after entering the examination hall. Luckily, I knew all of the people around me…”</p><p>“So you have always been silly. [Pondering expression]” Ann Chaoyang sighed.</p><p>Indeed! There’s only an inept given name but never an inept nickname…</p><p>Recalling all those embarrassing things in the Four-nation competition, Lou Cheng quickly changed the topic. “Priest and Ren Li, when will you all be arriving at Jiu Qu City?”</p><p>“I’m already there…” Peng Leyun answered after a ten second pause.</p><p>After several seconds, Ren Li shared another link with an [Angry face expression].</p><p>“Quick, go and condemn him!”</p><p>Lou Cheng clicked the link. It was a news article and had similar headlines as the previous one. As for the content, there were additional analysis and prediction.</p><p>“‘Wisdom King’, Zhi Hai, has been a physical invulnerability for four years. He got a title and we can put him aside for discussion first. Peng Leyun, Ren Li and Lou Cheng have just made the great leap less than 3 months ago. They have barely mastered the new techniques.”</p><p>“Indeed, at the same level, they are indeed much stronger than other martial artists of the same pin level. If everyone has made the great leap, the strength they can demonstrate will undoubtedly be the top. This is because of their deeper and more solid foundation together with their more outstanding talents.”</p><p>“In other words, as long as they have consolidated themselves at this stage and mastered their techniques, they would be the leaders among the third pins. They will not be weaker than those older physical invulnerability experts that have been stuck in this stage for a long time.”</p><p>“Naturally, every single physical invulnerability expert that has made the great leap is clearly above ordinary people. However, there are stronger people among the strong. Besides that and honestly speaking, there are some of them who become contented after the great change and lose the hunger for glory and martial arts. Although they still insist on practicing, their improvements are clearly slower. The reasons aren’t due to the external environment but because of their own attitude and mindset.</p><p>“Disregarding this, let’s go back to the main topic. Based on the initial analysis, we have taken a reference to ‘Wisdom King’ to determine the strength of the three Heavenly sons of the era, Peng, Lou and Ren at this stage. If the Master competition is only opened to third-pin experts, they have the chances to make it to the end. It’s a shame that this is just a big “what-if”. Although the competition couldn’t be compared to the “Battle of the Kings” and “Warrior Sage” competitions, where many retired seniors will also participate, all those experts in their prime years will almost all participate in the Master competition, excluding those who are still recuperating from their injuries.”</p><p>“They have a certain chance of winning against a second-pin and a slim chance of winning against an first-pin. However, this is it. Therefore, a lot of those headlines today are just trying to sensationalize things with ill intent. They were making their arguments without a basis. What they are hoping for might happen in three to five years time but it definitely will not be now.”</p><p>“For this competition, Lou Cheng, Ren Li and Peng Leyun will reach round thirty-two under the most optimistic assumptions. Moreover, this would be highly reliant on being lucky in the draws.”</p><p>There’s nothing wrong with it… After reading it, Lou Cheng felt that the analysis was rather objective. Therefore, he asked curiously, “What is there to condemn him for?”</p><p>Ren Li paused for a moment and replied after some time, “I’ve sent the wrong link… It should be this…”</p><p>She shared another piece of news. The content was closer to making a wager. They were guessing which Heavenly son of the era, excluding Zhi Hai, would be eliminated in the elimination rounds held on the first two days.</p><p>There were 86 physical invulnerability experts that signed up for the “Master” competition. Together with 16 inhumans that made it past the preliminaries, there were a total of 102 contestants. The initial round adopted a “Double Elimination” format where you would be eliminated if you lost twice. This would carry on until the final 32 contestants were determined. After which, it would be based on a “sudden-death” format where contestants were eliminated once they lost once. The final participant standing would earn the qualification to challenge the previous “Master” title holder.</p><p>This “wager thread” was under the assumption that Lou Cheng, Ren Li and Peng Leyun, who had just made the great leapt, would be lacking in mastery and practical fighting experiences against people at this stage. It was betting that they would be eliminated from the Master competition without winning a single match.</p><p>“Pfft. Why do we have to quarrel with these attention-grabbing people? Winning the competition will be the best counter to their attacks.” Lou Cheng who had experienced all kinds of critiques advised nonchalantly.</p><p>“Yeah. [Nodding head constantly expression]” replied Ren Li. “‘Attention-grabbing’ is an apt word to use. Let me go and reply to them!”</p><p>…Do you really understand what I’m trying to say here… Lou Cheng was left speechless and could only reply with a “shocked” expression.</p><p>It was Ann Chaoyang who maintained a clear head and asked calmly, “Didn’t you say that you didn’t register for an account so you wouldn’t quarrel with others?”</p><p>“My niece lent her phone to me!” Ren Li answered honestly.</p><p>Seeing that she was eager to do it, Lou Cheng changed the topic again, “Ren Li, I’ll be arriving at Jiu Qu City tomorrow. What about you? Shall we have a gathering before the competition.”</p><p>Peng Leyun was the first to reply with a faint smile, “Let’s meet up after the competition. Whoever has a better ranking and whoever can last longer will give the others a treat. What do you all think about it?”</p><p>“Sure!””Alright!” Lou Cheng and Ren Li almost replied in unison.</p><p>Their battle wills were aroused and became more intense through this small wager.</p><p>Ann Chaoyang smiled bitterly and added, “I’m not even qualified to treat you guys…”</p><p>He was able to maintain a good mindset about it. This was because he had just turned 24 and already had the strength of a fourth-pin. He had ample time and great hopes of making the great leap. As to how long would he need, nobody would be able to know definitively.</p><p>I’ll definitely pay for this bill! Lou Cheng teased himself after leaving the chat group. He shared this incident with Yan Zheke.</p><p>Yan Zheke replied with an “O-shaped mouth expression”,</p><p>“Cheng, what are your objectives and thoughts about this “Master” competition?”</p><p>“Hmm. It’s mainly to broaden my views.,” Lou Cheng answered humbly.</p><p>Amidst this relative neutral attitude, he also felt a little emotional.</p><p>These are experts that I have looked up upon since young and those familiar names. I can finally walk among you guys! I finally have the chance to challenge you all!</p><p>“Warrior Sage”, Qian Donglou, “King of Swords”, Wu Qiao, “Kirin”, Dong Baxian, “Lion King”, “Spear King”, Huang Ke, “Clown”, Gu Jianxi, “God Slaying Sabre”, Lu Yongyuan, “Late Bloomer”, Liang Yifan… All these famous names flashed in Lou Cheng’s mind one after another, making him feel like his blood was boiling.</p><p>…</p><p>The next morning. After completing morning practice, Lou Cheng, Guo Jie and Long Zhen arrived at the airport under the lead of “Empress Luo”, Ning Zitong. They boarded the commercial plane of the club and headed towards Jiu Qu City. As for Lu Yan, he had chosen to give up on the “Master” competition due to an injury he’d sustained. However, he still followed the team to fulfil his responsibilities as the coach.</p><p>Outside the windows, seas of clouds were everywhere.</p><p>There was turbulences from time to time but their influence could be ignored.</p><p>It was a smooth journey and they arrived at central Jiu Qu City by noon. They boarded the few commercial cars that were arranged by the External Affairs Team in advance.</p><p>At the hall of the hotel, there were fans welcoming them like always. After signing in, Lou Cheng and the rest received their room cards with the assistance of Auman and their personal assistants. They entered the lift and were on their way to their rooms.</p><p>“There’s a pre-competition banquet at night the following days. Don’t forget about it.” Empress Luo reminded the group as the lift was moving up. After which, she turned to Lou Cheng and said to him with a smile, “You have a high chance of fighting in the opening match.”</p><p>“Huh?” Lou Cheng looked at her with confusion.</p><p>As just one of the many contestants, how high would my chances be during the drawing of the lots?</p><p>Ning Zitong smiled and explained, “The three of you are in the spotlight recently and have high conversational value. The organizing committee has the intention to choose one of you guys to be in the opening match.”</p><p>An one in three chance… This is indeed not low… Lou Cheng subconsciously smiled.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
