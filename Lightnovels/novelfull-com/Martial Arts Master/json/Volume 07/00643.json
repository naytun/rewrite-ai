His vision, distorted from the heat, returned to normal. Vigor returned to his eyes. He dusted his clothes, stood up.</p><p>He looked at Lou Cheng and asked thoughtfully:</p><p>“You integrated ice and flames?”</p><p>He asked through telepathy to avoid being recorded by the cameras.</p><p>A freezing palm with dazzling white flames burning on the outside. Lou Cheng knew it was pointless trying to hide the essence of that move from Wang Que.</p><p>“That’s right!” he admitted with a nod.</p><p>As though he had just solved a difficult puzzle, Wang Que was more at ease physically and mentally. He exhaled, turned and was ready to leave.</p><p>A thought flitted across Lou Cheng’s mind.</p><p>“Can you use your Shunpo consecutively?” he blurted.</p><p>They had been using telepathy all along, and this sentence was no exception.</p><p>Lou Cheng regretted the words right as they left his mouth. He shouldn’t have probed into another martial artist’s signature move.</p><p>Wang Que stopped walking, hesitated, then smiled graciously.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Without lingering, he walked on the path that was now covered in ditches and flames, towards to exit he came from previously. His back was straight. Under the illumination of the spotlights, he seemed neither humble nor arrogant.</p><p>He could? Lou Cheng nodded slowly. As he basked in the warm applause, another thought spawned in his mind.</p><p>If that’s the case, then the best way to use Wang Que’s Shunpo shouldn’t be to evade, but to attack!</p><p>Hands aloft, Lou Cheng clapped to show his appreciation to the audience around him. He walked down the well-lit road of glory until he disappeared at the edge of the venue.</p><p>During that time, his fatigue was made apparent when the feebleness and over-exhaustion kicked in. His steps were unsteady, as though he just recovered from a severe illness.</p><p>Then again, being gravely injured for a long time had accustomed him to such inconveniences. He walked with a steady gait, not at all troubled.</p><p>When he was back in the changing room, he first took his phone back from Auman and sent a text to Yan Zheke.</p><p>“I won! [snickering]”</p><p>It was morning in Connecticut. Yan Zheke, who was listening intently to her lecturer, felt a jolt in her pocket.</p><p>She looked around furtively, stuck her hand into her pocket, and took out her phone. She took a quick glance before the screen dimmed.</p><p>The corners of her lips curved into an aesthetic arc. She stuffed her phone back and propped her head up with one hand. Her glossy dark hair streamed down through the gaps between her fingers. She listened on attentively, with a fresh hint of excitement.</p><p>…</p><p>In the commentator’s box, the host studied the heavyweight guest commentator beside him. He cleared his throat and began in an ill-at-ease manner.</p><p>“What an incredible battle! Senior Wuguang, what do you think?”</p><p>Taoist Wuguang had dark hair interspersed by silver strands and mild temperament. He smiled slightly.</p><p>“Indeed.”</p><p>He had the plain looks of one of those old fellas you’ll see anywhere. Anyone who saw him for the first time would feel like they have seen him before somewhere.</p><p>For a moment, the host was rendered speechless by the brusque reply. He had to lead the conversation.</p><p>With all smiles, he said, “Senior Wuguang, I never expected to have you here as a guest host. It’s rare that you are free to join us, did you get a pass into the next round? Wait, I don’t seem to remember seeing you in the first round.”</p><p>“Have you just realized it?” Taoist Wuguang shook his head and smiled. “My registration wasn’t successful…”</p><p>He smiled nonchalantly, as though it was a common occurrence to him.</p><p>“Why’s that?” blurted the host, puzzled.</p><p>“During registration, the staff at our sect forgot to include my name. The committee, sure of my attendance, didn’t verify it either,” replied Taoist Wuguang, amused and frustrated.</p><p>And thus, without anything better to do in mind, he agreed to be a guest commentator.</p><p>But you are the Sect Master… is what the host wanted to say, but he swallowed the words before they came out.</p><p>He then smiled. “Senior Wuguang, can you tell give us some insights on the previous match?”</p><p>Taoist Wuguang ruminated.</p><p>“Lou Cheng and Wang Que have performed outstandingly. They are the cream of the crop among the younger generation. Lou Cheng’s victory can be partly attributed to the element of surprise, for Wang Que didn’t know much of his moves, given his limited battles against Physical Invulnerability Experts. But that in itself plays a major part in combat between martial artists.”</p><p>“We are lucky to have arena matches in modern times. One to two hundred, or thousand years ago, having a secret trump card was the key to winning as the underdog. So many mighty ones never recovered after one instance of carelessness.”</p><p>“Physical Invulnerability Experts still get the chance to regret, but those below Physical Invulnerability, heh…”</p><p>Wuguang shook his head and went on.</p><p>“I have to criticize Wang Que here. He knew Lou Cheng had many tricks up his sleeves, but despite his lack of understanding his opponent, he didn’t take enough precautions. This is clearly overconfidence. Such a habit isn’t a huge deal in arena matches, but he will be exposed to genuine danger in actual combat.”</p><p>“Perhaps Wang Que never expected Lou Cheng to have so many tricks, pulling out something new even at the end of the match,” argued the host. Then, curious, he asked, “Senior Wuguang, I could see that Wang Que is powerful, but how do I observe something as abstract as “Master Potential”?”</p><p>Taoist Wuguang let the argument slide and explained seriously.</p><p>“When everyone practices the same kungfu, if you can master it at a deeper and purer level, and execute it in a stronger, faster, and simpler manner, that’s what we call Master Potential.”</p><p>What is he on about, it’s all too abstract and confusing… complained the host inwardly. He thought for a moment, then laughed softly and asked, “Then what do you think about Lou Cheng?”</p><p>Taoist Wuguang replied with great interest.</p><p>“From this battle, I could see that he didn’t forcefully meld his Ice and Fire powers into one, but managed to form a coordinated whole, down to the details. When the fire is on the exterior, the interior is controlled by ice. Wang Que didn’t realize this. He considered his opponent’s Ice and Fire independently.”</p><p>“This accords with Lou Cheng’s explanation in his interviews. I believe he has blazed a trail that no-one has ever set foot on, a trail that opens up new possibilities. His battle style, however similar to martial artists, is not entirely the same. If people don’t start recognizing this and try to measure him with old standards, there will be more people who are stronger than him losing to him.”</p><p>“Forget honor, if we are only talking about martial arts, he is worthy of a Master.”</p><p>“When Lou Cheng perfects this trail, invents a set of kungfu, and promotes it, he will be the Master of a new Sect. Unprecedented!”</p><p>“Unprecedented… These words have a lot of weight to it!” said the host sentimentally.</p><p>…</p><p>The number of comments under the “latest news” section in Yanzhao League Official Weibo surged once again, with fans expressing their opinions on the battle they just witnessed.</p><p>“Spectacular! Truly spectacular!”</p><p>“Stupid Que was being stupid again!”</p><p>“From what, um, that Shangqing Sect Master said, Stupid Que was too rash!”</p><p>“That’s not true. Lou Cheng is indeed impressive. He’s worthy of the title Heavenly Son of China!”</p><p>“Sigh, he truly lives up to his prestigious title…”</p><p>“Even though there are many factors leading to Lou Cheng’s victory, he still managed to beat a second Pin fair and square. His battle power is at least close to Second Pin.”</p><p>“But he only made the breakthrough three months ago…”</p><p>“Well, according to the Shangqing Sect Master, Lou Cheng might really become a martial arts master.”</p><p>…</p><p>Yan Xiaoling replied to some posts on the forums as she scrolled through her “rivals’” comments. She felt very satisfied and contented as she shuffled between Yanzhao League Official Weibo, Yanzhao League Forum, Wang Que Weibo, Wang Que Forum, and even to slightly irrelevant sites like Wuyue Club and Shangqing Sect, reading every word fervently.</p><p>When things calmed down, she felt more tired than if she’d fought a competition. Most of the fans from Lou Cheng forum were doing the same thing.</p><p>…</p><p>In the changing room, Wang Que didn’t leave immediately.</p><p>After tending to his injuries, he kept rewatching his battle with Lou Cheng, hitting pause at times, lost in thought.</p><p>His battle style is similar to Wisdom King…</p><p>He has many control techniques…</p><p>It’s well-connected from every aspect…</p><p>…</p><p>Time passed quickly as he mulled over it. Wang Que, sitting on the sofa with his legs crossed, suddenly stood up. It seemed like he was eager to put something into practice.</p><p>…</p><p>When he was back at the hotel, the exhausted Lou Cheng gave Yan Zheke an update, then fell into a slumber.</p><p>Seeing that she wasn’t needed, Auman returned to the opposite room. She happened to run into Guo Jie’s assistant, Wang Yuexi, coming out from the showers.</p><p>Seeing Auman, Wang Yuexi froze, then smiled and gave her a thumbs-up.</p><p>“Your boss is too strong!”</p><p>“I guess,” replied Auman with a smile. So this is what it feels like to share someone’s honor, she thought.</p><p>…</p><p>After the second round of competitions, Lou Cheng was matched against an Inhuman opponent —who made it through luck—and advanced effortlessly. Peng Leyun was against the Witch, Qian Hui. He played around too much and tasted his first loss since attaining Physical Invulnerability. The good thing was, he wasn’t eliminated.</p><p>Ren Li finally met a worthy opponent and claimed a tough win.</p><p>As of then, there were 65 Mighty Ones remaining. All the Inhumans had been eliminated. The result of the 4th round of lot drawing was about to be announced.</p><p>Lou Cheng kept a keen ear on the results as he chatted idly with Ke Ke. He heard his name before he had prepared himself mentally.</p><p>Huh… Lou Cheng shifted his gaze to the television screen, eager to see the answer that was about to be revealed.</p><p>Displaying the strip, the guest announced with a smile.</p><p>“Daxing Temple, Living Buddha Shi Shan!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
