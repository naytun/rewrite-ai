Pushing off with his hands, he jumped off and landed accurately on the extended portion of the tenth level. He was almost completely silent when he landed. Moreover, the gunshots and explosion from the direction of the military base had further covered all signs of movements.</p><p>He was just like an agile ape and fell constantly down the exterior of the building. In just a few seconds, he landed solidly on the ground and stood firmly.</p><p>Keeping his breathing in check and freezing the surface of his body, he isolated his scent. After which, Lou Cheng executed a Cultivation Technique to prevent others from noticing his lethality. He made his way around the building and snuck to the front. In the end, he had his back against the wall, hid himself in a corner and the shadows while waiting for Constantine and the mummy to walk past.</p><p>In the whole process, the vitality in his eyes seemed to have been frozen like the water of a lake. They were quiet and chilling.</p><p>Ten steps, nine steps, eight steps… Lou Cheng counted down quietly. Suddenly, Constantine stopped. He cleared his throat and raised his voice slightly, “Although Sathah had chosen to explode his body, he wouldn’t be completely vaporized. There should still be some flesh and blood remaining.”</p><p>“What are you trying to say?” asked the mummy as he was using the realm of “Self Reflection” to slowly repair his arms that had suffered comminuted fractures.</p><p>“My initial reward is supposed to be Sathah’s flesh and blood. Who would have expected him to choose the most intense way to retaliate.,” said Constantine as he shrugged his shoulders. “I got to look for any remaining parts of his body and absorb the blood in it. This would still be better than nothing.”</p><p>The mummy thought about it for a while before nodding his head reluctantly.</p><p>“Make it quick. I have to head back into the stone coffin for recovery immediately.</p><p>“No problem. I’m very sensitive to the smell of fresh blood.,” laughed Constantine before walking back towards the last position where Sathah had chosen to sacrifice himself. As he walked, he squinted his eyes and wriggled his nose to detect the faintly discernible scent in the thick smoke.</p><p>Lou Cheng stopped his silent countdown and raised his back slightly. He bent his knees slightly and was ready to strike.</p><p>“Over here…” mumbled Constantine. After which, he walked to the edge of the explosion and picked up half a segment of a finger from the opposite roadside. The edges of the severed finger had been badly burnt.</p><p>This was one of the few remaining traces of Sathah that was left behind in this world.</p><p>Squeezing his fingers, the skin on the severed finger cracked and the few remaining drops of blood dripped down.</p><p>Constantine sniffed intoxicatedly before stuffing the severed finger like an ice popsicle into his mouth. Despite seeing internal organs that were dug out frequently, the mummy still couldn’t help but felt nauseated.</p><p>It’s now! Lou Cheng retracted his breathing and blood flow before exploding them in an instant. Pushing off with his legs and straightening his back, he pounced towards the mummy in a crazy manner, leaving afterimages as he moved. In his mind, he had started visualizing. However, this hadn’t affected his advancing speed.</p><p>The mummy instantly felt his heart skip a beat and noticed something was not right. However, before he could make his response, the assaulter had rushed to him and occupied his entire vision.</p><p>Lou Cheng! The sense of danger he felt turned into a cold wave that traversed through his spine. As both of his arms had suffered comminuted fractures, he could no longer exert strength. Decisively, he raised his right calf and swung it fiercely on the spot.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>The air split and the faint light turned into a blade. The “kick blade” moved fiercely towards Lou Cheng, enveloped within corrosive black gas.</p><p>Facing such an attack, Lou Cheng didn’t care at all. He simply tilted his body so that he avoided his vitals.</p><p>Crack! The “kick blade” smashed onto the “Ice Armor” on his ribs and crushed the ice crystals.</p><p>Lou Cheng could felt a jerk of pain from his muscle and bone. In that instance, his killing intent grew stronger. He swung his right arm, which was kept behind his back previously, and his fist flew towards his opponent like a bolt of lightning. The surrounding temperature was decreasing rapidly as the fist landed on the chest of the mummy.</p><p>A kick for a punch!</p><p>Pfft! His punch didn’t seem to have hit someone with flesh and blood. On the contrary, it felt like it had sunk into a rotten “wood”. Nonetheless, the power that could freeze one’s mind and organs started spreading.</p><p>“Severe Warning”!</p><p>The chest of the mummy cracked and his heart turned black. In an instant, his eyes lost vitality and he felt just like he had returned to his usual slumber.</p><p>However as a deceased, he had extremely strong resistance against, freezing, stiffening and slumbering related powers and had not lost his innate conscious. Without further consideration, he followed the impact from Lou Cheng’s punch and retreated backwards, opening up some distance. He planned to wait for reinforcement and not give Lou Cheng the opportunity for a subsequent move. At this moment, Constantine had also reacted. Holding Sathah’s finger in his mouth, he turned around and pounced rapidly towards Lou Cheng. His cape spread out due to the wind, just like the wings of a giant bat.</p><p>At this moment, a flicker of light flashed passed and dispersed the surrounding darkness. From the balcony of the tall building, the clear light from a sword shot down.</p><p>The green light of the sword started spinning rapidly, causing a violent and strong hurricane. Originating from the top, it enveloped the mummy, whose thoughts had slowed.</p><p>Swish swish swish!</p><p>The flash from the sword and the hurricane arrived at the same time. If the enemy was enveloped in it, he would definitely be ripped into countless smart pieces.</p><p>Wind Sect’s hundred and twelve move, “Heaven’s Burial”!</p><p>The killing intent of the sword struck the mummy’s brain, jerking him awake. Seeing that he couldn’t avoid it, he could only endure the piercing pain of needles striking his brain. He struggled to wriggle his shoulders and lift up his fractured arms. After which, he corroded the surrounding surface and created countless sand.</p><p>The sand scurried upwards and enveloped the mummy while dry and scorching winds surrounded him, carrying countless sand grains.</p><p>A blunt knife cutting meat instantly sounded unceasingly. Strong winds leaked out, carrying sand grains, flesh and blood out before falling to the ground.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>After an explosion, the light from the sword and the strong gust of wind dissipated. Carrying the long sword in her arms, Ren Li did a somersault in the air as she descended suavely. As for the mummy, he had lost his yellowish bandage. Even his charcoal-black skin was almost completely shaven off. There were also several palpable wounds on his body and head, exposing his dull colored organs and greyish-white brain.</p><p>His left arm was severed from his shoulder while his right arm was missing the hand and wrist. He looked extremely wretched but what was creepy was that he had not shed a single drop of blood. Instead, he followed the force of the impact and leapt towards Constantine who was quickly approaching.</p><p>To him, the blood-sucking bat was unprecedentedly cute and handsome!</p><p>Lou Cheng’s eyes clearly reflected the figure of Constantine and his speed was truly terrifying.</p><p>Suddenly, Ren Li who was still suspended in mid-air seemed to have turned into a gust of unrestrained wind and changed her direction! Using the momentum of falling, she invoked the green light of the sword and slashed toward the Dark Night Bat!</p><p>Wind Sect’s twenty-sixth move, “Unfettered Shift”!</p><p>As for Lou Cheng, he had completely ignored Constantine who was about to attack him. He bent his body until he was almost parallel to the ground before retracting his breathing and blood flow.</p><p>After which, he straightened his back fiercely and raised both of his arms with momentum.</p><p>In that instant, extreme darkness emerged and surrounded him. However, in the midst of the darkness, it was also decorated with bright and hot stars. It was as though the miniature version of the universe had descended.</p><p>The “Cosmic” shot up as Lou Cheng raised both of his arms. It immediately expanded and enveloped the mummy in an instance.</p><p>The surface of the mummy was instantly covered by a layer of frost and he felt just like his body was sealed. Coupled with the fact that he was in mid-air, he had completely lost his ability to change his direction.</p><p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh!</p><p>Those stars expanded rapidly, turned into “Emperor Yan” and smashed crazily onto the body of the mummy, causing violent explosions and igniting flames that could bury everything.</p><p>“No!” The wail of the mummy ended suddenly. Amidst the terrifying consecutive explosion, his body was blown into pieces and turned into dust by the scorching white flames.</p><p>This was the unique skill of combining Cultivation and path of martial arts and the foundation that Lou Cheng had relied on to make the great leap! “Cosmic Universe”!</p><p>Thud thud thud! At this moment, the severed left arm and right palm finally fell to the ground, raising sand into the air and desolately told the story of a past physical invulnerability expert.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Constantine naturally wouldn’t allow Ren Li to split him into two in a strike and quickly dodged to the side. As his afterimages slowly faded, he clenched his fist had hit the side of the sword of his opponent. His opponent was sent flying away but still managed to land safely on the ground. Just as he was thinking of turning around to attack Lou Cheng, he heard the shriek from the mummy and saw the rain of flames falling.</p><p>Constantine’s hair stood up in horror. He quickly stomped his legs and dashed away, leaving only his afterimages behind.</p><p>He was decisive and wanted to use his speed to shake off the two assaulters.</p><p>At this moment, strong gusts of wind started blowing crazily. In just several instances, Ren Li had caught up to Constantine. She was equally apt in speed and specialized in movement technique!</p><p>Ren Li, who had just broken through, was supposed to be slower than Constantine in theory. However, her opponent had suffered grave injuries!</p><p>Seeing that Ren Li had managed to impede the Dark Night Bat, Lou Cheng used his current attainment and imitated Sathah. He opened up all his pores below his feet and behind his back. By releasing controlled Emperor Yan Force through these pores, bluish-white flame darted out.</p><p>Using the reaction force, Lou Cheng seemed to have turned into a rocket that was launched. He clenched his fist tightly and smashed it to the side of Constantine’s face after covering several hundred meters in a single leap!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
