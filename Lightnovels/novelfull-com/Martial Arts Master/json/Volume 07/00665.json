His charred remains were beyond recognition. There were fragments of distorted molten metal, which could have been accessories, some junk in his pockets, or anything, really. The blonde man with aquamarine eyes was now a messy heap of blood and flesh. Still, he was relatively easier to search compared to his buddy, who only had his lower half.</p><p>With a flick of the thumb, Lou Cheng created a crystalline sword using techniques from Ice Spirit Holy Light. He probed inside the heap of blood and flesh, poking and stirring as he utilized the enhanced senses from All-Seeing God.</p><p>In his mind, the calm lake produced a clear reflection. Suddenly, he noticed thin, silver objects in the corpse. They were spread across every part of the flesh and blood mixture, glistening with a dim metallic sheen.</p><p>Lou Cheng thought of the things he had seen and heard while he was at the military base. “Nanorobotics?” he guessed, surprised.</p><p>From there, he deduced further:</p><p>If his enemy had such advanced technology, then it wouldn’t be strange if there were other devices fixed to his coded opponents.</p><p>The enemy, through some method, may already be aware of the death of their comrades…</p><p>Thoughts racing, Lou Cheng looked around him. He backed into the ruined factory a couple of meters away and hid behind a half-collapsed wall with metal beams protruding from it. Concealing his Qi and blood, he activated his secret art. Leaning against the wall like he was invisible, he monitored the battlefield through the reflection from fragments of shattered glass and the vision from All-Seeing God.</p><p>Assuming that the mysterious organization was aware of what went down, it was highly likely they would send backup to investigate. If the enemy was to be deterred by his presence, he’d lose his only lead and reach a dead-end.</p><p>The information provided by the military mentioned nothing of a North Harbour Base.</p><p>On the other hand, if Ke Ke’s grandparents arrived first, he’d greet them and get them to hide as well.</p><p>A few minutes later, Lou Cheng felt a presence. The air around him was heavier than before.</p><p>He cautiously retracted his senses, relinquishing his “bird’s eye view,” and monitored the entrance to the ruined factory solely through the reflection of shattered glass.</p><p>He counted silently. From the corner of his eye, he discerned a blurry figure in a green and white baseball jersey.</p><p>A man with number “16” printed on his back advanced on black high-top combat boots, stopping before the remains of One-Eyed Dragon. His strong-featured, deeply-wrinkled face was void of expression. Laser-like light gathered in his eyes.</p><p>Fearing further complications, Lou Cheng didn’t wait any longer. Hiding his breathing and distorting the rays of light around him, he took a careful step sideways, preparing for an ambush.</p><p>However, just as he moved, the brown-haired man turned sideways, facing the half-collapsed structure.</p><p>What powerful senses… It’s as though he has radars attached to him! Eyes on his target, Lou Cheng straightened himself and walked out while unleashing his aura.</p><p>If he couldn’t set up an ambush, he had to crush him directly.</p><p>Number 16 noted the sudden emergence of a young man in navy blue from the dark. The young man’s eyes were dark and thoughtful, his gait balanced and controlled, as though he was tamping down his heart.</p><p>One step, two steps. Number 16 felt the scenery around him grow distant and blurry, as though he was being forcefully pulled away from his spot. He was alone and helpless, floating aimlessly in the endless cosmos. Around him were black, heavy curtains ornamented with diamond-like stars. The dreamy vastness made life seem insignificant.</p><p>His opponent, clad in navy-blue and standing in the center, seemed like a divine existence that reigned over the universe and observed all life from above. Around him, a scorching red fireball formed, entering a highly elliptical orbit. Following that, a faint purple fireball shone above him, then a golden fireball hovered behind him. At last, a dazzling white and light-blue fireball formed a circle around him, constantly switching positions but never intersecting.</p><p>The sense of imminent danger made Number 16 snap out of his trance. It occurred to him that he was at a disadvantage amidst this clash of aura and psychological warfare, and had missed the best opportunity to strike while his opponent was setting up his attack.</p><p>He didn’t have emotions, but that doesn’t mean he didn’t have his mind.</p><p>Number 16 raised his hands, his eyes impassive, and loosened every pore on his palm to release a pure, blinding radiance.</p><p>The radiance gathered and went off with a boom, like twin dragons flying through the darkness, jaws agape as they sought to devour the stars.</p><p>At the same time, he twisted his waist, flashing beside Lou Cheng. Raising his leg, he swung his knees and kicked forward with quivering feet. A crescent light blade formed, silently slashing towards Lou Cheng.</p><p>He had displayed the level of a Terror Grade expert!</p><p>Lou Cheng sidestepped the laser beam so easily it was as though he predicted it. The laser beam struck the ruined factory in the back, piercing through layers of half-collapsed walls. The tottering structure went down with a crash. As all this happened in the background, he saw Lou Cheng’s right arm whipping towards him like a steel whip. The colorful fireballs around Lou Cheng congregated, then smashed towards him at once. As for the crescent strike, Lou Cheng paid no heed.</p><p>A dim green glow flitted across Number 16’s eyes. He bent down and bounced away, going high as though he had springs fixed to his feet.</p><p>Seeing this, Lou Cheng straightened his knees and sunk his feet into the ground. With a quick twist of the waist, he pressed down on the inner part of his arm like a spear, sending it upwards. This caused the Nine Flames to rise up slowly. Affected by the gravity of the dense fireballs, the crescent strike distorted, mostly dispersing by the time it hit Lou Cheng. It merely chipped off the surface layer of his ice armor.</p><p>The Nine Flames, in pursuit of Number 16, shot up into the sky.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>An enormous, dazzling white fireball bloomed mid-air, spitting molten lava and brilliant fireworks in every direction. The strong light drowned Number 16. The terrible noise cracked the remaining windows in San Jones Street.</p><p>In the gathering gales and rain of sparks, Number 16’s figure appeared above. His clothes were tattered, his pants reduced to dust. His body was charred and dented.</p><p>If he hadn’t avoided the center of the explosion by evading mid-air and activating a laser shield at the last minute, he would have been gravely wounded.</p><p>Number 16 was hovering in the air with no sign of descending.</p><p>He had the ability to fly!</p><p>Flying was at Physical Invulnerability level!</p><p>Previously, under the effect of Lou Cheng’s aura lock-down and psychological intimidation, he couldn’t take to the skies straight away, fearing he would be struck down. Therefore, he had to attack first to create opportunities. This way, he would be putting himself in a spot where victory was guaranteed, and at the same time, bait out his enemy’s fearsome killer move. However, he didn’t expect his opponent to be able to control the Nine Rotations of Five Flames freely and switch up his move halfway. His plan had not only failed, but also cost him terrible losses.</p><p>Pressing his right hand to his left, Number 16 reached out. An aquamarine glow darted across his eyes as he locked onto Lou Cheng’s figure.</p><p>“Mortar Strike. Augmentation!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A dazzling white beam was released from his left palm, blasting at Lou Cheng on ground-level.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The dazzling white beams shot out one after the other, plowing the entire plot of land.</p><p>Lou Cheng moved with Mesmerizing Snow Steps, zig-zagging and dodging the mortar strikes with the help of All-Seeing God. He also swept up a frigid wind which set the dazzling white beams off-track.</p><p>Swish, swish, swish! Rumble, rumble, rumble! While dodging, Lou Cheng flicked out frost beams as he materialized scarlet fireballs and blasting them at Number 16.</p><p>Number 16, like a fighter jet, dodged all of Lou Cheng’s counter-attacks by gaining altitude, circling around or halting in his tracks.</p><p>The situation persisted for a while. Suddenly, a laser gathered in a device in Number 16’s eyes and shot out at lightning speed.</p><p>But with his danger premonition, Lou Cheng had repositioned himself before the laser had even fired. The two faint green beams landed on the ground, leaving deep ditches.</p><p>Knowing that the loud attack would garner attention and seeing that he couldn’t take the enemy down quickly, Number 16 decided to retreat. Hastily, he flew out of the factory ruins.</p><p>Freed from the fire suppression, Lou Cheng glanced at a half-destroyed pillar in the rubble. He could use that to propel himself into the air and use Formation formula to stop his enemy.</p><p>That was when Number 16 saw an older, longsword-wielding woman with bunned up hair and an elegant air closing in on him.</p><p>Immediately after, a meteor, dragging a long trail of light in its wake, darted across the sky, dispelling the darkness. It filled his vision before colliding into him.</p><p>The strong suction that resulted caused a delay in Number 16’s maneuvers.</p><p>Bam! Sprinting forward, Lou Cheng leapt into the air and pushed off using the half-destroyed pillar.</p><p>Mid-air, he formed a hand seal.</p><p>“Formation!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
