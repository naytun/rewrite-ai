His extreme exhaustion made him fall into a deep slumber, unaware of his surroundings.</p><p>Lou Cheng, Ji Jianzhang, Dou Ning, and some military personnel sat around him, flipping through thick piles of classified information. They were printed based on the information they had acquired from the North Harbour Base.</p><p>According to the description inside, the underground laboratory had long been in existence, by now a historical building. Initially built as an air-raid shelter, it was eventually expanded to its present state. Two years ago, the laboratory’s renovation brought in a research team, a combined effort between America and Japan, a sub-branch of AWP that switched over from high-tech devices to Genetic Guidance. Japan had previously conducted many experiments on Genetic Guidance and had expertise.</p><p>Many years had passed since America first started on the AWP. After countless trials and errors, they gradually found success, marked by the creation of the combat-ready Number 1. Through upgrades and modification, they eventually arrived at Number 15.</p><p>Though every number corresponded to one test subject, many failed subjects were sacrificed behind the scenes. Even for the ones that succeeded, a number of them had malfunctioned, for many reasons, and were removed from the series. These failures laid the groundwork for subsequent modifications. As of now, the only test subjects still in service were Number 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 14, and 15. And after the purge by Lou Cheng and the others, the only ones that survived were Number 14 and 15 at the America HQ.</p><p>Among those, Number 15 was well-developed in every aspect. This gave all Danger Grade Mighty Ones in America a second chance at life—they could be modified at a fairly high success rate as long as they didn’t face instant death. Even worse, they would become stiffen and mechanical and lose most of their memories, retaining only their instincts. However, they could still mimic normal behavior because of the chips transplanted into them.</p><p>In the course of their experiments, they installed a force-stop program in every test subject for a number of reasons—one of which was a countermeasure to if they went berserk. This was what triggered the genetic collapse in Number 5, the one with blonde hair and blue eyes.</p><p>After accumulating enough data from Danger Grade experiments, the AWP scientists set their eyes on Terror Grade. And thus, Number 16, who became a vegetable after severe brain damage—a person who the public believed to be dead—came into their radar.</p><p>A year later, Number 16 revived. Even without chip transplants, he could automatically battle at a similar level to when he was “alive.” His daily behavior, however, was a mess, so it had to rely on simulations.</p><p>With this success, the AWP team set their eyes on greater goals. That is, to create beings capable of individual thinking no different from a normal Physical Invulnerability expert. Of course, the brainwashing and manipulation process was still requisite.</p><p>For that reason, they decreased the application of nanotechnology and cooperated with Japan. Starting from Genetic Guidance, the North Harbour Base came into operation.</p><p>In less than a year, Number 17, originally adept at manipulating fire, was born through the Genetic Guidance and Genetic Copying of numerous Fire-typed Terror Grade experts. There weren’t any defects in his cognitive ability or movements, besides his disposition being aloof and taciturn. The scientists rejoiced at his combat abilities which, through fusion with high-tech devices, were at a Physical Invulnerability level, and displayed room for growth. They called him the Flame Manipulating Master who would one day rival the Dragon King.</p><p>For Number 17 and the earlier versions, the test subjects used to create them were mostly at the brink of death. None of the experiments involving healthy prisoners of war succeeded.</p><p>Through the success of Number 17, the Japanese Physical Invulnerability expert who was in charge of the base saw hope in upgrading herself. With ample preparations, she accepted a controlled amount of modification. It turned out to be a huge success. However, her personality was distorted in the process, and she began addressing herself as Number 18.</p><p>This history of hers explains why she authoritatively raised the absurd proposal of apology and compensation earlier.</p><p>Recently, there had been another breakthrough in the experiments conducted at North Harbour Base.</p><p>Before, the combat level of the test subjects was dependent on their original stage. Modifications could only increase battle power slightly, which inevitably came with excessive defects. But this time, the scientists found a better method, one that could trigger a qualitative change in a weak person by using stronger genes. For testing purposes, they were in dire need of human subjects.</p><p>Broadly speaking, there were a decent number of experts at the Inhuman level in this world. But that doesn’t mean they were commonplace. Plus, it’s not like they would find volunteers or dying experts knocking at their door in such a short time.</p><p>So they set their eyes on Lin Que, an Inhuman venturing in the war-torn zones who didn’t seem to have any powerful connections. Number 16, the one in charge of retrieving him, then assigned the task to Number 4, 5, and 6.</p><p>The subsequent information verification was to be done by Number 17, who worked well independently and often carried out missions in the war-torn zones.</p><p>“It’s a pity that the main laboratory was destroyed during the battle. Much of the data has been lost. Plus, judging from Que’s condition, the breakthrough they made wasn’t exactly successful,” said Ji Jianzhang sentimentally after browsing through the files.</p><p>Lin Que’s experiment had not yet reached the most dangerous stage.</p><p>“This information is ample. It will be a huge help to our research,” said the military personnel. He wholeheartedly agreed with what Ji Jianzhang had said, but didn’t have the courage to put it to words.</p><p>Aimlessly flipping through the files, he remarked,</p><p>“With the senior researchers and Number 18 all dead, and the main laboratory in ruins, I’m afraid we’ll never learn the method to force-stop or control Number 17. Damn shame…”</p><p>Otherwise, the military would have another Physical Invulnerability expert at their disposal.</p><p>Lou Cheng allowed himself some time to think. Thoughtfully, he said,</p><p>“There are two possible explanations to why Number 17 joined the fray. The first was the presence of Number 18. The second was that he wanted to see to it that all the researchers were killed, and the main laboratory thoroughly destroyed…”</p><p>He wouldn’t have dared to slack off. At least not before he confirmed that Number 18 was doomed to die. Neither did he have the balls to become a turncoat and start killing his own. If he did, Number 18 might have just taken him to hell with her. “Killing” him was a piece of cake to her.</p><p>“I agree,” Dou Ning nodded in agreement.</p><p>If Number 17 possessed a normal person’s cognitive abilities, like what was stated in the files, then…</p><p>That was when the plane encountered turbulence. Lou Cheng swallowed what he was about to say. He gazed outside the window at the land exposed through the thin clouds and the minimized ruinous city. Suddenly recalling what he had seen and heard during his past two days in the wartorn zones, he couldn’t help but wonder aloud,</p><p>“When will this place regain its peace…”</p><p>The environment, as a whole, had filled the war-torn zones with a seemingly inevitable despair. In such an ambiance, Lou Cheng was affected as well. He felt like nothing he did would have mattered anyway, so he chose to watch dejectedly rather than intervene with the way things worked there.</p><p>Ji Jianzhang, following suit, turned and looked outside.</p><p>“You can’t call any of the factions here allies of justice,” he said, half sentimental and half self-deprecatingly.</p><p>His words created an awkward atmosphere amongst the few military personnel beside him. They made a show of browsing through files and admiring the scenery.</p><p>“No individual, not even a Forbidden Area Mighty One, can change the state of affairs here,” Ji Jianzhang went on. “We can only hope for the persistent war to spur desires for peace, and that self-proclaimed monarchies and Mighty Ones can reach a compromise.”</p><p>“Have you seen Gelangang? With our aid, they prioritised on rebuilding infrastructures and maintaining order, which in turn attracted many refugees. They are developing. Fast. If this goes on, they will become an example to the rest of the war-torn zones, and other powers will seek to imitate them. Then, with some reforms peace will spread a little at a time. Things will eventually get better,” emphasized one of the military personnel.</p><p>That was when Lou Cheng, Ji Jianzhang, and Dou Ning all sensed a slight movement from Lin Que. Their eyes focused on him. His eyelids were trembling as he opened them slowly.</p><p>“How are you feeling?” asked Dou Ning, concerned. She moved towards him.</p><p>“Hey, Granny and Gramps,” greeted Lin Que in his usual style. “I’m alright.”</p><p>Ji Jianzhang got up and stood beside the stretcher. “It was, in a way, a blessing in disguise. Your root pulp had been enhanced significantly, and you gained some strange abilities. You should be at the peak form of Inhuman after some recuperation. At that time, you can attempt to awaken your abilities through fighting in title tournaments. Perhaps you’ll even make the Great Leap earlier than expected. And even if all else fails, you can come back here and continue training through actual combat,” he said commiseratingly.</p><p>Lin Que didn’t shift his eyes, his pupils growing darker. Reserved but determined, he said,</p><p>“I would like to come here every year. Even after attaining Physical Invulnerability.”</p><p>Why bother training through actual combat after attaining Physical Invulnerability… Lou Cheng was taken aback. Then he realized his cousin-in-law’s actual intention.</p><p>“Don’t worry, other Mighty Ones have followed up in hunting down that human trafficking organization.”</p><p>Lin Que shut his eyes, then opened them again.</p><p>“I’ll still come,” he said slowly.</p><p>Still? Even after going through hell? Just to help as many as you can help? Just to offer respite to the tragedies that crosses your path?</p><p>Some sayings came to Lou Cheng’s mind:</p><p>He who has an icy countenance, but a Buddha’s heart…</p><p>He who devotes himself to a seemingly impossible cause…</p><p>Perhaps this was the true form of his cousin-in-law…</p><p>An obstinate boy…</p><p>Influenced, Lou Cheng was freed from the helplessness he felt. Smiling, he said,</p><p>“In the future, I’ll try to pick this place when I accept missions from the military.”</p><p>The next time he ran into someone in need of help, he’d do whatever he could to help…</p><p>The plane soared through the clouds. The outline of the southern region of China was getting closer.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
