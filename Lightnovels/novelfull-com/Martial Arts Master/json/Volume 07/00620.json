His leg was covered in a layer of scorching bluish-white flames. Upon impact, smoke rose and dismembered the body that had just “glued” together. The pieces fell sporadically on the floor and started burning.</p><p>At this moment, Lou Cheng finally heaved a sigh of relief and let his guard down.</p><p>He had never heard of any expert being able to resurrect after being dismembered. Even the Vampire King of Samanno Royal Family couldn’t achieve this. The only related rumour was from the Mission Sect, which claimed that the “Savior” from two thousand years ago could have achieved it. However, they had added too many religious and mysterious elements to it, making it hard for others to believe.</p><p>Who would have expected Dark Night Bat to be capable of such an incredible thing? He had simply demonstrated the “Acts of God” again. If it wasn’t because of his innate intuition for danger that prevented him from letting his guard down, he wouldn’t have returned to check. Constantine would probably have escaped, leaving endless possible problems in the future.</p><p>Just when Lou Cheng was about to completely burn this creepy enemy into ashes, he suddenly noticed that the blood he shed was different shades of red. There was red, dull red, rusty-red, faint red and even bright red blood. They were interacting with one another, resulting in dots of dull blue and faint gold patches.</p><p>How is this still blood? It looks more like some chemicals that are randomly mixed!</p><p>As for the flesh and tendons, they were wriggling and growing uncontrollably. Some of them formed a meat lump while others grew a new finger. This gave Lou Cheng goosebumps just from seeing.</p><p>“Genetic collapse…” mumbled Lou Cheng as he mumbled.</p><p>From the research information he received from the military, he had seen the miserable state of victims of genetic collapse. They were similar to what he was witnessing now. It was just that the blood of “Dark Night Bat” was creepier.</p><p>Several tens of seconds later, all the transformation had disappeared and Constantine had lost all signs of life. Some of the flesh rotted rapidly while others were still preserved in good condition.</p><p>“It’s really darned creepy…” Lou Cheng couldn’t help but cursed. After finding a piece of flesh the size of half a palm, he froze it in layers of ice and kept it in his pocket. For the remaining parts, he burnt them into ashes with flames he sent out after punching down on the ground. This was to eliminate all mediums for resurrection.</p><p>After doing all these, he finally had the luxury to think deeper about the issue of the resurrection of “Dark Night Bat”.</p><p>“Could it be that his body structure had become similar to an earthworm? As long as he was not split horizontally through the middle, it doesn’t matter even if he was cut into two in other ways?”</p><p>“But his heart is still a heart, his lungs are still lungs and liver is still liver previously. There’s nothing special about it.”</p><p>“Or could it be that his root pulps after mutation had made him similar to a single celled organism? As long as he could regather his parts within a certain amount of time, he could survive for a while and will also not lose his life completely? As for this type of gathering, it’s dependent on the mind to lead the process. Therefore, as long as the brain is not damaged, he would have been fine?”</p><p>“Forget it. I will stop making wild guesses. I’m not a professional researcher after all. It’s better to leave this for the military to research further.”</p><p>“However, one thing’s for sure. The resurrection ability of the Dark Night Bat requires time to prepare. Otherwise, he could have just risked injuries in exchange for an opportunity to kill us… Although Ren Li’s “Heaven’s Burial” is powerful, it wouldn’t threaten one’s life from the beginning. It’s more of a consecutive cutting style…”</p><p>At this point, Lou Cheng still did not know the names of these two opponents and could only use nicknames to address him.</p><p>After looking around for a while, Lou Cheng did not linger and left Khukhang at high speed towards the port city Fartouat. He only took a rest after entering the desert and found a hidden spot. He used the “Confrontation” Formula cleansed his mind and accelerated the recovery of his injuries.</p><p>…</p><p>After Lieutenant General Amon’s command team occupied Sathah’s military base, he returned to the temporary base amidst the remaining gunshots and explosions. After waiting for a good portion of the day, he still hadn’t seen Constantine and the mummy return.</p><p>“He doesn’t want his stone coffin anymore? He was so gravely injured…” Doubts rose within Amon. He instantly felt something wasn’t right and stood up immediately. Moving through the buildings of the cities, he returned to the battlefield where Sathah had self-destructed.</p><p>He looked around and soon discovered the severed arm and palm of the mummy. The yellowish bandage had disappeared and his charcoal-black skin was cleanly shaven off, leaving only his flesh and blood behind.</p><p>“He’s dead!” Amon’s eyes opened widely as he felt shocked and angry.</p><p>There was definitely an intense battle in this place. However, the explosions of cannons and gunshots were louder and the flames at the war scene were brighter. Because he was in the midst of the war zone, he had not discovered anything.</p><p>Nonetheless, even if the mummy was severely injured, he was still a demigod. He couldn’t possibly be killed off so easily. Could it be that it was the “Dark Night Bat” who did it?</p><p>Following the signs around, he investigated further. However, the incident had happened a while ago and the scent had already dissipated. He choose to give up halfway through his investigation. Nonetheless, he discovered the area where Constantine had split the ground and the array he left behind for his flesh and blood. This made Lieutenant General Amon reject his previous conjecture. However, the thought of this made him feel even colder.</p><p>“Dark Night Bat is dead too… Lieutenant General Amon took a deep breath and his heart skipped a beat.</p><p>After fighting together, he had a rough understanding of Constantine’s strength and what he specialized in. Moreover from the mysterious actions of Constantine, he definitely had other hidden abilities. Even he couldn’t confidently claim that he would win against him, let alone actually kill him!</p><p>To be able to kill two demigods in one go was definitely not something simple. In fact, this was extremely difficult. This would hold true even when taking into account the fact that one of them was seriously injured and the other was weakened. Just the thought of an enemy hiding in the dark was enough to send a chill down his spine!</p><p>After keeping silent for a few seconds, Lieutenant General Amon returned to the temporary base. He did not investigate or pursue further in fear of encountering the enemy accidentally and dying in vain.</p><p>At the heavily guarded headquarters, he reported to the Pharaoh.</p><p>At the other end of the telephone, it was silent at first before the question, “Do you have a clue?”</p><p>“Nope. They have eliminated the corpses and destroyed all signs. However, from the severed arm and palm, there is at least one enemy who specialized in cutting.,” answered Amon honestly.</p><p>At the other end of the phone, there was silence once again. After a while, he finally spoke, “Put that aside first and continue to maintain the order in Khukhang. Wait until everything has settled before investigating further… Fair enough.”</p><p>…</p><p>Beyond the Fartouat port, on a passenger liner, the sun was hung high up in the sky and the waves were high. The scenery was extremely refreshing.</p><p>Lou Cheng stood on the deck and admired the waves of the dead sea. After which, he took out the satellite phone that he borrowed from the Consulate and called his Master.</p><p>After recuperation, he had completely recovered and changed out of his torn and tattered martial arts suit. He felt refreshed and was leaving with one of the last few batches of evacuation ships.</p><p>“Hello?” The coarse voice of Shi Jianguo sounded from the opposite side of the phone.</p><p>“Master, it’s me. Siris and his family have evacuated from Nile.” Lou Cheng explained the outcome of his mission.</p><p>“I knew about it last night. Not bad, you’ve done well.,” laughed Geezer Shi.</p><p>It was initially an extremely difficult mission filled with danger. He might even have had to spar with physical invulnerability experts in the process. With the body that had undergone the third awakening of supernatural ability and polished with the Jindan, he wouldn’t die easily. However, there would definitely be stimulations and these were beneficial to arouse his fighting will to make the great leap. In the end, he had made the breakthrough in advance without external forces. Not only that the mission had become redundant, but the difficulty of it had also plunged.</p><p>Lou Cheng summarised and explained the situation in a simple manner before asking, “Master, is the issue with Lin Que urgent? Should I practice the Physical Invulnerability Chapters or look for him first?”</p><p>With the strength of Cousin-in-law, he wouldn’t get into trouble that easily in the war-torn zones that easily. It should be a problem even with some delays.</p><p>Shi Jianguo coughed once before saying, “There’s no hurry. Geezer Ji has changed his mind and has asked the people from Shushan Study in the war-torn area to keep a lookout. He has also asked the military for help and might even head there himself. There’s nothing for you to worry about. Come back and practice the Physical Invulnerability Chapters first. At the same time, you have to consolidate your connection with the Heaven and earth too.”</p><p>That arrogant brat was secretly allowed to sneak to the war-torn area by Geezer Ji for exposure. Asking you to find him was just an excuse to train you. And for now, what is there for you to train on?</p><p>“Alright.” Lou Cheng heaved a sigh.</p><p>If it wasn’t because he had awakened his supernatural ability in advance for the National Championship, his cousin-in-law should at least be at the level of a top-tier inhuman by now. With another two years of training in the war-torn area, he might just be at the brink of reaching physical invulnerability. In the end, he had just reached the inhuman stage and consolidated himself at this level currently. As for physical invulnerability, it felt so distant.</p><p>Closing his eyes and recalling the cold and reserved looks of Lin Que, Lou Cheng suddenly felt that Lin Que would likely not return before reaching the physical invulnerability stage.</p><p>Let’s hope that everything will turn out well…</p><p>Geezer Shi did not stay on this topic for long. He thought silently for a while before continuing, “After getting an initial mastery of the Physical Invulnerability Chapters, are you returning to the Longhu Club?</p><p>“Yeah, there are too many things that I owe to Dragon King and Longhu Club.,” answered Lou Cheng definitively.</p><p>“That’s fine. You have not started on the Fire Sect’s Physical Invulnerability Chapters after all. After completing another few secret missions, you might just be able to view the “Restricted” Godly Technique!” replied Geezer Shi heartily.</p><p>“Secret mission?” Lou Cheng asked with curiosity.</p><p>“They should have told you about it previously? After joining Longhu, you might be assigned a mission from the mission from time to time. For an inhuman, the missions are all very simple like helping out for security and cooperating for an experiment. When you have reached the physical invulnerability stage, there would be a certain level of difficulty. However, it wouldn’t be too dangerous. For those dangerous missions, you will definitely not be the only one. Dragon King might even be part of it. To sum it up, after accumulating contributions, you could then view the Taoist’s “Restricted” Godly Techniques!”</p><p>Geezer Shi explained the gist of it. With a rather emotional tone, he continued, “Just come back quickly. After consolidating your connection with the external world and getting initial mastery over the Physical Invulnerability Chapters of the Ice God Sect and FIre Sect, you will then be considered as a real physical invulnerability expert. At that time, you will have plenty of opportunities to spar with opponents at the same level. There would also be plenty of life-and-death matches. Don’t be like that brat Peng and brat Ren who anxiously asked to challenge physical invulnerability experts.”</p><p>“…” Lou Cheng suddenly felt guilty. “Master, there’s something I have to report to you.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Geezer Shi’s instantly tensed up.</p><p>This brat rarely speaks in such a tone. What kind of big mess did he cause this time?</p><p>Lou Cheng cleared his throat and said, “I met Ren Li last night. Together with her, we killed two physical invulnerability experts.”</p><p>“What did you say!?” Geezer Shi’s tone suddenly went up!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
