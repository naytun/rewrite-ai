The scorching purple fireball behind him flashed fleetingly before entering the space.</p><p>This technique was a continuation of Nine Rotations of Five Flames, Descent Of The Sun. For maximum power, he could merge all five colors of the fireballs into it. However, given that time was of the essence in keeping Qian Donglou restrained, he went with a simplified version.</p><p>As the punch landed, the area dimmed as though all light had been sucked away. The majestic aura made Chen Qitao look like a deity churning the heavens.</p><p>Even from a distance, Lou Cheng felt lonely and insignificant, as though he was the last person on earth. He couldn’t imagine what it would have been like if he had encountered the move.</p><p>The punch seems to have an effect on the mind. It differs from most Physical Invulnerability moves and pure mind arts. It’s similar to Lu Yongyuan’s final move, Eternal Silence, but more powerful, more intricate, and more fearsome, reflected Lou Cheng.</p><p>Could it be that one has to fully explore their mind’s potential, to attain absolute control of their brain in order to reach the Forbidden Area?</p><p>When that time comes, will reality and fantasy fuse together? Will matter and mind merge as one?</p><p>As he remained lost in thought, the Warrior Sage made his move. Pressing down on Chen Qitao’s fist, which was stuck onto him, he propelled himself backward. The Dragon King, dragged along, was forced to take a step forward.</p><p>That step put the Dragon King in the area of the broken power lines. Crackling electricity coursed through him.</p><p>Shuddering, his heaven-churning punch slowed down. Qian Donglou, taking advantage of his opponent’s pull-back momentum, dove down like a hawk. His right fist was aimed at Chen Qitao’s wrist, avoiding direct contact and meeting brute force with finesse.</p><p>His eyes twinkled, electricity dancing within. The Taoist hat on his head had been reduced to shreds, revealing his hair that was now standing on end like needles, countless silver sparks slithering inside.</p><p>This move consisted of two stages—pull and pounce. With powerful moves, Qian Donglou didn’t act rashly. He countered complexity with simplicity. He made magic with the most basic of moves, illustrating his brilliance.</p><p>This alone proved that he was worthy of the title Warrior Sage.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The air expanded and rushed out fiercely. For a moment, Lou Cheng and the others saw the world darken before their eyes.</p><p>When the light returned, they could see that Qian Donglou’s entire right arm was distorted, bones propping up his skin. The sight gave them goosebumps. On the other hand, Dragon King was shuddering uncontrollably, especially at his right fist.</p><p>The dense, purple flames around his left fist that were sucking at Qian Donglou had dispersed, and his opponent managed to summon his last bit of force.</p><p>The hawk flew back, then charged fiercely. There seemed to be several invisible ropes between the Warrior Sage and Dragon King. In the background, a couple of unmanned drones in charge of broadcasting were affected by the electromagnetic force and heat waves. The drones, either malfunctioning or destroyed, fell to the ground.</p><p>With a pull of the rope, Qian Donglou tensed his body and lowered his hips and shoulders mid-air. Like a meteorite, he crashed into Chen Qitao’s chest.</p><p>Snap!</p><p>The Dragon King withdrew his fist and bulged his chest muscles, igniting a weak flame shield. Even so, he was knocked out of his stance as his joints deformed and his ribcage cracked.</p><p>Bam! He flew backwards, crashing into a utility pole. The pole broke and flew off, dragging along a few cords of power lines.</p><p>Zzzap! The high voltage pierced the air, whipping up an electric arc. A tree of flames with silver flowers formed in the air.</p><p>Having succeeded in his attack, Qian Donglou landed on both feet, then lowered his waist and sprang up once more. Without delay, he arrived beside Chen Qitao at the speed of lightning, almost simultaneous with the sonic boom that followed.</p><p>Such speed was second to only Shunpo!</p><p>The fourth style of theThunder Sect—Rapid Thunder.</p><p>If not for his injuries, the full-power blow from the Warrior Sage would also have been at supersonic speed!</p><p>That was why he was the Warrior Sage. He could learn and master everything quickly, then improve those moves to make them uniquely his! Once he understood one thing, he could infer a hundred more from there!</p><p>His talents made other martial artists born in his era despair.</p><p>Bam! In the sound of the explosion, Qian Donglou’s burnt white robe was shredded even more. With a jolt of his left hand, he changed fist to palm and pressed outwards. The lightning in his palm formed ancient words that masked danger and fearsome intent.</p><p>The fifth style of Thunder Sect—Enlightening Taoist Calligraphy!</p><p>The main function of this move was to paralyze, but it could also convert lightning to balls of thunder, giving explosive potential to the electric attack.</p><p>What’s more terrifying was that it was capable of controlling electricity in nature and the electricity owned by enemies.</p><p>Don’t fight a Shangqing Physical Invulnerability expert under stormy conditions…Don’t fight Shangqing Sect disciples if you are a lightning user or have similar supernatural abilities, unless you are stronger in stage and standard…These were the rules of thumb in the martial arts scene in China. You could even say they were universally understood.</p><p>Before, when Veigar’s stage was nearing Physical Invulnerability and his combat ability was a cut above Peng Leyun, Veigar initiated a sneak attack on him, wanting to prove these rules wrong. In the end, not only was he gravely wounded, but he also helped Peng Leyun make the great leap.</p><p>Bam! Chen Qitao’s face was determined. He didn’t intend to surrender. Even with his ribcage broken, he could still punch out with his right. It was Emperor Yan versus Taoist Calligraphy!</p><p>With a jerk of his shoulder, he used his broken, drooping left arm like a whip. A purple flame blazed forth, silent and dangerous.</p><p>Bam, bam, bam! The Warrior Sage and Dragon King went back and forth. Sometimes the blueish lightning prevailed, sometimes the flames triumphed. Lou Cheng held his breath as he watched.</p><p>The Dragon King’s injury would have been fatal to anyone below Inhuman. Even an Inhuman should have lost the ability to battle. Yet he fought on relentlessly, activating numerous Force Concentrations in a row. His face didn’t show any sign of suffering, as though he had lost the ability to feel pain.</p><p>A few minutes lapsed, and they both reached extreme speed. Once again, they knocked each other back. Chen Qitao crashed through three utility poles before landing outside the designated battlefield.</p><p>Qian Donglou’s hair was unruly, faint smoke rising from it. The wounds on his body were hideous, and purple flames flickered aroud them, charring the skin.</p><p>From afar, the referee raised right hand and shouted at the top of his lungs.</p><p>“The Warrior Sage wins!”</p><p>Chen Qitao inhaled. His face finally showed pain.</p><p>Frowning, he extended his right hand to manually relocate his bones, maximizing the effectiveness of his fearsome Physical Invulnerability level recovery ability.</p><p>Clad in his tattered navy-blue martial arts suit, he turned and walked back erectly. Lou Cheng had stood up at the referee’s announcement. When the Dragon King reached the guest team seating area, he walked up to greet him.</p><p>“Your opponent’s over there,” said Chen Qitao in a low voice, flames flickering in his eyes.</p><p>Eh? Lou Cheng realized that he had subconsciously gone to the side to greet the Dragon King instead of entering the arena to kick off the next round.</p><p>Qian Donglou was still expertly relocating his bones.</p><p>Though this wouldn’t allow him to recover instantly, it would alleviate the pain so that it wouldn’t affect him in the next match.</p><p>Right, I have to hurry so I don’t give the Warrior Sage too long to recover. Lou Cheng lifted his right hand, wanting to high-five the Dragon King before leaving for battle.</p><p>Then again, was it necessary for Physical Invulnerability experts to high-five or fist-bump or cheer each other on? Was it too childish and amateur? I don’t recall seeing such things on TV…</p><p>As Lou Cheng hesitated, Chen Qitao passed him slowly.</p><p>“Defeat him,” he said, his voice low and authoritative.</p><p>“Yes sir!” blurted Lou Cheng. He turned and walked to the center of the arena, carefully avoiding the areas where the utility poles had fallen.</p><p>Qian Donglou’s right arm hung limply. This time, his body wasn’t swaying. He stood there like he was looking at the aftermath of a war with his calm air. He smiled as he waited for his opponent.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s heart raced. This was the man with martial arts talent seen once every one thousand years. This was the man who came closest to the Forbidden Area (not counting the original Forbidden Area ones). This was the terrible Mighty One who traumatized many Physical Invulnerability Mighty Ones.</p><p>The most fearsome thing was that he was only thirty-three, the age when his mind, body, experience, and overall abilities were in top condition.</p><p>This will last for another ten, or even fifteen years. Many more generations of Mighty Ones are bound to live in his shadow. Of course, he could make the breakthrough in a few years and leave the “kids” to play amongst themselves.</p><p>A Mighty One like this forces others to avert their gaze, even when they are severely injured.</p><p>Could I defeat him? Could I really defeat him?</p><p>Lou Cheng felt nervous. His heart was drumming, his body involuntarily shakiing.</p><p>If the Dragon King was his idol, then the Warrior Sage was the ultimate rival in his youthful fantasies.</p><p>Was he finally about to face him?</p><p>This wasn’t like last time in the Master Battle. At that time, he was relaxed, or could at least act like he was. But right now, his palms were sweaty. Sweat beaded on his forehead.</p><p>At that time, it was fine if he lost. But this time, if he lost, Longhu Club might lose the title of “First in China” for the year.</p><p>As that thought occurred to him, Lou Cheng got into position. Visualizing the Ice Heart, he collected his emotions and entered the state of All-Seeing God.</p><p>Qian Donglou glanced at him and smiled. Before the referee raised his hand, he said,</p><p>“It’s a shame that I have to fight you in this sorry state. However, it’s the perfect time to put my original left-handed saber technique to the test.”</p><p>Left-handed saber technique? Don’t you have too much time on your hands? You could have reached the Forbidden Area long ago if you did’t waste so much time creating useless techniques! Lou Cheng couldn’t stop himself from secretly making jabs.</p><p>These light-hearted thoughts made him settle down a little. His opponent no longer seemed like an invincible monster.</p><p>Peng Leyun straightened up. Yan Xiaoling and the others watching the match clenched their fists.</p><p>At that moment, Yan Zheke, who had woken up at midnight to watch the match, Lin Que, who was recuperating at home, and Cai Zongming, who was mocking the commentary, all focused their eyes on the screen.</p><p>The referee raised his right hand.</p><p>“Second round starts now!” he boomed.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s first fight against the Warrior Sage starts now!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
