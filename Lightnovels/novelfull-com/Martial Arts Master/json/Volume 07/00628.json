Lou Cheng didn’t have any differing new ideas and therefore agreed to it without any prerequisites.</p><p>Seeing that she had informed Lou Cheng about the things she needed to, Ning Zitong picked up her office phone and dialled an internal number to ask the supervisor of the Logistics Team to come over. After which, she asked him to lead Lou Cheng to choose a personal room for physical invulnerability members on the fifth floor.</p><p>In comparison to when he was an inhuman, the current room was substantially bigger. It was bigger by a hundred square metres and had a meeting space for official work. The lighting of the room was extremely great and had a side door on the right side of the room. When the side door was open, the corridor connected to the bedroom and study room on the left and right. At the end of it was a room for showering and room with a toilet. The sound-proofing was also great.</p><p>After Lou Cheng had chosen a room where he could see the lake from his bedroom, he noticed the supervisor of the Logistics Team had set up his laptop and started introducing individual bungalows and high-storey mansions to him through the projector. Towards the end of his introduction, he displayed the information of various members of the Assistant Team. As he went through the information, he casually mentioned each individual’s character, hobbies, working capability and other aspects in a detailed manner. Naturally, no one could be absolutely objective. When it came to those who he was more familiar with, on good terms with or those that had asked him for a favor, the supervisor couldn’t help but put in a few good words for them.</p><p>After listening carefully, Lou Cheng leaned back on the sofa and said with a faint smile “Let me think about it for a while. Can you send this information to my inbox?”</p><p>“There wouldn’t be a need for that. I can leave my laptop directly here. Once you’ve made your decision, you can give me a call. Why don’t we add each other on WeChat?” asked the supervisor of the logistic team sincerely.</p><p>“Alright.,” answered Lou Cheng readily as he took out his phone.</p><p>After they added each other, the supervisor added, “You don’t have to be in a hurry. Take some time to think about it. You can even go take a look around. Since you will be moving in, there would be a need to do a deep cleaning. Before that, which five-star hotel will you like us to book for you? Or do you have other other plans?</p><p>“I will just stay here in the meantime. It’s pretty nice here.” Lou Cheng pointed to the bedroom on the left side of the corridor.</p><p>After seeing the supervisor off, he zipped the information about the different accommodation and sent it to Yan Zheke through an offline transfer. After which, he added another message, “[Laughing secretly expression] Which one do you like? It might very well be our home in the future.”</p><p>Once he had decided, the rights to the property would be transferred to his name.</p><p>After sending, he did not expect his little fairy girl to give him a reply anytime soon as it was four o’clock in the morning where she was. He went to read through the conversation records of a few group chats before exchanging some sarcastic words with Cai Zongming.</p><p>At that moment, he noticed that the file that he transferred offline was received. Yan Zheke’s profile pic became clearer with a message, [Hands supporting the chin expression], “If I can’t decide on which property to choose, will you be sleeping under the bridge tonight?”</p><p>“Why are you awake? [Shocked expression]” replied Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Hehe, based on my foresight, I knew that you would have matters that required my input~” answered Yan Zheke triumphantly.</p><p>Lou Cheng didn’t expose her for staying awake just to see the news of him returning to the Longhu club. He played along and expressed his surprise, shock and admiration.</p><p>After the file was completely sent, Yan Zheke looked through it seriously. After which, she exchanged her views with Lou Cheng. In the end, she sent three photos to Lou Cheng.</p><p>“These two bungalows and this high-storey mansion look pretty good. However, I’m not too sure of it as I have not seen it with my own eyes…”</p><p>“No problem. I’ll find some time to go take a look tomorrow. I’ll video chat you at the same time!” answered Lou Cheng decisively.</p><p>Yan Zheke replied, “[Cover mouth while smiling expression] Are you really going to sleep under the bridge tonight?</p><p>“I have a personal resting room.” Lou Cheng stood up and sent a request for a video call. After Yan Zheke accepted, he showed her the bedroom, study room, meeting room and washrooms.</p><p>“Not bad!” laughed Yan Zheke. “In that case, I’ll take a few more days to consider!”</p><p>“Oh right, in that case, help me choose an assistant too. This is the information.” Lou Cheng added and put on the expression that suggested that “the capable Coach Yan should do more”.</p><p>Yan Zheke stared open her eyes widely and said, “You have to bother me with regard to such a small matter?”</p><p>“I’m not familiar with most of them. Even if I know them, the understanding is shallow. Since I do not know who to choose, I might as well believe in the great judgement of Coach Yan! [Laughing evilly expression]” replied Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Since you have asked so sincerely, I should help you choose one~” Yan Zheke unzipped the file and browsed through each piece of information.</p><p>In less than two seconds, he replied, “[Serious face expression] Let’s choose Auman! Let’s just choose her!”</p><p>“Why?” asked Lou Cheng curiously.</p><p>“I only know that guy with the surname Huang and her. As for the rest, they are all similar after I went through their information…” Yan Zheke continued, “[Red smiley expression] Moreover, when you quit the Longhu Club previously, didn’t she send you an encouragement message too? This shows that she’s not the kind who suck up to those below her or looked down upon by those who are above her. She has quite a good personality. When she accompanied me to watch the documentary in the museum, I liked the way she carried herself.”</p><p>Moreover, she knew when to appear and leave too!</p><p>That’s true… Lou Cheng nodded his head slightly before replying, “[Naughty smile expression] I thought you would choose a male assistant.”</p><p>Yan Zheke replied, “[Clenched fist expression] I have confidence in you!”</p><p>After which, she added another line with a [Proud expression], “And I’ve more confidence in myself! I’m a little fairy girl~” Before Lou Cheng could respond, she sent another message, “[Naughty smile expression] If I visit Huacheng and you happen to have additional training or other matters to attend to, I can pull her along to go shopping or others. It would be boring if the assistant is a guy~”</p><p>“That’s true… [Nodding head expression]” replied Lou Cheng.</p><p>Typically, it was inevitable for ordinary people to look for a female assistant while working. As long as he could behave himself, restrict communication to only business and not make any misleading actions, he would not have to be afraid of rumours.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the Assistant Team, all the members, who were fond of going to other offices, were in their seats. This made their office as complete as it ever was.</p><p>They were all pretending to be calm. They were typing furiously on the computer, pretending to communicate with the Cars Team, or staring at the screen while pretending to be in deep thoughts. However, whenever footsteps could be heard approaching, they couldn’t help but straighten their backs and become all tensed up. When they discovered that it wasn’t the supervisor, they would then relax.</p><p>Within the group, Huang Bin lifted his cup and placed it to his mouth. However, he did not have the intention to drink. From time to time, he would turn his head to Auman who had long silky hair drifted over her shoulders. He was highly alert and was clearly worried.</p><p>When Lou Cheng was in the club before, he had the most interactions with her. I’m always a little behind her…</p><p>She is my greatest competitor!</p><p>Luckily, the supervisor of the Logistic Team is from my hometown and I have maintained a good relationship with him. He will definitely put in some good words for me.</p><p>Auman seemed to be acting normally. However, she was deleting what she wrote and rewriting it without any real progress. In her mind, various thoughts were hovering. They could be separated into two kinds and were engaging a debate constantly:</p><p>“Among all the people on the Assistant Team, I’m the one whom Mr. Lou is most familiar with. The chances of him picking me are the highest.”</p><p>“Forget it. This level of familiarity is only on the surface. It couldn’t be compared with the introduction of the supervisor of the Logistic Team. ”</p><p>“No matter what, I haven’t done anything that would irk Mr. Lou. I even consoled him when he was at the lowest point in his life.”</p><p>“Stop dreaming. When will such a great thing ever happen to you?”</p><p>…</p><p>Sun Tingting was the most relaxed among all. However, she was clearly in a very bad mood.</p><p>Over the previous period of time, she believed that Tu Zheng had a higher chance of making the great leap than Lou Cheng and would have achieved it quicker. She had spent all her attention on getting in the good graces of Tu Zheng. Now, she almost had no chance at all of being chosen.</p><p>If I knew this would happen, I would have worked on both sides! She thought agonizingly to herself.</p><p>For the members of the Assistant Team, to be chosen by physical invulnerability experts as their personal assistance were also a great leap forward for them!</p><p>Tick tock tick tock. The clock in the office was moving slowly. Huang Bin and the rest finally heard the familiar footsteps of their supervisor. He was an impatient guy and typically walked very fast. If he had something on, he would even run around!</p><p>All the members straightened their backs once again. Some of them even subconsciously gripped their pens.</p><p>The supervisor of the Assistant Team, Au Yangde, looked around and revealed a rare smile, “Auman, come over for a while. Follow me to see Mr. Lou.”</p><p>Auman’s mind went blank instantly but still stood up immediately by instinct. As for Sun Tingting and the rest, they either slouched at their desk or heaved a sigh. Their disappointment could clearly be seen in their expressions. As for Huang Bin, he even crushed the paper in his hand and threw it to the dustbin beside his desk.</p><p>After several seconds, Auman finally reacted back from it and answered in a hurry, “Alright, right away!”</p><p>As she spoke, she rose out of her seat and quickly ran towards the door. She still felt like she was in a dream until she stood in front of Lou Cheng.</p><p>“I’ll be troubling you in the future.,” greeted Lou Cheng with a faint smile.</p><p>“Alright. No, I mean that’s what you’re supposed to do.,” stammered Auman. However, she recovered her composure quickly and asked directly, “Mr. Lou, is there anything I should pay particular attention to?”</p><p>Lou Cheng thought for a while before answering, “I’m quite a boring person and don’t really like to chat. You have to learn how to entertain yourself.”</p><p>“If there isn’t anything, I won’t disturb you.,” responded Auman in a hurry.</p><p>Lou Cheng nodded his head slightly and continued, “Help me settle the matters regarding the chauffeur of the nanny car. I’m not familiar with any of them. If there isn’t anyone you are satisfied with, inform the Human Resource Team to hire another person. I’ll be staying in the club for the next few days and will message you if I have anything for you.”</p><p>“Alright!” Two familiar faces had started surfacing her mind.</p><p>As she reached the doorstep, she couldn’t help but turned around and thank Lou Cheng several times.</p><p>…</p><p>After confirming the chauffeur, she was ready to leave. Just as she was at the gate and was about to head for the public bus before changing to the train, she saw a silver grey nanny car stopped in front of her. The chauffeur, Zhao Zhenhua lowered the window and said with a smile, “Assistant Auman, let me give you a ride. We will be partners in the future.”</p><p>“I’m fine. What if Mr. Lou wishes to use the car later?” Auman instantly shook her head.</p><p>“I have asked Mr. Lou and he said he wouldn’t be going out tonight. Moreover, I still have to go home right?” answered Zhao Zhenhua with a giggle.</p><p>Auman nodded her head in hesitation before replying, “Alright then.”</p><p>Although there was a traffic jam on the way, yet she still arrived at her accommodation earlier than her usual time and entered her room.</p><p>The room was small and narrow and could only fit a bed, a table and a chair. The cupboard was fitted to the wall itself. She sat on the edge of the bed and was still feeling a little lost. She really still couldn’t believe that she had become the personal assistant of a physical invulnerability expert.</p><p>She looked around subconsciously and recalled many things.</p><p>The starting salary of an employee in Assistant Team at the Longhu Club was four thousand five hundred and the increment each year would be around a few hundred. It wasn’t great but it definitely wasn’t bad. However she was living in Huacheng. Rental, utilities, insurance, retirement and other fixed expenses took up a large portion of her salary. Even so, she had to share a common washroom with others. When her stomach wasn’t feeling well and couldn’t get to the toilet first, it was really miserable. Moreover, she gave her parents a thousand as allowance each month and told them it was to accumulate for her dowry in the future. After buying some skin care products, clothing, and do some online shopping, she didn’t have much left. If it wasn’t for the Club covering her lunch, she would have to be even more frugal.</p><p>And once she became the personal assistant of a physical invulnerability expert, she heard that the base salary alone would be thirty-eight thousand after tax. Moreover, there would be car allowance, meal allowance, clothing allowances and others. She also would receive a bonus based on the physical invulnerability expert that she served at the end of the year. Sometimes, this was the greatest sum of the compensation.</p><p>Auman slowly recovered her senses and had many thoughts welling up in her mind. All she could think was “I want to rent another flat that has a standalone washroom!”</p><p>At this moment, she received a message from the Logistics Team.</p><p>“Auman, Auman! Come and collect the keys to your room tomorrow. The room would be at the side of the Sky Capital Garden and is provided by the Club for you at no cost! It has three bedrooms and a living room and is a little over a hundred square metres!”</p><p>After reading each word carefully, Auman couldn’t help but fall to her side. She hugged her big white teddy bear toy and rolled on her bed. She was feeling refreshed and could see a bright future ahead!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
