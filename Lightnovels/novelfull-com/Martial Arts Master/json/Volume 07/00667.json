She smiled before talking and one wouldn’t be able to tell that she was one of the experimental targets.</p><p>If they had met in a different place, Lou Cheng would definitely be able to sense the creepiness and uniqueness of Number 4, Number 6 till Number 16. However, he would probably see Number 18 as just any other ordinary physical invulnerability expert.</p><p>Perhaps this is the reason why Number 16 believed that she is stronger than him… With his seniors around, although Lou Cheng was filled with rage, he did not act rashly. Instead, he turned his attention to think about other questions to maintain his Ice Heart.</p><p>After hearing what Number 18 had said, the emaciated Ji Jianzhang took a deep look at her before sweeping his gaze at Lin Que. After which, he laughed and said,</p><p>“I have not been travelling around and it seems that everyone in the war-torn area has forgotten about the name of “Heaven Leaning Sword”.”</p><p>“Let’s make an agreement. We will think about how to apologize later and compensate you!”</p><p>As he spoke, his smile slowly disappeared and his tone became colder. When he finished his last word, his fingers were at the edge of his sword.</p><p>Zheng!</p><p>The roar of a dragon shot up and resonated within the entire laboratory. The remaining researchers, who were wearing protective gears, were all covering their ears as they attempted to isolate the buzzing sound around their ears. In an instant, they had sunk into a silent world.</p><p>As the homing sounds of the sword entered the ears, light exploded and thin rays of light shot up light a geyser. After which, they fell and covered Number 18.</p><p>They carried strong attraction forces that made the enemy hard to move around. In fact, the enemy would experience a strong pull towards it as she gotten trapped.</p><p>Yin-yang Magneto-optical Sword!</p><p>The swords cut the body while the magnetic field destroyed the “equipment”!</p><p>This was the most effective way to deal with products of “Artificial weapon project”.</p><p>However, Number 18’s thoughts and responses were the same as any other ordinary physical invulnerability expert. She didn’t seem to be affected at all. When her initial proposal was rejected, she squinted her eyes and one could tell she was hiding her anger. She acted just like any other ordinary person.</p><p>The light in her eyes flickered as she regained her composure instantly. She didn’t try to move forcefully. Instead, she pressed her hands against the edge of the long experiment table, leaned back and moved her right leg in the direction of the attraction force. After which, she swung it up as flashy light gathered to form a blade that slashed towards the core of the “geyser”.</p><p>At the instant, Ji Jianzhang struck, and even when he was talking, Dou Ning had already made preparation. Without the slightest, she pressed ahead, squatted slightly and pierced her shimmering ancient longsword into the ground. Heavy and dull light started spreading.</p><p>The surrounding concrete instantly ruptured as though they had gone through the weathering process for a long time and dried up completely. As for the remaining researchers who were still affected by the humming of the swords, their legs were stuck to the ground as they shivered constantly. Every inch of their skin started drying up as though all their blood and liquid in their body were being sucked away.</p><p>The dull glow threw the gravity over this area to disarray in vary degree. Pulling back Number 18 from the opposite direction, her shaver-like left leg was slowed. It was a perfect coordination with Ji Jianzhang’s attacks as one could easily see the chemistry that they had developed over decades.</p><p>The eighth move of “Fighting” Sect, “Shriveled Devastation. Deathly Barren”!</p><p>This killer move could be separated into three segments. The first stage involved sucking the surrounding moisture which included the floor and the living things on it. Following which would be the simulation of a certain degree of gravity to disrupt and affect the opponent. Towards the end, within a certain designated area, an earthquake would be triggered and energy accumulated would be released. The three transformations could be separated and used individually. The sequence could also be changed as one wished after one gained mastery.</p><p>Dang dang dang!</p><p>The glow of the “Razer Knife” slashed several “raining swords” into pieces and accurately blocked the weapon in Ji Jianzhang’s hands. However, due to the disruption, she was a step slower and missed out on a substantial number of “raining swords”. As a result, the “raining sword” fell incessantly on her.</p><p>If Number 18 hadn’t formed a protecting shield in time to defend against the damage, she would probably be covered in injuries right now.</p><p>Zheng! Dou Ning straightened her back and stood up. Following the momentum, she unsheathed her sword and slashed from the left to the right lightly. However, the pulling force was apparent.</p><p>Beside her, those researchers in protective suit fell to the ground like dominos. Their faces were filled with horror and looked just like specially-made dried corpses.</p><p>Ji Jianzhang shook his wrist and kept the sword around his waist from the left to right. A heavy sensation welled up as though a thousand pounds were weighing down. However, one could clearly feel the pushing force.</p><p>An attraction and a repulsive; A pull and a push. The swordsmanship of the couple was complementary and had completely trapped Number 18 within.</p><p>Lou Cheng stood by the side of the metal bed and didn’t interfere rashly.</p><p>Battles between at the physical invulnerability stage had extraordinary requirements on the use of space and boundaries. If there wasn’t any co-operation training and he tried to help, he would probably end up causing more problems and affect the two seniors’ movements and attacks. The overall impact might be even lower than the sum of the parts.</p><p>Under such a situation, a co-operated attack would be one after another as they take turns to attack the enemy. It would be similar to Lou Cheng’s experience when he worked with Ren Li. It’s a pity that the old couple had roamed the world together for many years. Their chemistry was so perfect that didn’t provide anyone with a chance to interfere.</p><p>I feel just like an additional spectator… As the thought flashed passed Lou Cheng’s mind, he hadn’t let down his guard yet.</p><p>Number 18 had appeared but what about Number 17?</p><p>Where’s Number 17, whom Number 16, believed was stronger than him?</p><p>Is he also in the base? After hearing the commotion, perhaps he is on his way here or perhaps he is hiding in some corner while waiting for an opportunity to deal a killer blow in a strike?</p><p>With such consideration in his mind, Lou Cheng had completely given up the thought of attacking Number 18 too.</p><p>As he defended against the shockwaves caused by the battle between physical invulnerability experts and prevented Lin Que, who had lost mobility, from suffering collateral damages, he used his Ice Heart to reflect the surrounding while also examined the condition of cousin-in-law.</p><p>Lin Que’s agony started to tone down and her blurry eyes reflected the figure of Lou Cheng.</p><p>He was shocked for a full two seconds before remembering Lou Cheng. His tensed up muscles relaxed instantly and his eyelids drooped as he tried to hide his helplessness.</p><p>When he re-opened his eyes, his emotions had settled down. Deep in his eyes, two bright spots surfaced once again.</p><p>That dried up lips moved with difficulty and his Adam’s apple moved several times. However, he couldn’t make any sound. Nonetheless, from the shape of his mouth, he was clearly trying to say,</p><p>“Thank… you…”</p><p>Emotions welled up in Lou Cheng when he saw this scene. He quickly looked for ways to disengage the various equipment. He didn’t specialize in these sorts of things and didn’t dare to act rashly at the moment. He was afraid if he pulled out certain vital equipment, the condition of cousin-in-law would plunge.</p><p>He glanced at the area behind him and looked at the few researchers that had been frozen into ice sculptures. Pressing down with his right hand, he made an eternal Ice Wall to withstand the shockwaves from the battle between physical invulnerability expert.</p><p>Leaping up, Lou Cheng reached the researcher who looked like the leader of the group. With faint purple flames on his left hand, he placed it on the shoulder of the other party.</p><p>Drip drip drip drip! The layer of ice melted and that researcher looked pale while shivering. However, what awaited him wasn’t caring words but simplified “Army” Formula.</p><p>The researcher collapsed instantly. He was forcefully dragged to the side of the metal bed for a “consultation”. He truly didn’t dare to lie or keep back his words.</p><p>After pressing and pulling the equipment, Lou Cheng quickly dismantled the equipment on Lin Que’s body.</p><p>When he just completed his action, he felt a shocking feeling. He turned his body around and looked towards the door.</p><p>A human figure approached at a speed that left afterimages. After sensing Lou Cheng’s gaze, he stopped.</p><p>He had blonde hair that split neatly in the middle. His eyes seemed to be burning and appeared red. He was wearing a white T-shirt with the number “17” printed on it with a black jacket. His hands were covered in flaming snakes but he wasn’t harmed in any way.</p><p>17 is here… Lou Cheng felt a sense of relief but also more worries.</p><p>This experiment lab wasn’t small but definitely couldn’t be considered as big. If he had to take care of cousin-in-law who had lost his ability to defend himself, he would definitely not be able to fully move around. From the looks of Number 17, he wasn’t someone that could be easily dealt with…</p><p>As thoughts flashed quickly in his mind, Lou Cheng made his decision. He leaned back suddenly, pressed down with his palm and sealed Lin Que within layers of crystals while leaving some holes for him to breathe.</p><p>In this case, as long as Yan Zheke’s grandparents could quickly finish Number 18 off, the impact to cousin-in-law would be within their control.</p><p>He had to balance the potential damages of both sides and chose the one that would result in the least harm!</p><p>As Lou Cheng moved, Number 17 also moved. He lowered his back into a posture like a hunting leopard Leaping over, he clenched his fist tightly, placed them beside his body that was shrouded in flames.</p><p>After pressing, Lou Cheng charged ahead while setting his right fist ablaze with faint purple flames.</p><p>The anger in him was controlled using the “All Seeing God” realm while leaking a small amount out to fan the flames of “Lord Emperor’s Purple Flame”!</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Their fists collided and explosions erupted. The researchers who were lying around helpless were sent flying as they crashed violently on the wall. Their bones cracked as they spilled out blood.</p><p>For these people, who captured innocent people for experiments, Lou Cheng had no feelings of compassion for them. In fact, he even wanted to eliminate them with a huge fire!</p><p>Faint purple and metal red sputtered and set part of the equipment ablaze. The smoke detectors were triggered and the newest extinguishing material rained down.</p><p>Amidst the smoke and flames, Number 17 and Lou Cheng pulled back their punches at the same time. One of them swung his left shoulder back, pushed his right shoulder ahead and smashed across with his elbow. The other retracted his right punch and threw out his left punch that was still covered in faint purple flames.</p><p>In an instant, Lou Cheng relaxed his clenched fist. Extending his five fingers out, he firmly grabbed onto the joints in Number 17.</p><p>Number 17’s elbow instantly sank. Shaking his forearm, he used the momentum and threw out a punch. Golden red flames rotated and welled out accordingly.</p><p>Just as he made his movements, Lou Cheng suddenly pressed onto the elbows joints to dissipate the punching force of his enemy. His opponent retreated several steps as the purple flames flowed over.</p><p>At the same time, Lou Cheng tilted his head slightly to avoid the majority of the golden red flames. As for the small remaining amount, it wasn’t able to leave any charcoal marks.</p><p>Number 17 shook his forearm and made the purple flame fell off gently. The flame softened the floor and left a black mark.</p><p>Both parties were experts of controlling fire!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
