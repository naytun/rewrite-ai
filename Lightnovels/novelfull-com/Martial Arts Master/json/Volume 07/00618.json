It was just like a reflection of the Heaven on earth.</p><p>Within the Holy Light Kingdom, Constantine, who was wearing a tattered tuxedo and dirty white shirt, suddenly disappeared. A short moment later, he creepily appeared to the side of Lou Cheng. He clenched his fist tightly and smashed towards the side of Lou Cheng’s face with a straight punch.</p><p>The supernatural ability of the “Savior”, “Flash”!</p><p>With the change in Constantine’s position, the area where the holy light also shifted!</p><p>Lou Cheng’s “Ice Mirror” clearly reflected his surroundings to him. When Constantine suddenly appeared, he noticed him instantly. Pulling back his body, which was facing sideways to Constantine, turned and faced him directly. After avoiding the attack of his enemy, he struck out his punch from his waist towards Constantine’s abdomen. He hid Emperor Yan Force within his punch, restraining it from exploding and giving him room to make changes. Ren Li who was just a short distance away took a step forward. After which, she wasn’t in a hurry to turn her body. Swinging her arm and slashing her sword in the opposite direction, she sent a thin but sharp green blade towards the neck of Constantine.</p><p>Despite facing a pincer attack from both sides, Constantine did not adopt any defensive moves! His joints cracked and his arm bent like a snake. Shifting his punch that Lou Cheng had avoided, he hit towards his opponent’s head.</p><p>Seeing this, the scene from before flashed passed Lou Cheng’s mind suddenly. While being enveloped by the milky white light, Sathah suffered a creepy explosion at the same position where he landed a fireball on Constantine.</p><p>Without further analysis and not considering the cause and effects, Lou Cheng relied on his innate battle senses and made a decision instantly. He ignited the Emperor Yan Force in his wrist and propelled his fist upwards towards Constantine’s right arm. The milky white light swayed and flickered as Constantine’s punch deviated from its trajectory.</p><p>At the same instant, a mysterious air flow exploded and Lou Cheng felt pain surging in his right forearm. He almost lost his defensive stance as a result of this!</p><p>Indeed! By now, Lou Cheng already understood the situation.</p><p>At this moment, the green wind blade from Ren Li had also hit Constantine in the neck, split the milky white light apart and made Constantine tilted his head subconsciously.</p><p>Swoosh! A thin blade appeared out of nowhere, split the defensive winds around Ren Li and left a deep cut on Ren Li’s white and fair neck. Fresh blood instantly gushed out. Ren Li immediately wriggled her muscles to seal the opening, leaving behind a hideous looking scar.</p><p>Failing to connect on his attack, Constantine disappeared immediately, appeared behind Ren Li and swung a straight punch towards his opponent’s spine. His fist was covered by a layer of creepy red light and appeared to be poisonous.</p><p>Ren Li didn’t flinch and only tilted her body slightly. Pulling her arm back, she quickly crashed the hilt of her sword onto his fist like a hammer.</p><p>Constantine was shocked for a moment but disappeared instantly. As for Ren Li, she felt excruciating pain through her fingers and almost lost control over her long sword.</p><p>Pa pa pa! Constantine kept flashing around in different areas. It was as though he had split into two and was fighting with Lou Cheng and Ren Li at the same time. This was to prevent them from having an opportunity to attack him at the same time. In addition, every punch and claw of his had the power of “Darkness” and “Venom Blood”. These invaded his the two and brought upon various persistent negative impacts. If it wasn’t because of the fact that Lou Cheng’s Emperor Yan and Ren Li’s Plague Sect’s were resistant to these attacks and the ability of Force Concentration to neutralize the negative impacts, they would probably be suppressed by Constantine alone. Even so, considering the terrifying and creepy “reflection”, the two of them felt a little helpless.</p><p>Ssk ssk ssk! Ren Li Looked around and noticed that the milky white light was melting the accumulated snow rapidly. Moreover, her “Hidden Scent”, which she had been releasing secretly, had been completely neutralised.</p><p>Bam bam bam! Lou Cheng focused on defending and managed to withstand the crazy barrage of attacks from his opponent.</p><p>He had initially thought of spreading flames around and triggering “Rain of Fire” to accelerate the disappearance of “Holy Light Kingdom”. From his observation of the previous battle between Constantine and Sathah, a territory like this could be affected by external forces and wouldn’t last long. However, after exchanging a few blows, he acutely noticed that the fighting skills of the Dark Night Bat weren’t outstanding at all!</p><p>He seemed to be more reliant on his different types of supernatural abilities. In less than thirty seconds of battle, he had used over six types. As for his fighting skills, it was at the standards of one who had just reached the Dan stage. He might be well-versed in his abilities but his skills weren’t strong. Also, he might have studied them and had some practice, but he had definitely not spent the majority of his attention on it.</p><p>As the thought flashed passed his mind, Lou Cheng raised his forearms to form a guard as Constantine’s palm struck towards him.</p><p>As the two of them were about to collide, Lou Cheng suddenly released his hidden Emperor Yan Force that propelled his forearms upwards. After which, he extended his five fingers and grabbed Constantine by the wrist after breaking through the thin layer of milky white light to complete his capture.</p><p>Lou Cheng could feel that his other hand was stopped by something. However, this didn’t affect him. He relaxed his other hand, moved it like a preying snake, grabbed onto Constantine’s joints and successfully restricted Constantine’s “Flash” temporarily.</p><p>While executing big and open moves, the shortcomings of Constantine weren’t that obvious. However, once he was in close combat fight, they were completely exposed!</p><p>At this moment, Ren Li stomped her legs, changed her direction and darted towards Constantine’s side with her sword. At the same time, she made visualization in her mind.</p><p>In the split moment before striking the milky white light, she suddenly changed her piercing move to a flick. With the blade as the lever, she flicked Constantine up violently.</p><p>Phew!</p><p>Green winds erupted from his feet before turning into a tornado that enshrouded him and lifted him to the skies. As for Lou Cheng, he released his grip in time and wasn’t affected.</p><p>Wind Sect’s tenth move, “Nine Heavens’ Breath”!</p><p>Ren Li was still affected by the endless hurricane and was drifting uncontrollably. Lou Cheng bent his back and became almost parallel to the ground.</p><p>As the power of “Nine Heavens’ Breath” raged in Constantine’s body and restricted his ability to move freely in his “Holy Light Kingdom”, he could only stand still and watch his body rising to the skies. As for Lou Cheng’s prepared attack, he wasn’t worried at all. This was because he was still covered by that milky white light and “The one who hurts would be hurt”. Moreover, he had an extremely strong recovery ability!</p><p>Exchanges of blows? Not a problem!</p><p>As dull red light shimmered Constantine’s eyes, Lou Cheng opened his. He straightened his back violently and raised both of his arms.</p><p>He was surrounded by a reflection of the universe. The darkness was mainly comprised of a chilling cold but was decorated with scorching hot spots. Following the direction of his arm, this scene shot out and darted into the “Holy Light Kingdom”, enshrouding Constantine.</p><p>The combination of Cultivation and the path of martial arts, “Cosmic Universe”!</p><p>In an instant, the milky white light was completely frozen. It was as though it had turned into a coffin made of ice with Constantine frozen in it!</p><p>He really dares to? Just as Constantine was struck with fear, countless stars started collapsing inwards and clobbered the “Ice Coffin”. They were striking from all directions without any signs of stopping!</p><p>Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!</p><p>Flames erupted in mid-air as the scorching bluish-white fireworks bloomed and swallowed the “Holy Light Kingdom”.</p><p>Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!</p><p>Lou Cheng seemed to have been frozen to the ground and found it hard to make other moves. Nonetheless, the surrounding air ignited by itself and shot out fireballs out of thin air like cannons to Constantine and caused endless explosions.</p><p>Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!</p><p>The shockwave from the impact propagated outwards with the raging flames. Lou Cheng enshrouded himself in a layer of “Ice Armor” and rushed in without any reserve. Layers of ice crystals were replaced by others as they melted.</p><p>At this moment, Ren Li landed on both of her legs. Swinging her long sword, she created a strong wind and blew away several fireballs.</p><p>Feeling that his “Ice Spirit Force” was close to depletion, Lou Cheng stomped and darted out of the thick smoke. There were many burnt spots on him and he had suffered a certain degree of injury.</p><p>As for Constantine, the milky white light around him had completely disappeared and he no longer felt holy and sacred. His tuxedo and dark red cape had completely turned into shreds and drifted downwards. Several spots on his head were still burning.</p><p>He stood on the ground with his specially made leather shoes completely cracked and broken. There weren’t many injuries on him and the decrease in his aura wasn’t apparent.</p><p>At this very moment, he was no longer the “Savior”.</p><p>Squinting his eyes, Constantine leapt forward. He avoided Ren Li and pounced towards the tired Lou Cheng. He aimed to eliminate or seriously injure one of them first. This was because when it became one on one, it would be much easier for him no matter if he chose to fight or escape!</p><p>At this moment, Lou Cheng raised both of his hands, pointed to himself before letting out a low moan, “Wholeness!”</p><p>In a short instant, Lou Cheng had regained his vitality. He was full of spirit and his Ice Spirit Force was replenished. Other than some lingering injuries, one couldn’t tell that he had just undergone an intense battle!</p><p>Seeing Constantine approaching him, he rapidly retracted his breathing and blood flow and kept them below the universe below his abdomen. After which, he shifted the stars and trace out the “Fighting” Formula.</p><p>Suddenly, Lou Cheng’s muscles expanded exaggeratedly. Strips of nerves were revealed and moved like dragons within his muscles.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>He swung his fist towards Constantine, bringing with it a hurricane that put out the surrounding flames.</p><p>This… Constantine knew that Lou Cheng was apt in the Nine Words Formula but had not expected that it could be used in such a way!</p><p>The shadow from the fist in front of him grew larger and larger. It was as though he had encountered a real giant recorded in the legends.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
