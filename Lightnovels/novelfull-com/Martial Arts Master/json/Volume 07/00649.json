He was a quarter Russian, had chiseled features, and a contoured face. Quite handsome. His eyes contained a faint shade of emerald.</p><p>Since thirty, he had adopted and maintained slicked-back hair, which made him look a few years older, but gave him the air of a gangster boss.</p><p>Lu Yongyuan was molded in the martial arts school scheme of the Yanzhao League. He was only one year younger than Dong Baxian. At that period, they were arch-rivals, just like Peng Leyun and Ren Li in their first two years in the University martial arts scene, but less well-known.</p><p>He made it to the Dan Stage at an early age, and left his alma mater at the invitation of Guanwai League, which was situated in his hometown. Had he become a nobody afterward. No one would have remembered him or slandered him. But he grew stronger and stronger, day after day. And so did the detest and hate towards him from the Yanzhao League supporters. They deemed him as a traitor, a traitor who bit the hand that fed him. Had he stayed in the Yanzhao League, teaming up with Dong Baxian and other First Pin Mighty Ones—like Lin Shuyao—the current Yanzhao League would have been able to rival Longhu, Shangqing, and Daxing.</p><p>These never bothered Lu Yongyuan. He even said during an interview that criticism would only make him stronger.</p><p>And he wasn’t lying. He was the type of martial artist that performed better on grander stages. It was as if he temporarily gained strength when fighting against strong enemies. He had once turned the tables on Warrior Sage and Dragon King when they were at their peak forms. It made a good tale, earning him his nickname of “God-slaying Saber”.</p><p>However, he also had another nickname—Mad Swordsman. It came about since he was always unspirited and unfocused whenever he fought against opponents who were at the same stage but much weaker than him. It got so bad that he became the titled-level expert with the most losses against weaker opponents.</p><p>As a result, he only recieved two titles in total, which didn’t include “Warrior Sage” or “The King”.</p><p>Nonetheless, he was one of the most prominent fighters at the moment!</p><p>…</p><p>In the hotel where the Guanwai League members were resided. Lu Yongyuan, with his slicked-back hair, was laid on a recliner on the balcony. Outside the window, the dark night was brightened by neon and lights, like a reflection of the stars.</p><p>Eyes closed, his right hand gently tapped on the hunter-green saber sheath beside him, within which rested the fabled God-slaying Saber. The saber seemed to be in a deep slumber, awaiting its next battle.</p><p>In the living room, a door away from the balcony, the lot-drawing for Top 32 was being broadcasted on the large screen TV. The volume was turned low, almost inaudible.</p><p>When his name was called, there was a brief pause in his tapping.</p><p>He didn’t open his eyes. After the momentary pause, he resumed tapping on the hunter-green saber sheath at a slow, melodious rhythm.</p><p>The foggy autumn rain pitter-pattered against the window, complementing the atmosphere inside.</p><p>Amid the peace and tranquility, a soft, silvery clatter sounded from within the hunter-green saber sheath, as if the saber inside was celebrating.</p><p>The clatter unified into one beat, like a dragon’s roar from the depth of the ocean.</p><p>…</p><p>Many posts popped up in Lou Cheng’s Fan Club forum right after the results of the lot-drawing was released.</p><p>“A titled-Mighty One…how can he win against that?…[hides face and sighs]” wrote “All The Good Names Are Taken By Dogs”.</p><p>“Can’t be helped. The Top 32 of every title tournament is always mostly composed of the strongest fighters and only a handful of extremely lucky, relatively average Physical Invulnerability Experts. Seems like Lou Cheng’s out of luck. It doesn’t matter who he’s against once he fails to get the ones like Ren Li. It’s on neutral ground, so no one has terrain advantage anyway,” wrote “A Plumber Eating Mushrooms”.</p><p>“If I remember correctly, this Lu something often loses against weaker opponents. Plus, he injured himself badly after the tough win against Liang Yifan during the fifth round, so it’s not like my idol doesn’t stand a chance, right?” wrote Yan Xiaoling.</p><p>“An injury at that level is nothing to a Physical Invulnerability Expert. He’ll only need a few days to recover from it. I wouldn’t be betting on it if I were you,” wrote “Road to The Arena”, mercilessly crushing Yan Xiaoling’s fantasies.</p><p>“Had the God Slaying Saber not been injured, he might approach the fight with his usual overconfidence and potentially lose to Lou Cheng. However, now that he’s injured, he’ll take extra caution, making it next to impossible for Lou Cheng to win.” wrote “Unparalleled Dragon King” with a tears of joy emote.</p><p>“So having an injured opponent can be a bad thing…” wrote “Nie Qiqi”. Such an explanation has never occurred to her.</p><p>“He’s against a titled Mighty One. It’s best for you to savor the battle and not focus on the outcome. [funny face]” wrote “Tang Chuxia”, a new guy on the forum.</p><p>He was a master at trash-talking. Once obsessed with cultivation, his training led to him contract hysteria, and for days he would scream at the top of his lungs that doomsday was coming. Later, he was involved in a car accident that almost cost his life. Since then, he returned back to normal, picking up his old hobby once more. Lou Cheng’s fighting style reminded him of the cultivation of his dreams, turning him into a fan.</p><p>Seeing their replies, Yan Xiaoling replied with a sad emoji with a caption of “I’m fine”.</p><p>“I’ll bet 10 dollars on my idol!”</p><p>“Huh? Shouldn’t you be putting your money on Lu Yongyuan? If Lou Cheng wins, you’ll be happy, and if he loses, you’ll be 10 bucks richer. [puzzled]” wrote “Okamoto’s Fan”.</p><p>“It’s a form of prayer, get it? Prayer! P-r-a-y-e-r! [contempt]” wrote Yan Xiaoling.</p><p>“Count me in! I bet twenty!” wrote “Brahman”.</p><p>The lot-drawing was still underway. The match-ups involving Mighty Ones made the audience all pumped up, wishing that the day of the fight would come sooner.</p><p>“Kongtong School, Ren Li!” The old Priest with silver-streaked dark hair read out a new name.</p><p>A few seconds later, he found Ren Li’s opponent.</p><p>“Shizhou Island, Shang Youde!”</p><p>Lion King, Shang Youde!</p><p>Normally, the guest would only read one’s name and organization during lot-drawing. However, as a form of respect, they had to announce the titles of martial artists who currently held titles. The same applied for special titles such as Living Buddha.</p><p>When it comes to the likes of the Dragon King and Warrior Sage, who often held two to three titles simultaneously, the guest would pick the title holder’s favourite title—A martial artist who had received “The King” more than three times will permanently be addressed as The King. Since Qian Donglou always hogged the Warrior Sage title, it became associated with his name for many years. Eventually, it became his nickname.</p><p>Lou Cheng chatted idly with Yan Zheke about the God Slaying Saber. When he heard the announcement, he immediately went into the group chat and tagged Ren Li.</p><p>“Looks like it’s your turn to treat!”</p><p>They were both up against titled Mighty Ones, which was most likely going to mark the end of their journeys, so technically they would be eliminated in the same round. However, since Ren Li’s match was the latter, she would fit the bill of “lasting longer”.</p><p>“I think so too…” assented Peng Leyun, who was eliminated by Wisdom King.</p><p>“Hm? In a good mood, aren’t we, Priest?” said Lou Cheng provokingly.</p><p>“Speak for yourself,” replied Peng Leyun.</p><p>Dumb*ss Husky getting all pumped up after drawing into God Slaying Saber…</p><p>The main focus in tough matches, like this one, was to find one’s own problems and get a feel of the gap between them and their opponent! They win as long as they take away something!</p><p>That’s when Ren Li popped up.</p><p>“Don’t be scared, the God Slaying Saber loses frequently!”</p><p>Encouragements are fine, but somehow it sounds like Ren Li’s trying to pick a fight… In other words, she’s telling him not to chicken out… The corner of Lou Cheng’s mouth twitched as he replied with a dry smile.</p><p>After being sidetracked, he organized his thoughts, calmed down, and tried to get himself into a better mood. He sent Auman to request footage of Lu Yongyuan’s fights from the Longhu Club.</p><p>…</p><p>One day later at noon, on the tournament grounds of Jiangxin Island. The sun, dangling in the sky, heated the ground to a burning temperature. The river flowed east. It was extremely humid.</p><p>Lou Cheng stood at the front of the cruise ship gazing at the reclaimed land.</p><p>That’s when he received a message from Yan Zheke.</p><p>“Is this your first time fighting against an armed enemy since attaining Physical Invulnerability? [snickering]”</p><p>Before attaining Physical Invulnerability, he had once traded blows with Tang Zexun.</p><p>“Only if modern firearms aren’t included… I think I probably faced armed enemies while we were in Nile…[snickering]” replied Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Ugh, play along, will you! [eyes dripping with contempt]” replied Yan Zheke.</p><p>They shot the breeze for a while. Raising his head, Lou Cheng saw the referee appearing. He dipped his head with a smile, replying, “I’m up.”</p><p>After that, he locked his phone and passed it to Auman. He leaped gently and landed at one end of the skiff.</p><p>Waves parted as the boat advanced slowly. Right as he reached Jiangxin Island, he could see an approaching figure enlarging gradually.</p><p>He stood before the azure water and sky that seemed to have merged as one. As though he could absorb light, the afternoon radiance around him seemed to dim slightly.</p><p>Step by step, the chiseled-faced Lu Yongyuan marched on, like an envoy that brought eternal night.</p><p>In his right hand was a long saber. The hunter-green saber sheath was quiet and reserved, but Lou Cheng’s heart raced at the sight of it. He sensed an evil dragon sealed within it. A dragon that was about to break free and feast.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
