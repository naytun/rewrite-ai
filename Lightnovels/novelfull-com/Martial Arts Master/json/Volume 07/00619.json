Pushing his right foot into the ground, he punched out with both fists to block Lou Cheng’s iron hammerfist. The brutal strength made his muscles and fascias tremor like guitar strings. He couldn’t get the loud buzz out of his head.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Where they connected, the air currents blasted apart, sending passages of white waves outwards. Constantine felt like a pyramid with his fist being the tip of it. Under Lou Cheng’s horrifying strength, the impact quickly shifted from one point to spreading across the whole of it, causing the whole structure to disintegrate and collapse.</p><p>Constantine didn’t dare to resist. Lowering his arms, he floated backward as though he was sent flying. However, the push from the air swarming around him allowed him to be out of Lou Cheng’s reach as the later gave chase!</p><p>If it had been a one-on-one, his supernatural ability would have gotten him out scot-free from Lou Cheng’s follow up attacks. Then he could turn the tides. However, he wasn’t against one person. A sudden pain penetrated his back. The pain spread across his spine, causing his skin to horripilate.</p><p>Ren Li, weaving her sword, had stabbed his hips. The strike was quick but silent.</p><p>The gleam in Constantine’s eyes condensed. A sanguine light sprung up around him. He managed to stop his backward inertia at once in an eerie, physics-defying manner.</p><p>Bam! Releasing all his stored up energy, he swerved and avoided Ren Li’s lethal sword strike.</p><p>However, in that moment of delay, Lou Cheng had closed in once more. Concentrating his Qi and blood, he visualized a Fighting Formula formed from stars!</p><p>Bam!</p><p>He grew above two-meters, muscle-bound with bulging, blue-black veins. He looked very much like an ancient giant from the depths of Hell. Jerking his shoulder and clenching his fist, he dealt a hammerfist!</p><p>The shadow enlarged in Constantine’s eyes. He drew a sharp breath, letting the air inflate him like a balloon. He went over two meters and was a few times more muscular.</p><p>His white shirt and casual long pants, not as flexible as a martial arts suit, ripped at once, revealing his pale-green skin and incredible muscles.</p><p>He had stolen the ability from one of his victims. He named it “The Hulk!”</p><p>Swinging his arms like a baseball bat, he struck at Lou Cheng.</p><p>The fists from the two veiny, muscular giants collided, stirring up a whirlwind and producing a thunderous explosion.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Lou Cheng’s arm recoiled and took a step back. He was back to his 1.8-meter appearance. Constantine, took multiple steps, leaving two vivid, gigantic footprints in the ground. His body began to shrink.</p><p>At that time, Ren Li struck again. There was a green flash from her sword. She chopped straight down, wanting to split her opponent in two!</p><p>Learning from the pincer experience from earlier, she didn’t strike together with Lou Cheng. Instead, they adopted a tag-team approach so Constantine couldn’t stop them both with one supernatural ability and make a run. The goal was to not give him a chance for a breather!</p><p>With the remaining power from the Hulk ability, Constantine slapped at the side of the green blade. Ren Li’s longsword curved to the side, nearly falling out of her hands.</p><p>However, Ren Li’s straight chop was merely a blind. Her killer move was her kicks. She kicked out continuously, spreading the impact across a small region, creating two sharp but thin wind blades that cut towards her enemy’s solar plexus.</p><p>Pompf, pompf! It left two hideous, gaping wounds on Constantine’s abdomen. Like a balloon leaking, he reverted to his original size.</p><p>Before he could grab at Ren Li, she had retreated using the wind. Lou Cheng stepped forward once more, using Force Concentration to activate another Fighting Formula!</p><p>Bam, bam, bam! His defined muscles bulged, producing a loud boom. His martial arts suit clung tightly to his body, accentuating his manly and muscular body.</p><p>Seeing his enemy transforming into a giant once more and punching at him, Constantine gnashed his teeth. A tumbling, glowing black gas sprang up around him, turning everything sticky.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Lou Cheng’s punch caught his opponent in the forearm. The savage force shattered the dark-glowing black gas around him, reducing it to fluttering butterflies.</p><p>Reducing the impact and mitigating the damage with Reassembling Night!</p><p>The dark glow and black mist scattered at once. Constantine’s face turned awfully pale, his body lost existence and went with the wind like a mirage.</p><p>Ren Li, with her Wind Steps, chased forward before the countless vampiric bats could reassemble. She leaped into the air, turning mid-air so her body was upside-down!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The wind’s howling grew louder. A shining sword light swirled, forming a tornado that spread towards Constantine.</p><p>The 12th Style of the Wind Sect—Heaven’s Burial!</p><p>The tornado intensified, the sharp intent increased. The sword’s intent penetrated Constantine’s mind, giving him a stinging headache. He let out an angry roar, calling the bats to hasten their return.</p><p>Slash, slash, slash, slash, slash!</p><p>The loud sound of cutting through flesh came almost at the same beat. The black, crimson-glowing bats that were caught into it were immediately blended to dark drops and black mists. They vanished.</p><p>When the wind had stopped and the light was gone, Ren Li’s figure appeared. Sword in hand, she did an air somersault four inches above Constantine, landing steadily behind her enemy.</p><p>Constantine, head buried in arms, had a blank, unfocused look in his eyes.</p><p>Before Lou Cheng could attack again, an even cut formed on the surface of his skin. After that, a loud howling of wind erupted, shredding his body to pieces.</p><p>Constantine’s arms were cut into five pieces, his body in countless pieces. Only his legs were somewhat unharmed. Along with his innards, they flew and landed in every direction.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Constantine’s head was the last to touch the ground. It wasn’t heavily damaged due to his protection, but life faded from his eyes, leaving only lingering regret and confusion.</p><p>“Whew, what a tough opponent,” praised Ren Li, sheathing her sword.</p><p>The Dark Night Bat was not only powerful but also had many tricks up his sleeves. They almost let him, who was at the same stage, escape even when they were working together.</p><p>“Let’s leave this place first. That military officer might turn back if he hears something,” suggested Lou Cheng, looking around.</p><p>“Okay!” Ren Li, fairly fatigued too, lost interest in going to the military base. She left the place with Lou Cheng. They went to the North of the City, to the highway entrance towards Deeka.</p><p>Ren Li, looking at the sky, said, “I’ll be meeting with Priest in Deeka, so I won’t be there for long. I’ll consider going back to the wartorn zones after mastering the Wind Sect’s Physical Invulnerability Chapters. Or, I might go for the National Title right away.”</p><p>“Mhm. We haven’t mastered our respective Physical Invulnerability Chapters, so there’s a stark difference when we are against opponents of the same league.”</p><p>If he didn’t rely on Cosmic Phantom, a quasi-Physical Invulnerability secret art he derived after making the breakthrough, he couldn’t have taken down either Dark Night Bat or the Mummy for certain.</p><p>Lou Cheng went on. “I won’t be going to Deeka. I’ll head to Fartouat to get some information on my Brother-in-law Lin Que. I need to know where he was last seen, then decide whether I’m heading into the wartorn zones.”</p><p>If possible, he wanted to have Master grant him the Ice Sect Physical Invulnerability Chapters. After grasping the basic concepts, he will dive deep in the wartorn-zones to find him.</p><p>“Okay, I’ll be off then,” smiled Ren Li. She waved handsomely, then confidently bolted South for Khukhang.</p><p>Mouthing twitching, Lou Cheng quickly halted her to point her the right direction.</p><p>When Ren Li was far gone, he pondered, then returned to Khukhang and took shortcuts to the place where they battled Lou Cheng.</p><p>When the Dark Night Bat died, Lou Cheng didn’t felt relieved. Instead, he felt a vague, lingering danger premonition. Hence, he decided to visit the battlefield once more for a careful inspection. He also wanted to preserve a piece of Constantine’s flesh with his ice powers for the military’s research.</p><p>…</p><p>Back where the Physical Invulnerability Mighty Ones once battled. There was gunpowder smoke. The floor was littered with pieces of the corpse. In the surrounding area, some flames burned faintly. All was quiet, like an oil painting.</p><p>A few minutes later, Constantine’s head suddenly moved. A crimson light filled his eyes as life returned to him.</p><p>He spat out a thin, scarlet mist that shrouded the area around him. Pieces of flesh, wriggling creepily, slowly returned and reassembled!</p><p>When he failed to heavily wound his enemy with Holy Light Kingdom, Constantine already knew he couldn’t escape using usual methods. So, without making unnecessary attempts, he set up the stage to perform the Savior’s last, and most unusual ability. It was the last resort for him to escape his predicament.</p><p>Revival!</p><p>As long as his head wasn’t shattered and his flesh and blood were available, he could revive!</p><p>For that, he acted as though he was in a rough spot, sometimes haughty and sometimes shocked.</p><p>After ten minutes, the bloody Constantine finally stood up. All his incision marks remained, making him look like Frankenstein.</p><p>He was at his weakest state, so his self-regenerative abilities weren’t sufficient to heal himself.</p><p>“You’ll pay for this!” he said resentfully, hobbling away.</p><p>Right now, he was very weak, so he didn’t want to take any risks or run into Amon who might be attracted to the noises.</p><p>That was when he felt something. Looking north, he stared right into the eyes of a confused Lou Cheng.</p><p>Blank stares.</p><p>“No!!!” yelled Constantine, attempting to escape with unsteady steps.</p><p>Why did he come back!</p><p>With an Attainment Formula, Lou Cheng raised wind and rushed forward. Jerking his left arm, he punched at his creepy enemy’s face.</p><p>Constantine raised both fists to block, but his hands were knocked away by Lou Cheng’s right fist. Surrounded by a dense and white-hot flame, it landed on his nose.</p><p>Snap!</p><p>His nose bridge caved inwards. His deformed face then cracked, his eyes filled with terror and despair.</p><p>After that, the white-hot flames exploded.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Countless pieces, stained in red and white, sprayed everywhere, painting a beautiful abstract oil painting.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
