Do you want to become an enemy of ours?”</p><p>“I’m asking you why, not the others,” replied Lou Cheng calmly.</p><p>He didn’t want to waste any more time and naturally started to summon the sharp and terrifying Fighting formula.</p><p>After enduring his cold, chilling stare, the girl, who had undergone severe training, collapsed. It was as though she could smell death approaching. It was horrifying and fearful.</p><p>Tears and snot began flowing uncontrollably as her body shivered in fear.</p><p>“I’ll say it. I’ll tell you everything!”</p><p>“Ji Kang is a broker of Tignes City’s black market. He, he took a batch of goods from our organization and was thinking of escaping to another place. He was found out by the organization and the organization sent me to settle him. All I have said is the truth. Don’t kill me. I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die…”</p><p>The cold killer cried like a desperate little girl. All she could feel was that she was no longer in control of her mind or body.</p><p>A broker of the black market. Just like what the information described…Lou Cheng nodded his head slightly and said,</p><p>“Which organization are you from?”</p><p>“Star, Star Alliance. Please let me go,” answered the girl in tears.</p><p>An organization with Physical Invulnerability Experts who control three territories. Lou Cheng could sense the mental condition of the girl. He confirmed that she had truly given in and couldn’t possibly lie to him.</p><p>It seems that Ji Kang had nothing to do with the disappearance of my cousin-in-law. It should be because of other reasons. These are indeed the war-torn zones… After keeping silent for ten seconds, Lou Cheng took out his phone, which had no reception, and displayed a recent photo of Lin Que.</p><p>“Have you seen this man?”</p><p>Shivering, the girl looked carefully before shaking her head in a hurry,</p><p>“I have not.”</p><p>She was afraid that Lou Cheng didn’t believe her and quickly added, “You, you can head to Ginwale bar on the Tutans street and ask around. They have a general behind them, and it’s one of the few main locations for intelligence exchange that involve many people. If, if the person on that photograph was here, someone at the place should have seen him!”</p><p>There was a line on the information he had received that mentioned this, but the information wasn’t detailed. It’s inferior to the Rose Mill that does human trafficking. Ginwale bar is a place used by people at the lower levels. Nonetheless, there are different ways to get different types of information…With these thoughts in mind, Lou Cheng forgot about the female killer who had slouched onto the floor. He walked to the entrance, opened the door and disappeared into the dark alley.</p><p>She stared blankly at him as he left and only recovered after a long time. Following a loud wail, she began crying again as she was overwhelmed by the joy of returning from the gates of death.</p><p>She used both of her hands and legs to stand, but her body was shivering so badly that made it hard for her muster any strength. She fell down again as her body was covered in dust.</p><p>At this moment, clear footsteps could be heard from the stairway.</p><p>Devil? That devil is back? Her eyes shrunk and her hair stood on end as though an electric current flowed through her spine.</p><p>She forgot her sluggishness and lack of power instantly. Leaping to her feet, she rushed to the windows and jumped out.</p><p>Bam! She didn’t land steadily and ended up rolling on the floor. She didn’t know how many bones she had broken, but she still managed to dive into a small alley. In her mind, a thought kept resonating.</p><p>I’m no longer going for any mission!</p><p>This world is too horrifying!</p><p>I going to see a psychiatrist!</p><p>At the stairway, a man with a rifle slung on him found the deserted room and peed casually.</p><p>…</p><p>Compared to Kamon, Tutans street was clearly more prosperous. Although there were fierce looking pedestrians, they weren’t the same as the group of scouts filled with solemn killing intent.</p><p>At the entrance of Ginwale bar, six strong, burly men were standing there. They didn’t attempt to hide the bulge near their waist and some of them even carried AK rifles.</p><p>Without hesitation, Lou Cheng walked over and respectfully announced,</p><p>“I want to see your boss.”</p><p>The six men suddenly felt something heavy as they found it hard to even straighten their backs. The man in front of them seemed suddenly tall and profound. They only felt like following his words and didn’t dare to defy him.</p><p>“Yes, as you wish,” the blonde leader answered while shivering.</p><p>He led Lou Cheng inside. They passed by the heavily congested, dimly lit first level where music was blasting and arrived at the stairs leading to the basement.</p><p>At this point, he finally remembered to report the visitor.</p><p>In the basement where an illegal boxing competition was taking place, there was a spacious and gorgeous office. Behind the metal desk sat a man in a red general suit.</p><p>He looked majestic and domineering and had a stern look on his face. He had a large general hat on his head that covered his eyes. Whoever he looked at in the room trembled with fear and wanted to go on his knees to beg for forgiveness.</p><p>And everyone in this room was a famous character in the Ginwale bar, the Tutans streets, and even Tignes City!</p><p>“General, there’s a guest who wishes to see you.” A trembling voice sounded from the speaker.</p><p>The man whom others addressed as the general crossed his fingers and rested his elbows on the table. After a short moment of silence, he opened his mouth and said calmly,</p><p>“Let him in.”</p><p>I would like to see who wants to see me!</p><p>Lou Cheng arms hung naturally beside him, his index finger hooked on his pants. He followed the blonde man down the stairs and realized that there was another level below the ground level.</p><p>Passing by the ring that was filled with blood from intense fighting, he arrived at the entrance of the office. He saw the boss of the bar surrounded by several experts, wearing a red general suit and a large general hat.</p><p>“It’s you…” Lou Cheng was initially shocked but a smile quickly appeared.</p><p>Who would have expected the boss to be an acquaintance of his? He was the General Veigar who had defeated him during the Four Nation Competition!</p><p>He had been training in the war-torn zones for many years and even came across the Priest, Peng Leyun, once. Indirectly, he helped him to make the great leap to become a Physical Invulnerability expert!</p><p>“It’s you!” Veigar was also shocked as his pupils shrunk to the size of a needle with silvery flickers of light.</p><p>Different from the various experts in the war-torn zones who lacked information from the outside, he had long known through his information channels in Miluo that this old opponent in front of him was no longer the same as before. He was truly a general class expert now.</p><p>Veigar relaxed his hands, which were placed on the table, and retracted them in front of him. He was deeply wary.</p><p>After looking at the experts around, he finally opened his mouth and asked,</p><p>“What are you here for?”</p><p>“To buy a piece of intelligence,” answered Lou Cheng directly.</p><p>Veigar squinted his eyes and scrutinized Lou Cheng carefully. All he felt was that he could no longer see through this man, who had lost to him previously.</p><p>Not only was he unable to see through him, but he also felt a never before felt fear, like animals facing their natural enemies.</p><p>“What kind of intelligence?” Veigar’s tone instinctively relaxed.</p><p>“I’d like to know who has seen this man over the past few days.” Lou Cheng took out his phone and showed the image of Lin Que.</p><p>“Hand the photos over and I’ll get someone to ask.” Seeing that it was just a small matter, Veigar’s body wasn’t tensed like before.</p><p>Leveraging the network of the bar, Lou Cheng handed the photo over, after which Veigar ordered his underlings to handle it immediately.</p><p>As for Lou Cheng, he didn’t leave. Instead, he pulled up a chair and sat beside the office door, acting as though he would not let it rest until he got an answer.</p><p>Green veins appeared on Veigar’s forehead and pulsed twice. However, he didn’t flare up in the end.</p><p>After keeping silence for a long time, he suddenly opened his mouth and asked,</p><p>“If I can get the intelligence that you want, I hope to get a special remuneration.”</p><p>“What?” Since Lou Cheng had said that he was buying and not snatching, there was naturally room for discussion.</p><p>Veigar clenched his fist tightly, straightened his broad, giant back and said,</p><p>“Fight with me. l’d like to know what the difference is between us now!”</p><p>Maybe then I could trigger my body to become a general class expert!</p><p>“No problem,” Lou Cheng answered after contemplating a few seconds.</p><p>The two of them ceased talking and the office quickly returned to silence as before. However the feeling of suppression made everyone uncomfortable to the point that no one even dared to breathe loudly. The only exception was Lou Cheng.</p><p>After a short while, information was finally sent back. There were more than five guards of the Ginwale bar that had seen Lin Que three days ago at this very same place!</p><p>“He participated in an illegal boxing match and left with injuries. After which, he did not appear again,” Veigar’s underling said honestly.</p><p>“Injuries?” asked Lou Cheng.</p><p>Although he had just taken a quick glance at the boxing ring, he could tell that both parties in the ring were limited to the low-tier Dan stage. How could he get injured in such a place?</p><p>With his strength, unless Veigar participated directly or others ganged up, no one would be able to do it!</p><p>Veigar answered on behalf of his underling,</p><p>“There happened to be someone powerful fighting in the ring that day. He was a mysterious and rather strange guy…I believe that the strength he displayed was just a portion of his true strength.”</p><p>“Who was he?” asked Lou Cheng without changing his expression.</p><p>Perhaps it was because such an opponent caught the eye of my cousin-in-law that he chose to challenge him.</p><p>Veigar signalled for his underling to bring the laptop over. After which, he picked several matches and replayed them.</p><p>As Lou Cheng watched, a slow frown formed on his face. Lin Que’s opponent was truly strange!</p><p>He had blonde hair and blue, expressionless eyes. He was more “Lin Que” than Lin Que himself. Every punch and kick was accurately measured and well-controlled, and he seemed to have the knowing of an omniscient god. But in other ways, he had his shortcomings.</p><p>Though he was strong and agile, he gave off the feeling of being stiff. At times, it was as though he lacked the ability to feel pain.</p><p>It’s a little strange…Could Lin Que’s disappearance have something to do with him? Lou Cheng wondered.</p><p>Perhaps his disappearance wasn’t revenge by human traffickers, but something else. Otherwise, the experts from Shu Shan Study, who were watching over him in the dark, would have some clue to his whereabouts…</p><p>“Who is he and where is he now?” Lou Cheng asked directly.</p><p>Veigar looked towards his underling who replied in a low voice,</p><p>“I don’t know who he is or who is behind him. However, I do know where he lives. He’s staying in a condominium at 172 San Jose Street near the suburbs.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Lou Cheng stood up and placed his chair back.</p><p>“I can fulfill your remuneration now.” Veigar stood up as both of his fists flickered in the silvery light. It was as though he was wearing a pair of heavy gloves.</p><p>Lou Cheng lifted his head to look at him. He slowly raised his arms and crossed his fingers.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>He threw a punch covered in dense, dazzling light. The surrounding light was absorbed as the punch got brighter and brighter and the office got darker and darker.</p><p>The darkness turned black and the temperature dropped. Just as Veigar went to dodge, a chilling wind filled his body and he shivered uncontrollably.</p><p>The dazzling white light got brighter and brighter in front of him, occupying the heavens and the earth.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The guard that had formed in front of him was forcefully broken through as silver-white snakes fluttered.</p><p>Bam bam bam! Veigar flew back and smashed through three layers of walls before being covered by the rubble.</p><p>Sha sha sha! His underlings had all pulled out their guns or clenched their fists tightly as they surrounded Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Let him go,” shouted Veigar in a hoarse voice.</p><p>Lou Cheng didn’t take a second look at these underlings but turned around, tugged his hands into his shirt, and left.</p><p>The punch was taken from God Slaying Saber, Lu Yongyuan. Using the uniqueness of Cosmic Universe Style, it improved his coordination. However, he was still lacking the innate source of dominance it needed.</p><p>Veigar struggled to get up and looked on as Lou Cheng left casually. After some time, he heaved a sigh,</p><p>Is this the distance between me and him now?</p><p>Just a single punch…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
