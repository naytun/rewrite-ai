Shocked, he opened his mouth and greeted,</p><p>“I didn’t expect to see you here.”</p><p>The Spiderman has been sent to the war-torn zones!</p><p>And he sure cleans up well!</p><p>Smith’s mouth twitched as he forced a smile and said,</p><p>“Lou, that’s what I wanted to say.”</p><p>I crossed the seas and reach this war-torn area just to run into this trouble maker!</p><p>Sensing the grudge in his words, Lou Cheng smiled faintly and said,</p><p>“In China, we call this fate.”</p><p>“My Mandarin teacher told me that there’s a type of fate known as ‘doomed relationship’,” mumbled Smith softly.</p><p>Spiderman, the truth is you’d have a talent for talk shows, too. Lou Cheng was speechless for a moment, not knowing how to reply.</p><p>As the Allied HQ was a public space, it would be best for the two of them to not be overly friendly with each other, or else others might recall the relationship between the two of them in the past, where Smith was assigned to supervise Lou Cheng. He didn’t speak further and just nodded. After completing the customary exchanges, Lou Cheng, with an introduction from his people, got to know the higher American management and the special team members he would work with later.</p><p>“Who is he?” Looking at Lou Cheng’s back, the black officer, Dwyane, lowered his voice and asked Smith.</p><p>Seeing who he’s surrounded by, his position isn’t low.</p><p>“You don’t know?” Smith returned the question in shock.</p><p>Dwyane face gor hot and he rubbed his hands together, embarassed,</p><p>“I’ve been in the war-torn zones for three years. The information I get from the outside world is pretty filtered.”</p><p>Smith pondered for a few seconds before saying,</p><p>“To put it simply, he’s a newly advanced Terror Grade expert.”</p><p>“‘Terror Grade?” Dwyane gasped before continuing, “Then the upper management’s assessment of the risk for this mission must not be too optimistic?”</p><p>Though he had been confident, he couldn’t help but feel a little nervous.</p><p>“But we don’t have a Terror Grade expert from our side, too?” Smith settled down as he noticed something was amiss.</p><p>“Yep. It’s probably because the assessment results of China aren’t in line with ours. They’re always overly cautious.” Dwyane nodded his head, pondering this as he calmed down.</p><p>He believed in his comrades whom he had worked with for three years. They were the reason he was alive today.</p><p>Before Smith could speak, he turned and asked,</p><p>“You know him?”</p><p>“He’s been to Connecticut. I was responsible for keeping an eye on him. At that time, he was just Danger Grade. We had some contact during that time,” answered Smith honestly.”</p><p>“So you’re friends. Smith, you should be happy about that! If there’s an accident, he’ll choose to save who he’s familiar with. You’ll be very safe!” Dwyane said with a little envy.</p><p>“That’s true, in theory.” Smith’s mouth twitched a little before continuing, “However, you should know that Lou is a troublemaker. Whether it’s intentional or unintentional, there were always situations happening around him. What might seem ordinary always developed into something catastrophic.”</p><p>Just thinking about it gives me a headache!</p><p>Although he was happy that certain events had happened, and that he had participated in them, it still went to prove Lou’s ability to create trouble. Yeah. As the saying goes, he’s a magnet for trouble.</p><p>“Shouldn’t people like him be excluded from missions? What’s the Chinese military thinking?” Dwyane was once again shocked.</p><p>In this world where there were supernatural forces, reducing omen risks and increasing luck factors were necessary preparations for every mission.</p><p>“Who knows?” Smith shrugged his shoulders. “But the file on Lou indicates that he’s simply unlucky, with no related supernatural abilities.”</p><p>Smith suddenly stopped. He frowned and asked, “Wait, what did you just say?”</p><p>“People like him should be excluded from missions,” repeated a confused Dwyane.</p><p>“Before that?” Smith asked seriously.</p><p>Dwyane thought for a few seconds before saying, “You would be very safe. If there’s an accident, he would choose to save who he’s familiar with…What are you trying to ask?”</p><p>“You mean that I’ll be working with him?” Smith subconsciously raised his voice.</p><p>Dwyane looked at him with pity and said,</p><p>“You don’t know yet? You’ve been assigned to the action team of China.”</p><p>Smith’s settled emotions were triggered once again. He almost blurted out curse words, which he reined into a long, “Oh”.</p><p>After visiting the Allied HQ, Lou Cheng received the mission plan for “Operation Dawn.”</p><p>This mission was divided into three parts. The first part was about making use of the airport to launch airstrikes in Ta Gu and his gang’s territory, destroying their defense.</p><p>After the airstrikes were over, a special action force would sneak in amidst the chaos to round up their leaders. At the same time, they would finish off Ta Gu and other main leaders to crush their leadership and prevent anyone from slipping out.</p><p>After the decapitations, the ground force would be responsible for the rounding up and cleaning off the remaining.</p><p>A mission plan like this was direct and straightforward. It fit this simple mission well.</p><p>Lou Cheng would be required to participate in only the second step as a reinforcement to prevent accidents.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the three-story building hidden within the mountain ranges, the skinny, dark-skinned man was rubbing the jade ring on his thumb and had sunk into a long silence.</p><p>He was of mixed Miluo and Shengxiang ethnicity. Using his bravery and lack of fearing death, he had made a name for himself and become a warlord and famous drug dealer in this region. If he hadn’t suffered grave injuries or had received appropriate medical treatments, he would at least be at the Inhuman level.</p><p>“So what’s your decision?” In addition to the two trusted experts beside Ta Gu, there was another man wearing a black t-shirt. He was over fifty years old, had yellowish skin, dull eyes, and gave off a dangerous vibe.</p><p>Ta Gu’s mouth twitched a little before saying,</p><p>“What do you guys want with me? Why are you trying to recruit me?”</p><p>The old man with thin silver hair remained expressionless as he replied,</p><p>“It’s about these war-torn areas…” He coughed. “There’s a group of Physical Invulnerability experts teaming up in secret. Some of them have been born and raised here, while there are others who betrayed their birth countries and wish to stay here. Our objective is to give this war-torn zone back to the experts who truly belong to these war-torn parts.”</p><p>“We will bring order back to this land. Obviously, the requirement is that we are in control.”</p><p>“You have rich resources and channels that deal with the external world. These are things we require.”</p><p>“That said, let us help you and bring you out of danger. All you have to do is agree to serve us.”</p><p>Ta Gu sank into silence once again. Several thoughts flashed through his mind and he couldn’t decide.</p><p>As that moment, a low but loud homing sound sounded from afar. The sound gradually became sharper. Terrifying explosions followed.</p><p>Rumble! Rumble! Rumble!</p><p>Amidst the tremors, Ta Gu stood up abruptly in fear.</p><p>He made his decision in that instant, saying to the white-haired old man,</p><p>“I agree to your proposal!”</p><p>His wife and confidants had already packed their luggage. Sticking out of their bags were gold and firearms which shimmered under the lights.</p><p>…</p><p>After the bombing, the special action team slipped through the smoke and flames and entered the core region of Ta Gu’s territory. After which, they divided themselves into small groups and headed towards their separate targets. Lou Cheng was undoubtedly in the team that headed to where Ta Gu lived. The other members were ex-Spiderman, Smith; Storm Giant, Dwyane; Shadow Hunter, Cheng An; Thoughtless Blade, Jian Dan; and others.</p><p>Along the way, they had no delays. Occasionally, they encountered a few enemies, who were either tied up in spider threads or shot by countless Formless Aerial Blades. They arrived at the three-story building without being stopped and saw the place raging in flames.</p><p>“Ta Gu has escaped…” Cheng An pinched his nose and found a clue amongst the rubble.</p><p>“He really didn’t hesitate, escaping just when he needed to. To be able to abandon everything, he’s truly an ambitious character.” Jian Dan looked to the left and right as he said emotionally.</p><p>After checking carefully again, Cheng An said,</p><p>“There are quite a number of people with them. They shouldn’t be able to move fast.”</p><p>Storm Giant, Dwyane said,</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>The group set out once again. They followed the small path over the mountain and entered a damp forest.</p><p>As they chased Ta Gu, Smith, Cheng An and the rest suddenly heard soft, but dense voices that caused goosebumps to rise.</p><p>They looked around and saw countless insects, colourful snakes, flying birds, and uncountable small creatures the size of a grain of sand. Smith even came face to face with a spider that had a human face on its back.</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of creepy spiders reflected in his eyes, sending a cold chill down his spine.</p><p>The insects, which could overwhelm Lou Cheng and the group, suddenly stopped. The temperature dropped rapidly. Water droplets coalesced into beads and froze into layers and layers of ice. The insects had been frozen into statues!</p><p>Smith heard Lou Cheng say in a soft voice,</p><p>“An Inhuman isn’t capable of this…”</p><p>“Is there a problem?”</p><p>Smith was initially speechless. Following which, his mouth twitched as he cursed softly,</p><p>“You don’t say…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
