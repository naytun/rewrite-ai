Under most of the circumstances, it had a more common, well known and acceptable name: The Physical Invulnerability Team!</p><p>All the official members of this team were physical invulnerability experts who had made the great leap!</p><p>After connecting the dots that Empress Luo suggested, the reporters retracted their gazes and looked at one another. Some of them were lost, some of them were confused while others were agitated. They felt that they had gotten a thread to something big.</p><p>Really?</p><p>Lou Cheng had really made the great leap and make it to the top?</p><p>However he suffered a grave injury a year ago and had just recovered from it. How is it possible for him to reach the physical invulnerability stage?</p><p>How low he had fallen could be confirmed with the occasional Weibo update he posted. Coming back and advancing seemed to be two completely different matters!</p><p>The reporters kept exchanging glances as this piece of news was too sudden, too explosive and too incredible. They had even forgotten to raise their hands and asked further questions in fear that their conjectures would sound silly to others.</p><p>After several tens of seconds, one reporter finally stood out. The female reporter with maroon red hair looked at Ning Zitong and asked with a trembling voice, “Empress Luo, what you are saying is that Lou Cheng made the great leap and reached the physical invulnerability stage?”</p><p>When this question was asked, all the reporters held their breath and focused on Ning Zitong. The conference room was so quiet that one could hear a pin dropped.</p><p>Ning Zitong looked around before smiling elegantly, “Yes.”</p><p>The entire conference room immediately erupted. The reporters were whispering with one another and discussing fervently.</p><p>“Oh my god, he just recovered, right?”</p><p>“Was the news of him being injured fake?”</p><p>“He wouldn’t have to resort to saying goodbyes on Weibo if it was fake…”</p><p>“Let me see, based on what Lou Cheng said himself, he probably recovered in July or August. In other words, he used just a month of time to reach physical invulnerability stage?”</p><p>“This… This is comparable to the Living Buddha’s pace!”</p><p>…</p><p>After allowing the reporters to discuss within themselves for a while, Ning Zitong finally continued with a radiant smile, “Feel free to clarify any doubts you might have. The subject is right here. There aren’t many opportunities.”</p><p>The female reporter with maroon hair took advantage of the fact that she was still standing and asked Lou Cheng aggressively, “Mr. Lou Cheng. May I ask when did you make the great leap?”</p><p>They didn’t doubt the authenticity of this incident. This was because Empress Luo attended the news release and this was equivalent to using the full faith of Longhu Club as backing.</p><p>Moreover, Lou Cheng would definitely participate in top-tier professional competitions and title matches. Even if they could hide it now, they wouldn’t be able to do so for a lifetime!</p><p>Lou Cheng moved the mike over and answer honestly, “In the beginning of August.”</p><p>Roar! The conference room erupted once again. Every single reporter seemed to be extremely excited.</p><p>The reporter with a pair of narrow framed spectacles raised his hand and stood up. After which, he asked with composure, “When did you recover from your previous injury? And what were the reasons for your injury?”</p><p>Lou Cheng ignored the second question and replied based on his memory, “I recovered from my injury in the beginning of the year but suffered from sequelae. To solve this issue, I made an attempt in March. You guys could see it as a surgery. This attempt was very successful and allowed me to completely shake off my injury. After recuperation, I fully recovered around the month of June. ”</p><p>“In other words, you only took a month to make the great leap and achieve the physical invulnerability stage from the peak of inhuman stage?” A scholarly-looking reporter triumphed against all others and posted the question.</p><p>He had already thought of the headlines for this news conference. If Lou Cheng answered “Yes”, he would say “Comparable to Living Buddha”. Otherwise, he would emphasize “Incredible”.</p><p>Lou Cheng bit his lips, thought about what he wanted to say and answered with a faint smile, “You can’t put it that way. The truth is, I’m grateful for this injury and being at rock bottom over the last year. It allowed me to truly find my own path, understand my inner self, strengthen my resolve and accumulate enough knowledge to cross into the physical invulnerability stage. This was the true crux behind me making the great leap.”</p><p>He wasn’t one that liked to flaunt his learnings but right now, a sentence he learned flashed in his mind.</p><p>The sharp edge of a sword comes from constant grinding, and the plum blossom’s fragrance comes after the bitter winter cold!</p><p>Lou Cheng’s reply was great. He didn’t deny or confirm… The scholarly-looking reporter cursed silently and was preparing to ask another question to puff up the content of his reporting.</p><p>However at this moment, he discovered from the side of his vision that almost all the other reporters were writing fervently. Clearly, they had started writing their communication news and attempted to be the first to release it.</p><p>These imbeciles! The scholarly-looking reporter forwent his question and sat down in a hurry to start writing on his content.</p><p>…</p><p>“Core Team?” Upon hearing Tu Zheng’s words, the macho-looking Lu Shaofei’s pitch suddenly increased.</p><p>This was her dream and long cherished goal. Yet, it was that out of her reach!</p><p>Sun Jianlin was confused and asked with a frown, “Is he there to pay a visit to the physical invulnerability experts?”</p><p>Based on the rules, there was such a thing in the schedule for one who had just joined. This might hold too although this was the second time Lou Cheng was joining.</p><p>Tu Zheng kept his emotions in check before saying with an awful face, “Empress Luo and the rest aren’t too fond of the formalities all along…”</p><p>It was clear what he really meant. It seemed that this matter wasn’t that simple.</p><p>Yu Wangyuan and the rest opened their mouths before closing them. Suddenly, it went silent. The truth was they already had their own conjectures in their heart. It was just that they couldn’t believe the answer.</p><p>It must be a joke!</p><p>Even if Lou Cheng stays healthy for a year, he might not be able to achieve it. Let alone the fact that he had suffered a grave injury for a year!</p><p>Amidst the suppressed silence, Yu Wangyuan opened his mouth and said with a low voice, “Perhaps Lou Cheng has really reached the physical invulnerability stage…”</p><p>“How could it be?” Tu Zheng spoke slower and slower. He didn’t seem to want to fact the matter but still had to admit it.</p><p>Jia Lu kept his spectator’s mindset and laughed with a sigh, “Don’t say that I’m only saying this now. I feel that this might be true. He’s a Heavenly son of the era that has been creating miracle after miracle. The injury might have just been a blessing in disguise for him?”</p><p>Tu Zheng opened his mouth and was about to say something when he received a message suddenly. It was from Optimus Prime, Long Zhen.</p><p>His eyes swept through the message once, and again, and again. Finally, he believed that he was not hallucinating.</p><p>After a few seconds of silence, he looked down and said, “Lou Cheng has reached physical invulnerability.”</p><p>The six simple words reverberated throughout the reserve team training ground. Everyone felt a heavy feeling in their heart.</p><p>It was another period of silence. Lu Shaofei looked blankly forward but her mind was a mess. She didn’t know what she was thinking about. Yu Wangyuan was in a daze initially before forcing a smile and shaking his head constantly.</p><p>Sun Jianlin took a deep breath and wanted to say something. However, he chose to keep them back in the end. Jia Lu also looked at the green tile in front of him. Suddenly, it seemed like the patterns on it were filled with artistic beauty. She let out a laugh and mumbled to herself, “Alright. Now I don’t have to worry about being replaced by him.”</p><p>Yeah, it wasn’t meaningful at all to compare a physical invulnerability expert with an inhuman.</p><p>He and the rest of the group had been left far behind… So far that they could no longer see the back of him.</p><p>Yu Yuanwang forced a smile and said, “Some people are born to deal blows to others. My confidence has been completely shattered by him.”</p><p>Tu Zheng, Lu Shaofei and the rest had gone silent once again. Although they were unwilling to admit it, they were more reluctant to deceive themselves.</p><p>…</p><p>Songcheng University had just started a new semester. Yan Xiaoling, who was in her last year in the university, stood by the window of her dormitory. She looked at the far away Weishui Lake and suddenly, sad and emotions welled up in her.</p><p>She thought of an elegant and beautiful phrase but when it came out of her mouth, it had totally changed, “This water is darned clean… The school is so rich. How great would it be if they could subsidize the canteen!”</p><p>At this moment, her phone, which was placed on the study table, was vibrating incessantly and the notification ringtones kept ringing.</p><p>Who’s that? Yan Xiaoling mumbled and walked closer to the table to pick up her phone.</p><p>She glimpsed through it and saw voice messages after voice messages from Brahman.</p><p>Did something big happen? Yan Xiaoling unlocked her screen with a head full of doubts.</p><p>For her last summer semester, she had entered the late stage of the cancerous disease known as laziness. She had even rarely frequented the QQ group as she was too lazy to type and speak.</p><p>After clicking on the voice message, she placed the phone beside her ear. Yan Xiaoling almost went dead from the sharp voice of Brahman.</p><p>“Little Nightfall, Little Nightfall, Little Nightfall!”</p><p>“Look at the news! Look at the news! Look at the news!”</p><p>“Quick! Quick! Quick!”</p><p>What the… You are already in the third year of high school. Why are you still acting like a kid… Yan Xiaoling silently mocked Brahman, who was taller than her by 20 centimeters.</p><p>Several seconds later, her eyes reflected a familiar name and an exaggerated headline, “Lou Cheng’s Ascend to The Heavens, Comparable to Living Buddha!”</p><p>“Returning from the ordeal, Lou Cheng reaches physical invulnerability!”</p><p>“A blessing in disguise. The name of Heavenly son of the era is indeed worthy!”</p><p>…</p><p>What had happened? What had happened?… Yan Xiaoling was shocked and quickly clicked into the news to browse the content.</p><p>“…The Longhu Club held a press conference to announce Lou Cheng re-joining the club. He will be entering the Core Team…” After reading the first few lines, Yan Xiaoling finally knew what had happened.</p><p>Tears suddenly welled up in her eyes. She had really held it back for a long time. After which, a radiant smile appeared as she started walking back and forth. She even started humming a song,</p><p>I’ve waited for so long. I’ve finally waited till today!</p><p>She cried after laughing and laughed after crying. After the cycle repeated itself for a few times, Yan Xiaoling sat on the chair in a daze. She wore a silly smile.</p><p>It was only when Mu Jinnian walked in and touched her hair that she regained her conscious. She logged in to the forum and saw that the thread had exploded.</p><p>“Simply, simply… I couldn’t find any words to describe my feelings now!” Unparalleled Dragon King spoke in a manner that was not seen frequently.</p><p>Nie Qiqi posted on the thread, “[Jumping around expression] Girls, come and take a look at God!”</p><p>“D*mn it! This is what you call a dent to his potential? I also would like to have such a “dent to my potential”!” laughed “All The Good Names Are Taken By Dogs”.</p><p>…</p><p>Just when Yan Xiaoling was about to join them, “Poison Milk Hierarch” He Xiaowei was reviewing the relevant Weibo messages. He discovered that everyone was discussing how he could make the great leap so quickly and everyone was feeling emotional and excited.</p><p>As he had failed miserably because of Lou Cheng several times, He Xiaowei had learned from his mistake. He had chose to stay away from anything relating to Lou Cheng and not to comment before everything had been confirmed.</p><p>Yeah, now’s the time! He typed with satisfaction and posted a message on Weibo, “I feel that the focuses of discussions are a little off. Let us make a guess on how long would it take for Lou Cheng to get his first title!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
