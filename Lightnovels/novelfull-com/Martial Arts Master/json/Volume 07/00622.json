However, he had been through a lot. On the surface, he maintained a faint smile, greeted and said,</p><p>“Thank you Sect Master Martial Uncle for the compliments.”</p><p>Geezer Shi looked with disdained while He Yi shook his head and laughed heartily, “You don’t have to be humble about this. Anyone with a mind can see clearly. It’s impressive to reach physical invulnerability before twenty-three years old and half a year earlier than Wisdom King. Even if we are to look back in the past thousand years of history, there aren’t many similar cases.”</p><p>At this point, Shi Jianguo interrupted and said, “Sect Master Martial Senior, don’t praise him like this. This stinky brat is going to get arrogant! Advancing to physical invulnerability is indeed something but from here onwards, you have to forget about your past achievements. This is because your opponents will all be physical invulnerability and which physical invulnerability expert isn’t a giant within the men and did not have experience? Although you were able to kill two of them together with Ren Li, don’t forget that they had gone through a tough battle previously!”</p><p>Master, you are right to say that. However, why do I feel that you are praising me in another way… Lou Cheng cursed silently but still respectfully said, “Thank you Master for the teachings.”</p><p>“Then you better go and practice the Physical Invulnerability Chapters!” said Geezer Shi as he stared at him. In the end, he asked concerningly again, “Have you passed the flesh of the Dark Night Bat” to the military?”</p><p>“I gave it to them at Wei City.,” answered Lou Cheng honestly. In his heart, he couldn’t help but curse silently.</p><p>If I didn’t give the flesh to the military, how was I supposed to board the plane? I couldn’t possibly tell the security personnel that this was a fresh piece of beef, right?</p><p>I don’t want to be seen as a psychotic murderer!</p><p>“You’re still quite reliable.,” complimented Geezer Shi unwillingly.</p><p>He Yi did not nag on and led Lou Cheng after turning around. After getting past several layers of checkpoints, he entered the Secret Hall.</p><p>There hadn’t been many changes since Lou Cheng was here the last time. It was still filled with howling freezing wind and falling snow. In the middle of the room, the Ice Essence Bead was placed in a transparent cabinet. The visualization diagram corresponding to the nine unique physical invulnerability skills was hanging by the wall. Each drawing had a stone platform in front of it that gathered the secondary moves, detailed explanation of practice notes by the predecessors and other items.</p><p>“Make the best use of this opportunity. However, try not to exceed three hours each day.” He Yi reminded with a faint smile on his face.</p><p>There’s a distinct difference between grasping the concepts and being able to directly practice them!</p><p>“Yes, Sect Master Martial Uncle.” Currently, Lou Cheng no longer needed to circulate his Fire Force while standing in the chilling environment to warm himself. He seemed to have merged with the surrounding “Heaven and earth” and became one entity.</p><p>After seeing He Yi off and waiting for the heavy door to close tightly, he walked to the vicinity of the fifth move, “Enemy Heart Freezing Move”, and looked at the surreal ice heart. The surrounding white frost fog contracted and relaxed, making it seem just like a real heart.</p><p>He chose to practice this move first because he had the corresponding “Encountering Gods in the Void” realm. His mind had also changed distinctively with him making the great leap. Therefore, he should be able to master this move quickly.</p><p>He sat down with his legs crossed on the floor covered in snow. His dull eyes seemed to contain the titanic starlit skies and reflected that mysterious, crystal-clear and transparent heart.</p><p>Gradually, the suspended visualization diagram didn’t change but the “Enemy Heart Freezing Move” in Lou Cheng eyes started contracting and relaxing at a slow and regular pace.</p><p>Plop, plop, plop. The hearts from two spots seemed to have become one. All he could feel was the dust on him being swept away, making him feel refreshed and clear. Subsequently, his surroundings became clearer to him and started to appear.</p><p>This was a little similar to the Confrontation Formula… Lou Cheng mumbled to himself. Using his experience in mastering the Confrontation Formula, he started trying to understand the “Enemy Heart Freezing Move”</p><p>Once he started, time flew and everything had gone silent.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Lou Cheng suddenly felt something. Despite being separated by several layers of thick metal doors, he could hear the footsteps of the approaching He Yi. In addition, surreal images of several small bugs crawling slowly on the surface covered by silverish white ice appeared vividly in his mind as though he had seen it with his own eyes.</p><p>When everything was silent, everything that was happening around seemed to be in peace and was amazing. Lou Cheng felt like he had a new understanding of the natural world from a different perspective.</p><p>“So this is the “Enemy Heart Freezing Move…” He closed his eyes and heaved a sigh with content.</p><p>Leveraging on his experience with the Confrontation Formula and his solid foundation in Ice Mirror, he managed to reach the minimum bar of understanding in just three hours. With another two to three practices, he believed he would be able to achieve a preliminary mastery.</p><p>Other than having the ability of “Self Reflection”, “Enemy Heart Freezing Move” also possessed part of the effects of the “Confrontation” Formula and all the characteristics of “Forwarding” Formula. Using gaming terminology, it would be having increased resistance to negative emotions and impacts to the mind.</p><p>Other than that, the “Enemy Heart Freezing Move” was also capable of reflecting one’s opponent, senses their emotions and made judgements in advance like a god.</p><p>Its intuition ability seemed to have improved too… Shaking his slightly inflated head, Lou Cheng stood up and walked to the door.</p><p>While training attentively, no snow had accumulated on his body surface. This was because his muscles and skin had instinctively reacted. By wriggling slightly, they had shaken off every piece of snow that fell on his body.</p><p>Walking out of the Secret Hall while feeling refreshed, Lou Cheng noticed that his master had already left. He tucked both of his hands into the pocket and walked slowly towards the Songtao Pavilion. From time to time, he would take a scenery shot and sent it to Yan Zheke to share with her every joyous event he experienced. As for Yan Zheke, she had just reached the Dan stage and was busy practicing the Dan stage skills of the Fighting Sect and the Ji Family. She was living each day to the fullest and was satisfied with it.</p><p>While making his way past the corridor, Lou Cheng saw a martial arts training ground. There were quite a number of disciples of the Ice God Sect practicing under the guidance of their coach. They sweated profusely and were full of vitality and youth.</p><p>The real headquarters of the Ice God Sect was located in the “Ice God Tower” in Moshang City currently. Other than a few ceremonies, the majority of the events were settled there. However, the ancestral ground was away from the noise of the city and was the most suitable for newly-joined disciples to focus in practice and lay down a strong foundation.</p><p>Noticing Lou Cheng walking over slowly from the sight of his vision, the coach quickly turned back, greeted and said, “Good afternoon Martial Uncle Lou.”</p><p>The other disciples followed the rules and did not stop their training. However, they couldn’t help but glance at Lou Cheng.</p><p>Seeing them, Lou Cheng recalled the past. His heart was filled with joy and said while nodding slightly, “Train hard everyone.”</p><p>He carefreely stood there and watched on for a while before leaving quietly without alarming the hardworking disciples. After passing by the corridor covered by the shadows of the tree, he reached the Songtao Pavillion.</p><p>This place was surrounded by bright green trees like always.</p><p>…</p><p>Ice God Tower.</p><p>Zhu Tai, who had become the supervisor for several properties, suddenly saw his martial junior, Lei Fang, as he walked out from the lift and was on his way to the office.</p><p>Witnessing how the confident and bright Lei Fang had turned into the current steady and reserved person over the years, Zhe Tai heaved a sigh. He pushed his degreeless pair of spectacles before greeting with a smile, “Why didn’t you head there?”</p><p>“I’m here to collect some pocket money.” Lei Fang smiled faintly and answered composedly.</p><p>He had officially joined the Wuyue Club just a few months ago and was arranged to fight in several high standard professional competition.</p><p>Zhu Tai nodded his head and encouraged, “Work hard! A twenty-six year old inhuman still has the opportunity to go for physical invulnerability. Unlike me who no longer possesses any hopes…”</p><p>He was already thirty-two years old and could clearly feel the stagnation in the growth of his mind and the solidification when he made visualizations.</p><p>Initially, Zhu Tai wasn’t very pleased with Lei Fang. He felt that his Master was vaguely showing favoritism towards Lei Fang. However, when his hopes were all gone, he gradually brightened up and became at ease with it. When he couldn’t sleep at night, he still felt depressed and disappointed while feeling difficult to get over it.</p><p>“In that case, I’ll thank Martial Senior for your good wishes in advance.” Lei Fang lowered his head and smiled. “However, I’m not the one with the greatest hopes of making the great leap. Zheng Yu is twenty-eight this year and is a senior fourth-pin professional. He’s also close to the physical invulnerability stage now. Qian Qiyue is just twenty-five and has been at the inhuman stage for a year…”</p><p>After saying four to five names, he laughed self-mockingly, “I often regret my initial decision and should have joined the Wuyue Club earlier. With the stimulation from competing with so many people that are stronger than me and the environment of chasing one another, I might not need to take three years to advance from professional sixth-pin to the inhuman stage.”</p><p>Lei Fang had stayed in the Ice god Sect in the previous few years and participated in a few low level professional competitions.</p><p>“You’re still better than me.” Zhu Tai heaved a sigh while shaking his head.</p><p>After chatting for a while, the two of them separated. They were already on two very different paths.</p><p>…</p><p>The next day morning, bird chirps sounded across the mountains.</p><p>Lou Cheng received a message from Yan Zheke the moment he woke up. She said, “[Clenched fist expression] Another great day of working hard!”</p><p>She had intended to achieve a preliminary mastery of the Dan stage skills from the Fighting Sect and Ji Family before going to the Yanbing Mount for holiday. Subsequently, she would head to America and sought guidance under Aunt Du.</p><p>Seeing the message, Lou Cheng subconsciously smiled. He replied, “[Hand shake expression] Together!”</p><p>After his morning practice, he had his breakfast and took a short break. Subsequently, Lou Cheng entered the Secret Hall again to practice the “Enemy Heart Freezing Move”. After which, he viewed the unique movement technique, the second move, “Mesmerizing Snow Step”.</p><p>When he ended his early afternoon practice and returned to the Ice Queen Pavilion, He Yi smiled at him and said, “Let’s go to the Wuyue Club in the afternoon.”</p><p>“Huh?” Lou Cheng was completely lost.</p><p>Shouldn’t the current focus be on training?</p><p>Why are we going to the Wuyue Club for no reason?</p><p>Speaking of which, I haven’t been to that place…</p><p>He Yi smiled and explained,</p><p>“To and experience the Polar Laboratory.”</p><p>“This can help you in consolidating the connection with the Heaven and earth quickly and accelerate your progress in practicing the Physical Invulnerability Chapters. Naturally, since you have only made the advancement recently, you shouldn’t use it too often. It would be better to use it once in three days.”</p><p>Lou Cheng was filled with anticipation upon hearing it. He quickly nodded his head and said,</p><p>“Thank you Sect Master Martial Uncle for the reminder.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
