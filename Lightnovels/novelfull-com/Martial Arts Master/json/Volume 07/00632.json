A heavy snowstorm gathered, blocking the vision of others and disorienting everyone. In this cold and white environment, he couldn’t see further than three meters and his mind couldn’t extend too far.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The Fire Force hidden within Long Zhen’s fist was expanding. Reddish-gold flames raged towards the surroundings, melting the snow and disrupting the trails of the violent winds. A huge area was cleared just like what the main cannon of a tank could do. However, after the explosions settled down, the wind returned and the snow began to fall again. Everything returned to the white and cold environment. It was as though a modern army had encountered the forces of nature.</p><p>In the eyes of Dragon King, Empress Luo and the others, who were standing afar, they noticed that the seventy percent illusory “Scorching Sun” that Lou Cheng had formed through the connection with Heaven and earth did not disappear. It had moved to the edge of the battlefield in balance. The further the environment was from the “Scorching Sun”, the colder and darker it would be.</p><p>Chen Qitao continued observing for a while and nodded his head in approval.</p><p>Wu!</p><p>The howling of the wind was getting louder and Long Zhen felt as though he had encountered bad weather while being in the polar regions. Moreover, amidst the heavy snow environment, a punch or a whipping kick would be thrown at him from time to time. Sometimes, there were even consecutive attacks or concentrated attacks. Although such attacks were largely separated and mostly used as feints, he wasn’t sure if this would remain the same. This caused him to be unable to get a sense of the rhythm and capture Lou Cheng’s figure. He could only react passively and depended on his spiritual connection with his surroundings to reflect and defend.</p><p>Pa pa pa! Bam bam bam!</p><p>Long Zhen was just like an agile elephant as he blocked several rounds of ambush from Lou Cheng with his punches and kicks.</p><p>He knew that he couldn’t allow this to continue. In that instant, he allowed his mind to sink, changed his visualization and exploded with “brute strength”.</p><p>Instantly, the “giant fireball”, that battled with Lou Cheng’s “Stars” for territory, appeared again. One couldn’t tell if it was illusory or real. With Long Zhen as the center of the fireball, it quickly expanded!</p><p>The tumultuous dazzling bluish-white flame raged higher and higher like waves and almost covered the entire battlefield. As it clashed with the violent snowstorms, they cancelled each other out.</p><p>The illusory and unperceivable scene disappeared. However, Long Zhen wasn’t able to lock down on Lou Cheng’s location immediately.</p><p>He concentrated his mind and instantly saw Lou Cheng. Lou Cheng, who was wearing a navy blue martial arts suit, had retreated to the edge unknowingly. Behind him was a large, heavy, scorching hot and seventy percent illusory “Sun”!</p><p>At this moment, he was just like Emperor Yan descending onto the world.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Lou Cheng stomped both of his legs to the ground. Using his body as a punch, he “threw” himself out. That huge “Sun” moved accordingly and merged with Lou Cheng, making the surface of his body glow brilliantly. His figure turned faint as he became a burning meteor that moved through the atmosphere at high speed. In an instant, he clashed with Long Zhen.</p><p>They were standing several tens of meters apart but Lou Cheng had disappeared in a blink of an eye!</p><p>This was also an application method of the fourth move of the Fire Sect, “Flying Flames Meteorite”. The essence of it was in its quickness and borrowing the strength of the environment to increase its might.</p><p>His eyes were filled with the radiant light and it was almost impossible to look directly at it. Long Zhen was a first-pin expert that had experienced various battles and did not panic. He clenched both of his fists and smashed towards the space in front of him. Golden flames stacked up layer after layer as they materialized. The surrounding air flow and soil on the grow were affected as sparks of fire could be seen swaying.</p><p>As the sparks connected, it became densely packed in an instant as though the whole field was burning.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Just as the meteor struck, the golden flames had already exploded. The shockwaves generated from the explosions clashed with the violent impact Lou Cheng made. The resulting terrifying strong winds that swept across and blew out a substantial number of fire sparks.</p><p>Within the airwaves, Long Zhen placed both of his arms up as a guard and managed to withstand Lou Cheng’s charge. One could clearly see obvious burnt holes in their uniforms and their silhouettes covered in dust and dirt.</p><p>Ssk!</p><p>Long Zhe was forcefully pushed back several meters from the impact and left two obvious marks on the floor. His momentum against Lou Cheng had finally been turned.</p><p>Pa! Without moving away first, Long Zhen had already executed a low kick. It was the same for Lou Cheng too. Within a tight space, the two of them exchanged elbow strikes, knee smash, grabbling attacks or holds. Explosions were frequent as they fought as dangers were lurking in instances. They were both walking on the edge of knives with their attacks.</p><p>Bam bam bam!</p><p>The consecutive close combat exchanges made both of them felt satisfied. Combining his intuition for danger with “Enemy Heart Freezing Move” to react, Lou Cheng wasn’t showing any weakness against Long Zhen.</p><p>The Fire Sect’s physical invulnerability expert, who wasn’t naturally talented in this aspect, was at a disadvantage. Although Long Zhen also possessed the “All Seeing God” realm that allowed him to detect all minuscule things that were happening in a certain area around him, he was still inferior in comparison.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Lou Cheng smashed his forearm backwards but was caught by Long Zhen. Following the momentum, Long Zhen took two steps back. Tensing his left leg, he ignited a thin layer of golden flame as he swung his leg towards Lou Cheng.</p><p>Just as Lou Cheng was about to lift his leg to deflect the attack with attack, sounds of “Internal Explosion” seemed to sound from the incoming leg of Long Zhen. His kick changed direction creepily and landed heavily in front of Lou Cheng in advance.</p><p>The fifteen move of Fire Sect, “Jet Spray” was originally derived from the second move of the Physical Invulnerability Chapter, “Godly Golden Flames”!</p><p>Dong!</p><p>As Long Zhen stomped onto the ground, the floor shook and the surrounding sparks gathered below Lou Cheng. They exploded below Lou Cheng like an erupting volcano shooting into the sky.</p><p>Despite seemingly in a passive defending position, he had already laid the steps for a counterattack. His experiences in battle could be easily seen from this!</p><p>Lou Cheng was about to execute his move when he was suddenly forced to face this situation. The “Fire Dragon” from the surrounding was rising from below and about to engulf his whole body.</p><p>He retreated quickly and did a somersault in mid-air. After the scorching red fire dragon raged up for some time, it finally scraped Lou Cheng’s calves as it shot upwards. Eventually, the flames exploded in the air like fireworks.</p><p>As Lou Cheng was trying to gain that split moment of time, he formed Ice Armor over his leg. Water was dripping from the melting ice but quickly vaporized.</p><p>The edge of his pants still had some lingering fire sparks. However, this weren’t enough to harm him as Lou Cheng was highly resistant to heat.</p><p>Lou Cheng landed firmly on both legs when Long Zhen pounced over. Long Zhen had opened up both of his arms in coordination with the eruption of his Dan force and struck Lou Cheng with consecutive violent and tightly connected blows. Each and every one of Long Zhen’s muscles showcased the beauty of his strength. He looked capable of destroying everything!</p><p>Bam bam bam!</p><p>Lou Cheng executed Force Concentration and simplified “Fighting Formula” interchangeably in response. His shoulders were pulled constantly as he threw punches accurately with techniques to disperse strength to withstand the crazy barrage of attacks from his opponent.</p><p>Against the monstrous strength, Lou Cheng’s fists, arms and elbows gradually began going numb from the beating. His legs were moving back as they couldn’t withstand the blows but he wasn’t able to shake off the attacks.</p><p>Amidst the Fire-like invasion, the surrounding temperature was getting higher and higher. If anyone breathed, their windpipes would be burn. Lou Cheng’s vision was affected, and whatever he saw seemed to be distorting.</p><p>Bam bam bam! Once Long Zhen gained the upper hand, the attacks didn’t seem like they would stop before defeating his opponent.</p><p>The area below Lou Cheng was sinking in as sand and gravel was sent flying away. Long Zhen’s unique characteristic of height seemed to be growing more apparent with his opponent only able to look up.</p><p>There’s no surprise that he’s a first-pin expert… As Lou Cheng struggled to keep up, he suddenly had this thought.</p><p>However, with his Ice Mirror formed, such emotions seemed to sink into the reflection of the lake without leaving a trace.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>It was another barrage of attacks from Long Zhen. Lou Cheng cuffs were getting burned as his hands shivered and left deep footprints on the floor when he stomped on the ground.</p><p>Making a stride and cutting in, Long Zhen retracted his breathing and instantly exploded it. He raised his left arm and smashed down again with a punch fully powered with Fire Force.</p><p>At this moment, Lou Cheng opened up his left hand. Pressing his thumb ahead, he shot out a crystal-clear and sharp chilling light towards the head of his opponent at the speed of a bullet.</p><p>“Ice Spirit Holy Light Diagram”!</p><p>Long Zhen seemed to have predicted the move in advance. All he did was tilt his head to one side and allowed the chilling light to miss. It didn’t affect the series of attacks from his left fist.</p><p>Seeing this, Lou Cheng flipped his wrist and turned the chilling light from piercing to slicing towards his opponent’s neck. At the same time, he pulled his other shoulder back. This shifted his body to face Long Zhen sideways and avoided Long Zhen’s smashing blow.</p><p>Pa. Long Zhen seemed to have shrunken by a segment. It was as though his brain had been sucked into his abdomen just like how a tortoise would react when it sensed danger. However even so, his explosion of Dan force did not stop. Shaking his right arm a little, he turned it into a whipping blow and sent it towards Lou Cheng.</p><p>Lou Cheng executed Force Concentration again and struck the forearm of his opponent with an elbow strike.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>He felt just like a kite under the mercy of violent winds as he was sent flying back. Long Zhen was about to give chase and deny him the opportunity to hide his trails with snow and wind. However, he felt a chill cruising through his body and his thoughts had slowed temporarily.</p><p>Lou Cheng had used “Ice Spirit Holy Light Sword” to gain the opportunity for him to use Severe Warning!</p><p>As Lou Cheng landed, he swayed before gaining control over his centre of gravity. The next instant, he seemed to have turned into the snow and wind as he broke free from Long Zhen’s suffocating and highly invasive high pressured attacks.</p><p>Unable to finish the battle after a long time, Long Zhen appeared to be getting a little frustrated. He was no longer reserving his strength. As their fists collided, he gradually gathered a ball of faint golden flame. After another several exchanges, he created another ball of dazzling white and scorching hot flames separately.</p><p>The three fireballs revolved around his body and each had its own unique colour. This made him look just like a deity that had descended from the Heavens.</p><p>In ancient times, mortals who had not seen many things might have just paid homage to him!</p><p>The reason why “Nine Rotations of Five Flames. Descend Of The Sun” was a final unique skill of the Fire Sect was because it allowed one to accumulate strength while fighting normally. It allowed five different flames to revolve around oneself without exploding immediately. When all the preparations were in place, one could choose the timing to execute the move as he wishes without any limitations.</p><p>Naturally, this was highly exhaustive to one’s mental strength would take a huge toll.</p><p>Seeing that Long Zhen had formed three flames, Lou Cheng’s heart skipped a beat. He felt that he couldn’t allow him to continue to prepare his attacks.</p><p>Amidst the wind and snow, he rapidly retracted his breathing and blood flow. Moving that dots of stars, he triggered the “Fighting” Formula</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Releasing his breathing and blood flow, his body suddenly grew larger. His martial arts suit was getting tight as exaggerated muscles could be seen.</p><p>At this moment, Lou Cheng was no longer much shorter than Long Zhen. Making a huge stride with a cross punch, he hit towards the side of his opponent. He wanted to use the most intense shockwave to trigger the explosion of a fireball.</p><p>At this moment, Long Zhen suddenly revealed a sly and satisfied smile. The scorching red, faint gold and dazzling white flames all flew and gathered at the edge of his punch.</p><p>He had no intention of using an “ultimate move” after gathering all “five flames”!</p><p>Whatever he did previously was to lure Lou Cheng into taking the initiative to attack!</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The earth shook and dust in the shape of a mushroom rose. A rather shallow pothole appeared on the ground and there were signs of burning all around.</p><p>Lou Cheng had his eyes closed. After crushing the first round of attacks, he was badly shaken from the resulting impact.</p><p>As for Long Zhen, he didn’t give Lou Cheng any chance to catch a breather. He forcefully broke through the “Flame waves”, closed up the distance before executing another round of “Fire-like invasion” attacks.</p><p>The negative state of his body had accumulated to the point where Force Concentration could no longer remove them completely. Lou Cheng wasn’t able to withstand this round of attack as his guard was broken and he almost spat out blood.</p><p>“Long Zhen wins!” Ning Zitong, who was standing afar, announced the results carefreely.</p><p>Lou Cheng took a deep breath and could feel the burning sensation in his throat. Long Zhen kept his posture and laughed heartily, “Refreshing!”</p><p>After recalling the battle, Lou Cheng noted that he had gained a lot from this battle. He walked towards the edge and was met with the Dragon King’s gaze.</p><p>Chen Qitao nodded his head slightly and said, “Approaching second-pin.”</p><p>Hmm. Not too bad! When I have fully mastered the Physical Invulnerability Chapters of the Ice and Fire Sect, together with my techniques developed from combining the path of martial arts and Cultivation that I didn’t use previously, my battle strength would definitely increase substantially… At the thought of this, the bottled up feelings he had after losing cleared up immediately.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
