Lou Cheng was shocked but didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Nonetheless, he understood what they meant.</p><p>England truly knows how to be passive aggressive with officiality… I bet Duke Humphrey’s is rolling in his grave.</p><p>Auman glanced at Lou Cheng furtively before quickly adding,</p><p>“But most of the other countries have approved your visa applications. Other than England, only Gaul has rejected.”</p><p>“It shouldn’t be a problem then.” Lou Cheng nodded slowly. He treated it as a joke when he told Yan Zheke about it.</p><p>Highly destructive weapons!</p><p>As long as I can get to Europe, where in Europe could keep me out?</p><p>The tiny strait between England and Europe can’t stop me. I can get past that walking on the water!</p><p>Afterwards, Lou Cheng refocused his energy on his rigorous training. Each day, he made sure to take time off to spar with trainers who had awakened electric or magnetic supernatural abilities, requesting that they emulate the battle styles of Shangqing Sect.</p><p>The following professional league match would somewhat determine the World Champion for that year.</p><p>On the day Yan Zheke flew to Brutale, Lou Cheng saw Empress Luo. She was wearing a navy blue martial arts suit as he walked out of the training ground wiping his sweat.</p><p>“Take a shower and pack your stuff. We’re heading out tonight.” The charming, beautiful senior gave a faint smile with her instructions.</p><p>This weekend? It’s already time to head North to Hudong to challenge the Shangqing Sect? Lou Cheng, who had been totally engrossed in his training, suddenly felt like a long time had passed, though it was just a short period.</p><p>“Okay.” Lou Cheng cleared his head and answered seriously.</p><p>After washing away the stickiness of his body and soothing his mental fatigue with warm water, Lou Cheng quickly packed, then heading to the Physical Invulnerability expert cafeteria to enjoy his dinner. He didn’t have to head back home; the clothing he had at the club was enough.</p><p>At 6:30 in the evening, Lou Cheng and Auman saw the bus.</p><p>He swept it with his eyes as he boarded, making sure everything was clear.</p><p>Dragon King, Chen Qitao was sitting next to the window on the first row. He leaned back with his eyes closed, seemingly resting, expressionless and silent.</p><p>His current assistant, Huang Zhenghong, sat opposite of him dressed in a neat suit, distant enough to avoid the pressure of being too close.</p><p>The coach, Lu Yan, sat in the second row from the back. The details of his deep, handsome features of his face seemed to have been meticulously sculpted. The wrinkles on him as well as the couple with snow-white hair exhibited elderly wisdom and charisma.</p><p>He maintained his usual solemn expression as he conversed with his personal assistant, who was wearing half-frame spectacles and looked quite lawyer-like.</p><p>Lou Cheng, who had been paying attention to the Longhu Club over the years, knew not to be fooled by the serious look of Lu Yan. After defeating an opponent, Lu Yan was often overwhelmed by his energy and had even been known to taunt. Sometimes he charged into the spectator seats of his opponent to celebrate wildly.</p><p>This didn’t just happen when he was young and immature, but had already happened twice this year.</p><p>Ning Zitong, who had changed into a long dress, was sitting with her disciple Guo Jie in the middle. One of them was talking about women’s things while the other one perfunctorily agreed. Their assistants were seated nearby handling their individual matters.</p><p>Lou Cheng nodded his head in greeting, choosing a window seat. Auman and Guo Jie’s assistant, Wang Yuexi, found each other chatted softly.</p><p>Several minutes later, the bus started. It drove straight out of town onto the highway and headed north.</p><p>Although they were heading north, Hudong wasn’t too far north. Not only was it not as north as the Guanwai League, they didn’t even have to cross the Changjiang. In fact, it would be just beside Guangnan. Based on the habits of the people in Huacheng, anywhere north of Huacheng would be considered the North.</p><p>Because of this, they wouldn’t have to take the high-speed rail and could head there by themselves.</p><p>Switching between two drivers, ny midnight the group had arrived at the Sky Thunder Mountain where Shangqing Sect was. After resting in the hotel for a few hours, Lou Cheng and the others began their practice. Because the big match was soon, they didn’t spar.</p><p>After a day of adjustment, they boarded the bus at two in the afternoon and circled their way up the mountain.</p><p>This trip was full of twists and turns with thin layers of ice decorating the forest trees. On one side was a steep mountain cliff and on the other was a bottomless pit. It was a dangerous landscape, but everything was lush and peaceful.</p><p>After passing by the Wangsong checkpoint, there were eight disciples of Shangqing Sect in blue monk robes carrying long swords. In the past, this place was known as the Disarming Cliff. Whenever a visitor came, they would have to leave their weapons behind before continuing up the mountain.</p><p>This wasn’t an issue for martial artists whose bodies were their weapons, but just a formality.</p><p>The eight disciples stood side by side and greeted the members of Longhu Club.</p><p>Ning Zitong broke her gaze from outside the window. After flipping through the newspaper that her assistant had bought, she said bitterly,</p><p>“The newspapers nowadays are getting worse. After the advertisements, it’s just more advertisements. In the past, a battle like this would have taken up the entire front page. From the layout of the homeground, to the recent matchups and results, to the sensationalizing content, everything would be there and the writing would be great. But now…” She sighed, “There’s still a special column, but you can tell not much effort was put in. It’s the bare minimum.”</p><p>“We are in the age of ‘we media.’ Media websites are slacking off and don’t make their own content. They mostly just redistribute the works of others. The newspaper isn’t an exception,” Lou Cheng answered from behind them.</p><p>As for the comments online, they were mainly about Dragon King being too arrogant and too rash.</p><p>At times like this, allowing Long Zhen to go off with a victory would be the smartest thing to do!</p><p>Otherwise, the plan is risky and the chances aren’t high.</p><p>“The changes over the last ten years are significant.” Ning Zitong heaved a sigh and changed the topic, “Shangqing Sect has requested for no audience this time. I’m afraid they are up to something.”</p><p>“They probably want to increase their homeground advantage,” answered Lu Yan without surprise.</p><p>Since boarding the bus, Chen Qitao’s eyes had been closed without expression, like a wooden sculpture. As for Guo Jie, she was going through the competition videos of several experts of Shangqing Sect before the competition, keeping her from interacting with the others.</p><p>The bus passed the Disarming Cliff and the Five Immortal turn to arrive at the carpark outside Shangqing Sect.</p><p>With Chen Qitao at the front, the other members of Longhu followed. The reporters who had been waiting there snapped photos videos frantically.</p><p>After entering the doors of Shangqing Sect, Auman and the other assistants followed Priest Zhike to have tea while the Physical Invulnerability experts continued the journey upwards through the yard and stone steps to the peak of the mountain.</p><p>This place got its name from being struck by lightning multiple times over the years. There wasn’t even any accumulated snow, just rocky, barren land.</p><p>As he approached, Lou Cheng could feel that the ring on his finger was affected by the magnetic field as the magnetic field tugged.</p><p>Nonetheless, this wasn’t the main issue. The issue was that the usually empty peak now had nine thick electric poles. Strands and strands of high voltage electric cables were connected from the top to the bottom.</p><p>At the top of the central high voltage line there was a Taoist priest wearing a white robe. His hair was tied suavely into a bun and his clothing moved with the wind giving him a carefree air. He was none other than Warrior Sage, Qian Donglou.</p><p>Chen Qitao suddenly opened his eyes wide, looked over, and locked eyes with him.</p><p>An electric spark flickered in the air. It hit a formless tree and began burning in faint purple flames which turned into small snakes that dissipated, leaving countless burn marks.</p><p>Dragon King, Chen Qitao continued moving ahead. There was a place was at the edge of the mountain cliff with several round prayer mats for the guests to sit.</p><p>Everything here had the simple and ancient feel of a battle a hundred years ago, but the thick electric cables and poles interrupted the view and ambiance.</p><p>“So they are using high voltage electricity,” Ning Zitong laughed.</p><p>But there was a hint of graveness in her eyes.</p><p>After nodding his head at Peng Leyun as greeting, Lou Cheng sat with his legs crossed and listened to Coach Lu Yan say,</p><p>“Warrior Sage intends to fight first. Although our chances are higher if we break his momentum before letting Dragon King fight against him, I’m afraid that the setup today would make him unstoppable. At the same time, with the momentum he gathered in his victory, it wouldn’t be easy to finish him off. Therefore, it would be better if Dragon King is the first to fight.”</p><p>“Great.” Dragon King nodded his head in approval.</p><p>There were purple flames raging in his eyes.</p><p>Lu Yan turned around, looked at Lou Cheng and asked suddenly,</p><p>“Are you confident?”</p><p>“Huh?” Lou Cheng didn’t react.</p><p>What kind of question is that?</p><p>Lu Yan stepped forward and looked straight into his eyes before repeating with his low voice,</p><p>“If you are unconfident or fearful, then I myself will participate!”</p><p>Lou Cheng straightened his back and answered decisively,</p><p>“I’m confident.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
