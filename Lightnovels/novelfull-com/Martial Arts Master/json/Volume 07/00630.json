The hottest news recently focused on Lou Cheng’s age. She remembered Lou Cheng’s age: 22 years and seven months old. He just got his Bachelor’s degree!</p><p>He’s married?</p><p>Is it with that beautiful girl I had seen previously?</p><p>Although eighteen years old was the age limit in China, there weren’t many couples who got married at such a young age. This was regardless if they were taking the academic route or the path of martial arts!</p><p>On the Core Team, Empress Luo and Coach Lu seemed to have partners. However, she joined the profession late and wasn’t too clear of the situation with her seniors. As for the other three physical invulnerability experts, rumors had it that Dragon King was the kind that didn’t believe in marriage. However, he had a fixed female partner that would last approximately a year each. To put it simply, Dragon King and his partners weren’t into relationships and were just satisfied their needs. After which, they would split up. As for Optimus Prime, Long Zhen, he used to have a girlfriend. However, they had broken up a long time ago. Rumors had it that he was more interested to fulfil his biological needs through transactions and had placed all his attention into getting his first title.</p><p>As for the Martial Arts Fanatic, Guo Jie, one could easily tell from her nickname that not only did she not have a husband, but she didn’t have a boyfriend or even a pet.</p><p>As the thoughts flashed passed her mind, Auman suddenly felt that she was getting worked up over something small.</p><p>An atypical man wouldn’t act this way!</p><p>As a Heavenly son of the era and a physical invulnerability expert below the age of 23, it was completely normal for Mr. Lou to do things differently than others!</p><p>Yeah! It wasn’t reported on the news, so there aren’t many people who know about it. This shows that Mr. Lou doesn’t wish for this to spread. It is at least the case for now. I must keep this as a secret!</p><p>After having these thoughts, Auman looked at the staff member again. She was somewhere between forty and fifty years old. Auman felt a little relief after noticing that the woman wasn’t acting strangely.</p><p>This should be an auntie that doesn’t pay too much attention to the martial arts circle!</p><p>Moreover, the other party in the transaction is a real estate company under Longhu. One will not be able to see the relationship from the surface. Moreover, Mr. Lou had only revealed his name here and not any other information…</p><p>“Good afternoon, What other information do I need to prepare?” Auman lowered her head and asked sincerely.</p><p>“Which intermediary are you from? You don’t even know about these?” After nagging for a while, the staff still explained to her what information was missing.</p><p>Auman took down notes before sending a message to Lou Cheng, explaining that this requirement was to prevent a party in a marriage hiding one’s after-marriage assets.</p><p>This is my first time buying a property and I really do not know about this requirement… Disregarding others, I have even forgotten about the marriage certificate. That’s really dumb of me… Lou Cheng who happened to be taking a break from training was embarrassed. While chatting with his wife, he told her about it and caused her to break into laughter for several minutes.</p><p>Auman had made a wasted trip today. The next morning, she had all the information readied and finally finished the paperwork to transfer the title of the house. She collected the certificate on the spot before contacting the Logistics Team to get someone to do a deep cleaning of the house.</p><p>After finishing all these matters, she returned to the Longhu Club and encountered the supervisor of the Assistant Team, Au Deyang.</p><p>“Just back from outside?” asked Au Deyang amiably.</p><p>“Yeah, I was helping Mr Lou with the title of his new house.,” answered Auman in a simple manner.</p><p>Au Deyang broke into laughter upon hearing what Auman said. “You have to change your mindset! You don’t have to do these things by yourself and can order others in the office to do it for you. If you encounter any issues, give the External Affairs Team a call. They have a strong relationship with the government. As long as it isn’t too big of a problem, they would be able to solve it.”</p><p>“I, I really haven’t thought of it. Thank you leader for your guidance!” The words struck Auman as she discovered her problem instantly.</p><p>I’m still acting like before when I’m handling the matters of a physical invulnerability expert!</p><p>However, it would be better if I handle some of these things by myself. Take this incident as an example. If I had called the External Affairs Team or any other person, it would be a grave mistake if they leaked this matter out! Auman thought to herself.</p><p>Au Deyang nodded his head in approval and continued, “There’s a banquet tonight for people in the political and business circle and they have specially invited Mr. Lou to congratulate him for advancing to physical invulnerability. You can ask if he will be free later. If he isn’t, you will have to represent him. If you don’t have any suitable clothing, go to the Finance Team to ask for an advance for clothing allowance.”</p><p>“Alright!” The image of her wearing elegant clothes and attracting attention in the upper-class circle’s banquet flashed passed her mind.</p><p>She suddenly understood a saying that many had told her before. Sometimes, a personal assistant is also the representative of a physical invulnerability expert. They will be qualified to stand beside the wealthy people.</p><p>It seemed like being such an assistant will be a really hectic job…</p><p>…</p><p>Auman thought that she would be leading a hectic and fulfilling life. However, since that banquet, she realized that she had become a very free person. She almost had nothing to do for most of the day.</p><p>As for the reason behind it, it was simple and Auman could understand it clearly. Yet, there’s nothing she could do about it.</p><p>Since the start of September until mid-October, Mr. Lou had been leading a simple and repetitive life. He would wake up at five in the morning and have his morning practice along the Xiapei Lake until about seven-forty in the morning. After bathing, he would take the nanny car back to the club and have his breakfast in the restaurant for physical invulnerability members. At nine o’clock sharp, he would enter the Isolation Zone to practice his technique. At eleven, he would take a short break in the resting room on the fifth storey until twelve-thirty in the afternoon or a little later. After lunch, he would take a short nap and then restart his training at approximately two in the afternoon. Sometimes he would end at four o’clock and leave early to try various kinds of food in the city while other times, he would train until five-thirty and head home after having dinner.</p><p>Days like this happened over and over. One could really describe it as asceticism!</p><p>Auman was counting what she had done over the past month with her fingers:</p><p>Following Mr. Lou on the nanny car to the club and sending him home; helping him book two-way plane tickets to and from Connecticut; redoing his visa that allowed him to stay there for five days; booked a plane ticket to Gaofen once and a train ticket from Gaofen to Xiushan; checked on the effects of the deep cleaning that was done on the bungalow; represent Mr. Lou at two banquets; made appointment with the cleaning companies under Longhu to clean his bungalow every two days; booked various restaurants around Huacheng; connected with the property and logistic team to send the utilities bills over directly…</p><p>I have only done this in a month!</p><p>This made her a little worried as she felt shameful to collect a salary of over thirty thousand.</p><p>Luckily, Auman also found something to keep her occupied. That was reading and learning. Based on what the supervisor said, a personal assistant of a physical invulnerability expert didn’t have to be an expert but definitely must be capable of different chores and know a little about everything so as to react to different situations. Taking the previous personal assistant of Dragon King as an example, he had enrolled himself into the business school in Huacheng and had now become Dragon King’s representative as the director of several companies.</p><p>After putting down the book, she massaged her shoulders and glanced at the Physical Invulnerability training room. Lou Cheng wasn’t out yet.</p><p>If Mr. Lou didn’t go out and try different restaurants around Huacheng, I will also suspect if he is a robot. Other than martial arts, he has no other hobbies! Perhaps he was a serious Otaku and only know how to find entertainment online… As Auman was letting her imagination run wild, she suddenly saw Ning Zitong walking over gracefully. Her hair was tied up and she was wearing a loose martial arts suit.</p><p>“Empress Luo.,” greeted Auman. “Good afternoon.”</p><p>Ning Zitong smiled gently and laughed, “He’s not out yet?”</p><p>“It should be soon. Mr. Lou had a dinner appointment at five-thirty and had to leave early. The demand at the place is a little more serious than others.,” Auman answered honestly.</p><p>Ning Zitong smiled before continuing, “In that case, postpone it for him. He shouldn’t be able to make it now.”</p><p>“Huh…” Auman was completely lost.</p><p>……</p><p>Within the Physical Invulnerability training room, the external areas were places for training. Lou Cheng was practicing his punches and kicks.</p><p>As he moved his fists and legs, balls of fire rose up around his body. One was scorching red, one was dazzling white, one was light blue, one was golden and the last one was faint purple in colour. They were revolving around him and seemed to form a single entity.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Lou Cheng struck with his punch and the five fireballs suddenly merged and quickly collapsed.</p><p>Bright blinding light arose. Following which, violent wind and raging flames expanding outwards, sent shocks to the hall made of metal and shook it fiercely. There were even signs of severe burning in several spots.</p><p>“This “Nine Rotations of Five Flames. Descend Of The Sun” still felt a little off. I can’t say that I have fully understood it…” Lou Cheng retracted his guard and heaved a sigh.</p><p>Time was indeed a little tight as he did not have the assistance like the “Polar Laboratory” in Ice God Sect.</p><p>He walked back and forth a few times as he pondered the details within it. Suddenly, he recalled the ninth move of Ice Sect, “Titanic Starlit Skies – Absolute Frost”.</p><p>This unique skill couldn’t be considered as complete and felt like something was missing. Taking reference from it and leveraging on the mutations brought from achieving balance to form Dan, I have created the “Lament of the Ice Queen”. In that case, can I also use such train of thoughts to gain control over the Fire Sect’s ninth move, “Nine Rotations of Five Flames. Descend Of The Sun”?</p><p>Just as Lou Cheng was about to delve deeper, he recalled that he had some other arrangement today. He took out his phone and glanced at it. After clearing the dust from his clothing, he walked towards the exit.</p><p>He entered the password and passed through several heavy doors. At the end of the doors, he saw Auman and Ning Zitong at the same time.</p><p>“Sister Ning, why are you here?” asked Lou Cheng with surprise.</p><p>“How is it?” How’s your practice of the Physical Invulnerability Chapters?” asked Ning Zitong as she did not answer Lou Cheng’s questions directly.</p><p>“I have preliminary understanding for all of them but there are still a few moves that I can’t say I understand well.,” answered Lou Cheng honestly.</p><p>Over the last month, he did not participate in any activities of the Core Team and had put all his attention into mastering the Physical Invulnerability Chapters of the Fire Sect. From time to time, he would seek advice with Coach Lu Yan. He discovered that this bad-tempered old coach was extremely good in coaching and had his own unique ways. The training of physical invulnerability experts was typically separated as they each had their own training grounds.</p><p>Ning Zitong smiled faintly before saying, “That’s pretty fast.”</p><p>After which, she changed the topic and continued, “It’s the preliminaries of the Master rounds in another week. Let’s spar today so you can gain a better mastery in real battles and make sure you aren’t be rusty in your movements.”</p><p>Spar? Sparring within the Core Team? Sparring with other physical invulnerability experts? As these thoughts flashed passed his mind, the image of a stern and majestic Dragon King popped up unknowingly.</p><p>“Alright.” He nodded his head while still feeling a little shaken.</p><p>Ning Zitong smiled and nodded her head.</p><p>“Let’s go then. Our battles aren’t too suitable for indoors. Hehe. No one will be left out this time. Six of us will be just nice!”</p><p>After giving instructions to Auman to cancel the appointment, Lou Cheng followed Ning Zitong, left by the back door of the building and arrived at the other side of the lake. There were several potholes on the ground that were clearly burnt. In some places, one could even see glass that was formed after the soil melted and re-coagulated.</p><p>As they walked on for a while, Lou Cheng saw the Dragon King, Chen Qitao, who was standing proudly with both of his hands behind his back.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
