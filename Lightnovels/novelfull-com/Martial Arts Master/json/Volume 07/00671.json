The main fighters are usually the Dragon King, Long Zhen, and myself. But I’m not young anymore, so I’ll have to start making choices. I need to conserve my strength for one or two title tournaments every year. Heh, I’ve only attended Master Battle and Battle of the Kings this year. Plus, I rarely participate consecutively in the pro matches. Most of the time, I take turns with Lü Yan.”</p><p>Most top-tier pros, with the exception of monsters like Dong Baxian, Lu Yongyuan, and some others, rationally give up on many battles when they reach forty. They conserve their power for half, or even an entire year, to fight for the ultimate honor.</p><p>Only by doing so do they have a higher chance of advancing past formidable foes. But even so, their efforts often go to waste as they fall to the Dragon King or Warrior Sage.</p><p>Since the dawn of the Legendary Twins era, two was the most titles anyone had one in a year. Usually, it was one. Once in a blue moon, none. This was the case even as Chen Qitao and Qian Donglou often whittled down each other’s strength before the grand finals.</p><p>“My silly disciple, Guo Jie, usually fights the unimportant matches in a pro match, or subs in when someone’s injured. At her current state, she can barely hold her own. In many other factions, she’s good enough to be on the main team. But with Longhu, our eyes were set on being the first in China.” Her heart ached as she went on. “I’m not saying that her efforts are useless, or that her fanatical attitude towards martial arts is misguided. In another eight to ten years, she could very well become a First Pin. However, we are in a situation where time is of the essence.”</p><p>Ning Zitong paused and gave Lou Cheng a thoughtful look.</p><p>“In the path of martial arts, talent really matters.”</p><p>“The Dragon King is crowned with praises like ‘a man with terrifying self-discipline,’ but don’t let that fool you. His talent is only lacking when compared to the Warrior Sage. There isn’t any substantial difference in talent between him and any other titled top-tier experts, including me. But that, coupled with his unparalleled competitiveness and fearsome vigor, allow him to rival the Warrior Sage.”</p><p>Her disciple, on the other hand, might take ten years to advance from Second Pin to First Pin. She herself would be in her forties by then. But the young man before her might need two years or less to enter the line of potential title contenders.</p><p>This was the gap between them, a gap that couldn’t be overcome with a lifetime of effort.</p><p>“I have mastered the basics of the Physical Invulnerability Chapters of my kung fu.” Lou Cheng made his stand in brief words. Then, perplexed, asked,</p><p>“Doesn’t Long Zhen’s contract end in January? If so, can’t he attend the other three pro matches?”</p><p>Ning Zitong chuckled.</p><p>“You think the Dragon King would let him?”</p><p>She mimicked Dragon King’s voice,</p><p>“Didn’t you want to prove your importance? Then I, the Dragon King, shall let you know how insignificant you are. As long as I’m here, victory is assured.”</p><p>“Hmm…that sounds a little out of character…” The inner fanboy in Lou Cheng voiced his objections subconsciously.</p><p>The words surely fitted the Dragon King’s style. However, with the Dragon King’s disposition and dominant CEO-aura, he would never say such things.</p><p>Not that he didn’t want to, but because he didn’t deign to!</p><p>What makes you think you are worthy enough for me to say such words to you, Long Zhen?</p><p>“Haha,” Ning Zitong laughed drily. “You get my point. Anyways, Long Zhen’s out of the next three pro matches, so you better prepare to be on the main team. You can’t let elderlies like Lü Yan and I do all the work, right? Plus, Lü Yan probably won’t be joining the upcoming match this weekend, since he got injured in the Battle of Kings. He can still fight, but it’s honestly better if he doesn’t.”</p><p>“This weekend…aren’t we heading to Hudong to challenge Shangqing Sect this weekend?” recalled Lou Cheng.</p><p>Not to mention it was the crucial match that would decide the champion of top-tier professional matches this year!</p><p>As expected, the Dragon King was confident.</p><p>“Don’t worry. On their side, Yun He is injured, which leaves two Second Pins,” replied Ning Zitong with a smile. “But, since we are facing some problems too, she may fight despite her injuries.”</p><p>Under normal circumstances, the Shangqing Sect’s main team was made of the Warrior Sage, the three times title-holder Taoist Sect Master, and the strong contender for titles, Taoist Yun Yan. They were evenly matched against the Dragon King, Empress Luo, and Long Zhen. Both teams, having the combination of one of the Legendary Twins and two super-class fighters, were the annual favorites for the top-tier Professional League.</p><p>Below them, there were Daxing Temple, Yanzhao League, Shushan Study, and Xinghai Club. They mainly contended for the third spot. However, in the past ten years, there were times when they made it to the grand finals, and even times when they took the highest glory home. In short, they were nothing to be scoffed at.</p><p>Lou Cheng nodded slowly. “Got it. I’ll prepare myself.”</p><p>He would have to pore over the files and videos of the Mighty Ones of Shangqing Sect.</p><p>Spirited, he left the office. Just as he was about to turn in the direction of his room, he suddenly saw Long Zhen near the escalator along the corridor.</p><p>He was over 2.1m tall, had bronze skin, a shiny bald head, and wore a loose martial arts uniform. His presence alone was intimidating.</p><p>Right now, he looked relaxed. His aura, alive and agile, was like a bird that had been released back to nature after a long imprisonment.</p><p>Not expecting to run into him, Lou Cheng felt a little awkward. He didn’t know what to say or what his attitude should be.</p><p>“Good morning,” said Long Zhen with a laugh.</p><p>He gave Lou Cheng a deep look from above.</p><p>“Five years down the road, I trust that you’ll make the same choice as me,” he said casually.</p><p>“Eh?” Lou Cheng was a little taken aback.</p><p>Long Zhen stepped into the open elevator. Turning his massive body around, he said, pensively,</p><p>“Because we are both perpetually proud beings.”</p><p>The elevator door shut slowly between him and Lou Cheng’s. Lou Cheng stared blankly for a moment. Suddenly, he recalled something his Master once said:</p><p>“The best way to worship a martial artist is to catch up to him, stand before him, and defeat him!”</p><p>Long Zhen had always been eager to challenge the Dragon King, despite getting his ass handed to him every time. Perhaps, deep inside, he secretly worshipped the Dragon King.</p><p>Lou Cheng sighed pensively. Returning to his room, he switched on the computer and began watching Warrior Sage’s recent matches.</p><p>That was when he remembered his initial plans to go to Europe.</p><p>Well, there goes my plan. Thank god I never mentioned it to Ke Ke, or else I’d just disappoint her again. Forget the visa too, I won’t be needing it for a while. Eh, but maybe I should get it done anyway. It will save me trouble if I need it in the future.</p><p>Thoughts racing, he texted Auman, asking her to help him acquire visas to a number of European countries.</p><p>At present, Europe was a scattered union, so one visa couldn’t bring him everywhere.</p><p>…</p><p>While Lou Cheng was busy with training, Auman went to the European embassies in Huacheng. For the ones without a brick-and-mortar, she submitted the application online.</p><p>When the visa officers received the application, the staggering words “Physical Invulnerability” triggered their danger alarm.</p><p>Not daring to act on their own, they reported it to their respective security departments after verifying that the application was submitted by Lou Cheng from the Longhu Club.</p><p>In an office in England, a blue-eyed man with black hair wearing a general rank insignia glanced at the name.</p><p>“Reject!” he said decisively to his assistant.</p><p>“Why?” blurted the assistant, confused.</p><p>Isn’t this too arbitrary? How about a closer inspection?</p><p>Even though it was a Crown Grade Mighty One, it’s not like they hadn’t allowed similar individuals into the borders in the past.</p><p>The general leaned back.</p><p>“You still remember the death of Dark Night Bat, right?”</p><p>“I do. Three Mighty Ones died successively. Sathah was killed when Dark Night Bat and the others ganged up on him. But the identity of the one who was responsible for the following events remains unknown. At that time, the satellite monitoring system didn’t have coverage on this area, so we couldn’t get the photos,” said the assistant thoughtfully.</p><p>“According to Lieutenant General Amon, Lou Cheng was the one who chased the Mummy to Khukhang. We can confirm that he was one of the Mighty Ones in the vicinity at that time, which makes him a suspect,” said the general flatly.</p><p>“But that doesn’t prove anything. Mighty Ones at that stage could cross a desert in a few hours if they wanted to. In that case, the ones in the capital of Nile, Deeka, should be regarded as suspects too,” protested the assistant.</p><p>“Recently, someone put an end to a secret collaboration between America and Japan, killing both Crown Grade experts Number 16 and 18. They only have themselves to blame for incurring China’s revenge, so there isn’t much to talk about that. However, Lou Cheng was involved in that incident,” said the general.</p><p>“I know that. Still, he only played a supportive role,” the assistant was still puzzled.</p><p>The general was getting impatient.</p><p>“Is it that hard to understand? Crown Grade experts are always dying around Lou Cheng, two at a time no less! Compared to the Americans, we have a measly amount of them. Do you want them to all die?”</p><p>“B-but that’s got to be a coincidence, right? We can’t reject his visa application just because he’s a troublemaker!” protested the troubled assistant.</p><p>“At Crown Grade, bad luck isn’t something to be taken lightly. Who knows if it’s a part of his uncanny abilities,” said the general, tapping the table gently. “You understand?”</p><p>“Yes, but what reason do we give? Or do we not give one?” questioned the assistant.</p><p>The general pondered.</p><p>“John Weilburg Accords.”</p><p>“You’re kidding, right?” cried the assistant.</p><p>“No,” the general shook his head. “But, you’ll have to use its full name, of course.”</p><p>Two days later, Auman received a reply. She glanced at Lou Cheng, choosing her words carefully but unsure of how to break the news.</p><p>Sensing her dilemma, Lou Cheng opened his eyes.</p><p>“What is it?” he asked.</p><p>“The England Authority has rejected your visa application,” said Auman softly.</p><p>“What’s the reason?” Lou Cheng asked indifferently, frowning.</p><p>Auman hesitated.</p><p>“John Weilburg Accords on the Prohibition of Weapons of Mass Destruction…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
