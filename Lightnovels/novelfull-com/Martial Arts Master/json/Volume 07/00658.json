She sawed her best friend with messy hair, carrying an electric toothbrush and looked just like she had just woken up.</p><p>“How did the negotiation go?” Auman asked casually.</p><p>“It went pretty well and we have made a preliminary agreement. I will be able to get a sum of bonus again and this is all because of you!” Wang Zi answered with a solemn smile before asking in a nonchalant manner, “So early? Isn’t today a weekend? You still have to work?”</p><p>“I have no weekends whatsoever. If my boss has something going on, I will have to be ready to move. Therefore, I have to maintain a timetable that is similar to his.” Auman didn’t intend to hide and laughed in a self-deprecating manner.</p><p>Nonetheless, over the past few months, Lou Cheng had always chosen to practice in the training ground within his mansion. He has not made any additional instructions or headed out to other places to allow her to enjoy her weekend like any other ordinary employee.</p><p>He’s really a warming boss!</p><p>“Boss? Aren’t you an assistant in the Longhu Club?” Wang Zi grabbed onto the opportunity and asked further.</p><p>Auman paused for several seconds before answering honestly, “Didn’t I say that I got promoted? I’m Lou Cheng, Mr Lou’s, personal assistant currently.”</p><p>“Lou Cheng…” Wang Zi was initially shocked but immediately shrieked, “Physical invulnerability expert! You are a personal assistant to a physical invulnerability expert?</p><p>A person’s name was like a shadow of the tree. Even if she had not paid much attention to the circle of martial arts, she had also frequently heard the names of various physical invulnerability experts. Moreover, Lou Cheng was a Heavenly son of the era who was often in the limelight nowadays.</p><p>“Yeah.” Auman nodded her head seriously.</p><p>Wang Zi was shocked for a few seconds before she heaving a sigh and mumbled, “No wonder…”</p><p>No wonder Auman commanded so much respect!</p><p>She’s a personal assistant to a physical invulnerability expert!</p><p>“Why didn’t you tell me about this earlier?” asked Wang Zi as she woke up from her daze and couldn’t suppress her curiosity.</p><p>Auman revealed a forced smile and continued, “At that time, I felt as though I had struck the lottery. I couldn’t believe it myself and felt like I was in a dream. In fact, that was no different from being in a dream. Subsequently, I have been worried for the following few months and wasn’t confident. I’m afraid of getting sacked right after making my mark. I was thinking of telling you all after I settled down.”</p><p>“You were chosen for unknown reasons?” asked Wang Zi curiously.</p><p>“Yeah.” Recalling back, Auman still couldn’t really believe it was true. “I have been trying to perform diligently in front of Mr. Lou all along. However, he has always been very courteous. Uhm… How should I put it? It’s just that he always keeps a clear distance. When he made the great leap and became a physical invulnerability expert, he chose me to be his assistant. I, I was completely shocked. Do you know that? Completely shocked! And also exhilarated…”</p><p>The feelings she had been suppressing over the past few months had spilled out in one go.</p><p>“No… No special interactions?” Wang Zi felt the same kind of disbelief as Auman previously. She had the feeling that there were some unknown details that played a part.</p><p>It can’t be that such a good thing will really fall from the skies in this world, right?</p><p>Even if it really fall from the skies, why didn’t it land on others and had to be Auman?</p><p>She didn’t really believe that there was something scandalous in it but recalled some articles on well-hidden interview processes. For example, putting the broom back in position after entering through the door or something similar.</p><p>“Hmm… There’s indeed one incident. Didn’t he retire from the club because of grave injuries? I sent him some encouragement messages during that time and also greetings on his birthday and on festivals. It isn’t those that are forwarded from group chats but those with specially crafted content. That’s all I can remember,” answered Auman after pondering.</p><p>“…A kind person would be rewarded! Lou Cheng must have wanted to choose someone with a good character and not those who crowd around those in the limelight while stepping on those who have fallen.” Wang Zi stayed silent for a while and felt that she had found the answer. With a desire to discover more gossips, she asked, “How is he really like in real life?”</p><p>Auman laughed and said, “I have to keep the secrets of my boss confidential. This is the responsibility of a personal assistant!”</p><p>“Yeah. What I can reveal is that he is a really hardworking and down-to-earth man who also takes good care of the people around him.”</p><p>“It’s a shame that he’s taken,” teased Wang Zi before asking again, “How much are you drawing in a month now? Are there any other special benefits?</p><p>Since she knew the authority an inhuman had, she naturally knew that a physical invulnerability expert would be above that.</p><p>As for the personal assistant of a physical invulnerability expert, Auman would definitely not be treated badly.</p><p>Looking at this free three-room apartment and how Auman was able to solve a problem that she deemed impossible through just a phone call, it was easy to tell!</p><p>Auman roughly described her benefits which drew exclaims after exclaims from Wang Zi.</p><p>In the end, Wang Zi took a deep breath and said jokingly, “I can boast to them when I return home now. About how my friend can do this and that and how my classmate is. You are much more awesome than what they have been boasting about!”</p><p>Auman broke into laughter. Seeing that her best friend’s attitude didn’t change, she instantly felt relieved as though she had put down the rock that had been weighing down on her.</p><p>…</p><p>While Lou Cheng was training diligently each day, the end of November was approaching quickly.</p><p>At 8.30pm on November 26, Lou Cheng took the nanny car and arrived at Huacheng Heishui Airport on time to pick up his mom and dad.</p><p>After forty over minutes, he sharply spotted the couple, Qi Fang and Lou Zhisheng. They wore the thick furry clothes that protected them from the chilling Xiushan winter as they looked with bewilderment at the people picking them up, who were only wearing light and thin clothing.</p><p>Lou Cheng walked up with a smile. While explaining to them about the weather in Huacheng, he took over the luggage from the old couple.</p><p>At this moment, Auman and the driver, Zhao Zhenhua, rushed ahead and quickly took over the luggage.</p><p>“Eh, this lady. Let him take it himself. He’s pretty strong,” Qi Fang said courteously quickly.</p><p>“Aunt, this is my job. Could it be you want me to lose my job?” Auman answered in a jokingly manner.</p><p>“This is my assistant, Auman, and my driver, Old Zhao.” introduced Lou Cheng casually.</p><p>Lou Zhisheng adjusted his gold-frames spectacles before saying, “You are acting just like a boss Similar to fatty Guo. However, he called her secretary and not an assistant.”</p><p>“How could fatty Guo be compared with our son? The last time Cheng returned home, he was stuttering when he saw Cheng!” Qi Fang rebutted her husband out of habit.</p><p>As they chatted heartily, the family of three arrived at the underground carpark and boarded the nanny car.</p><p>Seeing the light-brown, real leather seats, a bar with different types of alcohol, a fridge with drinks and the spacious internal space, Lou Zhisheng and Qi Fang were a little shocked. They became a little restrained and didn’t talk much while Auman arranged for them to sit down.</p><p>Seeing this, Lou Cheng shook his head and broke into laughter. Pulling open the fridge door, he passed a bottle of lychee soda from Xiushan for his mom and poured a cup of tea for his father. After which, he sat opposite to them, leaned forward, cross his fingers and found a topic for chatting,</p><p>“Dad, mom, how was it? What’s the feeling of sitting on an airplane?”</p><p>Qi Fang recalled for a while before answering without reserve, “You Dad was really too much. He’s great at talking but not dependable when it comes to really doing it. Before boarding the plane, he was still able to act calmly while collecting his boarding pass and passing through the security clearance. Once the airplane was in the air, he just gripped tightly to both sides. He refused to move, to eat, to drink and to go to the toilet. His body was all tensed up!”</p><p>“Didn’t I get better afterwards?” rebutted Lou Zhisheng unsatisfactorily. There’re outsiders here!</p><p>He glanced at Auman and noticed that she was looking out of the windows and her attention wasn’t there. It was then that he felt a little relieved. Turning around, he exposed Qi Fang, “Your Mum is the one who is really embarrassing. She ran to the economy class cabin to use the toilets and counted how many rows of seats are there on the plane. After which, she wanted me to help her count how many people can be seated on an airplane. Is this even meaningful?”</p><p>“Of course there is! I can’t possibly just closed my eyes and let my time on the airplane fly past! What am I supposed to say when we return to Xiushan and others ask about it?” Qi Fang stared at Lou Zhisheng as she replied.</p><p>Seeing the old couple bickering among themselves, Lou Cheng joined in from time to time. The family of three had a great time together and completely shattered the restraints they felt previously.</p><p>When the car returned to Xiapei Lake and the couple entered Lou Cheng’s mansion, Qi Fang quieted down after taking a look at the decorations and arrangement. When Auman and Old Zhao left, Lou Cheng brought them around the house. After confirming the room they would be staying in, the couple finally felt a little more at ease.</p><p>“It’s so big… but it’s a little too deserted.” Qi Fang sighed.</p><p>Suddenly, she felt like his son had truly grown up and become independent. She was feeling rather happy but also a little melancholic at the thought of her son moving out of the son he grew up from.</p><p>“Deserted? You all can stay here for a little longer!” answered Lou Cheng with a smile.</p><p>“No, no, no. Your dad and I couldn’t leave Xiushan. If we are here, we will just be lonely old people. Zheke and you haven’t even gotten a child yet! Sigh. No, no, no. When the two of you get a child, it would be best for me to help you raise the child. Everything could be said between your mom and the daughter-in-law. If there’s any conflict, just turn around and calm down. That’s how it goes in the dramas that I have watched…” nagged Qi Fang.</p><p>Mum, I’ve only said a sentence and you have already thought about raising kid… Lou Cheng shook his head and diverted the topic.</p><p>The couple had a long trip and quickly went to bed after washing up.</p><p>After the light went off, the room became dark all of a sudden. The wind was rustling outside the window and sounds of water dripping could be heard from afar.</p><p>Qi Fang’s eyes were wide opened as she looked blankly at the ceiling. After a long while, she heaved a sigh and said,</p><p>“Cheng has truly grown up…”</p><p>He’s a man with his own family now.</p><p>A slight curve surfaced on the edge of Lou Zhisheng’s mouth. After pondering for some time, he sighed with a smile, “Because we have both aged.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
