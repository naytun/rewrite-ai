The sense shared between experts was clearly telling him that this was a tough Physical Invulnerability level enemy.</p><p>What made him even more sure was that he hadn’t seen this person in the photos he was shown about Ta Gu and his personnel.</p><p>As these thoughts flashed through his mind, the purple fireball circling Lou Cheng shot out. It passed through the forest towards Ta Gu and landed on where they attempted to escape.</p><p>Lou Cheng signaled to Shadow Hunter, Cheng An, with a look, telling him to follow the original plan.</p><p>Cheng An understood and pulled out a miniature professional camera from the side compartment of his pack.</p><p>Based on the instructions of the Allied HQ, they needed to make a record of the enemy first to provide reliable information for the subsequent stages. After all, Lou Cheng couldn’t guarantee that he would be able to stop a Physical Invulnerability level expert from getting away.</p><p>At this level, as long he wasn’t cornered, it might be easy to win against the enemy, but killing them was harder. Capturing them would be almost impossible.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Purple flames rose and dust was sent into the skies forming clouds. The terrifying explosion stopped Ta Gu and the rest in their tracks as they turned for a different direction.</p><p>That illuminating brilliance revealed the appearance of Talin clearly.</p><p>Kacha! Just as the light dimmed down and the fire flickered, a brief and sudden flash shot into Talin’s eyes, making his pupils contract. He saw the skinny enemy that took his photograph.</p><p>I’ve been captured on camera…As the realization struck Talin, a strong intent to kill welled up inside him.</p><p>As a Physical Invulnerability expert, he would be rather famous within the war-torn zones, and maybe even in intelligence agencies around the world. Even if he wore a disguise, he would not be able to hide with identity verification systems.</p><p>China and America would be able to confirm who was trying to disrupt their operations and who harboured ill intentions against them.</p><p>Although it could be believed that he was acting individually, masking the existence of the organization and their intent, it could still easily lead to complications. As long they had their eyes on him and were on guard, they would inevitably investigate the experts he had good relationships with. No matter who he was, if he was even a little careless, signs of secret collaboration might be discovered and lead to more suspicions.</p><p>Considering China’s and America’s current strength, it would be hard to keep things secret at this stage.</p><p>The best course of action was to kill the pursuers and not let a single enemy return alive.</p><p>However, as soon as Talin’s killing intent showed, it was immediately doused. He pulled Ta Gu back in a hurry and dashed thirty or forty metres to the left.</p><p>Rumble! Rumble! Where the two of them had stood, light blue and dazzling flames raged and expanded as they rose. The flames ignited the broken branches and left behind deep, burnt holes.</p><p>Pfffft. Ta Gu only managed to escape to the side but was hit by the shockwave in mid-air and burnt by the raging flames. He threw up blood.</p><p>Plop! He fell on the ground as the pain hit him.</p><p>If it wasn’t for his strength and extensive training, getting crushed wouldn’t have been unexpected given the distance he fell.</p><p>Talin didn’t dare stop. Pulling Ta Gu along, he made consecutive sharp turns to change his position. He tried to break through several times but was stopped by the cannon fire.</p><p>Then he managed to catch a clear look at his opponent. His heart skipped a beat as he got a sinking feeling.</p><p>Lou Cheng!</p><p>Lou Cheng from China!</p><p>After the formation of the organization and his secret collaboration with it, one of Talin’s duties was to exchange information internally. Therefore, he was no stranger to Physical Invulnerability experts of other factions. He quickly identified his opponent’s identity.</p><p>Within the description of Lou Cheng, the most concerning part to him was:</p><p>“Supernatural ability to sense danger and reflect curses.”</p><p>As one who relied on black magic and evil arts to reach his current Physical Invulnerability level, he feared an opponent such as this the most.</p><p>This meant that half, maybe even more, of his creepy, strange arts would be immediately crippled.</p><p>He knew that any supernatural ability had its limits. The enemy might not be able to completely counter his curses. However, he didn’t want the chance to find out unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>What if I’m wrong?</p><p>What if my curses are really reflected?</p><p>That would be a first, fighting without a hand and then without a leg, too. In that case, I might very well die in this place!</p><p>Talin was born in these war-torn areas, grew up in these war-torn areas, and got stronger in these war-torn areas. He had experienced several perilous situations. As several options popped into his head, he didn’t hesitate and quickly made his decision.</p><p>Run!</p><p>Run as fast as I can!</p><p>Run together with Ta Gu!</p><p>But before he escaped, he had to finish off Ta Gu’s confidants and family. They knew about the secret collaboration.</p><p>As for the jewelry, gold, bonds, and other wealth, he could only give them up. He hoped that his enemies might be distracted by these and give up chasing him.</p><p>As for the unknown future troubles, he could think about those later. Only by living could he even have a future!</p><p>Thud! As he stomped, Talin seemed to have become a weightless, dark cloud. Lifting Ta Gu, he cleverly avoided the bombardment of blue and red fireballs.</p><p>That was when he caught sight of several spider threads flying past him and tangling on a giant, fallen giant tree.</p><p>Following was Smith in his American military attire with his hair neatly combed, appearing from the skies. He shot spider webs with one hand towards Ta Gu’s family, while carrying a professional camera in the other to take pictures of him from the side.</p><p>Treating me like a monkey in a cage. Anger rose from Talin’s heart. He shook his right hand violently and shot out a greyish white fog.</p><p>This fog wasn’t the kind that moved slowly. Once it formed, it immediately pounced towards Smith, forming blurry eyes, ears, a nose, and a mouth as if a face had grown out of the fog.</p><p>Before the fog even got close to him, Smith felt as though he had fallen into an ice cave. His body stiffened and his reactions slowed.</p><p>An unbelievable fear filled his mind as though he had encountered the most terrifying thing in this world. His life felt like it was slipping away uncontrollably.</p><p>At this critical moment, a figure flashed in front of him. He saw Lou Cheng in a navy blue martial arts suit with a faint purple fireball circulating around above and behind his head.</p><p>The purple flames looked heavy and hot. They distorted the surrounding airflow while absorbing the flames around them. Lou Cheng looked like a god that lived high above mortals, or the sun emanating boundless heat and light, looking down silently on the earth.</p><p>Just as the gray, human-faced fog approached, it dissipated like snow melting under the scorching hot sun.</p><p>It let out a pathetic wail and struggled frantically. However, it was rapidly enveloped by the approaching flames and disappeared in mid-air without a trace.</p><p>As the chill faded, Smith felt the blood flow returning to his body.</p><p>“Ah! Ah! Ah!” Pitiful screaming entered his ears. Horrifying images reflected in his eyes.</p><p>Ta Gu’s confidants and families stood dazed in their original spot. Insects were crawling out from their eyes, noses, ears, and mouths. Their bodies quickly turned black as they frantically scratched at their faces, gouging out their eyes. Their skin dried up and cracked open, revealing the white bones and flesh that had foreign items within.</p><p>Their situation was heartbreaking, and they died without knowing why.</p><p>When the insects, snakes, and spiders had crawled over them to collect their scents, the experienced Talin had already made secret moves in preparation for a probable perilous situation.</p><p>Killing to him was already second nature, and he had been coming up with new ways to do it.</p><p>Grabbing onto the opportunity when Lou Cheng saved Smith, Talina triggered his setup. After which, he dashed towards the middle of the deep forest with Ta Gu. He was so confident of the outcome that he didn’t look back once.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>Talin kicked with his feet and moved horizontally to avoid Lou Cheng’s golden fireball.</p><p>Just as he was about to continue running, a small explosion occurred in the golden fireball. It made a beautiful arc and forcefully changed its direction towards Talin.</p><p>Veins appeared on Talin’s calves like long snakes.</p><p>Pfft! Despite being old, he eerily changed his direction and led the golden fireball into the dense forest.</p><p>When Talin moved, Lou Cheng moved. Despite being several tens of meters away, he threw a right punch forward.</p><p>Ssk ssk ssk! His back, his heels, his pores opened up one after another and shot out light blue flames.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Lou Cheng was like an ignited rocket and instantly closed the distance between them. He came to the side of Talin with a momentum that seemed capable of destroying everything.</p><p>Self-created Secret Arts, Counter Jet Spray!</p><p>If he hadn’t already flattened the area with his cannon fire, he wouldn’t have dared to use this move. If he did, he would hit tree after tree, giving his opponent a free chance.</p><p>In the eyes of Talin, the shadow enlarged rapidly and he felt that he couldn’t respond effectively in time.</p><p>He didn’t think twice before lifting Ta Gu to use him as a shield.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Flesh and blood scattered like rain. Crushed heart, broken intestines, deformed stomach and the supper he had previously eaten fell to the ground one after another.</p><p>A drug overlord was split into pieces without ever making a sound. One could forget about ever putting them back together.</p><p>Talin leveraged the force of Lou Cheng and glided back rapidly. As he did so, dark fog gushed out from him. Below the surface of his skin, little dense things wriggled. His hair was like tree vines, out of control as they rapidly grew longer. His skin turned greyish white and lost its lustre, giving the feeling that he had hardened.</p><p>He lifted his head abruptly and his eyes glowed with a dull green light. Each fingernail was like a short blade, the color of metal, the tips tinted black.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
