There would probably be enough people that are eliminated by the first half.”</p><p>After several tens of seconds, Yan Zheke, who was worried about this matter, replied, “Why do I feel that you are shivering but instead of fear, it’s excitement?! You’re a masochist!”</p><p>Before Lou Cheng could reply, she added, “[Sitting obediently expression] This feels rather magical… Three years ago, if you have said that your goal is to face the Warrior Sage by now, I would definitely have encouraged you. However, I would have also mocked you without reservation!”</p><p>This felt just like a dream!</p><p>“Honestly speaking, I didn’t give much thought about how far I have to go for this “Master” competition. I still have to see who I am drawn against. [Laughing secretly expression]” replied Lou Cheng. “If that is the case, identifying how far I am from the most elite level physical invulnerability experts will not be a bad thing either.”</p><p>“Yeah. Cheng, you are the best~!” complimented Yan Zheke playfully but also in approval.</p><p>When she returned to her busy studying life, Lou Cheng went to browse through the most recent thirty matches of Warrior Sage, Qian Donglou, since he was free.</p><p>What if I really had the chance to go against him in the fifth round?</p><p>Despite playing these videos several times, Lou Cheng couldn’t help but feel a chill down his spine. There was only one thought lingering in his mind: “He’s darned powerful!”</p><p>It wasn’t that he hadn’t previously watched the battles of Qian Donglou. He had watched the battles of the peak between Warrior Sage and Dragon King countless times. However, when he looked at it from the perspective of an opponent and assessed this one in a thousand years talent at the level of a physical invulnerability expert, he had a different feeling about it.</p><p>Xin Xiaoyue had integrated the Death Sect and overtaken those before her. Her “Chilling Cold” could instil a sense of fear in others by the name of it; Wang Que had great mastery over techniques. Ordinary punches and kicks had might beyond those at the same level as him. He could execute physical invulnerability moves quicker and more acutely; The Living Buddha had a strong mind and many tricks up his sleeves. This made it hard for others to differentiate him the real him from the illusions… These were Lou Cheng thoughts on the strengths and characteristics of those physical invulnerability experts he had fought. As for Warrior Sage, Qian Donglou, he possessed all of these strengths!</p><p>He’s no longer what others called “Great Master potential” or “Future Master” but a real and true Great Master and Master. He had created several different types of martial arts and had an insane level of mastery in each!</p><p>“…..After watching the videos of Warrior Sage, even my heart has gone cold… [Laughed out tears expression]” Lou Cheng picked up his phone and sent the message to Yan Zheke. “I’m going out to have supper to calm myself!”</p><p>When he had changed his clothes and was about to head out, Yan Zheke replied, “[Holding back laughing expression] Come, let me caress your head! I heard that the small lobsters in Jiu Qu City are pretty good. You can give it a try.”</p><p>After several seconds, she said, “[Squatting in a corner and drawing circles expression] I was wrong. It’s already November. The small lobsters wouldn’t have much flesh… I have been reading too many books recently and forgot about this…”</p><p>“Haha, I have already done my homework. There’s a barbeque store here that looks pretty good. If it is comparable to the taste in Xiushan, I’ll bring you to it next time.” Lou Cheng put on a pair of black glasses that covered half of his face and a brown baseball cap. He carried his phone and wallet and walked to the mirror. After confirming his disguise was great, he opened the door and walked out of the hotel.</p><p>He had not alerted Auman as he wouldn’t have to trouble the assistant with this kind of thing.</p><p>The autumn wind was blowing and the night was dark. Lou Cheng followed the GPS and covered two streets through strolling. Finally, he saw the “Brick Factory Barbeque” store. At the same time, he saw tables and tables of customers outside the store.</p><p>“Their business is really good… It should taste pretty good…” mumbled Lou Cheng to himself before going over and finding the waitress.</p><p>“Are you ordering for here or take away?” The waitress asked while she was busy with other things.</p><p>Lou Cheng could feel the refreshing autumn wind blowing. He smiled and answered, “I’ll be eating it here.”</p><p>“In that case, sorry to have troubled you with the inconvenience.,” said the waitress apologetically. “As you can see, we do not have any tables now. Is it okay if we give you a tall bench? There is a small stool to accompany.”</p><p>Lou Cheng took a glance at the tall plastic stool, thought for a while before answering,</p><p>“Alright!”</p><p>A physical invulnerability expert and the Heavenly son of the era is going to sit on this small stool and eat from this blue plastic tall bench?</p><p>Lou Cheng was paying much attention to it initially. Subsequently, he found it hilarious and took a photo to send to his little fairy girl. “I felt a little like doing my homework by the door when I was young…”</p><p>“At that time, in order to look at the other kids playing, I would carry a tall and short bench to the open space outside my house to do my homework. After doing my homework for a while, I would also join in to play a while before going back to do my homework.”</p><p>Yan Zheke had not replied to her when there was a huge shadow casted on him. He raised his head and saw a tall and fat man standing in front of him. In his hand was a small stool and a tall plastic stool.</p><p>This fat man was wearing a grey woollen hat and a black t-shirt. Although he had a great disguise, Lou Cheng was able to tell from one glance that this was the Living Buddha, Shi Shan, who had beaten him in the afternoon.</p><p>Living Buddha, Shi Shan?</p><p>Shi Shan was about to sit down when he noticed someone gaze. He followed the gaze, looked over and was a little shock.</p><p>Lou Cheng?</p><p>In the restaurant, the two of them stared at each other and didn’t speak a word for some time. It was only when the waitress came over and rushed them, “What do you guys want to order?”</p><p>…Lou Cheng paused for a few seconds and answered, “Twenty pieces of beef and twenty pieces of pork ribs…”</p><p>Shi Shan added, “Twenty pieces of small potato, twenty pieces of eggplants…”</p><p>After ordering, they paused again before breaking into laughter and no longer holding themselves back.</p><p>“Haha, I have not expected to meet “Benefactor” here.” greeted Shi Shan.</p><p>Lou Cheng shook his head and broke into laughter. After thinking about how to address him, he said, “I have also not expected Vulnerable to be in this kind of place.”</p><p>Shi Shan stayed silent for a moment before saying, “This sounds a little strange.”</p><p>It was just a casual remark… Lou Cheng laughed embarrassingly and didn’t continue. The two of them weren’t familiar with each other and lacked the basis to continue their chat.</p><p>However, should I take the lead and buy the bill later… Why would physical invulnerability experts be concerned about this?… It’s just a bit of barbeque… Thoughts fluttered in Lou Cheng’s mind as he seemed to have been placed in a dilemma. He chose to pick up his phone and share the incident with Coach Yan and asked for her advice.</p><p>However, Yan Zheke was attending an important class and wouldn’t have the time to reply.</p><p>After a while, the waitress served part of their order. The oil on the pork belly was glittering and the aroma was strong. Surprisingly, Shi Shan, who was at the other side of the “small table” could be seen swallowing his saliva subconsciously.</p><p>Lou Cheng found it amusing instantly. Recalling that Living Buddha had only ordered vegetarian food, he couldn’t help but tease, “Vulnerable, would you like to have some. From the fragments of memories you have shown me, the secret sect did not abstain you from these.”</p><p>The expression on Shi Shan changed as he sighed and laughed, “There are some monks… Erm… Let me use words that Benefactor can understand instead. In order to look past killing, they promote to be involved in the killing. After experiencing it, they gain enlightenment.”</p><p>“Therefore it shouldn’t be a problem for Vulnerable to have a meat stick? Since it was for looking past?” Lou Cheng maintained a smile and asked despite knowing the answer.</p><p>Shi Shan shook his head slightly and said, “I am trying to say that this is wrong. This is just finding excuses for self-enjoyment. Experiencing it doesn’t necessarily mean to do it by oneself. Everything in the world is there and can be obtained easily.”</p><p>“That’s true.” Lou Cheng answered while pondering about it. After which, he smiled and said, “Since the previous generation of Living Buddhas had experienced meat, Vulnerable could be considered to have the experienced too. That’s not too bad. Yeah. Not too bad.”</p><p>After hearing his words, Shi Shan heaved a long sigh. “How could the culinary skills in the past be compared with modern times?”</p><p>I pity you… Lou Cheng didn’t say those words. Instead, he recommended, “There’s a vegetarian store in Gaofen called “Yafen”. The vegetarian meat that they make tastes exactly like the real thing. If Vulnerable is free, you could go and give it a try.</p><p>Subsequently, the two of them stayed on this topic and have a good time chatting. When all the barbeque sticks were served, Lou Cheng took a photo and sent it to his little fairy girl.</p><p>At this point, Yan Zheke finally got a break. “[Shocked expression] The big monk is a glutton and end up meeting the primary school kid doing his homework by the door.”</p><p>Lou Cheng broke into silent laughter and quickly typed his reply, “Please show a little more respect. These are two physical invulnerability experts!”</p><p>After replying, he raised his head and saw Shi Shan looking at him with a strange expression.</p><p>Haven’t you seen a couple displaying affection? Lou Cheng cursed silently. Instantly, he recalled from the fragments of memories that some of the Living Buddhas had also fallen in love.</p><p>Shi Shan smiled and replied, “It’s easy to be in love but staying together would be hard…”</p><p>This is something that I don’t like to hear… Lou Cheng organized his thoughts before saying, “There’s nothing in the world that could stay the same forever. Since that is the case, why would we crave for long and unchanging love?”</p><p>“The life of a human is short. As long as we can maintain this loving relationship for a slightly longer time, it would already be enough.”</p><p>Shi Shan pondered for a few moments, picked up the barbeque sticks and said, “There’re hidden meanings in the words of Benefactor too.”</p><p>When he finished his words, he stood up and was about to leave.</p><p>“I thought Vulnerable would have some wise words to share,” replied Lou Cheng with some astonishment.</p><p>Shi Shan had a young look and felt a little mischievous. However, he gave off a feeling of one having tons of experiences and was tired of life.</p><p>“Let’s not talk about it and it’s hard to make it clear.” He shook his head, carried his barbecue sticks and walked out gradually.</p><p>Lou Cheng looked on blankly and surprisingly felt that he had the feeling of someone profound.</p><p>At this moment, the waitress had walked over. When she saw the back view of Shi Shan, she asked, “You are paying for his share?”</p><p>“Huh?” Lou Cheng was lost.</p><p>This monk didn’t pay for his bills!</p><p>Where’s the conscience of a monk?</p><p>…</p><p>Because of this, he was laughed at by Yan Zheke for more than a day. Soon, Lou Cheng was about to be involved in the fifth round of the Double-Elimination Round.</p><p>Ren Li, who was the first to appear, lost to the King of Swords, Wu Qiao without being able to put on much resistance. When the first sixteen matches were over, there were 11 people eliminated. Peng Leyun had no choice but to go on stage to challenge the “Wisdom King”, Zhi Hai.</p><p>This match was unusually intense. There were a few times Lou Cheng thought that Peng Leyun would be able to turn the tables around. However, they were easily resolved by the “Wisdom King”. In the end, the “Wisdom King” clinched the victory without any controversies.</p><p>With Peng Leyun’s elimination, Lou Cheng had also made it to the round of thirty-two without facing the Warrior Sage, Qian Donglou.</p><p>Nine o’clock that night, the fixture of the round of thirty-two would be determined. Lou Cheng heard his name for the second match, “Longhu Club, Lou Cheng!”</p><p>Just as Lou Cheng straightened his back, his opponent had been decided, “Guanwai League, Lu Yongyuan!”</p><p>“God Slaying Knife”, Lu Yongyuan. He’s a man that was regarded as possibly becoming the “King of Knives”!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
