After a long and bumpy journey, he finally arrived in Connecticut.</p><p>Lou Cheng heaved a silent sigh of relief as he passed through security. He couldn’t help but compliment,</p><p>“That’s how a large country should act!”</p><p>After the incident with Talin, he was surprised that his visa application wasn’t rejected. Or that, despite having all of his documents prepared, they did not find any excuse to stop him from entering America.</p><p>This is exactly how a confident and strong country should act!</p><p>Lou Cheng shed his hidden worries and his mood improved instantly. Following the crowd, he walked forward.</p><p>The National Security Agency had an office in the Orion airport. The Chief of Security in Connecticut was looking at a computer screen flashing a warning sign. He lifted his cup of coffee, took a sip, and pretended to be calm.</p><p>“Those idiots. Screw them. How could they approve this guy’s visa application!” He scolded angrily after his tongue was scalded by the hot coffee.</p><p>Who should I send to supervise a Terror Grade expert that has labels like “Catastrophe,””Bad Luck,” and other similar tags?</p><p>Maybe one good with his words? Since he will definitely be noticed!</p><p>Why did I send Smith to the Intelligence Department? If he was still here, everyone would be more at ease.</p><p>The chief had a bad headache. After thinking about it for a couple of minutes, he decided to seek advice from his superior, the overall boss of Connecticut Intelligence, Safety and Investigation System in America, mediator of various local Terror Grade experts, and the protector of discipline. He was none other than the famous New Continent Odin, Mr. Gonzalez.</p><p>He was also a Terror Grade expert, and one who was pretty well-known.</p><p>When the call went through, hearty laughter came from the other end,</p><p>“Little Charles, did you encounter some trouble?”</p><p>“Yeah. Mr. Gonzalez, Lou Cheng from China is here again.” The chief, Charles, explained simply.</p><p>Gonzalez heaved a long sigh and said,</p><p>“What a shame. I’m on vacation right now. You should know that I’ve accumulated a lot of vacation days. I have complete trust that you’ll be able to handle this matter well. Lou Cheng from China isn’t an expert that disregards the laws. As long as you can coordinate and communicate well, it should be a simple task.”</p><p>“Yes, Mr. Gonzalez.” Charles put down the phone and sank into a daze.</p><p>I just had dinner with him two days ago.</p><p>He didn’t say he was going on vacation…</p><p>He lifted his hand and covered his face. After a minute, he picked up the phone once again and shouted for an agent. He was the most inexperienced one without any significant background.</p><p>……</p><p>Entering the main hall, Lou Cheng spotted Ke immediately.</p><p>Following which, they hugged each other, held hands, smiled, and chatted casually per usual. From time to time, they exchanged mushy words until they arrived at Aunt Du’s car where they became more reserved.</p><p>After successfully arriving at Yan Zheke’s place in Northern Connecticut, Lou Cheng held her hand, walked to the front of the house enthusiastically, and opened the door.</p><p>Yan Zheke looked up and suddenly said,</p><p>“Aiya, I forgot to tell you about this!”</p><p>“What?” Lou Cheng heard the door unlocking as he put on a smile.</p><p>“My parents told me that because they haven’t spent the New Year with me in several years, they took a flight here yesterday to surprise me…” Yan Zheke covered her mouth, as she was helpless but also found it funny.</p><p>Creak! As the sound reached his ear, the door opened. The image of Empress Dowager, Ji Mingyu, clearing the dining table and Yan Kai, busy in the kitchen, appeared in front of Lou Cheng eyes.</p><p>Surprise… Lou Cheng mouth twitched a little. He quickly put on a smile and greeted,</p><p>“Aunt, Uncle.”</p><p>“Lou is here? The food will be ready soon. You can go and put down your luggage first.” Ji Mingyu laughed naturally while Yan Kan looked over and nodded his head slightly in acknowledgement.</p><p>Yan Zheke spoke into his ear softly,</p><p>“I’ve prepared another room for you on the second floor.”</p><p>“This…” Lou Cheng turned to look at his wife. With a radiant smile, he said, “This is pretty good, too.”</p><p>…</p><p>The week passed quickly and Lou Cheng boarded the flight to Wuyue Province.</p><p>Recalling the New Year atmosphere over the last few days, he broke into laughter as he shook his head and said,</p><p>“Sometimes, doing things in secret can also be fun.”</p><p>“I only stayed a few days and it ended before I even realized.”</p><p>“Now I have to wait until October for the next time.”</p><p>During this period, he could only rely on Yan Zheke returning to China during his spring and summer breaks.</p><p>He came in a hurry and left in a hurry. Lou Cheng held his phone in his hands while looking out of the window as the plane took off.</p><p>Now, other than Yan Zheke who was unwilling to part, most well-known figures in Connecticut were finally able to relax. Gonzalez ended his holiday immediately and bade goodbyes to the beach filled with sunlight and beautiful girls.</p><p>After spending some days with his Master and returning home for the fifteen days of the Chinese New year, Lou Cheng collected his lazy and idle feelings as he started his next year enthusiastically.</p><p>Starting the day he arrived in Huacheng, he didn’t take a break. He headed to Longhu Club directly to use the Volcano Experiment Lab and try out new ideas he had over the past few months.</p><p>As the boss, and with his girl’s reminder, he gave his assistant, Auman, and driver, Zhao Zhenghua, a huge red packet each. In the words of the locals, this was “good luck money.”</p><p>After practice and bathing, Lou Cheng dried his hair. He asked Auman to find out if Empress Luo was in the office. After getting an affirmative answer, he walked there directly and knocked on the door.</p><p>“Sister Ning, Happy New Year.” Lou Cheng clasped his fist with his palm and said as he pushed opened the door and walked in.</p><p>Ning Zitong was fully dressed in auspicious red clothing. She didn’t look gaudy at all, but rather, the clothing made her looked several years younger.</p><p>“You don’t have to be so courteous. Didn’t you send your greetings over the phone?” Ning Zitong played with her bracelet as she answered. “Say it. What would you like to ask?”</p><p>“My Fire Sect moves can be considered mastered, but I can’t let my techniques from the Ice Sect lag behind. I’d like to ask if the military has venues in the vicinity similar to the Polar Laboratory? I could fly to Moshang CIty twice a week, right?” Lou Cheng was direct with his queries.</p><p>“Yeah, probably a two hour trip.” Ning Zitong said with a giggle. “You could look to your Master for this. Why did you ask me?”</p><p>“I shouldn’t trouble two people for one matter.” After having his question solved, he answered in a good mood.</p><p>“Mm…” Ning Zitong pondered a moment before saying, “Regarding the incident of Talin, the subsequent investigation hasn’t produced any results. However, considering how the Witch King has gone completely silent since, this is a grave matter. The military is prepared to work with America to redetermine the direction and expand the scope of the investigation. You have truly made a huge contribution. After much discussion, they have decided to allow you to view the Restricted Sect’s Clear Jade Chapter in advance.”</p><p>Is this favoritism? Lou Cheng had no mental preparation for this and blurted,</p><p>“Based on what I’ve done, my contributions alone shouldn’t be enough, right?”</p><p>“You can’t just look at yourself,” laughed Ning Zitong. “This is also to compensate your Master. In the past, he would have rather died than agree to become an official member of the military or join Longhu Club. Therefore, he couldn’t practice the godly skills of the Restricted Sect. If based solely on accolades, with his contributions, he would have made the cut over eight hundred times. Since your Master is stubborn, his disciple benefits from it.”</p><p>Lou Cheng was shocked for a few seconds before asking doubtfully,</p><p>“Looking at my Master, he seems to be very interested in the godly skills of the Restricted Sect.”</p><p>Could he really resist the temptation?</p><p>And in addition, from the conversations he had with him, he didn’t seem to have those old and traditional views about different sects.</p><p>Master is not at all predictable. I would not have expected him to be a senior that sticks to his principles.</p><p>Ah-choo! Geezer Shi in Moshang City suddenly sneezed. Angrily, he nagged,</p><p>“Who’s scolding me?”</p><p>After hearing what Lou Cheng said, Ning Zitong shook her head and laughed,</p><p>“That was before he suffered grave injuries. After his injuries, he became more open to many things. Using the teenage slang nowadays, he’s just a braggart.”</p><p>When it came to joking about his Master, it wasn’t appropriate for Lou Cheng to partake. He could only smile faintly in response.</p><p>“Alright, make some preparations and head over to the capital in two days to view the Clear Jade Chapter.” Ning Zitong smiled and explained, “We don’t have it here. It’s under the custody of Elder Mei.”</p><p>She sighed,</p><p>“Hopefully you are able to gain something from it. The Dragon King might not be ready by the opening match for this season of the professional league.”</p><p>“Dragon King is injured?” Lou Cheng assumed</p><p>During the spring holiday, Dragon King had accepted the challenge by Warrior Sage for the Master title. After three intense battles, he lost to him again. Lou Cheng felt that he had risked too much and gotten injured because of it.</p><p>“He got a little injured, but nothing serious. However, it’s going to be the finals of the Supreme Class competition. It would be a round-robin match of four people. With Dragon King’s personality, he would never give up, which means his injuries would likely worsen. The finals of Master and Supreme Class are too close to each other to risk it,” Ning Zitong lamented.</p><p>“Yeah.” Lou Cheng nodded his head before asking, “Sister Ning, is the schedule for our professional league out? Who are we up against?”</p><p>“It’s out, but it hasn’t been announced.” Ning Zitong rubbed her head and said. “In two weeks, we’ll be accepting the challenge of Guanwai League as we defend the title of World Number One on home ground.”</p><p>God Slaying Saber, Lu Yongyuan… When he heard the words “Guanwai League,” that was the first name that popped into his head.</p><p>Without the Dragon King, our club will be at a disadvantage.</p><p>Seeing that Lou Cheng was speechless, Ning Zitong laughed light-heartedly,</p><p>“Don’t be too nervous. Lu Yongyuan is from the same generation as me. I don’t think I would lose to him. As for the others…um… Do you know about them? They have a new Physical Invulnerability expert joining them.”</p><p>“Who? I haven’t heard of any newly advanced Physical Invulnerability experts?” Lou Cheng was completely clueless.</p><p>“She’s not from China but Japan. You should know her. Tang Zexun.” Ning Zitong replied.</p><p>“They can invite experts from overseas?” Lou Cheng was surprised and returned the question.</p><p>The last time I met her in Huacheng was because of this?</p><p>I thought that she was going to fulfil her promise to challenge the Priest. I even reminded that unreliable guy to not miss out on this romance.</p><p>“There are no rules against it, but she is here as a special guest. Tang Zexun isn’t allowed to practice techniques of the Guanwai league and can only fight for money. Yeah, rumors have it that she’s trying to improve through more practical battles.” Ning Zitong explained before saying with a smile, “This incident treally triggered the media circle. There will be reports coming out in just a few days, and I’ve already heard several headlines. For example, ‘The Strongest and Most Talented Genius of this Generation from Japan Idolizes Chinese Culture’ and ‘Defeated, She Comes to Learn’.” One can easily imagine the response from Japan. Tang Zexun is under a lot of pressure.”</p><p>With his doubts eased, Lou Cheng leaned back and said with a smile on his face,</p><p>“It would be great if I had the opportunity to fight her again.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
