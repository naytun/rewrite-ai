Looking towards the lights of homes that looked just like the milky way, he thought back quietly about the matter of crabs and Yan Zheke.</p><p>Many of the details had disappeared in the stream of time. All that was left were some blurry images. However, the practical thing had integrated into his instincts and became subconscious. He might not feel anything most of the times but when a familiar scene struck, everything would suddenly become so clear as though they had just happened. Feeling the vivid and eternal trails, Lou Cheng knew that these were what had been supporting him.</p><p>He looked on quietly for some time while counting down silently towards the end of Yan Zheke’s lesson. He took out his phone and started typing but silently deleted it soon after.</p><p>After three consecutive times, he forced a smile and said, “There’s something that I wonder if I should tell you. If I say it, I’m afraid you will be upset and feel pressured. If I don’t say it, I’m afraid you will find me getting colder and not passionate enough.”</p><p>Yan Zheke happened to be keeping her books to move into a new classroom. When she saw this sudden message, she replied, “[Lost expression] What’s the matter? Just say it. My mental quality is really good.”</p><p>What has happened to Cheng?</p><p>A faint smile surfaced on Lou Cheng as he typed out word by word, “Regarding the fact that I really miss you.”</p><p>Yan Zheke was instantly shocked and dumbfounded. Her lips formed a smiling arc and she felt a little strange and joy, “Why did you say it so suddenly?”</p><p>“I was having a gathering with “Hipster” and the group. “Priest” brought a girl along and she was a food blogger. She was very good at de-shelling the crab and did one for everyone. My answer then was ‘Thank you, you are so good at it’. I remembered that it was you who taught me about this compliment.” Lou Cheng described what happened previously in a summarized way. He didn’t explain why did he suddenly feel so and only mentioned that he remembered such an incident.</p><p>“…You’ve done pretty well.” Yan Zheke felt her heart had gone soft suddenly. All her emotions had settled and the four words “I really miss you” were no longer empty. They had practical and deep support.</p><p>Before Lou Cheng could reply, she added, “I saw a black man junior wearing Feather Raiment along the corridor yesterday… This has become fashionable at school…”</p><p>Therefore, I really miss you too!</p><p>“Why didn’t you tell me beforehand…” Lou Cheng understood the hidden meaning behind Yan Zheke’s words.</p><p>Yan Zheke replied, “[Looking at the sky proudly expression] Aren’t I’m of afraid someone being so rash that he would book an air ticket here directly?”</p><p>“I would have definitely done that in the past… As for now, I can only enter the country once every six months. [Covering face while crying expression]”</p><p>Moreover, he could not stay for more than ten days. This was the restriction placed on physical invulnerability experts.</p><p>“That’s true… [Sitting in a daze expression]”. Suddenly, a strong impulse welled up in Yan Zheke. She took out her notebook and curriculum to check for her schedule. She wanted to return to China over the weekend for a holiday and to give someone a surprise.</p><p>On some matters, she had always had extremely strong courage and motivation.</p><p>After flipping through, her heart sank. Because this was her first year learning under her mentor, her curriculum was fully packed and she had a large amount of research and experiments to complete over the weekend. This was also a way for her to complete her studies in a shorter period of time.</p><p>Sigh… She stood up and turned into the public washroom just a stone throw away. Standing in front of the basin, she took off her glasses and washed her face with the cold water.</p><p>Lifting her head, she saw a beautiful face from the reflection of the mirror. Yan Zheke extended her hands suddenly and pressed on the edge of her eyes. Sticking her tongue out, she made a wry face. This was something she loved to do the most when she was young.</p><p>“It’s all your fault!” She stared at the “opposite face” and mumbled.</p><p>…</p><p>After several days, the main part of the “Master” competition finally ended. “Warrior Sage”, Qian Donglou, obtained the qualification to challenge the “Dragon King”. The two of them would engage in a peak matchup once again around the new year period.</p><p>After flying back to Sky Capital Garden in Huacheng, Lou Cheng did not rest the day he touched down. After a short break, he asked Auman to inform the driver to pick him up from his mansion.</p><p>It was two o’clock in the afternoon and late at night in Connecticut. It would be a waste if he did not use this time to train.</p><p>Moreover, after going through the “Master” competition, he had many questions to conclude and to explore!</p><p>At two fifty-five in the afternoon, a spacious and luxurious nanny car stopped at the gate of the mansion along Xiapei Lake. Lou Cheng sat at the back of the car and saw Auman, who had not yet put down her luggage. He smiled faintly and said, “You can go back first and have a good rest. There’s nothing else for today. I’m just going to train for an additional two to three hours. Just inform Old Zhao to wait for me.”</p><p>Old Zhao was his driver, Zhao Zhenhua.</p><p>Auman smiled sweetly but shook her head and said, “I can rest while I’m at the club too. Moreover, I don’t have to cook my own meals or order delivery.”</p><p>“Alright then.” Lou Cheng didn’t insist and leaned back. He closed his eyes slightly as he rested.</p><p>Seeing this, Auman pulled out a book from her sling bag carefully and started reading it. From time to time, she would revert to her phone to make a note.</p><p>After spending some time with personal assistants of other physical invulnerability experts, she had learned the importance of self-learning to increase her value and not waste precious time.</p><p>This was also because of something she held close to her. Although no one would speak badly of her in front of her, there would always be people pointing and commenting behind her back, saying that she had managed to become a personal assistant only because she had sacrificed her body. As to whom she was rumoured to have sacrificed her body to, no one would dare to say it outrightly. Nonetheless, it was clear to everyone.</p><p>Because of this, her joyous moments in life had decreased. She didn’t even share this matter with her parents and her best friends. All she told them was that she was promoted and had a pay rise while performing outstandingly in an important role in the club.</p><p>I want to become an outstanding assistant… Auman thought as she clenched her fist secretly. In the steady cruising car, she was either reading a book or putting on her earphones to watch related videos.</p><p>Due to an accident on the roads, half of all the lanes were jammed. Lou Cheng took half an hour to finally reach the club. After which, he went to the private training ground.</p><p>Other than the public areas, there were 10 isolated spaces with metal doors. This was to allow each and every physical invulnerability expert to be able to use one individually and not be affected by others.</p><p>When he pushed open the main door to the training ground, Lou Cheng saw a towering figure standing there. He wore a navy blue martial art suit. His face was filled with perspiration and looked extremely tired under the scorching hot afternoon sun. Nonetheless, he had the majestic quality.</p><p>This was the Dragon King, Chen Qitao!</p><p>Even though the other physical invulnerability experts of the club weren’t here, he had not relaxed his demands of himself.</p><p>Chen Qitao seemed to have sensed Lou Cheng approaching beforehand and wasn’t surprised at all. All he did was nodding his head slightly as a form of greeting.</p><p>He opened up his strides and headed towards the corridor leading to the “Volcano Experiment Lab”. As he walked passed Lou Cheng, he paused for a few seconds before speaking in a sombre tone, “Restart your practice on “Nine Rotations of Five Flames” over this period of time.”</p><p>“Huh?” Lou Cheng was a little lost from what he heard.</p><p>As the physical invulnerability move, “Nine Rotations of Five Flames. Descend Of The Sun”, was compatible with his “Cosmic style”, his control over it was fine and easy. Although he couldn’t say that he was comparable to the Dragon King, he was confident that he was better than “Optimus Prime”, Long Zhen, and other traditional “Fire” Sect experts. This was a move that he was confident and proud of.</p><p>“Why do I have to restart my practice?”</p><p>Chen Qitao moved his hands behind him and repeated with a stern and low voice, “You’ve relied on the techniques of Cultivation to skip the complicated control techniques required in “Nine Rotations of Five Flames”. These things wouldn’t help you to use “Nine Rotations of Nine Flames” better but can help you improve your control over different types of fire. This is the most basic of the basics. Some shortcuts could be taken but there are things that you shouldn’t skip.”</p><p>After he completed his sentence, the Dragon King opened up his strides again and passed by Lou Cheng. Every step of his had a similar form and distance covered as though they were copied and pasted.</p><p>Lou Cheng was shocked for a moment but understood quickly. He knew that he had almost neglected the most important foundation.</p><p>He turned around in a hurry, clasped his left hand over his right fist as a form of respect and said, “Thank you senior for your guidance.”</p><p>Chen Qitao didn’t turn around, didn’t stop and didn’t look back as though he hadn’t said anything.</p><p>After seeing the Dragon King disappearing at the corners of the corridor, Lou Cheng also left the training ground and instead headed for the training room for physical invulnerability experts. Once he was there, he seriously restarted his practice on the “Nine Rotations of Five Flames. Descend Of The Sun”.</p><p>After an afternoon of diligent training, Lou Cheng wiped away the perspiration from his forehead with a tower. After changing into a set of refreshing clothes, he headed to the canteen for lunch. His schedule was similar to the times when he was in Huacheng.</p><p>At seven o’clock at night, he returned to his mansion and sent off Auman and the driver, Zhao Zhenhua. Lou Cheng chatted with Cai Zongming, Jiang Fei and others on QQ casually until his little fairy girl had completed her morning training.</p><p>“Cheng, I won a luxurious full-play tour to Huacheng before I sleep yesterday!” Yan Zheke said excitedly.</p><p>“So? [Lost expression]” Lou Cheng asked.</p><p>Ke can only come over during the winter break. I can be her guide at that time.</p><p>“You really are… [Cover face in exasperation expression]” replied Yan Zheke. “You have been in Huacheng for several months now. Don’t you ever think of bringing them over to Huacheng for a tour? They wouldn’t have to stay in the hotel at night and can stay directly at your home. Their transport can be settled by asking Auman to inform the driver. It will not be a hassle for you. All you have to do is to spend some quality time with them when you return home each day!”</p><p>“…” Lou Cheng was dumbfounded for a while before commenting, “Who’s the real child of my parents?”</p><p>I have not thought about this or anything similar to this at all. All I have thought of is to spend some days at home in December when I return.</p><p>A man was indeed not as meticulous as a woman in this aspect…</p><p>“Pfft. It’s good that you can recognise it. You can ask aunt and uncle if they are free between November 27 to December 7. Yeah. The tour is only for seven days. Keeping the first two days free, uncle and aunt can get to know about our house and can also prepare some home-cooked food for you. [Hands on the waist and laughing expression]”</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled unconsciously when he saw the message before adding, “[Evil smile expression] Call them ‘Mom and Dad’!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
