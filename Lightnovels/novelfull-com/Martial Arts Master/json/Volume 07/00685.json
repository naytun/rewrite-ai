Tucking both hands into his pants, he waited patiently for the airplane to land. From time to time, he lifted his head and looked at the big screen to verify the updates on the plane’s arrival.</p><p>Time passed quickly as he lazed around. When his app finally gave him a notification, he straightened his posture and looked towards the arrival gate. Although he knew that he would have to wait a little longer, he still looked around several times.</p><p>As he picked up his phone to respond to Yan Zheke’s message, he looked forward and reflected his surroundings in his mind.</p><p>In less than ten minutes, a beautiful and familiar figure appeared in front of his eyes. She was wearing loose, casual black pants and a white turtleneck sweater. Other than that, there weren’t any other colors on her. It was refreshing and simple.</p><p>As compared to the teenage schoolgirl look she used to have, she seemed to have a more mature beauty about her now.</p><p>As Lou Cheng saw Yan Zheke, she also saw him. Their gazes locked as they looked lovingly at each other.</p><p>A smile surfaced on his face as Lou Cheng stepped forward. He carried her two bags of luggage in one hand while holding onto her soft palm with the other. The whole process was fluid and natural as though they had done this hundreds of thousands of times.</p><p>Yan Zheke was relaxed and let Lou Cheng pull her along as they walked.</p><p>After several steps, she reached her other hand over and wrapped it the arm of her husband as she leaned onto him.</p><p>Lou Cheng tilted his head to look at her. He smiled and said,</p><p>“Today I won’t bring you around to taste the delicacies in Huacheng. It’s time for me to let you witness my true culinary skills!”</p><p>“Huh?” Yan Zheke was confused.</p><p>“My culinary skills have improved recently. I’ve learned several new moves,” explained Lou Cheng with a smile.</p><p>“Haven’t you been busy practicing physical invulnerability moves the last few months?” asked Yan Zheke. She had an “I’m gullible so don’t lie to me” expression.</p><p>Lou Cheng replied,</p><p>“These are side products of my practice. My control over extreme coldness and flames has become stronger and the breadth of my applications has broadened. I can produce several delicate tricks.”</p><p>“As for cooking, isn’t it all about using fire, low temperature, and quick-freeze? Hehe, I can make you an egg sunny side up on my palm or ice cream and other cold dishes…”</p><p>“Sunnyside up on one’s palm” was a saying in Xiushan. The meaning was, “If you can really achieve this, I’ll make an egg sunny side up on my palm for you” to express one’s total disbelief that the other party could do something.</p><p>Listening to Lou Cheng teasing her, Yan Zheke’s mouth was half open, unable to find the words to react. Lou Cheng found it hard to not pinch her cheeks.</p><p>After several seconds, Yan Zheke finally opened her mouth,</p><p>“You look l really proud of yourself!”</p><p>“Of course. This is what you call a modern man, who you can show-off to everyone in public while also being able to cook well in the house!” Lou Cheng laughed satisfactorily before teasing, “Aren’t you looking forward to it?”</p><p>“Looking forward!” Yan Zheke’s pupils dilated and she nodded her head profusely, smiling.</p><p>The couple left the main hall and arrived at the parking garage. Auman was already waiting for them and received a courteous thanks from Yan Zheke.</p><p>Auman didn’t sit in the back of the car but had instead went for the seat beside the driver. She kept her silence and didn’t entertain the driver, Old Zhao.</p><p>Although there was a partition from the front, Lou Cheng only sat beside Yan Zheke while she leaned on him. They chatted about what had happened in Europe over the past few days and didn’t commit to any indecencies. It was just like how they were in Aunt Du’s car in Connecticut.</p><p>Naturally, Lou Cheng was rehearsing the things that would happen after they arrived at the mansion.</p><p>Should I give her a Kabedon directly?</p><p>My gaze has to be deep and I have to control my actions. I can’t be too intense.</p><p>As these thoughts went through his mind, the car turned onto the mansion property along Xiapei Lake and stopped at the entrance.</p><p>After seeing off Auman and Old Zhao, Lou Cheng released his seal. When he stepped into the house, his left leg was already slightly bent as he waited to close the door.</p><p>He felt tension on his arm. The beautiful face in front of him magnified and he found a pair of lips on his.</p><p>As their breathing slowed, Yan Zheke released her tiptoe position and looked to the side. She walked to the living room on her own, lifted her chin slightly and said,</p><p>“Go and make dinner for me quickly!”</p><p>Lou Cheng touched his lips a little and said with a smile on his face, “Alright!”</p><p>He lifted her luggage and said, “Let me put these on the second floor first.”</p><p>“Mmmm.” Yan Zheke looked around curiously. She was comparing what she saw with her expectation from pictures and videos. Without needing Lou Cheng to bring her around, she already knew the use of each room and the reason behind each detail. She didn’t feel like a stranger to the house at all.</p><p>As she immersed herself in this wonderful feeling, she followed her husband up to the second floor. She entered the master bedroom and saw the dream-like scenery and Xiapei lake shimmering in golden light through the windows that reflected the golden rays of the setting sun.</p><p>“How is it? Isn’t it beautiful?” asked Lou Cheng.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s train of emotions was disrupted. She snorted, turned her face to the side and said,</p><p>“I wanted to compliment it, but now I can’t find the words to do it.”</p><p>She carried on, put down her luggage, squatted and said, “Let me unpack a little first.”</p><p>After several seconds, she felt something and lifted her head. All she saw was Lou Cheng looking at her with a smile.</p><p>“What are you looking at me for?” asked Yan Zheke softly.</p><p>Lou Cheng cleared his throat, put on a smile and said, “I can’t get enough of you.”</p><p>Before waiting for her to scold him for being mushy, he squatted down too. Without shifting her gaze away, he laughed, “Let me help you put these away.”</p><p>Yan Zheke was affected by his gaze and looked down to the side. She pushed Lou Cheng up and said,</p><p>“Go and prepare for dinner first. I’ll come down right away!”</p><p>“Alright.” Lou Cheng heard his stomach growling.</p><p>After seeing him off at the entrance to the master bedroom, a beautiful smile appeared on her face and light shimmered in her eyes.</p><p>She stretched her slender waist, quickly took out the stuff in her beg and sorted them.</p><p>When finished, she walked around the room as she admired every decoration that had already been in her mind for a long time.</p><p>After making two rounds, she sat at the edge of the bed and leaned into it. Her body was enveloped by the soft, cushy cotton.</p><p>She had thought that she would feel a little out of place and unaccustomed. She also thought that she would need a day or two to get completely used to things. However, such feelings were minimal. She felt just like she did returning to her dormitory with her roommate at the end of each summer and winter holiday.</p><p>Hmm. The feeling of the sun and the smell of Cheng…so comforting.</p><p>I’m a little sleepy. I didn’t manage to get much sleep on the plane. Let me take a short nap. I’ll get up in ten minutes…ten minutes…</p><p>…</p><p>In the kitchen on the ground floor, the ice cream was covered in a layer of faint blue crystals. It gave off violent smoke as though a dream world had descended onto the earth.</p><p>Lou Cheng looked at the barbeque meat in the faint purple flames. He couldn’t help but extend his neck and look out, mumbling,</p><p>“I’m already done with several dishes. Why hasn’t Ke come down yet?”</p><p>Confused, he stopped his preparations for the next dish. After cleaning up a little, he returned to the second floor.</p><p>At the door of the master bedroom, he saw Yan Zheke lying against the bed. Her eyes were shut, her face was relaxed, her breathing was smooth and long, and she was deep in sleep.</p><p>“She just fell asleep like this.” Lou Cheng shook his head and smiled subconsciously.</p><p>Looking at this beautiful scene, he suddenly felt a little sleepy, too. He quickly turned around, went to the ground floor and put the dishes in the steamer, setting the mode to keep them at a warm temperature. As for the ice cream, he finished it off in one mouthful, as the quality would drop after freezing it for too long.</p><p>He returned silently to the master bedroom and made his way to the other side of the bed. He laid beside Yan Zheke.</p><p>As he did, she suddenly turned around and hugged him with her hands and legs.</p><p>She smelled sweet. A smile appeared on Lou Cheng’s face. His body completely relaxed and he fell into a deep slumber.</p><p>…</p><p>The next morning, they had their late dinner. After which, Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke got in his car and were on their way to Longhu Club.</p><p>Their plans were to follow their usual schedule, which was to practice in the morning and walk around Huacheng to taste all kinds of delicacies in the afternoon. At night, they might head out or stay at home to burn in their passion. When the final two rounds of the professional competition were over and Yan Zheke had returned from Xiushan or Jiangnan, they would go on a road trip they had prepared a long time ago.</p><p>“What are you thinking of?” In his personal resting room, Lou Cheng noticed that Yan Zheke was a little distracted.</p><p>“Just reminiscing on the taste of your dishes.” Yan Zheke smiled and said, “You can call yourself the ‘Ice and Fire Great Chef’ now!”</p><p>She pushed Lou Cheng and said smiling, “Go to your practice quickly! You are needed to bring me around Huacheng in the afternoon!”</p><p>“Alright!” Lou Cheng smiled and bounded out of the resting room towards the training ground.</p><p>As she saw Lou Cheng off, Yan Zheke could feel the motivation in her husband.</p><p>He sure is driven.</p><p>Yeah, Cheng has to practice and I have things to do, too.</p><p>I have important things going on and won’t be idle!</p><p>Yan Zheke looked to Auman sitting beside her and said with a faint smile,</p><p>“Give me…hmm… Prepare a list of his financials for me.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
