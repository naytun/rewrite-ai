It has survived generations, yet no one knows how it’s passed on… Lou Cheng stopped visualizing the Wholeness Formula at the referee’s announcement. Standing straight, he made a gesture of acknowledgment.</p><p>The Living Buddha put his hands together, smiling, and chanted “Amituofo”. Though young, he conducted himself like an eminent monk.</p><p>He turned around leisurely and walked to the edge of Jiangxin Island. He stopped after a few steps, stroked his tummy, and swallowed his saliva.</p><p>After doing all this, he tried to act normal and glanced around, then hastened his gait. He didn’t take the skiff and directly traversed across the water, spawning a lotus flower with every step. Once he returned to the cruise ship where the Daxing Temple members were, he snatched a vegetarian meal proffered by a young novice monk.</p><p>How ridiculous is it that I, a Living Buddha from the Vajrayana, have to follow the Daxing Temple’s doctrines and limit myself to vegetarian food?, he thought indignantly as he indulged.</p><p>Lou Cheng massaged his swelling, stinging temples as he walked to the skiff. He leaped onto it. The skiff didn’t tremor. Not a ripple formed on the water.</p><p>Right as the skiff started moving, he couldn’t help but turn and gaze towards Jiangxin island, thinking about the battle that just concluded.</p><p>The Living Buddha is indeed a lot stronger than me, especially in the psyche area. At my current level, he destroys me. Plus, he leveraged on his advantage, so the victory came easy for him…</p><p>…</p><p>My current combat capability is at the edge of Second Pin at best. I beat Wang Que earlier, but that’s because I’m more experienced in life-and-death combat. Plus, I really outdid myself in that fight. Most importantly, Wang Que didn’t adapt to my combat style, which involves melding Ice and Fire as one, and merging martial arts and cultivation. He never expected some of my moves, so he was caught off guard a couple of times. If we were to fight two or three more times, the result might not be the same…</p><p>…</p><p>Thoughts flitted across his mind. It was a moment of self-reflection for Lou Cheng. Since he made the great leap, his vanity had been growing, but now was the time he got rid of it all.</p><p>When it comes to mentality, a moment of self-reflection doesn’t make one wise for a lifetime. As one gets stronger and gains more victories, pride and arrogance grow insidiously. For that reason, one must cleanse their minds on a regular basis. Almost every Mighty One is prone to this failing to varying degrees. The Dragon King, in particular, is insufferably conceited.</p><p>When he had concluded his reflection on the battle and himself, he was already near Longhu Club’s cruise ship. He reached out, vaulted, and steadily landed on the deck. He took his phone, ring, wallet, and other belongings from Auman.</p><p>Yan Zheke had already sent a message.</p><p>“If I’m not wrong, the Bodhi Mantra was the thing that got you in the end…[gazing at the sky, eyes darting in thought]”</p><p>“Yeah.” Lou Cheng turned his body sideways, obstructing the angles from which Auman could see his phone. “Alright, you can start consoling me now… [Drawing circles while squatting in a corner, under an overcast sky]”</p><p>“For some reason, you don’t seem very upset to me… [stares blankly]”</p><p>“Um…” Lou Cheng scratched his chin. “Maybe it’s cause I was mentally prepared for it. At least I’m not eliminated yet… I don’t like to lose, but I do know my limits. That’s why I’m not depressed. In fact, I’m motivated. I can’t wait to rewatch the fight, so I can learn more about the Living Buddha’s fighting styles and find different approaches. I can’t wait for a rematch.”</p><p>“Your mentality is admirable… Here’s a kiss~” said Yan Zheke, half-praising and half-consoling. She quickly changed the topic. “Was the Living Buddha’s psyche powers profoundly strong?”</p><p>“He completely outclassed me in that aspect…” admitted Lou Cheng bluntly. He then analyzed thoughtfully, “His penultimate palm had a similar effect to the Theravada’s Heart Reflection Punch. These moves both impose the user’s feelings on me. However, the Living Buddha’s move is more advanced. The Heart Reflection Punch can only transmit specific feelings like agony and distress, but the Living Buddha dragged me into his memories. That split second felt like a thousand years to me, during which I relived the lives of generations of Living Buddhas. If anyone below Physical Invulnerability was to be repeatedly exposed to that, they might break down on the spot, or even get dissociative personality disorder.”</p><p>“And thus, the Bodhi Mantra is also known as the Bodhi Heart Mantra,” said Yan Zheke, her pretty eyes looking away. Interested, she made a guess. “Reliving memories of lifetimes… Cheng, could it be that the Bodhi Heart Mantra has a connection to the reincarnation of Living Buddhas? Of course, it might involve methods that are more intricate and systematic.”</p><p>Lou Cheng read the message.</p><p>“Hey, you might be onto something! It sounds plausible! Coach Yan is too astute! [shocked]”</p><p>When they couldn’t find a reincarnation child, the living Buddha of the previous generation will be replaced by the disciple with the most aptitude. However, it’s impossible for the complete ritual of Abhisheka to be performed on them. At times like this, isn’t it possible that a simplified version of Bohdi Heart Mantra is the backup solution to ensuring continuation?”</p><p>“Heh-heh.” Yan Zheke giggled. “Don’t dwell on it. Get some rest. I’m sure you are burnt out. I’m off to morning practice~”</p><p>“Okay. [waves goodbye]”. From his clenched fist, he took the diamond ring and put it on his finger, then adjusted it so that it was facing up. Subconsciously, he gazed at the horizon. The sun went down in the distant west, the clouds blazing red. It was starting to get dark.</p><p>Yan Zheke laid her phone down. In a sudden motion, she flung the quilt aside, rolled over and got off the bed. She freshened up, then changed into her white martial arts suit with black trim.</p><p>She adjusted the ring on her left hand, then went down the stairs on silent feet. Under the dim morning light, she ran towards the grass field.</p><p>At this time, the sky was still dark, with shades of lead piled up. A trifle of orange brilliance appeared in the distance, slowly expanding.</p><p>…</p><p>Lou Cheng took a nap on the bus back. He arrived at the hotel reinvigorated. At night, he spectated the ongoing battles through the TV screen. Peng Leyun made an impossible comeback and took down an opponent who was a cut above him, tenaciously avoiding the fate of elimination.</p><p>Ren Li had yet another good draw. She was against an enemy who was slightly weaker than her. After a tough fight, she won again, which makes her one of the few martial artists who maintained perfect win streaks.</p><p>As he watched the matches unfold, Lou Cheng intrepidly checked the news and spied on his own forum. He discovered that everyone had expected him to lose, so there wasn’t much disappointment. People objectively analyzed the gap between the two parties and speculated on how long he would need to catch up.</p><p>Two years, or perhaps only one!</p><p>The last match of the fourth round ended at 9:30pm. Only 44 martial artists remained. The fifth round that would commence one day later would shrink this number to 32. That’s because the majority of the “survivors” are holding onto one loss.</p><p>Ten minutes later, the organizing committee live-streamed the fifth round of the lot-drawing ceremony. “Kongtong School, Ren Li” was the very first contestant to be picked.</p><p>Then came Ren Li’s opponent:</p><p>“Shushan Study, Wu Qiao!”</p><p>Tickled, Lou Cheng opened the group chat and tagged Ren Li.</p><p>“Here comes your powerful opponent!”</p><p>We are talking about the Sect Master of the Shushan Study! The Mighty One who had once received all five titles and broken the record of most titles, King of Swords, Wu Qiao!</p><p>Of course, he received most of his titles before the era of the legendary twins. Later, due to old age, his form went downhill. He only received one title after Warrior Sage and Dragon King joined the competition.</p><p>Before long, Ren Li popped up.</p><p>“He’s my idol! [sparkling eyes]” she replied.</p><p>“Being able to duke it out with your idol on stage… It’s like a dream come true…” assented Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Taoist Sword Wu Qiao was a true-blue, mighty swordsman. He lost his left arm and half a leg during a life-and-death battle in his early years. People said it was the end of his martial arts career, and he had no hopes of improvement. However, through fearsome willpower, he did the impossible, leaving the legacy of “Sword King”.</p><p>In the past two decades, every user of the sword had more or less looked up to him.</p><p>Just as Lou Cheng sent his message, Peng Leyun popped up as well.</p><p>“It’s a good feeling indeed. I would also like to fight against my long-awaited opponent.”</p><p>“And who’s that?” asked Ann Chaoyang, curiously.</p><p>Peng Leyun pondered (or spaced out for all we know) for a while.</p><p>“There’s too many. It’s hard to pick an example.”</p><p>… Lou Cheng’s mouth twitched.</p><p>“Hey, Priest, your dry humor is as good as my cousin-in-law… [contempt]” he replied.</p><p>Right as he sent it, Peng Leyun’s name was read out by the guest. His opponent was then confirmed.</p><p>“Daxing Temple, Zhi Hai!”</p><p>Wisdom King, Zhi Hai!</p><p>It’s another battle between Heavenly Sons of China!</p><p>“That’s one on the list…” typed Peng Leyun.</p><p>He cared little about how he would be eliminated if he received one more loss.</p><p>That was when Lou Cheng heard his own name. He quickly focused and waited for his opponent’s name to be announced.</p><p>After a short while, the guest turned the slip of paper, displaying it to all.</p><p>“Shangqing Sect, Warrior Sage, Qian Donglou!”</p><p>F*ck… Are you serious? Meeting the final boss in the last round… Lou Cheng was unsure if he should feel happy or not.</p><p>“You are in Match 18. If enough people are eliminated before your match, then you wouldn’t need to fight the Warrior Sage. Same goes for Priest. We might not get to see Match 17 either,” reminded Ann Chaoyang.</p><p>Most of the contestants in the first 16 rounds had one loss already. In fact, in 9 of those matches, the one-loss contestants would have to fight against each other, so there’s bound to be eliminations. As long as 12 more contestants get eliminated, the fifth round will come to an end.</p><p>“Makes sense…” Now Lou Cheng felt a little disappointed.</p><p>When they were done discussing and went back to their own businesses, Ren Li suddenly reappeared with many questions.</p><p>“Who’s your cousin-in-law?”</p><p>“The lot-drawing guest looked a lot like your Sect Master, Priest…”</p><p>“Hello?”</p><p>…</p><p>She was too caught up in excitement just now and forgot to ask all these…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
