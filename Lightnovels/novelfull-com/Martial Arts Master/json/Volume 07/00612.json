Siris looked around and saw the High Priest lying unconscious on the deck chair.</p><p>He didn’t say much and continued forward with light steps. When he walked passed the deck chair, he suddenly lowered his stance and leaned to the side. Mustering all the remaining strength he had, he smashed his elbow on the neck of the High Priest. The High Priest’s neck shattered and his spinal cord broke. Without even giving out a last cry, the High Priest was dead.</p><p>Such a development was beyond Lou Cheng expectation. He looked at him with shocked and surprised and asked,</p><p>“Mr. Siris?”</p><p>To prevent the High Priest from causing an accident when he woke up, Lou Cheng had been reflecting the surrounding and surveying him. He had not expected Siris to strike suddenly. When he thought of stopping him, it was already too late.</p><p>Siris held on to the handle and struggled to get up. He revealed a smile and continued, “If he was alive, he would have revealed our true strength. I’m sure you wouldn’t like to have two, three or even several “Demigods” as our pursuers, right? Obviously, there aren’t that many experts at this level in Khukhang and I’m just giving a more extreme example.”</p><p>His son and son-in-law were all terrified. Both of them covered the mouth of a child to prevent them from screaming out of control.</p><p>Lou Cheng thought about it for a few seconds and nodded his head. He turned around and led Siris and his family to the trail that he came from. From the place where the window was “removed”, he threw them down one after another and the special investigator caught them accordingly. The whole process was done in complete silence and hadn’t alerted any of the stray dogs or cats in the vicinity.</p><p>At the very end, Lou Cheng created a ruckus while communicating to his partner, “You guys can leave first. I have some loose ends to tie up. Let’s meet at the predetermined location later.”</p><p>What kind of loose end? Wang Dong felt lost and had lots of questions. However his professionalism reminded him to not waste any time. Leading Siris and his family, they disappeared into the darkness of the night.</p><p>Lou Cheng turned around and re-entered the room of the High Priest. Due to the privacy of the higher management, only the secret chamber had surveillance devices.</p><p>This time, he controlled his muscles, tendons and Force while swinging his fists and legs. Using the friction between them and the air, he cancelled the sound caused by the breaking of the tables and chairs and the explosion of the wall and floor. If there was someone else in this place, they would definitely be surprised and terrified. This was because Lou Cheng was moving like he was having a battle with a formless phantom. Everything was just like the silent picture films of the early century.</p><p>The requirements of control were extremely high to achieve this. Lou Cheng did not have the supernatural ability of sound waves. If it wasn’t because his mind had mutated and the realm of “All Seeing God” had improved once again, he definitely wouldn’t have been able to do this. Even so, he still had to slow down his action in exchange for higher precision.</p><p>At the very end, he was already sweating profusely. After ransacking the place for a while, he filled a suitcase full of gold and jewellery. They all had the unique cultural characteristics of Nile and there weren’t a lack of antiques among them.</p><p>After completing this, Lou Cheng left the room of the High Priest. He moved through the circular corridor like a phantom and reached the place he had first arrived from. From the third floor that had the window removed, Lou Cheng jumped down. In mid-air, he retracted his breathing and blood flow and landed steadily and quietly on the floor. After which, he agilely blended himself in the darkness.</p><p>After several minutes, the patrolling guards found their unconscious partners. From this, they also noticed the abnormalities of the High Priest’s residence.</p><p>After another fifteen minutes, Lou Cheng met up with Wang Dong, Siris and the group at a carpark in a certain location in Khukhang. A commercial car that had been modified had its engine running was ready to set off anytime.</p><p>“What did you have to do?” Wang Dong pretended to be casual and asked.</p><p>Lou Cheng took a glance at Siris, heaved a sigh, and answered in Mandarin, “Thanks to the teachings of senior Siris, I have learned a lot. I went back to leave some evidence for them.”</p><p>“Evidence?” Wang Dong repeated. “You are trying to mislead our pursuers?”</p><p>“Yeah, under the presumption that there are experts which specialized in tracking, it’s better to be prepared than sorry!” explained Lou Cheng.</p><p>Wang Dong nodded his head while still thinking about it. He pulled opened the door to the driver seat and said, “Let’s talk as we move.”</p><p>…</p><p>At the site of the sacred temple, the “mummy” had arrived in the room of the High Priest and scrutinized the space.</p><p>The skin that he exposed outside his black mantle, other than his face was all wrapped in the yellowish bandages. The thick beard on his face masked his features.</p><p>“An intense battle but no one heard anything…” mumbled the mummy as he formed his own judgement. “The assaulter should have supernatural ability relating to hiding sounds. He should also be slightly stronger than the High Priest.”</p><p>Considering the fact that it was an ambush and the state the room was left in, it was enough for him to determine the level of the other party. At the thought of this, the mummy turned his head to the remaining priest and asked, “Did the surveillance device record anything?”</p><p>“Yes.” A skinny priest, who was in charge of this aspect, brought his laptop in and replayed the surveillance video. There was a part where Lou Cheng jumped to the third level and “removed” the window, a part on him attacking the two guards and knocking them unconscious and a part where he returned and “ransacked” away a suitcase of “trophies”.</p><p>In these videos, as Lou Cheng had deliberately avoided, his face wasn’t captured by the surveillance device. One could only tell that he was from the Eastern countries from the shape of his face.</p><p>“Why didn’t anyone find out when this happened?” asked the mummy.</p><p>“It happened too quickly. It was in the blink of an eye. Without replaying in slow motion, it was hard to tell if it was an illusion or it really happened.” The surveillance supervisor frantically explained.</p><p>What was more important was that there were too many surveillance devices and too many screens to be managed. The sacred temple had also chosen to not rely on the power of technology. Coupled with the fact that he did not have much manpower and it was late at night, how could anyone discover something that happened in the blink of an eye?</p><p>The mummy looked coldly at the supervisor, “In that case, the problem lies in you.”</p><p>As he finished his sentence, he extended his hand and grabbed onto the neck of the surveillance supervisor, lifting the fat and round person up.</p><p>“No…” The voice of the surveillance supervisor was stopped by his throat. It was just like the wailing of chickens that were being culled.</p><p>After struggling a little, he quickly lost all strength. His lustre skin quickly weathered and dried up. In less than thirty seconds, he had completely lost all signs of life and become a real and true dried corpse.</p><p>Plop! The mummy relaxed his hands and let the surveillance supervisor fall to the ground.</p><p>“I’ll go and capture them.,” said the mummy. After which, he mumbled angrily with disdain, “An inhuman from China… A greedy inhuman…”</p><p>He took out his bandages and wrapped them around his head, leaving only his eyes.</p><p>Looking at him now, he was a real mummy. Even his breathing had become dulled and faint as though he was really dead.</p><p>“Signs of life… Taste of life…” The mummy extended his arms and embraced nature. He was constantly mumbling the same words.</p><p>The surrounding area suddenly turned dark. At the microscopic level, there seemed to be oil stains shimmering and sparks lighting up in different colours. They were swaying and were different from one another.</p><p>It was as though Hades had descended, inducing the few priests to lower their noble heads.</p><p>“I’ve found you!” The mummy suddenly said.</p><p>Before his voice moved through the room, he had already disappeared from the room.</p><p>…</p><p>Under the night sky, the heat from the day had dissipated and the surrounding yellow sand was quiet. A modified commercial car was cruising on public road 76.</p><p>When Lou Cheng gave his comments on the evacuation route, he had taken into account the chaotic situation of Deeka and that they might be prone to being stopped. In this case, it would be better for them to head south towards Pori before heading towards the port city, Fartouat.</p><p>With regard to this, Wang Dong and Siris had both agreed to his views.</p><p>As the car cruised past, a part of the silent and desolate desert showed disturbance and the human form of a sand sculpture appeared.</p><p>The sand sculpture wriggled its body a little and all the sand on him fell, revealing the face that was wrapped by bandages and the eerie-looking eyes of the mummy.</p><p>He had run full speed like a blitzing engine and finally caught up with his target!</p><p>As for those priests, he found them to be a burden and believed that they would slow him down. Therefore, he had not brought them with him.</p><p>Looking at the tail light of the car from afar, the bandages on the mummy were stretched. The mummy had seemingly revealed a hard to notice smile.</p><p>“Tsk!” He moaned softly and sank into the yellow sand once again.</p><p>In the commercial car, Siris couldn’t help but compliment Lou Cheng after hearing what he had done, “Not bad. This would make the people from the sacred temple believe that their enemies aren’t as strong and the pursuers they would send would also be relatively weaker.”</p><p>“Hopefully. If several Priests are to come at me together, I probably can only choose to run. Mr. Siris, how’s your recovery so far?” asked Lou Cheng concerningly.</p><p>“Once the injections stopped for more than an hour, the drugs wouldn’t be able to suppress me?” Siris rolled up his sleeves and showed his muscles. He laughed joyously, “I’ve probably recovered half of my strength.”</p><p>Just as Lou Cheng was about to speak again, he suddenly felt his heart twitch. He had a premonition and turned his head to look outside the window.</p><p>The gentle and quiet yellow sand started raging violently and turned dark. Moreover, they were flying towards him one grain at a time.</p><p>No!</p><p>That isn’t yellow sand!</p><p>Those were little bugs that had been fully covered in sand. There were countless amount of them and they were tightly packed, making it really uncomfortable!</p><p>“Oh!” Siris’ grandchild saw the scene and let out a horrifying scream.</p><p>Lou Cheng decisively opened the door and jumped off the car. Landing on one knee, he smashed his fist onto the ground.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>As his fist connected, rings and rings of scorching flames instantly moved outwards. With the support of “Heaven and Earth”, its might become even more widespread.</p><p>The flames spread outwards like ripples, passing through the car and into the dark waves.</p><p>Pa pa pa pa pa!</p><p>Wherever it made contact with the bugs, the bugs would immediately move away. The flames raged on without missing any of the bugs. However, the bugs did not leave behind a corpse. It was as though they had returned to the underworld directly.</p><p>Circles after circles and waves after waves. With Lou Cheng as the centre, in an area of fifty to sixty metres, the black color turned into powder. The ground was cleaned, revealing the yellow sand below.</p><p>After a single punch, Lou Cheng made his visualization, adjusted his organs and threw a punch aiming at the other side of the floor.</p><p>This time, he treated the floor as his opponent and given him an “Internal Explosion” punch!</p><p>An “Internal Explosion” punch at the level of a physical invulnerability expert.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Explosions went off at the surface of the ground, sending violent shocks to the area. Just a short distance from the back of Lou Cheng, a black figure felt the pressure and subconsciously dug out from the yellow sand. The yellowish bandage covered his face, making him looked monstrous and evil.</p><p>The mummy squinted his eyes and almost blurted out.</p><p>“Demigod”!</p><p>A physical invulnerability expert from China!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
