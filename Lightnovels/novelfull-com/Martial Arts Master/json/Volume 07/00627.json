Then refreshed the page and saw a number of replies:</p><p>“Nah, I don’t think Lou Cheng will ever get a title…”</p><p>“To the previous commenter, did you forget about his supernatural ability to defy all naysayers?”</p><p>“I can’t say for other things, but I’m a hundred percent sure Lou Cheng won’t get his title this year!”</p><p>“To the previous commenter, and why’s that?”</p><p>“Isn’t it obvious? It’s already September. He can’t just join national title competitions that are already at grand finals. As for the other titles, the main competition is this year but the finals are next year. He won’t be able to get it this year even if he tried.”</p><p>“Cough. Loyal little fan here. Give him some time, that’s my two cents. It took Wisdom King three years to get his first title, I hope Lou Cheng can do it in three years too.”</p><p>“That reminds me, the Living Buddha hasn’t held any titles… ”</p><p>The topics expanded as many pitched in. Some people even began discussing what title Lou Cheng should use if he clinched champion in Battle of the Kings. Gratified, He Xiaowei held up his cup and took a gulp.</p><p>A person needs to be able to adapt to all situations. You have to admit defeat sometimes. If not, you’ll end up like that All-knowing something. If he wasn’t so stubborn and prideful at that time, he wouldn’t have had to leave the scene after his other accounts failed to go viral.</p><p>…</p><p>In the Wuyue Club, Lei Fang had just finished training. Looking at his phone, he froze in the shower cubicle for two entire minutes.</p><p>He had undressed to only his briefs, revealing his manly and defined muscles. He was going to shower but forgot to twist the tap on after a glance at his phone.</p><p>Physical Invulnerability, Physical Invulnerability, Lou Cheng attained Physical Invulnerability… The words echoed in his head. Then he realized.</p><p>Martial Uncle Lou’s sudden appearance at the Wuyue Club and his usage of Polar Laboratory. The most plausible and reasonable explanation for that was he had already attained Physical Invulnerability and needed it to aid his training.</p><p>Nonetheless, who would have considered this possibility at that time? Even if it did cross his mind, he’ll reject it and laugh about it, then rack his brains for a more reasonable answer.</p><p>Who knew some things simply defied logic? Anything can happen in this vast world!</p><p>Some people were born to defy logic!</p><p>Coming out of his stance, Lei Fang drew a deep breath, then exhaled slowly.</p><p>When he looked at someone like that, he lost all motivation for martial arts. He might not be able to attain Physical Invulnerability even if he put in three to five years of hard work. Yet, it was like a walk in the park for Martial Uncle Lou. So what was the point of him trying? What was the point of him plunging into rigorous training one day after the other, and putting in all those extra hours?</p><p>Thoughts racing, he was overwhelmed by dejection and disappointment. At last, he turned on the tap and doused his head in cold water.</p><p>Drip, drop, drip, drop. The coldness gave him a respite from his depression. He kept encouraging himself.</p><p>What Physical Invulnerability meant and represented—Lei Fang was well aware of that. The difference in status alone was enough to make him grit his teeth and push on.</p><p>Shaking off the water droplets from his hair, he suddenly laughed. A bitter laugh.</p><p>Physical Invulnerability was the border that separated a fish from a dragon. Yet, some people could make the leap with such ease…</p><p>In the training grounds, Zheng Yu and Qian Qiyue stared at their phones in silence.</p><p>“So he’s attained Physical Invulnerability…” said Qian Qiyue emotionally.</p><p>Zhen Yu raised her head.</p><p>“Master probably already knew,” she said in hindsight.</p><p>That night, when he stood on the balcony, this was probably the thing on his mind. Was he feeling sentimental at how the new generation surpassed the old one?</p><p>Qian Qiyue had many things on his mind and plenty of emotions to express. Yet, all he could say in the end was, “The gap between us is huge…”</p><p>Back when Lou Cheng won the Xing Province King of Youth Competition and became a rising star, he still felt competitive. But, after all these years, he was completely numb and utterly defeated. He knew he could never catch up to him. He had to face the facts and reality.</p><p>Zhen Yu stole a glance at him, then laughed sentimentally. “This makes me feel dejected but hopeful at the same time. If Lou Cheng can make the great leap so easily, perhaps Physical Invulnerability isn’t that far away from us after all.”</p><p>“Makes sense…” Qian Qiyue nodded in assent. He turned and walked towards the exit.</p><p>When he was near the exit, he suddenly heard a melancholic murmur from Zhen Yu.</p><p>“But when it’s our turn to try, we might just discover that attaining Physical Invulnerability is next to impossible…”</p><p>…</p><p>The evening sunlight spilled into the room, gilding its interior. Cai Zongming opened his eyes lazily after a twitch of his eyelashes (an effeminate feature Lou Cheng had always made fun of).</p><p>“Sh*t, I slept this long?” He allowed himself a moment to recover from sleep inertia, then held up his phone to check the time.</p><p>In the past two months, he had been gradually taking over the family business. His schedule wasn’t that packed, and he even had time to go on dates with Fang Yuan, who was on summer break. However with everything being new and all, it was stressful enough to make him quite nervous. He was worn out. He had that afternoon to himself so he decided on a quick nap, only to find himself waking up after five. At night, he had to attend a business dinner, and he was dreading it.</p><p>He was languid and didn’t want to get up, so he chatted with Fang Yuan for a while. While he was at it, he carelessly browsed the forums and Weibo.</p><p>A minute later, a sparkle entered his eyes. He was shocked, elated, and in utter disbelief.</p><p>He sent a message to Lou Cheng and got an affirmative reply. He didn’t congratulate him immediately but rolled and sat up straight. Smiling, he looked through the window. At length, he muttered to himself “Oh, dreams…”</p><p>His smile widened. Suddenly, he pulled his sheets away and hopped out of bed. He put on his shirt, casual pants, tie, and suit, then applied a little gel to his hair. He admired his zestful self in the mirror.</p><p>“Not bad! Pretty handsome for a dog!” he said praising himself. He then let out a laugh. “Damn, why am I insulting myself? If Cheng heard me, he would tell me I have improved so much as a comedian that I could now do a duo stand-up comedy by myself!”</p><p>…</p><p>Ji House Residence, Jiangnan Province.</p><p>Ji Jianzhang paced up and down with his hands crossed at his back. In his elation, he chided in annoyed amusement, “Shi Jianguo, you old scum…”</p><p>How could he not mention a word of such excellent news!</p><p>He had first gone to the war-torn areas to settle Lin Que’s matter. He couldn’t promise his safety, but at least he reduced the chances of him running into great danger. Right after he was back in China, he heard the news about his grandson-in-law making the great leap!</p><p>To think they wanted to give him more practice before this!</p><p>Dou Ning, leaning comfortably on the armchair across him, also chided. “That cheeky girl Ke Ke! She never said a word. Treating us two like strangers! What’s the time in Connecticut? I’m going to call and give her an earful!”</p><p>But then again, the girl’s got an excellent eye for people. I would even say it’s comparable to mine back in the days!</p><p>“Three to four AM,” replied Ji Jianzhang tentatively.</p><p>“I will call her when she wakes up.” She pushed back the scolding time. After all, she loved her granddaughter too dearly.</p><p>That was when her phone rung. It was Yan Zheke.</p><p>“Why are you up this late?” chided Dou Ning right as the call connected.</p><p>“I just snuck out of bed to watch the news conference~” replied Yan Zheke cheekily.</p><p>“You have the gall to say it!” said Dou Ning, remembering her previous emotions. “It’s almost been a month since Lou Cheng made the great leap! Not even a word from you!”</p><p>Yan Zheke giggled and replied breezily, “Heh-heh! Do you like the surprise?”</p><p>…</p><p>When the news conference had ended, Lou Cheng returned to Empress Luo’s office.</p><p>Ning Zitong, rather languidly, propped her head up with one hand as she moved the mouse.</p><p>“The club provides a mansion or high-end apartment for all Core Team members. These are all company-owned property. You can go pick one yourself later. If you don’t like any of the locations, you’ll have to make do with it. In the future, it’s up to you whether you want to sell it or rent it out,” she said casually.</p><p>“Okay. I’m okay with anything at the moment,” replied Lou Cheng with a smile.</p><p>His wife was overseas, so it didn’t matter where he lived as long as the house had good sound-ventilation, no leaking issues, and regular cleaning service.</p><p>“Get your lawyer to come in for the reviewing of terms and conditions. In this time, you will focus on practicing the Physical Invulnerability Chapters of the Fire Sect. You don’t have to attend professional competitions with us yet. When you have grasped the basics in late-October, there will be Grandmaster title battle opened to Physical Invulnerability Experts. Haha, that will be your first time appearing in a top-tiered match,” said Ning Zitong, smiling. “Make sure to consult Coach Lü when learning the Physical Invulnerability Chapters of the Fire Sect. He’s not as strong as the Dragon King, is conceited, and has a stubborn mouth. But he does have an exceptional grasp of the Physical Invulnerability Chapters and a knack for coaching. Back then, the Dragon King learned a lot from him too. If not, heh, he wouldn’t have assigned someone this bad-tempered to be the coach.”</p><p>“Sister Ning, why are you so harsh on Coach Lü?” asked Lou Cheng, amused.</p><p>“I’m just stating facts!” said Ning Zitong negligently.</p><p>She remembered something.</p><p>“You’ll be picking a daily assistant later. Leave all the trivial stuff to them and focus on training!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
