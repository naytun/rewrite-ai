Unknowingly, Gu Jianxin had sealed his existence and had dived silently underground. It was as though he had become a real piece of rock. It was not until the moment he ambushed that he erupted and shocked Lou Cheng.</p><p>He had expended so much effort just to conceal himself from Lou Cheng’s ability to sense danger in advance!</p><p>However, Gu Jianxi had still underestimated the special ability from Cultivation. Other than the time he was fooled by Ge Hui, who used a similar Cultivation technique, Lou Cheng had never failed. After his third awakening of supernatural ability and making the great leap, several parts of his martial arts had reached the stage of “Connection with the Gods” (i.e. In other words, the Forbidden stage) where he could sense things before they actually happened.</p><p>The Clown’s concealment was done outstandingly well and used the “Undead Lingering Souls” technique for distraction. It was indeed worthy to be called perfection. However, unusual faint vibrations from the ground still alerted Lou Cheng. As he clenched his fist and smashed across diagonally, he followed through and took a step forward to avoid his vitals from being hit.</p><p>Amidst the spattering stone gravel, he extended both of his arms, lifted his right knee, wriggled his calf and used the tensed up feet to meet the rising punch from Gu Jianxi.</p><p>This seemingly normal move that emulated a “hawk spreading its wings” had secretly hidden “Internal Explosion” elements within!</p><p>Lou Cheng knew that the “Clown” had integrated small amounts of “Ice Sect” techniques and had extremely strong resistance to the cold. For a decision made in a split second, he would naturally be more inclined to use techniques of the “Fire Sect”!</p><p>For an expert who had made the great leap, his mental strength was strong and making visualization was easy and fast. Simplified physical invulnerability moves were just at the tips of his fingers!</p><p>Pfft!</p><p>The tip of Lou Cheng’s toes “pecked” at Gu Jianxi’s fist from the side and injected “Emperor Yan” Force into it.</p><p>At this moment, a dull green light erupted from the “Clown’s” fist and turned into various dancing butterflies. Each “butterfly” brought parts of the Fire Force away and ignited itself. They were green, oily, cold and miserable just like the “Will-o’-the-wisp” in a mass grave.</p><p>Seeing that his Internal Explosion was neutralized, Lou Cheng immediately retracted his leg. He wanted to follow up by stomping his left leg and inject Lord Emperor’s Purple Flame into the ground to make it similar to an erupting volcano.</p><p>Just as he was about to retract his right leg, Gu Jianxi seemed to have lost the majority of his weight suddenly and become a sticky ointment or a soul that entangled with a human. His fist was stuck with the tip of Lou Cheng’s leg and he seemed to be about to be lifted by Lou Cheng. While being able to avoid the subsequent blow to the ground, he could also follow up with a close range assassination technique.</p><p>Seeing this, Lou Cheng immediately changed his plan. While retracting his right leg, he had already leapt into the skies and kicked out consecutively with his left leg!</p><p>In this split moment, Gu Jianxi suddenly retracted his exposed arm. Blurry black shadows in the shape of evil ghosts erupted from the ground and pounced towards Lou Cheng.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Lou Cheng exploded the “Emperor Yan” Force within his left leg. The purplish-white flames raged and swept across, eliminating a substantial number of “ghostly souls”.</p><p>However, these evil ghosts appeared incessantly without a limit in sight. While in mid-air, Lou Cheng seemed to be in a tough position as he was about to lose his defense posture and become a live target!</p><p>Without a change in expression, his extended arms dropped naturally as he formed a seal in front of him before shouting, “Formation!”</p><p>The low voice resounded and the surrounding air flow solidified into a formless cage. The evil ghosts were sealed underground and couldn’t possibly break free any time soon.</p><p>Bam! The concrete gravel sputtered beside Lou Cheng again. A black figure rose into the skies and it was the Clown, Gu Jianxi!</p><p>Both of his eyes glowed a dull shade of green. He didn’t clench his right fist to strike as a punch or use his palm to push or split. Instead, he used his middle finger as the tip of the knife and pierced towards Lou Cheng’s ribs. His fingertips were glowing green while his skin was greyish white as it moved.</p><p>The third move of the Death Sect, “Hades Invitation”!</p><p>Lou Cheng knew clearly that when facing a physical invulnerability move of the “Death Sect”, it would be best to not bear the idea of exchanging blow for blow. Once he couldn’t withstand and his unguarded body was hit, even if it wasn’t a vital spot, it would have similar effects of being hit at the vitals!</p><p>Under normal circumstances, if one’s arm or leg was severed, there would be no way to grow out another. However, with a physical invulnerability expert’s strong control over his body, as long as one could quickly place the severed part back to its original position, one could still heal from it without any future impact. As for being pierced in the stomach, shoulders collapsing and other small injuries, a physical invulnerability expert would be indifferent to it. However, when facing a martial artist who practiced the Death Sect’s skill, a small injury could also be lethal!</p><p>In this critical juncture, Lou Cheng quickly and naturally formed his hand seals. The engraving in his mind was traced out and appeared again.</p><p>He aimed directly at Gu Jianxi and shouted in a serious and mighty tone, “Army!”</p><p>This was the complete “Army” Formula and was two to three folds stronger than the simplified version where one simply used his breathing and blood flow to trigger one’s body!</p><p>Bloodlust shot through the skies as a thousand edges gathered. Cold and ruthless arrows fired towards Gu Jianxi’s body, making him feel like he was in hell and were ambushed from all directions.</p><p>As a martial artist who had emerged from a mountain of corpses, the Clown’s movement was only affected slightly before he shook off the impact. He had not only seen such scenes in an illusion but had also experienced it in reality!</p><p>However, the momentary pause to raise his hand allowed Lou Cheng to grab onto the opportunity to ignite part of the “Emperor Yan Force”. Lou Cheng’s body was like a rocket undergoing secondary propulsion. With it, he moved a foot to the side and landed on both feet.</p><p>Without leaving an opening for Gu Jianxi to regulate and attack again, he quickly formed another seal with both of his hands and shouted in a low tone, “Attainment!”</p><p>A mysterious feeling that connected with heaven and earth descended. Lou Cheng pushed off with his feet a little and his entire body flew out at a speed that left afterimages.</p><p>He didn’t take the opportunity to counterattack but instead had chosen to open up the distance. This was because a martial artist from the Death Sect could make a sacrifice to a certain extent in order to land a deadly blow and this was the reason why they usually wouldn’t fare as well in a prolonged battle!</p><p>Seeing that Lou Cheng moved further and further away from him and shrunk quickly in his vision, the glow in Gu Jianxi’s eyes turned cold as he raised his left hand and bent his fingers. With his finger joint, he knocked fiercely at the space in front of him as though he was knocking a door.</p><p>Dong!</p><p>Lou Cheng who was retreating at high speed instantly felt that his “Ice Heart” was hit by a large hammer. It was on the verge of shattering and raged fiercely within.</p><p>An intense feeling of fear welled up and his body shivered a little. His body stiffened and his movements slowed.</p><p>The first move of the Death Sect, “Ghostly Midnight Knock”!</p><p>Gu Jianxi was able to use it as he wished without the need to make too many preparations. Moreover, he had made references to the unique skills of the Ice Sect and made specific improvements to it to specifically counter the “Enemy Heart Freezing Move”!</p><p>Fear welled up like the tides and knocked on Lou Cheng’s will frantically. However, Lou Cheng had also experienced a lot and could still barely hold on. Once again, he traced out another “Forwarding” Formula!</p><p>Lou Cheng didn’t say it out but simply changed his hand seals. After which, Lou Cheng was able to suppress the fear within his heart and reform his “Ice Heart”.</p><p>At this moment, Gu Jianxi had already approached him like a phantom. Wriggling his right arm, his forearm expanded as he swung his fist from the side. On the surface, a dull green light moved creepily.</p><p>Just as Lou Cheng raised his arms to block, he suddenly had a sense of danger. He formed a layer of his right leg and kicked out accordingly.</p><p>At this moment, he finally noticed that the Clown”was punching the top and kicking the bottom at the same time. That kick was silent and imperceivable to Lou Cheng senses!</p><p>The seventh move of death sect, “Shadowless Killing Kick”!</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Before Gu Jianxi’s fist landed on the guard Lou Cheng formed with his arm, his left leg had stomped onto the whipping kick of Lou Cheng. The thick layer of ice was instantly shattered and turned into greyish white powder before melting several seconds later.</p><p>Bam! The Clown fist was blocked and stopped. Lou Cheng instantly felt a chilling sensation invading that ignored his ordinary Fire Force. Both of his arms seemed to have temporarily gone dead.</p><p>This was a double trap that Gu Jianxi had prepared specifically for Lou Cheng who had the ability to sense danger in advance. He had chosen to weaken the strength of his Shadowless Killing Kick and instead increased his “Hades Force” in “Undead Lingering Souls”.</p><p>The initial move was that the above attack was a feint and the kick was the real attack. However, it was now seventy percent strength in the kick and thirty percent in the punch above!</p><p>Once he lost control of both of his arms, Lou Cheng didn’t panic. He twisted his waist and swung his left arm out as a whip.</p><p>At the same time, he strode ahead with the same leg and ignited raging faint purple flames. Using them as a wall of fire, he furiously sent it towards Gu Jianxi.</p><p>A technique of “Fire Sect’s””Incinerate City, Vaporizing Lake”.</p><p>At this moment, Gu Jianxi revealed a stiff smile. He did not retreat and had chosen to advance instead. Without making additional defensive manoeuvers, he simply tilted his body to avoid the whipping attack.</p><p>Bam! The purple flame wall smashed onto his legs and ignited. However, Gu Jianxi seemed to have become a corpse that had lost all sensations of pain. He did not even flinch at all.</p><p>His left arm moved like a cobra and shot out rapidly towards Lou Cheng who had exhausted his moves. Without any delay, he injected all his Force into him.</p><p>At such a close distance, such attacks arrived at a blink of an eye. Lou Cheng only managed to pull his body slightly to avoid his neck from being hit.</p><p>Poof!</p><p>Gu Jianxi’s left index finger pressed onto Lou Cheng shoulder bone. An intense sense of danger could be felt right away.</p><p>The ninth move of “Death Sect”, “Killer Strike. The Final Grin”!</p><p>Lou Cheng’s thoughts flashed passed quickly as he saw both legs of the Clown’s had turned all black. At the same time, he saw scorching red flames covering the hair between his leg. Suddenly, he couldn’t help but feel pain.</p><p>I thought I was good at exchanging blows for victory and an expert in life and death matches. In the end, there’s always someone more ruthless and better than me in these aspects.</p><p>If my strike was a little stronger… He gasped at the thought of it and no longer resisted. He knew clearly that Gu Jianxi was relying on his body’s unique transformation to an undead and the extremely strong recovery ability of a physical invulnerability expert while taking the risks.</p><p>Obviously, if this was a life and death match, considering his ruthlessness, he would likely have done the same even if he didn’t have such conditions available to him.</p><p>This was the Clown, Gu Jianxi.</p><p>The referee’s mouth was also twitching. He quickly raised his right arm and announced loudly,</p><p>“Gu Jianxi wins!”</p><p>Drops of flames started flaking down and a layer of dull green light covered the burnt areas as though he was wearing a pair of fashionable long pants.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
