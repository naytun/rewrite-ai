Yan Zheke was currently in a perilous situation. For him, every second was precious and every minute counted!</p><p>The speed and mobility of a car couldn’t be compared to an inhuman stage expert. Once they faced an enemy at a similar stage, they wouldn’t be able to shake him off or get past him. At this moment, if he still had to consider what was happening in front and behind him, or worry about anything, or have stayed in the car, he would have been a sitting duck. The car would have become a metal coffin for the group. Lou Cheng would have indirectly killed everyone he planned to protect. In his two previous actions, he had fully made use of this point and clearly knew it. So when he saw the red-eyed man in military uniform approaching him, he decisively jumped out of the car to face the enemy.</p><p>He no longer had time to consider if there were other enemies. If he couldn’t get over this problem, what was the use of thinking about what would come next?</p><p>Obviously, in a split moment, Lou Cheng had already planned for the worst and given instructions to Yan Zheke. If Yan Zheke was to encounter another strong enemy attack or situation that she couldn’t avoid, he asked her to abandon the car and ignore Zhou Yong and the rest. At that time, he would protect her and risk his life to force open a road for survival. He would retreat into the desert and sought hopes for surviving with an inhuman’s running speed and ability to cover various terrains.</p><p>Before Fario could complete his sentence, Lou Cheng had pounced in front of him. Stretching his right leg ahead, he stomped on the ground, exerted force as it ploughed in, and flipped up dirt. Each piece was as hard as stone and shot towards the entire body of his opponent like a sharp arrow!</p><p>With a stomp and a flick, he changed his position like a phantom and suddenly appeared at the side of his opponent. Retracting his breathing and blood flow to his lower abdomen, Ice and Fire started rotating and achieved Dan equilibrium.</p><p>In this instant, Fario’s expression turned as pale as a dead man. His entire body had became a dried corpse.</p><p>He merely lifted his left arm and set it in front of his eyes. As for the remaining attacks, he didn’t care or mind and allowed the dirt arrows to smash into his body. His clothes were tattered and his skin and muscles cracked. However, they only appeared pale and no blood was flowing out.</p><p>Under his feed, the green oasis and well-nourished soil instantly dried up, coagulated and fell into pieces before scattering into the sand. The surrounding plants were withering one after another as though someone had sucked away their lives.</p><p>A dull and faint light started rising from both of his legs as he was enveloped by an evil will. Fario turned his body slightly, swung his fist from the left to the right. His punch was heavy and seemed to carry the weight of several hundred lives.</p><p>He wore a pair of faint gold gloves. At the location of his joints, a cold glow was shimmering over the protruding bones.</p><p>This was the horrifying inheritance of the “Pluto” bloodline in Nile, “Withering Trial”!</p><p>Once he hit his opponent, not only was he able to force him back with his weird strength, but he could also invade his flesh and made it dry up!</p><p>Fario had intended to go forward with his full strength before Lou Cheng figured out who he was and what he was good at. He aimed to finish the fight in a few exchanges to prevent any accidents from happening!</p><p>If he could finish Lou Cheng off, who was at the same level as him and was rather well known, in the armed helicopter before Lou Cheng’s companions were finished, this would have definitely been a record that was worth showing off. It would be beneficial for raising his own confidence to take the last step and become a demigod!</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Fario swung his fist from the side towards Lou Cheng. He had risked injury previously so that he could stop his opponent from dodging!</p><p>On the other side, Yan Zheke, who was driving, had her eyes fully focused at the front. She was observing the guards and the helicopter that appeared from time to time while listening to the rotating blades of the helicopter to tell if it was flying high or low or if it was near or far.</p><p>Rumble! Ta ta ta! Rumble! The maroon red car moved like a swimming fish and could always make exaggerated maneuvers. It advanced ahead sometimes but also retreated from time to time. Surrounded by the dust and smoke, it approached the checkpoint and attempted to get past it from the side.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s emotions were tense. She knew that it was very dangerous to be completely on the passive side. If she were to make any errors, she would be hit immediately. Without any prior experience, she could only imitate Lou Cheng and constantly turn water into ice and reminded herself to stay calm and composed.</p><p>Intelligence originated from silence and wisdom originated from wisdom. Having been sickly since she was young, she wasn’t afraid of death and soon recovered her rationality. She quickly left behind the ridiculous and negative thoughts.</p><p>At this very moment, Lou Cheng who was maintaining Dan equilibrium was trying to convince himself himself that because Ke is already a quasi Dan-stage expert, she would definitely be fine. He forced his conscious to the highest point of the “universe” as he coldly looked down on the eternal stars and darkness below him.</p><p>He quickly shifted the radiant heat and traced out a never-give-up and soaring “Fighting” formula!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Just as Fario swung out his “Withering Trial” punch, Lou Cheng exploded his Dan force and expanded his body.</p><p>Instantly, in the eyes of Fario, an opponent that wasn’t even 1.8 metres tall suddenly transformed into a monster nearing 2 metres in height. His muscles were solid and well defined and his veins were fear-inducing. Looking at him, he was just like the giant described in legends!</p><p>At the same time, Lou Cheng stared angrily at his opponent. He swung his left fist from the side and broke through the air barrier. The howling of the air as his fist cut through could be heard as it sounded along with the explosion!</p><p>“Force Concentration” stacked with “Fighting” Formula!</p><p>Double explosion, absolute attack!</p><p>The shock in his eyes only lasted for an instance. Soon, Fario saw his fist colliding with his opponent’s.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>At the point of contact, it was as though an explosion had occurred. The faint gold gloves sunk in and were distorted. Fario’s bones cracked, and the surface of Lou Cheng’s skin had lost its lustre. His flesh had dried up. The wind caused by the impact blew the surrounding sand and stones into the air, resulting in a mini dust storm.</p><p>At this moment, shock and surprise flashed passed through Fario’s eyes. He felt that the strength of his opponent wasn’t inferior to a “Demigod” and had even exceeded a typical punch or kick from a “Demigod”!</p><p>Fario had fought with “Demigod” previously and even lasted for several tens of seconds. However, that was when the other party was restraining himself. In addition, it was also partly because of the way he chose to fight. Facing a “Demigod” how could he possibly go for a direct confrontation!</p><p>Oh no!</p><p>Torrential “God’s strength” welled up. Fario shook his arm violently and moved back quickly to dissipate the force and prevent himself from fracturing his bones and losing balance in the process.</p><p>Lou Cheng didn’t pay attention to the areas that had “withered”. He circulated his breathing and blood flow to trigger his body. Taking a step forward, he quickly closed the distance between his enemy and him and didn’t give his opponent the time to gather himself.</p><p>With another “Force Concentration”, radiant stars moved again. Lou Cheng strode ahead with his left leg. His arm turned into a whip with the momentum as he grew several centimetres and increased his strength several times. The veins on his muscles were like dragons circulating and crossing, showing their clear superior strength!</p><p>There’s no fire or ice, just purely strength!</p><p>Double explosion second consecutive strike!</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Between them, it was as though there was a high-speed fighter plane passing by. Lou Cheng’s whipping kick formed afterimages and smashed down from the top onto the enemy who couldn’t avoid in time.</p><p>Fario instantly “corpsified”. He lifted his heavy arms and hurriedly threw out a punch to block using the power from “Hades”.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>This “whip” caused fire sparks to scatter. It caused the gloves split. It caused Fario’s arm to almost bend in an unnatural way. It caused Fario to sink into the ground to almost the level of his ankle, and it caused Fario to be temporarily immobilized!</p><p>Grabbing on to this opportunity, Lou Cheng took a deep breath and retracted his breathing and blood flow. He replenished his “Ice Fire” and traced out the “Fighting” Formula.</p><p>In a loud boom, countless capillaries in his eyes ruptured. The blood-red eyes locked firmly onto his opponent as the rage he felt over the unreasonable targeting of his little fairy girl and placing her in danger erupted.</p><p>Double explosion, third consecutive strike!</p><p>Bam! Lou Cheng twisted his shoulder, pulling his arm and used his dried up fist as a weapon towards the belly of Fario.</p><p>Fario only managed to pull his legs slightly out. He could only “corpsify” again, gritted his teeth, lowered his hand and grabbed towards the fist of his opponent.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Power scattered and the explosion was strong. Lou Cheng’s fist landed on Fario’s stomach despite his palm blocking it from the front. His clothes and flesh were blasted away, leaving behind a hole! However, there was no blood dripping!</p><p>As an expert that had been on the battlefield for a long time, Fario did not pay too much attention to this little injury. The soil under his feet weathered rapidly. A faint glow flashed passed his eyes and he was about to launch his counterattacks.</p><p>At this moment, using his “All Seeing God” realm, he turned his withered fist into a palm and grabbed onto the hand that Fario had placed at the stomach area. He swung it violently, causing the joints throughout Fario’s body to crack and dissipated the strange force gathered in his opponent’s body. Fario’s muscles instantly lost strength like a cobra that had been subdued.</p><p>Darkness flashed passed in his head. It was chilling and heavy. Lou Cheng pulled his corresponding shoulder and sent another fist at Fario. White frost fog was surrounding his fist and the chilling cold was invasive.</p><p>Severe Warning!</p><p>Not good! Fine hairs on Fario’s neck stood up. He opened his mouth suddenly and spat a mouthful of seemingly illusory and seemingly real black blood. It was stinky and vomit-inducing.</p><p>He wanted to force his opponent to dodge, grabbed on to the opportunity, turned the tables around and seized the upper hand!</p><p>At this moment, Lou Cheng did not move his body or legs at all! He merely tilted his head to the left side and avoided the attack on his eyes!</p><p>Bam! His punch landed on Fario’s shoulder and the bones sunk in.</p><p>Ssk ssk ssk! Half of his face came into contact with the black liquid and severely corroded, making him hideous and terrifying.</p><p>Fario started to lose his conscious and felt like he was about to fall into a long slumber. Lou Cheng moved his other arm and smashed it on the enemy’s head.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Fario’s head exploded. Pieces of red and white flesh fell, leaving nothing complete on the ground.</p><p>There wasn’t even a shred of regret or fear left behind.</p><p>Lou Cheng did not take an additional glance at him. He turned his body around quickly, picked up a stone and held it in his hand. He injected his Fire Force into the stone together with the stimulation he had after using the simplified “Attainment” Formula. He aimed at the armed helicopter and threw the stone towards it.</p><p>Bam! This stone shot flew like a rocket missile and quickly cut through several hundreds of metres. Behind Lou Cheng, the headless Fario finally fell to the ground.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
