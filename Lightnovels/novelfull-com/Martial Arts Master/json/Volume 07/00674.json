It was as though he had balanced on an invisible cable, or a mystical mountain peak was pushing him up.</p><p>He opened his stance slightly, looked towards Dragon King, Chen Qitao, and laughed,</p><p>“If the skies crack, that can be mended. But if a human causes the calamity, he shall not live!”</p><p>As he finished his sentence, he began falling suddenly like an eagle with eyes locked on its prey. He was fierce, fast, and sharp.</p><p>His palms were curved into the shape of claws and an electric current was growing from each fingertip.</p><p>Chen Qitao wouldn’t possibly stand there and allow Qian Donglou to attack. He continuously shifted his stride amidst the strong gusts of wind, changing to a leap whenever he neared a broken high voltage cable.</p><p>A pounce forward was followed by a pause. There seemed to be an elastic ctied to the back of Qian Donglou that allowed him to move in mid-air to attack, and he moved upwards as he pounced and retreated. No one could tell when or where the lightning would strike. As a result, Chen Qitao could only change his position constantly.</p><p>The Warrior Sage had fully leveraged the advantage of the magnetized home ground and gained the supernatural ability to fly.</p><p>In other places, he would have had to undergo a long battle and deeply modified his surroundings to achieve this. At this moment, he was unmatchable.</p><p>Locked down by Qian Donglou’s aura, Chen Qitao couldn’t find time to blast attacks into the skies. Instead, he had to guard against his opponent’s lightning strike at all times. If he diverted his attention to other things, he might give his opponent a chance.</p><p>As he moved through the air and watched Chen Qitao move towards a certain boundary, a green and silver seal appeared in the eyes of Qian Donglou.</p><p>Zzzt zzzt zzzt!</p><p>Where the high voltage cable was broken and touching to the ground, the electric sparks suddenly exploded upwards into a shape of a blooming sunflower.</p><p>They formed bars of a cage and trapped Dragon King, Chen Qitao within, simultaneously contracting towards the center, intending to shroud Qian Donglou.</p><p>At this moment, Qian Donglou descended rapidly, pulled by the earth. He finally triggered the lightning attack that was hovering above everyone’s head.</p><p>He bent his ten fingers and extended them forward to lock down his opponent from afar. After which, he released shots of electric snakes.</p><p>As the petals of the electric sunflower closed up, Chen Qitao repeated his old move. Stomping his feet, he shot to the skies. His fist was covered in raging purple lava and his legs were trembling, triggered by the electricity.</p><p>Seeing that the two of them were going to repeat the previous collision, Qian Donglou was pushed up by an invisible hand. He leapt up eerily over the rising fist of Chen Qitao and ended diagonally above Dragon King’s back.</p><p>Pa! Qian Donglou extended his left leg and bright purple snakes towards the back of his enemy’s head as he attacked at the opening.</p><p>Lou Cheng cringed at what he saw but didn’t blink .</p><p>If it was him, he would not be able to turn the tables.</p><p>Suddenly, a faint purple fireball formed behind Chen Qitao’s head but collapsed just as quickly.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The raging flames from the fireball’s collapse affected both parties. The flames that remained either supported the soles of Qian Donglou or flew towards the head of Dragon King.</p><p>Qian Donglou seemed to have stepped on a spring, and he flew back instantly. Chen Qitao extended his neck, and, using the upward momentum and expansion of his muscles, he allowed the flames to cover him freely.</p><p>After the initial rage, the petals of flames became small and well-tamed snakes that floated above the Dragon King’s head and body. He looked majestic, as though the real Emperor Yan had surfaced on earth once again.</p><p>Lou Cheng was awestruck by this move which originated from the Nine Rotations of Five Flames. Descend of the Sun.</p><p>I have just started my journey on the path to controlling fire…</p><p>As this thought flashed through his mind, Warrior Sage, sent flying by the airwaves, turned around. Placing his hands together, took a deep breath as though this was what he had intended all along</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The lightning strike from the clear skies shocked Lou Cheng and the others who were still deafened from the humming. Dragon King, who was on the battlefield and had not yet landed, was clearly shaken.</p><p>Pa! Qian Donglou pulled his palms apart to form a thin purple blade of light, exactly like a real lightning bolt. It struck onto the body of Chen Qitao.</p><p>The ninth move of the Thunder Sect, Cloudless Thunderclap.</p><p>Facing this move, if one hadn’t noticed it beforehand and planned a dodging manouver, it would be unavoidable. In terms of speed, it was way ahead of Flying Dragon Shot of the Xinzhai Sect, or Lu Yongyuan’s Extreme Shock.</p><p>In an instant, hideous black wounds appeared from the left cheek to the right chest of Chen Qitao. There were still electric snakes lingering in him that numbed him as he fell to the ground like a rock.</p><p>This Cloudless Thunderclap had unparalleled speed but didn’t possess the power that came with it. The damage it dealt was similar to what a person would receive from an electric discharge.</p><p>If it wasn’t so, it wouldn’t be able to reach such a speed.</p><p>As his his breathing and bloodflow slowed, the numbness sank inwards. Unpanicked, Dragon King executed Force Concentration calmly to remove the lingering effects on the body.</p><p>Before he landed on both legs, Qian Donglou had pressed ahead once again to strike downwards. This time, the skies turned dark and ominous clouds gathered. Silver snakes formed and slithered within, growing.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>Thick lightning struck down like rain with every strike downwards by the Warrior Sage, who leapt continuously upwards. Chen Qitao was completely occupied just dealing with these attacks. Every strand of his hair was on end and his body trembled from time to time. The intervals between this trembles were getting shorter and shorter.</p><p>Leveraging on the advantage of home ground, he finally got the upper hand and suppressed his opponent.</p><p>In this calamitous scene, Chen Qitao didn’t panic. He was injured but not finished, continuously firing off heavy purple flames and violent cannon punches. He struck the electric arcs with his fire as they scattered and caused the temperature to climb higher and higher. The battlefield was cracking from the lack of moisture.</p><p>Though he was far away, Lou Cheng could feel that the air he breathed getting hot and scorching his windpipes.</p><p>Moreover, this was the windpipe of a Fire Sect Physical Invulnerability expert who had trained multiple times in the Volcano Experiment Lab. If it was any martial artist below the stage of inhuman, at this very moment, he might very well be severely injured and on the verge of death unless they held their breath.</p><p>“Mirage, Suffocating Hell,” mumbled Lou Cheng.</p><p>This was the eighth move of the Fire Sect and involved changing the environment into a high-temperature space and making it hard for the opponent to breathe and perhaps experience mirage-like illusions. At the same time, the scorching hot air would affect the circulation of one’s organs and one’s ability to think.</p><p>This attack disregarded who might be injured. However, as the executioner specialized in controlling fire and had undergone training in the Volcano Experiment Lab, he would find it easy to manage. Even if it exceeded one’s limits, the impacts they suffered would be much lower than their opponent’s.</p><p>Lu Yan, who was on the side, said softly,</p><p>“Dragon King’s first aim must be to turn the situation around. The second aim is to destroy the surrounding environment and weaken the home ground advantage so as to lay the groundworks for the next member.”</p><p>Lou Cheng nodded his head but soon asked a question,</p><p>“If this goes on, won’t his clothes ignite and turn to ashes.”</p><p>At that point, the scene might be too stunning to watch……</p><p>Lu Yan turned his head and gave him a strange look,</p><p>“Our martial arts suits had anti-fire materials added into it. It should be the same for Shangqing Sect too.”</p><p>This is common knowledge and you don’t know about it?</p><p>“Aha,” laughed Lou Cheng. “So that’s how it is.”</p><p>Can’t you let me be a martial arts fanatic for these few months?</p><p>After a period of an intense battling, the temperature was still rising rapidly. Qian Donglou’s ascension and descension weren’t as smooth as before. However, he coujld still leverage the external strength of the magnetism. Together with the lightning from the ominous clouds, each strike was stronger than the other.</p><p>“Nine Heavens Ensemble!”</p><p>Chen Qitao was on the verge of collapsing from the attacks and tiny electric snakes were coursing across the surface of his skin. The might of his punches and kicks was</p><p>getting weaker and weaker.</p><p>Suddenly, his movement slowed. Qian Donglou turned into a bolt of lightning and struck down mercilessly. With the low lying ominous clouds and electric snakes dancing as the backdrop, he was going directly for his opponent’s vitals.</p><p>Silently, Chen Qitao swung his left fist to the side of his head. Layers and layers of purple flames covered his fist as it looked unimaginably heavy. Surprisingly, it caused Warrior Sage to change direction mid-air to collide with it.</p><p>Zzzt!</p><p>The purple flames did not dissipate but stuck firmly onto Qian Donglou’s palm. At the same time, the electric arc sank into Chen Qitao’s body and caused him to shiver uncontrollably.</p><p>Amidst the shaking, Chen Qitao seemed to have prepared for it and raised his right arm, his fingers clenched loosely, seemingly in control of the surrounding nature. From afar, Lou Cheng had the feeling that the tumultuous area was completely isolated.</p><p>Considering that he was at a disadvantage with little chance to turn things around, Chen Qitao had chosen injuries in exchange for a winning opportunity as he pounced back strongly.</p><p>Restriction Sect, Clear Jade Chapter!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
