It was one’s innate ability to protect oneself and also the restraints formed from one’s past knowledge. Without a strong will and clear confidence, one would definitely not be able to break through it.</p><p>However, in just a split second for Lou Cheng, it had already collapsed. It was shattered by the resonance of the crazy and torrential mind with one’s root pulps.</p><p>In that instant, Lou Cheng was just like a newborn baby exposed to the scorching hot sun and immersing in the bone-freezing chill. Every part of his body had become very fragile. He felt horrible and on the verge of falling!</p><p>However, his body had been well polished and trained. Despite the injuries to it, they quickly recovered at the microscopic level, allowing him to successfully pass the adaptation period.</p><p>Bump bump bump!</p><p>Lou Cheng could only feel that his pituitary gland in his brain was beating at the same time with his abstract mind and his body’s root pulps. They were beating at the usual pace of expanding and contracting when Lou Cheng was making his visualization.</p><p>Bump bump bump!</p><p>The space around him shook as though it was responding to the changes in him!</p><p>At this very moment, in the senses of Lou Cheng, the surrounding Heaven and Earth had already changed. The cosmic seemed to have been pulled to him. Pitch black darkness had engulfed everything around him with only patches of scorching hot suns decorating it and warming the small area where his body lay.</p><p>This was an illusion and also a reflection of stars in the universe. They had appeared because of resonance.</p><p>Bump bump bump!</p><p>Every single spot of Lou Cheng’s mind and root pulps had turned into an independent, balanced and rotating universe. It was becoming more and more in tune with that illusion, gradually forming a mysterious connection.</p><p>All the pores on his body had opened up and started breathing. When they breathed in, gusts of air flooded in and when they breathed out, cold and hot air would intertwine. Small sparks of fire could be seen in the shadows.</p><p>Yan Zheke stood by the side and watched as the scene unfolded. She felt a little like she was watching fireflies dance in the night sky. However, the sensation she got from switched between chilling and scorching.</p><p>The inside of the room had turned dark. White frost formed and snowflakes fell. With them as complements, the room gradually brightened up. Part of them started to melt but they were well-coordinated and in balance.</p><p>“So beautiful… So this is the connection with the Heaven and Earth…” mumbled Yan Zheke. Controlling her muscles, she wriggled them slightly, rebounding off the micro things that were falling on her skin.</p><p>In the consulate, the people who were sleeping in the main hall and corridor suddenly shivered in cold and could feel the chilling North wind blowing past.</p><p>They opened their eyes, still lost at what had happened. All they could see was white snow falling sporadically, showing the most beautiful side of it.</p><p>“I must be dreaming…” the people mumbled to themselves.</p><p>The reality was that they were in the middle of the hot summer in August. This should be an oasis that is surrounded by desert!</p><p>“It’s real, it’s real!” Someone extended their hand and touched the falling snowflakes. They could feel the cold and the dampness after the snow melted.</p><p>At this moment, a ray of light rose up like a replicate of the afternoon sun. It lit up the consulate and brought warmth to the people who were shivering in cold.</p><p>However, this did not affect the devastation of the North wind. It was as though the cold and the heat had separate territories. However, the boundary was still blurry as they gradually took shape.</p><p>The people around were dumbfounded. They were shocked by the illusory and beautiful scene in front of them but were filled with doubts and questions.</p><p>A blizzard in June often signified huge grievances. In that case, what would snowing in August and under the hot scorching sun mean?</p><p>“Physical Invulnerability! There’re physical invulnerability experts fighting!” A man, who had been watching top tier professional leagues, was struck with a sudden realization and exclaimed frantically.</p><p>It would be difficult for a fight at this level to not affect the surrounding areas. The consulate might just collapse in the midst of it!</p><p>“Yeah, physical invulnerability!” Several people had regained their consciousness and seconded the view. Just when they were thinking of running out, they were afraid of encountering the fight directly.</p><p>Just as fear and panic quickly spread among the people, the light ray turned dull and the wind got weaker. Everything dissipated quickly and the environment returned back to the typical conditions of six o’clock in the morning. Dawn had just broken, but it was still a little dim outside.</p><p>Peng Leyun stood at the side of the window and stared blankly into space. No one knew where his thoughts floated to. After a period of time, his eyes finally regained some vitality. He heaved a sigh emotionally, “The encounters and situations have all become part of his wealth…”</p><p>“A blessing in disguise…”</p><p>Lou Cheng opened his eyes gradually as the illusion faded away. All he could see was that he was in a small room that could only fit a bed and a chair and a beautiful girl smiling radiantly and looking at him.</p><p>This was the truth.</p><p>“How was it?” Yan Zheke was restraining her joy and asked with anticipation.</p><p>“Not too bad.” Lou Cheng controlled himself and smiled faintly.</p><p>The great leap had been made and all that’s left is the process!</p><p>…</p><p>Nine o’clock in the morning, ship after ship approached the jetty of Fartouat, covering the sea surface.</p><p>They were flying the flags of China and drew cheers from the crowd.</p><p>Lou Cheng bade goodbyes to Peng Leyun and accompanied Yan Zheke to board the passenger liner that was evacuating. After more than two hours, they arrived at the ancient Wei City. The Shushan study had already made arrangement for Yan Zheke’s return flight back to China. It was a flight managed by the military.</p><p>At the entrance of the airport, the couple stayed together for a while. Yan Zheke smiled faintly, waved her hands and said to Lou Cheng,</p><p>“Go now. I’m more assured that you can finish your mission now!”</p><p>“I have always given my all under the condition that I wouldn’t place my safety in jeopardy.” Lou Cheng sent off his wife with a smile. After which, he took out his phone and called his master.</p><p>“Hey, brat, have you sent that Yan brat to somewhere safe?” Geezer Shi asked carefreely.</p><p>“I have sent her to the airport in Wei City. She will be boarding the flight in just a while.,” answered Lou Cheng. After which, he continued, “Master, there’s something I have to tell you.”</p><p>“What’s the matter? Could it be that you don’t want to return to Nile?” asked Shi Jianguo calmly.</p><p>Lou Cheng cleared his throat before answering, “Master, I have made the great leap!”</p><p>“What?” Geezer Shi dug his ears and coughed violently. After some time, he asked, “You have reached physical invulnerability?”</p><p>“Not yet. I still haven’t consolidated the connection stage and can’t be considered a real physical invulnerability expert yet,” answered Lou Cheng honestly. After which, he described the cause of his transformation, “After Ke had achieved balance and formed her Dan, I realized what I’m lacking in and found the uncoordinated point that resulted in being unable to achieve the breakthrough. The details are… After making adjustments to the new visualization diagram, I have all the conditions and therefore attempted the breakthrough by myself…”</p><p>He illustrated the whole process without hiding anything and covered all the details.</p><p>Attempted the breakthrough by myself… Geezer Shi didn’t speak a word and continued listening. In the end, he laughed twice before continuing, “Not bad, not too bad.”</p><p>Speaking to this point, he emphasized and added, “You have not let down your master’s hopes on you!”</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled joyously. Without further ado, he asked about the proper business,</p><p>“Master, have you passed the information with regard to Siris to the military? Will it be alright for me to contact him based on the original plan?”</p><p>“I have given to them. Also, there’s no issue to contact him as planned.” Geezer Shi answered in a daze.</p><p>“That’s great. I’ll look for them now.” Lou Cheng took the initiative and hung up the phone.</p><p>Du du du. Listening to the phone, Geezer Shi stood there for five full seconds before drinking a mouthful of alcohol and said, “He has made the breakthrough just like this?”</p><p>He kept his hands behind him and walked back and forth for some time. He was in a dilemma.</p><p>“I have to tell Geezer Ji about it… Forget it. How do I bring it up? I don’t even know where to start… That stinky brat!”</p><p>“It will just be a matter of time before Geezer Ji finds out. In that case, I shall not tell him then…”</p><p>…</p><p>After contacting the military and getting the information, Lou Cheng read through it and had a rough understanding of the situation.</p><p>Siris was an expert in Nile and he was approximately forty to fifty years old. He had not reached the “Demigod” level and typically lived in Deeka. On the night the turmoil erupted, he took the initiative and contacted the Chinese Embassy, providing them with substantial confidential information. With his strength, as long as he wasn’t targeted by other experts, it wouldn’t be a problem for him to evacuate from Nile. His core request was for shelter and protection.</p><p>After some discussion, the military agreed to his request. After which, Siris had headed to Khukhang in the middle of the night and intended to leave together with his son and family. However, he had not returned from the trip and couldn’t be contacted.</p><p>“Seems like I have to head to Khukhang first…” Lou Cheng sat in the room of the passenger liner heading towards Fartouat. His eyes were closed and he tried to connect with the Heaven and Earth, strengthening it little by little.</p><p>Surrounding him, the sunlight dulled and the shadows darkened. From time to time, the light would turn radiant and shimmer.</p><p>…</p><p>Khukhang, within a building.</p><p>Constantine, who was wearing a black tuxedo, looked at the direction of the military base. Holding on to a cup of alcohol that was as red as blood, he said, “Sathah has discovered the problem and the security is very tight.”</p><p>As he spoke, his dull red mantle was moving slightly with the wind and seemed to possess vitality of its own.</p><p>To the left of Constantine, a mummy completely wrapped in bandages, who only revealed a huge beard, answered calmly, “We will have assistance.”</p><p>Constantine sipped on the wine and asked concerned, “Would it be too obvious for the dissenters of the Pharaoh and the leaders of Brotherhood to die one after another?”</p><p>“There are also people, who appeared to be loyal to Pharaoh, among the people who died.” The mummy replied with a “you don’t have to worry about this” look.</p><p>“Alright. Just make sure I get to drink the blood of Sathah.” Constantine laughed nonchalantly.</p><p>The mummy waited for assistance to arrive. At the meantime, he commented, “Information from the war-torn zone reported that Peng, a Heavenly son of the era from China, had become a “Demigod”.”</p><p>“That’s fast…” Constantine was initially shocked but soon was immersed in his thoughts. He smiled faintly and said, “A “Terror Grade” Heavenly son of the era… His blood must be very delicious and worth the attempt.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
