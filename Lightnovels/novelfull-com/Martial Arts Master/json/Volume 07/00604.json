If they were to all squeeze onto a jeep, it might be a little troublesome.</p><p>“Nope…” Ma Chaoyang wiped his eyes and shook his head.</p><p>He was a typical backpacker and preferred to hitch a ride.</p><p>“The car we rented is still at the hotel. It’s chaotic at that place… Really chaotic…..” Zhou Yingxin explained warily.</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, the lady, Zhou Xuanying, pointed to a place far away and exclaimed excitedly, “There’s a car there that we can use. The key is on the floor! On the floor!”</p><p>She was talking about the maroon red car. Its owner had been killed by the rebels previously.</p><p>Lou Cheng looked over and saw the corpse and the car door that was opened. Instantly, he understood what had happened. Without a further word, he turned and asked, “Who knows how to drive a car?”</p><p>“I know.” Zhou Yong swallowed his saliva, raised his hand and answered.</p><p>“Me too.” Ma Chaoyang drove occasionally for his trip.</p><p>Lou Cheng nodded his head. While he was thinking of rotating the driver for the maroon red car, he suddenly had a different thought.</p><p>He pondered for a few seconds before turning to Yan Zheke and said, “Ke, let’s change our car. That jeep is for military use and will attract too much attention. It will be easily spotted by drones or others. Moreover, if you have to maintain your supernatural ability, you will get tired. We don’t know what will happen next, and it would be better if we can reserve any additional amount of strength.”</p><p>They spoke in front of the others so they could quickly communicate the situation and not lead the assumption that they were safe now. Otherwise, they might do something stupid or make an error that jeopardized the safety of others.</p><p>“Yeah, that’s how I feel too.” Yan Zheke looked up and said, “Everyone, let’s squeeze into a car. A single car will be more agile and we won’t have to wait or waste time.”</p><p>“Alright.” Lou Cheng nodded his head in approval and ordered Ma Chaoyang and the rest to board the car first. He returned to the vicinity of the jeep and hit the military officer, who almost wet his own pants, with a palm strike.</p><p>This seemingly cold-looking guy had long collapsed under the incessant invasion of the mind through the Army Formula and Lou Cheng’s personal aura. He had also revealed everything he knew to Lou Cheng.</p><p>He was part of the government army that was stationed in this place. There wasn’t a mutiny. He had received an order from his superior to lead his team to gather and capture foreign tourists in the hotel.</p><p>With regard to this mission, the instruction he received was that there was no need to be concerned about international impact. If he had to open fire or kill, he could just do so!</p><p>Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke could smell something fishy. Changing cars had naturally become a logical choice. No matter how Nile ended up, it was more important for them to leave successfully.</p><p>After settling his things, Lou Cheng walked to the side of the car and watched Zhou Yong, Ma Chaoyang, Li Xiaoyun and Zhou Xuanying smartly squeeze into the back seats. They had not recovered from the shock and previous ordeals they suffered. They had become docile like quails and were very obedient at the moment.</p><p>The little girl sat on her mother’s lap to the left of the car. Zhou Yong was in the middle while Ma Chaoyang was at the right. Yan Zheke had already gotten the keys and successfully started the engine. Lou Cheng looked around and picked up two cartridges before returning to the seat beside the driver.</p><p>He placed his bag beside his leg. After looking at the map in her phone, Yan Zheke said, “If we head out from here, we can travel North through public road 76. It connects directly to KhuKhang and is the shortest and best route for evacuation out of this place. However, I fear that there would be too many people taking this route, attracting large units to intercept and rob them.”</p><p>“I feel that we should make a detour and take public route 63 towards the East. After leaving the city, we will run into road 92 before turning into road 76 at Pori. It’s pretty far from Tetans City and there shouldn’t be any problem. If we receive unpleasant news or information during the way, we can still easily reach to road 71 from road 92 and head towards the port city Fartouat near the seas.”</p><p>When she was driving here, she had already started thinking about the evacuation route.</p><p>Lou Cheng thought for a while before raising his thumb up and said, “That’s great! Let’s do it!”</p><p>Yan Zheke, who received the compliments, felt even more confident. She got calmer and smoothly drove the car out. She sped smoothly on a segment of the road without many road lamps. There were tall and short buildings along the way. From time to time, gunshots fires raged in the distance. It made them all appreciate peace and being able to live on.</p><p>There weren’t many cars on public road 63. Yan Zheke, who had always found it hard to control her speed, could finally showcase her strengths. There were like a bolt of maroon red lightning.</p><p>Lou Cheng took a glance in the rearview mirror and saw several cars chasing behind them. These were some of the foreign tourists they met at the hotel. Considering the dangers they were under and the fact that their embassies and consulates couldn’t reach them, they had chosen to move with the strong.</p><p>In chaotic times, this was the innate behavior of living things!</p><p>“We could almost form a fleet of cars…” Yan Zheke also took a glance at the mirror and sighed.</p><p>“There’s probably no other way out. I couldn’t possibly shoot an Emperor Yan Force shot at them and demand them to not follow us, right?” sighed Lou Cheng as he played with the cartridges of bullets he’d picked up previously.</p><p>He still couldn’t be that cold, ruthless and be dead to how others felt.</p><p>“It’s alright. It’s only a three-hour car ride to KhuKhang. It’s a big city and there would be aid from other countries.” Yan Zheke looked straight at the road and said calmly.</p><p>Just as she was about to get out of Tetans, she suddenly noticed obstacles in front. There was a group of soldiers that had set a checkpoint ahead.</p><p>“What should I do?” Yan Zheke instinctively asked. Li Xiaoyun and the rest, who were sitting at the back, instantly tensed their body.</p><p>Lou Cheng remained composed as usual and said, “Lower the windows, don’t stop and charge through it!”</p><p>“Alright!” Yan Zheke lowered the windows of both sides before stepping fully on the accelerator. The car roared loudly.</p><p>Vroom! The car shot out like an arrow leaving the bow and approached the checkpoint at high speed.</p><p>That group of soldiers initially panicked and quickly raised their rifles.</p><p>Lou Cheng extended his right arm out of the window, rubbed his index finger with his middle finger and a yellow bullet shot out instantly. It was as fast as a bullet shooting out from a barrel, leaving behind a blinding fire trail.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The bullet shell pierced through the forehead of a soldier as the head exploded. It was as though he was hit by artillery fire as countless bone pieces exploded outwards, hitting the surrounding soldiers. They all wailed in pain and scampered away, showing that they were disorganized rebels that had not undergone regular training.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The car smashed through the barrier and was about to fly past it. A military officer controlled his emotions, grabbed onto the opportunity and was about to shoot at the driver seat.</p><p>Lou Cheng swung his left wrist casually and the other bullet flew out. However, it was even faster than before.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The body of that military officer was engulfed by flames as his body parts scattered.</p><p>The maroon car charged through the checkpoint and drove into the public road covered by sand. Following behind them was car after car.</p><p>…</p><p>The unit that had lost their officer returned to their stationed base in a sorry state and were met with the superior of the superior of their superior, Brigadier General Fario!</p><p>This young man who had ocean-blue like eyes and a face with a mature beard led his guards. He had his hands behind him and were inspecting this group of failed soldiers.</p><p>“Reporting Sir, the whole incident was like this.” The second officer-in-charge of the failed team had completed his report.</p><p>Fario nodded his head slightly and took a few strides without showing his intention before turning his body and walking towards the helicopter.</p><p>Halfway to his helicopter, he nonchalantly instructed his guards, “They murdered our international allies and seriously infringed on the rules of war. They trampled humans rights and all of them will be executed!”</p><p>“Yes, Sir!” The captain of the guards saluted.</p><p>“No!””Please spare our lives!”</p><p>That group of injured soldiers finally understood. Screams and wails sounded under the continuous fire of the machine gun.</p><p>Fario boarded the helicopter smartly, clenched his fist lightly and said, “Ask Tumu to fly towards public road 71. We will head to Pori and eradicate that accident completely!”</p><p>“Yes Sir!” The captain of the guards replied loudly.</p><p>…</p><p>The skies gradually got brighter as the maroon red car soared through the roads. The outline of the city ahead could vaguely be seen.</p><p>“We are almost there!” Li Xiaoyun exclaimed happily.</p><p>Once we are there, we will be away from the city of Tetans!</p><p>“Just a few more minutes.” Ma Chaoyang wriggled his neck a little. After realising his phone had some signal, he quickly refreshed for the news.</p><p>“…The situation at Deeka has gotten out of control. The rebels are robbing everything and the government army has joined the ranks of robbers. Many tourists have been killed. Eh, there’s a new superhero.” Ma Chaoyang read out the situation reported in the evening news.</p><p>“Superhero?” Lou Cheng asked with doubts.</p><p>Isn’t that unique to America?</p><p>Ma Chaoyang explained, “Possibly because American tourists were killed, an expert travelling in Nile decided to take action. Using his skills, he executed his revenge on the government army and the rebels and has killed a general from each side. They are the real generals, Kafir and Mutao! He called himself the ‘Dark Night Bat’!”</p><p>General? A real general? Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke exchanged gazes and were clearly shocked and surprised.</p><p>Excluding those who rose through the military ranks, a General was synonymous with Danger grade or physical invulnerability in Nile. From the tone of Ma Chaoyang, he was clearly referring to the latter.</p><p>Two physical invulnerability experts had fallen?</p><p>In the span of only a night, a mutiny had resulted in the fall of two physical invulnerability experts?</p><p>In a one vs one matchup between physical invulnerability stage experts, winning was easy but killing the each other was difficult. Was that “Dark Night Bat” a superhero in the level of the forbidden area? Or could it be that there was more than one of him?</p><p>Moreover, why would the two sides of the mutiny implicate the foreigners for no good reasons and drawing retributions? Had the situation spiralled out of control to this extent? Had the military discipline of the army completely disintegrated?</p><p>The development of this matter had gotten stranger and more and more exaggerated…</p><p>They needed to evacuate as soon as possible!</p><p>Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke understood each others’ weaknesses from their gazes. One of them increased the speed of the car while the other started observing the surrounding area.</p><p>Vroom vroom vroom! The family car started running faster and flew into the small town. There was a military checkpoint ahead and a helicopter hovering around.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s eyelid twitched and his intuition told him that something troublesome was going to happen.</p><p>“Turn around. No. Wait a little longer.” He calmly said.</p><p>After several seconds, a SUV charged through the checkpoint using its heavier car weight amidst the tattering of the gunshots.</p><p>Suddenly, a rocket missile shot out from mid-air and struck the SUV.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The subsequent cars had all stopped in fear of the vigorous explosion. Flames raged up and formed a shape similar to a mushroom.</p><p>On the helicopter, Fario was holding on to a cigar and watching the scene unfolded casually as he straightened his military uniform.</p><p>Car after car turned around frantically. Yan Zheke quickly followed and blended in quickly without drawing attention to themselves.</p><p>At this moment, another trail of fire shot out from the helicopter and landed behind them. Loud explosions and thick flames and smoke rose once again.</p><p>“Everyone stop your car and accept inspection.” The military officer guarding the checkpoint used a loudspeaker and shouted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
