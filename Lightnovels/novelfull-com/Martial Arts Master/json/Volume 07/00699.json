He listened silently as Coach Lu continued to describe,</p><p>“Li Pingao has the supernatural ability to turn himself to metal. Guanwai League also has similar Physical Invulnerability martial arts. Therefore, he has taken this path rather than the skills of the Dark Sect. His speed, power, agility, endurance and recovery ability are outstanding. His fighting style is a little more rough, open, and dependent on the strength of his body. The nickname ‘Golden-Haired Hou’ isn’t just for show.”</p><p>Why do I feel like you’re scolding me… Lou Cheng lifted his hands and covered half of his face.</p><p>“Since reaching the Physical Invulnerability stage, Li Pingao has disappointed the older generations in the Guangwai League. He has also become quieter and speaks little,” added Ning Zitong. “His condition reminded me of a saying. One either blossoms in silence or perishes in it. You can’t take this too lightly.”</p><p>She suddenly sighed, “When the professional league was first established, the Guanwai League was a superpower that ranked in the top three. Every single Physical Invulnerability expert of the older generation was someone with great influence and power. What a shame. After ten years, they’re all either too old by now, or too young to pose a threat. Other than Lu Yongyuan, they don’t have any significant figures and have been lingering around the bottom few. If they’re careless, they might very well be ‘relegated’!”</p><p>For a top tier power, Li Pingao, who has achieved Physical Invulnerability, can still be considered a disappointment. Indeed, how high one’s achievements are is always relative… Lou Cheng was shocked, but glad that he had a clear goal in mind.</p><p>Lu Yan took a look at Ning Zitong, who interrupted his thoughts. He lifted his fist to his mouth and coughed twice,</p><p>“The Guanwai League has another second-pin, Zhu Xiaoyun. She’s talented with illusions and once relied on her strong supernatural abilities to defeat an Inhuman when she was just at the sixth-pin level. Though she got famous because of illusion, she also fell behind because of it. She took a total of five years before achieving complete mastery. She devoted her outstanding bloodline into her own martial path and eventually made the great leap when she was twenty-eight.”</p><p>“She has great potential and is still under thirty now. Yet, she has already advanced to the second-pin level. But it will be hard for her to advance even further.”</p><p>Illusion Sect’s unique skills had been mostly lost for a long time. Guanwai League had only managed to recover a small portion of them. Although there was similar content within the Dark Sect, it was still just in certain aspects. Zhu Xiaoyun would either be stuck at this level for a long time, or she could be like Lu Yongyuan who integrated his entire lifetime of learnings, power of his bloodline, and various experiences together. This had allowed him to find his own path and create new martial arts. If she could achieve this, the sky would be her limit, and she would have the qualifications to fight for titles.</p><p>After introducing the rough situation of Zhu Xiaoyun, Lu Yan didn’t have the chance to catch his breath when Ning Zitong continued,</p><p>“Xiaoyun, that brat, has maintained a very good attitude and isn’t easily flustered. She likes to research cooking, gossip, and collect embarrassing things others have done. She’s living a great life and I strongly believe that she’ll be able to come out with something new. She sees Lu Yongyuan as half her master. Perhaps she will also be another Lu Yongyuan.”</p><p>After hearing Ning Zitong mention the hobbies of Zhu Xiaoyun, Lu Yan’s face darkened. He looked to Lou Cheng as his tone turned serious,</p><p>“Her illusions have reached the stage where she can fool others with the fakes. It happens to be a complete counter to for Enemy Heart Freezing Move. However, you have the supernatural ability to sense danger. If you face her, your chances of winning are high.”</p><p>“Mm.” Lou Cheng nodded his head seriously, but in his mind, he was wondering what kind of embarrassing things Zhu Xiaoyun had on Lu Yan.</p><p>Seeing that Lou Cheng had a good attitude, Lu Yan nodded his head in approval and said,</p><p>“The two of them together with Lu Yongyuan were the main members of Guanwai League last year. Third-pin Zheng Shiduo is their reserve. If they have more than two people injured, the older generation experts might take part or choose a disciple who’s close to the Physical Invulnerability level, to give them experience in a true battle.”</p><p>“However, they’ve added Tang Zexun from Japan this year. They shouldn’t be facing such a desperate situation again.”</p><p>“Zheng Shiduo, twenty-nine years old, Physical Invulnerability for two years. He claims he is 1.96 meters tall but seems to be still growing. He specializes in unique techniques of the Dark Sect and often acts rashly. If there aren’t any surprises, he should still be a reserve tomorrow.”</p><p>“Tang Zexun just made the great leap a few months ago. Currently, there are no records of her at this level. Her actual strength and level are unknown. She might appear as a surprise member tomorrow.”</p><p>…</p><p>After analyzing each member of the opposing team, Lu Yan said in a serious tone,</p><p>“Empress Luo’s style gives her an obvious advantage when she faces an opponent weaker than her. We can’t let her face Lu Yongyuan directly. Lou Cheng, you will be the first to go. No matter if it is Li Pingao or Tang Zexun, you have to win. Such a small request, I’m sure you can do it, right? After which, try your best to exhaust the second opponent. If Lu Yongyuan chooses to go first, things will be simpler.”</p><p>“Guo Jie, you’ll be the second to go…”</p><p>Before Lu Yan could complete his sentence, Martial Arts Fanatic, Guo Jie, blurted in surprise, “Me?”</p><p>Shouldn’t we play it safer in the opening round?</p><p>As the first-pin expert and our coach, our chances of winning will be higher if you participate!</p><p>“Not confident? You don’t wish to fight?” Lu Yan didn’t answer her but instead asked her further questions with a serious expression.</p><p>“I want to!” Guo Jie didn’t hesitate and answered decisively. She was clearly energized exhilarated.</p><p>“Great. No matter who you face, he will have been fighting for a long time. There’s only one goal for you and that’s a victory.” Lu Yan turned around and looked at Ning Zitong. “When Guo Jie exhausts the third member of Guanwai League, you will be responsible for finishing things off. By then, no matter if the opponent is Lu Yongyuan or someone else, they shouldn’t be a problem for you.”</p><p>Ning Zitong answered with a faint smile and continued with her deductions on the most possible lineup by the Guanwai League. When Lou Cheng and Guo Jie left, she frowned slightly. She looked at Lu Yan and asked,</p><p>“Why did you make her participate all of a sudden?”</p><p>“She already has the strength of a second-pin and is no longer a little brat that has just come out,” answered Lu Yan. “It’s about time to give her some pressure. What kind of pressure would there be if she only participates in matches she is bound to win or if she fights with people she’s familiar with? This type of important event when she might very well lose will be a good experience for her. Otherwise, would you be willing to let her imitate the Dragon King and send her to the war-torn areas where even Physical Invulnerability experts die?”</p><p>“We aren’t young anymore. We have to look further and give them the opportunity to replace us.”</p><p>Ning Zitong listened quietly. After some time, she finally puffed her cheeks like a little girl and sighed,</p><p>“You are always more rational than me.”</p><p>…</p><p>The next morning, the skies were clear and the spring wind was warm, making one feel comfortable.</p><p>Lu Yongyuan repeated the most basic split, slice, cut, slash, shake, and various other moves over ten times. While doing so, he was focused and devoted, just like the times when he had just learned how to use a saber.</p><p>If an expert walked past, they would be surprised that the most basic moves had no flaws at all in his hands. Each action was exactly the same. No matter the angles or the signs, they seemed to be replicated.</p><p>When Lu Yongyuan began fully practicing his saber techniques, layers of lights stacked up like a growing snowball. It was eye-opening.</p><p>Although it was the same moves at the same place using the same saber, there were minute differences. It was as though he was changing according to the time and variations in the environment, as he never seemed to repeat himself.</p><p>Without permission,Tang Zexun didn’t dare to watch the God-Slaying Saber practice. However, as she continued practicing her sword technique, she suddenly felt that the surroundings had dimmed.</p><p>As there was a competition today, the Physical Invulnerability experts in the Guanwai League didn’t practice for too long. They were mainly doing fine-tuning and consolidation. Around lunchtime, they boarded a luxurious bus and headed towards the Chixia mountain in the suburbs.</p><p>Along the way, Lu Yongyuan’s eyes were shut and he leaned back as he took a small break. As they were about to reach their destination, he suddenly opened his eyes and said to Tang Zexun,</p><p>“Your foundation is solid, and you have great mastery over the sword techniques of the Xinzhai Sect. Even better, you aren’t known by the outsiders. You are a perfect surprise for Longhu.”</p><p>After the translator conveyed the message, Tang Zexun stared at him and said,</p><p>“Senior, you want me to participate?”</p><p>At this moment, Li Pingao, Zhu Xiaoyun, and Zheng Shiduo all looked over.</p><p>“Yes, to surprise them.” Lu Yongyuan answered calmly. “You will fight in the opening match.”</p><p>“Al…alright!” Tang Zexun was shocked but nodded her head with force.</p><p>Lu Yongyuan didn’t continue. He looked forward and said,</p><p>“I’ll be the second to take over from the front, clear the obstacles, and pave the path for the rest. It will be best if I can encounter Empress Luo when I’m in peak condition. If that’s not possible, she’ll find it hard to maintain, too. Xiaoyun, use your illusions to wear her out. You will have your chance.”</p><p>“Yes.” Zhu Xiaoyun had a low voice that sounded a little like a man.</p><p>She was of average build and had a brown skin tone. Her facial features were exquisite, with a pair of neat and beautiful eyebrows.</p><p>Zheng Shiduo had no opinions regarding this arrangement. As for Li Pingao, whose skin felt a little like metal, he became even quieter.</p><p>The vehicle circled up the mountain and finally arrived at the carpark. Following the corridor, Tang Zexun and the group instantly felt the dry heat of the atmospheric air. Soon, they saw a red arena in the middle of the place.</p><p>Longhu Club, Infernal Hell!</p><p>The audience was arriving one after another and entering the room made of glass located at the end of the long corridor.</p><p>So this is what the confrontation of the most elite powers in China looks like… Tang Zexun took a breath silently and smelled something burning. Her hands, which were carrying Fugumaru, started to shiver with anxiety.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
