After watching Lou Cheng overtake Ann Chaoyang, experiencing Songcheng University’s victory over Huahai, and being teased by her boyfriend, she longed to get intimate with Cheng.</p><p>However, Lou Cheng’s response was way beyond her expectations. He casually took over the keycard, hugged her tight, and carried her into the room. She felt high above the clouds, dizzy, and moony until Lou Cheng’s last wave of passion settled. She saw faint lights shining through the window and sensed the softness of the bed and the heat from the naked body lying next to her.</p><p>Phew… She was still panting, recalling what had just happened. Bashful and shy, she kicked Lou Cheng’s calf gently and complained like a spoiled child,</p><p>“I thought you said kiss.”</p><p>Stroking her silky back with his right hand, Lou Cheng answered with a grin,</p><p>“Yeah, I was kissing. Yeah.”</p><p>He was proud like a cat after its secret intimacy.</p><p>A scene flashed back in her head where Lou Cheng buried his face in her chest and her hands unconsciously rubbed and grabbed his hair.</p><p>Hit by a rash of embarrassment, her face was hot, shoulders shaking, and fist reaching out to his chest.</p><p>Bam! In the sound of wind, she suddenly remembered she was no longer a weak girl. A capable Professional Ninth Pin fighter like her she could smash a rock with one punch. She quickly scattered her concentrated force and touched Lou Cheng gently.</p><p>“Don’t worry. I concentrated my force to dissolve your strike,” said Lou Cheng with a loving smile.</p><p>Yan Zheke rolled her eyes at him, but her scold was replaced by some laughter.</p><p>“What is so funny?” asked Lou Cheng, confused, as he tightened his hug.</p><p>Yan Zheke pursed her lips, moved her eyes about, and answered in a glamorous manner, “I suddenly remembered an awkward incident with my cousin.”</p><p>“Ji Lingxi?” Asked Lou Cheng out of curiosity.</p><p>“Yeah. My grandfather’s family trait is reserved and prudent. My cousin didn’t date any boys until her freshman year in university. Of Professional Ninth Pin, she was gifted with some odd might by birth.” Yan Zheke had joy in her eyes. “Her first kiss happened in a pavilion in the university. She was sitting on a stone bench and he was kissing her from a commanding position. She was so excited and confused that she couldn’t control herself. He right hand grabbed the stone bench so tight and broke it into two… ”</p><p>“Ha! What next?” Lou Cheng was amused just imagining the scene.</p><p>“Next? He turned pale with fear and broke up with her on QQ after a few days. My cousin was so lost… Ha-hah.” Yan Zheke laughed so much that she couldn’t continue. After a dozen seconds, she began to compliment herself. “Fortunately, I have the idea of self-control deep in my head. It has become part of my instinct.”</p><p>Lou Cheng put on a doubtful look on purpose.</p><p>“Really? Look around first.”</p><p>Yan Zheke looked around, puzzled. She noticed how messy the bed was with sheets and duvet piled up in the middle.</p><p>She suddenly remembered another fascinating moment when she bit her lip hard, pulled the sheet in with both hands, and kicked Lou Cheng every now and then in hopes of making him stop, but he lay tight on her.</p><p>If only they didn’t have a last bit of rationality left in them in the end, they would have already moved to the next level…</p><p>Sigh… When love and feelings thickened to a point, it would be really hard to keep things under control…</p><p>As the scenes flashed back, Yan Zheke’s face turned very red, hiding her eyes from Lou Cheng and pinching him here and there. She bent over, reaching to her underwear hanging on her ankle with her right hand.</p><p>“It’s your fault! Your fault!” She gave Lou Cheng three punches with some strength but not very powerful.</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled, satisfied and pleased, recalling the thrill and excitement they had earlier.</p><p><em>“That’s my little fairy!”</em> Liu Cheng thought to himself with a smile.</p><p>“You… How could you… ” Yan Zheke moved her body slightly away from him, scared a little bit.</p><p>“Didn’t Tong say every man has some non-responsive period?”</p><p>“Cough… Because you are so attractive and I’m completely drawn by you.” Lou Cheng had become an extremely sweet talker.</p><p>Yan Zheke stared at Lou Cheng with mixed feelings of joy and annoyance. She remembered how they changed a new position so it wouldn’t spill on her body and felt the soreness in her legs. She kicked Lou Cheng. “Bring my nightie over! I need a shower.”</p><p>“I’m so sticky everywhere.”</p><p>Lou Cheng nodded happily and went nakedly to take her pajamas from the couch.</p><p>Yan Zheke took a quick glance at him and then immediately closed her eyes and buried her face between pillows.</p><p>She put on her pajamas under the duvet before getting out of bed and going to the bathroom. She suddenly stopped, afraid of turning her head around. “You… You make the bed… ”</p><p>“Yes, Coach Yan!” answered Lou Cheng with a sneer.</p><p>Yan Zheke had her eyes closed, relaxed under the hot water, thinking back to what had happened just now. She was still a bit panicked as it went so fast. But she liked being so intimate with Cheng.</p><p>She asked herself if she was ready for this and if she was sure about this relationship. She was very positive that she wanted to give herself completely to him.</p><p>However, she held fears for that thing that she had not yet experienced. She was afraid that things which came too easy were not to be cherished. She felt scared that the passion between them would fade and the feelings they had for each other would change once they moved to the next stage. She feared for all the unknown.</p><p>She trusted Cheng, but she couldn’t put away those fears that were pulling her from moving forward.</p><p><em>“All girls are swayed by considerations of gain and loss, aren’t they?</em> ”</p><p>After the shower, she stepped out and dried her hair with a towel. She looked into a distance and said to Lou Cheng bashfully,</p><p>“It’s your turn.”</p><p>“Yeah. I’ll blow dry your hair after my shower.” Lou Cheng’s heart was extremely tender.</p><p>“It’s almost 11:30. Are you not doing your morning exercises tomorrow?” Yan Zheke turned with a puzzled look.</p><p>“I’ll do them. I’ve spent quite some time here. A little bit longer won’t be a problem. Lacking sleep for a day is no big deal.” Lou Cheng smiled brightly. “I know what is more important. Heheh.”</p><p>“You know nothing. Go and take a shower!” Yan Zheke rolled her eyes. The dimples in her cheeks were so obvious.</p><p>Lou Cheng came out of the bathroom with a hair drier and plugged it in. Yan Zheke sat next to him. He carefully blew her long hair.</p><p>Yan Zheke sat elegantly, her eyes half closed, enjoying this moment of gentleness and tenderness.</p><p>Lou Chen saw a piece of cloth on the bed from the corner of his eye and asked without thinking,</p><p>“Are you not wearing your bra?”</p><p>Yan Zheke puffed out her cheeks and answered casually,</p><p>“It’s not comfortable to sleep with it.”</p><p>“You used to sleep with it.” Lou Cheng was actually confused.</p><p>“I didn’t really know you before.” Yan Zheke chuckled.</p><p>“You didn’t know me? We were sharing a bed… ” Lou Cheng felt amused. “Do you know me well enough now?”</p><p>“Not really, but I have abandoned myself,” answered Yan Zheke. “I don’t know any girl who likes to sleep with her bra on.”</p><p>Lou Cheng nodded. “I think I have just gained some new knowledge.”</p><p>“Of course. I’m your Coach Yan!” Yan Zheke rolled her eyes and transformed into a curious kid. “Cheng, I have a question to ask you. Are all guys different when they are doing that? Like a pervert? You usually are calm and gentlemanly. How could you talk like a pervert?”</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed and cleared his throat. “That’s pretty normal. Should I keep my face straight in bed? Should I chant political slogans while kissing you?”</p><p>“Stop it… Don’t make me laugh.” Yan Zheke hammered the bed with her hands.</p><p>It was after midnight when they finished with her hair. Lou Cheng fell asleep with the soft and tender Yan Zheke and got up at 5:30 without waking her up.</p><p>Lou Cheng planted a gentle kiss on her lips after carefully putting on his clothes and washing his face. He walked out of the room, his heart soft and warm.</p><p>The sun came out very early in the capital. Red clouds were already vaguely visible in the sky.</p><p>…</p><p>Two days later, the group stage of the tournament ended and the committee held the quarter-finals drawing ceremony. Lou Cheng and his team members were all invited to the arena as guests.</p><p>Except for some ups and downs in Group D, other groups had nothing surprising. Seeds Shanbei, Capital, and Guangnan, along with second grade teams Guoyang, Jinfeng, and Jiuqu had advanced to the next stage.</p><p>According to the rules, the quarter-finals would be held in two halves and the winners of the two halves would confront each other in the final match. In other words, the four teams in the first places of their groups would be separated into two divisions and the two of them would meet each other in the semi-finals unless something went wrong.</p><p>After a brief speech and some introduction, Fang Jinyu drew the first team from the four group leaders.</p><p>“Songcheng University Martial Arts Club!”</p><p>Err… Unconsciously, Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke changed their sitting positions, looking forward to finding out their next rival and guessing their potential enemy in the semi-finals.</p><p>“Jinfeng University Martial Arts Club.” Fang Jinyu pulled out Songcheng University’s rival for the quarter-finals from the three second-position teams other than Huahai.</p><p><em>“It won’t make much a difference.”</em> Lou Cheng didn’t really care. He kept his eyes on the second guest who was about to draw the other group leader for the top half.</p><p>After a moment of waiting, the guest pulled out a ball and showed it to the audience with a smile.</p><p>“Capital College Martial Arts Club!”</p><p><em>Phew. I knew we wouldn’t have the fortune to have Guangnan…</em> Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke exchanged a glance, not really disappointed but full of the will to fight.</p><p><em>We are going to challenge Ren Li and her teammates.</em></p><p>The top half was settled and the first team for the bottom half would be:</p><p>“Shanbei University Martial Arts Club!”</p><p>And Shanbei’s rival would be:</p><p>“Huahai University Martial Arts Club!”</p><p>Ann Chaoyang leaned back on his chair upon hearing the announcement, half high-spirited and half relieved.</p><p>“Well, this can be good.”</p><p><em>Yeah, it’s not bad to have the opportunity to fight with the old rival again without being distracted by the one who threw me down from the throne.</em></p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
