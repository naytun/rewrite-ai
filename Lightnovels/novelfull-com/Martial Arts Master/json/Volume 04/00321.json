She might even flail and accidentally hurl her phone away. Who knew this development of this match would be so unbelievable and she was transfixed even now.</p><p>There was no cheering nor excitement. She immediately closed the camera app and uploaded the video to the forum, with a title that best expressed her current feeling.</p><p>“I might have seen a ghost!”</p><p>User Unparalleled Dragon King watched the less-than-a-minute video and sent an emoji scratching the back of its head. He replied, “F*ck, what was Mu Yu doing? Lou Cheng won just like that?”</p><p>“Is it because of the boomerang effect of Mu Yu’s supernatural ability?” User Road to the Arena somehow noticed this post and left a comment.</p><p>“Hahaha! I see. That’s hilarious. I laughed so much my stomach is hurting!” User Nie Qiqi sent a laughing emoji.</p><p>“I watched it twice and laughed each time! How is this a martials art match? This is obviously a comedy sketch!” User Okamoto’s Fan replied with a cry-laughing emoji.</p><p>“Hands up! Didn’t you say that the boomerang effect only affects others?” User Brahman sent a cry-laughing emoji along with a dumbfounded emoji.</p><p>Unparalleled Dragon King commented with a belly-laughing emoji and added, “Lou Cheng is the Heavenly Son with great luck! However, Mu Yu used his supernatural ability on Lin Que and Lou Cheng in succession, so it’s natural for him to experience the boomerang effect. It totally makes sense. It’s the exact reason!”</p><p>Brahman sent a big laughing emoji and said, “So that’s it… Then I can laugh with ease!”</p><p>“But he isn’t affected when he fought Peng Leyun last year… ” User Wonton Seller, a senior student in high school, had been waiting to watch this specific video at break time.</p><p>“There’s no problem. Last year, Mu Yu used the Misfortune at first to fight with the Corvine Mouth of Xu Wannian like Kilkenny cats, so he barely won the match. As a result, he was too weak to use his supernatural ability by the time he fought Peng Leyun.” Unparalleled Dragon King was a human database and was well-versed with that match. “Of course, Lou Cheng may be talented in resisting this kind of supernatural ability.”</p><p>“Oh! I see, @Eternal Nightfall. Can I upload this video to Weibo? It’s so funny that I want more people to see it!” User All Good Names Are Taken By Dogs sent an emoji that rolled about.</p><p>“Of course!” Yan Xiaoling began to smile, gradually recovering from shock.</p><p>All Good Names Are Taken By Dogs immediately posted the video on Weibo with the caption:</p><p>“An unbelievable match! Lou Cheng who wins without moving vs. a self-defeating Mu Yu!”</p><p>In the end, she tagged a few of her good friends on Weibo.</p><p>One of her female friends with the username Dumm Dong sent a cry-laughing emoji and said,</p><p>“Haha, what a professional show! There’s not a single flaw! He’s really using his whole life to perform! @Oscar Best Actor”.</p><p>…</p><p>In the martial arts arena of Shanbei University, Fang Zhirong had completely suppressed his opponent.</p><p>Xu Wannian and Peng Leyun sat side by side, showing no interest in this boring match with an obvious outcome. They even doubted if they would have the chance to fight because their opponents were so weak.</p><p>If he was not manager of the martial arts club and had to take care of his image in front of his classmates, he even wanted to take out his phone to search for Lou Cheng and Mu Yu’s match.</p><p>Did his Taste of the Stars really restrained Mu Yu’s supernatural ability?</p><p>In November last year, he suffered the boomerang effect when he used Corvine Mouth to make fun of Mu Yu. But one example cannot prove anything.</p><p>While he was lost in thought, someone handed him a phone.</p><p>“Brother Peng, what’s wrong?” He looked at Peng Leyun beside him.</p><p>The corner of Peng Leyun’s mouth upturned and he implicitly answered, “Just take a look.”</p><p>He was actually an easy-going man when not in a daze.</p><p>“Look?” Xu Wannian looked down to see Lou Cheng’s fan forum open on the screen. It was a video of the match between Lou Cheng and Mu Yu. He suddenly could not help holding his breath and reaching out to click the play button.</p><p>F*ck… F*ck…! Xu Wannian’s expression shifted several times as he watched the video. When the less-than-a-minute video was done, he just sat there and lost in thought. In the end, the referee’s voice announcing Fang Zhirong’s victory shook him out of his reverie.</p><p>“Brother Peng, i-if I met Lou Cheng… ” He suddenly turned around and looked at Peng Leyun with a tearful face. “Can I just give up?”</p><p>Peng Leyun chuckled. “What do you think?”</p><p>Xu Wannian inhaled a deep breath. “I’m afraid I can’t control my mouth! How about you guys tape my mouth shut?”</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the arena, Mu Yu finally began to accept reality. He was neither frustrated nor pained about his failure. There was only confusion and bewilderment.</p><p>He carefully stood up and looked up and down Lou Cheng several times. He walked slowly towards the home team seats out of fear that the ground he stepped on would suddenly collapse and create a deep pit for him.</p><p>“Leader, what’s going on?” Watching him coming over, Lin Xiaozhi cautiously stood up and welcomed him back.</p><p>Mu Yu thought for a while and answered, “The boomerang effect of my supernatural ability.”</p><p>This was a fact. But what he was not sure what was the reason for it.</p><p>“How is it possible?” Lin Xiaozhi frowned, but suddenly nodded in understanding. “I get it. It’s because Lou Cheng is blessed by god, so neither curse nor misfortune work on him. Having lost its target, your ability will fail and cause the boomerang effect!”</p><p>“What kind of theory are you talking about?” Mu Yu blurted out in surprise.</p><p>Lin Xiaozhi answered him seriously, “Metaphysical theory!”</p><p>Mu Yu was momentarily stunned before explaining his own suspicion. “I suspect Lou Cheng has a third supernatural ability, an ability that can restrain or even rebound curse and misfortune-related supernatural abilities.”</p><p>“It’s possible… ” Jin Dali came to stand beside Lin Xiaozhi.</p><p>After seeing all his team members, Mu Yu finally removed himself from his bewilderment and confusion. Sorrowfully, he expressed his apology to them.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry that I can’t lead you to advance to the National Finals this year.”</p><p>The students who dared to join their Martial Arts Club really had true love for them!</p><p>The atmosphere abruptly became sad and solemn. Lin Xiaozhi was about to cry, but she took a breath and put on a hopeful and relaxed act. “Leader, even if we didn’t make it this year, we still have next, next year! What’s there to worry about? We still have a chance!”</p><p>“Why not the next year?” Jin Dali asked in confusion.</p><p>“Isn’t it obvious? Peng Leyun will be in his final year next year, while Lou Cheng and Lin Que will have another year’s worth of growth. Shanbei and Songcheng University will be invincible. How could we have a chance to go to the finals? If we wait for next, next year, Peng Leyun would have graduated. We could still get the other advancing position, even if Lou Cheng and Lin Que become more powerful by then.” Lin Xiaozhi was initially trying to cook up some reasons, but she got more emotional as she continued.</p><p>They also wanted to participate in the National Finals for once.</p><p>They needed something to pursue in their four-year university life!</p><p>“But I’m in my third year now. I’ll have graduated by then… ” Mu Yu interrupted her in a daze.</p><p>Lin Xiaozhi glanced at him and laughed. “Leader, you can’t abandon us! Without your ability, how can we advance to the National Finals? Why don’t you apply to defer your graduation? You’ve failed several classes anyway. You might not even have enough credits to graduate.”</p><p>Shannan University, like other top universities, used the credit system. One to four credits for a course. With enough credits for undergraduate classes, students are allowed to graduate on time or earlier. If the credits were not enough, one could apply to delay graduation by one to two years.</p><p>Speaking of this, Lin Xiaozhi suddenly became irritated. She usually got good grades, but her leader has used his ability on her twice, worsening her luck.</p><p>As she was reanimating the atmosphere, the audience sitting in the stands of the arena began to cheer. Their sound grew louder and stronger, finally turning into unified chants for the host team.</p><p>“Stand together through storm and stress!”</p><p>Stand together through storm and stress… Mu Yu and the other members were shocked and looked around instinctively. They were so touched that they cried due to the audience’s chants.</p><p>…</p><p>Under the chanting, Lou Cheng returned to his seat. He first saw Shu Rui and her team recording details of the match.</p><p>Trying to be friendly, he waved at her. Just as he was about to go over and say hi, Shu Rui suddenly paled when she saw him. She even took a few steps backwards, as if she was afraid of getting affected by some mysterious things. Her team did the same thing. In the end, only the cameraman was left standing there, looking embarrassed.</p><p>“Cheng, that’s miraculous! You won the game without making a single move!” Just then, Cai Zongming gave him a thumbs-up to compliment him, resolving the awkwardness in the air.</p><p>“I’m pretty shocked… ” Lou Cheng smiled and walked to him.</p><p>Cai Zongming quietly moved back to keep a distance from Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Why are you hiding?” Lou Cheng said humorously, seeing Yan Zheke walking to his side with surprise and pleasure.</p><p>He already understood that these people were afraid of being affected by him and to be as unfortunate as Mu Yu.</p><p>Cai Zongming snickered, hiding behind Lin Que without a word.</p><p>“Are you still my friend?” Lou Cheng helplessly glanced at “Talker”.</p><p>“No, I’m not!” Cai Zongming answered without a shred of shame.</p><p>Lou Cheng was amused by his answer. When he saw his fairy moving to stand beside him without hesitation, he had one thought.</p><p>This was true love!</p><p>Just then, he heard his own master’s voice. “Maybe the legacy you got from Longhu Immortal can help you rebound supernatural abilities like Misfortune and Corvine Mouth.”</p><p>His words were like a lightning crossing his mind, clearing the fog in it. Lou Cheng immediately understood what had happened earlier.</p><p>When he was asleep, Jindan could sense approaching danger. Thus when he achieved the Dan stage, his supernatural ability seemed to have blended into his own Jindan.</p><p>Was this his third awakening ability? Of course, so far, most of the power in this supernatural ability was derived temporarily from the Jindan…</p><p>What should he call the supernatural ability that combined Blessed by God with his predicting ability? Son of Heaven? Lucky Star?</p><p>Lou Cheng subconsciously glanced at Li Mao and the other teammates. He was surprised to find them still wearing the same shocked expressions and showed no response to his Master’s explanation.</p><p>His master showed his strong ability again!</p><p>While Lou Cheng was still shocked about his master, Yan Zheke stood on her tiptoes and whispered in his ear.</p><p>“Cheng, did you notice anything odd in the match earlier?”</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled and explained, “I probably awakened my third supernatural ability, helping me deflect Mu Yu’s Misfortune and causing the boomerang effect. To be honest, this ability has been awakened a long time ago. But it’s either I haven’t notice it or I didn’t know its effects… ”</p><p>He shared with Coach Yan his experience catching a thief in the train station.</p><p>“Oh, I see… ” Yan Zheke looked at him with pleasant surprise, before harrumphing. “I’m so angry now! I thought it’s my ray of moral light that led you to victory! I thought it’s me who awakened your supernatural ability, Character!”</p><p>“Look. For Mu Yu to experience such serious boomerang effect, so your light is also working.” Lou Cheng tried his best to placate her. He thought of a problem and said, “Ke, why aren’t you afraid of being affected by my Misfortune and take the initiative to welcome me? Is it because you believe in me or is it because you think you need to worry because you have the light?”</p><p>Yan Zheke answered him with a snicker.</p><p>…</p><p>After waving goodbye to the audience, Mu Yu and the other members returned to their locker room.</p><p>Since the leader has already experienced the boomerang effect, Lin Xiaozhi was much more relieved and never worried she would be affected by his Misfortune. She took off her shoes and walked into the washroom. She took off all her amulets and stuffed them into the closet with her clothes.</p><p>With the splash of hot water on her, every cell of her body was quivering with comfort.</p><p>After shampooing her hair, Lin Xiaozhi began to enjoy her shower.</p><p>Just then, she saw the light overhead flashed a few times and sizzled.</p><p>After a brief struggle, the bulb finally died.</p><p>Lin Xiaozhi found the sizzling hot water had turned into the bone-chilling cold water.</p><p>This… She turned to look at her closet, feeling that her lovely amulets were so far out of her reach.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
