There’s going to be a scramble for it at half past nine!” said Qiu Zhigao while staring fixedly at the webpage.</p><p>Old Qiu had started looking for a girlfriend as soon as he entered college. Unluckily, on the one hand, girls who wanted to pursue him all failed to meet his standards. On the other hand, the ones he was attracted to were not interested in him at all. So he had to remain single, devoting all his energy into his studies and idols.</p><p><em>Mo Jingting?</em> Lou Cheng twisted his lips slightly and smiled before asking, “Where’s the vocal concert?”</p><p>Since he came back to Xing province from Moshang, his little niece Mo hadn’t contacted him as frequently as before except sending a message occasionally as proof of her existence. For Lou Cheng it was indeed good news because he didn’t have enough energy to deal with other girls.</p><p>“In Songcheng, don’t you know that? It was announced officially several days ago that in November she would hold a vocal concert in Songcheng! I can’t miss it!” Old Qiu replied excitedly, “Time is up, time is up…”</p><p>“Songcheng…” Lou Cheng frowned and soon beamed again.</p><p>It doesn’t matter. It occurred to Lou Cheng that the Universities Martial Arts competition kicked off in November. With their previous record, most of the games would be away from home, and he wouldn’t be in Songcheng for the weekend.</p><p>It would be perfect because he could avoid encountering Mo Jingting!</p><p>According to his master, Lin Que and he would take turns being the key player in the first half of the district contest in order to train the substitutes.</p><p>“Of course, otherwise, why would I bother waiting to book the ticket? What a chance this is!” Old Qiu said. Suddenly, he felt blue, “Qin Mo intends to buy second-hand tickets at a higher price!”</p><p>“If you fail this time, will you also buy a second-hand ticket?” Lou Cheng asked with a smile, and then climbed onto the bed and covered himself with the quilt.</p><p>Old Qiu was left gnashing his teeth in anger.</p><p>“Of course! It just requires me to save money for several days!”</p><p><em>That’s true love!</em> Lou Cheng said to himself.</p><p>Old Qiu’s family situation was average, just like Lou Cheng’s before he came into contact with martial arts. As a student, with no stable income, he still relied on his parents.</p><p>So he had no choice but to economize on food.</p><p>Lou Cheng stopped talking so he would not disturb Old Qiu. Taking out his cellphone, he found a photo sent by Yan Zheke, in which the girl was cleaning her dorm.</p><p>Smiling, Lou Cheng quickly typed praises to his fairy.</p><p>While the girl was busy cleaning, Lou Cheng logged in Longhu Club’s forum to scan the news of the top professional tournaments and news about Mighty title-holders such as Dragon King.</p><p>As a fighter who had set physical invulnerability as his goal, Lou Cheng focused on it not only as something he was interested in but also because it was closely related to him!</p><p>Lou Cheng still didn’t have enough fans in his own forum, so they seldom focus on other fighters, offering him very little news on this subject.</p><p>“Could some experts tell me which house layout is better?” The first post that came into Lou Cheng’s eyes reminded him of his mom.</p><p>One month had passed since she announced the decision to buy a new house, but obviously, she hadn’t found the house yet and had even expanded the search to other areas beyond their old neighborhood.</p><p><em>What a bore… Luckily I have transferred the 400 thousand to her…</em> Complaining about his mom silently, Lou Cheng began to take account of his savings.</p><p>On the one hand, his private instruction fee had increased to 3000 per hour. The crowds’ enthusiasm had died down and he only earned 40,000 yuan this time around. On the other hand, the part-time job brought him 20,000 yuan, so the balance in his account was now around 290,000 yuan after he deducted his expenditures. Lou Cheng didn’t need to worry about money for the time being.</p><p>He browsed through the post, taking notes on all the useful information. He planned to call his mum tonight so that he could guide her.</p><p>As he exited the post, he saw a hot post from “Unparalleled Dragon King”:</p><p>“Favored fighter of the age, the battle is about to begin. Lou Cheng VS Peng Leyun!”</p><p>Er… They still had two months to go before the opening ceremony of the University Martial Arts Competition, and at least three months before their match with Shanbei. So why was there someone paying attention to this right now? This topic had even become hot in such a popular forum like Longhu Club! Lou Cheng took a deep breath.</p><p>At this moment, Old Qiu jumped out and shouted cheerfully,</p><p>“I got the ticket! I got the ticket!”</p><p>…</p><p>In the male dormitory area of Shanbei University.</p><p>Xu Wannian, the Martial Arts Club manager, was standing outside the dormitory building and browsing through the news of “Heavenly Sones Competition,” forwarded by someone on his phone.</p><p><em>I’m really looking forward to it!</em> He said to himself and then called Peng Leyun.</p><p>“Junior brother Peng, hurry down! The training’s going to start and we’re all waiting for you!”</p><p>“Okay!” Peng Leyun answered concisely.</p><p>Before the sound of Peng Leyun’s voice had died away, Xu Wannian saw a window in the fifth floor burst open as a figure jumped down through it.</p><p>“There he goes again…” said Xu Wannian while sighing with his hands on his face. In the background, he could hear some freshmen screaming,</p><p>“Someone jumped off a building!”</p><p>“Someone jumped off a building!”</p><p>All of a sudden, the figure, while in midair. expanded as he stretched out both arms, like an eagle, and glided gracefully before he landed.</p><p>The moment he stepped onto the ground, there seemed to be a small earthquake.</p><p>“Let’s go.” taking advantage of the rebound, Peng Leyun flitted to Xu Wannian’s side and greeted him with a smile.</p><p>Taking a glance at where he landed, Xu Wannian didn’t find any obvious traces left, which shocked him and left him singing the praises of this junior brother.</p><p>He was getting more and more powerful!</p><p>There was dead silence. All the freshmen around looked as if they had seen a monster.</p><p>Just then, the dorm supervisor rushed out and yelled,</p><p>“Peng Leyun! Why didn’t you take the stairs again!”</p><p>“What if you scared someone?”</p><p>Instead of acting like an elegant but indifferent master, Peng Leyun shrugged and put on an embarrassed smile and said, “I was thinking about a problem, a very difficult one, and out of habit I took the shortcut.”</p><p>A shortcut? All the freshmen around widely opened their mouth in astonishment.</p><p>Xu Wannian could barely keep a smile off of his face as he apologized to the supervisor of the dorm.</p><p>“I’ll keep an eye on him!”</p><p>After saying this, he hurriedly left the “crime scene” with Peng Leyun.</p><p>“What do you think about the post?” he asked, handing over a cellphone without mentioning what had just happened since he was already quite used to it.</p><p>Peng Leyun looked through it and then laughed and said,</p><p>“Quite interesting. Everything will be okay as long as you don’t encounter Lou Cheng.”</p><p>“Yeah, the idea of my supernatural ability being subdued by him worries me. Luckily, Fang also has Big Dan now,” replied Xu Wannian.</p><p>As his Corvine Mouth supernatural ability had been enhanced gradually, he had a good chance to defeat an eighth-pin or even seventh-pin warrior to some extent. However, once his supernatural ability was subdued, his professional-ninth-pin body condition was absolutely unable to resist the attack from a dan-stage fighter.</p><p>At this point, he couldn’t help gossiping,” Junior brother Peng, when are you going to get to the inhuman level? I heard that Ren Li will soon reach Sixth Pin, and Lou Cheng is catching up fast.”</p><p>The championship of the upcoming Martial Arts Competition will be fierce. But everything would be easier if his junior brother could just step up a higher level.</p><p>As for whether Ren Li and Lou Cheng would also reach the inhuman level in the next session, it was not his concern since he would soon graduate from the university!</p><p>His face was clean, his eyes clear. Peng Leyun looked up at the skies and murmured to himself,</p><p>“When…”</p><p>The light in his eyes gradually emptied, and his movements became diffused, as if moving forward by instinct, but he was able to dodge obstacles like trees, stones, and frolicking students.</p><p>Ah, junior brother Peng has gone into a trance again, even when he was walking…” said Xu Wannian while sighing. He turned his thoughts from the Martial Arts Competition to the red-light district of Pingjiang, as well as the girls there.</p><p>Pulling down his collarband, Xu Wangnian felt his body heating up.</p><p>…</p><p>In the only campus of Sanjaing.</p><p>Qu Hui, who wore a white shirt today, was floating 30cm off the ground in his Martial Arts Club Office.</p><p>Looking at the group in front of him, he put on a faint smile and said, “Well, what do you think of this discussion?”</p><p>All the leading players and substitutes of the Martial Arts Club remained silent with their heads dropped down, as if they had done something wrong and dared not say anything.</p><p>“Luo Haizhe, you speak first.” Qu Hui had the authority to look down on others since he was also the Martial Arts Club’s coach.</p><p>Luo Haizhe was tall and simple, the childishness of his face had faded. He touched his half-bald head and replied,</p><p>“Those beasts of Songcheng University are growing too fast. Last year it was a walkover, this year they have two dan-stage warriors, and Lou Cheng is close to Seventh Pin.”</p><p>It was just like a nightmare!</p><p>Of course, there were talented fighters and Mighty Ones in the university martial arts circle. However, Dan-stage warriors were still scarcely seen in most schools. All in all, Dan stage was the real entry-level of martial arts. Though Sanjiang was a famous university with several professional-ninth-pin warriors in the previous sessions, no graduate had ever become a Big Dan and let Qi arise from within their body!</p><p>So, how difficult was it to reach Dan stage?</p><p>Given the fact that two students of Songcheng University Martial Arts Club had reached Dan stage within one year, wasn’t that the same as cheating?</p><p>“It was because of their talent, and we can’t do anything about it no matter how envious we are.” Qu Hui crossed his arms and said insincerely. Then, all of a sudden, his facial expression changed and he said, “Haizhe, you are actually talented. Even if you aren’t Peng Leyun, Ren Li, Lou Cheng or Lin Que’s match, and can’t reach the inhuman level. You are sure to get to the Dan stage. But look at yourself now, you’re such a playboy! You’d better stay away from your evil associates!”</p><p>“Okay,” Lou Haizhe replied and lowered his head.</p><p>This was his greatest shortcoming. He couldn’t deny it.</p><p>After scolding Luo Haizhe, Qu Hui turned his gaze to another team member and frowned before saying,</p><p>“Be careful. You are also likely to reach the Dan stage. Don’t you want to take a step further before graduation? Then you’ll have a good life in the future.”</p><p>Yin Xiangxi put on a wry smile and said, “We’ve known each other for more than three years and you know my character.”</p><p>He was famous for his radical fighting style, being at ease, never using any defensive play unless it was absolutely necessary.</p><p>Because of this shortcoming, he had been injured several times in the recent years even though the referees had stopped him in time. His talent was also wasted since he was unable to keep practicing martial arts.</p><p>They were all troublemakers… Qu Hui stared at the cellphone on the table without saying more to them.</p><p>In the discussion of this division, they only mentioned Shanbei and Songcheng University. The fighters they mentioned were Peng Leyun, Fang Zhirong, Lou Cheng, and Lin Que, which meant they had totally ignored Sanjiang College! They had totally ignored Qu Hui!</p><p><em>Sorry, I’ve also reached the Dan stage and improved my supernatural ability!</em></p><p><em>Shanbei, Songcheng University, just wait for my surprise!</em></p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
