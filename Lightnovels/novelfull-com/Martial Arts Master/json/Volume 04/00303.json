He stood at Weishui Lake with eager eyes, waiting for his master to teach him something about Dan stage.</p><p>He focused on rehabilitative practice in his two recent morning training.</p><p>Pacing back and forth with both hands behind him, Geezer Shi snickered. “Not bad. You managed to be patient, only asking this now. As for the Dan stage, we all have a common understanding that it’s about inheriting the past and ushering in the future. How should I put it? You should keep your concealment of spirit and qi simple and still. Direct it towards your own spirit refining. That means to combine your spirit with qi, blood, and force as a preparation for connecting heaven and earth. Second, you should surpass the limit of your physical body and mortal condition to refine your root pulp. Third, after doing all these, your speed, responsiveness, coordination and body-controlling ability will be greatly enhanced. You can then combine the basic skill of gathering strength with the corresponding body moves to form real movements.”</p><p>“Combine them to form real moves?” Lou Cheng asked, confused.</p><p>Was what he was using all along not moves at all?</p><p>Geezer Shi took out a small wine pot, took a swig, and smacked his lips. “Think about it. Didn’t you notice that the moves in 24 Blizzard Strikes and Thunder Roar Zen are simple and practical? Besides strength-gathering skill, strength-borrowing method, and corresponding visualization method, you only have to learn basic moves like avalanche, blast, chop, whip, burst, pound, and smash.”</p><p>“But in my fights, I’ll combine them basing on the situation. Aren’t those considered moves?” Lou Cheng gradually understood what his master meant.</p><p>“Yes, those are the most basic of moves. Why else would the fighting style of the Dan stage be called the link between the past and the future?” Geezer Shi replied smugly. “But the moves at Dan stage are the result of our pioneers’ adjustment and improvement. They’re of course superior to the moves you come up with on the spot. As you go further, you will learn killing moves.”</p><p>“Of course, you can’t be restricted by our predecessors’ moves. However powerful they are, you still need to apply them to actual combats. When you’ve truly mastered them, you can use them in different combinations as you will. Then you’ll be truly a master.”</p><p>Lou Cheng asked in bewilderment, “So what’s the difference from the basic moves I’ve been using? They’re all used in combinations based on my situation at my will.”</p><p>“Of course they’re different! It’s just like taking an exam. One doesn’t know anything and rakes his brain during the exam, and the other has studied known knowledge before comprehending his own, do you think there’s no difference?” Geezer Shi scoffed.</p><p>So it was the difference between professional and laymen… Lou Cheng suddenly saw the light. “Is it the so-called three stages of learning kungfu? First, learn what’s visible. Second, learn what’s invisible. Third, realize that what is the invisible is actually hidden in the visible?”</p><p>“If you put it that way, you’re not wrong.” Geezer Shi coughed. “I’ll start from visualization method. You won’t have much problem with the parts about the Dan stage since you’re already acquainted with it. As for the spiritual cultivation, you’ll progress from Condensation Stance to Ice Mirror. It’s fine if you haven’t reached the threshold of Ice Mirror. It’s fine if you apply what little you know onto Condensation Stance.”</p><p>“Master, I’ll soon reach the threshold of Ice Mirror,” Lou Cheng said joyfully.</p><p>After the preliminary combination of energy and force, Lou Cheng had gotten some feel for the practice of Ice Mirror on the base of meditation and was about to slowly reach the threshold. Though he could not progress at lighting-speed, he was sure to begin practicing the real Ice Mirror in two or three months, at most half a year!</p><p>“That’s not what I want to hear!” Geezer Shi glared at him. “When you reach the threshold of Ice Mirror, your spiritual cultivation will be based on it. You can continue practicing until you reach the physical-invulnerability state. As for body-refining, you can depend on the Cold and Frozen Blueprint and Frozen River Diagram that you’ve already learned. They’re both above the mortal level.”</p><p>“What? Isn’t it called Frost Force?” Lou Cheng was perplexed.</p><p>Geezer Shi gave a smug smile. “It’s called Frost Force when used as martial arts move and Body-Refining Method when used within your body. That’s why it is called the Core Force of Ice Sect. I didn’t bring it up earlier because your body wasn’t tough enough to bear the pressure of force-withdrawing. Once you practice it, you’ll definitely get injured and be destroyed.”</p><p>“That’s also why a warrior needs to determine his cultivation methods at the beginning of the Dan stage. You need to distinguish between the primary and the secondary. The corresponding Force will affect your martial arts root and change your body condition from the biological level. If it’s a mess, it’ll contradict each other. You’ll end up suffering a genetic breakdown!”</p><p>After reading so many military research reports, he started using one of their jargons.</p><p>“Is that so… ” Something suddenly occurred to Lou Cheng. “Master, since I’m rooted in the balance of Ice and Flame Force, what can I do to keep them in harmony and prevent any harm to them?”</p><p>“I don’t have experience in this!” Geezer Shi’s answer greatly shocked Lou Cheng. “Who told you to awaken both Ice and Flame supernatural abilities and combine cultivation method with martial arts?”</p><p>Leaving Lou Cheng no chance to raise another question, Geezer Shi continued with a smile, “But to be honest, these are all non-issues. Your root has long transformed. Why else would you develop a supernatural ability? Besides, isn’t your supernatural ability under the influence of Immortal Longhu’s remains and your Balance of Dan? There’s no contradiction, is there? This means your foundation has always fused with it and your body has always got used to it. As long as there isn’t any huge gap between the two forces, you won’t suffer a genetic breakdown.”</p><p>He had been so terrified earlier… Lou Cheng wiped the imaginary forehead off his forehead. “Master, does that mean I have to cultivate my Flame Force to keep up with Frost Force?”</p><p>“Exactly. It’s the same even after you reach physical-invulnerability state.” Geezer Shi nodded with a relaxed expression.</p><p>Lou Cheng became intrigued and asked, “Then what’s the corresponding physical-invulnerability force of Zhu Rong Force?”</p><p>How could he get it at a later stage?</p><p>“Fire Force, Emperor Yan Force,” Geezer Shi answered with a grin.</p><p>“Emperor Yan Force… Why does it sound so familiar?” Lou Cheng blurted out.</p><p>“It’d be weird if you’re not familiar with it. It’s Dragon King’s special skill.” Geezer Shi coughed twice and straightened his back with his hands behind him.</p><p>“Oh, right… ” Lou Cheng subconsciously mimicked Yan Zheke’s favorite saying.</p><p>After getting to know each other for some time, they gradually became affected by each other.</p><p>Lou Cheng suddenly came to himself and asked in astonishment, “Is it a kungfu from the Fire Sect?”</p><p>Fire Sect! Fire Sect from the Five Sects Unique Skill of the Taoist School!</p><p>Unlike the Ice Magical Kungfu, which was dubbed the Unique Skill of the Ice Sect, the kungfu itself was called the Fire Sect!</p><p>“Exactly. I’ve exhausted a lot of my connections and reputation to get this.” Geezer Shi nodded triumphantly, satisfied with his silly disciple’s reaction.</p><p>Lou Cheng was greatly moved, but he knew what his master wanted was not words of thanks. Thus, he replied in a manner befitting his master’s taste.</p><p>“You’re amazing! You managed to get even the Fire Sect kungfu!”</p><p>“Though I’m a little old, my network is quite useful.” Geezer Shi’s cough became smooth as he added, “And some people think rather highly of you, so perhaps… ”</p><p>“Perhaps what?” Lou Cheng asked.</p><p>“Nothing. I’m just saying,” Geezer Shi replied casually. “Let’s continue our topic. Inner Withdrawing is done in the reverse. First, use the Frozen River Diagram and then Freezing Cold Blueprint. This way, you can refine even the smallest parts of your body and gradually adjust your root and core. When you reach the immortal level, you’ll be able to transform bit by bit… ”</p><p>He explained the Inner-refining Method of the Dan stage, showing Lou Cheng its difference from the combination of Frost Force and Zhu Rong Force. His explanation was detailed, lest his disciple made mistakes in the future.</p><p>After Lou Cheng made several attempts and Geezer Shi confirmed that there would not be any initial problems, he said,</p><p>“There are two kinds of kungfu at the Dan stage. The first one, as I’ve mentioned, is our predecessors’ combined movements. The other is simple moves as an application of materialized Force at physical-invulnerability level. Your supernatural ability is quite similar to this. You can practice it in advance, though it naturally won’t be powerful.”</p><p>“In the coming few months, practice the three moves first.” Geezer Shi’s expression suddenly turned solemn.</p><p>Lou Cheng immediately held his breath and waited for his master to announce the three moves.</p><p>Geezer Shi cleared his throat.</p><p>“The 13th movement of the Ice Sect, Snow Cover!”</p><p>“The 19th movement of the Ice Sect, Cold Swallow!”</p><p>“The 26th movement of the Ice Sect, Ice Burning!”</p><p>In Lou Cheng’s excitement, a thought suddenly came to him.</p><p>This was the privilege of a first-class disciple!</p><p>From now on, he would widen the gap between him and Zhang Zhutong, Han Zhifei, and the rest of his former opponents even without his Jindan.</p><p>Feeling fortunate and grateful, Lou Cheng began to pay full attention to his practice of the new movements. He then heard his master say,</p><p>“Okay, practice by yourself for a while. Remember it’s your first special training class today. Don’t be late.”</p><p>Recalling something, Lou Cheng left his stance and asked,</p><p>“Master, have you prepared the Internal Trainning Methods for the Martial Arts Club?”</p><p>He, Ke, and Brother-in-law already had a method, but not the other members!</p><p>“I’m still considering it.” Geezer Shi took a sip of wine.</p><p>Lou Cheng gave him a smile.</p><p>“Then I won’t trouble you for it. I’ve prepared one for them.”</p><p>“Where did you get it from?” Geezer Shi gave his disciple an once-over.</p><p>“Remember I went to guide Xiushan Team in their special training? When the chairman wanted to compensate me, I remembered that our team members still lacked an Internal Trainning Methods. So I asked him for something related to their team’s Internal Training Methods. It’s not the best, but good enough for them.” Lou Cheng grinned.</p><p>This would not only help his teammates but also friends and relatives who wanted to enter the martial arts circle but was unable to enter the Ice God Sect.</p><p>Geezer Shi huffed. “You exchanged your tiny bit of contribution with an Internal Training Method? You only taught them once a week!”</p><p>“I was also embarrassed and thought I needed to chip in some money. But Chairman Wei agreed easily. He’s really a good guy,” said Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Yeah, he’s good. The method isn’t his anyway. Taking something belonging to the Foundation to exchange for goodwill with a promising mighty one like you, isn’t that very cost-effective?” Geezer Shi thought it was ridiculous and laughable.</p><p>Lou Cheng chuckled dryly without replying. Ke had already come up with the same analysis for him.</p><p>“Give me the diagram of the Inner-refining Method then.” Geezer Shi tut-tutted and turned around. “I didn’t think you’d be so concerned about the Martial Arts Club.”</p><p>Internal Training Methods of this level do not touch the core and spirit yet.</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled. “Our foundation is weak. If we want to catch up to other famous martial art schools, we need to make the most of everyone’s strength.”</p><p>“You’re pretty ambitious,” said Geezer Shi, pretending to scold him.</p><p>“Hehe. Master, don’t tell them I’m the one who gave them the method. I don’t want them to be uncomfortable in front of me.” Lou Cheng requested it of his master sincerely.</p><p>“Oh, you want to be an anonymous saint? Okay, deal.” Geezer Shi waved him goodbye and walked towards the long bridge.</p><p>That was because he was not narrow-minded! Lou Cheng complained a little in his mind and then continued to refine his stamina.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
