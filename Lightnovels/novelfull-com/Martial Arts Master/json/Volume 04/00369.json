While she was waiting for the computer to be ready, she also updated a post in the forum with her phone.</p><p>“Hello, is anybody here? No baby should ever miss the program, no matter what happens. Maybe I will also be on the program tonight, can you guess which one I am? Because I look different in reality than I do in the pictures.”</p><p>The program that was made by Shu Rui’s team would be broadcast on Songcheng Television during its golden time. Although Yan Xiaoling missed watching the drawing part several times, she still had been recording video because she frequently stayed in the martial arts arena. As for what would be in the final edit of the official broadcasting version, she was still not clear.</p><p>“Hey, aren’t you the shortest one?” “Unparalleled Dragon King” would take every chance to ridicule Yan Xiaoling.</p><p>Yan Xiaoling replied with grievance, “I am not. Huh, there was someone shorter than me in our Martial Arts Club. The girl I met recently, Qingqing, is one centimeter shorter than me. And Xiaohei is two centimeters, no, three centimeters shorter than me!”</p><p>“But still, can this difference be observed with the naked eye?” “Road to the Arena” also made fun of her.</p><p>Ridiculing “Eternal Nightfall”, Yan Xiaoling, had become a show in Lou Cheng’s fan forum. Even the fans in the forum of the Longhu Club would often join in on this activity.</p><p>“How big a difference two centimeters makes! They all say that if I don’t talk when I stand with them, I look like their sister.” Yan Xiaoling talked back to them excitedly. “I won’t talk with you from now on because the show is starting!”</p><p>“Get yourself a small bench and watch the program quietly (holding the chin with one hand emoji).” “Wonton Seller” also came from the other forum to have fun here.</p><p>“Little Wonton, how can you watch it if you have a self-study lesson at night?” “Brahman” was shocked.</p><p>“Wonton Seller” sent a “glutinous rice dumpling” emoji and said, “Because I have a cold, so I asked for a leave… But wait, how about my plan of doing some exercises?”</p><p>“I can do the exercises while watching the program!” “Brahman”, this little girl, replied, showing no embarrassment or sorrow.</p><p>At that moment,a picture of the new campus of Songcheng University appeared on Yan Xiaoling’s computer screen. With lakes, mountains, and brightly-colored buildings, this university looked just like a garden.</p><p>“It has been many years since the Songcheng University Martial Arts Club last went to the National Competition. However, now they will finally take the best opportunity. The two geniuses in this university bring us lots of hope. From the beginning of this semester, led by Lou Cheng and Lin Que, they will try their best to fight in the National Competition. We chose to accompany them during the entire process and record their life honestly.</p><p>“And while I’m recording what I said just now, I don’t know what kind of performance the Songcheng University Martial Arts Club will put out later on… ”</p><p>As Shu Rui was speaking like she was narrating a documentary. The long shot changed and moved the scene from a place far away to Songcheng University’s martial arts arena. The camera recorded the scene of many students going in and out of the arena.</p><p>“Da da da!” Some typing sounds were made by a typewriter. On the screen, there was a sentence: “In early September XXXX “.</p><p>Inside the martial arts arena, the atmosphere was warm and soft. Several members who had arrived earlier had already been doing warm-ups. The scene shifted to a doorway, and a man that everyone was familiar with then entered in.</p><p>“Hey, Lou Cheng, you have come so early today.” Shu Rui greeted him.</p><p>Lou Cheng did not feel embarrassed when he was facing the camera; he behaved very calmly and naturally. He even made a joke. “It’s not early right now, Reporter Shu. Even your team has already arrived.”</p><p>Next, he answered her about his goal of this martial arts competition, which was: “He who doesn’t want to be a general is not a good soldier”. Yan Zheke also appeared on the scene without any make-up and accepted the sudden shooting of the program. At last, the audience was amused by the scene in which Lin Que cheered for Shu Rui under the condition that Shu Rui was the interviewer.</p><p>The camera recorded their life truthfully. The audience could clearly see the surprised expressions on the faces of members when they got the Internal Training Methods. Furthermore, the scenes of all the members tempering so hard while still sometimes telling some jokes to relax one other were recorded. While the audience was watching this program, they also calmed down and immersed themselves in it. They seemed to follow all the members of the Songcheng University Martial Arts Club to advance to the final round of the National University Martial Arts Competition step by step.</p><p>Because it was a real scene, it was exciting. That was the charm of the documentary.</p><p>Yan Xiaoling, who was still talking and chatting in the forum, unconsciously put the phone down and focused on the computer screen. She saw the scene showing that after finishing the special training, Lin Que took the initiative to ask Lou Cheng to fight with him. She felt it was a pity that this program did not record that fight. In addition, she saw the reactions that the members had after they had drawn the first time. She also saw He Zi, who shrank in the corner and sent the freshest news about the team. He Zi was also called “Cat Reporter”.</p><p>Yan Xiaoxia thought while inexplicably laughing.</p><p>Then she saw that all vspectators were shouting, “We’re coming” in unison before the first match of the Martial Arts Club. The mysterious locker room also clearly appeared on the screen. In the program, Lou Cheng was smearing ointment to cure redness and bruises. The scene in which Lin Que was drying his short, wet hair as he came out of the bathroom was also recorded. The audience also saw that Yan Zheke, who was much more beautiful than movie stars, was also standing in front of the window of the cafeteria like millions of other college students and left with a dish in her hand. They saw that Lou Cheng, who was one of the candidates for the favored fighters of the age, was as normal as everyone else around him when he was eating bread and drinking soybean milk.</p><p>In the bright classroom, as students, they were concentrated on learning. Meanwhile, they also kept going with their special training. The program also recorded Li Mao, Sun Jian, Cai Zongming, and others. They showed their real lives to the audience and showed their strong desire to go to the National Competition.</p><p>Their team successfully advanced in the group competition. Then they easily defeated their opponent in the quarterfinals. During this process, the details of their competitions were linked together, so the audience felt refreshed while watching it. After watching this program, they felt that they understood the members once again from a different perspective. For example, they saw that while Lou Cheng got the supernatural ability to rebound Misfortune, other members would unconsciously be afraid of Lou Cheng and would avoid meeting him.</p><p>When Li Mao and other members learned the fact that, in the first round of the semifinal, their opponent was Shanbei, they were shocked. However, the audience still saw the faint excitement and nervousness in Lou Cheng and Lin Que’s eyes.</p><p>The first climax of the program appeared when their team fought with Shanbei on away ground. The camera also recorded the story of Lou Cheng, who kept getting up to practice at half past five every morning. The program also perfectly portrayed the unspeakable feelings Lou Cheng had when he happened to meet Peng Leyun on the grounds.</p><p>After watching the intense competition, the audience saw the depressed emotions on the faces of all the members, the inspiring speech that Geezer Shi gave to encourage them the next day, the hard-work attitude that Lou Cheng and other members showed, and the touching scene of students of Songcheng University spontaneously going to the arena on the weekend to use the slogan “Come On” to cheer for the Martial Arts Club.</p><p>They then defeated Sanjiang and Haiyuan and successfully advanced to the final rounds. The program also presented the process of the members of the Martial Arts Club going to a food stall to celebrate their victory, which made the audience think that this group of young people was very real and modest.</p><p>With the new year came a new start. In the program, people could clearly see the sweat that the members had when they were practicing and the violent pair exercises that they did every day. The camera then shot the moment when Lou Cheng and the other members got on the bus one by one, which was then driven to the airport.</p><p>And finally, the scene focused on the image of all the members of the Martial Arts Club standing in a circle hand in hand as they shouted in unison,</p><p>“The National Games!”</p><p>The typing sound was played while the background became more blurred. Several black words were highlighted on the screen:</p><p>“April 5th. The National University Martial Arts Competitions. The final round!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Huh… ” Yan Xiaoling exhaled a breath and felt satisfied after she watched the program. She intended to collect a copy of this video and keep it.</p><p><em>Yes, just like my idol, Lou Cheng, I am also a qualified squirrel-man!</em></p><p>“All Good Names Are Taken by Dogs” sent the first post in the forum and sighed.</p><p>“Lou Cheng is actually a funny person… Raise your hand if you agree with me! Did anyone else feel the interaction between Lin Que and reporter Shu was very cute?”</p><p>“No, I think the interaction between Lin Que and everyone else is cute.” “Shuilan,” who had a sign like “Forever Eighteen,” talked back to him.</p><p>“You make sense… What’s more, I always thought that Lou Cheng may have a relationship with Yan Zheke!” “All Good Names Are Taken By Dogs” had found some details and facts.</p><p>“Didn’t you come to this forum during the last match?” “Okamoto’s Fan” threw up his hands.</p><p>“I have become a fan of Sister Yan. She is really pretty, so pretty, gorgeous… ” A new member of the forum named “A Heavenly Steed Soaring Across the Sky” said.</p><p>“Unparalleled Dragon King” sent a post to ridicule them. “You guys, ah, just pay attention to adultery and gossip. Shouldn’t you focus on the matches between the favored fighters of the age, such as Lou Cheng, Peng Leyun, Ren Li, Ann Chaoyang, and Zhen Huansheng? They are about to trade ferocious fists with each other. Their fights will make us fume with anger and wonder who the real favored fighter of the age should be.”</p><p>“Trade fists, fuming in anger… I’m sorry, I was thinking something about sex. Wait for me to stop my nosebleed.” “Bull Demon King” made a dirty joke again.</p><p>“Dragons, dragons, I seriously want to discuss this. No. First, let me wipe off my saliva because both the real Lou Cheng and Lin Que are very attractive!” “Wonton Seller” asked, “Which level do you think Peng Leyun and others have achieved?”</p><p>“Holy sh*t, Little Wonton. You actually want to discuss such a serious topic!” “Unparalleled Dragon King” chose to ridicule all the people who talked to him. “This year, whether the result will be clear depends on Peng Leyun. Has he achieved the Inhuman stage? So it’s hard to tell the result now. Ren Li may have already achieved the top strength of the Professional Sixth Pin. I can’t guess Lou Cheng’s strength, because he always makes miracles. But he definitely is a fighter of strong Professional Sixth Pin. Ann Chaoyang and Zhen Huansheng also were said to have achieved the Professional Sixth Pin. As for whether they are powerful fighters of the Sixth Pin, it is hard to say. But Lin Que, he probably is a powerful fighter of the Seventh Pin.”</p><p>“It sounds like our idol is great.” “Brahman” covered her mouth and laughed. “Wait a minute, have you seen Little Changye?”</p><p>“No, isn’t Lingling too short to be seen by us?” “Nie Qiqi” made fun of her.</p><p>Because the National Competition had attracted many people, there were many new fans in Lou Cheng’s forum. His forum became more and more popular. Some people praised him, while some disdained him.</p><p>…</p><p>While the fans were talking about the program, Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke also took their eyes away from the computer screen.</p><p>“Reporter Shu is a good person. She never broadcasted anything about our relationship,” Yan Zheke said with her bright eyes.</p><p>“Of course, I specifically asked her not to.” Lou Cheng laughed.</p><p>And he also asked Shu Rui to cut out the moments between Ke and him and send it to him because he intended to use it in the future!</p><p>But for now, he would not share this secret with Ke!</p><p>“Do you actually talk to Shu Rui behind my back?” Yen Zheke turned around and gazed at him.</p><p><em>“Eh, why does she focus on this point…”</em> Lou Cheng blinked his eyes and said innocently, “I just called her once… ”</p><p>After seeing his reaction, Yan Zheke let out a laugh. “I’m just trying to scare you!”</p><p>She then looked up and said while thinking something over, “I don’t think you only asked Reporter Shu to not broadcast those moments. But, hmm, as far as I know, you have a habit to collect moments like this, so you also asked her to send you those moments! Yes or no?”</p><p>“… Dear classmate, can you allow yourself to be surprised?” Lou Cheng at first sat there dumbly for a while, and then gave her a funny answer.</p><p><em>When did Ke learn so much about me?</em></p><p>“Because I want to see the moments right now,” Yan Zheke said with emotion in her eyes.</p><p>They again began to watch another version of that program together.</p><p>…</p><p>The reason why the Songcheng University Martial Arts Club had chosen to come to the capital several days early was to adapt to the dry weather and the great temperature difference between day and night there so that they could keep these conditions from influencing their health.</p><p>After they had adjusted themselves for two days, at 7:40 PM on April 5th, it was time for the C group to begin their group competition. From this group, Shanbei University Martial Arts Club had won the championship last year.</p><p>In the city stadium, surrounded by cheering sounds, Lou Cheng saw that Peng Leyun was the last fighter on his team and had defeated the leading fighter of Xinghai School. Peng Leyun’s team had the first victory of the group competition.</p><p>“I still don’t know which level he is at now… ” At the beginning of another competition of Group C, Lou Cheng looked toward Yan Zheke, who was sitting next to him, and whispered to himself.</p><p>All the National Competitions were held in the evening, so there was only one group competition per day. That is to say, each team would have about a four-day break after they finished their group competition. Furthermore, before the quarterfinals, they would be given two days to adjust their health states. The same went for the semifinals and the finals.</p><p>Because the group who had the championship team should compete first, the order of the group competition was CDAB. The Songcheng University Martial Arts Club would fight against the Hudong University Martial Arts Club in the second round on April 6th.</p><p>As for this fight, Lou Cheng dared not show any ignorance or carelessness. Because once a team advanced, the rule would be that the group which ranked first must fight against the group which ranked second. If they happened to become second, they would be forced to fight against Shanbei or Capital in the quarterfinals. So even if they could gain a victory, they would be hurt badly and would simply be unable to confront the following opponents, because the teams that could advance to the national finals were really powerful and were hard to deal with!</p><p>As for Huahai Club in particular, Ann Chaoyang certainly had the strength of Sixth Pin, while Piao Yuan’s strength was closer to Seventh Pin. The other team members were also more powerful than Lou Cheng’s Martial Arts Club!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
