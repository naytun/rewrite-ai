He almost forgot that his frozen body was already able to move, forgot to stand up, and forgot about his public image.</p><p>“He extended the fight just to enjoy the experience of fighting against someone with the supernatural ability to fly?”</p><p>Tok Tok Tok! Qu Hui’s heart was beating quickly, pumping hot blood and diluting the remaining Frost Force. However, instead of feeling warm, he felt like he had fallen into an ice pit that was gloomy, cold, and oppressive.</p><p>Is this what despair tastes like?</p><p>Is the gap between us this wide?</p><p>I could still be defeated within seconds even though he hasn’t recovered from internal injuries yet?</p><p>All the positive self-images turned into sarcasm and slaps to his own face…</p><p>How could a pig fly!</p><p>Lou Cheng</p><p>made a gesture to show his respect and then turned to walk downstairs.</p><p>To be honest, Qu Hui’s combat ability was the same as a Seventh-Pin fighter. Any other initial Sixth-Pin fighter who was recovering from internal injuries would end up shipwrecked in a ditch if they underestimated this opponent. However, some of Lou Cheng’s special kungfu restrained Qu Hui’s movement, enabling Lou Cheng to perform an instakill as if he was fighting against a fighter with no supernatural ability, who had just entered the Dan stage.</p><p>For example, though the Ice Mirror couldn’t help Lou Cheng predict when and how his opponent would use the supernatural flying ability, he knew Qu Hui would kick first instead of crashing towards him directly, so he could still sense Qu Hui’s prelude in advance. Thus Lou Cheng was able to “predict” Qu Hui’s movement and react to it in advance. As a result, however odd Qu Hui’s direction-changing ability was, all of his efforts were in vain. Meanwhile, the Bing Formula could reach its target from a distance, which helped Lou Cheng attack Qu Hui without approaching him. On the other side, Qu Hui neither had any special defense methods nor a strong spirit that was capable of resisting Lou Cheng’s attack directly. Considering all of this, it’s no surprise that Lou Cheng was the winner.</p><p>In other words, it would be more difficult for Lou Cheng to fight against any other normal Seventh-Pin fighter in his present physical condition.</p><p>Of course, the rule of the Challenge Tournament also restrained Qu Hui’s actions. If weapons were permitted, Qu Hui would probably be able to change the result by using a bow, a bolt, or a gun while flying in midair.</p><p>Seeing Lou Cheng leaving the arena and walking towards the auditorium, the audience gradually quieted down, only leaving a trace of the previous boos echoing in the gymnasium.</p><p>They would be actually be booing themselves if they continued.</p><p>Coming back along the path, Lou Cheng was greeted by Yan Zheke, who yelled with a big smile and clenched fists,</p><p>“Cheng, good job! You did your best!”</p><p>It was actually a joke in response to the previous “You’ve tried your best” and “Good job”.</p><p>Exchanging a tacit smile, Lou Cheng felt even happier. After a fist bump with Yan Zheke, he gave five to Lin Que, Li Mao, and Cai Zongming one by one, and all of them were overjoyed.</p><p>Since Haiyuan was weaker than Sanjiang, they had practically reached the national competition with today’s victory!</p><p>“Though I want to celebrate, my reason is warning me that I can’t arrogantly look down on Haiyuan,” Sun Jian said and laughed.</p><p>“I’m so glad that you’re being rational! Just lay low and build your good character!” Lin Hua said, casting a glance at him.</p><p>Old Shi waved to dissolve the cheering crowd and said, “Go back to the locker room first. You have the nerve to celebrate in front of all these sad students?”</p><p>“Of course we have the nerve!” Cai Zongming answered without hesitation.</p><p>Though saying that, he still followed the group to the locker room, leaving the depressed audience behind.</p><p>Yeah, they definitely had the nerve to celebrate, but Cai Zongming was afraid of being surrounded and trampled by young students driven by impulsiveness…</p><p>Yan Xiaoling was still in the stands like an abandoned quail, not knowing what to do. The gloomy faces around were so scary that she dared not celebrate.</p><p>“Oh, no!” She sighed deliberately and hinted for Mu Jinnian to lower her head and pretend they were also depressed.</p><p>Don’t beat me, I’m one of you!</p><p>…</p><p>At 3:45 pm on January 5th, in the martial arts arena of Haiyuan School.</p><p>While watching the fierce match in the arena, Lou Cheng leaned over to Yan Zheke, smiled towards her, and whispered in her ear,</p><p>“Your brother doesn’t want me to fight today?”</p><p>Yan Zheke rolled her eyes at him and said, “Wasn’t it enough that my brother left you a complete Qu Hui in the last match?”</p><p>It was Sun Jian’s turn to be the forward in the competition against Haiyuan School, but he was unlucky enough to encounter one of the opponent’s leading players, Cheng Du and Jin Sha, who were both Dan-stage fighters with a supernatural ability. But Lin Que soon replaced Sun Jian and got revenge for him with Doomed Death after a three-minute fierce battle.</p><p>In the third round, Lin Que seized the opportunity to defeat a Professional-Ninth-Pin warrior through a burst of Dan stage, and he was now fighting against another Professional-Ninth-Pin with his tired body.</p><p>While Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke were whispering to each other, Lin Que discovered his opponent’s flaw with mercurial balance and immediately threw out a rapid series of blows full of Meteor force.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lu Yaqian felt her Qi and blood were burning, almost bursting out from her throat, and all of her internal organs seemed to be trembling along with her fascia and muscles. Trying in vain to raise her arms and gather strength, she could do nothing else but watch Lin Que’s fist approach her, finally stopping next to her temple.</p><p>The referee raised his right hand and announced loudly with the sound from his Dantian,</p><p>“Round Four, Lin Que wins!”</p><p>“The final result, Songcheng University Martial Arts Club wins!”</p><p>Lin Que withdrew his fist and began gasping. While the sweat was dripping from his forehead, his eyes, filled with tiredness, were full of joy.</p><p>Lou Cheng and the others sprang up to give five to each other as if saying “Happy New Year” in the Spring Festival.</p><p>National Competitions, we’re coming!</p><p>They were not cheering out of excitement after winning a hard battle, but for finally gaining what they deserved.</p><p>When they came back to the campus in Songcheng, Cai Zongming grinned and suggested,</p><p>“Shall we dine together to celebrate our victory?”</p><p>It was quite reasonable since Song Cheng University Martial Arts Club had not participated in the National Competition for many years!</p><p>“Okay, where shall we go?” Lou Cheng agreed without any hesitation at all.</p><p>After saying that, he suddenly realized it was not his decision to make and hurried to turn his gaze toward Old Shi with an embarrassed look.</p><p>“Go go go. Enjoy yourself and celebrate your victory in however you like since it’s someone’s treat. But don’t forget to bring me some good wine. Just chalk up the cost to Martial Arts Club’s account.” Old Shi promised with a big smile.</p><p>The crowd let out a whoop of joy and then began discussing where to meet up. Finally, Little Ming announced,</p><p>“Let’s go to the sidewalk snack booth. Although it’s a low-end restaurant, we are free to enjoy ourselves there and the atmosphere is suitable for our celebration.</p><p>After inviting Shu Rui and her team, the Martial Arts Club reached a sidewalk snack booth near their old campus and seated themselves. They ordered a full table of dishes including roasted, wok braised goose lips, etc.</p><p>After opening one bottle of wine for Old Shi and serving themselves juice, they all toasted their victory in front of the camera and yelled in excitement,</p><p>“National Competition! National Competition!”</p><p>It was an announcement from a group of aspiring youth!</p><p>The cheering crowd reminded Shu Rui of when she was in her prime, in university, and she couldn’t help sighing with emotion.</p><p>If she could go back to the first day of school, she would cherish and enjoy every bit of her school life.</p><p>Once they graduated from school, they would say goodbye to each other and start pursuing their own goals separately. Then lots of friendships and happy memories would slowly dissipate.</p><p>However, they were too excited to control their tone and ended up annoying those sitting nearby. Soon a man with tattoos on his arms went to them and yelled,</p><p>“You’re so noisy!”</p><p>“Sorry, we will behave ourselves.” Lou Cheng hurried to apologize in embarrassment, feeling their behavior transgressed social morality.</p><p>The young man looked around and then sneered before saying,</p><p>“Do you think that’s good enough?”</p><p>Several strong men stood up from his table.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s lips twitched, then he said,</p><p>“What about this?”</p><p>With a flip of his wrists, a fireball was thrown onto the ground, exploding in front of the man with tattoos as the flames roared, casting light on their faces.</p><p>… The young man with tattoos was stunned, not knowing whether to step forward or back. One of his trembling fellows came to muddle through the affair and then helped him to walk back.</p><p>Ignoring the astonishment of people sitting around, Lou Cheng withdrew his hand, sat down, and began biting a stick of beef.</p><p>Though we don’t want to cause trouble, we are not afraid of trouble!</p><p>“Cheng, that’s not your usual style?” Yan Zheke asked, leaned over toward him, and smiled.</p><p>“Why isn’t it?” Lou Cheng felt it funny and then asked in response.</p><p>Rolling her eyes and slightly biting her lips, Yan Zheke replied, “I expected you to break the cement floor with one step and scare them back, but you used the power of blaze instead. Well, it was more exaggerated than your usual style~!”</p><p>” You alone understand me. Actually, at first I intended to lay low after breaking the floor, but I gave up the idea after serious consideration.” Lou Cheng said and then sighed.</p><p>“Why?” Yan Zheke blinked, bewildered and concerned.</p><p>Lou Cheng replied with deep hatred and resentment, “I would be fined if I broke the floor!”</p><p>Once bitten by a snake, one shies away from a coiled rope for the next ten years!</p><p>Haha! Yan Zheke turned to hide her laughter while her body was trembling.</p><p>When the dinner came to its end, it was past eight in the evening. Everyone was full so they began toasting and yelling,</p><p>“National Competition! National Competition!”</p><p>…</p><p>It as almost time for Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke’s examination week, so they had to suffer through a mixture of reviewing and testing.</p><p>When the 16th of January finally arrived and they only had one last exam, something else important happened.</p><p>The lot-drawing ceremony for the National University Division Martial Arts Competition!</p><p>Sixteen tough martial arts teams from eight divisions would fight against each other in groups!</p><p>Every member of the martial arts club gathered in front of the computer in the office, waiting for the live broadcast.</p><p>Shu Rui was also there to record their reactions.</p><p>For her, Songcheng University was on the same level as Huahai and Guangnan, while being just a little weaker than Shan University and Capital University. So they had a chance to make it into the top four. Since it was their first time joining the national competition, they had no historical performance and were unable to be ranked as a seeded team in the beginning. Now their record would greatly depend on the drawing result since they didn’t know whether their opponents were powerful or not.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
