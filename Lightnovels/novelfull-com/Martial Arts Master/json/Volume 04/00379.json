They had been in love before, and were now like a long-time couple, so why should they even care about this?</p><p>Cheng had been dating Yan Zheke for more than a year and was still full of enthusiasm. No wonder he started exercising at 5:30 AM every morning regardless of the weather.</p><p>“He made himself the enemy of every man!” whispered Sun Jian.</p><p>Meanwhile, he turned to the other members of the Martial Arts Club, trying to evoke an echo.</p><p>However, after looking around, he sadly found that everyone was indifferent to it. He could even read their minds.</p><p>Li Mao: <em>“Excuse me, I am not in a relationship…”</em></p><p>Wang Dali: <em>“Me neither…”</em></p><p>Lin Que: <em>“What is a girlfriend?”</em></p><p>Coach Shi: <em>“My wife passed away long ago… “</em></p><p>Cai Zongming: <em>“I have a girlfriend but she is not here to see the public affection displayed by Cheng… “</em></p><p>“Well… ” Sun Jian covered his face and sighed.</p><p>Carrying Yan Zheke on his back, Lou Cheng passed the hall quietly on his tiptoes. They took the lift to her room. Lou Cheng opened her bag that he knew well, took out the room card, and opened the door.</p><p>Groping for the bed, Lou Cheng lowered his head and bent backwards, putting Yan Zheke down on the bed slowly. He then fetched the quilt and tucked her in.</p><p>Lou Cheng stretched his body and controlled his Tremor force, massaging Yan Zheke’s arms, thighs, and lower legs so as to ease the soreness.</p><p>Then he squatted down and took off Yan Zheke’s shoes and socks to give her feet a relaxing massage. Afterwards, he covered her feet with the quilt.</p><p>Finally, Lou Cheng came to the head of the bed, bent down and kissed Yan Zheke on her lips, saying in a low voice,</p><p>“Good night.”</p><p>After drawing the curtains and turning off the light, Lou Cheng closed the door without any sound and left the room quietly.</p><p>The room was awfully quiet and dark, except for the little light that came in through the curtains, which made the room tranquil.</p><p>Breathing evenly, Yan Zheke suddenly opened her left eye and looked around before getting up and gazing at the door.</p><p>“You are such an idiot, Cheng. Good night,” she said to herself, filled with joy.</p><p>As a girl with self-discipline, she woke up when the bus stopped. She was not sleeping on Lou Cheng’s back, she was just pretending to be asleep and enjoyed the tender care from her boyfriend.</p><p>Ding! A new message came in on her phone.</p><p>Err… Yan Zheke picked up her phone and saw Lou Cheng’s smiling face on the screen. He said, “Beauty, it’s time to get up and brush your teeth.”</p><p>“You! You knew I was awake the whole time?” Yan Zheke was shocked stiff.</p><p>“The heartbeat and other body functions are different when you are asleep,” said Lou Cheng. “I can easily perceive your body signals with my Listening Skill and Ice Mirror.”</p><p>Yan Zheke made a wry smile, saying, “I cannot pretend to sleep from now on? Your ability kills all the fun!”</p><p>“No. I could play the fool as I did a moment ago.” Lou Cheng was delighted.</p><p>“…I don’t want to talk anymore.” Yan Zheke turned sideways, hit the pillow, and then she held it in her arms with a broad smile on her face.</p><p>Lou Cheng was already in his own room, sitting on his bed and resting on a cushion when he typed, “Okay, stop talking and kiss me!”</p><p>“Nonsense!” Yan Zheke suddenly remembered that she had something to ask. “Cheng, may I ask you something?”</p><p>“Sure. What is it?” Lou Cheng found his girlfriend extremely curious.</p><p>“What is your type?” Yan Zheke sent an emoji of a pensive look. “Dirty Tong goes crazy over the collarbone, others love long hair. What about you?”</p><p>“Me? I’m addicted to my little fairy,” answered Lou Cheng without hesitation.</p><p><em>I knew it!</em> Yan Zheke puckered up her lips and her dimples surfaced in her cheeks as she replied, “I am afraid that answer is too vague. Relax, I am not trying to trick you.”</p><p>“I mean it. Your eyes, nose and lips, ears and earlobes, neck and collarbone, I’m addicted to them all. I also like…” Lou Cheng felt a subtle lust while talking about the subject.</p><p>“Stop! It’s getting erotic!” said Yan Zheke with a blushing face.</p><p>“Alright. What do you think I love most?” Lou Cheng restrained himself from rushing to her room to do something.</p><p>Yan Zheke sent an emoji of a detective. “When I wear a skirt, you glance at my legs a lot, covertly sometimes. Plus, you acted weird when you gave me a foot massage. You are obsessed with my legs and feet, aren’t you?”</p><p><em>“Oh… Did she notice? Or is it a woman’s intuition?”</em> Lou Cheng felt a sense of shame while saying, “A little bit… And I already told you that I love every part of your body… ”</p><p>“Don’t. Save it. Well, I need to brush my teeth and go to bed now. Good night!” Yan Zheke did not care, because Li Liantong had taught her that it was entirely normal. Actually, Yan Zheke was glad to know Lou Cheng’s secret. She got out of the bed and ran to the bathroom.</p><p>They said goodnight to each other. Yan Zheke was exhausted and fell asleep immediately. Lou Cheng, on the other hand, still had time to browse the web forum and Weibo, enjoying the compliments and expectations for the Martial Arts Club.</p><p>Meanwhile, he also checked the Longhu Club web forum.</p><p>Since Lou Cheng was busy practicing martial arts, dating, and studying, he skimmed through the news to keep up with the real world, but rarely posted any comments.</p><p>In the last year or so, some disputes took place on the Longhu Club forum. For instance, Sun, who loved to post her selfies and won a swarm of followers, was involved in a scandal when her selfies were stolen by others, which caused the anger of the masses. People even doubted whether Sun was a she or a he. Since then, Sun had completely disappeared from the forum.</p><p>Nevertheless, there was no aftereffect. For a month or two, another girl posted her selfies and people praised her. It was as if nothing had happened.</p><p>A web forum reflects all of society in a more concentrated way. Lou Cheng was always an onlooker and rarely commented. Nevertheless, he learned a lot of strange information and extraordinary affairs online.</p><p>After finishing the first page of the forum, Lou Cheng quit the app and went to brush his teeth. When he came back, he received a new message from Qiu Hailin, the Old Ban.</p><p>“Congratulations on your success in entering the next round.”</p><p><em>“As usual, Old Ban’s text is like an official statement… ”</em> Lou Cheng laughed and replied,</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>…</p><p>In the female dormitory of Capital College.</p><p>“He replied! He replied!” Ding Yixin and Du Yiyin gathered around Qiu Hailin, making a big fuss.</p><p>Qiu Hailin had a ponytail, revealing her forehead, and showed a reserved smile.</p><p>“It’s no big deal. We are good friends.”</p><p>…</p><p>In a hotel not far from the martial arts arena in the Capital city, Ann Chaoyang, Piao Yuan, and Xing Jingjing were gathered in Ann’s room, reviewing the match video between Songcheng and Mingdao.</p><p>“Songcheng never fails to surprise us. They already had Lou Cheng, and now there is also Lin Que.” Piao Yuan rubbed his bald head.</p><p>Zhang Dongliang had not fully recovered from his injuries. He frowned and said, “Lou Cheng preserved his real strength. Only 30% of his skills were displayed.”</p><p>“More or less… ” Liu Yuntao, who suffered the same injuries as Zhang Dongliang, answered with a severe face.</p><p>Standing at a distance, Xing Jingjing looked serious.</p><p>Piao Yuan felt elated and said, “Huh, Lou Cheng is like Peng Leyun from two years ago.”</p><p>He displayed an aura of death, formidable and unstoppable!</p><p>Ann Chaoyang winked and smiled.</p><p>“Last year, when Lou Cheng fought Peng Leyun, he was already like Peng Leyun. Since then, Lou Cheng has become a fighter beyond comparison.”</p><p>He had become a serious and honorable fighter!</p><p>…</p><p>Two days later, when Capital and Guangnan made it to the next round, the official Weibo account of the National University Martial Arts Competitions released a post, showing the key matches in the third round.</p><p>On the left side of the post was Ann Chaoyang in a deep blue martial arts suit with a handsome face and bright eyes. He was elegant and refined in gesture. On the right side was Lou Cheng in a white martial arts suit, tall and straight. His well-proportioned features indicated he was a real fighter.</p><p>Besides, there were slogans for each fighter on the post.</p><p>“Once upon a time, he was a champion. After three years of preparation, he has returned to fight!”</p><p>“He’s rising in the new generation like a shooting star and he is here to fight!”</p><p>“A crouching tiger VS a howling wolf.”</p><p>When he saw the post, Lou Cheng’s blood was racing. He almost cried out after reading the last line of the slogan.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
