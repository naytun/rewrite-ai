December 21st.</p><p>In the center of the ring, the referee announced loudly,</p><p>“Competition between Shanbei University Martial Arts Club and Songcheng University Martial Arts Club, round one.”</p><p>“Fang Zhirong versus Lin Que!”</p><p>As the voice resounded, Lin Que and Fang Zhirong rose to their feet at the same time as if they had been waiting for a long time.</p><p>Maybe it was out of habit or under the influence of the environment, Lin Que didn’t head directly toward the ring. Instead, he fist-bumped his teammates from left to right, with the crowd cheering.</p><p>When he came to the Coach, Geezer Shi, he coughed. He was not excited like the young people and spoke only one word.</p><p>“Easy.”</p><p>Easy… Lin Que repeated the word silently, a bit of a glint in his dark eyes.</p><p>He turned and left the seats. He stepped up the stone stairs along the path of the defending champion. Horns blared out an incessant and deafening sound, welcoming Fang Zhirong to the ring.</p><p>Fang Zhirong was a small shy boy of average height with fine, delicate features. His eyes were wild as if a proud, sharp soul was hidden deep within his body.</p><p>Standing to the right of the referee, he looked sharply at Lin Que, eyes burning with eagerness for the fight.</p><p>Not giving any impression of weakness, Lin Que stared back at him, eyes burning.</p><p>To be able to defeat a professional opponent was what every fighter wanted and dreamt about!</p><p>Seeing such scene on the ring, the presenters couldn’t help but say,</p><p>“Last September, they were both highly respected talented fighters, but they’ve never played against each other. One is overshadowed by Peng Leyun while the other was overtaken by Lou Cheng and a miracle gave a dull gray tinge to his everything. Both have had some losses and frustrations. Today, this fight must have a winner and a loser. Well, a tie cannot be ruled out. All in all, the winner will regain his glory while the loser will fall into depression and suffer greater frustrations and pressures. Elder Zhang, who do you favor?”</p><p>“It’s hard to say.” Zhang He shook his head, not giving a judgment. “It has been only a few months since they’ve entered the Dan stage. Both are making astonishing progress now. How many Fighting Sect moves has Lin Que acquired? Has there been any significant breakthrough in his ‘Meteor force’? What Fang Zhirong has learned from the damaged Dark Sect, Plague Sect and Magnetism Sect still remain unknown to the outside. That’s to say, they know little about each other. This game will be full of changes.”</p><p>When the presenter started chatting with guests, the referee looked to his left and right, then stretched out his hand, announcing,</p><p>“The talk time starts.”</p><p>Fang Zhirong smiled shyly, but his eyes were burning with aggression. He said,</p><p>“When I was still a freshman in university, I often heard your name and people always compare me with you. I thought it was somewhat inevitable that I would play against you. But the club manager awoke the supernatural ability, ‘Corvine Mouth’, so I lost the chance. But now, I can play you finally!”</p><p>At this point, without hesitation and showing no modesty or courtesy, he said,</p><p>“We’ll see who is stronger, who is more in name than in reality!”</p><p>“We’ll see who is the favored fighter of the age!”</p><p>“I’ve been waiting for this day since August. Waiting for this fight to prove myself!”</p><p>Hearing his provocative and irritating words, Lin Que did not even blink. He stood silently with a poker-face, preparing and calculating.</p><p>Knowing Lin Que’s usual behavior, Fang Zhirong didn’t care much. After speaking his mind, he felt relieved. It had adjusted his body slightly, shifting the local magnetic field and lifting his spirit towards a climax.</p><p>As the talk time was about to end, Lin Que opened his mouth, and replied in a cold voice,</p><p>“Unfortunately, you’re not Peng Leyun.”</p><p>Unfortunately, you’re not Peng Leyun… You mean I’m not qualified? Am I still a long way from Peng Leyun? The last thing he wanted to admit was that Peng Leyun was better. So he raged with a sense of inferiority hidden deep in his heart, just like a wildcat whose tail had been stepped on with it’s pupils constricted and hackles rising, ready to attack the opponent and rip him up.</p><p>Sooner or later, I’ll defeat Peng Leyun. Sooner or later, I’ll exceed him!</p><p><em>And it begins with you!</em></p><p>Fang Zhirong was still thinking and suppressed his emotion, the referee raised his right hand and sliced the air with a snap, saying,</p><p>“Begin!”</p><p>Lin Que was incredibly perceptive when it came to grasping the psychology of the opponent and using time wisely, proving himself a top student in the School of Psychology.</p><p>However, when it comes to psychology, even the best doctor can’t cure himself, and also has resistance to other’s treatment.</p><p>With a pang of rage, Fang Zhirong arched his back, winding his way near the ground and came to the opponent. So fast and so strange was his footwork that no one could predict where he would place his feet.</p><p>Although Lou Cheng’s footwork was excellent, it was not as good as Fang Zhirong’s.</p><p>Despite the fury, Fang Zhirong was still a battle-hardened fighter. He’d seen the last couple of Lin Que’s games and was impressed by his Blitzkrieg by taking advantage of the Dan Stage, so he didn’t even give him a chance to use it.</p><p>Unruffled, Lin Que didn’t start aggressively. With control he moved his muscles and fascia, walked in Yu Step, and came to Fang Zhirong, facing his attack without dodging.</p><p>The wind blew in the ring. Both walked around and past each other, seeking and waiting for the right time to attack. However, such a moment was always covered by the opponent when it occurred. Therefore, they didn’t touch for about ten seconds. It was as if they were performing a dance.</p><p>As the old saying goes, “the insider knows the ropes, while the outsider just comes along for the ride.” While the audience was a little upset because they saw no hand-to-hand combat, Lou Cheng merely watched attentively.</p><p>There was a clear divide in the footwork between Lin Que and Fang Zhirong. One had smart turns and moved like a shooting star, attempting to win by speed and adroitness; the other turned and twisted, unpredictable and tricky like a ghost in the night.</p><p>Of course, both of them didn’t get anywhere in this aspect and were not as strong as Qiu Lin. The girl had gotten herself to a “Lotus Step, Thundercloud Movement” realm by practicing her family moves.</p><p>Lin Que had brought his Yu Step to the level of “To Tread Dubhe and Alkaid”. Among every step, he was escorted by the “Dubhe Wind” and rapid crackle which was roughly comparable.</p><p>As they wheeled around for a while and got closer, Lin Que and Fang Zhirong took their opportunity at almost the same time. Before they could use strength and explode “Dan Qi”, one moved his shoulder, swung his forearms rapidly, and threw lightning-fast punches; the other pumped up his back, slid forward, and punched as quick as illusions in the night.</p><p>BANG!</p><p>Both were intercepted by each other. The two punches collided in the air, making the first thudding noise since the beginning of the game.</p><p>Seeing the two punches stop in midair, Fang Zhirong moved his elbow joint magically as if it was dislocated. He raised his forearm like a poisonous snake. It climbed up Lin Que’s arm with his five fingers spreading and snatched at his arm, strong, fast and accurate.</p><p>At this moment, Fang Zhirong’ fingers with their slight black overtones looked like poisonous fangs, about to inject the deathly substance into Lin Que’s body.</p><p>Dark Sect, “Dark Poison Force”!</p><p>This force, also called “Plague Poison Force” initially came from the Plague Sect and had been acquired by the founder of “Dark Infinite Sutra”. He integrated it into what he had learned, making it one of the core forces in the Dark Sect. Compared to the original, it was less toxic but trickier to execute. If Lin Que was hit by this force, he would be poisoned unless he stopped it with an explosion of force.</p><p>Considering Fang Zhirong’s current ability, his “Dark Poison Force” wouldn’t be a fatal blow to Lin Que. But at least it would make him suffer all kinds of effects. It would cause dizziness, difficulty breathing and weaken him considerably. “Poison” would accumulate over time and Lin Que would eventually fail to endure it.</p><p>Just like sharp teeth, his fingers were about to bite, too fast to avoid.</p><p>Immediately, Lin Que’s arm muscle tightened and contracted inward, so close to the bone that Fang Zhirong’s “Poison teeth” missed its target and hit the air.</p><p>This tightening and contraction were not normal, but performed through Lin Que’s “Force Concentration”!</p><p>Almost immediately, instead of attempting to snatch at his opponent’s wrist, he erupted Dan Qi, and pressed his left foot hard against the ground.</p><p>The 16th move of the Fighting Sect, Earth Cracking!</p><p>BANG!</p><p>The sound burst out from the ring. The ground under Fang Zhirong cracked suddenly and a force rushed up like a volcanic eruption.</p><p>Lin Que had made a lot progress in this move!</p><p>With an acute pain in his feet, he couldn’t help but withdraw his leg. He lost his balance and his body jolted.</p><p>During this process, he put his right hand up and, spreading his fingers, he let go of Lin Que’s arm, failing to grasp him again or inject the poison.</p><p>Eyes flaring, Lin Que seized the chance and started serial moves!</p><p>Fang Zhirong neither dodged nor avoided footwork as his body shook. He didn’t use Force Concentration or make his qi and blood flow back to steady himself and resist the attack. As he staggered, he shifted his weight, moved his shoulder and threw his right hand, aiming at Lin Que’s arm with the back of his hand before Lin Que could withdraw it back.</p><p>As he visualized in his mind, the black tone around his fingers disappeared quickly and a bluish color appeared around his hand.</p><p>BAM!</p><p>Lin Que was about to attack when the back of Fang Zhirong’s hand grazed his forearm. He had no time to avoid it. It was as if he’d been fractured and hit squarely on the chin. He felt unbelievably sharp pain and everything went black.</p><p>Just a graze could deliver such strong pain!</p><p>Plague Sect, Move 27, Scorpion Tail Needle!</p><p>Fang Zhirong’s effort in these last few months had paid off. He had acquired not only Force but also two unique moves!</p><p>This blow hadn’t used the poison of the “Dark Poison Force” to its full power, but it could generate an unusually irritating and painful feeling and affect the opponent considerably!</p><p>Despite the extreme pain, Lin Que’s right hand hadn’t actually been injured, but it hurt every time he attempted a force. It felt as if his hand was broken.</p><p>At this moment, Fang Zhirong staggered and retreated a few steps.</p><p>Lin Que knew that this thrill could be soothed by contracting qi and blood, Force and Spirit. But it meant a waste of a chance to use Dan stage explosion. So he gritted his teeth and bore the pain, with resilience.</p><p>His face turned pale, and he had cold sweat on his forehead.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
