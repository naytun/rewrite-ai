I have nothing to do with it. (shrugging emoji) Instead, you should kneel down in front of my master, Coach Shi of the Martial Arts Club. He’s actually the junior brother of the master of Mo Jingting’s master.”</p><p>He explained the origin of their relationship with a tongue twister.</p><p>Qiu Zhigao texted him again with a ‘blinking eyes’ emoji before Lou Cheng could close the dialog box. “Is she, is she as beautiful as she looks on the television?”</p><p>Some popular stars were actually ugly in real life.</p><p>“Do you, a strong man, know how disgusting it is to see you using that emoji with such a soft tone?” Lou Cheng replied with a “vomiting” emoji as they usually did in their dorm. Then he added, “Not too bad, pretty close to her usual appearance.”</p><p>Mo Jingting was an energetic young girl in her prime, so she didn’t need makeup.</p><p>“What’s her real personality like?” Old Qiu continued to ask questions, ignoring what Lou Cheng had just said.</p><p>After thinking for a while, Lou Cheng began typing quickly, “She’s quite outgoing.”</p><p>Of course, she was also calculating and capable, but Old Qiu didn’t need to know that since he wouldn’t be in contact with Mo Jingting. It was fine to let Old Qiu’s keep his good impression of her.</p><p>Besides, he didn’t want to gossip about her, and Old Qiu was not someone Lou Cheng would share all of his thoughts with.</p><p>“So, in reality, she is the same as she is on the television?” Qiu Zhigao replied excitedly.</p><p>Lou Cheng ignored him and closed the dialogue box to check Qin Mo’s message. He sent a “giggling” emoji and replied, “As the saying goes, sometimes it’s better to admire someone from a distance instead of ruining it by approaching them. Why not hold onto your fantasy, since reality is usually disappointing?”</p><p>He declined Qin Mo’s request to meet Mo Jingting. On one hand, it was not polite for him to bring Qin Mo without asking Mo Jingting for permission. On the other hand, he didn’t want to owe her a favor for asking her to meet his friends.</p><p>“Could you say something I understand? Do you mean the real Mo Jingting will let me down? Just answer my question, is she as beautiful as she looks on television? Are her eyes still as attractive? Is she still good at acting cute?” Qin Mo asked.</p><p>“These descriptions quite suit her.” Lou Cheng said honestly, “But in the other aspects… ”</p><p>“I don’t care about the other aspects since I have no chance of marrying her! She’s just my ideal, so I don’t care too much about the other things. It seems I won’t be disappointed!” Qin Mo replied with a “despise” emoji.</p><p>“You beast… ” Lou Cheng was actually speechless.</p><p>You are not a qualified fan!</p><p>…</p><p>At half past nine that night, after sending Yan Zheke back to her dormitory, Lou Cheng went back to his room in the No.7 dormitory while thinking about his plans for Zheke’s birthday.</p><p>Pushing the door open, he saw Qiu Zhigao and Qin Mo sitting on the sofa with the Martial Arts Competition broadcasting on the television.</p><p>“You aren’t playing online games?” Lou Cheng was surprised and asked casually.</p><p>Qin Mo gave him a big smile while pushing up his gold-rimmed spectacles. “I felt too tired and hungry to play the game. Cheng, would you like to have a midnight snack with me? Barbecue, it’s my treat!”</p><p>Though the cafeteria and restaurants on the campus were all closed at this time, there was a night market nearby and most of the students had a takeaway app on their cell phone. Besides, the new campus area of Songcheng University was separated from the outside with the iron railing instead of the wall, and the lunch box could easily be passed through the railing gap.</p><p>But lunch boxes containing many different items were still too big to be passed through the gap. Once a student ordered some pickled vegetables with fish that counted dozens of yuan, but the restaurant packed it in a super-sized plastic bowl, which brought trouble to the delivery person because it wouldn’t fit through the railing gap. That poor student wanted the food so badly he might have tried to eat through the railing like a prisoner.</p><p>Fortunately, the story had a happy ending. That deliveryman was an amateur martial artist and quickly climbed over the railing with the lunch box without even spilling a drop of the soup. From then on, all the students learned a good lesson, it was good for them to know martial arts!</p><p>“No, eating this late would affect the quality of sleep.” Lou Cheng refused politely.</p><p>“Okay, we’re going to eat while you stay in the dorm,” Qiu Zhigao said and smiled, “I’ve fetched some hot water for you so you won’t need to do it yourself.”</p><p>“Don’t act like this. You must want something from me!” Lou Cheng questioned him jokingly instead of replying politely.</p><p>“I just want to share the honor of the junior master.” Qin Mo joked.</p><p>“Cheng, I don’t want you to do anything difficult. Just ask her for some autographs.” Old Qiu begged shamelessly.</p><p>“Okay, okay, if I get the opportunity,” Lou Cheng said, and then shook his head, feeling it ridiculous.</p><p>I’m also a famous Weibo user, why don’t you fawn over me!</p><p>…</p><p>After Lou Cheng finished his lessons the next afternoon, he received a message from Mo Jingting.</p><p>“Junior master, I’m on the bus heading to your school~”</p><p>“Okay, we will meet you at the bus station.” Lou Cheng replied, stressing the word “we” and immediately telling Yan Zheke.</p><p>Yan Zheke replied with a lovely-sitting emoji. “I’m now in my dorm getting dressed. Just come and wait for me outside of the building.”</p><p>“What? Why not ask me to wait on the Long Bridge?” Lou Cheng found it interesting and soon replied, “Okay!”</p><p>It seems that Ke takes it seriously if she even went back to dress up…</p><p>Er, she once said that girls would always take it more seriously when they were going to see the other girls…</p><p>After more than twenty minutes, Lou Cheng, who was waiting outside of the No.3 dormitory finally saw his fairy.</p><p>Yan Zheke put on simple make-up this time and dressed like a gentle and delicate girl. Lou Cheng immediately lost himself in her elegant and refined beauty.</p><p>“What are you staring at? Let’s go.” Yan Zheke complained softly.</p><p>Turning his gaze, Lou Cheng took the girl’s hand in his and smiled while saying, “I’m staring at my fairy~”</p><p>Though he saw Zheke every day, he was still stunned by her beauty just now. What a pity that she seldom takes their dates seriously.</p><p>“Hum!” Yan Zheke turned her gaze up while lifting the corners of her mouth without saying anything.</p><p>On the way to the bus station, there were many people attracted by Yan Zheke and even the winter dusk was lit up by her gorgeous appearance.</p><p>Not long after they arrived at the bus station, they saw Mo Jingting getting off a bus.</p><p>She was wearing sunglasses that covered almost half of her face, which made her noticeable at sunset. She seemed to have spent time dressing up, stressing her tall figure, long legs, and plump lips that were sparkling like rubies.</p><p>Mo Jingting noticed Yan Zheke before getting off the bus and was also stunned by Yan Zheke’s beauty, even though Mo Jingting was also a girl.</p><p>Compared with Mo Jingting, Yan Zheke behaved much more calmly since she had seen Mo Jingting dressed up on television many times in the past. She only felt a little jealous of Mo Jingting’s height while greeting her with a polite smile.</p><p>When the two girls made eye contact, Lou Cheng felt as if he could see sparks flying out in all directions.</p><p>“Let’s go to the restaurant first. This isn’t a good place to chat.” He took a step forward and said.</p><p>The passing students watched as Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke walked by, hand in hand, while Mo Jingting was following them behind, looking at their hands.</p><p>After seating themselves in a box in the Academy Cafeteria, they waited for the dishes to be served. Mo Jingting took off her sunglass and looked at the couple in front of her with her misty eyes, which were always filled with emotions. “Junior master’s girlfriend is so beautiful. No wonder he never spares a look for other girls. What should I call you? Junior aunt? It sounds like a middle-aged woman.”</p><p>“Yan Zheke, just call me Zheke,” said Zheke, smiling gently to show her dimples.</p><p>“Are you a disciple of Shushan Study?” Mo Jingting asked curiously while supporting her chin with one hand.</p><p>“I am, but how did you know?” Yan Zheke said, surprised.</p><p>My surname is Yan and my birthplace in the household register is Xiushan. Though I’m able to use Yin-yang Twist, no one could identify it. Has she investigated my data in school? But it should still be hard for her to associate me with Shushan Study.</p><p>Mo Jingting glanced over at Lou Cheng with a smile and said, “Junior master mentioned something about you.”</p><p>“I didn’t mention anything!” Lou Cheng blurted out to clarify it before Yan Zheke turned her gaze toward him.</p><p>“Normally people would think about whether they have said it before defending themselves. Junior master’s reaction was quite unexpected!” Mo Jingting noticed the situation was slipping out of her control.</p><p>“Are you sure you didn’t mention it? Maybe you just forgot?” Yan Zheke looked at her boyfriend with her lips tilted.</p><p>Lou Cheng coughed and said, “It was my master. Our conversation at the time left a deep impression on me and I suddenly recall it. He said I need not join Wuyue Club since he would be even happier to see me be a special coach in Longhu Club or marry into Shushan Study.”</p><p>He repeated Geezer Shi’s words deliberately to amuse his fairy.</p><p>“Haha… marry into Shushan Study… it sounds like you are going to marry my brother… ” Yan Zheke burst out laughing with a flush face and watery eyes. She had intended to make a joke and change the topic, but the new topic seemed to be more interesting. She even began trembling from the humor.</p><p>So funny!</p><p>While Yan Zheke and Lou Cheng began showing off their relationship, totally ignoring Mo Jingting, the latter picked up the teacup to take a drink, feeling a little miserable.</p><p>“I should not have come here…” She thought helplessly. She realized at the same time that she had done something wrong, and that was why Lou Cheng was being distant.</p><p>They were passionately in love and no one else was able to disturb them. Her flirting with Lou Cheng could only make him unhappy. The more she fawned over him, the more he would avoid her…</p><p>She should have tried simpler methods since she didn’t really want to flirt with Lou Cheng. It might be better for her to really be his junior niece…</p><p>Having changed her mind, Mo Jingting immediately changed her attitude and began talking with Yan Zheke actively instead of focusing on Lou Cheng.</p><p>Though Mo Jingting might still be more immature and less rational than Yan Zheke, she had still spent several years in showbiz. So she had a lot of experience as a social butterfly. When she switched topics to the other stars’ secrets, both Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke let down their guards a little and began listening to her. Finally, the dinner ended in harmony.</p><p>This was gossip from a star instead of an entertainment journalist!</p><p>Everyone likes to gossip to some extent!</p><p>“I can’t believe they told everyone his secret… ” Yan Zheke was astonished by what she just heard about a certain male star.</p><p>“Bisexuals are quite normal in showbiz, and we are even used to the dirty deeds. You’ll seem like an alien if you get excited over everything,” Mo Jingting said while sighing with emotion, “If I didn’t have a sect background from an influential sect, I might have joined in their evil deeds while under such a pressure.”</p><p>She dared not to ask for a promise from Lou Cheng but she kept looking at the two in front eagerly, hoping what she said would leave an impression on them. If she ran into trouble someday, she might be able to ask her junior uncle for help once he reached high-ranked Dan Stage or even reached Physical Invulnerability and possessed a powerful voice in the Sect.</p><p>As expected, Lou Cheng only sighed at the chaos in the showbiz instead of making any promises casually.</p><p>Tidying up her mood, Mo Jingting went on talking about something interesting while suffering through the couple’s romance.</p><p>When they were about to leave, she took several tickets out of her purse and gave them to Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke.</p><p>“Junior master, Zheke, these are VIP tickets to my vocal concert… ”</p><p>Covering her smile with one hand, she added to explain, “You are not in our circle and might feel uncomfortable being in the area for special guests, besides, you wouldn’t get to enjoy your date there. So I decided to give you some good seats instead.”</p><p>“Thank you. Two tickets are enough for us since the others already have their own.” Lou Cheng said politely.</p><p>“Junior master, you are my elder and needn’t say thank you to me.” Mo Jingting said jokingly, “The others? Are some of your friends my fans?”</p><p>“Quite a lot.” Lou Cheng said, taking the opportunity to ask for Mo Jingting’s signature for Old Qiu and Qin Mo.</p><p>Smiling happily, Mo Jingting took out her memo pad, tore off two sheets of paper, and signed them for Qin Mo and Qiu Zhigao.</p><p>“It’s much more beautiful than your signature~” Yan Zheke teased Lou Cheng.</p><p>“I’m not relying on it to make a living.” Lou Cheng replied with a smile and called a waiter to compute the bill after Mo Jingting had put on another pair of glasses.</p><p>After sending this big star, who had changed her attitude, to the school bus and waving her off, Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke exchanged a look and sighed in relief.</p><p>“It’s more tiring than a match~” Yan Zheke said and sighed from exhaustion.</p><p>The secret war between two girls…</p><p>“Shall I knead your temples?” Lou Cheng suggested with a smile, “She learned to behave herself in front of you, so it’s good.”</p><p>“Yeah, she’s a clever girl… ” Yan Zheke replied and nodded to herself.</p><p>After chatting for a while, they moved to a nearby bench. When Yan Zheke took out several tissues, Lou Cheng took them and wiped the bench surface like it was second nature.</p><p>“How many tickets in total?” Yan Zheke asked casually.</p><p>While kneading her temples, Lou Cheng thought for a while and then answered, “Four. Two for us and two extra. Ask your roommates if they want to go to the concert? Both Old Qiu and The Beast already have tickets.”</p><p>“Okay.” Yan Zheke took out her cell phone to call Li Liantong and others.</p><p>Li Liantong said she wanted to go but she had an important lesson Tuesday evening, and so did Shi Xiangyang. Thus they missed the chance to attend the first day’s vocal concert.</p><p>As for Zong Yanru, she disliked Mo Jingting and didn’t want to go to the concert.</p><p>“None of them are coming… Just give them to Old Qiu and Qin Mo since these seats should be better than theirs, or maybe you can give the tickets to Talker?” Yan Zheke suggested.</p><p>“Okay.” Lou Cheng began imagining Old Qiu’s expression of gratitude.</p><p>…</p><p>On the school bus, Mo Jingting withdrew her smile and calmed down, losing herself in thought.</p><p>She searched for Yan Zheke’s name using her cell phone and then asked one of her friends in the martial arts circle, “Do you know which elder in Shushan Study is Yan Zheke’s master?”</p><p>“Yan Zheke? Yan? I’ve never heard of that surname in Shushan Study. I’ll ask around… ” That friend also knew little about it.</p><p>After several minutes, he replied in a serious tone, “She was the granddaughter of two grandmasters in Shushan Study, Ji Jianzhang, the Heaven Leaning Sword, and Dou Ning, the Seven Star.”</p><p>“Heaven Leaning Sword”? “Seven Star”? Mo Jingting couldn’t stop her wrist from trembling and dropped the cell phone.</p><p>…</p><p>After taking a walk along the lakeside, Lou Cheng brought Yan Zheke back to her No.3 dormitory and then came back to his own dorm in a good mood. Qin Mo and Old Qiu were in the room discussing the vocal concert tomorrow night.</p><p>“Here you are, the signatures you wanted,” Lou Cheng said, smiling while giving them the two sheets of paper.</p><p>“Signature?” Old Qiu took the paper and was immediately stunned, “You got Jingting’s signature so quickly?”</p><p>Qin Mo was able to read between the lines, getting even more surprised he asked, “You met her?”</p><p>Otherwise, you couldn’t get her signature on such short notice.</p><p>“She’s my martial niece and I should treat her since she came to Songcheng. Ke and I just had dinner with her.” Lou Cheng replied frankly.</p><p>“Brother Cheng, how could you forget to bring me?” Qin Mo pretended to be depressed while Qiu Zhigao’s facial expression was also a mixture of surprise and regret.</p><p>I had a chance to meet my goddess and I missed it!</p><p>“She didn’t want to be bothered.” Lou Cheng naturally blamed Mo Jingting and then took the opportunity to give them the remaining two VIP tickets. “She sent the tickets to me. Just take them since the seats are better than yours.”</p><p>“Well, well, I’ll not stand on ceremony! I owe you a kowtow!” Qiu Zhigao said and took the ticket without hesitation.</p><p>Qin Mo was also overjoyed but soon turned angry. “I wouldn’t have been extorted by that ticket scalper if I knew it earlier! Do you know how much he asked for the ticket? Do you know how much?”</p><p>It was not because of the money but a point of honor!</p><p>“I don’t want to know how much.” Lou Cheng said, and then burst out laughing, “Maybe you can give your original tickets to Talker and Qiang if they want to go.”</p><p>…</p><p>Tuesday soon came. At dusk, Lou Cheng got a certificate under the name of his club and bought bus tickets to their old campus. Then he left for Mo Jingting’s vocal concert with Yan Zheke, Qiu Zhigao, Qin Mo, Zhao Qiang and Cai Zongming.</p><p>“Skipping class is a rare experience… ” Yan Zheke sighed with both regret and excitement while watching the school buildings disappear outside the bus window.</p><p>She was corrupted by Cheng!</p><p>Lou Cheng leaned over to put his arms around Yan Zheke’s waist. “The teacher will definitely discover you skipped class.” he told her deliberately, “Everyone including the teacher will notice the missing beauty in the classroom. But the teacher may not remember me since I’m plain looking.”</p><p>It’s the disadvantage of beauty!</p><p>“You!” Yan Zheke hit him softly, “I’m not stupid~ I’ve already asked for leave, so you don’t need to worry about it, thank you!”</p><p>Ru helped her ask for leave and she believed the teacher would allow it since she wasn’t skipping a professional lesson.</p><p>It was the advantage of beauty!</p><p>…</p><p>There were many people waiting outside Songcheng Martial Arts Gymnasium, including the peddlers selling tickets, flowers, and light sticks.</p><p>It was the second time Yan Zheke went to a concert, so she was still excited. While looking around and walking up and down, she acted like a child who was eager to stop and visit every stand.</p><p>“Cheng, Cheng, let’s buy some light sticks. We should wave them during the concert.”</p><p>“Cheng, Cheng, that pie looks delicious.”</p><p>“Cheng, Cheng, just follow me. I won’t bother to look for you if you get lost!”</p><p>…</p><p>Looking at Yan Zheke with a big smile, Lou Cheng took her swinging hand in his and tried all the different kinds of junk food with her.</p><p>It was not the concert but their date that was important!</p><p>When it was time for them to enter the gymnasium, a flower boy approached them and yelled, “Brother, brother, buy a bunch of flowers for her, she’s so beautiful!”</p><p>Lou Cheng was immediately moved by his words and intended to buy some flowers.</p><p>Yan Zheke pursed her lips and turned over her hands to grasp Lou Cheng’s wrist.</p><p>“Don’t do this. I don’t like flowers and we’d better hurry to enter the gymnasium. Let’s go over there~”</p><p>Lou Cheng gave up taking out his wallet because of coach Yan’s persistence. When they rushed forward and left the flower boy behind, he whispered, “What’s wrong with that? Though the flowers were a little expensive, what he said was right. You are so beautiful and deserve to be decorated with flowers.”</p><p>Yan Zheke explained while puffing out her cheeks.</p><p>“You men are all vain creatures who want to show off your money in front of women and regard yourselves as real heroes. Those flower sellers are just taking advantage of it… Hum, I don’t like seeing someone take you for a fool!”</p><p>She was acting like a female tiger protecting her kids, which warmed Lou Cheng’s heart and widened his smiling mouth.</p><p>Mo Jingting kept behaving herself during the vocal concert, acting as good as she could as a singer. Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke were familiar with quite a lot of her songs and would sing to her occasionally while waving their light sticks. They even made some videos as souvenirs.</p><p>They were enjoying themselves.</p><p>“Hey, your face seems larger and my face seems smaller when we take photos together~” Yan Zheke said as they left the gymnasium. Yan Zheke was reviewing the photos they took just now while breathing the cold air at night.</p><p>“Your face is originally small.” Lou Cheng covered Yan Zheke’s face with his hand for comparison.</p><p>Looking around, he coughed and said,</p><p>“It’s late and we’ve already missed the last bus. Old Qiu said they are going to sleep at Qin Mo’s home tonight.”</p><p>Shall we also stay outside school tonight?</p><p>He had been considering and expecting this since they decided to come to the vocal concert…</p><p>“Yeah.” Yan Zheke nodded like a chick picking grain, “Let’s order a special car online.”</p><p>“What? What an unexpected answer it is?” Lou Cheng was stunned.</p><p>Ke, your answer didn’t make any sense!</p><p>“What’s wrong with you? There’s still enough time for us to get back to school before lights out.” Yan Zheke blinked her clear eyes with a naive expression.</p><p>“O, Okay.” Lou Cheng put a stop to all his distracting thoughts and began finding a special car online. Actually, he was complaining in his mind.</p><p>I hate online car-hailing!</p><p>Though there are many people waiting for taxis after the concert, and though Lou Cheng was praying that no taxi driver would answer his order and ruin his night, coach Yan was a lucky girl and a driver took their order after several minutes.</p><p>He would make more money this time since the school campus area of Songcheng University was far away!</p><p>“What shall we do? I’m so excited imagining us climbing over the school wall~” While waiting for the taxi, Yan Zheke put both hands in Lou Cheng’s and smiled excitedly.</p><p>I haven’t done something like this before!</p><p>Looking at her flushing cheeks and blinking eyes, Lou Cheng immediately forgot all the depression and replied with a smile,</p><p>“We’re the Naughty Duo!”</p><p>It seemed to be quite interesting, teaching his fairy to be a little mischievous.</p><p>…</p><p>There was no rush hour at night and the taxi stopped half an hour later. In the moonlight, Lou Cheng led Yan Zheke while they searched for the camera’s blind angle.</p><p>He laughed in front of the tall railing and then said,</p><p>“I’ll climb up first and then pull you up.”</p><p>“Okay!” Yan Zheke nodded seriously with glittering eyes.</p><p>Supporting his body with one hand and gathering strength to both feet, he suddenly jumped up and landed on top of the railing steadily.</p><p>Then he bent to grasp Yan Zheke’s hands and pulled her as she jumped towards him.</p><p>Yang Zheke felt her bodying flying in the air for a short moment before landing on the railing, which made her eyes brighten.</p><p>“It’s so much fun~!”</p><p>She began walking back and forth on the railing while balancing herself with both arms, seemingly shaky but actually steady.</p><p>Lou Cheng followed her with one hand in his pocket. He stared at her beautiful back and black hair, which was glittering in the moonlight, greedily trying to capture this moment in his mind forever.</p><p>Then he stepped heavily on the railing with a smile.</p><p>On the other side, Yan Zheke was about to take another step forward when the railing shook suddenly making her immediately lose balance.</p><p>Instead of screaming out of fear, she activated her backbone and strengthened her muscles unconsciously, intending to straighten herself.</p><p>At this moment, an arm appeared around her waist and pulled her back without much effort. Then she felt a familiar chest.</p><p>“You are always up to mischief… ” Yan Zheke replied. After realizing what had happened, she hit Lou Cheng out of anger, joy, and excitement.</p><p>Before she could finish speaking, she was kissed by Lou Cheng, warmly and tenderly.</p><p>Taking a glance at the ground below, Yan Zheke slowly closed her eyes and hugged Lou Cheng while telling herself it was a dream and she could do anything she wanted.</p><p>A passing cloud blocked the moon temporarily.</p><p>…</p><p>Approaching her dorm at a brisk pace, Yan Zheke stopped outside the door to check if her face was still flush before entering the room.</p><p>“Ke, why do you come back?” Li Liantong turned to look at her in surprise.</p><p>“Why can’t I come back?” Yan Zheke looked at her dumbfounded.</p><p>“You must have missed the last bus after the vocal concert. Hey hey, at this time, a man would suggest relaxing in a nearby hotel and going back to school the next day. Then, he would order two rooms at first but finally remain in the girl’s room shamelessly. He usually says he won’t do anything except sleep with you in his arms… ‘I’ll just touch you but won’t do anything else… ‘” Li Liantong’s topic started turning dirty.</p><p>“Stop!” Yan Zheke interrupted her with flushed face, “Can’t you be more innocent?”</p><p>She suddenly realized that Lou Cheng mentioned Old Qiu’s sleeping outside school deliberately.</p><p>He, he wanted me to stay outside?</p><p>No wonder his reaction was strange then…</p><p>Li Liantong went on to ask her jokingly, “Didn’t your Cheng try? I can’t believe it!”</p><p>“He, he just said there was no bus.” Yan Zheke replied in embarrassment.</p><p>“What? Then how did you reply?” Li Liantong and Shi Xiangyang both asked with great interest.</p><p>“I said, I said, Let’s order a special car… ” Yan Zheke replied and then turned her gaze aside.</p><p>“Order a special car, ha ha ha, what a perfect answer, I admire you so much!” The three listeners all burst out laughing while smacking the bed and table.</p><p>Yan Zheke felt even more embarrassed because of their laughter and began gnashing her teeth secretly.</p><p>I didn’t notice the implied meaning in his words!</p><p>I just wanted to offer a convenient solution!</p><p>Hum, I must have been infected by Cheng and become a stupid Ke!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
