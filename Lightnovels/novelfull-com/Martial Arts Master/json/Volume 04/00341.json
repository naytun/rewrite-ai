This can help you accumulate more experience in an actual match.”</p><p>“Yes, sir!” Yan Zheke responded with a clear and lively voice.</p><p>Geezer Shi looked at Lin Que and said, “You’re second. You should know where your limit is and never exhaust beyond it. Otherwise, you will be affected by the remaining poison force and it may cause damage to your health.”</p><p>He deliberately exaggerated the severe result. Just in case Lin Que decided to treat it carelessly and ignore it.</p><p>Lin Que nodded slightly without showing any expression.</p><p>Geezer Shi gave Lou Cheng a fleeting glance and said,</p><p>“Brat, you also need to take care of yourself.”</p><p>“Yes, Master!” Lou Cheng now held a strong desire to fight in the arena. It had only taken a week to cure his injuries.</p><p>…</p><p>In the host team locker room, after encouraging all the members, Qu Hui glanced at Luo Haize and Yin Xiangxi. He shook his head and said,</p><p>“What a pity! If the strength of Songcheng University’s bench fighters hadn’t improved so much, you two could defeat Lin Que in battle. Provided you two were in peak physical state. Then I would fight Lou Cheng on my own. His injuries haven’t healed yet; it would be easy for me to defeat him.”</p><p>“Songcheng University’s bench fighters have grown quickly. They are not easy targets to be handled quickly.” Yin Xiangxi heaved another sigh.</p><p>At present, Yan Zheke was as strong as a Professional Ninth Pin fighter. Li Mao also approached Ninth Pin. What’s more, Sun Jian, Lin Hua, and Cai Zongming had the strength of Amateur First Pin. It was hard to defeat them.</p><p>Luo Haize agreed with them. “Unless their opponent is you, our club manager.”</p><p>Qu Hui smiled modestly.</p><p>“I have to maintain a relative amount of strength to fight against Lou Cheng, so I can’t consume too much in advance. I’m guessing that Songcheng University will arrange their bench fighters to play first so that they can practice their actual ability; under the condition that their bench fighters are as strong as you. In addition, Lou Cheng’s internal injuries haven’t completely recovered yet. He will certainly be the last player. He’d rather win without fighting us.”</p><p>As he said this, he looked at Yin Xiangxi and said,</p><p>“Li Mao always gets nervous when he is in a match. Although this isn’t a serious problem, he will still be affected by it. Yan Zheke has experienced less actual combat than you and she is a girl; she will be easily rattled when confronted with an accident. What’s more, Sun Jian and Cai Zongming are relatively weaker than you. Also, your playing style can restrain their abilities.</p><p>“So you are the first to fight. If you play more ferociously, you will frighten them. Win the victory as soon as you can!”</p><p>“Okay!” Yin Xiangxi clenched his fist, eager to fight.</p><p>He was famous for his direct and violent attacks. He never defended himself. His courage and good judgment meant he was good at taking chances in a split second. He could scare people easily with his ferocious playing style.</p><p>“In short, you need to cooperate with Haize so as to wear down Lin Que as much as possible. Don’t spend too much energy on him. This is the key to winning this match,” Qu Hui said excitedly.</p><p>…</p><p>The match was about to start. Lou Cheng, Yan Zheke, and the other members followed Geezer Shi. They walked out of the locker room and towards the guest team seats in a line.</p><p>Just then, harsh booing suddenly erupted in the arena full of spectators. The boos lasted for a long time.</p><p>“I wanted to go to the bathroom after hearing their noise.” Talker did not care for their booing and ridiculed them with humor.</p><p>Lou Cheng glared at him and said, “Then you need to check your prostate.”</p><p><em>“Different away-game venue styles are so different from one another! The students in Sanjiang University won’t curse you or attack you, they only boo you!”</em> Lou Cheng thought.</p><p>Little Ming argued with him, “This is a kind of figure of speech. Don’t you understand? You are so illiterate! Haha, hearing those sounds made you want to beat them down until they stopped booing, just like what we did in Yimo, right?”</p><p>“It seems that you have experienced the scene in Yimo,” Lou Cheng replied amused. “In the match with Yimo, we were the weak side who finally defeated the stronger opponent. But we are stronger than our opponents in today’s match. Why should we care so much about them? For the satisfaction that’s gained from hitting infants or the elders? Or bullying primary school students?”</p><p>“Actually, bullying primary school students is very interesting. Really interesting.” Cai Zongming thought for a while and replied to him frankly.</p><p>As they were talking, they arrived at the guest team seats. The members sat down one by one.</p><p>“Cheng, is what you said to Talker what you really feel?” Yan Zheke whispered in Lou Cheng’s ears and asked him with a smile.</p><p>“You know me better than anyone in the world.” Lou Cheng let out a chuckle, “I’m trying to contempt them in a strategic way while focusing on fighting tactics. Qu Hui has entered the Dan stage. Also, he has made great progress with his improved supernatural flying ability, compared to his previous strength. Since he’s defeated Eighth Pin fighters in Dan stage before, it will, however, be more difficult for me to defeat him.”</p><p>“Makes sense,” Yan Zheke whispered to agree with him. She moved her eyes and said with a smile, “But there is still a long way for him to go to reach your level. Especially, since you can restrain his supernatural ability.”</p><p><em>Although Cheng can’t fly, his supernatural ability of fire and frost can be forced out. So if Qu Hui wants to use the supernatural flying ability, he’ll easily be shot down by Cheng’s supernatural ability!</em></p><p>Of course, Qu Hui’s supernatural ability could not only help him fly but it also helped him control his opponents’ movements in the match and use the space. He was much better than other fighters in high-ranking Dan Stage.</p><p>“Since Coach Yan says so, then I should be proud of myself. Even though I’m reluctant to praise myself like this.” Lou Cheng saw the referee enter the ring. He stood in the center, listening to the radio which was announcing the two opposing parties in the first round.</p><p>Yin Xiangxi VS Yan Zheke!</p><p>“Oh, it’s him.” Lou Cheng held Yan Zheke’s hand and reminded her with great concern, “Never feel panic when you are fighting him.”</p><p>“Never get rattled either.” Yan Zheke smiled and agreed with him.</p><p>During the last week and even the last year, she and Cheng had watched many videos about Yin Xiangxi. They had already made a general plan about what they should do when they confronted him.</p><p>“Keep calm and avoid being pulled into his ferocious rhythm. Keep cool and wander around. Even if there is a chance for you to hit him, don’t do it directly. Not until Yin Xiangxi has consumed a lot or the perfect opportunity comes. When that happens you should take the chance to play your counterattacks without hesitation. To defeat him with one hit is called Clearance!”</p><p><em>If you were stubborn, it would be hard to go further!</em></p><p>Yan Zheke pinched Lou Cheng’s palm slightly. She stood up and gave the other members a fist bump. She walked toward the flight of stairs at a steady pace.</p><p>The boos became louder, mixed with a lot of flirtatious whistles. The atmosphere in the arena was heating up.</p><p>Yan Zheke walked towards the ring step by step. She glanced at Yin Xiangxi who was already standing in the ring. Yin Xiangxi was a Yuppie boy with a beard. He appeared thin and calm. In actuality, he was very crazy and aggressive.</p><p>He was also unconsciously attracted by her bright appearance. He found her so beautiful and attractive that it made him eager to show his gentleness instead of being violent.</p><p>He shook his head to suppress the ripples rising from the bottom of his heart and again became ferocious.</p><p>Sometimes looking handsome or beautiful was also a kind of inborn supernatural ability. It was called Temptation…</p><p>The referee waited until Yan Zheke stood in the ring and set a fighting stance. He checked the clock. After more than ten seconds, he raised his right hand and announced,</p><p>“Three-minute talk time.”</p><p>The important match had now officially begun. It would decide which team could advance to the finals and which team would be eliminated.</p><p>If Sanjiang defeated Songcheng University in this match, then they would follow Shanbei and advance to the National Finals. Songcheng University would have to wait until next year.</p><p>Yin Xiangxi took a breath and did not say anything. He stared at Yan Zheke with his dangerous eyes.</p><p>Was this what people meant when they said looks could kill? Yan Zheke did not feel nervous at all. For some reason, she even wanted to laugh. She remembered how Cheng had ridiculed his opponents before.</p><p>After a couple spent time alone together, they were gradually affected by each other.</p><p>Yan Zheke stopped thinking about this. Ignoring the stare from her opponent, she began to adjust her own state.</p><p>Yin Xiangxi suddenly opened his mouth and smiled faintly.</p><p>“Rest assured, I won’t attack you so ferociously.”</p><p><em>Do you mean that you don’t need to go all out when you are fighting with me? Or are you planning to flirt with me so as to irritate me?</em> Just as Yan Zheke began to contemplate his words, she saw that the referee was waving his right hand. He announced,</p><p>“Begin now!”</p><p><em>“Well, all the fighters have been affected by my brother’s bad habit. They have learned to keep silent during the three-minute talk time and only say one sentence to confuse the opponent!”</em> Yan Zheke thought for a while and was not irritated by him. She swung her waist and began to circle Yin Xiangxi with light steps as a climbing sheep would, agile and balanced. She gave her opponent no chance to perform a sound attack.</p><p>She then took a chance to move to her opponent’s side and raised her right arm. She quickly clenched her fist and hit him.</p><p>Instead of defending himself, Yin Xiangxi tightened his thigh and performed a more ferocious and faster sidekick.</p><p>PANG!</p><p>If they kept fighting like this, Yan Zheke would be hit by her opponent’s attack before she landed a fist on him.</p><p>She calmed down and suppressed her impatience and panic. She kept with her planned play style. As Yin Xiangxi was performing a sidekick, she swung her waist to slide behind her opponent. She then dragged her right fist to the other side and bounced her shoulder to slam her fist into her opponent’s temple.</p><p>BAM! She sank her waist and struck again with her left fist. This attack was called “strike opponent’s ears with both fists”!</p><p>Yin Xiangxi suddenly bent down and shrank back his head. He exerted force into his feet and moved backward quickly. At the same time, he raised his elbows. He was about to hit violently towards Yan Zheke’s abdomen.</p><p>No ducking about and no blocking, he was betting everything on this one charge!</p><p>Yan Zheke did not want to take this opportunity because the situation was too dangerous. She relieved the force in her arms and jumped backward in an agile and flexible way. This helped her shorten the distance between her and her opponent.</p><p>After trading several blows with Yin Xiangxi, Yan Zheke gradually became familiar with his play style. While she no longer felt nervous or rattled, she chose to strictly obey the plan she’d made before the match. She continued to wander around and attack her opponent occasionally. Once the attack lost its target, she would immediately move away.</p><p>BAM! BANG! Hearing the sounds from the attacks, Lou Cheng was a little worried. Even though he knew that the referee was a mighty fighter in the high-ranked Dan Stage who could definitely stop the attacks from two Professional Ninth Pin fighters, he was still nervous. He was afraid that Ke would be hurt by her opponent.</p><p>Qu Hui, who sat in the host team area, was slightly depressed. His expectation for rapid victory was in tatters!</p><p><em>Doesn’t Yan Zheke lack the experience of actual combat?</em></p><p><em>Don’t girls feel nervous and panic more easily?</em></p><p><em>How can she perform so practically and calmly? She wasn’t even affected by Xiangxi’s rhythm and gave him no target to hit even though he still has so much stamina!</em></p><p><em>He won’t consume Lin Que’s stamina this way. Which means that I also can’t fight with Lou Cheng in my peak physical state…</em></p><p><em>So, is he going to risk it and use that “move”?</em></p><p><em>Well, use it now! If we can win this match, we will advance to the National Finals. We never expected to win the match with Shanbei next week!</em></p><p><em>…</em></p><p>After Yan Zheke wandered around and tangled with Yin Xiangxi for a while, she noticed that his attacking momentum had decreased slightly. He was also becoming impatient. So she came up with an idea. She again approached him and visualized a horrible scene about Mega Avalanche in her mind. She shook her shoulder and raised her right arm slightly. It seemed that she was about to attack him.</p><p>POP!</p><p>Because Yin Xiangxi was impatient, he again performed a violent sidekick.</p><p>Yan Zheke bounced her spine and was forced to change her center of gravity. She pulled her body to slide to the back of him right when he was standing on one leg!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
