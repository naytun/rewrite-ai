So Lou Cheng and the others didn’t escape from Shannan in a hurry like they did after defeating Yimo. Instead, they spent a while relaxing and celebrating their victory in the locker room, after which they packed their belongings and came out slowly.</p><p>At this time, most of the audience was already gone, with only several students remaining to do exercises.</p><p>Upon seeing Lou Cheng, they immediately began scattering like small animals who were terrified that the Demon King came to invade.</p><p>Even Mu Yu, the Bane, suffered due to Lou Cheng. Normal people better stay away from him.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Cai Zongming and the others could not help laughing and turning their gazes toward the well-known “hero” teasingly, because they were among the few people who knew Lou Cheng had actually used his third supernatural ability to reflect Mu Yu’s curse.</p><p>Holding Yan Zheke’s hand in one hand, Lou Cheng covered his face with the other, sighed, and then said,</p><p>“They’re acting like I’m a super-villain… ”</p><p>While feeling embarrassed, Lou Cheng also thought it was kind of cool!</p><p>…</p><p>When all the members of Songcheng University Martial Arts Club arrived back at school, exhausted, it was already 8:00 at night. So they quickly said goodbye to each other and went back to their dorms separately to catch up on their chores for the weekend.</p><p>The next day, after another round of morning exercise and special training, Lou Cheng went to the NO.1 school building with Yan Zheke in the afternoon, looking for an empty classroom to study in.</p><p>With two schoolbags over his shoulder, Lou Cheng chuckled as he watched the students coming and going, and then said,</p><p>“Actually I like seeing girls on their way to class or to study, with books in their arms. It’s like a scene from a book.”</p><p>“I used to do that, but someone always takes my books once he sees them~” said Yan Zheke. Then she turned her watery eyes to Lou Cheng, giving him a gentle smile and added, “I thought it was difficult for him to carry two piles of books at one time, so I put them in a bag. Otherwise, I would get to see a tall and strong man walking around like a girl with several books in his arms… haha.”</p><p>She was almost choked by her laughter.</p><p>Lou Cheng arched his lips and echoed,</p><p>“That scene is too fantastic to be seen!”</p><p>“But I’m not as strong as you think. It’s more about balance!”</p><p>Chatting and laughing, they entered the school building and headed up to the third floor while looking for a good place to study.</p><p>They finally found one after checking almost every classroom on the floor, in which there were only a dozen people studying quietly. They seated themselves in the back row near the window.</p><p>“Even on Sunday, there are still so many students here? The academic atmosphere here seems to be good.” Lou Cheng said while recalling what he had seen in other classrooms. Lou Cheng sighed and then added, “But every time I go back to the dorm, Little Ming and God-Man are always fooling around, which has greatly influenced my impression of students these days… ”</p><p>God-Man was the nickname Tang Wen received from Talker and was acknowledged by the whole dorm since he had been so addicted to online games that he forgot the examination time as well as the makeup exams.</p><p>Taking back her schoolbag, Yan Zheke smiled before opening it and said,</p><p>“It reminds me of what our Marketing Management teacher usually says. Survey results mostly depend on the samples you use. It’s like doing a survey on the academic atmosphere in this university. If you want a good result, you would look at the students studying in the school buildings and library, but a critic would do the survey in the martial arts arena.”</p><p>She carefully controlled her volume in order not to bother others. Such a faint voice didn’t affect their communication at all from this short distance because they both had good sight and hearing.</p><p>While speaking, Yan Zheke opened her schoolbag and took out all the thick textbooks, reference materials, half-filled notebooks, scratch papers, and a pencil bag with a pink piggy pattern on it.</p><p>On the other side, Lou Cheng also took out the textbook for discrete mathematics, a detailed explanation of examples, a notebook with key information in it, scratch paper, a pencil, and an eraser.</p><p>They arranged all the stuff on the desk almost at the same time, in the same order, as if there was a mirror in between.</p><p>They exchanged a look and smile with each other while enjoying the warm sunshine that poured in through the window. The atmosphere here was just right.</p><p>When Lou Cheng was about to open the book, Yan Zheke suddenly looked up at him with her left hand supporting her chin and said,</p><p>“Cheng, do you think it’s too boring?”</p><p>“What’s boring?” Lou Cheng asked in confusion.</p><p>“I mean,” Yan Zheke turned her gaze up, bit her lips, and added, “You always accompany me to study, but there hasn’t been time for us to date. Do you think it’s boring?”</p><p>Other couples aren’t like this.</p><p>“That’s what you’re talking about?” Lou Cheng couldn’t help laughing as he said, “Not boring at all. I was once addicted to studying, and at that time, the joy and satisfaction of figuring out a difficult question was equal to winning a Challenge Tournament. In addition, my subjects are more difficult and I have to study harder in order to pass the exams. Besides, isn’t what we are doing now a kind of date? Everything I do with you is like a date to me!”</p><p>He had compromised on his studying from getting all A’s to only graduating with passing marks. After all, it was hard to balance the time and energy he spent on martial arts and schoolwork.</p><p>“Dis-gusting!” Yan Zheke said with smiling eyes and lowered her voice, “In fact, in fact, I feel good now… ”</p><p>While studying, each time she raised her head to look at Cheng’s face, she would feel warm and cozy knowing Cheng was always with her.</p><p>“Me too!” Lou Cheng said with emphasis.</p><p>With twinkling eyes and two dimples showing on her face, Yan Zheke replied, “Really? Do you really like it? Do you like it a lot?”</p><p>“Yeah, I really like it!” Lou Cheng spoke his mind without hesitation.</p><p>“Since you like it, we will cancel all future dates and study whenever we are free instead!” Yan Zheke straightened her back and stated cheerfully.</p><p>“What?” Lou Cheng was stunned, and then said, “These, these two can’t be mixed together and treated as the same… ”</p><p>Before he could finish his words, Lou Cheng saw Yan Zheke’s eyes brighten and her mouth puff up with her lips clenched tightly as she tried hard to stifle her laughter.</p><p>“I was tricked by you again… ” said Lou Cheng, then he sighed while covering his face with his hands.</p><p>“Hehe… ” Yan Zheke bent over the desk, laughing into her arms. Her shoulders were shaking and her hair drooped down. she was really enjoying herself.</p><p>With this, they both felt happy and relaxed. They even seemed to study more efficiently.</p><p>After reviewing one chapter of Discrete Mathematics and finishing the corresponding exercises, Lou Cheng was slightly satisfied with his progress. However, he was feeling a little dizzy, so he decided to take a ten-minute break.</p><p>“What a difficult subject, and it is said that many students fail the exams every year!” Staring at the textbook for several seconds, Lou Cheng sighed and then turned his gaze toward Yan Zheke, who was completely focused on her writing. She frowned, pouted, smiled, and bit her lips… all of her small actions were attractive and intoxicating.</p><p>Looking at her with a smile, Lou Cheng became captivated by her fluttering eyelashes, spirited eyes, and pink cheeks…</p><p>“What are you looking at? Mind your own business! Play with your cell phone!” she said. Unable to bear his warm gaze, Yan Zheke glared at him bitterly and tenderly.</p><p>Lou Cheng gave her a smile and withdrew his gaze. Then he took out his cell phone and unlocked it, intending to visit the forum. The first post he saw was by “All Good Names Are Taken By Dogs.”</p><p>“Haha, I’m in the headlines! The video I forwarded became a hot topic!”</p><p>What video? Lou Cheng went to the webpage through the link in the post and saw a video named “Relaxed Winner Lou Cheng vs Self-Defeated Mu Yu”.</p><p>The video of their match was so funny that lots of viewers had forwarded it, causing it to spread like a wildfire. Within one day the webpage was forwarded more than 10,000 times and commented nearly 10,000 times, while its views were countless.</p><p>Lou Cheng watched the video from the view of a spectator and was also amused, feeling very sympathetic for Old Fellow Mu.</p><p>“Haha, maybe I’ve won this match in a dream!” He went on looking through the comments with a smile, waiting for Zheke to finish her schoolwork and then share the funniest parts with her.</p><p>“He was not only a powerful fighter but also a good actor!”</p><p>“This will keep me laughing for the whole year!”</p><p>“Haha, my mom wants to know why I’m kneeling down in front of the computer!”</p><p>“it was so magical and there was no flaw in his actions. Even Lou Cheng just stood there looking stunned~”</p><p>Gradually he noticed several interesting ID’s like “Mu Yu of Shannan”, “Old Fellow Mu”, “Mu Yu The Bane”, “Lou Cheng of Songcheng University” and “Fighter Lou Cheng”.</p><p>“Lou Cheng of Songcheng University” sighed with emotion and wrote, “It was the first time I fought in a match like that. I was almost overwhelmed!”</p><p>“Fighter Lou Cheng” saw “Lou Cheng of Songcheng University” and began accusing him, “You fake! That’s a newly registered ID, you must be copying me!”</p><p>“You said on the webpage that you were in the capital, so has Songcheng University moved to the capital?” “Lou Cheng of Songcheng University” argued back.</p><p>“Damn it, who are they? I haven’t registered any IDs yet!” Lou Cheng thought, stunned by all the fakes.</p><p>They were all newly registered IDs for the purpose of partaking in Lou Cheng’s popularity!</p><p>At this time, Yan Zheke’s mobile suddenly vibrated with the notification for a new message.</p><p>Having just finished a problem, she was feeling rather satisfied and relaxed, so Yan Zheke picked up her cell phone, finding a message from Yan Xiaoling.</p><p>“Senior sister, senior sister, get Lou Cheng an ID on Weibo. We’re going to follow him! There are so many guys masquerading as him! The video of Old Fellow Mu and his match is currently a hot topic… ”</p><p>Her disorganized words took Yan Zheke quite a while to understand. “Cheng,” Zheke immediately turned her head and said, “Do you know what’s happening on Weibo? The video of your match with Mu Yu?”</p><p>“Yeah, I’m watching it. There are three fake Lou Chengs arguing with each other.” Lou Cheng replied, wanting to laugh and weep at the same time.</p><p>The ongoing argument among the three frauds had attracted more than 10,000 Weibo users to follow them.</p><p>…</p><p>In Shannan University, Lin Xiaozhi was standing on the balcony in a protective suit, calling Mu Yu.</p><p>“Captain, captain, check Weibo. You are currently a hot topic! Ahchoo!”</p><p>“I’ve seen it, isn’t it bad news… ” Mu Yu’s face was flashing red and white from anger and embarrassment at the banter.</p><p>“There are more people following you, and it’s definitely good news. Maybe you’ll be a celebrity on Weibo and make a big fortune through it. Ahchoo, come on, change your literary and artistic ID into your real name, and we’ll prove you are the real one!” Lin Xiaozhi urged him.</p><p>Damn it. How could I get a cold from taking a cold bath? I’m an energetic Professional-Ninth-Pin fighter!</p><p>Just my luck to be Bane’s friend and have to pay the price for his supernatural ability!</p><p>…</p><p>On the other side, Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke were still cheerfully watching the three frauds argue, along with the other onlookers.</p><p>Suddenly, Lou Cheng’s cell phone vibrated with the notification for an incoming call.</p><p>He hurried to answer it with a lowered voice.</p><p>“Senior sister?”</p><p>It was Shi Yuejian calling!</p><p>Shi Yuejian was laughing. “I saw that video and it was so funny! Come on, register a Weibo ID and stop those guys from stealing your popularity.”</p><p>“I already have one… ” Lou Cheng said as his mouth twitched.</p><p>He had registered on Weibo to look at something a long time ago, and his ID was very embarrassing…</p><p>“You have one? What’s your ID? I couldn’t find it. All the present IDs related to you are fakes!” Shi Yuejian continued asking.</p><p>Lou Cheng covered his face with both hands, too embarrassed to say the name.</p><p>He liked reading fantasy novels at that time, and thus his Weibo ID was “Taiyi the Greatest God”. Up to now, he only had one follower, not counting some zombie IDs, and it was his little fairy, “Swordsman Dislikes Drinking”. As for Zheke’s QQ ID, she had already changed it to “Little Ke”.</p><p>“I’m going to change my ID. I’ll call you back when I finish,” Lou Cheng said, without telling Shi Yuejian his original ID.”</p><p>“Okay, I’ll help you with the authentication procedure,” Shi Yuejian said and then hung up the phone.</p><p>Lou Cheng rushed to change his ID “Taiyi the Greatest God” to “Lou Cheng 129”.</p><p>“129… ” Watching as Lou Cheng changed the ID, Yan Zheke murmured to herself and smiled, making dimples appeared on her face. She couldn’t help feeling a touch of sweetness in her heart.</p><p>January 29th was her birthday.</p><p>“Hehe.” Lou Cheng smiled without saying a word. Soon his change was acknowledged and he sent the new ID to his senior sister.</p><p>Within minutes, the ID “Shi Yuejian of Wuyue Club”, who had hundreds and thousands of followers, forwarded “All Good Names Are Taken By Dogs” webpage and added some words to it.</p><p>“That match was so funny! @Lou Cheng 129, actually, he’s my junior brother!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
