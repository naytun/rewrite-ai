He had a deep impression of their scary combination moves. Hence, though he had just hurt his feet and lost his balance, he remembered those fights and he quickly whipped out his “Scorpion Tail Needle” move. He did not want to fall any closer into the jaws of defeat.</p><p>Initially, he wanted to use the moves of the “Plague Sect” at the most critical moment when Lin Que was suffering from tremendous pain to score his victory. However, now it had to be prematurely displayed. Not only did he lose the surprise factor but his body had to undergo a substantial amount of stress!</p><p>This was because he had fallen for the provocation of his opponent and was fighting with increasingly risky moves! Fang Zhirong was feeling frustrated and annoyed, but he tried to control his feelings and once again lowered his stance. He started to circle Lin Que in meandering curves. He did not attempt to attack and did not give his opponent the chance to use “Force Concentration” to relieve his pain.</p><p>A fighter would have to use energy to try to distract himself or to try to overcome the pain. So Fang Zhirong wanted to prolong this process so as to tire Lin Que out, or even make him live with the pain!</p><p>In the midst of his movements, he seemed to be limping. This was because the sole of his right foot had received a blow during the earlier “Earth Cracking” movement. It was bruised. If it was not for his shoe which acted as a barrier, he would probably be more severely injured right now.</p><p>In this short exchange, both sides were already suffering from injuries!</p><p>At this moment, the guest commentator in the live broadcasting studio, Zhang He, took the opportunity to explain a couple of the technical terms he had thrown out earlier.</p><p>“‘Dark Poison Force’ is a core force of the Dark Sect. It has a strange toxic nature. No matter where the target is, it would leave the effects of being bitten by a snake. As for the effects after being ‘poisoned’, it would depend on where Fang Zhirong is directing it towards. Different fighters from the Dark Sect would have different ‘Dark Poison Force”. Some would cause hallucinations, some would cause breathlessness, and others dizziness… ‘Scorpion Tail Needle’ is a Dan stage move from the ‘Plague Sect’. It’s a move that had a number of paralyzing effects and it would amplify any pain multiple times… ”</p><p>The host who was listening to the commentary was somewhat stunned and he exclaimed, “Senior Zhang, is this true? But Fang Zhirong doesn’t have any supernatural abilities. How did he manage to train such a force and move? ”</p><p>For Dan stage fighters without supernatural abilities, when they are trying to enter the inhuman level, before their root pulp changes, they would need to align their muscles with their mental state, including the five viscera and six bowels, before they could create any special moves and effects. Even then, the moves would not be too strong. For example, normal Dan stage fighters of the Ice Sect would not be able to execute “Frost Force” as powerfully as Lou Cheng, not to mention even being able to perform it.</p><p>But after hearing Senior Zhang’s commentary, the impact of Fang Zhirong’s force and moves was felt even more keenly!</p><p>Zhang He chuckled and said, “He must have taken some medicine or booster to help with his training. Just like how fighters trained for the Poison Palm. Such force and moves would only work if the opponent is hit at a specific place. It would weaken each time, and it is necessary to retrain it after every competition. At the same time, it would place a heavy burden on the body and cause substantial injury. Some become slower in breaking through their physical limits while others have bodies that are not as strong as those of the same level. This will happen because their root pulp is affected. Only then will there be a reaction and improvements… Only then would the body recover bit by bit… ”</p><p>While he talked, Fang Zhirong saw that Lin Que was already starting to get used to the pain. Hence, he stopped circling him. In one move, Fan Zhirong tightened his body and started to attack with his fists and feet. He tried to make use of this moment or he would lose the opportunity to win.</p><p>This was the move that made him famous when he was a Ninth Pin Professional fighter. It came from his Plague Sect’s “Prolonged Illness”, the ultimate skill of the “Nine Illness Hits”. The word “Tangle” would spring out and close in on the opponent from all directions. This meant that anyone facing this move cannot escape and could only make a stance — as though the person had contracted various illnesses and could only painstakingly wait for recovery.</p><p>Pam pam pam, bam bam bam! Fang Zhirong repeated went for Lin Que’s right hand and did not give him any good opportunity to use the “Force Concentration” to retaliate. At this moment, Fang Zhirong had the upper hand, and although Mu Jinnian and Yan Zheke were at different places, they both had the same worried expression on their faces.</p><p>As he calculated and estimated how long before the pain would subside, Fang Zhirong quieted down, suddenly revealing an opening.</p><p>Lin Que had waited for quite some time. Without any hesitation, he took in a deep breath to absorb all his pain into his qi, blood, and spirit.</p><p>Poom!</p><p>Like a volcano, Lin Que erupted. His danqi was exploding everywhere. His right arm swelled, and his right fist became a hammer, swinging ferociously at his opponent. It cracked through the air like a plane flying through the clouds.</p><p>They were too close to each other. He did not have enough time and space to expand into the “Meteor Blast”!</p><p>Although he was about to face such a force, Fang Zhirong did not panic. He used his Force Concentration and sat steadily like he was in a gold carriage.</p><p>Pam! He took a large stride forward, making his body larger than it was. He swung his fist confidently. “Raise the Fire, Burn the Sky”!</p><p>Bam! The sound of an explosion echoed throughout the arena. The two fists froze in midair and Fang Zhirong’s legs sank down. The martial arts shoes that were already torn earlier broke apart. Lin Que did not move an inch, he erupted twice continuous and delivered another “Earth Cracking” blow.</p><p>Then, Lin Que suddenly sensed a strange suction force from his opponent’s fist. Then he realized that his pull back from the punch was actually getting slower!</p><p>Magnetism Sect? His mind started to churn. He took in a breath and started to shake and vibrate his muscles. Not only did he stop pulling back his fist, he went with the suction force and with the “Yin-yang Twist” skill, he used Fang Zhirong’s suction force to hit Fang Zhirong!</p><p>Seeing his move, Fang Zhirong did not panic, in fact, he was pleased. His face turned red, and with a turn and a shake of his wrist, it transformed into a push force, slowing Lin Que’s attack.</p><p>With this slow down, there were sounds of an explosion within Fang Zhirong, like there were turbines turning crazily inside him.</p><p>He controlled his body and within a split second, he changed his internal magnetic field to “influence” each other, “affect” each other, accumulating a terrifying explosive force.</p><p>“Magnetism Sect”, “Turn of Two Ends”, the turn of the magnetic field!</p><p>Bam, with a sound, his fist split the air in front of him and like a piston, charged towards Lin Que.</p><p>This move, even without the “Force Concentration”, was almost as strong as a Dan stage explosion!</p><p>With the Inhuman level, he would have stronger control; his physical body would have changed. Without the need for more visualization, he could complement this move with “Force Concentration”, multiplying the explosive force of the Dan stage. Of course, this also meant that the burden on him would be multiplied just as much.</p><p>Fang Zhirong used medication to help him train his force and moves. This had damaged his body and affected the number of times he could execute “Force Concentration”. It was less than the average Dan stage fighters. He could only erupt twice continuously once, so he practiced hard for the ultimate move, so as to make up for his weakness. However, during normal situations, there would usually be insufficient time during a battle to let him use this move whenever he wanted to.</p><p>For now, he wanted to exhaust Lin Que’s Dan stage explosions, and to increase Lin Que’s anxiety as he was already worried about the next fight. Like this, Lin Que would probably make mistakes during the fight and he would have the opportunity to strike.</p><p>As for himself, he was not in a hurry at all. With Peng Leyun next, no one would be in a hurry!</p><p>Due to the short distance, Fan Zhirong’s fist was so powerful that Lin Que could not avoid it. This forced him to use either the “Force Concentration” to harden his stance or allow himself to be hit and pushed to the line of defeat.</p><p>Lin Que’s eyes started to darken. He raised both of his arms and relaxed his wrists — one in a push position, one in a pull position.</p><p>He chose not to release his Dan stage force at this moment!</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Fang Zhirong’s fist seemed to have sunk into a mud swamp. With the “guidance” and push from his opponent, he lost some attacking force and his punch fizzled out. He was unable to release all his strength.</p><p>Pam, Pam, Pam! Lin Que moved back three steps. His balance shook a little but his body was not agile enough.</p><p>“This is the moment!” Fang Zhirong noticed the good opportunity and with a large step forward, his right hand reached out with his fingers extended. He grabbed Lin Que’s left arm, and with a dark flash, injected his force.</p><p>He finally had the chance to use his “Dark Poison Force”!</p><p>Seeing that he got his way, Fang Zhirong’s heart leaped a little. Just as he was about to attack again, he suddenly noticed that Lin Que’s eyes were expressionless, in fact, they seemed to have expected his move!</p><p>Lin Que took in a breath and his body started to tremble. All the muscles seemed to twist in unrest.</p><p>His right hand hurriedly reached out, his five fingers stretched out and were already black with poison at their tips.</p><p>Ji Family’s “Yin-Yang Twist”!</p><p>He returned the “Dark Poison Force” with another “Dark Poison Force”!</p><p>Lin Que’s fingers latched on to Fang Zhirong, and he returned half of the “Dark Poison Force” to its owner.</p><p>Immediately, Fang Zhirong started to feel short of breath. Although he had some resistance against some of these poisons but to take so much at one go, he would definitely be hurt.</p><p>As for Lin Que, he was still far from releasing all the toxins from his body due to the short distance of the “Yin-Yang Twist”. He still had a great amount of poison in his body and his strength was leaving him. However, he was already prepared, so once he hit Fang Zhirong, he immediately activated his “Force Concentration”, and minimized whatever negative effects the poison had. While Fang Zhirong was still trying to recover, Lin Que took the opportunity to “explode” the human body big dan and accumulate his force. He swung back his arm and with swollen muscles, he charged.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The air between the two fighters exploded and a huge force rushed towards Fang Zhirong.</p><p>Fighting Sect, Move 127, Meteor Blast!</p><p>Just as Lin Que was about to punch, Fang Zhirong contracted his pupils. He did not dare to slack back and quickly used his “Force Concentration” to gather his qi and blood at his Dantian with the explosive force at his arms.</p><p>He lifted his arms and blocked the aggressive blow.</p><p>But Lin Que started to launch attacks consecutively. He was not going to let Fang Zhirong off easily. He did Force Concentration and then he let go, before stomping his left foot on the ground hard.</p><p>Fighting Sect’s “Earth Cracking”, Double Explosion! One after the other!</p><p>Bam! A sound rumbled in his body and the floor started to crack. Fang Zhirong was too focused on protecting his head, he neglected his feet. When the attack injured the soles of his feet, his body swayed again. He had no choice but to enter the Dan realm again, getting his qi and blood back to maintain his balance.</p><p>At this point, Lin Que made a step forward. He went very close to Fang Zhirong and leaned against his shoulder. Then, with a stretch of his arm, Lin Que conveniently blocked Fang Zhirong’s elbow joint and stopped him from making any further moves.</p><p>Almost immediately after he locked Fang Zhirong in position, Lin Que took in a deep breath and visualized a scene of the meteor shower. He flew up and with Fang Zhirong facing down, he slammed onto the ground!</p><p>Triple Explosion!</p><p>Fighting Sect, Tenth Move, “Doomed Death”!</p><p>Bam! Dust flew everywhere. Fang Zhirong was on the ground and lost his ability to fight back for the moment.</p><p>Lin Que lowered his body, his arm relaxed and with a spring of his forearm, he pressed against the throat of his opponent.</p><p>The referee lifted his right arm and announced loudly,</p><p>“Lin Que wins!”</p><p>Songcheng Univeristy Martial Arts Club had won!</p><p>Hearing this, Mu Jinnian jumped up immediately and cheered.</p><p>“Hooray!”</p><p>Lin Que was so awesome!</p><p>Lou Cheng, Yan Zheke and the rest were relieved and happy but they were still not too excited because the competition was not over yet. There were more hurdles to jump over!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
