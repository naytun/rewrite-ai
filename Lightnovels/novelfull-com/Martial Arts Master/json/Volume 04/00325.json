Staring at the ceiling, he was actually recalling the scene of Yan Zheke balancing herself on the railing and her complicated expression after doing so. The soft moonlight and her hot response were still echoing in his mind like a poem.</p><p>It felt good even though he failed to get Zheke to stay with him in a hotel for the night.</p><p>What looked like a bad ending might turn out to be good!</p><p>What a pity that he was absolutely fascinated and forgot to take some photos.</p><p>Besides Lou Cheng, Zhang Jinye was also in the dorm, typing and checking code on his computer, while Zhao Qiang and Qiu Zhigao were sleeping at Qin Mo’s home. Lou Cheng could only hear the sound of typing echoing in the quiet room.</p><p>After expressing his sorrow to coach Yan for forgetting to record her anecdote with the camera, Lou Cheng logged on the forums, intending to write something.</p><p>Even though he suggested staying outside the school with Zheke yesterday night, it could be seen from Zheke’s expression and reaction that she actually didn’t understand his intention.</p><p>Shall I post a question online, like, “What’s a good way to make suggestions to my girlfriend?”</p><p>Or should I insinuate what I want in another way? After all, I’m not shameless enough as to say it directly…</p><p>After thinking for a while, Lou Cheng made a post.</p><p>“Should I be thankful for our school’s closed-off management or hate it?”</p><p>After clicking to submit the post, he suddenly remembered he has hundreds and thousands of followers now instead of just Zheke!</p><p>Damn it, I’m a famous Weibo user now, but I always forget it!</p><p>Reading what he wrote carefully and finding no sensitive content in it, he decided not to delete it out of laziness. Besides, he enjoyed interacting with his girlfriend this way to show off their relationship in public! Why should he care about what other people think?</p><p>After withdrawing all his thoughts, he turned to QQ and pretended to ask Yan Zheke casually,</p><p>“I’ve just posted on Weibo.”</p><p>“Did you write about my awful deeds in it… ” Yan Zheke replied with a looking dumb emoji. Though she also regretted that Lou Cheng hadn’t recorded her naughty moment, she wasn’t that depressed since there were so many regrets in life and the best way to remember something was to record them in your mind.</p><p>Lou Cheng sent a laughing to tears emoji, “How could I write that? I know you don’t like to show off our romance in front of others.”</p><p>“Let elder sister fondle your head, what a considerate boy~!” Yan Zheke sent with a grinning emoji, “I’ll go to see what you wrote~”</p><p>Clicking to open the Weibo and refreshing the page, she soon found Lou Cheng’s post.</p><p>“What… What is this Lothario suggesting!” Yan Zheke turned over on her bed with the cell phone in her hands, complaining about Cheng secretly.</p><p>I wouldn’t have noticed his attempt if Dirty Tong hadn’t explained it to me!</p><p>“Hum!” Yan Zheke rolled her eyes and commented on the post while gnashing her teeth.</p><p>Lou Cheng also refreshed the page and found comments and forwards were increasing. It seemed others were quite interested in this topic.</p><p>“You won’t ask this question when you’ve experienced the sheep grazing management. It’s so cool!”</p><p>“Even without closed-off management, you would suffer from dormitory-locking, network-cutting, and all lights out in time. You amateurs still have a long way to go and don’t bother to care about the details.”</p><p>“Thinking back to the old days when our school adopted the closed-off management, I broke my hand climbing over the wall to a nearby internet bar… Damn it, I’ve exposed my real age… ”</p><p>After going through several comments, he found a familiar ID, “Shu Rui of Songcheng Television” commented with a “laughing while covering one’s mouth” emoji, “Shall I report it as big news? I’ll title it ‘What A Shock! Martial Arts Club Leading Player Complains About the School Management Rules!’”</p><p>It took Lou Cheng great effort to hold back his laughter as he replied to Shu Rui, “This title won’t draw enough attention, you should say ‘What A Shock! Closed-Off Management Evokes Student’s Dark Side!’”</p><p>Then he browsed the pages quickly, skipping the other comments until he found his fairy’s reply.</p><p>Within minutes he saw “Swordsman Dislikes Drinking” replied with a dog emoji,</p><p>“What’re you talking about? How come I don’t understand?”</p><p>“Well, she seems to have noticed what I meant… ” Lou Cheng smiled. When he was about to say something on QQ, Ke sent a “laughing while pounding the table” emoji. “There are a lot of funny comments under your post. Hurry up, take a look~”</p><p>“I’m…” Lou Cheng switched back to Weibo, beginning to check the comments he had skipped.</p><p>“Unparalleled Dragon King” said, “Does the closed-off management make any difference considering your kung-fu?”</p><p>“Of course, there’s a big difference… A bachelor wouldn’t understand…” Lou Cheng complained in his mind and went on checking the other replies.</p><p>He knew Unparalleled Dragon King was a martial arts addict and indoors man, who hadn’t gotten a girlfriend yet even though he had spent several years abroad to further his education.</p><p>“Brahman 001” said, “A day-student in junior high doesn’t know what you mean… ”</p><p>“Eternal Nightfall” commented with a “smiling through tears” emoji, “It doesn’t make any difference to me. I only get out of bed for class time or to answer the call of nature!”</p><p>There had already been dozens of comments with several familiar IDs.</p><p>“Our school also adopted the closed-off management at the same time as cutting off both electricity and the network signal. In order to watch a foreign Martial Arts Competition broadcasting, we tried every method. Finally, we got a TV signal in the aisle. Maybe we were too excited and noisy, and thus annoyed those in the other dorms, they came out to punish us but quickly retreated when they saw dozens of half-naked men… Your words reminded me of it and I want to apologize to them… ”</p><p>“Haha, I’ve also fooled around in my dorm after lights out. But the guy sleeping above me came down and gave me a good beating.”</p><p>“Why do you say it in a casual tone? Aren’t you angry? What happened afterward?”</p><p>“Afterwards, (shy emoji) we got together.”</p><p>“Haha…” Lou Cheng burst out laughing.</p><p>He must be telling a joke!</p><p>Going on to look through the comments, Lou Cheng found quite a lot of funny ones and felt a little worried while laughing happily.</p><p>Am I going to be a crosstalk comedian in the martial arts circle and a warrior in the crosstalk circle?</p><p>Gradually, Lou Cheng felt sleepy in the happy atmosphere. After saying goodnight to Yan Zheke, he went to sleep in time without making any dreams.</p><p>…</p><p>The next morning, when Lou Cheng was running to improve his endurance after morning exercise, he jumped over the fence on a whim and rushed to the nearby market, where he bought the Brother Dong deep-fried twisted dough sticks and soup dumplings with soybean milk that Zhang Jingye and his girlfriend praised profusely.</p><p>The moment he handed the breakfast to Yan Zheke, she was so surprised that all she could do was blink with a joyful expression.</p><p>When they finished breakfast and went to the martial arts gymnasium, hand in hand, they found Cai Zongming already there, yawning.</p><p>“Didn’t you sleep well last night? Or maybe you couldn’t sleep in an unfamiliar bed?” Lou Cheng asked jokingly.</p><p>At this time, Yan Zheke went into the female locker room with her personal belongings.</p><p>Cai Zongming shook his head and said, “I had a nightmare and woke up with a start. After that, I couldn’t fall asleep again.”</p><p>“What kind of nightmare?” Lou Cheng asked with interest.</p><p>Cai Zongming hadn’t recovered from the nightmare yet. “I dreamed about being the first one to fight in the arena. I was so happy and made a great speech during the talk time, but the one on the other side didn’t even spare a glance at me, which made me so angry. When I took a close look at him, I found the speechless fighter, my opponent this time, was Lin Que! Damn it!</p><p>“I encountered Lin Que during the talk time, it was horrible! Horrible!”</p><p>Lou Cheng was stunned for a while and then adjusted his facial expression while asking,</p><p>“Talker, do you think I’ll sympathize with you? Actually, I want to laugh since your nightmare was so funny!”</p><p>“You can’t understand that fear.” Cai Zongming shook one finger in front of him.</p><p>When Lou Cheng was about to continue teasing him, Lin Que entered the room and there was instantly a chill in the air.</p><p>…</p><p>Peaceful days soon past and it came to Friday. The opponent in December 1st’s group competition was so weak that Lou Cheng didn’t need to fight against them himself, so he devoted himself to practicing and cultivating with full strength instead of having reservations for the competition.</p><p>When the match came to its end, Geezer Shi coughed to clear his throat and said,</p><p>“You bum-boy, do you have anything to do tonight? If you do have anything, cancel it.”</p><p>“No, master, what do you need me to do?” Lou Cheng asked curiously.</p><p>On his schedule this semester, only Friday and Saturday night, as well as Saturday and Sunday afternoon, were left empty — the special training took up all his mornings.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s schedule packed even more than his because she still had professional lessons Friday night. Since all the students were from the same class, it was difficult for Lou Cheng to mingle with them.</p><p>Geezer Shi coughed and then continued,</p><p>“My old friends made some headway in their research work on Longhu Immortal’s remains and found many belongings related to Cultivation. So they are planning to explore the Longhu District near Zhaoshan Lake for more useful tracks. Come with me to get more access to it and see if there is anything to gain. All the dangerous things have already been cleaned there, so don’t worry.”</p><p>Since he was found out Geezer Shi was suffering from old injuries that affected his lifespan, Lou Cheng had been thinking about ways to cure his master and wondering if there was any headway in the research work, so he replied without hesitation,</p><p>“Sure!”</p><p>Geezer Shi nodded slightly and said,</p><p>“Listen to them carefully, talk as little as possible, and never cut in unless it’s necessary. There’s a hot-tempered old guy there. Of course, I’m not afraid of him, but I don’t want to waste time on him.”</p><p>“Yes, master,” said Lou Cheng. Keeping Old Shi’s warning in mind, he decided to be a mute following his master the whole night unless the other elders asked him something.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
