Unsteady though he looked, he was actually running at a high speed like a bear.</p><p>He even slightly adjusted his running direction since Lin Que might have learned from Lou Cheng’s mistakes and might preemptively block his way.</p><p>Since he dodged to the right in the last round, would Lin Que believe that he would run to the left this time?</p><p>It was a great possibility, so he could not take the risk and run to the left!</p><p>But it was also unsafe even if he dodged to the right. What if Lin Que was more clever than he was?</p><p>What about retreating directly? Lin Que would catch up with him easily with the Xing Formula.</p><p>Finally, Piao Yuan chose to dodge to the right since it was safer!</p><p>The feeling that Piao Yuan’s footwork gave the audience was a weird mixture of heavy and light. Imagine there was an elephant trying to get across a river—steadily as he walked, he was wavering at the same time because of buoyancy.</p><p>The resilience of the floor was supporting Piao Yuan’s steps like a wave in a river. It was not until he had made the most of his Elephant Movement did Piao Yuan spare the time to look at Lin Que.</p><p>It seemed that Lin Que was in no hurry to take action, but what he was doing now made Piao Yuan’s heart almost jump out of his throat. Using his waist and legs like a bow and string, Lin Que shot himself at Piao Yuan like an arrow and was now flying at a high speed, tearing up the air and creating a strong wind. Even the dust and pebbles on the ground were blown up to form a straight, grey line.</p><p>Meteor Force could not only shock someone, but could also help the fighter accelerate!</p><p>Now Lin Que was moving like a meteor or a bolt of lightning, even faster than the legendary fiery steed!</p><p>Piao Yuan hurried to calm himself down in order prevent himself from being overwhelmed. Stretching out his elephant leg, he began circling on the ring after changing his direction.</p><p>He clearly knew that he was initially weaker than Lin Que, not to mention that he had been injured by Lou Cheng just now, which took up much of his energy. Now that there was no possibility for him to defeat Lin Que, Piao Yuan had made up his mind to turn the match into a fight of attrition and create more opportunity for Xing Jingjing. As for the third fighter of Songcheng University, even “Semi-Disabled” and “Hallucination Clam” were able to defeat her with ease.</p><p>Now that it was a war of attrition, he just needed to stop trying to uphold his image and just run as he liked.</p><p>He would not fight against Lin Que directly unless he was caught.</p><p>While Piao Yuan kept changing his running direction with stable footwork, Lin Que was gradually reducing the scope of Piao Yuan’s activity with the speeding-up of Meteor Force and the magical turning with the help of mercurial balance and Yin-yang Twist. The distance between them was narrowing, but he had not found any chance to launch an attack yet for the ring was too broad.</p><p>While running as fast as he could, Piao Yuan took a glance at Lin Que, intending to find some trace of Lin Que’s impatience and thus prove that his strategy was efficient. However, what he discovered was still Lin Que’s deep, black eyes and emotionless face!</p><p><em>He is still not in a hurry?</em></p><p><em>Doesn’t he want to defeat me as soon as he can and then focus on Xing Jingjing in the next round?</em></p><p>Piao Yuan felt so depressed as his effort did not work. But he still kept running with great caution, avoiding facing Lin Que directly until the final moment.</p><p>“Thump! Thump! Thump!”</p><p>As they got closer and closer to each other, Piao Yuan noticed that Lin Que would soon be able to use the Xing Formula within such a distance, and it would be impossible for him to dodge it. Taking a deep breath, Piao Yuan came to an abrupt stop.</p><p>“Pop!”</p><p>Gathering strength in his knees, Piao Yuan sent a piece of tile flying with a swift kick.</p><p>“Woo!”</p><p>Because of the air friction, the piece of tile made a sharp sound while flying at Lin Que at a high speed like an arrow. After that kick, Piao Yuan took the opportunity to step downward and then bounced to catch up with the arrow.</p><p>During the whole process, he had even expanded his body with the help of Force and Danqi, making himself a real fierce giant bear!</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>The ring was shaking slightly along with Piao Yuan’s steps. Turning sideways, this “giant bear” was about to land on his opponent like Mount Tai.</p><p>“The Giant Bear Hitting the Tree move of the Bear Style!”</p><p>The sound of the wind was very sharp and the explosion of force was quite horrible. In the eyes of those in the audience, Lin Que was in danger since there was a tile-arrow in front of him and a human-bear at his back. If Lin Que made a small mistake, he would quickly lose the match under such a series of attacks!</p><p>“Crack!”</p><p>Lin Que came to an abrupt stop without the process of slowing himself down. The kinetic energy accumulated in the high-speed run was totally turned into the impact force of the Yin-yang Twist.</p><p>Keeping the impact force within his body, Lin Que stretched out his left hand to draw a circle in the air following the pattern of Taiji, which soon slowed down the flying tile and finally stopped it in his palm. All of the horrible force that the piece of tile carried initially seemed to be absorbed by an invisible sponge with none of it remaining.</p><p>As his muscles were shaking, Lin Que swung his swelling right arm quickly with the help of Yin-yang Twist and greeted the tree-knocking bear with a Meteor Blast!</p><p>Poom!</p><p>As if a bomb was set off in mid-air, the shockwave was burning as the giant bear knocked into the “explosion zone” and collided with Lin Que’s fist directly.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>They stopped at the same time as if they both had failed to defeat each other, and a network of cracks began crawling outward from the ground under them.</p><p>In the face of the burning blast, Piao Yuan felt so frightened that he hurried to close his eyes, drop his ears, and hold his breath.</p><p>At the same time, he took the opportunity to turn around and throw his right arm out like a whip, aiming at Lin Que’s neck.</p><p>A true man was able to adapt himself to his environment, being cowardly or fierce when it was needed.</p><p>Again shaking his body, Lin Que waved his arm with the force borrowed from the collision just now and punched toward Piao Yuan with his left fist.</p><p>Rocket-like Punch!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Their fists collided into each other with a dull thud, and there was a moment that they both paused in mid-air.</p><p>In an instant, Lin Que and Piao Yuan withdrew their arms separately. While they both began shaking under the great counterforce, Piao Yuan could not even keep his balance.</p><p>In the fierce battle between a Seventh-Pin fighter and a Mighty One born with abnormal strength, Lin Que gained the upper hand with his Yin-yang Twist!</p><p>As an experienced fighter, Piao Yuan immediately forced his Qi and blood to flow back and thus maintained his stance. Then he began gathering all of his force and spirit in his lower abdomen.</p><p>Instead of taking actions to dodge, Lin Que continued adjusting his Qi and blood to complete this explosion in a more fierce and quick way.</p><p>Pop! They tightened the muscles in their legs at the same time and each withdrew their left foot.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In a sudden blow of wind that came from nowhere, Lin Que managed to borrow the force with his shaking body and immediately withdrew his leg to again gather all of his Qi in his Dantian.</p><p>Two consecutive strikes of Yin-yang Twist!</p><p>Piao Yuan found that Lin Que was so disgusting to always attack him in the same way. However, he had no choice within such a distance but to also make a Force Concentration to face Lin Que’s attack directly!</p><p>Pop! Drawing his right arm back like a bowstring, Lin Que fiercely punched toward Piao Yuan with his fist.</p><p>Pop! Piao Yuan was unable to block Lin Que’s fist in time, so he chose to punch downward only to protect himself.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>When their fists met, a new gust of wind began wuthering in the ring. They both tightened all of their muscles.</p><p>There was still no expression on Lin Que’s face. Shaking his fascia, he again drive the force within his body to gather all the Qi, blood, spirit, and the other influential factors into his abdomen.</p><p>Crack! Standing with his toes inward, he punched at Piao Yuan with his left palm in order to cleave him.</p><p>Triple Explosion!</p><p>Piao Yuan felt extremely desperate, but he still struggled to make an explosion of the Dan Stage and suddenly raised his arm to block Lin Que’s attack.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Being totally suppressed by Lin Que’s series of actions to borrow force, Piao Yuan shook his body, trying to retreat.</p><p>As soon as he took a step back, Piao Yuan suddenly realized that he was going to lose the match however he struggled. So without hesitation, he gathered all of his Qi in his Dantian to pull himself back and then pounced forward toward Lin Que.</p><p>At that moment, Lin Que finished the gathering and realizing of his Qi and force in a short instant, and then stepped heavily onto the ground!</p><p>Outside of Piao Yuan’s expectations, Lin Que did not launch a new attack. Instead, he used the Earth Cracking of the Fighting Sect!</p><p>Four consecutive explosions!</p><p>Poom!</p><p>As if there were a volcanic eruption within the ring, all of the tiles on the ground were broken and sent flying upward. Piao Yuan’s feet were injured by the tiles and thus he lost his balance just at the moment he was about to pounce forward with the explosion of the Dan Stage.</p><p>After stepping once onto the ground, Lin Que took the opportunity to flash to Piao Yuan’s side. Noticing that Piao Yuan had missed his target and lost his balance, Lin Que drove the Qi in his Dantian and threw his arm fiercely at his opponent.</p><p>Five consecutive explosions!</p><p>He was indeed a Seventh-Pin fighter!</p><p>In the face of Lin Que’s attack, Piao Yuan was frightened and hurried to lower the center of his gravity by bending his back, which helped him pounce onto the ground as a Lazy Donkey Rolling!</p><p>Of course, Lin Que would not miss this opportunity. Straightening his knees, he strode forward to catch up to Piao Yuan.</p><p>After making several rolls, Piao Yuan felt the wind that was caused by great force blowing at his back. At that urgent moment, he suddenly recalled a scene that had left a deep impression on him, which encouraged him to pick up two handfuls of rubble and throw them at the chaser.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>All the rubble was flying at Lin Que’s face like bullets!</p><p>Lin Que again came to an abrupt stop. While his muscles were still shaking, he caught the flying stone when it was about to touch his face, and the stone was still spinning in his palm!</p><p>Taking this opportunity, Piao Yuan stood up with Carp Jumping Moves.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lin Que threw the stone at Piao Yuan backhanded, and the latter hurried to bend to dodge it in a difficult position.</p><p>Sliding towards Piao Yuan, Lin Que launched a fierce attack with the Meteor Force!</p><p>His arm swung at a high speed and suddenly punched somewhere between Piao Yuan’s chest and abdomen.</p><p>Having no time to take any other actions, Piao Yuan stretched out both arms to block Lin Que’s attack.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>He was shocked greatly as if he was hit by a cannon, and the shock even awakened the injury within his body that was caused by Lou Cheng in the last round.</p><p>As if a bell was ringing in his mind, Piao Yuan felt dizzy and blood rushed to his throat.</p><p>He still struggled to defuse the shock with Force Concentration, but the inner injury prevented him from taking action in time before Lin Que’s fist arrived at his throat.</p><p>The referee lifted his right arm and announced loudly,</p><p>“Round Three, Lin Que wins!”</p><p>In the seats of the Songcheng University Martial Arts Club, Yan Zheke smiled and then turned her gaze toward Lou Cheng.</p><p>“The scene just now was so familiar!”</p><p>Cheng had once used Blowing Sand into the Eyes to dodge Wei Shengtian’s attack and pull himself through that urgent moment.</p><p>It surprised her that Piao Yuan had also done so just now!</p><p>But the result was different.</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed.</p><p>“Totally different. I was in no hurry to stand up after using the Blowing Sand into the Eyes then. Instead, I approached Wei Shengtian to fight hand-to-hand against him, which finally helped me to turn the tables.</p><p>“However good this coward may be at using Carp Jumping Moves, he lacks the courage to fight to the bitter end, and naturally, he can’t save himself.”</p><p>Was it the so-called “blindly copying others and making oneself look foolish”?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
