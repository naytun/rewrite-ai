This was especially true as Old Fellow Mu had limited strength. The fight ought to be simple. As long as he paid attention to all aspects of the situation and fought more carefully, it would not be a big deal even he was unlucky. His strength was enough to offset Old Fellow Mu’s supernatural ability.</p><p>“Come, I’ll lend you all my luck!” Yan Zheke’s gaze faltered and she opened her pink lips to respond. She then took the initiative to bump Lou Cheng’s fist again.</p><p>Placing his coat on the seat, Lou Cheng turned around to clap with his team members one by one.</p><p>“You’ll win for sure!” Li Mao, Sun Jian, and the other members shouted without concern.</p><p>Though they were confident in Lou Cheng, they could not help feeling nervous thinking of the strange and frightening way Lin Que lost as well as Old Fellow Mu’s past victories.</p><p>Fortunate people were all alike, while unfortunate people were all different in their own ways.</p><p>Lou Cheng gave a slight smile. He balled up his fist and waved, replying decisively,</p><p>“We’ll win for sure!”</p><p>…</p><p>Watching Lin Que fall, Lin Xiaozhi jumped up so excitedly that both the rosary in her hand and the cross in her palm swayed.</p><p>“Team leader is so awesome!” She had once again tied her hair into a ponytail, shouting with clear happiness.</p><p>He really did not fail her expectations!</p><p>Jin Dali was also waving his fist in excitement and asked, as if asking for validation, “Our leader probably didn’t expend a lot of his strength, right?”</p><p>He had blocked Lin Que’s Dan stage explosion only once, and he did not even use brute force to resist it!</p><p>“Yes, looks like he can go all out to fight Lou Cheng!” Lin Xiaozhi nodded, her ponytail swaying behind her.</p><p>Misfortune was truly an amazing supernatural ability!</p><p>Thinking of this, she looked down to once again check if she has forgotten any amulets or if she brought some wrong ones.</p><p>Misery usually went hand-in-hand with happiness!</p><p>…</p><p>In the stands, Mu Jinnian who had been shouting excitedly now looked dejected and was pouting.</p><p>“Isn’t this too much of a coincidence?”</p><p>“Isn’t he cheating?”</p><p>In her mind, she dared Mu Yu to fight without his supernatural ability! If he had the guts, he should fight Lin Que purely using martial arts!</p><p>He made Lin Que lose this match too pitifully!</p><p>While Mu Jinnian was complaining unreasonably, Yan Xiaoling began to feel nervous. All sorts of scenarios where Lou Cheng was unlucky flashed in her mind.</p><p>“He’s in the arena! Everyone, hurry up and regard yourselves as his lucky stars from now on!” She posted her appeal in the live broadcast chat.</p><p>“I’ll take the lead!” Unparalleled Dragon King tried to make a joke.</p><p>“Uncle, what do you mean? I don’t understand… ” Yan Xiaoling replied in puzzlement.</p><p>The audience around her once again regained their enthusiasm and became eager to see the outcome of this match.</p><p>There was only one fighter left in both teams, so why not let them anticipate victory?</p><p>Though Lou Cheng was a skilled martial arts fighter, any accident could happen when both fighters were in tip-top condition. More importantly, his opponent’s ability Misfortune could increase the probability of these accidents.</p><p>Old Fellow Mu was not good at creating miracles, but he was skilled at dragging his opponent’s strength to his level.</p><p>They did not have much hope to win, but who knew? What if?</p><p>The audience screamed, creating a wave of rolling echo.</p><p>“Win him! Win him!”</p><p>“Win him! Win him!”</p><p>Lou Cheng ignored the rising waves of screams and walked steadily along the road to the arena. He met Lin Que halfway there.</p><p>Lin Que’s expression was neutral without any indication of pain, but he seemed to be deep in thought. He bumped fists with Lou Cheng simply out of habit.</p><p>What, this did not seem like the Brother-in-law he knew! With Lin Que’s persistent desire for victory, he ought to be feeling disappointed and dejected right now. Lou Cheng was surprised at his attitude.</p><p>But in another moment, he immediately understood why. If he was Lin Que and lost a match without any rhyme or reason, he would also not feel pain. He would start evaluating why he lost so he could avoid making the same mistakes again.</p><p>Brother-in-law ought to be thinking something along these lines.</p><p>Just as they were about to separate, Lin Que suddenly said,</p><p>“There’s no problem as long as you’re a little more careful.”</p><p>As expected… When Lou Cheng verified his thoughts, he laughed.</p><p>“Don’t worry!”</p><p>Ending their conversation, he walked past Lin Que and headed towards the stone steps. As he walked, Lou Cheng’s momentum gradually accumulated as a brutal snowstorm swept the arena, making Mu Yu fall into a sudden delusion that the surrounding temperature had dropped sharply. He subconsciously shuddered.</p><p>When he stood before Mu Yu, Lou Cheng’s momentum has already become as strong as the sea. Without even needing to launch any attacks, Lou Cheng was already weakening his opponent’s wrath and affecting his judgment.</p><p>The referee looked at them carefully and raised his right hand. He announced aloud,</p><p>“Round five. Begin!”</p><p>Instead of taking the initiative to attack, Lou Cheng chose to be careful. He cautiously observed his surroundings to make sure he everything on the arena and his own physical condition were within his grasp. He kept calm to prevent any accidents.</p><p>Mu Yu unleashed his supernatural ability without any reservation. He ran in circles like a crane, approaching his opponent.</p><p>But his right foot got caught abruptly on the ground, forcing him to involuntarily fall forward!</p><p>There was, of course, more than one spot of soft ground that Lin Que had stepped on earlier!</p><p>Before misfortune could befall Lou Cheng, Mu Yu first experienced this disappointing trap.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>With his right leg failing to reach the ground and his body falling forward, he realized he was about to kneel at Lou Cheng. He quickly bounced his spine and used the force in his muscles to pull the center of his gravity back in place.</p><p>He pulled a little too hard this time. Though he did not fall forward, he ended up bending backwards and taking a few steps back instead.</p><p>Tear! When he was moving back, Mu Yu was too confused to not notice that he was stepping on the slippery traces Lin Que made when he was sliding to kick Jin Dali.</p><p>Sliding, his left leg slipped backward, forcing him into a split.</p><p>Then he heard the sound of cloth tearing, a sweet and stirring sound.</p><p>Tear!</p><p>His pant was torn apart, revealing a crimson color underneath.</p><p>Lou Cheng stood still and stared at this scene with his mouth open. The situation was so weird that he did not even dare to attack for fear of falling into a trap.</p><p>“What’s going on exactly?” Lou Cheng was confused.</p><p>Mu Yu stood there firmly amidst the chaos. When he glanced down at his boxer briefs, his face became as red as his underpants. Several thoughts crossed his mind.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>Was his martial arts suit finally reaching its limit after wearing it for almost half a year?</p><p>What was the reason behind this series of mishaps?</p><p>“How is it possible?” Lin Xiao was holding her cross, watching the arena in a daze. She did not understand what had happened.</p><p>The one who was unlucky was actually her leader, not Lou Cheng!</p><p>She glanced shyly at Mu Yu’s crimson boxer briefs and a thought suddenly came to her mind.</p><p>Well, her leader also believed in metaphysics!</p><p>“How is it possible?” Jin Dali rubbed his eyes, suspecting Lin Que had knocked him unconscious and he was currently in a dream.</p><p>“How is it possible?” Yan Zheke stared at the arena with her mouth wide open. She was rarely this unladylike.</p><p>The Bane himself became unlucky instead of Cheng!</p><p>Does such a thing like ray of moral light really exists?</p><p>“How is it possible?” Touching his chin, Cai Zongming abruptly gave Li Mao a punch.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Li Mao snapped into focus and looked at him.</p><p>He was not dreaming… Cai Zongming grinned and said,</p><p>“Don’t you find the situation very strange?”</p><p>“Yes, it’s very strange. Could it be that Bane’s boomerang has come early? But doesn’t his boomerang only affect others?” Li Mao had forgotten that Cai Zongming had punched him earlier.</p><p>How could it happen… Lin Que frowned. He rarely felt puzzled. However, Geezer Shi beside him nodded as if he knew the reason.</p><p>How was it possible… The audience in the stands were all stunned and confused. They even suspected it was a masquerade. The man wearing Lou Cheng’s face actually was the leader Mu Yu and the unlucky one was Lou Cheng with Old Fellow Mu’s face.</p><p>The audience had the time to sigh or be surprised, but Mu Yu did not. If Lou Cheng approached him while he was still stuck in a split, he could only block his attacks two or three times!</p><p>With so many thoughts in his mind, he made a quick decision to lie down and roll to the other side, hiding his killer move, the Silent Kick.</p><p>Lou Cheng merely watched and did not blindly attack. He still had not figured out what was going on or if Mu Yu’s supernatural ability could affect him. Of course he had to be cautious.</p><p>Mu Yu was relieved that his opponent did not take the opportunity to attack him. He stopped rolling and exerted force into his waist and abdomen. He was seemingly trying to stand so he could fight Lou Cheng again.</p><p>Just then, a few round stones that he accidentally dragged with him as he rolled stopped where he stood.</p><p>Tear! Mu Yu once again slipped, falling before he could straighten his back. He fell heavily on his back, to the point where his head was dizzy.</p><p>He rolled to the side again in a flurry to avoid Lou Cheng’s attack.</p><p>Lou Cheng was watching Mu Yu’s ‘performance’, face twitching. He has almost forgotten he was still on the arena.</p><p>What was he was trying to do?</p><p>After rolling several times, Mu Yu suddenly found himself over the edge of the arena. More than half of him was outside the arena and floating mid-air!</p><p>Shocked, he tried to straighten the fascia muscle in his palm and stretched his five fingers out to hold onto the arena. But it was too late. In the end, his fingertips only grazed the edge of the arena.</p><p>Flop! Mu Yu fell down on the ground next to the arena, stunned and confused.</p><p>He was the only one shocked. So was Lou Cheng, whose mouth was open in surprise. He almost blurted out, “What the hell!”</p><p>He did not even attack once and he already won?</p><p>Never mind that. He did not even move an inch since the match started!</p><p>The referee was dazed for a while, before glanced at Lou Cheng with a stunned expression. He raised his right hand to announce,</p><p>“Round five, Lou Cheng wins!”</p><p>“The final result is that Songcheng University Martial Arts Club wins!”</p><p>Dang! The cross in Lin Xiaozhi’s hand fell to the ground. She murmured to herself, surprised, “This metaphysical isn’t right…. Yes, that’s right. If it’s something people can understand, it won’t be called metaphysics… ”</p><p>“God has taken the wrong script, right?” Jin Dali blurted out as if he was in a dream.</p><p>The audience in the stands looked at one other with confusion. So far, they were not feeling the pain of failure.</p><p>They may have been watching a fake match!</p><p>This could be considered as one of the incredible events on campus, right? The Bane, famous for making his opponents experience misfortune, defeated himself in a match where his opponent did even make a move at all!</p><p>A shocked Cai Zongming gradually opened his mouth to say, “This is the strangest match I’ve ever seen… ”</p><p><em>So far!</em></p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
