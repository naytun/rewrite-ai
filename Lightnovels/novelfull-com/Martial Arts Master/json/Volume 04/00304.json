He was in a great mood as he headed towards the martial arts arena, preparing to join the new school semesters first special training.</p><p>Feeling the gaze of each and every new classmate, he couldn’t help but sigh and think to himself,</p><p><em>It’s been a long time since I’ve gotten this kind of attention!</em></p><p><em>“It feels good to be back at school and displaying our affection like this.”</em></p><p>“What are you laughing at?” Yan Zheke’s elegant eyebrows moved slightly as she shot him a doubtful glance.</p><p>Lou Cheng snickered, then said, “I’m so proud of myself, I have my own fairy!”</p><p>“Ugh… ” Yan Zheke laughed despite herself. She felt like Cheng really was a secret charmer. The longer she got along with him, the more she could sense this.</p><p>Her spirits were soaring. The sky was blue, and the wind was clear.</p><p>Bantering back and forth in this way, the two of them reached the arena. They headed through the entrance and saw a few figures that shouldn’t have been here at this time.</p><p>One of them was a woman wearing a white shirt on the inside, draped over by a light gray western style suit, complemented with a skirt that accentuated her graceful figure. Her short hair was perfectly cropped, giving off a cool and intelligently beautiful aura. There stood the Songcheng University television station reporter who had interviewed the martial arts club quite a few times before, Shu Rui. There was a small team beside her, busily preparing for the recording.</p><p>Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke stared at one another and saw the same question in each other’s eyes. Without having to say anything, they released each other’s hands in order to avoid being recorded by the cameras as they walked in.</p><p>“Hi, Lou Cheng!” Shu Rui said while she looked all around her as if she’d suddenly discovered an old friend. Then she immediately waved in excitement.</p><p>“Reporter Shu, you’ve come this early for an interview?” Lou Cheng asked curiously as he walked over.</p><p>Yan Zheke followed behind with her hands behind her back, and her ears pricked up.</p><p>Shu Rui’s dimples appeared as she smiled and said, “Not an interview. I’m here to record a program.”</p><p>“Record a program?” Lou Cheng blurted in astonishment.</p><p>What here was worthy of recording a program?</p><p>Exposing her upper teeth, Shu Rui said, “You and Lin Que have matured up until this point today. You’re considered the finest in the entire university martial arts circle. Song Cheng University Martial Arts Club certainly can advance to the District level, perhaps we can even hope to strike out into the semifinals. It’s the focal point of everyone’s interest lately. Haha, I must first say congratulations.”</p><p>“Since we represent the Song Cheng University Television Station, how could we possibly let this story slip by? Our leader’s already approved for me to come and do a special program.”</p><p>“Special?” said Lou Cheng as mulled over this word. Confusion could also be seen on Yan Zheke’s face.</p><p>Shu Rui chuckled lightly, “It’s just a kind of documentary program. Starting from now until just before next April, I’ll be coming over every once in a while to film some things, such as your special training, exercise drills, preparing for matches, warm-ups, competitions, and just ordinary daily life. Through all of these aspects, we’ll be able to develop your true appearance. Once we’ve got all those materials, we’ll be able to put out a special story to help encourage you all as you join the national competition.”</p><p>“So it’s that kind of program… ” Lou Cheng thought for a moment and said, “Sounds really interesting.”</p><p>“I’ve done a survey, many people are quite interested.” Shu Rui responded with her eyes beaming.</p><p><em>This program was my plan, all mine!</em></p><p>Yan Zheke cracked a smile and observed this silently. She could practically see Reporter Shu’s tail wagging in pride.</p><p>“We’ll try to cooperate as much as possible.” Lou Cheng politely responded, then pointed over to the other fighters, “I’m going to go join them first.”</p><p>“Oh, no need to rush! Since you’re here, can you give me two sentences, even just one, just one sentence. Classmate Yan, wait a moment and you can also say something!” Shu Rui made the video camera point at Lou Cheng, and Yan Zheke moved to the side with great agility.</p><p>“Fine.” Lou Cheng was already well experienced in this area and was no longer a novice.</p><p>Shu Rui giggled, then said, “Just relax, pretend we were chatting like a moment ago when I greeted you. Hi, Lou Cheng, you’ve arrived quite early!”</p><p>“It’s not early Reporter Shu, you’re all here too.” Lou Cheng joked.</p><p>“You’re in a good mood! You seem quite relaxed and full of energy. Do you have a definite goal when it comes to the National University Martial Arts Competition?” Shu Rui asked with a smile.</p><p>“One should always aim high”, Lou Cheng answered wittily.</p><p>“I understand. I don’t want to hold up your special training, bye bye,” Shu Rui said, and waved her hand.</p><p>“Bye.” Lou Cheng stepped towards the other fighters, greeting Cai Zongming, Li Mao, Guo Qing, Sun Jian, Lin Hua, Jiang Fusheng, Li Xiaowen, Wu Meng and others.</p><p>As Yan Zheke was stopped by Shu Rui, she had no choice but to remain for a moment.</p><p>“Classmate Yan, you really are a beautiful girl, there’s no need to be worried about being in front of the lens without makeup or not having photoshop.” Shu Rui loosened into her everyday attitude as she began the interview.</p><p>“I’m not worried about that!” Yan Zheke innocently responded as she flashed a glance.</p><p>Shu Rui laughed, then said, “You haven’t been interviewed many times before, it makes it hard for me to avoid any misunderstandings!”</p><p>“That time I was a substitute. There was no need for me to steal the limelight,” Yan Zheke said stiffly.</p><p>“Then, being a substitute, is that what you are preparing for in University Martial Arts?” Shu Rui asked, returning to the topic.</p><p>Her eyes bright, Yan Zheke said, “That’s what I’m doing, but I still have a long ways to go. I’m hoping that before the District Contest I can approach the level of Professional Ninth Pin.”</p><p>She wasn’t modest, nor was she grandiose.</p><p>“Wow, that’d be amazing, I’m jealous!” With a gesture, Shu Rui said, “You can do it, Classmate Yan!”</p><p>“Thank you.” Yan Zheke turned politely and with a handsome figure, headed towards the group.</p><p>Just then, Lin Que brilliantly appeared from the locker room.</p><p>Shu Rui motioned to the cameraman to keep up as she marched forward, a nervous smile blooming on her face.</p><p>“Hi, Classmate Lin Que.”</p><p><em>Hopefully, he is in a good mood today.</em></p><p>“It’s you again.” Lin Que glanced at her.</p><p><em>“What does he mean by ‘again’?” Shu Rui’s mouth twitched upon hearing this.</em></p><p><em>Was he ridiculing the fact that I’ve been an ordinary reporter for more than a year? That I’m still interviewing the Song Cheng University Martial Arts Club?”</em></p><p><em>But being promoted for doing a job only a year isn’t very long! Especially since I’ve disregarded a few suggestions from the leader…</em></p><p>She drew her lips back and said with a cold smile, “Yes, it’s me again. I’m just an ordinary reporter. I have to make a living and the leader told me to do this, so all I can do is listen and reluctantly come over here.”</p><p>“You can do it.” Lin Que answered blankly as he walked past, not stopping as he went by the cameraman.</p><p><em>“You can do it? Just who in the hell is the interviewer here?!”</em> Shu Rui went lifeless for a moment.</p><p><em>This guy doesn’t make any sense!</em></p><p>A few minutes later, Geezer Shi arrived and the cameraman pointed at everyone.</p><p>“It’s been almost a year that we’ve known each other. I won’t talk nonsense. Instead, I’ll get straight to the point,” Geezer Shi said as he drank a mouthful of alcohol, “This semester we only have one objective. That’s to advance into the University Martial Arts Competition District Contest, and by next April go to the capital to join and pass through to the finals of the competition!”</p><p>Afterward, he coughed twice and glanced at Lou Cheng, “And to accomplish that objective, this old man has prepared some Internal Training Methods to give you all.”</p><p>“Internal Training Methods?” Li Mao blurted out, half frightened and half excited.</p><p>Cai Zongming was also shocked. He, Lou Cheng, Guo Qing, and others glanced at each other, their faces full of disbelief.</p><p>Things such as Internal Training Methods were priceless!</p><p>Other than dealing with a sect or an outstanding Martial Arts School, there were only three definite and precise channels to get access to Internal Training Methods. One was to join a professional competition and obtain it as a reward. The second was to set up a contribution fund and receive one from the government. The third was to dedicate oneself, slowly accumulate bit by bit, and then trade with the Martial Artist Association. Ordinarily many that circulated throughout the marketplace were fake, and furthermore, the government as well as the Martial Arts circles both detested businesses that caused Internal Training Methods to become widespread, simply for the sake of maintaining their own interests.</p><p>In other words, when a fighter with no inheritance obtained Internal Training Methods, it would be OK for him to use them to teach his disciples or even sell to someone. But if he sold to more than one man, he would be given a warning. This whole thing was technically a continuation of corrupt customs in the martial arts circle.</p><p>From the time Chu Weicai first opened a Martial Arts School until now, it had not been possible to obtain an Internal Training Method. That just goes to show how difficult it is.</p><p>Of course, this difficulty was only universal in regards to fighters.</p><p>After Li Mao entered meditation, he himself felt that within a year he could obtain the Professional Ninth Pin qualification. Now he was a fourth year student and finding a job was of higher importance. Occasionally he would fantasize about going through a Martial Arts Club competition and obtaining an Inner Training Method reward. If that happened, he could possibly become a Ninth Pin in less than six months, play through a few games, and then open a small martial arts school in his own hometown!</p><p>However, if he was honest with himself, he also felt that this didn’t seem truly attainable. However, at this very moment, the Inner Training Method was clear and vivid, right in front of his eyes.</p><p>How could this not make him excited? How could he not be ecstatic? He wanted to cry out for Coach Shi to live long and prosper!</p><p>Cai Zongming also felt this way. Even though Classmate Talker’s family was well off, he didn’t have any contacts in the martial arts world. After he had achieved meditation, he had tried to obtain Inner Training Methods, but they’d all ended in ignoble defeat. After school had started, he wanted to find Cheng and speak to him about this to see if he had any connections.</p><p><em>To beat this age and have Inner Training Methods, I couldn’t say for sure if I’ll walk the path of Martial Arts, but I can definitely use it to charge out into my own life!</em></p><p>Sun Jian, Lin Hua, Wu Meng, Li Xiaowen, and others were exceptionally happy. Even though they had failed to achieve Solemn Silence, using Inner Training Methods to practice asceticism was essential. In addition to the other content, it could possibly allow them to save time with physical practice. For example, Li Xiaowen’s goal before was to be at an Amateur Third Pin level by the time she graduated and obtain a good certification. Now she was looking forward to the semi-finals where she could obtain this qualification.</p><p>After having this, one’s life would be completely different.</p><p>“What’s wrong? You don’t want it?” Geezer Shi mumbled kiddingly.</p><p>“We want it!” Li Mao, Cai Zongming and others responded in unison, their spirits high and their faces beaming with joy.</p><p>Seeing their reaction, Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke glanced at each other, their hearts filled with a sense of satisfaction and pride.</p><p><em>Even though they don’t know the inner training methods come from me and they all show gratitude to Geezer Shi, I still feel very good from the bottom of my heart.</em></p><p>Hahaha, was this what it felt like to enjoy some good karma after doing a good deed?</p><p>Shu Rui watched, full of exhilaration, and made the cameraman record the proceedings.</p><p>In the following refining exercises, they recorded quite a few images of the team. They also went outside to film some environmental material, then afterwards they came back in and prepared to take their leave.</p><p>Just then, Geezer announced that they were going to begin pair exercise drills.</p><p>According to their usual groups, Lou Cheng found Yan Zheke and talked for a moment about the recording of the program, but he saw an expressionless Lin Que approaching. Lin Que stared and said darkly,</p><p>“Let’s fight to learn from each other.”</p><p>It was as if two flames were burning in the depths of his eyes, and an intense fight would set them ablaze!</p><p>Lou Cheng thought about his brother-in-law’s pride and how he couldn’t accept a loss, so he was confident Lin Que would take the initiative and ask to fight to learn from each other. Due to this, he wasn’t in the slightest bit surprised. He chuckled, then said,</p><p>“Alright.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
