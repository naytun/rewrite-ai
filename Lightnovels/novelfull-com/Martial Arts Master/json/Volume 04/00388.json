She glared at him, annoyed and amused and complained silently with her lips,</p><p><em>“Pervert!”</em></p><p><em>“How come Cheng suddenly began to tease?</em></p><p><em>“How embarrassing it would be to kiss in front of so many people?</em></p><p><em>“Is it really like what is written in those books that a man will become aroused and secrete more hormones after a fierce fight?</em> ”</p><p>While she was thinking about it seriously, Lou Cheng added with a grin,</p><p>“The little fairy encouraging herself is too cute. I can’t resist.”</p><p>“Ahh… ” Yan Zheke got it, shy and pleased. She eyed him with a secret smile.</p><p>“Go ahead and think about it.”</p><p>“Only thinking?” Lou Cheng burst into a laugh and almost moved forward to plant a kiss on her cheek. He glanced about and saw cameras on them, capturing images of the victors. He forced himself to resist the temptation.</p><p>…</p><p>In Huahai University Martial Arts Club’s seating area, Ann Chaoyang heaved a silent sigh after glancing at the disheartened Piao Yuan and low-spirited Xing Jingjing. He clapped and put on a wry smile.</p><p>“What is it? Are we eliminated already?</p><p>“Losing to Songcheng University is not the end of the world. We still have a good chance. We might get Guangnan in the quarter-finals. We have a one-third opportunity getting them from the draw.</p><p>“Even if we got Shanbei or Capital, we will not be doomed to a defeat. We don’t have many options, but we can fight all out with our backs to the river!”</p><p>Listening to Brother An’s words and thinking about him leaving the martial arts club after this tournament, Piao Yuan and Zhang Dongliang were suddenly filled with emotions and passion.</p><p>They exchanged a glance and shouted in chorus,</p><p>“Fight all out with our backs to the river!”</p><p>Standing a bit far from them, Xing Jingjing kept her mouth closed, but there were emotions in her eyes and her fists grasped tightly.</p><p>…</p><p>In the studio, host Liu Chang commented with a tinge of emotion,</p><p>“Congratulations, Songcheng University, for advancing into the top eight. A seat in the top four is not far. Good luck, Huahai. I hope you guys can continue in the tournament further.”</p><p>“This is martial arts. Everyone is becoming better, and a championship doesn’t grant you any privilege,” responded Chen Sansheng. “I didn’t expect Ann Chaoyang to bid his farewells to this tournament and the university martial arts circle like this.”</p><p>Liu Chang was obviously surprised. “Isn’t it too early to say that? What if Huahai meets Guangnan the next? They still have a chance.”</p><p>“Of course. Even if they get Shanbei or Capital the next, I’m sure they still have a chance. However, what can they do the next? More injuries? More exhaustion? How much could they recover by the semi-finals?” Chen Sansheng heaved a sigh. “A seat in the top four would be the best result for Huahai in this tournament. The very same results three years in a row for Ann Chaoyang. What a pity for him!”</p><p>Liu Chang continued in the emotional tone of a professional host, “That’s right. Huahai University under An Chaoyang’s reign has come to an end, but Huahai will go on with many capable fighters. Piao Yuan and Xing Jingjing in their third year, Zhang Dongliang in his second year, and the freshman Liu Yuntao. They will begin a new era and rise again next year.”</p><p>A wry smile climbed on Chen Sansheng’s face.</p><p>“I want to be honest with you. I know it might hurt the feelings of students from Huahai, but the truth is the truth… Huahai’s team-building is pretty decent with capable fighters in each year. However, there is a saying about being born at wrong times.”</p><p>“Peng Leyun and Ren Li are in their third year, and Lou Cheng and Lin Que are only sophomores. Piao Yuan, Xing Jingjing, and Zhang Dongliang were born at wrong times.”</p><p>“If it was a few years earlier or later, they would be capable enough to shine in the university martial arts circle. However, these days, there are nine suns blazing in the sky. How can they shine?”</p><p>Liu Chang sighed. “That reminds me of one phrase. I better keep it to myself.”</p><p>“One should fight for his own destiny, but the historical process can’t be denied. Piao Yuan and Xing Jingjing are apparently in a good but brutal era.”</p><p>“There is someone setting the bar, making up examples, passing on experience, and providing challenges. The university martial arts circle is becoming better, and many not-so-promising amateur fighters are inspired and provoked to attend professional competitions and live a completely different life.”</p><p>“The harsh part about it is that they can only serve as a foil.”</p><p>“Sigh… No matter what, I wish Ann Chaoyang the best. I hope he will shine brighter in his new chapter in life!” said Chen Sansheng genuinely. “The duo of Lou Cheng and Lin Que have displayed their outstanding performance. They have a great chance of winning the championship this year. I would say they are the third favorite for the title, only after Shanbei and Capital.”</p><p>Liu Chang giggled. “I can’t wait to see the quarter-final matches draws.”</p><p>“That will determine the semi-final match table!”</p><p>“Just the thought of it makes my blood boil!”</p><p>“Two more days of wait. Anyway, congratulations, Songcheng University, for advancing into the top eight as the head of the group!” said Chen Sansheng with his fist grasped gently. “Lou Cheng is indeed one of the Heavenly Sons.”</p><p>…</p><p>In Lou Cheng’s fan forum, Yan Xiaoling, Eternal Nightfall, published a celebration post.</p><p>“A battle to rewrite our name!”</p><p>She didn’t have the opportunity to be the first one to reply to her own post because Brahman got it with a firecracker.</p><p>“Victory! Victory! Victory!”</p><p>“Don’t you have more things to say?” replied All Good Names Are Taken By Dogs with the same emoji. “Victory! Victory! Victory! Victory! Victory! Double!”</p><p>“Upstairs, your math teacher would be mad,” Unparalleled Dragon King joked.</p><p>Yan Xiaoling coughed. “Calm down. Everybody, calm down. Wherever you are, calm down. Let’s get ready for the first-hand report from our journalist Gao from the front. Hmm… I’m so excited that I feel hungry. I need a moment to think about what food I have in my dorm room… ”</p><p>“Why not order some takeaway?” asked Road to the Arena in disbelief.</p><p>“I’ll have to go downstairs to get it if I order takeaway… ” Yan Xiaoling was very honest about how lazy she was.</p><p>“I have difficulties understanding girls in their teens… ” sighed Road to the Arena.</p><p>Many Cats finally published a post.</p><p>“Lou Cheng and Lin Que just finished their post-match interview. They are in the bathroom taking a shower right now. I can hear singing among the water sounds. ‘This mountain road has 18 curves’… Well, I’m not telling you who is singing for Lou Cheng’s privacy since I don’t want my ass kicked.</p><p>“During the entire interview, Lin Que said only three words: Hmm, yes, and no, which is a new record for himself. To be honest, I really miss the interaction between journalist Shu and him.</p><p>“Coach Shi is on the phone with someone unknown. His face is beaming with joy, his brows dancing and his spirits high…</p><p>“Sister Yan is playing with her mobile with a beautiful smile. I guess she’s laughing at your clowning around. She has some specially made ointment next to her, waiting for Lou Cheng to show off their love. They are going to kill us single dogs. Don’t ask me how a cat can be a single dog.</p><p>“Brother Sun Jian and Brother Li Mao are discussing their possible rivals in the coming quarter-final match, who will get the opportunity to fight, and how they should spend their bonus money… ”</p><p>The national university martial arts tournament was watched and followed by many, and its royalty check was much fatter than most professional preliminaries. Teams that failed to make it to the top eight would get enough to cover their flight tickets, accommodation, and food expenses. Once they advanced to the top eight, they would have extra to share with all the team members. The exact number, of course, would depend on their final achievement.</p><p>“That’s enough about them. What about you? Anything exciting besides reporting from the front?” asked Unparalleled Dragon King with a grin.</p><p>Many Cats blushed.</p><p>“I’m working on my shopping cart and waiting for my share of the bonus money!”</p><p>…</p><p>To celebrate their advance with the best result from their group and to prepare for the quarter-finals, Geezer Shi generously granted a day off tomorrow and treated all members to a dinner of crayfish with their public fund.</p><p>It was almost 10:30 when they arrived at the hotel after dinner. Lou Cheng walked Yan Zheke to her room and bade his farewells while noises from their team members were still echoing in the corridor.</p><p>“Talker didn’t come up?” asked Yan Zheke casually so she didn’t have to say goodbye yet.</p><p>“His girlfriend is coming to visit. He must wait on his knees at the entrance.” Lou Cheng poked fun at Ming.</p><p>After some small talk, Yan Zheke checked her watch and smiled.</p><p>“Aren’t you ready for bed? The Sedative and Brain-invigorating Fluid is not as good as a sound, deep sleep.”</p><p>“Sure.” Lou Cheng rubbed his swollen temples and waved goodbye when some stranger passed by.</p><p>When he was about to turn around, Yan Zheke looked left and right, with light glittering in her eyes. She said in an almost whispering manner,</p><p>“Didn’t you say you want to kiss me?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
