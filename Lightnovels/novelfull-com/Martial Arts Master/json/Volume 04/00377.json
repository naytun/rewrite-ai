Accompanied with his silhouette flying out like a shooting star, it was enough to make Liu Chang and Chen Sansheng stupefied as they watched the live broadcast, and scared He Erlong and He Santai half to death.</p><p><em>Lin Que has grasped the Attainment Formula!</em></p><p><em>Out of nowhere, he has grasped the Attainment Formula!</em></p><p><em>Is it possible for a fellow disciple of the same clique to acquire this kind of secret discipline?</em></p><p>Thinking about of this, He Erlong and He Santai’s pupils shrank into needle points. They were incapable of thinking, and their instincts had taken over.</p><p>It was as if they had instinctively perceived something and their Qi and Blood rushed forth in a split second. They exerted all of their strength, spirit, and life force and condensing it all into one single point.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Dan Stage rushed forth in a Volcanic Eruption. The two fighters’ figures bulged and the ground cracked beneath their feet as they stomped down. Their figures rose into the air like arrows shooting towards the clouds.</p><p>Rushing towards disaster, each of their strengths on their own was enough and they had no choice but to attempt to store their power, no choice but to proceed with the plan as originally scheduled!</p><p>The secret know-how of the Heaven and Secular World Sword Formation, Cloud Piercing Lightning Sword!</p><p>This was an explosive upgrade in speed from their previous studies. After allowing their fellow brother in the formation to disrupt the enemies’ flow and tempo, they each would have time to help and assist each other!</p><p>Previously, the He Brothers had twisted nimbly and rotated in successive order. From beginning to end, they had maintained their abilities. Even if Lou Cheng and Lin Que could catch up, they would just run into their strength and have no choice but to react first. It was hard to tangle with the enemy and then smoothly extricate yourself.</p><p>At Physical Invulnerability, or rather Training the inner radicular pulp to the Inhuman level, there could be a success with the inner radicular pulp. Warriors and other ambitious men who used the Vajra Body Defending Divine Skill to practice asceticism weren’t up to the task. When confronting a lower ranked enemy, you always had to be cautious and proceed gently to avoid losing the forest for the trees. If you were ever not cautious, the chances were high that you would be injured and even perhaps sustain an internal injury.</p><p>The great majority of fighters in this stage could be considered to have a strong offense and weak defense. They could create a mortal injury by hitting another person only two or three times, but the same would happen to them if they were attacked by another in the same manner. Of course, they could use Force Concentration to convert their defensive power into offensive strikes, but they were afraid they would be hit in the process. However, the He Brothers’ Swordplay was quite impressive, so there was no choice but to play defense, no choice but to avoid. Even if Lin Que employed the Yin-yang Twist, it would be the same.</p><p>Due to this and the previous rotations, the He Brothers had not only not used Cloud Piercing Lightning Sword, but they hadn’t even been able to fully use their Dan Stage explosions. They had primarily focused on conserving their energy and putting a wrench in their relatively weak enemies’ strategy.</p><p>Now, however, Lin Que’s unexpected Attainment Formula was perfectly in sync with Lou Cheng’s Army Formula. All at once, he had thrown the rule book out the window and had no choice but to hurriedly use all of his strength in a massive display of power!</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>The air was hit by the explosion from He Erlong and He Santai’s Electric Sword as it pierced the clouds. Their distance between each other was relatively small, and very soon they’d only be a short distance from their brother Lin Que in terms of ability. Unless Lin Que made a forced attack regardless of danger, he wouldn’t be able to take on He Yifang, who had nearly recovered from the Army Formula. However, if he went through this route, he not only would be leaving the arena, but there would be a real possibility of him sustaining an injury, enough to seriously influence future competitions.</p><p>In this moment, Lin Que, who was on the verge of creating a quick and terrible shadow sonic boom, halted just like he had done every time he had used Meteor Blast in the past.</p><p>There was an ear-piercingly shrill sound. He Erlong and He Santai had not thought that Lin Que would stop, and they threw themselves at empty space. Their opposition slid past them and took the initiative by moving to their side.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lin Que pulled back as if using an emergency brake to stop his momentum, and soon after, by channeling Force Concentration and Yin-yang Twist through the soles of his feet, stomped ferociously on the ground.</p><p>The 16th style of the Fighting Sect, Earth Cracking!</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The arena shook beneath them. He Erlong and He Santai didn’t have enough time to complete their Electric Sword movement before encountering this and couldn’t help but momentarily lose their balance. They hadn’t quite collided with their opponent, but they were in a worse position as since the Army Formula had been made, their opponents had seemingly sharpened their skills to a fine point and had reinstated their energy to no small degree. Small cracks had already split open beneath the soles of their feet and a “whooshing” sound rushed forth from the splintering rocks. Afterwards, his left foot rushed forth violently, and his entire body went backward, his head still reeling and his muscles trembling.</p><p>Lin Que stomped his foot and also borrowed some strength to jump, as if transforming into a bold and powerful falcon. He jumped towards the half-blocking He Erlong and He Santai, who were trembling in fear at the Army Formula, and stretched out his arms. Using the power that had been taken up by the “Earth Cracking” stance, he jumped, twisted in mid-air, and landed on the ground.</p><p>The judge beside them was immediately pulled to the side and was dizzily pulled around the arena, causing him to break away from the fight.</p><p>Pulled to the side, eliminated!</p><p>Lin Que had been very graceful just then. If he had truly unleashed his power, then the entire crowd would have been pulled to the side and you would have heard the sounds of their necks breaking and it would have felt like their brains had entered their chest!</p><p>He Erlong and He Santai knew that they couldn’t win, but they were unwilling to admit defeat, so they collided into one another and bounced off each other, tracing a treacherous arc towards Lin Que with the intention to take advantage of the fact that his stance had not yet settled. A chain of strikes, left and right pressed together, pressed into one.</p><p>But this time, a strange howling emerged behind their backs. An Enveloping Shadow was coming; Lin Que was approaching at high speed!</p><p>In the eyes of the crowd, after Lou Cheng had made the Army Formula, he’d postponed his own attack. Lin Que had hurriedly charged, stopped for a moment, then jumped and arrived in a flash.</p><p>The hair stood up on the back of their necks and shadows appeared beneath their feet. He Erlong and He Santai’s hearts trembled, and they didn’t dare continue their flanking attack on Lin Que. They shifted their balance, changed their footwork, and once again traced an arc, progressing into a high-speed interweaving.</p><p>However, without He Yifang, Lou Cheng and Lin Que could each lock into an opponent and pursue them to the end. There was no need to worry about sustaining any injuries from their dual twisting and turning attacks.</p><p>He Erlong and He Santai really were close. Two against two, who would be scared!?</p><p>It also wasn’t just the four of them in the arena. Yan Zheke, Lin Hua, Cai Zongming, and Li Mao had already fought hand to hand with Dan Stage Mighty Warriors multiple times. Their physical strength had been seriously depleted, but they still hadn’t reached their limits. They could still put up a fight.</p><p>Against this interference, a few seconds later, He Erlong and He Santai’s interweaving was gradually restricted, and the distance between them and Lou Cheng and Lin Que became shorter and shorter.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lin Hua summoned his remaining strength, quickly thrust out his leg, and nimbly kicked forward, forcing He Erlong to change direction.</p><p>Using Mercurial Balance, He Erlong pulled back his spine just in time and dodged to Lin Hua’s left side.</p><p>However, Yan Zheke was already waiting for him. With a small hop and a skip, she lowered her shoulder and unleashed an explosive Burst Fist towards his abdomen.</p><p>After quickly sucking in a mouthful of air, He Erlong quickly sucked in the pit of his stomach and continued to move horizontally, attempting to bypass Yan Zheke.</p><p>However, with this kind of delay, Lou Cheng had already caught up to him and, with the force of his Qi and Blood, unleashed a vigorous Dan Stage Strike towards his legs. With extreme speed, he also kicked at his right foot fast enough to nearly create a phantom trace.</p><p>Once again, He Erlong was unable to dodge and he focused on Force Concentration. His legs suddenly bulged and he violently kicked to the side.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He Erlong was directly kicked to the side, and he quickly recovered his Qi and Blood with the Double Explosion. Lou Cheng used his rebound power and channeled it into his own body’s Force Concentration, mixing the Brutal Blizzard and Dan Stage explosion.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>His fist rushed forward like a hammer, and He Erlong promptly braced himself by putting his arms and shoulders together.</p><p>He pulled back one step, and then another. He Erlong repeatedly fell back and then centred himself. Frustrated, Lou Cheng once again collected his Qi and threw another punch, ferociously pouncing forward to take advantage of his opponent recently losing his stance. His right hand stretched forward like lightning, grasping towards his opponent’s shoulder.</p><p>Qi and Blood, spirit, and strength were again all one. Lou Cheng’s body swelled, his back twisted, and he grasped He Erlong. Extending his arm, he then took his opponent and threw him!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He Erlong’s feet landed on the ground. Stupefied, he was standing outside of the arena!</p><p>When it came down to it, Lou Cheng’s consecutive strikes and Brutal Blizzard styles joined together were enough to make any Seventh Pin or Eighth Pin Dan Stage fighter doubt themselves!</p><p>In addition, Li Mao’s fist became like a whip through his grandiose “Mega Avalanche”. The instant He Santai changed his stance, he thrust forward and was very near to Cai Zongming’s proximity.</p><p>Little Ming’s back bowed slightly and his right arm stretched forward to block. Tangled together, his left fist rushed towards He Santai’s Dantian.</p><p>At this kind of distance, He Santai simply couldn’t dodge and could only shift his shoulder and violently raise his arm. Just in time, he stretched his fist and rested it on his lower abdomen.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>As Cai Zongming hit, he could feel his opponents Qi and Blood, spirit, and strength all coalescing together, to the extent that it felt as if he was hitting a single point.</p><p>He Santai had just done Force Concentration and had heard a loud booming sound behind him. It was like he had felt an explosion at the bottom of the soles of his feet that were resting on the arena, causing him to violently sway back and forth.</p><p>Lin Que had already done the Fighting Sect’s Earth Cracking!</p><p>Bam! His Qi released and he subconsciously threw his feet down and pressed against the cracks and cracked, flying bricks in the ground, maintaining his body’s balance.</p><p>Bang! Li Mao caught up and leaned to the side, threw out his elbow horizontally, and hit He Santai directly in the spine. Cai Zongming spread his fingers, his fist wide open. Relying on his joints and tendons, he struck twice, as quick as a bullet, pressing down on He Santai’s stomach and sticking to his clothing like glue!</p><p>Ahead there were wolves, and behind there were tigers. Furthermore, Cai Zongming had already dissolved his Force Concentration. He Santai could only draw in a breath of air and watch as the judge made his decision. The crowd blasted their vuvuzelas as he heard:</p><p>“The final result, Songcheng University Martial Arts Club wins!”</p><p>During special competition format, there was more than one judge.</p><p>…</p><p>“The final result, Songcheng University Martial Arts Club wins!”</p><p>Accompanied by the judge’s announcement, the crowd cheered and cried all around.</p><p>…</p><p>“The final result, Song Cheng University Martial Arts Club wins!”</p><p>In the live broadcast, ever since Lin Que had taken the Attainment Formula, the speechless and stupefied presenter, Liu Chang, and special guest Chen Sansheng had finally come to their senses.</p><p>“Brilliant! I’d never thought Lin Que would say anything like that!” Liu Chang said, full of emotion.</p><p>“I know, who would’ve thought?!” Chen Sansheng said in a complicated tone.</p><p>Liu Chang thought for a moment, and with rising doubts said, “Now that Lin Que has the Attainment Formula, why is it that he and Lou Cheng never cooperated like this before?”</p><p>“As for the matter of distance, the He Brothers are superior in this regard. They would be free from the influence of the Army Formula, and it was more convenient for them to help each other. Even though Lin Que had taken the Attainment Formula, he couldn’t necessarily grasp those two or three seconds to invade and attack the opposition’s spirit, let alone trap them,” Chen Sansheng explained in detail.</p><p>“No, no, no, I should say earliest,” Liu Chang hurriedly corrected himself.</p><p>“Earliest? At the earliest moment, was Lou Cheng not being attacked by the He Brothers? By turning over his hand and making the Army Formula, the He Brothers received the brunt of it. Lin Que figured that by taking the Attainment Formula, they wouldn’t be able to get the upper hand on them!” Chen Sansheng analyzed the beginning of the match.</p><p>Liu Chang shook his head and once more made a correction. “No, I should say at the beginning, when Lou Cheng used Burning Ice and Flame to stop the He brothers. At that time, as long as he made the Army Formula to control He Santai, He Erlong, and the other competitor to move their inertia forward, he could find a spare moment, an opening. Due to their distance being relatively small, it’d definitely influence them. Afterwards, Lin Que’s Attainment Formula would be enough to take care of He Santai. Have I not repeated what just happened?”</p><p>In other words, at that time, if Songcheng University had done things like this, the match would have been over in just a few seconds!</p><p>“This… ” Upon hearing this, Chen Sansheng was dumbstruck. He exerted all of his strength to try and come up with ways and factors that would have prevented Songcheng University from carrying things out in this way, but after a long while, he couldn’t come up with anything. All he could do was respond with, “Who knows what they were thinking?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
