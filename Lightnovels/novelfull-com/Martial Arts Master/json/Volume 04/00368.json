(Part Three)</p><p><strong>Translator:</strong> Transn <strong>Editor:</strong> Lucas</p><p>“The National Games!”</p><p>After the members of the Martial Arts Club shouted their cheer, Shu Rui asked the cameraman to stop recording. She then stood in front of the team and bent slightly over while smiling with emotion.</p><p>“Thank you sincerely for your care and cooperation over the past few months. For more than 40 days, we have to say goodbye to each other. Our team wishes you to make a great achievement in the National Games!”</p><p>Shu Rui was a gorgeous and reliable beauty. Neither did she behave very frigidly nor arrogantly. From early September until now, she always came to the martial arts club to film the daily lives of the team members except for holidays, so the members were getting more familiar with her and had developed a good relationship with her team. Therefore, when they heard what she said, all of them expressed their dismay and sad emotions.</p><p>With such an atmosphere, the first special training session of this semester started. Everyone in the martial arts club tried their best and worked hard to prepare for the National Games.</p><p>As the training was about to end, Lou Cheng laughed and, while seeing that Shu Rui was interviewing his teammates one by one, said to Yan Zheke,</p><p>“Suddenly, I have many expectations for the show they’ll put on.”</p><p>The moment Yan Zheke saw his smile, she recalled the scene that happened last night, so she could not help but turn away and purse her lips to give a snort of anger.</p><p><em>I’ve tried so hard to find the courage to become more proactive and to take the initiative to satisfy your desires, but how dare you, how dare…</em></p><p>She was too embarrassed to think about it.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Lou Cheng blurted out. But he immediately realized where her anger came from; he then wanted to slap his own face.</p><p>He could not afford to mention the pot that doesn’t boil!</p><p>“I just, just feel that I’m not pure anymore!” Yan Zheke actually was not angry, she just was too shy. After she settled down, she changed her attitude and decided to let this thing go. She looked down at her tiptoe and answered Lou Cheng in a slightly “plaintive” mood.</p><p>When she returned to her dormitory this morning to put back her luggage, she was too embarrassed to look directly into Dirty Tong’s eyes when he was talking with her.</p><p>“I think that a girl who has already been married or who has had a love relationship with her boyfriend for more than a year can’t be that pure,” Lou Cheng said with a smile.</p><p><em>Yes, we have been in a relationship for more than a year, to put it more specifically, it’s one year and one day!</em></p><p>Yan Zheke turned back and glared at him. When she saw that Shu Rui was approaching her, she changed the topic as soon as she could. “Cheng, didn’t you say that you were too nervous to take a picture of me the first time you approached me? How did my picture appear in that video last night?”</p><p>“When I was making the video, I thought that it would be a pity for me to miss that picture. However, I also couldn’t tell you in advance so that you could wear the traditional Chinese clothes and let me take another picture of you. I thought it over and over again and suddenly I realized that my fairy was so beautiful that someone else must have taken it. Therefore, I went to ask the people I knew one by one, and finally, I got that picture from our previous club manager, Chen Changhua,” Lou Cheng explained in detail.</p><p>Yan Zheke suddenly understood. “Oh, I see. At that time, Senior Brother Chen had asked me to pose for a picture because he wanted to save it among the other Martial Arts Club activities.”</p><p>Her eyebrows gradually stretched and she was about to laugh out loud because she once again felt Lou Cheng’s deep love for her.</p><p>After last night, she felt that she seemed to be more intimate with Cheng.</p><p>She had even touched such a private body part of his, so it seemed that secrets between them also became fewer.</p><p>At that moment, Shu Rui came toward them and began to interview Yan Zheke, mainly to ask her about the preparations for the National Games that she had made during the vacation.</p><p>Lou Cheng moved two steps back to stand beside Little Ming and did not intend to interrupt her interview.</p><p>Cai Zongming moved as if he was Hercules and said excitedly, “Cheng, I think that I’m about to achieve the Professional Ninth Pin!”</p><p>Lou Cheng looked him up and down, then he nodded with a light smile.</p><p>“Not bad.”</p><p>“Ah, why do you f**king show such an expression in your eyes and in your tone?” Cai Zongming glanced at him annoyedly.</p><p>“I only showed my care to you from my eyes and tone.” Lou Cheng laughed. He would not say that what he did was just like what a fighter of the Professional Sixth Pin would do to a fighter of the Professional Ninth Pin.</p><p>“To show your care to an idiot?” Cai Zongming answered him gruffly.</p><p>“That’s what you said, I never said it.” Lou Cheng replied to him “innocently”.</p><p>“Talker” actually was speechless at that moment!</p><p>Cai Zongming hurled out these two words when he found he was trapped by Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>When he saw that Lou Cheng was trying hard to stop laughing, he decided to change the topic, so he said,</p><p>“Ah, you came back to our dormitory in a rush this morning, so you must have done something bad last night. Both Qiang and Old Qiu are deeply stimulated by you.”</p><p>What he did on Valentine’s Day caused double hurt to those two single men!</p><p>“It can’t be that you took the bullet train back to school at night?” Lou Cheng asked him with a smile.</p><p>“Of course it can. But I still need to remind you as a predecessor, you should at first be well-prepared for sex whether there is a chance for you or not. Because when you are surprised to find that a girl has agreed to have sex with you, you then will be kicked out to look all around for a drugstore, supermarket, or a vending machine… ” Cai Zongming recalled an embarrassing scene in the past which happened like that.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s lips twitched and he said,</p><p>“Casanova, I think that you can write a book about your funny experience.”</p><p>“The encyclopedia of how to hurt single people?” Cai Zongming took a glance at Lou Cheng.</p><p>As they were talking like it was crosstalk, Shu Run finished her interview with Yan Zheke and stood in front of Lin Que. She at first laughed out loud before she said, “I come to interview you again.”</p><p>“Yes.” Lin Que still wore an emotionless expression on his face.</p><p>Shu Rui bent over toward him slightly before she smiled very gently and said,</p><p>“Looking forward to learning from you.”</p><p>…</p><p>Time flew by. They worked so hard during such a dull and repetitive period. In a flash, April 2nd arrived. Furthermore, the final round of the National University Martial Arts Competitions would be officially held on April 5th!</p><p>At the school bus station of Songcheng University, Lou Cheng pulled Yan Zheke by one hand and dragged her suitcase by the other hand while carrying his own luggage on his back. They were the first two people who stood in front of the bus that was going to be driven to the airport.</p><p>A minute later, Lin Que arrived. He wore a dark shirt and loose, dark jeans while dragging a bright yellow suitcase with his left hand.</p><p>“Oh, my God… ” Watching this scene, Lou Cheng opened his mouth for he felt very shocked, and he turned around to ask his girlfriend, “Why does your brother, your brother, have such a cute suitcase?”</p><p><em>You can’t judge a book by its cover!</em></p><p><em>Is it because my brother-in-law has the heart of a young girl?</em></p><p>Yan Zheke covered her mouth with her hand and laughed. “My brother is very casual in this aspect. He uses whatever what my aunt buys for him. He isn’t picky at all. That suitcase actually belongs to my aunt… ”</p><p>“Well, okay then.” Lou Cheng showed his remorse for the misunderstanding. He then saw Cai Zongming walking toward the bus with a handsome posture, and he found that Li Mao was behind Cai Zongming carrying a super bag that was higher than his head.</p><p>Then Sun Jian was wearing a pair of sunglasses and was holdinga couple of pieces of luggage. He showed up together with Lin Hua, who was wearing a plain, white dress.</p><p>Furthermore, He Zi took off her round glasses and her long hair had been cut. She had a short haircut like a man, which made her look cool and beautiful. Yan Xiaoling stood beside her and repeatedly reminded her,</p><p>“He Zi, I’m depending on you this time. You must be sure that you’ll send me the freshest news about the matches as soon as you can!”</p><p>The team members who would go to the capital were: the three leading players, six bench fighters, and two students who would take care of chores named Li Xiaowen and Jiang Fusheng. The other students had to stay at school, including Yan Xiaoling and Mu Jinnian.</p><p>…</p><p>At Shanbei University’s school bus station—</p><p>Xu Wanning talked about some funny things with Fang Zhirong. He found that this younger brother was easy to get along with as long as he was not angry or irritated, except that he liked to prank others.</p><p>After a long time, all the bench fighters also arrived and stood around these two people.</p><p>“Well, let’s get on the bus and go to the airport!” Xu Wannian waved his hand.</p><p>The substitute of the leading player, Mao Chengjun, was confused, so he looked around before he asked,</p><p>“Aren’t we missing one member?”</p><p><em>The most important one!</em></p><p>Xu Wannian replied with a big smile while pointing to the bus,</p><p>“Brother Peng has already arrived!”</p><p>All the people followed his finger and took a look at where he was pointing. They saw that Peng Leyun was sitting by the bus window and his back was against the seat with a lost expression in his eyes. Nobody knew what he was thinking at that moment.</p><p>“Let’s go!” Xu Wannian got on the bus first.</p><p>…</p><p>At Huahai University—</p><p>Xing Jingjing put away her luggage and got on the bus. She saw that Piao Yuan, who was bald and looked very violent and strong, was holding a cellphone to take a selfie while Zhang Dongliang, who looked like an old farmer and had a round shape, was chatting and laughing with several bench fighters.</p><p>She then turned left and saw Ann Chaoyang with half-length hair, who was wearing professional-grade headphones and listening to music quietly. He closed his eyes and sat against the seat leisurely.</p><p>Xing Jingjing walked directly to the last row and chose a seat by the window without greeting anyone else. Her seat was far away from the others.</p><p>…</p><p>In Guangnan city—</p><p>Because Li Xiaoyuan had a good figure and looked very handsome, he attracted many people’s attention by just standing there.</p><p>“That junior sister who passed by just now is very good,” he said with a smile.</p><p>“Very good?” Xi Meng, who was rather strong and had a buzz cut, looked once again with his own eyes. “Her skin is so dark. She is so thin and has no meat on her body. What’s more, she looks much older than her real age. She has no other strengths except for her tall height!”</p><p>“… Anyway, I feel that she looks pretty good,” said Li Xiaoyuan with his hands outstretched. His taste in women had been criticized again and again.</p><p>Xi Meng decided to give no more comments to Li Xiaoyuan, because he thought it would be good for others if his taste in women stayed this way. Otherwise, he would attract more beautiful girls with his handsome appearance!</p><p>“Senior Brother Zhen hasn’t arrived yet? Time is up!” Xi Meng changed the topic.</p><p>Li Xiaoyuan looked at the martial arts arena and said, “Senior Brother Zhen has worked so hard for the past half year.”</p><p>“Oh, because he is motivated. Many people said that he had a problem with attitude and used up his potential, so he had little possibility to achieve a high rank in martial arts.” Xi Meng sighed. “What’s more, Lou Cheng appeared out of nowhere and his strength grew so quickly. Senior Brother Zhen might not want to lose face even though he’s now in the fourth year.”</p><p>While they were talking, they suddenly felt that the earth was trembling slightly. They then turned around and saw Zhen Huansheng moving toward them with heavy steps while carrying his baggage.</p><p>He had bronze skin and a clear face. Even though he was not so handsome, he was still very masculine. Every step that he took was so strong that he was like a tank was treading through the street. However, the closer he got, the weaker the trembling of the earth became. This situation was just opposite of a normal one!</p><p>Zhen Huansheng said in a low voice, “Let’s go!”</p><p>…</p><p>At Hudong University—</p><p>“The walking fatty.” Yu Zhi, took a glance at Wu Yong, Han Peipei, and the other people, as he was the first one to squeeze through the bus door. He then turned around and shouted,</p><p>“This year, our goal is to advance to the final eight!”</p><p>“The final eight!” All members of his martial arts club followed him and shouted in unison.</p><p>…</p><p>At Mingdao University—</p><p>Because they lived close to the capital, the three brothers of the He family led a group of bench fighters who just regarded this match as a trip and arrived at the bullet train station.</p><p>He Yifang looked around and asked, “Do we need to say any slogans or anything else?”</p><p>While He Santai was playing the game Strike of Kings, he answered his bother without raising his head. “Do not bother me.”</p><p>…</p><p>In the Capital College Martial Arts Club—</p><p>“Kong Chan, where did our club manager go?” Shen You asked a cute girl who had a round face.</p><p>“Senior Sister said that she wanted to go to the martial arts arena to get familiar with it.” Jiang Kongchan replied to her innocently.</p><p>Shen You immediately became very nervous. “You didn’t take her there?”</p><p>“I took her to the subway station. Anyway, the last station on the fourth line is our city’s martial arts arena. No matter which exit she went out of, she wouldn’t get lost. Within such a close distance, she could just ask someone for directions… ” Jiang Kongchan explained.</p><p>“I hope so… ” Shen You still felt worried about her.</p><p>In the subway station, on the waiting platform of the fourth line, which went from Kaiyang Meng to the City Martial Arts Arena.</p><p>Ren Li, who had long and straight hair, narrowed her big eyes and looked deeply at the station nameplate:</p><p>“Kaiyang Meng!”</p><p>…</p><p>On a medium-sized passenger plane, Lou Cheng asked Yan Zheke to sit by the window, while he sat right next to her.</p><p>He held the girl’s hand and looked into her eyes. He read the same excitement and expectation in her eyes as his, Li Mao’s, and Cai Zongming’s also had.</p><p><em>Yes, I have been in the university for a year and a half and finally, I can participate in the National Competition!</em></p><p>The door of the plane closed. After the aircraft slid along the ground and accelerated, it finally soared and flew up into the sky!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
