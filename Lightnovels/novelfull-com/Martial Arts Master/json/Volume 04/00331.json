I like your sincerity!”</p><p>“Coward! Already frightened before the fight?”</p><p>“One may lose the battle but not the war! Why couldn’t you just ask him to bring it?”</p><p>“That’s called rational. Only a fool pretends to be confident in front of a losing battle! You like those braggers?”</p><p>“What coward are we talking about? I see only respect and politeness. You just can’t understand the art of words.”</p><p>“Refusing to concede defeat is longing to win. ‘I want to win. Bring it!’ Feel better now?”</p><p>“Emm… You blind supporters. Don’t you try to speak for him! He’s a coward. He has no faith in himself in front of Peng Leyun. Hmm… Actually Lin Que and him together.”</p><p>Some familiar IDs also popped up.</p><p>Wonton Seller commented, “Very well said! I don’t understand those antis. Go for it (shoulder tapping)!”</p><p>Eternal Nightfall said, “Whatever they say, I’m on fire now!”</p><p>Brahman 001 replied, “I’m always here for you no matter what you say!”</p><p>Unparalleled Dragon King laughed, “To be honest, the manner is not imposing at all but it suits you. Neither arrogant nor blowing his own horn… ”</p><p>…</p><p>While reading through those comments, Lou Cheng’s mood shifted from furious and tempted to reply to gratify for mutual understanding and eager to like their responses. Eventually, he logged out Weibo and put his phone down without doing anything.</p><p>Maturity is not defined by having no mood swings, staying unaffected in front of irritation or longing for nothing. It is more about self-control and thoughts measuring against impetuous and blind taking out.</p><p>Yan Zheke was also reading comments under this post and felt angrier than him.</p><p>“These people are terrible!</p><p>“I want to grab them and ask them to explain themselves!”</p><p>Looking at her bulging cheeks, Lou Cheng burst into a laugh and all the gloominess instantly went away. He urged,</p><p>“Go ahead. I’ve never seen Coach Yan yell at anyone.”</p><p>Yan Zheke threw a glare at Lou Cheng, brusque but amused.</p><p>“I always yell at people. You idiot!”</p><p>“That’s true… ” Lou Cheng smiled at her yell.</p><p>In the flirtatious banter, Lou Cheng completely adjusted his mood and left all the comments behind, looking forward to fight on that coming weekend.</p><p>…</p><p>20 December, Friday, 8:35 pm, those of Songcheng University Martial Arts Club arrived at the city of Pingjiang in Shanbei province.</p><p>They got here one day earlier to confront the defending champion in their best form.</p><p>The university booked the same hotel Lou Cheng and Geezer Shi had stayed last time for its great location within walking distance to Shanbei University and its decent environment and facilities. The nearby private martial arts club could be rented for a few hours for them to have a warm-up session.</p><p>However, this hotel didn’t have as many stars as Geezer Shi had bragged. He stubbornly forced the school president to book a room for each of them instead of two students sharing one as they did in the past to save some face.</p><p>Of course, he made up a very convincing reason.</p><p>“Everyone needs a good night sleep to ensure the delivery of their best performance tomorrow!”</p><p>Once the rooms were arranged to each of them in the hotel, Lou Cheng quickly put down his belongings before sneaking into Yan Zheke’s room to continue watching fight videos, taking every second to discuss the rivals.</p><p>This is to be the strongest rival in my career so far. There can never be enough preparation. Ke has fallen behind her study for this which she has to work hard to catch up.</p><p>At 10:30 pm, he left Yan Zheke’s room on his own initiative considering of her reputation.</p><p>Yan Zheke curled up her legs and half sat on the bed, hanging on his neck. She initiated a passionate French kiss and said goodnight with affection in her eyes.</p><p>“Good night.” Lou Cheng gently placed a kiss on her forehead and left the room with the corner of his mouth rising.</p><p>“Always treat me as if I’m a little kid!” Yan Zheke stroked her forehead and lay down hugging her duvet with a bright smile.</p><p>…</p><p>The next morning, Lou Cheng got up before 5:30 and changed into his martial arts suit after washing up. He opened the door of his room, about to begin his morning training somewhere.</p><p>As soon as he walked out of the room, an odd feeling hit him. He turned around and saw Shu Rui and her camera team standing not far from him.</p><p>“Morning!” Shu Rui yawned, with confusion and mist in her eyes, apparently not ready to leave her warm bed.</p><p>Lou Cheng was taken by surprise, blurting out, “Reporter Shu? You are up early.”</p><p>No one else in the martial arts club is up yet.</p><p>They are not being lazy. The special training every day is draining their physical strength. And they are used to their routine. A sudden change on the very day of the match is not a good idea.</p><p>In a fashionable light black jacket, Shu Rui smiled. “Everyone talks good things about this job but it’s not that good at all. Training from dawn to night is quite common. My skin is so bad compared to my university days. Half of my salary has to be spent on skincare products.”</p><p>After drawing herself closer to Lou Cheng with a complaint, she continued with a smile, “I’ve heard about your 5:30 morning training habit but never get a chance to film it. Finally! Don’t worry. We won’t film your moves. Just some running and looking for your exercise spot.”</p><p>“Sure.” Lou Cheng agreed.</p><p>Shu Rui looked cheerful, instructing her team to get to work. She asked, “Is Lin Que also into morning exercise?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Lou Cheng confirmed without hesitation.</p><p>I heard it from Ke!</p><p>“Emm… What time does he start?” asked Shu Rui, pleasantly surprised.</p><p>“I’m not sure. He’s a loner.” Lou Cheng outstretched his hands.</p><p>Shu Rui clapped with a sneer, “Breaking news! The two leading fighters of Songcheng University Martial Arts Club are on bad terms!”</p><p>“We are actually relatives… I never saw you talk this much in front of Lin Que.” Lou Cheng vented out some silent judgment and ended the conversation by running into the elevator.</p><p>Shu Rui waved her hand and the entire camera team followed professionally.</p><p>Outside of the hotel, Lou Cheng entered the mist of the early winter and ran to Shanbei University after gaining his direction. An old memory struck him, driving him towards the stadium.</p><p>“Now… Today… Is he training there?”</p><p>Following the strange path in his memory, Lou Cheng reached a big sports field and turned to a maidenhair tree.</p><p>Yellow leaves were drifting down from the tree in the dark mist. A young man in a white martial arts suit was there, practicing moves in an imposing manner.</p><p>“He is here! No flaccidity at all!” Lou Cheng felt touched as before.</p><p>In such a distance, he couldn’t see very clearly but he had watched too many videos of his these days that he was certain that young man in white was the lead of Shanbei University Martial Arts Club, a direct disciple of the Shangqing Sect, and the favored fighter of the age, Peng Leyun!</p><p>Lou Cheng didn’t stay and watch as it would be a taboo. Before he could turn around and look for his own spot, Peng Leyun suddenly stopped and raised his head to Lou Cheng’s direction.</p><p>In a split second, Lou Cheng felt two flashes shoot in front of him, lightening up the surroundings and driving off the mist.</p><p>That was just his illusion. There was no flash but two beams of light from Peng Leyun’s eyes.</p><p>Two beams of light from his eyes in such a distance are so overwhelming!</p><p>In a flash, Lou Cheng remembered one sign of the Taoist School Thunder Sect, Empty the Heart and Mind.</p><p>A well trained martial artist has extremely vigorous vitality in his blood and qi. His mind is overbearing as if taking on a physical form that can spin his danqi in an empty dark room and create light.</p><p>“Peng Leyun has already reached this level? Has he completed everything before the inhuman stage?” Lou Cheng’s determination had been well tempered by the “Army” Formula, allowing him to remain calm in front of the sudden Empty the Heart and Mind. He didn’t try to avoid the eyes or close his eyes subconsciously.</p><p>He gazed at Peng Leyun and nodded with a smile, leaving his burning desire for fight obviously.</p><p>The light in Peng Leyun’s eyes faded. He also nodded with a faint smile as his response.</p><p>No other communication was necessary. Peng Leyun carried on with his training and Lou Cheng ran to an isolated spot.</p><p>Last winter, I came here and got my first lesson, beginning my martial arts journey. Now I’m back as a qualified rival!</p><p>“Got it?” Shu Rui didn’t expect to see the confrontation between Lou Cheng and Peng Leyun during this routine morning exercise. Her excitement could be told by her raised tone.</p><p>What a rare material!</p><p>“I didn’t get the meeting of their eyes… We’ll have to edit it somehow,” said the cameraman with pity.</p><p>“Okay! This is some real first-hand record! It will be great on TV!” Shu Rui held her fists tight.</p><p>…</p><p>After his morning exercise, Peng Leyun took his time to enjoy his breakfast before heading to the Martial Arts Club to meet Xu Wannian and Fang Zhirong doing some warm-up training.</p><p>“Brother Peng, I heard those Songcheng University kids arrived last night, staying in Cinnamon Garden Hotel,” said Xu Wannian enthusiastically.</p><p>Peng Leyun smiled, “I saw Lou Cheng this morning.”</p><p>“You saw him? He also trained this morning? How was it? How was it like seeing him in person?” Xu Wannian shot many questions out in a row.</p><p>Peng Leyun burst into a gentle smile. “Not bad… ”</p><p>His eyes turned blank.</p><p>…</p><p>At 2 pm, Lou Cheng and his mates entered the Shanbei University martial arts arena in their casual clothes.</p><p>Built in the shape of a flying bird, this stadium was also called the Flying Bird Arena.</p><p>It was still early but the arena was pretty full already. They were not rude at all when the Songcheng University team entered. Instead, they clapped and cheered as if in a party.</p><p>This is the magnanimity of the champion! This is their absolute confidence!</p><p>“It felt like they didn’t care about us.” Cai Zongming muttered as walking into the guest team locker room.</p><p>Lou Cheng poked fun at him, “Don’t you worry! They didn’t mean it to you. They didn’t even look at you. They probably don’t know who you are.”</p><p>“Hmm… I’m the leading fighter on the bench!” Cai Zongming didn’t feel offended.</p><p>After putting their luggage away and changing into their martial arts suit in the bathroom, Geezer Shi sneered. “Let’s decide the order now so we don’t have to be bothered or distracted by it from building up energy.”</p><p>He turned to Yan Zheke, “Yan Girl, what place do you think Peng Leyun will play?”</p><p>He used to address her by different names but it had fixed as “Yan Girl” since Lou Cheng officially became his disciple.</p><p>Very used to this, she pursed her lips and answered, “I’ve checked about him. Peng Leyun is usually playing the last to give his teammates more opportunities to practice. There were a few times he played in the middle or in the beginning. The first time was two years ago during the national tournament against Huahai, Guangnan and the Capital. The second time was last year against the Capital.”</p><p>Li Mao nodded slowly.</p><p>“So he won’t show up early unless the rival is worth his attention.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
