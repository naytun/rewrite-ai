The punch left a trail of frost as if bringing early winter to the Indian summer.</p><p>Lin Que seemed as if he had stepped on a landmine. His leg was swallowed by the snow-white “blaze” rising from the ground, forming a layer of translucent ice.</p><p>He could not help shivering and slowed his move to seize Lou Cheng.</p><p>The time was now! Lou Cheng moved to his brother-in-law’s side. He concentrated his qi, blood, and force, concentrated and they rose, lifting his muscle so he seemed larger than ever.</p><p>In a sudden snap, he whipped out his metal-like right punch from below with a tremor force. It made a sharp ringing sound through the friction against the air currents.</p><p>At such a distance, he did not have to worry about Lin Que dodging him!</p><p>That scene stunned Li Mao and the rest speechless as if they were watching a fight between warriors of physical vulnerability!</p><p><em>Since when can Cheng use his Power of Frost?</em></p><p><em>In the Youth Tournament last August, he did not show this even in the final two most challenging rounds!</em></p><p><em>In just a month, he has made a breakthrough in his supernatural ability and transformed it completely?</em></p><p><em>No wonder Coach Shi tried to send Journalist Shu away. This really was a “surprise” for Shanbei!</em></p><p>On the arena, Lin Que seemed still affected by Ice Burning. He subconsciously pulled the left side of his back, trying to dodge toward the right but was hit straight in the ribs by Lou Cheng’s single whip.</p><p>With a sudden snap, his body trembled violently. His bones and muscles, skins and channels, all collapsed and contracted as his qi, blood, and force, concentrated and surged. It seemed that Lou Cheng only managed to hit the air. The shock from the burst also vanished.</p><p>He twisted his waist at a sharp turn at his waist and his Big Dan gushed. Lin Que’s muscles bulged one by one, scraping the airflow at high speed and causing a series of sounds that excited the audience.</p><p>Yin-yang Twist, Dragon Whispered!</p><p>Leveraging part of the borrowed force, Lin Que swung his arms. He threw a violent punch, attacking his opponent’s lower abdomen at close range.</p><p>When he was simulating the explosion of the Dan state, he did not use the Meteor force. Once he had completed the genuine Force Concentration, he may not be able to do it in his current state.</p><p>They were so close Lou Cheng could hear his opponent’s breathing. He knew one passive move would only force him to be more passive. An old saying went that victory would go to those who take the initiative. Thus he gritted his teeth and induced Double Explosion.</p><p>With a swing and lift of his right arm, he threw his punch.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The shock waves coming from these punches caused a strong wind in the arena. Lou Cheng swung his body and withdrew his right arm, attempting to transform the coming force into Mega Avalanche. But he found only emptiness, without any force for him to borrow.</p><p>Lin Que’s violent trembling had yet to cease as he moved like a puppet. He stood on the side, condensing the incoming force and the force from himself. Almost bursting out of his martial arts suit, he charged furiously at his opponent like a meteor storm!</p><p>This was the perfect mix of Yin-yang Twist and Force Concentration!</p><p>Double Explosion!</p><p>The wind snapping and sizzling, Lin Que turned into a mountain made of metal and was about to close in onto his opponent. Their distance was less than a step away.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s weight shifted and moved sideways. He lowered his body and dodged the attack. He kicked at his opponent’s weak point on his lower body, trying to make Lin Que lose balance and fall by himself.</p><p>Just then, Lin Que’s body became still and screeched to a stop, the same way he did at the beginning of their match.</p><p>The sound of the friction was sharp and terrifying. He restrained the accumulation of his power and stopped just before Lou Cheng’s right foot before his kick made contact.</p><p>Almost immediately, Lin Que took a step forward and skillfully avoided this attack. He threw his right arm from below with a snap, so furious that it could break even metal and stone!</p><p>Depending only on the mysteries of Yin-yang Twist and Meteor Blast, he had sustained himself this far using the Force Concentration and the borrowed force!</p><p>Under such circumstances, Lou Cheng decided to withdraw his Qi and blood and brought together in the Dantian. He reached out his hands expressionlessly, with his blue tendons, vessels, and muscles bulging.</p><p>He used one hand to grasp Lin Que’s fist and the other to pull sideways.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The attack threw his right hand backwards and his fingers kept shivering. Thanks to the pull, the false grasp of Lin Que’s fist, and the unloading of the force in his palm, he managed to avoid a fracture.</p><p>He dared not stubbornly resist and retreated two steps back along the counterforce.</p><p>With Lin Que’s successful attack, he stepped even harder and approached Lou Cheng in record time.</p><p>Lou Cheng exhaled suddenly and used his Force Concentration again, bringing the Qi and blood back in the Dantian and steadied himself.</p><p>His martial arts suit stretched tightly over his body, outlining his muscles. He moved his left shoulder and threw out the arm. His punch crackled in the air, aiming for the middle of Lin Que’s torso.</p><p>Lin Que managed to fend off this punch with his arms. He tried to visualize and adjust his posture again, borrowing and released force with his Yin-yang Twist.</p><p>However, he was fundamentally different from Lou Cheng because he had not reached the explosion of the Dan stage yet. So he could only release a little force and his head also fell back with this hit.</p><p>Lou Cheng followed him without any hesitation, delivering his Thunder Roar Zen persistently and furiously.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Lin Que shivered violently, feeling dizzy and frozen in place.</p><p>Before his master announced the outcome, Lou Cheng stopped and sighed quietly to himself.</p><p>His brother-in-law was just recently promoted and the limit of his body had yet to realize the change, thus he was still in the level of normal Eighth Pin of the Dan stage. He was not strong enough to complete the serial explosions. Otherwise, he would have put an even tougher fight.</p><p>A fighter at the normal Eighth Pin of the Dan stage could make Double Explosion at most. Even Zhou Zhengquan who was training to improve his endurance could only do the Triple Explosion. Though Lou Cheng’s previous opponents, Qiu Lin and Meng Jiefeng were Eighth Pin fighters, they were professionals and their physical bodies were closer to the Seventh Pin.</p><p>Lin Que’s consecutive moves in the beginning had impressed Lou Cheng. Lin Que had showed a completely different fight mode from before. If not the breakthrough of his Power of Frost and his preliminary understanding of Ice Burning helping him to interrupt Lin Que’s moves, he would have likely lost.</p><p>Was this the powerful and historical Dan stage?</p><p>His brother-in-law has made such amazing progress in mere three months since his breakthrough. Peng Leyun had already received the certificate of the Sixth Pin after entering the Dan stage two years ago and also had the Unique Skill of the Thunder Sect. What about himself?</p><p>One could not realize it through mere videos and could never develop a deeper understanding of it without experience.</p><p>Thinking of these, the giddy self-satisfied feeling he had since winning the Youth Tournament vanished.</p><p>He had underestimated Peng Leyun!</p><p>Breaking out of his reverie, he watched Lin Que who was standing there stupefied and panting. He said with an honest smile,</p><p>“You have to work on your physical strength.”</p><p>He knew that any other comments would have annoyed Lin Que since his brother-in-law was such a proud and aloof person. It was better to give direct suggestions.</p><p>Lin Que came round again. Without saying anything, he turned back and walked down the stone steps. Near the end of the stairs, he paused and gave a gentle nod.</p><p>Lou Cheng exhaled and turned toward Yan Zheke, who wore a complicated expression. She seemed both deeply moved and sorrowful.</p><p>Since young, Lin Que had always been her idol.</p><p>…</p><p>In the late September after the military training, Yan Xiaoling hurried to the square with He Zi and Mu Jinnian.</p><p>Today was the recruitment day for all student organizations!</p><p>They did not hesitate or allow themselves to get distracted by the cosplayers and advertisements. They headed straight for the Martial Arts Club stand. There were a large group of students there, almost forming a line.</p><p>“We came so early, but we still have to wait.” Yan Xiaoling pretended to sob.</p><p>She had become more comfortable with her roommates.</p><p>“Isn’t it because a certain someone woke up late today?” He Zi lifted her two palms helplessly. There was a change to her style today. She wore a cartoon T-shirt, shorts, a pair of sports shoes, and a backpack. Only her round-shaped glasses remained the same.</p><p>“Ah, I’m exhausted after the military training.” Having queued up, Yan Xiaoling noticed the one manning the stand was Cao Zongming.</p><p>Just as she was thinking if she should be shameless and enter through the back door, Mu Jinnian patted her on the shoulder and pointed to another direction. “Here comes your idol.”</p><p>Ah? Idol? Lou Cheng! Yan Xiaoling turned around and saw Lou Cheng who was usually separated by a screen appear by the stand.</p><p>The real person was even more charismatic!</p><p>It was him in real life! In real life! Having cheered, Yan Xiaoling stepped back and hid behind He Zi as if she had transformed into a cowardly quail.</p><p>What to do? What to do? Lou Cheng was just right there…</p><p>“Didn’t you say you’d throw yourself at Lou Cheng to get an autograph and photo once you see him?” He Zi turned back and asked indignantly.</p><p>“I-I’m nervous. I-I can’t even talk.” Yan Xiaoling hung down her head, stared at her feet, and stole glances at Lou Cheng from time to time. “He Zi, He Zi, can you ask him for me?”</p><p>He Zi glared at her. “Had you not acknowledge me as your godfather, I’ll definitely not help!”</p><p>Er, how many godfathers had she acknowledged… Yan Xiaoling suddenly thought of this issue.</p><p>He Zi took the notebook and the marker from Mu Jinnian and ran to Lou Cheng. With a smile, she said, “Nice to meet you! Can you please give me your signature?”</p><p>Lou Cheng had long noticed Yan Xiaoling but pretended not to recognize her to hide his habit of visiting his fan forum. He smiled.</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>He took the notebook and signed it.</p><p>Thinking for a moment, He Zi added, “Can you write ‘for Quail’?”</p><p>“Of course.” Lou Cheng agreed easily as a way of thanking Yan Xiaoling for her contributions to his fan forum.</p><p>He wrote a ‘for’ and then paused.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” He Zi asked in confusion.</p><p>“N-Nothing. Let me look at my phone.” Lou Cheng laughed with embarrassment.</p><p><em>Damn it. How to spell quail?</em></p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
