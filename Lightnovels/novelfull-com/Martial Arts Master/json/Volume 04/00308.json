My current QQ name is Master Hua!</p><p>At this very moment, the stunned girl had two ideas.</p><p><em>My hidden identity is revealed!</em></p><p><em>I’ll talk! I’ll tell everything!</em></p><p>Amused by Yan Xiaoling’s response, Yan Zheke tried hard to restrain her laughter. She waited for a moment to answer. “I’m a frequenter on the forum and have seen many of your posts and your photos. I always find you cute and adorable. I’ve been looking for you.”</p><p>She added silently, “Also very amusing!”</p><p>Yan Xiaoling blushed. “I’m not that good… ”</p><p>Hang on. She must know how I got an online father and a bunch of online elder relatives… She must know how I poked fun at myself… She must know my nickname Shit Eating Moderator…</p><p>Hmm… I’d rather die! I’ll hide in my room for six months without going out!</p><p>“Wait! She’s a member of the Martial Arts Club. She often visits Lou Cheng’s forum. She’s a gorgeous senior sister… ” Yan Xiaoling’s brain worked hard and finally reached some conclusion. She blurt out, “You are… ”</p><p>Her high pitch drew much attention from the crowd.</p><p>Their eyes quieted her down and her imposing manner shrank. She continued with a lowered voice, “Are you Lou Cheng’s Girlfriend?”</p><p>Otherwise, how could she have the first-hand information on his matches?</p><p>She claimed to be a student of the Songcheng University. She called herself a cute girl.</p><p>“Yes!” Yan Zheke answered with a faint smile.</p><p>To be honest, my heart had quite a journey before deciding to come over and say hi generously.</p><p>A female fan of her boyfriend… Watching in a distance online seems fine but once she physically appears in reality, I can’t help feeling complicated. I always try to act maturely and rationally but after all, I’m a young girl just under 19 years old. I do have concerns and I do lose control of my imagination. I sometimes make several plans to respectively handle each specific situation.</p><p>However, after I made all those plans, I found it rather ridiculous and I decided to be simple and bright. Maybe Little Changye in real life is just as amusing and funny as the girl online.</p><p>“Ohh!” Yan Xiaoling nodded continuously with excitement.</p><p>There is a forum member in the Martial Arts Club! And she is a cute girl!</p><p>The excited girl could no longer hold her mouth. She asked curiously, “Sister, are you really Lou Cheng’s girlfriend?”</p><p>Otherwise, why would she pick such a name?</p><p>He Zi and Mu Jinnian had totally lost in their conversation until this question popped up, their eyes locked, attention paid fully, crying out their desire for gossip.</p><p>“Yeah,” answered Yan Zheke calmly, her lips curved.</p><p>Considering how shameless Cheng and I can get showing off our love, Little Changye will figure it out herself in no time once she joins in the Martial Arts Club and comes to classes for a week.</p><p>“I knew it!” Shouted Yan Xiaoling in great delight with her right hand waving in the air.</p><p><em>How exciting it is! I’m chatting with Lou Cheng’s girlfriend now!</em></p><p><em>Hmm! They doubted my intuition!</em></p><p>“I saw you guessed so.” Yan Zheke’s dimples appeared along with a sweet smile. She then naturally changed the topic to interesting stuff on the forum.</p><p>She was a girl of details, very good at socializing. She didn’t mention any of Eternal Nightfall’s dark history, so she wouldn’t feel embarrassed in front of her roommates. However, she underestimated Yan Xiaoling. How could a girl so used to self-deprecation control her mouth when it came to a familiar topic? She immediately revealed her true form and exposed many of her embarrassing moments.</p><p>He Zi and Mu Jinnian didn’t know much about Yan Zheke or Lou Cheng’s fans club. It would have been hard for them to get involved in this conversation but Yan Xiaoling’s self-deprecation made it a lot easier. They couldn’t help asking for details and the conversation went on merrily.</p><p>Once Yan Xiaoling calmed down, she at once realized how wrong it had been and noticed her roommates’ strange eyes on her as if saying,</p><p>Yan Xiaoling, we didn’t expect this from you!</p><p>“Boo… I want to die!” Yan Xiaoling covered her face with her hands.</p><p>Yan Zheke covered her mouth and chuckled, her body rocking back and forth slightly. She took a glance at her watch and asked, “Little Changye, will you participate in the special training?”</p><p>“Special training?” Details about the special training flashed in Yan Xiaoling’s head and her face turned paler.</p><p>“I… I don’t think I will… Look at my skinny arms and legs… ”</p><p><em>Four hours training every day… I’d rather die!</em></p><p><em>Lazy as me, I only eat one meal a day so I don’t have to get up early… No way I’m joining in the special training!</em></p><p>However, a sudden disappointment and pity hit her. <em>“Not in the special training, I can’t watch Lou Cheng exercise or get first-hand information… “</em></p><p>“I… Knew… It…” Yan Zheke said word by word silently before putting on a gentle smile. “What about some office work for the club? Do you want to help Sister Xiaowen organize on-site cheering?”</p><p>Yan Xiaoling was pleasantly surprised! “No special training but I can hang out in the Martial Arts Club all the time! This is amazing!”</p><p>“Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!” She happily agreed.</p><p>“Go and find Sister Xiaowen later. That one.” Yan Zheke pointed at Li Xiaowen before giving her QQ number to Yan Xiaoling. “I have to go back now.”</p><p>“Bye, sister. You are so nice!” Yan Xiaoling waved excitedly.</p><p><em>She’s a perfect match for Lou Cheng!</em></p><p>Yan Xiaoling took out her mobile and published a new post on the forum, beginning with an arrogant and complacent emoji.</p><p>“Ha-hah… Breaking news! But I’m not telling anyone!”</p><p>“Not interested! Get lost!” Brahman, waiting for her live broadcast, replied at once.</p><p>Yan Xiaoling didn’t feel scolded at all. She sent a waggling emoji and replied, “Brahman, I really want to share with you but the senior sister is so sweet. I must keep the secret for her.”</p><p><em>Ask me. Ask me!</em></p><p><em>How soft-hearted I am!</em></p><p>“Senior sister… Lou Cheng’s girlfriend?” Okamoto’s Fan hit right at the point.</p><p>“I… I didn’t say anything!” Yan Xiaoling pouted innocently as she typed.</p><p>“Really? Is it the beautiful member of the Martial Arts Club?” There were not many possibilities. Brahman began with the most likely one.</p><p>“How did you get it so easily? That makes me feel less good about it!” Yan Xiaoling added the “face full of tears” emoji.</p><p>Mu Jinnian asked out of confusion, “Ling, do you know how to organize on-site cheering?</p><p>“You agreed to it so fast with zero hesitation.”</p><p>“Of course!” Yan Xiaoling straightened her chest. “I’m a pro… ”</p><p>She felt disbelief in He Zi and Mu Jinnian’s eyes and quickly added,</p><p>“Fan.”</p><p>Hah… A professional fan.</p><p>…</p><p>Yan Zheke stepped back to Lou Cheng quickly and lightly, carrying a smile while recalling Little Changye’s amusing responses.</p><p>“You… You went to meet Eternal Nightfall?” Asked Lou Cheng nervously. He didn’t quite understand why he felt so nervous.</p><p>“Can’t I?” Yan Zheke tilted her head with a faint smile.</p><p>“Sure. No problem!” Lou Cheng made his attitude clear before continuing with his questions, “I’m just curious… I thought you would stay away from her just like me.”</p><p>He didn’t forget to give himself some credit.</p><p>Yan Zheke chuckled, her eyes glancing across Lou Cheng’s face. “I had a very complicated feeling at the beginning. Then I thought it through and decided to be more open-minded about it. Hmm… Little Changye didn’t let me down. She is a very interesting and honest kid.”</p><p>“Don’t try to sound old. Ke, you are only 18 years and 10 months old.” Lou Cheng felt relieved and poked fun at his girlfriend.</p><p>Yan Zheke bit her lower lip and said with some emotion,</p><p>“Cheng, sometimes I feel confused. Am I too rational, too polite or too concerned about interpersonal relationships? I want to do my best at everything. This time when I went back for my grandpa’s birthday, some relatives made improper jokes at me and introduced me to some youths promising and talented to their standard. They said I should keep these options open for after my graduation but I just wanted to walk away and yell at them that I have a boyfriend already. Then I thought that would be silly and rude. So I smiled hypocritically instead of saying anything.</p><p>“Sigh… Sometimes I just want to be capricious and be myself.”</p><p>At the beginning of the special training, the Martial Arts Club only gave three days off during the long holiday. Yan Zheke went back to attend her grandpa’s 70s birthday celebration and Lou Cheng’s short trip plan failed before made.</p><p>Listening to his girlfriend’s rare complain, Lou Cheng tried to comfort her humorously. “Aren’t you already capricious? Your family doesn’t want you to have a relationship during your university years but you are dating me. How does it feel to free yourself?”</p><p>Yan Zheke glared at him with affection, her lips pursed and her head turned away. She lowered her voice so no one could hear her,</p><p>“Not bad!”</p><p>Cai Zongming walked into the ring to host the orientation as the club manager.</p><p>Lou Cheng burst into a laugh as soon as he saw him.</p><p>“Ha-hah… Is it really Talker?</p><p>“He used to describe Manager Chen’s brows as flying bugs… Now his hair is so sleek that no bug can land! Any bug would slip on his hair!”</p><p>Yan Zheke was also amused by Little Ming but her comment was interrupted by the vibration in her pocket.</p><p>She took her phone out, confused, and saw a message from Yan Xiaoling with an emoji brimming with expectations.</p><p>“Sister, may I ask you a question? What kind of person is Lou Cheng? We are all very curious.”</p><p>Yan Zheke pursed her lips and smiled, recalling the past and praising her thought into words, her eyes softening gradually.</p><p>She lowered her head and began to type, the corners of her mouth turning upward subconsciously.</p><p>“Just like what you felt before.”</p><p><em>A boy very warm, very thoughtful and very caring.</em></p><p><em>About how funny he is… I’ll keep it to myself.</em></p><p>…</p><p>Time went by quickly in their hard training. One week before the Professional Ranking Event, the sortition ceremony for the regional stage of the national university martial arts competition took place, two weeks earlier than that of last year.</p><p>Every member of the martial arts club gathered in the office, waiting for the live broadcast.</p><p>Their performance last year was awful. Lou Cheng and Lin Que were not invited to the scene of the event. A teacher of the university was assigned as the representative.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
