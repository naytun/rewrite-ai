The atmosphere here was also very lively, which made everyone in the arena feel excited. Cheng experienced such huge excitement that he could not help but tremble.</p><p>Lou Cheng saw the referee waving his hands to both sides to gather players and that the hand on the clock had turned to 43. He slowly stood up and took off his thin coat. He then looked at his girlfriend and wondered how she would cheer for him this time.</p><p>Yan Zheke also stood and clenched her fists. She shook her fists slightly and shouted in a tender but firm voice,</p><p>“Lou Cheng! Lou Cheng! Lou Cheng, come on!”</p><p>Hearing the familiar voice, tone, and words, Lou Cheng suddenly felt like he was living in a dream. It was as if he was going back to the past. He was so touched and excited. He cherished all the happy and sad moments they had experienced together this year.</p><p><em>This is the first cheer I’ve received, in my very first Challenge Tournament!</em></p><p>He had not expected that he would be able to participate in the semi-finals of the National University Martial Arts Games. He hadn’t expected to fight with Ren Li, a favored fighter, on such a great stage in the second semester of his sophomore year either.</p><p>It had taken him a year and seven months to get here. Whether he could advance to the finals or not depended on this match!</p><p>“I will try my best!” Lou Cheng replied to her with the same words that he had said back then, but he added an action, stretching his fist and bumping it with hers.</p><p>During his free time, he sometimes read through old chats with Yan Zheke. Sometimes he even exported them and saved backups.</p><p>Yan Zheke seemed to recall the scene and the dialogue. She smiled at him.</p><p>Other members who stood next to them, like Li Mao, Sun Jian, and Cai Zongming, were confused by their cheering style. They thought it did not fit into their dating style. Usually, the couple showed off their romantic relationship in public. Shouldn’t they be more and more intimate as time went on?</p><p><em>“When we were fighting with Huahai, although we did not look back at you, we still clearly knew that you guys had done something intimate behind us!”</em> they thought.</p><p>Why was this couple behaving so innocently and normal now?</p><p>Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke were aware of their confusion. They once again looked at each other and gave a shared smile. They had a secret that belonged only to them.</p><p>Lou Cheng said nothing and bumped his fist with Lin Que, Cai Zongming, and the other members one by one. Hearing the cheering of his club members, he turned around and walked toward the stone stairs of the arena. A large screen could be seen above.</p><p>He became more and more confident with every step he took forward, because of his past memories. The faster and firmer he walked, the more buoyant his momentum was.</p><p>Lou Cheng entered the ring and saw Ren Li. She was wearing an elegant haircut. His momentum was like a snow peak piercing into the clouds and standing in the chilly north wind, steady and cool, steep and holy. The audience kowtowed him in worship.</p><p>Ren Li stood rootless and invisible, like the wind which sometimes snuck into the night, silently hidden; sometimes vigorous and sharp, blowing people’s faces like a knife; and other times swept through everywhere as if doomsday was coming!</p><p>The most magnificent part of her momentum was that her will hid in the wind. It was so erratic and ethereal that Lou Cheng was unable to target it. When confronting her, he could only perform passive defense. However, of course, it was hard for a hurricane to shake the snow peak.</p><p><em>“The Wind Sect really is a little bit mysterious…”</em> Lou Cheng praised her martial arts in his heart and stood in a position which was on the side of the referee but kept a distance of eight to ten meters from Ren Li.</p><p>In the broadcast studio, Chen Sansheng could not help but clear his throat as he said to the audience who was watching the show,</p><p>“The match between the two favored fighters is about to start!”</p><p>No matter whether they were in Lou Cheng’s fan forum or in Ren Li’s, the IDs that had been having an animated debate stopped posting new messages and began to focus on their screens. The audience in the arena also held their breaths and watched the clock move to 45 with full attention. The referee raised his right hand.</p><p>“The talk time starts!” Because the referee was a fighter of high-ranking Dan Stage, his voice easily covered the whole arena.</p><p>As an expert who was about to become a senior staff in the martial arts circle, he clearly knew how much attention this match had received. Not only would there be martial arts fans, elders, and disciples of the Ice God Sect and Kongtong School watching this match, but also Dragon King and Dong Baxian were said to have devoted time to watch this match in particular.</p><p>TICK! TOCK! As the time on the clock went, Ren Li opened her big eyes suddenly and asked Lou Cheng with slight confusion and curiosity,</p><p>“The simplified physical invulnerability that you just mastered, is it the Internal Explosion of the Fire Sect?”</p><p>As a direct descendant of a famous martial arts school and as the last disciple of the elite master, Qi Ling, Blazing Sword, she knew that Geezer Shi had a close relationship with the military. And every fighter of physical invulnerability knew that the military also had some connections with the Longhu Club!</p><p>This had been exposed to the public before, so Lou Cheng did not intend to hide anything. He replied frankly,</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p><em>Why is she asking me this question? Is she trying to target my mentality? But she is said to be bad at this. It would be more likely for Chen Diguo to perform like this.</em></p><p><em>Not everyone can be regarded as a Talker!</em></p><p>Ren Li sighed with satisfaction and once again asked him,</p><p>“Then the movements that you are practicing, are they Emperor Yan Force or Fire Force?”</p><p>These two movements were the core of the Fire Sect, known as two of the most ferocious Kung Fu moves of physical invulnerability.</p><p>Lou Cheng blushed slightly. He thought for a while but still chose not to lie or boast. He answered her honestly,</p><p>“Zhu Rong Force…”</p><p>If Ren Li did not believe him and began to think other things, that would be her own problem.</p><p><em>What exactly is she trying to do?</em></p><p>Lou Cheng wondered to himself, <em>“Should I take this opportunity to perform like a Talker so that it will affect my opponent’s mood?”</em></p><p>“Oh, I see …” Ren Li let out a smile as if she had solved a problem which had confused her for a long time. She pondered for a while and then said, “You answered two of my questions. Well, I will tell you two secrets. As a matter of fact, I have not only mastered the simplified version of the Wind Sect’s physical invulnerability, but also the simplified version of the Plague Sect’s physical invulnerability. What’s more, the force I have mastered is Postwind Force.”</p><p><em>Eh…</em> After hearing her secrets, Lou Cheng was a little dumbfounded.</p><p><em>My dear student, we are in an arena competition, not playing truth or dare!</em></p><p><em>What exactly do you think this holy stage, this talk time, is? (Quoted from Talker).</em></p><p>After Ren Li finished speaking, she closed her mouth tightly. Her eyes gradually became bright and seemed to emit a spark which brought out the best of her beautiful martial arts suit, in light green and white color.</p><p>At this moment, Lou Cheng recovered from his confusion. He was not sure whether she was telling the truth or not. He also did not know what her real intentions were.</p><p><em>Is she really telling me the truth to reciprocate or is she taking the chance to mislead me so that I will separate more spirit to defend against the invisible simplified version of physical invulnerability of the Plague Sect?</em></p><p><em>Forget it, I shouldn’t think about it anymore. Anyway, even if Ren Li hadn’t told me this, I would still defend against her so as not to be attacked by the powerful movements of the Plague Sect.</em></p><p>He thought for a while and gradually calmed down. He focused more on the match and once again his physical state became more concentrated.</p><p>The two fighters stood there in silence. The referee glanced at the clock and raised his right hand suddenly. He then announced loudly,</p><p>“Start! ”</p><p>WOOSH!</p><p>Ren Li took the initiative to move her feet to the left and then to the right. With the combination of her footwork, fascia, muscle, and force, she made a small rolling and howling whirlwind in the position she stood.</p><p>People could see the whirlwind clearly. With a howling sound, the whirlwind, which shook people’s hearts, rushed straight toward Lou Cheng, rolling up dust from the ground.</p><p>Ren Li walked in the whirlwind. It seemed that she was going to vanish.</p><p>“Buddha Voice!” “Cloth invulnerability!” These two terms suddenly flashed across Lou Cheng’s mind. He intended to perform Bing Formula. He understood that Ren Li had made a great and incredible achievement in Wind Step, which meant that she was at the inhuman level.</p><p>This was similar to Buddha Voice and Cloth Invulnerability. However, Qiu Lin, who Lou Cheng had confronted before, was only qualified to learn Great Thunder Cloud Voice, Great Roaring Lion Voice, and Great Wisdom Voice because he had not achieved physical invulnerability. He had only mastered Lotus Step and Thundercloud Movement. In addition, he had only learned a little of Sound of Thundercloud and never achieved the inspiring and striking effect.</p><p>However, Ren Li had obviously reached the threshold of this movement instead of only knowing it on the surface level. If comparing her to Qiu Lin, her level was close to the top of Lotus Step and Thundercloud Movement because she was able to make the strong wind swirl to protect her and howl to deafen her opponent!</p><p>This was not only about footwork but also a sound attack!</p><p>The sound kept humming in Lou Cheng’s ears. It made people’s scalps tingle as if demons were coming soon. Lou Cheng also saw Long Juan Zhi Feng (Whirlwind) come toward his face, so he changed his moves quickly. He began to outline a new ancient formula in his mind and said with a deep voice,</p><p>“Forwarding!”</p><p>The Forwarding Formula could suppress any evil thing!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
