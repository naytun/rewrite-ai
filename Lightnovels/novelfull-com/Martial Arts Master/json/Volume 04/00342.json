While his spine was bouncing like a bow, he forced his left leg, which had just lost its target, to move again and launch a backward Front Sweep. Thanks to this move, he managed to turn his body to the side and successfully evaded Yan Zheke’s killing strike.</p><p>No ducking about and no blocking, he bet everything on this one charge!</p><p>This time, however, Yan Zheke chose not to retreat and circle around. She decided to borrow the force in her right arm, which had been dodged, to help her jump forward. After the jump, she again came to the back of her opponent and took advantage of her body’s rotation to ward off the whip kick which had swept towards her.</p><p>Noticing her opponent’s irritation, she took advantage of the opportunity and did not hesitate to perform a counterattack. She struck out with a killing move, Clearance!</p><p>Pop! Her leg kicked out like a whip toward Yin Xiangxi’s standing leg.</p><p>At this moment, Yin Xiangxi lost all of his momentum and was unable to maintain his posture. He had no choice but to give up his stance and rolled forward like a lazy donkey, narrowly avoiding the swift leg!</p><p>Yan Zheke stepped on the ground with her right foot and then approached him with sliding steps. She moved her left leg down again to launch an explosive kick to his chest.</p><p>Boom! Yin Xiangxi barely managed to cross his arms and endure this kick.</p><p>Pop! Pop! Pop! Yan Zheke visualized the scene of Brutal Blizzard and kicked out with her legs one after the other. Her kicks becoming faster and heavier as they repeated!</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Because Yin Xiangxi was lying on the ground it was difficult for him to exert any force. After he set his arms and managed to ward off Yan Zheke’s three kicks, his defensive posture finally collapsed. Yan Zheke followed up with a quick bouncing kick which stopped just above his exposed throat.</p><p>“Round one, Yan Zheke wins!” The referee announced after glancing at them.</p><p>“Yes!” Yan Zheke showed her overwhelming excitement and turned around to wave toward the visiting team area. She just saw that Lou Cheng had jumped up and was letting out celebratory punches continuously. <em>“He looks even more excited than me,”</em> thought Yan Zheke.</p><p><em>Before the match, who could imagine that I could defeat Yin Xiangxi in this way?</em></p><p><em>Things will become much easier for us as long as we can find a play style that can restrain our opponent and then strictly carry out this style!</em></p><p><em>“Crap!”</em> Qu Hui hid his anger and depression in his heart and did not scold Yin Xiangxi verbally!</p><p>Qu Hui thought to himself, <em>“I expected so much from Yin Xiangxi. I always thought that he would be able to quickly defeat the bench fighters of Songcheng University, but in the end not to mention failing to get a fast win, he didn’t even manage to win the match at all!”</em></p><p>How can we fight this battle?</p><p>My expected plan went wrong from the very beginning…</p><p>For now, I can only pray that both Lou Cheng’s and Lin Que’s injuries are more severe than I expected.</p><p>“Go on. Try your best.” Qu Hui patted Luo Haize’s shoulder powerlessly.</p><p>I hope he can at least consume some of Lin Que’s stamina…</p><p>“Yes, Sir!” Luo Haize stood up. He was tall and strong, a physique which meant he was naturally talented for martial arts.</p><p>After Yan Zheke calmed down she found that the muscles in her legs had become sore and tight, while her stamina was almost exhausted to the limit.</p><p>A skirmish fight needs fast movements, accurate coordination, and agile footwork, which means it consumes much more stamina than most other fighting styles. Yan Zheke had fought with Yin Xiangxi in this way for several minutes and even performed 24 Blizzard Strikes mixed with a Yin-yang Twist at the end of the match. It was only natural for her to feel so exhausted by the end of the match.</p><p>She put her hands on her knees and gasped while watching Luo Haize stride up and pass by Yin Xiangxi.</p><p>Maybe I’ll still able to trade a few blows with him…</p><p>After I’m defeated, my cousin and Luo Cheng are up next. Both of them seem eager to fight…</p><p>It seems like there is no need for me to struggle to my limits…</p><p>She thought for a while and then held herself upright. She turned around and walked out of the ring along the flight of stairs.</p><p>The referee glanced at Luo Haize who was already standing there, stunned, and announced loudly,</p><p>“Round two, Luo Haize wins!”</p><p>“I won? Just like that?” Luo Haize stared at Yan Zheke’s retreating figure, wearing a confused face and felt like he was not in an important competition at that moment.</p><p>Lin Que unzipped his coat and took it off. After he was wished luck by Lou Cheng, he walked toward his cousin calmly.</p><p>“I won’t say ‘go for it’.” Yan Zheke pursed her lips and let out a chuckle while holding her hand up to give her cousin a fist bump.</p><p>What she meant was that to fight with an opponent of this class, he did not even need any support.</p><p>“This opponent is suited to my recovery.” Lin Que answered precisely and approached the stone steps to waves of catcalls.</p><p>Behind him, Lou Cheng walked toward Yan Zheke and held her steadily. He laughed and said,</p><p>“Good job!”</p><p>This was a joke they always made after they lost a match to Peng Leyun, about the difference between “You’ve tried your best” and “Good job”.</p><p>“Then I’ll accept your praise immodestly,” Yan Zheke replied in a cute tone and laughed.</p><p>While Lin Que was coming up to the ring, the bones in his body made a crack sound, just like a rusty machine which had begun to rotate. His momentum increased in an awe-inspiring manner.</p><p>When he reached the position opposite to Luo Haize, his momentum had become as deep as the sea and seemed to have turned tangible.</p><p>Suddenly, Luo Haize became very nervous and scared, like a rabbit who had run into a tiger. He could not help but think of the scene when Lin Que was fighting with Shannan. In that match, Lin Que performed a Dan stage explosion at the very beginning.</p><p>Am I seriously getting scared before the match is even started?</p><p>Just as this thought flashed across his mind, he finally heard the referee’s announcement;</p><p>“Begin now!”</p><p>Luo Haize moved without thinking, not daring to spend one more second in the same spot. He moved quickly and steadily.</p><p>Lin Que straightened his knees and threw himself straight at his opponent. Even though he did not perform Force Concentration, his speed was still as fast as lightning.</p><p>With only a few steps, he shortened the distance between the two in a moment.</p><p>Luo Haize immediately exerted force into his legs and tried to evade Lin Que’s charge. Lin Que, however, swayed his center of gravity and launched his attacks simultaneously.</p><p>After a few seconds, Lin Que closed in on his opponent with his faster and agiler movements. He then continued to attack Luo Haize and force him to dodge in a hurry. Luo Haize had to avoid facing Lin Que face to face, otherwise, he would hit by Meteor Force.</p><p>In a split second, Luo Haize was forced to dodge several attacks in a row, while Lin Que remained calm and condensed his qi, blood, spirit, and force.</p><p>Boom! Lin Que broke out his Dan qi and expanded his right leg before he stamped and pounded on the ground strongly.</p><p>Bang! With a muffled sound, the ground under Luo Haize’s feet split open as if a volcano was erupting, causing him to lose his balance and start wobbling</p><p>Lin Que took the opportunity to move a step forward. He then swelled his muscles and swung his right arm quickly.</p><p>He threw a fist toward his opponent, a fist which was like a meteor, flying across the sky.</p><p>Luo Haize did not have the time to duck, so he barely kept his balance and crossed his arms to ward off this violent attack.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The “Meteor” fell to the ground and exploded as if it were a bomb. The shock wave swept out, engulfing Luo Haize’s whole body, causing his blood and muscles to tremble as if in fear.</p><p>Pop! Pop! Pop! Lin Que swung his arms swiftly as he continually attacked his opponent, giving Luo Haize no chance for respite.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Luo Haize was hit by several of Lin Que’s punches, causing him to fall to the ground and begin retching.</p><p>The referee raised his right hand and announced,</p><p>“Round Three, Lin Que wins!”</p><p>“Round three, Lin Que wins…” In the home team’s seating area, Qu Hui felt desperate. He covered his face with one hand and thought that he did not have any hope to win this match anymore.</p><p>How could Luo Haize be defeated so fast, before he even consumed some of his opponent’s stamina!?</p><p>As a result, I’ll have to try my best while fighting with Lin Que, and I can’t even think of saving energy for Lou Cheng later!</p><p>They are just rubbish!</p><p>He scolded his team-mates in his heart while gnashing teeth before walking out of the seating area and toward the ring in a hesitant manner.</p><p>No matter what will happen, I still need to fight!</p><p>While he was walking forward, he suddenly stared at Lin Que and was stunned.</p><p>Lin Que, who stood by the edge of the ring, changed his attacking stance and turned around to walk down the flight of stairs.</p><p>Walking down the flight of stairs?</p><p>Walking down the flight of stairs!?</p><p>“Ehh? What happened to brother-in-law?” Lou Cheng asked, confused at what he was seeing.</p><p>Yan Zheke who sat next to him also looked dumb. After a moment, she murmured, “My brother may want to leave you an opponent who is still fresh.”</p><p>What did she mean by “fresh”? Lou Cheng’s mouth twitched and he almost laughed out. He stood up and walked forward by instinct.</p><p>He only held hands with Yan Zheke and totally forgot to give a high five or a fist bump with the other members.</p><p>While Lou Cheng met Lin Que halfway, he smiled and said,</p><p>“Your behavior is really putting a lot of pressure on me.”</p><p>If I lose, our team will have to bid farewell to the national finals!</p><p>Lin Que gave Lou Cheng an emotionless glance and said,</p><p>“I need to stop where I should stop.”</p><p>“You stopped too early… ” Lou Cheng thought to himself, but he also understood the other meaning hiding behind this sentence from the eyes of his brother-in-law, that was:</p><p>If you can’t beat Qu Hui on your own, then how can we even hope to advance to the national finals?</p><p>“Uh… Is he trying to goad me? Is he worrying that the match with Shanbei will cast a shadow on me?” Lou Cheng suddenly woke up and smiled.</p><p>“Then I’ll have to try my best.”</p><p>My Brother-in-law is really a Hinekuremono! [1]</p><p>After bumping fists with Lin Que, Lou Cheng stared at the ring and moved forward.</p><p>Fight with Qu Hui by myself?</p><p>No one is a coward here!</p><p>While Qu Hui, who now had already stepped in the center of the ring, stood still; as if he was experiencing an amazing dream, and was afraid that moving would mean he had to wake up from it.</p><p>I tried so hard to arrange for this match. I kept praying and hoping to have a chance to fight against Lou Cheng by myself only to have my hopes dashed… and now, my dream has somehow come true again?!</p><p>After both Xiangxi and Haize lost the match, I almost gave up on this round. Luckily Lin Que got off the ring by himself!</p><p>It’s like pennies are dropping from heaven!</p><p>The corners of his mouth even lifted into a smile as he found himself unable to conceal the ecstasy in his heart.</p><p>There is only yourself to blame if you refuse an offer from the Heavens!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
