How lucky I am!</p><p>Deducing what might happen in his mind regardless of other factors, Qu Hui found it quite logical and smiled unconsciously.</p><p>I hope Lou Cheng’s internal injuries are more severe than I predicted!</p><p>No, even if his injuries are only as bad as I predicted, I’ll still be the winner today!</p><p>Focusing on Lou Cheng, who looked a little pale, he watched the young man climb up to the stage step by step, finally stopping in front of him.</p><p>Qu Hui greeted Lou Cheng with a smile, and then took off his top hat, putting it to his chest while bowing to Lou Cheng.</p><p>Lou Cheng responded by cupping his hands in recognition.</p><p>The referee did not give them much time to chat. He raised his right hand and said loudly,</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>This is the last round of the match!</p><p>Upon hearing the referee’s words, Yan Zheke clenched her fists tightly and opened her eyes widely, even though she was confident in Lou Cheng. She saw Qu Hui jump up immediately to levitate in the air, several meters above the ground, and then he threw his hat out in a casual manner.</p><p>The hat flew over and landed in the home team’s area.</p><p>As soon as it touched the ground, Qu Hui turned upside down while making a fist with his right hand. In the audience’s eyes, he was like a meteor descending on Lou Cheng!</p><p>The sound of his fluttering clothes made everyone’s heart beat faster.</p><p>Though it was not the first time the audience had witnessed such a blockbuster movie scene, they still felt their adrenalin pumping.</p><p>Facing the attack from above, Lou Cheng kept a stable stance while visualizing a beast-head statue stepping on a red dragon. The statue immediately suppressed the raging hot wave within his body and paved the way for him to gather strength in his fist as he punched upward.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>As if hitting something invisible, his punch caused a flaming explosion that pierced the audience’s eyes.</p><p>Zhu Rong Force, the supernatural ability of blaze!</p><p>As the flame flooded out towards him, Qu Hui suddenly stopped descending and turned to fly upward, dodging just in time to avoid the disaster of having his hair and clothes lit on fire.</p><p>Squinting at Lou Cheng without any surprise showing on his face, he took a quick breath to withdraw his qi, blood, force, and spirit before suddenly releasing them.</p><p>Hum! Qu Hui again descended headfirst with his seemingly inflated body. But this time he began rotating like a drill, diving straight towards his opponent on the ground. The surroundings and even the air were affected by his movement and began shaking oddly!</p><p>It was a mixture of the burst of Dan stage, gravitational acceleration, and terrifying rotation, “The Flesh Whirlwind”!</p><p>If Qu Hui had reached a higher rank, with access to a weapon, his attack would have been even more shocking!</p><p>Remaining in his original stance, Lou Cheng took a step back abruptly when Qu Hui’s rotating fist was about to touch his head. It seemed that Lou Cheng intended to swipe at his opponent’s waist and abdomen instead of directly facing his attack.</p><p>At this moment, Qu Hui’s falling figure changed direction, suddenly flying sideways, by using the gravitational acceleration to rebound his fist toward Lou Cheng.</p><p>He must land a blow on Lou Cheng with his fist by any means!</p><p>He not only devoted all his strength to this punch, also taking advantage of the external conditions to make the rotational force increase in strength and impetus!</p><p>“It’s the most powerful punch I’ve thrown in all my years of martial arts…” this thought flashed through Qu Hui’s mind, giving him the confidence to destroy everything that tried to block his path.</p><p>Lou Cheng lowered his waist while gathering Force Concentration. Then he raised his right arm up to block Qu Hui’s “drill” with the palm of his half-clenched fist.</p><p>Bang bang bang! A series of collisions sounded as the fascia stood out on Lou Cheng’s palm, blocking Qu Hui’s fist. The fingers, which were impacting violently with the spinning fist, gradually radiated a metallic luster.</p><p>On the other side, Qu Hui felt as if his most powerful blow had landed on a steel plate that he was unable to break or pierce no matter how hard he tried.</p><p>No, even a steel plate would be destroyed by my punch!</p><p>Crack! Lou Cheng, in his black martial arts suit with white trim, turned his toes inward while stepping heavily enough to cause a spiderweb of cracks to spread around him. While his whole body stood still, his right arm slightly swung forward like a wave, easily canceling out Qu Hui’s Flesh Whirlwind.</p><p>“He blocked my most powerful punch so easily? Is the gap between us really this wide?” Is the strength of an initial Sixth-Pin fighter this terrifying? A sudden flash of desperation seized Qu Hui for an instant.</p><p>Seeing the Flesh Whirlwind slow down, Lou Cheng tightened his half-clenched fist in an attempt to grab Qu Hui’s hand.</p><p>At this moment, Qu Hui bounced upward with the help of his back and waist as if being pulled by an invisible hand, allowing him to narrowly escape from Lou Cheng’s grasp.</p><p>He would definitely lose if he was caught by Lou Cheng and filled with his wave of icy cold energy!</p><p>Once again floating in the air several meters above the ground, Qu Hui reigned in the desperate and pessimistic thoughts running through his mind while deciding to change his strategy. Instead of dashing and attacking directly, this time he used the advantage of his flying supernatural ability at changing directions quickly and oddly, with a different kind of rotational force, to disrupt Lou Cheng’s rhythm. He was sure Lou Cheng would soon expose some flaws because of his internal injuries.</p><p>Qu Hui dived toward Lou Cheng like a fighter jet and then leveled out when they were about to collide. Qu Hui’s trajectory formed a beautiful arc in the air as he flashed to Lou Cheng’s side and released a kick toward his temple.</p><p>Bang! Lou Cheng raised his left arm and blocked the kick in time.</p><p>Pam! Qu Hui immediately turned his kick into step, borrowing strength from it to kick at Lou Cheng with the other leg, which seemed too quick for Lou Cheng to react.</p><p>However, Lou Cheng again raised his arm in advance and blocked the attack in time.</p><p>Bang bang bang! Qu Hui made a series of kicks with both feet, which fell on Lou Cheng like a storm, giving him no chance to take a breath.</p><p>Bang bang bang! Though seeming to be in a panic while blocking the kicks, Lou Cheng would always escape from Qui Hui’s attack in time and keep his defense stable.</p><p>All of a sudden, Qu Hui changed his direction and appeared behind Lou Cheng, where he sent a kick toward the acupoint at the back of Lou Cheng’s head with the instep of his foot.</p><p>The series of kicks he made previously was to attract Lou Cheng’s attention, leaving him open to this attack.</p><p>Bang! Lou Cheng turned sideways and threw out his arm, which barely managed to land on the instep of Qu Hui’s foot.</p><p>Bang bang bang! Qu Hui continued creating chances to attack time after time by stopping and changing directions abruptly in the air with his flying supernatural ability. However, each time Lou Cheng would predict his attack and barely block it in time, regardless of his minor errors.</p><p>After a while, Qu Hui started becoming depressed and desperate again, feeling like he was not facing Lou Cheng but a lofty mountain while being a fool who tried in vain to move it. No matter what he did, Lou Cheng remained steady as a rock!</p><p>He had every reason to be desperate.</p><p>How did he survive that round of attacks just now? Thinking about it, Qu Hui began visualization in his mind to control his negative emotions and then gathered and condensed all his qi, blood, spirit, force and feelings while floating in the air.</p><p>Now that the normal attacks failed, he could only use Force Concentration to strengthen his supernatural ability!</p><p>Poom!</p><p>As his Danqi spewed out like a volcanic eruption, Qu Hui cut the airflow and created a fierce wind. He did all this within seconds as if his butt was on fire.</p><p>He turned to draw half a circle in the wind and again appeared at Lou Cheng’s back.</p><p>As he stopped abruptly, most of the remaining kinetic energy was transferred to his tightened legs, kicking at Lou Cheng’s neck fiercely like a whip.</p><p>Will you still manage to escape this time?</p><p>Lou Cheng felt his neck arching as the fierce wind approached, but he didn’t dodge this time. Instead, along with gathering and condensing his danqi, Lou Cheng threw his right hand at Qu Hui like a whip.</p><p>Bang! The whip-like hand met Qu Hui’s whip kick with a dull thud.</p><p>Feeling his shin arching and body shaking wildly, Qu Hui dared not stay where he was and began flying upward to hide in midair.</p><p>He desperately fought the urge to rub his legs in consideration of his public image.</p><p>Still failed? Qu Hui again launched an attack since he couldn’t believe in his eyes. However, after Double Explosions with the help of his flying supernatural ability, Lou Cheng’s defense was still stable and Qu Hui still couldn’t find a path to victory.</p><p>Flying upward while suspended in the air, Qu Hui gasped for breath, feeling extremely tired.</p><p>He didn’t have abnormal stamina like Lou Cheng, and the long fight had already worn him out. While on the other side, Lou Cheng was still breathing evenly and only sweating a little!</p><p>“How can I continue fighting against him?” Qu Hui fell into another round of desperation and depression, almost giving up the thought of attacking.</p><p>“He hasn’t recovered from his internal injuries, he hasn’t recovered yet…” Qu Hui kept telling himself like a self-hypnosis.</p><p>“Yeah, he hasn’t recovered from his internal injuries yet. I will definitely influence him and create a chance to win through continuous fierce attacks!” Qu Hui took a deep breath and made up his mind.</p><p>He began another visualization, working his supernatural ability and stimulating all the spirit and blood within his body!</p><p>As a familiar feeling of strength began spreading out, Qu Hui’s face turned between red and black, finally calming down. It seemed that his body had become a little larger.</p><p>He returned to his peak form with the help of a secret technique!</p><p>Come on, let’s fight to the end and see who will be the winner!</p><p>Lou Cheng looked up, took a glance at Qu Hui, and slightly shook his head.</p><p>What does he mean? As the feeling of confusion flashed across Qu Hui’s mind, he again dived toward Lou Cheng like a fighter jet.</p><p>At this moment, Lou Cheng arched his backbone, raised both arms and threw out two separate balls, one of chilling cool light and the other of red flame.</p><p>Boom! The cool light and red flame burst and collided to form a mixture in front of Qu Hui, leaving behind a white fog that obscured his vision to some extent.</p><p>In the white world, Qu Hui suddenly noticed a figure flying towards him while several meters in the air!</p><p>Lou Cheng? His pupils constricted like two pinpoints as Qu Hui realized that his opponent had jumped above him.</p><p>This brought him both surprise and great joy. It was so unbelievable that Qu Hui doubted his own eyes.</p><p>Did Lou Cheng become silly? Is he giving up his advantages to fight me in midair?</p><p>What a wonderful mistake he’s making! I should kill myself if I still can’t defeat him!</p><p>This must be a gift from heaven!</p><p>When Qu Hui, who was too excited, was about to move, he saw Lou Cheng form a mudra seal with both hands while his facial expression turned serious.</p><p>“Bing!”</p><p>Upon hearing Lou Cheng’s low voice, Qu Hui shook abruptly, feeling as if he had been drawn into a battlefield full of thousands upon thousands of horses and soldiers, whose murderous look frightened him and made him panic.</p><p>Nine Words Formula, “Bing” Formula!</p><p>Lou Cheng fell down, catching Qu Hui by the shoulder and immediately pouring Frost Force into Qu Hui’s body, forcing Qu Hui to fall toward the ground from midair!</p><p>As the sound of wind poured into Qu Hui’s ears, he regained consciousness but was unable to escape from the control of Lou Cheng’s Frost Force. All he could do was to watch as he fell towards the ground.</p><p>Am I going to die… As soon as the idea occurred to Qu Hui, he felt himself slow down, suddenly landing on his back lightly.</p><p>Lou Cheng withdrew his hands and straightened his body, not intending to continue his attack on Qu Hui. While his opponent was frozen on the other side, unable to move for the moment.</p><p>“The fifth round, Lou Cheng wins!” The referee announced without hesitation, “The final result, Songcheng University Martial Arts Club wins!”</p><p>The referee’s words roused Qu Hui, but he still felt like he was dreaming.</p><p>I wouldn’t have lasted if Lou Cheng had used that attack from the beginning. So why did we fight for so long?</p><p>In confusion and desperation, he saw Lou Cheng give him a smile and then say softly,</p><p>“It’s so interesting to fight against someone with a flying supernatural ability.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
