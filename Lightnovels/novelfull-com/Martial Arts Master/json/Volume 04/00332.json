So he won’t be the last.”</p><p>“Why?” Sun Jian blurted out.</p><p>Isn’t it contradictory? Peng Leyun was the last one to fight last year against Huahai and Guangnan.</p><p>Yan Zheke smiled elegantly and glanced at Lou Cheng. “Because Lou Cheng has the supernatural ability that can restraint the corvine mouth. Unless Shanbei wants to give us a free victory, they will put Xu Wannian to the last. He might still encounter Cheng but it would be an exhausted Cheng so he would have a bigger chance of scoring a win. Also, nobody knows if Cheng’s lucky star could still protect him against the Corvine Mouth when worn out.”</p><p>No similar supernatural ability bearers can help with experiments. Even Lou Cheng himself can’t give you an answer but he doesn’t think it will be affected by his physical strength considering it is a result of the Jindan.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s explanation relived everyone from the tension and stress. They nodded their agreement.</p><p>“So Xu Wannian will be the last. Do you think Peng Leyun would lead the attack or play it safe to first send Fang Zhirong to consume us?” Asked Li Mao, lost in his own thought.</p><p>Cai Zongming waved. “Easy. Everybody can tell you without thinking.”</p><p>“Say it.” Sun Jian and Lin Hua turned to Ming with surprise and expectation on their face while Lou Cheng shot a questioning glance at him.</p><p>“Peng Leyun will either be the first or the second,” said Talker seriously.</p><p>Laughter burst out with some teeth grinding sound. Sun Jian was annoyed and amused. “You should be the first and use your gifted tongue to the full. We really want to Aruba you!”</p><p>Aruba is a game where a boy will be lifted and carried towards a column with his legs open and then rubbed against the column as a mental and physical torture.</p><p>“You guys are too stressed so I’ll help you loosen up a bit. Don’t hurt me, please!” Answered Cai Zongming with a smile which soon vanished when he noticed the sneer shared by Lou Cheng, Sun Jian and Li Mao. He quickly jumped back to the topic. “What I was trying to say is Peng Leyun being the first or the second has no impact on our order. Now we are sure Xu Wannian is to play the last, Lin Que should certain fight before Lou Cheng. Because Cheng has more advantages than Lin Que against Xu Wannian in case Fang Zhirong and Peng Leyun are dealt a defeat in turn.”</p><p>The first fighter of theirs will be kept to the last just like Xu Wannian in the other team or it will be a free round for the rival.</p><p>“Right.” Sun Jian thought about it and then nodded. “OK. We are not going to Aruba you.”</p><p>He Zi eyed at the seniors and listened carefully to their conversation. Shu Rui was denied access to the pre-match gathering by Geezer Shi to secure everyone’s best form.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s silence since Li Mao’s second question was then broken with a gentle smile.</p><p>“Actually, both Cheng and I think Peng Leyun will play the second.”</p><p>“Why?” Lin Hua and Li Mao turned to Lou Cheng and her.</p><p>Does this mean Peng Leyun attaches extra or little importance to us?</p><p>Lou Cheng looked at Yan Zheke with a loving smile, waiting for her to continue.</p><p>She pursed her lip together. “It’s not about Peng Leyun but Fang Zhirong’s personality and thought. He’s a cool and arrogant loner. He was mentioned briefly during the discussion about the favored fighters of the age but then buried by predictions about Peng Leyun confronting Cheng and Lin Que for this match between Shanbei and Songcheng University. I’m sure he’s not happy about it and desperately longing to prove himself. He will probably volunteer to be the first against Cheng or Lin Que in his best form, which Peng Leyun will most likely agree to since it makes no difference for him.”</p><p>“Considering Peng Leyun’s strength and confidence in himself, sure he will agree.” Lin Hua clapped with a sudden realization.</p><p>“So very likely Shanbei will play in the order of Fang Zhirong, Peng Leyun, and then Xu Wannian.” Sun Jian agreed.</p><p>Yan Zheke looked about and took a deep breath upon seeing Lou Cheng’s encouraging eyes before continuing,</p><p>“It leaves us with two possible plans which each has its pros and cons.”</p><p>“If Lin Que plays the vanguard, he will be worn a lot during the round with Fang Zhirong so he won’t be able to consume the Professional Six Pin Peng Leyun in the Dan stage. Then Cheng will confront Peng Leyun who might still have 80% of his strength. Cheng’s chance of winning will not be high but in case he does defeat Peng, he will have a great mental advantage against Xu Wannian. If he can’t defeat Peng Leyun, he will at least exhaust him to the extreme, giving our third fighter a chance to win.”</p><p>Xu Wannian is not strong enough to defeat a rival of the Professional Ninth Pin level with his Corvine Mouth even if it’s close to his physical limit. He simply won’t have the chance to talk.</p><p>Lou Cheng is no longer the legend with unlimited physical strength. Xu Wannian won’t change his mind.</p><p>They pondered on Yan Zheke’s words while waiting for her to explain the second plan. “If Lou Cheng takes the lead, he can take advantage of his physical strength and defeat Fang Zhirong with enough power left to drag Peng Leyun into a fierce fight, giving Lin Que a decent chance of a victory. It seems better than Plan A but the exhausted Peng Leyun still won’t be an easy target and will probably cause big trouble to Lin Que, laying a solid foundation for the Corvine Mouth to score an easy victory. Xu Wannian in his good form can deal one of us a defeat with ease.”</p><p>She turned to Geezer Shi who had remained quiet all this time. “Coach Shi, please choose one.”</p><p>Geezer Shi coughed and then laughed,</p><p>“Let’s decide our third fighter first. Li Mao, you take the place.”</p><p>“Yes, Coach Shi!” Answered Li Mao, pleasantly surprised.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s face fainted slightly, blaming her menstruation.</p><p>Since her physical attribute reached Professional Ninth Pin, her period had become very regular, rarely hastened or delayed. Tomorrow should be the first day and she prepared to fight today but she felt it was coming this afternoon under the great pressure from last year’s champion team.</p><p>Her body condition could handle a decent rival but Shanbei was a terrifying opponent whom they must exert themselves fully to strive for a win. She felt her weakened form and offered the great opportunity to the significantly improved Li Mao who was in his best form.</p><p>Hopefully senior brother Li Mao won’t be too nervous in the ring!</p><p>As her mood shifted up and down, she felt some warmth streaming in from her palm. Lou Cheng quietly grabbed her hand.</p><p>They locked eyes without a word.</p><p>Geezer Shi cleared his throat and continued with a sneer,</p><p>“Since the two plans both have pros and cons, we shall… ”</p><p>He chuckled before giving his decision.</p><p>“Take a draw!”</p><p>“Ahh? A draw?” Lou Cheng was stunned. So were other members.</p><p>He can’t be serious!</p><p>…</p><p>In Shanbei University’s locker room…</p><p>The grey-haired middle-aged coach Huang Qing glanced at Xu Wannian, “You will be the last.”</p><p>A well experienced coach in the university martial arts circle, this Professional Eighth Pin coach in the Dan stage was widely known for his expertise in teaching young fighters. He had trained numerous students to the Professional Ninth Pin level or higher and over ten of his students were in the Dan stage. Many martial arts clubs and schools made him sweet offers but he chose to stay in the university circle for the atmosphere and fairly good wages. Staying out of the spotlight, his achievement had been shadowed by Peng Leyun’s success in recent years.</p><p>“Yes!” Xu Wannian sounded relieved and pleased.</p><p>Before Huang Qing could continue, Fang Zhirong took a step forward abruptly.</p><p>“Coach, I want to take the first round.”</p><p>Looking at the stubbornness in his eyes and the freckles on his face, Huang Qiang subconsciously threw a glance at Peng Leyun who had just returned to reality from a trance with a careless smile.</p><p>“Okay. You’ll take the lead.” Huang Qing approved Fang Zhirong’s request.</p><p>This bad boy took a wrong path in his freshman year. Fortunately, he was corrected and instructed by Coach Huang in time and steadily improved to the Dan stage within a year, making the coach proud.</p><p>Fang Zhirong nodded with strength and took a very deep breath, looking out of the window.</p><p>I’ll prove it! I’m also a favored fight of the age!</p><p>…</p><p>This year a large video website purchased the broadcast. So the match between Shanbei and Songcheng University was only available online.</p><p>Brahma with two plaits hanging in front of her chest with snacks piled on the desk, completely lured by the broadcast, listening to the host and the guest commentator, an advanced Dan stage grandpa Zhang He.</p><p>“Thanks to senior Zhang’s analysis, now I know the key of today’s match is not if Songcheng University can win over Shanbei but if Lou Cheng and Lin Que can team up and defeat Peng Leyun,” said the host with excitement.</p><p>Many comments popped up on the screen above his head.</p><p>“I don’t think so.”</p><p>“Le, go for it! Prove that they are not qualified to be the favored fighters of the era!”</p><p>“A Professional Sixth Pin fighter’s physical strength is way beyond average. Peng Leyun does have a decent chance of defeating the two of them!”</p><p>“Fans of the Shangqing Sect check in!”</p><p>“Wuyue Club is not concerned. Lou Cheng will create another miracle!”</p><p>Apparently, Peng Leyun’s supporters had the advantage. Brahma pulled her plaits with anger and turned off the pop-up comment.</p><p>She was just so pissed off!</p><p>I better not read this!</p><p>…</p><p>In the Capital College Martial Arts Club office, members gathered together in front of the projector.</p><p>“The manager is still not here?” The delicate and pretty looking Shen You was very concerned.</p><p>A cute girl with big cheeks let out an ah sound before answering, “Sister said she would come over by herself. She… She asked me not to wait for her… ”</p><p>Shen You covered her face. “Damn! She must be lost again. I’ll give her a call. You guys watch.”</p><p>…</p><p>In the joyful atmosphere, Yan Xiaoling and Mu Jinnian felt rather terrified until Geezer Shi came out, followed by Lou Cheng and Lin Que. They immediately pulled themselves together and shook off fear, blowing their cheering horns.</p><p>As the two teams settled in their dedicated area, an high-ranked Dan Stage referee stepped into the ring. The announcement for the first round came out.</p><p>“Round One. Fang Zhirong… ”</p><p>The announcer paused on purpose to give Fang Zhirong a moment to enjoy the cheers and applause.</p><p>Then he continued in a flat tone.</p><p>“Versus Lin Que.”</p><p>A focal fight was about to start.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
