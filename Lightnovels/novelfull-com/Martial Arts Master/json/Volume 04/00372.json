It took them a while to realize what had just happened. Then they all felt stunned.</p><p>Not two minutes. Not even 20 seconds. Lou Cheng had defeated Han Peipei before her infrasound could cause any effect.</p><p>The host and the commentator had talked so much before the fight, making Han Peipei look like a tough rival.</p><p>…</p><p>Phew… Yan Zheke loosened her fists and waved at the ring. Cheng had betean Han Peipei and was safe and sound. There would be nothing to worry about.</p><p>Next to her, Li Mao and Lin Hua both rose, relieved from their biggest concern.</p><p>…</p><p>Yu Zhi suddenly stood up, gazing at the ring, his fat shaking on his body.</p><p>He couldn’t hear the commentator and didn’t check his watch, but he knew how fast Han Peipei had lost.</p><p>Lou Cheng was not injured. The fight didn’t even last long enough for the dizziness or nausea to take place.</p><p><em>How should I engage him in the next round?</em></p><p>…</p><p>“A 14 second real man… ” Okamoto’s Fan posted in Lou Cheng’s fans forum first.</p><p>“My Lou Cheng is too cool! That commentator’s mouth was wide enough to fit in a goose egg!” Eternal Nightfall sent an “I’m so awesome” emoji.</p><p>Brahma “wiggled back and forth” proudly. “That is my idol! Including the conversation time, the fight was not as long as the commentators’ analysis… ”</p><p>“Super Master Lou of one punch!” Wonton Seller rolled about in the form of a sticky rice ball. She liked to make emojis herself.</p><p>…</p><p>After leaving their comments with a tinge of emotion, Unparalleled Dragon King published his long post beginning with an amusing emoji. “Fighters with super powers can be very strong. Theoretically and practically, they can have a good chance in defeating those of a higher level. However, once an accident that they are unable to handle takes place, they become very fragile and their defeat will come like a collapsing mountain. I’m talking about fights between these kinds of fighters and a higher level rival.”</p><p>“Yeah. Who would have guessed that Lou Cheng had mastered another sound of the Nine Sounds Spell and that it happened to be a dramatic speed boost. It makes perfect sense for Han Peipei to lose like this,” replied Road to the Arena. Since their first encounter in Yanling, Lou Cheng has never failed to surprise him.</p><p>With the hints of Lou Cheng’s Army Formula and Forwarding Formula, someone got to the bottom of these ancient sounds and associated them with the Body-guarding Magic Arts of Nine Chinese Characters. Since Daxing Temple had a style called the six-syllabled Sanskrit mantra, he named this secret discipline the nine-syllabled Sanskrit mantra.</p><p>“But… But… Now Lou Cheng has revealed his trump card?” asked Wonton Seller, very concerned.</p><p>Unparalleled Dragon King laughed. “I think it’s worth it. It was necessary to finish Han Peipei fast, as fast as possible. Or he would’ve been injured over time and his performance in the upcoming matches would’ve been affected.”</p><p>“Internal injuries take quite some time to recover!”</p><p>…</p><p>In the broadcast studio, listening to the screams and claps from the audience, Chen Sansheng shut his mouth to resume his normal bearing.</p><p>“Yu Zhi doesn’t look good,” commented Host Liu Chang, watching Yu Zhi step to the flight of stone stairs like a heavy tank.</p><p>“Of course. Han Peipei lost the match that easily… Yu Zhi is going to suffer.” Since he was well experienced in the ring, Chen Sansheng quickly adjusted his mood and appeared relaxed again.</p><p>Liu Chang tilted her head and looked at her co-host of the day, puzzled. “Why is Yu Zhi going to suffer?”</p><p>“He is someone who is highly gifted. Yu Zhi is gifted with a layer of fat that provides him great might way beyond his level and protects him like a suit of armor. It’s too soft and sleek to be damaged by regular attacks.” Chen Sansheng tried to simplify his point. “If we were in a game, a character like Yu Zhi would be high in attack and defense and low in agility. Lou Cheng restrains him perfectly in every possible way.”</p><p>Liu Chang recalled the past matches. “I don’t think Yu Zhi is slow. His punches and slaps are almost too fast to follow.”</p><p>“His strikes are not slow, but his mobility is poor. Doesn’t that make him a living target for Lou Cheng?” Chen Sansheng gave his conclusion before adding details. “Yu Zhi’s current strength and Dan stage explosion power are close to a minor Professional Sixth Pin fighter. Those of his level can take two or three punches of his at their very best. He can easily take a few explosions in a row without being badly injured as long as his vital parts are secured. In case of any minor wounds, his fat will help him recover fully in no time.</p><p>“Because of this, he likes to play the ‘You give me one punch and I return you one’ game with capable rivals to cause damage at the cost of suffering damage. Usually, he can drag his enemy into a very difficult situation and then enjoy a fairly high chance of winning. But Lou Cheng is different. Simplified Physical Invulnerable Move plus super powers of ice and fire. When Lou Cheng throws these down, how many bouts can Yu Zhi handle? How many punches will Yu Zhi dare to take? When it comes to speed and response, Yu Zhi is no match. Isn’t he a living target?”</p><p>Liu Chang drew a deep breath in. “So… Yu Zhi is pretty much waiting for death?”</p><p>“If Lou Cheng was worn down greatly during the fight with Han Peipei, or if he was slowing down and suffering from dizziness, nausea, or even internal injuries, Yu Zhi would have the odds. Now… He-heh.” Chen Sansheng answered the question with his signature laughter.</p><p>“The Simplified Physical Invulnerable Move is deadly,” said Liu Chang with a tinge of emotion.</p><p>“Very! But not everyone can master the Simplified Physical Invulnerable Move. First, you need someone to pass it on to you. You can’t just create it from nothing unless you are one of those rare talents that can establish a sect. Then you must be able to achieve the full meditation status, which is actually rare among the Professional Seventh Pin martial artists. Thirdly, you need a super power or your body must reach the Professional Sixth Pin level physical attributes; otherwise, your Simplified Physical Invulnerable Move won’t have much of an effect… ” Chen Sansheng took the opportunity to popularize some science to the audience.</p><p>Partially recovered, Han Peipei concentrated to form the chill in her body into some white qi and breathed it out.</p><p>She turned around to leave, with apparent disappointment on her face and heaviness in her feet.</p><p>Yu Zhi tapped her shoulder before getting in the arena, his footsteps loud and showing off his weight.</p><p>It had become clear to him. Fighting his best was the only thing left for him.</p><p>He must break open a path of blood through difficulties and hardships.</p><p>He must play with the odds and drag himself out of the desperate situation.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Yu Zhi took his position, his fat shaking and shining.</p><p>The referee took a deep breath before raising his right hand. He called in a loud and clear voice,</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>Lou Cheng took half a step forward, his left hand hooked and left wrist shook, sending out a crystal clear white light along the ground. His right arm swung and shook to the opposite direction, throwing a fierce, red fireball at the enemy’s head.</p><p>Burning Ice and Flame!</p><p>He was taking advantage of Yu Zhi’s poor mobility.</p><p>Yu Zhi curved his back and jumped forward to dodge the cold light and confront the fireball like a rocky mountain.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>The fireball burst open, flames dancing in all directions and tearing Yu Zhi’s clothes apart. Yu Zhi’s fat was shaking, slightly burnt, displaying his excellent defense!</p><p>Bam! When he landed on the ground, the stage wobbled as if it had been hit by a giant stone.</p><p>Lou Cheng slid close to him, shrinking and then releasing his qi, blood, and spirit.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>His right arm inflated like a giant hammer, cutting towards Yu Zhi’s thick neck.</p><p>Yu Zhi didn’t give him a second look. He quickly swelled his neck and stretched out his right arm, making use of his height and long arm to slap Lou Cheng’s head rapidly.</p><p><em>My neck might not hurt badly from your strike, but your head can’t handle my slap for sure.</em></p><p><em>I might even hit you before you reach me!</em></p><p><em>Simplified Physical Invulnerable Move or not, you are going to lose!</em></p><p>Lou Cheng didn’t meet force with force. He released his forces and leaned forward to duck the slap. Then he quickly moved to Yu Zhi’s side and concentrated his force to throw another powerful punch at his waist.</p><p>Yu Zhi tightened the fat around his legs and threw a side kick to meet Lou Cheng’s strike in hopes of hurting him at the cost of his own injuries.</p><p>Lou Cheng flicked his tendons and pulled strength from his waist, dragging his body to Yu Zhi’s back. Yu Zhi kept up his footwork and turned around just in time.</p><p><em>“Not bad… ”</em> Lou Cheng praised silently, his left arm blocking his chest and right fist reaching out to the enemy’s lower stomach like a lightning bolt.</p><p>Yu Zhi played the same trick by stretching out his long arm like an ape, fat tightened and swollen, towards Lou Cheng’s head.</p><p>Lou Cheng suddenly drew his qi and blood back, concentrated his force at his lower stomach, and stopped his right punch by force. Relying on the balance of ice and fire, he didn’t release his qi this time. Instead, he quickly terminated the concentration of qi and calmed his strength down.</p><p>The left arm in front of his chest abruptly swung outward to engage Yu Zhi’s slap.</p><p>He visualized an ice bound river with frozen sprays and spindrifts.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Thunder clouds appeared and the entire world seemed to be shattering.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lou Cheng’s left arm hit Yu Zhi’s palm.</p><p>A layer of white frost instantly spread over Yu Zhi’s skin, the light in his eyes replaced by dullness and his left leg slowly whipping. His defense was indeed very impressive.</p><p>Lou Cheng swiftly slid to the side of Yu Zhi and again concentrated his force, taking advantage of his temporary dullness and slowness to throw another punch at him.</p><p>Phew!</p><p>The punch hit Yu Zhi’s ribs, his fat shaking wildly, soft and sleek. He barely recovered from the Severe Warning and rushed to shrink his blood, qi, force, and the cold wave.</p><p>Lou Cheng picked up his pace at once, moved rapidly, and exploded again and again, leaving his enemy no time to recover.</p><p>Double Explosion… Then Triple Explosion, Quadruple Explosion, Quintuple… Bam! Bam! Bam! Lou Cheng continued to move agilely, both his arms swinging, hitting Yu Zhi in turn. Yu Zhi’s fat turned red as if it were about to break open.</p><p>Even an iron body couldn’t handle such strikes from Lou Cheng. He was very close to a severe injury when he suddenly threw himself forward at Lou Cheng, attempting to pin him down with his entire body weight and turn the tables.</p><p>Phoom!</p><p>The sound of wind whistled as Yu Zhi smashed towards Lou Cheng like a collapsing mountain. Lou Cheng, after watching many of his fight videos, came prepared. His tendons flicked and he switched to the northerly wind footwork to duck the bump swiftly. He turned around and concentrated his force to throw a whip kick at the rival’s back.</p><p>Bam! Yu Zhi flew out, hitting the ground really hard. Tiles were smashed and small pieces of rocks flew up into the air.</p><p>He struggled on the ground but couldn’t pull himself together to get up. If it was another fighter, he would have been killed long ago and the referee would have interfered long ago.</p><p>The referee glanced at Lou Cheng, knowing Lou Cheng had no intention to continue striking. He then raised his right hand and announced the result,</p><p>“Round two, Lou Cheng!”</p><p>The audience in the stadium was in a dead silence. Liu Chang and Chen Sansheng in the broadcast studio were left speechless.</p><p>It was too fast… And too brutal…</p><p>Nobody knew what to say at that moment.</p><p>After a moment of silence, the audience’s passion was ignited. Shouts and yells came from the stands.</p><p>“One vs three!”</p><p>The shouts gathered and formed a flood.</p><p>“One vs three!”</p><p>“One vs three!”</p><p>“One vs three!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
