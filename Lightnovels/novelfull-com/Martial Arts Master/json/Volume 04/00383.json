He instinctively began thinking about how he could win this round.</p><p>Though his mistake earlier had pushed him close his limits, he would not just relax and perfunctorily fight in the upcoming round.</p><p>This was a group competition! The winner was the one who laughed last!</p><p>Though Lin Que was far superior to Piao Yuan, Yan Zheke could not match up to Jingjing at all. Thus, from the overall look of things, the outcome could still go either way. So he should do as much as he could to weaken his opponents for the sake of his teammates!</p><p>Too bad it was no longer a secret that his stamina was not limitless. Otherwise, he could try and trick Piao Yuan and find a chance to win…</p><p>When Piao Yuan placed his feet in the specified position, his heart was rapidly beating in hesitation.</p><p>He knew his opponent was close to exhaustion after defeating Senior Brother An, but Lou Cheng was nevertheless a mighty Sixth Pin fighter even if he was currently incapable of making the Dan stage burst. Piao Yuan dared not look down on him at all. A cornered beast struggling in its last minutes was typically the most dangerous!</p><p>He was an impulsive person and constantly had conflicts with others, resulting in constant punishments since primary school. In the eyes of his classmates and neighbors, he was a bad person. However, aggressive as he was, he was never sent to jail. Was that not enough to mean something?</p><p>True, he had a strong physique and a fierce-looking face. His terrified opponents would never dare to fight back. But that also meant that he knew how to control his strength when fighting others. He would never lose control simply due to anger. He was still quite a thoughtful person! He was precisely what people called a coarse-looking but thoughtful man!</p><p>Facing Lou Cheng in his current weakened state, he still emphasized on giving a steady performance. He had no plans to risk his life to win!</p><p>With these thoughts flashing across his mind, he parted his feet and went into his stance without hesitation.</p><p>The referee took a deep breath, deciding to switch with the game supervisor after this round.</p><p>He raised up his hand and put it down suddenly, making his announcement.</p><p>“Begin!”</p><p>Disregarding what his opponent was planning to do, Piao Yuan gathered strength in both legs. Swaying like a massive bear, he ran more than ten meters to his right with unsteady steps.</p><p>No matter what, dodging first would never be the wrong move!</p><p>He must not give Lou Cheng the chance to accelerate his movement with the burst of the Xing Formula. Senior Brother An was forced into passivity since the start of the match because of his carelessness!</p><p>Lou Cheng watched in surprise and nearly burst out laughing. He decided not to move and lowered his eyes. His expression seemed to suggest that he was daring Piao Yuan to run even further, while he would remain in place. He was actually taking the time to adjust his condition with pranayama to restore as much of his vigor as possible.</p><p>Seeing this situation, Piao Yuan became alarmed and immediately changed his direction to interrupt Lou Cheng’s relaxation.</p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p>Stomping the ground with his elephant feet, he rushed to Lou Cheng like the wind regardless of his tall and strong body.</p><p>The Elephant Bumping move of the Elephant Style!</p><p>Elephants were heavy, but they could run fast!</p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump! The arena was shaking under Piao Yuan’s feet!</p><p>He swung the center of his gravity when he neared Lou Cheng and dashed behind Lou Cheng like an antelope, his figure making a perfect arc through the air. He limbered up his muscles and joints and transformed into a fierce bear pouncing on his prey!</p><p>The Giant Bear Hitting the Tree move of the Bear Style!</p><p>This trick was close to the strength of Seventh Pin. Never mind a tree, Piao Yuan could even break an iron pillar with this move!</p><p>The minute he was about to touch his opponent, the unmoving Lou Cheng suddenly jumped one step ahead. Both looked as if they had rehearsed the scene hundreds or thousands of times.</p><p>The back of Lou Cheng’s head may not have eyes, but his mind had an Ice Mirror!</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Completly missing his target, Piao Yuan’s terrifying force sizzled and exploded in the air. He could tell something was off and immediately drove all his qi and blood to flow back with his Force Concentration.</p><p>Stepping onto the ground with his toes, Lou Cheng turned around to pounce at his opponent.</p><p>He raised his arm high up in the air, visualizing an ice-bound river and shaking thunderclouds.</p><p>The simplified physical invulnerability, Severe Warning!</p><p>Lou Cheng didn’t choose Internal Explosion, for he was still looking for a chance to win the match instead of just weakening his opponent!</p><p>Since he had used up all his Power of Blaze and Frost, his simplified physical invulnerability moves like Severe Warning and Internal Explosion were all significantly weakened. So his punch with the latter would just impact Piao Yuan’s internal organs and deal him a light injury; it would not strip him of his ability to fight.</p><p>Severe Warning, on the other hand, was still capable of slowing Piao Yuan down and making him rigid, though it would not freeze his spirit and mind as efficiently as before. It would be very brief but enough to give Lou Cheng an advantage in their hand-to-hand combat.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>Lou Cheng pulled his punch downwards, causing a sound that seemed like a bell echoing throughout the arena.</p><p>Piao Yuan’s gathered qi, blood, spirit, and force suddenly burst out and caused his body to swell. However, he could neither punch nor kick back like usual. Instead, he carefully stomped the ground, breaking several black tiles in the process, and retreated quickly.</p><p>No matter what, escaping from Lou Cheng would never be the wrong move!</p><p>Smack! Lou Cheng did not know if he was annoyed or amused when his fist once again touched the air. This man looked like a strong and fierce one! He had heard about Piao Yuan’s bad reputation and that he was an expert at bullying others. How could he be so cowardly and cautious?</p><p>He did not allow himself to be disappointed. He immediately withdrew his force and made a burst under his feet.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Lou Cheng jumped in the air, leaving the floor cracking behind him, and threw himself at Piao Yuan. He stretched out both hands and shook his wrists to cover his opponent’s body with the Force of the Ice Sect. He faked some of his moves to confuse Piao Yuan.</p><p>The thirteenth movement of the Ice Sect, Endless Snow!</p><p>Without his supernatural ability, he could only depend on the motions of Frost Force to lower the surrounding temperature and create the thin, white mist.</p><p>Knowing he was unable to dodge in time in the mist and snow, Piao Yuan tightened the muscles in his thighs and kicked at Lou Cheng in advance, for he had already made a plan to deal with Lou Cheng’s movement while watching the video of his matches before. He knew that Lou Cheng’s next movement was usually the one called “Cold Starting from the Foot”, while his kicking in advance would throw Lou Cheng’s action into the net.</p><p>Simultaneously, Piao Yuan shook his elbows and raised both hands to hide his vital parts. He gave the impression of inviting Lou Cheng to just hit him.</p><p>Lou Cheng had already foreseen all this in his Ice Mirror. He did not panic and took a step back to his left, leaving Piao Yuan’s kick to land in the air.</p><p>He then leaned forward and forcibly changed the moving direction of his hands. After dodging his opponent’s attack, he hit Piao Yuan squarely on the shoulders.</p><p>Not every action of Snow Cover was fake!</p><p>A shocked Piao Yuan immediately landed his feet heavily on the ground upon seeing that his shoulders were about to get hit. He forced his body to squat so Lou Cheng’s fists may hit their targets but would not be able to use their force.</p><p>Crack, crack! Lou Cheng exerted strength in his joints and stretched his fascia. His fingers were stretched wide, holding onto Piao Yuan’s shoulders as he jumped using the borrowed strength.</p><p>This frightened Piao Yuan so much that he recalled the trick that made An Chaoyang fail. He first dodged, simultaneously trying to make his qi and blood flow backward and creating a burst of force in his Dantian aimed at his front.</p><p>Just then, Lou Cheng grasped his shoulders with his fingers. Gaining strength from his abdominal muscles, Lou Cheng lifted Piao Yuan up and threw him midair!</p><p>“Beautiful move!” In the studio, Chen Sansheng instantly praised Lou Cheng’s performance.</p><p>This series of movements were so great that they deserved a spot in textbooks and training manuals!</p><p>In the seats for the Songcheng team, Yan Zheke’s mouth was slightly open. She looked both dumbfounded and happy.</p><p>After throwing Piao Yuan into the air, Lou Cheng landed on the ground and visualized a massive and great sun in his mind.</p><p>This time, he knew he was at his limit and decided not to use Severe Warning. He switched to the use of Internal Explosion to cause the most damage possible!</p><p>He wanted to see how Piao Yuan would dodge this time!</p><p>Though he had adjusted his body in time in midair, Piao Yuan could not stop himself from falling at a high speed since he did not have a flying supernatural ability. Contracting and relaxing all his muscles, Piao Yuan fell upon Lou Cheng like a meteorite.</p><p>The hot air instantly condensing, Lou Cheng’s great sun transformed into Zhu Rong, the God of Fire with the head of a human and the body of a beast whose feet were upon on a fiery dragon. Lou Cheng neither dodged nor blocked the attack. Instead, he lowered his center of gravity and threw his punch upwards.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Soaring Blast!</p><p>Bang! Piao Yuan’s fist met Lou Cheng’s Internal Explosion.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>As the force and qi exploded within his body, Piao Yuan felt all his five viscera and six bowels shaking. Even his eyes turned red.</p><p>Under the great force of the burst of Dan, Lou Cheng, who was at his limit, dashed backward to prevent a leg fracture.</p><p>Thump! Piao Yuan was unable to keep his stance and was about to fall. At the urgent moment, he defused most of the outburst with his Force Concentration and once again balanced himself. He then dashed away, keeping a 20-meter distance from Lou Cheng.</p><p>Yes, nearly 20 meters from Lou Cheng!</p><p>How could such a fierce-looking man be such a faint-hearted bandit? How could he be so cunning and flexible? Lou Cheng, who had planned on bullying the guy for a while, could no longer hold back his smile. He shook his head.</p><p>Seeing that his remaining strength was not enough for him to maintain his Ice Mirror, he raised his right hand and gave up the round.</p><p>The referee seemed dumbfounded by Lou Cheng’s relaxed manner. He only reacted after two seconds and raised his arm.</p><p>“Round two, Piao Yuan wins!”</p><p>Piao Yuan was inexplicably moved. If Lou Cheng continued to persist, he had no idea if he could really win this round.</p><p>In the seats for Songcheng, Lin Que jumped up immediately. He was long prepared for this moment, having changed out of his jacket and put away his towel.</p><p>He had been waiting for this for a long time!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
