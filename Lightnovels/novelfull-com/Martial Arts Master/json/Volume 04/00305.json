After hearing their conversation, her eyes suddenly became bright.</p><p><em>That would be amazing! Amazing!</em></p><p><em>A direct confrontation between two Heavenly Sons. We can distinguish who is stronger on the first day of the special training!</em></p><p><em>Is the internal sparring within the Martial Arts Club of Songcheng University always this exciting?</em></p><p>Her feet stopped, her spirits rose, and her eyes sparkled as she signaled the cameraman to get a better spot and grab the golden spot beside the ring!</p><p>At this moment, Geezer Shi turned around and asked,” Shu, aren’t you gonna leave?”</p><p>Shu Rui pretended she did not understand what he had just said. She replied in a very cute way,” Please allow us to stay a few more minutes, please.”</p><p>“No, no, I’m sorry, but you can’t. We’re going to have to clear people out as this concerns the secret of the Martial Arts Club’s preparations for war.” Old man Shi had a lot of experience, so it wasn’t easy to deceive him, and he directly answered the question.</p><p>Shu Rui begged him, as if she had been wronged, “Coach Shi, we aren’t strangers! We have had so many interviews before and we guarantee you that we will not divulge the secret to other people. Before the show is broadcast, I will ask you to go over it and see if there is anything I should not display.”</p><p>“No, sorry, we can’t.” Shi Jianguo said and then shook his head with a smile.</p><p>“We can sign a guarantee!” Shu Rui raised her arm to swear.</p><p>Geezer Shi stayed emotionless and said,” Please go and keep the audience in suspense.”</p><p>“All right.” Realizing the resolute determination of this Mighty One with physical invulnerability, Shu Rui replied dejectedly. She told the camera team to leave, but they walked at a snail’s pace, turning one step into three, which almost trampled all the ants on the ground to death.</p><p>The moment they exited the arena, she heard the sound of footsteps behind her. She became excited because she thought Coach Shi had changed his mind.</p><p><em>Constantly bear it in mind, we will get good results!</em></p><p>Shu Rui turned back. Then she saw Cai Zongming. She smiled very gently and asked,</p><p>“Club manager, what brings you here?”</p><p>Cai Zongming looked at her in a very appreciative way, but even if he was willing to help he was powerless to render assistance, so he said,</p><p><em>“Locking the door.”</em></p><p>Locking the door… Shu Rui looked at him while he closed the door and as she was turning back she heard the sound of the door shutting, “bang!”, the lock clasped.</p><p>The wind was blowing, and her hair was dancing with it.</p><p>After a long time, she turned around and asked the photographer and the rest of the team to leave, in a low voice,</p><p>“Let’s go”</p><p>“Shu, don’t worry too much about this. This happens all the time. No one would allow strangers to leak out their secret by letting them shoot their private competition.” The beauty frowned, but the photographer didn’t have a heart of stone, so he comforted her.</p><p>“I understand,” Shu Rui was full of energy again as she replied with a big smile, “but I don’t know whether I should say this… ”</p><p>…</p><p>Wu Meng and Jiang Fusheng helped Li Xiaowen invite all the students who were training in the arena to the Strength Training Gymnasium and told them to stay inside for a while, and maybe use the training devices to kill time. But they returned to the arena themselves and surrounded the arena in order to watch the game.They were waiting for the next game to begin with a lot of interest.</p><p>It looks like this has become a Martial Arts Club tradition?</p><p>It was the first day of the special training, and also the fight between Lin Que and Lou Cheng!</p><p>Even though Lin Que had defeated Lou Cheng last time, Lou Cheng progressed a lot and even won the championship of the Youth Match, which endowed him the capability of being a Seventh-Pin. This time, who can tell which one is stronger?</p><p>——However, they didn’t think that Lou Cheng was guaranteed to succeed because Lin Que had already entered Dan Stage this June. After three months of hard training, it was difficult to say which level he was really at!</p><p>But Yan Zheke knew them very well. She was going to say something about this, but, in the end, she decided to remain silent.</p><p><em>This sort of thing, I’d better let them solve by themselves. It’s the basic principle among fighters. No matter how close we are, we shouldn’t get too involved in their fights.</em></p><p>Based on what she knew about Lou Cheng and Lin Que, she was sure that they would spend all their might fighting, without considering any other factors.</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled at his girlfriend and stepped onto the stage. He was very curious about how much his Brother-in-law had improved during these two months.</p><p><em>The Dan Stage training method?</em></p><p><em>The moves to deal with other moves?</em></p><p><em>He has officially become an apprentice of Shushan Study and has probably learned some tactics from the Fighting Sect.</em></p><p><em>What a pity. I just learned a new move this morning, but I haven’t made any progress on it. Other than the external release of force and some rough applications. Because I can replace it with my supernatural ability, I can, for the moment, skip the hardest part…</em> Lou Cheng was thinking about many things simultaneously, and at the end, he stood beside his teacher.</p><p><em>Fighting to my full potential is the only way to truly respect Brother-in-law!</em></p><p>Lin Que was already there waiting for him. His eyes were cold but also burning in a rather contradictory manner.</p><p>“It’s just a simple fight, so we won’t leave you time for meaningless chatter.” Geezer Shi cleared his throat and said, “just begin.”</p><p>The moment right after he said that, Lin Que’s qi and blood immediately expanded and contracted. He was like a bomb that was about to explode as he bombarded the enemy. It was so fast that Lou Cheng almost thought that he was going to break the speed of sound.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The explosive sound of qi and Lin Que arrived almost at the same time, which didn’t give Lou Cheng any time to dodge, nor the time to use his “Severe Warning”. So instead of retreating, he just readjusted his center of gravity, contracted his muscles, and used all his energy to counter-attack. He gave him a hard blow, like thunder.</p><p><em>We’ll see which is stronger, my exploding 24 Blizzard Strikes of Dan Stage or your Yin-yang Twist of Dan Stage!</em></p><p>When they were about to collide head-on, Lin Que stopped suddenly, his right arm swelled, and his fist swung out. It was so fast that it appeared to be dragging his shadow.</p><p>But this hit didn’t land on Lou Cheng. Instead, it landed on the vacant space between them.</p><p>Poom!</p><p>Starting with Lin’s empty fist, it seemed as though a small bomb had been detonated in place, and the shock wave, wrapped in the air, rushed toward Lou Cheng, tearing at his body.</p><p>A hit like an exploding mountain!</p><p>Fighting Sect, No. 127, Meteor Blast!</p><p>Lou Cheng was very surprised by this move. He defended against the attack, being knocked directly backwards, with his fingers wide open as his left arm bounced back.</p><p>He wobbled backwards from the huge shockwave while defending skillfully.</p><p>After his first move, Lin Que continued attacking with the rest of his moves. First, he continuously erupted twice. With his right leg supporting him, he took a step forward with his left foot, as if he was digging up soil.</p><p>Bang! The ground he stood upon was intact, but the surface around him exploded into pieces like a volcanic eruption. The pieces turned into hidden weapons that shot upwards.</p><p>Fighting Sect, NO.116, Earth Cracking!</p><p>The moment when Lou Cheng was confronting the shock wave, he felt the big explosive force from Lin. He lost his center of gravity and he had to deal with all the pieces that were attacking him.</p><p>At the crucial juncture, Lou Cheng bent his leg and held up his qi. First, he used the Dan realm to relax his muscle, which counteracted part of the force from the hidden weapons, and then he used all his energy to pull off an explosion to defend against the pieces. His muscle even began to swell and turn black.</p><p>At this moment, Lin Que still didn’t let him fight back. When Lou Cheng was approaching, Lin Que stretched out his right hand and opened his hand, reaching out towards him.</p><p>Continuous attacks!</p><p>In the Fighting Sect, a move that can attack seven times in a row, with both ranged combat and close combat, would be the famous move of physical invulnerability, Fighting Sect No.6, “Big Dipper Kill”!</p><p>If you can only manage five, four or three attacks in a row, then that would be the subordinate, No.1.</p><p>But of course, “subordinate” was a relative word. It was still too formidable. There were only 9 levels in the physical invulnerability stage of the Fighting Sect, and what Lin Que used at the moment was just a rudimentary one.</p><p>Fighting Sect, No.10, Doomed Death!</p><p>Seeing that the right hand of his Brother-in-law was about to catch him and finish his continuous attacks, Luo Cheng took a breath and shook his right hand.</p><p>A glowing white light shot onto the floor and leapt from one side to the other rapidly, rushing at Lin Que!</p><p>The 26th movement of the Ice Sect, Ice Burning!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
