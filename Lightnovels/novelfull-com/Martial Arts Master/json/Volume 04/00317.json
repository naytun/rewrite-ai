In the visiting team’s locker room, Geezer Shi clapped his hands to get the attention of the fighters.</p><p>“It’s about time. Let’s get started. When we fight against Shanbei, we have to get the misers in our school to book a hotel and pay for it, and we also need to arrive there one day earlier. We should never be exhausted like this again.”</p><p>Actually, their Martial Arts Club had a budget, but Geezer Shi would make sure to get some assistance if he had a rightful cause. All he really had to do was excite the Principal and join him for a drink.</p><p>For the group competition, Songcheng University Martial Arts Club, who had not displayed a favorable performance last year, would have to fight on its opponents’ home ground. Even in the quarterfinals. Li Liantong, Zong Yanru, and the others deeply regretted that none of their matches would be fought at Songcheng University. They wouldn’t have the chance to join the crowd and cheer for their team.</p><p>Therefore, Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke were energized when they chatted with each other and promised to do better this year. That way they would have more matches in their home ground next year.</p><p>“Coach Shi, I am afraid that the school would only pay for a hostel,” said Cai Zongming, warming up and teasing.</p><p>“They wouldn’t dare!” Geezer Shi said, “Are we beggars or what? They can either turn us down or pay the bill.”</p><p>As they talked, Li Xiaowen stepped in, smiling, and said, “Coach Shi, the supervisor is asking for the list.”</p><p>“Alright.” Geezer Shi took a look at Lou Cheng and his teammates, saying, “We cannot let ourselves’ accidentally trip over such a small stone, right? Both Lou Cheng and Lin Que are fighting today.”</p><p>At this point, Lou Cheng couldn’t help glancing at Lin Que. He noticed Lin Que looking at him, and they could both sense each other’s will to fight.</p><p>Since the beginning of the semester, for the first time, the two leading figures of the Songcheng Martial Arts Club would fight as a team!</p><p>Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke exchanged a smile, while making eye contact, as they reached a mutual understanding. They had both expected the arrangement, while Li Mao, Lin Hua, and others who were relaxing a little bit became more determined.</p><p>They worried that Coach Shi would be headstrong and deploy a substitute at this critical point, saving part of the main force.</p><p>“However,” said Geezer Shi, “Shannan is not a formidable opponent, and we still need to accumulate combat experience. Here is the order. Lou Cheng, you will be the last to fight. Otherwise, your teammates would only get to watch, right?”</p><p>The locker room exploded in roars of laughter. Everyone was aware of Lou Cheng’s incredible physical power, and they were excited.</p><p>“As you wish, master!” Lou Cheng answered joyfully.</p><p>After he became a formal apprentice, Lou Cheng was entitled to call Geezer Shi master in public.</p><p>“Another one. Let us stick to the principle of taking turns. Sun Jian, you are first.” Without hesitation, Shi Jianguo pointed at the most experienced fighter in Martial Arts Club.</p><p>With the support of Lin Que and Lou Cheng, Sun Jian had no pressure as their vanguard, so he laughed and said,</p><p>“I can finally enter the arena today!”</p><p>Lou Cheng turned his head to hide his laughter. It was in preliminaries when Sun Jian, the senior brother, had been made fun of, and he still remembered!</p><p>Yan Zheke also smiled and winked at Lou Cheng, hinting that it was all his fault!</p><p>She was excited. Although she was in good condition, it seemed she might not be fighting today.</p><p>Li Xiaowen, standing beside them, wrote down the list swiftly, “Sun Jian, Lin Que, Lou Cheng”.</p><p>When the crowd calmed down, Geezer Shi waved his hand and said, “As for substitutes, let us follow the old rules: Li Mao, Cai Zongming, Lin Hua.”</p><p>After his announcement, Geezer Shi looked at He Zi and Wang Dali, then said, “Neither of you may enter the field this semester. Feel free to look around, gain some experience, and concentrate on your Ranking Event.”</p><p>“Yes, Coach Shi!” Both of them, feeling fresh and honored, answered with determination.</p><p>Of course, He Zi was interested in becoming a reporter in the field.</p><p>The first team and substitutes were confirmed. Li Xiaowen turned around and headed to submit the list.</p><p>When the door of the locker room opened, Lou Cheng found the arena was crammed with cheering students, and very few empty seats.</p><p>“The fans of martial arts in Shannan are passionate… ” said Lou Cheng. He was impressed. The scene reminded him of the daughter of the taxi driver.</p><p>She must be one of the students among the crowd, not attracting any attention. However, since many little drops make an ocean, every single viewer contributed to the lively atmosphere that made a fighter like him deeply touched and inspired.</p><p>“Let’s get started,” said Geezer Shi, as he waved his hand and coughed.</p><p>The gate was opened. The martial arts arena of Shannan University greeted the eyes of Lou Cheng, Yan Zheke, and the others.</p><p>The audience held huge banners bearing the slogan,</p><p>“Stand together through storms and stress!”</p><p>Win or lose, we will stand together through storms and stress!</p><p>As the fighters of Martial Arts Club of Songcheng University came in, one side of the grandstand burst out cheering,</p><p>“Shannan University!”</p><p>The audience on another side of grandstand shouted loudly in response,</p><p>“We will never give in!”</p><p>The audience made a sound so loud that any fighter with weak mentality would be shivering and would not be able to bring their full potential into play.</p><p>However, most of the members of Songcheng Martial Arts Club were experienced fighters. After experiencing the home ground match in Yimo, a hell on earth, they were not terrified by the audience here.</p><p>As waves of cheering quieted down, the referee mounted the arena, while the first match was announced on the loudspeaker,</p><p>“From Songcheng Martial Arts Club — Sun Jian!”</p><p>“From Shannan Martial Arts Club… ”</p><p>The broadcaster paused deliberately, giving some time for the audience to respond, and then he raised his voice.</p><p>“Lin Xiaozhi!”</p><p>“Lin Xiaozhi!” The audience answered with extreme passion. The Shannan team actually seemed to have the upper hand, instead of looking hopeless like they appeared in public opinion.</p><p>“Lin Xiaozhi… ” Lou Cheng seemed lost in thought.</p><p>He shared the same view as Yan Zheke, that, regardless of supernatural ability, Lin Xiaozhi was better than Mu Yu in martial arts, and Lin Xiaozhi stood a good chance of making it to Dan stage!</p><p>“I have a feeling that Sun, our senior brother, might slip a little… ” Yan Zheke whispered in Lou’s ear, suppressing laughter.</p><p>“Do not say that… It would be helpful for Sun, before he becomes a professional, to experience the full power of a leading fighter.” Lou Cheng answered earnestly and then said with a teasing tone, “Anyway, his opponent is not Mu Yu, right?”</p><p>Sun Jian did not hear their discussion. He gave fist bumps with his teammates and then strode to the stage, standing on the right side of the referee. He noticed that Lin Xiaozhi was taking off her beads and cross, handing them to the supervisor.</p><p><em>“So the story goes…”</em> Sun sighed with emotion, and widened his eyes because Lin Xiaozhi has not done yet!</p><p>She took out a small Tantra bell from her pocket, rolled up her trouser legs, untied a red string with strange characters on it, and drew out a lucky star from her coiled hair…</p><p><em>“Holy, what else does she have hidden…? She is quite a superstitious fighter.” Sun Jian was at a loss whether to cry or laugh.</em></p><p>After a while, Lin Xiaozhi was all set. Before stepping on the stage, she urged the supervisor again, “Sir, please look after my stuff. I had a feeling our team leader will outperform himself tonight! I do not want to be out of luck… ”</p><p>She mumbled in silence, and moved in front of Sun Jian, showing an apologetic smile.</p><p>The referee announced the start of the greeting ceremony.</p><p>“May I ask if they work?” Sun Jian yielded to curiosity.</p><p>He was not trying to stimulate his opponent because he wanted to behave with dignity in front of a lady.</p><p>Lin Xiaozhi nodded sincerely.</p><p>“They do indeed!”</p><p>“I have tested them myself. When our team leader used his ability, the rebound would affect me 7 or 8 cases out of 10 if I did not wear them. Now it is 4 at most.”</p><p>“I used to believe in science but now I’m more into metaphysics.”</p><p>“It seems like an unbearable situation to me.” Sun Jian felt pity for her and replied.</p><p>Lin Xiaozhi opened her mouth as if she was about to speak about her suffering. However, she just heaved a sigh.</p><p>“Alas… ”</p><p>Sun Jian made no more comments so as not to arouse bad luck. On the other side, Lin Xiaozhi spent every minute getting accustomed to fighting without all the amulets.</p><p>Once the audience settled down, the referee raised his right hand and the match began,</p><p>“Begin now!”</p><p>Lin Xiaozhi’s back curved into a bow shape. Using the elasticity of her muscles and bones, she suddenly bounced forward like an elegant yet dangerous cheetah. Sun Jian barely had time to react.</p><p>Instead of drawing back, Sun Jian moved forward. Most of the audience was stupefied. Sun Jian dashed towards his powerful opponent as if he was going to fight her face to face.</p><p>They were about to ram into each other. At this point, Sun Jian stamped his right foot hard on the ground, forcing himself in another direction and moving quickly to Lin Xiaozhi’s side.</p><p>That was the Catapulting Movement of modern Xingyi!</p><p>Crack! Sun Jian drew up straight, moving his shoulders and waving arms. It was his best Forward Punch in recent matches. He tried to take the upper hand and leave no opening for Lin Xiaozhi to exploit.</p><p>Lin Xiaozhi failed to catch him, but she secured her position and maintained her balance by adjusting her spine immediately.</p><p>And then she swung her left arm backwards violently.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Sun Jian stepped back, using some of his force to decrease Lin Xiaozhi’s momentum. Then Sun Jian leapt forward a little, attacking with a Half-step Burst Fist!</p><p>The Brutal Blizzard was roaring harder!</p><p>Lin Xiaozhi kept a straight face and took a deep breath. And then her face flushed a little bit and her temples began to swell up. She swayed her body, striking with a Modern Blast Punch.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>Her fist was trembling in the air as if it was influenced by the wind.</p><p>Bang! The fists met causing a great thunder to resound. Sun Jian was dazed and knocked out by the blast!</p><p>His Qi and blood were rolling, and his internal organs were suffering. His muscles and bones were shaking so hard that he could not put forth any strength.</p><p>Lin Xiaozhi took this chance to attack. Her Eagle Claw stretched out, stopping in front of Sun Jian’s throat.</p><p>“The first round, Lin Xiaozhi wins!” The referee declared.</p><p>“Tremor Punch?” Yan Zheke stood up, murmuring to herself, and unwittingly caught a glimpse of her boyfriend.</p><p>“Yep.” Lou Cheng nodded.</p><p>It was Lin Xiaozhi’s Modern Blast Punch that brought about the Tremor force!</p><p>And that was something new she had never shown!</p><p>Li Mao and others were astounded. The poker-faced Lin Que got up and flung his clothes on the ground!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
