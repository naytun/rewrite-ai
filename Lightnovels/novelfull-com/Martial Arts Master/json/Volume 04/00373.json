He turned his gaze toward the seats of the Hudong University team. The thin and tall Wu Yong was gradually rising to his feet, wearing a solemn expression.</p><p>It seemed rather pointless to leave a Professional Ninth Pin opponent to his brother-in-law…</p><p>Everyone could also tell that he still had the strength to continue. If he left the arena now, he would be blamed for being arrogant. This was a form of disrespect toward Wu Yong…</p><p>Besides, he had never fought three matches in one go. He wanted to try it!</p><p>If he had already defeated two of them, what did it matter if he added another one? He might as well go for it!</p><p>With his decision made, Lou Cheng shifted his feet and once again adjusted his body into the proper stance to indicate he was ready for the third round. Inside, he was getting excited.</p><p>Whatever life experience he had, however mature he gradually grew, none of that could mask the fact that he was still just a 20-year-old. Vigor and vitality had yet to leave him.</p><p>Wasn’t there a song that described such a feeling? The song probably meant that no matter how a person aged, the young person he once was would always remain in his heart.</p><p>The moment Lou Cheng made a stance, the audience understood his intentions and began another wave of cheers.</p><p>One-versus-three was not a common sight in the finals of National University Martial Arts Competitions!</p><p>…</p><p>In the studio, the host, Liu Chang, was laughing. “Looks like Lou Cheng really plans to fight three matches.”</p><p>Chen Sansheng shook his head with a smile. “It can’t be helped. In a situation where your opponents are clearly stronger, one mistake will lead to your demise. We could already predict the result from when Han Peipei failed to avoid Lou Cheng’s newly-learned Nine Words Formula. Earlier, I predicted Yu Zhi would be a live target, but I didn’t think he would lose so quickly and badly.”</p><p>“Exactly. I thought he could take at least a few moves from Lou Cheng with all that fat on his body. Who knows…” Liu Chang sighed.</p><p>In the end, Yu Zhi was defeated effortlessly while his team was having a three-game losing streak. That was too embarrassing!</p><p>“He can’t help it. Yu Zhi’s method is to force his opponent to fight him recklessly. With such circumstances, coupled with his personal aptitude, it is too much to ask for him to defend himself against Lou Cheng’s simplified physical invulnerability movements. It is only a matter of time before he loses.” While staring at Wu Yong, who was slowly making his way to the arena, Chen Sansheng said, “Lou Cheng’s balance of the Dan realm and qi and blood have attained perfection. Few can avoid his attacks. It is not unreasonable for Yu Zhi to lose.”</p><p>“The third round is starting soon. Sansheng, can you please briefly comment on the match earlier?” Liu Chang chimed in, keeping a firm hold of the broadcast timing.</p><p>“The details were as I expected and I have nothing to add.” Chen Sansheng paused before continuing, “As for Lou Cheng, he managed to raise his combat effectiveness with powerful movements against Peng Leyun in November last year. He barely reached the level of Sixth Pin with many obvious shortcomings. But now he is a true Sixth Pin fighter in all senses of the word.”</p><p>“Oh, wait, no. Isn’t he still uncertified as a Sixth Pin fighter and still in an Eight Pin? A 20-year-old Eight Pin fighter is just so-so.” Liu Chang was actually sharing a popular joke in Weibo.</p><p>Chen Sansheng smiled good-humoredly. “Putting aside Peng Leyun and the rest, Lou Cheng’s power makes him truly deserving of the title ‘God’s Favored One.’ He is not merely a candidate!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Haha! I am getting embarrassed by all the compliments from the commentators. Modest! We should be modest.” Eternal Nightfall, also known as Yan Xiaoling, made a post with an overjoyed emoji.</p><p>“Exactly! I feel embarrassed on Lou Cheng’s behalf!” Wonton Seller sent a dancing emoji.</p><p>“I don’t want to say anything! Just one-versus-three! One-versus-three!” Brahman sent an emoji waving a flag.</p><p>…</p><p>“You girls only know how to fawn over Lou Cheng. Can’t you contribute something more substantial?” Unparalleled Dragon King sneered. “I say that fatty was unlucky to have met Lou Cheng. He might’ve won if his opponent was some Sixth Pin fighter without a supernatural ability or simplified physical invulnerability!”</p><p>“His fighting strategy was restricted and his teammates were too weak to support him. What could he have done?” Road to the Arena chimed in, shrugging his shoulders.</p><p>Flying Horse laughed. “I laughed so hard at that fatty’s tragic expression earlier! When he saw that Han Peipei had failed to cause any damage to Lou Cheng, he probably lost all hope.”</p><p>“Good thing the opponent was the fatty! If it was someone else, he would have been killed by this series of bursts with red blood and white fluid spouting out! Don’t get any twisted thoughts! I meant his brain!” Okamoto’s Fan made a joke.</p><p>With the defeat of the two leading players, Songcheng was practically guaranteed their victory. That certainty made the forum lively and everyone relaxed and happy.</p><p>…</p><p>In the seats for the Songcheng team, Yan Zheke changed her posture to sit in a graceful manner and took a secret glance at her cousin. She wanted to know what Lin Que thought of Cheng taking on all three fighters himself.</p><p>Lin Que was still wearing his thin jacket and an indifferent look on his face. He did not show even the slightest desire to fight.</p><p>He had zero motivation to bully a Professional Ninth Pin fighter or join this unimportant match.</p><p>He might as well wait for Cheng to fight the third player himself! Yan Zheke finally relaxed and turned her attention back to the arena. Li Mai and the rest already had their phones out and became part of the audience, ready to record the first victory for the Songcheng University Martial Arts Club in a National Competition after so many years!</p><p>On the arena, Yu Zhi barely managed to stand with his hands propping his body. His face was beaten black and blue, with blood gushing down his nose.</p><p>He nodded at Lou Cheng and then walked toward the stone steps, his fat quivering along with each of his steps. Though he seemed to be staggering, he took steady steps.</p><p>Lou Cheng looked at the fatty as he left and at the man-shaped pit. He could not help sucking in a breath, impressed by his opponent’s capacity to take beatings.</p><p>Even if this fatty was hit by a car someday, he would probably just turn around, dust himself off, and leave safe and sound.</p><p>If it was Lou Cheng, he would’ve definitely been badly injured if he used his flesh to take on the great force instead of using his strength to resist the attack!</p><p>Leaving the arena with slow steps, Yu Zhi looked down at the path. An inexplicable regret suddenly overcame him.</p><p>His four-year martial arts career in university was nearing its end…</p><p>After exchanging a look and a wry smile with Yu Zhi, Wu Yong finally unloaded his mental burden and went onto the arena step by step.</p><p>In his opinion, the only way to win was if a meteor suddenly crashed onto Songcheng and destroyed them. Otherwise, it was impossible!</p><p>So he decided to throw all his worries away and just enjoy fighting a Sixth Pin fighter of the Dan stage!</p><p>After stopping in front of Lou Cheng, he entered his stance. His gaze turned to his opponent.</p><p>Lou Cheng changed his center of gravity to his lower body and then extended his hand to invite Wu Yong to attack.</p><p>The referee did not make any delays and waved his hand.</p><p>“Begin!”</p><p>Crack, crack, crack. All the muscles and bones within Wu Yong’s body were roaring as if a sports car was accelerating.</p><p>In the withering wind, he flashed to Lou Cheng’s side with flexible footwork. His toes turned inward as he twisted his back and waist, wielding his arm like a whip.</p><p>Bang! Lou Cheng raised his arm to block the attack without moving his feet.</p><p>Taking this opportunity, Wu Yong kicked with his left foot. He was sure no one would notice in advance since his muscle movements had cloaked the scuffing noise.</p><p>Fatal Hidden Kick!</p><p>However, just as Wu Yong was beginning to gather strength in his leg, Lou Cheng’s kick had already landed on his foot to stop him.</p><p>Suppressing his disappointment, Wu Yong began pounding Lou Cheng from all directions while flashing around him with his marvelous footwork. But Lou Cheng was always able to block his attacks in time without moving. It was as if he was a master demonstrating to Wu Yong.</p><p>Wu Yong was about to take a step back to rest after a round of crazed attacks when Lou Cheng swung his right arm at Wu Yong’s fist.</p><p>He immediately withdrew his fist in panic, but Lou Cheng had caught Wu Yong’s wrist in an instant, pulling his opponent back at him.</p><p>Unable to withstand Lou Cheng’s great force, Wu Yong’s body began to be pulled forward. Lou Cheng took this opportunity to lower his shoulder and stretch his elbow against Wu Yong’s chest.</p><p>The referee secretly yawned before raising his arm.</p><p>“Third round, Lou Cheng wins!”</p><p>“Songcheng University Martial Arts Club wins this match!”</p><p>Not bad, not bad… Wu Yong breathed a sigh of relief upon hearing the referee’s voice. He felt that he had given his usual performance and did not bring shame to his team.</p><p>Of course, it was all thanks to Lou Cheng’s grace for not using Force Concentration and killer moves with his supernatural ability against him.</p><p>He straightened his body and his eyes suddenly became frozen. He realized a very painful fact.</p><p>Since the fight began, Lou Cheng had not moved his feet a single step!</p><p>Lou Cheng had beaten him just by standing still!</p><p>The audience burst out with enthusiastic cries.</p><p>“Three kills!”</p><p>“Three kills!”</p><p>“Three kills!”</p><p>The audience eventually changed their slogan under someone’s guidance. The cheering gradually became united, echoing in the stadium.</p><p>“God’s Favored One!”</p><p>“God’s Favored One!”</p><p>“God’s Favored One!”</p><p>Curving his lips, Lou Cheng waved his arm at the excited audience. He left the arena and returned to the seats for Songcheng. His eyes visibly met Yan Zheke’s.</p><p>“The rule says whoever pulls a one-versus-three has to treat the whole team to dinner!” Like a lightbulb, Cai Zongming cut into their eye contact.</p><p>He was feeling great in all aspects now that they were in the capital and his girlfriend was close to him.</p><p>“What rule? Why don’t I know about it?” Lou Cheng looked at him in confusion.</p><p>Little Ming smiled smugly. “A rule that our team committee adopted unanimously.”</p><p>“Where did the team committee come from?” Lou Cheng asked humorously.</p><p>“Just now!” Cai Zongming answered with a smirk.</p><p>“I will treat you all to skewers here then.” Lou Cheng had been planning to invite everyone to dinner to celebrate their first victory.</p><p>“Well.” Geezer Shi cut in their conversation. “Since you are not tired at all, I will replace your relaxing exercise tomorrow with coordination exercises. Don’t overdo the supper.”</p><p>The next match was Songcheng versus Mingdao!</p><p>Geezer Shi did not urge the members lacking basic knowledge of the formation to learn something related. He just made them do the coordination exercises in groups of two or three.</p><p>“Yes, Master!” Everyone agreed joyfully.</p><p>…</p><p>After the dinner, Yan Zheke spent a while flirting with Lou Cheng before retiring to her room to rest.</p><p>After telling her boyfriend good night through phone, she clicked on the martial arts forum of each portal site to see how people were praising Cheng.</p><p>As soon as the web page appeared, the relevant titles popped up to her.</p><p>“10 warm-up moves? So what? Lou Cheng defeated the whole Hudong team himself!”</p><p>“It’s the first one-versus-three in this competition! Lou Cheng kept fighting with skill and ease!”</p><p>“Thanks to him, the super-death team won’t die!”</p><p>“Remove the word ‘candidate’! He is the true God’s Favored Son!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
