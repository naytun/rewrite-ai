Hit him!”</p><p>He knew Lin Que would hear him at such a close distance no matter how he lowered his voice, so he was only joking around.</p><p>“What you said is just like asking a dog to bite others.” Lou Cheng looked at his friend contemptuously. “Why don’t you hit him yourself?”</p><p>“Me? If it’s me, I’ll be hit badly.” Cai Zongming showed his powerlessness.</p><p>“Haha! This reminds me of a joke about a hunter who tries to hunt a bear… ” Lou Cheng pursed his mouth to hold back his laughter and did not manage to finish his sentence.</p><p>Even so, Cai Zongming still completely understood what he meant for he had read many similar jokes. He also trembled and barely restrained his laughter. He cursed Lou Cheng, “Jackass.”</p><p>Just then, Ji Lan passed the stone stages and stood in front of Yan Zheke.</p><p>Looking at her, Yan Zheke wondered if she should surrender so senior brother Li Mao could have his chance to fight Ji Lan. It would help him get a closure.</p><p>Li Mao’s nervousness had caused his defeat in Ji Lan’s hands in December last year, resulting in Songcheng University Martial Arts Club failing to advance in the tournament.</p><p>After considering it for a moment, Yan Zheke turned down the idea. It was so obvious and ritualistic, showing no respect to Ji Lan and placing more pressure on Li Mao. It might even backfire.</p><p>She should just let it go… Yan Zheke sighed quietly and seized the precious remaining time to restore her body’s condition.</p><p>Even though the previous fight did not last long, she still expended a fair amount of energy with a powerful Professional Ninth Pin fighter. Especially during the process that she was trying her best to create opportunities, she had to remain in focus all the time. Once the fight ended, exhaustion was inevitable.</p><p>After she let out her breath in a long exhalation, the referee raised his right hand and made a loud announcement.</p><p>“Round two, start!”</p><p>When Ji Lan first gathered information about Songcheng University Martial Arts Club, she noticed Yan Zheke did not participate in the amateur Ranking Event in September. Thus she suspected that Yan Zheke might be stronger than an Amateur First Pin fighter and was going to achieve the level of Professional Ninth Pin in late October. But Yan Zheke did not apply for the position, making Ji Lan doubt her speculation. But it turned out that she really did achieve the level of Professional Ninth Pin and even defeated the leader, Gu Yue, in a violent head-to-head match.</p><p>Everyone in the Songcheng University Martial Arts Club were all monsters!</p><p>Changing her opinion, Ji Lan decided on her familiar skirmish fighting style. She slid next to Yan Zheke with agility, kicking her so strongly that a crack rang in the air.</p><p>Yan Zheke moved her right shoulder backward so she could confront Ji Lan face-to-face. She also whipped her leg into a kick that tore the air current and produced a sharp sound.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Once their legs collided together, Yan Zheke used the borrowed power to retrieve her right leg and punched Ji Lan’s abdomen at the same time.</p><p>Ji Lan also used the borrowed power from the collision to agilely move backward. Given that she knew how horrifying and powerful 24 Blizzard Strikes was, she chose not to give her opponent any opportunity to continue this attack. Once the momentum accumulated, the attacks would only become more and more ferocious.</p><p>Under this condition, Yan Zheke rushed forward silently to chase after her. While one retreated, the other chased, like they were dancing. The distance between them became closer.</p><p>Throughout this process, Ji Lan made changes in direction several times. Yet she was still not as agile as Yan Zheke who has mastered the ability to control the center of her gravity. Ji Lan saw that she had no way of escaping and would be hit by Yan Zheke.</p><p>She suddenly stopped, leaving Yan Zheke no time to stop and move a step closer to her. There was only an arm’s length distance between them.</p><p>Crack. Ji Lan lifted her right leg as fast as lightning to kick her opponent’s chin.</p><p>Her action, like the kicks in a dance performance, was to lift her leg to the shoulders. But had she not practiced her muscles to a great extent, she would hurt herself and would not stand there firmly as she exerted such fierce and rapid force in this kick.</p><p>She kicked all of a sudden, without any indication, just like an assassin attack. The situation has just changed. Cold sweat ran down her back as she realized in that moment that she had been careless.</p><p>In a split second, she chose to use her waist as a fulcrum point. She bent backward as fast as she could to avoid this ferocious kick.</p><p>At the same time, she raised her hands to block the following killer moves as per her practice.</p><p>Crack. The kick just barely passed before her eyes. She could even feel the roaring wind brought by the kick over her face.</p><p>Because her aim had lost its target, Ji Lan exerted force into her waist to pull her right leg down. She launched an aggressive Downward Axe Kick, targeting her opponent’s abdomen.</p><p>The Interlocking Kicks!</p><p>Half bending, Yan Zheke raised a hand to hold Ji Lan’s Achilles tendon just in time and pushed it aside with a clenched fist.</p><p>The moment two sides came into contact, Yan Zheke moved her lifted arm to unload the force in the kick. Combined with her fist, she barely managed to block the Downward Axe Kick.</p><p>While watching this scene, the students in the stand were relieved. But because Ji Lan has borrowed some power from Yan Zheke’s defense, she jumped into the air and kicked violently at Yan Zheke.</p><p>The triple kick!</p><p>Yan Zheke had no extra hand or leg to defend herself, so she was about to lose. She then bounced her waist and straightened her body with great power.</p><p>With the help of the bouncing power, she pushed Ji Lan away with her arms. With Ji Lan forced so far away, Yan Zheke successfully avoided her killing kick.</p><p>Ji Lan once again began the skirmish fighting style after failing with her triple kick. She moved and changed her positions constantly. She attacked her opponent with a low kick, sidekick, or back kick from time to time.</p><p>Yan Zheke also calmed down as she blocked Ji Lan’s attacks. But she maintained her attacking style, which was to take any opportunities to storm her enemy. This time she has become more careful.</p><p>During the chasing process, she once again set her target on her opponent. Relying on her flexibility, she gradually narrowed her distance from Ji Lan. This time, she would definitely catch her.</p><p>Clenching her teeth, Ji Lan jumped and abruptly kicked at her successively, quickly, and violently!</p><p>She had been waiting for her! Yan Zheke had seen recordings of Ji Lan’s matches and also had previous experience, so she was well prepared for her counterattack. Her spine suddenly bounced like a dragon bursting out of its shackles.</p><p>She pulled her muscles taut and forcibly changed her center of gravity, pulling herself to the other side to avoid Ji Lan’s flying double kick.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, she extended her hands to push Ji Lan, causing her to fall unsteadily.</p><p>Before Ji Lan could get on her feet firmly, Yan Zheke had already rushed in front of her. She kicked her right leg at Ji Lan’s abdomen and moved closer to her, causing Ji Lan to completely lose her center of gravity and close to falling over.</p><p>Yan Zheke grasped Ji Lan’s arm on time, pulling her back on her feet. She threw her right fist at Ji Lan’s temple.</p><p>“Round two, Yan Zheke wins!” the referee announced.</p><p>Though Yan Zheke withdrew her fist happily, she was wheezing. She was physically and spiritually, feeling like she was experiencing qi deficiency and was close to her limit.</p><p>She had been so focused during their fight earlier that she did not consider this issue. She was only concerned about winning against her opponent before completely exhausting herself!</p><p>Ji Lan glanced at her and sighed in dismay before turning around and leaving the arena. Fei Sanli touched his own bald head and stood up reluctantly. Both Gu Zhen and his father were humiliated because their Martial Arts Club might lose before even having the chance to fight Lou Cheng or Lin Que.</p><p>Yan Zheke wore a sweet smile and waved to the audience sitting on both sides of the stands. Without waiting for Fei Sanli to enter the arena, she took the initiative to leave, accompanied by cheers from the audience.</p><p>Walking forward to welcome her, Lou Cheng bumped fists with Yan Zheke and sincerely complimented her.</p><p>“You were awesome!”</p><p>Before, he was only expecting Ke to win against Gu Yue. But who knew she would defeat two of her opponents!</p><p>Yan Zheke laughed, her chin raised in a show of pride. “Do you feel like worshipping me?”</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled at her. “Yes, I worship you very much!”</p><p>He did not mind Shu Rui who was recording the game nearby. The journalist should already be aware of his love affair with Ke since a long time ago. After all, she almost saw both of them making out.</p><p>Li Mao had left his seat and walked towards them.</p><p>“Good luck!” Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke bumped fists with him.</p><p>Since Li Mao and Fei Sanli were both new players, they did not need to recover their stamina. The referee beckoned the staff to clear the ground.</p><p>Standing on the clean ground and watching the bold fighter not far away from him, Li Mao could not help recalling the match last year. Many emotions abruptly came to him.</p><p>He was too nervous back then and was full of regrets and pain. At that time, he really did not imagine he would make such big progress.</p><p>He was barely affected by tension in the match now! Even he had the potential to achieve the Professional Ninth Pin!</p><p>He closed his eyes, recalling Coach Shi’s comfort and guidance, Lou Cheng’s suggestion and encouragement, and the Special Training Team members’ understanding and support.</p><p>Thank you, everyone! Thank you!</p><p>After Lou Cheng helped an exhausted Yan Zheke find a seat in the host team stands, he looked up at the arena.</p><p>“What is he thinking of now?” Seeing that Li Mao had closed his eyes, Lou Cheng gossiped for fun.</p><p>Cai Zongming next to him took the initiative to answer, “Probably things like thanking the country, TV station, and Songcheng University.”</p><p>“Can you stop talking nonsense?” Lou Cheng glared at him.</p><p>“So you know it’s nonsense? We’re not mind readers! How could we know what he’s thinking of? Your question is inherently flawed!” Cai Zongming laughed.</p><p>After hearing their meaningless but funny conversation, Yan Zheke went closer to Lou Cheng and whispered in his ear.</p><p>“Do you think he can win?”</p><p>“There’s hope. Though Li Mao only began mastering the Internal Training Methods a month ago, he’s now in the level of powerful Amateur First Pin. Fei Sanli is close to the Profession Ninth Pin level, but he participated in the Ranking Event and fought intensively for several days. His condition isn’t tip-top. I’d say Li Mao has 40 percent chance of winning.”</p><p>“Sounds like you want our senior brother to lose.” Yan Zheke widened her eyes, chuckling.</p><p>Lou Cheng replied, “Hey. I can only fight if he loses.”</p><p>Yan Zheke pursed her mouth before looking at him with a big smile. “Do you think there’s meaning to bully someone who hasn’t even achieved the Professional Ninth Pin and has even experienced many intensive matches?”</p><p>After considering it, Lou Cheng covered his face and sighed.</p><p>“No, not at all… ”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
