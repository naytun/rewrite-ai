No wonder he advanced to Eighth-Pin and got the championship of Xing Province Youth Tournament within one year, making him a promising competitor for the God’s favored one!”</p><p>“No wonder, no wonder. Lou Cheng is also a disciple of a great sect! Then the loss Zhang Zhutong and Han Zhifei faced is justifiable!”</p><p>“Is that really the attitude you should have? There’s no rule saying that only disciples from great sects can be a genius. We should change it to geniuses will eventually join a great sect! Even if one of the sects was blind, they can’t all be blind!”</p><p>This comment came from Unparalleled Dragon King. Of course, the Dragon King in Lou Cheng’s fan forum was using his real name in Weibo — “Chen Qitao the Dragon King”.</p><p>Unparalleled Dragon King’s words made Ye Youting, who was going through the comments, feel ashamed of herself. Just now when she saw Shi Yuejian’s Weibo post, some thoughts suddenly flashed across her mind, which were similar to some of the comments.</p><p>“No wonder I was defeated by Lou Cheng at that time, no wonder he was always able to create miracles and overtake all his peers including me at a high speed. It was all because of his background as a disciple of Ice God Sect.” Ye Youting herself had just reached Dan stage and was recently accepted by Xuanwu School. She didn’t even have a physical-invulnerability master yet…</p><p>After Unparalleled Dragon King refuted her post, she felt tortured in spirit and broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>My thoughts and attitude just now were dangerous!</p><p>As a warrior, it was okay to accept her loss, but she must not make excuses to justify it!</p><p>Turning her gaze down, she continued to go through the comments.</p><p>“Wow, Lou Cheng is your junior brother? No wonder I had a good impression of him!”</p><p>“Your junior brother is excellent~ He has just won a championship, right?”</p><p>“Yeah. But Lou Cheng didn’t use Ice Sect movements, only the 24 Blizzard Strikes!”</p><p>“So Lou Cheng has been in Dan stage for four months? He must have learned some special Ice Sect movements as super-woman Shi’s junior brother. Wow, I’m looking forward to his competition with Peng Leyun and Ren Li!”</p><p>“Super-woman, super-woman, let your junior brother share with us his feelings when he was faced with such peerless acting. Was he confused?”</p><p>“Was he laughing like a fool?”</p><p>…</p><p>They didn’t know Lou Cheng was busy sharing his Senior Sister’s Weibo post with Yan Zheke. After the two of them finished enjoying the “liked” parts Lou Cheng was stunned because his ID, Lou Cheng 129, suddenly had more than 20,000 followers, and the number was still climbing!</p><p>“What good advertisement!” Yan Zheke said jokingly.</p><p>“Most of them were not my fans and just came to have fun… ” Lou Cheng replied, calmly and rationally as usual. He knew his real fans in the forum still didn’t amount to more than 10,000.</p><p>Though he thought this way, Lou Cheng was still excited and asked Yan Zheke in a low voice,</p><p>“Ke, is it time for me to make a post? What should I say?”</p><p>“Just be yourself and say anything you like~” Yan Zheke Said and gave him a smile.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m a fighter and fans are not my whole life, so I don’t need to devote myself to acting like a perfect model. Just do what I like!” Lou Cheng made up his mind and nodded seriously.</p><p>“What Coach Yan taught me is more useful than ten years of studying!”</p><p>“You liar! I have taught you hundreds and thousands of lessons but are you as smart as someone that lived hundreds and thousands of years?” Yan Zheke debated with him deliberately, giving out soft laughter.</p><p>“I don’t know how to answer you… ” Lou Cheng also burst out laughing. Then he forwarded his Senior Sister’s post and added some words.</p><p>“Thanks for Senior Sister’s acknowledgement …（laugh to tears）I was indeed confused and even believed that student Mu Yu was making a dangerous attack that would harm both of us, so I dared not act rashly. Finally, I understood that Mu Yu’s supernatural ability, Misfortune, had rebounded onto him.”</p><p>Several seconds after he made the post, a new comment appeared.</p><p>Clicking to expand it, Lou Cheng found this “Little Mouse in Hutong” only left two words.</p><p>“Like me!”</p><p>“The first commenter was usually regarded as a lucky one…” again refreshing the site, Lou Cheng found the forwards and comments under his post increased by a large amount.</p><p>“Eternal Nightfall,” said, “A big hug to my Lou Cheng! Let’s take a photo!”</p><p>“Brahman 001” said, “My idol, look at me, look at me! See my waving hands~?”</p><p>“My Hair’s Much Longer Now,” said, “I’m coming!”</p><p>“Unparalleled Dragon King” commented with a “smiling cat” emoji, “What should I say? A group of fans from the Longhu Club forum has arrived?”</p><p>Yan Zheke was greatly amused by them and helped Lou Cheng refresh the site frequently. There were many familiar names, as well as a lot of new IDs.</p><p>If she hadn’t noticed Yan Xiaoling in advance, everyone from Lou Cheng’s fan forum wouldn’t be in the first several sections of the comment area.</p><p>“I don’t want to hear your explanation, I’m always actor Mu Yu’s fan!”</p><p>“So it was because his supernatural ability rebounded… ”</p><p>“Bane, what a cool name!”</p><p>While Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke were going through the following comments, a popular ID forwarded his post.</p><p>Mo Jingting, who had hundreds of thousands of likes, said with a “flushing face” emoji,</p><p>“My excellent junior master~”</p><p>…</p><p>In a classroom on the fourth floor of the No.1 teaching building, Qiu Zhigao stretched himself after reviewing some lessons, preparing to do something to relax.</p><p>He clicked on the Weibo for Mo Jingting’s official fan club, looking forward to Tuesday’s vocal concert.</p><p>While browsing he saw a new comment, “Come on! Our sister just made a post, let’s go like and forward it!”</p><p>“What happened to my Jingting?” Old Qiu clicked the link with great interest.</p><p>“Her excellent junior master? Who?” Qiu Zhigao found out the ID that made the original post Mo Jingting forwarded was Lou Cheng 129.</p><p>“Haha, the same name as Cheng. Jingting’s excellent junior master is also called Lou Cheng. What a coincidence… ” Qiu Zhigao clicked on Lou Cheng 129’s homepage to see his self-introduction.</p><p>“The leading player of Songcheng University Martial Arts Club”</p><p>“The leading player of Songcheng University Martial Arts Club? The same as Cheng, wait… ” Qiu Zhigao froze when he saw those words.</p><p>Damn it, is this the Lou Cheng I know?</p><p>He, he’s Jingting’s junior master?</p><p>…</p><p>Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke also noticed Mo Jingting’s action, because his likes had increased to fifty thousand and was rapidly approaching one hundred thousand. Now he was famous.</p><p>“There are too many guys focusing on me, which is unreasonable at my age… ” He said with self-deprecating humor, not knowing whether to laugh or cry.</p><p>What does junior niece Mo mean by exposing her identity and background? It may not be good for her.</p><p>Besides, too much attention will be annoying.</p><p>Lou Cheng wasn’t prepared to be a real celebrity yet. He just wanted to compete for honors and awards, fight against tough opponents, and move on towards the peak of martial arts.</p><p>“You are complaining about something that other people dream of… ” Yan Zheke said and smiled, “Is it a kind of peace offering?”</p><p>“But I don’t like it.” Lou Cheng said and sighed.</p><p>“It’s enough for her. Well, for those who don’t know the inside information of Ice God Sect, this post will be enough to convince them that there is a good relationship between the two of you. As long as you keep advancing and growing stronger, her post won’t be in vain… ” Said Yan Zheke while rolling her eyes. After analyzing Mo Jingting’s intention, Yan Zheke continued, “Unless you post denying it, but I don’t think you are willing to do that… ”</p><p>At this moment, Lou Cheng’s mobile suddenly vibrated with the notification for a new message.</p><p>“Junior neice,” said, “Little junior master, I forwarded your post out of excitement, will it bring you trouble?’</p><p>“Well, she apologized after everything is done as usual…” Lou Cheng showed the message to coach Coach Yan and then replied after thinking for a while, “It indeed brought me some trouble, so don’t do it again.”</p><p>Seeing what he texted, Yan Zheke burst out laughing. Poking fun at him she said, “What a serious junior master you are~”</p><p>You are speaking like an old man~!</p><p>Mo Jingting soon replied, “junior master you are really nice and broad-minded~ I won’t do it again! I promise!”</p><p>“Of course you needn’t do it again since your goal was accomplished…” Complaining in his mind, Lou Cheng put down the cell phone and turned his focus back toward studying.</p><p>At this time, Yan Zheke bit her lower lip and suggested, “Ask her when would be a convenient time to meet, before or after the vocal concert? We should play the hospitable host here and invite her to dinner.”</p><p>“Usually it is hard for us to leave school, so we’ll just go to her vocal concert instead of treating her if time is limited,” said Lou Cheng. He actually wanted to ignore the vocal concert if it hadn’t provided him with an opportunity to go on a date with Zheke.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s words greatly satisfied Yan Zheke, who put on a smile and said, “I’ve just said you were like a responsible junior master, but now you want to ignore your junior niece because of a little trouble?”</p><p>“There are only a few people I want to do things for no matter the cost, and she is not one of them,” Lou Cheng replied with a smile, taking the opportunity to bare his heart.</p><p>“Tut-tut, has your skill in flattering advanced again?” Yan Zheke said, turning her head aside to hide her smile and glittering eyes.</p><p>“I’m speaking my mind. It’s not flattery,” Lou Cheng said shamelessly while texting Mo Jingting to ask when she was available to meet for dinner.</p><p>Mo Jingting replied immediately as if she kept the cell phone in hand.</p><p>“Thank you, junior master~ I know you can’t leave school during class time and you are going to my vocal concert this Tuesday, so I can’t always bother you. Is it okay if I come to your school tomorrow afternoon? Let’s have dinner in the cafeteria! It’s also a unique meal in Songcheng!”</p><p>“Cafeteria?” Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke exchanged a look because they had never expected Mo Jingting to be so considerate.</p><p>“Will she do something strange?” Lou Cheng frowned while whispering.</p><p>“No, unless she wants to force you to become hostile… ” Yan Zheke thought for a while and replied, “It’s likely that she wants to show her consideration after attaining her goal.”</p><p>Lou Cheng nodded and typed a reply to Mo Jingting, “The quality of our dining hall is lacking. I’m afraid you might get sick and miss your vocal concert.”</p><p>He wanted to order a meal in the school restaurant because it was more proper.</p><p>“junior master, I’m healthy and strong, as a Professional Ninth Pin fighter how can I get sick for eating something? Anyway, It’s up to you~” Mo Jingting said, in an attempt to make concessions.</p><p>Mo Jingting’s acting cute made Yan Zheke feel uncomfortable and regretful for being so polite and broad-minded. She should have Cheng ignore this junior niece completely!</p><p>On the other side, Lou Cheng replied to Mo Jingting dryly, “Okay, text me before you arrive.”</p><p>Putting down the cell phone, he exhaled, gave Yan Zheke a wry smile, and said,</p><p>“I felt sick when reading her words. It’s too disgusting but I don’t know why… Maybe it was the so-called acting cute deliberately and mischievously?”</p><p>Maybe it was because Mo Jingting was a calculating girl in his mind and acting cute didn’t suit her.</p><p>“Haha…” Yan Zheke burst out laughing, letting go of the unpleasantness.</p><p>Suddenly, Lou Cheng received two messages from Qiu Zhigao and Qin Mo.</p><p>“Cheng, I’m dropping to my knees in honor of you!”</p><p>“My brother, brother Cheng, I respect you as my brother! Please let me meet Mo Jingting!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
