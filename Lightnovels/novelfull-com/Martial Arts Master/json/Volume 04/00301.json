Hearing Lou Cheng’s request, Geezer Shi became happy.</p><p>“I know you can’t help yourself. Even before you have mastered the martial arts of the Dan stage, you want to awaken a new supernatural ability. Just do it. I’ll help you and be right by your side. Nothing will happen to you.”</p><p>“Hehe.” Lou Cheng simply laughed without further explanation.</p><p>After seeing his master’s power in the “snowy mountain”, Lou Cheng completely believed in his strength.</p><p>As for the problem of which supernatural ability he should improve first, he had already analyzed the advantages and disadvantages. He had made a decision.</p><p>“The Power of Frost!”</p><p>He chose it just because people always chose the lesser of two evils. Human beings are better at withstanding the cold than resisting the burning of a flame.</p><p><em>If I suppress the Jindan this time, something will come out other than a hot current and a cold wave. There may be some substantial changes to those things.</em></p><p>After Lou Cheng had thought about those things, he began to meditate to calm his mind and then walked toward the lake to prevent causing a fire.</p><p>First, he adjusted his fascia, his muscles, the five viscera, and six bowels to create the burning feeling brought about by the Prairie Fire Diagram, and to expand the Power of Blaze in his body, which was strong enough to change a “stream” into a “tide”.</p><p>Then by visualizing the beast-headed and human-bodied Zhu Rong, who stepped on the fire dragon, he imitated Zhu Rong commanding the flame and suppressing the tyrannical power and changed is body movements and spirit. This helped him control the blaze that was about to fly away.</p><p>“Bam! Bam! Bam!” He punched to the left and right and bombed the air in front of him constantly. His fists were powerful enough to blow up the red blaze, which looked like fireworks from a distance.</p><p>Geezer Shi stood by his side, holding a silver flagon. He leisurely enjoyed drinking the liquor brought to him by his own apprentice.</p><p>He did not know many fists he punched out, but he made the air increase to such a high temperature that it distorted the light and made the vicinity around him look like a vague, illusory dream. Until now, Lou Cheng had used his Power of Blaze to the limit and had consumed almost all of it.</p><p>He did not hesitate and continued to firmly repeat the previous process. He twisted his waist and swung his arms. While visualizing Zhu Rong, he threw a blast punch forward.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The airflow scattered, which affected the Jindan in Lou Cheng’s body. At first, it expanded to make its own nebula brighten to the fullest, and then it quickly retracted and shook out several layers of the “great sun”, making them turn into the Fire Meteor which followed the force and rushed outward.</p><p>Boom! The waves roared on the lake. A fire pillar suddenly rose up several meters high surrounded by a white gas, which produced a scene that looked imaginary.</p><p>“This…” Geezer Shi opened his mouth halfway and was so shocked that he even forgot to pour the alcohol into it.</p><p><em>Is this the performance of the supernatural ability of the Seventh or Eighth Pin?</em></p><p><em>Even the abilities in the Inhuman Level couldn’t create such a tremendous power!</em></p><p>The fire pillar quickly scattered and turned into a fire wave that covered the area of the lake near the shore, making it seem like the lake had put on a red robe. About five seconds later, everything returned to normal.</p><p>On the bridge, several students who were going to study in the teaching area rubbed their eyes and gave up the idea of calling the fireman because they suspected that they were hallucinating.</p><p>However, at that moment, the Jindan rotated in balance and flung out the extra ice crystals one by one to disintegrate into the coldness and released it to the host body.</p><p>Lou Cheng lost his consciousness directly. He could neither see nor hear anything.</p><p>Then the hot current poured in from the Baihui Acupoint on his head to protect his brain and his heart, and he slowly recovered from the frozen feeling. He then heard his heart beating violently and his blood running through his body like a rapidly flowing river. At that time, he experienced the “natural change”, which was like ice floating on a lake that melted gradually.</p><p>After a few seconds, his Qi and blood strengthened, which softened the coldness and also gave birth to the vitality that revived “everything”.</p><p>“Cold… Cold… It’s so cold.” With his teeth chattering, he was shivering because of the cold. He saw his master retract his left hand from his head.</p><p>Geezer Shi furrowed his white brows. “Fortunately, you did not try it by yourself… Wait until next month to try to awaken the Power of Blaze…”</p><p>Lou Cheng quivered and nodded. He totally agreed with his master’s opinion.</p><p><em>If my master hadn’t been at my side helping me, I would have probably suffered from severe frostbite and that would affect my organs. Even if I didn’t die from this, I would have still lost my health.</em></p><p><em>The boomerang of Jindan is several times more severe than I expected!</em></p><p><em>Fortunately, I didn’t flaunt my superiority this time!</em></p><p>It would be much safer to awaken the Power of Blaze if he waited until the body could adapt to the “frost” and improve its strength.</p><p>“If you awakened the supernatural ability for the third time, I guess that thing in your body would collapse by itself, so the damage would be very frightening. If you don’t have a strong physique that is physically invulnerable, never try it,” Geezer Shi reminded him. But he then smiled and said, “Do you want to drink a sip of alcohol to warm you up?”</p><p><em>Hey, haven’t you already decided to quit drinking?</em></p><p>“No, I have hot water.” Lou Cheng finally was able to talk.</p><p>“I know, your girlfriend has been waiting for you there the whole time.” After Geezer Shi made fun of him and put his bottle away, he then walked toward the long bridge with his hands clasped behind his back.</p><p><em>My apprentice’s awakening process of supernatural ability is a little weird… I still don’t know enough about this Cultivation, so I need to remind them to get me some information as soon as possible…</em></p><p>When he left, he coughed twice intentionally to remind the girl in the woods.</p><p>Yan Zheke blushed because he had poked fun at her. She walked toward Lou Cheng, carrying the down jacket and the thermos cup. While helping Lou Cheng put on his clothes, she asked with great concern,</p><p>“Are you okay?”</p><p>She knew that Lou Cheng would try to awaken the Power of Frost today. Although she knew that Coach Shi would guard him so nothing would happen to him, she still worried about him and could not calm down. She finally chose to make sufficient preparations and wait for him nearby.</p><p>“Fortunately, my master helped me by my side…” Lou Cheng did not directly speak of the danger that he had just encountered.</p><p>He took the thermos cup handed over by his girlfriend and could not wait to take a sip of water. He felt the warmth go down his throat and spread out, making him feel very comfortable.</p><p>“Hoo.” Yan Zheke was relieved and glanced at her boyfriend. “Why are you so eager to awaken that supernatural ability? Your speed of improving martial arts has not slowed down.”</p><p>Even though she had asked him, she seemed to have guessed Lou Cheng’s thoughts. He had chosen to awaken his supernatural ability because he wanted to catch up with Peng Leyun as soon as possible. However, if he waited until Peng Leyun achieved the Inhuman Level, it would be much more difficult for Lou Cheng to defeat him before he graduated from university.</p><p>“You should know why I’m so eager to awaken the supernatural ability,” Lou replied with a smile. He took it for granted and drank the hot water again.</p><p>Yan Zheke pursed her mouth and looked at him angrily. But then she began to smile and shifted the topic. “After this awakening, how much could your Power of Frost increase?”</p><p>“My physical ability has not recovered yet, so I don’t know. But I know even if I don’t use the method of Frost Force, I can still hurt people only with the supernatural ability, but the effect may not be so good.” Having completely recovered, Lou Cheng stretched his body.</p><p>Yan Zheke nodded and suddenly smiled. “Yan Xiaoling went to the Martial Arts Club.”</p><p>“What?” Lou Cheng had a dumb look on his face.</p><p>“She is ‘Eternal Nightfall’, the moderator of your forum. She has posted a live show about her visit to our Martial Arts Club,” Yan Zheke said while looking at her boyfriend with a smile.</p><p>Lou Cheng did not know why, but he was a little frightened by her smile. He said with a forced smile, “Idols should keep a distance from their fans. Otherwise, the fans will find all sorts of flaws in the idol, so the fans would at first stop loving the idol, and then hate the idol.”</p><p>“What are you talking about? I did not mention anything.” Yan Zheke blinked innocently, but the corners of her mouth curved slightly upward.</p><p>Lou Cheng quickly switched to a serious face. “I just expressed my own viewpoint and principles. Well, Zheke, do you want to participate in the Amateur Ranking Event held in the middle of this month?”</p><p>Yan Zheke did not stick to the previous topic. She looked up and shook her head. “No. Well, because you always praise me, now I have even become arrogant. I now think it’ll be easy for me to win the Ranking Event of Amateur First Pin and it won’t help me to practice my ability in actual battles, so I don’t want to participate in it. I plan to register for the Ranking Event of Professional Ninth Pin held at the end of October.”</p><p>“That could be rather difficult for you.” Lou Cheng told her the truth.</p><p>After Yan Zheke began to really understand the Internal Training Methods, her physical state improved rapidly. With the unique martial arts moves of her family, her overall strength had indeed exceeded a fighter of Amateur First Pin. But to get the certificate of Professional Ninth Pin was still hard for her. After a few months when she had basically mastered the Meteor force, she would have a higher possibility to win the certificate.</p><p>“I know, I never thought that I could get the certificate this time. I only want to fight with the experts so that I can practice and temper myself.” Yan Zheke spoke with her eyes bright in an excited tone.</p><p>She was enthusiastic about martial arts.</p><p>“Okay then. This month, you need to find some opportunities to fight and to beat two Amateur First Pin fighters. Otherwise, you can’t register for the ranking event.” Lou Cheng mended his clothes and drank up the hot water. He pulled the girl’s hand while walking toward the long bridge and, with his smile and his gait, he looked very carefree. “At that time, I’ll book the hotel and ensure all the logistics for you to participate in the Ranking Event of Professional Ninth Pin!”</p><p>Hearing those words, Yan Zheke could not help but recall the previous experience—the scene which was somewhat touching, somewhat warm, and also sexy. She subconsciously turned to look to the other side and took a sip, but she did not say anything.</p><p><em>I hope that stupid Cheng can hold in his desires and doesn’t influence my condition for the match.</em></p><p><em>As for the time after my match, well, it depends on his behavior…</em></p><p>Lou Cheng understood his girlfriend’s attitude, so he was so glad and full of expectations.</p><p>After the term began, they could stay together every day, but simultaneously, they lost the space in which they could be alone with each other. Lou Cheng respected his girlfriend, so he would not do anything that would cross the line. He was still looking forward to staying together with Yan Zheke because he already knew how great he felt when he made out with her.</p><p><em>Oh, you can’t have it both ways…</em></p><p>Following this topic, the moment she stepped on the long bridge, Yan Zheke asked Lou Cheng curiously, “Cheng, do you want to participate in the Ranking Event of Professional Seventh Pin at the end of October?”</p><p>That was the ranking event on a large scale and it was not held in Songcheng.</p><p>“Probably not.” Lou Cheng did not conceal his plans.</p><p>“Why?” Yan Zheke was quite surprised.</p><p>From her point of view, with Lou Cheng’s martial arts improvement rate and the practicing methods and martial arts of the Dan stage that he mastered, he could definitely advance by leaps and bounds during the two months before the end of October. Also, because his supernatural ability would be advanced to the second degree, he would have many possibilities to get the certificate of Seventh Pin, so he did not need to wait until April next year.</p><p>She believed in Lou Cheng very much.</p><p>“I want to give Peng Leyun a surprise,” Lou Cheng said as he exhaled and shared his real thoughts with her.</p><p><em>Once I participate in the Ranking Event held at the end of October and in early November, all my strengths and weaknesses will be exposed…</em></p><p><em>It’s no big deal. I can register for the Ranking Event of Professional Sixth Pin directly because my winning record is sufficient.</em></p><p><em>If I told others this plan instead of my fairy, would they definitely laugh at me and call me naive?</em></p><p>“To give Peng Leyun a surprise?” Yen Zheke again looked up at him. “Do you want to leave him in the shadow of failure in the district contest?”</p><p>“Yes, but I can’t do it on my own. I have to cooperate with your cousin.” Lou Cheng looked ahead and took off the jacket. Even though he was very weak and powerless, he still went steadily. “Peng Leyun will probably still be at the level of Profession Sixth Pin before the winter vacation. This is our chance.</p><p>“By that time, I also will have made progress in all aspects and I will achieve at least the level of the top Seventh Pin. What’s more, your cousin will not be too slow. I guess he’ll also achieve at least the Seventh Pin. So we can fight with him by using attrition warfare, which can help us defeat Peng Leyun who goes so smoothly after entering the university. In addition, we can suppress his will, affect his confidence to win, and delay his speed of breaking into the Inhuman Level by defeating him.</p><p>“Only in this way, we won’t be confronted with a monster who is strong enough to defeat everyone in the national match held in April next year and we will retain our hope!”</p><p>Hearing those words, Yan Zheke turned to look at Lou Cheng next to her. Looking at his profile and his firm and straight eyesight, she suddenly lost her mind. It took a few seconds for her to recover, and then she smiled.</p><p>“Didn’t you say that you don’t care about those topics about the favored fighter of the age?”</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed and answered honestly,</p><p>“Which fighter is not eager to win?”</p><p><em>I’m also a fighter!</em></p><p><em>I don’t care too much. I am not blindly arrogant. But it doesn’t mean I fight so hard to prove Peng Leyun’s talent!</em></p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
