On the arena, Lou Cheng shook his wrist and created two balls of silver light and fire respectively. The two balls instantly blocked the path of the He brothers in the air and on the ground.</p><p>Burning Ice and Flame!</p><p>Like an irritated cheetah, he tightened his leg muscles without any hesitation and turned himself sideways in a flash. He pounced on his opponent’s back with a deadly killer move.</p><p>Yan Zheke and Lin Hua kept very close together. They stepped forward slowly to face their opponents directly, with Lin Que, Li Mao, and Cai Zongming rushing up to them to attack the opponents from both sides.</p><p>Just then, the He brothers came to an abrupt stop and turned around to face Lou Cheng. The ball of silver light on the ground and the fireball floating in the air brushed past them, exploding into nothingness not far away and resulting in flames and fog!</p><p>Lou Cheng approached them just on time without slowing down. With a great kinetic energy propelling him, he straightened his back and waist. He withdrew his right arm and threw a Forward Punch at He Yifang, who was in the center of their formation.</p><p>Using his arm as a sword to fend Lou Cheng’s attack, He Yifang felt a flood of force much greater than his the moment he touched Lou Cheng’s fist. It forced him to take a step back with his body quivering.</p><p>He Yifang had already anticipated Lou Cheng’s action. He pulled on his shoulder with a sudden strength, drawing a semicircle with his sword-like arm. He changed his whipping and chopping motions to dragging and pulling, forcing Lou Cheng’s punch to land on himself to weaken its terrifying force.</p><p>Under their combined impact, He Yifang’s center of gravity swayed. His body was pulled forward and his feet were forced apart.</p><p>He Erlong and He Santai, who had been flanking him half a step behind, made their moves separately but simultaneously. One stabbed Lou Cheng’s waist with his right arm and the other stepped to whip between Lou Cheng’s legs, in perfect coordination with He Yifang’s movements.</p><p>Heaven and Secular World Sword Formation!</p><p>Lin Ye and Yan Zheke were not their targets. They had just made a feint eastward, while truly attacking westward!</p><p>Their true purpose was assaulting the leading player of the opposing team just as the match was beginning and the opponents were off guard!</p><p>In the face of the terrifying attacks from both sides, Lou Cheng took a quick breath to make his qi and blood flood back into his Dantian so his body would remain upright.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>With force emerging from his Dantian, Lou Cheng swiped at He Erlong’s right fist with his hand as if he was playing a pipa. An electric current coursing through his coccyx triggered his lower leg to kick at He Santai as he stood on the other leg like a golden rooster.</p><p>From the looks of it, it seemed that Lou Cheng had made this series of movements haphazardly. The truth was that he had made careful and calculated moves, clearly understanding what his opponents wanted to do.</p><p>Thud! Bang!</p><p>He Erlong’s fist was stained with five blood streaks. He Santai’s whipping leg was hurled away by the force of Lou Cheng’s kick.</p><p>Lou Cheng still took the upper hand when facing two opponents!</p><p>If Lou Cheng was their only opponent, the retreating He Yifang would have moved forward to attack Lou Cheng’s vital parts. He would make the most out of the constant rotating feature of their formation, something even a mighty Sixth Pin fighter of the Dan stage would have difficulty escaping from. However, Songcheng had a size advantage over them. Lin Que, Yan Zheke and Cai Zongming were closing in!</p><p>He Yifang naturally had no desire to be besieged right at the start of the match. He took several steps back, turning around. Taking note that Lou Cheng was preoccupied with his brothers, He Yifang focused his strength at his feet and dashed to the front of Yan Zheke and Lin Hua. He ferociously twisted his waist and back and threw his arm.</p><p>Smack!</p><p>His fist slammed onto Yan Zheke’s face like the point of a sword.</p><p>Yan Zheke did not panic. Following her daily training, she stood with her toes inward and raised her arm to block his fist.</p><p>Lin Hua did not make any defensive moves. She took a small step forward and made a Downward Cut with Fist!</p><p>Their modus operandi was having each take up defense and attack respectively when it came to facing just a single opponent.</p><p>He Yifang abruptly gave up on pumping strength into his feet and dashed behind Yan Zheke in an eerie grace. He not only tore through the girl’s defense, but also rendered Lin Hua’s attack useless.</p><p>Smack! With his center of gravity lowered, He Yifang punched Yan Zheke on the right side of her back.</p><p>He Yifang would’ve most definitely punched his opponent on the backbone had it been anyone else. But when it came to a beauty like Yan Zheke, he could not help restraining himself.</p><p>It was just like what someone had once said. Good looks were basically equal to the supernatural ability of charm!</p><p>On the other side, He Erlong, whose fist Lou Cheng had injured earlier, took the chance to dash away from Lou Cheng while he was in his golden rooster stance. He turned to pounce at the two girls without hesitation, throwing his left arm at Lin Hua, who was trying to help Yan Zheke.</p><p>He Santai jumped to turn around with his toes on the floor, dashing to Li Mao and Cai Zongming like the wind. Noticing his intention, Lin Que changed his direction halfway to rescue the girl. On the other side, Lou Cheng put down his leg to rush to his girlfriend.</p><p>It was another rotating pattern of the Heaven and Secular World Sword Formation, dividing the six Songcheng fighters into two groups!</p><p>Yan Zheke felt helpless knowing she was unable to defend herself. Just then, she recalled scenes that had left a deep impression on her, and those taught her to imitate her boyfriend’s reaction. She immediately bent down, taking the chance to lean to her side and whip her tightened leg backward as a Front Sweep!</p><p>Pang!</p><p>She blocked He Yifang’s arm with her foot just in time to save herself from his fatal attack. But her kick did not touch her opponent for she was much weaker compared to He Yifang, who had been in the Dan stage for a long time. If she borrowed his force to straighten herself, she would be instantly trapped in his upcoming string of killing movements.</p><p>An idea came to her. Instead of withdrawing her leg, she pulled the fascia in her leg taut to prevent it from bouncing. She stepped on He Yifang’s arm, using the rebound force to reach her approaching boyfriend.</p><p>Not wanting to give up his chance, He Yifang closed into the girl who had not steadied her feet yet.</p><p>Beside them, Lin Hua was barely able to hold on after taking He Erlong’s punch.</p><p>At this moment, Lou Cheng had grown massively as he had transformed into a giant. With his muscles bulging, he approached He Yifang and punched him with his tightened arm. A ball of light emerged from Lou Cheng’s hand, flying to He Erlong to save Lin Hua.</p><p>Instead of dodging or trying to protect himself, He Yifang tightened all his muscles, tendons, and vessels. He jumped a small step, fending Lou Cheng’s attack with his arm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The moment their arms collided, He Yifang was forced to take a few steps back to reduce the force pouring into him. On the other side, He Santai gave up trying to attack Li Mao and Cai Zongming and instead turned around to pounce on Lou Cheng’s back like an eagle. He was obviously trying to attack Lou Cheng from both sides with his brother. He Santai moved so quickly that Lin Que, Cai Zongming, and Li Mao were immediately left in his dust.</p><p>Another rotating pattern of the Heaven and Secular World Sword Formation, Rotating Cloud!</p><p>Yan Zheke had finally steadied herself and turned to knock into He Santai with her air-piercing arm. She wanted to replace her boyfriend to block the attack from behind.</p><p>But neither she nor Lou Cheng were telepathic. Unlike the He brothers, they were unable to cooperate perfectly. Lou Cheng’s momentary hesitation in the face of He Santai’s attack left a chance for He Yifang to take advantage of. He Yifang retreated several steps to get rid of Lou Cheng and dashed to where Li Mao and Cai Zongming were.</p><p>Simultaneously, He Erlong had also given up his pursuit and attack of Lin Hua. After dodging the Ice Burning, he pounced on the two other guys and attacked from both sides along with He Yifang.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He Santai blocked Yan Zheke’s elbow and took the chance to change his direction, dodging Lin Hua’s attack from behind. While drawing a semicircle with his flashing figure, he also rushed to Cai Zongming and Li Mao.</p><p>Cai Zongming had never felt frightened while standing in the arena, but when he saw that they were trapped in danger within seconds, he felt his heart doing a complete somersault. He immediately calmed himself down, visualizing an avalanche in his mind as he threw a blast punch at the quickly approaching He Yifang.</p><p>On the other side, Li Mao used his Brutal Blizzard and swiped at He Erlong with his tightened leg.</p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p>Hands chopping and legs kicking, it didn’t take much of He Yifang and He Erlong to fend off these attacks. Knowing that his brothers were safe, He Santai dashed across them without stopping and punched Cai Zongming and Li Mao on their faces with both fists.</p><p>One immediately retreated and the other desperately moved his head downwards. Their stances were immediately broken and they were about to be badly injured by the He brothers.</p><p>Luckily, Lin Que and Lou Cheng arrived on time. The brothers had no choice but to give up risking a continued attack on the poor guys. They split their formation once again, leaving the fighting center in different directions.</p><p>Smack, smack, smack! Bang, bang, bang! As the match continued, the He brothers dashed back and forth between Lou Cheng and his teammates as if they were practicing their stances. Sometimes they would march separately, sometimes they would make a joint attack. But they never stopped for more than several seconds, never letting their fighting desire get ahead of them. Lou Cheng and his team were forced to follow them without any time to catch their breaths.</p><p>In the studio, Chen Sansheng cheered for the He brothers’ performance. “The Heaven and Secular World Sword Formation! How unique and powerful!”</p><p>The core of a formation was not only defense but also moving separately to make a joint attack!</p><p>“Sansheng, can you please tell us why this is formation so great?” Liu Chang asked with a smile, knowing it would still take some time before this round came to an end.</p><p>Wearing the same smile, Chen Sansheng replied, “We can see that the He brothers may be outnumbered, but they have been on the offense from the start. That is because they have their footwork and the rotating pattern of their formation to give them an advantage.”</p><p>“Those who are interested can take this chance to observe their moving routes and the changes in distance between them. It is very interesting.”</p><p>“Considering the stamina of the four weaker Songcheng fighters, the He brothers will wear them out If they keep going at it like this. Never mind their other weaknesses. Very soon, it will be Mingdao who will have the advantage in numbers!”</p><p>“That sounds pretty neat, but Lou Cheng and his teammates don’t seem like they are using their full strength. He hasn’t even used his Nine Words Formula,” Liu Chang said as if he had recalled something.</p><p>Chen Sansheng made his analysis. “It might not work even if Lou Cheng uses the Formula. The He brothers have been keeping a perfect distance between one another. Lou Cheng could at most affect one of them. Not to mention, the brothers could always save each other in time. If Lou Cheng could use his Nine Words Formula continuously, he would have broken their formation with the Bin Formula, followed by the Xing Formula. He obviously isn’t capable of that.”</p><p>“That sounds reasonable!” Liu Chang sighed with emotion.</p><p>On the arena, Lou Cheng noticed Yan Zheke and Lin Hua had deliberately led the He brothers to a good position. He made an eye contact with Lin Que and raised both hands to draw ancient characters in the air while speaking loudly at He Yifang.</p><p>“Bing!”</p><p>He Yifang was stunned, feeling like he was surrounded by thousands upon thousands of soldiers and their horses.</p><p>He Erlong and He Santai rushed to save him without hesitation.</p><p>As long as He Yifang could pull himself through the two-second shock, the effect of the Bing Formula would be greatly weakened.</p><p>Just then, they once again heard the deep voice awaking some secret power.</p><p>“Xing!”</p><p>This time the voice did not come from Lou Cheng. It was Lin Que! It was the same Lin Que who they had all neglected!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
