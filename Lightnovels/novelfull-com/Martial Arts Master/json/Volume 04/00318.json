Lin Xiaozhi!”</p><p>The silence of the audience was broken by the scattered sound of trumpets, followed by a burst of thunderous cheers and shouts.</p><p>They knew Lin Xiaozhi could defeat Sun Jian, but no one thought it would so fast, like defeating a rookie. It seemed she had reached a new and more amazing level of strength.</p><p>What an exhilarating fight!</p><p>At the home team seating area, Jin Dali and several bench members stood up, swinging their towels with excitement.</p><p><em>“Holy cow! Why is it me? Why do such nice things always happen to me?”</em> thought Sun Jian in the ring with a wry smile, trying to cease the dizziness and gather his qi and blood by shaking his head.</p><p><em>“Luckily I’ve got a good attitude!”</em> He turned around without delay and met the battle-ready Lin Que halfway down the flight of stairs.</p><p>“She’s learned Tremor force!” whispered Sun Jian while reaching out his fist.</p><p>Lin Que nodded coldly and gave Sun Jian a fist bump as they passed each other.</p><p>Watching him come up in an awe-inspiring manner, Lin Xiaozhi exhaled and visualized pale clouds and a little breeze to calm herself down.</p><p>To confront Liu Que, her only strategy is to exhaust him. The more Dan stage explosions she could make him perform, the greater her victory.</p><p>She never hoped to defeat a Dan stage Professional Eighth Pin fighter. Especially one as aggressive and fierce as Lin Que and Lou Cheng. Even before they advanced, they were able to work together and barely knocked out Wei Shengtian, who didn’t have any special power.</p><p>With waves of screams and shouts echoing in his ears, Lin Que remained calm and introverted. When he reached his position next to the referee, Lin Xiaozhi suddenly felt overwhelmed as if he was a towering mountain or a surging river.</p><p>“Is this the pressure from Dan stage fighters?” She took a deep breath, trying to pull herself together.</p><p>“Cheng, how many bouts do you think Lin Que needs to score a victory?” asked Cai Zongming leisurely.</p><p>Lou Cheng glared at him and said gruffly, “You don’t have the moral integrity to gamble anyway.”</p><p>The number of bouts his brother-in-law needs to defeat the opponent completely depends on his strategy and how much strength he wants to save for the next round or even the third round.</p><p>“I have a feeling he’ll try to finish her quickly. Within three to five bouts.” Cai Zongming didn’t seem to care about Lou Cheng’s tone at all and continued with a sneer, “Don’t you think those Shannan University students’ martial arts style can be described with one line? The eye of an eagle, the speed of a leopard, and the strength of a bear!”</p><p>He noticed the confusion on Lou Cheng’s face and realized he didn’t understand.</p><p>“Haven’t you watched that cartoon?” sneered Cai Zongming.</p><p>Lou Cheng tilted his head as he turned to Yan Zheke. She looked just as puzzled, shaking her head to signal that she didn’t understand either.</p><p>“It must be a really old cartoon… ” She rolled her eyes and made a conclusion.</p><p>“Got it!” Lou Cheng nodded seriously and turned to Cai Zongming. “Uncle, please excuse us. We are too young for such an old cartoon.”</p><p>“Damn you!” said Little Ming, almost choking on his words.</p><p>Their relaxing attitude eased Li Mao and Wang Dali from Lin Xiaozhi’s new achievement in Tremor Force.</p><p>Right. What is so impressive about Tremor Force?</p><p>The two leading fighters in our club can both do it too!</p><p>The referee waved down his right hand and announced over the noises from the stands,</p><p>“Round Two. Fight!”</p><p>His voice was still sounding in the stadium when Lin Que suddenly inhaled and exhaled to perform a Dan stage explosion.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>The ground under his feet exploded, shooting countless shards out. His body seemed to be expanding as he threw himself at Lin Xiaozhi.</p><p>The distance between them disappeared in an instant. Lin Xiaozhi was still thinking when her opponent appeared in front of her face like a meteor falling from the sky or Mountain Taishan smashing down on her head.</p><p>So fast! So powerful! So direct! In a split second, she stayed calm and decided to draw her body backward. While swaying her hips, she took a few steps back.</p><p>She moved like an elegant antelope, which was steady and stable while blending with the heaviness of the elephant style.</p><p>Upon realizing that Lin Xiaozhi intended to evade his attack and keep her distance, Lin Que suddenly came to a stop and gathered his qi and strength before stamping down and charging towards Lin Xiaozhi.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The ground under Lin Xiaozhi’s feet split open as if a stream of energy was shooting out, raising her left leg and causing her to lose balance.</p><p>The 16th move of the Fighting Sect, Earth Cracking!</p><p><em>“This!”</em> Lin Xiaozhi was stunned and showed some panic while moving her spine up and down to stabilize her body. Lin Que seized this opportunity, taking one stride forward, he appeared in front of her face again. Next, Lin Que visualized a scene of meteors piercing the sky while swelling his temples and swinging his right arm to launch a thunderous punch.</p><p>Lin Xiaozhi responded in a rush with a blast punch, even though her body was still wobbling.</p><p>Bam! Lin Xiaozhi felt like her body was hit by a meteor when the shock waves from his punch arrived. Her blood and qi boiled, which gave her an intense feeling of vomiting, and her internal organs nearly jumped out of place.</p><p>A low but continuous rumble of explosions sounded from her stomach. Lin Que swung back his right hand and leaned the left half of his body while visualizing and preparing another punch.</p><p>Lin Xiaozhi had just relieved the vibration with her Internal Training Methods and had to deal with another strike immediately. She blocked her lower stomach with both hands, attempting to confront Lin Que’s Meteor Force with her Eagle Claws.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Her head was buzzing, her muscles and fascia shivering, and her entire body was freezing, so her five fingers failed to block Lin Que’s fist which stopped right by her stomach.</p><p>The referee stood still and shouted,</p><p>“Round two, Lin Que wins!”</p><p>In a flash, the fight was set. Students of the Shannan University opened their eyes wide, covered their mouth, or had a frozen expression on their face. The stadium fell into a dead silence.</p><p>Like the last round, they knew Lin Xiaozhi would very likely lose to Lin Que, but didn’t expect such a crisp and helpless defeat. Lin Xiaozhi, the top Professional Ninth Pin fighter, lost her shine from her previous victory over Sun Jian.</p><p>Lin Xiaozhi barely managed to recover with the Inner Training Method and hold back the urge to vomit. She took a look at Lin Que with fear before walking down the stairs, slowly recalling what had just happened.</p><p><em>Was I defeated?</em></p><p><em>“I lost, just like that?”</em></p><p>She considered herself at the same level with Lou Cheng back when he had defeated Wei Shengtian. She thought she could handle Lin Que’s two explosions in a row. She expected to make him perform Force Concentration three times. She planned to hang on there for more bouts to put down a solid foundation for Jin Dali. However, she lost in less than one minute!</p><p><em>Is this the talented Dan stage fighter with a long family tradition?</em></p><p><em>Is this the power of absolute strength?</em></p><p>At the foot of the stone stairs, she met the hippie looking Jin Dali and forced herself to cheer up.</p><p>“Jin, he just performed Double Explosion. It must be pretty tiring. Do your best and exhaust him as much as possible.”</p><p>“Yes!” Jin Dali put away his usual cynicism and hurried up into the ring to save time.</p><p>Lin Xiaozhi closed her eyes for a second and retched, walking back to the home team’s seating area with her shaking legs.</p><p>If Jin could completely exhaust Lin Que, the chief, in his best form, has a 50/50 chance of defeating Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Chief?” All of a sudden fear appeared in her eyes. Despite her awful health condition, she ran back to the ring and reached her hand out to the supervisor with a smile.</p><p>“Master, my things!”</p><p>“Don’t believe in these. They’re useless,” said the senior supervisor amiably.</p><p>Lin Xiaozhi winked and put on a grievous smile, then said, “Master, you don’t understand.”</p><p>At the visiting team’s seating area, Cai Zongming looked about, self-satisfied.</p><p>“As I said, Lin Que got it done quickly. Within three bouts!”</p><p>Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke whispered to each other sweetly, ignoring his words, delighted and relaxed.</p><p>Lin Que became so strong. We can set our mind at rest now.</p><p>At this moment, the audience finally recovered from the defeat and pulled themselves together to cheer for Jin Dali.</p><p>Inspired by rounds of cheers, Jin Dali shook his body and reached his best form.</p><p>Taking the last few seconds, he quickly deliberated his strategy.</p><p><em>Lin Que just dealt Sister Xiaozhi a bitter rout in a flash with two Explosions and one miraculous strike. His body must be pretty drained. I bet he will play it safe in this round. He will probably aim at defeating me with the lowest consumption of his physical strength so he can save more of himself to confront the chief.</em></p><p><em>In this case… I…</em></p><p>Before he could finish this scenario, the referee fairly raised his right hand after one glance at the heavily panting Lin Que.</p><p>“Round Three. Fight!”</p><p>Jin Dali instantly made up his mind to move swiftly with the Crane steps, taking the initiative to attack with the Huxing (tiger form tactic) and follow up with Eagle Claw and Alligator Bite. Suddenly, he saw Lin Que concentrating his strength and once again breaking out his Danqi.</p><p><em>Again?</em></p><p>Is he <em>not saving up at all?</em></p><p>Lin Que transformed into a heavy truck, galloping towards Jin Dali.</p><p>He moved at the speed of the wind, brewing some horrible strikes.</p><p>Because he had plenty of actual battle experience, Jin Dali instantly stretched his body like a giant bear instead of ducking like an antelope.</p><p>Jin Dali swelled his muscles and turned his body sideways, advancing forward to throw himself into Lin Que.</p><p>Giant Bear Hitting Tree Moves of the Bear Style!</p><p>Bam! Jin Dali in the giant bear form was knocked into the air. He stumbled and struggled to regain his balance rashly.</p><p>Lin Que’s next move was interrupted. His eyes shone abruptly as he performed another Force Concentration. No mercy!</p><p>Boom! Like a bullet fired out of a barrel, he reached Jin Dali in an instant.</p><p>His feet paused, forcing his body to a stop. Accompanied by loud friction sounds, he threw out his expanded right arm.</p><p>Move 127 of the Fighting Sect, Meteor Blast!</p><p>Roar! Jin Dali had barely stabilized his body when a brutal shock wave charged at him. It was so aggressive, like a bomb exploding, that he was almost blown away and his flesh felt like it was being torn.</p><p>With no time to think thoroughly, he leaned back and rolled on the ground to avoid his sharpness.</p><p><em>Lin Que has just performed his second Double Explosion. He’s got to be tired. He should need a moment to recover. This is my opportunity to get back in the game with the Carp Jumping Moves.</em></p><p>Lin Que’s eyes became darker and deeper, his qi, blood, strength, and spirit were all gathered together.</p><p>Triple Explosion!</p><p>“Triple explosion… ” Lou Cheng blurted out as his eyes lit up.</p><p>Boom! With this Danqi explosion, Lin Que slid forward, scratching a line on the ground, and reached Jin Dali before he could get up. His right low kick stopped at Jin Dali’s temple.</p><p>“Round Three, Lin Que wins!”</p><p>The referee’s announcement was received by the audience with silence. Mu Yu rose and took a deep breath, taking off a Taoist amulet from his neck.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
