Jiang Shuiyan and Huang Bing could not help but carefully size them up in an attempt to find the familiar figure. Unfortunately, they failed to do so, leaving only regret behind.</p><p>After recognizing Lou Cheng, they recalled details they had forgotten. Lou Cheng represented the Gushan Martial Arts School in the provincial Youth Tournament, and where they were currently at was precisely that school!</p><p>It was no wonder that they saw him here!</p><p>More often than not, fighters would only rewatch the footage of Lou Cheng’s matches. Except for those who became his fans, no one would read Apotheosis of Fighters again. The speed at which primates forgot insignificant details was incredibly alarming.</p><p>Of course, they would have noticed earlier had Xiushan just used the title “Gushan Martial Arts School” back when they were deciding their friendly matches. They would have at least associated the school with Lou Cheng. But they were only taken to the school after arriving in the urban area of the city. Some of their team members did not even see the school signboard. Those who did see it placed their focus on the upcoming matches and only blurted out, “Oh, Gushan Martial Arts School…”</p><p>Jiang Shuiyan was disappointed when Lou Cheng did not show up. When she looked around, she found Monk Wenguang poking and drawing on his smartphone with his forefinger. It seemed he was doing an incredibly difficult task.</p><p>For some reason, she thought a monk holding a modern technology product was a jarring sight. With a smile, she said, “Master, do you need help?”</p><p>When it came to teaching the elderly to use smartphones, she was second to none!</p><p>The moment Jiang Shuiyan turned her head, Monk Wenguang had already locked the screen of his smartphone with a finger. He laughed and said, “You are very considerate. I’m only writing an email. I’m good, thanks.”</p><p>Yo! So he knew how to send emails using his phone! Jiang Shuiyan laughed at this thought quietly, praising the monk in her mind.</p><p>“Master, you are really keeping up with the times.”</p><p>“Amitabha. If I do not enter hell, who will enter hell?” Monk Wenguang placed his palms together with a smile.</p><p>…</p><p>“Swordsman! Swordsman! Swordsman!”</p><p>Inside the Strength Training Gymnasium exclusive to disciples, a low, ancient sound reverberated constantly, as though a subtle, mysterious feeling proliferated the heavens and earth.</p><p>Lou Cheng was standing and his empty thermos cup was sitting behind him. His hands were wrapped around a ball composed of mercury. He allowed the ball to drop down gently, slowly coming to a rhythmic roll, as he used external pressure and subtle perceptions to facilitate the tempering of his body and spirit.</p><p>This was the “Swordsman” Formula created by Fei Dan, the Queen of Thought, and further developed by him. Parts of the tactic were also applicable in his Dan stage practice of the Ice Sect and the Fire Sect as well as the visualization of the Frozen River Diagram, the Cold and Frozen Diagram, the Prairie Fire Diagram, and the Zhu Rong Diagram.</p><p>As he continued his practice, the semi-enclosed Strength Training Gymnasium underwent a wonderful change. On one side, the temperature had risen with underlying heat. On the other side, the breeze was blowing and the surface of the metal instruments felt colder to the touch. The two conditions intertwined to form a vortex that slowly turned until they amazingly formed a balance.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Lou Cheng positioned himself in the Closing Form and ended his practice.</p><p>He put down the large ball and exhaled the air in his chest and abdomen. The heat and cold inside the Strength Training Gymnasium immediately fell out of balance and collided with each other. They actually transformed into a fleeting burst of breeze and shallow mist.</p><p>Lou Cheng bent over to pick up his towel and wiped the sweat from his face. He looked tired, but his body felt abnormally refreshed. He picked up the rest of his things and walked out of the room to find a place to exercise.</p><p>“Brother Lou Cheng!”</p><p>Just as he reached the stairs, he saw his cousin’s, Qi Yun Fei’s, boyfriend, Ding Yanbo, standing straight with his hands at his sides.</p><p>“Are you not resting in the afternoon?” Lou Cheng asked with a smile.</p><p>Suppressing his excitement and joy, Ding Yanbo answered, “We only practice in the morning.”</p><p>That was why he was waiting here!</p><p>“Feifei told me you received the Amateur Ninth Pin certification,” Lou Cheng mentioned casually, his hand in his pocket.</p><p>Ever since Qi Yunfei began studying in Xiushan No.1 Middle School, she was basically a husky that had broken away from its chain. She would return home once a month and spent the rest of her days either monkeying around with her friends or going on dates with her boyfriend.</p><p>Fortunately, her midterm result was a giant wake-up call and she began to take her studies seriously.</p><p>“Y-Yes. It hasn’t been that long,” Ding Yanbo replied cautiously, but his raised brows revealed his inner joy and satisfaction.</p><p>“Not bad. You have only dabbled in martial arts for six months and your body is not completely developed yet. You have done well to get an Amateur Ninth Pin rank. You have hopes to thrive in this field.” Lou Cheng was generous with his compliments.</p><p>“Feifei said you only took a month,” Ding Yanbo said curiously, grinning.</p><p>“Basically.” Lou Cheng had grown out the phase where he would show off to children. “Practice well. You will have your chance as long as you practice hard.”</p><p>He was implying that if Ding Yanbo could raise his standards and general physical fitness to the Amateur First Pin level, the results of his Internal Training Methods would not lie.</p><p>Since Ding Yanbo had heard Qin Rui mention something similar several times, he immediately understood what Lou Cheng meant.</p><p>“Yes! Brother Lou Cheng!”</p><p>Lou Cheng nodded without saying anything else. He found another place and first replied to Yan Zheke’s messages before beginning his practice. His formidable movements made sizzling and crackling noises.</p><p>Today, he focused on practicing Snow Cover and Cold Swallow, the 13th and 19th moves of the Ice Sect respectively. The moves were tricky and hid the user’s intentions well, with too many transformations unexplored. It was not a technique that he could forget about once he had learned the basics.</p><p>At 3 PM, Lou Cheng felt his energy draining and thus ended his practice. He showered and changed into clean clothes.</p><p>“I feel very productive after finishing my practice.” He sent a message to Yan Zheke with a snickering emoji.</p><p>Yan Zheke was still with her family and only replied a few minutes later with an emoji with sparkly eyes. “Our Cheng works so hard that I feel ashamed!”</p><p>“Hehe. It feels motivating to have a goal for you to catch up to.” He responded with an emoji flaunting his muscled arm. “Honestly, the desire to protect will always keep me motivated, but it is impossible for me to feel spirited and spurred into full action without anything going on.”</p><p>Of course, he felt steadier and lasting this way.</p><p>“Then should I give you a sense of crisis?” Yan Zheke replied with a snickering emoji. “To be honest, I’m distressed by how tired you feel. Work hard and defeat the big devil, Peng Leyun!”</p><p>“Of course!” Lou Cheng forwent any heroic statements and only laughed. “If you keep me company more often, I will have more rest.”</p><p>He visited his grandparents after leaving Gushan Martial Arts School before slowly returning home. He sprawled on his bed without caring how he looked and chatted with Yan Zheke as he read a novel. He felt relaxed as he cleared all his mental exhaustion.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside a temple at the foot of Xiushan late at night.</p><p>Monk Wenguang was turning his rosary with his eyes closed when he abruptly bounced to the door without moving his waist or body. He opened the door and looked at the two people outside.</p><p>“So fast?”</p><p>One of them was tall and imposing, with a reserved comportment. He carried a somewhat deterrent air and seemed as if he would inexplicably frighten away all snakes, pests, and rats if it was summer.</p><p>This large man laughed heartily. “Just so-so.”</p><p>“Donor Dong, please come in.” Monk Wenguang raised his palm.</p><p>Dong Shaoyang entered the room straightforwardly. Wenguang turned to look at the other man, respectfully saying, “Predecessor Sin Flame, please come in.”</p><p>The person had deep eye sockets, a straight nose, greying hair, and eyes that hid fiery passion. He seemed to be middle-aged. He was none other than the Divine Enchanter of Sin Flame!</p><p>The man nodded gently and entered without a word.</p><p>When Wenguang closed the door behind them, Dong Shaoyang paced a few steps before asking with great interest,</p><p>“Master, when will you make your move?”</p><p>“Namo Amitabha. Donor Dong, don’t be impatient,” Wenguang answered in surprise.</p><p>“I am feeling quite impatient.” Dong Shaoyang had a wide face and big eyes. He snickered and said, “I have been unsatisfied ever since he won the provincial Youth Tournament. I have been looking for a chance to fight him and see who is the number one among the young fighters in the Xing Province!”</p><p>“Unfortunately, I can’t take action without receiving orders. Now that an opportunity has presented itself, how can I be patient, Master?”</p><p>His face was mature, his manner heroic. He looked over 30, but from his words, it seemed like he was under 26 or perhaps even simply 22 years old!</p><p>“But we still have to wait for our chance.” Monk Wenguang tried to persuade him.</p><p>Just then, the silent Divine Enchanter of Sin Flame spoke in a low voice.</p><p>“Don’t disturb the locals.”</p><p>“Predecessor Sin Flame, I know, I know,” Dong Shaoyang replied with a smile. He turned to Wenguang and said, “Our target has only ever experienced a life-and-death fight once? That is too little! An arena fighter who has not seen much blood is innately far weaker!”</p><p>“That is why we requested you to come.” Wenguang put his hands together and smiled.</p><p>Dong Shaoyang burst into laughter.</p><p>“Great! Then I will show him what it means to tread between life and death!”</p><p>When it came to the contest for supremacy, no one was exempted!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
