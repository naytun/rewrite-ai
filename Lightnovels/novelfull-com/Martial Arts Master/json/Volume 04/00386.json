Now Huaihai had only one fighter remaining.</p><p>While laughing happily, she still felt a little worried. “My brother seemed to be in a hurry to defeat Piao Yuan, so will it affect him in the next round?”</p><p>“No. Piao Yuan is an Eighth-Pin fighter born with inhuman strength, and he was able to make five explosions within a short period. If he were lucky, he would have already gotten the certification of Seventh Pin. If Piao Yuan made up his mind to make the matches a war of attrition and fight like a coward, it would be very difficult for his opponents to find a chance to win. Piao Yuan even escaped with the help of the Dan-stage explosion, so there was nothing he wouldn’t do!” Lou Cheng took a sip of the Sedative and Brain-invigorating Fluid and then continued with a smile, “Your brother’s series of attacks are well-known to every fighter, so he had to use them as quickly as he could and destroy Piao Yuan directly without leaving him the chance to relax. Once Piao Yuan had escaped out of your brother’s attack range, they would have had another round of attrition and he would have suffered a lot.”</p><p>She recalled his first competition with the Wensheng Sect, in which Zhou Zhengquan was unwilling to expend much energy on her since he wanted to prepare for the next round against Lin Que. However, the more stingy he was with his energy, the more he suffered the loss of it, which finally stopped him from accomplishing his goal.</p><p>It was not advisable to hold too much back in Martial Arts Competitions!</p><p>“I know… I’m just worried about my brother’s condition after using up so much energy,” Yan Zheke said with a little concern.</p><p>Shaking the empty bottle, Lou Cheng felt better now, so he smiled and said in a relaxed manner,</p><p>“Your brother is a normal Seventh-Pin fighter now, who is able to make six, or even seven, explosions within a short time. He has also learned the Zhe Formula and many other types of special Kung Fu, which is enough to support another five of his explosions in the next round if needed. So he has actually controlled the use of his energy well.”</p><p>When he taught Ke his Zhe Formula, the girl asked in embarrassment if her brother could also learn it, for it might help him to break the limit of his energy as soon as possible and reach the real Seventh Pin. Lou Cheng promised without hesitation since Lin Que was not only his relative but also his teammate.</p><p>Even if Lou Cheng was able to defeat Peng Leyun within two years, he could not overthrow Shanbei University by himself!</p><p>With the Zhe Formula’s help, Lin Que succeeded in advancing by leaps and bounds, promoting himself from a weak Seventh Pin to a normal Seventh Pin within two months.</p><p>“Yeah… I almost forget that…” Yan Zheke’s facial expression read: “I’m just worrying too much about my brother, and you dare to have anything to say about it?”</p><p>“Haha.” Lou Cheng smiled, feeling an urge to rub Ke’s head. But he stopped himself in time since he did not want to ruin her hairstyle.</p><p>…</p><p>“Round Three, Lin Que wins!”</p><p>In the live broadcast, the guest presenter, Chen Sansheng, smiled.</p><p>“Though Songcheng University’s substitutes are weaker than the other four universities’, their second-leading fighter is tough enough, even tougher than any other team’s.”</p><p>“The four universities” referred to Shanbei, Capital, Huahai, and Guangnan, and their second-leading fighters were Fang Zhirong, Chen Diguo, Piao Yuan, and Li Xiaoyuan. Piao Yuan was nearly a Seventh Pin, and Li Xiaoyuan was the same as him, whose fighting style was more flexible. Fang Zhirong was stung to practice hard after being defeated by Lin Que and was now a weak Seventh-Pin fighter. As for Chen Diguo, who was going to graduate from school this year, he was a normal Seventh-Pin Mighty One with no special ancestral Kung Fu.</p><p>“The gods favored two are enough to conquer the world, we all know that,” Liu Chang said jokingly and then changed the topic to a serious one. “Piao Yuan was finally hit by the Meteor Force, which shocked him and triggered his inner injury. So he couldn’t dodge it in time, right?”</p><p>“Yes,” Chen Sansheng replied briefly.</p><p>Liu Chang was confused. “Why didn’t Lin Que use the Meteor Force at the beginning to create more opportunities for himself? Why did he have to make explosions?”</p><p>“He didn’t have a chance to use it at the beginning.” Chen Sansheng smiled. “Not to mention that the frequency that a Seventh-Pin fighter at the Dan Stage can use his force is also limited, except for some special force…</p><p>“When Lou Cheng hit Piao Yuan with his newly-mastered simplified movements of physical invulnerability, he was actually at the end of his rope and thus his attacks were not as powerful as before, which didn’t injure Piao Yuan very much. If he hadn’t forced Piao Yuan to make the Dan-stage explosion, Piao Yuan would have defused the shock easily with Force Concentration and immediately ran out of his attacking range. Yeah, while the others were blocking while fighting, Piao Yuan was blocking while escaping.”</p><p>He could not help complaining about Piao Yuan’s fighting style, even though he was just a commentator.</p><p>“Haha, I hadn’t expected that the fierce-looking Piao Yuan would fight in such a manner!” It took Liu Chang great effort to prevent the word “coward” from spouting out of his mouth. “He was not like this in previous matches…”</p><p>“That was because his previous opponents were all weaker than him, so he was fierce and aggressive.” Chen Sansheng smiled. “To put it in another way, he carried out his plan firmly.”</p><p>While they were chatting, Xing Jingjing stood up. Ann Chaoyang knew that she was afraid of touching others, so he just waved his arm instead of giving her five.</p><p>“Good luck!”</p><p>Xing Jingjing nodded slightly and then walked toward the stone steps quickly. When she was halfway there, she encountered Piao Yuan, who was spitting out blood with his spit!</p><p>“Are you badly injured?” Xing Jingjing asked unconsciously while keeping a distance from him.</p><p>“No.” The muscles in Piao Yuan’s face were twitching. “Lou Cheng’s Internal Explosion, well, Internal Explosion exactly plus Lin Que’s Meteor Force—they shocked my teeth to the point of bleeding. Go on, give him no chance to restore his vigor!”</p><p>“Okay.” Xing Jingjing moved round Piao Yuan and arrived in front of the stone steps.</p><p>At that moment, on the broadcasting screen, she suddenly appeared in the ring.</p><p>“Teleportation?” Liu Chang could not believe his eyes.</p><p>“No, she has just made the most of her illusion supernatural ability.” Chen Sansheng was interested in it. “Quite interesting…”</p><p>It seemed that he was even more skilled at creating illusions than Xing Jingjing!</p><p>While his opponent was getting herself prepared, Lin Que stood still silently. The rhythm of his breathing was even and there was not much sweat on his forehead.</p><p>The referee of this round was the competition supervisor of the previous matches. Now he was standing in the center of the ring, raising his right hand.</p><p>After pausing for several seconds, he waved his arm downward as Lin Que and Xing Jingjing caught each other’s eyes.</p><p>“Begin!” he announced.</p><p>While the referee’s voice was still echoing above the ring, Xing Jingjing pounced at Lin Que with a breaststroke kick. Though everyone knew that it might be an illusion, Lin Que could not ignore it since it might be a real attack without using her special supernatural ability.</p><p>Closing his eyes partly, Lin Que counted to two in his mind and then suddenly raised his arms to punch dozens of times in all directions with the help of his stretching fascia and swinging joints.</p><p>“Bang! Bang! Bang!”</p><p>In the explosive sounds, Lin Que’s attacks covered most parts of his surroundings as if he had more than two arms.</p><p>Eight-Arm Divine Punch, the 113th movement of the Fighting Sect.</p><p>It was derived from the first movement of the Fighting Sect, Meteor Shower!</p><p>The first nine movements of the Fighting Sect were all special Kung Fu of physical invulnerability, among which the ninth movement was the most powerful. As for the rest of the movements of the Fighting Sect, they were all derived from the movements of the Dan Stage and were led by the 10th movement, Doomed Death.</p><p>“Bang! Bang! Bang!”</p><p>The wide-ranging quick attack continued for a while before the audience heard a dull thud from mid-air as if Lin Que’s fist had hit something. At the same time, Xing Jingjing’s figure suddenly disappeared!</p><p>Less than one meter from Lin Que’s left side, the tall girl appeared again with her right arm raised to block Lin Que’s attack.</p><p>Once Xing Jingjing’s real location was confirmed, Lin Que put his right hand on his abdomen, gathered strength under his feet, and then turned sideways to rush at the girl like a shooting star.</p><p>The 35th movement of the Fighting Sect, Meteor Falling!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lin Que’s action created a gust of fierce wind and even shook the air. However, when he was about to collide with Xing Jingjing, the girl’s figure immediately disintegrated like an inverted reflection in the water!</p><p>At that moment, Lin Que’s right hand quickly slid down from his abdomen to grasp and to block the girl at the same time.</p><p>He had really touched Xing Jingjing just now and fought hand-to-hand with her, so he was sure that she was standing right there and that she could not make an efficient dodge in such a short time.</p><p>Now there was only one possibility!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A delicate pale fist appeared from nowhere, which was thrown toward Lin Que’s abdomen but was finally blocked by his right palm.</p><p>Since her location was exposed just now, Xing Jingjing immediately squatted while making an illusion to appear that she had not moved at all. With this series of actions, she dodged Lin Que’s “Meteor” punch, then she took the opportunity to throw her fist at Lin Que’s vital part!</p><p>In the various changes of Meteor Falling, it was an expected movement and had already been analyzed by the other fighters. Otherwise, Lin Que would not put his hand on his abdomen while using this movement in order to block the possible attacks from his opponent!</p><p>The top ancestral Kung Fu was always standing on the shoulders of all the martial arts masters from generation to generation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
