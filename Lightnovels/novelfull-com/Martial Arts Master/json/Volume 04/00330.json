At that time, he was like the monkey king, Sun Wukong, who was pressed beneath the Five Elements Mountain by Buddha. No matter how hard he tried, he just could not jump out of it.</p><p><em>While the priest climbs a post, the devil climbs 10. I can never win the mothers!</em></p><p><em>No matter how perfect my plan is, I never imagined that Ke’s mother would come to Songcheng directly to celebrate Ke’s birthday!</em></p><p>Hearing Ke’s response on the phone, Ji Mingyu seemed to find nothing weird and she continued to say with a smile, “Last year because your dad and I were busy working, we didn’t celebrate your birthday by your side. This time, we’ll make it up to you. We are in Songya Hotel now, you can just come here by taxi. Anyway, skip the class tonight. It’s only a class meeting, isn’t it? You can ask your counselor for a leave.”</p><p>“Okay, I know.” Yan Zheke agreed with her, feeling warm but depressed.</p><p>Songcheng University had a custom which was to fix the class on Sunday night as a class meeting. Certainly, on the curriculum, it had to be substituted for the other names such as “situation and policy”…</p><p>It was the only lesson in the preset schedule that students could not change.</p><p>Because both Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke had matches which were held on away grounds on Sunday from time to time, they usually came back very late. They directly asked the counselor for a long leave through the school management department. The long leave meant that they needed not take this class for a long time.</p><p>After hanging up the phone, Yan Zheke pursed her lips and looked at Lou Cheng with a complex expression. She opened her mouth several times, but at last, she still failed to say any words.</p><p>Lou Cheng exhaled a breath quietly and smiled again.</p><p>“Now I really want to ask you a question. How big the shadow of sadness in my heart is… Well, that’s okay. Actually, your official birthday is tomorrow. I will invite you to dinner tomorrow night!”</p><p>He tried to defuse Ke’s guilt with his self-deprecating humor, but his own loss and pity were not so easy to be eliminated.</p><p>It was her first birthday since they had begun their romantic relationship. But they could not hold hands to celebrate it together…</p><p>Furthermore, Lou Cheng also lost the excuse to persuade her to sleep outside with him…</p><p>Yen Zheke looked up and bit her cute teeth lightly. Suddenly, she turned around to avoid Lou Cheng’s eyesight and slightly lifted up her chin.</p><p>“You, you can also go to the hotel with me… ”</p><p><em>“What? To visit your parents now? Will that be too hasty?”</em> Lou Cheng was shocked by her words. At first he was startled, but after a few seconds, he quickly calmed down and stopped panicking.</p><p><em>I have made progress. I am able to guarantee Ke a stable future life. Now I can be confident to visit Empress Dowager and my father-in-law. I have nothing to be afraid of.</em></p><p><em>This is based on my ability, confidence, and faith in our loving relationship.</em></p><p><em>Ah, certainly it’ll be impolite for me to visit her parents without any gifts. I have to take the time to buy some gifts. What kind of gifts should a son-in-law bring when he first visits his parents-in-law?</em></p><p>Seeing Lou Cheng showing a surprising but thoughtful look, Yan Zheke definitely realized that he was planning for the future and was being concerned “too much”. So at that moment, she said in a hurry, “What are you thinking now! What I mean is that you can stay in Songya Hotel tonight. After my mom and dad fall asleep, I will come to your room and wait for my birthday to come together with you. Emm, if my mother came here by herself, she would certainly ask me to sleep with her. However, my dad also came here this time. They are too romantic and intimate to sleep separately… ”</p><p>“Like us.” Lou Cheng smiled and consented to her suggestion. He stopped thinking about visiting the parents-in-law but again he began to look forward to tonight.</p><p>Yan Zheke glanced at him fiercely and suddenly felt like she had made some mistakes.</p><p>She also saw the luggage carried by Lou Cheng and suddenly awakened, so she blurted out,</p><p>“You have hidden the birthday cake in your backpack, haven’t you?”</p><p>Just now, she was wondering why Cheng deliberately brought the big backpack with him today!</p><p>“More than a birthday cake.” Lou Cheng smiled and left her guessing.</p><p>With his current ability for controlling his power and body, even if he ran around with a small cake in his backpack, he was able to keep it from being damaged.</p><p>“You also bring me gifts?” Yan Zheke asked him curiously and delightfully.</p><p><em>I really want to know what it is now!</em></p><p>“Hey, you will know tonight.” Lou Cheng still kept it a secret, even while Ke kept asking him with her cute look.</p><p>…</p><p>Ke was finally united with her parents. They had a good dinner and a warm conversation. Her parents gave her surprising gifts. But all these things had nothing to do with Lou Cheng. He stayed in Room 1218 and was busy preparing for the surprise event. After he finished the preparations, he began to surf the internet and chat with Yan Zheke online. He patiently waited for her.</p><p>In Room 1902, Yan Zheke sat on the sofa and held Ji Mingyu’s arm while chatting with her parents casually. She told them something about her major. There was a half-eaten cake and some burned candles on the end of the table which was set in front of the sofa.</p><p>She checked the time on her phone and deliberately yawned, covering her mouth. “I have to get up early tomorrow to go back to school to participate in the special training… ”</p><p>“Oh, yes. It’s so late. You should take a bath quickly and go to bed now.” Yan Kai checked the time on his wristwatch and consciously understood what his daughter implied by saying this.</p><p>“Okay, then.” Yan Zheke nodded and asked them one more question for feeling a little guilty. “Dad, Mom, when do you go back home? I want to see you off.”</p><p>“On tomorrow morning’s plane. We are family, so why do we bother to send each other off? You should go back to school and study hard.” Holding Ji Mingyu’s hands, Yan Kai answered her generously and gently.</p><p>“Well, okay. I love you~” Yan Zheke let out a smile and behaved very cutely because she had a good mood.</p><p>Watching her entering the bathroom and hearing the sound of water, Yan Kai seemed to notice something. “Ke seemed to care about other things and she was occasionally absent-minded. Is it because this is the first time for her to ask for a leave for this reason?”</p><p>Ji Mingyu glanced at him with a funny look. <em>“Should I praise him for being so careful or should I ridicule his sluggish mind?”</em> She exhaled a breath and leisurely said, “Girls at this age will inevitably have a variety of thoughts.”</p><p>She gave her husband a hint.</p><p>Yan Kai gently nodded and sighed, “Imperceptibly, Ke has grown up and become a big girl. Oh, I always think she still is the little girl in my memory… In the future, while the future is not far away.”</p><p>Time flies. It had been 20 years since his daughter was born. As he had come to this age, he inevitably would have such a feeling.</p><p>“Yes, she has become a big girl… ” Ji Mingyu also sighed silently.</p><p>…</p><p>Turning off the lights and tumbling onto the bed, Yan Zheke tried her best to stop herself from falling asleep because she had already developed a living clock to sleep at that point. While chatting with Lou Cheng aimlessly, she also listened to the sound in the living room.</p><p>At 11:00, she heard that her parents had begun to take a bath. At 11:20, she heard that the door of the other bedroom was closed. She held onto the patience to wait until 11:40, then she changed her clothes and shoes and cautiously opened the door to go out with careful and light movements.</p><p>First, she closed the door of her own bedroom and put away the spare room card. She then walked toward the door silently and wrenched the doorknob more carefully than the moment when she was fighting in a Challenge Tournament. At last, she opened the door with a very faint sound.</p><p>After she walked out of the room, she closed the door without making any sound. At that moment, she was finally relieved, so she took out her phone and sent a message to Lou Cheng:</p><p>“Your sister is coming! Be ready to welcome me!”</p><p>Her footsteps became light. She seemed to jump into the elevator excitedly. She swept the room card to let the elevator take her down to the 12th floor. In the end, she found Room 18.</p><p>While stopping in front of the door, she inexplicably became nervous. She took a breath and knocked on the door lightly.</p><p>“Creak!” The door immediately opened like a magic show. Yan Zheke looked into the room subconsciously and found that the whole room was just in darkness with no light on.</p><p>But there were bright stars highlighted in the darkness as if the vast and fantastic sky in the prairies had been moved here.</p><p>The stars slowly moved to form various beautiful and meaningful constellations. While below Sagittarius, there was a cake surrounded by 19 candles which was placed on the bed. The candles flickered warmly and reflected the crimson characters on the white cream.</p><p>“Happy 19th birthday, my fairy.”</p><p>“These are so beautiful… ” Yan Zheke silently sighed and walked into the room. She was even moved to tears and tried to remember what she was seeing now.</p><p>At that moment, she heard a familiar male voice.</p><p>“Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you… ”</p><p>Lou Cheng closed the door and sang the birthday song while walking behind Yan Zheke. He then took out a silver clavicle necklace from his pocket. This necklace did not have a complicated design and only had around shining pearl on it, very simple and elegant.</p><p>“Let me help you put it on,” he whispered in her ear tenderly.</p><p>“OK.” Yan Zheke stood there quietly and looked at the beautiful scene in front of her. She seemed to lose herself in it.</p><p>Lou Cheng first circled the necklace around her neck, then he buckled it with his flexible fingers.</p><p>The length of this necklace fit just right. The pearl was set exactly in the middle of Yan Zheke’s two beautiful and delicate clavicles like a water droplet.</p><p>“Is this necklace beautiful?” Lou Cheng kissed the side of her neck.</p><p>All the gifts he prepared were selected based on his daily observations of what she liked and disliked, on her daily conversations, and on her voluntary sharing of information.</p><p>“Yes.” Yan Zheke answered him in a soft voice. There were many emotions in her heart and many words that she wanted to express. But the moment that she was about to speak, what she said became an inexplicable thing. “You, how can you put candles on the bed? Be careful, they might burn the bed!”</p><p>She only felt that she was about to cry and her face had blushed a little bit.</p><p>“You have forgotten that I am a walking refrigerator now?” Lou Cheng laughed in the girl’s ear and pulled her over to the bed. “Let’s wait for the coming of the new day so that you can make a wish.”</p><p>“OK.” It was the third time for Yan Zheke to answer like that tonight. She looked around, trying to find a topic which would not make her feel more excited and moved. “Does this clavicle necklace have any special meaning?”</p><p>Lou Cheng had prepared for this question, so he laughed. “A pearl means that it’s your first birthday since we fell in love. What’s more, it means that I will dedicate the first championship I won this year to you.”</p><p>“Hmm, if you gave me a clavicle necklace with one pearl on it for my first birthday, then when my second birthday comes, will you give me a necklace with two pearls on it? And in the future, do you plan to give me a pearl necklace?” Yan Zheke was a little shocked for she was touched by Lou Cheng’s words. She worried that she would cry out, so she subconsciously talked back to him in a cute way.</p><p>“Great idea!” Lou Cheng smiled and gave her a thumbs-up.</p><p>Yan Zheke touched the pearl and looked around. She asked,</p><p>“You even prepared some stage properties?”</p><p>“Yes, the Star Projector. I was stupid before. At first, I bought a normal one that cost hundreds of Yuan and the effect was as bad as the slide in our class, which can only cheat children. So I quickly bought this one. Although this is rather expensive, the effect is actually much more excellent.” Lou Cheng shared this story with her happily.</p><p>“When will you stop being stupid?” Yan Zheke lifted her chin, smiling beautifully.</p><p>Time went by. While they were chatting, the new day also came quickly. Lou Cheng looked at this girl, who looked more beautiful under the dim candlelight, and said tenderly,</p><p>“Honey, happy birthday.</p><p>“Make a wish now.”</p><p>“OK.” Yan Zheke knelt beside the cake and closed her eyes.</p><p>After a while, she opened her eyes and leaned over. She then exhaled a breath to blow out the candles, leaving only the Star Projector shimmering in the room.</p><p>“What kind of wish did you make?” Lou Cheng smiled.</p><p>Yan Zheke pursed her lips and chuckled. “I made three wishes. The first one is that all the people I love can be in good health and go well. The second one is that I can do well in my own martial arts and my study. The third one, the third one, I will not tell you ~ It won’t work if I told you!”</p><p>“Well, okay then. You can tell me after it worked.” Lou Cheng picked up the knife and began to divide the cake. He took a slice of cake and shared it with Yan Zheke.</p><p>At first, they were just eating, but later they began to kiss unconsciously, from a light kiss to a French kiss.</p><p>When Yan Zheke threw her head back and her lips became tender and delicate, Lou Cheng said in a low voice, “Ke, tonight, you shouldn’t go back to your room and wake your parents up. I will wake you up tomorrow morning before I do the morning exercise. I promise I will not do anything that you don’t like.”</p><p>Yan Zheke felt like she was living in a dream since she had walked into the room. She felt as if she were stepping on the clouds with a happy mood. Watching her boyfriend’s yearning eyes, her heart suddenly was softened by his eyesight, so she said, “Okay, I’ll stay. I believe you.”</p><p>After she finished her words, she was held tight by Lou Cheng again. They kissed so intensely.</p><p>Both of them took off their clothes and shoes. And Lou Cheng grasped the edge of the rest of the cake on the bed and threw it onto the roundtable. In the end, the cake fell on the table steadily.</p><p>Witnessed by the vast sky and shining stars, he kissed that girl from head to toe while Yan Zheke at that time bit her lips tightly because she had never experienced such a raging sensual desire. She sometimes grasped the sheet tightly and sometimes loosely for she did not want to let out a happy moan.</p><p>Watching this erogenous scene, Lou Cheng became a little impulsive to move to the next step because he has endured his desire for almost half a semester. But Yan Zheke did not forget her bottom line, so she stopped him and showed her attitude clearly.</p><p>Lou Cheng respected her will and kept his promises. He stopped from moving to the next step and went into the bathroom.</p><p>When he came out, the girl had already put on her underwear. She covered herself with the quilt and lay on her side with her face flushing and muttered, “You did not follow the steps!”</p><p>“What steps?” Lou Cheng was confused.</p><p><em>These are normal steps!</em></p><p>Wearing a red face, Yan Zheke laughed in a low voice and did not answer him.</p><p><em>No, Cheng did not follow the script. He did such sexual things not like what Dirty Tong told me!</em></p><p><em>He, he did not say anything, but just started!</em></p><p>After Yan Zheke took a bath again, she lay on the bed and shrank herself into Lou Cheng’s arms. At that moment, she completely trusted him.</p><p>Lou Cheng hugged her and lowered his head to give her a deep kiss that was not so hot nor so intense, but warm and gentle.</p><p>When their lips separated, they smiled at each other. They opened their mouths almost simultaneously.</p><p>“Good night.”</p><p>This was no longer a QQ message that they sent to each other online, but a truly beautiful sentence that happened in reality.</p><p>…</p><p>At half past five the next morning, Lou Cheng got up to begin his morning exercise. Again he understood the kind of eternal feeling which men usually had after they got married, that was, every morning became so warm and beautiful while seeing their lovers. He ran out of the hotel filled with energy.</p><p>However, Yan Zheke stayed in bed for a while. After she cleaned up, she quietly went back to the 19th floor and opened the door of the suite.</p><p>Just when she was going to slip into her own bedroom quietly, she suddenly saw a person sitting on the sofa. Empress Dowager wore a nightgown and sat there with her legs elegantly crossed!</p><p>Everything became black before her eyes, and Yan Zheke blurted out,</p><p>“Mom… ”</p><p>“Does Lou also stay here?” Although Ji Mingyu was asking her, her tone was very assured.</p><p>“Yes, but we, we did not do anything.” Yan Zheke answered her even before she asked more because Yan Zheke felt very guilty.</p><p>Ji Mingyu stared at her eyes for a while, finally feeling relieved, so she sighed.</p><p>“My daughter has grown up and has become a good girl… ”</p><p>She patted the sofa and said in a soft voice, “Come here and sit. Let mom tell you something.”</p><p>…</p><p>The match between the final eight came quickly. Because their opponent was not so powerful, Songcheng University Martial Arts Club still took the way to fight in turn. Sun Jian, Yan Zheke, and Lin Que cooperated with each other and defeated Yueyang University. On Saturday, December 14th, Lou Cheng’s club entered the semi-finals.</p><p>On Sunday afternoon, the teams which entered the semi-finals were settled. The Committee announced the battle team in the first round:</p><p>Sanjiang College vs. Haiyuan School;</p><p>Shanbei University vs. Songcheng University!</p><p>Coming events always cast their shadows before their arrival.</p><p>…</p><p>“Shanbei?” When Li Mao saw the battle team, he blurted that out in the office of the Martial Arts Club, forgetting that Shu Rui was still leading her team to shoot material here.</p><p>As long as they entered the semi-finals, they would certainly confront Shanbei. That was a fact that both Lou Cheng and he had known before. But they still had never expected to confront this team in the first round for it had won the last two National Championships!</p><p><em>Shouldn’t it be the same as in games, where people always fight according to their rank, from the weaker opponent to the stronger one? So we should at first fight with Haiyuan, and then confront Sanjiang. Only waiting for us to have accumulated great momentum, then we can challenge the ultimate BOSS?</em></p><p><em>How can we confront the Big Devil in the beginning?</em></p><p>Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke looked at each other for a while. Lou Cheng then glanced at Lin Que. He had a complicated mood, for he felt not only excited but also nervous.</p><p>That was because their first match was with Shanbei, which meant that it not only involved the result of this match but also involved the influence that the result would have on their following matches!</p><p>If their fighting momentum was disrupted, it would result in a low morale. Maybe they would also lose in the following two matches!</p><p>…</p><p>“Shanbei… ” In Sanjiang College, Qu Hui took off his top hat and studied the western gentleman, making a slight bow toward the computer screen with a smile.</p><p><em>What a perfect draw!</em></p><p><em>If the first match for Songcheng University is with Shanbei, they will certainly lose all their energy in the first round and gradually become exhausted. It obviously is beneficial for our Martial Arts Club!</em></p><p>Except for him, the other present members of Sanjiang Martial Arts Club were also happy and excited.</p><p>…</p><p>“Shanbei!” Sitting in front of her desk in the dormitory, Yan Xiaoling almost jumped up and quickly updated a post in the forum to help her relieve the pressure:</p><p>“@Unparalleled Dragon King, what should we do? Lou Cheng’s club has to fight Shanbei in the first round!”</p><p>“Unparalleled Dragon King” sent a “funny” emoji and said, “What to do? They certainly will not give up! Huh, this should be a wonderful match!”</p><p>“A reign of terror and fierce long knives seem to come into my eyes.” “Okamoto’s Fan”, who always pretended to be an old hand at sex, used some literary words. But he then also added, “If Songcheng University wins this match, I will share all of my porn collection with you.”</p><p>“Then you will at least be detained!” “Bull Demon King” responded to this poser.</p><p>While “Brahman” screamed excitedly, “Oh my god, I really want to watch the match at the scene! Little Changye, you must watch the show as carefully as you can to make up for me!”</p><p>“May I ask a question? What should I bring to the away ground to cheer for Lou Cheng? Banners? Big photos?” Yan Xiaoling stopped being frightened and gradually became excited, which mixed with worry.</p><p>“You don’t need to take anything. Remember this sentence: ‘Take care of yourself, in case other students beat you’!” “Unparalleled Dragon King” poked fun at her.</p><p>…</p><p>As the people were having a hot debate in Lou Cheng’s fan forum, the battle table also became one of the most discussed topics on Weibo.</p><p>Since it was a match between several Heavenly sons of the age, it was normal for this match to attract so much attention.</p><p>Or, to be more specific, ever since He Xiaowei, the famous commentator, selected out who the four Heavenly sons of this age were, many people started to look forward to this match.</p><p>National University Martial Arts Competitions, the official Weibo account, also took the initiative to update some pre-match predictions and wrote a long and detailed Weibo with a short but striking topic, as followed:</p><p>“This is the most eye-catching match among all divisions. This is a match between heavenly sons! Will Peng Leyun, who is an established fighter, win the match? Or Lou Cheng and Lin Que, who are still fresh, now trying their best to beat this powerful tiger down?</p><p>“3:00 pm, December 21st. Let’s meet at the Flying Bird Stadium of Shanbei University!</p><p>“Here’s the newest introduction to the leading players and the main bench fighters of these two teams.</p><p>“It’s said that Peng Leyun has achieved the Professional Sixth Pin during the summer vacation. With more than four months of hard work, with his great pace of progress, and with his daily performance, we absolutely can look forward to his current strength—whether he is a strong fighter of the Professional Sixth Pin, a top fighter of the Sixth Pin, or has he even already crossed the threshold of the Inhuman stage?</p><p>“As for Xu Wannian, his Corvine Mouth has improved a lot. But he seems to indulge in practicing his supernatural abilities, so his martial arts doesn’t make any progress. He is still a top fighter of the Professional Ninth Pin and fails to step over the threshold of the Dan stage. This time, his opponent, Lou Cheng, seems to be able to restrain his abilities, which is not good news for him. So we’ll see whether his Corvine Mouth is much more powerful or he will be terribly hurt by the fierce boomerang.</p><p>“As for Fang Zhirong, he at first attended a martial arts school and participated in Haiyuan where he also got cultivation. But then he chose to enter Shanbei and he was in the same grade as Lin Que. He was more famous than Lin Que before and he also entered the Dan stage as early as he did. He succeeded in mastering the Dan stage in August. As we know, because the fighters had contact with different people and practiced different Kung Fu, they will go through a period during which their martial arts would advance by leaps and bounds after they achieved a new level. So, four months have gone by, which level has Fang Zhirong achieved now?</p><p>“In addition, back when Fang Zhirong was studying in Haiyuan, he mainly practiced the Kung Fu derived from the Dark Sect and mastered Kung Fu related to the Plague Sect and the Magnetism Sect as his assistant movements. He was so arrogant and stubborn, so people usually called him ‘Bad Boy’. However, after he entered Shanbei, he became much gentler under Peng Leyun’s threat.</p><p>“Mao Chengjun, who is in the same grade as Peng Leyun, is one of the bench fighters and became a top fighter of Professional Ninth Pin in his Martial Arts Club.</p><p>“Bernhard, a freshman from Northern Europe, has his own supernatural ability and is good at making air explosions, so his nickname is ‘Nobel’. But because he is still weaker than the fighters of the Professional Ninth Pin, he is unable to become a leading player for now.</p><p>…</p><p>“Then let’s talk about Lou Cheng. He is the most talented disciple of the Ice God Sect in this age. In August, even when he just entered the Dan stage, he showed his strength, which was as powerful as the fighters of the Professional Seventh Pin. Now four months have passed, and he hasn’t presented his ability in public. Like what we said about Fang Zhirong, Lou Cheng is also in the period during which he will advance by leaps and bounds. So what kind of surprise he will bring to us? What kind of magic will this magical boy create for us again?</p><p>“Lin Que, the freshest direct descendant of Shushan Study, mastered the Dan stage in June. Now six months have passed, we don’t know how many movements in the Fighting Sect have already been mastered by him. However, in the previous matches, it’s said that he had astonishing performance after he showed a little of his current strength. So let’s look forward to Lin Que, the boy who is still in the period during which fighters can advance by leaps and bounds!</p><p>“As for Yan Zheke, we shouldn’t only focus on her beautiful looks but we also should know about her great improvements in martial arts. Within one year, she has grown up from a normal person with no rank to a fighter of the Professional Ninth Pin. Certainly, she is different from Lou Cheng. Because one year ago, she actually was as strong as a fighter of the Amateur Sixth or Seventh Pin, but she never attended any Ranking Events. No matter what, she has made an astonishing improvement to advance to the Professional Ninth Pin. She is the leading bench fighter.</p><p>“Li Mao, who improved from the normal Amateur Third Pin to the Professional Ninth Pin in one year, is a fighter that most people can imitate.</p><p>“As for Cai Zongming, it is said he at first was a fighter of the Amateur Fifth Pin, but he achieved the top Amateur First Pin in only six months.</p><p>“Sun Jian, the old qualified member of their Martial Arts Club. He is a fighter of the top Amateur First Pin.</p><p>“Lin Hua, she is expected to achieve the Amateur First Pin this month.</p><p>…</p><p>“Okay, now we have finished the introductions. Let us interview a few leading players about their views on this match: @Peng Leyun of Shang Qing, @The iron mouth has been broken for million years, @Fang Zhirong 001, @Lou Cheng 129. As for Lin Que, I think he possibly doesn’t have a Weibo Account… ”</p><p>In the classroom, Lou Cheng also saw this Weibo because a lot of people had transmitted it and addressed him. He suddenly had many thoughts moving up and down in his heart, and at that moment, he did not know how to reply to those comments, with what kind of attitude or tone.</p><p>At that moment, he saw that “Peng Leyun of Shang Qing” had updated a Weibo:</p><p>“I am looking forward to fighting with Lou Cheng and Lin Que.”</p><p>This actually was a normal and polite sentence. But after different people interpreted it, it had completely different meanings.</p><p>“Does Le mean that Lou Cheng or Lin Que cannot defeat him on their own?”</p><p>“Does he mean that he is looking forward to fighting an attrition warfare with both Lou Cheng and Lin Que?”</p><p>“He is so confident!”</p><p>After a while, “The iron mouth has been broken for million years” showed his attitude:</p><p>“Songcheng University is powerful. Also, we very much admire the great progress of Lou Cheng and Lin Que. But what I want to say is that the ultimate victory belongs to us!”</p><p>“Fang Zhirong 001,” said concisely, “We are waiting for them!”</p><p>Lou Cheng held his phone and hesitated to reply to them because he had already felt the strong momentum and confidence held by his opponents in Shanbei who were the National Champions.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Just after Yan Zheke had learned a tough point, she was aware of the abnormal behavior of her boyfriend.</p><p>Lou Cheng handed her the phone and showed her the Weibo that he read. He told her the whole story in a low voice.</p><p>“You do not know how to reply these comments?” Yan Zheke looked at Lou Cheng with concern and asked him straight to the point.</p><p>Lou Cheng nodded and sighed. “I really want to win. But I clearly know that we only have a small possibility to win the match. If I behave very confidently and show a firm attitude for winning the game, after the match the result may make me lose face. But to yield in the beginning of the match isn’t my style. I just can’t!”</p><p>Yan Zheke looked up and pursed her lips slightly while thinking. The corners of her mouth lifted.</p><p>“Cheng, I thought of a sentence that I read several days ago. It’s a little vulgar but is still reasonable, which is also suitable for your current situation.”</p><p>“Which sentence?” Lou Cheng asked curiously.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s smile was as beautiful as fresh flowers. She whispered quickly,</p><p><em>“Careless about life and death, fight if you don’t want to say uncle!</em></p><p>“Now you can change this sentence. For example, care less about victory and failure, fight if you don’t want to say uncle!”</p><p>“Careless about life and death, fight if you don’t want to say uncle! Careless about victory and failure, fight if you don’t want to say uncle!” Lou Cheng repeated her words again in his heart and just felt that his blood was burning. He already knew how to reply to those comments.</p><p>He considered his tone and did not use blunt words. After all, people had to be polite in public talks.</p><p>He typed the sentence quickly on his phone and read it again before he updated it.</p><p>“As a fighter, you can lose the game, but never yield!</p><p>“Now since you never admit defeat, let’s fight!”</p><p><em>Let’s fight!</em></p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
