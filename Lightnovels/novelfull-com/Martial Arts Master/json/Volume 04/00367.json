He walked into the high-speed rail station of Xiushan.</p><p>Wu Qingui sent the 700,000 yuan endorsement payment to him yesterday and also planned to send him the martial arts shoes, which were specially designed for him, in March so that Lou Cheng could try them before the designers made the final adjustments.</p><p>The moment Lou Cheng received the endorsement payment, he went to the bank and transferred 150,000 Yuan to his mother for renovations without telling her. His mother was shocked and she thought that something had gone wrong with the banking system because she suddenly received such a large amount of money; she even almost called the police. After Lou Cheng told her on the phone, she understood the whole thing, so she scolded her son a little bit with joy and surprise. She no longer pretended to refuse the money but spread Lou Cheng’s filial actions on to the whole estate. Once again, he became a real “good boy” in others’ eyes. All of the young men in this estate had no way to get rid of Lou Cheng’s great influence.</p><p>“Hey, what a coincidence ~!” In front of the ticket gate, Yan Zheke pretended to meet Lou Cheng by chance and patted his shoulder with a sweet smile while dragging her luggage.</p><p>“What a coincidence! You’re also going to Songcheng!” Lou Cheng acted exaggeratedly while smoothly taking the luggage from the girl’s hand, then he grabbed her waist.</p><p>“Your acting skills are poor!” Yan Zheke looked up and commented to him.</p><p>Without the need to worry about the existence of parents, these two people were like two wild horses, feeling free and happy.</p><p>After having their tickets checked, they got on the high-speed train. Lou Cheng put the baggage on the baggage holder above and then sat next to the girl. He then asked her casually,</p><p>“How is your practice of Attainment Formula and Swordsman Formula going?”</p><p>He had asked his master on the phone and had gotten his permission to exchange the Attainment Formula with the Swordsman Formula. Geezer Shi also suggested that it did not matter at all to teach “Lou Cheng’s wife” more… By this way, he could pay those men back, for they had asked Lou Cheng to suffer an ordeal without telling him first.</p><p>“I have a little bit of feeling for it now.” Yan Zheke looked at Lou Cheng and asked jokingly, “Are you trying to get a sense of superiority from deprecating me? To show off the fact that you have mastered the formula in only one day?”</p><p>She had not told her grandfather and grandmother about the Attainment Formula yet because she planned to tell them before the National Games for fear that this turn of events would scare them.</p><p>Some people really were amazing and could not be regarded as normal people!</p><p>At the same time, she also looked forward to one thing, which was that her cousin could also learn the Attainment Formula, because it was Cheng’s compensation to Shushan Study. So if he mixed the speed of Meteor Blast with the Attainment Formula, what kind of changes would happen?</p><p>“No, I’m not showing off. Coach Yan, I’m just showing my concern for you. I’ll never show off in front of you!” Lou Cheng replied to her with a smile.</p><p>It was at that moment that Yan Zheke let out a “Hmph”, looked sideways, and said with emotion,</p><p>“The National Games will be held this semester. I’m looking forward to it, but I also feel so nervous…”</p><p>“So do I. But I am looking forward to tonight. It’s Valentine’s Day and it’s our first anniversary. Oh, what gift will you give to me?” Lou Cheng laughed.</p><p>In fact, Songcheng University would officially open on Monday, February 17th. But both of them had lied about this in order to celebrate Valentine’s Day and their first anniversary together. So they went back to Songcheng in advance.</p><p>Of course, it should not be regarded as a lie. Preparing for the upcoming National Games in the school was a fair excuse!</p><p>“I didn’t prepare a gift for you!” Yan Zheke glanced at Lou Cheng, but suddenly she laughed. “Could my period be seen as a gift? Cheng, I think that you have predestination with my menstruation. I’m always menstruating whenever we go out.”</p><p>“I have nothing to do with this. Last month, you had your period on the 17th. And because its cycle is 26 days and there are 31 days in January, your menstruation will definitely be around today.” Lou Cheng threw up his hand helplessly and looked forward to the future. “Next year, you won’t have your period.”</p><p>“So what?!” Yan Zheke puffed out her cheeks and moved her body closer to lean on Lou Cheng. She gave one of her earphones to him and invited him to listen to songs and surf the internet with her.</p><p>At about seven o’clock in the evening, they arrived at Songcheng. Instead of going back to the campus, they went to a five-star hotel which Lou Cheng had booked before.</p><p>Outside the window, it was dark with colorful neon lights shining. Inside the room, it was as warm as a spring day. While Yan Zheke wasn’t watching, Lou Cheng called the telephone in their room and pretended that it was a call from the receptionist.</p><p>“There’s one more thing to take care of. I need to go downstairs,” he said to Yan Zheke after he picked up the phone and talked for a while.</p><p>Yan Zheke did not suspect him at all. She answered him in a light tone while looking for her pajamas. “Okay, get back quickly.”</p><p>“Okay.” Lou Cheng walked out of the room and was ready to buy flowers!</p><p>After walking out of the hotel, in order to save time, he found many children on the street who were wandering around selling flowers and bought a bunch of roses from them without even asking the price.</p><p>Then he wrote a message to the girl and sent her an e-mail.</p><p>After Yan Zheke took a bath, she put on some comfortable pajamas and wore slippers without socks. When she went back to the bed, she picked up the phone.</p><p>“Please check your email!” Lou Cheng said in his message.</p><p><em>“My email?”</em> Yan Zheke was confused but also began to expect some surprises. She quickly opened the Mailbox APP on her phone and found a video from her boyfriend.</p><p>After downloading the video, she changed her posture and leaned against the bed more comfortably. She then played it. Even though the video was shaking for a moment, she still saw Lou Cheng in the video.</p><p>“From now on, every Valentine’s Day will become our anniversary day. I’m afraid that you will be losing a holiday.” Facing the camera, Lou Cheng smiled shyly.</p><p><em>“As long as you know it…”</em> Yan Zheke answered him silently in her heart.</p><p>Lou Cheng cleared his throat and looked straight at her.</p><p>“On Valentine’s Day this year and on our first anniversary, I want to tell you a story about a boy, about a boy that pursues a girl.</p><p>“There was a boy who held an unrequited love for a beautiful and kind girl in his highschool. He regarded her as his goddess, but back then, he was still slightly self-abased and dared not to pursue her or to give it a try, because he thought he wasn’t good enough to be her boyfriend and he wouldn’t have any chance.</p><p>“However, because of fate, they were admitted to the same university. The longing that shouted in his heart made him want to do something.”</p><p>Yan Zheke quietly listened to his words and gradually let out a smile. She knew what story Lou Cheng was about to tell.</p><p><em>“How will he tell me the next part of the story?”</em> She had some expectations.</p><p>“That day, he saw the girl wearing traditional Chinese clothes in red and white. Standing in front of the martial arts arena, the boy was once again stunned by her beauty. He was encouraged by the theory of fate and finally found the courage to talk to her. In order to make himself feel less nervous, he specifically ran in a big circle around the campus. He was breathing so heavily that it made his blushed face and stammer seem insignificant.” In the video, Lou Cheng recalled these memories with a blushed face.</p><p>“I don’t even know the story behind… ” Yan Zheke opened her mouth slightly, feeling surprised and pleased.</p><p>While recalling the scene at that time and listening to the story behind it, she could not help but scold him in a low voice.</p><p>“Dumb Cheng!”</p><p>How dumb was he? He even ran around the campus!</p><p>At that moment, a beautiful melody began and the background of the video changed. A photo appeared and occupied the whole screen. It was of a gorgeous girl wearing a suit of traditional Chinese clothes who stood in front of the martial arts arena.</p><p>“Oh… ” Yan Zheke stretched out her hand and covered her mouth.</p><p><em>How does Cheng have a photo of me from that time?</em></p><p><em>Didn’t he say that he was too nervous to take a photo of me secretly?</em></p><p>“The girl was friendly and her personality was even better than what the boy had imagined. These two people had a good conversation. He even became cheeky and asked her for her QQ number. Then his dreamy and unbelievable life began.</p><p>“He restrained his desire and dared to talk to the girl for only a few minutes every time for fear that she would get annoyed and feel herself being entangled. As time passed, they became more and more familiar with each other and their chatting time also became longer. He was surprised to find that the girl actually was very cute…”</p><p>While the background music was still playing, emojis jumped out one by one. There was a Dodge emoji, a “well-behaved sitting” emoji, an emoji with both hands crossed holding the chin… Watching those emojis, Yan Yan almost laughed out loud.</p><p><em>“He made a fairly good video…”</em> she thought happily.</p><p>“When it came to her birthday, the boy did not dare to do too many things for her, because he was afraid that his enthusiasm would scare his fairy. So, holding much desire but also feeling nervous, the boy went to Yanling City to participate in the Warrior Sage Candidate Challenge Tournament.</p><p>“During this Challenge Tournament, he found more common ground with the girl and let her enter into his life. It was also at this Challenge Tournament that he heard the first cheers for him since he began to learn martial arts. The cheering sounds came from the girl.”</p><p>The man in the video stopped telling the story while an abnormally familiar, soft sound of a girl suddenly played in the video.</p><p>“Lou Cheng! Lou Cheng! Lou Cheng, come on!”</p><p><em>“This… ”</em> Yan Zheke once again covered her mouth and was surprised to look to the other side.</p><p><em>Cheng still kept the voice message I sent to him at that time?</em></p><p>“The fact that the first cheers for him were from the girl he had a crush on made the boy filled with power and courage. He defeated several mighty opponents and then advanced to the group competition. This time, the girl sang a cheering song for him after he begged her several times.”</p><p>While the background music was playing, the same clear voice from before hummed a passionate song.</p><p>“Continue to run, with the pride of youth,</p><p>“Life’s brilliance cannot be seen unless we persevere,</p><p>“Rather than to live mediocrely, why not burn with passion?”</p><p>“He kept all of those messages… ” Yan Zheke let out a sigh and was moved to tears.</p><p>“All these memories are worth being remembered throughout the boy’s life. He keeps all the voice messages, all the chat logs, all the happy moments he spent with the girl, and hides these things in different places. He wants to sit on a rocking chair and recall all these memories together with the girl when they are old.”</p><p>Later, many photos appeared on the screen and a lot of screenshots of their previous chats floated out. While hearing Lou Cheng’s narration, Yan Zheke also began to recall the past, the happy moments that they spent together this year.</p><p>On New Year’s Eve, both of them held their cell phones and quietly listened to each other’s breathing while waiting for the coming of the new year…</p><p>In the early hours of his birthday, the girl called and sang a celebration song for him…</p><p>On Valentine’s Day, shining by the moon, one sentence of the girl saying, “At first let me feel happy for five minutes,” was exchanged for a video about amazing fireworks which was sent by the boy.</p><p>He also shared details about how he checked those places before their first date and his complex feelings he had on that first date, which was that he was too nervous to hold the girl’s hand. Furthermore, the first time that they held each other’s hand, both of them were so nervous that they lost their direction and wandered aimlessly…</p><p>He then told her the great effort he made for their first kiss, the passionate and amazing kiss they had beside the lake…</p><p>The contradiction and misunderstanding caused by his keen desire and passion…</p><p>The feelings they had as if they were a longtime couple when they got up early in the morning…</p><p>The solemn moment they spent when they sent each other a ring, and the fun they had when he first called the girl “my wife”…</p><p>While recalling the past, Yan Zheke was about to cry. She seemed to be drunk and had lost herself in her mind. She felt like she was once again lying on Lou Cheng’s bed and bathing in the sunshine while he was taking off her clothes piece by piece. She again experienced all the memorable moments when he had moved her. Those moments were too many to be present in this video.</p><p><em>You are so dumb. How can you only remember what I’ve done for you and forget what you’ve done for me!?</em></p><p>“… And again it’s Valentine’s Day. I want to give you this story. I hope the boy and the girl in this story can have new stories every year so that I can tell their stories to you every year like today,” Lou Cheng said in a low voice. Yan Zheke listened to his voice carefully and was deeply touched by what he said.</p><p>Yan Zheke saved this video because she wanted to record their memories just like Lou Cheng had done.</p><p>At that moment, she pursed her lips and smiled with tears remaining in her eyes while sending Lou Cheng an audio recording that she had prepared previously.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the door, Lou Cheng took the flowers and counted the time in his heart because he intended to give Yan Zheke the flowers when Yan Zheke was watching the most touching moment of the video.</p><p>His cell phone suddenly rang at that moment, and he found a message from Yan Zheke.</p><p>“What?” Lou Cheng was confused but also had some expectations while holding the phone to his ear.</p><p>“Cheng, I’ve been thinking all the time about what kind of gift I can give you on Valentine’s Day. Finally, I decided to give you an answer as a gift.” Lou Cheng heard the soft and low voice of Yan Zheke.</p><p>“Do you remember the last Valentine’s Day? You told me that you liked Yan Zheke, you liked Yan Zheke very much. I was not only very happy but also quite frightened. I also felt very panicked because I hoped that you could wait for me until I liked you as much as you liked me and until I could gradually make some changes to allow another person to enter my life.</p><p>“I remember a lot of things you have done, but I don’t quite remember a lot of the words that I have said. I don’t know whether I have answered you before or not. Anyway, now I want to tell you formally.</p><p><em>“Cheng, I like you. I really like you. I like you very much.”</em></p><p>While her voice was gentle and full of emotions, Lou Cheng’s heart was hit by her open and honest mind.</p><p>“Cheng, I like you, I like you very much… ” The corners of his mouth were lifted and he opened the door with his room card while holding the flowers.</p><p>…</p><p>The flowers were scattered on the floor. Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke lay on the bed and cuddled each other.</p><p>Yan Zheke seemed to think of something suddenly. She nimbly moved her right foot upward so that it was resting on Lou Cheng’s legs.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Lou Cheng asked, shocked by her sudden movement.</p><p>Yan Zheke pulled herself backward. She seemed to be scared of Lou Cheng’s penis, but she also felt very curious about it, so she touched it with her toes.</p><p>“It’s strange. It’s so soft and is totally different from before!”</p><p>Instead of using her hands, she felt less scared of it and less awkward because she thought touching it with her toe let her keep a safe distance from it.</p><p>“… ” At that moment, Lou Cheng felt speechless, so he only watched the girl touch his sensitive part with her toes.</p><p>“It will be much funnier if it keeps being soft… ” Yan Zheke said with her face blushing as she seemed to feel more relaxed. However, before she finished her words, she was very surprised to see that his sensitive part stuck out bit by bit. She could not help crying out.</p><p>“You need to handle this!” Lou Cheng looked into her eyes as there was a flame burning in his eyes.</p><p>“How, how can I handle this… ” Yan Zheke was slightly stammering, but she still looked like she had made mental preparations for this.</p><p><em>“Help, help me… ”</em> Lou Cheng did not say it directly, he only pulled the girl’s hand on his sensitive part.</p><p>“Hey, why are you only putting two fingers on it? Are you trying to take food…</p><p>“In this way, like this… ”</p><p>After a while, thanks to Lou Cheng’s specific instructions and guidance, Yan Zheke finally mastered the basic skills. She was too shy to look at it, so she turned to the other side and was shocked by its frightening size.</p><p>After a long time, she gradually dared to look straight at it. She asked him quite curiously with her shy and bright eyes,</p><p>“Cheng, why do boys call this ‘jerkingoff?’”</p><p>“Don’t, don’t stop. I’ll tell you later… ” Even before he finished his words, Lou Cheng let out a sigh with satisfaction and then he said timidly, “Do you understand now?”</p><p>“You are a pervert!” Yan Zheke got off the bed and rushed into the bathroom.</p><p>…</p><p>After spending a good night with Yan Zheke, Lou Cheng tried so hard to amuse her and make her stop being angry. They then came back to the new school campus of Songcheng University and saw Lin Que, Li Mao, Cai Zongming, and other members.</p><p>At the first special training session of the semester, they stood in a circle and covered each other’s hands while shouting in unison,</p><p>“The National Games!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
