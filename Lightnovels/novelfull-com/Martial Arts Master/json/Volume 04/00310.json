So she began revealing that information while thinking, “Gu Yue was a senior student, of Professional Ninth Pin, and he was one of the toughest ones in Guannan School. Fei Sanli is said to be close to Professional Ninth Pin, but he hasn’t attended the Ranking Event yet, so his real level remains to be seen. Ji Lan got the certification of Amateur First Pin in June, and the highest level out of all the newcomers was Amateur Second Pin.”</p><p>Hearing the current situation in Guannan School, Li Mao, Sun Jian and others were all lost in thought.</p><p>A year has passed. Ji Lan had advanced one Pin further, and Fei Sanli had advanced a half-step. Though Gu Yue had also advanced to some extent, he was still unable to reach the threshold of Dan stage. All these changes were common to see in normal martial arts clubs. However, things were different in their own club. Last year, they only had one Professional Ninth Pin fighter, one Amateur First Pin fighter, and several fellows of Amateur Second or Third Pin. Now, there were two Dan-stage warriors, one borderline Professional Ninth Pin fighter, and several students at Amateur First or Second Pin in their club, which was more like a dream for the other schools!</p><p>…</p><p>In Guannan School Martial Arts Club.</p><p>Seeing the results after the lots were drawn, Ji Lan blurted out with great astonishment, fear, and depression.</p><p>“What a coincidence!”</p><p>What a coincidence, that they would draw Songcheng University, the same opponent as last year.</p><p>“Damn it!” Gu Yue tightened his muscles so much that they quivered beneath his clothes, then he grabbed a glass off the table and threw it on the ground.</p><p>Hearing the sound of the glass breaking, several new members stepped back out of fear, not daring to face their angry club manager.</p><p>After Gu Yue strode out of the office with broad steps, Fei Sanli touched his bald head and smiled wryly.</p><p>“We can already see the result of this year’s competition. I’d better join next week’s Ranking Event for Professional Ninth Pin, in order to not waste time. Let’s go, let’s go.”</p><p>Waving his hand, Fei Sanli also exited the room, leaving the speechless new members behind with Ji Lan, who was still clenching her teeth.</p><p>“Ji Lan, read the ranking list of Songcheng University’s substitutes’ strength. They mustn’t let both Lou Cheng and Lin Que fight against us,” said coach Gu Zhen, as he touched his grey hair and sighed.</p><p>After aking a deep breather, Ji Lan pulled out her cellphone and began to read the list in a stifled voice.</p><p>“Li Mao, Amateur First Pin; Sun Jian, Amateur First Pin; Yan Zheke, Amateur Second Pin, but she didn’t attend the Ranking Event on September; Lin Hua, Amateur Second Pin; Cai Zongming, Amateur Second Pin; He Zi, Amateur Second Pin; Wang Dali, Amateur Second Pin; Jin Lu, Amateur Second Pin; Guo Qing, Amateur Third Pin; Mu Jinnian, Amateur Third Pin… ”</p><p>After reading it all, Ji Lan thought to herself,</p><p>“As for their leading players, Lou Cheng is a Professional Eighth Pin warrior with Seventh Pin strength, and Lin Que is a Dan-stage warrior that is stronger than some Eighth Pin warriors. They are definitely among the top-four of this competition!”</p><p>Is it possible for us to win this fight?</p><p>Friendship first, competition second?</p><p>…</p><p>The autumn sky was clear, and the crisp night-air carried a refreshing breeze.</p><p>Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke were taking a walk hand in hand along the lakeside, basking in the joy of the good result from the drawing. They were also reminiscing about was last year’s competition and their future goals.</p><p>The freezing air was flowing against their faces, so gently that not even the water was rippling. After chatting for a while, Lou Cheng was preparing to leave, when he noticed Zheke lightly pulling his sleeve.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” He said, looking towards her while smiling.</p><p>He seldom saw Zheke act like this.</p><p>Yan Zheke stood there wearing Lou Cheng’s coat, with her long black hair hanging casually behind her, serving as the background to her small white face. Her eyelashes were trembling as she carefully said, “Cheng, I have something to discuss with you.”</p><p>“What’s the matter?” Lou Cheng said in confusion.</p><p>“I don’t want to attend next week’s Ranking Event for Professional Ninth Pin… ” Yan Zheke said, less confidently, “I’m not confident, and I just planned on training myself in the Ranking Event to gain some experience for the district contest. Now that the Martial Arts Competition will be held one week earlier, I’m afraid there won’t be enough time for me to recover from the Ranking Event, so I’ve decided not to put the cart before the horse.”</p><p>Normally, She would have talked to Cheng in a rational and direct manner that matched her character and style, but she felt insecure and guilty when she was about to tell the truth.</p><p>Damn it! Why should I feel guilty?</p><p>Lou Cheng had already anticipated Zheke’s change of mind when he heard the adjustment to the competition’s schedule, so he responded with a smile instead of feeling surprised, and said,</p><p>“It’s reasonable. The Ranking Event for Professional Ninth Pin will last for two weeks and four days, with three high-level matches per day. Since you don’t have the same abnormal stamina as me, it would be difficult for you to recover from the Event within one week.”</p><p>Though saying it like this, Lou Cheng was actually feeling slightly regretful and disappointed. Though they were back in Songcheng for two months now, he had yet to find a chance to spend time with Zheke. He had intended to book a hotel room for their precious time together during the Ranking Event, but now it seemed unlikely. What a pity…</p><p>Thinking of this, Lou Cheng smiled in order to let Ke know he wasn’t annoyed at all, and said,</p><p>“It’s okay, we will have plenty of chances in the future.”</p><p>Yan Zheke pretended to be irritated with him while giving him a punch out of both anger and joy.</p><p>“What are you talking about!”</p><p>“I mean that we will have more chances to attend the Ranking Event for Professional Ninth Pin in the future… ” Lou Cheng said while giggling.</p><p>Before he could finish his explanation, Yan Zheke closed her eyes, stood on her tiptoes, and kissed the corner of Lou Cheng mouth. Then she deliberately said with a soft voice,</p><p>“Honey, you’re perfect.”</p><p>Right after the kiss, Zheke turned to run away with a red face while waving her hands, leaving behind a string of laughter as she left.</p><p>After being stunned for two or three seconds, Lou Cheng touched his mouth while smiling, and then lengthened his stride to keep up with her.</p><p>Only at moments like this could Lou Cheng, a mature young man who had experienced many things, see the 19-year-old boy living in his heart.</p><p>…</p><p>Yan Zheke went back to her dorm at a brisk pace. As she opened the door, Yan Zheke asked, in order to prevent being made fun of by Li Liantong, “Dirty Tong, are you still studying? It’s already so late.”</p><p>Li Liantong gave out a sad cry, “It’s not what I want!”</p><p>“I’m only a sophomore, but professional courses are piling up with an increasing degree of difficulty. Damn it, I’m already worn out from translating all these Latin words!”</p><p>Yan Zheke could understand Dirty Tong’s feelings since she was also suffering. “Me too! Just listening to the teacher isn’t enough to help us comprehend the subject. We used to go out and have fun once a week, but now it’s once every two or three weeks.”</p><p>Of course, such hard work helped maintain her spot in the top 5% of her class. As for those who just wanted to graduate with an Undergraduate Diploma and Degree Certificate, they only needed to listen to the teachers carefully and review before the exam. So they still had enough time for fun.</p><p>Sigh… Recently, she was open about going on dates with Cheng in the self-study room and library…</p><p>“Once every two or three weeks? How could your Cheng bear it?” said Li Liantong, while turning to give Zheke a surprised look and implying something lewd.</p><p>“What are you talking about! We see each other every day!” Yan Zheke pretended not to understand her words.</p><p>Li Liantong tut-tutted, “You have been dating for nearly nine months, right? Hasn’t your relationship developed? I don’t believe that your Cheng is an ascetic monk! He is an energetic young man, who can’t help wanting more once he’s had a taste… ”</p><p>Before she could finish talking, Yan Zheke picked up the decorative telephone and said angrily,</p><p>“Hello, 110? There is a female hoodlum here!”</p><p>Their conversation amused Shi Xiangyang and Zong Yanru. Even so, Zong Yanru helped change the topic because she was close friends with Yan Zheke. “Dirty Tong, I can’t agree with you. What’s wrong with a monk? I remember this saying from a book. One for Buddhism, two for the monk, three for the lustful devil, four for Asmodeus.”</p><p>Li Liantong nodded immediately, “Yes, yes, yes, there are lots of face time with a monk as the main character!”</p><p>Being successful in changing the topic, Yan Zheke breathed with relief. While listening to the girls’ chatting, she took out her cell phone to reply to Lou Cheng’s text and logged in to the forum to see the public’s attitude towards the result of the drawing.</p><p>In the Lou Cheng fan forum, “Eternal Nightfall,” Yan Xiaoling posted a topic titled “Broadcast for ‘Martial Arts Club’s Reaction to the Drawing!’”</p><p>In the main post, she wrote, “So sad. I didn’t attend the ceremony because I was scared of the television camera, no, cross this part out, cross this part out. I wasn’t allowed to enter the office since I’m not a special-training fighter, but I had an undercover source in the office. Let’s welcome reporter He Zi, no, reporter ‘Many Cats,’ for the scoop~”</p><p>In the second post of this topic, “Many Cats” wrote,</p><p>“… When drawing Guannan School, Lou Cheng gazed at senior sister Yan for the 28th times tonight, and senior sister Yan looked back for the 28th time, too.”</p><p>“What?” Yan Zheke opened her mouth with an innocent look, and then looked up while recalling all her actions tonight. She began seriously counting the number of times she made eye contact with Cheng.</p><p>She’s lying! I only made eye contact with Cheng 19 times.</p><p>Turning her gaze downwards, she continued to read the report. “… Lin Que closed his eyes and put both hands in his pockets with usual, emotionless, expression. He doesn’t know that Jinjin is always looking at him. Club manager Cai Zongming is chatting with senior brother Li Mao happily, but it seems brother Li Mao wanted to cover his ears with his hands several times. Reporter Shu is like a shark that smelled blood, constantly shifting her attention from one fighter to another. Senior sister Guo Qing gave Senior sister Lin Hua a big hug. Coach Shi finished drinking all his wine and is now shaking his bottle to see if there is an extra drop. It seems he doesn’t care about the drawing at all… ”</p><p>While reading the descriptions, Yan Zheke kept a soft smile on her face. She was now surrounded by a warm feeling.</p><p>This is our Martial Arts Club, ours…</p><p>“Then what about you, reporter Cat?” Unparalleled Dragon King asked out of curiosity.</p><p>“Many Cats” replied, “Meow, meow, meow?”</p><p>…</p><p>The busy and fulfilling days passed quickly, and the University Martial Arts Competition was nearer and nearer. Finally, Saturday came.</p><p>Mu Jinnian and Yan Xiaoling, who failed to enter the competition, came together to the gymnasium. There were already so many people here, among which they saw many schoolmates.</p><p>“I’m so excited, we are playing on our home ground!” Taking advantage of her height, Yan Xiaoling jumped around in the stands until she finally found seats for both of them.</p><p>Mu Jinnian was wearing a white Songcheng University martial arts suit with black borders and a backpack, from which she took out a banner with Lin Que’s name on it and cheering equipment, a vuvuzela, and an inflatable hammer.</p><p>“Wow… Jinjin, you brought all this?” Yan Xiaoling said while staring in astonishment.</p><p>“Shouldn’t I bring these things?” Mu Jinnian said while looking at her in confusion, “You didn’t prepare anything for the competition? Aren’t you a big fan?”</p><p>“I, I’m too excited… Well, I’m going to help senior sister Wen!” said Yan Xiaoling, leaving her seat in embarrassment.</p><p>Fanfan, Dragon King, Okamoto, Bull Demon King, Naive, Qiqi… I fail to live up to the forum!</p><p>…</p><p>In the locker room for the home team, Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke were sitting on a bench shoulder to shoulder. They both leaned back against the wall to relax and wait for their turn.</p><p>He heard the cheering and yelling from outside, which reminded him of what had happened last time they played on home ground.</p><p>They lost the game to Wensheng School and Zhou Zhengquan, but none of them got discouraged. Instead, they all shouted, “We’ll be back”!</p><p>With all these thoughts flashing through his mind, he found the cheering outside was gradually amplified and kept in good order.</p><p>What were they cheering for? Lou Cheng turned his ear to the door out of curiosity and focused on listening.</p><p>The sound became distinct and formed a tidal wave.</p><p>“We’re coming!”</p><p>“We’re coming!”</p><p>“We’ll be back… We’re coming?” Lou Cheng soon understood the intentions of his schoolmates. They were actually extending their cheering from the last competition! It was their answer to last year!</p><p>While fighting to keep his tears back, Lou Cheng clenched his fists.</p><p>Yes, we are coming!</p><p>Thank you for waiting all this time!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
