Even when they used Ice Mirror and Enemy Heart Freezing Move to sense each inch of space and the Nine Words Formula in search of resonance, their attempts were futile.</p><p>“What about the natal artifact of the Longhu Immortal?” Geezer Shi mumbled to himself with doubt.</p><p>Lou Cheng thought about it for some time before saying, “Perhaps the branch of the Longhu Immortal had a unique way of forming Dan and didn’t have any natal artifact. Gehui when he assaulted me couldn’t have underestimated me so badly and not didn’t such strong assistance if he had it.”</p><p>“Sounds reasonable… Cough. Brat, you are getting a little more insightful.” Geezer Shi couldn’t help but remark emotionally.</p><p>Lou Cheng found it funny and was a little offended, “Master, don’t always see me as that student who just began Martial Arts. I’m already close to the physical invulnerability stage!”</p><p>After practicing for so many years, fighting in so many matches and experiencing so many things, how can my foresight and knowledge not have grown?</p><p>“So what? Even if you have reached the physical invulnerability stage, you are still my disciple!” Geezer Shi replied and stared at him.</p><p>He did not stay on this topic any further and asked, “Have you seen all of that confidential information? Is it useful?”</p><p>Since Lou Cheng decided to take the path of combining Martial Arts and Cultivation, Shi Jianguo had been using his connection to obtain records of Cultivation that the military’s human body research lab had been collecting and experimental reports on over thirty volunteers. This was to help him better understand the core and the details.</p><p>Besides the improvement in my prediction ability, this is one of the reasons why I appeared “mysterious” in front of others… Lou Cheng sighed in secret. After thinking about it for several seconds, he continued, “I have completed going through them but I still couldn’t understand the most crucial parts.”</p><p>“If it is really so easy to understand, our country would have had a large team of Cultivators guarding the cities a long time ago!” Geezer Shi retorted while laughing. “Others have used decades of hard work to achieve their current results. Are you thinking of surpassing them with just a month or two of work?”</p><p>“Your disciple is just trying to find the entry point that is the most suitable for me. I don’t really mean to fully understand the whole system and research every part of it…” Lou Cheng forced a smile and try to explain for himself.</p><p>Geezer Shi waved his hand and said, “Alright, let’s talk when we get out. There doesn’t seem to be anything useful in this place.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Lou Cheng nodded his head slightly, turned his body to face the sitting couch and bowed with respect.</p><p>He had initially wanted to tell the Longhu Immortal the results and that his path was wrong. In the end, he couldn’t bring himself to do it and could only thank him softly, “Thank you senior for exploring the path for future generations.”</p><p>“Thank you senior for gifting this encounter.”</p><p>After bowing three consecutive times, Lou Cheng collected his emotions, followed his master and left the cave.</p><p>“Sigh. Road of Immortality… Road of Immortality…” Geezer Shi stood at the entrance and sighed. Waving his hand and sending a shockwave to the surrounding, he buried the Longhu Immortal.</p><p>In his way of thinking, since the Longhu Immortal had passed away, it would be best if he could rest peacefully underground.</p><p>While walking towards the shore, the disciple and master duo shook off the ice layers formed over their body and evaporated the remaining moisture. Other than their clothing being wrinkled, they were basically the same as they were before they went down into the lake.</p><p>Yan Zheke heaved a sigh of relief and walked up to them, returning them their belongings.</p><p>Lou Cheng used his palm to iron his clothes while asking his Master several questions. When Geezer Shi left, he unlocked his phone screen, clicked into the APP and started summarising and recording his thoughts,</p><p>“In the last words of Longhu Immortal, “integrating nature” and “Immortal like heaven and earth” reminds me of something.”</p><p>“In the past, using his Great Sun Star System as the blueprint, I extended and improved it. Treating the various stars as “Fire Force” and the darkness of the universe as “Ice Force” respectively, I feel that I have a more magical connection with the Heavens and Earth. The secret of being able to connect with the Heavens and Earth once the Jindan is formed might be hiding within this.”</p><p>As he finished speaking, he turned to Yan Zheke. Using an explanatory tone, he said, “At that time, I found this rather magical and should have remembered it. Subsequently, I do not have similar experiences and have gradually forgotten about it. If it wasn’t because I saw the last words of the Longhu Immortal today and got some triggers, I would probably have to wait till you achieved balance and formed Dan before I could remember it again.”</p><p>“The Longhu Immortal has shifted the stars and changed the layout. The book of thoughts engraved on the Jindan, that recorded the practice of Nine Words Formula and Cultivation could be used as a reference. In this case, I can naturally use the Nine Words Formula while maintaining a balanced Dan and execute Force Concentration with the supplement of the Fighting Formula. Just thinking about it makes me excited.”</p><p>“At that time, I’ll be a superman with monstrous strength!”</p><p>Yan Zheke chuckled at what she heard, showing her beautiful dimples. She felt that the way Lou Cheng recorded his thoughts and insights in front of her was very warming.</p><p>After typing them, Lou Cheng read them from the beginning twice. After some minor adjustment, he saved it and tilted to his little fairy girl, “Now I’ll just have to wait until your congenital deficiencies are replenished, understand the concept of “withdrawing” and achieved balance to form Dan!”</p><p>At that time, I’ll be able to look at the details from the side and corroborate with what I conjecture!</p><p>“Oh…” Yan Zheke pretended to be nonchalant but his dark and beautiful eyes started looking up.</p><p>“Have you told to Dirty Tong and the rest that you would like to share their bed?” Lou Cheng held on to the hand of Yan Zheke and walked towards the long bridge.</p><p>“I informed them long ago. I will squeeze in with Ru and the new girl in their dormitory but will not stay at night because she as started her internship.” Yan Zheke smiled and replied.</p><p>Lou Cheng was about to continue when his right leg suddenly felt like a thousand pounds weighed on it. This also made him lose his balance and fall.</p><p>Shifting his centre of gravity, he easily steadied himself. He looked with a face of doubts to his wife and asked, “What just happened?”</p><p>With the lighting from the road lamps, Yan Zheke’s exquisite and beautiful facial features were unparalleled. Her long and dark eyelashes moved and with her innocent-looking eyes, she replied, “What do you mean? I don’t know anything.”</p><p>After completing her line, she suddenly couldn’t control herself. She tilted her head to the side, covered her mouth and clear laughter could be heard.</p><p>Lou Cheng suddenly had the realization and immediately asked with surprise and joy, “You have awakened your supernatural ability?”</p><p>A supernatural ability inherited from her grandparents and Empress Dowager?</p><p>As compared to her Cousin-in-law, Ke’s supernatural ability should have been easier to awaken. The reason why it hadn’t appeared was because of her congenital deficiencies. Since her supernatural ability is awakened, does it mean that she had made up for her congenital deficiencies?</p><p>“Yeah, didn’t I look exhausted for the past two days? You still thought that it was due to the stress of examinations and gave me massages.” Yan Zheke tilted her head up and answered cheekily. “I had wanted to give you a surprise after some time but I failed to control it just now~”</p><p>“Great! You are really Coach Yan! What kind of supernatural ability?” Lou Cheng raised his thumb and asked.</p><p>“Hmph… It should be related to the magnetic field of the Earth. Just like attracting and repulsion and changes in the weight.” Yan Zheke moved her eyes as she answered.</p><p>“So does that mean your congenital deficiencies are no longer there?” Lou Cheng asked concerningly.</p><p>Yan Zheke bit her lips a little before answering proudly, “Of course~! I’m feeling that I’ve almost grasped the concept of “withdrawing”!”</p><p>“So fast…” Lou Cheng exclaimed in surprise. After which, he received a “what the hell are you saying” look from his wife.</p><p>He quickly changed his tone, acted like usual and nodded his head. “That should be the case. You have already been at the top end of professional ninth-pin for over two years. Moreover, you have been enduring the suffering of your congenital deficiencies for some time. All along, your love for martial arts hasn’t changed and you have put in the hard work. Your will is definitely sufficiently strong!”</p><p>“Admiring me?” Yan Zheke flicked her hair, acted proudly and was clearly feeling satisfied.</p><p>In her heart, she quietly added. Practicing martial arts isn’t simply because I love it. I also wish to accompany you and do something for you. Even if it is hard for me to reach the inhuman stage in the future, this would also be enough…</p><p>Lou Cheng complimented her in ecstasy but was criticised for using overly flamboyant words. Nonetheless, Yan Zheke smiled satisfactorily.</p><p>Just like in the past, the two of them bade goodbyes outside the female dormitory. Yan Zheke found the dorm room that she had moved out from. Under the guidance of Zong Yanru, she found Li Liantong and Shi Xiangyang.</p><p>“Wow, Ke, your skin has become so great! So white, tender and smooth!” Li Liantong widened her eyes, leaned closer and complimented. “Could it be because you receive nourishment frequently?”</p><p>“Pui! Can you not speak so sexually from the start? Let me get used to it a little first.” Yan Zheke replied with a little annoyance and joy. “These are the results of Cultivation. It isn’t what you said!”</p><p>“Is it?” Li Liantong started scrutinizing her friend from top to bottom. After which, she sneered, ” I… Don’t… Believe you… Your figure has gotten better too! Ahhhh. I also want a boyfriend!”</p><p>At this point, Shi Xiangyang didn’t pay attention to her. She hugged Yan Zheke and complimented, “Ke, you are really whiter, softer and smell better now!”</p><p>Zong Yanru insulted Li Liantong, “Dirty Tong has always had high standards but always failed to get her target. Just like how she knows this aspect so well but couldn’t put it into use!”</p><p>“Those that like me, I do not have the same feelings. Those that I like, they don’t have the same feelings for me. What else can I do? I’m also feeling desolate.” Li Liantong shrugged her shoulders and answered.</p><p>“For those you have feelings for, you have to give it a try after all. If you don’t try, how do you know if he has the same feelings for you? My Cheng always tells me about ‘what if’?” instructed Yan Zheke who really hope she could get it done.</p><p>Just as Li Liantong was about to answer, he suddenly recalled what her friend just said. A thought flashed passed his mind and she asked unconvincingly, “Ke, what did you just say? Cultivation? Have you watch too much tv?”</p><p>“Are you treating me as a fool? The real Cultivation is different from the path of Martial Arts but eventually converges to the same point. For an ordinary girl, she can just train her mind and use the mind to nourish the body. Although you wouldn’t get stronger through this, the skin will get better, whiter and acne and pimples wouldn’t leave scars behind.,” explained Yan Zheke.</p><p>When Lou Cheng was at his lowest point, they did think about starting a simplified “Cultivation beauty class”. However, they did not have the mood at all to consider the details. When he recovered fully from his sequela and had his strength restored, they wouldn’t have to do this. However, they did not stop and instead gradually perfected the course in their daily conversation to make it easier to understand and practice.</p><p>Naturally, one couldn’t just rely on this to get a very strong and healthy body.</p><p>“Are you sure?” Li Liantong, Zong Yanru and Shi Xiangyang all pressed further with doubts.</p><p>“Cheng came up with it. His path of martial arts had combined Cultivation in it.” Yan Zheke nodded her head seriously.</p><p>“Wah…” exclaimed Li Liantong. “Can we practice too?”</p><p>“Yea, of course. Cheng specifically created a simplified version.” Yan Zheke replied proudly.</p><p>“I’m, I’m going to make a statue of you Cheng and offer it three joss sticks in the morning and night each day!” Li Liantong started walking back and forth agitatedly and so were Zong Yanru and Shi Xiangyang.</p><p>“Don’t do this, he’s still living…” Yan Zheke covered her face and broke into laughter.</p><p>After several minutes, Li Liantong, Zong Yanru and Shi Xiangyang were all lying on their own bed. They sat down with the legs crossed and their palms and feets facing up. As for Yan Zheke, she quickly formed hand seals, changed her footsteps and shouting out,</p><p>“Confrontation!”</p><p>“Confrontation!”</p><p>“Confrontation!”</p><p>Seeing that Dirty Tong and the rest became quiet and at ease, Yan Zheke relaxed her stance. Looking across, an image of Lou Cheng supervising a group of oddballs wearing Feather Raiment while practicing Cultivation appeared in front of her. She suddenly felt like what Lou Cheng had often claimed he felt,</p><p>“Why does it feel like I’m spreading some evil cult teaching?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
