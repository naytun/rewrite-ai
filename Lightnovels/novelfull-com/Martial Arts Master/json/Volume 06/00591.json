Flowers bloomed and the scene was beautiful. Lou Cheng sat on a chair by the balcony and enjoyed the beautiful scene in front of him. However, his eyes weren’t focused, and he seemed to be in a daze.</p><p>After some time, he picked up his phone, unlocked the screen and typed several lines on it quickly, “My internal practice roots are approaching that of a physical invulnerability stage expert and my “All Seeing God” realm is also at this level.”</p><p>“All that is left is to break through the ‘connection between heaven and earth’ and I would have successfully made the great leap.”</p><p>“With regard to Cultivation, ‘connection between heaven and earth’ is equivalent to forming the Jindan. It is a natural product after combining one’s vitality, energy and mind into one. One gets stronger as the Jindan gets perfected and grows. On the path of martial arts, the will connects everything. With improvements in the mind and leveraging on the normal interactions of the body with the outside world, one could then find amazing ways to affect the environment. The reflection of the surrounding using the Ice Mirror is a simplified representation of this phenomenon.”</p><p>“If I wish to achieve the breakthrough, I will have to approach these two aspects at the same time, consolidate the learnings, find common points and find a path to physical invulnerability that is different from “achieving balance and forming Dan”.</p><p>After writing this paragraph, Lou Cheng flipped through the notes he had written previously and sunk into deep thoughts once again.</p><p>After breaking up the Jindan and eliminating future worries, Shi Jianguo had initially nagged at Yan Zheke to bring him away as he was an “eyesore”. However, as he was still in the state where his roots were not solid and the grave injuries of the body had not recovered, Lou Cheng wasn’t suited for long distance travelling. Eventually, Shi Jianguo brought him back to this beautiful environment with few people to recuperate.</p><p>Yan Zheke stayed for several days. She waited for him to recover his basic mobility ability before taking a plane back to Connecticut to continue with her school life which was getting busier.</p><p>As for Lou Cheng, he wanted to rest for another week before heading home and stay for several days to accompany his parents. After which, he wanted to go to America, stay far away from attention and focused on recovering.</p><p>Naturally, after confirming that this was fine, he called Qi Fang in the first instance. He told her that he benefited from the advancement of technology and martial arts and would be recovering fully soon. As to his friends, he couldn’t possibly inform them one by one and couldn’t clearly explain it to them. Therefore he just summarised it and sent to his group of friends indicating that his recovery was better than expected. In the process, he received various “likes” and well wishes.</p><p>Dragon King had intentions to allow him to resign with the club. However, he was hoping to achieve physical invulnerability before rejoining Longhu so that he would be deserving of that contract.</p><p>While recuperating, Lou Cheng wasn’t slacking off. Whenever he was free, he would be pondering about his future path of seeking a way to combine Cultivation and the path of Martial Arts. For the purpose of this, he had changed his habit of not writing a diary. Whenever he had new thoughts, a new way of thinking or new understanding, he would immediately pick up his phone and type them out in detail. After which, he would save it in several places so it would be convenient for him to come back and review and consolidate in the future.</p><p>Until this point, he finally understood why various sects had notes written by their predecessors and why experts in the martial arts would write about their thoughts, experiences, viewpoints and habits. These weren’t simply for making it easier for their future generations for references. It could also aid them in sorting their train of thought, preserving their thinking, and recording memories that they could not relive.</p><p>At this point, Lou Cheng often regretted that he didn’t keep a record of the time he started training his body to the time he achieved balance and formed his Dan. During this process, he had a complete understanding and experiences. If he could re-read them now, he would definitely be able to find something different. He might very well not need to wait for George and the rest to achieve the breakthrough in order to find the crux for himself to open a new path.</p><p>Sigh. A good memory still isn’t as good as lousy notes. Thinking back, all I could remember is balance, rotation, universe, stars and other major concepts… As these thoughts flashed passed his mind, Lou Cheng sensed something and turned to the corridor that led to the balcony. He saw a girl wearing a white t-shirt, jeans and light-coloured sports shoes walking towards him. Her eyes could mesmerize anyone and she was none other than Mo Jingting.</p><p>“Martial uncle, it seems like you are having a comfortable time here.” She smiled as she walked over. Pulling the chair out, she sat to his side, picked up the teapot, turned over a cup and poured herself a full cup of tea.</p><p>While doing this, she looked at Lou Cheng. She looked a little interested but more out of curiosity.</p><p>Who would have known that when I snuck back to the mountain for a holiday, I would meet with martial uncle who I haven’t seen for a long time!</p><p>His complexion isn’t too good, and he looked sickly… It seems like the injuries he previously had were worse than what the rumours had speculated. It has been over half a year and he still looked like he could be blown away by the wind…</p><p>Moreover, master has said that the most serious and troublesome issue with his injuries is the sequela. Rumours have it that this will cause him to lose the majority of his battling capabilities…</p><p>As she thought about these, Mo Jingting felt that she wouldn’t have to be so reserved and careful in front of him like before. She felt as though she could speak with him as an equal now.</p><p>“Aren’t you busy with the entertainment show? Why are you here?” Lou Cheng was enjoying the breeze and returned the question with a faint smile.</p><p>Just moments ago, he was having a chat with Yan Zheke. She mentioned about an entertainment show that had recently become a big hit. All the participants of that show had their status raised by a level. Mo Jingting happened to be one of them.</p><p>Mo Jingting sipped on a mouth of tea, turned his head to the sea of forest and answered emotionally, “I came back because I was a little tired. It’s quiet here and the air is fresh. Whenever I come back and rest for a few days, my mood substantially gets better.”</p><p>After pausing for several seconds, she casually asked, “Martial uncle, are you here to recuperate?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Lou Cheng didn’t intend to hide anything.</p><p>Mo Jingting turned her gaze away and continued with a smile, “I just remembered something. When I was transiting from being an actor to the music industry. I felt that I had good stamina, a loud voice, extremely great control over my vocals and other muscles and could be considered as great in KTV. I didn’t pay much attention to singing technique. As a result, I almost crumbled in my first experience in a recording room and cried on my way back to the condominium. After which, I put my pride aside and serously studied under a mentor for half a year before I finally had some small results. Since that day onwards, I know that there isn’t any obstacle that can’t be crossed. What is more important is one’s attitude.”</p><p>Lou Cheng almost broke into laughter. He shook his head gradually and said, “You don’t have to console me in such an indirect manner. I’m really fine now.”</p><p>I’m really fine.</p><p>Mo Jingting smiled and replied, “Martial uncle’s emotional qualities are the best!”</p><p>She did not harp on this topic. Suddenly, she had a thought in mind and laughed, “Martial uncle, are you interested to do business together?”</p><p>“Huh?” Lou Cheng couldn’t cope with the sudden change in topic.</p><p>Mo Jingting laughed, “I’m sure you know that our Sect has a large production company? Over the last two years, Internet TV programs and movies have been developing at a very fast pace. I have intentions to start a business with several other seniors in this field. At that time, we would each be investing a sum of money in it before raising capital from the Sect’s foundation trust. If it works out well, we will let the production company of the Sect acquires us. At that time, those who wish to cash in could do so and those who wish to keep a certain level of shareholdings could also keep their shares. Martial uncle, would you be interested chipping in and earning some pocket money?”</p><p>No matter how Martial uncle turns out in the future, just his status as an inhuman stage expert and the two physical invulnerability experts behind him would be enough to justify giving him shares even if he did not chip in. However, there isn’t a point to raise this up so soon.</p><p>This is taking advantage of the Ice God Sect… Lou Cheng was a little dumbfounded. He drank some tea before replying, “I’ll give it a pass. You all could go with it and don’t have to wait for me.”</p><p>“Really?” Mo Jingting was rather surprised.</p><p>This is a good deal! It’s equivalent to giving him money! Yet Martial uncle isn’t willing to accept!</p><p>“If I’m interested in the future, I will look for you again.” Lou Cheng rejected her in a more indirect manner.</p><p>Yan Zheke would be responsible for all future investments in the household in the future. There’s no need for me to dabble into this and waste my energy. If I have the time, it will be better off pondering about the matters of physical invulnerability.</p><p>After sensing the lukewarm attitude and determined uncle Martial, Mo Jingting did not continue on this. She chatted a little more with Lou Cheng before bidding goodbyes. While walking along the corridor towards her fixed dwelling unit, she was filled with lots of questions.</p><p>That’s strange. Considering Martial uncle’s condition, shouldn’t he be in a hurry to find another path and looking for ways to earn money for his latter part of his life? Shouldn’t he hit it off well with us?</p><p>Why doesn’t he look interested at all and didn’t even ask about the price?</p><p>Is it because the blow to him was too hard causing him to be totally demoralized and unwilling to do anything now?</p><p>Lou Cheng couldn’t care at all about what Mo Jingting thought. Seeing that lunchtime was approaching and there would be servants bringing his food over soon, he stood up, raised his phone camera and took a picture of the beautiful scene from the balcony.</p><p>He sent it to Yan Zheke, who was already sleeping, before posting it on his social media and friends circle. He also appended a poem, “The flowers in the plains had all withered by April while flowers in the mountain had just started blooming.”</p><p>A short while later, Lou Cheng received a call from “Talker” while enjoying his delicious lunch. “Cheng, why are you at Moshang?” asked Xiao Ming surprisingly.</p><p>Lou Cheng was lost and returned the question, “How do you know?”</p><p>“Do you think I’m stupid? When you upload the photo, your GPS was on!” scolded Xiaoming. “We are also in Moshang. Do you want to pay us a visit?”</p><p>“We? The University Martial Arts Nationals are held in Moshang this year?” A sudden realization struck Lou Cheng.</p><p>If everything was going on as usual, he would definitely pay attention to the trip of Songcheng University Martial Arts Club. However, who would have expected him to experience such a thing. His mood, attention and other aspects were all affected. Occasionally, he would hear bits and pieces of it from Xiao Ming. For example, Deng Yang broke through to the Dan stage at the end of last year. He Zi had also understood the concept of “withdrawing”. Under the leadership of the two of them, Songcheng University and Shannan had together eliminated the previous Champion, Shanbei, who experienced a void year after Peng Leyung graduated, and progressed together to the Nationals.</p><p>As to where the Nationals are held, he had forgotten to ask about it previously and didn’t search for it subsequently.</p><p>“Sigh. It has been less than a year and you have forgotten about us completely? Sigh. Some people only remember the glorious days, but who knew the tough times would be forgtten?” Cai Zongming acted despondently and sighed emotionally. “We are at Moshang and staying in the Yellow Crane Hotel. Are you coming? Just a word!”</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed, “Sure. Let me book a driver first. As to when, I’ll let you know after I confirm. There’s barely a soul on the mountain. Even if I wanted to book a car, I might not be able to. I can only look for the general affairs department of the sect.”</p><p>“Pfft… Are you practicing Immortality on the mountain?” mocked Cai Zongming.</p><p>…</p><p>The next afternoon, Lou Cheng wore a pair of black glasses. He tucked his hands into his jacket and walked into the Yellow Crane Hotel. He saw the still attractive “Talker”, Cai Zongming. He wore casual attire and looked more mature and more attractive than before. The only problem was that he still couldn’t take the step towards Dan Stage.</p><p>“Are you completely exhausted?” asked Xiao Ming with doubts.</p><p>Didn’t Cheng say that his body is recovering better than expected?</p><p>This is better than expected? How bad is expected then?</p><p>Lou Cheng sneered, “Talker, it seems like your eyes are failing you. Can’t you tell that I have to completely break things apart before I can get better? Can’t you tell that these are my second injuries? In those pictures that the reporters had taken, do I look so bad?”</p><p>“Second injuries?” Cai Zongming was lost and returned the question.</p><p>“It’s a price to pay to completely recover from before.” Lou Cheng explained in a simple manner.</p><p>Cai Zongming suddenly understood everything. He extended his hand, patted on the shoulders of Lou Cheng and said, “I knew that a guy like you would cause trouble for a thousand years! How could you possibly just exit so easily?”</p><p>Lou Cheng almost fell from this pat. He said angrily, “Please take care of the patient!”</p><p>“Pfft. I have to fully enjoy this experience of sending a high tier Dan stage flying with just a pat before you recover fully!” Xiao Ming patted without reserves again. Naturally, he did not exert strength this time.</p><p>As they spoke, he led Lou Cheng into his room. Deng Yang, He Zi, Yan Xiaoling and the rest were all waiting excitedly there.</p><p>“Master… Master… Senior Lou!” Yan Xiaoling called out before everyone. While stammering, she asked, “How are your injuries recovering? I heard from Senior Yan that it’s much better than expected…”</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled and replied, “Yeah, I can return to the arena in about three or four months.”</p><p>“Yay!” Yan Xiaoling waved her hands and jumped excitedly in a circle subconsciously. “I have to tell them and let them share the joy too!”</p><p>She took out her phone and posted a thread in the forum, “I saw senior. Yeah. I saw Lou Cheng! He said he will have recovered completely in three to four months and could participate in a competition!”</p><p>The forum instantly went into overdrive. The remaining members had started to fervently discuss this topic.</p><p>Several reporters would come by each day to see if there was any material for news. When they discovered the post by Eternal Nightfall, they quickly verified the contract details with the martial arts association through their internal channels. After which, they came out with a piece of headline news, “Lou Cheng is about to return but is no longer associated with Longhu. Does this mean that this is the limit of his potential?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
