The surrounding light had also creepily become darker. Dark grey clouds started rising from the ground and eery winds started blowing. As the winds howled and gathered, they suddenly penetrated Mouko Yamashita’s body. An exaggerated repulsive force expanded outwards forming an invisible barrier.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>With his strike connecting, Lou Cheng quickly summoned raging scorching flames to scatter the barely visible force field. However, he only managed to split half of it open. The more his punch moved ahead, the slower it got. It was as though he had sunk into an invisible swamp and eventually, he could no longer take a step ahead. His fist stopped just half a foot in front of the abdomen of his opponent when it seemed everything around him had solidified.</p><p>Retracting his “force field”, the magnetic force field behind Mouko Yamashita got distorted. A blurry black shadow holding two knives appeared behind Mouko Yamashita. A crimson red fog was surrounding it. Suddenly it took a step forward and “overlapped” with the real Mouko Yamashita as they became one.</p><p>The dull and gloomy Buddhist temple and deserted and quiet open field suddenly lit up. Mouko Yamashita looked like a general that was submerged in fresh blood and his eyes were locked on Lou Cheng who was right in front of him.</p><p>At this very moment, Lou Cheng suddenly sensed danger. It was as though he was facing an existence that could severely injure him. From the electrical pulses through his tail bone generated from Absolute Reaction to his Ice Mirror accurately reflecting and making judgement, to his supernatural ability to sense experience a short glance into the future, they were all signalling him to dodge quickly, avoid the edge and not engage in a head-on confrontation to prevent his body from suffering terrifying blows.</p><p>The next strike from Mouko Yamashita was definitely an attack stronger than his super killer move of “Seven Sins Hadouken”!</p><p>It was a killer move that could only be completed by using a special environment and settings made beforehand!</p><p>He might only be able to use this only once!</p><p>Lou Cheng’s body instinctively moved. His muscles and tendons gathered strength and he readied himself to leap away. This could allow him to cover ten to twenty metres in one jump, causing his opponent’s big move to miss and be at a disadvantage.</p><p>However at this moment, several conflicting thoughts flashed through his mind.</p><p>This should be similar to the physical invulnerability move of Hadouken, “Asura Massacre”. After he struck, he would only get quicker and his might would increase constantly with the accumulated kinetic energy. He might even be able to exceed the effective range…</p><p>With Mouko Yamashita’s current stage, even if he had a breakthrough in Bloodlust and was in use of other support, he would likely to be unable to fully bring out the fearsomeness of this move…</p><p>Moreover, he had taken over 30 strikes of “Emperor Yan Force” that was used together with Dan explosion directly. Even if his Bloodlust could withstand, neutralize and defend most of the explosion shockwave, the accumulated injuries wouldn’t be too light either.</p><p>His body’s ability to withstand pressure was decreasing. His attack might be strong but the defence was weak……</p><p>If I had fallen to a similar situation as before, there’s no way I could enter the state of “Encountering Gods In The Void, Self Reflection” and use consecutive simplified “Fighting” formulas to turn the tables around…</p><p>At that time, my body would be invaded by Bloodlust and my performance would fall constantly… The outcome would be unchangeable…</p><p>With only a split second, Lou Cheng couldn’t think too much about it. He didn’t hesitate and instantly made his decision. He believed in his own knowledge, foresight and experience more now and didn’t blindly follow Absolute Reaction, Ice Mirror and supernatural ability.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>He stomped both of his legs and the foundation of the Buddhist temple shook a little. In his mind, he had already visualized the heavy, scorching and ancient-looking “Emperor Yan”. He further allowed the flame force in his body to accumulate layer by layer while compressing it constantly into a small ball of scorching white flame with a small tinge of blue.</p><p>As the flame force had become heavier, more pure and more material through the morphing process of the inhuman stage, this whole process was rather quick and didn’t require much effort.</p><p>Following which, the fire god Zhu Rong arrived from the void riding a crimson red dragon. Lou Cheng was able to gain control of the fireball that was highly compressed and didn’t explode from directly from the expansion.</p><p>The thick blood-red fog around Mouko Yamashita started emanating a crimson light and completely covered him. With the charge of his fist, he smashed ahead. He looked just like the scythe of a shinigami that had come from the sea of blood in hell.</p><p>As compared to the “Seven Sins Hadouken”, the Bloodlust of this strike was off the roofs and sharper. It was like a knife, capable of splitting everything in this world into two!</p><p>“Seven Sins Hadouken”, the profound meaning of massacre, “Asura Massacre”!</p><p>When the blood-like rays appeared, Lou Cheng had completed twisting his ankles, turning his knees, opening his stance, swivelling his waist and other actions. These might seem complicated but Lou Cheng finished them in one smooth and connected series. He swung his arms open and was holding on to a seemingly illusory white ray. His punch was heavy and oppressive while also being tough and fierce!</p><p>Emperor Yan Force, Internal Explosion Punch!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The rays of blood hadn’t picked up speed when they were hit by Lou Cheng’s punch. Lou Cheng injected force into them and an exaggerated and deafening explosion erupted!</p><p>If it wasn’t the coldest period of winter now, crows on the roof of this deserted Buddhist temple would have been alarmed and the animals of the surrounding open field would have been scampering around in fear.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Sounds of explosion broke out incessantly, and the rays of blood shone strongly. Lou Cheng could only feel a cold sensation entering his body, causing his body to tense up. He was sent flying from the crazy gale-like power as he heard the various micro- cracking sounds throughout his body. He could also see the various areas in his body that had internal injuries.</p><p>The might of a single strike was shocking and frightening!</p><p>With his consciousness looking down from above, it acted as a god and illuminated his body. Lou Cheng was controlling the minute details and injuries of his body while also avoiding aggravating them. Using the method that caused the smallest negative impact to exert strength, he re-adjusted his centre of gravity in mid-air and landed steadily.</p><p>Other than looking paler than before and his clothes and shoes being tattered, he didn’t have other signs of being injured. As for Mouko Yamashita who was at the doorstep of the Buddhist temple, the crimson rays started to fade and the blood fog became thinner. His entire body was shivering slightly and there was some fresh blood oozing out from the edge of his mouth, eyes and nose.</p><p>The injuries that he had accumulated previously were all triggered completely by the “internal explosion”.</p><p>Lou Cheng believed that his injuries were worse than Mouko Yamashita. However as their control over their bodies weren’t at the same level, it might look like a big difference between them currently.</p><p>At this moment, his eyes twitched reflecting Mouko Yamashita raising his hands and was ready to form the hand signs.</p><p>“Wholeness” Formula!</p><p>He wanted to recover his stamina and mental strength to forcibly suppress his injuries as he sought the final victory!</p><p>Lou Cheng focused himself and regulated his breathing and blood flow. Using his ability to micro-control his body to the details, he simplified the process of the Army Formula. He didn’t use the hand seals and only incited the momentum to shout out the ancient word before Mouko Yamashita.</p><p>“Army”!</p><p>The Buddhist temple suddenly turned darker. The blood lust and confrontational aura from the ancient battleground were triggered. In an instant, they turned into shadows and followed Lou Cheng’s mental strength and pounced onto the body of Mouko Yamashita.</p><p>When he was on the plane previously, he had guessed that the battlefield might be an ancient battleground. At that time, Lou Cheng also conjectured the possibility that the effects and distance of the Army Formula would get stronger as a result!</p><p>And the answer was yes, they would!</p><p>In this instance, Mouko Yamashita could feel a chill creeping through his body. He could feel the souls of the soldiers that had horrible deaths tangling around his head, swinging a huge knife towards his neck. His head was on the verge of being severed and blood was gushing out.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>He screamed out in fear. The preparation for the “Wholeness” Formula had been in vain. At this very moment, Lou Cheng retracted his breathing and blood and gathered his mind and force to his lower abdomen to neutralize the majority of the abnormal status. When he did a Dan explosion, he had planned for a path of exerting strength that minimized the impacts on his injuries. Stomping both of his legs, he pounced to the front of Mouko Yamashita in one move. Swinging his left fist, he covered it with scorching white flames and completed a hook ruthlessly.</p><p>This was the boxing technique of the Geruga Sect. When used here, it was the most appropriate considering the burden on the body.</p><p>Bam! Mouko Yamashita pulled his elbow and formed a guard with his forearm in time. However his body was smashed by the explosion caused by “Emperor Yan Force”.</p><p>Bam! He relaxed and contracted his breathing and blood flow again. Swing his right arm this time, the flames were heavy and pulverized over.</p><p>He waited for Mouko Yamashita to try to withstand the attack. Striding ahead with the momentum, his right elbow smashed across and landed fiercely and ruthlessly.</p><p>Bam bam bam, bang bang bang! After several consecutive strikes, Lou Cheng suddenly turned and reverse grabbed with his left arm like a flaming iron whip. He landed ruthlessly between the arm guard of Mouko Yamashita, causing his shoulders to shiver and stagger backwards.</p><p>Gliding forward to close the distance, Lou Cheng crossed his right fist ahead. It was really quick and his opponent could only hastily guard against it.</p><p>This time, there wasn’t any explosion or burns. Chilling cold sensation invaded the body of Mouko Yamashita. He shivered in the cold and the boiling Bloodlust dissipated substantially, and his mind went blank.</p><p>With the extreme signs of his opponent getting weaker, Lou Cheng quickly opened up his arms and attacked from both the left and right. Bam bam bam! Lou Cheng landed consecutive strikes and the friction caused scorching red flames. Mouko Yamashita was completely flustered and unable to defend himself.</p><p>After fighting for a while, his storm-like combination punches suddenly stopped. Lou Cheng quickly twisted his waist and back and swung out his leg like a whip. Bam! It landed on the palms of Mouko Yamashita which he had hastily lifted to block. The palms were knocked back and the kick landed on Mouko Yamashita!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Mouko Yamashita was sent flying. In his body, the sounds of his bone cracking could be heard. He also spat out blood uncontrollably as his eyes become lost.</p><p>Lou Cheng contracted his back and was about to pounce again. However the skinny old man who was wearing a pointy hat stood in front of Mouko Yamashita before Lou Cheng could notice and announced the end of this match. It was clear who was the winner.</p><p>Lou Cheng won!</p><p>Mouko Yamashita was kneeling on the floor and saw Lou Cheng who was several steps away bowing in respect. Lou Cheng looked just like before as though he had not been affected by the battle. After bowing, he turned around and walked away slowly, barefooted.</p><p>This scene made Mouko Yamashita’s mind fall deeper and deeper and he could no longer see the light or any hope.</p><p>I have tried my best and even borrowed the strength from the environment. Yet I’m still not his match and he seemed to have done this so easily…</p><p>Lou Cheng left carefreely and walked out of the Buddhist temple. After walking in the deserted open field for a while, he waited and confirmed that he was completely out of sight of Mouko Yamashita and the pointy hat old man before heaving a sigh and relaxing the micro-control of his body.</p><p>After relaxing, his steps became weak suddenly and he almost fell.</p><p>“Senior, can you pass me my phone…” Lou Cheng’s face blushed as he looked towards the Divine Enchanter of Sin Flame who was walking quietly beside him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
