Each of them caused their own trepidation and disturbance in the air and, making it hard to differentiate them.</p><p>However, it might be easy to tell too. The Roman stone pillar that Brandon had previously clashed with was still slightly shaking. The corresponding figure from it was clear and obvious!</p><p>However, Lou Cheng strode sideways. Lowering his shoulders, he leaned to one side followed by moving his right arms quickly. Moving like a bullet, he threw his punch into the void where there wasn’t anyone.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>The sounds from the collision resulted in the windows of the main hall vibrating slightly. Skin, covered in starlight, expanded muscles, and forceful fingers, suddenly appeared in front of Lou Cheng’s right fist which was covered in ice frost and fog.</p><p>Unknowingly, Brandon had creepily changed his location and left an illusionary image standing beside the Roman stone pillar.</p><p>A total of seven figures were all a sham. His real body had long gone invisible as he wished to ambush Lou Cheng in the chaotic environment and deal a lethal strike!</p><p>For most of the inhuman stage experts, this was indeed very threatening. If Lou Cheng had not achieved a breakthrough in his Ice Mirror and was still at the stage in the past, he would have also had a hard time dealing with this situation. If he was even the smallest bit careless, he would have been dealt a serious blow. However, he currently had his consciousness at high grounds as a guardian angel. Using his Ice Mirror to reflect the area, he had long acutely discovered the phenomenon and struck first to disrupt the ambush of Brandon!</p><p>Pfft pfft pfft! At the same time, those seven figures that were formed from “light energy” had all pounced onto Lou Cheng, causing blinding rays and spinning starlight!</p><p>As for Lou Cheng, after he had connected with his strike, he had formed a thick layer of ice around his body surface. The ice was clear and thick and definitely didn’t seem ordinary. Under the burning of “light”, the ice melted and instantly turned into vapour, allowing Lou Cheng to withstand this round of attacks directly.</p><p>If he had not improved his Ice Armor, he would definitely not have choosen this method as a response!</p><p>Moreover the seven figures came from different directions. Their attacks weren’t stacked or invasive, allowing him to be able to deal with them calmly!</p><p>In the series of explosions, the seven figures disappeared. Brandon’s expression changed rapidly. He retracted his left arm and subconsciously flicked them as he felt excruciating pain.</p><p>He was almost injured when his punch was disrupted previously.</p><p>The pain stimulated Brandon’s spirit, stimulating his strong desire for violence. He was just like a soldier who was on a killing spree.</p><p>After sensing that Lou Cheng had weakened after previously taking the attacks directly, he tensed the muscles in his shoulders and threw a cross punch ahead without hesitation.</p><p>With such a strong and fierce attack as a cover, he took a huge stride forward with his left leg to trip Lou Cheng. It was for his own support and also a way for him to bind his opponent!</p><p>This was jujitsu that had been incorporated into the Geruga sect. Brandon wanted to turn the battle onto a ground grappling match. Leveraging his mastery over “Stars” to execute various techniques, he could disrupt the so-called Listening Skills of his opponent and completely pin him down.</p><p>Before he could extend his leg, Lou Cheng had taken a step back in response. In the eyes of the guests in the main hall, the two of them looked just like they were doing a well-rehearsed dance.</p><p>With his kick failing to connect and his cross punch not achieving any result, Brandon immediately tilted his body, lowered himself and extended his right palm. He wanted to use his well-trained techniques to throw his opponent to the floor.</p><p>Lou Cheng took another step back as though he knew his enemy’s intentions beforehand, causing him to fail on his throwing technique.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Lou Cheng twitched his right shoulder and threw out his arm. In the process, he turned it from soft to tense and smashed towards the side of Brandon’s neck like a whip.</p><p>Brandon lifted his right arm and made a defensive posture used in boxing. At the same time, he tilted his head to the side to guard against the subsequent attacks of his enemy.</p><p>When he was watching the videos of Lou Cheng’s battles, he had a clear memory of this and was wary about it!</p><p>Bam! His whip connected and Brandon’s arm shook a little. It was as though countless pieces of dust had been raised into the air. Just as he had expected, Lou Cheng wriggled his joints and opened up his fingers towards his face. Although he was still some distance away, it felt like he could reach him anytime.</p><p>Swoosh! From the tips of his fingers, Lou Cheng shot out rays of frost light like sharp arrows leaving his whole body towards directly from his enemy’s temples and eyes. They were moving faster than light and were more solid and fierce just like an ice spirit!</p><p>Brandon had expected the beginning but failed to expect the ending. When this situation happened, he was caught completely off guard. Cold sweat broke out on his back and he felt as though there was an electric shock flying through his pores.</p><p>He instinctively ducked his head down and curled his body. All he could hear was the sound of the arrows becoming longer as the chilling cold flew away from the edge of his head into the surface of a stone pillar.</p><p>Small pieces of ice frost fell off Brandon’s hair. Lou Cheng calmly retracted his breathing and blood flow and exploded his Dan force. Turning sideways, he tightened his trousers and swung his leg out towards his opponent, who was facing his side, like an iron whip.</p><p>Brandon hurriedly incited his “Own Spirit”. Moving his arm quickly, he clenched his fist and smashed it down, hitting the whipping leg closely.</p><p>Bam! Formless shockwaves raged outwards. Brandon, who had the stature of a bear, agilely wriggled his back muscles. While being in a disadvantaged position, he rebounded by making use of the recoil. Instantly, the distance between the two of them was opened to over ten metres.</p><p>Lou Cheng hid his “Attainment” Formula, pressed ahead, retracted his breathing and blood flow again and did a Force Concentration. With his left fist wearing an “Ice Frost Glove”, he kept it to the side before throwing it ahead. It was an abnormally heavy punch!</p><p>Bam!</p><p>After Brandon had taken a strike, he shifted his right arm and did a Force Concentration again to injure his enemy with ice spirit in the same manner!</p><p>Bam! Bam! Bam! Lou Cheng completed one explosion after another and fell into a rhythm. He was either alternating between his arms or using his leg as a whip or his knees for a strike. Each and every strike was heavy and filled with chilling cold.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Under the pressure of his opponent’s seemingly perfectly measured attacks, Brandon was forced to react with a high intensity explosion. He had lost his advantage in speed. After withstanding ten or more strikes, he finally took a step back. Every step sent dust flying and crushed the floor. Debris flew and dust was raised. It was just like battles between the demigods illustrated in ancient books.</p><p>In this whole process, Brandon could feel that he was getting colder with each strike. The raging blood flow and pumping blood couldn’t neutralize the chill completely and his body was gradually becoming stiff and slow. Moreover, such sensations were getting more and more obvious!</p><p>As compared to the explosive and fearsomeness of Emperor Yan Force, Ice Spirit Force was better at being invasive and the effects lasted longer!</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Lou Cheng used his fist as a hammer and smashed downwards in a slanted manner onto Brandon’s fists which were up as a guard. Upon impact, Brandon staggered back. His hair was wet and the sweat that fell off had all turned into ice frost upon contact on the floor!</p><p>Brandon, who was not willing to let himself be defeated in this way, growled angrily. He could no longer care about the rest. Using a method that would cause him to harm himself, he stimulated his “Own Spirit”, gathered the “light energy” in his body, as he attempted to force open an opportunity for him catch his breath and find a chance to turning the tables around!</p><p>While he was doing his attacking, Lou Cheng seemed to have felt it. He retracted his breathing and blood flow, but did not immediately incite Dan force like he had been. Instead, he stood there while trying to balance something. Temperature and blood seemed to be lost in him as he turned into a cold and chilling corpse. At the same time, the heaviness in his lower abdomen was still compressing and moving away.</p><p>This gave Brandon a chance to gather his momentum. A smile full of anticipation appeared on his face. He lifted his left arm to protect his head and chest and wriggled his right fist before striking out heavily and quickly. All the starlight was gathering at one point in front of him.</p><p>The forbidden move of “Stars”, “Focused Light”!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>At this moment, Lou Cheng’s Dan force also exploded uncontrollably. He was filled with blood and had temperature once again. Pulling his right arm back, he threw his punch out quickly and clashed with the shimmering skin that had directly gathered “Stars”.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The light exploded and shone through the windows of the main hall. Yan Zheke bit into her lips and waited for the figures to appear. The other guests had all forgotten to drink as they were too engrossed in watching the fight.</p><p>The excessive light dissipated quickly as though it was covered or swallowed by something. The figure of Lou Cheng was first to appear. He was far away from his previous position. The sleeve on his right arm was torn and tattered just like a piece of bamboo that had exploded. There was also a little burnt area on his skin with white fog surrounding it.</p><p>Seeing his sorry figure, the guests were about to applaud. However they soon found Brandon stood dazedly on the spot. He was still maintaining the posture of left arm guarding his face while striking with his right arm. From his fingertips to the edge of his hair, they were covered in a layer of shimmering crystal as though he was frozen in it!</p><p>Water droplets dripped down rapidly as the ice layer melted quickly. Lou Cheng regulated his breathing and blood flow, stimulated areas of his body, stomped his legs on the ground, and stood in front of Brandon once again. After stretching his back, he wriggled his arm and smashed his fist down!</p><p>Bam!</p><p>The air barrier exploded. Brandon who had just broken free from the ice struck sluggishly as he attempted to defend. However he was sent flying backwards. Bam! Brandon smashed into the Roman stone pillar and it broke into pieces.</p><p>Lou Cheng pounced ahead and threw a cross punch without a change in his expression. Without pulling back, he headed directly for Brandon’s forehead!</p><p>If Brandon was hit directly like this, even if he was made of metal, his head would have exploded directly!</p><p>He could feel pain from his back and his hands and legs were still sluggish. Brandon could feel the chill between his eyebrows. All he could see was Lou Cheng fist getting bigger and bigger till it took up his entire vision!</p><p>In this instance, he could clearly feel the taste of death. His body couldn’t help but shiver. He wanted to retreat but had no strength to do it.</p><p>Just when he was feeling desolate, another hand extended over. It was emanating in a faint blue colour and stopped Lou Cheng’s fist firmly.</p><p>Referee Polk had finally stepped in! This had also announced the outcome of this battle.</p><p>Brandon had lost and Lou Cheng had won!</p><p>Lou Cheng retracted his fist and clasped it with his palm before bowing in respect. He smiled, turned to his side and walked towards Yan Zheke.</p><p>Phew… Brandon was still sitting among the broken stone pillars as he felt how great it was to be still alive.</p><p>He wasn’t stupid and knew that his opponent final decision of “not pulling back” was just him flaunting his win…</p><p>After entering the banquet hall, Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke looked at each other before saying in unison,</p><p>“Let’s go!”</p><p>If he stayed in Brandon’s banquet after winning against him, he would be clearly asking for trouble! If this was the past, such actions would be the equivalent of asking for a beating!</p><p>When they heard what each other had said, the couple broke into laughter. After which, they held hands and walked towards the main door. No one tried to ask them to stay, and the whole room was silent.</p><p>Outside the door, they were met with a midnight breeze. Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke headed towards the carpark and only left a soft voice speaking in Mandarin,</p><p>“You waited for “Focused Light” on purpose before using that self-created move because you wanted to better experience the uniqueness of the Geruga Sect?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Why do I feel that this style is a little familiar…”</p><p>“I’ve probably been influenced by Priest…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
