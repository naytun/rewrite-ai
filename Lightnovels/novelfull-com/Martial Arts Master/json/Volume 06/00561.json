Get his parents here quickly.”</p><p>I do not have any intention to “play” with him!</p><p>Although it wouldn’t be bad to witness the offspring of the Dark Sect, the location wasn’t appropriate at all!</p><p>“…Alright, I understand.” Xue Jian paused for a while before replying.</p><p>He contacted the security in charge of the Samanno Royal Family first and waited for them to handle it.</p><p>Seeing Lou Cheng was talking in a language he couldn’t understand, Little Prince Sinde’s red eyes turned dull and ripples formed in them. The ripples formed in a repetitive action. This made Lou Cheng felt a little like he was staring at a hanging ball moving left and right or the second hand of a clock that was making the tick-tock sounds. At the same time, he could feel that his mind was going blank, his thoughts were getting blurry and his eyelids were getting heavier as though he had fallen into a dream state.</p><p>“Ancient Scroll of Darkness”, “Primeval Hypnosis”!</p><p>After noticing that Lou Cheng’s gaze had turned slack, Little Prince Sinde couldn’t help but smile. In a low voice, he gave his command,</p><p>“Turn around.”</p><p>Lou Cheng did not move and continue standing there.</p><p>“Turn around!” Little Prince Sinde increased his volume. However, Lou Cheng, who was facing him directly, was as steady as a mountain and did not budge an inch!</p><p>What happened? Little Prince Sinde looked attentively over. What he discovered was that Lou Cheng’s gaze might seem to be not in focus but from deep in his eyes, the Prince could feel that there was something high above looking down calmly and coldly without emotions at him. It was just like those gazes of deities recorded in ancient historical books.</p><p>Suddenly, Sinde shivered in cold and shook his body a little.</p><p>“Have you had enough fun?” Lou Cheng teased.</p><p>“It’s enough…” Little Prince Sinde mumbled.</p><p>Suddenly, he stomped with both of his black leather shoes and pounced out, turning into a blurry shadow and moving to the edge of the corridor at high-speed.</p><p>Although this action was fast, only a soft sound from the friction could be heard. It was just like how a ray of faint light would affect one who was sleeping soundly.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>The air barrier shattered and strong winds were caused. The dull explosion could be heard. Little Prince Sinde’s vision went blurry for a moment before seeing a young teenage guy wearing green loose clothing appearing in front of him. The guy had extended his hand out, signalling for him to stop.</p><p>Thud! He stomped hard on the floor again, liked he was dancing, and changed his direction as he attempted to get over from the other side.</p><p>Another explosion of strong winds sounded. The same person appeared in front of Sinde. He looked as experienced and had the same expression on his face.</p><p>After changing his movements several times and even faked to back away, he wasn’t able to shake the other party off at all. Lou Cheng had always been “fixed” right in front of him.</p><p>Puff, puff, puff… Little Prince Sinde stopped and bent down, panting lightly.</p><p>The supernatural ability that this kid inherited was really powerful. It was just that he was still young and couldn’t really execute it well. When he matured and was given some time, he would likely have the strength close to an inhuman expert. In the far future, it would be hard to determine where he would be… Lou Cheng suddenly understood the reason why everyone from the Sammano Royal Family spoiled him.</p><p>He was so spoilt that he had become an extremely naughty child!</p><p>Although he was polite and child-like, he didn’t care about the wishes of others. Lou Cheng really felt like beating him and showing him what a whooping with a cane felt like…</p><p>Will this cause a diplomatic crisis? Lou Cheng subconsciously looked at the cameras to the left, right and in front of him.</p><p>Little Prince Sinde did not know why but suddenly felt uneasy. Instinctively, he took two steps back.</p><p>He still wasn’t willing to give up. Pushing his palm forward, his pores opened up and shot out crimson red fog from the front.</p><p>They looked so evil and chilling, yet had a faint “aroma”. It had the effects of causing dizziness, corrosion, weakening and blood clotting all in it.</p><p>“Ancient Scroll of Darkness”, “Bloody Fog”!</p><p>These were produced by Sinde after evaporating a limited amount of his own blood and mixing it with the “Darkness Supernatural Ability”.</p><p>When the crimson red fog appeared, it spread quickly to the surrounding area and engulfed Lou Cheng in it. Seeing this, excitement flashed past the eyes of Sinde.</p><p>At this moment, the fog seemed to become heavier and started to solidify. In just a few seconds, they had formed different crystal-clear red snowflakes and descended gradually. It was beautiful and magical.</p><p>Ssk ssk ssk! As the crimson snow covered the floor, the soft sound of a voice could be heard. The crimson snow melted quickly into water, leaving behind obvious trails.</p><p>When the Bloody Fog dissipated, a boy wearing a black tuxedo and a red bow tie was reflected in Lou Cheng eyes. Lou Cheng took a step forward.</p><p>Sinde felt an unknown uneasiness. He staggered back again and asked in a shaky voice,</p><p>“You, what are you thinking of doing?”</p><p>Lou Cheng was simply trying to scare this naughty kid and had no intentions to strike. Just when he was about to speak in a fierce and stone tone, he suddenly noticed someone walking over from the entrance of the corridor.</p><p>“Sister Irina!” Little Prince Sinde shouted exhilaratingly as though he had seen his savior.</p><p>Lou Cheng didn’t turn around as his Ice Mirror had naturally reflected the figure of the incoming person.</p><p>This was a lady wearing an elegant nightgown. She was probably around twenty-three or twenty-four years old and had the symbolic black hair and red eyes of the Samanno Royal Family.</p><p>She had long eyelashes, bright eyes and looked gracious. Her figure was also definitely hot and fully brought out the elegant yet sexy nightgown she was wearing. While she walked, she drew a lot of attention. Despite giving off dangerous vibes, one couldn’t help but feel like getting close to her.</p><p>She’s not an ordinary expert!</p><p>“Princess Irina.” Through the earphones, Xue Jian introduced her to Lou Cheng.</p><p>Nodded his head very slightly, Lou Cheng stepped aside and allowed Little Prince Sinde to run past him to the side of the incoming person.</p><p>“Little Prince went to the wrong washroom.” Lou Cheng explained what happened previously in a serious manner to her.</p><p>“I did not! I just…” As a little gentleman, Sinde’s face was turning red.</p><p>How would I possibly go to the ladies!</p><p>Before Irina replied, Lou Cheng pretended to be talking through the walkie-talkie. He walked away as he talked, left this place and returned to the banquet hall.</p><p>Princess Irina did not say a word all along and was frowning slightly. She scrutinized Lou Cheng with a strange look on her face.</p><p>“Sister Irina, do you know him?” Sinde was only a little more child-like but this didn’t mean that he was stupid. He had sharply noticed the strange behavior of his sister.</p><p>“Perhaps…” Irina retracted her gaze and answered with an unconvincing tone. She mumbled to herself,</p><p>“The feeling of Stars. So familiar…”</p><p>Since Lou Cheng was listed as the Heavenly son of the era in China, various intelligence agencies of major countries had started gathering information of him and listed him as an important target for observation. When he left the University’s martial arts circle and joined the Longhu Club, similar intelligence had been brought to the attention of the higher management of various countries. Many of them saw him as the successor of the Dragon King. As someone who had been involved in the Royal Family affairs for some time, Irina naturally knew a little about him.</p><p>“Is he very powerful?” asked the Little Prince excitedly.</p><p>“…Very powerful.” Irina nodded her head seriously.</p><p>Little Prince Sinde followed and asked curiously, “So is he more powerful or is Sister Irina more powerful?”</p><p>“At least for now, I’m more powerful.” Irina boasted a little at this moment.</p><p>She was at a similar level as Lou Cheng. As to whether if she could defeat him, she would only know through a practical fight…</p><p>Sinde instantly revealed a puzzled look,</p><p>“But he could see through my “Shadowify” but sister Irina you can’t…”</p><p>Irina’s face stiffened and had no reply for that at the moment.</p><p>Should I say that I was lying to you just now or that I have been lying to you all along?</p><p>Her mind turned quickly and she laughed elegantly, “Perhaps his ability happens to be the nemesis of ‘Shadowify’.”</p><p>“So that’s how it is…” Little Prince Sinde believed in what his sister had said easily.</p><p>My stupid brother… The edge of her mouth twitched slightly as she smiled. In her heart, she felt an unexplainable complicated feeling.</p><p>If there are no accidents, Sinde would probably be my husband in the future…</p><p>But in my heart, he will always be just a kid…</p><p>Sigh. A destined bloodline and a destined marriage…</p><p>…</p><p>After returning to the side of Jia Lu, Lou Cheng took out his phone once again and shared his encounter with that naughty kid to Yan Zheke.</p><p>“What took you so long? What did that little Prince do?” Jia Lu couldn’t contain his curiosity and asked.</p><p>“He was playing hide-and-seek.” Lou Cheng answered casually.</p><p>“…” Jia Lu almost couldn’t believe his ears. After some time, he sighed emotionally, “A child from closed marriages is usually either super smart or easily be handicapped…”</p><p>It seemed that this Prince was a moron.</p><p>…</p><p>At night, in the hotel, where the Samanno Royal Family stayed, Lou Cheng and Jia Lu were in the surveillance room. One of them rested while the other paid close attention to the professionals. Once they discovered someone was acting strangely, they would move out immediately.</p><p>In the presidential suite of Irina, she walked back and forth after changing into her lace pyjamas. She seemed to be rather annoyed.</p><p>These were the strong side effects of the mutated “Darkness Bloodline” she had inherited. The members of the Samanno Royal Family would be engulfed with a desire for blood from time to time. It wasn’t the desire to suck or drink blood but the desire to tear flesh apart and allow the warm blood to drip on them. The younger one is and the stronger one is, the stronger the desire.</p><p>Pa pa pa! Irina struck with both of her fists, causing her pillow to sink in from the middle.</p><p>She wasn’t intending to head out to hunt even if it was just against some stray animals. This was because once this was discovered, the image of the Royal Family would be negatively affected. She was in another large country after all.</p><p>After taking two deep breaths, Irina sat down and removed the necklace around her neck. After pulling out the amulet that had fallen between her cleavage, she held it in her palm.</p><p>There seemed to be a sky of stars that had mixed emotions within it, allowing her to calm down.</p><p>After several minutes, she heaved out a sigh, recovered and relaxed her hands.</p><p>That amulet looked fresh from the furnace. It was completely silverish-white in colour and have several pure gems embedded on it. In the middle, a complicated sealed script was engraved on it. It was a script from China:</p><p>“Confrontation!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
