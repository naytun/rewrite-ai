You have hopes to reach Dan stage soon.”</p><p>Mu Huo was shocked for several seconds and asked innocently,</p><p>“You can tell?”</p><p>He had roughly gotten the concept of “withdrawing” after fighting over ten ring matches. Perhaps it was because his “Misfortune” had been too attention grabbing and attracted the majority of the attention. No one actually discovered this point!</p><p>“My foresight has always been pretty good,” answered Lou Cheng composedly.</p><p>Seeing that he didn’t mind giving Mu Yu more recovery time, the referee who was weaker than Lou Cheng didn’t care about it and wasn’t in a hurry to start the battle.</p><p>When an inhuman stage expert fought with Dan stage martial artists at seven or eight pins, he should have enough control to not cause harm or damage to them.</p><p>When Mu Yu heard him, he answered emotionally and with relief,</p><p>“This is all thanks to you.”</p><p>“Why did you say so?” asked Lou Cheng curiously.</p><p>The “comedy” from last year had an instant awakening effect on him?</p><p>Mu Yu forced a smile and answered calmly,</p><p>“Over the last few years, the “Misfortune” ability was too attention grabbing. Not only had it blinded my enemies, but it also blinded me. Although I had been trying to use it only sparingly to prevent the side effects on my surrounding friends, I had always seen it as my greatest trump card in my mind. It is the very core of me and I have strong confidence in it. As a result, most of my energy had been placed on trying to reduce its side effects on the surroundings.”</p><p>“It was when I met you and my ‘Misfortune’ was countered that I understood what was being helpless. It finally woke me up and I have strengthened the training of my body since. Luckily, it isn’t too late and I finally achieved something. However, whether I can achieve Dan Stage is still too early to say. Hehe. That’s funny. My supernatural ability improved because of this and this was totally beyond my expectation…”</p><p>Mu Yu took in a deep breath and refocused his attention to the competition. He clasped his fist in a sign of respect and continued,</p><p>“Although I have no chance of winning, I would still like to seek your guidance.”</p><p>“Please!” Lou Cheng lowered his stance, extend his left hand forward and got into his starting posture. In his heart, he felt a little emotional.</p><p>In just a year, everyone was different now.</p><p>For the following match, Mu Yu didn’t stupidly use “Misfortune”. Although his supernatural ability had benefited from the improvement in his body control and strength, the improvements of his opponent were far more exaggerated.</p><p>The difference between a Heavenly Son of the Era and a martial artist that was just enlightened was wider than several canals!</p><p>In the end, he benefited from Lou Cheng’s cooperation and utilized all he had other than his supernatural ability. He was able to fully demonstrate what he had learnt as he felt as though he had matured and grown stronger under the fist of his opponent.</p><p>After a brilliant period, his performance started to drop. He stopped on his own behalf. Looking at Lou Cheng who wasn’t affected at all by himself, he bowed with the utmost respect and said,</p><p>“Thank you for your guidance.”</p><p>“Thank you too.” Lou Cheng answered with a smile.</p><p>With regards to this, the crowd at the stadium was rather disappointed. They had long taken out their phones with the intention of recording a “comedy”. It’s a shame that Mu Yu knew it himself and didn’t grant them their wishes.</p><p>Lou Cheng left the ring with the claps of the crowd. On the way, he saw Shu Rui who stopped in front of him.</p><p>“Hi, it’s been a long time since we met.” The female reporter who had only one dimple smiled faintly and waved at him.</p><p>“That’s probably because you have changed your job.” Lou Cheng joked.</p><p>Shu Rui was more composed compared to two years ago. Her mouth arched upwards and said, “I have to thank you guys for it.”</p><p>Oh, today’s is Thanksgiving day? Just now it was Mu Yu and now it is Shu Rui? Lou Cheng broke into a laugh and asked curiously,</p><p>“Why is it so?”</p><p>“Didn’t I have an exclusive interview and program with you and the Martial Arts Club? With Lin Que and your name getting more well known, more and more people found these resources. As for me, my looks are fine and had some capabilities. After slowly accumulating some popularity, I was selected by the county satellite TV and was poached by them. In the future, I would probably have fewer and fewer chances of being a frontline reporter. If there’s an invitation for some show, please do me a favour.” Shu Rui had not changed from boasting about her looks.</p><p>Capabilities? Is it the capabilities of creating cold jokes with big brother? Lou Cheng poked fun at her a little. He’s in a good mood and answered,</p><p>“As long as I’m free.”</p><p>Shu Rui nodded her head satisfactorily and became a little gossipy. “I noticed that your girlfriend hasn’t been around for the last two rounds?”</p><p>“Is this an official interview?” Lou Cheng glanced at the cameraman beside Shu Rui.</p><p>“Nope. I have not started filming.” Shu Rui looked at Lou Cheng with a face full of smiles while waiting for his answer.</p><p>“Ke has gone to America for her studies.” Lou Cheng answered it simply.</p><p>“America? Then she should be on winter vacation soon?” Shu Rui’s eyes moved quickly and quickly made mental notes.</p><p>She had considered going for overseas studies and had gathered quite a bit of information. Therefore she knew about this matter.</p><p>“Yeah. Her break starts about one week before Christmas and will last four weeks.” Lou Cheng did not hide the ecstasy he was feeling.</p><p>However when Ke was back, she had to stay with her paternal grandparents for a few days and her maternal grandparents at Jiangnan for a few days after that, accompany her father and mother, and also keep in contact with her close friends. The time they could spend together alone wouldn’t be much. He would be involved in the regional competition after all and she couldn’t possibly keep staying in Songcheng. Yeah, that’s fine. I can visit Xiushan on Monday and return to Songcheng on Friday. I might not be a competent coach but they were used to me not being around after all. Just like how Smith had gotten used to my appearance.</p><p>Just as his thoughts started to drift on this topic, Shu Rui suddenly heaved a sigh. She continued emotionally, “If it isn’t because you are still around, I will also feel that the Songcheng University Martial Arts Club has become so foreign. As compared to this time last year, probably half of the people had left right? Coach Shi, Lin Que… Oh ya, how’re Lin Que’s injuries now? I couldn’t find any information on it on the internet.”</p><p>“He had restorative exercises in August and recovered in November. He should have the standards of a strong sixth pin now.” Lou Cheng answered honestly. This was all the information he had gotten from Ke.</p><p>As an ex-teammate who had fought side by side and a relative in truth, he indeed had called big brother to show concern. However the whole process was very awkward. On his side, he was squeezing his brain to think of topics while on the other side, the answer was just “Mm”, “Yes”, “Right” and other simple terms. This caused Lou Cheng to become less confident in maintaining the conversation and could only hang up quickly.</p><p>With regard to this, Yan Zheke managed to soothe his damages in just a sentence,</p><p>“If my brother is willing to entertain you for a minute and listen to you talk without saying goodbye directly, he already sees you as a friend!”</p><p>After hearing what Lou Cheng had described, Shu Rui smiled, “That’s great. Everyone is getting better and I’m happy about that.”</p><p>Reporter Shu, this doesn’t sound like you. You were a little mainstream… However, this had nothing to do with me… Lou Cheng pointed to where his teammates were and said, “Let’s start the official interview. They are all waiting.”</p><p>“Alright.” Shu Rui changed the topic to the new batch of students that joined the Martial Arts club. “The difference in strength is too distinct. Others could only look up to you and the other few inhumans. However it isn’t that there isn’t any uncertainty. For example in the regional top four round-robin match, you guys would definitely face Shanbei. Are you prepared to fight Peng Leyun before the Nationals?”</p><p>“Uh, it depends.” Lou Cheng didn’t make it definite.</p><p>His improvements had been slow after achieving a breakthrough in Ice Mirror which had brought a great leap forward in his martial arts. When compared with his pace of reaching sixth pin and inhuman stage, his current pace was tortoise like. He almost couldn’t get used to it. At that time, his pace was like a high-speed train.</p><p>Over the last two months, he only had minor improvements. Based on the data available, other than the insane living buddha and warrior sage, most of the inhuman faced similar problems. Therefore the earlier one reached the higher Dan, the more time they had to try to achieve physical invulnerability and the greater their chances for doing so.</p><p>Hmm… It felt like I had not consolidated enough…</p><p>…</p><p>While Shu Rui was having an exclusive interview with Lou Cheng, members of Shannan University had completed a brief after-match interview and had returned to the changing room.</p><p>Lin Xiao carefully stepped into the bathing cubicle and removed her clothes. Taking down all her protection items, she left only the necklace on her neck.</p><p>Turning on the tap, hot water was released. While waiting for the temperature to increase, she felt The Sky Shaking Roar’s pendant that had “Lou Cheng” engraved on it with one hand while holding his other hand forward. She was also mumbling some words.</p><p>When the ceremony ended, the water temperature was just appropriate. She walked below where the water was scattering and feel her body relaxing.</p><p>After worrying for some time, Lin Xiao finished cleaning up without meeting any disaster. Just as she was about to put on her clothes and walk out, she suddenly heard someone slipping from the other side followed by Jin Dali’s scream.</p><p>“What happened?” Lin Xiao raised her voice and asked.</p><p>“Nothing. I just did a split…” answered an annoyed Jin Dali.</p><p>“So pitiful…” Lin Xiao nodded her head bitterly. She covered her mouth and pretended she knew the pain. However after several seconds, she could no longer hold it and laughed out.</p><p>Believe in Lou Cheng, avoid all bad luck!</p><p>Whoever used it would know it!</p><p>……</p><p>After which, Songcheng University had a smooth journey as they continued winning. Under the witness of Yan Zheke, they entered the top four round-robin match. Their very first opponent was the Shanbei University Martial Arts Club.</p><p>On the afternoon of Christmas, Lou Cheng, who was pretending to be a couple with Yan Zheke when they were in fact husband and wife, suddenly felt his phone vibrating. Picking it up and taking a look, it was Priest.</p><p>“Peng Leyun…” Lou Cheng whispered to Ke, who was beside him, before picking up the phone. “Hey, Priest! So free to look for me?”</p><p>Peng Leyun smiled and replied, “I just wanted to tell you that for the next match, I’ll probably not be participating. Let’s fight again in April.”</p><p>“To do consolidation?” asked Lou Cheng as he thought about it.</p><p>“Aren’t you the same?” Peng Leyun answered carefreely.</p><p>After saying, both of them laughed at the same time. It was as though they had some form of chemistry between them.</p><p>Since the end of the four nation competition till now, Peng Leyun had not fought openly. As for Cheng, after the conclusion of two unknown practical battles in America, he had only participated in two guidance matches.</p><p>When he put down the phone and was about to tell Yan Zheke about what happened, he suddenly received another message. It was the contact person, Rapid March, from the military.</p><p>“We have some clues on the ‘Wholeness’ Formula.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
