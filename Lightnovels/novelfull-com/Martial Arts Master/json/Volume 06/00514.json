Lou Cheng jogged in the city. From time to time, he would raise his head and take a look at the cameras that formed a net. He knew that Smith and the other agents were keeping an eye on him.</p><p>Although he could find the devices and could also tell if the camera was facing him, he could not confirm which angles directions they faced. It would be even more impossible for him to find out where Smith and the rest were hiding from reverse sensing.</p><p>This was the difference between martial arts and modern technology.</p><p>There’s nothing in this world that was omnipotent!</p><p>It’s a shame. I was still thinking of knocking at their window and saying “hi” to them, giving them a scare… Lou Cheng imagined the different prank scenarios.</p><p>…</p><p>On the opposite street, Smith had just changed into another vehicle and was drinking his coffee and eating a hamburger. Beside him were specialized agents responsible for staring at the surveillance screens.</p><p>After a while, the brat with thin yellow hair laughed nonchalantly,</p><p>“Boss, the target was just looking at the famous criminals and crimes of Connecticut yesterday morning and the “Butcher” was caught in the afternoon. If it isn’t because you were keeping eyes on him all along, even I would have suspected that he is the “Deliveryman” who went to challenge Joseph and allowed Cole to take advantage of the situation.</p><p>Smith didn’t bat an eyelid and finished off his remaining coffee. He answered with a faint smile, “From the information we have on the target over the last month, he could very likely defeat Joseph but wouldn’t actually be able to subdue him. He might not even be able to deal much damage to him.”</p><p>“This is what I believe as well.” mumbled the brat who was touching his loose hair. “Do you know if there’s strong hair tonic in China?”</p><p>Smith took the opportunity to divert the subject, not showing any signs of remorse.</p><p>He hacked into some company last night and did some “optimization” to the search results. When looking for relevant information about the victim Sunny, the portion about her boyfriend would be placed at the very end. The respective photos had also been doctored or removed for information from the last five years. Most of the people’s memory on this incident had long faded and it would be difficult for them to recall about an insignificant small character in this incident.</p><p>And as long as the relationship between Smith and Sunny was not discovered, the entire incident would be fine.</p><p>The things I have learned diligently over the last five years have finally become useful… Smith crushed the food wrapper in his hand into a ball, pressed down the window and threw it accurately into the trash can outside the car.</p><p>…</p><p>When Lou Cheng stepped into the Msasi Martial Arts Gym, he could feel a heavy and suppressed atmosphere. The coaches and students walking around all wore a serious face. They were either not speaking at all, or were whispering quietly.</p><p>After taking several steps to walk around the corner, he suddenly saw the 2 meters tall Olsen walking towards him. His skin tone was black. He was bald and had a serious and heavy look on him.</p><p>“Hey, little boy. I heard that your fighting skills aren’t bad?” Olsen suddenly opened his mouth and revealed two rows of sparkling white teeth. His smile was natural and not forced.</p><p>Before Lou Cheng could reply, another coach walked past. Olsen immediately shut his mouth and put on a serious and pained expression.</p><p>The legendary “face changing” technique… His relationship with Joseph was very bad… After seeing Olsen walked by, Lou Cheng shook his head with a smile. Picking his phone up, he shared this encounter with Yan Zheke.</p><p>Next, he went into his specialized training ground and saw the red eye girl, Ossie, and the rest of the students.</p><p>Without a doubt, Cole did not come.</p><p>The few of them greeted each other. Suddenly a white student ran in with anxiety and asked, “What happened? Why is there a demonstration party outside that blocked the main door?”</p><p>“Jack, didn’t you see the news?” asked Ossie with a surprised look.</p><p>“So did I miss anything?” Jack opened his hands with a lost look. “I was at a party yesterday night until midnight. After I woke up, I came here straight.”</p><p>“Mr. Joseph, no, Johnny Joseph has been confirmed as the “Butcher” and died because of Cole’s revenge.” Another male student quickly explained. Lou Cheng almost didn’t understand. Luckily he could have easily guessed the situation despite his barely being able to understand English.</p><p>Jack’s jaws dropped and was stunned for sometime before scratching his head and asked,</p><p>“Are you all joking. How can Mr. Joseph be “Butcher”? Even if he is, Cole? Even ten Coles wouldn’t have been enough to finish him off!”</p><p>“That’s because there’s a new superhero call Deliveryman helping him,” answered Ossie with fear and respect.</p><p>Who would have expected Joseph to be a hidden ‘devil’ among us!</p><p>Luckily we didn’t interact much with him. And thankfully Deliveryman pierced through the mask of the Butcher.</p><p>“Really?” Jack took out his phone as he asked. As he looked through the details he heaved a sigh, then let out an exclamation and said a string of words that left Lou Cheng confused.</p><p>Oh my god! Is this true? This is too awesome… After expressing himself intensely, Jack pointed outside and said, “So those people are here to protest Joseph?”</p><p>“No. They are also calling for the boycott of the Geruga and Mission Sects. They claimed that “Animism” is the path of devils and will cause other people to become fallen like Joseph.” answered Ossie anxiously. She was very worried that the Msasi Martial Arts Gym would be affected. “We aren’t the strange guys of the Geruga Sect. Our focus is on fighting techniques!”</p><p>Yeah, as long as the Geruga”Sect is in a mess and too busy to take care of itself, I’ll feel assured… Lou Cheng listened on with a smile.</p><p>The conflict between the Mission Sect and Natural Sect was rather deep…</p><p>Heehee, will the Geruga sect suspect that Deliveryman is from the Mission Sect?</p><p>If so, the Geruga Sect and the Msasi Martial Arts Gym had to cut their ties with Joseph. From now on, at least on the surface, no one would be investigating this incident.</p><p>The few students chatted with worry for a while. A female coach with short blonde hair walked over and said with a heavy tone,</p><p>“Lin Deluo had to cooperate with the police investigation. I hope that he isn’t involved in the past cases of the Butcher. Your lessons for the next few days will be taken over by me. Please address me as Madam Annie.”</p><p>Calling him the Butcher directly, they really cut their ties quickly… Lou Cheng felt relief. He continued practicing his fighting techniques with Annie and when sparring, he used “Ice Mirror” to control his body to resist the temptation to revert to his usual selection of martial arts moves. He kept it simple with punches, wrestling and judo related moves.</p><p>This also allowed him to experience something new and to re-examine his instinctive reactions in his past battles and improve himself from the analysis.</p><p>Although she was wary, Annie had already awakened her “Own Spirit”. She wasn’t bad in the corresponding training for the spirit and remained composed for the entirety. After completing the content of awakening teaching, Lou Cheng had new understanding again.</p><p>When the lessons ended, Lou Cheng washed up, changed his clothes, grabbed his bag, and left the Msasi Martial Arts Gym without turning back. He went to have lunch with Yan Zheke and chatted over how the incident of the Butcher was developing in the school.</p><p>After Yan Zheke went for lessons, he bought a bottle of water and went towards the China Dragon Punch Dojo. It was near and only took him about five minutes.</p><p>…</p><p>After leaving the Msasi Martial Arts Gym, Jack invited Ossie and some of his closer classmates to have lunch at the room he rented. He even ordered pizzas, chicken wings and other food specifically for them.</p><p>When they gathered, the topic of discussion was about the Butcher and Deliveryman. They were getting more and more excited from their discussions and made various conjectures.</p><p>At this moment, the doorbell rang and resonated throughout the room.</p><p>“Who’s that?” asked Ossie sub-consciously.</p><p>Jack stood up, walked towards the door, and said casually,</p><p>“Delivery is here…”</p><p>When he said “delivery”, it was as though a spell was cast on him as he stood frozen to the ground for a while. The discussion in the room abruptly halted.</p><p>“Could it really be Deliveryman?” Jack swallowed his saliva and forced a smile.</p><p>As he spoke, his actions now seemed more cautious. After making multiple confirmations and going through a tumultuous mental struggle, he finally got his pizzas, chicken wings and other food.</p><p>“An ordinary delivery man” Jack turned around, shrugged his shoulders and said.</p><p>The group initially felt relaxed followed by disappointment.</p><p>Such scenarios were also happening in various places throughout Connecticut. It was especially so among the kids who were filled with imagination.</p><p>…</p><p>After Lou Cheng arrived at the China Dragon Punch Dojo, he had a short break at the front desk before seeing that white and skinny teenager Li Zunping again.</p><p>“Is the dojo master here?” asked Lou Cheng excitedly.</p><p>Li Zunping answered with a smile, “He’s here and is currently demonstrating the moves. If you had come an hour later, he would have left.”</p><p>“Lucky lucky.” Lou Cheng nodded his head and followed Li Zunping into the training grounds. He saw layers of people surrounding the front. There were people of all races watching.</p><p>“Take a good look. If you register with us, there would be plenty of such opportunities.” Li Zunping extended his hand from the side and attempted to pat on Lou Cheng’s shoulders. However, Lou Cheng happened to side step causing his actions to fail.</p><p>At this moment, Lou Cheng pulled his tendons and wriggled his muscles. Those who contacted him would feel like they have touched a mudskipper as they stepped aside and allowing him to “squeeze” to the front row.</p><p>In the middle of the ground, a Chinese man of approximately fifty years old was demonstrating a set of moves slowly. Every punch and kick was solid and natural and seemed rather profound.</p><p>Obviously, this was only a relative concept. Lou Cheng was a bit shocked from what he had seen. He couldn’t believe that this was the legendary dojo master Zhu.</p><p>He’s very average!</p><p>Zhu Hong had some white hairs and looked like someone who had a lot of experience. His looks were not bad and felt just like a grandmaster in martial arts. After demonstrating for a while, he steadied his legs, got into his stance and ask several students to attempt to push him.</p><p>Before Lou Cheng could react, four strong hunks had entered the ground. There were white and black men. After which, two more interested students joined them.</p><p>They lined up in a row as though they were taking part in a tug-of-war competition. The guys at the back were pushing the one in front and finally onto the palms of Zhu Hong.</p><p>Yiii Yaaaa!</p><p>The 6 hunks expended all their strength but still couldn’t move the seemingly skinny dojo master, inviting excited cheers from other students.</p><p>As for Lou Cheng, his jaws dropped in disbelief.</p><p>From the changes at the waist to their legs, only the two guys at the end actually exerted strength. Not only did the other four not help, but they even dissipated part of their strength.</p><p>He is a scammer, right? Lou Cheng’s mouth twitched.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
