They patted on the shoulders of Lou Cheng and walked past him towards the location of the lift so as to not disturbed him.</p><p>“Hello.” Lou Cheng locked his phone screen and nodded his head with a faint smile.</p><p>“Hello, my surname is Zhang. I’m here today mainly to discuss the terms and conditions and our future arrangements for you. If you feel that there aren’t any issues, and we will be sending a contract to you over the next few days.” Mr Zhang pointed to the cafeteria at the side before continuing, “Let find a seat before we discuss further.”</p><p>“Alright.” Lou Cheng didn’t reject him.</p><p>After ordering their own drinks, Mr Zhang crossed his fingers, placed it in front of him and continued with a large smile,</p><p>“From your reaction, I guess that you are really not going to return to the Wuyue Club. In that case, I feel more assured now. The preliminary intention of the Longhu Club is to offer you a contract lasting five years. The salary for each year would be ten million dollars.”</p><p>“Ten million dollars?” Lou Cheng was rather surprised.</p><p>Based on what was disclosed online, typical salaries of senior fourth-pin experts were around six to seven million dollars. In foreign countries, martial artists of the same level were roughly the same.</p><p>Considering the currency of China, it was still worth it!</p><p>Mister Zhang smiled and continued, “Dragon King suggested to treat you as a quasi-physical invulnerability expert. This will only be the salary and not inclusive of prize money, benefits and other income. If you have no further objections, I will be going on to talk about the subsequent terms?”</p><p>“I’m very satisfied.” Lou Cheng smiled and replied and didn’t haggle about the salary.</p><p>This was much better than he had expected. Moreover, Dragon King had fought for such terms for him. If he was to ask for more, he would be too greedy!</p><p>Mister Zhang lifted his black coffee and drank a mouthful. After adjusting his spectacles, he continued, “The main source of the bonus will be from winning. For every match you win, there will be a bonus between a hundred thousand to two hundred thousand depending on the importance of the match. In addition, there will also be a bonus based on the final ranking in the club…”</p><p>He summarized and briefly mentioned about the important terms. After which, he concluded, “The benefits will mainly be income from related properties. If you aren’t at physical invulnerability, you might not get a lot. When you have made the great leap, the annual salary and bonus will really just be loose change. Of course, if you wish to get more, you can do missions for the club. However, this isn’t compulsory.”</p><p>“I’m okay with the main terms. At that time, I will get a lawyer to look through it in more details.” Lou Cheng nodded his head to show approval.</p><p>“Sure, that’s definitely fine.” Mister Zhang smiled and elaborated on other terms and conditions. When he had a preliminary agreement with Lou Cheng, he then moved on to the subsequent arrangement. “Is there a problem for you to report before July?”</p><p>“Nope,” Lou Cheng shook his head in reply.</p><p>“With your current level and strength, it would barely be enough to participate in professional competitions. It would also be rather risky. We will be giving you some time to digest the Dan stage unique skills of the Fire Sect. After which, we will register you for the preliminaries of the “Battle of the Kings” in August. Subsequently, there would be similar arrangements to allow you to have a high-level battle each week…”</p><p>“If you are agreeable, we will be sending you to teams we are on good terms with to experience professional competition at the second or third level in February to March next year…”</p><p>“If you suffer grave injuries or illness, the club will be responsible for the first three months. After which, the insurance companies will be in charge. You can rest assured… To sum it up, all these are targeted for you to make the great leap within three years and reach physical invulnerability! Oh ya, I have forgotten to mention this previously. We will have the first rights for re-contract and can also terminate the contract in lieu of compensation.” Mister Zhang used his hands to emphasized his tone to express confidence in Lou Cheng.</p><p>The four levels of professional competitions in China would start at the end of February or early March each year and would end around December to January. Between which, there would be two major breaks to allow the Five Supreme National Title competitions to be held.</p><p>And among the Five Supreme National Title Competitions, the “Battle of the Kings” had its preliminaries in the middle of August to the beginning of September. The elimination rounds would start two weeks before December to determine the challenger for the previous champion. There would be a best of three series the following year around March to April to decide on the new King.</p><p>“Warrior Sage”, “Supreme Class”, “Master” and “Kirin”, the other four title competitions, all had similar arrangements. They were inserted between the professional league competitions and each had different rules. For example, “Supreme Class” was about determining the top three through elimination rounds. After which, a four-man round robin competition would be formed with the previous champion where they faced one another once. The one with the best results would receive the title. If there’s a draw, additional matches would be added.</p><p>Lou Cheng asked about the details in several segments and expressed his personal views. After which, the preliminary discussion had ended on good terms. Mister Zhang finished up his black coffee before extending his hand with a face full of smiles,</p><p>“In that case, I will be drafting the contract when I get back. Let me congratulate you in advance for joining the Longhu Club.”</p><p>“We will be a family from now on.” Lou Cheng extended his hand, held on the other party and shook lightly.</p><p>“Goodbye and have a good rest.” Mister Zhang waved his hands and left with a happy face.</p><p>After seeing his back view disappearing from the door of the cafeteria, Lou Cheng sat down again. Looking at the dimly lighted environment and listening to the joyful music resonating, he drank a mouthful of sour lemon drink. Suddenly he realised that he had come to the end of a segment in his life journey and would be starting on a new adventure.</p><p>He had always been clear about it. After the Nationals and completing his third year in university, he would be leaving the school and entering the society. However knowing clearly about it and clearly feeling it were two completely different concepts. When he was so close to it, the footsteps of his future was getting louder and louder to him.</p><p>He was full of anticipation but also felt a little emotional about it.</p><p>He was going to leave the Martial Arts Club and the relatively simple school to enter the adult world. What would the world of Martial Arts be like?</p><p>He wouldn’t be able to visit America so frequently after July, not to mention staying there for ten days to half a month. Perhaps he would only be able to visit that place once every two to three months and could only stay for three to five days…</p><p>Lin Que was right to say that the rash and brazen teenage days would end once one starts maturing…</p><p>The melody of the music entered his ears and Lou Cheng, who was wearing a black t-shirt, continued sitting there for a long time. Holding on to his cup, he did not move for some time. It was as though he had turned into the shadows under the sunset light.</p><p>Two days later, he watched the finals between Shanbei and the Capital. Ren Li fully demonstrated the Kong Dong Swordsmanship that had the unique skills of the Wind Sect as core and Hidden Scent as supplementary. She was able to win in a tight contest with Peng Leyun, whose body was still affected by the intense battle previously and who wasn’t in tip-top condition. As for Fang Zhirong, he had not recovered from his internal injuries and was further injured by Ren Li. In the end, he lost to Jiang Kongchan. However he did not make it easy for his opponent. The effects of Dark Poison Force greatly decreased the strength of Jiang Kongchan, causing him to be unable to win in his second match and sealed the victory.</p><p>In the end, the unknown Jiang Jingfeng won against Bernhard and gave a perfect ending for the hard work Capital had put in over the last few years.</p><p>As for the future batches, Peng Leyun, Ren Li, Jiang Jingfeng, Xing Jinjin, Pu Yuan and many others would be graduating. Lou Cheng, Li Xiaoyuan, Fang Zhirong would be entering the professional competitions in advance. The University Martial Arts circle would fall back to the standards of two years ago. For the foreseeable future, there wouldn’t be such glorious and radiant scenes.</p><p>The bald He Xiaowei commented,</p><p>“The Golden Era of University Martial Arts circle has officially ended!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
