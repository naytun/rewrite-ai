Picking it up and taking a look, it was actually a typhoon warning in the City of Forests. For the next few days, the catastrophe would be hitting the land.</p><p>I heard that this would happen a few times in the year in the South-eastern region along the coastal areas. Lou Cheng thought to himself and started to consider where he should go for his daily morning practice with the heavy rain and strong winds.</p><p>Should I move into this place in advance? Using the chopsticks in his hands, he tore open a small opening in the crab roe dumpling and allowed the soup to leak out slowly. After filling his plate, he took a picture and sent it to Yan Zheke together with a [Scheming Smile expression].</p><p>After returning from the university town last night, he had chatted with his wife according to his plans. After which, he called his mother, chatted with Talker on QQ, played several games and read a novel. The next day morning, he woke up on time and started his training diligently. His focus was on the technique of the Fire Sect’s hundred and thirteenth move, Scorch. At eight fifteen, he met up with Lu Shaofei, Yu Wangyuan and the rest and arrived at the club in the car to have breakfast from all over the world in the restaurant</p><p>“I want to eat! [Teary eyes and biting on handkerchief expression]” replied Yan Zheke.</p><p>“Who was the one showing off about her sumptuous meal when I just completed my morning practice! [Laughing sneakily expression]” said Lou Cheng.</p><p>It was summer vacation at Connecticut University and it was also close to the end of her trying to catch up on the progress of her homework after submitting her report. Her parents had also flown to America and were intending to bring her along for a holiday before returning two weeks later. At that time, her maternal and paternal grandparents would also fly back for a family reunion.</p><p>As the weather was hot in the summer and not suitable for going out, coupled with the fact that he did not know a lot about the City of Flowers, Lou Cheng had suggested to Yan Zheke that they should purchase the house during the last part of winter. As for summer, visiting the shopping malls, having meals at traditional restaurants and lazily enjoying the air-conditioning in their house was the most satisfying part of life!</p><p>Moreover, the salary from the Longhu Club was disbursed on a monthly basis. He would receive eight hundred thousand each month and the shortfall would be disbursed to him at one go at the end of the year. If he wished to pay for the house in full, he still had to continue working hard to earn the money for some time.</p><p>Lou Cheng was busy with drinking his soup and stuffing the skin of the dumpling into his mouth as Yan Zheke replied sorrowfully, “I’m the type that gets hungry quickly. Is it not alright!”</p><p>“It’s alright! When you come to the City of Flowers, I’ll bring you to all the restaurants in the club! Family members receive a discount!” Lou Cheng typed happily and suddenly felt someone was approaching.</p><p>He raised his head and saw Auman, who was wearing a round-neck white blouse walking to him. She asked with a smile, “Mr Lou, how was the Xing Province food yesterday?”</p><p>“Not bad, it was very traditional and not modified by the locals. However there were a few dishes that don’t go so well with my preferences. They are still areas they can tweak slightly. For example, that sour beef soup…” Lou Cheng expressed his honest opinion and wasn’t intending to be humble with his opinions.</p><p>He might be eating the dishes from the same chef for the next few years. Although he might be able to just endure it this time, he would not be able to continue to do so for the next few years!</p><p>Auman took out the pen and paper in her hand carrier and started recording seriously. In the end, she smiled, “I will convey these to the chef directly.”</p><p>She emphasized the words “directly” to indicate that she was paying attention.</p><p>Lou Cheng nodded his head with a faint smile. Recalling the question from before, he changed the topic and asked, “Isn’t there a report that there would be a typhoon in the next few days? The training grounds of Sky Capital Garden are all semi-open and will not shelter me from the rain. Where should I go for my morning practice?”</p><p>Auman quickly replied, “There’s a small scale indoor training ground in the activity centre of the Sky Capital Garden. Mr Lou, if you can give me a confirmation, I will inform them in advance and get the key. At that time, you can go whenever you want.”</p><p>She was only afraid that Lou Cheng had no requests. This was because she wouldn’t be able to showcase her ability. She couldn’t wait to go to the property at Sky Capital Garden right away!</p><p>“Alright, thank you.” Lou Cheng heaved a sigh of relief and nodded his head sincerely.</p><p>“There’s no need for thanking me. This is what I do!” Auman was exhilarated as her face basked in radiance.</p><p>Seeing that Lou Cheng’s gaze had turned to the steamer basket, she quickly understood and said, “In that case, I shall not disturb your meal. Let me go and coordinate the martial arts training ground.”</p><p>After taking a few small steps back, she turned around slowly. With a bright smile on her face, she walked out of the main door. It was only when she saw the upset Huang Bin that she pulled back her smile, lifted her head and walked out in an imposing manner.</p><p>She finally understood that she shouldn’t keep giving in and be a nice person in her job. Although she should still be kind in the way she treated others, she should still fight for things that she had to. Otherwise, not only will these people step on you, but they would also mock you!</p><p>Huang Bin had been on the Assistant team for several years. Although he really wanted to go up and chat with Lou Cheng right away and asked if the chauffeur yesterday was fine, his ample experiences were telling him that he would only irk Lou Cheng considering that Auman had just “disturbed” him. If this was so, his actions wouldn’t be meaningful.</p><p>Gritting his teeth secretly, he left the restaurant.</p><p>Lou Cheng did not notice the contest of the two at all. He was enjoying his breakfast while chatting happily with his little fairy girl.</p><p>Ten minutes past nine, he left the restaurants and entered the Dan stage training room to continue his deciphering of the unique skills and practice. Fifteen minutes past ten o’clock, he returned to his personal resting room and had a video conference with Yan Zheke. At twelve thirty, he went to the restaurant again and happened to see Tu Zheng walking out from it.</p><p>“There’s a gathering tonight and I have made the reservation for a room. We are moving out at six thirty. Are you okay with it?” Tu Zheng said with a gentle and sincere smile.</p><p>“Sure.” Lou Cheng had nothing to do that night anyway and agreed to it decisively.</p><p>After which, as he was excited from being in contact with new powerful martial arts, he did not take an afternoon nap and spent his entire afternoon in the training room and training ground.</p><p>Bam! His fist struck the void in front of him, causing crimson red flames which had a hidden shade of gold.</p><p>Lou Cheng nodded his head approvingly and relaxed his stance.</p><p>He finally managed to gain some mastery over the “Fire” Sect’s hundred and thirteenth move, Scorch. Moreover, all things were difficult before becoming easier. The progress of the remaining twenty over unique skills should be quicker than his. Hmph, excluding those that were the most difficult…</p><p>Whish~ The warm water showered down and washed away the fatigue from his body. Lou Cheng changed to his clothes, carried his sling bag and went over to the training ground of the reserve team in the North-west region to meet up with Yu Yuanwang and the rest. “I have informed the Assistant team and there would be a car sending you guys over. I’ll be taking Jianlin and Jia Lu with me.,” said Tu Zheng as he waved his hands.</p><p>No one spoke a word during the journey and the six inhumans of the reserve team soon arrived in a club with elaborate and luxurious decorations.</p><p>When they pushed open the door to the reserved room, Lou Cheng, Lu Shaofei and the rest were all shocked. This was because there was already another person sitting inside. He was the first pin expert, who was huge, bald and with a pair of fierce-looking eyebrows, “Optimus Prime” Long Zhen.</p><p>As compared to seeing him in the meeting room the previous day, the current Long Zhen had not released his aura. Nonetheless, the rest felt uneasy. It was as though they were animals who had encountered their natural nemesis or a group of weak people seeing the boss of a mafia.</p><p>As for Long Zhen, he didn’t mind the astonishment of Jia Lu and the rest. He cut off the edge of the cigar carefreely and turned it slowly above the flame.</p><p>“Uncle Long has been giving me a lot of guidance since I’ve been on the reserve team. He could be considered as half my Master.” Tu Zheng explained with a smile. “When he heard that I am throwing a welcome party for Lou Cheng, he immediately said he wanted to come and join in. There aren’t many physical invulnerability experts who don’t put out an air like him!”</p><p>That’s not true. Among those physical invulnerability experts that I have seen, those that put out air are definitely the minority… Perhaps they just can’t be bothered to do it in front of me? Lou Cheng mocked himself. He clasped his right fist onto his left palm and greeted him.</p><p>Lu Shaofei and the rest quickly recovered their senses, kept their astonishment in check and greet, “Good evening Uncle Long!”</p><p>“Take a seat.” Long Zhen had a bright smile on his face and pointed to the cigar box at the side. He asked Lou Cheng, “Want a stick?”</p><p>Although he wasn’t showing any of his awe, he made one feel that they couldn’t reject him. Who could reject the good intentions of a one-pin expert?</p><p>“I’m fine. I don’t smoke.,” Lou Cheng heaved and smiled.</p><p>“What are you afraid of? You are no longer at the body refining stage where you are consolidating your foundation.” Long Zhen take a puff from the cigar before exhaling slowly.</p><p>Not waiting for Lou Cheng to reply, he continued with a casual laugh, “Your Ice Mirror should have reached the level of Encountering Gods In The Void, Self Reflection?”</p><p>When Long Zhen said this, Lu Shaofei and the rest were all shocked. Physical invulnerability experts might not feel that this was something impressive but for the inhumans, this was something that they might not be able to reach. Among all the fourth-pin experts in the room, no one had achieved it other than Tu Zheng!</p><p>He had just reached the inhuman stage a year ago, right?</p><p>He’s indeed a Heavenly son of the era…</p><p>This was something that only can be discovered after specifically watching and researching into my competition videos. Moreover one had to put in a lot of hard work to decipher it… Long Zhen the first-pin expert clearly wouldn’t be so bored. Who could it be… Lou Cheng took a look at Tu Zheng beside him and thought to himself.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Isn’t that fine then? At this stage, controlling your body, removing the impurities, and cleaning your lungs would only take you the effort of flipping your hand. Why are you still afraid of smoking?” continued Long Zhen in a seemingly laughing tone.</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed mockingly at himself and answered resolutely, “I really don’t like it.”</p><p>Long Zhen did not continue on this and asked Yu Yuanwang and the other guys the same question. No one rejected him. In just a while, the whole room was covered in smoke as though they were in a divine realm.</p><p>Lou Cheng was fine with this. His lungs were so strong that they could cleanse themselves. Not smoking them directly was only a matter of principle and his attitude towards the subject.</p><p>When the appetiser was served, Tu Zheng smiled, “I have brought some great alcohol. Come and choose what you want to drink.”</p><p>After Lu Shaofei and the rest made their choices, Lou Cheng waved his hands and answered embarrassingly, “I don’t drink alcohol.”</p><p>“You don’t drink alcohol? Which hero from ancient times didn’t drink?” sneered Long Zhen.</p><p>Lou Cheng shook his head and continued, “I’m used to it and there’s no point for me to break the routine. Moreover, as compared to alcohol, I’m more fond of other tastes.”</p><p>“You are really boring.” Long Zhen did not make it hard for him and continued, “If you are in other professions, would you dare to not drink if your leader stares at you?”</p><p>“The reason why I have been training diligently is probably because I will like to have the right to say no.” Lou Cheng imitated his tone from before and said in a very natural way.</p><p>Long Zhen nodded his head slowly, “These words are really apt…”</p><p>Garoupa, abalone and other dishes were served one after another as the banquet started. Tu Zheng actively found common topics and Long Zhen shared the incidents that had happened when he was still on the reserve team from time to time. Overall, it was considered a success.</p><p>Long Zhen did not stay around for long after the dinner and said that he was headed to other clubs to relax. As for Lou Cheng and the rest, they went to the KTV at the third floor to sing after Tu Zheng invited them.</p><p>After Lu Shaofei and Jia Lu played for a while and left, Tu Zheng finally revealed a smile and went out for a few minutes.</p><p>Shortly after he returned, the door opened and over ten girls came in and stood in front of the TV in a row. All of them were young, beautiful and alluring. They were of various shapes and each had their own charisma.</p><p>“The qualities are all great. You guys can go and choose first.” Tu Zheng leaned back relaxingly and stretched his arms across the back of the sofa.</p><p>“I don’t need to.” Lou Cheng quickly answered.</p><p>“What are you afraid of? There’s nothing wrong for men to have a little fun.” laughed Tu Zheng.</p><p>Seeing that Yu Yuanwang and Sun Jianlin had started choosing, Lou Cheng took a deep breath, stood up and said, “I have something to do and will be going off first. Have fun!”</p><p>After saying, he exchanged gazes with Tu Zheng but did not show any panic. He was calm and composed.</p><p>“You can go if you have something to do.” Tu Zheng said slowly.</p><p>Lou Cheng nodded his head to express his gratitude before turning around and leaving.</p><p>When he left, Sun Jianlin started drinking with his female partner as though nothing had happened. He laughed, “Captain Tu, you’re rushing things a little. We aren’t that close to him yet and he is just a child who has just come from school.”</p><p>“That’s true but I can tell that Lou Cheng is someone with a very determined will. He is a martial artist that is used to restraining himself.,” Yu Yuanwang heaved a sigh of relief and held two female partners in his arms.</p><p>Two ladies were sitting to each side of Tu Zheng. Tu Zheng’s eyes were half opened and he did not say a word.</p><p>…</p><p>The third of July, Friday afternoon, Lou Cheng was having lunch when Yu Yuanwang leaned over. He said with a faint smile, “There’s a weekly sparring session among the reserve team in the afternoon. Do you want to participate?”</p><p>Lou Cheng, who had just mastered another unique skill of the Fire Sect was itching for a fight. He immediately nodded his head and said,</p><p>“Sure.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
