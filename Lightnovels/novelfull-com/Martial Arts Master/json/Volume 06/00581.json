Solving it through the cultivation technique of Cultivation was one of the possible shortcuts. Now that there was a glimmer of hope, it was hard for him not to be excited!</p><p>Moreover, this could possibly solve Ke’s and his master’s issues at the same time!</p><p>“Yeah. Ge Hui might not have had the intention to kill you initially, and might have even intended to return to the Samanno Royal Family. Therefore, he had not brought many of his important items with him. Instead, he hid them in a well-hidden place in his room.” The military personnel answered with his own conjecture. “We have made several copies and have sent them to your master and Queen of Thoughts. I have also brought a copy for you.</p><p>“Thank you, thank you.” Lou Cheng couldn’t hide his smile.</p><p>After several minutes, he received Ge Hui’s practice notebook, a list of books he read and other information that was sorted out according to relevance to the techniques of Cultivation. Although these weren’t complete, he was still able to clearly understand some of it after combining them with the incomplete set he had previously obtained.</p><p>For example, Cultivators believed that there were souls that broke free from the material world and the mind was an extension of it. Therefore, from the beginning of body refining, they had greatly strengthened their training in this aspect and treated the training of the body as secondary content. The purpose of a strong body was to support a healthy and clear mind.</p><p>Throughout this process, the Confrontation Formula was an overview of everything. As for the practice of the entire set of the Nine Words Formulas, they were an extremely effective set of skills that could be used to increase one’s mental strength.</p><p>When the mind could sense its surroundings, it would have moved into a new level. Cultivators would then use these skills to nourish their bodies and achieve well rounded improvements. After which, they would refine corresponding medicinal pills for consumption. These pills acted as catalysts during training for minor mutations and used the mind as a lead. The initial effects would be similar to Lou Cheng achieving his first awakening of supernatural ability. The final aim was to reach a stage similar to him achieving the second awakening.</p><p>At this stage, Cultivators would face their greatest hurdle which was to use his mind as a lever and their supernatural ability as a form of energy for propulsion to combine with the soul, which they claimed was mysterious, to form a Jindan that was in between illusion and reality.</p><p>Once the Jindan was formed, Cultivators would have various kinds of unbelievable achievements. They could connect with nature, change reality and move internal energy within their body without the use of complicated hand seals, making the use of natural energy seem even more magical.</p><p>Speaking of its origin, once the Jindan gradually grew stronger, the body of the Cultivator would grow stronger once again. Their overall battle strength would start to be at a level similar to a physical invulnerability expert. Each had their own unique characteristics and advantages.</p><p>As to what would happen subsequently, Ge Hui did not talk about it at all or have any records. As for the entire set of cultivation techniques, they were only be passed down verbally.</p><p>On a separate note, the notebook also briefly mentioned that when Ge Hui was forming his Jindan, he got into some trouble because his senior passed away and he lacked proper guidance and assistance. Over the years, he was unable to improve, and he had been actively looking for his own kind. In other words, he was looking for other branches of Cultivation and attempted to learn from them by finding similarities between what they learned. However, it’s a shame that he wasn’t able to find anyone all along.</p><p>The mind nourishing the body… This might just be able to solve Ke’s congenital deficiencies. The thought flashed passed Lou Cheng’s mind and his mouth subconsciously arc upwards. This was the first time he really smiled without hiding his sorrows.</p><p>Ke’s current body-refining had already reached its limits and was currently stuck at a bottleneck. To first increase one’s mental strength through techniques of Cultivation and then to nourish the body with the mind. This might just be a plausible route!</p><p>Master’s old injuries and my sequela might just be able to be resolved through this!</p><p>If it still isn’t enough, wait till I have gathered the full Nine Words Formulas. I can rely on them to resonate with the Cultivation. In this case, the chances of triggering the Longhu Immortal’s Jindan should be higher. Once I obtain the full set of cultivation techniques, I should be able to slowly digest the Jindan and absorb it!</p><p>The world’s greatest sorrows would be to have no hope. After experiencing a glimmer of hope, Lou Cheng’s mood got substantially better. Even when he experienced another set of chills and scorching heat, he wasn’t discouraged by it.</p><p>Speaking of which, I have been imitating the Longhu Immortal to balance and rotate so i could form my “Dan”. This is already different from the ordinary path of martial arts. As to how am I going to attain the physical invulnerability stage in the future, I have always had some doubts about it. It seems to be that if I rely on the proven method provided by my predecessors, I wouldn’t be able to achieve it. This is just the right time. I’m currently at the lowest point in my life, and I happened to obtain the core elements of the cultivation technique of Cultivation. I should remain calm and compose myself, combine elements from the two schools, and find my own unique path… Once Lou Cheng got his mind set, he was filled with ambition again.</p><p>Obviously, he also clearly knew that this would be the best case scenario for his life. The reality might not be as perfect but without giving it a try, he would never know if it would work.</p><p>To do your best and then to hope for the best!</p><p>At the thought of this, he took out his phone and gave a call to his master first.</p><p>“Hey brat, have you seen Ge Hui’s techniques of Cultivation?” Geezer Shi drank a mouthful of alcohol and asked.</p><p>The military had not found anything from their research. However, he would still be the first person the military would update!</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed heartily and said, “Yeah, I saw them. Moreover, I have corroborated them with the incomplete set that I obtained from the Jindan of the Immortal Longhu. Master, that portion about the mind nourishing the body, your disciple believed that it would have some effects on you.”</p><p>“Brat, do you think your master is blind? The salt I have eaten is more than the rice you have had! That’s the first thing I noticed when I got my hands on the information. Will I still need you to remind me of it?” Shi Jiangui answered rudely.</p><p>Aren’t I just trying to show respect to you, master? Lou Cheng’s mouth twitched, and he didn’t know how to reply in the moment.</p><p>Geezer Shi coughed twice before continuing, “I have seen it. If I am to just use this technique alone, the effects will not be great. The thing about Cultivation is that the initial phases are connected to the back. I have to start from the initial phase of training the mind first and allow my body and mind to be synchronized to build a strong foundation for the subsequent nourishment of my body through my mind. Hey brat, don’t forget to send the incomplete information from the Longhu Immortal to my inbox later.”</p><p>“Yes, master.” Lou Cheng felt with warmth streaming in his heart.</p><p>After hanging up the phone, he sent a message to Yan Zheke and told her about getting the core elements of the cultivation technique of Cultivation. In the end, he said, “I think I’ll be coming to Connecticut in a few days for two months and wait for your winter break to arrive. If I keep staying at home, it will just be a matter of time until my parents find this strange. Moreover, we can research and discuss the topic of mind and body together.”</p><p>At the same time, it is to avoid those wolves and tiger-like reporters!</p><p>“I can’t wait! [Sitting upright with enthusiasm expression]” replied Yan Zheke.</p><p>Before Lou Cheng replied, she heaved a sigh and added, “[Cover face in embarrassment expression] It’s over. The pure me has been completely corrupted by you… Although I know that you are referring to Cultivation, the first thing that came to my mind when I saw ‘mind and body’ is ‘soul and body’…”</p><p>Seeing the hopes that Lou Cheng might be recovering soon, her mood suddenly got better.</p><p>“Cough, I could have meant both interpretations with my words.” Lou Cheng seemed to have awakened from the winter slumber and was no longer feeling so emotional. He was much more lively and dynamic!</p><p>“Tsk. You better rest well for now. Let’s talk about it when you can start practicing again!” Yan Zheke emphasized.</p><p>Lou Cheng replied, “[Bowing with both hands raised expression] Yes, Coach Yan!”</p><p>…</p><p>Three days later, the flight that took off from Gaofen finally landed in Orion Airport in Connecticut. Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke held hands as they walked towards the car park where Aunt Du was waiting.</p><p>While walking, Yan Zheke constantly looked for any changes in the condition of her husband. Once she noticed that he was having chills or a scorch attack, she would immediately stop, tilt her head and pretended to be talking to him. This was to make it hard for others to tell that there was something wrong and to avoid unnecessary attention.</p><p>This level of understanding chased away all worries Lou Cheng had and made him feel warmth in his heart.</p><p>“I have gotten used to it, and it isn’t as unbearable as before. Even if the path of Cultivation is ineffective, perhaps I might become immune to it…” joked Lou Cheng.</p><p>Yan Zheke was shocked for a moment before scolding, “Don’t say this so casually!”</p><p>Don’t curse yourself!</p><p>She quickly added, “Pui pui, pui. Childish rhetoric, he doesn’t mean it!”</p><p>Ke seems to be more worried than me… Lou Cheng who was still able to make fun of himself decided to not do so again in the future.</p><p>After taking several breaks between walks, the couple finally saw Aunt Du and got on the car.</p><p>At this point, Lou Cheng received a phone message from “Fallen Spiderman”, Smith, “It’s been a few months since we met and I actually have missed you a little. There have been active rumours online about your injuries. It seems like you are alright?”</p><p>“I’m recovering better than expected. However it’s still at least two months time before I can hope to get back to fighting.,” Lou Cheng answered honestly.</p><p>“Perfect! On a side note, congratulations! Your danger grade assessment has been lowered temporarily. Currently you would not be required to be under supervision for twenty-four hours a day. However, I will still follow you. My boss has given me a mission to observe your recovery status and potential hidden issues so as to collect information to assess your potential in the future.” Smith replied in his message.</p><p>Lou Cheng thought about his reply for over ten seconds before replying, “In that case, you would get to learn something new this time.”</p><p>“Why?” Smith, who was initially relaxed suddenly tensed up. His hair stood up just like his initial encounter with Lou Cheng as he was afraid of him causing a huge ruckus!</p><p>Is it too late for me to curse now?</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed, “Relax, it’s beneficial to you.”</p><p>After clicking “send”, Lou Cheng put down his phone. He didn’t avoid Aunt Du, who was driving, and tilted his head to look at his little fairy girl, “After your mind nourishes your body, you could continue the path of Cultivation or you could just stop there and experience the concept of ‘Withdrawing’, Force concentration and go down the martial artist path. How would you choose?”</p><p>Yan Zheke thought carefully about it, looked up and replied, “If it’s possible, I will still prefer the path of martial arts!”</p><p>Cheng is really anxious. We don’t even know if this method is plausible!</p><p>“Yeah. However, you should be mentally preparing. The initial phase of Cultivation is relatively harder. It was especially so for making my mind nourish my body.,” reminded Lou Cheng.</p><p>“I have been dealing with it all these years and wouldn’t mind waiting for another few years.,” replied Yan Zheke with a faint smile.</p><p>“Oh right, did the few students from Martial Arts Club successfully achieve Solemn Silence?” Lou Cheng changed the topic.</p><p>Yan Zheke thought about it and replied, “I have not visited them since the previous time. Looking at Geroge and Wildon’s usual behavior, I don’t think they have grasped it. What did you ask this for?”</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed and replied, “I’m looking for some voluntary experimental targets to explore the combination of martial arts and Cultivation. This is to lay the foundation for me to further prove that this is possible!”</p><p>Perhaps solving my sequela would be dependent on this!</p><p>Obviously, the teachings in America would not involve the deep and profound portion!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
