He turned to Lou Cheng and said,</p><p>“I have to get back quickly to finish up the remaining things. You can be totally assured that there will be no surveillance videos left behind.”</p><p>“Alright.” Lou Cheng nodded his head, released the seat belt and left the car.</p><p>Just as he took a few strides, he suddenly heard Smith shout,</p><p>“Lou!”</p><p>“What?” Lou Cheng turned around and discovered the lowered the windows of the car. He tilted his body and extended his head out. With a conflicted but sincere look, Smith said in a low and slow voice,</p><p>Thank you!”</p><p>Feeling emotional all of a sudden, Lou Cheng smiled faintly and shook his head. He didn’t say a word, turned around and headed for the school gate as per usual.</p><p>The Butcher had revealed himself and Smith finally got his revenge. The misery and pain that he’d had kept within for the last five years was finally able to be released.</p><p>Lou Cheng had already removed the pair of glasses and redressed in his previous clothes. He went to the supermarket and bought a bottle of water. He was so bored that he started freezing the water then afterwards, heating it up until Yan Zheke finished her lessons.</p><p>During this whole process, he seemed to be occupied. He was seriously recounting the experience he got while fighting with Joseph. In the fight, he had an overwhelming advantage and dealt unmatchable damage until Joseph collapsed. Joseph wasn’t able to demonstrate the various unique and strong aspects of the Geruga Sect. However from a different perspective, if he was to encounter an ambush and became passive, how would he turn the tables?</p><p>It was good to think about about a loss in battle but it was equally important to recap a victory in battle!</p><p>Moreover, this was the first practical battle Lou Cheng had after achieving the breakthrough in “Ice Mirror”. There were still many areas he had to refine.</p><p>With his half frozen water bottle, Lou Cheng stood outside waiting for Ke and Aunt Du to finish.</p><p>At this moment, Huang Xiwen, who had a pretty and fleshy face, was walking towards the gate with several other female classmates. They would be having a wild party that night.</p><p>As her vision drifted, Huang Xiwen suddenly saw a familiar figure and her body couldn’t help but shiver.</p><p>That was a well-known figure in Songcheng University! Lin Que and Lou Cheg had led Songcheng University to the National Championship previously. This incident still remained a hotly discussed event in the school forum!</p><p>What was more important was that he is Yan Zheke’s boyfriend!</p><p>Lou Cheng? Why is he here? Huang Xiwen’s heart sank into a hole at the look of that well-defined muscles and manly face.</p><p>He hasn’t broken up with Yan Zheke?</p><p>Did Yan Zheke talk bad about me in front of him?</p><p>Will he beat me up? Is it too late to call the police now?</p><p>I heard that those who practice martial arts are all very impulsive!</p><p>Various thoughts flashed through the mind of Huang Xiwen and all of them were inclined to the negative end. The more she thought about them, the more afraid and worried she got.</p><p>With Lou Cheng’s rumored strength, even if the police could arrive on time, they probably couldn’t stop him right?</p><p>Should I look for Will for help? He is an apprentice of a student of senior martial artist Joseph. Although he definitely isn’t a match for Lou Cheng, he could say the name of Mr Joseph and dissuade him…</p><p>Aiya, what am I thinking? I didn’t do anything bad to Yan Zheke and even keep inviting her to our gatherings to expand her social circle. I, I have a clear conscience.</p><p>Moreover she really behaved very conservatively, aloof and unsociable. She also dresses like an old lady. I didn’t lie about that!</p><p>I’m not afraid of Lou Cheng!</p><p>Lou Cheng was looking at the gate and his vision swept past figure after figure as he looked for his little fairy girl. Suddenly, he saw this Asian girl. From the feeling he got, she should be Chinese.</p><p>Feeling the gaze of Lou Cheng, Huang Xiwen’s legs and belly started to shiver. A cold sweat broke out on her forehead and the back of her skirt seemed to be getting wet.</p><p>“Laura, what happened?” The girl beside her was calling the English name Huang Xiwen had given herself.</p><p>“I, I…” Huang Xiwen couldn’t articulate herself and quickly pulled her classmate along, signalling to her that she wanted to take a different road home.</p><p>There’s quite a number of people from my country… Lou Cheng thought casually. His eyes lit up suddenly and reflected the figure of Yan Zheke. Through her tied up hair and big black frame glasses, he saw the beauty within her.</p><p>He walked ahead and welcomed her with a smile. Suddenly, he heard someone calling the name “Laura”. It seemed like the Chinese girl from before had fainted.</p><p>There’s quite a number of good-hearted people. I shall not be a busybody then… Lou Cheng held onto Yan Zheke’s left hand and took her things from her. All he felt was that his heart had settled down completely. It was as though he was back in his warm and peaceful home. The lingering emotions from ambushing an inhuman stage expert from before had completely dissipated.</p><p>“What happened over there?” Yan Zheke looked curiously to the direction where several layers of spectators had gathered.</p><p>“There seems to be a girl who has fainted. The changes in the weather are too great. You will get sick easily if you are not careful.” Lou Cheng spoke whatever crossed his mind. He had calmed himself down.</p><p>Yan Zheke vaguely saw the girl that was surrounded had awakened and was brought away by a good-hearted soul. Therefore, she wasn’t too concerned and returned home with Lou Cheng.</p><p>While waiting for Aunt Du to get dinner ready, she pulled Lou Cheng who was unprepared up the stairs. Sitting at the edge of the bed, she coughed twice, put on a serious face and asked,</p><p>“Say it. What kind of bad things did you do this afternoon?!”</p><p>Her eyes were keen, sparking and full of curiosity.</p><p>“Cough. I went to capture a perverse murderer.” Lou Cheng summarized and only reported the key point.</p><p>“Perverse murderer?” Yan Zheke’s eyes were wide open and filled with lost and doubt.</p><p>The various conjectures she had in the afternoon were all wrong.</p><p>“Yeah. You should have heard of “Butcher” right?” Lou Cheng asked.</p><p>This is a well-known criminal throughout Connecticut!</p><p>“Yeah, I have heard of him. Empress Dowager even summarized a few main areas where “Butcher” commits his crimes and ordered me not to go there if it is unnecessary. Prevention is better than a cure… You have captured him? You know who he is?” Yan Zheke could no longer keep the straight face and was just like a little girl interested in listening to stories.</p><p>Lou Cheng walked to the side of Yan Zheke and sat down. He nodded his head and continued, “He’s a senior martial artist from the Geruga Sect named Joseph. Remember I enrolled in those advanced classes? While communicating with the spiritual gem to awaken “Own Spirit”, I noticed and deduced the hidden bloodthirst and desire for violence from Joseph. Initially, I did not have any other evidence. If I was to go to him directly, I might become a criminal and be deported from here. Therefore I had no intentions to act initially. Subsequently, the head of the agents responsible for surveying me contacted me. His girlfriend, Sunny, was a victim of “Butcher”…..”</p><p>Not waiting for Lou Cheng to complete, Yan Zheke was shocked. Changing her posture by leaning to the side, she asked,</p><p>“There are agents surveying you? There is really surveillance? That’s actually true. If there are strong experts entering our country, we will also survey them…”</p><p>“Which one do you want me to complete first?” asked Lou Cheng with a laugh.</p><p>“All of them!” Yan Zheke had lowered her hair and removed her glasses. Her eyes lightened up and were clear.</p><p>After she replied, she suddenly exclaimed before saying in a relaxed manner,</p><p>“Luckily we have pulled the curtains…”</p><p>Before she completed her sentence, Zheke shut her mouth and her face turned really red like a peach. Lou Cheng was aroused from the look of it.</p><p>Cough! He cleared his mind of dirty thoughts and answered decisively, “I have seen their recorded surveillance. It only covers my external activities.”</p><p>If Smith dared to peek, I’ll let him know how one can lose his memory from a beating!</p><p>Seeing that Yan Zheke wasn’t willing to continue on this topic, Lou Cheng summarized the overall event and concluded,</p><p>“Although Joseph was similar to an inhuman, I have made improvements recently. Moreover this was an ambush I’m pretty confident with subduing him. What I am most worried about was the handling the cleanup. I’m afraid of exposing my identity and giving you troubles. This was also the main reason why I wasn’t willing to do it initially. However with Smith, this wouldn’t be a problem anymore.”</p><p>“As for uncle Cole, he would definitely turn himself him. However he would definitely not know Who I am and would not recognize me. Even if the Geruga sect was to find a relevant supernatural ability user, he will not be able to trace it back to me…”</p><p>Listening to what Lou Cheng was saying, thinking about each girl who was harmed by the devil “Butcher”, thinking about that father’s resolve of be willing to pay the price… A million emotions flooded Yan Zheke. The edge of her eyes had even turned a little red. She was feeling both anger and sympathy at the same time.</p><p>Those poor and innocent girls!</p><p>That perverse and unremorseful criminal!</p><p>She suddenly extended her hands and patted on Lou Cheng’s shoulders. With a serious face, she nodded and continued,</p><p>“Cheng, you have done well! One of my main goals for practicing martial arts is to be a hero that does heroic acts and removing criminals. You have fulfilled my anticipation in this aspect…”</p><p>As she spoke, her voice turned gentler. In the end, she couldn’t help but reminded again, “If the bad guys are stronger than you, leave them alone first.”</p><p>“I’m not silly,” laughed Lou Cheng. He corrected the girl’s understanding of him and continued, “The truth is it isn’t because I’m righteous and wanted to do such heroic acts that I looked for Joseph. That was only a very small factor.”</p><p>“Then what is it because of?” Yan Zheke was lost. She couldn’t think of a second reason.</p><p>Lou Cheng cleared his throat and said with a satisfied tone,</p><p>“Joseph’s targets are girls with pure and holy souls. Although the probability might not be big, I’m still afraid that he might have targeted you one day. Therefore, I had to prevent it before it happened and eradicate it.”</p><p>He described his imagined “Connecticut Crime Cleaning Plan” to Yan Zheke.</p><p>Yan Zheke was initially shocked but gradually became quiet. She bit her lips lightly and looked straight at Lou Cheng.</p><p>When Lou Cheng was done speaking, she moved her arms and said,</p><p>“You really are, really are…”</p><p>As she couldn’t continue, she gave a sorry look instead. Her bright eyes stared at Lou Cheng as she bit her lower lips and said,</p><p>“I’m no longer pure! You have tainted me!”</p><p>“Haha, it’s normal for a married woman to be a little tainted.” Lou Cheng laughed softly.</p><p>Yan Zheke revealed a naughty look, picked up her phone, leaned towards the embrace of her husband and said,</p><p>“Let me check if there are any reports~”</p><p>After several seconds, she saw the news and translated for Lou Cheng,</p><p>“The “Butcher” that has plagued Connecticut over the last ten years is finally revealed. The father of a victim and a new superhero ‘Deliveryman’, Deliveryman… Deliveryman… Haha…”</p><p>Yan Zheke burst into laughter and couldn’t continue reading.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s mouth twitched and was very unsatisfied with his superhero’s nickname.</p><p>Yeah, it’s super dissatisying. It didn’t sound cool at all!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
