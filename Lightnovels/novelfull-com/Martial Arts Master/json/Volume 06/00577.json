However, there wasn’t any intent to kill revealed!</p><p>Could it be that he hid it so well and that his usual emotions were all pretentious?</p><p>The attendant replied honestly, “Based on the current situation, that is the case.”</p><p>“What was the outcome?” Irina shook her head, hid her disappointment and asked about what had happened subsequently.</p><p>“Lou Cheng suffered grave injuries but also killed Ge Hui.” The attendant’s lips were shaking a little as she spoke.</p><p>“What?” Irina lost her composure from the shock and her eyes were filled with disbelief.</p><p>She could still barely believe that Ge Hui attempted to assassinate Lou Cheng as it was always hard to tell what Ge Hui was thinking. However, if one was to say that not only Ge Hui failed in his assassination attempt, but he had to pay with his life in the hands of Lou Cheng, she wouldn’t believe it at all!</p><p>Ge Hui was mysterious and much stronger than her. He was an expert at the level of the King. It shouldn’t be a problem for him to deal with a growing Lou Cheng. Even if there were other factors, escaping should also have been easily achievable. How could he be dead like this?</p><p>The attendant’s body tensed up. She thought about what to say before continuing, “Ge Hui is really dead. His head was blown away by Lou Cheng.”</p><p>She had initially wanted to say that Lou Cheng had crushed the head of Ge Hui with a whipping kick. However with the short amount of time she had, she didn’t remember the technical terms of Chinese martial arts that were translated.</p><p>“Impossible, impossible…” Irina shook her head slowly and her gaze was lost.</p><p>Ge Hui is so mysterious and had so many secrets. How could he possibly just die like this?</p><p>In this instance, she suddenly recalled her encounter with Lou Cheng in a banquet at Hua Cheng. He was indeed extraordinary and possessed the demeanor of an expert. However, he was still far from being the same level as Ge Hui!</p><p>Has he really gotten this strong?</p><p>For the first time, Irina started to doubt her own judgement. All she think was that the teenager with black hair, black eyes, neat hairstyle and a steady and gentle personality, was a monster!</p><p>No, he’s scarier than a monster!</p><p>The attendant looked up and saw that the princess had calmed herself down. Mustering her courage, she continued, “Dragon King from China wished to have a meeting with you. He is currently waiting in the Black Rose Hall.”</p><p>After pausing for a while, she added, “The king had agreed to his request.”</p><p>“Dragon King?” Princess Irina’s face turned pale and her body swayed. She finally squeezed a smile out after some time and said, “Alright, let me changed into another dress first.”</p><p>……</p><p>The carvings were exquisite and in the dark and black main hall, Chen Qitao sat on the sofa. His eyes were half open, and he seemed to be resting.</p><p>Surrounding him was a faint light but the atmosphere was heavy. Ill intent had seemingly materialized into clouds, crossing the space and sweeping towards his heart lake.</p><p>“Tsk. So the old monster was only capable of this!” Dragon King mumbled to himself. Igniting his spirit, he resisted the pressure that came from afar.</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly opened his eyes and saw Princess Irina who walked into the Black Rose Hall. She wore a bright red fishtail skirt that revealed her back and complemented her curves. She looked beautiful and gracious but her irregular breathing and slight shivering gave away her real emotions.</p><p>“It’s a shame that I wasn’t able to meet Dragon King when I visited Huacheng in July. Who would have known that I would make up for it so soon?” Irina greeted in an elegant manner.</p><p>Chen Qitao nodded his head slightly in response. Before she could continue, he interrupted, “Regarding Lou Cheng’, is it you who told Ge Hui about him?”</p><p>Without any customary or pointless words, he went straight to the core of the issue.</p><p>After listening to the translator, Irina walked to the opposite sofa, forced a smile and replied, “Yeah. I felt that he had a similar “scent” as Ge Hui. After returning to John Weilburg, I mentioned it once to him. As to the actual situation, I don’t know anything about it.”</p><p>Irina thought about it for a while before continuing honestly, “Ge Hui has always been very mysterious. I have always wanted to know more about him but still couldn’t find the opportunity. When I saw someone that was similar to him, it was inevitable that I became curious. I tried to find out more from Lou Cheng at that time to understand the secrets behind Ge Hui. However, in the end, it appeared that he did not know anything at all.”</p><p>Chen Qitao nodded his head very slightly and expressed his approval for this answer.</p><p>What Irina had said happened to corroborate well with what Lou Cheng had said:</p><p>At that time, she had no such intention and was clearly just about finding out more about him.</p><p>“How did you get to know Ge Hui?”</p><p>After the translator translated in real time, Irina thought for some time before continuing, “I met him in a banquet hosted by a friend. Ge Hui had helped the sons of the Chairman of Byron Group and had maintained a good relationship with the family. From time to time, he would participate in various kinds of gatherings. I felt that he was very mysterious and powerful. He was always able to dissect and explain the problem in manners that I couldn’t imagine. It was especially so in the aspect of battles and supernatural abilities. Therefore, I have hired him as our family tutor. Oh right! He also specialized in geometry and had provided several wealthy men with advice on restructuring their homes.</p><p>Geometry? Dragon King maintained his poker face and while confirming his thoughts in his heart once again.</p><p>At the stage of physical invulnerability, one could already establish a connection with the Heaven and Earth and feel the changes to the magnetic force-field in the natural world. They would understand what is damaging to him, what is beneficial to him and changed the home ground based on targeted decision with different layouts. Although they were different from the various magical arrays in the myths, they still had several unique abilities to strengthen oneself and weaken the opponent.</p><p>From a different viewpoint, this was “fengshui”!</p><p>Obviously, if one hadn’t reached physical invulnerability, he could only base them on the conclusions drawn by predecessors. Those fortune tellers in public were mainly hoaxes and based their claims on books. Occasionally, they might get it right. Ge Hui was able to receive the recognition from various wealthy guys, indicating that he had some capabilities in this aspect. This also indirectly proved that he possessed the characteristics of a physical invulnerability expert. Using a different training regime, he had developed the characteristics of the physical invulnerable stage in advance.</p><p>This was a match with the battle strength he displayed and the trails of damages left behind on the ground.</p><p>Chen Qitao asked a few other questions in details. Seeing that Irina really did not have a deep understanding of Ge Hui, he tapped his right hand fingers softly on the couch’s armrest.</p><p>“Pass me all personal belongings of Ge Hui.”</p><p>Irina instantly heaved a sigh of relief. She quickly ordered her attendant to tidy up the things Ge Hui left behind. To prevent the attendant from missing out anything, she even did a thorough search in the end before coming back and saying, “Ge Hui loves to collect things and he left many things behind. This probably indicated that he had no intention to assassinate initially and even intended to return.”</p><p>Based on what Irina had said, a similar scent could indicate a Cultivator that had formed his own Jindan too. At the very beginning, Ge Hui might have been thinking of meeting a new friend and a partner who he could talk to about his practice. However, when he realized that the person had inherited the remains of the Longhu Immortal, he changed his mind… These thoughts flashed passed Chen Qitao’s mind. After which, he stood up gradually and walked towards the door. The attendants pulled along two luggage and followed behind closely.</p><p>At this moment, Irina gritted her teeth before saying, “There’s still one last thing.”</p><p>She took down the pendant from her neck and passed it to the Dragon King. The word “Confrontation” was glowing from within. It was exquisite and clear.</p><p>Chen Qitao took a glance at it, took the pendant over before saying, “If there’s nothing wrong with it, I’ll get someone to send this back to you.”</p><p>Am I, the Dragon King, someone who would be greedy for an item belonging to a girl?</p><p>…</p><p>In Lou Cheng’s ward, several physical invulnerability experts gathered again.</p><p>“Ge Hui’s father died early and didn’t have any strange encounters or experiences in the country. His relatives and friends are also not Cultivators. Moreover, his relationships with them had become indifferent after just a year. Since his mother passed away, he had zero interaction with them.” A military investigator in charge of the lead reported.</p><p>The intelligence officer responsible for the threads in Europe followed on, “Investigating from the clue of the Byron Group, we found out that Ge Hui had gotten the inheritance of Cultivators towards the second half of his first year in university. He took care of a lonely old man in the local Chinatown frequently. The time he recieved his supernatural abilities matched the death of that lonely old man. We are currently tracing the experiences of the old man and trying to see if there are other Cultivators…”</p><p>Listening to this information, Lou Cheng couldn’t help but feel a little emotional. Ge Hui’s experiences were a typical protagonist model… If it was written in a novel, it would be similar to “The Priest in Europe”, “The Closed Home Tutor of the Princess” or “The Last Cultivator on Earth”.</p><p>Sigh. Wouldn’t it be better if we could sit down and talk about it? Why do we have to put our lives at stake and fight it out?</p><p>At my current level, the effects of the Jindan have been reduced to a minimum. On the other hand, I’m more worried about the problems it might cause or any lingering hidden problems. I could work with you to take the Jindan out on the condition of you giving me the manual for Cultivation and the Nine Words Formula. Wouldn’t this be a win-win situation?</p><p>It’s a shame that from a certain standpoint, the rules of “The Dark Forest” is pretty true to heart…</p><p>“It seems like an isolated incident.” Ji Jiangzhang made his judgement.</p><p>“Seems like we do not have to protect him…” Ning Zitong seconded.</p><p>Chen Qitao walked to the side of Lou Cheng and took out the pendant.</p><p>“This is the “Confrontation” Formula. Practicing it allows one to calm himself down and speed up recovery. It’s suitable for you now. After you master it, do remember to return it to the military.”</p><p>When Dragon King completed his words, Geezer Shi immediately added, “If we follow the clue on Ge Hui and continue investigating, the “Formation” and “Dequeuing” Formulae shouldn’t be a problem. When it comes to Cultivation, we are currently drawing conclusions from the things left behind by Ge Hui. You don’t have to worry about these things.”</p><p>“Alright.” Lou Cheng couldn’t nod his head and could only respond with his voice.</p><p>Yan Zheke quickly helped to receive the pendant and placed it in front of Lou Cheng. Lou Cheng focused his eyes on it and started tracing it secretly. He was trying to do what he did in the past where after getting some energy from it, he would trigger the Jindan and allowing him to master it right away.</p><p>However, no matter how he visualized this time, the Jindan seemed to be dormant and gave no response!</p><p>Could it be that he didn’t crush the pendant and didn’t pronouncing the words out? Lou Cheng shook his head at Yan Zheke and signalled that he wouldn’t master it any time soon.</p><p>His hands still required a few more days of rest before being able to move!</p><p>No one would expect a seriously injured person to master the “Confrontation” Formula on the spot. Soon, the few physical invulnerability experts left, leaving the couple behind. Seeing that Lou Cheng’s injuries had stabilized, Yan Kai and Ji Mingyu did not stay behind and returned to Xiushan for their own work.</p><p>“The Jindan was not triggered?” Yan Zheke kept the pendant and asked.</p><p>“Yeah, perhaps I’m lacking a copy of the Formula and the ancient voice.” Lou Cheng answered without confidence.</p><p>After chatting for a while, Lou Cheng started gaining control of his body and could begin repairing his internal injuries. Yan Zheke sat to the side of the bed, took out her phone and intended to refresh the news page before revising for her studies.</p><p>After turning on her Weibo, she saw a piece of popular news, “Lou Cheng has not shown himself yet. His injuries might be a lot worse than we have expected!”</p><p>“I suspect that he has failed in the third awakening of his supernatural ability and this type of failure might have caused him to be unable to be back at his peak for two or three years. Furthermore, it might even hurt his potential to improve to a new level!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
