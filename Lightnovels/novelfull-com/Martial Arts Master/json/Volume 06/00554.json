Moderate sparring will give us all a chance to put our learnings to test and discover our underlying problems. Our trainers are, after all, not of high Pin, and could only add to our experience by imitating other styles. Something’s lacking in that. Therefore, in our Reserve Team, we always have a tradition of organizing a sparring session every Friday afternoon—provided there aren’t any competitions.”</p><p>This was also an effective method to enhance the internal competitive environment of the Reserve Team.</p><p>“I understand. My Martial Arts Clubs used to conduct similar practices too,” Lou Cheng replied nonchalantly.</p><p>Just that it wasn’t as formal, and both parties were relatively weaker.</p><p>“That settles it, then. We’ll draw lots. Since we are here to put our practice to test, there’s no need to reserve or hide strength, so one round should be exhausting enough,” said Tu Zheng as he picked up a blank sheet from the table and scribbled down a few numbers. He tore and rolled it into six paper balls and shuffled them carelessly. “The pair that draws ‘one’ will go up first. ‘Two’ goes up second, and ‘three’ last.”</p><p>They were inside a small office that was part of the training ground. Inside, there was a monitoring device that could be switched on to record footage of their sparring sessions. The recordings made it possible for them to review the process and analyze their shortcomings from a spectator’s point of view. The whole place was infinitely more proper than the Songcheng University Martial Arts Club.</p><p>Lou Cheng picked a random ball, unfolded it, and laughed.</p><p>“I got ‘three’. Guess I’m going up last.”</p><p>“I got ‘one’,” Tu Zheng said, flashing his paper strip.</p><p>“Leader Tu, how did we end up matching against each other again?” Sun Jianlin gleamed.</p><p>There was a distinct ‘One’ written on his piece of paper.</p><p>“It’s fate!” Tu Zheng laughed. He turned to Lu Shaowei and the others. “Who got ‘three’?”</p><p>“Me,” Yu Wangyuan laughed softly, flipping his palm to reveal the paper strip.</p><p>Not bad, a senior Fourth Pin Mighty One… Lou Cheng nodded, looking forward to the sparring.</p><p>They entered the arena room that was specially partitioned from the training ground. Leaning against the bullet-proof, heat-proof glass, Lou Cheng glanced at the cameras everywhere. Tu Zheng and Sun Jianlin had walked into the center of the arena and adopted their stances. Yu Wangyuan temporarily stepped in as the referee.</p><p>Lowering his waist, Tu Zheng began releasing his aura. The smile on his face had vanished, and gold-red flames threatened to leap out of his eyes. Even with a few tens of meters between them, Lou Cheng could feel the air getting warmer. It was as though he had gone back in time to when he was a kid, chancing upon a scarlet liquid leaking out as he walked past the ironmaking blast furnace. It was as though the air-conditioning in the training grounds had malfunctioned, and the heat from outside was seeping in.</p><p>Making mild changes to the environment with his aura… I wouldn’t expect less from a Mighty One nearing Physical Invulnerability… Lou Cheng gave an indiscernible nod. He was in awe, but at the same time, a desire to catch up had been kindled.</p><p>Tu Zheng’s fight with Sun Jianlin lasted for three minutes. It was evident that the former had held back, yet won nonetheless. As their leader, Tu Zheng gave him a few words of guidance. That, combined with what he had witnessed, gave Lou Cheng a new understanding of certain moves in the Fire Sect Dan Stage chapters.</p><p>It was evident that not only did Tu Zheng know kungfu from the Fire Sect, but he’d also mastered the secret art that was a combination of Golden Bell Cover and Immortal Flesh. The only problem was his core force, being based in the Fire Force, couldn’t support kungfu from other Sects, so the effects were hardly optimal.</p><p>Similarly, Sun Jianlin completed his mutation using the Emperor Yan force, so he couldn’t demonstrate the wonders of the Dark Sect’s Wavering Light Shifting Shadow movements.</p><p>In the second battle, Jia Lu armed herself with a dagger forged from alloys. It was the length of a forearm and gave off a pale-red sheen. When she swung it around, the leaking flame-like luster was especially frightening.</p><p>Lou Cheng admired her swordplay with great interest, trying to figure out how she integrated the secret arts of the Flame Sect into it.</p><p>According to what Master said, once one reaches the Inhuman stage, the power of one’s punches and chops are as good as using weapons. The purpose of the latter was, actually, only to increase the range of one’s melee attacks. An inch longer is an inch stronger!</p><p>Of course, as an external object, weapons are not immediately compatible with the force one practices. If one uses it without refining, any moves will destroy the blade, unless if flames and other similar substances are only applied to the surface, which is very ineffective.</p><p>Therefore, if a martial artist intends to use a weapon they just acquired, they will have to constantly nourish it with their force. The modern explanation is that after many times of exposing it to forces of a low magnitude, a gradual change will occur in the molecular geometry and formula of the material. Eventually, they will become similar to the structure of its owner’s skin and muscles, and their force can be conducted through it without damaging it excessively.</p><p>That’s the reason why a heavenly weapon that was once in the hands of a Physical Invulnerability Master was no more than a sharp chopping knife if there was a difference in compatibility.</p><p>All martial artists who expertise in armed combat had a couple of ‘companions’ which they had nourished and used through years. This was to prevent having to start from scratch again if one were to be damaged.</p><p>With the breaking advancements in bionics material study, a made-to-order weapon could largely reduce the amount of time required for nourishing.</p><p>It was a revolt against tradition, but such trends were unavoidable with the progression of time!</p><p>The scarlet light danced and fluttered as the blade left rainbow trails in the air. Jia Lu’s swordplay was aesthetically pleasing to the eye. For a while, she had the upper hand. Unhurriedly, Lu Shaofei put up a solid defense at the start of the fight, avoiding direct confrontation with her opponent at her peak form. She waited until her opponent began losing her momentum, then with a sudden burst of strength began her counterattack, fierce as flames and rapid as riptides. Immediately, her opponent was in a predicament.</p><p>Even after struggling to retaliate for a few times, Jia Lu couldn’t turn the tables around. Not only that, her situation got worse by the minute, until she was at the edge of defeat. That’s when she had to admit defeat, not without frustration. On the spot, they began a post-mortem on the fight.</p><p>Tu Zheng, Yu Wangyuan and the others interjected occasionally, giving their own inputs and advice to help.</p><p>Lou Cheng relished the atmosphere. What his teammates do in private is their personal freedom. When it came to martial arts, they meant business. They were at their golden age of their energy, rashness, experience, and mentality!</p><p>After the exchange, Yu Wangyuan—who had been the referee for two rounds—walked to the center of the arena. His face was round and his muscles were taut.</p><p>Filled with anticipation, Lou Cheng did not dally. He patted his navy-blue martial arts uniform and left the edge in controlled steps.</p><p>The rested Tu Zheng was to step in as the referee for this round.</p><p>When they were both in their stances and raring to go, he swung his right hand down. In a booming voice, he said, “Begin!”</p><p>Lu Shaofei, Jia Lu and the others felt a tinge of excitement. They looked on the battle with greater concentration.</p><p>Ever since Lou Cheng’s last battle with Peng Leyun in the latter half of April, it had been two months since he last showed his hand. At that time, he was already at the level of a quasi-fourth Pin. Where does he stand now?</p><p>They didn’t doubt the possibility of Lou Cheng winning. A quasi-fourth Pin and senior fourth Pin didn’t have much of a difference in their stages. The main difference was their level of polishedness, their accumulation of knowledge, and their experience in actual combat. Surely, Yu Wangyuan was considerably more powerful, but not to the extent where he can crush his opponent. The odds of him winning were roughly 3 to 7, but the outcome was also largely dependent on how well they could perform.</p><p>With Tu Zheng’s shout, Yu Wangyuan pounced towards him like a madman. His steps were quick but small, dashing left and right as he came like a fire on the prairie—unavoidable. Lou Cheng had to take it head on.</p><p>With the intention to experience it, Lou Cheng did what Peng Leyun would do— he chose to not dodge.</p><p>He lowered his waist and stance and concentrated his Qi and blood, then released the Dan Force all at once. A red-white flame glove formed on his right fist. He threw out a heavy punch.</p><p>Yu Wangyuan lowered his back, suddenly sprinting forward, allowing his speed to hit a maximum.</p><p>In that time, he used his momentum to charge forward; meanwhile, he concentrated his Qi and blood. His arm bulged outwards.</p><p>The Fire Force gathered and surged into Yu Wangyuan’s fist. Instead of leaking out, it gently exploded internally, forming an immense push force that accelerated his charge!</p><p>In an instant, Yu Wangyuan’s left fist went out too, leaving afterimages as it took on Lou Cheng’s flame gloves.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The scarlet light scattered like splattering rain. His opponent’s strength was so powerful that it felt like a tidal wave or mountain crashed into him. Unable to defend himself against it, Lou Cheng slid backwards using the ice on his feet, as though he was moonwalking.</p><p>The 15th Style of Flame Sect—Jet Spray!</p><p>During the winter break that year, Dong Shaoyang had used the same move to defeat Lou Cheng!</p><p>It was similar to the One Inch Punch, but replaced joint and fascia movement with controlled explosions using one’s flame force. That can create a second push, change the trajectory of the attack, or simply add power to the attack. It was an extremely practical secret art!</p><p>In a move, the flame scattered like rain. Lou Cheng backed off as though someone had pushed him. Having taken the upper hand, Yu Wangyuan took a chasing step and smashed his right fist out once more! Double Jet Spray!</p><p>“As expected, Yu Wangyuan is a lot more powerful than Lou Cheng…” Lu Shaofei, Jia Lu and Sun Jianlin nodded as they watched. For some reason, they felt relieved.</p><p>You can tell whether someone is good the moment they make their first move!</p><p>Double Jet Spray was Yu Wangyuan’s best ability, and he could follow it up until his opponent admitted defeat!</p><p>The excitement in Lou Cheng, who was sliding backwards, grew stronger. He immediately began working his Qi and blood to stimulate corresponding parts of his body.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>Instead of backing off from Yu Wangyuan’s offensive Jet Spray, he took half a step forward. His body stretched and expanded as he transformed into a musclebound giant. From above, he pulled his arm back and smashed his fist down!</p><p>Simplified Version of the Fighting Formula!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
