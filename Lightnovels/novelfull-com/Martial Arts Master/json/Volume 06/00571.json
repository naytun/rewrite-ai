If a Heavenly son of the era can be so easily defeated, he wouldn’t be one in the first place. It doesn’t matter even if you take stimulants!” The match had just ended and Brahman had been expressing her comments cockily on Lou Cheng’s fan forum.</p><p>After graduating from her third year in junior high school, she currently at a period of her life when she had the most amount of free time.</p><p>“One will only be deserving of the name of Heavenly son of the era by defeating an opponent that was utterly filled with battle intent!” A Plumber Eating Mushroom seconded.</p><p>“The increase in battle strength by attaining the “All Seeing God” realm is truly too great…” Unparalleled Dragon King replied dimly.</p><p>“Eternal Nightfall” Yan Xiaoling said, “[Fireworks expression] Let’s not talk harbor on these useless things! Everyone let’s get wild! Get your hands ready and take out those hidden stashes you all have been keeping like treasures.”</p><p>“What kind of hidden stashes do you have? [Smiling sheepishly expression]” Okamoto’s fan replied.</p><p>“I have all kinds of television dramas acted by both young and mature male idols. These have even exceeded two terabytes! Damn it! I used to store them on the cloud in the past and almost lost them when the server crashed! [Crying sadly expression]” replied Yan Xiaoling.</p><p>“He had only won against Zhitong, what’s there to take from your stashes? The real opponents are still waiting at the back. Excluding those at the ages where they can be our grandfathers, there’re still Zhiren, Meng Liang, Gou Wen, Wang Xuan, Ren Li, Zheng Shiduo, Peng Leyun and the rest. He might just encounter them in the third round. Even if he does not, he will definitely not be available to avoid them when they reached the double-elimination format in the round of sixty-four.” Unparalleled Dragon King halted Yan Xiaoling’s celebration. “Let’s get wild after he wins against one of them!”</p><p>“In fact, it doesn’t matter. Other than Ren Li and Peng Leyun, the rest of them have been in the inhuman stage for quite some years. It’s perfectly normal to lose to them. I have a very positive attitude about this! [Roll on floor laughing expression] ” Yan Xiaoling said.</p><p>…</p><p>Within the resting room of the Guanhai Martial Arts Stadium, a monk in a grey robe was watching the replay of Lou Cheng’s battle with Zhi Tong.</p><p>His face was skinny and was rather oval-ish. He had a high and broad forehead and droopy eye bags. He was the eldest disciple of Daxing Temple of this generation and the one widely considered by others to have the highest hope of achieving physical invulnerability stage within a year.</p><p>After focusing and pondering for some time, he suddenly stood up and stomped his legs. His body bent backwards like it was made of paper and he was seemingly simulating how he would dodge the consecutive attacks of an illusory Lou Cheng.</p><p>The resting room was small and his back was soon against the wall. However, he continued moving backwards by going onto the wall and eventually the ceiling. With every step he took, was like he stepped on lotus over the pond.</p><p>To advance while retreating and to “Compel Submission by Kindness”!</p><p>…</p><p>In the presidential suite of a five-star hotel, a girl with her hair tied in two plaits watched the television attentively. She watched the replays of Lou Cheng defeating Zhi Tong continuously.</p><p>Her looks were ordinary but her eyes were bright. She seemed to have inherited some of the blood lineages of the Miao Tribe. She was approximately twenty-five or twenty-six years and was the proud disciple of the Xuanwu School. Her name was Gou Wen.</p><p>After thinking seriously for some time, Gou Wen relaxed her crossed legs and stood to the middle of the living room. Throwing out two heavy palm strikes, she formed a closely knitted network. Sounds of water flowing could be heard as though there was a large wave raging. As from Lou Cheng’s attacks, they were just several strands of steel chains. They might be able to hold the ship but would never stop the deluge!</p><p>After switching between practicing and resting for some time while making adjustments, the girl finally had some ideas of her own.</p><p>…</p><p>In a room on the thirty-third level of the Wanhua Hotel.</p><p>Tu Zheng held on to the remote control while looking at the floor in front of him. He was clearly distracted and the images that filled his mind were all about Lou Cheng’s consecutive Thunder Roar Zen and Internal Explosion punches.</p><p>How should I deal with it?</p><p>After thinking for a while, he closed his eyes and regained his vitality. Putting the remote down, he walked to the empty space beside the table. He lowered his stance and got into his guard.</p><p>Flames covered his body and his potential was triggered. Sounds of bones and muscles pulling and expanding sounded out from his body, making him suddenly grow bigger.</p><p>Bam! Bam! Bam!</p><p>Controlling his strength, he punched ahead. Within his hypothetical world, he was releasing a secret technique in conjunction with Flames Cannon Punch to take Lou Cheng head on. It was a contest of shockwaves against shockwaves initially and internal explosion against explosion towards the end. He was trying to see who could last longer. Tu Zheng was also at the realm of “Encountering Gods In the Void” and it was clear that he had an edge over Lou Cheng because he was at the brink of reaching the physical invulnerability stage.</p><p>However, this was a contest of battle strength and not which stage one was in!</p><p>…</p><p>While various other martial artists were simulating how they would react to Lou Cheng, Lou Cheng completed the ceremonial bow and saw Zhi Tong being helped to the emergency treatment room.</p><p>He regulated his breathing and blood flow slowly before stimulating certain areas of his body. Suddenly, the fatigue Lou Cheng was revitalized.</p><p>The injuries he suffered in both of his arms wasn’t light and there was quite a number of injuries internally. He had to quickly go into the details and repair the cracks so he wouldn’t miss the best opportunity to do so and affect his match the day after tomorrow. To do so, he would have to be fully awake to control the realm of the “All Seeing God”. Therefore, Lou Cheng had quietly executed the simplified “Wholeness” Formula.</p><p>While repairing his injuries quietly, Lou Cheng walked down the stone steps under the raucous cheers of the crowd and collected his phone and other belongings from the supervision team of the competition.</p><p>When he just unlocked the phone, he turned on the app and saw a message from Yan Zheke, “Such a shame. You almost lost~”</p><p>“Pfft. I just won my match. Shouldn’t you be happy about it?” Lou Cheng slowed down his steps and laughed while replying.</p><p>Yan Zheke replied shyly, “I’m a little disappointed.”</p><p>I don’t even have the chance to laugh at you!</p><p>“You are only a little disappointed? Does that mean that you are mostly happy about it?” Lou Cheng smiled and pointed out sharply.</p><p>Yan Zheke replied, “[Covering face and sighing expression] Don’t expose me…”</p><p>At this moment, the official reporter of the Battle of the Kings competition walked over and stopped Lou Cheng. With a smile, he asked, “I finally get the opportunity to interview you.”</p><p>It wasn’t the rule to have interviews after every match.</p><p>“Is it still three questions?” Lou Cheng smiled and returned the question.</p><p>“Yeah,” replied the reporter with an elongated face. “During your match with Zhi Tong, the two of you were evenly matched at the beginning and you were even at a disadvantage at some point. However, you were able to suppress him towards the end and didn’t leave him any chance. How did you do that?”</p><p>Lou Cheng thought about the question seriously and replied, “When I participate in a competition, winning isn’t the only thing I want. I am also hoping to be able to learn about other techniques in the pursuit of winning so I can witness new martial arts and increase my own experiences. The various unique skills of the Daxing temple are indeed outstanding. I was really on the brink of defeat.”</p><p>“So that’s how it is.” The reporter nodded his head slowly.</p><p>After several seconds, she was stunned and suddenly understood.</p><p>Looking at this gracious answer from Lou Cheng from another perspective, wouldn’t he mean that he was just trying to experience the various powerful unique skills of the Daxing Temple? He wasn’t serious at the beginning?</p><p>He put it so nicely that I was almost fooled! Hmph. It isn’t right to say he wasn’t serious. He was just not actively trying to gain control of the tempo to achieve complete suppression.</p><p>Obviously, these kinds of things couldn’t be said directly. Zhi Tong would be infuriated and he wouldn’t be given a good time when he met with other people from the Daxing Temple in the future.</p><p>The reporter didn’t stay on the previous question and continued with a smile, “Congratulations on advancing into the third round of the preliminaries. At this stage, the probability of going against those popular experts isn’t low. How do you feel about it?”</p><p>“What else can I do about it? Let’s fight! Among them, there are quite a number of them stronger than me at this stage. This is something that I can’t deny. I could only try my best to exploit the slim chances that I might have.,” answered Lou Cheng honestly. “To win once is like having a holiday and to win against two would be equivalent to a long New Year holiday.”</p><p>“Humble in victory and gracious in defeat…” The reporter said sincerely.</p><p>After the interview, Lou Cheng returned to his resting room. He was totally focused on controlling his body and repairing his internal injuries. He had also intended to wait for all the matches tonight to end before heading to the underground carpark to take the Longhu Club’s hired car to avoid the jam.</p><p>…</p><p>At the spectator stand, the young man with silver hairs stood up suddenly. From the middle of the row, he moved to the edge of the row like a fish swimming in a congested school of fish and walked towards the washroom.</p><p>He knew that his opportunity to get the Jindan was here!</p><p>It wasn’t that he wasn’t confident enough to take down Lou Cheng if Lou Cheng was in his peak condition. However, it would definitely take some effort. Moreover, once the time they fought got too long, there would be more uncertainties. No matter if he was in Huacheng or Linfu, there wasn’t a lack of physical invulnerability experts guarding the place. At that time, he would be the one having a hard time!</p><p>The current Lou Cheng was fatigued after the battle. He might even be injured now. Moreover, it was night time currently and he would definitely wait until he got back to the hotel to rest!</p><p>Ge Hui wore an ordinary t-shirt and casual shorts. Without attracting any attention, he disappeared from the corridor of the toilet. He also used a secret technique to cover his thoughts and emotions to prevent triggering Lou Cheng’s ability to sense danger.</p><p>…</p><p>When there’s one last match remaining, Lou Cheng opened his eyes. His injuries had recovered to about fifty or sixty percent.</p><p>He yawned, gathered his things and walked towards the personal lift at the other end of the corridor to get to the underground carpark.</p><p>There was an inhuman stage senior that had switched to a management role in the Sky Moon Martial Arts Stadium with him and he happened to have his match at the same time as Lou Cheng. Lou Cheng would be returning to the hotel with him. However, he was already in the car and waiting for Lou Cheng.</p><p>When the lift’s door opened, Lou Cheng walked in and pressed “B2”.</p><p>After a short pause, the lift started moving downwards. However, when the lift reached B1, it paused again. The door opened gradually from both sides and there was a young-looking man with strands of silverish hair standing outside!</p><p>So familiar…</p><p>I think I met him before!</p><p>A thought flashed passed his mind and his pupils quickly contracted.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
