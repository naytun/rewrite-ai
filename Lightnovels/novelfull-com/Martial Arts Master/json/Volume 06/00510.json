After several twists and turns, they made round after round circling Connecticut University.</p><p>After a while, Lou Cheng exited the video interface and closed the app. He replied to Yan Zheke’s complaints about her professor in a composed and typical manner.</p><p>“Your reply is?” Smith asked with anticipation yet also restless. His voice had become coarse. Lou Cheng took a peek at him casually and didn’t give his reply instantly. He messaged Yan Zheke,</p><p>“[Covering Mouth While Laughing expression] Do you want me to be the ‘Nemesis of Crime and Evil’”?</p><p>“What happened…? [Lost And Silly Looking Beast expression] replied Yan Zheke.</p><p>“The Homeland Security Agent of this place asked me for help. It happens to fall in line with my plans. The exact situation is too complicated. I’ll tell you over dinner tonight. There’s nothing dangerous in this matter. The worst scenario will be needing you to find me a great lawyer. I can’t let this affect my future visa application. [Smile expression]” typed Lou Cheng as a smile appeared on his face.</p><p>“Empress Dowager knows several powerful lawyers. Moreover, with the agent of Homeland Security covering you, you shouldn’t be in deep trouble.” Seeing that Lou Cheng was so confident in his reply, Yan Zheke felt that this would be similar to going to the next street to buy some groceries. There’s nothing for her to worry about. What she felt more was curiosity and doubt.</p><p>Tsk, Cheng is really too much. No matter where he goes, I can’t not be worried about him!</p><p>“Your reply is?” Seeing that Lou Cheng had stopped chatting, Smith repeated his question again. He tightened the muscles of his face, which was under the sun, afraid to reveal the fluctuating emotions he was feeling inside.</p><p>“Not much of a problem” replied Lou Cheng calmly as he locked his phone.</p><p>With the strength Johnny Joseph had demonstrated over the past year, he was rather confident of winning against him in an open ring match even before he had achieved the breakthrough in “Ice Mirror”. Moreover, now he was going to ambush him and his “Ice Mirror” had reached the stage of “Encountering Gods In The Void, Self Reflection”.</p><p>Not much of a problem. Smith was both surprised and ecstatic as he felt a strong confidence Lou Cheng had hidden.</p><p>Will he really be okay?</p><p>Joseph’s standards had been fluctuating but had always remained at the Danger Grade. Over the last half a year, he even looked like he was back to his peak and was at the same level as the monster from China that was in front of him currently. Joseph is definitely not an enemy that could be dealt with easily!</p><p>Smith was a little worried and emphasized this point. Seeing that Lou Cheng wasn’t fazed, he didn’t bring it up again.</p><p>After waiting for five years, he finally had this one chance. He wasn’t willing to miss this opportunity because of overly worrying about it. He wanted to grab and hold tightly to it!</p><p>“Four in the afternoon, Joseph will be leaving from the Msasi Martial Arts Gym and returning to his house in the suburbs. At that time, the students that are guarding the house will leave, leaving him alone. I will use my authority to enter the system and cut his connection with the police system. As for the patrolling police and security guards, they roughly go past his house once every twenty-eight to thirty-five minutes. He has arranged for afternoon tea at forty minutes past four o’clock. This is his habit to replenish the energy he exhausted in the afternoon training. This is your… this is our opportunity.” Smith continued with the details, showing that he had considered all aspects.</p><p>This matter was something he had been thinking about day and night for the last five years!</p><p>Lou Cheng listened on quietly and became even more confident with this matter. For words that he couldn’t understand, he tried to decipher them from what was said before and after. When he really couldn’t understand, he would then ask Smith to repeat them once again and explain. Alternatively, he would just ask him for the translation of specific terms.</p><p>As they interacted, Smith’s car had driven into another district. He collected a jacket often worn by delivery guys and some empty lunch boxes. He also passed the baseball cap that he had his underling leave just in case that Johnny Joseph remembered his looks and tried to harm Lou Cheng in the future.</p><p>This was just what Lou Cheng had in mind. Johnny Joseph wasn’t just an isolated individual. He was one of the top ten experts in the Geruga Sect. He had a teacher, students and friends. If he left behind any trails, there would definitely be a lot of problems in the future.</p><p>…</p><p>Twenty-three past four, Johnny Joseph drove his Hummer and returned to the door of his villa. He happened to see the huge black man, Olsen driving a similarly elaborate car.</p><p>Honk! Honk! Honk! He pressed his horns to stop the other party.</p><p>Olsen stepped on the brakes and touched his bald head. Revealing his extremely white teeth, he asked, “What?”</p><p>Joseph had kept an inch thick layer of yellow hair. Staring at Olsen with his blue eyes, he remarked coldly,</p><p>“Watch your mouth, I don’t wish to hear you making jokes of me.”</p><p>Olsen’s skin tone was dark and one couldn’t tell if he was turning red from anger. Nonetheless, there were some signs of anger in his eyes. However when he looked into Joseph’s eyes and saw that there seemed to be a storm and raging waves cultivating behind their dull blue, he couldn’t help but feel a shiver run down his spine. His emotions faded and he raised his arm to signal that he had noted the reminder. At the same time, he mumbled,</p><p>“A guy who can’t take jokes…”</p><p>He released his brakes, stepped on the accelerator and drove towards the villa at the other end.</p><p>“Coward, weakling.” scolded Joseph. He seemed to want to fight with Olsen.</p><p>He’s about forty years old and was a strong white hunk over 1.9 meters tall. The muscles on his arms and chest were especially defined and he was quite attractive.</p><p>…</p><p>“You can make your preparations now…” Smith, who was watching the whole incident unfold, said with his mouth still slightly trembling.</p><p>It was partly due to anxiety but more because of anticipation.</p><p>Lou Cheng had worn the delivery attire. At this moment, he took out a pair of black framed spectacles and wore them. He also pressed the flap of the baseball cap lower, forming a shadow over his face and covering his identity.</p><p>In his right hand, he was holding on to an American quarter, constantly spinning and flipping it.</p><p>…</p><p>After stopping his car and walking to the front of his doorstep, Joseph saw four students coming over. They lined up in a single row and greeted him politely.</p><p>Joseph nodded his head in satisfaction, said a few words and then waved his hand to signal for the students to leave. He closed the door and entered the collection room on the ground floor.</p><p>There were various exquisitely forged gems in this place. Some of them were red like blood, some were green like a forest and some were blue like shallow lakes. There were various different types. As the light shone on them, the reflected light gave off a peaceful and safe feeling.</p><p>Other than these, there were various wooden and bone carvings on the racks and tables. All of them showed some form of spiritual elements.</p><p>“Haha, they will never find it.” Joseph smiled with a satisfied yet hideous face. He closed his eyes and released his own spirituality while immersing himself in this peaceful light rays. He seemed to have “seen” holy, pure and beautiful faces. They were illusory and fleeting, just like spirits on the water.</p><p>Right as he was about to enter the frenzied stage as though he was on drugs, the doorbell suddenly rang. The bell resonated throughout the house and was a disturbance to the ears.</p><p>“Damn it! Why did he come earlier!” Joseph angrily opened his, now, bloodshot eyes.</p><p>He took a deep breath and stabilized his emotions. Turning his body around, he walked towards the door. As he was confident in his own skills, he only casually took a glance at the surveillance camera. After confirming that he was a delivery man, he extended his hands and pulled open the room door. He saw a silly looking delivery man who was wearing a baseball cap pressed down on purpose.</p><p>Not right! Joseph who had a strong “Own Spirit” suddenly felt a sense of danger that one had when facing a monster or a devil.</p><p>At this moment, Lou Cheng flicked his fingers. The distorted coin within his fingers became a burning ‘meteorite’ and shot towards Joseph.</p><p>The patrolling police would be passing by here in just twelve minutes.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Just when Joseph raised his fan-like palm to defend, the coin that was injected with “Emperor Yan Force” suddenly exploded. The pieces shot ahead, splitting into two, then four and eventual eight pieces, catching the enemy by surprise as the enemy only managed to sweep away one-third of the pieces.</p><p>In the critical juncture, Joseph started emanating a blue light around his body. The speed of the pieces of the coin was slowed considerably and only allowed them to form small red marks on his skin.</p><p>As for Lou Cheng, once he tossed the coin, he had retracted his breathing and blood flow. He released them instantly and threw his left punch, which was covered in the ice crystal shards, towards the belly of his opponent as he dropped the lunch boxes.</p><p>Joseph hurriedly punched ahead and managed to stop his opponent’s attack.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>The blue light around Joseph immediately contracted and seemed like it had solidified just like seawater suffering a cold wave from the north pole.</p><p>“Ice Spirit Force”!</p><p>Lou Cheng retracted his left arm, did consecutive Force Concentrations, shrugged his right shoulders, shifted his fist to the side and ignited a scorching white flame.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Just as he thought he had defended it, he suddenly received an intense explosion like shockwave. The blue light which had solidified scattered into pieces and vanished into the thin air.</p><p>As for his body, he could no longer withstand it. He quickly retreated several steps to avoid.</p><p>Once “Emperor Yan” was out, whoever blocked would be weakened!</p><p>This is the complete “Emperor Yan Force”!</p><p>With Joseph retreating, Lou Cheng strode ahead. Interchanging between “Ice Spirit” and “Emperor Yan”, he did not give any openings to his opponent. As for his footwork, he always maintained the best distance. It was as though he had made detailed measurements that made it impossible for Joseph to counterattack, dodge or escape!</p><p>Bam bam bam, boom boom boom!</p><p>Lou Cheng was like a robot that executed the program as planned. He released his Dan force mercilessly. Half of them was mixed with “Ice Spirit” while the other was mixed with “Emperor Yan”</p><p>After eight consecutive exchanges, Joseph. who still had not gotten the chance to understand what was happening, felt cold and hot from time to time. His strong body was even starting to shiver. If it wasn’t for his years of popularity allowing him to learn how to recovered to his peak after absorbing pure souls, he would probably not be able to withstand the attacks.</p><p>Pa! Lou Cheng took another step forward. Using the state of “Encountering Gods In The Void” to directly stimulate his breathing and blood flow to certain areas, his muscles expanded and the veins and tendons were fully opened. Lou Cheng had become taller and larger.</p><p>This was an imitation of the circulation of “Fighting” Formula. The effects weren’t as good as the original version, but the good thing about it was that one could connect to this technique quickly without the need to shout out!</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>He punched out and hit Joseph’s forearm, creating a scorching white fireball and a violent shockwave. His opponent’s guard was forcibly opened instantly, causing him to stagger backwards. After which, he approached quickly and punched ahead.</p><p>Joseph, who hadn’t been able to demonstrate his strength, knew that he was in a dire situation. He let out an angry roar and awakened the things hidden at the bottom of his heart. The blue light surrounding him, which was weakening, suddenly got stronger and was dyed in blood red hue as he approached the incoming punch of his opponent.</p><p>In the split of the second, Lou Cheng seemed to have prepared for it. He straightened his back, twisted his waist and changed direction forcibly to the back of Joseph.</p><p>Ice Sect, 119th Style, “Cold Swallow”.</p><p>Tsskk! The dull red light “spilt” onto the floor, corroding an extensive hole on the floor. At the same time, Lou Cheng made his visualization, turned his waist, and smashed his fist into his enemy who couldn’t react to it. It landed on the arm guard that Joseph had formed in a hurried.</p><p>“Severe Warning”!</p><p>Pfftt. The surface of Joseph solidified completely forming crystals. The vitality in his eyes was in disarray and lost focus.</p><p>Succeeding in his strike, Lou Cheng immediately struck again. From his waist, he shifted his fist upwards and smashed towards the chest of his opponent, igniting “Internal Explosion”.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Joseph’s body was knocked backwards, and blood was leaking from the side of his mouth. He had finally regained his consciousness from the frost. However before he could regain control of his body that was shaken by the shockwave, he was hit again by Lou Cheng’s “Severe Warning”.</p><p>His vision became completely fazed and he had become an “Ice Statue”.</p><p>Lou Cheng took half a step ahead, turning his right hand into a palm and placed on the left temple of Joseph, knocking him out directly.</p><p>Throughout the whole process, Joseph who encountered the ambush, had no chance at all. All his actions were reflected in the “Ice Mirror” and were firmly and accurately in control of Lou Cheng.</p><p>Lou Cheng swept his hand and shaken off the ice crystal. After ensuring that he had not left any fingerprint behind, he gave Smith, who was waiting outside, a call.</p><p>“It’s done,” reported Lou Cheng brusquely.</p><p>“…” There was silence on the other end. Only deeper breathing could be heard.</p><p>“Lou” had just gotten through the door.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
