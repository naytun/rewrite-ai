Moreover, martial arts sects had to be experienced one by one. He would be coming over once each month in the future and there’s no need for him to settle everything anxiously this time. Otherwise, it would be rather boring for him in the future.</p><p>He took a look at the time, tucked his hands into his jacket and headed back to Connecticut University. When he passed by a street with relatively more Chinese people, he discovered a rather large scale supermarket by coincidence.</p><p>A thought struck him and he retrieved his phone, took a picture and sent it to Yan Zheke. With an [Evil Smile expression], he asked,</p><p>“Should I get some ingredients on the way? I seemed to have finished all the food stocked up at your house yesterday…”</p><p>After typing, he quickly screened through his message. With a smile, he changed “your house” to “our house” and clicked “Send”.</p><p>After several minutes, Yan Zheke laughed, “[Eyes Lighting Up expression], Why does it feel like you are a house-husband? An Inhuman expert as house-husband, what a great allocation~ I like!”</p><p>Following next, she continued,</p><p>[Rolling Eyes expression], But, I don’t remember us going to get ingredients together… Wait for me, I have no lessons in the afternoon!”</p><p>“Alright! [Honest Smile expression]” replied Lou Cheng.</p><p>He switched to the map app and re-confirmed the route before putting away his phone and walking ahead carefreely.</p><p>After several minutes, the wind passing through the streets suddenly got stronger. The skies suddenly darkened, and the surrounding temperature dropped at a drastic rate.</p><p>Shoosh! As humidity rose to the maximum, raindrops started falling and pitter-pattedly forming a symphony.</p><p>“Connecticut’s weather sure changes quickly…” Lou Cheng, who didn’t bring an umbrella, looked around quickly searching for a place that he could seek shelter from the rain temporarily.</p><p>At this moment, his Absolute Reaction noticed the fall of raindrops. He shrugged his shoulders slightly and immediately swung part of the water drops away, preventing his clothes from getting wet.</p><p>Eh, this is pretty interesting… Lou Cheng’s eyes lit up as though he had found something interesting. He quickly gathered his emotions and made the visualization to form “Ice Mirror”. This allowed him to amplify extremely small changes around him.</p><p>In comparison to before, his control could be considered insane after he reached the inhuman stage. He felt like his brain was like a super-computer collecting information from every small corner of his body and quickly giving commands.</p><p>With his tendons and muscles slightly bulging and veins stretching, Lou Cheng wriggled his muscles incessantly while swatting awy the raindrops that fell on him. From his shoulders to his arm, from his chest to his lower abdomen, from his thighs to his ankles…</p><p>At the start, he was a little panicky. He wasn’t able to pay attention to every part. For example, when he focused on the top of himself, he couldn’t focus on the bottom. When he focused on his left, he couldn’t focus on his right. With the rain falling all around him, his body began to quickly show several wet spots. This was especially so for his head. Before entering the physical invulnerability stage, he didn’t dare to delve too deep into training the head. With him only able to pull his skin and minute muscles, there were bound to be times where he would be slower by half a beat.</p><p>One step, two step… Lou Cheng was walking casually in the rain. After getting used to the tempo, he was no longer panicking. With perfect order, it was just like he was immersed in a segment of a symphony, allowing various parts of his body to play as different musical instruments. A wonderful melody was created as he was immersed in this experience.</p><p>In the car on the opposite street, Smith was looking at the surveying image. He shrugged his shoulders and exclaimed to his underling beside him while drinking coffee,</p><p>“Is he a poet? Why is he so happy while in the rain?”</p><p>“Couldn’t tell you. A strange person from the East.” answered the Homeland Security personnel with black hair and brown eyes.</p><p>The rain in Connecticut came quickly and left quickly. By the time Lou Cheng strolled to the open air cafe, the dark clouds had already dissipated and the rays from the sun shone down in the wind.</p><p>Puff… He heaved a sigh. Wiping away the dense and numerous beads of sweat, all he could feel was fatigue and satisfaction.</p><p>The experience from before was really great. It was as though I had turned into a god controlling the human body. Everything in me is revealed in front of me and everything is within my control!</p><p>Is this the feeling of a breakthrough in the use of “Ice Mirror”?</p><p>“Encountering Gods In The Void, Self Reflection?”</p><p>“Ice Mirror” was widely considered the hardest unique skill to master other than physical invulnerability skills. It was the control core of various Ice Sect’s martial arts. Not only was it hard to master, but it was also hard to improve. Since he had morphed and entered the inhuman stage, Lou Cheng had initially thought that it would become correspondingly stronger. Who would have expected that it didn’t improve at all? It was only today that he achieved the breakthrough in a baffling manner because of the rain.</p><p>“The gains this time must have been because I have arrived in America, saw Ke, became satisfied, and cleared my mind. The hidden angst within me has dissipated, and coupled with the fact that I have the foundation and a coincidental chance encounter,” mumbled the surprised and laughing Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Damn, why did it feel like I’m learning some ancient martial art…” Lou Cheng couldn’t help but lament as he re-assessed his body.</p><p>The rain was a little heavy just now. Moreover his control of the Ice Mirror had just achieved a breakthrough. Therefore it was inevitable that he wouldn’t be able to take care of every part of his body. There were multiple wet marks on his body and it was especially so on his head where his hair was already sticking to his head.</p><p>However the majority of his body was still dry despite walking in such heavy rain for over ten minutes. It was still a rather impossible thing!</p><p>After flipping his clothes, Lou Cheng raised his right hand and wiped his hair. When he lowered his hand, the water had already frozen into a patch of white frost and ice crystals.</p><p>He changed his hand and wiped again. A fog was created this time and his hair was completely dried.</p><p>“Not bad!” Lou Cheng revealed a satisfied look and strode towards the bar table of the cafe. He ordered a cappuccino, found a table and sat down. He started sipping on the coffee as he looked at his phone, searching for information on the Geruga Sect, which was all in English. At the same time, he was waiting for Yan Zheke’s lessons to end.</p><p>He had already obtained the relevant information in Mandarin from the Ice God Sect. However they were rather lacking and general.</p><p>On the other end, inside the car. “Boss, take a look at this!” The employee in charge of surveillance raised his head in astonishment and called for Smith.</p><p>“What?” Smith put down his cutleries and looked over.</p><p>His underling was pointing at the screen and said, “Boss, he was walking in the rain for thirteen and a half minutes just now. Yet, only a small part of his body was wet!”</p><p>Smith leaned over and started watching the replay seriously. When he saw how Lou Cheng interchangeably used his Ice Frost and Fire ability to dry his hair, he suddenly had a realization. Mumbling to himself, he explained,</p><p>“This should be some form of application of his supernatural abilities. Yeah, it’s exquisite and magical. Write it down in the report and add them into the information.”</p><p>“Yes, boss.” replied the underling as his query was answered.</p><p>…</p><p>In the afternoon, Lou Cheng, Yan Zheke and Aunt Du met up. They found a rather famous Mexican restaurant and filled their bellies.</p><p>After which, the couple asked Aunt Du to find her own activities to kill some time before, hand in hand, they walked towards the supermarket. When they arrived, they headed directly to the food section and saw all kinds of vegetables and meats.</p><p>“What do you like to eat? My treat!” A dimple appeared on Yan Zheke’s face and her smile was sweet and pure.</p><p>“…” Lou Cheng was stunned for a moment and replied with a vexed look, “I forgot to take a look at the cookbook, and now I’m not sure what food we should ask Aunt Du to make today. Let’s just buy anything.”</p><p>Cough, I had not paid any attention to this the previous night…</p><p>Forgot to take a look at the cookbook… Lou Cheng’s words seemed to have triggered some of her memories. Yan Zheke ground her teeth and stared at him. Her cheeks became redder and redder under the light. Following which, she exclaimed, “What else do you still remember!”</p><p>“Let me go back and do some research. When I’m more confident, we can give Aunt Du a day off and we can do it ourselves!” Lou Cheng laughed awkwardly while trying to avoid certain topics.</p><p>After the small incident, Yan Zheke pulled Lou Cheng, who was pushing the shopping cart, to the shelves where they placed the different kinds of meat.</p><p>Yan Zheke looked around enthusiastically and started putting food in the cart excitedly. At the same time, she was mumbling,</p><p>“This piece of steak seems pretty good, These ribs look good too…”</p><p>Lou Cheng was stunned from what he heard and asked,</p><p>“Ke, did you come here before with Empress Dowager and Aunt Du previously for shopping?”</p><p>Otherwise, how can you choose so quickly and so confidently?</p><p>Yan Zheke raised her head and answered with a straight face,</p><p>“Of course not. Today is the first time.”</p><p>“….. Then what’s your basis for choosing?” Lou Cheng asked with surprise.</p><p>Yan Zheke looked at him with the “Are you dumb?” look and answered confidently,</p><p>“Look at the price. Typically speaking, those expensive ones are always good!”</p><p>“That’s reasonable…” Lou Cheng didn’t know what to reply.</p><p>After getting confirmation, Yan Zheke lowered her head and placed the meat that she had chosen into the shopping cart. She supplemented, “Moreover, take a look at them. They just felt better than those at the side and looked at how beautiful these marks are~”</p><p>I can’t tell… Lou Cheng didn’t dare to retort. All he did was follow behind Ke around and watched her choosing excitedly.</p><p>In the end, they were back at the vegetable area as they intended to replenish some vitamins and chlorophyll.</p><p>“Cheng, what kind of vegetable is this?” asked Yan Zheke curiously as she pointed at a pack of green leaves.</p><p>Lou Cheng squinted his eyes to have a good look before answering confidently,</p><p>“I don’t know…”</p><p>“I also don’t know. I can’t even understand the words on it…” Yan Zheke nodded her head in agreement.</p><p>After which, the two of them looked at each other and burst into laughter.</p><p>After searching for the name, they knew the scientific name of it but still weren’t clear what was its usual name. Yan Zheke tapped on the board and said,</p><p>“Let’s get some to try!”</p><p>With Lou Cheng around, she was very willing to try out new things.</p><p>Just like this, they bought 2 full carts of items. Both of them pushed one cart each towards the payment area. As they looked at each other, they suddenly had the feeling of wanting to really form a family and spent their lives together.</p><p>Both of their mouths arched upwards as they waited in the queue to pay. Although the quantities they bought were large, they weren’t being weird. Many people in this place also purchased a week of food at one go.</p><p>Maximizing the capacity of the refrigerator was a unique characteristic of Americans.</p><p>After paying, Lou Cheng lifted the huge bags of items easily and followed Yan Zheke out.</p><p>They walked passed two white students on their way out and waited for Aunt Du to drive the car over.</p><p>One of the students turned his head around and was looking at the back view of Lou Cheng with a face full of doubt.</p><p>“What happened?” asked the tall student with a bulky stature, freckles and brown hair.</p><p>“Nothing.” answered the student with blonde hair and a devil tattoo.</p><p>He only found the Asian teenager who was carrying bags of groceries rather familiar just now.</p><p>The student with freckles and brown hair did not continue on the subject. He continued with another question, “Geroge, we could become the disciples of martial arts now. Do you want to try out Chinese Kungfu? You have watched the Four Nation Competition previously. Peng and Lou are both really awesome!”</p><p>“Let me think about it again.” replied the golden hair teenager with a frown.</p><p>…</p><p>Back at home, Yan Zheke started her homework. Lou Cheng trained while Aunt Du prepared dinner.</p><p>After they ate, the sky was already dark. Yan Zheke went back to her room, turned on the lights and allowed the lights to dye the room in a patch of yellow.</p><p>“Just a little more and I’ll be done. This professor gives the most homework.” Yan Zheke stretched her back and complained to Lou Cheng about it. Following which, she lowered her head and started working hard again.</p><p>At this point, she suddenly noticed Lou Cheng had brought a chair over and sat beside her. He turned on the table light and the surroundings became brighter.</p><p>After which, he sat down quietly and started reading a book while accompanying her.</p><p>“Cheng, what are you reading?” After several minutes, Yan Zheke couldn’t contain her curiosity and asked.</p><p>Lou Cheng lifted the cookbook and continued,</p><p>“Cookbook.”</p><p>Pfft… Yan Zheke almost broke into laughter. She pressed her lips tightly together and looked to the other side. A deep dimple appeared on her face and all she could feel was how warm the room was.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
