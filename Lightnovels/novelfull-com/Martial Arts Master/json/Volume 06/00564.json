Leaning against each other, they began chattering aimlessly, and anything they talked about brought them joy.</p><p>The television flickered before them and the scenes changed rapidly, but none of them paid attention to what was on it.</p><p>“I feel like I’m forgetting something…”said Yan Zheke in the middle of their chat, frowning in remembrance.</p><p>Lou Cheng diligently consulted his memories, then paused and exclaimed, “Your suitcase!”</p><p>“My suitcase!” At the same time, Ke Ke had also recalled what she had left unattended.</p><p>“Giving you a piggyback was the only thing that was on my mind…” explained Lou Cheng in a mumbling tone, his mouth twitching.</p><p>Ke Ke’s rolling suitcase was still in the car!</p><p>The romantic passion they’d kindled at that time and the breaking down of the lift had made them completely and utterly forget about it…</p><p>“Hurry and go get it!” chided Yan Zheke with a complicated look.</p><p>“Yes, Ma’am!” Lou Cheng stood up immediately and walked out of the door.</p><p>The girl watched him leave, then laid down, hugged her body pillow, and sunk her face into it. She chided in visible amusement.</p><p>“Two idiots!”</p><p>When I’m together with Cheng, my intelligence and wit often leave me!</p><p>No, no, no. It must be due to my period today. The severe bleeding had caused a deficiency of blood in my brain, causing my memory to be foggy. It has to be somethng like that!</p><p>After Lou Cheng returned from picking up the luggage, they both freshened up and changed into their pajamas. For a long while, the two of them lay in the bed, laughing about the whole affair and poking fun at themselves.</p><p>The bed was large, but the distance between the two was small. Yan Zheke stuck her cold hands and feet onto Lou Cheng. Without pausing in between, she said, “Ever since I mastered the Swordsman Formula, I realized that the duration of my period cramps has been largely reduced. And after mastering the Wholeness Formula, I have been feeling more and more energetic. I don’t even feel tired during training after burning the midnight oil the night before.”</p><p>“Great! That’s the best thing they have done so far!” Lou Cheng happily praised the Nine Words Formula.</p><p>Looking elsewhere, the girl said in a thoughtful manner. “Cheng, do you think there might be hidden effects to gathering all of the Nine Word Formulas? Usually, when you gather a whole set, additional changes will occur. In similar secret arts, the first word or the last word is usually the most special. Take the six-syllabled Sanskrit mantra for example. It begins with the word “Weng”, which contains the will of Buddha and enables the five latter syllables. Intoning it repeatedly is said to have the power of suppression. At the moment, the Attainment Formula doesn’t seem to have anything strange about it, but what if the Confrontation Formula is special?”</p><p>If there are hidden effects, I hope it’s of a recovering and nourishing nature so that it can heal Master’s old wounds and compensate your congenital deficiencies, Lou Cheng thought to himself. He laughed softly. “From the six words I hold at the moment, the Confrontation Formula might really have something odd about it. Mhm, according to the military, they already have substantial leads. In the recent one to two centuries in Europe, similar items have appeared multiple times.”</p><p>“I’m looking forward to it!” Feeling a rush of sleepiness, Yan Zheke yawned adorably with her hand clasping her mouth. Still, she didn’t want to sleep on their first meeting after a month, so she found a few other subjects and continued chatting idly with Lou Cheng. It was very quiet outside, and soft whisperings filled the room. It was serene and heartwarming.</p><p>They talked a while longer, then the girl picked up her phone and scrolled through her Weibo. All of a sudden, she asked, “Was she very sexy? That Princess Irina.”</p><p>Lou Cheng had relayed to his little fairy about the oracular ‘you smell good’ that Irina said to him. Of course, he didn’t mention a word about Jia Lu’s classic interpretation. The subject was merely brought up as a mysterious affair.</p><p>Yan Zheke didn’t think Irina was brazenly hooking up with her hubby either. At that time, Jia Lu was beside them after all. As a member of the Royal Family, no matter how open-minded she was, she would have to act as decorum dictates, so it’s impossible that she would be so straightforward. It would have been more appropriate to use sparring as an excuse.</p><p>As for the explanation of her eccentric behavior, she could not fathom. She racked her brain at length but came to no reasonable answers.</p><p>Hearing Yan Zheke’s question, Lou Cheng secretly felt relieved that nothing had happened at that time. Otherwise, he would be sweating bullets right now.</p><p>He pondered for a few seconds, then replied incisively, “Not at all, what’s so sexy about her?”</p><p>“You sound really fake and flippant…” Yan Zheke shot him a look, muttering, “On Weibo, many people were talking about how sexy Princess Irina is. Below the news section.”</p><p>“Perhaps everyone has different perceptions of beauty. I just don’t find her sexy. Speaking from prior experience, I feel that big boobs are a little unnatural.”</p><p>“Oh…” Yan Zheke pursed her lips. “So you like flat chests?”</p><p>“I like it just the right size, for example…” Lou Cheng chuckled, and before he could finish his sentence, his little fairy had landed a vicious punch on him, stopping him from continuing.</p><p>Yan Zheke looked sideways. Propping herself up with her hands, she closed up to Lou Cheng’s head and twitched her nose, sniffing him from top to bottom.</p><p>“What’s so good about your scent…? Why is it that I can’t smell it…?” she said in a doubtful and thoughtful manner.</p><p>Her sweet aroma pervaded his nose, and her soft breath aroused him. Her delicate, soft body stuck to him closely, wriggling here and there. Lou Cheng’s heartbeat quickened as his lust rapidly increased. He could no longer hold back the change in his body.</p><p>She felt a familiar bulge and was taken aback at first. Then, with her eyes shimmering and her cheeks rosy, she chided, “You… You pervert!”</p><p>So it’s my fault now? Lou Cheng grinned. “It’s my little fairy’s fault for being too sexy!”</p><p>In his mind, he condensed water to ice and turned the lake into a mirror. From a top view, Lou Cheng suppressed his desires and gained control of the flow of his Qi and blood. The ‘tent’ instantly collapsed.</p><p>“…” Yan Zheke stared blankly, then said, “Amazing…”</p><p>Ever since reaching the stage of All-Seeing God, Cheng has really developed many strange abilities…</p><p>The distraction made her forget about the whole scent business. They talked for a little longer, then shared a deep kiss and bade each other goodnight. The peaceful night lasted until daylight broke out.</p><p>…</p><p>The next day, in the morning, when the couple was done with their training, they drove themselves to the Longhu club.</p><p>“Perhaps I shouldn’t go.” The closer they were to the club, the more shy Yan Zheke felt.</p><p>It would be embarrassing to be in front of all these strangers.</p><p>“What’s there to be afraid of!? We are legally married! I thought you had always wanted to eat breakfast at our restaurant and visit the club exhibition room?” goaded Lou Cheng, smiling.</p><p>Yan Zheke gently bit down on her rosy lips and made up her mind to put her embarrassment aside.</p><p>Mhm, actually, what I really want is to visit the places you have been to and experience the life you have lived…</p><p>They parked their car after arriving. It took no longer than them stepping into the entrance for Auman and Huang Bin to walk up to them.</p><p>“As I mentioned yesterday, this is my wife,” Lou Cheng introduced Yan Zheke frankly.</p><p>He had phoned the Assistant Team beforehand, telling them he would be bringing a family member to visit the club and requesting the chefs to prepare more dishes.</p><p>“Your girlfriend is so pretty!” praised Auman from the bottom of her heart.</p><p>Wife, it’s wife… Lou Cheng silently corrected her. As they were exchanging banal pleasantries, Lou Cheng linked hands with Yan Zheke, who by then had switched into her elegant and glamorous form. Ushered by Auman and Huang Bin, they went inside the club and entered the restaurant.</p><p>Due to the two of them being lovey-dovey and leaving the house late, there were no longer people eating breakfast in the restaurant, giving them a perfectly quiet venue for their date.</p><p>After filling themselves, they arrived at the exhibition room on the third floor. It was a spacious place, with all sorts of trophies on display. There was a special room dedicated to playing videos of the glorious moments of the Longhu Club and classic fights.</p><p>“Feels like it would take days to watch all of these…” mused Yan Zheke. She turned her head to Lou Cheng. “Go ahead with your training. I’ll be fine by myself.”</p><p>Seeing that Lou Cheng was hesitant, Auman stood out at once. “Don’t you worry, Mr. Lou, I’m free today and will accompany Miss. Yan during her stay here. I’ll make sure she doesn’t run into any difficulties from being in a foreign place.”</p><p>At the moment, nothing matters more than this! I will brush them all off!</p><p>“Thank you. ” Relaxing, Lou Cheng smiled sincerely and nodded at her. His impression of Auman instantly became great.</p><p>This girl is pretty dependable!</p><p>“I’ll be heading to the training room. Chat on QQ,” said Lou Cheng, flourishing his phone. She smiled prettily in response.</p><p>Beside them, Huang Bin could only watch bitterly. As much as he didn’t want to lose out, he didn’t dare to show more diligence than what was due. He was a man, and no matter how sincere he was, ingratiating himself with someone else’s girlfriend would only result in tension between him and Lou Cheng. That would be the opposite of what he wanted to achieve!</p><p>Sigh, though gender inequality is definitely a thing in this society, there are times and situations when being a girl makes things much easier than if you were a guy…</p><p>Auman didn’t notice the change on Huang Bin’s face. The only thing in her mind was the sincere gratitude expressed by Lou Cheng. This was progress at an unprecedented rate!</p><p>Suddenly, she realized that she might have found the current Heavenly Son of China’s soft spot.</p><p>Perhaps…just perhaps, he’s the type that listens to everything his wife says! If so, then winning over his girlfriend would be more effective than getting on his good side!</p><p>Lou Cheng focused on practicing martial arts, occasionally chatting for a bit. Once it was noon, Lou Cheng instantly left the training room. In the exhibition room, he accompanied his little fairy in her viewing of classic fights for half hour, then headed to the restaurant once more.</p><p>This time, Tu Zheng, Jia Lu, and the others were in the middle of eating and had yet to leave.</p><p>“My wife—Yan Zheke,” Lou Cheng smiled as he introduced everyone. “This is the captain of Reserve Team, Captain Tu Zheng. This is Yu Wangyuan…”</p><p>“A talented groom with a beautiful bride!” complimented Tu Zheng and the others, smiling.</p><p>“She’s very talented too,” complimented Lou Cheng. Without exchanging more words, he held Yan Zheke’s hand and began picking out food.</p><p>When the table was filled with food, Yan Zheke glanced left and right, then lowered her voice, saying, “It feels as if I’m here to announce sovereignty over you.”</p><p>“Absolutely right. Care to stamp me?” Lou Cheng raised his arm, then said humorously, “A stamp that says ‘property of little fairy’?”</p><p>Yan Zheke glanced up and played along. “I want it on your face, so everyone can see it!”</p><p>“Here!” Lou Cheng laughed softly, pointing to his lips. He received a coquettish glance.</p><p>Just like that, the two of them settled down in Huacheng. On weekends, they went on dates. On normal days, Lou Cheng concentrated on practicing kungfu, but ended his sessions earlier than usual. Ke toured, studied, consulted, and conversed. The days were sweet and heart-warming. When the girl’s period was over, Lou Cheng almost didn’t wake up on mornings, if not for his strong determination.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, August came. The Longhu Club was about to start two consecutive weeks of campaigning in away grounds. After the middle of the month, Yan Zheke was to return to Xiushan and stay with her Dad and Empress Dowager for a period of time. Afterwards, she will return and stay with him for two or three days before departing to Connecticut from Huacheng.</p><p>…</p><p>It was August 5th. The night was deep and the seawater seemed black.</p><p>A ship sailing on the international waters stopped outside the boundary.</p><p>“Alright, you can go back now,” said a man in a quaint feather raiment to the captain of the ship. There were strands of silver in his dark hair, but his countenance was that of a young person.</p><p>“Huh?” The captain scanned left and right but didn’t see anyone that was here to attend to him.</p><p>At that moment, he thought of something and looked back, but the man in the eccentric attire was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Splash! The waves blustered against the shore, sweeping up waves. A silhouette emerged from the waters, his hair glistening and his clothes tightly clinging to his skin.</p><p>The man came ashore, and as he walked, fragments of ice fell from him. Before long, a white mist formed around him and he was dry again.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
