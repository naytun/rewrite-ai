On the contrary, they felt that this was only natural. Even if he was a Heavenly son of the era, he had just entered the Inhuman stage eleven months ago. How could he match up to Tu Zheng who had been close to the physical invulnerability stage for over a year? It would be strange if he had won.</p><p>How could a one in ten thousand years genius appear again just after twenty years!</p><p>Auman was sitting in a small compartment of the office and looking at the computer screen on her office desk. She didn’t feel disappointed, and had different thoughts flashing in her mind.</p><p>Since she had joined the Longhu Club, she had bought the biography books of the Dragon King and other physical invulnerability experts to understand the common characteristics of martial artists. This was to prevent herself from unknowingly offending the people she was serving. If she did, not only would she not be promoted, but she might even lose her job.</p><p>From those books, she realised that the majority of experts mind a lot about winning and losing. The only difference was the intensity of such feelings. As a hopeful physical invulnerability expert and being the Heavenly son of the era, Lou Cheng should possess the same type of mentality.</p><p>Although it was just an internal sparring session previously, he would likely be disappointed, depressed or had other negative feelings. It might not be a lot but there would definitely be.</p><p>At this moment, if she pretended to encounter him by chance, compliment him, expressed her respect and envy of his wonderful future, Lou Cheng would likely recognize her and feel good about her!</p><p>If he had lost in some crucial competition, she might not dare to go up to him. A martial artist would be like a barrel of explosives at that point and in need of venting his emotions desperately. He would either be feeling too awful or would be hoping for some alone time to calm down, not wanting anyone to disturb him.</p><p>However if it was only at this level, it should be fine!</p><p>Subtle and not too obvious!</p><p>Auman took a peek at Huang Bin who was just a short distance away. He was fully concentrated on his computer screen and typing furiously. Other than that, he didn’t have any other reactions.</p><p>He was in the forum and flooding it with new subjects… The majority of guys were indeed not as meticulous as girls… Auman picked up her cup, walked towards the door calmly and headed for the washroom. She was pretending to go to wash her cup and didn’t arouse any suspicions.</p><p>After entering the washroom, she placed the cup on one corner of the basin before turning to the stairs area. She quickly walked down and reached the ground floor.</p><p>Outside the North-west training ground of the reserve team, Auman saw Lou Cheng the moment she arrived.</p><p>She was exhilarated and was about to approach him. However, she realised that he had made a turn into the Dan stage training room as the door closed with a loud bang.</p><p>She was too slow. Just a step too slow! Auman stomped her foot and couldn’t do anything else.</p><p>After waiting for a while and seeing that her target had no signs of coming out, she could only return to the office of the Assistant team.</p><p>In the training room, Lou Cheng’s phone rang. Picking it up and taking a look, it was a message from Yan Zheke.</p><p>“Landed!”</p><p>The plane had landed on the airport of Gaofen!</p><p>A smile appeared on his face and the negative feelings that he had dissipated. Lou Cheng replied, “[Honest smile expression] Welcome back home!”</p><p>After sending, he added another [Embrace expression].</p><p>Yan Zheke replied, “[Thumb rubbing the middle finger expression] How did the fight with Tu Zheng go? Let me give you some guidance~!”</p><p>The plane was landing previously and she couldn’t find out more.</p><p>“I lost to his Jet Spray. Two directional changes…” Lou Cheng described accordingly.</p><p>The two of them chatted for some time on just this topic. After Yan Zheke left the plane and retrieved her luggage, she went back home together with her parents.</p><p>Lou Cheng had recovered and devoted his attention to practicing the various unique Dan stage skills of the “Fire” Sect.</p><p>Close to dinner, he was about to pack up and head to the canteen to fill his stomach. Suddenly he received a photo sent by Yan Zheke. It was a photo of her fair and slender hands holding on to a handful of green peas and freshly grilled brinjal. Lou Cheng couldn’t control and swallowed his saliva at the look of the message.</p><p>Brinjal from Old Liu Barbecue stall!</p><p>“Should you be trying to adjust back from the jet lag [Lost expression]…” asked Lou Cheng.</p><p>Yan Zheke replied, “[Blushed-face expression] I could only say that I’m too excited after returning to Xiushan. Hehe. I’m going to make you feel itchy for these foods from the pictures!”</p><p>After sending this message, she sent several photos over consecutively. There were close-ups of the grilled brinjals, and other barbecue sticks of chicken, beef and pork.</p><p>“You don’t have to thank me! I’m just a good guy! [Covering mouth while laughing expression]”</p><p>Hmph… From the photos, she should be with Sister Jingjing and Song Li… Lou Cheng looked through each photo and suddenly replied,</p><p>“Looking at the surrounding, why do I feel that it doesn’t match the image of my little fairy girl!”</p><p>Old Liu Barbecue stall front wasn’t dirty. However such premises would inevitably be a little oily and messy.</p><p>“Who’s the one who brought me to roadside stalls to eat rice dumplings, noodles, steamed dumplings and other food? Wait a minute! [Knocking one’s head expression]”</p><p>The one who led me astray is you. It is you, is you!</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled at the message and wasn’t in a hurry to get to the canteen. Leaning on the wall of the training room, he typed his replies with his hands quickly.</p><p>After chatting for a while, Yan Zheke replied,</p><p>“[Eyes of Hearts expression] I’m going to eat now~”</p><p>Before Lou Cheng replied, she added, “I heard from the lady boss that there would be demolitions at the place and they would be moving soon.”</p><p>“Where are they moving to?” asked Lou Cheng caringly.</p><p>“It’s not decided yet. Nonetheless, Song Li had added their WeChat. We can just ask when the time is here. [Heaving a sigh of relief expression]” replied Yan Zheke. “It feels a little complicated. After so many years, their home has always been here and everything seems like it would stay the same. In the end, they still have to move…”</p><p>“Yeah. The things in our memories are all different now.” Lou Cheng supported.</p><p>As was in the verses of poems: The flowers remain but everyone is different now. It wasn’t just the people who had become different. Even the flowers would change. All the memories would settle in the minds of the people and one could no longer find back the same experience.</p><p>After lamenting a little, Lou Cheng changed the topic and asked casually,</p><p>“Has Sister Jingjing decided on where she would be heading to?”</p><p>Xing Jingjing would be graduating this year. With her Dan stage realm and strong supernatural ability, she had received quite a number of invitations.</p><p>“We happened to be talking about this. Sister Jingjing felt that the martial arts circle is relatively simpler and she wouldn’t have to do much socializing. This would be more suitable for her.” Yan Zheke replied. “She’s intending to go to the Guanwai League. The remuneration given at that place isn’t high but they have physical invulnerability and inhumans that specialize in illusionary techniques. She would be able to learn something she’s interested in at that place.”</p><p>“That’s great.” Lou Cheng didn’t chat further about Yan Zheke’s best friend. He was intending to give Director Xing a call to congratulate him later.</p><p>Guanwai League was also one of the top-tier powers!</p><p>While Yan Zheke started to enjoy her food, Lou Cheng walked out from the training room and headed to the restaurant. The skies were dark and seemed like it could collapse any time. It looked like there might be heavy rain soon.</p><p>“Mr Lou…” shouted Auman and Huang Bin, who had been waiting in the restaurant, in unison. However they paused at the same time after realizing the existence of each other as they did not know what to say.</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled and nodded his head. Just when he was about to walk past them, he suddenly recalled something,</p><p>“Didn’t you guys say that the club would reserve some tickets for our home matches for us?”</p><p>“Yes!” Huang Bin answered first.</p><p>“Mr Lou, how many tickets do you want?” Auman took the initiative and asked. “Do you need those where we are the away team?”</p><p>Yan Zheke had arrived at the City of Flowers and he couldn’t possibly ask her to keep staying at home. She would be bored to death! If it was a home match, it could be considered as a short date. If it was an away match, they could head out a day in advance and considered it as a small vacation.</p><p>Hmph. It’s great just to be thinking about it!</p><p>“Alright!” Auman promised decisively.</p><p>This caused Huang Bin, who wasn’t sure if he could get tickets for the away matches, to be annoyed.</p><p>I’m really silly. With Lou Cheng’s identity and the fact that he is being held in such high regards, who would be so calculative towards him over such a small request?</p><p>If the rules were defined, all he had to do was to follow it. If the rules didn’t, he could just add it on to the rules!</p><p>“Thank you!” Lou Cheng answered sincerely. Walking into the restaurants, he saw Tu Zheng and the rest were there too.</p><p>It seems like everyone has rather similar schedule today… After going over and greet them, Lou Cheng found a table and filled the table with dishes of food.</p><p>While eating, Zhang Shouxin from the External Affairs team walked over hurriedly. After looking around, he adjusted his spectacles and said,</p><p>“Great, everyone is here. There’s something that I have to trouble you guys.”</p><p>“What’s the matter?” As the captain, Tu Zheng asked.</p><p>“There’s an incident at the South-side previously and all the experts of the security company had been deployed to some other place. Now we have a mission and couldn’t find inhuman level experts.” Zhang Shouxin explained the cause and effect in a summarized way.</p><p>The properties of Longhu Club would naturally include security company. However their focus was different from other similar firms and was considered to be one of the contractors for the military. Most of the missions were beyond the borders.</p><p>“What kind of mission? It might cause delays if we have to go overseas. The Battle of the Kings would be starting at the end of August.” Tu Zheng laid out the unpleasant words at the very beginning.</p><p>Zhang Shouxin swallowed his saliva before continuing, “There would be no need to travel overseas and it would just be in the City of Flowers. The representative group of Samanno Royal Family from Europe would be coming over from the Capital and would be staying over for two days. They have their core security team and we just have to be in charge of the security of the external surrounding. Those miscellaneous things would be handled by others and the professional things would be handled by the professionals. We will need two inhuman experts to be around in rotation just to prevent any accidents from happening.”</p><p>At this point, he paused again before asking, “Do you guys know about the Samanno Royal Family?”</p><p>“We do. They are the “Vampire” family!” replied Jia Lu with a laugh.</p><p>The martial arts of Sammano Royal Family was similar to the inheritance of “Dark” Sect. Their ancestors could be traced back to before the common era. Over the generations, they had several physical invulnerability experts, ensuring that the mutated bloodline still remained strong until today. Supernatural abilities users were also common. Their speed was fast, strength and regeneration were great and had a strong desire for blood. The vampire from the western novel had their blueprints based on them.</p><p>In order to maintain such a mutation, marriage between close families was common between those who showed promise. To the external world, they called this “purifying bloodline”.</p><p>“It’s great that you guys know about them. Other than being in charge of external security, we also have the intention of keeping a close eye on them to prevent them from giving in to the instinctive urges. At the same time, this was to prevent them from committing any errors that will result in extremely negative consequences. All this would just a preventive measure.” After explaining clearly, Zhang Shouxin asked again, “Who are interested? We will need two people.”</p><p>Isn’t this similar to the spider mission? It’s troublesome… Lou Cheng thought and pretended to not have heard anything.</p><p>Seeing that no one responded, Tu Zheng laughed,</p><p>“Let’s go by the old rules, drawing lots.”</p><p>“Alright.” The rest nodded their head in unison.</p><p>After finding a new piece of paper, he tore it into six pieces and wrote “Go” on two of them. After which, he rolled them into balls and placed them in the bowl before passing it to Zhang Shouxin to jumble them up.</p><p>Lou Cheng extended his hand and took one of it without choosing. Opening it, he saw a word clearly written on it,</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>This luck… Lou Cheng mocked himself and showed the results to the rest of them.</p><p>“Who else?” Zhang Shouxin asked.</p><p>“Me…” Jia Lu raised her hand helplessly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
