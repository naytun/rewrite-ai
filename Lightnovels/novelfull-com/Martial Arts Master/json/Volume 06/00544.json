It was indeed not easy!</p><p>From today onwards, I am finally going to stand at the same level as  him and see him as equal without a difference. It has been two and a  half years since the time when my Master brought me to Shanbei in the  morning to see Peng Leyun, to learn from him and use him as the target!  For the last hundreds of days and nights, I have taken one step at a  time and finally, I’m here.</p><p>Obviously this wouldn’t mean that he was safely one head above  Priest. Lou Cheng could feel that even if he was to consider his secret  arts, the difference between them was still minimal. If it wasn’t  because Peng Leyun had miscalculated and taken on the Lament Of The Ice  Queen directly today, the outcome might have been completely different.  As for the improvements at the inhuman stage, it would get harder and  harder. Even if he was to master the techniques of the Fire Sect in the  future and Priest had mastered other unique skills, it would just be  increasing the tricks they had. All they could do was have some  unexpected elements and not a material improvement. For a very long time  in the future, there would be victories and defeats between the two of  them.</p><p>Lou Cheng took a look at Peng Leyun at the very end and slowly retracted his vision. In his heart, he quietly mumbled,</p><p>“After today, we will be competing to see who can reach the  breakthrough first and who can enter the physical invulnerability stage  earlier!”</p><p>…</p><p>In the spectator stand, Ann Chaoyang, who had spent money  specifically to purchase the ticket for the match, relaxed his crossed  arms. He leaned back and heaved a sigh,</p><p>“Hehe. Priest was not taking it easy and yet lost the match…”</p><p>It wasn’t that Peng Leyun had not failed before. However, his losses  were always because of rotational strategies by several experts or  because he wanted to experience the unique skills of others and was  taking it too easy. It’s rare that he gave it his all and still lost the  match. It was even more so between experts at the same level as him!</p><p>In the changing room of Capital University, Ren Li was watching the  live broadcast throughout. She wasn’t worried that this would affect the  second semi-final matches that would be starting soon.</p><p>At this moment, her doll-like pretty face had a little worry and a little more relief.</p><p>She was worried because Lou Cheng had finally caught up with them and  her fear had become truth. She felt relief because it was now proven  that even Priest could fail and there were times where he would be  helpless. It wasn’t impossible to defeat the big devil. The shadow that  was cast over her mind had since then dissipated.</p><p>I could also defeat you… Ren Li thought as she rubbed the long sword in a scabbard placed horizontally across her knees.</p><p>…</p><p>“Lou Cheng, Lou Cheng!”</p><p>“Peng Leyun, Peng Leyun!”</p><p>In the cheers and encouragements, the host, Liu Chang, in the broadcasting room suddenly sighed and said,</p><p>“An amazing match and the domineering Lou Cheng has ended the era of the big devil.”</p><p>“Indeed. Although the difference in their performance wasn’t big and  Peng Leyun might be able to win it back in the next round, the  invincible big devil has indeed passed away.” The guest commentator He  Xiaowei supplemented. “From today onwards, it is no longer lonely for  the expert!”</p><p>“No longer lonely for the expert… This is really apt! They do not  have to worry about not having an opponent at a similar level. They  could motivate and spur each other on just like enemies and friends at  the same time and improve from the past!” exclaimed Liu Chang. After  which, he added, “When I said “enemies”, I meant competitors.”</p><p>The fans nowadays were scary. If they didn’t agree with what you  said, they might just start defaming you. He had to be really careful!</p><p>“Yeah. Such a contest isn’t common among the inhuman experts in  professional competitions. Everyone can review this often. At that time,  Liu Chang and I would be publishing a detailed analysis version. It  wouldn’t be like before where we were a little short of words, stunned  and couldn’t keep up with the tempo. Haha. If anyone is interested in  the replays now, our partner White Jade Hall Channel supports online  replays and slow motions videos.” He Xiaowei helped to introduce and  publicize about their partner.</p><p>Liu Chang nodded his head in approval but quickly sighed emotionally,  “It’s really a shame. Lou Cheng will be entering the professional  league as an “apprentice” in his fourth year. Otherwise, he would be a  super big devil that couldn’t be moved in the next Inter-University  Martial Arts Competition.”</p><p>“What’s so interesting about bullying primary school kids? Without  Peng Leyun, Ren Li or any other comparable opponents, what’s the point  of bullying the rookies? It will be a waste of time and his life!” He  Xiaowei laughed.</p><p>Liu Chang thought about it and answered seriously, “Strictly based on  my personal opinion, I have to admit that bullying the rookies could be  really interesting!”</p><p>As he spoke, he started laughing. He Xiaowei couldn’t control himself and burst into laughter too.</p><p>“Alright, the second match will be beginning soon. Let us see how  much strength Lou Cheng still has. Can he still create miracles?” After  several seconds, Liu Chang returned to his professional self.</p><p>“I don’t think that Lou Cheng can do much after winning against Peng  Leyun.” He Xiaowei wasn’t stingy with his views and shared it openly.</p><p>Shut up! All the supporters of Shanbei and the fans of Peng Leyun were shouting these words in unison in their mind.</p><p>……</p><p>It was morning in America and the skies were already slightly lit.  Yan Zheke leaned back on the pillow as support, place her laptop in  front of her, tablet on her left, phone on the right and continued  watching the live broadcast. She was replaying the previous battle and  refreshing the forum on Weibo constantly.</p><p>And when the referee announced the results, on the bench of Songcheng  University Martial Arts Club, Yan Xiaoling had already jumped into the  air and waving her arms agitatedly. She was also mumbling words that  others couldn’t understand.</p><p>If it wasn’t for He Zi pulling her back, no one knew what would she do.</p><p>Another die-hard fan of Lou Cheng, Deng Yang, also waved his fists  fanatically and fist bumped Cai Zongming, Wang Dali and the rest. The  group were speechless about his actions.</p><p>Oh darn mental retardation… Cai Zongming smiled, looked around him and scolded in his mind.</p><p>Cheng is really darned powerful!</p><p>As they were immersing in their joy, they seemed to have forgotten  that the competition wasn’t over. It was only when Fang Zhirong, who was  handsome looking but full of freckles, had gone up the stone ring that  they restrained their emotions and waited for the signal of the referee.  At this point, although they were filled with anticipation, they also  felt that it no longer mattered.</p><p>…..</p><p>In the arena, seeing that his opponent had a baby face and had a  heavy and stubborn aura, Lou Cheng didn’t take a breather. Instead, he  retracted his breathing and blood flow as he did not wish to waste his  precious vitality.</p><p>Although this would cause his body to constantly feel the lingering  effects of electric currents and numbness, he could slowly relieve such  feelings when sparring after the battle had officially started!</p><p>Scrutinizing Lou Cheng’s shivering body, Fang Zhirong didn’t dare to  be careless. He put up his guard and concentrated fully on the match.</p><p>The other party was indeed near his limits. Moreover he had been  seriously affected by the electric shocks. Nonetheless, a camel that  died from starvation was still larger than a horse!</p><p>A struggling beast was equally fierce and ruthless!</p><p>The referee didn’t wait long. He raised his right arm up, quickly swung it down and said,</p><p>“Begin!”</p><p>Fang Zhirong ducked and his posture creepily jumped to the side. He  was like a moving poisonous snake or a wild wolf approaching its prey  while hiding in the shades. His figure seemed to have darkened and  appeared to be in the shadows.</p><p>He was thinking of circling the enemy for a guerilla attack and wait for the opportunity to finish his opponent in one move!</p><p>Lou Cheng took a deep breath. Resisting the numbness and soreness of  his muscles, he leveraged his strong control of “Self Reflection” as the  core and pounced out. From being completely still, he quickly moved  into high-speed. As he turned, the friction created with the air caused  strong winds. He was chasing after his enemy proactively!</p><p>Bam! Bam! Bam! The strong winds were blowing incessantly and the  lightning crossed the skies. It was as though there was a spiritual  ritual by a god. Lou Cheng changed his direction constantly and pressed  on fanatically. With the screams from the audience, he closed the  distance between Fang Zhirong and him.</p><p>However his opponent had a strange moving technique and was able to  slip past. In a short period of time, it would be hard to lock on to  him.</p><p>At this point, Lou Cheng concentrated and visualized the ancient  words. His breathing and blood flow started circulating accordingly and  stimulated certain areas of his body. His gaze instantly turned sharp  and the bloodlust aura shot out and covered his enemy.</p><p>Fang Zhirong’s mind immeadiately started to sway. It was as though he  was on the battlefield that was dyed red by blood and was facing a  general holding a slaughtering knife while riding on a horse. From the  outside to the inside, he was feeling uneasy as his body paused for a  moment.</p><p>Because of this pause, Lou Cheng cut to the front of him. Retracting  his breathing and blood flow, he neutralized part of the numbness. His  left fist, which was wearing a shimmering ice crystal surrounding by  frosty fog, swung to the side.</p><p>The effects of the simplified “Army” Formula weren’t strong enough.  Fang Zhirong regained his consciousness after a short period of daze.  Seeing that he couldn’t avoid the heavy ice spirit punch, he quickly  exploded his Dan force, expanded his arm and did a cross punch to  counter the attack with an attack.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Fang Zhirong’s body swayed His strength was evenly matched with the  current Lou Cheng. However as he was invaded by the chill, his muscles  were slightly stiff and his actions became sluggish.</p><p>Bam! Lou Cheng did another Force Concentration. With scorching red  light surrounding his right fist, he threw it out like a cannon.</p><p>Bam bam bam! He made consecutive explosions and interchanged between  his fist. Sometimes it was Ice Spirit to slow his opponent and sometimes  it was Emperor Yan to cause damage. The connection was smooth and each  hit was heavy and accurate.</p><p>Bam bam bam! Fang Zhirong barely held on and managed to somehow  withstand. He wanted to use his killer move to break free from this  difficult situation or dodge away to gather himself. However he couldn’t  find an opportunity. The control of pace and connections between moves  of his opponent were so accurate as though he had measured them with a  ruler. There weren’t any flaws, causing him to be unable to use any of  the skills he had been working hard on for the past year!</p><p>In the intense barrage of attacks, Lou Cheng suddenly slowed down.  Using his first-mover advantage, he visualized the heavy and scorching  hot Emperor Yan and the Fire God Zhurong riding a crimson dragon.</p><p>Stomp! He took a step ahead, pulled back his right arm and shot it forward like an arrow released from a bow.</p><p>Simplified “Fire” Sect physical invulnerability move, Internal Explosion Punch!</p><p>In the previous battle, Lou Cheng was mainly using his ice force. He  had exhausted them and couldn’t support Severe Warning. Even if he  forcefully used it, the impacts on Fang Zhirong would be limited and it  would be tough for him to cause lingering injuries. It would then just  be a waste.</p><p>At this moment, Fang Zhirong clearly didn’t react to the change in  tempo of his opponent well enough. He could only execute Force  Concentration and release Dan aura as he opened his palm and pushed it  up from the bottom of Lou Cheng’s fist.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>His internal body seemed to have experienced an explosion. He  breathing and blood flow was irregular and his internal organs seemed to  have shifted.</p><p>Lou Cheng retracted his breathing and blood flow and struck once  again with a punch covered in Ice Spirit. He connected on the guard  formed by Fang Zhirong hastily as Fang Zhirong staggered back. His  muscles were going stiff and he had to quickly execute Force  Concentration to resist fanatically.</p><p>It was another visualization and another Internal Explosion Punch.  Lou Cheng was expressionless as he cut forward and swung his fist  heavily downwards onto the hastily formed arm guard.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Red liquid was oozing out from the edge of Fang Zhirong’s eyes, nose,  ears and mouth. His breathing and blood flow was raging irregularly  till the point where it was hard for them to circulate smoothly. His  internal organs had also suffered serious damage.</p><p>Lou Cheng retracted his force and attempted another Ice Spirit punch.  However he suddenly felt dizzy as his mind had exceeded the limits.</p><p>He failed to concentrate his Dan Force and the compressed breathing and blood flow dispersed accordingly.</p><p>Fang Zhirong was initially shocked. After which, he suppressed his  injuries, grabbed hold of the opportunity, pulled his back and leapt  ahead. This leap covered over ten metres!</p><p>This wasn’t the end yet. He forcefully made a turn and dodged to the side.</p><p>Lou Cheng felt a little pity and attempted to give chase with normal attacks.</p><p>However when he made a step forward, all he felt was that the entire  world was spinning as he almost fell. All he could do was to stand there  helplessly.</p><p>And when he made the step, Fang Zhirong was like a bird alarmed by an  arrow. He shifted his centre of gravity and quickly retreated in fear!</p><p>Lou Cheng couldn’t contain his laughter when he saw the scene and broke into laughter.</p><p>When he started laughing, he couldn’t stop. This had originated from  the exaggerated reaction of Fang Zhirong and the happiness from  defeating Fang Zhirong after a tough battle!</p><p>“Haha…”</p><p>Lou Cheng shook his head. He no longer cared about Fang Zhirong and  the referee as he turned his body, strode out and walked towards the  stone stairs while laughing, leaving the arena carefreely.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
