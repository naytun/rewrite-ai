However, when he raised his head and looked at Lou Cheng, it was clear that he wasn’t boasting. He was saying it in a simple and direct manner as though he was discussing what’s on the menu for dinner tonight.</p><p>This wasn’t singing his own praises or bragging. It was the truth!</p><p>Oblak took a deep breath and told himself that an ironsmith was good at making metal, a tailor was good at altering clothes and everyone had something that they were good in. Even a King didn’t have to be better in all aspect than a poor civilian.</p><p>After listening to Lou Cheng’s answers quietly, Grand Cultivator Sysco smiled and said,</p><p>“I understand now.”</p><p>After saying, he nodded his head to show his appreciation, turned around and head for the exit. His pace wasn’t fast or slow.</p><p>Oblak was responsible for tying up the loose end. With a serious look and stern voice, he told Lou Cheng, “The inquiry will end here. Thank you for your cooperation. If there is a need, we might pay you a visit again.”</p><p>Since the Grand Cultivator didn’t say anything, it meant that Lou Cheng wasn’t lying.</p><p>“Alright.” Lou Cheng nodded his head relaxingly.</p><p>Oblak took a deep look at him and didn’t say another word. He turned around and caught up with the leaving Sysco.</p><p>He had initially intended to raise the issue of a challenge. However, it had to wait.</p><p>The stolen Holy Grail was a more serious matter. As a member of the Knight Squadron, he couldn’t be thinking about his personal desires and ignore the bigger picture. In addition, he suddenly had some uncertainty in his heart and almost lost his confidence. When the words were at his mouth, he couldn’t say them.</p><p>Although Lou Cheng isn’t at the “Crown level” and is at the same level as me, he is vaguely an edge above me and felt a little insurmountable… With a heavy expression on his face, Oblak boarded the car.</p><p>After seeing them off with his eyes, Lou Cheng closed the door and walked back to the living room.</p><p>Yan Zheke stood up and leaned over. In a cheerful manner, she said to Lou Cheng, “You can say that… Cheng, you are really too impressive~”</p><p>“Why do I feel like you are mocking me?” Lou Cheng found her comments hilarious and looked at her. “That guy just now was Oblak who visited Gaofen in the past. From his eyes, I can tell that he felt recalcitrant and wants to have a fight with me. I can only strike a grand pose to scare him away. Otherwise, with my strength will only recovered to seventy or eighty percent, I might really not be a match for him.”</p><p>“Technique: striking a grand pose!” Yan Zheke looked up and said. ” You still remember who he is?”</p><p>“Definitely. Those were the days of our free and easy trip. I will not forget it in my lifetime!” giggled Lou Cheng.</p><p>“I remembered this guy the moment I saw the Brutale representative group. He even chased me for an entire street this afternoon.”</p><p>Yan Zheke pressed her lips tightly together and turned her head away. She smiled but acted normally and said, “I remember too.”</p><p>At this point, Aunt Du returned to her own room to give the couple some space.</p><p>Yan Zheke looked to the left and right and suddenly heard a growling sound from her stomach. She raised her eyebrows and look straight at Lou Cheng. In a seemingly pitiful tone, she said, “Cheng, I’m hungry…”</p><p>As to what she really meant, she didn’t have to say it explicitly.</p><p>“Let me go take a look at what we have in the fridge and freezer.” Lou Cheng lowered his head and smiled as he walked to the kitchen. He then said, “We still have some left over dumplings from yesterday and quite a bit of noodles. Should we have some dumpling noodles?”</p><p>“Alright!” Yan Zheke smiled sweetly and followed Lou Cheng into the kitchen.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Lou Cheng took his apron and wore it.</p><p>“You are making supper for your wife and I have to make supper for my dear~!” giggled Yan Zheke. “You are so gluttonous and always steal my food! Hmph. I feel that the egg fried rice I make will not lose to you. Do you want a bowl of egg fried rice?”</p><p>“One large bowl!” Lou Cheng replied with a large radiant smile.</p><p>Just like this, the couple got busy for each other. From time to time, they would exchange some words and chat about random topics.</p><p>“Cheng, are you returning to Songcheng sometime later?” Yan Zheke tilted her head and asked while beating the egg.</p><p>“Yeah, I have to go back to get my certification. I have even skipped my oral defence. I can’t skip this too. Moreover, there’s another thing that I have to tie up the loose ends. You should know about it too.” Lou Cheng looked at the pan that was used to heat up the water and increased the intensity of the fire.</p><p>“In that case, I will go too to pay a visit to Dirty Tong and…” Yan Zheke exclaimed happily, then paused for several seconds.</p><p>Biting her lower lips softly, she said emotionally, “From the next semester onwards, I will have to follow my mentor for my internship. I will be busier… And you will be re-entering the professional competition circle and will also get busier… Why don’t we go for a holiday this summer break? Let’s go and get a love lock, go and see the pyramid and go and roam carefreely on the grass plains. What do you think?”</p><p>Although he was caught off guard by his wife’s question, Lou Cheng quickly caught up. He poured the dumplings into the pan and said, “Sure, let’s plan our itinerary later.”</p><p>“Yeah. We can go to Songcheng first and then back to Xiushan. We should stay at home for a while until the beginning of August before we head out. Otherwise, my father might not be very happy…” Yan Zheke was thinking and planning for the future as she fried the egg. Oh ya! Her thoughts jumped again and she exclaimed, “Cheng, I fall in love with a kind of animal recently!”</p><p>“What kind of animal?”</p><p>“Brother Crew Cut!”</p><p>“Huh? What’s that?”</p><p>“A honey badger! It has a white flat head that extends down like a cape! Its symbolism is “Always fighting or on the way to a fight”! Oh, there’s one more, “Don’t tell me who the enemies are or how many of them. Just tell me the time and location”.”</p><p>“Sounds pretty interesting.”</p><p>“Yeah! And there’s also…”</p><p>“Hey Ke, you should turn off the fire for the egg fried rice. I can vaguely smell something burning…”</p><p>“Aiya…”</p><p>After some time, a notification tone sounded in the kitchen.</p><p>“Cheng, Cheng, who are you chatting with on WeChat?”</p><p>“With Smith.”</p><p>“Spidey? What did he say?”</p><p>“He asked me about why my danger assessment grading has suddenly adjusted back to “Danger Grade” and that he would need to survey me the entire day again.”</p><p>“You kept laughing a while ago. What did you reply to him?”</p><p>“I said that’s because I just bragged in front of the Grand Cultivator.”</p><p>“Pfft. What is his response?”</p><p>“He said MMP (Note: MMP is a vulgarity in China. Synonymous with ‘motherf*cker”)”</p><p>“Haha, where did he learn his Mandarin from?”</p><p>…</p><p>“There are over a billion people in the world and only I have evolved to have this ability, the ability to obtain corresponding ability of others by taking in their blood! This is the ability of God!”</p><p>He was a skinny man who wore a black tuxedo and a dull red cape. His facial features were deep and his eyes were red. In his hand, he twirled an unsophisticated grail made of silver. It seemed to be full of blood but had nothing in there in actuality.</p><p>“Yeah, that is so unique. They would have never expected that the engravings of an “eye” on the forehead of those you have killed isn’t because of a cult’s ritual. It is just a farce. What you are really after is their blood and their unique characteristics right, ‘Nightmare”?” Opposite of the man in dull red cape was a man with brown eyes. He was approximately thirty to forty years old and were well dressed. In the pocket of his chest, his handkerchief was folded in the shape of a flower.</p><p>“Yeah. Thank you for your help, God Slayer.” The man in dull red cape laughed heartily. “Now that i have extracted the blood of the Savior, absorbed it and digested it, I will truly reach the “Terror Grade”! I will replace that old man in the Samanno Royal Family and become the King of the Blood Race in the future!</p><p>At this point, he looked to the other side. There was a man with tanned skin standing there. His facial features were distinctly from the dead sea area, and he also had a big beard.</p><p>The man in a dull red cape placed his right hand on his chest and bowed elegantly. “Thank you Pharaoh for letting you come and help me. Thank you for allowing me to show the strength of a Terror Grade expert temporarily to fool the others.”</p><p>“The Pharaoh has high hopes for you.” The big bearded man said in a stern voice. “There would be a large exercise in two months time and he would need your help.”</p><p>“That’s not a problem if I successfully absorbed it.” the man in a dull red cape smiled faintly and saw the big bearded man off to the side of an ancient coffin. He took off his clothes, wrapped himself in bandages and lay in it. His presence was lost instantly and he became a true ancient mummy.</p><p>“See, there’s no assaulter here and there’s only a mummy collection that Mr. Constantine, the collector, bought.” The man in dull red cape smiled. With the intention of answering his doubts and probing, he asked the man with brown eyes, “God Slayer, what’s your reason for working with me then?”</p><p>God Slayer touched his nose with his index finger and said, “Perhaps… Maybe… Having another “Terror Grade” bad guy in this world would be more interesting.”</p><p>At this point, the sounds of the doorbell ringing sounded from the surveillance system.</p><p>The man in dull red cape took a look and said, “It’s Lucas.”</p><p>As he finished his sentence, he opened the door to the collection room, returned to the living room and allowed Lucas, who was wearing a black robe and had green eyes, to enter.</p><p>“Why did the Grand Cultivator ask you to come?” The main in dull red cape asked.</p><p>Lucas looked plainly at him and said, “Constantine, the Grand Cultivator wanted me to tell you that you have a maximum of two days. In two days time, there will be at least ten Terror Grade experts, several teams of special forces equipped with man-made weapons and various kinds of high-tech equipment and even more special agents specializing in tracking arriving in Connecticut. Moreover, the uniqueness of the Holy Grail isn’t something that could be hidden for long.”</p><p>“You have to complete your absorption within this time and try your best to not damage it too badly. At that time, as long as we return it secretly, the security level will naturally decrease. If we let this situation carry on, no one will be able to take it.”</p><p>“Don’t think that you can leave if you don’t use the public roads. There are eyes in the sky that are looking. The fewer the people the location has, the more obvious it would be.</p><p>Constantine pondered for some time before raising the Holy Grail, smiled and continued, “Alright.”</p><p>…</p><p>Several days later, Lou Cheng acutely noticed that the security level of Connecticut had decreased from the news. Therefore he sent a message to Smith and asked.</p><p>“The Holy Grail has been retrieved? Those three Terror Grade assaulters have been caught?”</p><p>Just moments later, Smith replied, “Rumors had it that the Holy Grail was found in a rubbish bin and had some damage to it… As to the assaulters, they have only identified their details but we still haven’t found out who they are. God Slayer and Nightmare are among the assaulters. To sum it up, a conclusion is about to be reached for this incident.</p><p>Conclusion is about to be reached? So it just ended like this? Lou Cheng was rather surprised.</p><p>Such a serious matter and it was settled so simply? Or could it be that there is something hatching below the surface?</p><p>Before he could raise his doubts, Smith sent another message over, “Lou, I want your advice about something.”</p><p>“Say it.” Lou Cheng replied.</p><p>Smith said puzzledly, “I have been practicing based on the lesson plans for the awakening of supernatural ability and improvement of it. However, I haven’t experienced much progress for over a year and seems to be getting further and further away from reaching Terror Grade. Lou, do you have any good advice? Recently, I found that you are getting more and more mysterious and harder to predict.”</p><p>“Hmph. Find some spiders and let them bite you?” joked Lou Cheng.</p><p>“This isn’t funny at all…” Smith replied.</p><p>Lou Cheng pondered for some time before continuing, “The truth is that the strengthening of supernatural ability has some relation to strengthening “Own Self”. The greater your control over your own body, the deeper your understanding. I recommend you to try to awaken your “Own Spirit”.</p><p>“I’m from the Mission Sect!” Smith helplessly emphasized.</p><p>Why does it feel that Lou isn’t very reliable…</p><p>“Haha, you could take some reference from Dervish, a branch of the Mission Sect.” Lou Cheng decided not to tease him further.</p><p>After putting his phone down, he looked out of the window and a thought suddenly flashed passed.</p><p>If the incident with the Holy Grail ends like this, so be it. Ke will be having her semester-end examinations soon. After which, it would be to return to Songcheng to meet up with Master to look for the secret cave of the Longhu Immortal under the Weishui Lake!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
