Lou Cheng could only feel that his heart had calmed down. The void in his heart was filled to the brim and nicely stitched up.</p><p>Both of them didn’t speak a word and were immersed in the arms of the other. However the conservative genes deep in their core made them unable to act like other couples who could kiss intensely and behave as though no one was around them.</p><p>After what seemed like half a day, Yan Zheke pushed Lou Cheng away softly. She combed her rather messy hair, gave Lou Cheng a playful look and said,</p><p>“Let’s head out. Aunt Du is waiting for us. Let’s talk again when we go home.”</p><p>Yeah. Home.</p><p>“Alright!” Lou Cheng held on to the slim hand of Ke. Just like the days that had passed and as though the two of them had not been separated for a month at all.</p><p>With their ten fingers interlocked, they were holding each other tightly. Wearing unerasable smiles, the couple talked about the feelings they previously had while slowly walking out. They left the lobby and entered into the carpark.</p><p>Du Yan was standing beside the car. Seeing the two of them walking over, she smiled faintly and waved her hands.</p><p>“Aunt Du, this is Lou Cheng.” Yan Zheke pointed at her husband and smiled with a faint dimple.</p><p>“Good afternoon Aunt Du.” Lou Cheng immediately greeted with a faint smile.</p><p>“Great, Ke had been watching your matches frequently some time ago. I also managed to take a few peeks into it.” Du Yan shook her head while still maintaining a smile. “If my son is half as capable as you, I will even smile in my dreams.”</p><p>She took a look at the postures of the couple with the edge of her eyes. In her mind, she was astonished. The teenagers of this generation are more open than us. However since they have already been recognised by Elder Ji, have seen the parents and was just waiting for graduation before marriage, it’s inevitable that they are a little more intimate. Those in America are even worse and shocking!</p><p>After a brief chat, the two of them sat to the back of the car. As there was outsider around, they didn’t talk about how they felt after meeting up again. All they talked about was the experience Lou Cheng had in the long-distance flight and the interesting things that happened to Yan Zheke in the school.</p><p>The car drove smoothly into northern regions of Connecticut. This was a gathering place of the local wealthy families and police could be seen patrolling this area often. There were rarely any strangers around.</p><p>After driving past a grass field, they successfully arrived at the rented place where Yan Zheke was staying.</p><p>Looking at the color of the skies, Du Yan laughed, “You guys can get out first. I’ll go to the car garage and will be back to make dinner right away. The food on the plane isn’t tasty and the portion is too small.”</p><p>“Yeah!” Lou Cheng fully agreed with her.</p><p>Whether if it was tasty or not was dependent on the person’s taste. However the portion for him was indeed too little. He always has to ask for two more servings from the air stewardess. Even so, he was only thirty percent full.</p><p>His mind was just longing for Ke previously and didn’t feel hungry at all. As for now, he could already hear his stomach growling……</p><p>Yan Zheke also noticed it and was trying hard to contain her laughter. Pulling Lou Cheng out the car, they took huge strides towards the main door.</p><p>“You have to eat well. I’ll give you my portion too!” Her eyes were a little teary as she said softly.</p><p>“What about you?” How would Lou Cheng allow his little fairy to be hungry?</p><p>Yan Zheke pouted, twitched her nose and said with anger,</p><p>“I’m already four kilograms heavier! How would I dare to eat more?”</p><p>“Nope, I totally didn’t notice it when I was hugging you just now. Moreover with your current strength, this weight is a little too light.” Lou Cheng was trying to console Yan Zheke.</p><p>At least you know what not to say. If you really say that I’m fat, sneer! Yan Zheke’s eyes turned and continued,</p><p>“It’s true. It was still fine some time ago when I had short term language courses. However when school officially started, we have to match the courses with the SongCheng University. As a result, the schedule is tightly packed. Moreover the professors in this place are especially fond of giving homework. Sometimes we even have to be separated into groups for group work. In my group, there’s a girl that is burdening the group and making me really busy. I’ve been sleeping really late and do not have much time for training in the morning. My weight has been soaring up because of this!”</p><p>She waved her hands up to represent the changes to her weight.</p><p>“It’s still alright. I really don’t find you heavy.” Lou Cheng once again emphasized it. He wouldn’t say that he always found her a little too skinny. It would be better if she was a little fatter.</p><p>I’m a great teenager who has undergone various tricks from Coach Yan. How is it possible for me to commit a mistake on such a simple issue!</p><p>As they chatted, he followed Yan Zheke to the room in a two-story building. From the outside, one couldn’t tell what’s in it. However, it was decorated rather luxuriously on the inside.</p><p>“You can stay where my mom stayed. It’s on the second level just like mine. Aunt Du is staying at the ground level.” Yan Zheke was trying to introduce to Lou Cheng the arrangement for this period.</p><p>“Alright.” Lou Cheng nodded his head nonchalantly.</p><p>It doesn’t matter where I am staying. After all, I’ll be staying with you after a while. Just nice that Aunt Du is on level one and she wouldn’t be disturbing us!</p><p>Yan Zheke seemed to have noticed what he was thinking and stared at him.</p><p>“What are you thinking about!”</p><p>“About you.” Lou Cheng broke into laughter and found back his ability of sweet talking instantly.</p><p>“Nonsense, you are obviously thinking about dirty things!” mumbled Yan Zheke as she turned her head to the side.</p><p>Just as she was about to say something, Du Yan had walked in. Yan Zheke could only stop abruptly and talked to Lou Cheng about the customs and culture of the locals in Connecticut.</p><p>As they chatted, the ingredients cooked and soon, a sumptuous dinner was placed across the table.</p><p>Yan Zheke picked up her chopstick, ate only half a bowl of rice before putting down her cutleries. Resting her head on her hand, she was looking at Lou Cheng eating and drinking.</p><p>“Are you really not going to eat?” Lou Cheng asked caringly.</p><p>“Nope, I’m on a diet! When I get used to the curriculum after some time and have some free time for training, I’ll then return to my usual diet!” answered Yan Zheke with a serious and resolute face.</p><p>“Alright, why do I feel that you are having a tougher time studying overseas than at home?” exclaimed Lou Cheng.</p><p>Yan Zheke puffed up her cheeks and continued, “To do well in this place, there are a lot of assignments and reports. It’s totally different from what some people thought, where there are various things at play here. Moreover I have taken a lot of modules.”</p><p>So that I can complete my studies earlier, graduate earlier and go back and see you earlier……</p><p>“In that case, it’s even more important for you to do your training diligently. You will be even more attentive if you have a healthy body,” reminded Lou Cheng.</p><p>At this moment, Du Yan brought out another two plates of dishes. One of them had mashed potatoes in the middle with grilled skin around them. The aroma of it was filling the air. The other dish was tomato cow tail soup. The reddish colour was especially tempting.</p><p>“Cheng, this dish of Aunt Du’s is especially tasty.”</p><p>“Is it?” Lou Cheng was looking at her, waiting for her to help him to the food.</p><p>However Yan Zheke put the food into her own mouth. After chewing it slightly and feeling satisfied, she gobbled it down.</p><p>“I thought you are done?” teased Lou Cheng.</p><p>Yan Zheke tilted her chin and answered with righteousness,</p><p>“I’m helping you to taste if it is delicious!”</p><p>“Hmph, not bad. Aunt Du didn’t lose her standards. You can have it now!”</p><p>Lou Cheng immediately tried to contain his smile. He cleared his throat and asked,</p><p>“In that case, can you help me check out the other dishes too?”</p><p>Yan Zheke bit on her lips and had a complicated look. Finally, she closed her eyes, nodded slightly and continued, “Since you have such a strong request…”</p><p>At this point, she could no longer put on a front and started laughing first. The laughter was clear and propagated throughout. In the end, she said with a tinge of grudge,</p><p>“You have got to bring me for training tomorrow morning. Do you understand?”</p><p>Not waiting for Lou Cheng’s replies, she had already picked up a piece of braised beef and stuffed it in her mouth anxiously.</p><p>“Rest assured!” Lou Cheng was looking at his wife gently.</p><p>After they had a sumptuous meal, the two of them sat on the sofa and looked at Aunt Du clearing the dining table.</p><p>“Wait for a while and digest your food. I’ll bake some cake and biscuits for you later!” Yan Zheke was lying on the side of Lou Cheng and was ready to get up. She wanted to show the results of her hard work over this period of time.</p><p>“I look forward to it!” Lou Cheng was also full of interest regarding this.</p><p>“In that case, let me prepare the ingredients first.” Yan Zheke stood up, dragged on her slippers and headed to the kitchen. She was like a hardworking bee as she kept walking in and out of the kitchen. It was till then that Lou Cheng had calmed himself down from the intense emotions he felt earlier and noticed what Ke was wearing. It was different from before when all he had noticed was her every movement and smile instead of the surroundings.</p><p>So beautiful… His line of sight was moving together with the figures of the girl.</p><p>Yan Zheke was almost done and came back to him. Suddenly, he recalled something. He used his chin to point at the stairs, lowered his laughter and said,</p><p>Let’s go to your room first. I’ll pass your present to you.”</p><p>“Mm!” Yan Zheke’e eyes shimmered but she was trying to put on a reserved front while leading Lou Cheng to the second floor.</p><p>On the second floor, Lou Cheng put down his bag after entering her room. He opened the bag and pulled down the zipper. The first thing he took out was a book and said,</p><p>“Home Cooked Food from China! The present is light but the meaning is deeper!”</p><p>Seeing the cookbook and hearing what Lou Cheng said, Yan Zheke instantly burst into laughter. She sat by the side of the bed as she looked at the different things her husband was taking out.</p><p>“This is a Buddha token. I had it blessed in the Golden Buddha Temple for you. This is a branded bag that you previously talked about. This is a jade amulet with the “Fighting” Formula. The engravings were great and completely show the of never-give-up attitude. Moreover it has a great sentimental value. Nonetheless, don’t wear it. It is something stolen from the grave after all and isn’t auspicious. This is an amulet to keep you safe. It’s silver in color and I bought it in the Zheng Yun Ancient City…” Lou Cheng was introducing the various presents one after another just like he was introducing how he lived his past month. He was naggy and full of emotions. It was as though no matter where he went to, his heart was always with the girl.</p><p>Looking on, Yan Zheke started to feel a little drowsy. The light in her eyes was hidden and shimmering.</p><p>“Alright, that’s all.” Lou Cheng stopped his actions.</p><p>Yan Zheke looked up and stared blankly at him. The pair of eyes seemed to be filled with thousands of words, making Lou Cheng shiver in his mind.</p><p>Just as the atmosphere became affectionate, Yan Zheke suddenly found a few strange boxes in the bag of Lou Cheng through the side of her eyes.</p><p>“What are those?” Yan Zheke supported herself up and extend her arms into the bag.</p><p>Lou Cheng looked down and his face turned red immediately. Even if he wished to stop her, it was already too late.</p><p>Yan Zheke took those boxes out and looked at them. Instantly, her face turned red like the skies at a sunset. With a shy voice, she asked,</p><p>“You even bought such items!”</p><p>Cheng actually brought condoms over!</p><p>“Cough, I was thinking now that I am an Inhuman…” Lou Cheng steeled himself and acted like it was natural.</p><p>Yan Zheke sneered. She was trying to contain her shyness as she had never seen the real thing before. Feeling curious, she opened one of the boxes. Astonished, she asked,</p><p>“Why is there one missing?”</p><p>（1. For clarification, Connecticut is a fictional city in this story. Also referred to as “Con.
