It was because of this…”</p><p>She pondered for a few seconds, then stood up and walked to the French window with her phone in hand. Her dark hair cascaded to the center of her back like silk—a perfect match with her lace nightgown.</p><p>She looked at the unsleeping city—a flowing galaxy on Earth, then buzzed a number using a private satellite line.</p><p>A sluggish male voice answered after a series of beeps.</p><p>“Still awake?”</p><p>Irina drew a soft breath, peering into the distance. Trying to sound casual, she said, “Ge Hui, I met someone with a similar scent to the amulet you gave me—the scent of a starry sky.”</p><p>“What?” blurted the man on the other side. He fell silent. After a few seconds, he asked in a deep voice, “Who is it?”</p><p>“Lou Cheng. That Heavenly Son of China,” replied Princess Irina, narrowing her eyes. Her scarlet pupils reflected a thousand lights.</p><p>“…I got it,” the man said, then paused. “Don’t provoke him, and don’t draw his attention. I’ll take over from here.”</p><p>“Okay. I just wanted to let you know,” Irina chuckled. She then asked, “Is the sun in John Weilburg still as bright?”</p><p>Her bewitchingly beautiful face was impassive, devoid of even a ghost of a smile.</p><p>“Yeah, I’m suntanning right now. Was just about to fall asleep,” laughed the man.</p><p>They shot the breeze before hanging up. Irina remained standing by the French window. Pure white nightgown. Jet-black hair. Blood-red eyes.</p><p>She gazed into the distance. There was a deep and distant look in her eyes. She mused, almost inaudibly, “Ge He, are you related to this mystery?”</p><p>…</p><p>Aside from preventing accidents and ensuring the safety of the Samanno Royal Family, the Royal Security Team was also tasked with keeping watch on certain bloodline members, so that they did not run free and create havoc. It was a matter of national pride, and so the night passed uneventfully. Lou Cheng and Jia Lu both had an easy time.</p><p>It was the same for the second day. The schedule was tightly packed with events: excursion after the meeting, and a ball after the banquet.</p><p>Jia Lu tossed a glance at the beautiful and regal Irina. She drew a breath and clicked her tongue.</p><p>“Ssss… What on earth were you doing yesterday? Did the princess from Samanno Royal Family take an interest in you? She keeps on glancing at us, time and again.”</p><p>Lou Cheng pursed his lips, saying, “Interested in me? More like interested in fighting me! She’s also a Mighty One at a similar stage. I’m sure she’s just feeling the thrill of the hunt after finding a worthy match.”</p><p>He had researched her beforehand and knew the level and extent of Irina’s capabilities.</p><p>“Then why doesn’t she look at me?” retorted Jia Lu.</p><p>Right after that, she processed the words in her head and immediately grew petulant. “Nevermind, don’t answer that!”</p><p>The answer was simple. Lou Cheng was currently the Heavenly Son of China; his fame and reputation were widespread. She herself, on the other hand, had an entire career in the martial arts school, and never won any prestigious competitions. Even though she was fairly gifted and powerful, not many people knew her. To a princess of the Samanno Royal Family, she was just a nobody.</p><p>“I’m glad I don’t have to answer that…” jested Lou Cheng smilingly.</p><p>My answer would be—you are too weak… That would make Jia Lu go ballistic, wouldn’t it?</p><p>With her curiosity piqued, Jia Lu was about to get to the bottom of it when Irina ambled towards them with a glass of pale-gold champagne in her hand.</p><p>“Hey, hey! She’s here to throw down the gauntlet! Are you going to accept it?” Jia Lu asked with great interest. She was always up for drama when she herself wasn’t involved.</p><p>“I better check with Xue Jian first,” said Lou Cheng. He himself was a troublemaker and was quite tempted to give it a go.</p><p>Irina stopped before him. She had a voluptuous, hourglass-body. She smiled and asked, in English, “Lou. Has anyone ever told you that you have an amazing scent?”</p><p>…What kind of movie script is this? Miss, did you mess up your line? Lou Cheng was stunned. Wasn’t this about sparring?</p><p>A few seconds later, when he was himself again, he shook his head in confusion.</p><p>“Never.”</p><p>Ke Ke often said that I’m smelly though…</p><p>Irina creased her thin brows slightly, then broke into a smile. “What a pity.”</p><p>With that, she didn’t linger any longer and returned to the center of the banquet hall.</p><p>“What’s she on about?” Lou Cheng turned to Jia Lu in confusion.</p><p>Jia Lu was equally dazed, her bright and moist eyes filled incomprehension. After a few seconds, she laughed, as though she understood.</p><p>“Do you want me to translate the real meaning of those words to you?”</p><p>“Let’s hear it.” Even after much thought, Lou Cheng was still puzzled.</p><p>“To put it simply, your conversation went something like this,” Jia Lu paused, then smiled in a sardonic way. “Wanna hook up? No thanks!”</p><p>“Come on, be serious…” Lou Cheng never realized Jia Lu was this type of girl and was almost rendered speechless.</p><p>Normally, she looked like the type that was feisty on the outside but cold and aloof inside, the kind that liked drama but didn’t like involving herself. Who would have thought she had this side to her…</p><p>Jia Lu chuckled. “I’m serious! If she’s not inviting you to hook up, why would she begin by complimenting your smell? Shouldn’t she at least begin by talking about the weather, or the dishes served during dinner? If you had replied ‘You are the first’ or ‘Is that so? Can you describe it to me?”, then you would have had a chance to bed a princess tonight! Though they have to leave for the airport later, there is enough time if you think about it. Are you feeling regretful now?”</p><p>She was very much intrigued since it was her first time experiencing something like that.</p><p>“Thank goodness I didn’t answer correctly…” Lou Cheng wiped the non-existant cold sweat on his forehead. He actually found some sense in what Jia Lu said.</p><p>Had he replied without thinking and got tangled up with that Princess Irina, he wouldn’t be able to clear his name even if he dived into the Yellow River! How then, could he face his little fairy?!</p><p>I’m not exactly handsome, and my manners are just that of a gentle and reserved Mighty One. As for a scent, I have no idea what she’s talking about! Is Irina approaching me to add me to her ‘collection’, or does she have ulterior motives? What if she’s like one of those vampire from novels? Maybe the Samannos Royal Family members are capable of creating something great by ingesting my blood?</p><p>Lou Cheng’s thoughts raced, thinking about the endless possibilities.</p><p>Nothing else happened in the time that followed, and after the farewell banquet, the Samannos Royal family arrived at the airport and departed from China.</p><p>“Alright, that’s the end of your mission. Thank you both so much,” Xue Jian said to Lou Cheng and Jia Lu through the earphone.</p><p>“Whew, freedom at last,” Jia Lu said as she removed her walkie-talkie. Looking towards Lou Cheng, she said, “Can’t wait for tomorrow to come so I can head to the club training ground and practice my kungfu.”</p><p>“Me too,” Lou Cheng assented with a smile.</p><p>Jia Lu’s thoughts jumped to something else. Out of a sudden, she said, “You and I, we haven’t sparred against each other, right? How about we abolish the lot drawing on Friday? I’ll challenge you directly!”</p><p>She wanted to truly experience the strength of the current Heavenly Son of China. She could only catch up to him after finding out the gap between them!</p><p>“This week… Not this week. Another time,” rejected Lou Cheng after thinking.</p><p>“Why? Someone booked you in advance?” asked Jia Lu curiously.</p><p>Lou Cheng replied in a joyful tone. “I have something on on Friday afternoon. I’ll be excusing myself.”</p><p>“Okay.” Without dwelling on the topic, Jia Lu resumed her detached and indifferent disposition.</p><p>…</p><p>After Lou Cheng received another round of guidance from the Physical Invulnerability Mighty Ones, time passed quickly, and in the blink of an eye it was Friday once more.</p><p>Since he left his home and took the multi-purpose vehicle to the club in the morning, he had been smiling from time to time. Towards Auman and Huang Bin’s hoary pleasantries, he was not in the least bit annoyed, and even took the initiative to make small talk. He told them that he wouldn’t be having dinner at the restaurant and would be leaving at two pm, and that it would be great if they could arrange a car for him, but it wouldn’t matter even if they couldn’t.</p><p>Auman and Huang Bin, too busy to speculate why he was in such a great mood, immediately assented to his requests, both doing their best to leave a good impression.</p><p>After spending an afternoon in the Dan Stage training room, Lou Cheng’s efficiency was even better than usual. In the afternoon, he had a great appetite and ate more than he usually did.</p><p>Just as he was about to pack up his stuff and take a break in his private resting room, Auman scuttled into the room and made an announcement to all the Inhuman Mighty Ones. “The registration for Battle of the Kings is now open. This year, it will commence on August 19th. Which of you is interested in joining?”</p><p>The requirement set by Longhu Club for its Reserve Team members was that they had to attend at least 3 preliminary matches for National Title Competitions. As to which ones they wanted to attend, they had complete freedom.</p><p>“I am. It’s a rare opportunity for me to fight against friends in the same league.” Tu Zheng volunteered first.</p><p>Lou Cheng raised his hand, saying, “I would like to join too.”</p><p>Back when he joined the club, they had already made it clear to him that he was to first practice the Fire Sect Dan Stage Chapters, then attend the preliminary matches for Battle of the Kings and digest what he had learned through actual combat.</p><p>“If the both of you are going, then count me in as well,” said Yu Wangyuan, Sun Jianlin, Lu Shaofei, and Jia Lu. Even an Inhuman Mighty One who wasn’t a member of the Reserve Team registered. He had already transferred to a managerial position.</p><p>Inhuman was a stage that was in the middle of nowhere. It did not attract international attention or have a great following like Physical Invulnerability, but neither did it have the down-to-earth feeling of Body Refining stage and low-tiered Dan Stage. It was always stuck somewhere in the middle, and didn’t have its own professional competitions. Currently, the preliminary matches for the five supreme national title competitions was deemed to have the highest standards for competition between Inhumans.</p><p>Almost every up and coming fighter from the top-tiered sects and other Inhuman Mighty Ones from other sects would attend, but they prioritised differently. Currently, Battle of the Kings and Warrior Sage Battle were the type that almost no one wanted to miss. Once someone made it through the preliminary phase, it was almost as good as announcing that they were the cream of the crop among the ones belong Physical Invulnerability!</p><p>After submitting their applications, Auman gave a flowery smile.</p><p>“This time around, the Battle of Kings will have 16 participants in the preliminary phase. I wish everyone the best of luck to proceed into the main competition and have the chance to fight against Physical Invulnerability Mighty Ones.”</p><p>Whew… No matter how good you think you are, there’s always someone out there better than you. Putting aside those from the same age group, it’s not going to be easy dealing with the seniors who had been Inhumans for years, or even tens of years… The thought flitted across Lou Cheng’s mind and died away. Anyway, he still had more than a month.</p><p>After packing up and taking a break, he got into the multi-purpose vehicle with all smiles, then left the club.</p><p>The most important task of today was to go to airport and fetch Ke Ke, his precious wife!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
