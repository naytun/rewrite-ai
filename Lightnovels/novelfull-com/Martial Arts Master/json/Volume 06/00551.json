After making a brief introduction, she left the first floor of the North-west region. As for Lou Cheng, he roughly recognized who the other members of the reserve team were.</p><p>Excluding Yu Wangyuan and Lu Shaofei, who also stayed in Sky Capital Garden, and the Captain of the reserve team Tu Zheng, who occasionally represented the Longhu Club in the top end professional competitions, there were still a man and a woman.</p><p>The guy’s last name was Sun and his first name was Jianlin. He was of average build but his muscles were solid and strong. He didn’t have any extraordinary facial features and had the looks of a standard person. However as an inhuman expert, there was a hidden glow in his gaze. His actions were full of confidence and the charisma of a man. Overall, he wasn’t much inferior to a guy with good looks.</p><p>The woman’s name was Jia Lu. She had watery eyes that weren’t gentle. She had the habit of standing at the edge of the group and looking as though she was an observer, indifferent about anything else.</p><p>Based on Empress Luo’s, Ning Zitong, introduction, the five of them were all below thirty years old. The oldest of them was Tu Zheng and he was twenty-eight years old. He had a great chance of making the great leap and achieving physical invulnerability. The youngest of them was Jia Lu and she was twenty-four years old. She had achieved a breakthrough in the spring season and reached the inhuman stage. After which, she was moved from the “Dan stage” team to the reserve team. As for the rest, Yu Wangyuan and Sun Jianlin were both twenty-seven years old and had held their fourth-pin certifications for two years. Lu Shaofei was twenty-five years old and had passed the certification assessment recently in April.</p><p>Anyone of them, if brought to big sects like the Wuyue Club, would have great potential to fight for the top two positions. Yet, there were five of them in the Longhu Club!</p><p>Other than that, there were still several people who were at their level or just slightly inferior who were attached to affiliated clubs and had great relationships with the Longhu Club. In February or March each year, the core team would reconsider which members would stay behind to push towards physical invulnerability, which members would be sent out for additional trials and which members should be assigned appropriate missions to familiarize themselves before they went into management or the military.</p><p>One could feel the strength of the Longhu Club just from the number of inhumans who were below the age of thirty. There’s no wonder that they were among the most elite class!</p><p>Lou Cheng chatted with them for a while. After confirming his dedicated resting room with the help of Tu Zhen, he walked into the Dan stage training room and started pondering about the visualization diagrams of the Fire sect and the explanation of each move. At the same time, he also wrote notes about each member of the reserve team. Every single one of the members had their dedicated resting room on the first floor of the North-east region. Each of the small rooms was seventy square meters.</p><p>Lou Cheng did not do any training between nine thirty in the morning and eleven in the morning. Based on his own learning habits, he roughly went through the Dan stage skills of the Fire Sect and had the confidence about the overall sense.</p><p>As one of the five sects of Taoism, the Dan stage martial arts of the Fire sect consisted of over a hundred different kinds. However, there were many repeated types and even more types that were no longer suitable for the current times. They weren’t meant to be learned but could be used to open up one’s horizon and understanding the train of thoughts of the creator in the past. This could help one to understand the essence through learning from similar things.</p><p>After such a filtering process, Lou Cheng identified that there were only twenty-three Dan stage unique skills that he had to learn. Part of them used the technique of force.</p><p>Lifting his head from the stacks of paper, he picked up his phone and took a glance at the time. After which, he walked out of the training room and returned to his dedicated resting room. SItting on the sofa, he started the video conference with Ke.</p><p>In his scheduled plans, eleven thirty to twelve thirty each day would be the time slot specifically reserved for his cross-border relation. Unless there were very special events, this would not be changed.</p><p>It was summer in Connecticut, America. The corresponding time here was around ten to eleven o’clock at night. It was also the time of the day when Yan Zheke was most free and the period before she went to sleep. However there were always exceptions. Due to some delay by a member in her project group, she still had some way to go for the report she had to submit the next day. She estimated that she would take another two hours.</p><p>However she did not mention this and started the video conferencing with Lou Cheng enthusiastically. They chatted about his initial experience at the Longhu club and the several physical invulnerability experts who all had unique characteristics.</p><p>Yeah! In this world, nothing is more important than chatting and “dating” with Cheng!</p><p>In the worse case, I can just burn the midnight oil a little later. I’m Heroine Yan who had mastered the “Wholeness” Formula!</p><p>As for the fact that my report isn’t completed, I will wait till the end of the video conference before telling Cheng. Otherwise, he would be concerned and nag at me!</p><p>…</p><p>There were various kinds of facilities in the training ground of the reserve team in the North-west region.</p><p>“Captain Tu, Lou Cheng left the training room and has returned to his dedicated resting room at just eleven in the morning.” Yu Wangyuan, who had a round face, said to Tu Zheng in a soft manner after “sneaking” back inside. “It had only been a little over an hour!”</p><p>Although he was acting like he was controlling his voice, the truth was that he was just going through the actions. He didn’t direct his voice directly to Tu Zheng and spoke as softly as a mosquito buzz. Lu Shaofei, Sun Jianlin and Jia Lu all directed their attention there. After hearing him, they slowed down and quietly listened on.</p><p>Tu Zheng smiled and laughed, “He’s one of the Heavenly sons of the era. Perhaps an hour or more of training of his is equivalent to a day of training for us?”</p><p>“He has his talents but we are all hardworking. There’s no point in us being envious. Let’s continue our training. If there’s any part you all can’t understand, let’s discuss it together! Oh right, I have something going on in the afternoon. You guys can arrange for your plans.”</p><p>His eyes became relaxed and his moves were smoother and more natural.</p><p>…</p><p>Twelve thirty in the afternoon, after hearing that his little fairy girl still had to rush for a report, Lou Cheng found it hilarious and infuriating but was both touched and feeling a little heartache.</p><p>However he didn’t nag about this. Based on what he had learned from Little Ming, he had to let the girl feel that she was giving something in the relationship from time to time. Otherwise, the relationship wouldn’t last.</p><p>After instructing her about some things, Lou Cheng went to a restaurant. He walked towards the Xing Province food area and picked up a large bowl. He filled it with over twenty steamed rolls, steamed meats, fried meat shreds and other dishes. In the end, he also got a large bowl of bitter bamboo soup with pieces of meat. Lou Cheng wasn’t particularly fond of the taste of bitter bamboo but the soup made from it was extremely refreshing and sweet. It was appetizing and helped in fighting the summer heat. As for the pieces of meat, they were tender and delicious. Dipping them in sauces would go well with the rice.</p><p>Other than that, he also went to the Guangnan region and took a roasted goose. The skin was sweet and the meat was aromatic. Although it was fat, it wouldn’t make him feel sick from eating it.</p><p>After eating, Lou Cheng got a bowl of green bean with soy milk as dessert. He drank it quickly to relieve the taste of the meat left in his mouth.</p><p>Suddenly he recalled something. He took out his phone and sent a message to Fatty Jiang, “Is tonight still on?”</p><p>“On!” Jiang Fei replied quickly. “I’m waiting to rip a good meal from a local tyrant! What time?”</p><p>“Let’s make it six thirty in the evening at the school gate. Send me the location.” Lou Cheng picked up the watermelon slices and bite into it.</p><p>Fatty Jiang should be around the University town?</p><p>After confirming, Lou Cheng originally intended to send a WeChat message to inform Auman to tell the kitchen not to prepare his dinner. However after thinking about it, he chose to directly call to the Assistant team’s office.</p><p>“Hello, you are?” A guy with a strong Guangnan accent said.</p><p>“I’m Lou Cheng.,” Lou Cheng stated his identity in a simple manner.</p><p>“Good afternoon. Is there something Mr. Lou would like to instruct?” The guy suddenly was more enthusiastic.</p><p>“I have something on at night and wouldn’t be having my dinner in the club. I will also not return to the Sky Capital Garden tonight.,” explained Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Ok, I will inform the “Logistics” team and the “Cars” team right away. Mr Lou, may I know approximately what time would you be leaving? Where are you going? I can help you coordinate the use of the car.,” asked the guy sincerely.</p><p>Every physical invulnerability stage expert had a dedicated “nanny car”. As for inhuman stage experts, three cars were shared among them. If there was an empty car, anyone could just use it. If there was no empty car, there was nothing to be said. However under normal circumstances, the resources were still rather ample. This was because Tu Zheng and the rest all had their own car. It was just that sometimes they were too lazy to drive them.</p><p>“I will be heading to the University town at about six thirty in the evening.” Lou Cheng had initially intended to hail a car using the phone app. However since this was part of his benefits, he should just use it!</p><p>“Alright, I will coordinate it right away.” The guy grabbed the opportunity and continued, “Please write down my number. I will send you a message to confirm in just a while. My name is Huang Bin. My number is… Forget it. I will not trouble you. I will just send you a message directly.”</p><p>“Alright.” Lou Cheng did not reject his offer.</p><p>The attitude of the employee from the Assistant team is really good!</p><p>In the office of the Assistant team, Huang Bin, who had a seven-three split hairstyle, edited the message in high spirits. After typing in the number and name and going through the content of the message, he sent it to Lou Cheng.</p><p>After which, he quickly started coordinating the use of the cars so he could arrange to have the best car reserved for Lou Cheng.</p><p>To him, this was a great opportunity!</p><p>There was a supervisor and vice-supervisor, as well as the personal assistants to physical invulnerability experts in the Assistant team. Their incomes were very high and they had the status and authority. It was especially so for the personal assistants. Sometimes, they were equivalent to spokesmen or spokeswomen for the physical invulnerability stage experts. There were always people crowding around them no matter where they went and even the officials and their bosses would be trying to get in their good books!</p><p>As for those that serviced the reserve team and the Dan stage team, they had no fixed personnel to follow and therefore were unable to enjoy the same treatments as those who followed the physical invulnerability stage experts. They were considered as ordinary employees. Although their remuneration wasn’t bad, it was just average. With the house prices in the City of Flowers, it would be wishful thinking for them to buy a property here. Many people could do such jobs and they were highly replaceable. Therefore their remuneration couldn’t be compared to those designated assistant to physical invulnerability stage experts.</p><p>Among those that were on the reserve team, those that had the chances of reaching physical invulnerability was Tu Zheng and Lou Cheng. The former had a good relationship with Sun Tingting and had been looking for her if he encountered anything. As for the latter, he had just joined the club. He was still foreign to the things here. Therefore it was clear who would be easier to get on the good books of.</p><p>As long as I can be recognized by Lou Cheng and become someone he can trust, when he makes the great leap and appoints me as his personal assistant, wouldn’t I reach the peak of my peak?</p><p>In the past, in order to get the mission to fetch Lou Cheng, they had an intense contest over it. In the end, the rookie with the least experience, Auman, benefitted from it.</p><p>As for now, the opportunity is here!</p><p>…</p><p>Lou Cheng couldn’t have been able to know about what Huang Bin was plotting and couldn’t be bothered to care about it. For the whole afternoon, he stayed in the training room to visualize the diagrams and thought about the techniques. The more he practiced, the more he was surprised and excited.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Standing within the training ground, he struck consecutive straight punches at the void, causing flames with each strike.</p><p>The hundred and thirteenth move of the Fire Sect, “Scorch”!</p><p>“This move might look simple but the techniques behind it are rather mystical. The more I think and practice, the more I feel that I am lacking in something…” Reflecting on how he used such techniques in everyday life, he could only feel that times had changed.</p><p>There are indeed moves that have been honed and refined by generations after generations of experts. The Dragon King has also made some improvement! These can really be considered as thoroughly refined!</p><p>Five thirty in the evening, Lou Cheng managed to pull himself out of what he was so into previously. After taking a shower and resting for a while, he took his bag and walked to the main door.</p><p>Based on what Huang Bin had said, there would be a car waiting for him there.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
