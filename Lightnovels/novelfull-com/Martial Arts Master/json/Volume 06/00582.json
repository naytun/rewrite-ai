While Aunt Du was preparing dinner, Lou Cheng dragged Yan Zheke to the second floor and from his bag rifled out the photocopied version of Ge Hui’s cultivation manual. Turning serious, he said, “Read through the front part, then rid yourself of all unnecessary thoughts using the Confrontation Formula. After that, practice using these techniques. It will sharpen your mind and refine your body in a special way.”</p><p>In cultivation, there were exclusive body refining methods. The external training resembles that of Martial Arts, but the internal training relies on your mind and visualizations.</p><p>Nodding, Yan Zheke took the manual and began poring over the pages, occasionally consulting Lou Cheng. At length, she kicked off her slippers, crossed her legs and got into a meditating position. In her mind, she began visualizing the Confrontation Formula she recently mastered. She could feel her thoughts subsiding, her body and mind entering a pure and clear state.</p><p>Then, with the instructions on the manual and Lou Cheng’s whispered guidance, she began conditioning her internal organs, lowering her ‘heart flames’ and thickening her ‘kidney water’, a process that refined and nourished her mind. After reaching a limit, she visualized something else. Facilitating the harmonization of the five elements with her mind, she refined different nodes of her body to strengthen them.</p><p>After about twenty minutes, she opened her eyes again. Her jet-black eyes were gleaming with energy.</p><p>“Not too bad…” Yan Zheke gave a dimpled smile when she saw Lou Cheng staring at her intently.</p><p>She looked up and pouted.</p><p>“Cheng, are you sure you want to teach this to George and the others? Putting aside the fact that they couldn’t enter Solemn Silence, make visualizations, or rid themselves of unnecessary thoughts, it would be extremely challenging for them to even comprehend these complex Taoist terms! How do we explain abstract Taoist terms like ‘heart flames’, ‘kidney water’, ‘Longhu’, and ‘Kanli’?”</p><p>“…” Lou Cheng didn’t have an answer to that.</p><p>He had taken into consideration their inability to enter Solemn Silence and made preparations, but comprehending the manual was a lot trickier.</p><p>Based on the Chinese text alone, he himself barely understood it, not to mention he had foundations built from contacting similar materials in the past few years. Earlier, when he was explaining it to Ke Ke, he almost broke into a sweat, his sequela freezing and scorching himself once each.</p><p>If this were to be translated into English, wouldn’t it be like an alien manuscript?</p><p>Seeing her husband’s dilemma, Yan Zheke said in contemplation, “We have to extract the core idea and express it in a straightforward way, using only modern vocabulary! It might not be a hundred percent accurate, but what’s important is that it conveys the meaning!”</p><p>She then volunteered herself.</p><p>“Here, let me help you.”</p><p>They huddled together, their hair occasionally rubbing against each other as they began the tedious translation process.</p><p>This lasted until 10:30 pm. They worked tirelessly, not even taking a break during dinner.</p><p>“Whew, finally done.” Yan Zheke stretched animatedly.</p><p>However, her ‘finally done’ only referred to the first segment! Lou Cheng stretched his neck. He then fetched pen and paper and used the writing desk as support. With a focused mind and steady breathing, he visualized the ancient character while effortlessly writing down the word Confrontation that had the effect of cleansing the heart and soul.</p><p>“Thank goodness I managed to do it in one fell swoop,” he said, flapping the piece of paper in delight.</p><p>Completing a task related to training before his sequela caught up to him made him feel as though he was back to normal.</p><p>Sadly, it would seem that he had spoken too early. Before he could finish his sentence, an ice cold sensation came over him, as though he had fallen into a rifter. He froze on the spot like a statue.</p><p>Recovering after seven or eight seconds, he laughed, pretending as if nothing had happened.</p><p>“This can forcefully make them enter Solemn Silence!”</p><p>“Mhm-hmm,” replied Yan Zheke. Her eyes were on him the whole time, not once averting her gaze or turning away, indicating that she was already comfortable with it and treated it as a daily occurrence. Lou Cheng did not realize it himself, but her actions had made his melancholy and frustration drift away.</p><p>After freshening up, the girl, wearing a low-cut nightgown, slipped into the sheets and snuggled up to Lou Cheng. Suddenly she felt his skin burning-hot, his muscles taut like rocks. It was clear that he was currently experiencing the scorching sequela.</p><p>Just as she was about to extend a cooling hand to absorb some of his heat, Lou Cheng relaxed and heaved a corrupted breath.</p><p>Turning to her, Lou Cheng smiled gently. “I should be fine for the rest of the night.”</p><p>His bright smile pretending that everything was fine made Yan Zheke’s heart tighten. She quickly curved her lips, barely managing to stop her eyes from reddening.</p><p>“Here, your little fairy will kiss you goodnight~”</p><p>Moving on her own, she looped her hands around Lou Cheng’s waist, her brilliant eyes half-closed, and delivered her lips to him.</p><p>Skin touching, her faint aroma permeated Lou Cheng’s nostrils. Lou Cheng’s venturing tongue parted her pearlescent teeth and danced with her nimble tongue.</p><p>Ever since he got injured, they had been mindful of his physical and mental state. The kisses they shared every day merely became a greeting ritual, not ever advancing any further than that. Right now, hope had shed their burdens, and their tongues passionately tangled. It was as though they were back to the time before the Battle of the Kings. Tacitly, they exchanged their worries, sorrows, pain, and dejection. The emotions that were normally stowed and hidden behind laughter received comfort and dispersed.</p><p>Their heart-to-heart communication involved little lust. After sharing a kiss, they locked eyes and linked their hands, both feeling as though a weight was lifted off their shoulders.</p><p>“Goodnight,” said Yan Zheke, her eyes glimmering like the stars.</p><p>“Goodnight,” crooned Lou Cheng, a smile spreading across his face.</p><p>They lied down properly once more. Yan Zheke, remembering something a few minutes later, suddenly said, “Are you still awake, Cheng? I have a serious academic problem that I would like to discuss with you.”</p><p>What piqued Ke Ke’s curiosity? Lou Cheng tiled his head quizzically.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“Right now, your bones and muscles are still fragile, so they wouldn’t permit you to engage in vigorous exercises. Supposing, um, supposing your sequela hasn’t gone away—has yet to go away—when you begin formal training, would it, would it manifest when we are doing…that?” said Yan Zheke.</p><p>She slowly turned her back to Lou Cheng as she spoke, facing the wall as though she was reflecting.</p><p>“Ah…” Lou Cheng only caught on after a moment, unsure if he should laugh or sigh. “Theoretically speaking, yes.”</p><p>“Then-then I’ll have to take the initiative and work harder on my part…” Her voice dropped to a whisper.</p><p>If Cheng always had to hold it in, it would only add to his frustration and make it harder for him to accept his new reality…</p><p>Lou Cheng went still. He knew how much courage it must have taken for his prim little fairy to speak of such matters.</p><p>Honestly, if Ke Ke had not mentioned it, he might really be troubled when the time comes and shy away from attempting, which could only sadden him more.</p><p>“Mhm!” He nodded hard. He felt rather ashamed of a teasing thought that flashed past earlier, feeling that it was disrespectful towards Ke Ke’s thoughtfulness.</p><p>…</p><p>On the afternoon next day, at the Martial Arts Club.</p><p>George and Wildon were sparring in the boxing ring when they heard a chorus of exclamations. They stopped and turned to look. Appearing at the doorstep was no other than the powerful martial artist who was rumored to be heavily wounded, along with his girlfriend.</p><p>“Long time no see, Lou!” Thrilled, George hopped down from the ring and rushed to him. His golden hair fluttering in the air, and sweat dripped from his body.</p><p>On his bare arm, there was a new tattoo of the mystical Eastern beast, Hou!</p><p>Lou Cheng nodded his greetings. When they have all gathered around him, he scanned around him and cut to the chase.</p><p>“Has anyone succeeded in entering Solemn Silence?”</p><p>The question rapidly dampened the mood. Everyone fell silent.</p><p>“No,” replied Colleen, the Caucasian girl, dipping her head in shame.</p><p>“No. None of us did,” admitted the freckled Wildon sullenly.</p><p>Weren’t Chinese known for their customary exchange of pleasantries, like talking about the weather or inquiring if the other party has eaten? Why must Lou begin with such a gloomy question?</p><p>“So none of you did…” Lou Cheng nodded slowly. He cut to the chase. “I recently acquired a new technique and is thinking of combining it with my own kungfu. However, I’m already past a certain stage, and I don’t want to rashly try something so profound in fear of any harmful effects. Is anyone interested in learning it? It will make entering Solemn Silence easier, and also improve your aptitude for martial arts, enhancing your combat abilities. Of course, since it’s something new, I cannot guarantee that it’s safe. On the contrary, I have to warn you that it might cost you your entire martial arts career if anything goes wrong.”</p><p>George and the others listened with intervals of astonishment. The possibility of gain excited them, but the severe and frightening consequences made them wary.</p><p>At length, George asked hesitantly, “What kind of technique is it? Which Sect did it come from?”</p><p>“It originated from a division of an ancient Taoist Sect in China. The practitioners were known as Taoist Priests…” Lou Cheng explained vaguely.</p><p>Wildon, Colleen, and the others exchanged indecisive glances, but none could make up their mind. A few minutes passed before George, gritting his teeth, stood forward.</p><p>“I’m willing to give a shot!”</p><p>He then turned to the other club members and declared loudly, “Do you really think you can still become stronger? That there’s still hope?”</p><p>We couldn’t even have a basic mastery over what is taught in Martial Arts Sects over here or the ones in China!</p><p>Things couldn’t get any worse than this!</p><p>What if we encounter a miracle?</p><p>Galvanized, Wildon and the others cleared away their doubts and joined in one by one.</p><p>Lou Cheng nodded slightly, signaling Yan Zheke to spread the scroll that contained the Confrontation word. He made the Martial Arts Club members sit in a lotus position while staring at it.</p><p>The essence of painting infiltrated and affected their minds. The Caucasian girl, Colleen, gradually felt her heart beginning to lighten, a sensation similar to what she felt when she saw the gem the time she first began learning martial arts. But it was even more calming, and it was as though her mind was completely blank.</p><p>Amazing! The thought almost made her lose the magical feeling.</p><p>Unlike before, Lou Cheng did not ask them to try to understand anything from it, and instead guided them to get rid of their unnecessary thoughts in a sonorous and rhythmic voice.</p><p>In the parking lot outside the Martial Arts Stadium, Smith listened to the tutorial through his earphones.</p><p>“Imagine a puddle of water in your kidney…”</p><p>“Imagine a flame burning in your heart, just that it’s not real…”</p><p>…</p><p>The more he listened, the more confused Smith got. Subconsciously, he muttered the following words in fluent Chinese:</p><p>“Shen me gui?” (What the hell?)</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
