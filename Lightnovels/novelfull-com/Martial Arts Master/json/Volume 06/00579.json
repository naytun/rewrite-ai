For a top tier professional ninth-pin like Yan Zheke, the distance between them was only just a stride. The moment she saw Lou Cheng was stunned, she felt something was wrong. She immediately strode ahead and held on to her husband and asked with concern.</p><p>Lou Cheng heaved out a breath, consolidated his thoughts, forced a smiled and answered without hiding anything, “It’s probably the effects of sequela.”</p><p>He clearly described his previous loss of control. In the end, he concluded, “I was probably too exhausted at that time and my body was in a state of innate emptiness. Under the double blow of my exploitation and the external hits I’m receiving, the Jindan probably mutated and expanded. As a result, it merged with my innate source of preliminary energy. However since it was an external thing after all, the two sources conflicted, which resulted in rejection. From time to time, I would experience energy backflow. Previously it was chilled and it might be scorching heat in just a while.”</p><p>Previously, when he got off the bed with the help of Yan Zheke and regained his preliminary ability to walk, such a situation had not occurred. Today, he walked a little further and the volume of his exercise was slightly higher than usual. Suddenly, such experience appeared. Could this be an indication that the effects of sequela were triggered by the exhaustion one experienced?</p><p>If this was the case and I couldn’t recover fully, will this mean that I will not be able to able to participate in battles in the future?</p><p>In the intense competition with punches and kicks, “chills” and “scorching heat” that last over ten seconds would only signify failure.</p><p>Could it be that the sequela would result in me having the realm but not having the corresponding ability? Am I just a “handicapped” martial artist?</p><p>Various thoughts flashed past his mind, making it harder and harder for Lou Cheng to take it.</p><p>“There’s no such saying of an innate source of energy currently…” Yan Zheke rebutted subconsciously. However when she recalled her own conditions, she was silent again.</p><p>This region was still unexplored by modern medical technologies. Congenital deficiencies belonged to part of this too.</p><p>With hundreds of thousands of thoughts revolving around her mind, she looked up, thought carefully about it before adding, “If you really experience the effects of high temperature and had repeated relapses, it might really be as what you have said. However…”</p><p>She kept her lips tight before continuing, “However, that’s pretty good too! When we gather all Nine Words Formulas and the complete Immortality Practice manual, you can attempt to direct the Jindan and slowly ingest it! This might be your opportunity to break through to the physical invulnerability stage!”</p><p>Being influenced by the optimism of his little fairy girl, the heavy feeling Lou Cheng felt in his heart was relieved substantially. He nodded his head in approval and said, “I might not need the full set of Nine Word Formulas. When my body has recovered and I will be able to do Force Concentration, and I might just be able to slowly ingest the Jindan.”</p><p>He tried his best to make himself appear full of confidence.</p><p>Yeah, in the worst scenario, it would just mean that he wouldn’t be able to participate in practical battles and he had to leave the martial arts circle. At least he wouldn’t be a useless guy who couldn’t even attend to his every day life. He would not become a burden to Ke and his parents!</p><p>“You are right!” Yan Zheke nodded her head slightly. Suddenly, she recalled something and reminded anxiously, “Cheng, give a call to Coach Shi and Dragon King quickly. Tell them about the effects of the sequela and request for them to arrange you to have an examination in a military base. Perhaps they might have another solution.”</p><p>“Yeah. There’s no rush in this. What if it was just a one-off event? Let’s do it after confirming.” Many thoughts were rushing through Lou Cheng’s mind and he was trying his best to force a smile. “Moreover, my body is really weak now. When I get slightly better, perhaps the effects of the sequela will be milder and won’t be a concern!”</p><p>There’s always this probability!</p><p>Various martial arts manuals in the past had similar records. After suffering an energy backflow, one might feel cold or heat once a day at twelve midnight and twelve in the afternoon respectively for fifteen minutes each. It wouldn’t affect every day’s battle and in the worst case, it would only weaken him slightly. The chances of reaching physical invulnerability would be slim. Moreover, he would have to be on guard during that time to prevent his enemies from attacking him during that time… If he was to really become like those in the records, this was also something that he could accept…</p><p>The bitter feeling welled up as Lou Cheng agreed with what Yan Zheke said. “Let me go to the washroom first.”</p><p>“Alright.” Yan Zheke followed behind closely and stood at the door of the washroom. Her body was slanted and in position to prevent any accidents from happening if he was to faint on the toilet.</p><p>The optimism on her face faded as she subconsciously bit her lips.</p><p>Swish. Lou Cheng pulled up his pants and turned on the tap.</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly felt a heated flow raging through his body. It was like a raging flame that tore through his five organs and six viscerals. The pain in his muscles and tendons was extraordinary.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, beads of perspiration appeared on Lou Cheng’s forehead. However, he held all these in and didn’t make a sound. He felt that he could faint anytime now.</p><p>After seven to eight seconds, the “high temperature” subsided. He peeked at Yan Zheke who was at the side of the door. Using both of his hands, he cleaned off his perspiration on his face and walked out as though nothing had happened. Yan Zheke followed closely on the side of him.</p><p>After taking two steps, Yan Zheke noticed that a huge portion of the back of Lou Cheng was drenched in perspiration.</p><p>So much sweat… A thought flashed passed and she suddenly understood. She kept her lips closed tightly and tried hard not to make a voice. In her eyes, tears gathered.</p><p>Taking a breath in, she caught up and smile radiantly, “Your steps are getting steadier.”</p><p>“Of course. I’m an expert with the realm of All Seeing God!” Lou Cheng replied with a smile.</p><p>“You are indeed my Cheng!” Yan Zheke looked away and said, “I still think that it would be better to tell Coach Shi about it first. He has been very worried about you. If he knows about it earlier, he can also make preparations for it sooner. Even if this was just a scare, he would feel more assured too. It would also be better than waiting until a huge problem arises.”</p><p>“Sounds reasonabl.,” Lou Cheng nodded his head. “I’ll give him a call right away!”</p><p>“Alright!” Yan Zheke replied in a light-hearted tone and felt relieved at the same time.</p><p>…</p><p>After several days, within a secret military base deep within the Shenling Mountain Ranges.</p><p>Lou Cheng wore various monitoring devices and completed a set of slow suicide runs and two sets of taiji-like moves. As compared to when he was just able to get off the bed, it was hard to tell the obvious signs of weakness.</p><p>However, in this short period that lasted less than ten minutes, he experienced two chills. One was on his left leg and the other on the right side of his body. He also experienced scorching heat once. Other than his head, it was throughout his whole body and was unbearable. As a result, he almost fell while running.</p><p>“Puff…” After heaving a breath, Lou Cheng tried his best to look fine before walking to the side of Geezer Shi and Yan Zheke.</p><p>“How was it?” He asked the military personnel that was looking directly at the computer.</p><p>“We are almost done with the data collection. We are currently researching into your cells and genes. When the graph has plotted the model built at that place, we will then do comparison and analysis. Through designing experiments, we will find the source of the problem. This can take anywhere from two weeks to a month.” The military personnel tilted his head and said.</p><p>“So slow?” Geezer Shi interrupted.</p><p>“Senior, I’m sure you know about it too. When it comes to such things, it has always been very slow.” The military personnel answered with guilt.</p><p>Your old injuries have been around for so long and yet we are just at the mid-phase…</p><p>“I’ll be contented if we can get the results in a month.,” Lou Cheng smiled and attempted to help.</p><p>The most likely situation was for him to return after a month for another examination, contributing several more syringes of blood and continued waiting.</p><p>“That’s too long! Isn’t there a huge leap in the advancement of technology?” The half illiterate Geezer Shi shook his head as he nagged. “Stinky brat, are you going to live here, head to Huacheng or rest back at home for some time?”</p><p>“I’ll go home.” Lou Cheng felt that his current condition wasn’t suitable for meeting outsiders. “I can send Ke to the airport at the same time.”</p><p>“That’s great too. Remember to inform Dragon King about it.” Geezer Shi coughed twice before striding away. “I’ll go back to my research.”</p><p>Lou Cheng told Yan Zheke about his experience of being the “subject of experiment”. As they spoke, they instantly covered their mouths to prevent themselves from laughing out loud. Instantly, their moods got better substantially.</p><p>When his master left, Lou Cheng took out the pendant with the Confrontation Formula and handed it over the military personnel, “Please return this to Dragon King on my behalf.”</p><p>A week ago, he had already gotten the grasp of the Confrontation Formula. However, he still wasn’t able to get a response from the Jindan.</p><p>The main use of the Confrontation Formula was to stop distracting thoughts, cleanse and consolidate oneself. This might seem similar to the Forwarding Formula but had great difference in actuality. It was just like the difference between a shirt that “didn’t get dirty” and a shirt that “had its stain removed”.</p><p>Considering this, distracting thoughts were kept away and this was beneficial to both the body and the mind. Once Lou Cheng invoked it, he could maintain his condition at the peak and allowed his injuries to be repaired at a faster rate. By mastering the Confrontation Formula, Lou Cheng was able to get out of the bed for activities much earlier than what others had expected.</p><p>When used on others, the effects were similar. However if other people were in a state of mental blankness or physical exhaustion, once they received “peace”, their fatigue would also set in quickly and be unstoppable!</p><p>After returning the pendant with the Confrontation Formula, the couple arrived at the nearest military grade airport and flew back to Province Xing. After staying over at Gaofen for a night, they rushed to the departure hall at the international airport.</p><p>After helping Empress Dowager with her package for consignment, Yan Zheke carried his black bag and stood in front of Lou Cheng. She bit on her lips a little before saying in a gentle tone, “I saw many rumors about your injuries online. When you get back home, there might also be many reporters that may harass you. If you find them a chore, come over to Connecticut. You can take it as a holiday and stay away from the attention.”</p><p>Speaking till her, she smiled radiantly, patted on her own chest and said in a light-hearted tone, “I will take care of you~!”</p><p>“Alright.” Lou Cheng replied with a faint smile and did not reject the proposal.</p><p>Seeing that it wasn’t early anymore, Yan Zheke turned around and walked towards the departure gate. Yan Kai and Empress Dowager were already waiting there.</p><p>After taking several steps ahead, the girl suddenly turned around. Looking at Lou Cheng, she clenched her fist and did an “All the best” hand signal to Lou Cheng.</p><p>Lou Cheng clenched his fist and waved goodbye. At the same time, he told himself that everything wasn’t as bad as it might seem.</p><p>…</p><p>Xiushan.</p><p>Under the protection from the military, Lou Cheng took a car to the basement before getting into the lift to his house.</p><p>Seeing that his son could walk casually and seemingly unharmed, Qifang, who had been worried since taking the call, finally heaved a sigh of relief. Initially, she had intended to invite the guests over for dinner. In the end, they left without a trace after putting down Lou Cheng’s luggage.</p><p>“They helped you with your luggage under such scorching heat. You should have asked them to stay for a while.” Qifang nagged.</p><p>Now was the time when mom is raging!</p><p>“They have to keep to their discipline.” Lou Cheng smiled as he walked into the house and sat on the sofa.</p><p>Being at home should be free and easy!</p><p>As for the luggage, he could wait a while before unpacking. Hmph. Mum will not be able to stand it and will unpack for me…</p><p>He took out his phone and replied to Yan Zheke who was still on her flight. After which, he refreshed his Weibo and saw that the news of him being injured had not toned down. On the contrary, it was getting more and more exaggerated. There were conspiracies of him being assaulted, him being the victim of jealousy and him being poisoned by his teammate. With Lou Cheng not showing himself in public for over twenty days, some had even claimed that he was now handicapped.</p><p>As he scrolled down the forum, he could see that his fans were all dead worried and feeling anxious. Lou Cheng suddenly felt guilty. After giving it some thoughts, he raised his voice and said, “Mum, help me take a video later!”</p><p>A video of me about every day’s life!</p><p>After which, I’ll upload it on Weibo to relief everyone’s concerns!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
