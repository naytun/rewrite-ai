When you breathe in, a feeling of hiding deeply. When you breathe out, it is to reveal everything. We can see it as the “Metal” element. Some are in the form of minerals. At the stage when it is buried deep in the ground, it could be seen as sharpening its quality. In the viewpoints of the five elements in Ancient China, “Metal” complements “Water”. Water nourishes life. The oxygen that fills the lungs will eventually be dissolved in the blood and brought to various parts of the body for metabolism. And what is blood made of? It’s water! Isn’t this a practical illustration of “Metal” complements “Water”?</p><p>Not only was Lou Cheng’s explanation of Cultivation not accurately translated, but he also made some modifications to it.</p><p>At the current stage of martial arts development, the original complementary theory of the five elements had already been dissected with modern technology. Modern medical science theories had made some adjustment and reflected the useful portions of one’s body. This had opened up several blind spots in technology. This was also the reason why internally practice arts had been constantly changing over the last hundred years and their effects were getting stronger and stronger. This was also a testament to the fact that the current triumphed the past. Lou Cheng wanted to combine Cultivation with the path of Martial Arts and open up a new road that was different from both of the previous paths. In his experiment, he clearly couldn’t just follow the cultivation technique of Ge Hui. If he did follow, it would only help George, Wildon and the rest but would be totally pointless for himself!</p><p>He combined the latest concept of internal practice together with the modified techniques of Cultivation. In this process, he added his various thoughts on this information. Just like when he achieved Dan Equilibrium in the past, he wasn’t completely following the Longhu Immortal. He instead used it as a reference point and used the universe as the blueprint and developed new meanings.</p><p>With regard to this, he felt that he had to thank his current education and his university life. They had given him the solid foundation of self-learning and imparted him with an open mindset and logical thinking abilities. This was different from those martial artists that had only received basic education in martial arts school or martial arts sects.</p><p>The internally practiced arts he was teaching now clearly had their own unique characteristics and could be called Lou’s Five Elements.</p><p>The rise of all living things and humans followed the light. This was the basic biological rule. If it wasn’t for the great fire ball, the sun, shining its light and heat, even species that were most fond of darkness would face energy depletion and entered absolute chill and silence. In the human body, the heart pumped blood and was the source of living. From the viewpoint of the entire structure, it’s position was just like the sun, and therefore is of the “Fire” element!</p><p>Fire is the source of civilization, the source of life itself!</p><p>Water didn’t simply refer to the kidney. It also was the liquid in the entire circulatory system. The kidney was more of a symbol for water cleansing, removing dirt and clearing.</p><p>Wood purified the air just like the liver in the human body. Both store energy and help distribute nutrients. The spleen was usually deep in the body. It’s where old cells are gathered and recycled before being released back into the blood. It also served as a filter for blood, just like soil of the Earth did to Water.</p><p>Naturally, Lou Cheng didn’t have complete confidence in the things he had modified. He believed that there were definitely some other issues present. Therefore he had chosen to find a group of voluntary lab rats for the experiment. He would use his listening skills to check their body each day, look for changes so as to correct and make adjustments in time.</p><p>During his teaching, he would suffer chills and scorch attacks from time to time. However, he had disguised these abnormalities as him thinking about something.</p><p>He saved the Confrontation writing at the end of the first lesson. After which, he asked Heroine Yan to demonstrate the set of practice moves for the 24 Blizzard Strikes to combine internal teachings with external teachings.</p><p>“What are you really trying to teach?” Lou Cheng received many messages from Smith.</p><p>“You don’t have to understand. Just follow and it will be fine.,” Lou Cheng smiled and gave his reply.</p><p>Smith wiped the cold sweat off his forehead, “That’s what the heads of cults usually say!”</p><p>“If you are interested, you could access the Chinese internet and search for “Cultivation Practice”. Oh right, don’t search for “Happiness Practice”. It would cause you to be unable to fall asleep for the entire night.,” Lou Cheng reminded him out of goodwill to prevent him from getting scammed further while trying to understand something he didn’t currently.</p><p>…</p><p>More than a month later, North region of Connecticut City, in the couple’s room.</p><p>“How is it?” Lou Cheng looked concerningly at Yan Zheke who was sitting with her leg crossed and had just completed his practice. She was opening her eyes slowly.</p><p>Little fairy girl had grasped the first portion of Cultivation!</p><p>Yan Zheke’s beautiful eyes looked up, and she pondered for a while before saying, “My mental strength has indeed grown stronger by a level. It has also become more resilient. However it’s still a rather long distance away from the level of mind nourishing the body. At this current rate of practice, I estimate I’ll need at least 5 more years, or more.”</p><p>Lou Cheng nodded his head slightly and said while pondering, “It’s normal. The current technique is the most regular type. As for the branch of the Longhu Immortal, the most effective way to hone the mind is the full set of Nine Words Formulas. If we can get the whole set, perhaps you could achieve the level of mind nourishing the body within a year.”</p><p>“Yeah. Yan Zheke released her ponytail and allowed her hair to fall. After biting on her lips for a second, she happily exclaimed, “After my mind improved, it seems that my body experienced some positive changes too. It feels like the theory of mind nourishing the body might just be really effective!”</p><p>“What kind of changes?” Lou Cheng asked curiously.</p><p>Yan Zheke pointed at the forehead hidden by the fringe and then her back, “I had some pimples that left some marks. I still thought that I would need to treat it for some time and they would only be completely gone before the new year. In the end, they had faded extremely quickly over the last month. It even seems to be accelerating over the last few days and they have disappeared in a poof!”</p><p>During the period when Lou Cheng was injured, she was worried and depressed. Too many emotions were suppressed within her resulting in more pimples popping up despite not having many in the past. There were also multiple red spots in different locations that had been popping out.</p><p>“Not bad. Perhaps you could use this and develop as ‘female beauty arts’ in the future.,” complimented Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Then you will achieve financial freedom very soon!” Yan Zheke’s mouth arc upwards and revealed her beautiful dimples. “What about you? How’re the effects of the mind nourishing the body working for you?”</p><p>Lou Cheng had long mastered the “All Seeing God” realm and his mental strength was extremely strong. He had long exceeded the lowest threshold for “mind nourishing the body” by several times. Over this period, he had taken steps in different attempts.</p><p>“Yeah, my body is of an inhuman and the nourishment of the body is a little stronger now. However, it is not very effective in suppressing the chills and scorching heat. Moreover, I am suspecting that the roots of the sequela originated from the body. It isn’t something that I can withstand, gain immunity or get used to after my body gets stronger…” Lou Cheng thought for a few seconds before answering accordingly. “It seems like this path wouldn’t be plausible. My focus now is on gathering the Nine Words Formulas and combing Cultivation with the path of martial arts.”</p><p>He said it calmly and frankly and didn’t show any disappointment or despondency.</p><p>When Yan Zheke heard the initial part, she was still rather worried. She thought that she had chosen a topic that caused unhappiness. However when Lou Cheng completed his reply, it was well thought out and complete. She couldn’t help but comment, “Cheng, I feel that you are getting more and more mature…”</p><p>It’s an attractiveness that is from remaining strong after going through turmoils.</p><p>At the thought of this, Yan Zheke waved her hand and continued, “Brat, seems like you have grown more mature mentally recently~!”</p><p>“Hey, what did you call me?” laughed Lou Cheng.</p><p>“This is the tone of a Coach~!” Yan Zheke proudly lifted her chin.</p><p>That’s what Coach Shi is like!</p><p>Lou Cheng shook his head while laughing. He examined himself, turned around and said, “However with the nourishment from the mind, my recovery speed has accelerated once again. I should be able to attempt Force Concentration next week and undergo restorative training.”</p><p>“Congratulations!” Yan Zheke smiled radiantly like a blossoming flower.</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed, “At that time, hehe, someone promised me something.”</p><p>“What promise?” Yan Zheke widened her innocent eyes and said with an elevated pitch, “I did not promise you anything!”</p><p>…</p><p>In just a blink of an eye, it was Monday afternoon again.</p><p>After Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke stepped into the Martial Arts Club, they suspected that they were at the wrong place.</p><p>In front of the was a bunch of people wearing Feather Raiments and hats. However, some of them were blonde and some of them had blue eyes. It looked extremely weird and unusual.</p><p>Evil Taoist Priest? Lou Cheng wondered curiously, “Are you participating in a costume party?”</p><p>He almost said the word “cosplay”.</p><p>“No, Lou. No, coach. We have entered Solemn Silence!” George, who had golden hair, blue eyes and tattoos extending to the back of his hand, shouted excitedly. “I feel that I should be a junior phase Taoist priest now! I have looked through a lot of information and have this specialized costume made specifically. I’m proud of it! Unique, powerful, mysterious!”</p><p>He was very agitated and answered disorientedly.</p><p>However Lou Cheng managed to understand the gist of what he was trying to say. After a month of repeated influence by the “Confrontation” Formula that warded off distracting thoughts, George finally could enter Solemn Silence on his own and taken a solid step forward.</p><p>Obviously, people who depended on external forces to grasp the concept might not know that their foundations were relatively weaker and it would be harder for him to take a further step ahead in the future.</p><p>However for Lou Cheng, if one student out of everyone here could achieve Dan Equilibrium, he would have achieved his goal and laid the foundation for combining Cultivation with the path of Martial Arts!</p><p>“I’m also capable of Solemn Silence. I’m also a Taoist priest!” The white girl, Colleen, was so excited that she almost rushed ahead and give Lou Cheng a kiss. She was stopped by Yan Zheke, who knew about their habits.</p><p>“We will also become Taoist priests!” Wildon and the rest had all seen hopes and were extremely excited.</p><p>A group of Taoist priest with black, white or brown skin tones… Why does it feel a little like the transformed form of demons in legends and myths? Lou Cheng broke into laughter. He was happy for the students that had improved and made the breakthrough.</p><p>Yeah. Cultivators had to depend on long-range methods and were supposed to look cool and composed. When I combined it with the path of martial arts, the majority of the time would be spent raising and hitting with a small fist or using whip kicks to sweep at opponents. This is simply a strange to imagine</p><p>For the following lesson, everyone was very serious, making it doubly effective.</p><p>Lou Cheng talked about some additional novel things. When he was about to leave, he received a message from Smith, “Lou, that costume is really cool! Remember to send me the address of where they have it specially made!”</p><p>A spider demon still wishes to disguise as a Taoist priest? Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke exchanged gazes and laughed.</p><p>……</p><p>After returning home, Lou Cheng found an empty patch of land. He closed his eyes and invoked “Self Reflection”. Yan Zheke was waiting by the side. While she was looking forward to it, she was also a little worried.</p><p>Cheng is going to undergo restorative practice in just a while!</p><p>After several minutes, small explosion sounds sounded from within Lou Cheng’s body. It was like the thunder in spring before animals awakened from their winter slumber.</p><p>He took a deep breath, converged his force, breathing, blood flow and mind towards his lower abdomen into a ball before rotating them in balance.</p><p>And in this majestic scene, dots of lights gathered. A crimson red star-like object appeared inside Lou Cheng’s “Big Dan” and he couldn’t tell which one was a reflection and which one was the true form!</p><p>This… A thought flashed passed Lou Cheng’s mind. Focusing his attention, his “Dan Qi” exploded instantly. Everything was blown into pieces without remains.</p><p>“What happened?” Yan Zheke saw that her husband didn’t look right and immediately asked with concern.</p><p>Lou Cheng frowned slightly before answering with doubts and a little elation, “I saw the Jindan…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
