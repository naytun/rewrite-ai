It was as though they were no longer able to contain their hunger. They already had the strength to attain their professional certification in April but this matter was delayed until now because of the Nationals. As the defending champion, Songcheng University would undoubtedly be a seeded school and would enter the group stages directly. They would only be on the stage of the University Nationals in November.</p><p>He Zi and Wang Dali both felt excitement and uneasiness. Sometimes they believed that if they just tried their best, their chances of getting the professional ninth pin certification wouldn’t be small. However, they also felt like they weren’t at that level yet, and it would be safer if they waited for half a year more. There’s no point in them going and seeking torment. As for Jin Lu and Mu Jinnian, they were apathetic to it. Their chances of breaking through were slim and they’d be there mainly to broaden their horizons and gain more practical battle experience.</p><p>“Senior Lou… Coach Lou, we have not fought in a competition for a long time. I would like to request internal practical fights in preparation for the Ranking event!” Wang Dali, who looked like a newly released prisoner, raised his hands and suggested.</p><p>“Sure.” Lou Cheng nodded his head with a smile without hesitation.</p><p>With his current strength, he was more than capable of being the referee.</p><p>“I will sign up first. I want to challenge He Zi!” Wang Dali stood forward. His eyes were resolute and seemed to have been planning this for a long time.</p><p>“Why?” asked Lou Cheng curiously.</p><p>Why does it feel like there was some sort of animosity or grudge between them?</p><p>Wang Dali answered with a face of sorrow and anger, “When we played “werewolf” recently, she would always incite others to kill me first no matter what. I can’t play this broken game anymore!”</p><p>When he completed his words, He Zi, whose hair just reached her ears, and the other female members all broke into laughter.</p><p>Who asked him to always look this fiercely?</p><p>“That’s really a deep animosity,” sighed Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Coach Lou, Senior Lou, we will be playing it again in the afternoon followed by a team lunch. Do you want to join us?” He Zi asked with anticipation.</p><p>All the year one members, regardless of gender, had their eyes trained on Lou Cheng.</p><p>During the November holidays, there was training in the afternoon but nothing scheduled this afternoon!</p><p>Feeling the sincere and full of anticipation gazes, Lou Cheng thought about it before replying,</p><p>“I’m probably not joining for the games. I have something to do in the afternoon…”</p><p>He had to be the stand-in coach and find time specifically to have a video chat with Yan Zheke, where it was night time for her, in the morning. There was almost no way for him to practice, therefore he had to make it up in the afternoon. This would be his regular schedule in China for the next one to two years. Unless there was a sudden or big unexpected event, this would not change easily.</p><p>As the gazes of others turned into disappointment and dejection, he smiled and supplemented,</p><p>“There shouldn’t be a problem with me being at team lunch. You guys can choose the location first and make a reservation before sending me the time and location!” Deng Yang and the rest cheered in unison and became excited again. They were filled with motivation and practiced with passion for the subsequent practical sparrings and regular training.</p><p>When it was close to eleven o’clock, Lou Cheng corrected each member and split them into groups for practice. After which, he entered the changing room. After confirming that Yan Zheke had completed her assignments and reports, he started sharing the various changes in the martial arts club in the quiet environment to an ex-member with the surname “Yan”.</p><p>After their chatting session had ended, he walked out. He intended to make use of his free time while the girls were freshening themselves to fill up his belly in the canteen. After which, he intended to return to his dormitory to continue the video conference.</p><p>At this moment, a pretty freshman wearing a white martial arts suit with black edges ran out from the female changing room. With agitated gaze and rosy cheeks, she asked, “Coach Lou, can you give me your autograph? No, two of them.”</p><p>“Alright.” Lou Cheng would typically not reject such requests. He smiled faintly and continued, “You can just call me Senior Lou. Coach Lou is offline. Take a look, it’s past twelve o’clock now.”</p><p>The girl was tickled by Lou Cheng’s humor and her anxiety was greatly relieved. Unfolding the white T-shirt in her hand, she passed the autograph pen to Lou Cheng and said softly, “Senior Lou, please sign on this first.”</p><p>Lou Cheng didn’t say anything else and started signing his own name on the front of the t-shirt.</p><p>Oh damn, it’s been so long since I signed and I have become rusty in it. Although it wouldn’t look that nice even if I wasn’t rusty…</p><p>After keeping the t-shirt, the girl took out a necklace in the shape of an amulet from her pocket. The pendant was golden in colour and seemed to be some mystical beast in the legends.</p><p>“Senior Lou, could you engrave your name on this pendant?” said the girl as she took out the metal pen used for engraving uneasily.</p><p>What the… In this instance, Lou Cheng was almost stunned. This was the first time he received such a signature request.</p><p>The studious girl moved her mouth and stammered, “My cousin has requested for my help. She is very superstitious and hasn’t always been very lucky. Senior Lou, don’t you have the supernatural ability to reflect curses and bad luck? She is thought that getting an amulet with your signature would ward off disasters and obstacles and protect herself.”</p><p>There’s such a use? Lou Cheng was dumbfounded and was speechless at that moment.</p><p>Hey friend, you shouldn’t be superstitious!</p><p>Eh, why does this sounds so familiar?</p><p>“Senior Lou, if you are not willing, let’s forget about it.” The girl took a peek at her idol and continued.</p><p>Lou Cheng regained his senses, shook his head and laughed,</p><p>“It’s alright. There’s no second time though!”</p><p>He took over the metal engraving pen, tighten his wrist and circulated his force to engraved “Lou Cheng” on the golden pendant. After which, he passed it over to the freshman.</p><p>“Thank you, thank you Senior Lou.” The girl thanked him excitedly and agitatedly. On her way back, she constantly turned over and nodded her head slightly.</p><p>At this point, the majority of the members of the special training had gathered and were intending to head towards the cafe they had made the reservation with to play werewolf. Lunch would also be settled there.</p><p>“Senior Lou, bye bye.” They waved their hands and bade goodbye happily, leaving Lou Cheng behind alone.</p><p>Sigh. It seems that I’ve become more and more unsociable in front of others and not fond of participating in activities… Perhaps they will feel that I’m getting better and better at putting on fronts. Lou Cheng shook his head and smiled. He was teasing himself while lamenting.</p><p>I’m really not free…</p><p>“What are you laughing at?” Classmate Xiao Ming’s voice sounded from the changing room behind him.</p><p>Lou Cheng turned around and saw Cai Zongming who had changed his clothes. He continued, “I’m laughing at why you aren’t joining them.”</p><p>“Are you speaking gibberish? Fang Yuan is leaving on the seventh.” Cai Zongming answered with a face of disdain. “I have already told you three times and yet you can’t remember it at all. Have you entered the ageing phase prematurely?”</p><p>“Did you really say it three times?” Lou Cheng tried his best to recall but couldn’t find any corresponding memories. At that moment, he felt a little lost.</p><p>“Nope.” Classmate Little Ming answered sincerely.</p><p>“Come over, I promise I won’t kill you!” said Lou Cheng as he ground his teeth.</p><p>Cai Zongming laughed a little, turned around and asked, “Cheng, what do you think my chances are of getting a certification in this Ranking event?”</p><p>“If you aren’t unlucky, you are basically guaranteed to get it.” Lou Cheng answered honestly.</p><p>“That’s great. You probably didn’t know how much effort I have to expend to stop myself from flaunting my strength when I’m with my previous classmates, friends and relatives during the summer vacation. I can’t jump out and start flexing my muscles or kick a pilar. I also can’t say that I’m an expert now, right? That would be so embarrassing!” said Cai Zongming as he started fantasizing. “When I get the certification, I just have to slam it in front of them without a word!”</p><p>“Is there any difference in the two methods?” Lou Cheng found it funny and asked.</p><p>“Don’t you feel that the second method is a little more humble?” Cai Zongming made an adduction hand signal.</p><p>“I don’t feel so. Both are equally silly,” replied Lou Cheng without reservation.</p><p>As they chatted and exchanged insults, they walked out of the martial arts gym. Lou Cheng headed towards the canteen while Cai headed to the Academy restaurant to meet up with Fang Yuan.</p><p>For the subsequent days, Lou Cheng led his life according to his schedule. He booked a ticket to America in advance so that he could return to supervise the Ranking event in time.</p><p>……</p><p>Smith was humming a silent melody and walked into the office with light-hearted steps. Over this period of time, he had an easy and carefree life. All the missions he had been assigned were relatively simple and didn’t cause him to worry.</p><p>“What a beautiful life. Thank you God!” After making his coffee, he sat down. Suddenly, he received a call from the Director requesting him to come over for a trip.</p><p>What would be the mission this time? Smith knocked on his superior’s door with curiosity and anticipation.</p><p>“Monitor him. You should be very familiar and not require an explanation right?” The Director turned his computer screen over. A familiar face reflected in the eyes of Smith. Yellow skin, black hair and clear distinct facial features. He was wearing a smile and had multiple red “Danger” terms plastered at the side. The person was obviously Lou Cheng.</p><p>Smith’s eyes stared open widely and his mouth opened little by little. He blurted,</p><p>“Why is he back again?”</p><p>There’s no end to this…</p><p>……</p><p>For the subsequent time, Lou Cheng didn’t make things difficult for Smith. He led a law-abiding life, trained quietly and didn’t commit any action that went beyond the rules.</p><p>In order to stay away from the attention, he had intended to only find an opportunity to challenge martial artists when Yan Zheke was in her next semester.</p><p>When he returned, Cai Zongming and Li Mao had successfully obtained the professional ninth pin certification. After an intense battle, He Zi barely made it as well. Wang Dali was slightly weaker and had bad luck. He failed at the group stage phase. As for Jin Lu and Mu Jinnian, they were too far away and this was purely an experience for them to broaden up their perspectives. However, having four professional ninth pins at one time (Deng Yang enrolled with his own certification) still caused the martial arts club to be in the limelight at Song Da University. The number of students who wished to take part in martial arts classes had increased once again.</p><p>At the end of November, the curtains for the regional group stage for the National University Martial Arts Competition were opened. The first opponent of Song Da was the weakened Heavenly One College. Lou Cheng who had returned from America for the third time did not put his name in the participant list and had placed the freshman, Deng Yang, in the reserves. Despite this, Li Mao, who was in charge of being the stabilizing force, almost didn’t have to expend too much effort. Cai Zongming who had great control over the conversation time and the fearless He Zi almost completed three kills.</p><p>During the first weekend of December, Song Da welcomed their old enemy, Shannan University Martial Arts Club.</p><p>In the changing room for the away team, Lin Xiao who had her hair tied in a ponytail sighed,</p><p>“Inhuman! How could we possibly win? Luckily I discussed the following year, last year. Yeah, it should be next year. At that time, Peng Leyun will have graduated. Rumours had it that Lou Cheng will also enter the professional league in advance. This would be our opportunity!”</p><p>The match had not even started and she was already thinking of the next year.</p><p>Mu Yu or “Old Man Mu” took a glance at her. Looking past the blessed Buddha beads, the exquisite cross and other items, his eyes stopped at the necklace on Lin Xiao’s neck.</p><p>“I have rarely seen this type of amulet?” he asked curiously, a question that had been bothering him for some time.</p><p>Lin Xiao smiled cockily,</p><p>“Yeah, it’s rare. This should be the only one in this world. It’s called the Lou Cheng Amulet that specialized in warding off bad luck!”</p><p>“What’s that?” Mu Yu and Jin Dali were both lost.</p><p>“I asked someone to make me a “The Sky Shaking Roar” amulet and entrusted my cousin who had just entered Song Da to sign on it for additional ‘support’. It definitely can ward off bad luck!”</p><p>“What’s the reasoning behind it?” blurted Mu Yu.</p><p>“Metaphysics!” answered Lin Xiao confidently. “I have become a believer of Lou Cheng!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
