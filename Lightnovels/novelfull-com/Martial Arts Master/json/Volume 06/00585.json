From there, we discovered that he once created a bracelet for the child of a classmate and cured his problem of constantly falling down. After confirmation, that is the Formation Formula.”</p><p>“The other person did not know about the origin of it. After spending a certain sum, we managed to rent this bracelet for three months.”</p><p>As he spoke, he took out the bracelet made of silver and handed it over to Lou Cheng. While swaying, it revealed an orderly, coordinated Formation wording on it that seemed capable of interfering with its environment!</p><p>“Would we be affecting that kid? The truth is we just need a stone rubbing of it!” Lou Cheng asked concerningly.</p><p>Since the reappearance of the Jindan, as long as there’s a little lingering energy of the Nine Words Formula, I can easily master it!</p><p>“Child?” He was indeed a child long ago but he is currently older than me and you. He even had a family now. His tendency to fall down completely dissipated after he grew up. He just holds on to this bracelet as a safety amulet nowadays.” The military personnel shook his head and laughed.</p><p>Lou Cheng was shocked and asked, “Gehui isn’t young?”</p><p>“He has been stuck at the initial phases of Jindan formation for many years.,” confirmed the military personnel.</p><p>“So that’s how it is… No wonder…” Lou Cheng took over the bracelet which could be adjusted to the desired length. Turning his attention to the pendant, he focused on the “Formation” word and tried hard to understand while deducing carefully.</p><p>Several minutes later, he executed the hand seals, retracted his breathing, blood flow, mental strength and force and converged them into a “Big Dan” below his lower abdomen, creating the intertwined crystal and crimson red “stardust” once again.</p><p>Keeping his consciousness high above, he directed the star to rotate and trace out the “Formation” word that he was still trying to master.</p><p>After the hand seals, the Jindan palpitated and violent ripples spread outwards. The bright light slashed through the darkness, forming an orderly ancient word that had the hidden energy within it. It connected with Lou Cheng’s visualization, causing the very different “Formation” word gradually perfecting and leaving behind an engraving.</p><p>When the engraving reacted, the stardust exploded in seven different areas and shone with brilliant light. The ancient word revolved in the space with Confrontation as the core and became as one and no longer separable. However, it’s a shame that there was still something missing and he couldn’t achieve a major change.</p><p>After balancing for some time and pondered about it, Lou Cheng released the Dan force and allowed his mind and will back to the original state.</p><p>He heaved out a breath and spoke to Yan Zheke in a “teaching” tone, “The Formation Formula, when used externally, allows one’s body to become one with the environment and control it to restrain your enemy. An internal practice of it allows the body to be orderly and increases coordination. It’s a shame that we are still missing the ‘Dequeuing’ Formula and the Nine Words Formula isn’t complete yet. There wasn’t a big change…”</p><p>“Yeah.” Yan Zheke nodded her head. “We are just missing one last word. It shouldn’t take too long!”</p><p>“We already have some clues on the ‘Dequeuing’ Formula.” The military personnel overheard their conversation and interrupted them.</p><p>“Really?” Yan Zheke’s eyes widened in shock.</p><p>“Previously, we were investigating objects that are related to Nine Words Formula in Europe in the last hundred to two hundred years. Among which, the last known object that is related to the ‘Dequeuing’ Formula was a drawing. The direction isn’t clear initially and might take several years of time to investigate. Who would have known that when we traced the life on Ge Hui’s master, we would have obtained useful leads? If there aren’t any accidents, the chances of getting it before the year-end are pretty high.” The military personnel answered in exceptional details after being asked by a beautiful girl.</p><p>Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke exchanged glances and were clearly elated.</p><p>…</p><p>As the white snow fell in the city and the chilling wind blew strongly, the fireplace in an ancient castle shone brightly and burned.</p><p>The master of the castle wore a tuxedo and held a cup of red wine in his hand. Caressing his neatly trimmed beard, he smiled faintly and said to the guest sitting opposite of him, “Are you representing Dragon King from China?”</p><p>“Yes. We would like to borrow a drawing from you and would be willing to pay you a price you are satisfied with.,’ said a young man, who only kept an inch-long of black hair.</p><p>When it came to such matters, they would always like to show courtesy before resorting to violence.</p><p>Obviously, this was also because there was someone supporting him from the back. Otherwise, if he told the other party of his motives and the negotiations failed, the subsequent actions to be taken would be several times more troublesome!</p><p>The master, who had brown hair, swayed the cup of red wine in his hand. After pondering for some time, he continued, “I’m not lacking in money or items. If you would like to borrow it, I will require help from the Dragon King.”</p><p>Speaking till here, he smiled and added, “Rest assured. For the Dragon King, this isn’t something that will place him in a tough spot.”</p><p>The young man sitting opposite of him held his hands together. After thinking about it for some time, he stood up and said, “I need to seek instructions about this.”</p><p>“Please.” The master signalled to him.</p><p>The young man left the living room. After several minutes, he returned. Looking at the master, he said with a stern voice, “Dragon King has agreed to your proposal.”</p><p>“May we have a joyous collaboration.” The master looked at the faraway east side and lifted his cup.</p><p>…</p><p>In the middle of January, Xiushan’s weather was wet and freezing. As for Yan Zheke, her school was starting and she had booked the tickets to Connecticut in two days time.</p><p>Lou Cheng had initially intended to celebrate the Chinese New Year at home this time before going over to accompany his little fairy girl on the third day of the Chinese New Year. He didn’t want his parents to always celebrate the eve alone. However at the thought of his sequela not recovering and the fact that there would be people coming and going during the spring festival, he decided to stay with his parents for another ten days as a small family reunion before heading to America. This was also to prevent his condition from being leaked by carelessness since there would be more guests during the spring festival.</p><p>The couple discussed how the arrangements would work for the remaining days. Should they have breakfast at Lou’s house and pay a visit to Yan’s house in the afternoon or should they just book a room in a hotel restaurant and invite the two families for a gathering? Suddenly, Lou Cheng’s phone rang. It was from Shi Jianguo.</p><p>“Hello, master?” Lou Cheng felt a little excited while picking up the car.</p><p>Geezer Shi replied in a heroic tone, “Hey stinky brat, come to the nearest military base for a while. Someone would be receiving you. Oh, I forgot to mention that Dragon King got the “Dequeing” Formula!”</p><p>“Yes! Alright!” Lou Cheng answered with ecstasy.</p><p>Yan Zheke tilted her head over and listened along. When she heard it, her eyes shone like the stars in the skies. Who would have expected that the Nine Words Formula could be assembled so quickly!</p><p>After having the leads, the giant engine of a country started moving and it was indeed much more effective than individual effort by an unknown amount of times!</p><p>Lou Cheng took a deep breath and extended his right hand to his little fairy girl, “Let’s go.”</p><p>“Let’s go!” Yan Zheke smiled shyly and held onto her husband’s hand.</p><p>After applying for leave through a phone call, the couple rushed through the trip without a break. Sitting in the military car, they entered a military base hidden in the middle of tall and deep mountain range. There, they saw the area heavily guarded by real arms and bullets. They saw elites with extraordinary skills and also saw Geezer Shi who was shaking his leg while sitting in the office of the research lab.</p><p>“The full set of the Nine Words Formula is indeed extraordinary. The effects of the mind nourishing the body are just ordinary on this old body of mine. My body is getting stronger by the day. Even if it can’t heal me completely, I will definitely have at least ten more years to live. At this rate, coupled with some results from the researches, my old injuries might not have even relapsed by the time your master, I, pass away!” Shi Jianguo said gleefully.</p><p>“That’s great! That’s great!”</p><p>Geezer Shi stood up slowly, picked up a drawing on the table before saying, “Remember to thank Dragon King when you get back. Tsk. It’s all because of his fame and influence. He is currently at the top of the pyramid!”</p><p>“Yes, master!” Lou Cheng couldn’t wait to take over the drawing. Shaking his hand a little, he opened up the drawing.</p><p>A large “Dequeing” word appeared in front of him. There seemed to be several layers stacking, strengthening each layer.</p><p>Lou Cheng tilted his head and smiled at Yan Zheke before turning his attention back. He focused entirely and tried to understand the energy within. His hand that was holding on the drawing seemed to be exerting too much strength as he was taking this seriously.</p><p>In less than five minutes, he handed the “Dequeing” Formula drawing to little fairy girl. After which, he lowered his stance, formed a guard and completed his hand seals.</p><p>Converging his breathing and blood flow, various emotions gathered at his lower abdomen. A miniature universe was formed. The freezing chill was the background of darkness while the scorching heat was a heavy bright light.</p><p>The Jindan appeared once again just like how it did in previous times.</p><p>Lou Cheng instantly raised his consciousness higher, controlled the force and gradually changed the location of the stars. At the same time, he traced out a not so accurate “Dequeing” word!</p><p>Just like before, the Jindan was stimulated instantly. It palpitated and the ripples spread throughout the Milky Way. The shining light trail formed layers of simple and deep yet dull ancient engravings and directed other external items in the process. In an instant, the “Dequeuing” Formula in his “Big Dan” rearranged rapidly with the energy in it still present.</p><p>At this point, the rotating stardust started accelerating and interchanged between expanding and contracting. Eight brilliant spots lit up in unison and connected with the “Dequeing” Formula. The “Confrontation” Formula that was revolving around his body suddenly danced and quickly sank down.</p><p>In Lou Cheng ears, it was as though there were strange vibrations of clouds and wind sounding off in an ancient voice, “Confrontation! Army! Fighting! Swordsman! Wholeness! Formation! Dequeing! Forwarding! Attainment!”</p><p>Every voice had a corresponding bright word engraving. They stacked onto the “Confrontation” word from all direction, forming a three-dimensional, mysterious and never seen before engraving. The Crystals and Great Sun expanded outwards and combined more deeply with Lou Cheng’s ” Big Dan”. This allowed his sense for danger to improve to a whole new level and allowed him to have a whole new different level of understanding on controlling the Jindan.</p><p>At this moment, for the very first time, he no longer saw the Jindan as a foreign object. Instead, he saw it as a part of his weapons that he had been honing for a very long time!</p><p>“Puff. The following step of digesting the Jindan would be the hardest part…” Lou Cheng kept his consciousness high above and ignored the full set of Taoist practice that appeared in front of him. Carefully, he controlled the Jindan and attempted to borrow some energy from it.</p><p>When the energy was triggered, it instantly clashed with the universe and caused the balance of the “Big Dan” to tilt and collapse in an instant. There was nothing Lou Cheng could do to stop it!</p><p>Kacha! The concrete floor below his leg instantly cracked and several cracks appeared.</p><p>Why did it end up like this? Lou Cheng was a little shocked at this moment.</p><p>Everything before this had fit well with his expectation. However at the most crucial step, it couldn’t be completed.</p><p>While in the balance of Dan, he could not draw out the energy of the Jindan. This was completely different from the time he executed the completed version of “Lament of the Ice Queen”…</p><p>At that time, Jindan was external and it was an individual entity. As for now, it was within and part of the “Big Dan”. Once Lou Cheng moved, the balance would be lost…</p><p>Lou Cheng gritted his teeth and visualized the entire set of Nine Words Formulas. At the same time, he was mumbling “Confrontation, Army, Fighting, Swordsman, Wholeness, Formation, Dequeing, Forwarding, Attainment” as he tried to complete the triggering while the Jindan was in a dispersed form so as to induce a mutation.</p><p>He repeated them several times but there were no reactions from within his body. The Jindan seemed to be in a slumber mode unless Lou Cheng was in the Force Concentration state!</p><p>Yan Zheke was full of anticipation and uneasiness while watching from the side. When she saw Lou Cheng opened his eyes, she had initially wanted to ask him. However, when she saw that her husband’s facial expression did not reveal any signs of joy, she immediately bit her lips together and held back her question. Her heart also immediately sank.</p><p>After several months of previous ordeals, Lou Cheng had initially thought that he could face this with an open mind and calmly tell them about the results. However, in the end, he realised he could only force an expression as he shook his head slightly at his master and wife.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
