If he didn’t  make the best use of the opportunity for practicing his newly learned  martial arts, how could he account to himself? [Smiling sheepishly  expression]” said the Unparalleled Dragon King.</p><p>“In other words, our Lou Cheng hasn’t gotten serious yet? [Clapping  excitedly]” asked Yan Xiaoling as she continued her habit of asking when  she didn’t understand.</p><p>A Plumber Eating Mushroom replied, “He is definitely serious about  the match. It is just that his aim was to increase his own experience  and trying out new things most of the time.”</p><p>“To put it simply, fighting without the aim of winning is really  badass!” Okamoto’s Fan summarized it simply. “If you guys don’t mind, I  can use more ornamented description to explain.”</p><p>“I don’t want to know. It’s definitely dirty! [Cover ears and shaking head expression]” replied Brahman.</p><p>“Fight fight fight! The last few strikes were really great!””Old Gun” vented his emotions without caring about others.</p><p>“Yeah, it was awesome!” Nie Qiqi seconded.</p><p>Yan Xiaoling replied proudly, “Haha, just like I have said! The  current opponent still doesn’t require us to keep a low profile and  accumulate good karma! Since when has Lou Cheng disappointed us?”</p><p>“Yeah yeah yeah” commented All The Good Names Are Taken By Dogs.  After heaving a sigh, she continued, “Speaking of this, I am suddenly  reminded of Lin Que. He is supposed to have a smooth path ahead but yet  he could only take part in competition below the inhuman stage,  especially those that aren’t that important. We can only catch a glimpse  of him occasionally. Sigh…”</p><p>“Feeling sorry for Lin Que… Didn’t you have a new male idol?” asked Brahman curiously.</p><p>“Since when did I have a new male idol? [Lost expression]” replied All The Good Names Are Taken By Dogs.</p><p>Yan Xiaoling pointed out, “Didn’t you say that the bald image of “Poison Milk Hierarch” is pretty cute?”</p><p>Without waiting for a reply, she excitedly replayed the video for  this match and extracted several handsome and manly action images of Lou  Cheng. After which, she got busy downloading and sorting her work.</p><p>…</p><p>In the resting room, Tu Zheng sat on the sofa. His body leaned  forward, and he rested his right elbow on his thigh and supported his  face with his right fist. He attentively watched the television screen,  which was replaying several crucial moments of the previous match.</p><p>Ding! His phone rang. It was a message from Lu Shaofei which was just beside his room,</p><p>“Captain Tu, that move by Lou Cheng was self-created?”</p><p>They had seen him used in April during the University Martial Arts  Nationals. Now that they had seen it again, they were more sure of it.</p><p>“Yeah. That’s probably the results of understanding “Titanic Starlit  Skies – Absolute Frost”. That move isn’t complete. For him to come out  with something new, it is really something awesome.” Tu Zheng pondered  for a while before replying Lu Shaofei. “Those who practice the unique  skills of Ice Sect in this generation are all seeing him as a leader. I  wonder what is Wuyue Club thinking. Why didn’t they stop him from  joining us?”</p><p>After clicking “send”, Tu Zheng was silent. Suddenly, he heaved a sigh.</p><p>Lou Cheng was more than what the word “Awesome” could describe!</p><p>At his current level and after having viewed the physical  invulnerability moves of the Fire Sect, creating a new move wasn’t  something strange. However for his newly created move to have the might  of a simplified physical invulnerability move, that could be considered  unbelievable!</p><p>Rumors had it that Lou Cheng’s master had done similar things while  he was still in the inhuman stage in the past. He had combined the  Thunder and Ice Sect elements to create a set of Tremor Punches. The  killer move of it was a simplified physical invulnerability move.  However, it was only similar in this aspect. This was because that  killer move was mainly based on the blueprint of “Deep Slumber”, a  simplified physical invulnerability move of the Ice Sect, and adding in  new elements. As for Lou Cheng’s previous move, it seemed to have been  developed out of nothing. At least nothing of this sort had happened  among people who were below physical invulnerability stage. Therefore,  these two cases couldn’t be compared directly.</p><p>Sigh. Facing this type of Heavenly Son of the era, even if my  strength and realm could still overwhelm him, I’ll still feel a little  depressed from time to time.</p><p>Naturally, this will also be motivation!</p><p>…</p><p>In the arena, after seeing Lin Yue fall and almost create a huge  hole, Lou Cheng quickly rushed over, attempted to help him up and send  him to the emergency treatment room.</p><p>He still had quite some respect for such a true martial artist.</p><p>At this moment, Lin Yue supported himself with both of his arms and  stood up by himself while swaying. After wiping the blood stains off the  edge of his mouth, he stuck out his thumb and said, “Awesome. You  almost dismantled this set of old bones.”</p><p>Oh damn. He can still move? And even so agilely? Lou Cheng was a little dumbfounded and had forgotten what he wanted to say.</p><p>Lou Cheng could control the minute details of his body and make  accurate repairs by himself. Even so, if he were to take 5 blows of  Internal Explosion from someone at the same level, he would probably  suffer grave injuries and be on the edge of death. Other than being sent  to the emergency treatment room, he wouldn’t be able to do anything  else. However, Lin Yue had taken a total of nine blows of Internal  Explosion. Yet he seemed like he could still run home!</p><p>He only couldn’t withstand the moment his injuries were all dealt. Since then, he had recovered from them!</p><p>“Immortal Flesh” is really insane! He’s really a monster!</p><p>“He’s really a monster from the m78 galaxy!” Lou Cheng exclaimed!</p><p>However, no matter how tough his martial arts were, there were still  shortcomings. One who practices Immortal Flesh couldn’t develop a  various mystical “Force”. Only their regeneration and defensive  capabilities were insanely strong.</p><p>“Fierce and relentless. Each generation is getting more and more  relentless…..” Lin Yue laughed and touched his head. After bowing, he  turned around and walked towards the stone steps as though he wasn’t  affected at all. Initially, his footsteps were still a little staggered.  Towards the stone step, he was already as steady as a rock.</p><p>Phew. I really have to experience it myself to be able to objectively  understand how powerful Immortal Flesh is. If I had only watched it on  video, I would have only been able to get a superficial understanding  and unable to form a clear idea… Lou Cheng thought to himself. He walked  off the arena with the whole crowd cheering “Lou Cheng, Lou Cheng” and  back to his personal resting room.</p><p>After sharing the details of the battle with Yan Zheke, Lou Cheng  collected his mind, did a self-reflection and controlled his breathing  and blood flow. This was to repair and rejuvenate the injuries that had  appeared after the battle with the utmost precision.</p><p>It was tough initially but got easier towards the end. After half an  hour, he was even able to do it while watching the other matches.</p><p>At noon, he went to the restaurant in the Guanhai Martial Arts  Stadium to fill his stomach. After which, he had a 40 minute nap. When  he woke up, various aspects such as vitality, mental and physical had  all returned to the peak status and he was ready for another fight.</p><p>These were the benefits of attaining the realm of “All Seeing God” and practicing the “Wholeness” Formula!</p><p>In the afternoon, he watched the battles of Tu Zheng, Lu Shaofei and  his other teammates casually. In between their matches, he switched to  other popular matches and fervently and excitedly discussed them with  his wife.</p><p>During this process, Ann Chaoyang suddenly sent a message to report  something good that happened to him. He was talking about encountering a  fifth-pin inhuman. After a prolonged and intense battle, he was able to  finally win by a narrow margin and did not embarrass himself by being  eliminated in the first round.</p><p>Peng Leyun was in the last match that afternoon. With his  “Encountering Gods In The Void, Self Reflection” realm to support, he  pushed his “Taking it easy” style a little further. Luckily, he did not  fall into the embarrassing situation where he lost because he took it  too easy. From the start to the end, everything was firmly in his  control.</p><p>“He seems to be a little stronger than me again…” Lou Cheng mumbled.</p><p>That night was Ren Li’s match in the Sky Moon Martial Arts Stadium.  She demonstrated the realm of “All Seeing God” and clinched the victory  without any suspense.</p><p>This made Lou Cheng feel an unknown pressure.</p><p>These two fellows are improving so quickly!</p><p>I can’t possibly let them leave me far behind after I finally catch up with them!</p><p>With his mind still highly excited, he returned to the hotel together  with Tu Zheng and Lu Shaofei. For the following day, other than  practicing and having his meals, Lou Cheng did not leave the room. This  was because they were too many favorites for him to pay attention to. He  had compiled the videos of those he would like to watch and had to go  through the countless details. How could he possibly find time to walk  around casually?</p><p>Yan Zheke was always enthusiastic in such things. It was as though  she was participating in the Battle of the Kings. Throughout the day,  she talked enthusiastically with Lou Cheng.</p><p>After the first round had ended, there was a day of break. Lou Cheng  continued to stay in his hotel and focused his research only on  opponents who were stronger than him. He was so busy that he lacked the  time to play games.</p><p>Picking up the phone, he replied to his little fairy girl. Just when  he was about to put it down, he suddenly received a notification and was  pulled into a group chat.</p><p>“Want to meet up tonight?” Ann Chaoyang asked.</p><p>This time, he had learned from his previous mistake and directly created a “Linfu Eating Group”.</p><p>“Let’s do it another day. I still have tons of videos that I have not  watched. Let’s decide the date after we enter the double-elimination  format.” replied Peng Leyun whose nickname had been changed to “Physics  Worker.”</p><p>“+1!” Ren Li seconded.</p><p>Lou Cheng took a glance at the videos to watch on his tablet and replied, “[Laughing heartily expression] What a coincidence!”</p><p>Damn it! A group of “video maniac” youths!</p><p>This living tempo remained till the evening when the organizing committee announced the face-off schedule.</p><p>From the second round of the competition onwards, some people would  get a walkover win. This was to ensure that there would be exactly  sixty-four members after three rounds of battles.</p><p>“I really wanted to advance directly but I also really will like to  fight. I’m so conflicted…” Lou Cheng refreshed the webpage and found his  name and the person he would be facing.</p><p>Sky Moon Martial Arts Stadium, Friday night, (Longhu Club) Lou Cheng vs (Daxing Temple) Zhi Tong!”</p><p>I’m finally able to witness the strength of a direct disciple of the Daxing Temple!</p><p>After half an hour, he received a message from Yan Zheke while  researching into the competition videos of Zhi Tong. It was a web link  to a piece of news.</p><p>Lou Cheng clicked in and took a look. Zhi Tong was stopped by an  official reporter when he left his Zen room. He accepted the interview  and said with both of his palms together, “Namo Amitabha. A monk doesn’t  lie or boast. I really want to win against Benefactor Lou!”</p><p>The video on him ended and the reporter commented, “He also has the strength to achieve the win!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
