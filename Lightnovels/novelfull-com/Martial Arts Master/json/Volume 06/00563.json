At the meantime, he formed a group with Xiao Ming and played a few rounds of games.</p><p>When the app updated him that Yan Zheke’s flight would be landing soon, he quickly told the group that this would be his last round. With his mind on other things, he was quickly killed.</p><p>After some time, Yan Zheke switched on her phone and sent a message to Lou Cheng to confirm that she had landed.</p><p>“I’ve been waiting. [Hands on the waist, acting cockily expression]” replied Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Didn’t I do the same when you fly to Connecticut? [Roll eyes expression]”. There’s this guy who wanted to help me with my luggage after seeing that it was heavy. His expression was truly amazing when he saw me get it myself.”</p><p>“Haha. Those who are good-looking surely feel the friendliness of the world at all times.” Lou Cheng quickly and subtly praised her.</p><p>While chatting on and off, his eyes suddenly lit up when he saw Yan Zheke walking out while carrying a black bag and pulling a yellow suitcase to the arrival hall.</p><p>Yan Zheke had her hair down and her fringe pulled to the side. She looked pure and beautiful. She wore a white t-shirt with a simple design, dark blue denim shorts that covered half of her thighs and flip-flop sandals, revealing her fair, white skin and her healthy nails and toes. It was refreshing and youthful!</p><p>Lou Cheng took several steps ahead and took over the suitcase with a smile, “You need to be qualified to carry my girl’s suitcase.”</p><p>He continued with the topic they were chatting about. “That is correct!” Yan Zheke’s eyes lit up and raised her head a little.</p><p>Lou Cheng stopped right there and looked at her attentively. Suddenly, he broke into laughter, “I thought you would be wearing like a little fairy girl but in the end, you chose to go with the girl-next-door style.”</p><p>“Yan Zheke looked away and said,</p><p>“That’s because I’m afraid someone couldn’t control himself and be overwhelmed by his beastly desires!”</p><p>Whenever I dress nicely, someone’s gaze would be different. It was as though he had been hungry for a long time and had seen a human meal in front of him!</p><p>“Aren’t you on your period today? How am I supposed to be overwhelmed by my beastly desires?” Lou Cheng smiled sorrily.</p><p>Yan Zheke pouted, opened her eyes widely and attempted to say it in an angry tone, “It’s because of this that I’m afraid…”</p><p>I’m afraid you will ask for my “help” in other ways and I will give in to you after not seeing you for a month! I will definitely be led astray by him!</p><p>Her face blushed slightly and couldn’t complete her sentence. Immediately, she changed the topic and asked in a serious manner,</p><p>“Where are we going now?”</p><p>“When it was your menses period, since when am I not behaving myself appropriately and only showering you with love and concern?” Lou Cheng answered aggrievedly.</p><p>“Yeah, that deserves compliments. Please continue to work harder~” Yan Zheke was only trying to move on to the next topic and therefore replied in such a manner. When she stopped, she extended his hand and patted on the head of her husband.</p><p>“Taking me as a child?” Although that’s what Lou Cheng was saying, his face was full of smiles. He pulled Yan Zheke over by the wrist and pointed in the direction with his chin. “Let’s rent a car first. It will be more convenient when we go out for dates and buying groceries.”</p><p>He did not have a driving license and the club would arrange for transportation for him most of the time. In addition, Yan Zheke could only come over from America during the winter and summer breaks. If he was to buy a car directly, it would be left to accumulate dust most of the time. He was thinking of getting a house and moving in before considering the rest. For this period of time, they could just rent a car to meet their needs.</p><p>“Alright.” Yan Zheke nodded her head slightly. After taking several steps forward, she suddenly asked, “Cheng, you got your driving license?”</p><p>Based on someone’s personality, he would definitely have boasted about such a “big event”.</p><p>“Nope.” Lou Cheng laughed. “I can only rely on you then!”</p><p>Although he could drive too, he tried not to break the rules if he could since he did not have a driving license.</p><p>Yan Zheke found it both hilarious and infuriating. Waving her hands, she continued,</p><p>“Alright. Let me bring you around. Sigh. It’s hard being the head of the family. There’re so many things to worry about and I have so many responsibilities!”</p><p>“That’s what the head of the family has to do!” Lou Cheng smiled and agreed with the self-compliments that Yan Zheke had on herself.</p><p>When they were at the car rental stand, the two of them completed the paperwork and paid part of the fees. They have chosen an Audi TT which was easy for a girl to drive.</p><p>After seeing off the employee, Lou Cheng signalled to Yan Zheke for her to wait for a while. He pulled open the doors of the car and took a deep breath in. His abdomen expanded into a ball-shape.</p><p>Circulating his Ice Spirit Force, he opened his mouth and blew out the air he took in previously.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>A gust of strong wind blew in the car and cool it. The heat accumulated under the high temperature of the summer immediately dissipated. Yan Zheke who was watching from the side was dumbfounded.</p><p>There’s still such a way to use one’s ability?</p><p>Lou Cheng stopped his actions and straightened his back. Signalling for her to get in, he smiled and continued,</p><p>“Friendly reminder: The sun in the summer is harsh. If you did not place your car under the shade and is away for a long time, please be reminded to let the heat dissipates first. Guaranteed ventilation.”</p><p>“…” Yan Zheke was shocked for several seconds. She wasn’t stingy with her compliments and said in a rather superfluous manner, “Cheng you are the best~!”</p><p>He’s indeed a mobile multi-functional electrical equipment!</p><p>After getting on the car, she adjusted the seat, closed the window and was about to adjust the rear view mirror and side view mirror. Lou Cheng suddenly stretched his body over and said,</p><p>“Let me help you to adjust.”</p><p>“Ah…” Yan Zheke was lost and didn’t understand what is going on.</p><p>Don’t he know that it could be electronically adjusted?</p><p>Seeing the silly and shock look on Yan Zheke, Lou Cheng kissed down without a hesitating. Keeping her lips between his mouth, he softly went around before exploring deeper.</p><p>I’m flirting with you, flirting with you! Do you understand?</p><p>She raised her arms subconsciously and hugged Lou Cheng. Yan Zheke’s eyes were closed slightly and finally pushed the pervert away after some time. Just when she was about to scold him, she suddenly heard him saying beside her ear in a soft voice, “It’s been a long time since we met…”</p><p>She gave in immediately and mumbled, “Didn’t we chat every day?”</p><p>I missed you so badly too……</p><p>When their eyes met, it was an emotional moment. Yan Zheke suddenly broke into laughter, “Is this the failed attempt by your Martial Cousin Mo previously to flirt with you? How dare you use it on me!”</p><p>“There’s no one else I can use it on.,” Lou Cheng answered proudly.</p><p>Covering her mouth while laughing, the girl cleared her throat and asked, “Where shall we go now? Heading home first or should we go out for dinner later?”</p><p>“Look at you! If your stomach isn’t hurting, let’s go to that Lin Eatery near the University Town that Fatty Jiang brought me to for their steam chicken and roasted goose. If you are still feeling unwell, let’s head home first. I have boiled some fish soup last night and kept it in the fridge. We can heat it up and cook some noodles later. I have also bought a huge serving of porridge with preserved egg and lean meat. It’s from the stall that you liked when we came to Huacheng to watch the competition previously. We can eat it once I heat it up a little using my Emperor Yan Force. Yeah. If it hurts badly, it will be better if I drive.” Lou Cheng continued naggily.</p><p>Yan Zheke turned her head and faced the front after listening. After holding it in for several seconds, she couldn’t contain her smile and said in a gentle voice,</p><p>“What if I want to eat all of that?”</p><p>“Then we shall eat all of them! Let’s go the Lin Eatery first before heading home!” Lou Cheng had made the decision.</p><p>“Let’s go~” said Yan Zheke as she started the car quickly.</p><p>After filling their stomach, the two of them went to the Sky Capital Garden. After finding a spot, they parked their car and rested in it.</p><p>“I’m so tired after taking the plane, having my menses and driving for such a long time.” Yan Zheke locked the car door and looked at Lou Cheng. As she spoke, she hammered on Lou Cheng’s shoulders and pinched his arms.</p><p>Yan Zheke was getting better at acting in a pettishly charming manner… A thought flashed past Lou Cheng mind and without saying a further word, he turned his back to face Yan Zheke, lowered his body and said, “Come, let me carry you!”</p><p>“I just wanted you to give me a massage…” Yan Zheke was initially a little shock but laughed out after a while. “There are still others around and your teammates! This is so embarrassing!”</p><p>“It’s quiet at night in this place. Moreover it’s our house after passing that corner.” Lou Cheng tried to convince her.</p><p>“Alright…” Yan Zheke’s eyes shimmered and seemed hesitant about it. However her actions weren’t so at all.</p><p>After using his arms to support the legs, Lou Cheng stood up steadily and carried his wife through the quiet corridor and darkness under the moonlight and the road lamps.</p><p>Each unit occupied a level. In other words, there’s only a family for each level and each unit would have two lifts to prevent malfunctions. Unfortunately, both of the lifts were damaged today and the technicians were trying to fix it as soon as possible.</p><p>Lou Cheng didn’t say anything and stopped Yan Zheke from trying to get down. He turned into the safety route, followed the stairs and took one step at a time up. Beside him were two legs swaying lightly and he could hear the melody that his girl was humming.</p><p>…</p><p>Europe, John Weilburg.</p><p>“Ge Hui, this doesn’t seem to be fully in compliance with the protocol.” Irina laughed heartily.</p><p>The guy lying on the deck chair suddenly opened his eyes. It was as though a starlit night sky was hiding within them. The man had several silverish strands of hair on his head. Although he sounded like an old man, he looked young. His facial features and skin tone clearly showed that he was from China and perhaps was Chinese.</p><p>“I’ll be going for a long trip soon.,” The guy said with a faint smile.</p><p>Irina eyes sank and pretend to ask nonchalantly, “To China?”</p><p>“Yeah, to check on that Heavenly son of the era. It is just to take a look.” Ge Hui answered frankly and took off the ancient looking long robe on him.</p><p>Irina didn’t know about this type of clothing that had a strong Eastern style. After searching online, she learnt that this was known as a Taoist Robe. In Mandarin, the phrase that often went with it was Taoist Robe and Taoist Hat.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
