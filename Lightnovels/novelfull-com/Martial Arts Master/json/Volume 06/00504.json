Can you bring me around for a tour?”</p><p>He wasn’t great at speaking English and can only use simple terms to express what he meant.</p><p>If the so-called Dragon Punch had distinct characteristics that were different from the others, and the strength of the master of the Martial Arts Dojo was great, he wouldn’t mind spending some money to kill some time and have a private sparring session.</p><p>“Of course! Let me find someone to lead you in and give you an introduction.” The front desk lady smiled radiantly like a blossoming flower. It was as though she had seen a business deal that would be closing soon.</p><p>She picked up the phone and spoke in words that Lou Cheng couldn’t understand. Soon a skinny, pale teenager came out of the martial arts dojo and greeted him enthusiastically. “Chinese?”</p><p>“Yeah,” answered Lou Cheng honestly.</p><p>The vitality of this teenager wasn’t overwhelming and the muscles on his arms and other areas barely formed contours.</p><p>“Just arrived in Connecticut?” The skinny and pale teenager was scrutinizing Lou Cheng from head to toe and continued with a face full of smiles, “The weather changes quickly in this place. Do take note of it. I forgot to self-introduce myself. I’m Li Zunping, a student and part-time aid in this place. Let’s talk after we get in. You can take a look around the place.”</p><p>“Alright.” Lou Cheng followed Li Zunping as they level one of the training ground, then the weights and machines on level two. He realised that the set up of this place was not much different from those back in his home country. It was just that the students were mainly foreigners. Seeing ladies and men with different skin tones practicing their stances and punches felt rather intriguing.</p><p>“How is it? We are a very traditional Chinese Kungfu dojo and the strength of the coaches are also very impressive. Some of them even clinched the no-restrictions martial arts title…” Li Zunping was fulfilling his duties to the fullest. “Have you practiced martial arts previously? If you are starting from scratch, we have the relevant lessons and specialised training programs…”</p><p>Despite hearing the chatter of the his guide and seeing the very ordinary punches and kicks in the training being offered, Lou Cheng restrained from showing his lack of interest and asked with a faint smile, “I’m still considering, do you have promotional materials? Can you give me a copy so I can read them in detail back home?”</p><p>The coaches here were all able to generate sounds from their punches and kicks and split would wooden planks and bricks from time to time. Although the sound of breaking planks and bricks might impress the foreigners and made them feel that Chinese kungfu was indeed something awesome, it was boring and pointless for him. The so-called Dragon Punch was only about changing the technique of exerting strength. This was just an average kungfu that was more suitable for the body structure of the locals.</p><p>He had to respectfully decline the studio. He couldn’t possibly bear the idea of insulting their dojo by implying that they were weak in his response. “I’m still considering” was an effective phrase to get away and hide the fact that he wasn’t impressed.</p><p>“We do. I will bring a copy to you. Let me tell you, our Dragon Punch Dojo has over ten years of history. We have 5 to 6 branches in Connecticut and definitely not the kind that cheats people of their money. Our dojo master is Zhu Hong. He has gone to Nanyang after achieving mastery in Kungfu. He’s not well known in China so it’s normal that you haven’t heard of him. Eleven years ago, he migrated to Connecticut. By combining the characteristics and techniques of martial arts from three places, he created the “Dragon Punch.” Li Zunping smiled and continued, “The competition in mixed martial arts in Connecticut is very intense. The very fact that we managed to establish ourselves and remain for over ten years is a testament to our strength.”</p><p>It does sound like an amazing experience… Lou Cheng’s interests were aroused a little again. He asked with a smile,</p><p>“Where’s dojo master Zhu?”</p><p>Perhaps the uniqueness of “Dragon Punch” wasn’t something that ordinary teaching could demonstrate… I cannot be arrogant and blindly looked down on others……</p><p>“Dojo master Zhu is a busy man. He only stays in each branch for a day. Hmph. The day after tomorrow, Wednesday, he will be coming to our place. You can come and have a look and witness the real Dragon Punch.” invited Li Zunping with enthusiasm.</p><p>At that time, you will definitely be anxious to join us!</p><p>“Alright.” Lou Cheng nodded and responded with a faint smile. After Li Zunping accompanied him to collect the information, he walked out of the Dragon Punch Dojo.</p><p>He lowered his head and switched on google maps again to look for the next martial arts stadium.</p><p>——-</p><p>Opposite of the street and in the open air cafe, Smith took a sip of the bitter liquid in his cup. From time to time, he would take a look at the surveillance video on the computer screen or raise his head to look at the dangerous person across from him who looked just like a backpacker.</p><p>Yes! A really dangerous person!</p><p>Smith had gone through the information provided by Renee in details the previous night. He had an extremely vivid impression of the target he was supposed to keep an eye on.</p><p>That was the “Mobile Explosive Material”!</p><p>Raging fire waves, huge explosion and fleeting frost. All of them flashed past Smith’s mind, making him unable to help but mumble to himself, “Ouch!” He cursed.</p><p>“The people in the embassy had shit filling their heads. How could they give a visa to this kind of guy?” Why don’t the supervisors just deport him right away!”</p><p>Knowing that he was just lamenting, Smith pressed onto the miniature earpiece, lowered his voice and commanded the members of his team to change their position to prevent themselves from being discovered.</p><p>After completing his commands, he raised his head and observed his target.</p><p>At this moment, Lou Cheng was looking around, seemingly lost, and they coincidentally locked eyes.</p><p>Smith’s body immediately tensed up, but he did not rush to shift his gaze away, instead pretending like there was nothing intriguing him. He nodded his head politely first before looking to the side, just like what any ordinary Americans would do.</p><p>Suddenly, he realized Lou Cheng had moved. He walked towards the zebra crossing and crossed the street while the traffic light was still green. It seems like he was heading to me!</p><p>“Damn it!” Smith quickly lowered his head, pretending he was drinking coffee while cursing with a little anxiety.</p><p>He couldn’t have discovered anything right?</p><p>Should I get up immediately and leave or be open about my identity, inform him that surveillance on him is necessary and use the various laws to confuse him?</p><p>While he was still hesitant, there’s another figure in his vision. Lou Cheng was just right in front of him.</p><p>Cold sweat was breaking out on the back of Smith.</p><p>“Smith, this is what every man, who wants to be a spiderman, has to experience. Show them your courage!” He mumbled to himself as he raised his head and looked calmly at that Chinese teenager which was marked with the red sign “Danger”.</p><p>“I’m sorry, can I bother you for a second? I would like to ask for directions.” Lou Cheng was trying hard to make his smile looked a little more approachable.</p><p>The moment we locked eyes, I decided to ask for directions from this person who seems to have an affinity for me!</p><p>He looked pretty friendly!</p><p>Smith almost raised his hand to clear his ears. He suspected that he had heard wrongly and answered with a dazed look,</p><p>“No problem.”</p><p>“Uhh, I’m a fan of martial arts. Is there any famous martial arts practice field in this area?” Lou Cheng organized the words in his mind and asked with anticipation.</p><p>With Google maps, he wasn’t afraid of getting lost. However after searching for a long time, he had gotten a headache trying to understand the English terms, and he couldn’t find the place. I have even complained about it to my wife!</p><p>Smith smiled, relaxed himself and answered with a rather awkward smile,</p><p>“Msasi Martial Arts Gym. It is at district seven and is an important base for the “Geruga” Sect. Do you understand?”</p><p>“I understand. Thank you.” A name that he found previously flashed passed his mind and he quickly confirmed the route on the map.</p><p>He waved his hand and bade farewell to the kind person before heading to the Seventh district.</p><p>Smith waved his hands back reflexively. After Lou Cheng had walked far away, Smith then wiped his forehead. Both of his hands were wet from the cold sweat he had broken out into.</p><p>“He only came here to ask for directions?” mumbled Smith. “Why is he trying look for a Martial Arts dojo? He said he is a lover of martial arts…”</p><p>Smith’s expression suddenly changed drastically. He stood up abruptly and hit the chair in the process. Through the device, he gave orders to his underlings,</p><p>“Survey Msasi Martial Arts Gym immediately. Activate ‘Skynet’ and gather our men. Emergency level preparation!”</p><p>A martial artist from China with a dangerous grade headed towards the Geruga Sect would cause anyone to have a bad premonition!</p><p>…</p><p>Lou Cheng kept stopping while walking to either check on the map or share his adventures with Yan Zheke. After thirty over minutes, he finally saw the large sign of “Msasi Martial Arts Gym”. On top of it was the symbol of the Geruga Sect, a fist holding a trident. Below it was the words Msasi and other phrases.</p><p>“This is the place. It’s much more luxurious than Dragon Punch Doho…” Lou Cheng pushed opened the door happily.</p><p>The lady at the front desk had blonde hair, blue eyes, a hot figure and was wearing a red dress. She was shocked for a while and asked slowly,</p><p>“You are here to learn martial arts?”</p><p>“Yeah. Can I take a look before deciding?” answered Lou Cheng easily.</p><p>“Of course you can.” The blonde hair girl revealed a smile and friendly reminded, “Many martial artists have a bad temper. After you are in, please take note of several things. Don’t stare at others training. If anyone is taunting you, pretend that you didn’t see or hear anything. As for discriminatory comments, please bear with them. OK?”</p><p>“OK!” Lou Cheng nodded with a smile.</p><p>After waiting for 2 minutes, a black skinned teenager who had multiple braids and clothes that were very urban walked out. When he opened his mouth, Lou Cheng was wondering if he would be rapping “yo yo yo” into what he was saying.</p><p>“Oh a shy-looking Asian boy,” teased the black teenager. “I’m Brook”</p><p>“Hi Brook.” Lou Cheng didn’t say his name and just followed him into the Msasi Martial Arts Gym.</p><p>They just took a few steps ahead, and a huge creature walked directly towards them. He was a buff black man who was clearly over 2 metres tall. His arms looked exaggeratedly big and were glossy. It was comparable to Lou Cheng’s thigh.</p><p>He wore a smirk, took a look at Lou Cheng “weak and skinny” arms, constricted his biceps before saying,</p><p>“Little boy, martial arts isn’t suitable for you!”</p><p>After speaking, this bald giant didn’t wait for a reply, let out clear laughter and walked directly towards another room.</p><p>“Don’t put it to heart. Olsen was just making a joke. He is actually a very friendly and humorous guy.” Brook quickly explained to Lou Cheng who was a little shocked. “In comparison to other martial artists……”</p><p>…</p><p>After sending Lou Cheng and Brook off, the blonde lady looked out while idling her time away. Suddenly, she found a man moving between buildings like a spider.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
