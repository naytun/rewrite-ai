It was dry and hot. Under the scorching hot sun, even the air seemed to be distorted. Looking across, it felt like an illusory place.</p><p>The ringing of the bell were sounded. Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke each rode a camel and arrived at the vicinity of the Isis’ temple ruins.</p><p>Just a short distance behind them, a professional tour guide wearing a robe and a head-piece followed closely behind. He had chosen to become “invisible” as he did not want to disturb his distinguished guests.</p><p>With Lou Cheng’s strength, it shouldn’t be a problem for him to go for a holiday at the Nile. However, he did not wish to resort to violence for everything. Otherwise, he would lose interest in the holiday. Hiring an extremely well-connected tour guide at a high price could save him a lot of troubles. For example, just moments ago, if two foreigners wished to ride a camel, they would definitely be scammed of a huge sum of money. Moreover, they might not enjoy themselves either. However with the tour guide arranging everything through his connections, the problem was immediately solved. The price was reasonable and the service was great. This allowed the couple to have a smooth journey.</p><p>You get what you pay for. If the problem could be solved with money, he wouldn’t have to resort to violence.</p><p>After stopping by the ancient looking and run-down temple ruins, Yan Zheke easily hopped of the camel and happily looked inside the temple. She wore long sleeves and long pants and had her hair wrapped in a towel and looked just like a local. However, there was only one true reason why she did that and that was to avoid the sun.</p><p>A girl’s insistence to protect herself from the sun was something that a man couldn’t possibly understand. As for Lou Cheng, he was in T-shirt, shorts and martial arts shoes. He felt that this was perfectly fine.</p><p>“This is the temple of the Isis, the goddess of Earth.” Yan Zheke pointed ahead and made the introduction to Lou Cheng. “Rumors had it that one of her true forms was Inanna in the Legends of the Sumerian religion or Venus, the goddess of fertility, sex and love.”</p><p>Seeing that someone was just nodding his head cluelessly, Yan Zheke giggled and continued, “Do you feel that the goddess, Inanna, is a little foreign.</p><p>“I might have heard of it before. Or maybe not…” answered Lou Cheng casually.</p><p>This is a tourist spot that some fairy girl added in the last minute. I didn’t have the time to prepare for it!</p><p>“If I changed the name, you might be more familiar with her!” Yan Zheke bit her lips and smiled heartily.</p><p>“What?” asked Lou Cheng curiously.</p><p>“Call me Teacher Yan! Mentor Yan is alright too!” Yan Zheke tilted her head and lifted her chin. That slender and white neck was slightly visible under the cloak.</p><p>Lou Cheng burst into laughter and said, “Please enlighten me, Mentor Yan!”</p><p>“Cough. Have you heard of Aphrodite? Venus? These are the names used in Greek and Roman mythologies. Also, have you heard of female saints?” Yan Zheke asked several questions consecutively and waved her hands. “All of their origins could be traced back to Inanna!”</p><p>“She must be really powerful…” Lou Cheng was dumbfounded.</p><p>After showing off her knowledge, Yan Zheke covered her own mouth. She pointed to the engravings, statues and stone pillars that had been heavily weathered</p><p>“Come, help me take a photo first. We can ask the tour guide to take our photos later.”</p><p>“Alright.” Lou Cheng took out his digital camera and waited for Yan Zheke to complete her pose.</p><p>At this moment, a man who claimed that he was working, walked over. He had the distinctive full beard of the locals and signalled that he could help the couple take their photos.</p><p>Knowing that he would definitely be scammed if he agreed, Lou Cheng shook his head resolutely but did not show his suspicion.</p><p>That worker stepped to the side. When Lou Cheng clicked the shutter, he suddenly jumped out and was captured by the camera, ruining the picture.</p><p>After which, he went up to Lou Cheng again and constantly pestered him for pay with his broken English.</p><p>Although the couple didn’t lacking the money, they weren’t willing to be forced into such a situation. Lou Cheng turned around and glanced at the tour guide. Seeing that he was rushing over, he extended his right palm and patted softly on the worker’s shoulder.</p><p>In an instant, this worker felt a chilling sensation cruising through his body. Although he was in the desert during the summer season, he suddenly felt like he was locked in a freezer.</p><p>He couldn’t help but shudder from the cold. When he wanted to open his mouth, he could only hear the sound of his teeth chattering. He wanted to move away but realized his body had stiffened and control of it was difficult.</p><p>Lou Cheng pulled his little fairy girl away as though nothing had happened. They found another position and started taking photos again after signalling to the tour guide and asking him to tie up the loose end.</p><p>The local “tyrant” who was used to acting fierce was deterred by his encounter. Although he threatened to call the police, he did not dare to take any practical actions. The tour guide was able to easily persuade him to leave.</p><p>After having their photos taken together, the couple held hands and roamed around the ancient temple ruins. They chattered and were having a great time.</p><p>After visiting the last attraction of this area, they returned to the downtown area. Based on the introduction of the tour guide, they entered Babora, a unique barbeque store. In this place, carefully selected lamb legs or other parts were seasoned with pepper, salt and spices made from a secret formula. The scent of the roasted meat was thick and the meat was tender and smooth.</p><p>“Not too bad. It tastes a little different from the one we have at Deeka. However, the taste was still a little too rich…” Yan Zheke eyes gleamed and stared at Lou Cheng. In a rather pitiful tone, she continued, “It’s all about barbeque at the Nile. Otherwise, it would be biscuits or bread. Can’t they come out with something new? The Chinese food culture is still better with its long history and bountiful ways of cooking!”</p><p>Deeka was the capital of Nile. It was their first stop after arriving in this place and they spent three days there to see the various ancient artifacts, pyramids and mummies.</p><p>“You have to lower your demands overseas,” replied Lou Cheng with a smile as he looked at Yan Zheke. “We still have one more stop here before going over to the great grass plains. It will definitely be different in that place.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Yan Zheke eyes lit up and laughed, “I was thinking just now. If you are an overbearing CEO, how would you have answered me just now?”</p><p>Lou Cheng thought about it, hold his laughter back and said, “I will reserve the entire kitchen and make you some egg fried rice. The egg must be from chickens reared in the mountains of Xiushan and sent over through air!”</p><p>“That isn’t overbearing enough… You should be buying this restaurant and have several chefs sent over by plane to cook Chinese food for us!” Yan Zhele looked up and mocked the overbearing CEO enthusiastically.</p><p>After having the barbequed meat and specialty drinks, the couple returned to the hotel. One of them rested while the other thought about the itinerary for the next day.</p><p>Half an hour later, Yan Zheke overcame her obstacles and stood up. She stretched herself and maintained her composure until her mind was full. She contracted her breathing and blood flow and allowed her force, mind and others to collapse inwards and congregate within her lower abdomen into a ball.</p><p>At the end of July, she had grasped the concept of withdrawing. Under the guidance of Lou Cheng, she started breaking through to the Dan stage. This was a process and not just a single point.</p><p>Initially, Lou Cheng had used his conflicting supernatural abilities of Ice and Fire. Through rotations of the supernatural abilities, he achieved balanced and formed his Dan. This time, he asked Yan Zheke to use her “Earth” supernatural ability as “Yang” and her own power as “Yin”. With her mind guiding and her breathing and blood flow as supplements, the two conflicting types started to rotate in balance. Gradually, there were signs of her achieving the Dan. In about seven to eight days time, Yan Zheke should be able to use this method to fully enter the Dan stage.</p><p>While Yan Zheke practiced, Lou Cheng didn’t slack off. He placed his right hand on the shoulder of his wife and constantly listened to the minute changes inside of her. Corroborating with the experiences he could recall from the past, he hoped to find the crux.</p><p>They repeated the process several times. Even though Yan Zheke was very enthusiastic about completing her dream of reaching the Dan stage, she didn’t want to exhaust herself or use the Swordsman or Wholeness Formulas. In the end, she couldn’t complete it before fatigue set in. As it got later at night, she lay flat on the bed and wasn’t willing to move another inch.</p><p>“I’m drenched in perspiration…” She said satisfactorily. “But I don’t feel like moving at all. I don’t feel like taking a shower either”</p><p>All I want is to lie down here comfortably and have Cheng give me a massage.</p><p>“You will feel more comfortable if you take a hot shower.” Lou Cheng said as he massaged her. “Didn’t we see the notice from the hotel just now? There would be no power later which means no hot water. The water might be stopped too.”</p><p>“No, no, no.” Yan Zheke tilted her body and swung her slightly drench hair. She sunk her head into the pillow and looked like she wouldn’t cooperate unless Lou Cheng resorted to violence.</p><p>“Who’s the one who always asks me to go and have a shower? Who’s the one who is most fond of showering?” Lou Cheng broke into laughter and said.</p><p>“I’m going to stink you to death later!” replied Yan Zheke “resentfully”.</p><p>“I’m fine with it. I’m just afraid you can’t stand it yourself.,” laughed Lou Cheng as he turned his little fairy girl around. She squinted her eyes and looked out of the window.</p><p>“Cheng!” Yan Zheke pouted and continued, “If there’s no power, you will be responsible for heating the water! If there’s no water, you will freeze the water in the air and turn them into water! Didn’t you say that you are a multi-functional household robot?”</p><p>“I have to save up my Ice Force in preparation for the air-condition at night.,” explained Lou Cheng as he attempted to pull Yan Zheke up.</p><p>“No, no, no…” She shook her head violently, raised her right leg and pressed it against Lou Cheng. She even used her repulsive force!</p><p>Lou Cheng easily broke through her force and grabbed onto her leg. Lou Cheng extended his fingers and tickled it a little, making Yan Zheke wriggle like a fish and laugh out loud with a little embarrassment and annoyance. After which, she quickly retracted her leg and started fighting while sitting upright with Lou Cheng.</p><p>After fooling around for some time, the room started to heat up.</p><p>Suddenly, the girl panted and said, “Go and take a shower first… Go and take a shower first!”</p><p>“Previously, who’s the one who says she doesn’t want to shower?” Lou Cheng said ambiguously.</p><p>“Don’t you know that girls are always changing their minds!” Yan Zheke struggled with all her might.</p><p>“Then let’s go and take a shower.” Lou Cheng carried Yan Zheke up.</p><p>“No, No! I don’t want to shower with you!”</p><p>The topic seemed to be back to the initial question but silence followed.</p><p>Intense panting ensued and after an unknown amount of time, the couple laid on the bed. One of them was physically satisfied while the other had a rosy red face.</p><p>“I’m thinking of a technical issue…” said Lou Cheng in deep thought.</p><p>“I’m not listening! I’m not going to listen! It must be very dirty!” Yan Zheke closed her eyes and shook her head.</p><p>“I’m talking about your supernatural ability..” Lou Cheng broke into laughter. Before he could continue, he was disrupted by the girl, “I’ve already said that I’m not listening! Your thinking is so dirty!”</p><p>As they were immersed in peals of laughter, they suddenly heard a loud explosion. It seemed like there was an explosion somewhere in the city.</p><p>After which, incessant explosions sounded from various places of the city.</p><p>“What just happened?” Lou Cheng quickly sat up.</p><p>Yan Zheke picked up her phone and happened to see a piece of news notification. It was from the embassy and stated:</p><p>Unrest broke out at the Nile and was possibly due to a coup. All citizens of China, please do not head out unnecessarily. If there’s a need, please head towards the embassy, consulate or headquarters of Chinese corporations and wait for evacuation!</p><p>At the same time, Lou Cheng also received the same piece of news. The couple looked at each other and felt that this wasn’t real.</p><p>They just happened to encounter such a big incident?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
