Another one of your cooking sessions?” asked Qi Fang, recalling what had happened back during the period of moving.</p><p>…Forget about that already, Mom… Lou Cheng grinned. “Just a candid video.”</p><p>“Hurry up then, I still need to get the groceries. You should have called yesterday, then I wouldn’t be in such a hurry!” grumbled Qi Fang incessantly.</p><p>Her face is written with visible disdain… thought Lou Cheng in amusement as he got up, walked, and stood under the suspending calendar. He then opened the camera and switched it to the recording interface.</p><p>Taking the phone, Qi Fang asked uncertainly, “So I just have to press here?”</p><p>“Yes, then let it record for 20 to 30 seconds before pressing it again,” emphasized Lou Cheng. “Please start when I tell you to do so.”</p><p>“Okay, okay. So naggy,” Qi Fang took two steps back and adjusted the screen to position her son in the center.</p><p>In the past, Lou Zhicheng had artistic aspirations and loved photography, often borrowing his friends’ cameras. Qi Fang, going along with his hobbies, also learned a few basic photography techniques. This was the reason why Lou Cheng had a few thick photo albums that contained many embarrassing memories from his childhood. The couple only got rid of the hobby when Lou Zhicheng’s business shut down and had to work his ass off to bring home the bacon.</p><p>“Start!” Forming a stance before the calendar, Lou Cheng slowly pushed out a punch and extended a kick forward. His movements were natural and composed, yet profound and graceful. It was much more refined compared to the gramps and grannies doing Taichi on squares.</p><p>He lowered his shoulders, but a sudden chill surged through his body before he could push his left hand out. Almost immediately, his arm could feel nothing but numbness and coldness.</p><p>Lou Cheng had planned to use Encountering Gods In The Voids to control his body and jerk his shoulder so that his arm will be pushed out like an external weapon, but his delayed movements gave way to an obvious pause.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Qi Fang asked in surprise.</p><p>Lou Cheng hurriedly concealed his impatience, summoning a smile.</p><p>“The posture just now didn’t feel right. It wasn’t artistic enough. Take it again, Mom. Take two.”</p><p>“Woah, someone’s getting obsessed over appearances!” Not realizing anything peculiar, Qi Fang poked fun at her son.</p><p>‘Fashion over comfort, even during winter’ was the most popular imported phrase in Xiushan.</p><p>Lou Cheng looked down and explained with a smile.</p><p>“Mom, I am, after all, a public figure now.”</p><p>After a short break, he demonstrated seven to eight more training move sets. Since the duration of filming was short and his control was on point, he managed to avoid energy backflow and successfully produced a recording.</p><p>Lou Cheng took his phone back, then stood on the spot and watched as his Mom left pushing a shopping trolley. He let out a long sigh when he heard the slam of the door.</p><p>Adjusting his mood, he chatted with Yan Zheke, then logged in to the Weibo application and uploaded the video, along with the caption—”Recuperating!”</p><p>It wasn’t long before his Weibo post blew up. Lou Cheng skimmed through the sea of replies.</p><p>“I’m so glad you are okay!”</p><p>“Woah, he came back to life!”</p><p>“Are you doing Taichi, Grampa Lou?”</p><p>“You are perfectly fine! All those people got worried over nothing!”</p><p>“It’s really recorded today…”</p><p>“Hnnnnnng, I’m literally shaking right now! Hug me Lord Damn!”</p><p>“I’m crying my eyes out! Give me a hug little Brahman!”</p><p>“So how did you get injured? Was it really an assault?”</p><p>“The assault theory is complete BS. Tell me, which Inhuman is powerful enough to inflict grievous wounds on Lou Cheng? And if it had been a Physical Invulnerability Expert, he wouldn’t have been just gravely wounded!”</p><p>…</p><p>Amidst the lively discussion, the gloominess that had enveloped the hearts of his fans was completely swept away.</p><p>…</p><p>In consideration of her son’s ravenous appetite, Qi Fang bought an abundance of food ingredients. Pushing her shopping trolley, she arrived back at the foot of the flat.</p><p>Under a tree’s umbrage a distance away, a reporter with resin lens glasses was eyeing her stealthily.</p><p>She’s buying this much food? But I didn’t see a large flow of guests today…he thought to himself.</p><p>Could it be… Lou Cheng is back? It does feel like his previous video was taken at home!</p><p>The past few days of staking out weren’t for nothing!</p><p>The thoughts made the reporter so excited his pores expanded, knowing that he’s onto a big scoop.</p><p>Silently counting down, he waited for darkness to fall before following a resident into the lift and stopping at the pre-scouted doorstep.</p><p>Thump, thump, thump! He rapped on the door.</p><p>“Who is it?” asked Lou Zhicheng, who was in the living room reading news. Habitually, he opened the anti-theft door without looking through the peephole and came face to face with the stranger.</p><p>“Hello, I’m a reporter from Xin Province Evening Daily Online, and I would like to have an interview with Lou Cheng,” demanded the reporter in an air of entitlement, smiling.</p><p>It was only during the past year that Lou Zhicheng first got interviewed by the Xiushan media, being invited to programs like ‘A Timeline of Lou Cheng’s Growth’ and ‘Parenting the Heavenly Son of China’. Those were all pre-scheduled, so he lacked experience in the handling of such things. Subconsciously, he turned and called out in the direction of the room.</p><p>“Cheng, the reporter’s asking for you.”</p><p>He’s really here! The report felt ecstatic, dying to use the digital camera hanging at his chest.</p><p>Lou Cheng was not in the mood to meet strangers and especially didn’t want to get interviewed, which would expose his condition to the public. He drew a breath and walked to the doorway of the room with his hand covering half his face.</p><p>“Please contact the Longhu Club External Affairs Department if you want to schedule an interview.”</p><p>“Shut the door, Dad!”</p><p>“…Okay.” Briefly stunned, Lou Zhicheng slammed the door shut.</p><p>The reporter didn’t attempt to force himself in, knowing that he was up against a monster that could tear a tiger or leopard apart. Even if he was injured and is currently recuperating, it’s not as if he stood any chances against him. Plus, with Longhu Club at his back, he couldn’t fabricate an article like ‘Lou Cheng assaults reporter’ either.</p><p>Of course, he wasn’t disappointed at all with what he had. The encounter itself was enough to secure the headline!</p><p>He didn’t leave, but leaned beside the lift and began editing the contents on his phone.</p><p>“Lou Cheng makes a secret return home, shies away from interviews and actively avoids attention! There might be more to his incident than what we know!”</p><p>Well, I only said might!</p><p>Once the article went online, it provoked a new wave of speculations and debates, which was initially dying down. Reporters swarmed his house, pushing and shoving among themselves for the exclusive scoop.</p><p>Under the constant harassment, Lou Cheng’s patience ran dry and eventually had to resort to requesting security from the Longhu Club. With them stationed at the door, all the reporters were stopped. Security staffs escorted his Mom and Dad to work, while the military assigned personnel protected them from the shadows.</p><p>Still, there were guests that couldn’t be pushed away. After the Longhu Club External Affairs Team turned down the visiting request from the Xiushan government top-brass, Director Xing Chengwu stepped into Lou Cheng’s home as a senior, burdened with hopes and expectations.</p><p>“Please have a seat, Uncle Xing,” Lou Cheng endeavored to relax and act naturally.</p><p>If he merely came as a senior visitor and didn’t do anything unnecessary, I should be able to tough it out until he leaves. Mhm. Without physical exertion, it wouldn’t be much different from when I dealt with my cousins, uncles, aunties, and grandparents.</p><p>Without reservation, Xing Chengwu plopped down in the center of the sofa. He studied Lou Cheng with a faint smile.</p><p>“You are doing well.”</p><p>“The recovery has been going well,” replied Lou Cheng. He leaned forward, picked up the teapot, and poured Xing Chengwu a cup of Maojian green tea.</p><p>Xing Chengwu, having a fairly high rank in the police force, have vaguely heard about the incident. After exchanging pleasantries, he asked curiously, “So the assailant really was a Physical Invulnerability Pro?”</p><p>If Lou Cheng could single-handedly kill a Physical Invulnerability Pro, that would subvert his entire understanding of Martial Arts!</p><p>“No, he practiced Martial Arts of a different system, and only developed certain traits of Physical Invulnerability,” Lou Cheng replied honestly but didn’t specify that he was a cultivator.</p><p>Xing Chengwu didn’t press on the topic, just like how Peng Leyun, Ren Li, and Ann Chaoyang tactfully skipped through the parts where Lou Cheng chose to be vague or was unwilling to explain.</p><p>They chatted for a bit, then, noting the fatigue on Lou Cheng’s face, Xing Chengwu finished his cup of tea and stood up with a hearty laugh. “Having just recovered, you ought to rest more. I shall not take up any more of your time. Swing by my house when you have fully recovered.”</p><p>“Certainly,” Lou Cheng smiled as he stood up to accompany him to the door.</p><p>Watching as Xing Chengwu left, his tired expression vanished at once. But, before long, his muscles began convulsing, causing him to grimace. Perspiration beaded on his forehead.</p><p>It took him a moment to revitalize.</p><p>When Xing Chengwu had left the Lou household, he willingly approached the reporters, announcing in a stentorian voice, “What could happen to him? He’s as fit as a bull!”</p><p>After that incident, reporters no longer swarmed to his house. Still, some remained, loitering around, waiting to intercept Lou Cheng.</p><p>After another two or three days, more visitors came. This time, it was his elder cousin Lou Yuanwei and Erzi, Lou Yuanchang.</p><p>In the past few months, after being introduced to the ways of society by Erzi, Lou Yuanwei began to realize that his current social standing was largely dependant on his younger cousin’s status and power. Therefore, he was more worried than anyone when he heard about Lou Cheng’s injury. When he had confirmed with his own eyes that Lou Cheng was okay, he was exceedingly relieved.</p><p>“Pour whatever you want to drink and take whatever you want to take. We are family, so don’t hold back. It would save me from exertion too,” Lou Cheng, leaning against the sofa, said with a smile.</p><p>In similar circumstances, he could last a few hours without his sequela triggering. It was even better at night since it rarely occurred.</p><p>“Okay! I love those words!” Erzi smiled as he helped himself, actually making himself at home.</p><p>He returned to his company after dinner. After sending off Lou Yuanwei, he gazed at the scenery through the window as he waited for the arrival of his lover.</p><p>About ten minutes later, a well-dressed, coquettish woman entered the office.</p><p>“You went to visit Lou Cheng?” she inquired.</p><p>“Yeah, he seemed fine,” Erzi replied with a smile.</p><p>“But I heard his injuries were very serious and severe. Maybe he’s just feigning to be fine… Why do you bother visiting him?” giggled the woman.</p><p>A smile came to Erzi’s face.</p><p>“Even if he no longer has hopes of attaining Physical Invulnerability, he’s still an influential Inhuman Mighty One. Plus, he has the Ice God Sect and the Longhu Club at his back, not to mention an Inhuman Mighty One Master!”</p><p>“Anyway, even if he’s crippled, what do I stand to lose from visiting and showing concern? The only loss is if I don’t go at all!”</p><p>“Right, right, right. You always know what you are doing,” the woman said as she threw herself on him.</p><p>…</p><p>At around dawn, Lou Cheng got off his bed and began warming-up his body. He first started with entering Solemn Silence, then slowly demonstrated a set of moves.</p><p>At the moment, his body didn’t allow him to do any real training. Even with the improved regeneration from the Forwarding Formula, he still needed at least a month to begin on recovery exercises. Presently, all he could manage is move around a little and coordinate his heart and mind to aid his recovery.</p><p>As such, he didn’t need to go to the park, especially with those reporters lurking around.</p><p>Slowly punching out from his waist, Lou Cheng’s entire body froze except for his head and limbs. He couldn’t move his torso at all. It was as though it had been completely encased in ice.</p><p>In the ten or so minutes that followed, the same thing happened repeatedly. Vexed, he couldn’t help but want to punch himself.</p><p>Hoo. The first time Lin Que got injured, Master told him it was a blessing in disguise. With the comparison, he managed to grasp the concept of silence and withdrawing… I shouldn’t rush things. Instead, I should try to learn something from not being able to participate in actual combat, like how Martial Arts interacts with my body, or how to remain calm… Reminding himself, Lou Cheng calmed his emotions and began practicing again. Yet, how could he adapt in such a short time, or get into the right state of mind so easily?</p><p>Before he had realized it himself, a month had elapsed since he returned home. At the nearby military base, he met the researcher from last time.</p><p>“We have not—have yet to find anything useful,” said the Technician Geek as he dipped his head in shame.</p><p>“It happens. If every research succeed on the first try, we would have been the rulers of the universe by now,” said Lou Cheng, summoning a smile despite his disappointment.</p><p>The military personnel nodded, and with new found zeal and vigor he said, “But after sorting through Ge Hui’s possessions, we found a cultivation manual possessing the core elements of cultivation!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
