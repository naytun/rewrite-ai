How could Geezer Shi want him to go to Pingjiang even without giving him a hint?</p><p>One concerning notion after another rushed through his brain. “Human trafficking? Pyramid sellers?</p><p>Could it be that Geezer Shi has another ‘part-time job’? Is it dangerous to do this?”</p><p>Cai Zongming saw Lou Cheng’s worried expression and patted him on the shoulder. “Hey! Cheng, let’s go have a smoke.”</p><p>Thinking for a while, Lou Cheng followed him outside. Arriving at the patio, he rested his hands on the railing and looked down at the courtyard of the 7th dormitory building, where so many students were coming and going. Some of them carried thermoses or backpacks, and others held midnight snacks. Some were young couples in love, and outside the main gate under the gaze of the dormitory guard, they stared at one another longingly, hesitating to part ways.</p><p>Songcheng University’s dormitory buildings formed their miniature kind of neighborhood. Four units perfectly surrounded the courtyard, which contained flower terraces, street lamps, and ping pong tables. Lou Cheng’s building, Unit 2, just happened to face the main entrance directly.</p><p>“What’s wrong, Cheng, something on your mind?” Cai Zongming took out a cigarette and stuck it in his mouth, but didn’t light it.</p><p>Yesterday Lou Cheng had explained to his roommates that he was going to give up smoking. Cai Zongming thought this was ridiculous, but when he brought it up to his girlfriend while video chatting with her, she’d forced him also to quit smoking, saying that he should follow Lou Cheng’s example.</p><p>Lou Cheng decided to reveal a little bit. “Casanova, um, forget it. Better call you Talker, so you don’t reminisce too much. Remember when I signed up for the Martial Arts Club special training? Half the reason was to pursue Yan Zheke, which you know. But the other half was that while standing in the Yin-Yang Stance I discovered I was able to reach the Remain in One Meditation. Afterward, Geezer Shi noticed this and prepared to train me.”</p><p>Cai Zongming smirked, “Cheng, stop boasting. You and I can still be good friends.”</p><p>“Really.” Lou Cheng did his best to show sincerity in his eyes.</p><p>Cai Zongming stared at him, “Really?”</p><p>“Really!” Lou Cheng’s tone was full of confidence.</p><p>“Well done! Cheng, I couldn’t tell!” Cai Zongming knew what kind of person Lou Cheng was and at last was convinced that it was true. He slapped Lou Cheng on his shoulder and said with a laugh, “Don’t forget me when you’ve hit the big time. If you become the backbone of the Martial Arts Club afterward, I’m sure my status will increase twofold. It looks like some things that they say are true, even foolish people with simple minds can easily enter meditation.”</p><p>“Can’t you say something a little more pleasant?”</p><p>Cai Zongming glanced at him. “Yes! Yes! Yes! You can’t judge a book by its cover after all. I didn’t realize I was in the presence of a major celebrity. Brother Lou Cheng, no, Uncle Cheng, allow me to grovel at your feet!” Cai Zongming said dramatically.</p><p>As the two boys laughed, Lou Cheng continued to say, “Just now, Geezer Shi gave me a mysterious phone call. He asked me to reserve a train ticket and go with him to Pingjiang tomorrow night.”</p><p>“Pingjiang?” Cai Zongming asked unknowingly, “The capital of Shanbei province?”</p><p>“Yes, I have no idea what we’re going there for, so I’m a bit uneasy.” Lou Cheng sighed.</p><p>“Geezer Shi was personally invited by the headmaster, so it shouldn’t be a problem. Furthermore, Cheng, you’re not terribly handsome, don’t have any unique talents, and certainly aren’t rich. So why would he bother to trick you? Perhaps it could be a University martial arts meeting of some sort. After all, Shanbei University is in Pingjiang,” Cai Zongming said caustically to Lou Cheng.</p><p>“That makes sense,” Lou Cheng nodded his head.</p><p>Could it be that Geezer Shi simply wanted to observe the condition of last year’s Shanbei University’s Martial Arts Association champions, and he was bringing his protege along so that he could write the travel off as a public expense?</p><p>But then why did he have to pay for his own ticket…</p><p>Seeing Lou Cheng relaxing a bit, Cai Zongming changed the topic and with a dirty smile said, “I’ve heard there’re a few perverted old geezers who go because their bodies are too old. Since they can’t become young again, they’re gay for little kids or young boys bodies. It’s all a pretext to try and relive their youth again. What do you think, would Geezer Shi…”</p><p>“Pfft!” Lou Cheng wanted to throw up at what Cai Zongming had described, but in his heart, a slight more fear and worry were aroused.</p><p>What if?</p><p>It was a one in a million chance, but who knew?</p><p>Cai Zongming convulsed with laughter and afterward said with a devilish grin, “However, you don’t have to be worried, Cheng. Even if Geezer Shi is a pervert, his target should be Lin Que, me or someone else who is talented and good-looking. He wouldn’t fancy you.”</p><p>“Thanks for the consolation!” Lou Cheng said, gnashing his teeth in anger.</p><p>Being interrupted by Cai Zongming like this, he recovered a better mood. He used the remaining hot water in the pitcher to wash his face and soak his feet. After brushing his teeth, he headed to the bed and didn’t dare open his computer, afraid that he would be enticed by Cai Zongming and wouldn’t want to sleep as a result.</p><p>Lying on the bed, Lou Cheng took out his phone and clicked his QQ directly, not even lingering on the forum.</p><p>“I’ve got some gossip for you,” Lou Cheng sent a smiling emoji to Yan Zheke.</p><p>After a dozen of seconds, Yan Zheke replied, “What gossip? About high school?”</p><p>“No! No! When I got out of class and back to the dorm, I found out that the guys had a social meetup with the girl’s dorm of the Department of Chinese Language and Literature, Guo Qing’s dorm!” Lou Cheng spoke deliberately, obscurely indicating that he hadn’t participated in the social meetup.</p><p>Yan Zheke sent a Doge emoji. “What a coincidence! How did you all meet up with Guo Qing’s dorm?”</p><p>“Old Qiu from our dorm saw that someone had written a phone number from a girl’s dorm asking for a social meetup on top of a desk in a classroom. They were afraid it was a practical joke, so they changed the last few numbers and used the number 32 from our dorm number 302 as their lucky number to replace. It turned out to be Guo Qing’s dorm across from us.” Lou Cheng told the entire story from beginning to end.</p><p>“Both your dorms seem to be destined to be together. They agreed to a social meetup just like that?” Yan Zheke asked in excitement.</p><p>Lou Cheng replied with a snickering emoji. “It could be that freshmen have all just entered school. Everything seems fresh and exciting to them, and they’re also interested in trying this kind of random social meetup. Once they’re sophomores and become more sophisticated, it’ll be more difficult.”</p><p>“Maybe.” Yan Zheke sent an emoji deep in contemplation, both hands resting on its chin. “If our dorm came across this, I’m pretty sure we’d also agree. It sounds fascinating and funny.”</p><p>“That’s right. Rumor has it that Guo Qing fancies Old Qiu from our dorm!” Lou Cheng revealed the gossip.</p><p>“Oh?” Yan Zheke sent an emoji with two eyes wide open. “Really?”</p><p>“That’s what they say, all the guys in our dorm feel that way. All the roommates in their dorm secretly say the same as well.” Lou Cheng didn’t dare confirm.</p><p>“Wow!” Yan Zheke replied with lightning speed, “What kind of guy is Old Qiu? I need to help Qing check this out!”</p><p>“He’s got a big and strong build and matches well with Guo Qing’s. He’s also a pretty straightforward person and easy to get along with. I figure he’s half brainiac…” Lou Cheng’s gave his own impression of Old Qiu.</p><p>Of course, as a roommate, Old Qiu was always sharing things, which was a benefit for everyone. It was just that sometimes the things he shared weren’t always to everyone’s taste.</p><p>Going in this way, the two of them talked happily and before they knew, it was 10:30 pm. Fighting through his own heartache, Lou Cheng reluctantly said good night to Yan Zheke, saying he was too occupied and exhausted because of the special training and class every day.</p><p>…</p><p>During pair exercise, Geezer Shi announced that today’s special training and Saturday’s martial arts lesson ended, and Sunday’s special training would be postponed until 9 o’clock because he had business to attend to.</p><p>This news immediately drew out a cheer. The members who had joined special training exclaimed that they could finally sleep in for an extra hour.</p><p>After several days of “torment”, a few freshmen students had dropped out from the special training and only two left hanging on. But from Lou Cheng’s perspective, he wouldn’t see them next week.</p><p>Just then, he saw Yan Zheke and Guo Qing voluntarily coming toward him side by side, seemingly more acquainted with him than several days ago.</p><p>“Cheng, right? It turns out that we had joined the social meetup with your dorm.” As if holding a meeting, Guo Qing got straight to the point and said bluntly, “It feels like a coincidence. That’s right, why didn’t you join?”</p><p>“I had stuff going on back then, so I let Little Ming… uh… Cai Zongming replace me.” Lou Cheng glanced at Yan Zheke and saw that her expression was just as accusatory.</p><p>With no more questions to ask, Guo Qing started to speak, “Most of us are members of the Martial Arts Club, and also come from the dorms involved in the social meetup; it does seem to be predestined. Also, it was delightful to talk yesterday evening, so we should schedule another one. Next weekend or two weeks from now, should our two dorms go mountain hiking, then perhaps go out to have fun at the karaoke? Or maybe find a place where we could have a barbecue?”</p><p>This girl was quite outspoken with quite an executive ability… Lou Cheng hesitated for a moment and didn’t directly answer, trying to think of a certain excuse to get away from it.</p><p>In addition, he really should discuss this with Old Qiu, Qiang, and Model Worker, and shouldn’t rush into a decision on his own. However, seeing their praise for Zhuang Xiaojun, he thought they would absolutely insist on going.</p><p>While he was hesitating, Guo Qing turned her head and looked at Yan Zheke. “Cai Zongming was there yesterday, it wouldn’t be good not to invite him next time. If we add Cheng, then there would be five boys. Although it doesn’t matter that the girls are fewer in number, you and Cheng are old classmates and you two are so familiar with each other, so, how about going together?”</p><p>Yan Zheke got interested and said, “Sure! It’ll be my first social meetup.”</p><p>“Then it’s decided! Next weekend or the weekend after we’ll have another social meetup!” Lou Cheng replied decisively.</p><p>As for Qiang and Little Ming? Their opinions could be ignored!</p><p>Guo Qing’s face showed her happiness. “Good, we can go back and check out the timetable of each one, to find out which day is most suitable.”</p><p>This chat was to everyone’s satisfaction.</p><p>…</p><p>When it came to asking for another social meetup between the dorms, a young male with raging hormones naturally wouldn’t have any hesitations in agreeing, and Cai Zongming was also abundantly interested in any similar activities.</p><p>Saturday afternoon was the rare period in which Lou Cheng could relax. Skimming through forums, reading novels, talking with Yan Zheke and playing online games with other roommates who hadn’t gone outside, he felt more relaxed and satisfied than he had in a long time.</p><p>When it was 5 o’clock, he put some clean clothes in his bag and went outside to take a bus toward the city center. Afterward, he booked a car online to take him to the train station.</p><p>“Fortunately, mom gave me 800 more yuan this month. Otherwise, I definitely wouldn’t have enough money…” Lou Cheng followed the tides of people, hastening his step as he got through the security check and felt for his wallet.</p><p>Arriving next to the ticket checking counter, it’d just become 6 o’clock. Lou Cheng chatted idly on QQ and forums while he waited for Geezer Shi to arrive.</p><p>At 6:40, Geezer Shi approached, wearing an old-fashioned DIY T-shirt. Impressed, he said,</p><p>“Not bad, very punctual.”</p><p>In the early morning when training, Lou Cheng was very focused and hadn’t asked more questions about having to go to Pingjiang. Now seeing Geezer Shi, Cai Zongming’s previous talk about perverts flashed through his mind, and he involuntarily moved back a step to create some distance.</p><p>“What are you looking at?” Geezer Shi looked at him suspiciously.</p><p>“No… nothing, just curious what we’re going to Pingjiang for,” Lou Cheng stammered. He cursed Zongming in his mind, “Son of a bitch, it’s all because of that nonsense Little Ming said, it’s making me all confused!”</p><p>“When the time comes, I’ll let you know.” Geezer Shi didn’t seem to be too concerned.</p><p>As their tickets were inspected and they got on the train to sit down, Lou Cheng was anxious and restless. He felt uneasy, and every time he asked a question, Geezer Shi would only answer with a short sentence.</p><p>Fortunately, their two tickets were not in the same carriage. He sighed in relief.</p><p>It took only one and a half hour from Songcheng to Pingjiang. Before Lou Cheng had the chance to sleep much, they arrived at the long-established provincial capital.</p><p>As they sat in the taxi, Lou Cheng realized unsurprisingly that Geezer Shi’s destination was Shanbei University. He relaxed a bit, but once again braced himself as the two of them walked into a small guesthouse-type hotel.</p><p>If there were two beds in a standard room, one room… Lou Cheng could feel himself becoming more nervous.</p><p>“Two rooms.” Geezer Shi took out money and his ID.</p><p>Hearing these words, Lou Cheng finally relaxed and in his mind cursed Cai Zongming for talking such rubbish before!</p><p>“Get up at the same time tomorrow.” Before entering his room, Geezer Shi gave this instruction.</p><p>Later that night, Lou Cheng could occasionally hear lung rattling coughs next door. The next morning he got up at 5:40 and after he finished washing up, he left the hotel together with Geezer Shi and entered the campus of Shanbei University.</p><p>Arriving in a corner of the large sports field, Geezer Shi observed for a moment and pointed to a group of boys training in the distance.</p><p>“Can you see that person?”</p><p>Lou Cheng strained his eyes. Through the darkness that still immersed Shanbei University, under an apricot tree with yellow leaves falling, he could see there was a boy in a white martial arts suit in the process of boxing training. Due to the time of day, it was quite dark, so he couldn’t see his appearance clearly. But from his punches and kicks alone, he was able to perceive his high martial arts level.</p><p>“I see him,” he replied in confusion.</p><p>Had they come to Pingjiang just for this guy?</p><p>Geezer Shi chuckled. “He’s called Peng Leyun. He entered Shanbei University last year. At that time he already had access to the Dadan and the Qi Arising from within the Body state. He’s a Professional Eighth Rank. He defeated the Martial Arts Club manager and guided Shanbei University through to the semifinals, and became the champion of the National University Martial Arts Competition.</p><p>“He’s Peng Leyun?” Lou Cheng had seen this name quite a few times on online forums. He’d never thought that there’d be a day when he’d see him in person.</p><p>This man was said to be a genius amongst geniuses, among the top three most outstanding geniuses.</p><p>Geezer Shi nodded his head faintly. “He’s the inheritor of the Shangqing Sect and the martial nephew of the Qian ‘Warrior Sage’ Donglou. Ever since his childhood, he had been prone to reflecting and often said ‘Martial arts shall follow the laws of nature, and what is nature? It’s Physics and Biology.’ So last year he shocked everyone by entering Shanbei University’s Physics Department.</p><p>“As your teacher, bringing you here is just to let you have a look at this kind of true genius, at his background and identity. In martial arts, there’s no room for the slightest bit of slacking off. Even if he ordinarily wants to have fun, go out to clubs, play games… every day at 5:30 he’ll start on time. No matter which day you come, you’ll always see him. Look, right now as we stand here planning, just as always you can see his silhouette.</p><p>“A genius like him still works that hard. Do you really think that you can surpass them without more pain and hardships?”</p><p>Lou Cheng first was astounded at Peng Leyun’s background but was gradually shaken by Geezer Shi’s words. If he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, if he’d been able to prepare himself mentally beforehand, this kind of scene may not have had such a strong effect on him. By devising this temporary scheme, coming to Shanbei and seeing Peng Leyun rise at 5 a.m. as he always had, pouring his blood sweat and tears into his training, giving it everything that he had, you couldn’t help but have your spirit shaken.</p><p>In this comparison, there was also clarity!</p><p>This was a true genius. Yet he continued like this, what did that say about himself?</p><p>“You see it, you understand it, then let’s go back.” Geezer Shi turned around and started to leave, his hands behind his back.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
