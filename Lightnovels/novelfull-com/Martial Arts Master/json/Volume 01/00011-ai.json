  "body": "<p>Filled with ambition and desire, Lou Cheng was not just eager for the next day's martial arts training; he was also incredibly focused in class. It felt as if he was compensating for lost time, striving to absorb as much knowledge as he could. His unusual dedication caught the attention of Cai Zongming, who couldn't help but tease him. \"You're just trying to impress a girl, aren't you?\" Cai Zongming laughed. He claimed Lou Cheng was the perfect example of how men operated—driven by instincts and hormones. \"You've betrayed our revolutionary principles, leaving me to uphold them alone!\"</p>\n<p>After the evening session of \"Introduction to Calculator,\" Lou Cheng returned to his dorm and logged into the school administration website. As expected, his class schedule had changed—mornings were now free, while afternoons and evenings were jam-packed. Thursdays were the only exception, allowing him a chance to rest.</p>\n<p>\"Just another Senior Year in high school!\" he muttered, fists clenched in determination. After showering with water from a thermos, he quickly wiped his face, soaked his feet, brushed his teeth, and declined Cai Zongming's and Tang Wen's invitation to play an online game. Finally, he crawled into bed early, readying himself for the next day.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng's day began not at 8 a.m., the time for special training, but at 7 a.m., a time he had set for himself, reminiscent of his high school routine. Today, he felt dissatisfied with his Yin-Yang Stance practice. He barely got a kick in before Geezer Shi called for a stop. \"Most beginners can't handle longer sessions,\" he explained. Anticipating a similar session the next day, Lou Cheng resolved to start practicing 40 minutes earlier.</p>\n<p>As he lay in bed, he instinctively reached for his mobile phone, logging onto QQ and refreshing the forum page of \"Longhu Club.\" One post caught his eye, its title boldly declaring: \"Dong Baxian: I, one of today’s top three!\"</p>\n<p>\"Such arrogance,\" Lou Cheng scoffed, clicking to read the post. It featured an interview with Dong Baxian, the chief master of Yanzhao League.</p>\n<p>Dong Baxian, a First Pin, had been a formidable presence for years. Before the Legendary Twins rose to fame, he had won four titles, including two championships. Known as the \"Warrior King,\" he was infamous for his prideful nature. People had a love-hate relationship with him; they either idolized him or despised him.</p>\n<p>In the interview, he proclaimed, \"Except for the Masters of Restriction, I am among the current world's top three!\"</p>\n<p>On the Longhu Club forum, most members were fans of \"Dragon King\" Qitao. Lou Cheng could already predict the comments that would follow.</p>\n<p>As expected, \"Pig-Riding Knight,\" the forum moderator, kicked things off. \"Yao Ming and I are both around 1.9 m tall. Though I dislike Gentleman Qian, I must admit that after the Master of Restriction, he and Dragon King are on the same level. Dong Baxian is essentially stealing their thunder.\"</p>\n<p>\"Sun\" chimed in with a laughing emoji. \"Dong Baxian isn't wrong to claim he's top three. If you take away Dragon King and 'fake' Gentleman Qian, even with foreign experts, he might have a shot at being number one. So, from that angle, he’s right. It just sounds ridiculous, LOL.\"</p>\n<p>This comment came from a popular girl on the forum, known for her selfies that garnered hundreds of responses, often more than the moderator's posts.</p>\n<p>\"Outspoken,\" who had encouraged Lou Cheng to jog for fitness, added, \"Just look in the mirror. How many titles has Dong Baxian won since Dragon King’s first? Just one! He only got that 'Master' title because both sides were too exhausted to continue fighting. He had it easy!\"</p>\n<p>\"No Hooligans\" remarked, \"Dong Baxian will never be humble. He’s not that much of a master and only keeps his position through shameless boasting.\"</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng chuckled at the comment and replied, \"Talent with words!\"</p>\n<p>\"Do not do rogue\" and \"Okamoto's Fan,\" both seasoned members, were busy teasing another high-profile member with a feminine-sounding ID—\"Beautiful World.\"</p>\n<p>\"No Hooligans\" quickly responded to Lou Cheng, \"Haha, I’m not talented, but 'Quit Gambling Bar' and the other old Bros are. Those are the words of their spiritual leader, Qie Guevara. I just borrowed them.\"</p>\n<p>\"Quit Gambling Bar?\" Lou Cheng asked, confused.</p>\n<p>\"No Hooligans\" explained, \"Haven't you seen that video? A thief was caught, and when interviewed, he said: 'Never expect me to work or do cheap jobs, never in this life. If you ask me why not start a business, I don’t know how to run one either. Only by stealing can I maintain my life like this. Going to jail feels like going home...' His reply was so funny it went viral. They called him Qie Guevara because it sounded like the revolutionary Che Guevara, and the 'Quit Gambling Bar' old Bros regard him as their spiritual leader.\"</p>\n<p>\"Okamoto's Fan\" added, \"Quit Gambling Bar is a place for people to quit gambling, but when a bunch of gambling addicts gather, they just talk about how to win money. They call themselves old Bros, even when they're deep in debt. They can still lounge at home, posting comments on forums. When we say hundreds, we mean hundreds of thousands. Even while running from creditors, they can still joke around. You have to admire their swag! I often visit that bar; they’re just too witty and entertaining.\"</p>\n<p>\"I Love Feng Xiaomang\" interjected, \"Don’t lead Schrodinger’s Tiger astray! He’s just a college freshman. Anyway, I adore the Bros in Quit Gambling Bar. Their most quotable line is: 'Since I managed to borrow money with my ability, why should I return it?'\"</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng couldn't help but laugh. \"Totally reasonable, I can't argue with that.\"</p>\n<p>Then, \"Dumplings for Sale,\" a girl, asked Lou Cheng, \"How was your first class at the Martial Arts Club, Little Tiger?\"</p>\n<p>\"The new coach was amazing. He jumped right into teaching us Thunder Sect’s Yin-Yang Stance,\" Lou Cheng replied, proudly sharing his experience. He conveniently left out that he had successfully mastered Remain in One.</p>\n<p>\"Who knows! Maybe, Little Tiger, you’ll be our forum’s first expert! (pat on the shoulder)!\" \"Dumplings for Sale\" joked.</p>\n<p>The boastful \"Road to the Arena\" chimed in, \"Here we go, a traitor you’ll be!\"</p>\n<p>The topics shifted rapidly, with everyone contributing to the lively chaos. It was rare for Lou Cheng to be the center of attention on the forum. He should have been engaged in the discussions, but slowly, his eyelids grew heavier. \"Jindan\" could replenish his energy and alleviate physical fatigue, but it couldn't calm his tired mind after such a hectic day.</p>\n<p>With great effort, Lou Cheng set his alarm and drifted off to sleep, his fingers still wrapped around his mobile phone.</p>\n<p>The next day, at 6:40 a.m., just five minutes before his usual high school day began, he woke up. He turned off his alarm before it could ring, saving his roommates from an unnecessary early morning wake-up.</p>\n<p>After washing up, he quietly donned a fresh martial arts suit and stepped out of the dormitory. He dashed past the big gates of the yard, running toward Weishui Lake. The scent of morning dew invigorated him.</p>\n<p>\"Ah, the beautiful world! Ah, the amazing morning air!\" he exclaimed, throwing out the poetic lines in good spirits as he ran into the tranquility of nature. Only upon closer inspection could one see the flashes of bookish students in his shadow.</p>\n<p>Upon reaching the lakeside, he sought a quiet spot. Initially, he intended to practice the standing stance, but the sight of the water inspired him. Facing the lake, he bowed three times respectfully, mumbling softly.</p>\n<p>\"I do not know who the senior was that left the Jindan, but your junior, I, was fortunate to receive it. This is our connection, and I promise that one day, when I achieve something in martial arts and can cut through water, I will seek your remains and give you the grand burial and prayers you deserve!\"</p>\n<p>Mimicking the characters from his novels, he made a promise to the original owner of the \"Jindan.\"</p>\n<p>After this little ceremony for his benefactor, he positioned himself for the Yin-Yang Stance, feet steady apart, arms raised to conceal his spirit and qi. He began to meditate, slowly allowing his body to absorb the subtle changes brought on by gravity and his core.</p>\n<p>As time passed, he gradually learned to control these changes within himself. It felt as if he was on the verge of mastering absolute control of his body through his mind.</p>\n<p>Endless mountains, endless waters of the lake!</p>\n<p>Completely immersed in his surroundings, Lou Cheng lost track of time. He was only waiting for the second alarm to ring, signaling that special training was about to begin.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, his heart skipped a beat, and his eyes flew open. In front of him stood a face, old and wrinkled, with blurry eyes staring straight at him.</p>\n<p>Startled, Lou Cheng almost threw a punch but stopped just in time. He recognized the face.</p>\n<p>\"C-c-coach Shi, why are you here?\" he stammered.</p>\n<p>Grinning widely, Geezer Shi replied, \"Why can't I be here? Yesterday, I noticed you entered a meditative state without much trouble. Hehe, if it weren't for your lack of muscles and weak build, I would have thought you had mastered the highest-level tactic—faking. I only learned to soften my aggressiveness and mastered this skill at the age of 30!\"</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng couldn't argue with that. He laughed dryly and said, \"I have no idea how I did it. I just focused on my Dantian and entered meditation.\"</p>\n<p>The coach noticed that Lou had managed to meditate! Thankfully, he hadn't detected the \"Jindan\" within Lou's body.</p>\n<p>\"It shows you have a natural talent for this,\" Geezer Shi said, his expression suddenly serious. \"Do you want to enter the actual martial arts circle in the future? Do you want to achieve Professional Ninth Pin within one or two years?\"</p>\n<p>\"Everyone has their own path, and it doesn't have to be martial arts...\" A thought flashed through Lou Cheng's mind. He remembered the crowd's excitement and Yan Zheke's admiration when Lin Que won the duel. Without hesitation, Lou Cheng declared his determination.</p>\n<p>\"Yes!\"</p>\n<p>\"Coach, do you have a way to achieve this?\"</p>\n<p>\"Of course, but you need to be my disciple first,\" Geezer Shi said proudly. \"And remember, practicing martial arts is like swimming against the current. Even if you're gifted, if you lose momentum and become complacent, reaching Professional Ninth Pin within two years will be impossible. There's no guarantee for anything. I can give you a kickstart as your master, but success depends on you and what you make of it.\"</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng nodded, understanding the weight of those words. Recalling the formalities of the martial arts circle, he said, \"Disciple pays his respect to Master!\"</p>\n<p>\"Alright, save the formalities. Today counts as your first day as my disciple.\" Then, Geezer Shi's expression shifted again, and he grinned cheekily. \"But don’t go around telling people that I’m your master.\"</p>\n<p>\"Huh? More secrets? Why not?\" Lou Cheng blurted out, surprised.</p>\n<p>\"Also, is this how we become master and disciple? It feels too informal. This doesn’t seem real at all!\"</p>\n<p>\"Even though you’re gifted, you might not succeed. It would be embarrassing if people knew I had a disciple who didn’t make it!\" Geezer Shi shot Lou Cheng a disdainful look.</p>\n<p>\"Such practicality...\" Lou Cheng thought but couldn't argue back.</p>\n<p>As if reading Lou Cheng's mind, Geezer Shi laughed heartily. \"Yes, I’m a practical person. Wait until I’m satisfied with your level, then you can tell others.\"</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng paused, then asked, \"Master, it doesn’t matter to me if I can tell others or not, but I still need to know your background and current situation?\"</p>\n<p>Geezer Shi replied, \"No need to discuss things from too long ago. But in recent years, I’ve been working with the military on a research project. You probably know that once martial arts experts reach the physical invulnerability state, they become extraordinary. They start to develop godly abilities, which strengthen over time. A portion of these abilities can be passed down to future generations. Our research focused on the relationship between martial arts and these godly abilities.\"</p>\n<p>Recalling the purple fire and thunder during the Dragon King and Warrior Sage event, Lou Cheng nodded solemnly, unable to suppress his curiosity. \"Master, what were you in charge of?\"</p>\n<p>Geezer Shi glanced at Lou Cheng briefly, his expression almost emotionless. \"Subject of study.\"</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng burst out laughing. In quick strides, Geezer Shi walked toward the Martial Arts Club arena.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng struggled to contain his laughter. Then, suddenly, he stopped. Based on what his master had just said, the research project would require powerful experts who had attained the physical invulnerability state.</p>\n<p>In other words, his master was one of those powerful experts who had reached that level?</p>\n<p>Which meant… he was one of the top three Pin experts?</p>",
