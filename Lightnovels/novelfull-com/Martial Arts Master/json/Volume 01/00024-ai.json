The hotel lobby behind them was brightly lit, casting shadows of security personnel, student council members, and other club members milling about.</p>\n<p>“The school is stingy,” Cai Zongming complained, tugging at his martial arts suit. “They make us do overnight guard duty and only provide this suit. If it weren’t for my darling wanting Liang Yifan’s autograph, I wouldn’t even be here.”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng shot him a glare. “Talker, that’s not what you said earlier. You swore we were brothers for life. You said, ‘Cheng, if you couldn’t depend on me, who else could you depend on?’ I’m here too, trying hard to get that autograph for Yan Zheke!”</p>\n<p>Cai Zongming chuckled dryly. “If I only wanted the autograph, I could have just asked you to get it for me. Didn’t Qin Mo say he’d pay for your meals for a week if you got him an autograph? If it wasn’t for our brotherhood, I wouldn’t be burning the night with you. Where’s that Liang Yifan?”</p>\n<p>“The flight was supposed to arrive at 12:05 a.m. It’s been over 40 minutes now, right? Flights are rarely late,” Lou Cheng replied, glancing outside. He saw a crowd of young fans—some walking, some holding banners, others whispering or taking photos, all buzzing with excitement.</p>\n<p>Cai Zongming marveled, “It’s the wee hours, and there are still hundreds of fans waiting. The appeal of a First-Pin expert is incredible.”</p>\n<p>“Plus, this is just what we can see,” Lou Cheng smirked. “Lucky for us, I pulled some strings with Geezer Shi. Otherwise, we wouldn’t even be this close to the door. Look at the student council and security department—they're green with envy.”</p>\n<p>“Cheng, yes, yes! I’ll say many good things about you!” Cai Zongming gave a thumbs-up. “So, after our shift ends in the morning, are you still going to martial arts practice?”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng could hide his 5 a.m. training from everyone except his roommates. He had explained that the extra training was merely to strengthen his martial arts skills.</p>\n<p>“I must go. Sleep comes after training. If I skip it for something as small as this, I’ll lose discipline and start to slack,” he replied matter-of-factly. To him, it wasn’t a chore; it was a necessity.</p>\n<p>As they chatted, the atmosphere outside grew restless. Three black sedans rolled into view.</p>\n<p>As the cars approached, the crowd erupted into screams and cheers, chanting, “Liang Yifan! Liang Yifan! Liang Yifan!”</p>\n<p>Banners were raised, some hidden and some visible under the hotel lights, with “Liang Yifan Songcheng Fan Club” boldly displayed, adding to the chaotic energy.</p>\n<p>“Hey, you at the door, move! Block off the fans and reporters!” the walkie-talkies buzzed loudly.</p>\n<p>Startled by the chaos, Lou Cheng and Cai Zongming exchanged glances before quickly joining the other security guards at the car’s door. They locked arms with the professional security officers, forming a human barrier against the frenzied fans and sneaky reporters.</p>\n<p>The crowd surged like waves crashing against the shore, threatening to break through. Fortunately, Cai Zongming’s strength as an Amateur Fifth Pin and Lou Cheng’s internal coordination helped maintain the barrier. Frustrated fans shot angry glares at them, unable to get closer to their idol.</p>\n<p>“Who knows? Maybe we’re live on the Xinghai Club or Liang Yifan fan forum, and everyone is scolding us, calling us hooligans,” Cai Zongming mused, despite the pressure.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng held his position tightly, distractedly replying, “Maybe they’ll accuse us of hitting people, using the chaos to stir trouble and create news.”</p>\n<p>Just then, the car door swung open. The crowd’s screams intensified, signaling Liang Yifan’s arrival. Unfortunately, Lou Cheng couldn’t see him, as he was facing away.</p>\n<p>The crowd’s energy surged, and just as Lou Cheng felt his arms straining against the pressure, a clear, soothing voice cut through the chaos. “Everyone, please calm down. I’m honored to receive such generous love from all of you, but it’s late. We can’t be selfish and disturb others’ rest. Please be quiet. I’m here with you.”</p>\n<p>In that rowdy environment, his voice, though ordinary, commanded silence. The crowd stopped pushing, and the area outside the hotel returned to a semblance of calm.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng and Cai Zongming turned toward the voice. Standing under the bright lights at the hotel entrance was an average-built man in a dark blue traditional martial arts suit. He exuded a strong yet calm presence that made his ordinary features fade into the background.</p>\n<p>“That’s the real Liang Yifan…” Cai Zongming whispered.</p>\n<p>Liang Yifan, in his thirties, was at the perfect age of maturity without looking too old. Facing the fans’ admiration, he smiled gently. “I’m always thankful and can never repay the love you’ve given me. So, I’ll sign an autograph for every single one of you here, until no one is left without my signature. Please line up orderly. We are learned people, and as long as we keep it down, I’ll continue signing until the last fan stands.”</p>\n<p>His words moved the crowd. Some girls wept, exclaiming how wonderful Liang Yifan was.</p>\n<p>The walkie-talkies buzzed again, “Keep them in order. Let them line up quietly.”</p>\n<p>With their duties changed, Lou Cheng and Cai Zongming got busy again, guiding fans into a line and stopping those trying to cut in. One by one, fans approached the stage for their autographs, while reporters snapped photos.</p>\n<p>As the night quieted, Cai Zongming observed Liang Yifan signing autographs under the lights. He turned to Lou Cheng, a serious look on his face. “Cheng…”</p>\n<p>“What?” Lou Cheng replied, seemingly uninterested.</p>\n<p>Cai Zongming took a deep breath. “I want to join the special training now.”</p>\n<p>“Uh…” Lou Cheng studied him closely, sensing the weight of his words.</p>\n<p>He didn’t respond further as they continued managing the crowd. Time passed, and soon it was 3 a.m. The autograph queue dwindled, but many lingered, reluctant to leave.</p>\n<p>Seeing the line shorten, Lou Cheng sighed and stepped out of the security formation. He took a few steps and found himself at the end of the queue, with only three fans ahead of him.</p>\n<p>“Hey, you there! What are you doing? Return to your position!” the walkie-talkie blared.</p>\n<p>Without hesitation, Lou Cheng switched off his walkie-talkie, feeling a surge of defiance.</p>\n<p>“They can’t punish me for this minor infraction, right? Even if they do, I’ll gladly accept it!”</p>\n<p>Cai Zongming’s jaw dropped, snapping out of his daze. He quickly followed suit, turning off his walkie-talkie. “Cheng, you have my respect today!” he said softly.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng approached Liang Yifan, pulling out a small, cute notebook. Nervously, he asked, “Mr. Liang, my friend and I admire you very much. Could you sign here for me?”</p>\n<p>Liang Yifan smiled warmly. “Of course, no worries at all. I see the team has worked hard tonight. Just come up in batches for your autographs.”</p>\n<p>Though he didn’t announce it loudly, the news spread quickly. All the students who had volunteered as security cheered quietly.</p>\n<p>Watching Liang Yifan sign three pages of his notebook, Lou Cheng felt overwhelmed. “Thank you, thank you!”</p>\n<p>Half an hour later, at the hotel entrance, the deputy head of the security department scolded Lou Cheng and Cai Zongming. “We’re lucky nothing happened this time. You can’t afford to take responsibility if anything goes wrong because of your reckless behavior! I might even report this to your department head. Whether you receive a disciplinary order depends on your acknowledgment and reflection on your actions.”</p>\n<p>“Sir! You’re absolutely right. We were too hot-headed and impulsive,” Cai Zongming quickly apologized, and Lou Cheng followed suit. They didn’t mind; they had already secured the autographs they wanted!</p>\n<p>If the matter returned to their school, they could negotiate and likely wiggle out of trouble, as covering for each other was a long-standing tradition.</p>\n<p>After bidding farewell to the deputy head, Lou Cheng sighed in relief. “He’s really something. A Professional Seventh Pin, and even after years in an office, his yelling still carries weight. I almost lost my focus.”</p>\n<p>“You were in a still stance just now?” Cai Zongming asked, intrigued.</p>\n<p>“Of course, it was too boring,” Lou Cheng replied matter-of-factly.</p>\n<p>As dawn approached, the crowd dispersed, leaving the hotel surroundings strangely peaceful. The autumn breeze rustled their clothes, and Cai Zongming and Lou Cheng fell into a contemplative silence.</p>\n<p>Noticing the hotel lobby lights and feeling the chilly autumn air, Lou Cheng broke the silence. “Talker, are you serious about joining the martial arts special training? Don’t you care about not having time for your girlfriend? Or for sleep or games?”</p>\n<p>Cai Zongming replied determinedly, “My girl excels in her studies. I’ll persuade her to take a second major. As for games, I’ll use that time to video call her. I plan to visit the Capital during Christmas and spend New Year’s Day with her, so I need to make some money now.”</p>\n<p>Coming from a decent family, he received twice the pocket money Lou Cheng did. Though he had at least 3,000 yuan a month, he was a spendthrift, never saving any by month’s end. With many helping him report attendance, he only skipped a few days of class.</p>\n<p>Before Lou Cheng could respond, Cai Zongming continued, “I’ve thought it through. After graduation, we’ll step into the real world. We won’t have the energy or time we do now. I’ve always loved martial arts. Even if I’m a bit lazy, I dream about it. Without ideals or dreams, how are we different from the walking dead? I don’t want to spend four years in college just attending classes, taking exams, and playing games.</p>\n<p>“I think I have some talent. Being an Amateur Fifth Pin gives me hope of entering the professional martial arts community. It’s worth a try. Who knows? Maybe I’ll get lucky, just like you chasing your goddess.”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng glared at him. “You can be all sentimental about your dreams, but why add those sarcastic lines?”</p>\n<p>“Used to it,” Cai Zongming smirked.</p>\n<p>They exchanged grins, then simultaneously declared, “Life is short; you live only once. Why not try?”</p>",
