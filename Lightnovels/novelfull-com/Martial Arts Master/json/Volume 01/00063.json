She was not only amazed at the competition’s changes, but also in pain of her own pocket money.</p><p>If Lou Cheng was struggling to survive Zhou Yuanning’s bombing attacks, supported by physical consumption to get the victory, she could reluctantly accept. But the reality was that after Zhou Yuanning’s most ferocious wave of attacks, Lou Cheng immediately counterattacked and beat the opponent. The physical advantage was part of the factor, but not the main factor!</p><p>This was so unbelievable that she couldn’t believe her eyes!</p><p>Beside her, Jiang Lan felt slightly lucky and laughed, “Luckily, I did not bet.”</p><p>Ye Youting glanced at her and said, “Sister Lan, do not mention the pot that doesn’t boil… how did he win?”</p><p>“I have told you, Zhou Yuanning’s problems and shortcomings are also obvious.” Jiang Lan smiled and said, “Haven’t combated for many years, the biggest impact is not only the decline of martial arts and physical state, but also the faded Qi in the chest. The first two can be maintained by the daily hardships, while the latter one can’t be polished with non-combat. It’s like a sharp sword, abandoned for a long time, does not get any conservation, sooner or later it will be blunt. In some situation that needs bravery, it becomes not confident enough.”</p><p>Ye Youting thoughtfully said, “No wonder the martial arts need combats, momentum and the Qi in the chest. In the arena of less life-threatening, losing his spirit, having little confidence in his own judgment, and being hesitant at the crucial moment, will lead to defeat to the weak. Not to mention the ancient battles which decided to live or not to live in seconds.”</p><p>“Yes. Zhou Yuanning at least had two opportunities to get down Lou Cheng, but he lost them due to over-cautious. Lou Cheng took the change. He attacked without hesitation. And he brought the battle to an end ahead, so he didn’t have to use the endurance.” Jiang Lan touched her hair.</p><p>Professional fighters were shocked by the result, not to mention the audience. A strange silence arose in the martial arts venues. Only the sound of naughty children playing the trumpet occasionally echoed. They played, and stopped, timidly watching around. They did not understand why adults suddenly stopped talking.</p><p>After twenty or thirty seconds, a variety of voices broke out, exclamations, praises, applause, cursing, and crying.</p><p>Zheng’s face flushed. He crazily clapped like he could not feel any pain. After a long time, he excitedly looked around the companions and said with a smile, “Lou Cheng is really great. He even beat a Professional Ninth Pin!”</p><p>Although he was a former Professional Ninth Pin, still a Professional Ninth Pin!</p><p>“I did not expect that, really…”</p><p>“I thought he would be the strongest under Professional Ninth Pin…”</p><p>“Zheng, you are awesome. You enjoyed the competition, and also got the bet to win the money!” The companions responded differently.</p><p>Zheng laughed, “Counting the basis, it’s only three hundred yuan. Shall we cut some marinated pork intestines, have a mix pig head meat, and buy a few bottles of wine and have some fun at my place?”</p><p>“Sure! Take advantages of you big rich!” A bet was immediately left behind.</p><p>…</p><p>“Lou Cheng won…” Qin Zhilin rubbed his eyes. He suspected that he just had an illusion. How could he see a Professional Ninth Pin knocked down by Lou Cheng?</p><p>Liu Yinglong stared. After a long time, he sighed and said, “It is only a few days, how do I feel like it’s several years? At the beginning, I still felt that carelessness caused my failure. But now, I am sure the gap between us won’t disappear in a short time… Oh, I doubt that he is a different guy…”</p><p>“He did it?” Qin Zhilin turned around and looked at senior brother.</p><p>Liu Yinglong looked to the arena, solemnly nodded, “Well, he won, he really won. He beat a Professional Ninth Pin.”</p><p>“…I can not believe that I witnessed the birth of a miracle…” Qin Zhilin murmured.</p><p>In other places, young couples and other audiences were still crying and abreacting. For many people, after witnessed the weak overcame the strong, they would naturally divide into two mentalities. One would be jealous and fearful, worrying about the inherent orders (ones that hated and reviled and wailed for the purse were based on other reasons). The second would compare their own with admiration. The strong were no doubt awe-inspiring, but the weak body could challenge the strong and get the victory, that was more worthy of admiration. One day, maybe you could do it yourself.</p><p>In their sight, Lou Cheng looked so-so on the arena, but he had the spirit of youth and heroism.</p><p>…</p><p>Seeing Zhou Yuanning stand up, Lou Cheng was in a little trance. Happiness echoed in his heart, resulting in a refreshing feeling, like going through the hardships in the ocean without any hope, tasting all the dangers, wandering between life and death, and finally witnessed the horizon. That touching moment, that moment of joy, no one could describe with words and sentences!</p><p>This is the best taste of the victory!</p><p>He really beat a Mighty One of Professional Ninth Pin!</p><p>Even if he was not in the best state, and even if he had multiple weaknesses, he was still a Professional Ninth Pin!</p><p>Because that he was a member in the forum, his heart was filled with the joy of winning, Lou Cheng said in a very graceful opening,</p><p>“I had almost lost twice.”</p><p>Yes. If Zhou Yuanning dared to fight more resolutely, more bravely, this time the one came to celebrate the victory would be Zhou Yuanning rather than him.</p><p>So this was a comprehensive contest of fortune, strength, judgment, spirit, and courage.</p><p>Zhou Yuanning shook his head, and responded earnestly, “Only once, that is, when I hit your back. If I had taken the risk to attack, perhaps the result would not be the same. As for the second time, I was rather greedy. When you stood up again, my Qi was close to the limit. I should immediately pull away from the distance. But with the regret of missing the previous opportunity, I became greedy, and made one more attack. That showed you my weakness, so you won. Huh, I should be more thoughtful.”</p><p>“No, I mean when you took my Iron Bridge Moves, you directly gave me a whip kick. You would be more likely to win,” Lou Cheng recalled that time, sincerely said.</p><p>Because he succeeded from a bad situation, his Dragon Turning Over Moves actually had a lot of flaws. But his courage beat Zhou Yuanning, so he chose a more secure way.</p><p>As for Zhou Yuanning, this was Challenge Tournament, not a Life or Death field.</p><p>With a little trance, Zhou Yuanning exposed a bitter smile, “Right…No wonder the old people often say ‘fists fear youth’. Except for physical invulnerability, they are also afraid of the physique and strength of young people, as well as their courage and bravery.”</p><p>After saying that, he did not have the mood to say something more or to take photos. He walked to the stone steps, quickly left the arena, his personal items were locked in the locker room, no need to get back from the competition supervision.</p><p>Standing in the arena above, looking at the back of Zhou Yuanning disappearing at the end of the lights, Lou Cheng felt that he had become the king of this bluestone site. He was the only king, accepting the worship, enjoying the authority.</p><p>…</p><p>“Lord Lu…” Jin Tao waited for a long time outside the locker room until Zhou Yuanning came out. After a shout, he did not know what to say. The words of comfort at this time were more like opening a scar and poking the wound.</p><p>Zhou Yuanning’s hair was dripping water. He bitterly smiled, “Do not say anything. Accompany me for three or five bottles.”</p><p>“Sure!” Jin Tao replied immediately.</p><p>After thinking for a while, Zhou Yuanning said, “I won’t come to the forum until a week later. Too shameful… Half, naked, photos… Can you help me to send them?”</p><p>He had set up the rhetoric but was defeated by the unknown, so he got embarrassed and decided to post new topics after things had faded away.</p><p>…</p><p>Lou Cheng got back his phone from the competition supervision office, and then he went to the locker room. Ecstasy rolled in his heart. He could not wait to share it with Yan Zheke.</p><p>Honestly, if Zhou Yuanning didn’t go that fast, he would like to blow his identity in the forum. Meet forum friends in person!</p><p>Logged in QQ and was going to send a message, he saw the collected voice before. Clear and passionate songs echoed around his ears, a bit fascinating.</p><p>Subconsciously, he slid his finger. He called out the address book and made a phone call to Yan Zheke.</p><p>At this moment, he would like to hear the voice of Yan Zheke once again. He would like to tell her his victory personally!</p><p>Mobile phone ringing came into his ears. Lou Cheng was a little nervous and a little apprehension, but more was happy and expecting.</p><p>“Hello, Cheng?” The line got connected. Yan Zheke’s familiar voice came through the phone.</p><p>Lou Cheng blurted out, “I won!”</p><p>The other side of the phone came into a short moment of silence. The breath seemed to be heavier. “Really? Cheng, don’t trick me.”</p><p>With more surprises in her voice, Yan Zheke had already believed his words.</p><p>“Listen to the cry around.” Lou Cheng turned the phone into hands-free in the locker room, and put it towards the stands. The cry of “Lou Cheng” was endless.</p><p>“I, I feel like I’m in the dream. Frankly, don’t be angry, I had no confidence… ” Yan Zheke said.</p><p>Lou Cheng turned off hands-free. And he walked into the locker room, sitting on a metal bench, smiling, “I did not have any confidence either, but didn’t I have your refueling song? It was more powerful than ordinary ones. It at least helped me double my strength!”</p><p>Yan Zheke made a low laughter that was hard to suppress. After a while, Yan Zheke said, “You are so funny… ”</p><p>Finished. The two appeared silent, breath across the handset and radio was vaguely heard.</p><p>“It feels that I can’t talk without emoji pack.” Lou Cheng made a joke.</p><p>Yan Zheke smiled, “That is, the talk has become unfamiliar. Quickly, honestly account, how do you beat Professional Ninth Pin?”</p><p>She deliberately used the tone of online chat to resolve the embarrassment of their first phone call.</p><p>“I almost failed twice… ” Lou Cheng described the keys of the competition again. In the middle, he focused on the interaction with Yan Zheke, rather than finishing their talk in a breath. When he talked about his winning, the chat became smooth and familiar again.</p><p>“Hey, thanks to Coach Yan for telling me the Qi of Wuthering Eight Movements, or else I could not catch the opportunity.” He took the opportunity to commend Yan Zheke.</p><p>Yan Zheke smiled, “I make a living on my head!”</p><p>“And on a cheerful song,” Lou Cheng said humorously.</p><p>Yan Zheke snorted. “I was just in a whim.”</p><p>Then, she quickly changed the topic. “Cheng, I found that you will be considered as the second expert of the martial arts community at the beginning of the new term!” How long is it? I always feel you are possessed by an alien.”</p><p>Her voice tone ended with laughter, teasing Lou Cheng’s ears. The joy in Lou Cheng’s heart gradually became long and increasingly meaningful. He smiled, “I think your Yin-Yang Stance and some 24 Blizzard Strikes are good enough. But you have no actual combat experience. And when you have it, you will have the strength of Amateur Third Pin. How about this? In the new term, I accompany you to combat, and let Coach Shi be the referee.”</p><p>He instinctively wanted to have more contacts and common experiences with Yan Zheke.</p><p>“Well, you shall be a good sandbag!” Yan Zheke said with a ferocious tone.</p><p>…</p><p>When the two talked happily, Wang Ye finished the competition. He walked into the locker room, and he saw Lou Cheng making a call. He gave him a thumbs-up.</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled in response while introducing the sixteen lottery rules to Yan Zheke, “… That is to say, the first of each group picks the second to avoid the same group.”</p><p>“Tomorrow your opponent will be Professional Ninth Pin or Mighty Ones of Danqi Realm…Cheng, I can only say that enjoy the fighting and enjoy the martial arts,” Yan Zheke said in a joking tone.</p><p>The Professional Ninth Pin in her words is the best ones, not the ones like Zhou Yuanning.</p><p>Lou Cheng replied with a smile. “I think so. Tomorrow I’ll just enjoy the competition and enjoy the fighting. And sooner I will be able to get the bonus. Hey, I can carry luggage to find delicious food in Yanling.”</p><p>I can also find a better hotel to stay!</p><p>Between the words, he thought of the big backpack in the cupboard. According to the original plan, he should go to the station and return to Xiushan. Who would actually predict that he could reach the last sixteen! At the beginning, even he dare not do such a fantasy. That was too outrageous. However, if this best sixteen from Warrior Sage Challenge Tournament do not seize the time to set the hotel, it is possible that he will sleep on the street…</p><p>“Yanling’s special food? Let me see.” Yan Zheke said excitedly, “… there seems to be a mutton soup with bing which is quite famous …”</p><p>“Then I’ll try it!” Lou Cheng said with pleasure.</p><p>They had talked for over forty minutes. Lou Cheng’s mobile phone got hot, and the power went straight down. If Yan Zheke’s grandmother didn’t look for her, Lou Cheng felt that they could go on.</p><p>In the later QQ chat, he booked the hotel, which was four or five hundred yuan a night. Quite expensive, but he had a bonus and he was young. He would like a luxury.</p><p>This time, he booked for two nights. He did not want to be in a hurry. And the return ticket was not able to get due to the arrival of the Spring Festival. He had to wait for the next round.</p><p>When tomorrow’s battle was finished, he should call to cheer to master. And he should go to Little Ming to show off. After returning home, he would have courage and self-confidence to say about learning martial arts. At least his performance showed that he was able to make a living of this… Lou Cheng thought.</p><p>At almost five o’clock when the sixteen against table was sure, Lou Cheng saw his own name and that familiar and unfamiliar enemy:</p><p>“Ye Youting-Lou Cheng!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
