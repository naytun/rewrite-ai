Automatic news updates, local weather forecasts, replies from childhood friends, and countless messages from various QQ groups filled his screen.</p>\n<p>But he ignored them all. His heart raced when he saw that Yan Zheke had accepted his friend request.</p>\n<p>He clicked on the dialogue box, suddenly unsure how to address her.</p>\n<p>“It would be rude to call her Yan Zheke directly. But calling her ‘Zheke,’ ‘Xiaoke,’ or ‘Keke’ feels too casual. That would be embarrassing. Yet, referring to her as ‘classmate’ or ‘classmate Yan Zheke’ seems distant and awkward.</p>\n<p>Should I say ‘old classmate’? No, a freshman might find that too formal!”</p>\n<p>After weighing his options and hesitating, Lou Cheng decided against using any title. Instead, he opted for an emoji.</p>\n<p>He sent a grinning emoji and typed quickly, “Sorry to bother you, but I had to leave orientation early today. Did they cover anything important afterward?”</p>\n<p>Once he hit send, his heart raced with a mix of eagerness and anxiety. Time stretched endlessly until he noticed a “tick” sound. Yan Zheke’s profile picture lit up, changing from dark to bright, from “invisible” to “online.” He hadn’t realized her avatar was a cartoon cat with light gray fur and large eyes.</p>\n<p>“Fortunately, you have an enthusiastic and kind-hearted classmate like me,” Yan Zheke replied, sending an emoji of an adorable little monster. “They introduced the martial arts class schedule after that. It’s every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday from nine to noon. The content is the same for all three classes, so you can attend just one. But if you’re free, it’s best to go to all of them. After all, practice makes perfect! ^_^”</p>\n<p>The Martial Arts Club welcomed all students, from freshmen to seniors, across various colleges. Since everyone had different schedules, they repeated classes three times a week, with one class on weekends to accommodate all members.</p>\n<p>Seeing Yan Zheke’s reply, Lou Cheng smiled, his previous worries melting away into joy and excitement.</p>\n<p>He quickly typed to ask which class she would attend. But after a moment’s thought, he hesitated. He didn’t want to come off as too forward when they were still getting to know each other.</p>\n<p>His feelings for Yan Zheke made him deliberate over every word and emoji.</p>\n<p>Finally, he casually remarked, “I have calculus and linear algebra on Thursday morning, so I can only go on Tuesday or Saturday.”</p>\n<p>Yan Zheke sent a laughing emoji. “I can go all three times.”</p>\n<p>“What a coincidence! You don’t have class on Tuesday or Thursday morning?” Lou Cheng clenched his fist, admiring his cleverness. By mentioning his schedule, he hoped she would share hers.</p>\n<p>Yan Zheke sent an embarrassed emoji, her face flushed. “An upperclassman from the Martial Arts Club told me in advance, so I made sure to keep Tuesday and Thursday mornings open during course selection.”</p>\n<p>Songcheng University allowed students to choose their courses freely. Each course had various options for teachers and schedules. Students could select their preferred teachers and times based on their own timetables and the teachers' overall ratings. However, popular classes filled up quickly, so students had to act fast.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng thought of Qin Mo, a wealthy student in his dorm, who had crammed all his classes into Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, claiming he would study for three days and rest for four.</p>\n<p>Just as Lou Cheng was about to reply, Yan Zheke sent another message. “By the way, there’s going to be a new teacher this semester. Apparently, the principal isn’t happy with the club’s recent performance. He wants to revitalize the Songcheng University Martial Arts Club’s reputation with Lin Que’s enrollment. We’ve even made it to the national finals before!”</p>\n<p>“That’s amazing! I’ve never heard of that,” Lou Cheng replied, a bit skeptical.</p>\n<p>“That was many years ago; I’d be surprised if you knew!” Yan Zheke sent a “Doge” emoji.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng quickly asked, “So how do you know about it?”</p>\n<p>“That’s a secret!” Yan Zheke replied, sending an emoji with a self-satisfied expression. Lou Cheng could almost picture her charming smile, making him grin widely.</p>\n<p>“Ugh, I can’t stand secrets! I’m dying to know! Do you want me to stay awake all night?” He sent a pathetic emoji, impressed with his own ability to seize the moment. “Perhaps this is a male instinct?”</p>\n<p>“If you can’t sleep, read a book!” Yan Zheke sent a snickering emoji.</p>\n<p>“I was studying hard earlier, and I’m wasting away with every passing day…” After a moment’s thought, Lou Cheng decided to change the subject. “What kind of person is this new coach?”</p>\n<p>“He hasn’t arrived yet,” Yan Zheke replied. “But I’ve heard he’s quite experienced. The principal used his connections to bring him here. He’s not an ordinary person, and if we follow his teachings, we’re bound to see results. Even someone like you, who doesn’t know the basics, might earn an Amateur Top Three Rank certification before graduation.”</p>\n<p>Amateur Top Three Rank… Lou Cheng thought of the Jindan inside him, then focused back on Yan Zheke. “What about you? What are your expectations?”</p>\n<p>“Me? Hmm, I don’t expect to obtain a professional rank or anything. If I can practice more special moves for self-defense, that’s enough.” Lou Cheng sensed a hint of loneliness in her words.</p>\n<p>He wondered, “Could this be a misunderstanding on her part?”</p>\n<p>“Why? Where there’s a will, there’s a way!” Lou Cheng said, trying to sound convincing.</p>\n<p>“It’s a secret,” Yan Zheke replied curtly.</p>\n<p>There must be reasons behind her words, but it was clear she didn’t want to discuss it. Lou Cheng’s mind raced, analyzing every detail. He realized he had never been as dedicated, even during his senior year of high school.</p>\n<p>He made a mental note and shifted the topic. “By the way, I heard the Martial Arts Gym at Xiushan No. 1 Middle School is almost finished! We probably missed it since they started construction after we enrolled, and it wasn’t completed until our graduation!”</p>\n<p>“Really? I hadn’t noticed. Even if it had been finished while we were in high school, we probably wouldn’t have used it much. Martial Arts Competitions are risky, and without high-level judges, the No. 2 Hospital would have been packed. How could we keep studying? I can only imagine Director Li’s expression from the Educational Administration,” Yan Zheke replied.</p>\n<p>After Lou Cheng mentioned their shared alma mater, Yan Zheke became more engaged in the conversation.</p>\n<p>“Director Li? He was our math teacher and quite interesting. Wasn’t he your math teacher too?” Lou Cheng seized the opportunity to keep the conversation flowing.</p>\n<p>Yan Zheke sent a nodding emoji. “Yes, old Li was a funny guy. He would chat with us for at least ten minutes before class every day. Every time he praised us, it was so embarrassing. One time, I wanted to go home to watch the ultimate match-up between the Dragon King and the Warrior Sage, so I planned to finish my homework during math class. I thought I could hide it, but when class ended, some classmates were talking, and old Li scolded them. He said, ‘If you can get full marks in math like Yan Zheke, I won’t say a word as long as you don’t bother others. You can do whatever you like; you can even give birth for all I care. Look, Yan Zheke has been doing her Chinese homework, and have I said anything?’ I was so embarrassed. My image as a good student was ruined.”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, old Li was hilarious. There was one time he was so confident explaining a question, but halfway through class, he still hadn’t gotten it right and started sweating. After a while, he mumbled that he had copied the wrong question…” Lou Cheng sent a laughing emoji and asked, “So, about the match-up between the Dragon King and the Warrior Sage, which side do you support?”</p>\n<p>“Dragon King, of course!” Yan Zheke replied without hesitation.</p>\n<p>“Me too!” Lou Cheng exclaimed, delighted. “It’s a shame, though. Longhu Club doesn’t quite match up to Shangqing Sect in reputation. They’re a bit inferior overall.”</p>\n<p>“That’s true, but I just like the Dragon King!” Yan Zheke sent an emoji with hearts in her eyes.</p>\n<p>They exchanged stories, excitement bubbling between them. From tales of the Dragon King to gossip about high school romances, they reminisced about the year of an attempted rape case and how boys would escort girls home who didn’t live on campus.</p>\n<p>Thinking of their shared interests, Lou Cheng couldn’t wipe the smile off his face. He felt grateful for how perfect the night had been.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, someone slapped his shoulder. Startled, he turned to see Cai Zongming, hands in his pockets, grinning widely. “Well done, Cheng! You’ve learned without a teacher!”</p>\n<p>“Learned what? What are you talking about?” Lou Cheng replied, confused.</p>\n<p>Cai Zongming tsked. “Go look in the mirror. Your lovey-dovey feelings are written all over your face. Are you talking to your Goddess?”</p>\n<p>“Umm.” Lou Cheng’s face flushed as he reluctantly admitted it.</p>\n<p>Cai Zongming checked the time on his phone. “Alright, Cheng, enough chatting for now. You need to stop before it gets boring. This way, you’ll leave a good impression and make her look forward to talking to you.”</p>\n<p>“You’re truly a professional…” Lou Cheng grumbled, picking up his phone. Knowing it was the right thing to do, he reluctantly sent a smiling emoji. “I still have homework for the martial arts lesson tomorrow morning. Talk to you later!”</p>\n<p>Yan Zheke replied with a smiling emoji, “See you at the martial arts lesson tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>After closing the conversation, Lou Cheng skimmed through other messages, replied to a few important ones, and exited QQ. He looked at Cai Zongming. “Casanova, are you going to the martial arts lesson tomorrow morning?”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng felt a twinge of melancholy at the abrupt end of his cheerful conversation with Yan Zheke.</p>\n<p>“Of course! I’ll show off my hidden martial arts skills!” Cai Zongming replied. Their class schedules matched, so there was no hesitation.</p>\n<p>“Pssh, you better watch out or you’ll get knocked out,” Lou Cheng teased. They both chuckled as they headed back to the dorm.</p>\n<p>After washing up, everyone lay on their beds. Zhao Qiang, Qiu Zhigao, and Zhang Jingye were still discussing the social meetup on Friday, imagining the looks and personalities of the four girls. Meanwhile, Lou Cheng took out his phone, silently rereading every word of his conversation with Yan Zheke. His heart soared with joy, yet he remained calm, responding to the three chatty friends with occasional grunts and nods.</p>\n<p>As the lights went out, the night deepened, and the dorm fell silent. Lou Cheng drifted into a slumber, caught in a bizarre dream filled with both excitement and dread.</p>",
