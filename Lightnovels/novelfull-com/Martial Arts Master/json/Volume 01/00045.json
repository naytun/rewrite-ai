When he first arrived in Yanling, he longed for the local cuisine but had no money to spare. To make sure he wouldn’t be starving on the way home, every penny in his pocket must be spent carefully so he frequented those street vendors for simple, cheap meals.</p><p>Putting down his chopsticks, he found himself gazing fascinatedly at the roasted ducks just across the street. He murmured, “When Heaven is about to place great responsibility on a capable man, it always first frustrates his spirit and will, exhausts his muscles and bones, exposes him to starvation and poverty, exposes him to starvation and poverty, starvation…”</p><p>A mockery of himself. He took out his mobile and resumed his chat with Yan Zheke who was resting after lunch until her training time. Lou Cheng slowly paced back to the stadium.</p><p>The entire afternoon Lou Cheng went about from one ring to another, watching one match after another, observing and absorbing the essence of their moves and styles like a sponge soaking up water and devising responses and counterattacks as if he was inside the ring.</p><p>Back to high school years, knowing studying was his only way out, he was never this active, responsive or devoted, restraining himself from browsing forums, checking Tweeter and watching fighting videos.</p><p>When that afternoon’s matches were all finished, he dropped his jacket back to the hotel room before heading to the nearby park to digest today’s observations and temper his moves.</p><p>The palest ink is better than the best memory!</p><p>Punches were thrown like cannon fire. Lou Cheng’s every move tore the air, howling and whizzing rhythmically, ferocious and crazy like a Brutal Blizzard approaching. As his practice went on, his strikes became more terrifying, roaring and thundering like a violent rush of water rolling down to devour all.</p><p>Daylight was ebbing away when a light snow started to fall like a shower of cotton. Flakes of snow danced in the air responding to Lou Cheng’s moves. All the whiz and roars suddenly came to a dead silence which was soon followed by a deafening slap from his right hand with half of his full strength.</p><p>As soon as his right hand settled, his left palm reached out. His two palms took turns in attacking with no break in between, forming a soft yet dense web of strikes with random low kicks.</p><p>If Mega Avalanche were the most masculine and the most ferocious violence and craziness of 24 Blizzard Strikes, this palm set would be the most feminine and most deadly. Beginning with a sudden silent invasion, the chill advanced too fast for anyone to escape or resolve until the target was hit.</p><p>The second group of 24 Blizzard Strikes, Biting Chill!</p><p>Lou Cheng stopped after a few rounds of practice and let out a turbid breath in the shape of an arrow formed by white smoke. “This set lives up to its reputation as a derivation from the Ice Sect’s lost knowledge! Every practice grants me new gains.”</p><p>Lou Cheng took his mobile out immediately to share his joy with Yan Zheke, unable to wait until back to the hotel.</p><p>“I had this same feeling this afternoon during my training. This is probably the charm of martial arts.” Yan Zheke added a shy smile. “Woo… My cousin asked me to go shopping together. I’m so tired (how pitiful).”</p><p>Lou Cheng sounded concerned. “Don’t go if you are too tired. Just say no to her.”</p><p>He joked along. “If you dare not say no to her, I’m happy to help!”</p><p>“No. She promised she would treat me to a nice meal. I’m very tempted.” Yan Zheke sent a smile behind sleeves. “When it comes to shopping, my cousins are all monsters like you. They don’t feel tired at all after three or even four hours!”</p><p>Lou Cheng thought about it and then sent a sticker of a man down on the ground. “I think I will lose.”</p><p>My body is not tired, but my mind is!</p><p>The two chatted and laughed over dinner. Lou Cheng returned to the hotel and took off his clothes in the shower. Hot water ran down his body and cleared dust away from every inch of his skin and wiped fatigue off his mind.</p><p>He grinned and squinted comfortably, in a dream of a steaming mist.</p><p>The past three days were like a dream, but his growth was so real that he felt undergoing a transmutation and maybe brewing a pot of maturity.</p><p>As soon as he dried his body after shower, he quickly washed his clothes. He didn’t bring enough clothes and the laundry service in such a shabby hotel didn’t seem trustworthy. He had been in the same martial arts suit for three days. It was the perfect timing to change into the other one as he would be heading home in his regular clothes in three or four days even if this suit couldn’t dry in time.</p><p>After all this, Lou Cheng turned on his laptop to download the video before putting himself in bed, soft and comfy, feeling the beauty of life.</p><p>He logged on his QQ on his mobile, intending to chat with Yan Zheke who must be busy with shopping. A familiar avatar sent him a message.</p><p>Dee!</p><p>“Fatty Jiang?” Lou Cheng muttered.</p><p>It was Jiang Fei, a good friend of his from high school, currently studying in Guangnan.</p><p>Fatty Jiang said, “Cheng, when will you come back? We classmates are planning a get-together.”</p><p>“In four or five days.” Lou Cheng answered vaguely. “Who will be there?”</p><p>Jiang Fei replied, “Not sure yet but quite some. Your school holiday starts so late?”</p><p>“I got delayed.” Lou Cheng didn’t mention the Warrior Sage Challenge Tournament as Fatty Jiang would be stunned by his new identity as a martial arts master. He continued, “Any teachers?”</p><p>Jiang Fei replied, “Don’t know. We’ll see. It depends on what we will be doing. If we are going Karaoke, it’s better to have no teachers around. But if we are going for some farm stay, we can invite them to play cards and go fishing.”</p><p>“Count me in. Haven’t seen you for an entire term.” Lou Cheng sounded happy.</p><p>Lou Cheng sent an evil smile. “By the way, Cheng, I’ve got some gossip for you.”</p><p>“What gossip?” Lou Cheng became interested.</p><p>Jiang Fei replied, “He-heh… On my way home, I saw Du Liyu on the train, holding hands with Song Li from Class Three!”</p><p>“Class Three? Yan Zheke’s class?” Lou Cheng became wide awake. “They went to the same university?”</p><p>“Almost. Two universities in the same city. Somehow they’ve hooked up. He-heh… Just as the say goes, I treat you as a fellow-townsman, but you are up to no good.” Jiang Fei was a fast typist.</p><p>A shot right in his knee… Lou Cheng wiped his forehead as if there was cold sweat. “Fatty Jiang, then what happened?”</p><p>“Then? I saw them and they saw me. They instantly let go each other’s hands and begged me not to share what I saw with others. Considering our relationship, of course, I can tell you.” Lou Cheng sent a smiley.</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed in front of the phone and typed, “You were such a huge third wheel… Hey, so many gorgeous girls in Guangnan. No love story to tell yet?”</p><p>“Pooh! Yeah, many beauties but not in our faculty. We’ve got only five of them. Five golden flowers.” Jiang Fei sent a distraught face. “By the way, don’t spread the gossip or they will scold me.”</p><p>While chatting with Jiang Fei, Lou Cheng had already shared the news with Yan Zheke.</p><p>“Some gossip for you! Du Liyu from our class is in a relationship with Song Li from your class!”</p><p>Jiang Fei’s remind came in after, making Lou Cheng’s lips twitch.</p><p>For me, Yan Zheke is not one of the others!</p><p>A few minutes later, Yan Zheke sent a stunned dog sticker, “What? Song Li is in love? She didn’t tell me anything before! I have to go and talk with her!”</p><p>“Don’t mention my name.” enjoined Lou Cheng.</p><p>Secrets are spread by people like Jiang Fei and I… I need to confess…</p><p>On the other side, Jiang Fei added, “Cheng, Old Cheng is asking me out for some drinks and BBQ. Talk next time.”</p><p>Cheng Qili was another good friend of Lou Cheng’s from high school. Their friendship deepened on their way home from school every day.</p><p>“Go ahead. Give him a punch for me. He never speaks unless he’s spoken to. Never message me first!” Lou Cheng made a joke.</p><p>The dull and bitter high school life seemed joyful and beautiful when looking back after a few months of university. Those were the most precious and purest years of youth.</p><p>Yan Zheke questioned Song Li during her shopping, and it took her some good effort until she sent Lou Cheng a proud face. “You were right about them! They’ve been together for over two months! If you meet Du Liyu, tease him for me. He took the sweet girl sitting behind me without a word!”</p><p>“My class will have a get-together before the new year.” Lou Cheng sent a “Rest assured” sticker.</p><p>“We also have but I can’t make it…” Yan Zheke replied an emoji with untidy hair in the wind.</p><p>Their conversation continued casually, warm and pleasant. Lou Cheng also browsed his friends’ updates on Shuoshuo.</p><p>He suddenly noticed Zhao Qiang, the head of his dorm room, changed his QQ name to Erudite and updated his status to Jiang-style Thoughts.</p><p>“Err…” Lou Cheng was lost but pretended he didn’t see anything.</p><p>He checked the time on his mobile and then got back to his chat with Yan Zheke. While waiting for her reply, he opened the official website of Phoenix Cup Warrior Sage Candidate Challenge Tournament to read the latest match reports and the follow-up schedule.</p><p>He saw himself in the match highlights and struggled out of bed to download it. There were 103 fighters left for Round Four, so 51 matches would take place simultaneously in five rings next morning while one luckiest man would automatically advance to the next stage. In the afternoon 40 fighters would fight in Knockout Round Five while 12 lucky ones would get a direct pass to the next stage.</p><p>“Two matches in one day… Even if I don’t have the luck to get one direct pass, my advantage in physical strength will be amplified to the max. Getting in the group competition shouldn’t be a problem unless I’m facing a Professional Ninth Pin fighter. The only challenge left is the fourth round.” Lou Cheng pondered his chances.</p><p>This is not a game. The consumption of physical strength will reduce one’s power, lower his speed, and affect his general performance.</p><p>…</p><p>The next day, Lou Cheng got up at 5:30 as usual and started his daily practice in the nearby park.</p><p>He returned to the hotel at 7:20. He took a shower and got himself ready before greeting Yan Zheke on his mobile.</p><p>“Morning!”</p><p>Almost at the same time, Lou Cheng received a message from her.</p><p>“Morning!”</p><p>Tacit understanding made Lou Cheng smile. His day had a perfect start.</p><p>…</p><p>Old Zheng and other spectators started to enter the stadium. He walked to the big screen to check today’s match table.</p><p>Subconsciously he was looking for Lou Cheng’s number and name. With only 51 matches scheduled, it didn’t take him long to locate the information.</p><p>“Him? This opponent is no easy target. The service desk recommended his match on the very first day.” Lou drew a long, deep breath.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
