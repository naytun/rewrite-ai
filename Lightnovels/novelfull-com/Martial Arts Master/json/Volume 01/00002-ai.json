  "body": "<p>Lou Cheng approached the gym, the front entrance looming closer. He climbed the nine steps, his heart racing and his face flushed. It was hard to tell if the heat came from his run or the anxiety of what lay ahead.</p>\n<p>He rehearsed various scenarios in his mind, panting as he clenched his fists to bolster his courage.</p>\n<p>“What’s there to fear? Man up!” he muttered to himself.</p>\n<p>As different thoughts swirled in his head, he slowed his pace, stealing glances at the elegant Yan Zheke, who wore a striking red and white Han costume. He tried to convince himself she was just another passerby. Just before he brushed past her, he halted, surprised. “You… Did you study at Xiushan No.1 Middle School?”</p>\n<p>Yan Zheke stood there, momentarily stunned, as if she hadn’t heard him. Then she shook off her surprise, a frown fading from her face. “Yeah. You are?”</p>\n<p>His heart raced, but he managed a smile despite his heavy breathing. “I was in class four. Every morning, I stood right next to you during martial arts gymnastics. Well, a few rows behind you… He-heh. I didn’t know you were also here at Songcheng University.”</p>\n<p>A flicker of recognition crossed Yan Zheke’s face. Though she couldn’t recall him, she relaxed, her smile revealing two charming dimples. “I thought I was the only one from our high school here.”</p>\n<p>Remembering Cai Zongming’s advice, Lou Cheng fought the urge to scratch his head. “I kept a low profile, so I wasn’t familiar with students from other classes.”</p>\n<p>Her smile brightened, making her even more attractive. Lou Cheng found it hard to look away.</p>\n<p>“What’s your name? Maybe I’ve heard of you. Cheng Tao and his friends were in our class,” she asked, her voice soft and inviting, devoid of shyness.</p>\n<p>“Cheng Tao? He borrowed my homework every day. I’m Lou Cheng, just a nobody. I bet you don’t know me,” he joked, then added impulsively, “But I know you, Miss Yan Zheke, one of the most popular girls in our grade… Actually, in the whole school. A girl as smart and friendly as you should be in the capital or Huahai for university. Who would have guessed you were here in Songcheng?”</p>\n<p>Yan Zheke chuckled at his straightforward compliment, turning her head slightly. “If I had come here because of a disappointing college entrance exam result, you would have offended me.”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng felt a wave of panic wash over him. “What was I thinking? Thank goodness Yan Zheke didn’t fail the exam…” He had almost called her “beautiful” but thought better of it for their first conversation.</p>\n<p>“No wonder Casanova warned me not to talk too much… He knows this kind of stuff.” Remembering Cai Zongming’s words, Lou Cheng quickly added, “It would be news if a celebrity like you failed the exam. Err… The crowd is coming. I’d better get going. I’ll leave you to your work.”</p>\n<p>“Got it,” Yan Zheke replied.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng took a deep breath, trying to sound casual. “What’s your QQ number, by the way? A few more students from our school are here too. We could have a get-together.”</p>\n<p>He held his breath, his heart pounding. The last sentence was just a cover for his real desire to get her QQ number.</p>\n<p>Yan Zheke smiled and pointed to a red string around her neck. “Can’t keep my mobile in this suit. Take my QQ number, and I’ll add you soon. Just mention ‘Lou Cheng from class four, No. 1 Middle School.’ I don’t accept requests from strangers. My QQ is XXXXXX.”</p>\n<p>“Got it,” Lou Cheng exclaimed, barely able to contain his excitement. He repeated the number to himself and fished his mobile from his jeans pocket. As he logged into QQ and searched for the number, he burst into laughter. “Dantai Cuihua?”</p>\n<p>What a ridiculous name! The online Yan Zheke seemed nothing like her real self.</p>\n<p>Yan Zheke squinted at him, a playful smile on her lips. “Yeah, don’t you find the name super approachable? Don’t you know its origin?”</p>\n<p>“It ruined all those fancy, elegant compound surnames,” Lou Cheng guessed, though he wasn’t entirely sure.</p>\n<p>Murong, Huangfu, Shangguan, Zhuge, Dantai… Those unique compound surnames paired with beautiful given names would fit perfectly in romantic novels or dramas. But when combined with a clumsy or patriotic addition, they became comical, like Murong Jianjun or Huangfu Sufen.</p>\n<p>Joy sparkled in Yan Zheke’s eyes. “Yeah, isn’t it interesting?”</p>\n<p>“Very. Should I change my QQ name to Zhuge Ergou?” Lou Cheng laughed, enjoying their conversation so much that he wished it could last forever. But then a sudden cough interrupted them as Cai Zongming approached.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng struggled to maintain his composure and waved at Yan Zheke. “My friend is here. We have to go inside. See you.”</p>\n<p>“Bye,” Yan Zheke waved back, drawing the attention of others around them.</p>\n<p>Turning to join Cai Zongming, Lou Cheng couldn’t hide his joy.</p>\n<p>“Not bad! I thought you’d stammer. You’ve got potential,” Cai Zongming said as they entered the gym, the noise and bustle enveloping them.</p>\n<p>The martial arts gymnasium was divided into two sections. One was a ring the size of a basketball court, surrounded by stands, while the other was a vast space filled with sports equipment for daily martial training. The latter was set up for the orientation, buzzing with more activity than Lou Cheng had anticipated.</p>\n<p>“Seriously,” Lou Cheng chuckled, “The Martial Arts Club really is a big family.”</p>\n<p>“Of course. The Martial Arts Competition is the world’s most popular event, and martial arts masters are the biggest stars. The Martial Arts Club is the largest in every university,” Cai Zongming replied.</p>\n<p>Being the “best” writer is as meaningless as being the “second best” fighter. After decades of peace, martial tournaments were on the rise, and the thrill of these limit-defining competitions stirred the audience’s adrenaline and rekindled their heroism. Night prowlers seemed to be a thing of the past, and cowardice was a fading memory. As this trend continued, media and entertainment quickly caught up, leading to official martial arts competitions.</p>\n<p>Martial arts competitions could be classified into two categories: one derived from traditional conflicts among martial factions, where various sects, schools, and clubs competed for the honor of being the greatest heir of Chinese martial arts; the other was individual competitions for the championship.</p>\n<p>The former had become a national craze known as the Professional Martial Arts Competition, consisting of four leagues, with the premier league featuring 12 teams representing the highest martial arts level in China. For those 12 teams, the worst humiliation was to finish last in their league, resulting in demotion.</p>\n<p>The latter included five national individual challenge tournaments, also known as Title Competitions. The champion of each tournament earned a title, recognized as one of the most capable martial artists in the country. For instance, winning the Warrior Sage Event granted the title of Warrior Sage for the following year. Thus, the saying went, “A title tops the Professional First Pin!”</p>\n<p>Such tournaments brought significant commercial returns for leading forces and martial arts masters. Wealth accompanied honor, popularity, and influence. Even universities felt the impact, leading to the National University Martial Arts Competitions and the flourishing of university martial arts clubs.</p>\n<p>Cai Zongming straightened his back, exuding the demeanor of a hidden martial arts master. “Did you get her QQ number?”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng couldn’t hide his excitement. “Of course! Casanova, what should I do next?”</p>\n<p>“What do you think? Find topics to chat about, get closer to her, learn her hobbies, and wait for a chance to ask her out. Finding topics shouldn’t be hard, right?” Cai Zongming glanced at Lou Cheng with mock disdain. “Or just give me her QQ number, and I’ll do it for you!”</p>\n<p>“No way,” Lou Cheng replied firmly. “I’m lucky to get advice from the experienced.”</p>\n<p>“Sure you are. I’ve dated lots of girls,” Cai Zongming said, sounding quite proud.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng, who had been playing the underdog, suddenly questioned him. “How old are you again?”</p>\n<p>“Eighteen. So? Can’t I have many girlfriends? I met my first love in Grade Three!” Cai Zongming bristled at the doubt.</p>\n<p>“No. I mean… You’ve had so many girlfriends, but none of your relationships lasted. It must be your fault…” Lou Cheng’s eyes darted around, realizing something.</p>\n<p>Cai Zongming’s expression stiffened. “Do you want to continue this conversation or not?”</p>\n<p>He then casually explained, “I’ve dated my pen friends. You know, easy come, easy go. A lack of contact for a short time was enough to kill the passion. Some of my dates transferred to another school. What could I do? And some just weren’t right… You know the saying, ‘It’s easy to fall in love but hard to stay together.’ In short, I’m not a playboy, and I’ve been behaving for a long time. Don’t call me a playboy or Casanova in front of my girlfriend! Actually, can’t you give me a better nickname? Casanova is terrible. Stop calling me that, okay?”</p>\n<p>“You got it, little Ming,” Lou Cheng grinned.</p>\n<p>Cai Zongming seemed to freeze, then sighed. “Casanova is fine.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, little Ming.” Lou Cheng felt triumphant and instantly brightened.</p>\n<p>There was always one thing to conquer another. Cai Zongming valued his long-distance girlfriend as much as Lou Cheng did Yan Zheke.</p>\n<p>Cai Zongming burst into laughter. “Cheng, if we signed up for the Crosstalk Club instead of the martial arts one, we would be famous for sure.”</p>\n<p>Just then, a sudden commotion erupted outside the door.</p>\n<p>“Lin Que is coming!”</p>\n<p>“Lin Que!”</p>\n<p>The crowd surged toward the entrance.</p>\n<p>Lou and Cai exchanged excited glances, their curiosity piqued. They joined the throng heading toward the entrance.</p>\n<p>Rumors had been swirling about a genius who achieved the Professional Ninth Pin certificate at just 18. Lin Que had outperformed most disciples of martial sects and students of martial arts schools.</p>\n<p>A talent like him had chosen to enter a university instead of a martial sect, school, or club!</p>\n<p>Among the freshmen in the university circle, Lin Que wasn’t the only one to earn the Professional Ninth Pin. But for Song Cheng University, it was the first time they welcomed such a genius.</p>\n<p>That genius was Lin Que!</p>",
