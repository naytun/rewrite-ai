Phoenix Cup? Challenge Tournament?</p><p>Instantly Lou Cheng felt thrilled with some fear and intense eagerness.</p><p>“Master, what kind of tournament is this?” asked Lou Cheng after a deep breath.</p><p>Geezer Shi waved his hand. “How would I know? I got it from a contact. Google it. Everything’s available online these days. Emm…”</p><p>He strolled away from the lake with his hands clasped behind his back.</p><p>“What a carefree master!” Lou Cheng whispered to himself while reading the invitation over and over again. His name and the serial number of this invitation were written in a corner. He quickly took his mobile out and started to search online.</p><p>“Phoenix Cup Warrior Sage Candidate Challenge Tournament…” As he typed in the name, many pages of results were returned with the first linking to the official website and the second to the forum of Longhu Club.</p><p>Err… After a moment of hesitation, Lou Cheng clicked on the second link and was redirected to a post from yesterday sent by a forum user he was quite familiar with.</p><p>The bragging Road to the Arena shared a picture of a gilded red invitation, identical to the one in his hand with the serial number and name blurred.</p><p>“Sigh. Just realized my martial arts soul was not buried completely. I’m very tempted to participate after receiving this invitation.” Road to the Arena left a line of vicissitudes below the picture.</p><p>Invincible Punch, a martial arts school student very popular on this forum replied, “Phoenix Cup Warrior Sage Candidate Challenge Tournament… Master Road, what tournament is this?”</p><p>Road to the Arena responded with a big smile. “A new one hosted by the richest man of our province in Yanling. It aims to become one of the top ten Challenge Tournaments besides the five title matches in five years. This is to be the first one, so no experience, low prize, small-scale, weak fighters, and barely any propaganda. Just for practice. It’s perfectly normal that you have never heard about it.”</p><p>A new challenge tournament for practice… Lou Cheng gained a basic understanding of the upcoming competition.</p><p>Sea-Blue, a pretty active and popular female user of the forum posted a confused panda. “Master Road has shared the invitation with us. You are sure thinking about taking part in.”</p><p>Road to the Arena replied a funny face. “Hard to quit! It’s been so long since my last fight… I doubt I can make it to the top 16. What a shame for my Professional Ninth Pin level!”</p><p>Such a small world. An acquaintance in a random challenge tournament… Lou Cheng didn’t reply but quietly watched the former Professional Ninth Pin martial artist bragging as he didn’t want his amateur level to be laughed at.</p><p>“Anything special for the top 16?” Road to the Arena’s reply was followed by Wonton Seller’s head-scratching sticker.</p><p>Road to the Arena answered, “This Challenge Tournament has no restriction on fighters’ rank or the number of participants. It offers different rewards for high standard fighters. The top 16 will each make 5,000 yuan. Make it to the top 8 and one will receive another 10,000. And the top 4 will be rewarded 20,000 more. The two in the final match will get an extra 40 grand each and the final prize for the champion is 80,000.</p><p>“In other words, the champion can make 155 grand in total whereas the runner-up gets 75,000. Pretty generous for the amateurs but not tempting enough to bring professional fighters all the way here. I bet only those of Professional Ninth Pin who happen to have some free time will sign up alongside a few of Eighth Pin who are very tight on money, which will pretty much be the level of the tournament. How many fighters can we expect? Well, only the best 16 are paid something. I don’t think enthusiastic amateurs will make a journey for it. So probably just some locals will give it a try.”</p><p>The words caused Lou Cheng several indrawn breaths. The level of the challenge tournament sounded much higher than what he had expected.</p><p>He thought it would be a competition among amateurs. But apparently, there would be quite some Professional Ninth Pin martial artists and maybe a few masters of Professional Eighth Pin who are very likely in the Danqi Stage already. Fighters of Amateur First, Second and Third Pin would be plenty!</p><p>“Master is giving me an opportunity to widen my knowledge greatly or, just as he said, he has no idea what this invitation will take me to?” Lou Cheng was lost in thoughts. Fortunately, he didn’t have a very high expectation. He knew he only had three-month training, and although making rapid progress, he was probably stronger than those of Amateur Eighth and Ninth Pin. And if he could keep up the good effort, he might finish his apprenticeship in a year.</p><p>“Whatever. Just for the experience. Hopefully, I can fight a few rounds. Who knows I won’t get super lucky to get all the good draws and make it all the way to the top 16?” Lou Cheng thought optimistically as his eyes moved down to read more of Road to the Arena’s post.</p><p>“Pretty high end! I thought Little Arena you could make it to the top four!” Wonton Seller loved to put “Little” in front of everyone’s name, despite their actual age, to drag them all to her level.</p><p>Road to the Arena Road sent a worn face smoking sticker. “No chance. I would be confidently aiming at a place of the top four taking a few years back. Now I need some really good luck to make it to the top 16. I don’t even think about the top 8. My former martial arts teacher felt sorry for my lack of perseverance when he gave me this invitation. I didn’t stick to the training.”</p><p>“No matter what, Master Road, you are still the no. one on our forum.” Beautiful World offered some comfort.</p><p>Pig-Riding Knight, the moderator of the forum, replied, “Keep us updated. We’d love to watch your legendary moves!”</p><p>“Sure! I’ll do my best not to bring shame to our forum!” Road to the Arena Road sent a sharp-eyed face pushing glasses.</p><p>Invincible Punch, the martial arts school student, wrote, “Master Road, I’m not far from Yanling. When is the tournament? I’d love to give it a try. At least I can gain some practical experience.”</p><p>“Sure. We can finally meet up in person for a drink or two,” Road to the Arena replied. “You better hurry. The entry deadline is 8 pm tonight and the tournament starts at 9 am the day after tomorrow. Four to five rounds of knockout and then eight groups with four fighters each. Best two from each group will advance to the top 16.”</p><p>“Okay. Got it. I’ll buy a train ticket after I sign up for the tournament. It only takes one hour by the express train,” said Invincible Punch.</p><p>He just failed to qualify the Professional Ninth Pin level in October, in desperate need of more actual combats.</p><p>A young girl Above the Sky also replied, “Don’t forget to broadcast live. Dragon King is on Chinese New Year holiday. I’m so bored!”</p><p>…</p><p>Their conversation amused Lou Cheng. Ha. One regional competition and two online friends. What a chance!</p><p>With so many participants, no way I will be fighting them…</p><p>With a brief understanding of Phoenix Cup Warrior Sage Candidate Challenge Tournament, Lou Cheng left the forum and visited the official website for more details. The tournament would start tomorrow (the post was from yesterday) and last for ten days. One would have more than one fight on average every day if he could make it to the final, so those who had their eyes on the prize would aim at quick victories in the knockout and group competition stages to save strength and prevent injuries.</p><p>“Return train tickets, accommodation, and food…” Lou Cheng calculated the coming expenses and talked to himself, “Damn! This will empty my pocket!”</p><p>All the money I have saved up for my dates with Yan Zheke!</p><p>Putting away my new year lucky money, all I have for now is 500 yuan for going home and another 500 saved from my daily expenses. But the trip would cost a fortune. One train ticket to Yanling and one from Yanling back home. Ten-day of tournament… Well, I can’t make it to the final, not even the top 16. The group competition stage… Maybe. Maybe I’m lucky. So seven days of accommodation plus meals… I can’t even afford a cheap guesthouse…</p><p>Lou Cheng pondered over it and called his mom up for more money to cover an extra seven or eight days in school.</p><p>Fortunately, his mom was prepared for this when he planned to wait for Yan Zheke to go home together.</p><p>With an extra 500 yuan to cover his living expenses, he felt relieved and quickly purchased train tickets using a mobile app.</p><p>It was not the Spring Festival peak season yet, so tickets to Yanling was very easy to buy. To save money, he would take the 9 pm train which would arrive just after midnight. Luckily there were still a few tickets left from Yanling to his home city, which saved him some hassle to fight for tickets on different mobile apps.</p><p>“It will be quite late when I arrive, so I better take a room near the train station tonight. Tomorrow I can bring my luggage to the venue. If I lose, try to change my ticket home. But If I win, look for accommodation close to the venue…” Lou Cheng planned things out and tried to book it online in case everywhere was fully occupied.</p><p>After all this, he logged in his QQ to share this adventure with Yan Zheke.</p><p>Before he pressed the Send button, he suddenly became unsure about it.</p><p>It’s probably a bad idea to tell her I’m going to a tournament. What if I’m out in the first round? How humiliating it will be when she asks how it goes! Better wait for a decent result and then share with her…</p><p>But what if she thinks I’ve been hiding it from her? How could I pretend nothing is happening and give her no hint at all?</p><p>After considering over and over again, Lou Cheng chose to be honest and sent a big smile.</p><p>“As you are not going back to Xiushan, I’ll attend a Challenge Tournament for some actual combat experience.”</p><p>By 9 am, Yan Zheke finally replied a jealous emoji with a pair of bright eyes.</p><p>“What Challenge Tournament?”</p><p>“Phoenix Cup Warrior Sage Candidate Challenge Tournament in Yanling. I heard it from Geezer Shi. I have nothing to do anyway. Might just give it a try. The tournament will start tomorrow. I’m taking an express train tonight.” Lou Cheng briefed her with the general information of the Challenge Tournament.</p><p>“My flight is in tomorrow morning. Can’t make it… Do your best! Don’t bring shame to our Songcheng University Martial Arts Club! “I’ll be watching you!” Yan Zheke sent a pair of piercing eyes.</p><p>The chat went on and off until 5 pm. Lou Cheng quickly packed his bag with some spare clothes, exercise clothes, and his laptop and left the rest of his belongings in his locker. “Will I have no clothes to wear when at home?”</p><p>His big backpack seemed much lighter than before. He said goodbye to Zhao Qiang and other roommates before knocking on the next door.</p><p>“Talker, my train leaves tonight. What about you?” He asked Cai Zongming.</p><p>Cai Zongming grinned. “I don’t know yet. My love is coming to Songcheng and we will stay a few days for some fun.”</p><p>Looking at his proud smile, Lou Cheng threw a punch on his shoulder and shouted,</p><p>“See you next year!”</p><p>“See you next year!” Cai Zongming waved.</p><p>With no sadness for parting, Lou Cheng rushed to the school bus stop. A ton of students were already waiting there. It took him half an hour to get on the bus.</p><p>Putting away his backpack, Lou Cheng took a seat. Weishui Lake with a thin layer of ice, teaching buildings at dusk, and lonely commercial streets; sceneries of the campus went backward quickly in front of Lou Cheng’s eyes.</p><p>That was the moment when Lou Cheng finally realized he would be away for a month.</p><p>…</p><p>Yan Zheke went to bed early around 11 pm because of her early morning flight to Jiangnan the next day. Lou Cheng took a nap in the train and woke up ten minutes before the train arrived at Yanling.</p><p>Outside the window was a long night, strange lights ran fast backward. Lou Cheng looked blankly with sorrow and fear in his heart.</p><p>I’m going to a completely strange city!</p><p>I’m looking at completely strange views!</p><p>I know no one there. I feel no warmth there.</p><p>As the train came to a halt, he followed the crowd out of the station. A cold gust blew on his face, refreshing and biting.</p><p>Lou Cheng shivered. He said no to all illegal taxi drivers and small hotel agents and started to make his way to a nearby hotel along a wide road following the navigation on his mobile with the big bag on his back.</p><p>The road was quiet with few passers-by and trees on both sides like monsters standing with open mouth at night. Just like every other city but full of strange scents, Lou Cheng felt all alone in that strange land that night.</p><p>He’d never been to a strange place all by himself. His parents, relatives, or teachers and peers from the Martial Arts Club would be there with him. But this time, alone, he went there for his martial arts dream and a brand new start of his life.</p><p>Thinking about dreams, Yan Zheke and the Challenge Tournament, Lou Cheng took a deep breath. Then he started to run slowly in that evening, that strange city and that absolute hollowness and desolation. An old song he began to sing,</p><p>“I know my future is not a dream.”</p><p>“I live every minute to the full.”</p><p>“My future is not a dream.”</p><p>…</p><p>The singing echoed in that cold night as his figure disappeared in the distance</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
