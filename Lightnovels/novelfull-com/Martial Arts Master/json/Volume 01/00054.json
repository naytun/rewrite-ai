Noises converged above the gymnasium from all directions and dispersed to everywhere indoor along with warm air.</p><p>He lifted his eyes to the stand, which used to be virtually empty, surprisedly noticing crowds of spectators and flowing ones in the aisles. The stadium was much more boisterous than the former five rounds of knockouts.</p><p>Lou Cheng estimated the spectators at least 8,000, according to the proportion of vacant seats to the total number in Martial Arts Stadium of Yanling.</p><p>The amount of 8,000 left a boundless impression on the present people as the total of 10,000 did. Lou Cheng wagged his tongue, feeling like a drop in the ocean.</p><p>Many cameras had been set up in suitable places, some pointing at the ring, some at the stand and others moving with journalists, naturally creating a formal and solemn atmosphere.</p><p>Group competitions were not televised live on Yanling TV Station. What TV viewers saw were the edited videos containing some clips of the interview with randomly chosen fighters, spectators, and staff of sponsors. However, the crucial matches of the top 16 fighters were broadcast live to Yanling people.</p><p>Lou Cheng slipped across to the corner to avoid any disturbance from the crowd. He took a detour to the locker room and got in touch with the field staff waiting here.</p><p>“Mr… Lou, Round three for your fight. You can watch others’ fights either in the seats for guests at the grandstand or by the screen in the locker room.” Seeing much of the schoolboy in the contestant, the officer doubted if “Mr.” was the appropriate appellation in this case.</p><p>Lou Cheng paused to think before he said, “I’m resting in the locker room.”</p><p>The tactic he decided on for the coming fight was quite strength-consuming and spirit-pressing which demanded high concentration. Lou Cheng must conserve energy and build up strength before his fight.</p><p>“I’ll remind you in due time.” The officer answered with a smile and walked out of the locker room.</p><p>The empty and quiet locker room, which was well set off by noise and bustle outside, provided a good place for Lou Cheng to rest.</p><p>With a tranquil and enjoyable feeling, Lou Cheng sat in the middle of the metal bench, took out the phone and replied to Yan Zheke’s messages.</p><p>“I’m sitting in the locker room of the gymnasium now. Are you feeling better about your stomachache?”</p><p>Yan Zheke sent a hush emoji, “Much better now! I survived. Cheng, your coming fight is quite energy consuming. Stop chatting and reserve yourself for the match.”</p><p>“Emm… You don’t have to cheer for me today.” Lou Cheng sent a funny face.</p><p>Yan Zheke sent a smiling behind hands emoji, “Are you worried that cheering can’t make a difference?”</p><p>“No, no, no. It is lucky for me to encounter an expert of Professional Ninth Pin. I have to bring my real strength into play for the better self-positioning and gap-filling. Your cheering for me will no doubt inflate me with fake strength. ” Lou Cheng sent a sneer emoji.</p><p>Yan Zheke replied with a face in tears of joy, “You’re honest!”</p><p>“Of course!” A characteristic smile unknowingly crawled on Lou Cheng’s face,</p><p>Yan Zheke sent an emoji of a numb face looking up into the sky, “Well, may you demonstrate your spirits and characteristics in the coming fight!”</p><p>“It sounds familiar,” replied Lou Cheng with a quizzical face.</p><p>Yan Zheke sent a laughing emoji, “I happened to hear it in the speech given by the principal last time…”</p><p>“Puff …” Lou Cheng chuckled and sent a fighting emoji, knowing that Yan Zheke was trying to liven things up and calm his nerves. “Fortunately, the Warrior Sage Challenge Tournament did not invite the principal to present a speech… Rest assured that I mean to test my strength today. Victory is worth celebrating while failure a matter of no regret.”</p><p>Yan Zheke sent a touching head sticker,</p><p>“Give you a word of advice then. My grandpa often said it to my cousin, “Enjoy the fight and enjoy the martial arts! ”</p><p>“Enjoy the fight and enjoy the martial arts …” Lou Cheng chanted the eight words silently. He sent a waving emoji, signed out QQ and closed his eyes for rest.</p><p>How long afterward it was that the door of the locker room was knocked on. Lou Cheng opened his eyes seeing the officer walking in.</p><p>“It’s your turn, Mr. Lou.” The officer gestured for him to go to the ring.</p><p>Lou Cheng patted his black-edged white suit into place, stood up, took a deep breath and walked out of the locker room. Before him was the soaring dome, a dark mass of countless spectators and the shining ring.</p><p>…</p><p>Once again in the stand sat Liu Yinglong, Qin Zhilin and other disciples of Baiyuan Martial Arts School.</p><p>“Why do we have to see Lou Cheng’s fight again, big brother? We have seen what we should see and learned what we should learn. A clear understanding of his characteristics!” Qin Zhilin thought they could have made better use of the time instead of being Lou Cheng’s audience.</p><p>Liu Yinglong smiled, “I just want to see what surprise he can create…”</p><p>“Surprise? Any chance for him to win Wang Ye of Professional Ninth Pin?” Qin Zhilin scoffed.</p><p>…</p><p>In the seats for guests were Ye Youting and Jiang Lan of Danqi Realm sitting side by side.</p><p>“How long can he stay in the ring…” Ye Youting said abruptly, watching Lou Cheng stepping toward the ring along the shining aisle.</p><p>Jiang Lan looked quiet and refined, a young girl in her twenties. She smiled gently, “I just hope he will not give up on the fight and consume some of his opponent’s energy. Wang Ye is a strong contender for the champion.”</p><p>“Lan, you give too much weight to Wang Ye.” Ye Youting turned around, her eyes shining with the desire to win.</p><p>Jiang Lan smiled gently, Wang Ye is known as a ferocious fighter. His Iron Palm is quite brutal and vicious. He just consumes very little strength unless he encounters well-matched opponents. Quite the reverse for me. The consumption of energy and strength is being accumulated from every match. I don’t have the confidence in defeating him before my physical strength drains.</p><p>“I’m also a ferocious fighter…” Ye Youting whispered.</p><p>…</p><p>After handing in his phone and other belongings to the match supervisor, Lou Cheng stepped up the flight of stone stairs into the ring. Before he came to a stop, a burst of cheering swept the whole stadium.</p><p>The cheering was from his audience which grew from zero to the current scale in previous matches.</p><p>Lou Cheng felt a glow of pride at the thought of his audience whose cheering stirred his blood. He had entered the optimal state for the fight. In front of him stood firm Wang Ye in dark cyan martial arts suit.</p><p>“Group Four, Round one: Wang Ye of Professional Ninth Pin whose Iron Palm holds the ring in awe versus Lou Cheng, a mysterious dark horse whose name is spreading like wildfire in martial arts world!”</p><p>“Will Wang Ye succeed in defending the honor of Professional Ninth Pin with his Iron Palm or Lou Cheng create another dark-horse miracle?”</p><p>In the broadcast of the martial arts stadium, the announcer shouted the names of the two combatants in a rather provocative tone.</p><p>The enthusiasm of the audience was kindled again in a flash. Mr. Zheng, the couple and all other spectators were cheering even more wildly.</p><p>The referee took a glance at the electronic clock and the two fighters,</p><p>“Three-minute talk time.”</p><p>The voice was still in the air when Lou Cheng saw a glimmer of smile come to the lips of Wang Ye. The young man of short hair said to Lou Cheng,</p><p>“You’re really an interesting opponent. I’ve watched your fight videos in which your growth is visible. You are getting ahead in actual combats at an alarming rate in just a few days. How daunting you are!”</p><p>“I should have thrilled at an opponent like you and brought your forte into play for mutual learning. Yet, I’m sorry that I have to score a quick victory this time to save my strength for the following strong opponents as the prize money of the tournament means an awful lot to me.”</p><p>Lou Cheng felt appreciation and regret in his sincere words.</p><p>He smiled,</p><p>“I’m sorry that you can’t make a quick victory this time.”</p><p>They smiled at each other as some mutual understanding developed.</p><p>Lou Cheng and Wang Ye did not care about the psychological tactics. They patiently waited for the referee’s announcement in silence.</p><p>“Fight!” Suddenly, the referee waved his right hand down.</p><p>Lou Cheng spurted out from his assured poise in a flash. He adjusted his muscles to shift his weight nimbly, like a terrifying snake tearing into its prey.</p><p>Dropping his weight deeper and lifting iron gray hands in the air, Wang Ye stayed put and made no preparatory judgment.</p><p>Lou Cheng took a step abruptly right to the left of Wang Ye. He stroke a blow with bitter chill soundlessly and swiftly.</p><p>Pang!</p><p>Wang Ye abruptly pushed his right hand through the space under the left underarm. His Iron Palm was gleaming with metallic luster and renting the air even without any preparation. He meant to confront Lou Cheng’s tough attack with toughness!</p><p>Lou Cheng remembered that the same palm badly injured the metacarpal bones of a fighter of Amateur Third Pin in the second round of knockout.</p><p>He adjusted his weight. His dashing right palm made a curve with its force fading away, while the whole body of him made a seemingly deliberate dodge to the back of Wang Ye like a ghost.</p><p>Before Lou Cheng stood firm to launch his attack, the muscles on Wang Ye’s left leg had been adjusted readily to give a Horse Kick!</p><p>Wang Ye’s left leg strangely kicked out of nowhere with abrupt explosive force streaming through his entire body, comparable to Jin Invincible Punch Tao’s Tiger Tail Kicking tactic, fast, accurate and merciless.</p><p>Before balancing his weight, Lou Cheng took another smooth step to Wang Ye’s right side, perfectly dodging the kick. All audience was stunned by his swift moves which seemed like going against human dynamics.</p><p>Lou Cheng carried on with his weird posture, his right arm whipping to Wang Ye with abrupt explosive force, who had just withdrawn his left leg.</p><p>Wang Ye had watched Lou Cheng’s match videos, fully aware of his extraordinary control over muscles to adjust his weight. The Hai Di Lao Yue (a martial tactic) and Horse Kick were expressly prepared for the fight with Lou Cheng. Yet it was still a surprise for Wang Ye that Lou Cheng could make a continuous change of weight even dealing with attacks at the same time.</p><p>Wang Ye’s face turned serious. His right hand abruptly waved backward from the left side and stroke straightaway to Lou Cheng, making a short and rapid sound of friction.</p><p>The unique skill of Iron Palm – Back Thrust!</p><p>The mighty Back Thrust caught everyone present unawares. Liu Yinglong and other spectators were filled with apprehension, thinking Lou Cheng had no choice but to confront it with toughness. Once it happened, the ring would be Wang Ye’s stage!</p><p>Yet, what exactly happened next stunned the audience again. Lou Cheng swiftly made another step backward, successfully dodging the Back Thrust and moving to the back of Wang Ye all over again. Yet the explosive force of his right arm faded away.</p><p>“Mercurial balance…” Ye Yuting muttered to herself in the stand.</p><p>Jiang Lan said in a whisper,</p><p>“Interesting …”</p><p>“I almost believe him to be a fighter of Danqi stage if his force had not faded away, far from body acting like one and coordinating at will.</p><p>Gladder than surprised, Wang Ye felt at the center of the ring, with the wild enthusiasm for martial arts climbing to his face.</p><p>What an interesting opponent!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
