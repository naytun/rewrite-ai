His bones were suffering an awful pain. Staring at Wu Shitong’s confident, calm smile, Lou Cheng lost his head.</p><p>In a flash, he concluded that Wu Shitong was truly bad at flexibility and agility, uncomfortable dealing with skirmish fight. His style was completely restrained by Lou Cheng’s Biting Chill and styles like arm boxing or he would have achieved a much higher level than Amateur Second Pin. So he schemed to lure Lou Cheng into his trap by making up such a good story.</p><p>Once Lou Cheng fell for his story and had his wrist grabbed, Wu Shitong’s disadvantages instantly vanished. He no longer needed to worry about some matter being neglected over another, his vital point being hit, or his body defense being broken. From this point, the story turned into his field of fierceness and toughness with an extra advantage of locking Lou Cheng’s wrist. The result of meeting strength with strength within such a small area could easily be imagined.</p><p>This is the most difficult situation I’ve ever encountered!</p><p>Will this be my last scene in this tournament?</p><p>When Lou Cheng’s solid hit resulted in nothing but his wrist being grabbed by Wu Shitong, Old Zheng and many spectators felt a chill down their spine. He rose up instinctively for a better view while giving out a cry unconsciously.</p><p>The sudden change of tide stunned Liu Yinglong, Qin Zhilin and other members of Baiyuan Martial Arts School. They could hardly believe he had lost the upper hand and fallen into extreme danger. His left hand was caught, limiting his combat range to a very small room in front of Wu Shitong who was specialized in Golden Bell Cover, Grand Stele Breaking Hand and Grand Stele Casting Hand. The outcome of the match could be foreseen.</p><p>The short-haired young man with a layer of metal glow on his hands stared coldly and blurted out.</p><p>“Golden Bell Cover!”</p><p>Screams and shouts echoed in the stadium. Road to the Arena who just won his match was about to watch a random fight with Jin Tao the Invincible Punch when this unusual disturbance caught their attention. They turned to the stands and then followed the viewers’ eyes to a big screen where their eyes froze.</p><p>“Lou Cheng?” Both Invincible Punch and Road to the Arena were very impressed with this martial artist. Seeing him in such great adversity, their attention was fully drawn.</p><p>Thoughts and ideas flew across his mind, with panic, fear and instinctive struggle.</p><p>He shook his left hand in an attempt to break free but Wu Shitong’s five fingers grabbed tightly like a metal claw. The pull and push worsened the pain at Lou Cheng’s carpal but only earned him less than an arm’s distance as Wu Shitong’s right hand reached out.</p><p>Jindan in his lower stomach spun like nebula but didn’t bring any change to the situation. Lou Cheng would have completely lost control over his head and fought unconsciously if not in the Condensation Stance state.</p><p>At this time, the slightly rippled lake in his heart reflected a rough picture of Wu Shitong’s body muscles through his skin and pores around Lou Cheng’s wrist.</p><p>Wu Shitong’s right arm muscles twitched with strength coming through his waist from his right leg… Lou Cheng sensed the motion and became alarmed. In his head, a silver lightning bolt struck down from heaven and started a prairie fire.</p><p>Pang!</p><p>A hot stream rushed through his body. Lou Cheng kicked out his right foot with great explosive force!</p><p>His move was closely followed by Wu Shitong’s fierce right kick like a solid whip with a crispy sound. His leg met Lou Cheng’s kick to the side, giving out a dull sound of collision as if planned.</p><p>“His right arm slightly pulled back, building up strength for his left hand…” Again Lou Cheng heard a movement and responded quickly by instinct. He lowered his weight and threw out his right palm fast but quietly.</p><p>Bam! His right palm met the opponent’s Grand Stele Breaking Hand halfway. Seemingly Wu Shitong was playing along Lou Cheng’s plan, feeding his left wrist to Lou Cheng’s right palm and losing all his strength.</p><p>“What…” The audience was lost and shocked by how lucky Lou Cheng had been for his two desperate moves to have blocked Wu Shitong’s fatal strikes by chance.</p><p>Sitting next to the short-haired young man with an iron-colored touch on his hands, the senior man with big earlobes praised,</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>He turned to the short-haired youth, “Junior Ye, his Listening Skill is much better than yours.”</p><p>“Listening Skill?” The short-haired young man came to some understanding.</p><p>After the two successful blocks, Lou Cheng had completely calmed down. The lake in his heart became a mirror of ice, reflecting every little move of Wu Shitong through their contacted skin.</p><p>What looked like a bad ending might turn out to be good. His wrist being grabbed might not be such a bad deal after all.</p><p>My left hand can’t move, neither can your right hand! And I can predict your attacks through this contact!</p><p>It’s still too early to tell who will emerge victoriously!</p><p>“Exactly. Without great meditation ability and full grasp of Condensation Stance and 24 Blizzard Strikes, he wouldn’t be able to hear this well. Wu Shitong has overplayed his hand.” The senior man explained to the short-haired youth with a grin.</p><p>At this point, Wu Shitong also noticed how things were not going as he had planned. The opponent seemed to be favored by God, seeing through all his moves.</p><p>He didn’t want to let go the advantage from grabbing Lou Cheng’s wrist. A wicked idea formed and he twisted his right hand in an attempt to break Lou Cheng’s carpus. “Be it successful or not, the pain will make him lose his head and calmness!”</p><p>Lou Cheng sensed the movement in Wu Shitong’s right hand and followed along with the twist, resolving most of the power and absorbing some energy. Lying in the air, his right leg kicked like a soft whip towards Wu Shitong’s left temple.</p><p>That was the weak point of all physical body training in body refining and Danqi stages!</p><p>According to the information, Yan Zheke had gathered, Golden Bell Cover was one of them.</p><p>Wu Shitong dared not neglect. He lowered his weight and raised his left elbow to his ear height to block Lou Cheng’s kick. Right before he could launch his counterattack, Lou Cheng’s left arm pulled back, adjusting his weight with the strength from Wu Shitong’s instinctive twitch and restoring balance. He dived forward to shorten the distance between the two and absorbed more energy for a knee kick at Wu Shitong’s crotch.</p><p>I doubt your body training has reached this part!</p><p>Wu Shitong’s face turned pale. With no time for a flying kick, he moved his right leg slightly forth and received the deadly kick at his thigh.</p><p>Bouncing back from the collision, Lou Cheng adjusted his weight and absorbed more energy. The snow-capped mountain collapsed in his mind. White streams rolled down to devour everything. He threw another punch at Wu Shitong’s temple.</p><p>24 Blizzard Strikes. Mega Avalanche!</p><p>Wu Shitong’s left arm tensed for a powerful strike had to rise to protect his temple.</p><p>Pang! A heavy punch on his left arm. With much of his strength sucked by Lou Cheng, Wu Shitong no longer had any advantage in physical might. He changed his move at the very last second.</p><p>On the stand, Liu Yinglong, Qin Zhilin and other martial arts students could hardly believe their eyes. Old Zheng, the young couple and other spectators were muted with shock. They didn’t understand how Lou Cheng in great adversity managed to turn the table.</p><p>The change of tide in the ring was beyond their knowledge of martial arts.</p><p>“Beautiful!” Road to the Arena and Invincible Punch clapped unconsciously for this intense battle.</p><p>24 Blizzard Strikes was a violent, brutal martial arts set that based on the wielder’s Listening Skills.</p><p>To achieve such great Listening Skill, god knows how far Lou Cheng’s Solemn Silence has gone beyond my expectation! Otherwise, that home practicing disciple of Daxing Temple wouldn’t have given his such an opportunity!</p><p>After the block, Lou Cheng absorbed more energy and withdrew his left arm abruptly. Tightly held by Wu Shitong, he swallowed the pain on his carpus and exerted full strength to pull the opponent out of balance!</p><p>Wu Shitong was staggering when Lou Cheng strode forward to push him with his left hand. His right fist, bearing the force of a mighty avalanche, reached out towards Wu Shitong’s temple.</p><p>Out of balance and unable to exert his strength, Wu Shitong got in a defensive position in great dismay. He raised his arm in a rush to protect his vital part.</p><p>The might of the avalanche reached its peak in Lou Cheng’s mind. Hundreds of thousands of tons of snow pounded down, blocking the daylight.</p><p>Bam! His punch hit Wu Shitong’s arm which went on to hit Wu Shitong’s temple.</p><p>Bam! Instantly, a drumming sound started to echo in Wu Shitong’s head. His vision blurred and the fingers of his right hand loosened up.</p><p>Lou Cheng grabbed his arm with his left hand, turned and leaned to throw a buttock!</p><p>Pong!</p><p>Wu Shitong’s sturdy body was thrown to the ground. Lou Cheng advanced to push his advantage and lifted his toe at Wu Shitong’s temple, about to kick.</p><p>“Match Six. Lou Cheng won!” The referee called after a careful look.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“Beautiful!”</p><p>Most of the audience were lost until now. They realized Lou Cheng had turned the tide magically. They cheered and applauded for this fascinating match and for the powerful Lou Cheng.</p><p>The passion and heat in the applause touched the softest part of Lou Cheng. That glory belonged to him and no one else.</p><p>When his left hand got caught, he thought that was it. He had no idea his Listening Skill could save him from losing.</p><p>Within a small space the ability manifested!</p><p>“Staying calm is very important in battle.” Lou Cheng realized his biggest gain of the day.</p><p>He put down his right foot and stretched out a hand to pull Wu Shitong up. With a gentle smile he said,</p><p>“Thanks for your instructions.”</p><p>Lou Cheng would like to play cool and compliment his opponent for being able to drive him into great adversity briefly but decided to be humble.</p><p>In constant cheers and applause, Wu Shitong gazed at Lou Cheng.</p><p>“I thought I could win.”</p><p>He walked down the flight of stairs, leaving Lou Cheng looking at this lone, isolated figure from behind.</p><p>Lou Cheng made it out from the fourth round of knockout!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
