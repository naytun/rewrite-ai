Since Lou Cheng participated in actual combats, he developed a habit of making quick decisions. Once he recognized Wang Xu, he was ready to save him without a second thought.</p><p>In other days, he would act exactly like Jiang Fei, timid and jittery. Even the one hounded by mobs was his childhood friend who used to watch his back, he still dared not take another look. He was incapable of handling this situation, and being reckless would only cause more trouble and get his family involved in this mess. At best, he could call the police for them. However, the situation had changed now. With experience gained in the Warrior Sage Challenge Tournament, he made a tremendous progress both in martial arts and mental state. Observant and assertive, Lou Cheng had grown to be confident and calm.</p><p>How could he stay out of the affair with this power and strength? He was not gonna stand there and watch Wang Xu get killed in front of him.</p><p>For a fraction of second, Lou Cheng took down his down jacket and threw it to Jiang Fei.</p><p>“Hide yourself!” said Lou Cheng in a quick and low voice.</p><p>Jiang Fei was too shocked and frightened to give any responses. Upon seeing Lou Cheng rushing out, he suddenly sensed the danger and was about to stop him. But being in a total mess, Jiang Fei was too afraid to speak out.</p><p>“How could Cheng be so reckless? In front of him was three mobs with knives!</p><p>What should I do? What should I do?”</p><p>When Jiang Fei was at a loss, Lou Cheng carefully made a plan before the confrontation. He checked out his surroundings as well as the landscape to make sure there were no cameras. Although there were dim lights coming from households on both sides of the alley, he successfully hid among the darkness by lowering his weight while approaching in zigzag snake steps.</p><p>He was experienced and calm since he had encountered many accidents in the ring. For instance, when he was hung between victory and defeat or when the Jindan (the Golden Elixir) failed to work normally. He had to take the consequence into the consideration if he decided to save Wang Xu. Suppose he was caught by camera or remembered by reporters who came after, especially when he couldn’t kill all to keep the secret, then it’s very likely to get himself or his family in trouble.</p><p>Lou Cheng shifted his weight while moving in a weird snake footwork. With eyes fixed on the three upcoming opponents, Lou Cheng made his way with particular caution. Dispite that he had defeated a Professional Ninth Pin, he never underestimated his enemies.</p><p>In the body refining stage, there was an old saying that even a martial expert couldn’t take a kitchen knife. In front of him were three mobs with knives, and he was very likely to get hurt since he had just recovered from the boomerang effect of the Jindan (the Golden Elixir), so he had to be careful.</p><p>It was no longer a challenge tournament. In the ring, referees might protect fighters from many dangers, such as explosive forces and close attacks, yet accidents still happened. In actual combats, people got hurt or killed by knives or guns for real.</p><p>If Lou Cheng stood back, none of these would be his concern. But once involved, he must try his utmost to take one down as soon as possible. In this way, the match would be easier with two versus two on each side.</p><p>The Night was dark without any moonlight or starlight, Wang Xu and other three mobs were busy running and failed to notice Lou Cheng was approaching. In the darkest part of the backstreet, Lou Cheng suddenly sped up in less than 10 meters away and came to Wang Xu from his left side in big strides, with eyes fixed on the first mob’s knife.</p><p>Wang Xu was still running, but he felt a ghost running past him.</p><p>Upon seeing Lou Cheng rushing toward him, the first mob dared not take him slightly. He, with a knife in his right hand, grinned and chopped at Lou Cheng ruthlessly.</p><p>At this very moment, a flash of lightning struck in his mind, starting a prairie fire in the dark. Lou Cheng transformed a downward hot flow from his spine into a burst of strength,thus pushing his speed to the ultimate level like an arrow. The mob mistakenly measured his speed and the distance. Instantly, Lou Cheng came near the first mob, warding off the attack with both hands rising to engage his knife-holding wrist.</p><p>In such a close range, the long knife was no longer helpful.</p><p>The minute Lou Cheng engaged mob’s wrists; he twisted his waist and tightened leg muscles to lunch a knee kick, which was directly hit at mob’s stomach.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Came a dull noise, the one who got punched glared with a runny nose and watery eyes. As the mob was about to fall on the ground because of exhaustion, Lou caught him with one hand meanwhile broke his machete-holding wrist by twisting another hand.</p><p>Just round one, he had already defeated one hatchet man.</p><p>Upon seeing what Lou Cheng had done, the other hatchet man nearby shrank his pupils and brandished a knife direct at him. Instead of chasing Wang Xu, the third mob changed his target as well.</p><p>In no rush, Lou Cheng straightened his back and pulled strength from hand. By pushing the guy he was holding to the second hatchet man beside him, Lou Cheng successfully got his enemy distracted. Then he slid to the left side and stood ready to hit vital parts.</p><p>To save his companions, the third hatchet man slashed at Lou Cheng without hesitation.</p><p>All of a sudden, Lou Cheng moved his spine as if a dragon breaking through all kinds of barriers. He abruptly shifted his weight and pulled his body back by adjusting muscles, then with a round footwork, he made his way to the rear side of the third hatchet man in an opposite direction.</p><p>With this impressive footwork, people might mistakenly believe the rumor of ghost in this dim alley.</p><p>After changing his positions, Lou Cheng lowered his weight into a steady stance. In his mind, snow-covered mountains started to collapse and white streams rolled down formidably. By virtue of this force, he lifted his right arm and violently launched a downward attack.</p><p>“Pang!”</p><p>Lou Cheng’s fists accurately landed at the third mob’s shoulder, with a crunching noise, the mob’s right shoulder started to collapse. As painful as he cried, he threw the machete and writhed on the ground with his left hand on the right shoulder.</p><p>Mighty Mega Avalanche!</p><p>Now Lou Cheng had taken down two enemies, and the only one left was freaked out. Without looking at his opponent being tall or short, fat or thin, the third hatchet man gave up saving his buddies and decided to flee the scene while brandishing a machete crazily in the air. Smart guys know all the ins and outs!</p><p>Lou Cheng pretended to chase after the mob by making noises of footsteps, which scared the shit out of him. Like a rabbit shot by an arrow, the mob feared to look back and instantly ran to the other side of the backstreet, soon fading into the darkness.</p><p>Hearing the scream, Wang Xu stopped, looking shocked and puzzled. He turned back only to find that three mobs who had been after him were either on the ground or flee the scene. The dark alley became silent again.</p><p>“Who is that?” Wang Xu asked subconsciously, meanwhile Jiang Fei who had been hidden in a dark corner was also stunned by what he had just seen.</p><p>Did he see a superman just now?</p><p>No way, how come Cheng became a superman!</p><p>The screen of his cell reflected dim light in the darkness as he was about to call the police. But now there was no need for that.</p><p>Lou Cheng returned to the place with some lights on. Two hatchet men were still humming on the ground, Lou Cheng checked at them in case of any violent counterattacks. Meanwhile, he signaled Wang Xu to stay quiet.</p><p>Wang Xu saw a vague figure walking toward him, bewildered as he was, he forgot all the cuts and pains in his back. Like being in a bizarre dream, Wang Xu thought him was being stabbed and everything was his fantasy before the deathbed.</p><p>How is it Cheng?</p><p>Lou Cheng was not one of the powerless, yet definitely a good student who dared not and would not fight. Being stronger and braver, Wang Xu always counted Lou Cheng as a nerd.</p><p>However, it was exactly Cheng who had taken care of three knife-holding hatchet men between several breaths, let alone these men were of Amateur Sixth or Seventh Pin, highly valued by their boss.</p><p>Was that a dream?</p><p>I even agreed to teach him a few moves so he could make some progress in martial arts. Wang Xu thought.</p><p>The pain soon made him stay conscious, Wang Xu, directed by Lou Cheng’s hand gestures, hurried to the other alley.</p><p>Lou Cheng ran back to their original spot and dragged the already stunned Jiang Fei out of the alley immediately. The dim backstreet was silent again, with two figures curling up on the ground and groaning painfully.</p><p>Lou Cheng met Wang Xu outside two allies, and he instructed Jiang Fei to hide at a distance, as he did not want to get his innocent best buddy in high school involved in this affair.</p><p>“Do you have a shelter?” Lou Cheng asked outspokenly.</p><p>Wang Xu covered his wounds with clothes inside and said in a trance, “Yep, I can go there to handle my wound.”</p><p>“Go ahead, I will leave you alone and we will talk about it later,” Lou Cheng said in a firm tone, making himself clear that he wanted nothing to do with these mobs or mafias. What happened before was him trying to save a friend.</p><p>Wang Xu nodded with a sigh and said, “If I could settle all the problems, I will talk to you soon.”</p><p>Upon finishing the line, he stepped up his pace and disappeared into the night on the other end of the alley.</p><p>Lou Cheng shook his head behind Wang Xu with mixed feelings and left this dangerous place in a hurry. When they were back to the neighborhood where Old Liu Barbeque was located,</p><p>Jiang Fei was still badly shaken, peeking at him from time to time in the car.</p><p>“I mean, feel free to check on me and stop peaking,” Lou Cheng put on his down jacket and said in anger.</p><p>“You know the person who got hunted by mobs?” Jiang Fei asked in a gentle and casual way.</p><p>“Yep, he is my childhood friend.” Lou Cheng kept his reply simple, without giving further information.</p><p>Of course, Jiang Fei did not care about his answer and continued to ask with eyes wide open, “Cheng, when did you become a superman? I remembered our last match and I crushed you with my weight.”</p><p>For physical training, martial arts were taught in PE classes during high school, and they competed with each other for fun.</p><p>“Have I already told you that I joined Songcheng University Martial Arts Club and kept my practice every single day?” Lou Cheng had his chin up and said, “Just drive, so we can go home earlier.”</p><p>Jiang Fei started the car with doubtful mutterings. “I thought you went to the Martial Arts Club for girls, and how long have you been there? A couple of months?”</p><p>“When two goals are set, I aim to achieve both,” Lou Cheng said causally. He felt rather low because of Wang Xu, and right now he was in no mood to brag about participating the Warrior Sage Challenge Tournament or engaging with several Professional Ninth Pin masters.</p><p>Before starting the car, Jiang Fei gave another careful look of Lou Cheng in the dim light of the car. His best friend in high school looked tired, with body growing leaner and face being more chiseled from brows to chins. He pinched his lips with an air of calmness and confidence, and his look made people unconsciously follow his arrangements.</p><p>“Cheng, you seem to be more mature… ” Jiang Fei failed to find the right word to describe how he felt about Lou Cheng currently. He had said this before over their barbeque, and the meaning carried in this line was completely different.</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled and said, “Wish you meant well.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
