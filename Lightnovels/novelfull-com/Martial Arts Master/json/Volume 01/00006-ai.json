  "body": "<p>The first to enter was Qiu Zhigao, known as Old Qiu. Standing at 1.75 meters, he matched Lou Cheng in height but was sturdier, his muscles well-defined. He often flaunted his physique in the dorm, a proud member of the Martial Arts Club. Lacking formal martial arts training, he relied on his impressive physical condition to achieve Amateur Sixth Pin, just shy of Cai Zongming.</p>\n<p>Old Qiu was far from rude; he was straightforward and friendly. He had no major flaws, except for his fondness for adult films. Realizing that a future in martial arts alone wouldn’t suffice, especially since he remained an Amateur Sixth Pin upon entering university, he dedicated himself to his studies, even skipping the Martial Arts Club's Welcome Party.</p>\n<p>“Cheng, what did they say at the orientation? What time are the weekly drills? When can we use the strength training gym?” Qiu Zhigao bombarded Lou Cheng with questions, eager to know what had been discussed earlier that day.</p>\n<p>Taken aback, Lou Cheng replied, “I left a bit early and missed it. We can ask someone else later.”</p>\n<p>After encountering a significant event earlier, Lou Cheng had completely forgotten his intention to chat with Yan Zheke.</p>\n<p>“It’s better if you stay put,” said Zhao Qiang, the second to arrive. He was the dorm leader, a diligent student with a medium build, bushy eyebrows, and large eyes. His dedication to his studies had left a lasting impression on Lou Cheng.</p>\n<p>“Right? Who knew the Martial Arts Club orientation would be so dull?” Lou Cheng avoided mentioning the highlight of his day: Yan Zheke’s QQ number. Instead, he shifted the topic, “Qiang, what were you guys discussing just now?”</p>\n<p>Zhao Qiang replied thoughtfully, “Old Qiu and Model Worker found a phone number in the self-study room. It said the girls’ dorm was looking for a social meetup. I told them to ignore it and focus on studying.”</p>\n<p>Model Worker, the last member of the dorm, was Zhang Jingye. He hailed from the northwest and had a calm demeanor. Once handsome, his face bore the marks of harsh winds and sandstorms, making him less attractive than before.</p>\n<p>Zhang Jingye chimed in with a smile, “Was it because our dorm lacks suitable social meetup partners?”</p>\n<p>“Youth is a time of raging hormones. The honest ones, like Model Worker and Old Qiu, can’t always control themselves,” Zhao Qiang said, shaking his head with a sigh. He dropped his school bag and began organizing his books.</p>\n<p>With a calmness beyond his years, Lou Cheng processed the emotions stirred by the Jindan. “A girls’ dorm phone number in the study room? Could it be a prank or revenge? How could the girls’ dorm be looking for a social meetup like this? Aren’t you all worried about getting in trouble?”</p>\n<p>Every dorm room at Songcheng University had a landline, but they were becoming obsolete with the rise of cell phones.</p>\n<p>“I talked it over with Model Worker. That number matches the length of ours. It must belong to the girls’ dorm. We could just change the last few digits to call another girls’ dorm. No need to worry about pranks or revenge,” Qiu Zhigao said excitedly.</p>\n<p>Zhang Jingye nodded, adding, “Besides, girls might actually enjoy a random call asking for a social meetup. It feels like destiny, despite the distance.”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng thought for a moment and said, “Not bad, you’ve considered this well. Why not give it a try?”</p>\n<p>These two were clever!</p>\n<p>Zhang Jingye and Qiu Zhigao exchanged glances, excitement bubbling as they contemplated the idea of making a call and meeting new girls. It was impulsive, and the outcome was uncertain. How thrilling!</p>\n<p>“Old Qiu, you should do it,” Zhang Jingye suggested, pouting slightly.</p>\n<p>Old Qiu stepped forward but hesitated, fear creeping in. “Model Worker, maybe you should do it.”</p>\n<p>“Um, um…” Zhang Jingye also felt apprehensive.</p>\n<p>At that moment, Zhao Qiang, observing from the sidelines, shook his head. “You guys…”</p>\n<p>Everyone expected him to lecture them about the importance of studying and dismissing such youthful distractions. Instead, he dropped his school bag, glanced around, and approached Lou Cheng’s desk. He picked up the landline next to the door, muttering, “Our dorm number is 302. Let’s use that as our lucky number and take 32 as the last digits.”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng, Qiu Zhigao, and Zhang Jingye stood in shock as Zhao Qiang shot them a knowing look, as if to say, “Amateurs!”</p>\n<p>Once connected, Zhao Qiang beamed, his demeanor shifting to slightly obsequious.</p>\n<p>“Hello, this is from the boys’ dorm. We just dialed a random number from the girls’ dorm and were wondering if you’d be interested in a social meetup,” he said smoothly.</p>\n<p>“Ummm, we’re from the Computer Software College.”</p>\n<p>“We’re in Dorm 302, Unit 2 of the 7th Building, and we happened to dial 32 for the last numbers.”</p>\n<p>“Aren’t you from the Department of Chinese Language and Literature?”</p>\n<p>“Um, um, okay, you can ask…”</p>\n<p>“Um, um, um.”</p>\n<p>“Okay, okay…”</p>\n<p>Laughter from the girls echoed through the phone, reaching Lou Cheng and the others. Minutes passed before Zhao Qiang reluctantly hung up, turning to the group with a grin.</p>\n<p>“It’s settled! They’ve agreed. The girls from the Department of Chinese Language and Literature will meet us this Friday for dinner. If we hit it off, we can plan another social meetup next time.”</p>\n<p>“What do you think? Not bad, right?”</p>\n<p>Zhao Qiang noticed everyone staring at him in silence. He touched his face, puzzled. “Is there something on my face?”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng’s perception of Zhao Qiang had shifted entirely. He recalled a favorite comedy sketch and pretended to sigh in disapproval, shaking his head.</p>\n<p>“I never would have guessed you, Qiang, were a dashing wolf in sheep’s clothing all along!”</p>\n<p>At this, laughter erupted among them, including Zhao Qiang. He wagged his finger playfully, singing, “Even a wolf needs love! Even a wolf needs love! Even a wolf needs love!”</p>\n<p>The laughter subsided as they shifted their focus to the upcoming meeting on Friday. Even though it was still Monday, Zhao Qiang, Zhang Jingye, and Qiu Zhigao’s imaginations ran wild with possibilities.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng listened for a while, but then Yan Zheke’s image flashed in his mind. His mood shifted from playful to serene.</p>\n<p>Having feelings for one girl while considering meeting others… was that the right choice?</p>\n<p>“I don’t care what others think. I just don’t want to take it for granted…” After some thought, he said, “Qiang, I have something going on Friday. I need to go downtown, so I can’t join the social meetup this time.”</p>\n<p>“What’s happening?” Zhao Qiang asked, surprised.</p>\n<p>“Some family matters,” Lou Cheng lied, unsure if anyone would believe him.</p>\n<p>Zhao Qiang nodded without hesitation. “Fine. Can you check if Casanova is available? We need four people; otherwise, it’s a bit rude.”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng was taken aback by Zhao Qiang’s straightforwardness. It felt as if he had anticipated this all along. “Why do you want to ask Casanova?”</p>\n<p>Zhao Qiang glanced at Zhang Jingye and Qiu Zhigao, smiling. “You know we’re all pretty naive and clumsy when it comes to talking. In a social meetup, you need someone who can keep the conversation flowing. I thought of asking Casanova earlier, but five people seemed a bit much. Now that you’re out, it works out.”</p>\n<p>“Naive and clumsy… when it comes to talking…” Lou Cheng recalled Zhao Qiang’s earlier interactions with the girls and stared at him.</p>\n<p>“What’s wrong?” Zhao Qiang asked, puzzled.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng replied seriously, “Qiang, you’ve turned into a wolf again!”</p>\n<p>He stood up and headed to the next dorm to see if Cai Zongming had returned. The door was unlocked, and only one person was inside—Tang Wen, the youngest in the dorm, who had skipped a grade in high school. After his senior year, he became addicted to the internet, often playing games and skipping classes.</p>\n<p>“Tang Wen, has Casanova come back yet?” Lou Cheng inquired.</p>\n<p>Without turning around, Tang Wen replied, “No, no one’s back.”</p>\n<p>In Cai Zongming’s dorm were two other guys. Mou Yuanxing had entered Songcheng University with his high school girlfriend, drawing envy from all the single guys. He was often absent until lights out. The other, Qin Mo, came from a wealthy family and frequently snuck out to socialize, though he was friendly and got along with everyone.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng sighed, pulled out his cell phone, and walked to the courtyard of the 7th building. He squatted near the flower bed and dialed Cai Zongming’s number, lighting a cigarette.</p>\n<p>Some topics weren’t suitable for discussion in the dorm, so he opted for his cell phone.</p>\n<p>“Casanova, I need to talk to you,” Lou Cheng said directly once the call connected.</p>\n<p>There was noise on the other end, but soon Cai Zongming seemed to have moved to a quieter spot outside. He chuckled, “What’s up? Why the rush? We’re still enjoying hotpot.”</p>\n<p>“Qiang and the others randomly called a number and found a dorm from the Department of Chinese Language and Literature for a social meetup. They want you to join since you’re the Casanova and have the gift of gab, perfect for this situation,” Lou Cheng explained with a laugh.</p>\n<p>“Are you complimenting me or insulting me?” Cai Zongming grumbled. “That sounds fun. I’ll check it out, but isn’t five people a bit disrespectful to the girls?”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng paused, then said, “I’m not going.”</p>\n<p>“Oh, why not?” Cai Zongming asked, surprised.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng didn’t hide his reasoning. “It doesn’t feel right to go out for a social meetup with other girls when I have feelings for someone else.”</p>\n<p>“What?” Cai Zongming faltered. “Cheng, a social meetup isn’t a date. It’s just a chance to get to know each other, eat, drink, and expand your social circle. No one’s forcing you to date anyone. Even I, maintaining my chastity, don’t care that much. Plus, you and Yan Zheke barely know each other. You have a long way to go before thinking about being her boyfriend. Why all the fuss?”</p>\n<p>“Forget it. I just feel a bit guilty. I’m not going,” Lou Cheng decided firmly.</p>\n<p>Cai Zongming replied, “Cheng, are you a living antique? You could set up your own Chastity Memorial Archway!”</p>\n<p>“Say what you want.” Lou Cheng hung up, remaining seated. He continued to squat, smoking his cigarette, the ember flickering in the darkness, bringing a sense of tranquility.</p>\n<p>With a smile playing on his lips, Lou Cheng empathized with his roommates’ horndog antics. He felt their energy was contagious, making the whole situation amusing. He would have liked to join them if not for his feelings for Yan Zheke.</p>\n<p>This was college life—bustling and vibrant, yet filled with enough beauty to make a young heart soar. Meanwhile, the Jindan felt like a distant fantasy, unreal yet full of hope.</p>\n<p>“How will my life change after today? Will I impress Yan Zheke with my martial arts skills?”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng sat on the edge of the flower bed, extinguishing his cigarette. He took out his cell phone, logged into QQ, and clicked on Yan Zheke’s profile.</p>\n<p>The courtyard buzzed with students returning to their dorms, while the corner remained quiet and peaceful, as if they belonged to two different worlds.</p>",
