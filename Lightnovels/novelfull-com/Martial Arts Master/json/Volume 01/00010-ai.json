  "body": "<p>Geezer Shi's eyebrows shot upward as he squinted, slowly opening his eyes. In an instant, his dull gaze transformed into a cold, luminous silver. Deep within those eyes, Lou Cheng's reflection flickered.</p>\n<p>After a moment of hesitation, a frown crossed his face, and the strange color faded from his eyes. He clasped his hands behind his back and stepped away from Lou Cheng. A few steps later, he turned back for another glance before continuing his inspection, as if nothing unusual had occurred.</p>\n<p>The first still stance experience could be incredibly dull, often leading to physical fatigue and soreness in no time. As the clock struck one hour and a half, Geezer Shi glanced at his watch and cleared his throat.</p>\n<p>“Stop. The first still stance training is over.”</p>\n<p>To Lou Cheng, Geezer Shi's voice sounded almost heavenly, blurring the line between reality and illusion. Eventually, he broke free from the “remaining in one” state. The hustle and bustle of the world returned, flooding his senses and presenting a brand new reality.</p>\n<p>“Yin-Yang Stance is exhausting,” Cai Zongming complained, stretching his legs.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, but it’s also quite fascinating,” Lou Cheng replied, choosing not to admit that he could endure it indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Afterward, Geezer Shi instructed Chen Changhua to demonstrate a moving stance from their Martial Arts Club, explaining the skills and divided movements. He allotted them an hour for practice, allowing their bodies to stretch and adapt, naturally enhancing their coordination.</p>\n<p>Throughout the practice, Geezer Shi lounged in the ring, cigarette in hand. His complete relaxation was somewhat irritating.</p>\n<p>“Alright. Split into two groups. Those on my right will follow Chen Changhua to the Strength Training Gymnasium for muscle training. The rest on my left will practice footwork under Lin Que’s supervision. We’ll swap in 40 minutes,” he announced, jumping out of the ring and pointing at the middle of the group.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng and Cai Zongming, positioned on the right side of Geezer Shi, made their way toward the weight room with half of their peers.</p>\n<p>As Lou Cheng walked past Geezer Shi, his right foot stumbled. He felt a wave of cold sweat as he lost his balance, falling forward uncontrollably.</p>\n<p>In that moment, he sensed the subtle changes in his muscles. Like during meditation, he instinctively adjusted his weight. As one foot landed, he straightened his back, propelling himself forward. A few strides later, he regained his footing without drawing much attention.</p>\n<p>He glanced back, searching the crowd for any hint of what had just happened, but only encountered puzzled faces.</p>\n<p>“Cheng, are you alright?” Cai Zongming asked, concern etched on his face.</p>\n<p>“I’m fine. I’m not sure what just occurred,” Lou Cheng replied, shaking his head and dismissing the thought as he continued on.</p>\n<p>Among the crowd, Geezer Shi watched Lou Cheng's back, nodding thoughtfully while still holding his cigarette.</p>\n<p>In the Strength Training Gymnasium, Lou Cheng felt a wave of frustration. Despite the Jindan's aid, he struggled to lift the barbell.</p>\n<p>“It seems the Jindan only helps with fatigue and soreness, allowing me to sense subtle changes during meditation, improving my coordination and footwork. It doesn’t enhance my strength, speed, or agility…” he mused, recalling his near fall earlier. Determined, he pushed himself harder in strength training, utilizing the instant recovery and minimal fatigue benefits from the Elixir to boost his strength quickly. Cai Zongming watched in astonishment.</p>\n<p>At the end of the weight and footwork training, Lou Cheng, though rejuvenated by the Jindan, was drenched in sweat. He planned to catch up with Yan Zheke before showering with Cai Zongming. Just then, Chen Changhua stepped forward, addressing Geezer Shi before the martial arts lesson concluded.</p>\n<p>“Coach Shi, the Ranking Event is approaching, but I haven’t had enough practical exercise,” Chen Changhua said with a smile, glancing at Lin Que. “I’d like to challenge Lin Que. Please referee to prevent any injuries.”</p>\n<p>Gasps filled the room as many members of the Martial Arts Club reacted. Chen Changhua’s dissatisfaction with Lin Que had been evident during orientation, as the club couldn’t accommodate two champions. No one expected such a bold challenge so soon.</p>\n<p>“Why is he so confident?”</p>\n<p>“Has he already surpassed the rank difference and reached the Professional Ninth Pin level?”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng was equally surprised. He exchanged glances with Cai Zongming, then attempted to catch Yan Zheke's eye through the crowd.</p>\n<p>Cai Zongming clicked his tongue. “This guy isn’t foolish. He knows he needs to challenge Lin as soon as possible.”</p>\n<p>“What do you mean?” Lou Cheng asked, turning to Cai Zongming for clarification.</p>\n<p>“Before reaching the Danqi stage, height and strength are crucial in martial arts. With the right technique, an amateur of the second or third Pin can potentially pass the Professional Ranking Event and qualify for a Professional Ninth Pin certificate. In terms of overall strength, he can match the Professional Ninth Pin level,” Cai Zongming explained. “Lin Que is a genius who reached the Professional Ninth Pin at 18. Give him a few more months, and he’ll be even stronger. He may not reach the Danqi stage yet, but his progress will surely outpace that guy!”</p>\n<p>“So Chen Changhua is challenging Lin now, before their gap widens. He wants to defeat Lin and create a mental block to maintain his upper hand until graduation,” Lou Cheng realized.</p>\n<p>“A mental block? You’ve read too many novels,” Cai Zongming replied, glancing at Lou Cheng. “If Chen Changhua wins, it could connect his willpower and physical strength, pushing him to a higher level. He must be confident he’s reached the Professional Ninth Pin level to issue this challenge now.”</p>\n<p>As they debated, Geezer Shi turned to Lin Que, grinning. “Will you accept the challenge?”</p>\n<p>“Sure,” Lin Que replied coldly, his expression unchanged.</p>\n<p>Chen Changhua turned with a courteous smile and stepped into the ring, his demeanor shifting entirely, like a tiger ready to pounce.</p>\n<p>“The manager of the Martial Arts Club is undeniably skilled,” Lou Cheng thought, shifting his gaze to Lin Que.</p>\n<p>Lin wiped the sweat from his brow and casually approached the ring. His handsome, cool demeanor in the white suit drew everyone’s attention.</p>\n<p>Once in the ring, Lin Que maintained his composure. His feet resumed a T-step position, toes slightly inward, his face betraying no emotion toward Chen Changhua.</p>\n<p>As Geezer Shi approached to referee, Chen Changhua bowed with clasped hands. “Brother Lin, please guide me.”</p>\n<p>Being one rank lower, Chen made the first move, lunging at Lin Que like a striking snake.</p>\n<p>“The ape’s footwork isn’t bad,” Cai Zongming commented to Lou Cheng. Chen Changhua, known for his strength, displayed surprising agility, which explained his boldness in challenging Lin Que.</p>\n<p>Lin Que sidestepped Chen’s attack with his left foot, but as soon as it landed, Chen abruptly shifted tactics, charging at Lin with his shoulder and arm like a rampaging bull.</p>\n<p>Gasps erupted from the crowd, worry etched on their faces. Lou Cheng feared Lin Que might not withstand such a fierce strike.</p>\n<p>That was a move of the Professional Ninth Pin level!</p>\n<p>And it was Chen Changhua’s strength targeting Lin Que’s weak point!</p>\n<p>In that instant, Lin Que twisted his back, moving like a snake, pulling his left foot back just before it touched the ground to shift his weight to the right. Using his right foot as leverage, he spun behind Chen Changhua and struck with his left elbow.</p>\n<p>His earlier move had been a feint!</p>\n<p>Chen Changhua missed his target and felt a blow approaching from behind. With no choice, he dove forward, rolling to evade the elbow strike.</p>\n<p>As Chen attempted to spring up while rolling, Lin Que slid over, cracking his right foot like a whip. A sharp sound sliced through the air.</p>\n<p>Chen Changhua raised his palms defensively, but the impact forced him back half a meter, blood streaming from the split between his thumb and index finger.</p>\n<p>Lin pressed his advantage, unleashing a flurry of whip kicks at Chen’s lower legs, each strike connecting with a resounding crack.</p>\n<p>Chen Changhua was pushed out of the ring, his hands battered and bloodied.</p>\n<p>Lying on the ground, he appeared bewildered, disbelief etched on his face. He hadn’t even had a chance to utilize his well-honed throwing skills.</p>\n<p>A moment of stunned silence was followed by a thunderous cheer for the true champion in the hall.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng turned, spotting Yan Zheke cheering with excitement, her arms raised high.</p>\n<p>“Awesome! You’ve earned my respect. A Professional Ninth Pin martial artist is incredible,” Cai Zongming murmured to himself.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng turned away, a whirlwind of emotions swirling within him. Reflecting on the fight, a realization struck him.</p>\n<p>Lin Que’s clever move to secure victory was a practical application of the Yin-Yang Stance!</p>\n<p>He had experienced the essence of the Yin-Yang Stance firsthand: coordinating the entire body and wielding strength at will. Mastery of the Yin-Yang Stance would lead to the Danqi stage.</p>\n<p>Lin Que had clearly grasped it to some degree. His coordination and control were astonishing. Didn’t anyone else notice?</p>\n<p>He must be very close to the Danqi stage, the Professional Eighth Pin level…</p>\n<p>After nodding at Geezer Shi, Lin Que stepped down from the ring, not sparing a glance for Chen Changhua as he made his way to the locker room. Wu Dong, another amateur master and close friend of Chen, stepped forward to help him up.</p>\n<p>At lunchtime, Lou Cheng devoured his meal, consuming more than twice his usual portion. Cai Zongming and Qiu Zhigao were in the same boat. Intense training had drained their energy, and their bodies craved replenishment, despite a long rest until one pm.</p>\n<p>While waiting for his friends to finish, Lou Cheng logged onto his QQ account and began chatting with Yan Zheke. Their conversation lingered in his mind throughout the afternoon classes.</p>\n<p>“Lin Que is brilliant,” Lou Cheng typed.</p>\n<p>“Absolutely! I knew he would win, but I didn’t expect it to be so easy!” Yan Zheke replied, sending an emoji of a chick nodding.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng felt a twinge of jealousy. “When will I be able to fight like him…”</p>\n<p>Yan Zheke sent an emoji with gleaming white teeth. “Do you want to hear the truth or a lie?”</p>\n<p>“What’s the truth, and what’s the lie?” Lou Cheng asked, curiosity piqued.</p>\n<p>Yan Zheke sent a cute face. “The lie is that you have great potential to earn your Professional Ninth Pin certificate and reach Lin Que’s level by graduation if you train hard under Coach Shi every day, rain or shine.”</p>\n<p>“Ha, you think highly of me,” Lou Cheng replied with a shy emoji. “What about the truth?”</p>\n<p>Yan Zheke sent a laughing emoji. “The truth? You won’t stick to martial arts training for four years because classes and job pressures will consume all your time. Plus, a university graduate with a Professional Ninth Pin will be too old to enter the martial arts world. Everyone has their future. It doesn’t have to be martial arts.”</p>\n<p>“Everyone has their future. It doesn’t have to be martial arts…” Lou Cheng pondered these words, replaying them in his mind as he stared blankly at the class slides.</p>\n<p>Had he not taken the risk to obtain the Jindan, those words would have been his best annotation…</p>",
