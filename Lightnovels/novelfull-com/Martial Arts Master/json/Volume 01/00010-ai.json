Deep within those eyes, Lou Cheng's reflection flickered.</p>\n<p>After a moment of hesitation, a frown creased his brow, and the strange color faded from his eyes. He clasped his hands behind his back and stepped away from Lou Cheng. A few steps later, he turned back for another glance, then resumed his inspection as if nothing unusual had occurred.</p>\n<p>The first still stance experience could be dreadfully boring, often leading to physical fatigue and soreness in no time. As the clock ticked to one hour and a half, Geezer Shi glanced at his watch and cleared his throat.</p>\n<p>“Stop. The first still stance training is over.”</p>\n<p>To Lou Cheng, Geezer Shi's voice sounded almost celestial, blurring the line between reality and his perception. Eventually, he broke free from the “remaining in one” state. The hustle and bustle of the world returned, flooding his senses like a fresh wave.</p>\n<p>“Yin-Yang Stance is exhausting,” Cai Zongming complained, stretching his legs.</p>\n<p>“Yeah, but it’s also quite fascinating,” Lou Cheng replied, opting not to admit that he could endure it indefinitely.</p>\n<p>Afterward, Geezer Shi instructed Chen Changhua to demonstrate a moving stance from their Martial Arts Club, detailing the skills and divided movements. He allotted them an hour for practice, a chance to stretch and strengthen their bodies while naturally infusing coordination into their instincts.</p>\n<p>Throughout the practice, Geezer Shi lounged in the ring, smoking a cigarette. His complete relaxation was rather irritating.</p>\n<p>“Alright. Split into two groups. Those on my right will follow Chen Changhua to the Strength Training Gymnasium for muscle training. The rest on my left will practice footwork under Lin Que’s supervision. We’ll swap in 40 minutes,” he announced, jumping out of the ring and pointing at the middle of the group.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng and Cai Zongming, standing on the right side, headed toward the weight room with half their peers.</p>\n<p>As Lou Cheng walked past Geezer Shi, his right foot stumbled. He staggered forward, cold sweat breaking out as he felt himself falling face down.</p>\n<p>Yet, in that fleeting moment, he sensed the subtle changes in his muscles. Instinctively, he adjusted his weight mid-air, wiggling his muscles to regain balance.</p>\n<p>When one foot landed, he straightened his back slightly, propelling himself forward. A few strides later, he managed to stop on his feet, avoiding much laughter.</p>\n<p>He glanced back, searching the crowd for any hint of what had just happened, but only met with puzzled faces.</p>\n<p>“Cheng, are you alright?” Cai Zongming asked, concern etched on his face.</p>\n<p>“I’m fine. I have no idea what just happened,” Lou Cheng replied, shaking his head as he brushed off the incident and continued walking.</p>\n<p>Among the crowd, Geezer Shi held his cigarette, nodding thoughtfully at Lou Cheng’s retreating figure.</p>\n<p>In the Strength Training Gymnasium, Lou Cheng felt a wave of frustration. Even with the Jindan's help, he struggled to lift the barbell.</p>\n<p>“It seems the Jindan only helps with fatigue and soreness, enhancing my awareness of subtle changes during meditation. It doesn’t really boost my strength, speed, or agility…” he mused, recalling his near fall. He resolved to push harder in his strength training, utilizing the instant recovery and minimal fatigue benefits from the Elixir, striving to improve quickly. Cai Zongming watched in astonishment.</p>\n<p>After the weight and footwork training, Lou Cheng, though rejuvenated by the Jindan, was drenched in sweat. He planned to catch up with Yan Zheke before showering with Cai Zongming. Just then, Chen Changhua stepped forward, addressing Geezer Shi before the martial arts lesson concluded.</p>\n<p>“Coach Shi, the Ranking Event is approaching, but I haven’t had enough practical exercise,” Chen Changhua said, glancing at Lin Que. “I’d like to challenge Lin Que. Please referee to prevent injuries.”</p>\n<p>His words drew sharp intakes of breath from the Martial Arts Club members. Chen Changhua's discontent with Lin Que had been evident during orientation, but no one anticipated such a bold challenge so soon.</p>\n<p>“Why is he so confident?”</p>\n<p>“Has he already surpassed the rank difference and reached Professional Ninth Pin?”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng was equally surprised. He exchanged glances with Cai Zongming, trying to catch Yan Zheke's eye through the crowd.</p>\n<p>Cai Zongming clicked his tongue. “This ape isn’t foolish. He knows he needs to challenge Lin as soon as possible.”</p>\n<p>“What do you mean?” Lou Cheng asked, turning to Cai Zongming for clarification.</p>\n<p>“Before reaching the Danqi stage, height and strength are crucial in martial arts. With proper technique, an amateur of the second or third Pin can still qualify for the Professional Ninth Pin certificate. In terms of overall strength, he can match Professional Ninth Pin,” Cai Zongming explained. “Lin Que is a genius who reached that level at 18. Give him a few months, and he’ll be even stronger. He might not reach Danqi yet, but his progress will be significant!”</p>\n<p>“So, Chen Changhua is challenging Lin now, before their gap widens. He wants to defeat Lin and create a mental block to maintain his upper hand until graduation,” Lou Cheng realized.</p>\n<p>“Mental block? You’ve read too many novels,” Cai Zongming replied, glancing at Lou Cheng. “If Chen wins, it might connect his willpower and physical strength, pushing him to a higher level. He likely believes he’s reached Professional Ninth Pin or he wouldn’t be so bold.”</p>\n<p>As they debated, Geezer Shi turned to Lin Que with a grin. “Will you accept the challenge?”</p>\n<p>“Sure,” Lin Que replied coolly, his expression unchanged.</p>\n<p>Chen Changhua turned, offering a courteous smile as he strode into the ring. His demeanor shifted entirely, like a tiger sharpening its claws or a buffalo ready to charge.</p>\n<p>“The Martial Arts Club manager is undoubtedly skilled,” Lou Cheng thought, shifting his gaze to Lin Que.</p>\n<p>Lin wiped the sweat from his brow, casually approaching the ring. His striking appearance in a white suit drew all eyes.</p>\n<p>In the ring, Lin Que maintained his composure, adopting a T-step stance with his toes slightly inward, his face betraying no emotion toward Chen Changhua.</p>\n<p>As Geezer Shi took his place as referee, Chen Changhua bowed with clasped hands. “Brother Lin, please grant instructions.”</p>\n<p>Being a rank lower, Chen made the first move, lunging at Lin Que like a snake.</p>\n<p>“The ape’s footwork isn’t bad,” Cai Zongming remarked to Lou Cheng. Known for his strength, Chen Changhua’s agility surprised many. It was no wonder he dared to challenge Lin Que.</p>\n<p>Lin Que sidestepped Chen’s attack, but as soon as his left foot landed, Chen abruptly changed tactics, charging at Lin with his shoulder and arm like a wild bull.</p>\n<p>Gasps filled the air. The crowd held its breath, fearing for Lin Que. Lou Cheng doubted he could withstand such a blow without injury.</p>\n<p>That was a move of the Professional Ninth Pin level!</p>\n<p>And it was Chen Changhua’s strength but Lin Que’s weak point!</p>\n<p>In that moment, Lin Que twisted his back, moving like a snake. He pulled his left foot back before it fully touched the ground, shifting his weight to his right foot. Using it as a pivot, he spun behind Chen Changhua and struck with his left elbow.</p>\n<p>His earlier move had been a feint!</p>\n<p>Chen Changhua missed his target and felt a blow coming from behind. With no choice, he dove forward, rolling to evade the elbow strike.</p>\n<p>As Chen used his core to spring up, Lin Que slid over, cracking his right foot like a whip. A sharp sound echoed.</p>\n<p>Chen Changhua raised his palms to block the kick, but he was pushed back half a meter, blood streaming from the split between his thumb and index finger.</p>\n<p>Lin pressed his advantage, unleashing a series of whip kicks at Chen’s lower legs, each strike hitting Chen’s palms with a resounding crack.</p>\n<p>Chen Changhua was forced out of the ring, his hands battered and bloodied.</p>\n<p>Lying on the ground, confusion and disbelief clouded his expression. He hadn’t even had a chance to showcase his throwing skills.</p>\n<p>Silence enveloped the hall, followed by a thunderous cheer for the true champion.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng turned, spotting Yan Zheke cheering with excitement, her arms raised high.</p>\n<p>“Awesome! You’ve earned my respect. A Professional Ninth Pin martial artist is incredible,” Cai Zongming murmured.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng turned away, a whirlwind of emotions swirling within him. Reflecting on the fight, a realization struck him.</p>\n<p>Lin Que’s clever move to win was a practical application of Yin-Yang Stance!</p>\n<p>He had experienced the essence of Yin-Yang Stance firsthand: coordinating the entire body and wielding strength at will. Mastery of the Yin-Yang Stance would lead to the Danqi stage.</p>\n<p>Lin Que had clearly grasped it to some degree. His coordination and control were astonishing. Had no one else noticed?</p>\n<p>He must be very close to the Danqi stage, the Professional Eighth Pin level…</p>\n<p>After nodding at Geezer Shi, Lin Que exited the ring without a glance at Chen Changhua. Wu Dong, another amateur master and a close friend of Chen, stepped forward to help him up.</p>\n<p>At lunchtime, Lou Cheng devoured his meal, consuming more than twice his usual portion. Cai Zongming and Qiu Zhigao were in the same boat. Intense training had drained their energy, and their bodies craved a refill, despite a long rest until one pm to recover.</p>\n<p>While waiting for his friends to finish, Lou Cheng logged into his QQ account and began chatting with Yan Zheke. Their conversation lingered in his mind well into the afternoon classes.</p>\n<p>“Lin Que is brilliant,” Lou Cheng typed.</p>\n<p>“Very! I knew he would win, but I didn’t expect it to be so easy!” Yan Zheke replied, sending an emoji of a chick nodding.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng felt a twinge of</p>",
