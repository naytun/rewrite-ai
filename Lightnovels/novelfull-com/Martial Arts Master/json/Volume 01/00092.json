A noodle stall was set at the intersection of the road to the river levee and the street leading to the older residential communities.</p><p>The simple tables and chairs of the stall were toppled over in disorder. There were bowls, noodles, and chopsticks scattered everywhere, and an iron pot was lying upside down a dozen steps from the stall. A gray-haired stall keeper lay paralyzed behind the natural gas furnace trembling with fear in his eyes. There was a hideous, eyeless, corpse that was covered in p*ss and sh*t lying on the ground not far from him. In addition, there were two hatchet men curled up and clutching at different parts of their body respectively. The two men were either moaning softly or unconscious, with their lives, swiftly slipping from their grasp. The surrounding area was bathed in blood and urine.</p><p>Three men were lying on the wet ground at the other end of the street more than twenty meters away. One man was curled up on his side with burn marks all over his neck and behind his ears. His neck was twisted abnormally. The second man was in black exercise clothes and bleeding out of every facial orifice while reeking of his own excrement. The third person, Wang Xu, was curled up and trembling. His pistol had been tossed aside and had become covered with mud, glimmering in the soft light.</p><p>In the midst of this hellish scene, there was a boy in a white martial arts suit that was bordered in black. He was closer to a man than an immature boy. While panting slightly, he stood straight and erected with a confused expression on his face.</p><p>Four police cars came, carrying a dozen police officers who were led by Chief Xing. When they arrived, what they saw was a picture scroll covered in a little bit of blood, terror, and strangeness.</p><p>What Qin Rui saw was terrifying and he couldn’t believe his eyes!</p><p>Honestly, after seeing that the man in the black exercise clothes had been able to maul and kill with only one blow heavily, Qin Rui was so frightened he began to tremble.</p><p>I have seen some Professional Ninth Pin matches, broadcasts of preliminaries and various Video Highlights before. So, it is not a secret that someone can make these precise blows to the body achieving this level of damage. However, this only happens in the arena, with restrictions, and where the referees can call a timeout. It’s quite different from this situation where life or death can be decided with one blow.</p><p>Within several moves, as a professional Ninth Pin, the man in the black exercise clothes perfectly displayed the competence of observation, reaction, willpower, resolution, and improvisation. He also reflected the other aspects of martial arts, such as cruelty, misery, bloodiness, and terror. He gave Qin Rui an unforgettable impression. He was like a ‘demon’ from the dark that made him lose all the courage and confidence to fight against him. The only thing I could do was fear and tremble.</p><p>Fortunately, this formidable fighter, this horrible ‘demon’ was dead instantly. However, he didn’t die from firearms or lethal weapons, but he was beaten to death by another fighter!</p><p>The one who beat him was my high school mate, Lou Cheng! We had just met just a few days ago.</p><p>The one who was reputed after only practicing martial arts for six months!</p><p>The one who always acted in a very gentle and kind manner.</p><p>The one who used to lend his homework to me so I could copy. He was unable to fight during that time.</p><p>The one who was funny at the school reunion party and always talked of his martial arts competency in a joking tone.</p><p>He was not joking…</p><p>This may have been the greatest shock and astonishment for Qin Rui in his 19 years of life, and it made him bend down and hunch his neck. He was struck dumb while next to the window. Reflected in his eyes from the window was the boy wearing a white martial arts suit that was bordered in black.</p><p>“D*mn it,” Qin Rui thought, “I just remembered that I asked him to show me a few moves, and now, here they are!”</p><p>Within several moves, the ‘demon’ was killed!</p><p>…</p><p>“Lou Cheng…”</p><p>Tao Xiaofei almost glued his face to the car window to try and make out the looks of the shadow. However, no matter the angle, he was always too far in the backseat.</p><p>The man in the black exercise clothes gave him a great fright and he almost p*ssed himself. The urge was so great that he wanted to urinate in the car. Tao Xiaofei could see the scene of eyes bursting out of heads, brutal images flashing before him. The sounds of misery were echoing when someone’s penis was hit. He felt that it should be reaching the limits of the human body and yet it seemed to be completely invincible.</p><p>However, at this time, the invincible man was lying on the ground, just like a monument that was strongly cracked by ‘someone’.</p><p>He knew this ‘someone’ though he had never thought…</p><p>“Has he been hiding his skills from the high school?” Tao Xiaofei muttered to himself uncontrollably and completely forgot that there was a charming beauty beside him.</p><p>“Fortunately, I never offended him … Fortunately, I didn’t agree with the proposal which Brother Feng provided him with… ”</p><p>“It’s not reasonable, what is the advantage of hiding these skills? People who can do martial arts are everywhere. Hiding for what? Showing it off and getting some compliments is better, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Oh my gosh, would everyone show such great improvement if they quit smoking and drinking? How f*cking dare I frown on him at that time!”</p><p>“Maybe there is some possibility to save our relationship?”</p><p>Thoughts would remain thoughts, at this time, Tao Xiaofei Wouldn’t dare get out of the car and try to get close enough to greet Lou Cheng. He felt that if Lou Cheng even glanced at him he would p*ss his pants, really…</p><p>…</p><p>Dai Linfeng and other ancient mountain martial arts disciples were all shocked, but not as shocked as Qin Rui and Tao Xiaofei who were classmates with Lou Cheng for three years. After all, they simply didn’t know what he was like before.</p><p>But still, they were all so deeply shocked. This Mighty one, the man in the black sweat suit, was majestic-looking and even looked like he could kill all of them just a moment ago. However, he was soon beaten to death by Lou Cheng.</p><p>There was a contrast, there was a distinction!</p><p>At this moment, the same idea came into Dai Linfeng and the others’ mind:</p><p>He is invincible to the Dan stage!</p><p>Fortunately, Qin Rui wouldn’t be dragged down by bungling Tao Xiaofei to clash with this expert who is invincible to the core with Qi state…</p><p>Damn it! How lucky Mingwei Martial Arts School was! They unexpectedly had an emergency just to avoid competing with Lou Cheng!</p><p>…</p><p>A cold wind was blowing, carrying the scent of blood, Xing Chengwu (Director Xing) looked at Lou Cheng who was among the wounded or dead. Standing there Lou Cheng looked like a crane among a flock of chickens. Xing Chengwu was stunned for a while but soon shook off the stupor. He waved his hands and said to his subordinates who were prepared to shoot, “Don’t be nervous, he’s one of us. You, quickly preserve the scene and see if anyone is still alive, you can rescue the injured while cooperating with the coming ambulances.”</p><p>Before departing, the experienced director knew that if anything had happened, there would be several injuries. So, he directly contacted the hospital to ask for some ambulances to arrive at the same time. Running empty was better than wasting valuable saving time!</p><p>After he finished giving orders, Director Xing looked at Lou Cheng who was still standing stunned. The Director quickly came up to him and then said clearly,</p><p>“Lou Cheng, What happened? Are you OK?”</p><p>“Director Xing, I, I was angry, so, I didn’t hold back during the fight.” Lou Cheng had come around a little bit and then quickly explained, “I only hit him, and he hit others.”</p><p>Director Xing replied with ‘hum’ and turned around to the senior officers and subordinates, to whom he said, “Arrange people to record confessions from the witnesses. Look for more witnesses.”</p><p>“This is Lou Cheng, the one who called the police today. After receiving some information, he called me through an elder. Because of time constraints, he was nearby so I entrusted him to come to see whether or not he could save some lives. Haha, he is really a good Samaritan student that is also strong.”</p><p>“Entrustment? When did Director Xing entrust me?” he thought to himself. Lou Cheng was confused for a while, but intelligently, he didn’t say a word to refute the claim.</p><p>Director Xing issued orders, one by one, and arranged everything in an orderly manner. When he saw the ambulances arrive at the scene, he told a policewoman, “Anyway, there are some procedures we still have to go through. You record Lou Cheng’s confession, and we can’t show him favoritism. Strictly follow the rules.”</p><p>When director Xing wouldn’t notice, the policewomen twitched her mouth. “You have said that we ‘can’t’ show any favoritism, which means, we must show some favoritism. Only you have said he is a good student.”</p><p>Besides, if you really want to follow the procedures, they all need to be brought back to the police station for their confessions.</p><p>“Oh, this is my cell phone, you can check the record and prove that Lou Cheng called me through an elder, as I have said I communicated with him.” Director Xing tossed over his phone.</p><p>The policewomen caught the phone as she said to Lou Cheng, “Lou Cheng, we can go to the car for recording.”</p><p>Lou Cheng nodded his head and followed her silently to the police car. He was feeling quite depressed.</p><p>I killed someone…</p><p>I ended a life…</p><p>This feeling has me really mixed…</p><p>However, the shock of killing a man by his own hands was neutralized by the man in the black exercise clothes who had made these bloody scenes. It was diluted even more by the shadows who were rolling around with their eyes bursting out and hands covering their private parts. This made him feel chivalrous and he didn’t feel as guilty. The psychological shadow wasn’t that much anymore.</p><p>“Uh … Wang Xu … ” Lou Cheng seemed to finally sober up and turned to look at Wang Xu who was being carried to the ambulance.</p><p>Wang Xu was confined by handcuffs and his eyes were unfocused. He looked like a frightened joey and was trembling ceaselessly.</p><p>“Witnessing the scene just now, I think he would become a coward. Whether there is more trauma is also hard to say, but after that, he’ll certainly not want to fight again. That’s good, at least he can resume a normal life after being released from prison and is no longer involving himself in underworld things. Ah, the burns are concentrated on the back so that they wouldn’t disfigure him.” Noticing Lou Cheng’s attention, Director Xing said with a smile.</p><p>Obviously, no boss will want to have a hatch man who can’t fight.</p><p>“That’s good…” Lou Cheng repeated this sentence and took a deep breath on the way to the police car. Where he underwent the policewoman’s inquiry. This included his name, age, school, and other personal information, including all of the things that had happened through the day. He answered everything honestly, only omitting one thing and adding one sentence.</p><p>What he left out was his relationship with Wang Xu. He described Wang Xu as an ordinary childhood friend and explained that they hadn’t seen each other for about three years. Recently, though, they had met on two occasions and he let Wang Xu know that his master was a Mighty One with a physical invulnerability. What he added was that Director Xing entrusted him.</p><p>Once he was able to think clearly, he was able to comprehend the intentions of Director Xing. Of course, the fear, fright, and melancholy, mixed with other emotions, were also coming one after another, and he felt quite conflicted.</p><p>I shouldn’t be so impulsive in the future. I almost died here today and hovered between life and death twice!</p><p>If he had known more about me, I would have been beaten by him. If that had happened, my righteous ardor would have died, my chasing love with all my heart would have died, the splendid future I’ve long dreamed of would have died. What would be left is just a lonely grave to tell my regretful story.</p><p>“Why am I here? What’s wrong with a one night stand here? Not allowed? Won’t allow us to have car sex?” At this time, he heard a familiar voice.</p><p>Turning around, Lou Cheng was surprized to see that Tao Xiaofei, Qin Rui, Dai Linfeng and the others were there.</p><p>What a coincidence!</p><p>No…</p><p>At second thought, Lou Cheng held back the impulse to ask and pretended not to see or hear anything. “Maybe I can ask them through the QQ or mobile phone. Now it is not the time if I’m to avoid trouble.”</p><p>With his keen perception, Lou Cheng noticed that Tao Xiaofei was slightly nervous and feeling panicked. However, no matter who witnessed that scene, it was strange for a normal man not to feel panic or nervous. As for coming out from the bar and having car sex in the early morning, this was his style. But, Dai Linfeng, Qin Rui and the other people’s explanations were quite far-fetched. They said that after receiving Tao Xiaofei’s call, they came here to meet him and after he finished having sex, they would all eat breakfast together.</p><p>However, the police that was questioning the people from Gushan Martial Arts School seemed to have a good relationship with Dai Linfeng. He didn’t care. They were just passersby and so far, there were no signs that they were involved with this case or got in touch with anyone involved in this case. So, after checking their communication records, doing confessions and taking down their contact information, the police didn’t want to waste their time and asked them to leave.</p><p>After finishing the transcripts, the policewomen asked to see the stall keeper’s confession. She asked some more questions of Tao Xiaofei, Qin Rui, Dai Linfeng and the others after getting them out of the car and questioning them face to face. Then she talked to her colleagues for a while who were investigating the scene and examining the body. After that, she went back to her original place and said to Lou Cheng,</p><p>“Lou Cheng, you can leave.”</p><p>“I can leave?” Lou Cheng was surprised.</p><p>“Anyhow, a man was killed by me and I can leave so easily?” he thought.</p><p>He was ready to go to the police station for half a day or even two full days.</p><p>The policewoman looked up at him and casually said, “Yes, you can leave, if you want some ‘courageous’ or ‘chivalrous’ bonus, you can call us, and we’ll help you apply.”</p><p>“Uh… ” Lou Cheng felt a little bit speechless. He was happy to hear that he didn’t need to go to the police station. He didn’t want to talk anymore so he went up to Director Xing and with a tentative smile said, “Thank you, Director Xing.”</p><p>“Don’t mention it, call me uncle Xing, and that’s fine. A great master produces a brilliant disciple!” Director Xing said with a thumbs-up, “Go back home, do some adjustments, don’t leave any trauma untended, and don’t worry about the follow-up things. Your master found me through the provincial department.”</p><p>Along the way home, Lou Cheng didn’t rush. His thoughts were diverging and he couldn’t concentrate.</p><p>Suddenly, he heard a horn blaring. He turned around and saw that Tao Xiaofei had parked his BMW 7-series next to him. Tao Xiaofei got out and said with a little nervous but respectful voice,</p><p>“Lou Cheng, uh, my dear brother, I’ll take you back home.”</p><p>Through the car window, Lou Cheng saw Qin Rui and Dai Linfeng.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
