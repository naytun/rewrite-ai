He could no longer remain calm and free from arrogance and rashness as he did in training.</p><p>“Casanova, what clothes should I wear?” he asked with modesty.</p><p>Cai Zongming crossed his arms in front of his chest and answered with his nose in the air. “Now you come to me! Would you dare to go in your martial arts suit!”</p><p>Before Lou Cheng reached out his hands to Cai Zongming’s neck, he continued. “This afternoon we are to boat. Jeans or slacks would be good. Ordinary looking men with the average disposition like Qiang, Model Worker and Old Qiu best go for some light colors to look clean and vigorous. You used to be one of them but, whatever has happened to you in the Martial Arts Club lately, you have somehow gained a deep and mysterious temperament. You can probably handle some dark clothes. Hmm… The black leisure shirt will do just fine with your brown leather jacket. Looking sharp! Hey! Don’t tuck your shirt in. And don’t zip up unless you want to look old-fashioned.”</p><p>Following Little Ming’s instruction, Lou Cheng got changed. Checking in the mirror, he seemed quite pleased with this gentlemanly and spirited look. Zhao Qiang, Qiu Zhigao and Zhang Jingye were all styled by Cai Zongming clean and vigorous but in different ways, so they wouldn’t be mistaken as wearing the same outfit for work.</p><p>Well prepared, the boys left the dorm for the meetup following Cai Zongming, feeling excited but also nervous.</p><p>“Talker, what should I do later?” Lou Cheng lowered his voice to Cai Zongming as soon as he caught up with him.</p><p>Cai Zongming smiled. “Act like a generous gallant. No flinch for the real man! Your goddess doesn’t know Guo Qing’s roommates much. And we are total strangers to her. In a strange new environment, by instinct, she will stay close to an acquaintance. Guo Qing’s eyes will be fixed on Old Qiu, which gives you a great opportunity to stay with her and talk to her like what you guys have been doing on QQ. I can guarantee she won’t give you cold shoulders. More details? It’s hard to teach. Do your best and be a generous gallant!”</p><p>“Talk to her like on QQ? Damn… I can’t do it without emojis…” Lou Cheng heaved a sigh.</p><p>“In that case, keep her amused whenever you don’t know what to say. Humor is always a good quality for boys but do not get vulgar or dirty. Not yet before you are close enough.” Cai Zongming patted Lou Cheng’s shoulder. “Stay calm. Relax. I don’t have high expectation for you. It doesn’t matter if you lose; just take it as a lesson.”</p><p>Lou Cheng took a glance at him with contempt. His irony words did cut the tension.</p><p>The east gate of the university was selected as the meeting point. After a ten-minute wait, the boys saw five girls coming. Lou Cheng spotted Yan Zheke immediately and completely ignored the others.</p><p>Instead of a dress, she wore a pair of light-colored jeans, white shoes, a simple white t-shirt decorated with glittering flowers on the chest and a light green jacket for their afternoon rowing. She left her hair down with no bangs, delicate, vivacious and pure.</p><p>“Only the true beauty dare to show her forehead,” chuckled Cai Zongming.</p><p>Zhao Qiang, Qiu Zhigao and Zhang Jingye also noticed Yan Zheke first. She stood out easily whatever crowd she was in.</p><p>With their mouth slightly open, they turned to Lou Cheng in surprise. They knew a schoolmate of Lou Cheng would join this meetup but apparently, they didn’t expect such a beauty.</p><p>Walking next to her, their beautiful muse Zhuang Xiaojun paled into insignificance.</p><p>“Cheng…” Zhao Qiang shouted.</p><p>“Ahh?” Lou Cheng looked at him blankly.</p><p>Zhao Qiang conveyed an impression of both grief and evasion. “I get it now. The quiet dog can bite! Did you call me a traitor? You are the real one!”</p><p>His words were responded by jeers from the boys. Lou Cheng flushed.</p><p>As the five girls got close, Lou Cheng chanted silently.</p><p>“I’m a gallant. I’m generous. No flinch!”</p><p>He stepped forward to welcome Yan Zheke with a well-practiced smile. “I thought all girls would be late for their date. You are early! Thank goodness we are even earlier.”</p><p>Yan Zheke appeared very comfortable and relaxed seeing an acquaintance. She pointed at Guo Qing and chuckled. “Guo Qing is known for being resolute and vigorous. She dragged us and we are here now. She even washed her hair for this meetup.”</p><p>Girls laughed in their sleeve. A short girl added, “Yeah. Washing hair means she highly values this date.”</p><p>Although open and frank, Guo Qing felt shy. She quickly interrupted to introduce. “This is Zhuang Xiaojun. That little bitch is Pan Xue. And this one is You Fangfang.”</p><p>Lou Cheng glanced over. Wearing glasses, Zhuang Xiaojun had delicate features, refined and cultured. Pan Xue wore a full fringe, chubby but adorable. You Fangfang had dark skin and black-framed glasses, not far from being scary.</p><p>Lou Cheng nodded and greeted before introducing his roommates to Yan Zheke.</p><p>“That man with pomaded hair and powdered face is Cai Zongming, the Talker and Casanova I mentioned to you before. This one with thick eyebrows and big eyes is Zhao Qiang, the head of our dorm. I know he looks serious but this social meetup is his idea. And this is Zhang Jingye, the Model Worker and Qiu Zhigao, the Old Qiu. Affable and honest, they are suffering a spring fever.”</p><p>The brief introduction scenting the approach of a jest made girls laugh. The boys felt a bit embarrassed but more amused. The atmosphere was enlivened instantly.</p><p>Yan Zheke hid her laugh with her hand and spoke quietly to Lou Cheng. “Aren’t you afraid of their revenge?”</p><p>“Don’t worry. I’m upright and honest with no evidence to be blackmailed.” Lou Cheng straightened his back to look upstanding. Cai Zongming gave him a thumb-up and commented with his lips, “Cheng, good work!”</p><p>The boys took turns to make fun of Lou Cheng, making the atmosphere more amicable. The jokes were proper and harmless as they knew when to stop and what would damage their image in front of the girls.</p><p>Lou Cheng noticed a cute black bag on Yan Zheke’s back and a white paper bag in her hand. He couldn’t quite figure out what was inside.</p><p>He took a deep breath and pointed at the white bag. “Let me help you with it. I don’t want to be an example of how not gentlemanly Chinese men are on the Internet.”</p><p>Yan Zheke listened his frank but humorous words and put on a half-smile. “Sure, gentleman Cheng.”</p><p>“Yes!” Lou Cheng cried out in his mind. He took over the white bag and continued to joke along with his eyes squinted. “Wait a minute. Nowadays, ‘gentleman’ is just another word for pervert. I’m so righteous…”</p><p>The girls were again entertained by his laughing at himself. Cai Zongming signaled at the other three boys to help with girls’ bags. He took care of You Fangfang’s.</p><p>They talked and laughed for a few more minutes before the three taxis they had booked arrived at the east gate.</p><p>Cai Zongming had taught Lou Cheng how to seat the group. Lou Cheng stood on his mettle and pulled Qiu Zhigao over. “Old Qiu, share a car with me.”</p><p>In the meantime, he tipped Yan Zheke with a wink.</p><p>Yan Zheke got it at once and grabbed Guo Qing’s arm. “Qing, we also take that car.”</p><p>Other people started to jeer, leaving Old Qiu no chance to say no. He got in the back of the car first.</p><p>Lou Cheng, remembering he was a generous gallant, took the front seat. Yan Zheke squeezed Guo Qing into the back before seating herself behind the front seat.</p><p>The engine started and the car set off. Lou Cheng didn’t care how the rest of the group would seat. He looked for topics to chat for the ride while writing an SMS to Yan Zheke: “Old Qiu and Guo Qing are both big. Poor you, packed in the back.”</p><p>Yan Zheke felt a vibration and took her mobile out. A smile climbed on her face. She took part in the conversation while secretly replying. “Sigh. Fortunately, I’m pretty slim. I’ll suck it up for Qing’s happiness! Outgoing and straightforward as her, she can barely talk today. She wouldn’t be in this car if I didn’t give her a push.”</p><p>Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke played as a team in finding topics for Qiu Zhigao and Guo Qing to chat with each other whereas talking with each other on QQ sneakily. The taste of sharing a secret made Lou Cheng believe that the distance between Yan Zheke and him had been shortened.</p><p>If only the journey could be longer. The group of ten arrived at Zhaoshan Lake in just over half an hour. They rented five two-person rowing boats with orange life jackets. The girls deposited their bags in the checkroom.</p><p>Cai Zongming took control happily to assign boats. “Since it is a social meetup, girls and boys must cooperate. Let’s see which group can reach the island in the lake first. Old Qiu, you and Guo Qing are group one.”</p><p>“Err… We are both strong. It’s not fair for you guys…” Old Qiu put up his deathbed struggle. To be fair, Guo Qing was not bad-looking, although her body was rather sturdy.</p><p>“You are a rough man who never boated before. Your strength will probably cancel off Guo Qing’s effort. Besides, she’s a good swimmer and can save you from drowning…” Cai Zongming made up excuses, supported by the other girls. Old Qiu finally gave in.</p><p>Cai Zongming continued. “Lou Cheng, you and Yan Zheke came from the same high school. You’ll be group two. Model Worker, you are a big man from the northwest, perfect to help out our petite Pan Xue. Qiang, you scholar share a boat with Zhuang Xiaojun. You Fangfang, you and I will beat all of them!”</p><p>On this kind of meetup occasions, many couldn’t make up their mind and would happily go with the flow while some had ideas but were too shy to share with others. A bold man could easily step out to assume control of the situation like Cai Zongming here. He divided the group into five teams and no one had much to complain.</p><p>Cai Zongming gently patted Lou Cheng’s shoulder and whispered in his ear.</p><p>“Cheng, I’ve done my best to help you!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
