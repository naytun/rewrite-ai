It was the real inner peace. He used to struggle with his daily training and was close to giving up, were it not for his perseverance. When his effort was paid back with progress, his mind grew firmer and stronger but still he was hoping for quick success. He was doing this to reach the Professional Ninth Pin level within two years, to win Yan Zheke’s heart, and to build a bright future.</p><p>Such eagerness could be the drive for his hardcore training in a short term. However, once he fell on a setback or his improvement didn’t meet his expectation, dismay and gloominess would return double to wound his heart and bring unpredictable consequences.</p><p>An old saying taught the ordinary to guard against pride and haste. He had nothing to be arrogant or audacious for but his heart was filled with conceit and impetuosity.</p><p>A calm mind created peace. Lou Cheng gradually integrated training into his daily life. Gentle and composed yet determined, even his temperament became quite different. Amazed by his changes, Cai Zongming often teased. “Was Cheng played by the casting couch? How come his entire temperament is different now?”</p><p>In front of his banter, Lou Cheng calmly responded. “Come here and I’ll kick your ass.”</p><p>Two weeks flew by and Lou Cheng felt his Yin-Yang Stance, Thunder and Fire Stance and Condensation Stance had broken through a difficult point and entered a brand new level. The coordination of his body was smoother, his explosive force within two to three bouts was significantly greater, his concentration and calmness during combat practice were improved, and he even perfected his near-sighted eyes to feel the gaze of others.</p><p>When another Saturday morning training came close to the end at twelve o’clock, Li Mao wiped the smile off his face and spoke with solemnity.</p><p>“Cheng, one last round.”</p><p>Lou Cheng got ready for his senior brother in sophomore year to grant feint training after a gentle nod.</p><p>Different from the direct attack on the vital part two weeks ago, Li Mao approached Lou Cheng from the left in one smooth step. His right hand in the form of a palm blade swung at Cheng’s neck at an angle.</p><p>Lou Cheng raised his left arm in a leisurely manner and blocked Li Mao’s palm. Before Lou Cheng could retaliate, Li Mao took another smooth step and moved to behind him.</p><p>As soon as Li Mao’s foot touched the floor, Lou Cheng suddenly plucked back with his leg as if he had been waiting for this move.</p><p>“Excellent!” Li Mao praised while taking another step to dodge this kick. he moved swiftly around Lou Cheng like a dragon and dealt a series of strikes.</p><p>At this point, Lou Cheng no longer needed studious intent to remain between the focusing on one status and equilibrium. He was watching his rival with close attention while keeping his head cool to make quick moves upon Li Mao’s attacks. His body was guarded securely with ease despite Li Mao’s Swimming Body Palm strikes.</p><p>After a few bouts into the match, Li Mao’s footwork changed all of a sudden. He approached Lou Cheng abruptly and threw a blast punch after a stride forward. His punch went with great power as if it could break a mountain open, sending out the sound of wind.</p><p>Lou Cheng turned sideways to avoid frontal confrontation. However, Li Mao already had one foot ready to plant between Lou Cheng’s legs, which could be used as the fulcrum for his throwing techniques and doubled as a restriction on Cheng’s footwork. It would be difficult for Lou Cheng to pull strength without falling.</p><p>Seeing this situation, hundreds of ideas and possible counterattack moves flashed across Lou Cheng’s mind but he made up his mind instantly with no hesitation. Li Mao took one step forward, and Lou Cheng fell back one step as well. As Li Mao advanced step, another one Lou Cheng drew back.</p><p>One advanced while the other retreated. The distance between the pair remained pretty much the same as they moved in the form of dance.</p><p>Li Mao breathed out and quit advancing. He resumed his sliding steps to force his way up close. As forces traveled up from his feet to pull his waist and back, Li Mao punched quickly with both hands in turn.</p><p>Lou Cheng felt under a fierce storm and he could collapse at any second. He knew he could spare no effort but he didn’t lose head. Fists, elbows and arms, he blocked with them in turns rhythmically while keeping his footwork under perfect control and holding his body in the status where he could comfortably exert force.</p><p>Under this kind of attack, losing control over the footwork or being unable to exert force would soon lead to defeat.</p><p>A series of blast punches were dealt with growls and roars. Lou Cheng struggled but fought on. When he lost the sense of time and felt reaching his utmost limit, the sheer pressure suddenly vanished as Li Mao drew back.</p><p>He looked up with an expression of vacancy, seeing Li Mao shake his head with a soft chuckle.</p><p>“Time is up. Coach has blown the whistle. So this is a tie for the first time.”</p><p>Lou Cheng breathed a sigh of relief and started to feel sore in his hands. He shook it off and gently smiled. “Thank you, brother, for your mercy.”</p><p>He was not being modest but speaking the truth. That was a pair exercise so that Li Mao had been holding back and was mainly providing feint training.</p><p>“That’s not the case. I wouldn’t believe you were the same Lou Cheng if I hadn’t practiced with you for the last two weeks and experienced your progress daily,” said Li Mao with a tinge of emotion. “Two weeks ago you were a mere beginner with barely any fighting experience, slow, weak and obtuse. Look at you now. You are proficient in basic moves.”</p><p>“Proficient in basic moves…” Lou Cheng reflected on those words and felt joy deep in his heart.</p><p>“The comment ‘proficient in basic moves’, however low it sounds, is actually part of the standard for the Amateur Ninth Pin level,” said Li Mao with a gentle smile.</p><p>“Brother, you mean I have reached the Amateur Ninth Pin level?” asked Lou Cheng in shock.</p><p>“It hasn’t even been three weeks and I’m already at the level of Amateur Ninth Pin?”</p><p>Li Mao nodded his head. “Being proficient in basic moves means that you can use right moves in combat without messing your footwork, which is enough to help you defeat over 90% of guys who fight merely at will. So, of course, you are at the Amateur Ninth Pin level. He-heh. However, not all martial artists of Amateur Ninth Pin are proficient in basic moves. Some of them win by significant physical superiority during the Ranking Event. They take strikes without actually hurting their body but their fist can easily knock the rival out. For them, getting proficient in martial arts moves and skills seems less important.</p><p>“Here I’ll have to repeat myself. If I didn’t have combat practice with you these days, I would have called my girlfriend to see this miracle. Do you know how long it took me to reach the Amateur Ninth Pin? I started my martial arts training at the age of ten and I didn’t pass the ranking event until 15. Well, I didn’t practice every day but, hey, five years! And how long did it take you? Three weeks!”</p><p>Lou Cheng didn’t revel but put on a gentle smile. “This is not the same. Most people pick up martial arts in their formative years. Their strength and physical fitness develop slowly over time and it does take them years to reach adult level. I’m already a grownup and my body has fully developed.”</p><p>“That’s true. But still, you are very talented. What a pity that you missed your best time to learn martial arts!” Li Mao felt sorry for Cheng. He tapped on Cheng’s shoulder before making his way to the locker room.</p><p>Looking at his back, Lou Cheng reflected on the joy in his heart.</p><p>“Only three weeks and I’m at the Amateur Ninth Pin level. Where will I be by the next school term? That’s a bit far from now. Right now my noticeably improved abilities, such as explosive force, calmness, concentration, and body coordination, in particular, are not yet fully integrated into my moves and footwork. There seems to be a vague barrier there blocking. Once this barrier is removed and all become one, which Amateur Pin will I be?”</p><p>Going through this in his head, Lou Cheng quickly picked up his pace to catch up with Yan Zheke and Guo Qing on their way to the locker room.</p><p>“What a beautiful day! God must love us!” said Lou Cheng cheerily.</p><p>Taking into consideration everyone’s schedule, the social meetup was set for this afternoon. They would gather at 1:30 p.m., spend the afternoon boating and picnicking at Zhaoshan Lake, and have a nice meal together afterward. As Lou Cheng, Yan Zheke and Guo Qing had to get up early the next morning for the special training, evening karaoke was not in their plan.</p><p>Yan Zheke wore her hair in a ponytail, cute and energetic. “I’ve always been pretty lucky with the sun. It never rained on my picnic day all these years. You’d better be grateful!”</p><p>Lou Cheng attempted to show his gratitude by asking her out for a meal or buying her some snacks, but Guo Qing ran out of patience and interrupted, “You will see each other soon. What’s the rush? You boys are easy. Just another day out. We must get ready and have our hair washed.”</p><p>Lou Cheng’s face was burning a bit. He laughed awkwardly. “I’m going to shower and change. See you this afternoon, then.”</p><p>“See you,” Yan Zheke waved at him with a smile.</p><p>Keeping his head from turning back, Lou Cheng went straight into the locker room and sighed quietly.</p><p>The relationship between Yan Zheke and him had got better through chatting, greeting, joking and the natural bond between schoolmates. She even began to call him Cheng. However, something seemed missing. Something was preventing them from taking one step further. They were too polite to each other as if a pair of good friends sharing the same study desk in a high school classroom.</p><p>What would be the next step?</p><p>Lou Cheng went back to the dorm after taking a shower and having lunch. Zhao Qiang, Zhang Jingye and Qiu Zhigao were all busy picking their finest outfit for the afternoon with Cai Zongming’s help.</p><p>“Who could have guessed you are more than just a talker!” Lou Cheng teased.</p><p>Cai Zongming grinned. “It’s not really my specialty but they definitely can use some help with clothing. You are the same, single boy.”</p><p>Lou Cheng took a glance at him and turned back to the bustle. He whispered to Cai Zongming.</p><p>“Casanova, is every man with some martial arts skills tempted to act boldly?”</p><p>“Yes, the able break rules with martial arts.” Cai Zongming looked up and down, putting on a terrified look. “Cheng, don’t tell me you are practicing that slogan? You will end up in jail!”</p><p>“What’s wrong with your head?” Lou Cheng said with a sneer. “I mean… If I knew nothing about martial arts, I would hope for mere safety if I had a chance to go out with Yan Zheke. No illegal taxi. No rogue. No robber. In short, success without a hitch. But now, I’m kinda looking forward to running into a few bad guys, or some brainless rich kids so I can step out to save the beauty.”</p><p>Instead of refuting, Cai Zongming responded calmly, “Wake up. Your beauty is more skillful than you. Old Qiu is of Amateur Sixth Pin and Guo Qing and I will always be there. It wouldn’t be your turn to save the beauty, OK?”</p><p>“True…” Lou Cheng’s lips twitched.</p><p>Well, the classic scenario of a hero saving a beauty was not going to happen…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
