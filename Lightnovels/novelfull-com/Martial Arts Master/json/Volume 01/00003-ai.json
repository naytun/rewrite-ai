  "body": "<p>The crowd jostled inside the gym. Lou Cheng and Cai Zongming had just entered, positioning themselves near the door. They spotted two figures walking in.</p>\n<p>A man in a suit, his cheeks sagging and wrinkles framing his eyes, had his hair slicked back. He appeared to be the coach of the Martial Arts Club. He walked steadily, scanning the room with a serious expression. But when he turned to the man beside him, his demeanor softened. This man, dressed in jeans and a white t-shirt, stood half a head taller. He was slender, with short hair, and carried a bulging black gym bag on his back.</p>\n<p>“He must be the legendary Lin Que,” Lou Cheng thought.</p>\n<p>As Lin Que entered, the gymnasium fell silent, as if he had pressed a mute button. He walked coolly, unfazed by the curious, excited, and adoring gazes fixed on him. When the coach introduced him, Lin Que merely nodded, his expression calm. He was led through the crowd and into the locker room, moving like a celebrity.</p>\n<p>Once he disappeared, the silence shattered into a flurry of chatter.</p>\n<p>“So cool!”</p>\n<p>“The Martial Arts Club really has some handsome guys!”</p>\n<p>“How charming and challenging!”</p>\n<p>These exclamations came from the girls.</p>\n<p>“What’s with the apathy…”</p>\n<p>“The capable ones are never easygoing.”</p>\n<p>“If I had the rank of Professional Ninth Pin, I’d be just as proud!”</p>\n<p>“Our club is going to shine!”</p>\n<p>“Yeah, once we beat Guannan and Neihai, they won’t be able to act so high and mighty!”</p>\n<p>“With his help, we might reach amateur fifth or sixth pin by graduation. That’s another way to make a living…”</p>\n<p>Those comments were from the boys.</p>\n<p>As Lou Cheng pulled his gaze away, he noticed Yan Zheke by the door, dressed in a red and white Han costume. Her face radiated admiration, mirroring the other girls.</p>\n<p>“Sign… How I envy him!” Lou Cheng sighed to Cai Zongming. “If only I were a Professional Ninth Pin, I could enjoy this.”</p>\n<p>Cai Zongming tutted. “Now’s a good time to quote something classic to show off your literary skills. You should say, ‘a real man is like that’!”</p>\n<p>“A real man is like that…” Lou Cheng pondered for a moment, then glanced at Yan Zheke and teased Cai Zongming. “And you’d say, ‘I can replace him’?”</p>\n<p>“You really are my bosom friend.” Cai Zongming chuckled, flexing his arm to show off his muscle. “Even though I’ve skipped quite a few martial arts training sessions, I’ve made it to Amateur Fifth Pin. Just imagine if I took it seriously. I’d reach Professional Ninth Pin in no time and be the most charming guy in the Martial Arts Club!”</p>\n<p>“You’re probably the only one who can brag about skipping classes so proudly.” Their banter continued, light-hearted and playful.</p>\n<p>After a while, Yan Zheke slipped into the women’s locker room.</p>\n<p>The Orientation began promptly. As the lights flickered on, a muscular man stepped into the ring.</p>\n<p>“Everyone, I’m Chen Changhua, a senior and the manager of this Martial Arts Club…” In a black leotard, Chen Changhua looked sharp and robust. His fierce expression softened as he introduced himself with a broad smile.</p>\n<p>“Ha-hah! Look at his eyebrows. They remind me of the song ‘Bugs flying o bugs flying’…” Cai Zongming whispered to Lou Cheng during Chen Changhua’s speech.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng shot him a glance. “Casanova, you should really join the Crosstalk Club. Don’t waste your talent!”</p>\n<p>Their whispered exchanges seemed to have no effect on Chen Changhua’s introduction.</p>\n<p>“As you all know, the Martial Arts Realm has four stages – body refining, Qi, invulnerability, and restriction. The last two aren’t our concern today, as amateurs probably won’t reach them. So, I’ll focus on body refining and Qi. The body refining stage is all about training our bodies like refining pills of immortality or smelting metals. It requires coordination from many aspects. A trance training session or a workout in the weight room isn’t enough.</p>\n<p>“I’m telling you this because I want you to know that no prior martial arts experience is okay. We will help you with it. The Songcheng University Martial Arts Club has a long history, and our body refining training is professional and traditional, unlike what you find in random martial arts clubs or gyms. Commit to it for the next four years, and you’ll easily reach the rank of amateur fifth or fourth pin, which will qualify you for a coaching position in any martial arts club or gym. That gives you another way to make a living.</p>\n<p>“If some of you are true martial arts enthusiasts, you might even pass the Ranking Event and achieve Professional Ninth Pin. I don’t have any special talent in martial arts, but I’m hardworking. Last year, I earned my Amateur First Pin certificate, and now I’m preparing for the upcoming Ranking Event. So you see, Professional Ninth Pin is totally achievable for us Songcheng University Martial Arts Club members. Diligence and devotion will get you everything!</p>\n<p>“Of course, if you’re a real talent, it’s also possible to break through the body refining stage and enter Qi practice. Shanbei University has a genius who’s been giving us a lot of trouble whenever we meet…”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng frowned, turning to Cai Zongming. “Didn’t Shanbei University win last year’s championship in the university martial arts event?”</p>\n<p>“That’s right,” Cai Zongming confirmed with a nod.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng hesitated. “Chen Changhua’s words sounded a bit strange, didn’t they?”</p>\n<p>It seemed he was subtly alluding to someone…</p>\n<p>“Definitely strange. He’s said so much, and I’d sum it up in two sentences. First, Professional Ninth Pin isn’t that rare, so Lin Que isn’t a big deal.” Cai Zongming laughed, continuing, “Second, our Martial Arts Club isn’t doing well because our competitors are too strong!”</p>\n<p>Having his suspicions confirmed, Lou Cheng shook his head. “Chen Changhua seems to have an issue with Lin Que. Isn’t it risky for him to say it out loud?”</p>\n<p>“Who cares? It’s not our problem.” Cai Zongming, bored, pulled out his phone.</p>\n<p>Finally, Chen Changhua wrapped up his lengthy speech with a smile.</p>\n<p>“Well, now let me introduce our senior members. They all have experience in the Ranking Event and are of Amateur Sixth Pin or higher…”</p>\n<p>Before Lou Cheng could look up properly, Cai Zongming tugged at his shirt.</p>\n<p>“Come on. Let’s head back,” he whispered.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng was taken aback. “Now? It’s still early.”</p>\n<p>“Are you waiting to meet those senior members? Come on! You’re here for a girl. Do you really think you’re an undiscovered talent who had no training in the first 18 years but will suddenly achieve enlightenment and become a martial arts master greater than all the seniors? Do you see yourself winning the National Martial Arts Competitions for Songcheng University and attracting attention from the top guys, starting your rise to the peak of your life with money and women?” Cai Zongming had a knack for humor.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng laughed, feeling a bit embarrassed. “We’re already here. Let’s stay and see.”</p>\n<p>Cai Zongming scanned the room. “You’re just going to hang around here until you get your girl. What’s the point of meeting the seniors? I can teach you anyway…”</p>\n<p>He lowered his voice. “If you leave now, you’ll have an excuse to talk to your goddess.”</p>\n<p>“Ha?” Lou Cheng was confused.</p>\n<p>“Think about it. You make up an excuse to leave early, and later you can ask her what you missed. Training schedules or anything. A conversation starts naturally without making yourself seem like a nuisance. Then, you can easily move on to other topics,” Cai Zongming explained passionately.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng stared at him for a few seconds.</p>\n<p>“Little Ming, you’re the only one I admire among all my roommates!”</p>\n<p>“Call me Casanova, please!” Cai Zongming bent slightly and headed toward the exit as the senior members entered the ring. Lou Cheng followed him.</p>\n<p>As soon as they stepped outside, Lou Cheng was surprised to see an artistic man filming them with a striking camera.</p>\n<p>“Damn! My skipping martial arts lessons is going to be on television?”</p>\n<p>A young girl in a classic office outfit stood beside the cameraman.</p>\n<p>When she spotted Lou Cheng and Cai Zongming, the girl, with a nerdy look, approached them with a bright smile.</p>\n<p>“Hello! I’m a reporter from Songcheng TV Station. Do you have time for a quick interview?”</p>\n<p>With a refreshing short haircut, long dark eyebrows, clear eyes, and a cute nose, she looked like a recent graduate, her dimples showing when she smiled. The ID badge hanging from her neck read Shu Rui.</p>\n<p>“What interview?” Lou Cheng asked, eyeing the microphone.</p>\n<p>“No problem,” Cai Zongming replied without hesitation.</p>\n<p>They exchanged glances, both feeling a mutual disdain.</p>\n<p>The reporter, Shu Rui, lifted her pretty oval face and smiled. “Are you members of the Songcheng University Martial Arts Club?”</p>\n<p>“Damn! We’re caught skipping class on site…” Lou Cheng thought, scratching his head before answering, “Yeah. We… We’ve got an emergency.”</p>\n<p>“Yes, an emergency that requires us to leave early,” Cai Zongming added calmly.</p>\n<p>Shu Rui didn’t seem to mind. She kept her professional smile. “Did you see Lin Que earlier in there?”</p>\n<p>“Yeah.” Lou Cheng and Cai Zongming exchanged astonished looks as they realized the interview was about Lin Que.</p>\n<p>It made sense for a reporter to be there, considering Songcheng University was the top university in the city, and martial arts was currently a hot topic.</p>\n<p>Shu Rui beamed again. “Lin Que is the very first freshman of Professional Ninth Pin in the history of Songcheng University. What do you think about his decision to join the Martial Arts Club? Any thoughts?”</p>\n<p>“Pretty good. Our martial arts club can probably reach the next level,” Cai Zongming grinned.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng smiled genuinely. “I’m really excited. We’re lucky to have him.”</p>\n<p>Shu Rui withdrew the microphone, her eyes sparkling. “Thank you for this interview.”</p>\n<p>As the reporter and cameraman headed back into the gym, Lou Cheng and Cai Zongming spoke simultaneously.</p>\n<p>“Cheng, was my smile a bit stiff?”</p>\n<p>“Casanova, was my smile a bit silly?”</p>\n<p>They burst into laughter, the tension dissipating.</p>\n<p>“It’s going to be my first time on TV. Kinda weird,” Lou Cheng rubbed his cheeks.</p>\n<p>Cai Zongming grinned. “Me too. Well, they might not even use it. Lin Que is the star. He-heh. The reporter wasn’t bad either—beautiful, pure, and in great shape. Did you notice her legs? Long and straight. I like her better than your goddess.”</p>\n<p>“Hello, 911? I’m calling to report a pervert,” Lou Cheng pretended to take out his phone.</p>\n<p>“Get lost!” Cai Zongming protested. “Just kidding.”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng laughed. “Well, when I meet my sister-in-law someday, I’ll tell her that Little Ming has been behaving!”</p>\n<p>They chatted and laughed on their way back to the dormitory, soon brushing the interview aside.</p>\n<p>The dormitory at Songcheng University consisted of two-bedroom flats. Each flat had a basic living room, a balcony for laundry on the left, and a bathroom with a separate squatting toilet on the right. Two bedrooms, one on each side of the aisle, were shared by eight students, each with their own bed atop their desk, next to their wardrobe.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng and Cai Zongming were not in the same bedroom. As soon as they entered the living room, Cai Zongming pulled out his phone. “Cheng, I’ll make a call. Wait for me so we can have dinner together.”</p>\n<p>“Huh. How sweet!” Knowing Cai Zongming would spend hours on the phone with his girlfriend, Lou Cheng decided to play some computer games in his room.</p>\n<p>Stepping into the empty room, Lou Cheng realized his three roommates were still in the study hall.</p>\n<p>“So hard-working…” He felt a twinge of embarrassment seeing their diligence.</p>\n<p>The timing felt awkward—not enough to finish a game but too much to do nothing. Lou Cheng soon calmed himself and logged into the forum.</p>\n<p>This platform hosted a variety of forums, covering nearly every topic imaginable, and had a large user base. Lou Cheng was visiting the Longhu Club.</p>\n<p>Longhu Club was in the premier league of the Professional Martial Arts Competition and was one of the most competitive forces vying for the title of the most powerful heir of Chinese martial arts. Founded just over three decades ago, it was like a newborn compared to those sects with histories spanning hundreds of years. This young club and its martial arts school for different age groups had been challenging those noble, ancient, and influential sects, achieving a good number of victories. Chen Qitao, known as the Dragon King and one of the Legendary Twins of the modern martial arts world, was a prime example of Longhu Club’s exceptional members.</p>\n<p>Such a martial arts club, boasting such a remarkable martial artist, was undeniably appealing, and Lou Cheng was one of its many fans.</p>\n<p>In the forum, Lou Cheng couldn’t help but wear a mischievous smile as he posted under the name Schrodinger’s Tiger.</p>\n<p>“Urgent! Just joined a Martial Arts Club today. How can I appear to be a frequenter?”</p>",
