When he expressed his desire to join the special training, a wave of gazes hit him like arrows from every direction. Shock, confusion, and curiosity filled the air, leaving him horrified and anxious. It reminded him of the time he had to give a speech in front of the entire school. Standing on that stage, he had faced a sea of peers and teachers, his heart racing, barely able to speak. He felt relieved not to be the center of attention this time.</p>\n<p>Geezer Shi appeared pleased. “Terrific. You must be a true enthusiast in martial arts. What’s your name?”</p>\n<p>“Lou Cheng,” he replied, taking a deep breath to steady himself.</p>\n<p>Geezer Shi flipped through the registry, searching for Lou Cheng’s name. “In which year? Of which amateur pin? Seventh or eighth?”</p>\n<p>Silence enveloped the gym. Lin Que kept his gaze lowered, seemingly indifferent. Chen Changhua, towering over most of his peers, glanced at Lou Cheng, curiosity flickering in his eyes. The other members of the Martial Arts Club waited eagerly for Lou Cheng’s response, except for his friends Cai Zongming, Qiu Zhigao, and Yan Zheke, who looked utterly shocked.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng answered calmly, “A freshman of no rank.”</p>\n<p>“Of no freaking rank and you want to join the training?” Geezer Shi’s words slipped out, breaking his usual composure.</p>\n<p>Laughter erupted in the gym, filling the space with a lighthearted atmosphere. Lou Cheng felt heat rise to his cheeks, embarrassment washing over him.</p>\n<p>“Good,” Geezer Shi said, lowering his hand to signal for quiet. “A newborn calf is not afraid of tigers. Much like I was in my youth. I’ll see you tomorrow. Remember, quit when you can take no more. Don’t push yourself too hard. I can’t take responsibility for your life.”</p>\n<p>“Are you praising me? Or boasting about yourself?” Lou Cheng wondered, then replied, “Yes, Coach Shi.”</p>\n<p>He instinctively glanced at Yan Zheke, who met his gaze with a joyful smile and an encouraging gesture.</p>\n<p>Ignoring the murmurs from the Martial Arts Club members, Geezer Shi continued, “So Lou Cheng is the first to apply for the special training. The first mover. Anyone else?”</p>\n<p>“Coach, me!” A sweet, familiar voice called out, making Lou Cheng turn. It was Yan Zheke.</p>\n<p>“She… She also wants to join?” he thought, surprised.</p>\n<p>“Is she just a big fan of martial arts, or…?”</p>\n<p>Cai Zongming shattered Lou Cheng’s daydream. “One illusion in life: she’s doing this for you.”</p>\n<p>“Couldn’t you let my happiness last a few seconds longer?” Lou Cheng shot back at Cai.</p>\n<p>Cai Zongming grinned. “Not feeling too good about yourself is essential for chasing girls. But Cheng, I’m impressed you’re willing to wake up four hours early every morning for a girl. You’ve beaten me in perseverance and courage. Nothing is impossible for a willing heart! God won’t let down a determined heart!”</p>\n<p>Listening to Little Ming’s nonsense, Lou Cheng struggled to find words. He couldn’t mention the Jindan; there’s a saying, “He who loses his secret will lose himself.” So he simply admitted it was for a girl.</p>\n<p>“Anyway, give it a try. You can always quit.”</p>\n<p>“Makes sense,” Cai Zongming nodded, giving a thumbs up. “You’re worthy to be taught!”</p>\n<p>Yan Zheke’s decision sparked interest among many boys. Hands shot up to apply for the training, and it took Geezer Shi a while to write down every name. He straightened his face. “Everyone, attention. Get ready for class.”</p>\n<p>“Your ranks vary from nothing to Professional Ninth Pin, but in front of me, you’re all the same—unprofessional martial arts enthusiasts, or in other words, babies on a feeding bottle. We’ll start our first martial arts lesson with the foundation. Remember, the journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.”</p>\n<p>Geezer Shi clasped his hands behind his back and paced in front of the group. His voice, though not loud, was clear enough for all to hear. “The entry-level of martial arts begins with stance training, supplemented by footwork practice and strength training like bench presses, deep squats, pull-ups, and back muscle stretches. Only when you’ve grasped these can you move on to actual martial movements and learn the novel force launching techniques of each move…”</p>\n<p>“Your Principal put in a lot of effort to bring me here with sincere respect. I’m not a man with an unearned reputation. The stance training of our first lesson will be the Yin-Yang Stance, the lost knowledge of the Taoist Thunder Sect!”</p>\n<p>Bang! The crowd erupted into excited chatter. Members of the Martial Arts Club whispered to each other, their faces a mix of excitement and shock.</p>\n<p>The lost knowledge of the Taoist Thunder Sect was well-known in the martial arts world. Its basic stance training was a hot topic but often overlooked by amateurs. Those crude and straightforward stance trainings were nothing like it.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng turned to Cai Zongming, his excitement palpable. “Shangqing Sect’s lost technique of the Thunder Sect?”</p>\n<p>“Must be,” Cai Zongming replied, equally thrilled.</p>\n<p>The Taoist martial arts had a relatively short history, not part of the genuine origins of martial arts. However, it inherited from pre-Qin eras, organizing The Old Gods and Old Ghosts System, laying the groundwork for the next bloom of martial arts. Its core was known as the Five Sects Unique Skills, with the Restriction Sect topping the Thunder, Fire, Fighting, and Plague Sects.</p>\n<p>Two major forces, Shangqing Sect and Longhu Club, were the heirs of the unique skills of the Thunder Sect and the Fire Sect, respectively. Another powerful force, Shushan Study, carried forward the entire system of the Fighting Sect, while the skills of the Plague Sect had scattered in wars, partly passed on by many forces.</p>\n<p>The basic training of such unique skills thrilled the martial arts members who had long soaked in news from the martial arts circle.</p>\n<p>Considering Coach Shi was invited by the Principal himself, he must possess real skills beyond mere ostentation.</p>\n<p>Sadly, it wasn’t Longhu Club’s stance training of the Fire Sect… Lou Cheng felt a twinge of disappointment.</p>\n<p>Geezer Shi widened his stance, becoming imposing like a towering mountain or a roaring sea. He lifted both hands, forming a closed ring in front of his chest, and began to speak:</p>\n<p>“Physical poses of still stance are usually simple. However, the key lies in the stillness. As the Thunder Sect says, concealment of spirit and Qi can ward off trouble. It tells us that only the dead can keep the mind void. Focus on one item completely. Remain concentrated to find peace…”</p>\n<p>“You may think about anything—a man or a woman, a cat or a dog, a holy statue or tableware—as long as it arouses no desire. I usually think about a one-hundred bill, suppressing my mind with the founding father of the country without waking up my greed. This means treating money like dirt…”</p>\n<p>As Lou Cheng listened to Geezer Shi’s intriguing description, he prepared for meditation. However, his thoughts wandered, making it hard to focus. When he thought of Yan Zheke, distractions flooded in, and he found himself dreaming of the future.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, his attention shifted to the Jindan inside his Dantian.</p>\n<p>Focusing on his lower stomach, Lou Cheng gathered all his thoughts and restrained them within the Jindan. He envisioned a fantastic ice ball with a nebula pattern and small flames.</p>\n<p>As his thoughts coalesced, the scene in Lou Cheng’s vision changed. He could see inside his Dantian, where the dreamy Jindan rotated slowly.</p>\n<p>Small ice crystals transformed into stars around those tiny flames, creating a vast, profound universe.</p>\n<p>“This… Can I actually see the Jindan?” As an experienced martial arts fan, Lou Cheng was familiar with academic terms. He quickly realized the state he was in.</p>\n<p>That was the advanced level of Solemn Silence!</p>\n<p>Previously, he could only sense the Jindan after a long, exhausting run. Now, he could see it within his body by merely remaining silent. He began to enjoy his gradual control over it, no longer feeling terrified and helpless like the day before. Conclusions formed in his mind:</p>\n<p>“Practicing martial arts can indeed help me gain control over the Jindan. Furthermore, it can speed up my martial arts training, just like it aided my meditation! Joining this special training was the right choice!”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng focused on his Dantian, achieving peace through concentration. Random thoughts appeared and vanished, but they no longer disrupted his meditation.</p>\n<p>His surroundings faded away. Everything seemed to float up to the sky. Geezer Shi’s voice echoed in his ear from a distance.</p>\n<p>“Once you achieve peace, slowly shift your weight to the left, keeping the left foot heavier and the right foot lighter, then do the opposite. Feel the strength changing in every muscle during your weight shifting. This is the Yin-Yang Stance. Your body appears still, yet movements and changes never stop inside.”</p>\n<p>“This stance training helps you meditate and allows you to feel the subtle changes and cooperation within your body while pulling strength to exert better control of your muscles and utilize your whole body. At the ultimate level of training, your strength, muscles, and mind will become one, like a human elixir. Once the elixir forms, Qi will begin to grow, and you will step into the Danqi stage, the real entry level of martial arts. At this stage, even the weakest among you can reach the rank of Professional Eighth Pin.</p>\n<p>“Ha-hah, just saying. Don’t think too much about it, as most of you will never reach this stage. Lin Que is probably the only one among you with such potential. The rest of you don’t need to take it too seriously.”</p>\n<p>“Damn it! He’s probably stating the fact, but this old man indeed has a bitter tongue…” The thought crossed Lou Cheng’s mind, but it didn’t disturb his concentration. He began to shift his weight to his left foot slowly.</p>\n<p>As he shifted his weight, he felt changes in his leg muscles, feet, and waist. With those subtle changes reflected in his mind, he could barely recognize his own body.</p>\n<p>“While running with arms waving, my mind manipulates my body, and physical moves happen smoothly. But who could notice such continuous changes at every inch of the body? No wonder a wrong pose can significantly slow me down and consume more energy! The order of strength pulling was wrong!”</p>\n<p>Perceive as you see, believe not what you perceive!</p>\n<p>It didn’t take long for Lou Cheng to immerse himself in this new sensation. He continued to shift his weight, feeling the changes in his body between falsehood and reality, movement and stillness, lightness and heaviness, as if a gate to a new world had just opened. Especially when a warm stream of the Jindan reached every corner of his body, some kind of mystery was gently touched.</p>\n<p>As Geezer Shi taught the Yin-Yang Stance, he patrolled around, reviewing his students. First-timers in still stance training had almost no chance of actually remaining still. He merely wanted these young fellows to adapt.</p>\n<p>Lin Que performed well. Coming from a family with a long history in martial arts, he was already familiar with Solemn Silence. Geezer Shi stepped past him, nodding with a slight smile.</p>\n<p>“Chen Changhua is too distracted to calm down… Wu Dong’s health condition doesn’t allow him to stay calm… Yan Zheke is doing alright. With a few more tries, she might achieve peace… What the heck is this? What is he thinking about? Is he dribbling?” As he walked past each member, Geezer Shi silently commented in his mind, “This must be Cai Zongming. He has some talent but too many useless thoughts. He needs to organize his mind, or it will take him quite a long time to master the Yin-Yang Stance. Hmm?”</p>\n<p>Geezer Shi paused by Lou Cheng, surprise and confusion flickering in his eyes.</p>",
