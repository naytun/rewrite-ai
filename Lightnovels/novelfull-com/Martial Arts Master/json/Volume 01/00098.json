His confusion came out as a chuckle. “As long as you got what you want.”</p><p>He put that bag down and rushed to leave but stumbled over the threshold and almost fell by the door. He dashed down the flight of stairs without looking back.</p><p>A dead silence hovered above Qi Yan’s living room for dozens of seconds until Lou Cheng’s mom asked confusedly, “Cheng, who presented you these?”</p><p>A fresh year university student with little social connections could find his way to get Ningshui County original-proof hard liquor and Maojian green tea?</p><p>She felt responsible as the mother to dig out the truth to protect her son from a big scam!</p><p>Lou Cheng began to explain with a smile. “Mom, remember Tao Xiaofei, the boy sat right in front of me in high school? You probably met his mother or father during a parent-teacher meeting.”</p><p>In normal Xiushan No.1 Middle School practice, parents would sit in their child’s seat accordingly at parent-teacher meetings.</p><p>“Of course! His mom used to speak highly of your good grades and stability, making you a role model for Tao Xiaofei.” Qi Fang started to recollect memories. “She looked fancy, glittering with jewelry…”</p><p>Lou Zhisheng couldn’t help commenting. “Emm… Very well said. Glittering with jewelry. Perfect!”</p><p>Qi Fang glared at him. “My language is nothing in front of the well-educated. An illiterate woman as me can use such a big word. Shouldn’t you a big scholar learn to cook? The kitchen is all yours from now on!”</p><p>Lou Zhisheng chuckled and quickly turned to Lou Cheng. “A gift from Tao Xiaofei?”</p><p>“Yeah. I was just trying. He said there were tons in his home and he offered me some.” Lou Cheng closed the door behind him.</p><p>“Must be a good friend of yours. He came all the way here to give it to you.” Qi Yan interrupted.</p><p>Chen Wenguo seemed pondering. “The Tao family must be doing well.”</p><p>“Not bad.” Nobody knew whether Lou Cheng’s answer was for his aunt or uncle-in-law.</p><p>Qi Yan suddenly clapped and said with excitement, “Cheng, I can barely recognize you now. Ha-hah! I’ve never seen Deng the Third in such a wretched condition! Hmm! Can’t we get it through our connections in this life? We got two for free!”</p><p>She sounded like a breath of foul air had found a vent.</p><p>Qi Fang came to heel. “I wanted to slap Deng the Third earlier!”</p><p>Her eyes were filled with joy, very pleased with his son. The thing the adults in the family couldn’t solve was taken care of by her teenage son.</p><p>“Your friend offered it to you for free but we can’t just take it,” said Lou Zhisheng after a long thought.</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed. “Dad, don’t worry. I’ll be careful with consorting with my classmates.”</p><p>Qi Jiayu was about to add on some compliments when the door was opened, two young girls coming in joyfully. He smiled at them. “Fei and Xiao, your mom would break your legs if you came a bit later.”</p><p>“My mom? She always has her tongue in her cheek.” Qi Yunfei snorted, rubbing her nose.</p><p>Qi Yan straightened her face. “My tongue is in my cheek? You are courting punches?”</p><p>“Mom, pardon me!” Qi Yunfei suddenly changed her tone sharply, leaving Lou Cheng in shock.</p><p>Bubbly and naughty, these two younger cousins of Lou Cheng together were quite hard to handle. Possibly the best-looking ones in their generation of the family, they were adorable and lovely, small featured and exquisite in the Ningshui dialect.</p><p>“Brother Lou Cheng, when did you arrive?” As her older sister adulated their mother, Chen Xiaoxiao looked at Lou Cheng with a sweet smile.</p><p>Looking very similar to her older sister, of the same fringe, her baby fat was still there and her eyes were slightly bigger, less pretty but much cuter.</p><p>“Long, long time ago.” Lou Cheng exaggerated in a deliberately heavy tone.</p><p>After a few casual chats, the two girls went to their bedroom, getting themselves ready for lunch, with Lou Cheng following behind. He closed the door with his heel and crossed his arms in front of his chest, sneering.</p><p>“Be honest with me. What is going on heading out so early on the second day of the new year?”</p><p>Chen Xiaoxiao pretended to shiver. “Brother Lou Cheng, I’m nothing but a cover for Sister Fei’s romantic date.”</p><p>“My goodness. A romantic date is already at such a young age!” Lou Cheng teased, looking at Qi Yunfei in disbelief.</p><p>Qi Yunfei glared at Chen Xiaoxiao.</p><p>“Traitor!”</p><p>She grimaced at Lou Cheng. “I’m 15, in 9th grade. No longer a young age.”</p><p>“Well, I don’t really care as long as your mom is okay with that.” Lou Cheng’s eyebrows shot upwards.</p><p>Qi Yunfei turned pale from fear. “Brother Lou Cheng, you are not gonna sell me, are you?”</p><p>“Well, it depends. If you can’t get in Xiushan No.1 Middle School or Ningshui No.2 Middle School… He-heh. You know…” Lou Cheng acted as if a unearthly god.</p><p>Qi Yunfei lowered her guard seeing his exaggeration. “That’s enough about me. Brother Lou Cheng, any love story from university?”</p><p>“Getting there.” Lou Cheng raised his right hand, with his thumb pressing against the first line of his pinky finger.</p><p>“Emm…” The two girls showed great interest. “So you are falling in love? Who is she?”</p><p>“I’ll tell you when I succeed.” Lou Cheng didn’t want to set himself up.</p><p>The day of the family gathering was full of joy and laughter thanks to the two bubbly, interesting girls. After dinner, Qi Jiayu and Qi Yan convinced Lou Cheng and his parents to stay for the night.</p><p>Chen Xiaoxiao moved to her sister’s room, giving hers to Lou Cheng’s parents. Lou Cheng would be sleeping in the living room.</p><p>Since Qi Fang casually mentioned Lou Cheng’s new habit of going to bed early at 10:30 p.m. and getting up early for morning exercise, they turned TV off at 10 p.m. and went to their room respectively.</p><p>As the night deepened, Lou Cheng logged out his QQ and remained in silence and clarity in preparation for sleep. Abruptly his mobile vibrated, waking him up from a dreamless state.</p><p>A phone call from Yan Zheke at midnight sharp.</p><p>“Why is she calling me all of a sudden?” Surprised, delighted, puzzled, worried and perturbed, Lou Cheng picked up his phone and answered.</p><p>“Hello, Cheng?” From the phone came Yan Zheke’s lovely voice, cheerful.</p><p>“Hmm. It’s me.” Lou Cheng sounded confused, half awake.</p><p>Yan Zheke laughed gently. “Cheng, happy birthday!”</p><p>“Happy birthday?” Lou Cheng suddenly sobered up, remembering it was his birthday after middle night. The second day of February.</p><p>“Ha-hah! I forgot about it until this phone call.” Lou Cheng’s voice became louder with joy, echoing in the quiet and peaceful living room, his eyebrows dancing and his spirits soaring.</p><p>Yan Zheke waited until midnight just to wish me a happy birthday!</p><p>How wonderful!</p><p>She is adjusting her biological clock, adapting herself to morning training.</p><p>“No one but me celebrates the birthday for you?” Yan Zheke asked with a grin.</p><p>Afraid of waking up others, Lou Cheng grabbed his phone and put on a jacket, making his way to the balcony quietly. “The last birthday celebration I can remember was back to my primary school days. My parents usually just make me a bowl of longevity noodles.”</p><p>Domestic difficulties didn’t allow him to celebrate with cakes and luxury meals in junior high school and no celebration became his usual practice in senior high school as if it was unnecessary and immature.</p><p>As soon as he pulled open the door to the balcony, he saw a black shadow crouching in the corner and yelled in a very low voice,</p><p>“Who is this?”</p><p>The shadow jumped up with fear and turned around to face Lou Cheng, patting her chest. “Brother Lou Cheng, you almost scared me to death!”</p><p>It was his cousin Qi Yunfei in Grade Nine, wearing a nightgown with bunny ears under a light down jacket. Her hand holding her phone was slightly shaking.</p><p>“Same here. I thought you were a thief.” Lou Cheng replied without covering the speaker on his mobile.</p><p>Qi Yunfei heaved a sigh. “Have you ever seen a thief cute like me? My boyfriend called and I didn’t want to wake Xiao up. So I’m here on the balcony.”</p><p>She stared at Lou Cheng, moving her brows with a sneer. “Looks like someone is in the same boat.”</p><p>“Yes.” Lou Cheng found it rather amusing. “What a coincidence!”</p><p>As if there was a tacit agreement, the pair occupied a corner each and got back to their phone call respectively.</p><p>“What was that?” asked Yan Zheke curiously.</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed. “I’m staying at my aunt’s home. To not awake others, I came to the balcony but walked into my cousin on her phone.”</p><p>“Phew… What’s she doing on the balcony so late?” Yan Zheke chuckled.</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed. “Puppy love. She’s on the phone with her boyfriend.”</p><p>He turned his head, meeting Qi Yunfei’s hot glare full of blame for his betrayal!</p><p>Lou Cheng wasn’t bothered at all. He pretended he saw nothing and continued with Yan Zheke on the phone for several more minutes until he realized it might affect her early rising.</p><p>“May I ask for a birthday gift?”</p><p>“Sure but I have my right to say no.” Yan Zheke teased. Lou Cheng could almost see her pursing her lips and chuckling.</p><p>Lou Cheng secretly pressed the recording button on his phone and then continued with excitement, “Please sing a happy birthday song to me.”</p><p>“Hmm! Only because it is your birthday!” Yan Zheke started to hum. “Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you… What’s your birthday wish? Hurry!”</p><p>Lou Cheng’s heart was flooded with joy. He hinted after a long pondering. “As the old saying goes, many happy returns of this day!”</p><p>Many happy returns of this day with you!</p><p>“That’s a good wish!” A faint pride and joy could be heard from her voice. She added, “I’m going to sleep. You, too. Rise early tomorrow for your training! Goodnight!”</p><p>“Goodnight!” Lou Cheng felt great as her voice didn’t turn cold. He hung up the call and tried hard to maintain the boiling happiness within himself as he didn’t want to lose his dignity in front of his cousin.</p><p>He kept his emotion in until back in the living room he finally swung his arms in silence.</p><p>My 19 years old couldn’t have a better start!</p><p>He turned to look at Qi Yunfei with a guilty conscience—her eyes secretly laid on him and her hand covered her face tightly, losing her usual self.</p><p>The pair smiled at each other and a tacit agreement developed. They made a gesture to encourage each other.</p><p>…</p><p>Lou Cheng enjoyed his holiday life to the full in the next couple of days. There was no class or homework lining up after his morning exercise and he didn’t need to split his time between training and study.</p><p>Besides family gathering time were his everlasting phone calls and video calls with Yan Zheke, some fiction reading, internet surfing, mingling in group chats, spying on his forum, playing games with Jiang Fei and Cheng Qili while instructing their body exercise. His life was relaxing and enjoyable, mentally and physically. The brutal fight on the first day of this year seemed to go far away and he no longer dreamed about it at night.</p><p>Time flew and here quickly came the seventh day of this year. The date to pay Director Xing a new year visit.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
