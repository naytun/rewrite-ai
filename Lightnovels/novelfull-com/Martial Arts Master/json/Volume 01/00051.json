According to the rules of the Phoenix Cup Warrior Sage Candidate Challenge Tournament, they had to sign a contract with the sponsor Yanling Group, pledging integrity during the competition.</p><p>As a newcomer, Lou Cheng looked around and sneaked into a corner as usual, waiting for the sponsor to show up.</p><p>“Hey, you were excellent yesterday with Wu Shitong, I dreamed of having your Listening Skill one day.” A fighter greeted him with a smile as Lou Cheng sat beside him.</p><p>Turing around, that fighter, who had a delicate beauty like a girl but was not feminine, caught his eyes.</p><p>The fighter was a young student about Lou Cheng’s age, handsome and graceful, with shoulder-length hair like an artist. At first sight, Lou Cheng took him as a pretty classical boy, and then he thought about a banished immortal.</p><p>“With his looking, he can just enter the entertainment circle and be an idol.</p><p>If Little Ming ever sees him, it must be a big blow to Little Ming’s ego…” Lou Cheng secretly joked about the Talker and politely answered. “Thank you, thank you, guess I am just a lucky dog who has nothing to brag about.”</p><p>“No lucky dog would have such powerful Listening Skill.” The Banished Immortal shook his head with a smile. “Oh, I haven’t introduced myself. Hi, Lou Cheng, I am Li Xiaoyuan.”</p><p>Then came Lou Cheng’s “ah ha” moment. “You are Li Xiaoyuan. I have just watched your video highlights on the screens. Your play is so graceful and marvelous.”</p><p>Matches were recorded in a long shot, so spectators were informed of which player in the ring by narration rather than their appearance, which explained Lou Cheng’s earlier confusion.</p><p>He was a seeded player, the strong one among all Professional Ninth Pin masters.</p><p>“Video highlights are tricky. As long as you take some time to edit, my cat and dog can be martial experts,” Li Xiaoyuan smiled and said.</p><p>Lou Cheng relaxed a bit when he found that Li Xiaoyuan was not trying to show off and easy to get along with. “I don’t know why your name seems so familiar to me. Have I seen your name somewhere else other than this competition?”</p><p>“That’s your problem, how am I supposed to know the answer?” Li Xiaoyuan mischievously smiled and added, “But we might see each other in the next few years.”</p><p>“Might?” Lou Cheng looked as puzzled as the Confused Nick Young.</p><p>Arousing Lou Cheng’s curiosity, Li Xiaoyuan said with a smile, “Now Songcheng University Martial Arts Club has you and Lin Que. Sooner or later you guys would make it to the national final. Then we will meet again.”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Lou Cheng finally recalled where he had heard about Li Xiaoyuan.</p><p>“Unparalleled Dragon King”, the human databank, used to comment Lin Que in this way. “… Among all freshmen this year, Li Xiaoyuan in Guangnan University, Fang Zhirong and Feng Wen in Shanbei University all are better than Lin Que…”</p><p>Since Dragon King mentioned once, Lou Cheng had already forgotten about it, even “Road to the Arena” and “Invincible Punch” failed to mention Li Xiaoyuan in the live broadcast post.</p><p>“You are Li Xiaoyuan from Guangnan University?” Lou Cheng asked.</p><p>Li Xiaoyuan nodded, “When I get your profile, I am rather shocked to find out you are a student from Songcheng University. I roughly predict Lin Que’s strength through videos, and he is indeed powerful. Songcheng has Lin Que and now you, a rather good amateur fighter, so it makes no sense that Songcheng wasn’t top 8 in the district contest.”</p><p>“Awkward…” Lou Cheng felt ashamed and subconsciously scratched his head. “I only start to make progress in martial arts recently.”</p><p>After a few explanations, he changed the subject and asked, “What brings you here?”</p><p>Li Xiaoyuan took out his ID from the wallet and handed it to Lou Cheng. “See for yourself.”</p><p>Lou Cheng blankly looked at it and then gave a careful look, on which “Yanling” stood out.</p><p>“You are local…”</p><p>As he was about to compliment Li Xiaoyuan’s ID photo, Liu Zunyu, chairman of the Yanyu Group, came inside with other principals, followed by a bunch of impressive bodyguards.</p><p>Liu Zunyu said to the leader of bodyguards, “Old Sheng, hand out the contracts.”</p><p>“Old Sheng, wearing sunglasses, was silent and secretive, average height and firmly-built. When he sent out the contracts, Liu Zunyu rolled his hands like a martial arts fighter and greeted them as a home practicing disciple of Kongtong School.</p><p>“Thank you all for attending the Phoenix Cup Warrior Sage Candidate Challenge Tournament. From my perspective, there is no need to sign any contracts. As a country has its state laws and a family needs family rules, rules are to set in this competition. I have faith in you guys, who will not lose competitions deliberately and trade your integrity for some gambling money. These contracts are to keep up the appearance.” Liu Zunyu was a sweet talker, not wanting to put people on the defensive.</p><p>After his speech, other principals continued with detailed introductions.</p><p>Now the contract was passed to Lou Cheng. As a freshman not majoring in law, he just thumbed through pages and grasped the main idea. Any fighter who was involved in gambling on his/her own match would be punished according to the rules of martial arts circle rather than the law.</p><p>“Martial arts competition is designed to compete in strength, including both talent and preparations. Any behaviors are permitted as long as they are not against the law.”</p><p>“Those who gamble on their own matches are despised by their mates and spectators who pay to watch a real fight. As for masters with physical invulnerability, they are rich and powerful, impossible to be bribed or threatened. However, for a small competition like ours, reputation must be prioritized for the following competitions to be held. In earlier rounds, there was fewer spectators and chance for fighters involved in gambling was slight. From now on, the following competitions will be broadcast live on Yanling television station and we have to take preventive measures.” A Principal explained.</p><p>“I believe that everyone is familiar with rules of the martial arts circle. Abandon one’s martial accomplishments by stabbing a knife into his/her each calf three times.”</p><p>The last few words were spoken out ghastly.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s mouth grew wide as he had never participated in any similar events. But on second thought, this proposal was reasonable.</p><p>Lou Cheng kept his bottom line, so gambling wouldn’t be an issue for him. He picked up the pen and was ready to sign the contract.</p><p>“Don’t you worry it might be an indenture selling yourself?” Came a low voice.</p><p>“Uh?” Lou Cheng stopped his writing hand and turned to Li Xiaoyuan with fear in his eyes.</p><p>Li Xiaoyuan still had no expressions and calmly said,</p><p>“Just joking.”</p><p>He signed his name upon finishing the line.</p><p>“Come on, mate. Act accordingly please! Banished Immortal do not joke around!” Lou Cheng complained a bit secretly and signed the contract after scouring the pages.</p><p>When the whole process finished, top 32 all left. Lou Cheng was too busy to check the live broadcast post on the forum and see how “Road to the Arena” and “Invincible Punch” talk about themselves running into the old enemy. Dinner in a hurry, Lou Cheng got back to the hotel and started to search videos about Iron Palm and Wuthering Eight Movements on his computer.</p><p>“Even I am doomed to failure, I will lose with dignity.”</p><p>Suddenly, his phone beeped – a message from Yan Zheke.</p><p>She sent a fist-cheering monkey emoji and said, “Not bad! Thanks to my good luck!”</p><p>“As a jinx, I admire you so much.” Lou Cheng suddenly relaxed. “How am I supposed to repay you?”</p><p>“Ha, no rush. I haven’t thought about it. Give me some time.” Yan Zheke replied.</p><p>With a little disappointment, Lou Cheng brought up himself meeting Li Xiaoyuan from Guangnan University this afternoon. “Guangnan University is indeed a famous martial arts school with a long tradition.”</p><p>“I agree. They made it to the national final by ranking the first in the district contest.” Yan Zheke sent back a signing emoji.</p><p>Not knowing what to reply, Lou Cheng changed the subject. “I was watching the video of Wang Ye, my opponent tomorrow as well as a Professional Ninth Pin living in the same hotel with me.”</p><p>Yan Zheke asked, “What is his specialty?”</p><p>“Iron Palm. I googled his previous matches and saw people’s bones crack when they used arms as the defense.” Lou Cheng used a fearful emoji.</p><p>Yan Zheke sent a shocked emoji, “How will you defend? His attack is horrifying…”</p><p>“Judging from the human structure, how people pull their strength and how they practice their martial arts, people would normally use their hands, arms, legs, and feet in defensive stance. Suppose their weapons are destroyed by their opponents, how can they defend themselves?”</p><p>“Anyway, I have never thought about winning him. Now I just hesitate between making side moves to avoid frontal conflict and playing defensive by continuing with the guerrilla hit, looking for breakthroughs then.” Lou Cheng told her his plan.</p><p>“The former required good judgment on moves and martial experiences, while your Listening Skill can only be mastered through physical contact, right?” Yan Zheke gave her opinion.</p><p>Lou Cheng replied with a nodding emoji. “I prefer the latter as well.”</p><p>Once they were physically touched, there was a chance to make a break.</p><p>“You said you wanna be top 16, so your biggest rivals will be the other two, rather than the Iron palm. By the way, how did you know that Professional Ninth Pin master was neglecting his practice in martial arts?” Yan Zheke asked.</p><p>“Because I knew him. He is my friend on Longhu forum…” Lou Cheng honestly answered.</p><p>Yan Zheke sent a smiley with its hands over its mouth. “What a coincidence! You guys could be sworn brothers in ancient times… What kind of martial arts is he good at?”</p><p>“Wuthering Eight Movements,” said Lou Cheng.</p><p>Yan Zheke said, “Wuthering Eight Movements? I happen to know something. Drifting Wind is the footwork and Uninhibited Wind is the dodge skill, while Invisible Wind and Impenetrable Wind are similar with the Biting Chill applied in 24 Blizzard Strikes. Wuthering Wind and Wild Wind are like Brutal Blizzard, which few Listening Skills were required, and Long Juan Zhi Feng (Whirlwind) and Horrifying Hurricane are moves to kill and pull explosive strengths…”</p><p>She talked about her understanding of Wuthering Eight Movements. Lou Cheng then gained deeper insight through what she had talked and the videos he had been watching.</p><p>“Another opponent was specialized in Divine Elephant-simulate Kungfu, powerful in footwork and strength,” Lou spoke out his mind while talking about Tang Yue. “You don’t seem to be in a good mood, you use less emoji today…”</p><p>Yan Zheke sent a miserable emoji, “Yep, I am suffering from a stomachache.”</p><p>“Stomachache? Is anyone around you? Let them take you to the hospital. Do not take medicine without prescriptions or just cope with the pain.” Lou Cheng was so anxious as though he was the one who got sick.</p><p>The silence lasted for seconds, Yan Zheke sent out two words.</p><p>“Silly boy…”</p><p>“Huh? ” Lou Cheng confused.</p><p>“Why am I a silly boy? I just care about you.”</p><p>Yan Zheke sent an emoji with one drawing circles in a corner, “No need for a hospital… Eh… It’s my period.”</p><p>Lou Cheng finally got it, with face blushing immediately.</p><p>“I am such an idiot.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
