Lou Cheng?</p><p>Isn’t that me?</p><p>My next opponent is Invincible Punch from the forum?</p><p>Ideas and thoughts flooded into Lou Cheng’s head. “How magical fate is!” After two knockout rounds, there were still over two hundred fighters left. “What a chance my friend from the forum is to be my opponent?”</p><p>He slid down to read replies. Unparalleled Dragon King, an overseas graduate, wrote, “I’ve googled. No big faction or sect has a disciple called this name. But don’t lower your guard. A no-rank amateur needs more than luck to pass two rounds.”</p><p>Unparalleled Dragon King had an extensive martial arts database covering all fighters in the National University Martial Arts Competitions, but he knew nothing about Lou Cheng.</p><p>Reading his reply, Lou Cheng muttered to himself, “Considering my current experience, my information is only available in the Police Department’s household register and Songcheng University’s Student Center…”</p><p>Road to the Arena sent a funny swelling face. “Rest assured. I’m pretty well experienced. Of course, I know those of no rank are not to be underestimated. No matter how much he looks down upon the amateur ranking event, he won’t give up Professional Ranking Events. So he probably hasn’t reached the level of Professional Ninth Pin! Well, if he’s a hermit with no intention to attend any Professional Ranking Events, why would he sign up for this tournament? If he’s not yet at the level of Professional Ninth Pin, he’s, at best, of the same level with Punch. Why should we worry?”</p><p>“Many factors can affect the result of a fight between two of the same level. You are very confident in Punch!” Beautiful World interrupted.</p><p>Road to the Arena sent a grin. “Of course! Punch is mine! He reached Amateur First Pin over a year ago and had attended two Professional Ranking Events. I’m pretty sure his rich experience is ahead of that Lou Cheng.”</p><p>“Maybe he has also attended a couple of Professional Ranking Events?” Brahman, a young girl who liked to shirk argument replied.</p><p>Pig-Riding Knight, the moderator of the forum, sent a sticker of knocking head. “That Lou Cheng is 18 years old. Having attended two or three Professional Ranking Events would make him 15 or 16 when he achieved the level of Amateur First Pin. His body barely finished growing at that age!”</p><p>Wonton Seller just came to the forum. “I bet ten packs of spicy sticks on Little Punch’s victory!”</p><p>“I bet five cucumbers on Punch’s lose!” Okamoto’s Fan followed up with an amusing emoji just to achieve chaos.</p><p>The live broadcast post soon became a gambling post, with bets varying from five bags of instant noodle to six sausages, almost having Road to the Arena buried in their enthusiasm.</p><p>Road to the Arena posted,</p><p>“I bet a half-naked photo of Punch. If he dares lose, I dare post!”</p><p>After a rough calculation, Lou Cheng found over 80% of members of this forum supporting Invincible Punch. He had the intention to bet five duck necks on his loss, shitting on himself in exchange of some good luck, but soon he remembered the doomsayer Xu Wannian from Shanbei University Martial Arts Club. He decided not to curse himself and pretended he didn’t see this post at all.</p><p>A reply from Yan Zheke with an emoji of untidy hair flying in the wind. “I chatted with my grandma only for seven or eight minutes and you’ve got yourself such a great opponent!”</p><p>“He-heh… I don’t have much luck… You better bless me and strengthen me from now on,” Lou Cheng responded in a joking tone.</p><p>You better be there by my side, lightening me up with your good luck…</p><p>Yan Zheke sent a pondering emoji with its hands crossed under its chin. “Well, we can’t change the draw but we can prepare for the fight. Have you got his information?”</p><p>“Still waiting in line. More spectators today.” Lou Cheng sent a smirk. “I can’t make it to the top 16 or win the prize anyway. I’ve passed two rounds, and I hope my upcoming opponents are one stronger than another so I can gain even better combat experience.”</p><p>Yan Zheke sent a smiley behind hands. “Cheng, you have potential to become a martial arts madman.”</p><p>Lou Cheng came to the front of the counter while chatting. The girl at the service desk gazed at him and handed him the information of Jin Tao the Invincible Punch without asking him any question.</p><p>“You know me?” Lou Cheng was amazed.</p><p>The girl behind the counter smiled. “You are the only one of no rank among all the remaining fighters.”</p><p>“I see.” Lou Cheng came to the realization.</p><p>“Your opponent is of Amateur First Pin. Buck up!” The service desk girl tried to encourage him.</p><p>Lou Cheng was surprised for a second and then smiled. “Thank you!”</p><p>There are many good-hearted people in this world!</p><p>He quickly glanced through the information and picked the important content to share with Yan Zheke. “Jin Tao, 19 years old, a student of Jiuqu Branch of Haiyuan Martial Arts College, of Amateur First Pin. Coach, what do you think?”</p><p>Yan Zheke replied a sparkling sunglasses as if she was part of this. “Haiyuan Martial Arts College… I’ll take a look at their martial arts courses. Hold on…”</p><p>“The internet is the best…” Lou Cheng gave a silent praise. Taking a seat by Ring Two, he opened that gambling post, or the live broadcast post again.</p><p>After lines of nonsense, Above the Sky brought it back on track.</p><p>“How is Little Punch now? Nervous?” asked Above the Sky.</p><p>Road of the Arena answered as if he was the spokesman, “He’s been extremely careful but not nervous. He’s not on his mobile so he can calm his mind and prepare his body for a good fight.”</p><p>“What’s that Lou Cheng’s specialty? Of which level were his previous opponents?” asked Unparalleled Dragon King.</p><p>Road to the Arena used the ridiculous emoji again. “He knocked out the No.one student of Baiyuan Martial Arts School in Yanling and Hu Zheng of Amateur Sixth Pin. From his performance in the first round, his style probably has some restraints on arm boxing. However, I’ve told Little Punch not to assume as we didn’t watch the match. He might be much stronger than the opponent. Better focus on himself and exert the best of his skills. He won’t regret no matter what the result will be.”</p><p>“Err… Focus on himself… So I can’t do the same trick from my last fight yesterday…” Lou Cheng thoughtfully nodded.</p><p>Yan Zheke sent a proud emoji. “Quickly, praise me! I’ve found the martial arts sets taught in Haiyuan Martial Arts College!”</p><p>“Brilliant! Coach! I depend on you today!” Lou Cheng generously praised her, in a slightly exaggerated but also funny way.</p><p>Yan Zheke sent a smiley with its hands over its mouth. “Haiyuan Martial Arts College mainly teaches Tiger style, Bear style, Blast Punch and Shooting Fillip. Outstanding students have the opportunity to learn Nine Illness Hits derived from the lost knowledge of the Plague Sect. Your opponent’s not yet reached Professional Ninth Pin so we don’t need to think about the last one. I’ve gathered detailed introductions of tiger style, bear style, blast punch and shooting fillip along with their corresponding combat videos. Don’t save your data. Take a good look at them.”</p><p>Haiyuan Martial Arts College’s blast punch was quite different from Lou Cheng’s. It was more like lightning and fire stance completed with special force exerting techniques without inner concentration or imagination.</p><p>In ancient times, some martial artists followed imitative styles, pursuing exceptional combat strength by imitating ferocious beasts including tiger, leopard, bear, wolf, snake and divine elephant. Coming to modern times, the technology developed fast and firearms could easily kill any beast. Martial artists of such styles then reformed and turned to imitate guns and cannons, resulting in blast punch and Shooting Fillip of great explosive force as if powered by gunpowder.</p><p>Lou Cheng watched these videos one by one and discussed with Yan Zheke to quickly grasp the essence of the four martial arts styles to avoid suffering from lack of knowledge.</p><p>Time flew by and the eighth match was to take place in Ring Two. Lou Cheng sent Yan Zheke a smiley. “I’m going to calm my mind and adjust the state, and have all the threads of thoughts organized. Talk later.”</p><p>“You can do this!” Yan Zheke replied an encouraging sticker.</p><p>Lou Cheng sent a wicked grin. “I was looking forward to a voice message.”</p><p>“No. That was for yesterday only!” Yan Zheke added a smiley with its hands over its mouth.</p><p>Feeling slightly disappointed, Lou Cheng waited a bit longer before logging out his QQ and putting away his mobile. He concentrated his spirit and qi and put a curb on his emotion, adjusting his body for the match.</p><p>Ten minutes later, the referee in Ring Two announced the winner of Match Eight. Match Nine was about to take place.</p><p>Seven or eight rows higher than Lou Cheng on the stand, Road to the Arena put his phone down and patted Jin Tao the Invincible Punch’s shoulder. “Little Punch, come on! Some members are still betting on your defeat.”</p><p>Jin Tao, the Invincible Punch, took a deep breath and nodded.</p><p>“Master Road, don’t worry. I’m feeling great right now. I won’t dishonor our forum!”</p><p>He stood up and climbed the stairs into Ring Two. “I’m the next!”</p><p>Not far from them, the middle-aged man in a leather jacket suddenly perked up and spoke to his two friends, “About to start!”</p><p>The young couple also straightened their back and pointed at Ring Two while talking to their schoolmates, “The master we’ve been talking about is about to fight!”</p><p>Right next to the ring sat Liu Yinglong with a pair of bright, piercing eyes. He said to his junior brothers and sisters,</p><p>“It’s time to see his true strength.”</p><p>With only five rings left today, spectators on other stands also turned their eyes over.</p><p>Lou Cheng let out a deep breath and opened his eyes, walking down the stairs towards Ring Two. He didn’t want to be disqualified by the referee for being late for his match.</p><p>His cell phone suddenly rang and a familiar ringtone came to his ear.</p><p>“Err…” Lou Cheng took out his mobile and saw Yan Zheke’s name.</p><p>He immediately answered and heard her soft, clear voice,</p><p>“Good luck, Cheng!”</p><p>“Good luck, Cheng…” Lou Cheng was filled with joy. Everything suddenly brightened up, and the passage to Ring Two was coated with a layer of glory.</p><p>Before he could open his mouth, Yan Zheke already hung up.</p><p>Holding the phone, Lou Cheng swaggered towards the second ring, feeling fearless.</p><p>Rainbow comes after wind and rain. Behind a success are flops and failures.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
