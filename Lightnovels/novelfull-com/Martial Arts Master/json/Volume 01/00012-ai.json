Not even during my third year of high school was it this demanding! If I have to wake up at 5:30 every day, how much sleep will I get? Even with the Golden Elixir, I’d probably be so exhausted I’d pee blood!”</p>\n<p>“What’s the matter? You don’t want to wake up early?” Geezer Shi stroked his short white beard. “You’ve already missed the prime age for training your body, yet you want to reach Professional Ninth Pin in two years. If you don’t push yourself and take it easy, how will you make up for lost time? Only hard work can save you, kid. You’ll regret it if you ignore the advice of your elders!”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng fell silent, contemplating the deflated expectations of martial arts that had once filled him. Finally, he nodded. “Getting up isn’t the issue, but the main doors of the dormitory only open at 6:30 a.m.”</p>\n<p>“Not a problem. I’ll arrange for someone to give you the key to the dormitory door,” Geezer Shi dismissed his concerns. “5:30 a.m. is the ideal time to start, based on ancient practices. You must also get enough sleep. So, lights out for you at 10:30 p.m. As your master, I’ll call you to ensure you stick to it.”</p>\n<p>“To be in bed by 10:30 p.m.? But the lights go out at midnight…” Lou Cheng inhaled the cold morning air. This meant almost no time for fun.</p>\n<p>Currently, except for Thursdays and Saturdays, he had classes from 7 p.m. to 9:35 p.m. every night. By the time he returned to the dorm and washed up, it would be nearly 10 p.m. Half an hour hardly sufficed for QQ and forums, let alone gaming. That was impossible.</p>\n<p>Did this mean his only downtime would be between classes and during lunch breaks?</p>\n<p>Skipping classes was out of the question. Lou Cheng couldn’t afford to bring home mediocre grades to his parents.</p>\n<p>“Forget it. It’s all about survival of the fittest, right? No pain, no gain. I’ll give it a term and see how much I progress. Just another third year in high school!” he thought.</p>\n<p>Reluctantly, Lou Cheng replied, “I, I mean, this disciple will go to sleep on time.”</p>\n<p>Geezer Shi tilted his head. “Do you smoke?”</p>\n<p>“Yes,” Lou Cheng admitted, not daring to hide the truth.</p>\n<p>“Quit it!” Geezer Shi ordered. “Your body hasn’t finished training, so alcohol and tobacco are harmful. Just look at Wu Dong from the Martial Arts Club. His body is semi-invalid because of his excesses. You must also stop drinking!”</p>\n<p>“Yes.” These demands were easy for Lou Cheng since he wasn’t a heavy smoker or drinker.</p>\n<p>“How about girls? Do you have a girlfriend?” Geezer Shi pressed on.</p>\n<p>“No…” Lou Cheng hesitated before adding softly, “What if I do?”</p>\n<p>“End it too,” Geezer Shi said sternly.</p>\n<p>“What? I can’t have a girlfriend?” Lou Cheng felt a cold sweat break out.</p>\n<p>Then, Geezer Shi smiled mischievously. “Alright, alright. What I meant was, if you have a girlfriend, you’ll need to plan your martial arts, studies, and dating time carefully. Don’t neglect your relationship and come to me crying when you get dumped. That’s bad for your health too. And control your ‘inner fire’. I know you’re a strong young man, but manage your sexual activity—whether with your girlfriend or by yourself. That’s all for today. Be here at 5:50 tomorrow morning. I’ll teach you some stances from the Shangqing Sect and ‘Ice Sect’. We’ll work on some combinations too.”</p>\n<p>Since the dawn of martial arts, countless sects and styles had emerged. The most renowned was the “Five Sects Unique Skill.” Some skills, though not part of the Taoist Kung Fu, were named after this form, like the “Ice Sect” and “Water Sect.”</p>\n<p>Hearing his master’s plans, Lou Cheng’s earlier complaints about the early mornings vanished.</p>\n<p>After Geezer Shi left, Lou Cheng made a detour back to the Martial Arts Club arena. By the time he arrived, he was the last to check in.</p>\n<p>Compared to yesterday’s class, only a handful had shown up: the year four seniors, Chen Changhua and Wu Dong; year three seniors, Sun Jian, Lin Hua, and Wu Meng; and year two seniors, Jiang Fusheng, Li Mao, and Li Xiaowen. The rest were first-year students, including Lin Que, Guo Qing, Yan Zheke, Xu Qiubai, and Lou Cheng. The fewer seniors were likely due to the increased class load for years two and three, while the year four students were busy job hunting. Additionally, Yan Zheke, the club’s beauty, had drawn several first-year boys to join.</p>\n<p>A quick glance revealed a predominance of men. Besides Yan Zheke, only three other ladies were present: Lin Hua, Li Xiaowen, and Guo Qing. Guo Qing, with her bushy brows, strong arms, and thick thighs, hardly fit the mold of a typical lady. Among the recruits, she was only slightly less formidable than Lin Que and comparable to Cai Zongming, another Amateur Fifth Pin.</p>\n<p>As expected, the graduate students were preoccupied with serving their “bosses” and had no time for club activities.</p>\n<p>“You’re almost late. Go, one round.” Lou Cheng took a deep breath, elbowed through the crowd, and greeted Yan Zheke.</p>\n<p>She offered a tiny smile. “I thought you’d given up after I was tough on you yesterday.”</p>\n<p>“Why would I? I truly love martial arts,” Lou Cheng joked, exaggerating his tone. “I didn’t rest at all yesterday. Last night, I blacked out the moment I hit the bed.”</p>\n<p>That explained why he hadn’t chatted with Yan Zheke.</p>\n<p>Her dimples danced as she smiled. “Me too. Martial arts in the morning, Advanced Mathematics and Introduction to Philosophy in the afternoon, and English at night. By the time I got back to my room, I was tempted to skip the bath and just sleep in my dirty clothes.”</p>\n<p>“Which faculty are you in?” Lou Cheng realized he had never asked.</p>\n<p>“School of Business and Economics…” Before she could finish, Geezer Shi entered the room.</p>\n<p>The first half of the special training session mirrored the martial arts class: stance training, strength training, and footwork practice. Lou Cheng was fully engaged, feeling his movements improve with each practice. Nothing felt better than hard work yielding progress. For strength training, he relied on the Jindan to replenish his energy and continue lifting weights. Even then, he sensed improvement.</p>\n<p>After three hours of intense training, at 11 a.m., Geezer Shi called everyone together and announced gleefully, “Next, we’ll practice how to release energy and the thick-thin moves. The last half hour is for pair practice. Pair up based on your martial arts level. We’re odd-numbered today, so Lin Que, since you’re much higher than the rest, you, Sun Jian, and Xu Qiubai will form one group. Work with them and offer pointers after practicing. Treat this as a coaching opportunity; you’ll learn too.”</p>\n<p>Lin Que nodded silently, showing no signs of disapproval.</p>\n<p>Geezer Shi continued to split the group into pairs. “Guo Qing, you guide Yan Zheke. Lin Hua, you and Li Xiaowen will work together. Li Mao, you and Lou Cheng are a team…”</p>\n<p>Li Mao, a second-year senior with a square face, thick brows, broad shoulders, and a bright smile, approached Lou Cheng. “Junior Lou, looking forward to learning from you.”</p>\n<p>“That should be my line,” Lou Cheng replied courteously, then attempted to change the subject. “Senior brother Li, which Pin do you hold?”</p>\n<p>“The Third Pin,” Li Mao answered proudly.</p>\n<p>“That’s just below Club President Chen, senior brother Wu Dong, and almost the same as senior brother Sun Jian, right? Oh, and before Lin Que joined,” Lou Cheng noted, aware of Chen Changhua and Wu Dong’s ranks. Chen was an Amateur First Pin, aiming for Professional Ninth Pin, but due to an injury, he might not recover in time for the ranking event. Wu Dong was an Amateur Second Pin, a respectable rank for college students.</p>\n<p>Just as Lou Cheng finished speaking, someone sneered loudly. He turned to see Wu Dong, not much taller than Lou Cheng, walking off with the recruit he was supposed to guide.</p>\n<p>Noticing Wu Dong’s cold, unhappy expression, Lou Cheng fell silent. After they had moved away, Li Mao scoffed. “Senior brother Wu Dong, still so sickening.”</p>\n<p>“Excuse me, what did you just say?” Lou Cheng asked, trying to understand.</p>\n<p>Li Mao glanced around before whispering, “A good part of the reason the Martial Arts Club is in its current state is due to Chen Changhua and Wu Dong. They’re narrow-minded and competitive, unable to accept anyone better than them. So, whether senior or junior, if someone shows more potential, they’ll ostracize that person until they leave. We had great members in years two, three, and four, but they wasted a year without sufficient practice, and with tighter schedules, they can’t move up.”</p>\n<p>He chuckled at himself and continued, “If it weren’t for my good relationship with senior brother Sun Jian, I’d probably be out of here, pouring my heart into vocational studies.”</p>\n<p>“Senior brother Sun Jian has a hold over Chen Changhua and Wu Dong?” Lou Cheng was disturbed and surprised by the club’s dynamics.</p>\n<p>“Although Senior brother Sun Jian and I are both Amateur Three Pin, his father is a professor here. So, naturally, Chen Changhua and Wu Dong wouldn’t dare cross him. The only thing is, senior brother Sun Jian doesn’t meddle too much, so he just helps Lin Hua and me. And yes, Lin Hua is his girlfriend,” Li Mao explained.</p>\n<p>This meant the rest, Wu Meng, Jiang Fusheng, and Li Xiaowen, remained because they were mediocre. It was clear they were only Amateur Fifth Pins and posed no threat to Chen Changhua and Wu Dong’s positions.</p>\n<p>“I see, no wonder Cai Zongming, an Amateur Fifth Pin, would be called up by the Martial Arts Club,” Lou Cheng realized. “Fortunately, we have Lin Que in our batch, bringing Chen Changhua down a peg.”</p>\n<p>Li Mao laughed. “That’s why you can focus on training without worrying about Chen Changhua and Wu Dong. Now, let’s get back to teaching you some moves and ways to release energy.”</p>\n<p>Though they called them moves, they were basic techniques: straight punches, elbows, and knees, combined with energy release methods. The critical part of this training was matching them. If footwork and posture didn’t align, even the simplest moves wouldn’t channel energy effectively.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng paid close attention. Thanks to his Yin-Yang Stance, his coordination of moves, footwork, and posture was well above that of a typical beginner. He learned quickly, growing more familiar with the moves and combinations as he practiced.</p>\n<p>Soon, only half an hour remained in the special training session. Li Mao halted Lou Cheng’s practice and called for Geezer Shi to join them.</p>\n<p>“Junior Lou, let’s spar. Don’t worry; I’ll be reasonable with my moves.”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng’s muscles tensed, a mix of panic and excitement coursing through him. This would be his first sparring practice!</p>",
