  "body": "<p>The air was crisp, a chill settling in as late autumn approached. Lou Cheng stood there, jacket in hand, feeling an inexplicable warmth wash over him. It was a strange sensation, reminiscent of the anxiety that gripped him before a daunting college entrance exam.</p>\n<p>He leaned closer to the shimmering, translucent “Jindan.” Holding his breath, he bent down, cautious. Wrapping his right hand in his jacket, he reached out to touch it. The moment his fingers made contact, he was struck by its solidity. The cold and heat he perceived were mere illusions, not the reality he had expected.</p>\n<p>Pressing a bit harder, he felt the Jindan yield slightly. It appeared so light, almost weightless, yet the sensation was entirely different upon touch.</p>\n<p>Panic surged within him. He stared intently at the Jindan, now cradled in his jacket-wrapped palm. It spun gently, a mesmerizing swirl of ice crystals and flames, devoid of the cruelty that had once tormented the black carp.</p>\n<p>“It’s magic,” Lou Cheng thought, his heart racing as he pondered the transformation. “Maybe the black carp absorbed the harshness of the Jindan…”</p>\n<p>With the immediate danger averted, his mind raced with possibilities. Was this truly a Jindan? Even if it was, what power did it hold? “Should I hand it over to the authorities and gain nothing? Or should I hide it, seek knowledge, and use it to change my life? Concealing it is risky, but so is living a life without achievement.”</p>\n<p>“If I choose to hide it, where would I keep it safe?”</p>\n<p>As these thoughts spiraled, Lou Cheng realized he needed to leave this place quickly, regardless of his decision. The fear of unforeseen events loomed over him.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, he felt the Jindan pulse in his palm, expanding and contracting like a breath. The rhythm seemed to sync with his own.</p>\n<p>“It’s adjusting?”</p>\n<p>Confusion clouded his mind as he sensed the Jindan’s movements resonating with his breath, creating a harmonious connection.</p>\n<p>“Resonance?”</p>\n<p>The realization struck him as the Jindan became ethereal, transforming into a stream of light that flowed into his palm, slipping through the thin barrier of his jacket.</p>\n<p>“What is happening?” Lou Cheng’s heart raced, terror gripping him as he recalled the fate of the black carp.</p>\n<p>He stumbled back, thoughts scattered, and dashed toward the school hospital by the lakeside, not pausing to consider if the doctors could help him.</p>\n<p>After a frantic sprint, he gradually calmed down, recognizing that fear only drained his energy. As he steadied his breath, an odd sensation stirred in his lower stomach. A warm current surged, easing the fatigue from his run. His breaths slowed, and he felt invigorated, ready to run another three thousand meters without pause, free from the earlier extremes of heat and cold.</p>\n<p>“This…” Lou Cheng inhaled deeply, slowing his pace as he glanced down at his stomach.</p>\n<p>Bending slightly, a vision flickered in his mind. Beneath his navel, the Dantian, lay the Jindan. It pulsed with a cosmic energy, expanding and contracting with his breath, flames and ice swirling in a vibrant dance.</p>\n<p>The vision vanished, leaving him staring at his dark blue T-shirt. He lifted it, revealing his usual soft belly, as if he had just feasted.</p>\n<p>As he slowed to a stop, the warmth in his lower stomach faded.</p>\n<p>“Does the Jindan restore my strength when I’m weary?” Lou Cheng pondered, intrigued. “This could be a blessing. It doesn’t seem malevolent, but then again, humans and black carp are worlds apart…”</p>\n<p>After a moment of contemplation, he relaxed, his expression softening. The previous turmoil had dissipated.</p>\n<p>“Let’s test this again…” He resolved, turning back to retrace his steps.</p>\n<p>Running was tiring, a fact as certain as mortality. Soon, exhaustion crept in, but just then, the familiar warmth surged in his Dantian, revitalizing him.</p>\n<p>“This is incredible! I could even join the school’s distance race if I keep this up…” Joy began to replace his worries as he paused before the lifeless black carp.</p>\n<p>After a moment’s thought, he bent down, filled the carp with stones, and returned it to Weishui Lake.</p>\n<p>With that done, he walked back along the lakeside path to the boys’ dormitory.</p>\n<p>As he walked, Lou Cheng felt a mix of excitement and anxiety. He had discovered a treasure, one that could elevate him within the martial arts club and perhaps win Yan Zheke’s admiration. Yet, the risks of the Jindan haunted him, and he feared meeting the same fate as the black carp. His steps alternated between light and heavy.</p>\n<p>“I’ll investigate first. If anything goes wrong, I’ll hand it over to the authorities.” Standing at the door of room 302, he took a deep breath, steeling himself, and unlocked the door.</p>\n<p>From a hidden path by Weishui Lake, an elderly figure approached. Dressed in a worn T-shirt, he paused near where the black carp had been. His white hair contrasted with the few wrinkles on his face.</p>\n<p>“Something feels off here,” the old man murmured, scanning the area.</p>\n<p>After a moment, he shook his head and retrieved a silver flask, taking a hearty swig before wandering off, humming a tune.</p>\n<p>Back in the dormitory, Lou Cheng fretted over whether Cai Zongming had returned. He stepped into the bedroom, flicking on the light, dispelling the darkness. He closed the door and sat before the computer, staring blankly at the screen.</p>\n<p>His mind raced with thoughts, searching for reassurance. He had never faced anything like this before, and the potential danger left him unsettled.</p>\n<p>You only live once, yet the world is so beautiful.</p>\n<p>Despite the allure of benefits and opportunities, his worries weighed heavily on him.</p>\n<p>Feeling overwhelmed, Lou Cheng gritted his teeth and instinctively dialed a familiar number.</p>\n<p>“Hello, son?” A warm, slightly husky voice greeted him.</p>\n<p>“Mom, it’s me.” Hearing her voice brought a lump to his throat, easing the fear that had gripped him.</p>\n<p>In tough times, thoughts of family always comforted him, reminding him of their struggles.</p>\n<p>“Is something wrong? Your voice sounds off,” his mother asked, concern evident.</p>\n<p>Tears threatened to spill, but Lou Cheng forced a smile. “No, just a bit homesick.”</p>\n<p>“Homesick? Didn’t I ask if you wanted to come home before the holiday? You don’t have to be alone,” she replied, her tone motherly. “Do you need money?”</p>\n<p>His mood sank further as he explained, “I miss you and Dad, the braised pork with eggplant, the quick-fried eel, the tomato and egg soup you make, even the garlic I planted on the balcony…”</p>\n<p>The thought of dying like the black carp felt pitiful.</p>\n<p>His mother paused, her voice trembling. “We miss you too. Why do you have to make your mother cry?”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng chuckled, feeling the tension ease. “Who would dare do that? By the way, where’s Dad?”</p>\n<p>Back in third grade, his father’s company had struggled. Despite his value, he received only a base salary. The family relied on his mother’s market stall, enduring hardships together. When Lou Cheng entered middle school, his father took on a part-time job but struggled to stay in one place due to his pride. Eventually, Lou Cheng’s mother became the family’s backbone, her hard work leaving a lasting impression on him.</p>\n<p>Things improved when Lou Cheng reached high school, as his father found stability as a technical director. Yet, his mother remained active in the community, working alongside older women.</p>\n<p>“Don’t you know your dad? He’s been playing chess for an hour every day after meals,” she replied, a hint of annoyance in her voice. Her concern for Lou Cheng’s well-being was clear as she inquired about his studies and life.</p>\n<p>“Is your course schedule tight? Do the teachers teach well? Are the classes difficult? How are your roommates? Is anyone bothering you?”</p>\n<p>In the past, Lou Cheng had brushed off her questions, but today, he felt nostalgic and answered each one thoughtfully. His mother shared family gossip, from Grandpa’s household to Aunt’s, and Lou Cheng listened with a smile, chiming in occasionally.</p>\n<p>As their conversation wrapped up, his mother generously offered him an extra 800 yuan for the month to help with college life.</p>\n<p>“Who knew a call home could lift my spirits so much…” Lou Cheng thought, relief washing over him. The pressure and unease faded. “So far, the Jindan doesn’t seem dangerous. As long as I’m cautious and report any issues, I should be fine…”</p>\n<p>With newfound confidence, Lou Cheng touched his belly, letting his imagination soar.</p>\n<p>“With the Jindan, I could gain enough strength to practice martial arts and reach Amateur Fifth Pin or Sixth Pin, impressing Yan Zheke. Maybe I could even achieve Professional Ninth Pin before graduation, opening more job opportunities.”</p>\n<p>“If the Jindan is more powerful than I expect, could I enter the martial arts world I dreamed of as a child? Compete with the Mighty Ones and earn one of the five revered titles across the country?”</p>\n<p>“Oh, if little Ming saw me like this, he’d think I was pregnant!”</p>\n<p>Lost in these thoughts, Lou Cheng felt a surge of confidence. Just then, the door handle turned, and several lively voices filled the room. He recognized the three “brainiacs” returning from their studies.</p>",
