  "body": "<p>In his dream, Lou Cheng felt his martial skills soaring. In just a few years, he gained recognition throughout the professional martial arts world. As a rising star, he defeated Qian Donglou and earned the title of Martial Lord. He stood alongside Chen Qitao, the Dragon King, at the pinnacle of Chinese martial arts. Surrounded by adoring fans and supported by various groups, he was pursued by many beautiful girls. Yet, Lou remained true to his principles and followed his heart, even amidst temptations. Eventually, he walked down the aisle with Yan Zheke, enveloped in the blessings of their friends Cai Zongming, Zhao Qiang, Qiu Zhigao, and Zhang Jingye, as well as the hopes of his weary parents.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, Lou Cheng felt a strange sensation. His skin scorched black, veins pulsing with fiery energy beneath. A chill enveloped his back, as if he were trapped inside an iceberg, reminiscent of a dead black fish.</p>\n<p>Fear gripped him as he turned, catching Yan Zheke’s gaze. Her eyes reflected confusion and horror.</p>\n<p>“Ahh!”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng jolted awake, curling up on his side in bed. A soft beam of light filtered through the window, barely illuminating the dark dorm room. The familiar surroundings—the bed, desk, chair, and mosquito net—felt both comforting and strange. He lingered in the fleeting pleasure of the dream.</p>\n<p>After a moment of confusion, he took several deep breaths, slowly realizing where he was and what had happened.</p>\n<p>“A nightmare…” Lou Cheng murmured, gazing out the window as dawn broke. The dream faded, but the emotions of desire and fear lingered vividly.</p>\n<p>He picked up his phone and turned on the screen—still not yet seven. He longed to fall back asleep but found it impossible. He tossed and turned until the clock struck seven, then finally got out of bed. Leaving his small bedroom, he headed to the lavatory.</p>\n<p>After a hurried routine, he settled into the living room. He browsed through posts on the forum from the previous night, smiles creeping onto his face as he calmed down. Excitement about his martial progress from consuming the Jindan bubbled up, along with anticipation for today’s martial arts lesson and Yan Zheke’s warm message: “See you tomorrow.”</p>\n<p>With a flutter of excitement, Lou Cheng returned to his small dorm room. He ignored Zhao Qiang, who was groggily waking up to study English, and pulled out a new martial arts suit from his wardrobe.</p>\n<p>This Longhu Club suit was a graduation gift from high school. The navy blue design blended traditional and modern styles, looking elegant yet simple. It resembled a leotard but was loose enough to allow freedom of movement. It made the wearer appear formidable, provided he didn’t look too defeated.</p>\n<p>After adjusting his cuffs and trouser legs, Lou Cheng walked back to the lavatory in his martial arts suit. He gazed at himself in the mirror, where a green dragon and a white tiger intertwined in an emblem on his left chest, symbolizing the club's power.</p>\n<p>Styling his hair with water, he grinned at his reflection. “Not bad!”</p>\n<p>“What a narcissist,” Cai Zongming quipped, yawning as he entered.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng clicked his tongue. “The one who uses men’s skincare products every day is the real narcissist!”</p>\n<p>“Come on! I have to take care of my face,” Cai Zongming replied, heading to the toilet. He clearly woke up to relieve himself after last night’s drinking, unlike Lou Cheng and Zhao Qiang, who were up early.</p>\n<p>Zhao Qiang rolled his eyes at their banter while washing up. He watched Cai Zongming enter the toilet and remarked as the door closed, “You two would excel in cross-talk. It’s never too early for you!”</p>\n<p>“Ha-hah,” Lou Cheng laughed. “Little Ming will bring down the roof if I don’t teach him some lessons now and then!”</p>\n<p>He stepped out, slipping into a black pair of exercise shoes, waiting for Cai Zongming to join him for breakfast.</p>\n<p>While waiting, he logged into his QQ account, eager to chat with Yan Zheke but hesitant to come on too strong. He quickly checked messages from several freshman groups and his class before scrolling through updates from friends. To his surprise, Yan Zheke had just posted ten minutes ago:</p>\n<p>“Sleepy but very happy! Today I will treat everyone to breakfast for those who sleep in. You’re welcome!”</p>\n<p>“How adorable!” Lou Cheng murmured to himself, gently tapping his face. How could he have forgotten to check Yan Zheke’s old posts yesterday?</p>\n<p>It would satisfy his curiosity about her and help him understand her better!</p>\n<p>As Lou Cheng browsed through Yan Zheke’s past moments, Cai Zongming approached, yawning. “Cheng, look at that mischievous grin. You must be up to something. What are you reading?”</p>\n<p>“Nothing,” Lou Cheng replied with a smile, signing out and putting his phone away.</p>\n<p>Cai Zongming glanced at him, shaking his head. “This is what we call amorous!”</p>\n<p>The two continued their playful banter as they left the dorm for the nearest canteen, eager for soy milk, tea eggs, and steamed buns before heading to the Martial Arts Club.</p>\n<p>The teaching buildings and living quarters of Songcheng University were separated. The three-story office building by the lake housed the university management. On the third floor, in a room marked “Dean’s,” a black-haired senior in his 50s began his day with a tea ceremony. Opposite him sat an unruly man, perhaps in his 70s or even 80s. Dressed in an old white t-shirt, the old man had completely white hair but few wrinkles.</p>\n<p>His eyes were half-closed, savoring the drifting fragrance of the tea.</p>\n<p>“Ah… Ah-choo!”</p>\n<p>A loud sneeze echoed through the office, causing the black-haired man to nearly drop his purple clay teapot.</p>\n<p>“Can’t you stay quiet for five minutes?” the suited senior asked, annoyance creeping into his voice.</p>\n<p>The old man rubbed his nose. “I’d be quiet like your old dog if you poured me a shot of strong liquor.”</p>\n<p>“Well, you can pick a bottle from my wine cellar if you manage to take the Martial Arts Club to the national tournament. Pick three if you make it to the top eight. Have a sleepover if you win the championship,” the suited senior declared, waving his hand dramatically. “As Principal of the University and a martial arts enthusiast, I see this as my last chance to see the Songcheng University Martial Arts Club rise again!”</p>\n<p>The old man swallowed, letting out a brief chuckle. “Deal! Considering our brotherhood, I’ll do my best without you asking. Wait for my good news!”</p>\n<p>After watching the old man leave, the Principal waited five more minutes before making a phone call. “Hey, Yuejian. Your dad didn’t hold back.”</p>\n<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll keep him busy. He won’t be idle at home any longer.”</p>\n<p>“No need. I’ve known your father since childhood!”</p>\n<p>In the grove by the lake, the old man gazed at the waves, his ears twitching gently. He took a sip from a metal wine flask and sighed, a faint smile gracing his lips.</p>\n<p>Inside the Martial Arts Club gym, attendance for the first martial arts lesson was high. Even Lou Cheng’s roommate Qiu Zhigao showed up.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng scanned the room for Yan Zheke, ignoring Cai Zongming’s quiet complaints about his daydreaming. Finally, he spotted Yan Zheke stepping out of the girls’ locker room. Her black hair was tied up, and she wore a white martial arts suit adorned with the same emblem of the entwined dragon and tiger, a different version of the Longhu Club’s attire.</p>\n<p>When their eyes met, smiles spread across their faces, delighted by their matching outfits.</p>\n<p>Just as Lou Cheng was about to approach Yan for a quick chat, Chen Changhua, the sturdy Martial Arts Club Manager with bushy eyebrows, emerged from the men’s locker room, followed by the slender and fresh Lin Que. Their expressions were tense.</p>\n<p>“Stand in line and get ready. The new coach will arrive any moment,” Chen Changhua shouted.</p>\n<p>With military training behind them, all members quickly formed a line. Lin Que casually strolled to the front of Lou Cheng’s column, despite Chen Changhua’s disapproving glare.</p>\n<p>A shadowy figure appeared at the gym entrance, revealing itself as an old, clumsy man in a worn-out white t-shirt and white hair. His skin looked surprisingly good, with fewer wrinkles than expected.</p>\n<p>“Master Shi,” Chen Changhua greeted him, stepping forward.</p>\n<p>The old man nodded and gestured for him to join the team. Facing the crowd, the new coach spoke after a few coughs. “My family name is Shi, which means to offer. From today, kids, I’ll be your martial coach. You can call me Coach Shi or Geezer Shi. I’m easygoing and approachable, respecting the elderly and cherishing the youth.”</p>\n<p>Respect for the elderly? Lou Cheng thought silently. “Quite hard to find someone older than you, isn’t it?” He exchanged a glance with Cai Zongming, who seemed to share the same sentiment.</p>\n<p>Geezer Shi continued with a grin, “Regional matches for the National University Martial Arts Competitions will start in November. The Principal expects us to perform better this year. Three martial arts lessons per week aren’t enough. I plan to gather our promising members for daily special training from eight to noon. Don’t worry; the Principal has agreed to rearrange your morning classes if you commit to the morning training. Maybe evenings too.”</p>\n<p>His words sent shockwaves through the crowd. Members whispered in disbelief.</p>\n<p>“Training every morning with no days off… Heh… What about games, relationships, and leisure?” Cai Zongming muttered quietly.</p>\n<p>First-year students had relatively light schedules. However, dedicating all morning hours to martial practice would leave them little free time for anything else.</p>\n<p>Listening to the murmurs, Lou Cheng fell into an odd silence. He simply nodded at Cai Zongming’s complaints.</p>\n<p>Geezer Shi pulled out a sheet with the names of members and called out loudly, “Lin Que, are you in?”</p>\n<p>Lin replied coldly, “Yes.”</p>\n<p>“Good. Next, Chen Changhua. What about you?” continued Geezer Shi.</p>\n<p>Chen glanced at Lin Que, anger simmering beneath his calm exterior. “Yes!”</p>\n<p>“Wu Dong, what about you?”</p>\n<p>“Yes!”</p>\n<p>“Sun Jian?”</p>\n<p>“Yes!”</p>\n<p>“Lin Hua?”</p>\n<p>“Yes!”</p>\n<p>“Li Mao?”</p>\n<p>“Yes!”</p>\n<p>Geezer Shi called out names of students ranked Amateur Sixth Pin or higher from sophomore to senior year. Most chose to participate, while a few declined.</p>\n<p>“Cai Zongming,” he said, reaching the freshmen.</p>\n<p>Cai replied without hesitation, “Coach, I’ll have to decline. Studying is more important!”</p>\n<p>Geezer Shi moved on, unfazed. “Qiu Zhigao?”</p>\n<p>“I… I can’t,” Qiu Zhigao stammered.</p>\n<p>“Guo Qing?”</p>\n<p>“Yes!”</p>\n<p>Geezer Shi took a sip from his wine pot. “Of course, the Martial Arts Club is open to all. Students below Amateur Sixth Pin are also welcome to join the special training. As the saying goes, participation matters, and improving physical fitness is key. Requirements for these students will be lowered. So… Anyone? Raise your hand.”</p>\n<p>Members exchanged glances, remaining silent. A passion for martial arts was one thing, but sacrificing all free time for rigorous training was another. The special training would still be demanding, even with lowered requirements.</p>\n<p>In the tense silence, a hand shot up unexpectedly. Cai Zongming turned, shocked to see it was Lou Cheng.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng declared, “Coach Shi, I want to join the special training!”</p>\n<p>His voice resonated through the gym.</p>\n<p>If running could help the Golden Elixir function slowly, perhaps intense martial arts training would aid its absorption by his body.</p>",
