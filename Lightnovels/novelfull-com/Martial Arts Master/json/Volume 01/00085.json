Long gone were their arrogance and their ruthlessness on their faces, as they slowly looked more like their real ages. They held their breath as they looked at their master, Ning Xunli, with rapt attention, waiting for him to make the judgment.</p><p>The first competition video which Ning Xunli had watched was the one where Lou Cheng fought against Ye Youting. The first few minutes of the battle did not shock him, but when Lou Cheng suddenly started his rage attacks, it looked as if thousands of years of accumulated snow had collapsed down onto the opponent, which struck everyone with fear. This had instantly caught his attention which cleared his usual blurry vision as he unconsciously let out a sigh of disbelief.</p><p>“This kind of outburst… was it a final skill that he had left after draining all his energy, or was it an awakening of his potential?” he murmured to himself. He did not say much after that as he quickly closed that video and watched other battle videos that were available—Lou Cheng VS Zhou Yuanning, Lou Cheng VS Wang Ye, Lou Cheng VS Wu Shitong, Lou Cheng VS Jin Tao.</p><p>While watching, Ning Xunli gasped and said,</p><p>“Mercurial balance, mercurial balance, he had mastered mercurial balance! This means his meditation skill had reached the highest stage?”</p><p>“Listening skill… This listening skill is not something to be overlooked as well… ”</p><p>“To be able to consecutively carry out so many f*cking series of 24 Blizzard Strikes, he must be, must be a freak!”</p><p>Every sentence that he blurted out in awe had struck Zhou Zhengyao and other disciples hard on their chests like a drum, causing blood to gradually drained from all their faces, and their expressions stiffened with dismay.</p><p>The handphone’s display screen darkened as it auto-locked itself. Ning Xunli kept silent for a long time. When the middle-sized bus turned into the SC district, he looked at Yao Kang, handed the phone to him and said, “Not bad, you had done well this time. Your reaction was pretty fast then.”</p><p>After praising Yao Kang, he sighed and said to all his disciples,</p><p>“Gushan Martial Arts School is really something, never thought that they could be so cunning to dig a trap for us to fall in. Luckily Yao was alert and discovered it, or all our efforts would have gone down the drain.”</p><p>Else why would they hire a fighter of Professional Ninth Pin with unique abilities to interfere their opponent’s leading player? It was for them to defeat Gushan Martial Arts School in front of Chairman Wei Renjie so that they could leave a deep impression in his mind and also win over more sponsors for future preliminaries. This would not only help them regarding finance, but also their standing in Xiushan martial arts community, which would provide them with a lot of benefits.</p><p>As such, a condition was stated that the martial arts school which had won in the preliminary would have a higher chance of obtaining the dominant right for the next preliminary. With the government’s support, and numerous sponsorship available, the school would easily become Xiushan’s uncrowned “Master of the Martial Arts Realm”.</p><p>Say if Zhou Zhengyao had got the limelight just now and was immediately snatched over by Lou Cheng, how would Chairman Wei Renjie think of the situation?</p><p>Zhou Zhengyao, who was still in a shocking state, patted on Yao Kang’s shoulder and said, “I used to think that Yao Kang’s addiction to the internet was a bad thing, but now I realize that everything has its pros.”</p><p>After Yao Kang was continuously flattered by both his master and his strongest senior, he felt that he was on cloud nine, and he blurted out, “It’s also lucky that we had set a trap to defeat Gushan Martial Arts School, or it is unimaginable how the outcome will be like. Just now what they did was just putting hopes on making great losses on both sides.”</p><p>“Master, from the videos, what do you think is Lou Cheng’s level? as, as compared with that person?” Zhou Zhengyao asked. Though he felt a sense of relief, he could not hide his curiosity.</p><p>Ning Xunli pondered and spoke, “His body has not reached the level of Professional Ninth Pin.”</p><p>“How could it be? Then how could he defeat a Professional Ninth Pin opponent?” A disciple cried out, not believing what he had just heard.</p><p>Ning Xunli’s vision became blurry again as he sighed and spoke, “This’s a direct intuitive feeling you get when you are still young and inexperienced. If you all can get to meet with more young and strong Professional Ninth Pin fighters, and not a sickly old man like me, then I’m sure you all will be clear about Lou Cheng’s situation. As long as he hadn’t exhibited the power of ‘Danqi State’, it’ll be easy for us determine his level.”</p><p>“Haiz, I guess all of you will need to participate in preliminaries. Even if there isn’t any funding, all of you should also participate. Else if you all keep staying in a small place like Xiushan and never meet any experts from the outside, it’ll only limit your exposure.”</p><p>Seeing that his master spoke with much certainty, Zhou Zhengyao chose to believe him. He pondered and asked, “Then how did he defeat the Professional Ninth Pin?”</p><p>Do I have the chance to defeat him as well?</p><p>“I guess he is talented in both meditation skill and physical strength. The former had allowed him to acquire a strong listening skill and the ability of mercurial balance, which is the basis of Danqi State. The latter helps him to carry out his strongest strikes without having to worry about the lack of strength. As long as he is capable of executing his potential to restrain his opponent, there’s nothing strange about him winning the battle.” Ning Xunli sighed and added, “Zhengyao, don’t look down on him just because he doesn’t have a body quality of a Professional Ninth Pin. If he and you were to battle, there’s only one outcome, which is you being defeated. As for how terrible the defeat will be, it’s dependable on how you perform in the battle.”</p><p>Zhou Zhengyao felt a sense of relief again and commented, “It’s lucky that we didn’t fight, else the outcome will be unimaginable… ”</p><p>And that will be too embarrassing!</p><p>Seeing that Yao Kang and other disciples looked at him with their curious yet frightened eyes, Ning Xunli continued, “Well, if compare him with that person, I’m not too sure how his last outburst comes about so it will be hard to make any judgment. I can only say that person’s potential is far greater than his.”</p><p>The disciples nodded their heads as everyone had different thoughts on their minds. All of a sudden, Zhou Zhengyao’s expression changed as he said in a deep voice, “Will Gushan Martial Arts School promote him as the chief commander for the preliminaries? He had graduated from No.1 Middle School, it is very likely that he’s an expert born and bred in Xiushan!”</p><p>If that’s the case, all the hard work that his master, his fellow disciples and him had put in to stand an advantage in this preliminary will gone down the drain.</p><p>The teams formed for the preliminaries would need to seek for the chief commander’s opinion!</p><p>This fact suddenly awakened Yao Kang and the other disciples. They had never expected Gushan Martial Arts School to strike at the root of the trouble, and this caused them to feel a sense of panic. According to their original plan, they had thought of making use of this dominant right after obtaining it, by electing the Professional Mighty Ones that they had good relationships with for future preliminaries.</p><p>“Master, do you need us to contact some of the Professional Mighty Ones from Xiushan?” One disciple quickly asked.</p><p>Ning Xunli waved his hand, and his eyes remained calm as he uttered, “No hurry, to determine the chief commander at such early stage won’t benefit any of the martial arts schools, and all of you just go and think about is yourself. Furthermore, Lou Cheng won’t accept the offer of being the chief commander.”</p><p>“Why? Why are you so certain about it since you don’t know him, Master?” Yao Kang asked, feeling puzzled.</p><p>Ning Xunli sniggered and explained. “For a person who has the capability of a professional fighter in 18 years old, and has acquired with the talent of meditation and physical strength, do you think this kind of people will be bothered with being the chief commander for the preliminaries in a small place like Xiushan? Moreover, he’s attending a college located outside of Xiushan, isn’t it tiring for him to return here once or twice every week?”</p><p>“Money makes the mare go… as long as the conditions fit his needs, and this is for the team in his hometown, why not? Afterall, the purpose of studying in college is to earn more money, isn’t it?” Zhou Zhengyao rebutted with a frown.</p><p>Ning Xunli responded calmly, “His skill, 24 Blizzard Strikes, has already reached a pretty high standard. It’s obvious that he has inherited it from someone and this skill definitely can be developed even further. If he needs more actual combat experience, there’re a lot of other ways, and for now, he needn’t worry much about money as well.”</p><p>“Alright, let’s not talk about this matter in future. I suppose he had helped Gushan Martial Arts School because of his classmate, Qin Rui. With great potential and skill inheritance, there’s a possibility that he might become a high-ranked Dan State shortly. If we’re unable to make him join us, we shouldn’t offend him either. Since we’ll not be in the same community for a long period, there’ll not be any conflict of interest, why cause unnecessary disputes due to personal feelings? Do you understand what I’m saying?”</p><p>Zhou Zhengyao, Yao Kang and other disciples solemnly nodded their heads and replied, “Understood!”</p><p>Honestly, after realizing that a young chap like Lou Cheng could be so powerful, Zhou Zhengyao, as one of the young generation experts in Xiushan, felt fear, envy, and hatred. He was worried that someone would snatch his limelight and take over his position. Now that he had heard his master’s explanation, he felt peace at once, and had even felt respectful towards Lou Cheng.</p><p>Yeah, we won’t be in the same community, what’s there to dispute about?</p><p>Meanwhile, Ning Xunli half-closed his eyes once more, as always. In his heart, he sighed and thought to himself,</p><p>Of course, you guys won’t be in the same community, how can a sparrow and a swan belong to the same community?</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the free KTV room at the conference villa, under Jiang Fei’s and Lou Cheng’s persuasion and disturbance, Qiu Hailin had gracefully sang an oldie with Cheng Qili, their beautiful and unique voices echoed in the room.</p><p>While listening to the song, Lou Cheng kept his handphone in his hand. He was chatting with Yan Zheke about the prior incident and was about to come to the end of that topic. “It’s a pity that something had happened to Mingwei Martial Arts School at that moment, or I would have the chance to show off my power to my classmates, and let them be amazed!”</p><p>Yan Zheke sent a “covering mouth” emoji, smiled and replied, “That’s right, that’s right. I am still waiting for Young Hero Lou to make a brilliant appearance that amazed the whole of Xiushan, and let me take pride in it. By then, I’d be able to prove to those classmates who did not believe me and tell them, See! Look at this! Lou Cheng from next door is that genius I’ve told you about!”</p><p>“Damn, I’ve just missed such opportunity like this.” Lou Cheng cried as he purposely sent an emoji that showed one beating the chest and stomping the feet.</p><p>Yan Zheke replied with a “touching one’s head” emoji, “Actually it’s also good not to fight. If you’ve gotten yourself into the dispute between the martial arts schools and the choosing of dominance right for the preliminaries matter, I believe it’ll be very troublesome. Oh yeah, what are you doing? Is the classmate gathering fun?”</p><p>“What am I doing? Chatting with you, of course!” Lou Cheng sent “an evil grin” and added, “The interesting thing about classmate gathering is actually to gather together to chit chat, talking about the past and rumors that were spread during school days.”</p><p>Yan Zheke replied with a “sitting in dazed and nodding her head” emoji, “Yup, sometimes I really miss the life in high school. Does this mean that we are getting old, since the older you get, the more you miss the past… ”</p><p>“I feel that it’s more of feeling reluctant to change your life and your old self.” Lou Cheng joked while trying hard not to laugh.</p><p>Miss, you are only 18!</p><p>Some more, you’re almost a year younger than me. My birthday is 2 February, whereas yours is 9 December!</p><p>Come to think of it, it’s almost my birthday…</p><p>During Yan Zheke’s birthday, he had only wished her a happy birthday as their relationship was yet this close, and he did not dare to give her any present…</p><p>“Nice saying… but don’t you think of avoiding my question. I was asking what you are all playing now!” Yan Zheke demanded and purposely sent him “a furious face”.</p><p>Lou Cheng snickered and replied, “Fatty Jiang and the others are singing karaoke, while I am sitting at a corner chatting with you.”</p><p>“Heehee, why aren’t you singing? Thought you mentioned that you’re a Mic King?” Yan Zheke asked, laughing.</p><p>Lou Cheng thought for a moment before he carefully replied with an ambiguous flirtatious answer, “You got to know your priorities right. How is singing karaoke more important than chatting with you?”</p><p>Yan Zheke sent “an evil grin” without saying much.</p><p>They chatted for a while, before her responses started to slow down. This was because she had followed her relatives to fetch her parents, who were finally on leave and had flown to Jiangnan to join them. Also, she had missed her parents. As such, Lou Cheng was left with nothing to do.</p><p>Just then, two figures stood in front of him. Qiu Hailin and Cao Lele saw that he had finally put down his phone, came over to chat with him, “Cheng, chatting with your girlfriend? Till you don’t even join us in singing anymore?”</p><p>As the voices reverberated in the room, they had to come closer to converse.</p><p>“Haha, not yet my girlfriend but soon. Still working on it.” Lou Cheng told them honestly, as he felt that there was no need for him to keep it a secret that he was in love with a girl, though he did not mention Yan Zheke’s name to avoid any embarrassing situation.</p><p>Qiu Hailin made an “oh” sound and added, “Then you got to work hard on it, our Du Liyu is already attached. Come on, join us, and don’t just keep listening to us singing!”</p><p>“Yeah, Cheng, come, sing duet with me for the ‘Little Apple’.” Jiang Fei joined them in the commotion during the intervals between songs.</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled without rejecting the offer, stood up and took over the microphone.</p><p>After singing a few songs, he felt that the air in the room was stuffy, so he went out to get some fresh air.</p><p>Gazing at his back, Qiu Hailin huddled beside Cao Lele, sighed with emotion and whispered, “Cheng looked really different.”</p><p>“Haha, not as much as you.” Cao Lele joked.</p><p>Qiu Hailin shook her head and said, “Not the same, not the same. I’ve only changed my style of dressing which makes me look different, but his changes are from inside-out, making him a man of mettle!”</p><p>“True, I’ve shared desk with Lou Cheng for two years. I don’t consider him as a boring person since you can still talk and joke with him, but he’s totally different now. Last time he seemed to be lack of self-confidence, lack of generosity when handling matters and lack of courage.” Cao Lele recalled. She was an observant lady.</p><p>Qiu Hailin teased, “Why, do you fancy him? Too bad, your partner has a target now.”</p><p>“Eww! Impossible! I prefer beautiful guys!” Cao Lele retorted, giggling.</p><p>…</p><p>Walking out of the room and through the lounge, Lou Cheng had finally reached outside. The cold breeze blew against his face, making him feel energized again.</p><p>Not far from him, Qin Rui squatted by the frozen pond, smoking a cigarette. He appeared gloomy.</p><p>“What’s up? Haven’t got over it?” Lou Cheng strolled over and asked.</p><p>Qin Rui sighed and grumbled. “Yeah… I know you are going to advise me that victory and defeat are common fares for soldiers, but no matter what I’m still feeling depressed about it.”</p><p>“No no no, I’m not going to advise you on this. Defeated means defeated, how can it be common? What I want to advise you is, to be conscious of shame is near to fortitude. Now that you know the pain of being defeated, you should work hard, and not stay here to smoke a cigarette.” Lou Cheng advised, recalling his feeling from before.</p><p>Qin Rui was stunned as he turned his head, stared at Lou Cheng and answered, “Why, I feel that what you said is right.”</p><p>“Haha, great, since you’ve decided to work hard, then start off by quitting smoking. Smoking will damage your lungs, and you clearly know how important lungs are for martial arts practitioners.” Lou Cheng added.</p><p>Of course, it was up to them whether they wanted to heed his advice. He would not force his way.</p><p>“Right!” Qin Rui silenced for a while, put out his cigarette and a determined expression was shown on his face. He said, “Cheng, I’ll address you Cheng as well. Don’t mind about Tao Xiaofei, he’s a person with good nature, but tends to be insensitive towards others’ feelings.”</p><p>“Relax, I don’t mind all these.” Lou Cheng replied calmly.</p><p>After both chatted for a while, Qin Rui’s morale was boosted once again and was anxious to continue his martial arts practice. He said to Lou Cheng, “Now that I’ve already met our classmates, chatted and drank with them, I suppose this gathering is worth coming to. I think that’s all for today. You help me inform our ex-monitress that I’ll go back first. Haha, since my martial arts school had lost in the competition, I guess it’s better for me to stay with them today.”</p><p>“Sure, be careful on your way.” Lou Cheng replied.</p><p>Before leaving, Qin Rui teased,</p><p>“It’s a pity that we aren’t able to see Young Hero Lou’s charm today. Do show it to us next time.”</p><p>He boarded the cab, which he had pre-booked online, and entered the main city of Xiushan. He returned home before heading towards Gushan Martial Arts School. Just when he passed by Mingwei Martial Arts School, he saw Zhou Zhengyao walking out of the school.</p><p>“Sh*t, I should have made a detour… ” Qin Rui felt that he would be mocked at, or even be pissed by Zhou Zhengyao’s arrogance, yet he was certain that he wouldn’t be able to win him should they started a fight.</p><p>“Hey, Qin Rui, your classmate gathering is over?” Upon seeing Qin Rui, Zhou Zhengyao was stunned, but instantly greeted him with a grin on his face.</p><p>Qin Rui gave a bored expression and said, “Nah, I came back early.”</p><p>Mind your business!</p><p>Zhou Zhengyao tried hard to maintain the friendly smile on his face, as he continued, “Your skill weren’t bad just now, just that you were too panicked. You should be able to improve if you can control your temper better. Alright, I got to go, chat with you more next time.”</p><p>“… ” Qin Rui was too surprized to say a word. This was the first time he saw Zhou Zhengyao being friendly towards him.</p><p>Gazing after Zhou Zhengyao’s receding figure which diminished at the opposite side of the road, he finally came out of his trance, touched his own face, and cursed,</p><p>“Crazy bastard!”</p><p>That’s gibberish!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
