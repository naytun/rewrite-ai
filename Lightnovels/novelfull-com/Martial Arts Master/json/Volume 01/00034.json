Charging by bed instead of room, it was relatively cheap and perfect for poor students like Lou Cheng.</p><p>It was noticeably better than average youth hostels. According to all the reviews online, it was quiet, standard and less complicated.</p><p>It took Lou Cheng about ten minutes to jog to the hotel. He registered with his ID and a waiter led him to a twin room where the bed further in was already taken by a loud snorer who didn’t hear the door opening at all.</p><p>Lou Cheng frowned but soon soothed the brows as he realized that was exactly what he paid a few dozen yuan for.</p><p>He waited for the waiter to leave before putting down his bag and locking up his valuables. He quietly entered the bathroom to brush his teeth, take a shower and piss, and then settled himself in bed with jacket and jeans off.</p><p>Not super soft but much better than a train seat, the bed touched Lou Cheng’s body, comforted every inch of it and drove his emotions away.</p><p>A strange bed in a strange place in a strange city. Everything seemed so strange with no overlapping part with his previous life.</p><p>Snore, wind, and engine sounds now and then made Lou Cheng uncomfortable but also gave him an artistic feeling of isolation as if he was the only one on earth that’s still awake enjoying the tranquility and the strangeness of the night.</p><p>Lou Cheng roused himself from all the thoughts and commanded himself to sleep to keep the best form for tomorrow’s competition.</p><p>He sent Yan Zheke a message of his safe arrival in Yanling and then hid the charging phone under his pillow in case of a stealer. To overcome the noisy snore, he concentrated his spirit and qi on one item and started to meditate, throwing all the thoughts away in the glittery spinning nebula.</p><p>Lou Cheng had no idea when he fell asleep, but his biological clock woke him up at 5:30 sharp. No snooze, he got up and put on his jacket at once.</p><p>He felt refreshed after brushing his teeth, washing his face with cold water and combing his hair. Lou Cheng took his bag out and changed into the navy blue martial arts suit of Longhu Club. He then tiptoed out of the room with all his belongings and checked out with the astonished duty manager before leaving the hotel.</p><p>5 am on a winter morning was still pitch black. No breakfast restaurant was open and only a few cleaners were clearing the street of snow. Fortunately, street lamps were everywhere in this big city, illuminating the journey ahead through the biting chill.</p><p>Taking out his mobile, Lou Cheng opened a navigation app and searched for routes to the tournament venue. He murmured,</p><p>“Just over 20 kilometers. Not that far. I could just run over as my morning exercise before the fight.”</p><p>Just over 20 kilometers? Not that far? A cleaner raised his head and looked at Lou Cheng in disbelief.</p><p>It’s not close even for a taxi.</p><p>Moving his limbs a bit, Lou Cheng started to run with his backpack against the cold winter wind through darkness till the first beam of the rising sun. More and more vehicles appeared on the street.</p><p>It was close to 7 o’clock when he arrived at Yanling Martial Arts Stadium. He warmed up with still stance and fighting moves near the venue before he wolfed down five minced meat buns and a large cup of soya milk in a small breakfast restaurant.</p><p>Suddenly his phone beeped – a message from Yan Zheke. “Lazy Cheng, wake up! Don’t be late for the tournament!”</p><p>In a strange land receiving these familiar words, Lou Cheng subconsciously cracked up. “The good-looking was up early! I’m already at the venue.”</p><p>“You’re hard on yourself for this competition. You didn’t sleep until very late last night.” Yan Zheke sent a touching head sticker. “How do you feel? If your fight is in the afternoon, take a power nap somewhere.”</p><p>“Nervous and excited! Full of vigor!” Lou Cheng shared his true feeling and added a silly smile.</p><p>Yan Zheke didn’t ask Lou Cheng to fight hard but chatted casually until she had to turn her mobile off on the plane.</p><p>Lou Cheng put his phone away and paced to the tournament reception with his backpack. He queued for a few minutes until a girl at the reception took his invitation.</p><p>The delicate, pretty girl wearing light-colored glasses scanned the invitation and typed the serial code into her computer to verify information.</p><p>“ID, please.” She glanced curiously at Lou Cheng.</p><p>A student of no rank. How did he get this invitation?</p><p>Lou Cheng handed over his ID. The reception girl checked a few times carefully before giving it back along with a black round plate of half a palm in size with a relief sculpture of Phoenix. It bore a number 656.</p><p>“This is your number and tournament pass. Go to the stadium and check the draws on big screens to find out your opponent, ring and round. Wait there beforehand. If you need more information about your opponent, go to the help desk,” said the delicate girl seriously and responsibly.</p><p>“Thank you.” Lou Cheng smiled at her. “Just one more question. Where can I leave my bag?”</p><p>“At the service desk.” The reception girl gave him a standard smile.</p><p>Yanling Martial Arts Stadium was much bigger than Lou Cheng had expected, which can accommodate 20 to 30 thousand spectators. A huge ring in the middle was surrounded by nine simply constructed rings separated with white lines. All ten rings would be used for the first few rounds with matches arranged one after another. The most interesting and exciting fight would take place in the central ring.</p><p>In group competition stage, the nine simply constructed rings would be removed and all matches would be arranged in the central ring.</p><p>Many screens had been installed in the stadium for spectators sitting afar to watch matches and for all to enjoy replays. Right now, the draws were shown. Lou Cheng got closer to one of the screens, searching for his number and name.</p><p>The screen turned a few pages and he finally found himself.</p><p>“Ring Seven, Round Five. No. 656 Lou Cheng, 18, no rank versus No. 237 Liu Yinglong, 22, Amateur Fourth Pin.”</p><p>“God damn it. An Amateur Fourth Pin master in my first fight…” Lou Cheng grew sick at heart. “It’s better than a Professional Ninth or Eighth Pin opponent, but still a pretty bad draw for me… I will be quite confident if I’m facing an Amateur Seventh, Eighth or Ninth Pin fighter.”</p><p>Will it be my only fight? Do I need to change my train ticket to today?</p><p>Whatever… I’m here for actual combat experience!</p><p>In front of another screen were a few men also reading the draws.</p><p>“18, no rank. Brother, you’re pretty lucky!” A bearded man wrapped in a dark down coat said to the head of the group with a grin.</p><p>The head of the group was a young man of average height with bushy eyebrows and pockmarks on his forehead. His most marked characteristic was his extraordinarily long arms almost reaching his knees.</p><p>Liu Yinglong’s calmness welcomed cheers from his junior brothers and sisters. He shook his head and said, “Too early to cheer.”</p><p>“Why? Brother, this is the best opponent, right? 18, no rank!” A girl in a martial arts suit looked confused.</p><p>Liu Yinglong took a deep breath. “There is another kind of fighters of 18 years old and no rank. Those disciples of a master from famous martial arts schools and clubs by direct line are not interested in amateur ranking events. They wait until they are ready to get a professional ranking directly.”</p><p>“That’s possible.” The bearded appeared concerned. “Brother, let’s get more information from the help desk.”</p><p>Having ten matches happening at the same time, spectators are unable to watch them all. So, they read the draws and chose the fights that interested them and suited to their time. Then they would also get more information from the help desk to confirm which ones they were to watch. The help desk would also recommend outstanding martial artists and thrilling fights to the audience.</p><p>Lou Cheng carrying his big bag queued in front of one service desk. During the wait, he took out his mobile to check Road to the Arena and Invincible Punch’s draw results.</p><p>In the Longhu Club Forum, a live broadcast post named Phoenix Cup Warrior Sage Candidate Challenge Tournament had been created where Road to the Arena sent a funny face. “Not bad. An Amateur Seventh Pin fighter for me. Looks like the Goddess of Fortune is on my side. Punch also got a pretty good draw. An Amateur Fifth Pin opponent. His advantage is obvious.”</p><p>“Bring glory to the forum! If you can’t make it to the group competition, get castrated!” replied Okamoto’s Fan.</p><p>Beautiful World and several other female members also posted to encourage them. They demanded Road to the Arena and Invincible Punch to share a selfie.</p><p>“We will after the first victory!” Road to the Arena promised proudly.</p><p>Lou Cheng bared his teeth and felt jealous of their good luck.</p><p>At his turn at the service desk, he left his bag there and got information about his opponent and himself. Then he slowly stepped towards Ring Seven while reading the page.</p><p>“Liu Yinglong, male, 22 years old, the first disciple of Baiyuan Martial Arts School in Yanling. He started martial arts training at a late age of 20 but has quickly risen to Amateur Fourth Pin, best known for his arm boxing…” Lou Cheng’s self-confidence started to collapse.</p><p>On the other side, Liu Yinglong also got Lou Cheng’s information. He took a quick look and laughed out. “Thank goodness, not one of the monsters. Just a beginner coming for some combat experience, probably preparing for the next Ranking Event.”</p><p>The bearded man in a dark down coat had a read. “Student from Songcheng University? How come he came all the way here for the tournament?”</p><p>“Maybe his home is nearby.” Liu Yinglong didn’t seem to care. “Your opponents are fairly strong. Buck up and be careful.”</p><p>…</p><p>When Lou Cheng found Ring Seven, the tournament was about to start. The two fighters in the first round were already inside the ring. Few spectators scattered in the auditorium eying at the central ring.</p><p>“I can probably learn a thing or two by watching matches this closely…” He tried to comfort himself.</p><p>At nine o’clock sharp, a bell rang, signaling the beginning of the first Phoenix Cup Warrior Sage Candidate Challenge Tournament.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
