Just three allies away from here was the well-known Bar Street in Xiucheng. With bawdy music and dazzling lights, the street presented a completely different atmosphere.</p><p>When Lou Cheng was a junior in high school, sitting in front of him was a dandy, who had quitted the college entrance examination. He bragged about being a pimp there. However, Lou Cheng only came this neighborhood for barbeque and never went to one of the bars, as he thought the poor security around discos and bars would certainly get people in trouble.</p><p>Listening to the music in the air and smelling the pleasant smokiness of the grilled food, Lou Cheng was starving, as if a hand was about to reach out from his throat. Drinking mineral water only made him hungrier.</p><p>“Fatty Jiang, have you set a date for our get-together?” Lou Cheng tried to shift his attention back to their chat.</p><p>After gulping down a cup of herbal tea, Jiang Fei wiped his mouth and said, “Too sweet. Same drinks in Guangnan taste differently. Eh, our gathering is on the day after tomorrow, at Spring Scenery Field Conference Villa. You can climb Xiushan and then take Nine Curves to get there.”</p><p>“Spring Scenery Field Conference Villa?How fancy!” Lou was quite shocked upon hearing this gathering place.</p><p>Jiang Fei smiled at him. “Are you confused again? The price of this villa is slightly higher than that of the agritainment, as there are fewer gatherings before the New Year. 200 yuan for each is enough. We can play ping-pong, badminton, tennis, and basketball or go to the free karaoke. Mahjong room and chess-poker room are also available. If the above events are not your cup of tea, you can climb the mountain for exercise and enjoy the fresh air. You can even get a room as long as you are happy. Ah-ha, there is a spa hotel nearby. With some extra money, you can also enjoy the hot spring.”</p><p>“None of these events attracts me. I’d rather chat with my old pals, recalling memories of the awkward and sharing some college experiences,” Lou Cheng grabbed some tissues to wipe his noses and said.</p><p>“Pooh! Stop pretending, I recall you being a big fan for karaoke. Somebody has been a mic hog several times that summer after college entrance examination.” Jiang Fei ruthlessly exposed his lie.</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed embarrassedly and soon changed the subject. “How many classmates will show up?”</p><p>“All promise to come except a few who are not in Xiushan. Ha, I can’t wait to find out whether those couples back then have broken up or not, and how many singles have found their dates,” Jiang Fei said with excitement, obviously ignoring himself being a single for 18 years.</p><p>The amicable Fatty Jiang could take a joke easily, so Lou Cheng loved to hang out with him and dared to speak freely.</p><p>However, Fatty Jiang looked suspicious when he was absorbed in detective fictions. Lou Cheng used to take him as a cold-blooded killer, distorted by his hidden anger. Being generous or open-minded was just his mask. However, by checking his mental state on purpose, Lou Cheng found that he was merely an easy-going boy who let go of the anger quickly.</p><p>Lou Cheng cleared his throat and said, “How many teachers do you invite?”</p><p>“Just Old Wu and Mr. Xin. Other teachers are either unavailable or unwelcomed. For instance, Old Li.” Jiang Fei answered with a smile.</p><p>Old Li was the math teacher whom Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke had been complaining about. As the director of academic affairs office, Old Li terrified all the students. Both Old Wu and Mr. Xin had been their head teachers, one taught Chinese while the other taught chemistry.</p><p>“Ha, Old Wu is a fan of martial arts. He talked about martial arts with us every time he patrolled in class.” Lou Cheng looked forward to seeing his head teacher in senior year.</p><p>At this moment, waitress brought them easily-toasted skewers that were dressed with chopped scallions.</p><p>Despite his craving for food, Lou Cheng took a photo first by his cell phone. Instead of sending it to Yan Zheke immediately, he waited for the right moment and showed to her in batches.</p><p>“Done?” Fatty Jiang asked with a smile.</p><p>“All done. Let’s eat.” Lou Cheng freely grabbed a streaky skewer.</p><p>Meat used in Old Liu Barbeque was seasoned beforehand in secret recipe for the best flavor. So tasty was the meat that Lou Cheng finished one skewer with two or three bites. Later, tastes left in mouth made him crave for more, especially in this middle night.</p><p>His favorite were skewers with a little fat. The fat was roasted to make the meat more gravy, but not greasy. With the sizzling oil and the delicious aroma, he could wolf down one after one without a stop.</p><p>After appeasing his hunger by eating a dozen or so, Lou Cheng finally started to talk. He had a great chat with Jiang Fei over fun stuff and gossips during high school and college.</p><p>When they finished their first round, the second round came in time, which required longer cooking time, like chicken wings, wing tips, and ribs. The specialty of Old Liu Barbeque was grilled eggplant already placed in two baking trays.</p><p>Eggplant grilled by Old Liu tasted differently, and there was a world of difference between Old Liu’s eggplant and grilled eggplant in Songcheng and Yanling. Instead of using mashed garlic as seasonings, Old Liu fried his special dressings and crisp peas in hot oil over high heat. Then this special-made sauce was poured on grilled eggplant to let the flavor permeate. In doing so, grilled eggplant tasted like fish, but retained their own flavor. Everybody loved Old Liu’s eggplant and seemed incapable of getting over this delish snack.</p><p>In Lou Cheng’s heart, grilled eggplant was the king in the barbeque business, which he preferred more than meat. Even Yan Zheke, who was currently in the southern region, missed this delicious dish.</p><p>Meanwhile, people who enjoyed a daily tipple couldn’t get enough of the crisp peas in dressings.</p><p>When this specialty was served, Lou Cheng adjusted the color balance of his cell and soon took a photo, which looked quite appetizing. Along with a number of photos taken before, he sent all to Yan Zheke at once.</p><p>“I am so satisfied.” Lou Cheng sent the message to show off.</p><p>Yan Zheke immediately sent a throwing-dog emoji and said,</p><p>“Our friendship has ended like this dead dog!”</p><p>Lou Cheng curved his lip, revealed a smile, and quickly typed a reply.</p><p>Jiang Fei picked up some eggplant and put them into his mouth. Then he looked at Lou Cheng with a mischievous smile and said, “Cheng, look at you! You are picking up a hot chick. Once you get the girl, introduce to us. I wanna know who she is that makes you so into her.”</p><p>Actually, you knew her and we have talked about her just now… Lou Cheng secretly teased. He put down his cell while dipping some eggplant into the gravy and said, “Sure, if I can make it happen.”</p><p>When grilled eggplant was brought to mouth by chopsticks, Lou Cheng was deeply touched by this flavor he had been longing for, meanwhile his chopsticks moved faster.</p><p>Jiang Fei picked up a cup of herbal tea and said with a smile, “Wish you a great success. If I have my dream girl one day, I might consult with you. Ah, right, does my sister-in-law have any besties, I get dibs on them. Don’t forget!”</p><p>Sister-in-law, good call! Lou Cheng gave a silent praise and started to tease him after a pause,</p><p>“You have to lose weight first… ”</p><p>Jiang Fei rolled his eyes so as to give him a supercilious look meanwhile asked for more details like a paparazzi. “How do you meet? Is the girl your classmate from college?”</p><p>“Nope, we met in Songcheng University Martial Arts Club.” Lou Cheng told no lies, yet not being entirely truthful.</p><p>It was actually you who took me to Class Three to check out beauties where I met Yan Zheke for the first time.</p><p>Lou Cheng planned not to share any information until he succeeded in dating with Yan Zheke. Otherwise, it would be too awkward since they went to the same high school and shared the same social circle.</p><p>More importantly, he believed that Yan Zheke did not like people gossip behind her back…</p><p>“Holy crap! That’s why you have been arduously practicing your martial arts!” Lou Cheng suddenly came to the realization, as if solving a problem that he dared not ask. “Never judge a book by its cover, now I finally get it. Cheng, I never thought you would go great length just not to be a single!”</p><p>They talked and laughed while eating eggplant and wing tips. Finally came their last dish – grilled fish. The fish was baked in a similar way to eggplant. Somehow it tasted no better than eggplant in Lou Cheng’s heart.</p><p>They ordered more upon finishing the grilled fish. Jiang Fei was astonished at Lou Cheng’s appetite and asked worriedly, “Cheng, will I eat so much if I start to exercise? Then how can I lose weight with such a big appetite?”</p><p>“Do you see me get fat?” Lou Cheng took out his wallet and asked for their bill.</p><p>He felt powerful and energetic again after the meal, as though he was thrown back to life, and his symptoms of coldness were relieved as well.</p><p>“Nope.” Jiang took a careful look of Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Then it is all good. Don’t be afraid!” Lou Cheng looked confident.</p><p>When Old Liu brought their bill, Jiang Fei also took out his wallet and said, “Eh, Cheng, let me pay the check. I am the one who should treat you with a nice welcome dinner. How could I let you pay?”</p><p>“Ha, I recently participated in a martial arts competition and made some extra cash. You don’t have to feel sorry for this.” Lou Cheng answered with pride.</p><p>Jiang Fei looked at him, shocked. “You made some money in a martial arts competition? How long have you been practicing? I see, this competition was exclusive to pupils and you came there to bully them.”</p><p>“Get lost!” Lou Cheng paid the check with a simple reply. The bill for this meal is less than 500 yuan. Despite each skewer carried less weight than that of other places, and the difference was big, it was still a good deal.</p><p>Seeing Lou Cheng being deep-pocketed for real, Jiang Fei just let him take the check. He rubbed his belly and said, “How about going for a walk in this neighborhood? It’s good for digestion. Well, living in Xiushan was indeed a bargain. We could never afford so many skewers and grilled fish in Guangnan with over 400 yuan.”</p><p>Lou Cheng nodded and seriously asked the boss about their opening date after the New Year – Old Liu Barbeque would close for the New Year the day after tomorrow.</p><p>Upon hearing the Barbeque reopen on the eighth day of the first lunar month, Lou Cheng looked satisfied with both hands in his pocket. He had already booked a small vacuum machine and a thermal container online, and the delivery date would be after the New Year.</p><p>Being rich was awesome!</p><p>In this cold windy night, two of them walked in the alley for better digestion and continued to chat over all kinds of stuff. They subconsciously went in the opposite direction to the Bar Street.</p><p>When they turned a corner, in front of them was the backstreet with all road lights off. They saw vaguely with weak lights from surrounding households.</p><p>“Let’s turn back. Who knows what we will encounter in such darkness,” Jiang Fei buttoned his down jacket and said.</p><p>Lou Cheng was about to respond, suddenly he saw several people appear in front of them. One is running desperately, the other three hold three blazing knives chasing right after him. The sound of steps got noisy in this cold and dark alley.</p><p>“Holy crap, the mobs are killing! Let’s hide somewhere, don’t be dragged into this mess.” Jiang Fei was shivering with fear.</p><p>Lou Cheng also didn’t want to get in trouble, so he drew back with Jiang Fei, standing sideways in darkness. Right at this moment, the one who has been running stepped into to a place where lights shone on his face.</p><p>Wang Xu!</p><p>It was Wang Xu!</p><p>The target of these killers was Wang Xu.</p><p>Lou Cheng was of sharp observation and immediately recognized that desperate bleeding man. It was his childhood friend who he had just met before dinner in their community.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
