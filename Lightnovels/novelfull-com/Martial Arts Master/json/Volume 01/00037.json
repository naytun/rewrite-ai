They went up the flight of stone stairs and went to each side of the referee respectively.</p><p>A clamor burst forth among the audience with sounds of voices rising and falling and flashlights shining.</p><p>“It seems like a long-awaited fight.” Without the match table for others at hand, Lou Cheng looked around with hazy eyes.</p><p>He took the opportunity to ask a passing young man out of curiosity, “Enthusiastic audience, for which two?”</p><p>The man raised his eyebrows on his alien-like face,</p><p>“Don’t you know that?”</p><p>“Why should I know that…” Lou Cheng thought adversely yet said smilingly. “I forgot to take a VS list,just looking around anyway.”</p><p>The young man curled his lips and answered Lou Cheng’s question, “It’s a round of competition between fighters with highest ranks and closest strength today, Professional Ninth Pin VS Amateur Second Pin. You see the girl in pink and white martial arts suit? She is Ye Youting, Professional Ninth Pin, the daughter of Yiye Martial Arts School’s master in Yanling, known for her tiger-simulate and leopard-simulate kungfu. Her opponent is Guan Yan, a disciple of Jiuzhen Martial Arts School, Amateur Second Pin specialized in throwing techniques.”</p><p>Professional Ninth Pin VS Amateur Second Pin? A competition of sorts… As Lou Cheng had seen the masterly display of Professional Ninth Pin, he had no confidence in Guan Yan in the least. Seeing that it’s merely a round of knockout, the rank difference was acceptably small for the audience.</p><p>Ye Youting was tall and slim with thick brows and straight nose. Her beauty was set off by the pink and white martial arts suit to a turn. Facing Guan Yan, she said,</p><p>“If you can take my three blows, I’ll throw up the sponge.”</p><p>The burly-set young man was apparently offended by her words. “Rank difference cannot deny my strength. Retract your offense!”</p><p>Guan Yan had come across Ye Youting several times in all manner of martial arts activities in Yanling yet without any conversation and competition with her. It was the first encounter that he had with her in the ring, only to find how arrogant the girl was! Knowing a person by repute was not as good as seeing him face to face!</p><p>A free and easy smile appeared on Ye Youting’s face. “Have a try.”</p><p>Silence smothered the ring during the remaining waiting time for referee’s announcement.</p><p>“Fight!”</p><p>The voice was still in the air when Ye Youting spurted out, sending forth the sound of wind. Her move was just like a leopard sprinting to its prey with powerful bearing sufficient to overwhelm very many warriors.</p><p>The distance with Guan Yan was closed up in a flash. She slammed her foot down and threw a powerful punch with strength streaming from her feet all the way up to her fist at Guan Yan, just like a giant ax or a weighty hammer falling with intense oppression to the air and people around.</p><p>Guan Yan subconsciously evaded when Ye Youting’s words flashed across his mind, As long as he could take her three blows, Ye Youting would directly throw in the towel.</p><p>“Three blows are not that hard for me!” With teeth gritted, Guan Yan poised himself for Ye Youting’s strike with muscles in his arms bulged out. At one time, he sparing strength to cope with changes as unexpected moves were the only key for Ye Youting’s victory with no more than three blows!</p><p>Pong!</p><p>With a dull thud sent out by the collisions of fists and arms, Lou Cheng saw Guan Yan’s face turning pale, and the defense of his arms was unexpectedly breached by Ye Youting’s surprising strength. The fists with remaining momentum straight hit Guan Yan’s completely exposed chest, making him lose balance at once. Afterward, Ye Youting stamped the ground, turned her fist into an open palm and pushed Guan Yan down the ring.</p><p>She defeated Guan Yan of Amateur Second Pin with just one blow and one push!</p><p>With Lou Cheng’s mouth slightly open, referee’s voice fell on his ears,</p><p>“Ye Youting wins!”</p><p>The audience was not prepared for this shocking result. A short silence was replaced by noise and excitement until Ye Youting stepped down the ring.</p><p>“How large the gap is between Amateur Second Pin and Professional Ninth Pin!”</p><p>“A man of mark in amateur martial arts world was defeated with only one blow?”</p><p>“Have Ye Youting reached the level of Professional Eighth Pin?”</p><p>Even in the middle of the passionate discussion, Lou Cheng’s heart was still fluttering with fear. The pride of winning Liu Yinglong faded away in great measure.</p><p>Ye Youting beat Guan Yan by mere strength!</p><p>Strength alone!</p><p>Lin Que, the same rank with Ye Youting and very close to the Danqi stage, tended to have a tiny advantage in strength when fighting with Chen Changhua and others of Amateur First Pin or Second Pin.</p><p>Was Ye Youting born with “superhuman strength”?</p><p>It made no sense. Even if she could not reach the Danqi stage, Ye Youting had no difficulty in passing the ranking events for Professional Eighth Pin or even Seventh Pin by her strength and well-mastered tiger-simulate and leopard-simulate kungfu. Unless significant progress made in a short time had prepared her for the ranking event yet to come, “superhuman strength” could not explain this shocking victory.</p><p>The other explanation was that the blow served as a clever trick. Ye Youting’s punch force momentarily reached a rolling and crushing level resorting to the combination of extraordinary strength and explosive power.</p><p>Right, maybe it’s the very reason! And that’s why Ye Youting tried to irritate Guan Yan with the words of “three blows decide the fight.”</p><p>She used a Lightning-and-Fire-Stance-like skill which could at most burst three or four times in a fight to win an impressive victory over Guan Yan.</p><p>With a clear understanding of the fight, Lou Cheng felt no relaxation, but even more admiration for Ye Youting, realizing the gap between himself and Professional Ninth Pin was still quite extensive. It seemed impossible to get away from Ye Youting’s blow with leopard-fast speed while Guan Yan’s crushing defeat was telling the story of confrontation.</p><p>How long would he take to bridge the strength gap with Ye Youting’s blow if he combined Mega Avalanche in 24 Blizzard Strikes with the explosive force of Lightning and Fire Stance? Was there any chance to make it?</p><p>As this idea became clear, Lou Cheng went away from the arena and came to the service desk at leisure.</p><p>“Would you please give me the deposited bags?” Lou Cheng handed the number card and luggage card to the lady at service.</p><p>Owing to Phoenix Cup Warrior Sage Candidate Challenge Tournament, the hotels nearby were all in short supply. The reserved rooms would only be kept for customers up to 2 p.m.</p><p>The lady took the two round cards over to have a check. Immediately, she had a glance at the young man before she opened the storage room with the key and returned his backpack and the number card.</p><p>“Thank you.” Lou Cheng put on his backpack, pocketed the number card and walked toward the exit of the gymnasium.</p><p>Watching Lou Cheng away, the lady suddenly turned around to her colleague, “Hey! Is that undergraduate with no rank, who beat Liu Yinglong from Baiyuan Martial Arts School?”</p><p>“Him? Not a superb guy he seems like…” Another girl gazed at Lou Cheng’s back on tiptoe, “Looking forward to his performance in the second round tomorrow.”</p><p>…</p><p>Upon entering the lobby of Fulin Hotel, Lou Cheng saw many people in martial arts suit queuing up at the Service to check in.</p><p>“Good business…” He came to the end of the line, habitually took out of the phone and logged into his QQ to see whether Yan Zheke had landed and replied his messages.</p><p>Lou Cheng saw Yan Zheke’s profile of a cute cat winking at first glance accompanying the QQ beep sound.</p><p>“Just landed. Not bad. No shame brought to the Martial Arts Club of Songcheng University! ” Yan Zheke sent a smiley behind sleeves a few minutes ago, “(microphone) What would you want to say about your first victory in official competitions?”</p><p>Lou Cheng subconsciously put on a happy smile and sent an emoji of a satisfied guy wearing a pair of sunglasses. “Say something?” “Uh… I would like to thank CCTV, MTV, and KTV… Oh, No, thank Yan Zheke, Coach Shi, Martial Arts Club and Lin Que.”</p><p>After dozens of seconds, Yan Zheke replied a laughing emoji with one arm leaning against the wall and then a glaring face in a frown. “I mean it!”</p><p>Lou Cheng came to be serious, “I was quite nervous before stepping up the ring because my opponent had reached much higher rank than me. But I took it easy when starting to fight with only one thought in my mind that was to put my plan into practice and show my real strength after prior exercises.”</p><p>“First of all, you had no rank. So ‘much higher rank than me’ does not make sense. Moreover, what’s his rank?” asked Yan Zheke with a curious face of the Internet-celebrity cat.</p><p>Looking at the phone screen, Lou Cheng answered with a bigger smile, “Amateur Fourth Pin.”</p><p>Yan Zheke immediately sent an emoji of a cat “dropping its dried fish out of scare.” “Really?”</p><p>“Yeah! You are the last one I would lie to! ” Lou Cheng expressed how much he cared about her by implication.</p><p>Yan Zheke replied a comforting emoji of touching the head, “Um. Cheng is always honest. But I want to know how you could win him? How could you improve your strength so fast? I don’t understand! ”</p><p>“The information makes winners. I gathered my opponent’s detailed information before the competition, coming at his proficiency in Arm Boxing. So I searched some videos of this skill and managed to figure out its features, which was flexible footwork. They liked to move here and there in the fight to bring their opponents under control. ”</p><p>Lou Cheng explained honestly to the girl he fell for. “According to the information, I made a plan that was to expose my back to him, deceiving him into believing that his footwork had put me in a desperate spot. When he allowed his mind to relax, I spun to his back and launched a deciding blow with 24 Blizzard Strikes and Lightning and Fire Stance. Afterward, I managed to keep calm and followed up the first handsome blow… Um, the key to this victory is that he knew nothing about me and took me lightly.”</p><p>Yan Zheke replied a few minutes later. “Off the plane ~ Your description makes me feel personally participating in the fight and putting my wit against the opponent. It is extremely satisfying and marvelous! My grandpa has told me that the rank of martial arts represented a stable level over the long term. There are too many external factors in individual competition.”</p><p>“I am the continuation of your martial arts dream… ” Lou Cheng confessed his love in the heart. “You will have this chance in the future.”</p><p>Yan Zheke sent a pathetic emoji. “Your progress is so impressive! Cheng, I didn’t expect this from you! I can’t slack off! ”</p><p>Only four people were ahead of Lou Cheng in the queue for check-in, a senior, a young man and two girls in their early twenties. All of them were in dark cyan martial arts suit with hill-simulate patterns decorated on the cuffs and neckband.</p><p>They reserved two rooms at the hotel, took their room cards and left the service desk.</p><p>Walking down to the elevator, the young man with short hair turned his head and took a glance at Lou Cheng. “To participate in the Challenge Tournament?” He mumbled.</p><p>The senior turned his eyes to Lou Chen, only to find a student-looking young man with a silly smile on his face totally immersed in the cheerful chatting on the phone. He shook his head. “Just a martial arts lover to watch the tournament.”</p><p>With no more words said, the young man pressed the button in the elevator with his iron-colored right hand of big joints.</p><p>Lou Cheng booked himself a twin room. He needed a good rest to recuperate and build up energy for the tournament as Jindan (the Golden Elixir) could only help him gather strength. It merely charged a little more than 100 RMB one day for the room, since the small room was poorly equipped, even inferior to express hotels.</p><p>Yan Zheke went to bed after chatting a while on account of getting up early and airsickness while Lou Cheng slept off with relaxed mood after the competition.</p><p>The curtain of night had hung down when he woke up. The dead silence in the room seemed to be relating to the coming of the day of doom.</p><p>Pulling himself together, Lou Cheng started to browse the forum and found both Road to the Arena and Invincible Punch won their competition. As agreed, they posted their pictures on the forum.</p><p>Road to the Arena had a good face with short hair parted on the side. The only flaw was his clearly visible black eyes. Invincible Punch was tall and handsome with a brush cut and dashing eyebrows, which attracted not a few replies.</p><p>The first round of more than four hundred competition was about to draw to a close. Lou Cheng did not feel like to go to the gymnasium. He went to a park nearby to do some exercise before having his dinner. After that, he came back to bed to chat with Yan Zheke and other classmates, as well as browse content posted in forums and videos in microblogs.</p><p>…</p><p>The next day at eight forty, a middle-aged man in a leather jacket arrived in the gymnasium. He approached a screen, looking for some details in the VS list with his wide-opened eyes.</p><p>“No. 656, Lou Cheng…” He murmured.</p><p>…</p><p>Following Yu Haichao the master of their martial art school, Liu Yinglong and other disciples stepped into the arena once again.</p><p>Looking at the big screen at a distance, Yu Haichao muttered to himself.</p><p>“No. 656, Lou Cheng…”</p><p>…</p><p>At the same time, Lou Cheng was also looking for his name in front of the screen to see who his opponent was in the second round of knockout.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
