The moment Lou Cheng, who was filled with excitement and joy, stepped out of the station; he could not help but shiver. The difference between the cold dry wind in Yanling and the freezing temperature in Xiushan was that the latter could chill one to the bone. It was the kind of cold that one could not withstand even with the windbreakers on, not to mention that Lou Cheng was currently weak and sick.</p><p>“Luckily, I am smart enough to put on extra clothing before alighting.” Lou Cheng praised himself. He took out his cell phone and started taking photos of the nostalgic sky and the distant landmark building of Xiushan – the Tower Building. He then sent them to Yan Zheke, grinning and said, “Find them familiar?”</p><p>Yan Zheke replied with an amazed emoji. “Kind of miss my home all of a sudden… ”</p><p>“Then take me as your substitute and I’ll enjoy Xiushan on your behalf,” said Lou Cheng as he laughed delightfully.</p><p>“Bah, what rubbish are you saying? Are you as good-looking as me, Substitute Cheng!” Yan Zheke replied with a “You Know Nothing of Strength” emoji.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lou Cheng carried his luggage, declined the offers provided by a group of black cabs, and came to the bus stop, waiting for the arrival of Bus 82 to return home.</p><p>Although he had a stack in his backpack, and a few hundred in his wallet, but one must know how to be frugal!</p><p>With the initial bonus of five thousand dollars, he was planning to save the remaining money for dating. Now that he had another 10 thousand dollars as a bonus for getting into top eight, an idea struck him. He thought of getting something for his father and mother during the New Year, as a meaningful gift to his parents for the first time, to surprise them!</p><p>Bus 82 was crowded. Lou Cheng relied on the Yin-Yang Stance to balance himself well, so it did not matter whether or not he was sitting down, as he probed his head, looked around, hoping to bump into one or two classmates on the way.</p><p>Unfortunately, Xiushan was a prefecture-level city and the main city already had hundreds of thousands of people. The total number of classmates he had, from the kindergarten till now, was not more than three hundred. Compared with the former, it was as if a drop in the ocean, unless one specifically visit the areas that were common among these people, else it would be difficult to meet.</p><p>The bus rocked and stopped as it arrived at the non-commercial center of the old urban area, where the surrounded buildings became shorter and less colorful. Lou Cheng alighted at the bus stop near the entrance of a small district.</p><p>He had lived here for almost ten years, where many buildings had been mottled, leaving the ruthless traces of the years. This was where the enterprise that his father first worked for fell from its glory. During its bankruptcy, it had used every last cent of its own savings and borrowed debt to purchase the property right.</p><p>Most of the residents in the small district were his father’s former colleagues or workers, and the relationships between the neighbors were fairly good. Lou Cheng greeted the neighbors along the way. Seeing the uncle who he knew since he was a kid, and that aunt helped change his diapers, Lou Cheng could already feel the taste of home without stepping into his house.</p><p>Of course, having such neighbors had its con as well, especially those nosy aunts who loved to gather during their free time. When things happened to one household, the news would spread throughout the whole district at a blink of an eye!</p><p>When approaching his home at No.8 building, Lou Cheng saw a young man walking out of the doorway from the unit. He smiled and greeted, “Brother Xu”</p><p>This young man named Wang Xu, was his kindergarten, primary school, and junior high school classmate, also generally known as his childhood friend. Moreover, their fathers once worked in the same technical department, and at that time, they loved meeting up for chess and bragging sessions. Thus, Lou Cheng’s relationship with him was considered very good.</p><p>However, during the years when the enterprise was about to bankrupt, many people started to panic and were living in straitened circumstances. Everyone had an arduous time. It was common to see someone from a family had to leave his hometown to work, while the other had to stay to take care of the family and looked after the children. Conflicts in the family that broke out from time to time had also affected the children. Some children had lost their interest in studies and chose to work for money at a young age, while some followed the former youth workers in the old factory and now the current gangsters to become the “bludger”. Gradually, organizations with features of the gangsterdom were formed.</p><p>Wang Xu was tall and well-built. Since young, he had a passion for martial arts, and under such poor environment, he had slowly embarked upon a crooked path. When he was at junior high school, he, on one hand, tried to butter up the sports teacher to teach him martial arts. On the other hand, he followed the gangsters to collect protection fees and participated in the campus gang fights.</p><p>At that time, he was relatively simple. Sometimes, he would even show off to Lou Cheng about who they had fought today, and which gang they were planning on fighting the next day. Based on Lou Cheng’s today’s insight, he was indeed a potential talent for martial arts, who had the capability of an Amateur Ninth Pin when he was just about 14 or 15 years old.</p><p>Just because of having such childhood friend, Lou Cheng could strive under such poor environment in his junior high school, where without any outside interference, without any bullying from gangsters, to concentrate on his studies and be admitted into Xiushan No.1 Middle School. This would allow him to be completely free from such poor environment, and to be a complete stranger with Wang Xu. From then, Lou Cheng was no longer updated with his situation, only through bumping into him from time to time did Lou Cheng know that he did not study in high school, instead he seemed to be doing well as a gangster, though his face had more shallow scars than before.</p><p>The scar on Wang Xu’s left cheek remained vaguely visible. He kept a neat short hair, wore a long black leather coat which seemed very valuable, and put on a long thick golden chain that gave off a nouveau riche look. There was no tenderness between his eyebrows, nor did he look like an 18 or 19 years old youth.</p><p>“Yo, the college student is back.” He was quite happy when he saw Lou Cheng and he took out a packet of imported cigarettes with printed English letters from his pocket, “Come, have one. This is good stuff!”</p><p>It was under such circumstance did I started picking up smoking and drinking … Lou Cheng thought. He waved his hand and replied, “I’ve quit smoking.”</p><p>A look of unhappiness crossed Wang Xu’s face and his attitude turned indifferent. He lighted his own cigarette and said, “College students are just not the same.”</p><p>Honestly, though they had a relationship in the past, Lou Cheng was still somewhat afraid of him, but now, after his experience from Warrior Sage Challenge Tournament, he could now face Wang Xu without any fear. Lou Cheng looked directly into Wang Xu’s eyes and asked with a gentle laugh, “Not only did I quit smoking, I’ve also quit drinking, but I did not quit barbecue and hot pot. How about a supper together when there’s time?”</p><p>Seeing that Lou Cheng did not deliberately distant from him, instead, was being frank and generous, the displeased feeling within Wang Xu disappeared. He returned to his friendly attitude, laughed and replied, “Great! Let’s see when I have time, we shall go for some barbecue. Cheng, how can you quit smoking and drinking? What’s the point of living without these? ”</p><p>Lou Cheng responded with a grin, “I’ve joined the Martial Arts Club in college and I intend to keep myself fit. As you know, one needs to quit smoking and drinking to practice martial arts.”</p><p>Upon hearing, Wang Xu laughed and said, “You actually went for martial arts practice? Wait till I am free, I’ll teach you a few stunts. I guaranteed that your martial arts skills will improve tremendously during this winter break! ”</p><p>I don’t believe … As if you can train me to instantly become Professional Ninth Pin? Maybe you can’t even defeat me… Lou Cheng mocked silently. Without saying much, he pointed upstairs and added, “I am going home first to see my father and mother, talk to you later.”</p><p>“Sure, I’ll bring a bottle of wine to your house later. It has been a long time since I last played chess with Uncle Lou.” Wang Xu’s home and Lou Cheng’s home were in the same building same unit, just that the former is on the second floor, while the latter is on the fifth floor. Ever since Wang Xu graduated from junior high school, it is common for him not to return home for a week.</p><p>Lou Cheng replied with a cluck. “Your chess skill still on par? I’ve long neglected it. ”</p><p>Both their fathers loved to play chess, considering that both were influenced since young. It was an ability passed down from their ancestors.</p><p>Wang Xu initially smiled, followed by a sigh and said, “You know my father, his temper is as stubborn as a donkey. He was very displeased with me becoming a gangster, but you can’t get out once you set foot in such path. Sigh, it is only during chess game that he gives me a better attitude and speak with me.”</p><p>The way he spoke made him sound old.</p><p>After some small talk, Lou Cheng entered the unit door and marched up the stairway with a sense of nostalgia, towards his home on the fifth floor. This small district was built a decade ago when apartments with elevator were not yet popular at Xiushan, hence the highest apartment here was only six floor high.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s face broke into a smile upon seeing their blue-grey security door. He took out the keys. It was now past five and he was certain that his mother was at home preparing for dinner.</p><p>He had not told his mother in advance that he will be home today, in hope to give them a surprise!</p><p>Dang dang dang dang! The background music sounded in his heart as he twisted the key and opened the door. He shouted,</p><p>“Mom, I am home!”</p><p>His voice echoed. The house remained silent. Lou Cheng stared blankly, put on the slippers and walked into the kitchen. There was no one, neither was there any trace of cooking.</p><p>F*uck, where’s everyone? Lou Cheng took out his phone and called his mother.</p><p>Where’s the surprise I wanted?</p><p>The line got connected. Lou Cheng’s mother familiar voice came through the phone, “Cheng, when are you coming home? All other kids are already on holiday break! ”</p><p>“Mother, I am at home right now, where are all of you?” Lou Cheng asked, slightly sluggish.</p><p>“Why didn’t you say you were coming home?” Lou Cheng’s mother replied, raising her tone.</p><p>Lou Cheng twitched the corner of his mouth and commented. “I was thinking of surprising the both of you.”</p><p>“Surprise your head! This is more like a shock! There’s a relative getting married, so your father and I am at Ningshui County attending the wedding. We’re not coming back tonight, you’ll settle on your own.” Lou Cheng’s mom scolded, with a humorous tone.</p><p>Ningshui County was a county below Xiushan.</p><p>“I came all the way home, and this is what I get?” Lou Cheng replied, not knowing whether he should cry or laugh at such situation.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s mother chortled and said, “Why didn’t you say in advance, else I would have let your dad come here by himself. Are you feeling surprised now?”</p><p>“Yeah, totally… ” Lou Cheng was speechless.</p><p>After hanging up the phone, he looked around the empty house and sighed. I am indeed her biological son, still need to settle my own meals.</p><p>Returning to his own room covered with the posters of Dragon King and other fighters, Lou Cheng placed his luggage, took out his phone, and messaged Yan Zheke, “Poor me! Everyone has gone to attend a wedding and no one is home to welcome me or cook for me! ”</p><p>Yan Zheke quickly replied with a photo of a round table filled with great dishes. There were layers of dishes stacked up, which added up to about twenty different dishes. “This is my dinner tonight for you to satisfy your craving. No need to thank me!”</p><p>“Look into my eyes… ” Lou Cheng sent an aggrieved emoji and added, “stay-at-home child has been brutally abandoned!”</p><p>While chatting with Yan Zheke, he began to think about his dinner and thought of gathering some friends out for a meal. He was now rich anyway!</p><p>Firstly, he left a message for Cai Zongming with a grin. “Talker, I have a secret for you.”</p><p>Now my secret of achieving the top eight in the Warrior Sage Challenge Tournament can finally overtake yours!</p><p>Next, he chatted with Chiang Fei on QQ. “Fatty Jiang, are you free? I am back to Xiushan, let’s meet for dinner.”</p><p>If Fatty Jiang is not free, I’ll contact the next one then.</p><p>“Yo, you’re finally willing to come back. I thought you are having such a good time that you have forgotten to come home. Where are we eating?” Jiang Fei replied with no hesitation. This is friendship!</p><p>Lou Cheng gave a thought. “Old Liu Barbecue,” he replied.</p><p>Then I can send a picture to Yan Zheke and let her crave for it!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
