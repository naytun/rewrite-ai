Looking at his reflection on the pool surface, Lou Cheng felt as if he had never left high school.</p><p>When his facial contour was still soft…</p><p>When he was lean, weak, and always felt tired…</p><p>At that time, Lou Cheng was timid and ungenerous. He was not an introverted boy aloof with strangers, but he tended to think too much. “Will my words be proper or open to different interpretations?” “Will I leave a bad impression on him or her?” Having so much to worry about, Lou Cheng got nervous dealing with others, which in turn worsened his performance at school…</p><p>But for now, thanks to the good example Little Ming had set, the spiritual stimulation martial arts practice had given him, and all the confidence he had gained in every Challenge Tournament, Lou Cheng realized that sometimes he needn’t think or care too much about other people’s opinions. Just as an irresolute and hesitant warrior would fail his tournament, many times the idea that one wished to bring across was more critical than what was being said, which aided one to express confidence and sincerity. Of course, a little sense of humor would help.</p><p>Recalling old times, Lou Cheng became gradually lost in the ups and downs of memory. He found peace of mind here in the cold wind, while his schoolfellows were still enjoying themselves in singing, basketball, playing cards, and mountain climbing.</p><p>Familiar voices came from all around and echoed in Lou Cheng’s mind. He felt as if he was a high school boy again.</p><p>High school life was hard and oppressive. It began with the early self-study at dawn and usually continued far into the night. Completing homework after school in the classroom was popular since they could discuss it with other classmates. Countless test papers and examinations had consumed their youth time, making it pale and dull.</p><p>When negative impressions subsided with time, happy memories emerged. Whether it was getting good grades through hard work, finishing homework early for more leisure time, or chatting in class while the teacher wasn’t looking, these memories had been shimmering in Lou Cheng’s mind.</p><p>He remembered the joy of taking time to romp between classes, the satisfaction of secretly gazing at Yan Zheke during martial art exercises, and all that the teachers had done to help them and cheer them up.</p><p>He also remembered the excitement of occasionally leaving school to visit the internet bar with Jiang Fei and Cheng Qili during the lunch hour, the fanaticism of collecting martial arts masters’ posts as their big idol, the crazy deed of sleeping till noon on weekends, and the fulfillment of reading novels at break off and on.</p><p>Bits and pieces of the past raced through Lou Cheng’s mind, which felt like yesterday once more.</p><p>His high school life and youth would never come back.</p><p>Bathing in the cold wind, Lou Cheng gave a short laugh as someone’s words suddenly occurred to him: Humans are vulgar animals, faced with the unknown present, they would swallow them like hungry beasts without tasting or chewing. Only when everything was blown over, would they look back upon the past and discover the happiness that was once ignored, but would never happen again.</p><p>No wonder the theme of rebirth was popular in the novel market. Sometimes we only want to recall our old days, rather than change history.</p><p>Having stood by the lake for a long while, Lou Cheng calmed his mind and got back to the KTV box, where he sang and chatted with Yan Zheke off and on. At four o’clock, the group found it very stuffy in the box, so they decided to go out for a walk. The young ladies and gentlemen began to share old anecdotes, possibly because the beautiful mountain scenery and fresh air had evoked powerful emotions in them.</p><p>At five thirty, the tour bus came to pick up the group. They had a whole roast lamb for dinner when they got back to Xiushan. After, they went home separately.</p><p>During dinner, while his fellows were busy talking, hearing, frolicking or whispering, Lou Cheng took the chance to pig out.</p><p>In the end, Qiu Hailin, who was sitting at Old Wu’s table stood up, holding a glass with a shallow layer of red wine in it.</p><p>Looking around, she noticed Lou Cheng’s table and suddenly burst out laughing.</p><p>“Fatty Jiang, what a good appetite you have. How much mutton have you consumed? There’s still plenty of it on the other tables. No wonder you grow so fat!”</p><p>Fatty Jiang took a glance full of grievance at Lou Cheng. “I haven’t eaten that much at all,” he thought, “and I’ve been chatting, drinking, and boasting!”</p><p>It was always useful to pass the buck to your brother… Lou Cheng gave him a silent pat on the shoulder.</p><p>Having attracted all the attention in the room, Qiu Hailin began proposing a toast in her brisk voice.</p><p>“At the beginning of the gathering, we drank a toast to Teacher Wu and Teacher Xin. So let’s end it with another toast to each other and ourselves. Having been together for three years, or rather two years for those who had transferred to this class only in Year 2, we’ve spent hundreds or thousands of days together, longer than the times we’ve had with our parents. Now we’re going to part and commence to new beginnings, and there won’t be many chances for us to meet again. But I know we’ll always keep this friendship in mind, along with the memories we share.”</p><p>“Remember to smile when we meet again. May our friendship last forever. Cheers!”</p><p>She was really worth a member of the speech club… Lou Cheng smiled and raised his glass.</p><p>He had just known through chatting that Qiu Hailin had joined the speech club in Capital College.</p><p>“Cheers!”</p><p>Having finished their drinks, everyone looked excited yet a little sad.</p><p>When the group excused themselves and went home one after another, only four of them remained. Lou Cheng and Jiang Fei were waiting for Cheng Qili, who stuck to the end for more chances to chat with Qiu Hailin. In front of them were tables scattered with empty glasses and trays as a familiar sight after a banquet, breaking their sweet dreams.</p><p>Looking at the room with mixed feelings, Lou Cheng exhaled and turned to leave like the last one remaining here.</p><p>That was the end of his memory…</p><p>As to the past reproof was useless. There was no time like the present!</p><p>Like Cheng Qili’s pursuing Qiu Hailin.</p><p>Like his pursuing Yan Zheke.</p><p>…</p><p>The end of January soon came with New Year’s Eve.</p><p>While Lou Chen’s parents were preparing for visiting his grandfather, he walked into the balcony and took a photo of the leek he planted in a flowerpot.</p><p>He would spend the evening with his family while chatting with Yan Zheke and sending blessing messages to classmates and friends like Little Ming. So he only a little time this afternoon to call his master to wish him a happy new year.</p><p>After a few beeps, Lou Cheng heard the familiar husky voice. “Good boy. I hadn’t expected you to call me.”</p><p>“Yup! Happy New Year!” Lou Cheng replied happily.</p><p>“I’m not happy at all!” Geezer Shi complained, “They always control me, and I have to hide my smoking and drinking!”</p><p>“Ha ha, who dares to control you?” Lou Cheng could not help laughing.</p><p>Lou Cheng always thought his lonely master was leaving by himself. Ugh, he must receive a good beating if Geeser Shi knew it.</p><p>Geezer Shi sighed and answered, “My daughter and her husband.”</p><p>“Please say hello to my senior sister and her husband.” Lou Cheng was very polite.</p><p>Sensing the joy in his master’s words, Lou Cheng laughed silently at the Geezer Shi’s dishonesty.</p><p>After a few civilities, Geezer Shi said, “Now that you call me, I have something to say.”</p><p>“What is it?” Lou Cheng was surprized and curious.</p><p>Geezer Shi coughed and then answered, “Next semester’s national competition has nothing to do with us. There’re still eight to nine months for us to prepare for the next district contest in the coming semester. Since we can’t merely rely on constant practice and pair exercise for such a long time, I’ll find you some chances for actual combat. Or you’ll be easily defeated in district contest for lacking experience.”</p><p>“Practice in actual combat? How to do that?” Lou Cheng was so excited.</p><p>Geezer Shi explained, “In other universities, they often do pair exercise with neighbor martial arts clubs or schools. Sometimes they’d even join in small challenge tournaments in batches. But all these training methods are far from enough in my opinion for lacking intensity, which can’t enable you to beat those top teams like Shanbei University. While you are going to step into the professional rank, Lin Que and other students are also growing. So we can join in the next preliminaries as a team.”</p><p>“Preliminaries?” Lou Cheng blurted out in surprise.</p><p>Is he going to join in the preliminaries?</p><p>“Why are you so surprised? Preliminaries will offer you more chances to fight in actual combat with mighty ones. Considering the average level, you won’t stay long in the preliminaries, and thus affect the coming district contest in the second half of this year. Try your best, and you may get some martial arts scrolls or rewards,” Geezer Shi laughed.</p><p>Lou Cheng was somehow excited. It is the preliminary for professional martial arts rank!</p><p>“Master, will this affect our studying time, since there are home competitions and road competitions for preliminaries…?” Lou Cheng was worried.</p><p>“Hey,” Geezer Shi said, “don’t look down on your master. I’ll inform the organizing committee to arrange our away competitions on the weekend. It’s a district contest and you needn’t go far away.”</p><p>Then he added, “Take this opportunity to practice in actual combat and try to promote yourself. Then directly sign up for the Ranking Event of Professional Ninth Pin at the end of April!”</p><p>“Directly sign up for the Ranking Event of Professional Ninth Pin… ” Lou Cheng gulped in surprise but soon felt excited and cheered up.</p><p>Would his first Ranking Event be for professional level?</p><p>That was very possible since everyone has the right to pursue his or her dream!</p><p>After the call, Lou Cheng could hardly wait to share the good news with Yan Zheke. But he finally decided to keep it to himself until the count-down during New Years!</p><p>Then he would find an excuse to enter the new year with Yan Zheke with the cheering sound of fireworks!</p><p>He would thus occupy her time from the past year to the coming one!</p><p>How clever I am!</p><p>His parents had almost finished preparing when Lou Cheng walked back to the living room. Then he got into his room secretly to fetch his gifts for them</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
