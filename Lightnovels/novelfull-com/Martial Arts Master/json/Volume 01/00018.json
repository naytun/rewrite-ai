On the Zhaoshan Lake, wavelets spread. A chill could be felt in the air.</p><p>Lou Cheng intended to give Yan Zheke a hand to help her get on the boat, but she hopped in swiftly like a deer without causing much of a wobble.</p><p>“Her martial arts skills are higher than mine… I can’t save the beauty. I don’t even have a chance to help the beauty…” Lou Cheng laughed at himself in his mind and stepped on the boat carefully. Sitting facing each other, they each held an oar.</p><p>“I wanted to give you a hand,” Yan Zheke grinned. The lake breeze lightly blew her long black hair.</p><p>“A beauty saves a hero?” Lou Cheng pretended to be in shock as Casanova asked him to be funny if unsure what to say.</p><p>As he expected, Yan Zheke chuckled. “Cheng, do you know how to boat?”</p><p>“Not really…” Lou Cheng answered honestly. He had no such chance when he was little. He had no free time in high school. Last summer holiday he went wild with all the martial arts competitions and news, get-togethers with friends, and surfing the internet. How could he have time for boating?</p><p>Yan Zheke pursed her lips and put on a serious look with her flashing eyes.</p><p>“Hah… Neither do I…”</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed loud. “Aren’t you a southern girl?”</p><p>Cai Zongming and You Fangfang, and Zhao Qiang and Zhuang Xiaojun had started rowing while Qiu Zhigao and Guo Qing’s boat was spinning with Zhang Jingye and Pan Xue’s.</p><p>“I grew up in Xiushan. Anyway, not every southern girl can swim and boat. Neither of my two elder cousins can.” Yan Zheke found him brusque but amusing.</p><p>Lou Cheng wiped his mouth to not dig into Yan Zheke’s family situation and beamed. “Looks like we can’t generalize about anything. Well, as we are both new to this, it can be fun to learn boating together.”</p><p>Yan Zheke slightly nodded and pointed at Zhao Qiang and Zhuang Xiaojun with her chin as her hands held tightly on the oar. “They are doing pretty well. Let’s learn.”</p><p>“Sure.” Lou Cheng looked at them and tried to row like Zhao Qiang.</p><p>His oar stirred up ripples on the surface but the boat didn’t move forward and moved around in a circle.</p><p>Yan Zheke joined the action, rowing the boat like a young lady on her way to pick water caltrops. However beautiful the scene was, their boat was still spinning. The pair looked into each other’s eyes, helpless and amused.</p><p>Lou Cheng intended to earn some credit. He had thought about boating. In an unhurried manner, he sent all his thoughts to his Dantian while pondering on Jindan (the Golden Elixir) to achieve peace. When the surroundings quieted down, the nebula started to rotate. Every inch of his body displayed in his mind. Every movement of the boat and every wave could be sensed clearly.</p><p>Slowly, his oar rose and fell, stirring up waves. Forces came and went, presenting in Lou Cheng’s mind. He accordingly adjusted direction and posture to correspond to the boat’s movement.</p><p>At the same time, he noticed Yan Zheke also suddenly became very good at it. Her strokes, Lou Cheng’s rowing and the waves reinforced each other perfectly.</p><p>Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke’s four eyes met.</p><p>“Your Yin-Yang Stance is getting there?”</p><p>“You’ve mastered Yin-Yang Stance?”</p><p>They said in unison with surprise and then smiled at each other as some mutual understanding developed.</p><p>As the man here, Lou Cheng took the initiative to answer, “Honestly I’m pretty gifted in meditation. During the first Yin-Yang Stance practice, I achieved Remain in One Stage. Otherwise, how could I survive the past three weeks?”</p><p>Yan Zheke looked impressed with her beautiful dark eyes filled with astonishment. “It took you only one to reach peace?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Lou Cheng nodded sincerely.</p><p>Subconsciously, Yan Zheke pouted and blew a sigh. “I thought I was doing pretty well to achieve peace in ten days.”</p><p>“It’s an exception. I have nothing else to show off in front of you. Achieving peace in ten days is very good. It took many well-known martial artists half a month to get there,” Lou Cheng attempted to comfort her.</p><p>They had been talking about everything concerning the martial arts training but their personal progress.</p><p>“No need to comfort me with these kind words. I’m not that narrow-minded,” chuckled Yan Zheke as her tiny despondence faded away. She heavily nodded. “From now on, you are my idol! Reaching peace in one day is rare in the entire martial arts history.”</p><p>“Please don’t. I don’t deserve it,” said Lou Cheng with modesty and pride. He quickly changed the topic. “What is your level? I kinda remember you were of no rank when we signed up for the training.”</p><p>Kinda remember? He was damn sure.</p><p>The couple played good teamwork and the boat slowly set off. Yan Zheke said after some thought. “I grew up studying martial arts with my uncle-in-law. By Grade Nine I had reached the level of Amateur Ninth Pin but I didn’t attend any Ranking Event. I had no time to practice during high school so my progress over the past three years was minor. According to Qing, I was between the level of Amateur Seventh and Eighth Pin at our first pair exercise. Since I was introduced to Yin-Yang Stance, I have made rapid progress. Yesterday Qing told me I’m pretty much at the Amateur Sixth Pin level now.” Her voice rose a bit, adorably showing how proud of herself she was.</p><p>“How brilliant! You’ve leveled up in merely three weeks. You are my idol!” Lou Cheng gave Yan Zheke a taste of her own words.</p><p>According to Yan Zheke’s training experience, she could have been at the level of amateur fourth or fifth pin upon entering the university if she put more effort on martial arts during high school. Her progress of one level within three weeks was the result of her previous accumulation and great potential, very different from Lou Cheng’s fast catching up from scratch.</p><p>Upon hearing Lou Cheng’s sincere compliment, Yan Zheke flushed and burst into a brighter smile which was soon replaced by a sigh and gloom when some thoughts flashed across her mind.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Lou Cheng sounded concerned.</p><p>Yan Zheke continued rowing and waited for a dozen seconds before answering, “By the old sayings, I was congenitally deficient. I would be struggling in a sickbed had I not been practicing martial arts. However, the defect of my body can never be made up for so I can never put everything together perfectly and become responsive enough to enter the Danqi stage, the entry level of real martial arts.</p><p>“Because of this, whenever I see a martial arts talent, I envy him and have high expectation of him.”</p><p>Yan Zheke’s sorrow and helplessness softened Lou Cheng’s heart and filled it with pity and tenderness. He longed to tell her that he would achieve her martial arts dream.</p><p>Actions meant more than words. Bragging would make him look frivolous.</p><p>Until this moment, he started to understand why Yan Zheke had Lin Que in such high regards, just like other girls, and what she really meant when she said that everyone had their future and it didn’t have to be martial arts. She was comforting Lou Cheng as well as herself.</p><p>“Senior brother Li Mao told me I’m pretty much at the Amateur Ninth Pin level from my performance during our pair exercise,” he said in a calm but firm tone, gazing into Yan Zheke’s eyes.</p><p>Yan Zheke seemed stunned. “You have already reached the level of Amateur Ninth Pin?”</p><p>She knew clearly how ordinary Lou Cheng was three weeks ago. With no previous martial arts training, he became proficient in martial arts basics in three weeks?</p><p>Besides his talent in meditation… What level would he achieve in three months and in one year?</p><p>“Senior brother Li Mao said so,” Lou Cheng kept it short.</p><p>Yan Zheke looked at him blankly. Her dark eyes were like two bottomless ponds. She remained silent for a good while before opening her mouth again.</p><p>“You must train harder.”</p><p>“Yes,” Lou Cheng nodded solemnly.</p><p>The two didn’t slow down their rowing while talking. Great teamwork and good boating techniques soon helped them catch up with Qiu Zhigao and Guo Qing.</p><p>As they were passing, Guo Qing suddenly scooped water with her oar at Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke, forcing them to slow down to avoid getting wet.</p><p>“Qiu Zhigao, you row the boat. I’ll baffle their advance!” Guo Qing shouted complacently.</p><p>Yan Zheke found her brusque but amusing. She turned to Lou Cheng. “Counterattack?”</p><p>Reading itch in her eyes, Lou Cheng answered with no hesitation.</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>“Keep the boat steady.” With joy in her eyes, Yan Zheke bit her lips and merrily splashed water with her oar.</p><p>Lou Cheng zipped up his jacket and concentrated on the changes of the boat and the waves. He rowed carefully to balance off the force from Yan Zheke’s moves and keep the boat advancing smoothly. On the other side, Old Qiu couldn’t keep the boat steady upon Guo Qing’s big moves, which was kind of holding her back.</p><p>Two Yin-Yang Stance masters of course had better control over coordination. Their superiority to others was obvious. Soon enough they passed Guo Qing and Lao Qiu and caught up with the other boats. Screams and splashes rose together with laughter and yell.</p><p>Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke took the lead and boated around the island in the lake before returning to the starting point. The pair smiled at each other and the tacit understanding further developed.</p><p>“Let’s do it again. Doraemon won’t lose!” Cai Zongming and You Fangfang, the second to arrive, shouted dramatically using a popular online phrase.</p><p>One lap after another, the girls had great fun but also felt exhausted. As the sun was setting, they suggested leaving for the restaurant to beat the line.</p><p>Led by Lou Cheng and Cai Zongming, the boys pitched in to cover the expenses.</p><p>At the bank, the good runner Lou Cheng got off with ease and no weariness at all. He reached his hands out to Yan Zheke.</p><p>Completely worn out, would she jump out directly?</p><p>Lou Cheng’s heart was beating fast. Yan Zheke didn’t hesitate but grabbed his hand to get out of the boat. With all the advantages they had, still her hair got wet. Some threads stuck on her cheeks, making her a gorgeous lotus coming out of clear waters.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Yan Zheke tidied up her hair.</p><p>Lou Cheng answered delicately, “I always find girls with wet hair in those TV dramas extraordinarily beautiful.”</p><p>Yan Zheke moved her eyes and flashed a glance at him.</p><p>“I’ll get changed.”</p><p>Lou Cheng said with a sudden realization, “In that bag are your clothes?”</p><p>“Yeah, clothes can easily get wet while boating. Of course, I have prepared some to change,” Yan Zheke said to him smiling. “Careless boys like you probably wouldn’t think about it.”</p><p>“My leather jacket is okay with water,” Lou Cheng wiped water off his jacket. “Smart, right?”</p><p>Yan Zheke rolled her eyes before pacing toward the luggage storage.</p><p>Watching her figure disappear at the women’s locker room, Lou Cheng’s heart was full of joy. He couldn’t stop pacing back and forth.</p><p>The politeness sitting between Yan Zheke and him had gone. The frown and supercilious look of her were the best proof.</p><p>Still a long way to go till they could hold hands but indeed their relationship had improved.</p><p>…</p><p>They booked taxis to take them back to the university. The group of ten then went to Old Li Restaurant, a place well known through the town for its stewed pig’s trotters with white kidney bean soup. The milky clear broth full of fragrance and soft white kidney beans full of nutrition were very delicious, making the girls’ mouths water.</p><p>After dinner, the group walked leisurely back to Songcheng University while talking about each other’s silly moves and awkward moments from this afternoon. Laughter accompanied them all the way back to the second block of the girls’ dormitory.</p><p>Yan Zheke lived in the third block, not far from the other girls. Lou Cheng walked her back to the gate.</p><p>“See you tomorrow at the training,” said and waved Lou Cheng with a big smile.</p><p>Yan Zheke smiled with her dimples dancing and waved back. “See you.”</p><p>Watching her enter the dormitory building, Lou Cheng knew she would be busy taking a shower. He strolled to the lake instead of catching up with Cai Zongming.</p><p>What a wonderful day! How could he sleep without some good exercise?</p><p>…</p><p>In the lakeside grove, Wu Dong, a senior member of the Martial Arts Club, was drinking and smoking with two sophisticated friends. The new campus of Songcheng University was only open to the public on the weekends. Postmen were the exceptions.</p><p>“Sigh, it has been terrible recently. Ever since that Lin Que came to the Martial Arts Club, no one paid much attention to me at all,” Wu Dong said dispiritedly after a sip of beer.</p><p>A young man with a tattoo on his neck responded, “You and senior brother Chen together can’t even knock him down?”</p><p>“We’ll graduate soon. Nobody wants to get in big trouble. With a bad record, how can we find a job?” Wu Dong burnished his image.</p><p>Suddenly, he squinted his eyes and grunted.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” The other young man with short hair followed Wu Dong’s eyes and found Lou Cheng running toward their direction with a bright smile.</p><p>“A little rat from the Martial Arts Club,” Wu Dong said irritably.</p><p>The man with tattoos laughed. “What a chance! Wanna have some fun?”</p><p>“I’d rather not. If something happened, you guys could run but what could I do?” Wu Dong wanted to give vent to him but was also afraid.</p><p>“Don’t worry. We know when to stop. Just give him a small lesson.” The short-haired man had too much energy to use and continued to instigate. “A fight between students happens every day. Who would bring it to teachers if no major injury is caused? We will do the job. You don’t have to take part.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
