Lou Cheng’s post, with its eye-catching title, grabbed attention immediately.</p>\n<p>A reply popped up from an ID named “Above the Sky.” The avatar showed a rock and roll teenage girl. “Second floor! Become my apprentice, and I’ll share my secrets!”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng felt a rush of excitement. She was well-known in the forum. He almost called her master, but then Yan Zheke’s name echoed in his mind. A pang of guilt hit him. How could he flirt when his heart belonged to someone else?</p>\n<p>Just then, another reply appeared. “A Plumber Eating Mushrooms” chimed in: “First, get yourself some workout clothes. Then, stroll into class a few minutes late. Wear a serious face and walk steadily. When you meet your coach, say, ‘I’m sorry. I got hurt in a match earlier. Restorative exercises will be fine for me today.’ If the coach agrees, you can practice tai chi or stretch. If not, give him a serious look and stand your ground. You’ll be fine. Quick question—can you beat the coach?”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng chuckled at the joke. “What if I can’t beat the coach?” he replied.</p>\n<p>As he hit send, the page refreshed, revealing more replies.</p>\n<p>“Okamoto’s Fan” wrote: “Is your coach a woman? Go after her! Make her laugh!”</p>\n<p>“Invincible Punch” added: “We don’t have that issue at our martial arts school. Behave yourself if you can’t beat the coach.”</p>\n<p>“Road to the Arena” suggested: “Slip your coach some cash on the side. With no experience, just pretend to be a fighter. It took me a lot of effort to get into martial arts.”</p>\n<p>“Outspoken” advised: “Work out until you’re stronger. Otherwise, you’ll struggle during practice, and even the girls will outshine you. How humiliating would that be?”</p>\n<p>These four were regulars on the forum. Although Lou Cheng was new, he had spent enough time there to recognize them. “Okamoto’s Fan” was notorious for turning any topic into a dirty joke. “Invincible Punch” was a martial arts student, older than Lou Cheng, already an Amateur First Pin, and well-respected for his insightful analyses. “Road to the Arena” often boasted about his wealth and connections to famous masters, claiming to have a Professional Ninth Pin certificate. “Outspoken,” true to his name, often offended others with his bluntness.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng replied to each of them: “Sorry to disappoint, but my coach is an old man,” to “Okamoto’s Fan”; “Take it easy…” to “Invincible Punch”; “I’m just a student saving money for myself,” to “Road to the Arena”; and “You’re right. I hardly exercised in high school. I wasted my summer hanging around. I need to work on my strength,” to “Outspoken.”</p>\n<p>More replies flooded in.</p>\n<p>“Unparalleled Dragon King” asked: “Martial Arts Club in a university? Which one? If you’re in Shanbei, Capital, or Huahai, ask Peng Leyun or Ren Li for their autographs! They’re true geniuses and will be top fighters one day. Last year, they beat their seniors in the National Martial Arts Competitions. I don’t know why they’re still in school. Seize the chance to find them!”</p>\n<p>“Wonton Seller” sent a cute emoji and wrote: “Go get them, Little Tiger! Keep working on your strength!”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng felt a mix of pride and embarrassment. “Please don’t mention my school,” he replied to “Unparalleled Dragon King.” He had spent his senior year focused on the national exam, not on martial arts competitions.</p>\n<p>“Wonton Seller” was a lively girl in her second year of high school, well-liked by the older members. Lou Cheng smiled as he typed, “Why not wish me luck in dominating the martial arts scene at the university?”</p>\n<p>He continued to engage with the forum, prioritizing replies to those who were close to “Pig-Riding Knight,” the moderator. This small group included “A Plumber Eating Mushroom,” “Above the Sky,” “Unparalleled Dragon King,” and “Wonton Seller.”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng had never owned a PC until high school. Once he did, he had to balance studying with his newfound online interests. After the national exam, he dove into the online world, enjoying discussions with like-minded individuals.</p>\n<p>As he read through the replies, he noticed the sky darkening. “Wonton Seller” had posted again: “You’re not even an Amateur Ninth Pin, Little Tiger. How can you dominate the martial arts clubs? Stick to where you are and find a good job!”</p>\n<p>He chuckled, typing a response when he heard a soft knock at the door. Turning, he saw Cai Zongming looking sheepish. “Cheng, go enjoy your dinner. I have to treat some folks from my hometown tonight.”</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng made a playful gesture, fingers pointing down and thumbs out. Dusk was settling in, and he dreaded the long lines in the cafeteria. He powered down his PC and hurried out.</p>\n<p>The dining hall was still relatively empty. Lou Cheng approached the counter and ordered, “Rice with potatoes and beef, and lots of gravy, please.”</p>\n<p>Thanks to university subsidies, meals were affordable yet filling. He could eat well for under 20 Yuan a day. If he ordered less meat, he could manage with just 10 Yuan. However, the cafeteria’s food quality varied daily, earning it the nickname “the Ninth Style of Cooking in China.”</p>\n<p>At Songcheng University, the braised potatoes and beef were a treat. They simmered in rich gravy, the potatoes tender enough to melt in your mouth. Lou Cheng savored the juicy beef, far better than the bland lean cuts.</p>\n<p>Content after his meal, Lou Cheng planned to return to his room for video games or a chat with Yan Zheke on QQ. Suddenly, he recalled “Outspoken’s” comment.</p>\n<p>“I’m not strong enough. I need to work out more. I can’t embarrass myself in the Martial Arts Club, especially in front of Yan Zheke…” he murmured. He decided to take a stroll by Weishui Lake, planning to jog a lap or two after dinner. As the saying goes, sharpen your spear before battle.</p>\n<p>Songcheng University was downtown, and with the student population growing, a new campus was built in the suburbs, known for its beautiful landscaping. Weishui Lake was part of this campus—a small lake with misty waters, surrounded by lush grass and the sweet songs of nightingales, resembling a picturesque painting.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng walked around the lake, nearing an undeveloped area. The darkness loomed, and a chill wind blew. He felt a shiver of fear, imagining ghosts and monsters lurking in the shadows.</p>\n<p>He tightened his coat and quickened his pace, eager to leave the eerie spot. Perhaps there were no ghosts, but robbers could be hiding nearby.</p>\n<p>After running for a bit, he began to pant, fatigue creeping in. He slowed down, taking deep breaths.</p>\n<p>Suddenly, a sound from the lake caught his attention. He turned to see a black carp thrashing about, about 20 cm long. Its scales were dry and marked with scorch marks, as if singed by fire.</p>\n<p>The carp leaped high, landing on its back. The other side glistened with white frost, as if freshly pulled from a freezer.</p>\n<p>“What the…” Lou Cheng gasped. How could a carp be half roasted and half raw?</p>\n<p>As he prepared to flee, the carp stopped moving. Its belly split open, revealing something shimmering inside. It looked like a glowing moon, cold and bright, casting an ethereal light around it.</p>\n<p>Curiosity piqued, Lou Cheng stepped closer. Inside the carp’s belly lay a ball, sparkling like it was encrusted with crystals. As he approached, the ball reflected the universe, resembling a spinning nebula. Each crystalline piece was a planet, surrounded by light purple flames—a fusion of fire and ice.</p>\n<p>Lou Cheng frowned, murmuring to himself, “It looks like a Jindan from a martial arts novel.”</p>\n<p>The crystal nebula beckoned him, but he hesitated, recalling the warnings he had read online.</p>\n<p>“Never touch strange stuff!”</p>\n<p>“Never touch unidentified objects!”</p>\n<p>His search results had startled him. A martial arts website explained: “In ancient times, the martial arts world was divided. Some sought to transcend human limits and achieve immortality, living in seclusion and practicing alternative martial arts. They called themselves immortality trainers. After centuries, we discovered they had succeeded in cultivating internal alchemy but failed to pass on their secrets. Remember, a human’s strength is limited sometimes…”</p>\n<p>“A human’s strength is limited sometimes…” Lou Cheng repeated, feeling a flicker of understanding.</p>\n<p>“Could this glowing ball be the true ‘internal alchemy,’ left behind by the last immortality trainer, accidentally swallowed by a black carp in a cave?”</p>\n<p>“Is this my destiny?”</p>\n<p>“Or is it dangerous, and I’ll end up like that black carp?”</p>\n<p>He pondered the possibilities. Opportunities that could change one’s life were rare. If he missed this chance, would he regret it forever?</p>\n<p>After a deep breath, he shed his coat, wrapping his right hand in it. He stepped forward slowly, ready to grasp the ball with utmost care.</p>\n<p>As the saying goes, never let go of any opportunity, but always tread carefully, as if walking on thin ice!</p>",
