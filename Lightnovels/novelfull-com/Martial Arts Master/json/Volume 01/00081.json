Du Liyu had his own little circle of friends and wanted to sit with his best pal, Xiong Tao. So, when Lou Cheng sat down next to him, he was bewildered and confused.</p><p>Xiong Tao just stood there until Qin Rui was done talking. He tapped on Lou Cheng’s shoulder and said, “Ay, Lou Cheng, why are you sitting in my seat? ”</p><p>“I’ve something to ask Du Liyu. I’ll return the seat to you soon. Sorry about that. ” Lou Cheng looked at Xiong Tao in the eyes and answered him in a neither proud nor humble way.</p><p>Xiong Tao was a little mad at first. However, once he caught Lou Cheng’s eyes and heard his honest and confident voice, the anger dissipated. He laughed and said, “About what? Can I listen? ”</p><p>“Just gossip. ” Lou Cheng turned to Du Liyu and smiled. “Could you share your experience? ”</p><p>Du Liyu realized what Lou Cheng was talking about. He pointed at Jiang Fei who was seated behind and exclaimed. “Fatty Jiang, we said it would be kept secret! ”</p><p>Jiang Fei brushed it off and said lazily, “Don’t you already know that I have a big mouth? ”</p><p>Cheng Qili who was sitting next to him, burst out laughing.</p><p>Du Liyu was upset and amused at the same time. “No wonder Song Li said that everyone in his class knew about it. It’s all because of your big mouth! I was still trying to recall if anyone else had seen me. ”</p><p>“Sacrificing yourself for your pals! Good job Fatty Jiang! ” Lou Cheng secretly praised Fatty Jiang, grinned and said, “So, tell us honestly, if not we’ll torture you. ”</p><p>It is kind of bizarre if you think about it. Though Du Liyu was not close to Lou Cheng, with Lou Cheng’s confidence and natural poise, the barrier between them disappeared and he became somewhat comfortable with Lou Cheng. Without much thought, he said, “What’s there to say? Isn’t it just like that? ”</p><p>As his best pal, obviously Xiong Tao knew that Du Liyu and Song Li were dating. Instead of trying to find another seat, he stood next to Lou Cheng and leaned against the back of the seat. With an arm propped up on the seat, he said cheekily, “Details! We want to hear the details! ”</p><p>It’s always easy to stir a commotion and gather everyone with such topics.</p><p>Copying Little Ming, Lou Cheng looked at Du Liyu and pointed at Xiong Tao. “Did you hear that? It’s the crowd’s wish! The crowd’s desire! Spill it! How did you and Song Li start? ”</p><p>He was not loud so the interest and noise were confined to the two rows. Noticing this made Du Liyu relaxed a little. He scratched his head and said, “Aren’t we in one city? After the semester started, a senior brother organized a gathering for our people from our province. You know right, she was close to Yan Zheke. The two of them were often together and were quite popular in our year. I was surprized and excited to meet someone from home. So, with the adrenaline rush, I gathered enough courage to ask for her number and QQ account. She seemed happy to share. No signs of rejection then. ”</p><p>“Yup, one of life’s greatest happiness is to meet someone from the same hometown when away from home. But damn! This is turning a heartwarming family reunion of two from the same hometown, to romantic union! ” With his ears all sharp, Jiang Fei could not help but throw an insult at Du Liyu.</p><p>“Then? Did you start to woo her? ” There was no need for Lou Cheng to follow up. Xiong Tao helped to ask most enthusiastically ever.</p><p>Du Liyu gave him a stare and continued, “How can that be? We just talked and then got to know each other better. Sometimes she will ask me for help or ask me along for some short trips. Look, she’s kind of good looking. Besides being fiery sometimes, she’s a bubbly girl. So I couldn’t help liking her. ”</p><p>Fiery… Lou Cheng made a silent note for the term. He teased Du Liyu. “From what you’ve said, she’s the one who started it? ”</p><p>He knew about the gathering of the people from the local province. However, he and Yan Zheke had started on their special training. Classes took up the rest of the time. Since they could never afford the time to join the gatherings, they just decided to ignore this bunch of people.</p><p>“I think that’s about it… She was always looking for me. My roommates were all saying that such classmate relationship will eventually evolve into some adultery, ” Du Liyu said with a hint of arrogance in his words.</p><p>“I don’t trust your words. Song Li, such a good girl would be interested in you? ” Xiong Tao poked fun at Du Liyu’s explanation.</p><p>Du Liyu smiled and replied to the joke. “I’ve no idea too. Maybe she feels that I’m matured enough…”</p><p>Urgh! Lou Cheng, Jiang Fei, Xiong Tao and Cheng Qili made a puking action.</p><p>“What are you all talking about? Sounds fun! ” Qiu Hailin walked towards them in the middle section, greeting everyone while she made her way to the back. Anyone would have thought she was their teacher.</p><p>“We’re talking about Du Liyu and… and Song Li from Class Three. ” Big-mouthed Jiang Fei was ready to broadcast the news to everyone. As he was talking, Du Liyu tried to cover his mouth to stop him from talking, but Jiang Fei smartly dodged Du Liyu’s hands.</p><p>Qiu Hailin looked at them with doe eyes and asked, “Du Liyu and Song Li are dating? ”</p><p>“Yes, buddy, we’re seeking his advice on how to woo girls. Care to join? ” Lou Cheng joked and shot a glance at Cheng Qili, hinting him to repeat what they were talking about to Qiu Hailin.</p><p>What they said piqued Qiu Hailin’s interest. Gossipy Hailin decided to join the conversation. “Not bad, Du Liyu! You’re bringing honor to our class. I heard that some Jia person in Class Three also chased Song Li. ”</p><p>“I know. Song Li mentioned before. He’s called Jia Yue. Pretentious fellow, always trying to show that he’s intelligent and scholarly. She doesn’t like him at all, ” Du Liyu said with a small laugh.</p><p>“How does it feel being in love? ” Lou Cheng tried to steer the conversation towards the direction he wanted, trying his best to be a good spy and traitor.</p><p>Du Liyu paused to think for a while before he responded. “There’s no way to describe it. It was amazingly sweet in the beginning. Now, it’s alright. Though she’s a little naggy, the rest of it is still good. ”</p><p>After listening to him, Jiang Fei, who has been forever single, mumbled quietly, “So, which stage are you at already? ”</p><p>With a pfft, Qiu Hailin blushed and looked away. A flustered and embarrassed Du Liyu said angrily,</p><p>“Get lost! ”</p><p>Such matters were not meant to be discussed openly!</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed and recalled the main point that Du Liyu mentioned earlier, “Naggy… ”</p><p>Time flew by in the midst of everyone’s laughter. The bus reached the main doors of Spring Scenery Field Conference Villa, and Tang Xiaofei’s BMW was already parked nearby.</p><p>As Lou Cheng got off the bus, he met his homeroom teacher, Old Wu. He smiled and greeted his teacher.</p><p>“Mr. Wu, it has been some time since we met. You just seem to get livelier and more energetic every time we meet. ”</p><p>“Ha ha,” Old Wu laughed. “Lou Cheng, you’ve learned to say niceties huh. Last time all you’d say was ‘Hi Mr. Wu’. ”</p><p>“You make it sound like I was a kindergarten kid! Like I just learned how to talk, ” Lou Cheng said humorously.</p><p>The students who were near them could not help but laugh at their conversation. Old Wu added cheerfully, “Not bad, seems like you’ve learned a lot from college life. ”</p><p>“Yes sir, I’ve joined the Songcheng University Martial Arts Club, ” Lou Cheng replied and did a bodybuilder pose to show off his muscles.</p><p>Old Wu was very surprized. He looked at Lou Cheng carefully and said, “I know you like martial arts, but didn’t expect that you’d go and pick up martial arts. It helps to strengthen your body. You mustn’t be like me. So skinny with the strength of a mouse. ”</p><p>While they talked, everyone walked into the villa. No one stepped away from the group. They all gathered around Old Wu and Mr. Xin in the teahouse, catching up and reminiscing the good old high school days, like how Old Wu would quietly enter the class and keep watch of the students during other lessons, and how Tao Xiaofei was a rebellious child who always argued with the Teachers. He made fresh graduate teachers cry. Old Wu and Mr. Xin had fun talking about their “arduous journey” with the students.</p><p>Thinking about the past is always such a heartwarming thing. As long as they were not too terrible experiences, it is always pleasant, being transported back to your youthful teenage years without the studying stress.</p><p>Only because we cannot return to how we were and how it was, that’s why we learn how to appreciate, to treasure.</p><p>They sat there for a while. As they talked and talked, Lou Cheng felt glad that he attended the school reunion this time. Almost an hour passed before people made arrangements to go for free karaoke, play a game of badminton and ping pong, as well as hiking at the nearby hill to get some fresh air.</p><p>As for Lou Cheng and Jiang Fei, they continued to accompany Old Wu and Mr Xin. They continued to chat about the past and slowly all those dirty secrets like the truth behind the sick leave started to come out in the open.</p><p>There was no longer fear between them, more like friends.</p><p>When it was almost noon, the students gathered again to head to the South Garden Dining Hall. There were approximately 50 of them, but they still managed to squeeze five tables. Each table had an abundant supply of drinks – Chinese rice wine, red wine, beer, coconut juice, soya milk and orange juice.</p><p>After seeing everyone seated, Qiu Hailin stood up, raised her wine glass and with a stance of an experienced speaker, she said,</p><p>“It has been a semester since we graduated. With all of us gathered here, for the never ending youth and friendship, for Mr. Wu and Mr. Xin who have been with us for three years, taught us for three years, had high blood pressure for three years… Cheers! ”</p><p>Everyone raised their glasses and clinked it against the lazy susan in the middle of the table. Everyone started pouring drinks for each other.</p><p>Without hesitation, Lou Cheng grabbed the coconut juice and poured himself a glass.</p><p>“Ay, Lou Cheng, why’re you being such a sissy? Drinking juice! ” Tao Xiaofei, who was at the same table, commented loudly.</p><p>At least ten pairs of eyes turned to watch the commotion. Unembarrassed, Lou Cheng calmly said,</p><p>“I am off alcohol. ”</p><p>At this moment, Qiu Hailin raised her glass again and shouted,</p><p>“Cheers! ”</p><p>Just as she said cheers, Tao Xiaofei loudly declared, “Hold on a second. We have someone here who’s faking it. Like a girl! Using some juice in place of proper drinks! ”</p><p>In no time, everyone’s eyes were on Lou Cheng and his glass filled with clean white coconut juice.</p><p>In the past, Lou Cheng would have turned red from embarrassment, looked for a hole to hide in or quickly change the juice into a proper drink so that he need not have to tolerate the embarrassment. This time, he was calm. He did not feel that it was a big matter. Lou Cheng looked at everyone, raising his glass and voice, he said, “Mr. Wu, Mr. Xin and everyone, I’m now training with Songcheng University’s Martial Arts Club and have stopped drinking. So in place of a drink, a toast to all with this glass of coconut juice! ”</p><p>That rich classmate of his is actually a rather nice person. He never bullied anyone and liked a dirty joke or two. Also, Tao Xiaofei was a little self-centered, just like now, not caring much about other people’s feelings.</p><p>Obviously he would not accept Lou Cheng’s explanation. In a displeased manner, he said, “We haven’t met in a while, what’s wrong with a drink? What harm would a drink bring? Can’t you just pick up a proper drink just for Mr. Wu, Mr. Xin and the rest of us? Not sporting enough! ”</p><p>Lou Cheng looked straight into his eyes, and without any change in his smile, he firmly said, “Didn’t Mr. Wu teach us? A small leak can sink a great ship. Such things, once you start drinking, you’ll never stop again. ”</p><p>Tao Xiaofei was about to argue, but Old Wu raised his glass and said,</p><p>“Alright, alright. Since everyone’s here to have fun, let’s just have fun. Those who want liquor, can have liquor, those who want juice, can have juice. No compelling others. Girls, if you’ve to say no, say no. ”</p><p>He gulped down the tiny bit of Chinese white wine left in his glass and declared,</p><p>“Cheers! For the three years we had together! ”</p><p>“Cheers! ” The rest of the students echoed and finished off whatever remained in their glasses.</p><p>As Lou Cheng sat down, Jiang Fei leaned over and said in awe, ” I wouldn’t be able to take the pressure you were under just now. It could have been resolved with just a sip. I’m sure a sip doesn’t mean you’re back drinking alcohol. Can’t believe you actually stood your stand. ”</p><p>“It’s just a test of my willpower I guess. If I can’t take this level of pressure, how am I going to continue my martial arts training? ” Lou Cheng responded in a nonchalant manner.</p><p>At the table, Tao Xiaofei clearly showed his displeasure but did not pick on Lou Cheng. He was only a little colder as compared to the time that they first met.</p><p>After dinner, Qin Rui asked everyone to gather at the North Garden to wait for the competition to start. He excitedly announced that a representative of the Foundation would be coming to watch the competition. So, if anyone performs well, he or she might just get some sponsorship for the preliminaries next year. Upon hearing the news, both teams valued the competition even more.</p><p>At the entrance of the North Garden, Qin Rui joined the rest of the people from the Gushan Martial Arts School. Tao Xiaofei who frequented bars, seemed to know these fighters. He joined and began to chat with the leader of the pack. The mafia and martial arts school were always intricately linked. Many gangsters after making some money, would want to upgrade themselves. Learning orthodox martial arts would help them secure and improve their standing in the gang. Since Tao Xiaofei and Qin Rui were classmates, it was not surprizing that Tao Xiaofei was buddies with the fighters of the Gushan Martial Arts School.</p><p>“Do you think Tao Xiaofei will get the Gushan Martial Arts School people to pick on you? ” Busybody Jiang Fei was trying to stir some trouble.</p><p>If they were to fight, Jiang Fei would not be worried at all. With Cheng’s talent to endure, even if he could not beat them, he would probably be able to defend or run to their breaking point.</p><p>Lou Cheng glared at Jiang Fei. “Would he go that far? It’s just a drinking thing. ”</p><p>While he said that, he used Condensation Stance to eavesdrop on Tao Xiaofei.</p><p>“Brother Feng, someone told me that he’s no longer drinking because he’s doing martial arts. Is this a joke or what? ”</p><p>“You’re so good, and I don’t see you keep away from liquor. Just for fun, don’t know why he is being such a prude. He gave no face. Empty vessels make the most noise! ”</p><p>“Huh? It’s ok, it’s ok. I was just grumbling. There’s no need to fight a long time classmate over such matters. Just wouldn’t be too friendly with him in the future. ”</p><p>…</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled to himself. Tao Xiaofei is still not too bad a person. Just a little self-centered.</p><p>At this moment, Lou Cheng caught sight of a man walking towards him. He was about 30 years old, with well-maintained brush cut hair, and wore a short leather jacket and shiny leather shoes. Although his looks was average like anyone out in the streets, he was exuding so much energy that Lou Cheng could hardly ignore.</p><p>When someone is about to reach the best body refining state, their Qi would also be at its best. However, it would also be almost uncontrollable. It would be so powerful and make the person almost glow, giving off an intimidating aura.</p><p>People who have never been in contact with Professional Ninth Pin fighters would probably not notice this. However, for Lou Cheng, after being around people like Lin Que, and having fight Wang Ye, Ye Youting and Zhou Yuanning, he was now extremely sensitive, and could immediately tell that this person was one of the fighters with Professional Ninth Pin. Even if he wasn’t as strong as Lin Que or Ye Youting, his level would not be far off.</p><p>Plus, this person’s eyes were so sharp and cold, almost to the extent of abnormal. There was a sense of danger around him. If we were to call Lin Que, Ye Youting and the other Professional Ninth Pin fighters as ferocious tigers at the zoo, though capable of hurting people but they were somewhat domesticated. This was not the case for the fighter in front of him. He was just like a wolf in the wild.</p><p>“A current Professional Ninth Pin… Could he be the main fighter brought in by the foundation? They haven’t started, have they? ” Thoughts ran across Lou Cheng’s mind, and kept his eyes on the person who continued to walk and approach his team.</p><p>As they were about to pass each other, the leather jacket man suddenly staggered and knocked into the young leader of the fighters, who was standing next to Tao Xiaofei.</p><p>The young leader was tall, muscular, and had big bright eyes. He frowned and said, “Watch where you’re going. ”</p><p>The leather jacket man widened his eyes and returned the stare.</p><p>“You walk with your eyes shut? ”</p><p>After he spoke, his Qi burst out suddenly. He transformed into a hungry wolf, waiting to hunt and kill his prey.</p><p>Lou Cheng saw the light instantly. This person was here to make trouble!</p><p>To stir trouble for the Gushan Martial Arts School!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
