Something called ambition!</p><p>“Can I? Really?”</p><p>Trembling slightly with his ambition burning, Lou Cheng threw away his arrogance and complacency from defeating Wu Dong with wits, tact, and strength completely.</p><p>He quickly changed the topic. “Master, can we make our way to the National Finals this time?”</p><p>The National University Martial Arts Competitions consisted of eight conferences, of which the top two of each could advance to the final stage. Divisional tournaments took place from November to January every year and the finals started in May.</p><p>Geezer Shi rolled his eyes. “Your master is not almighty! Wanna be one of the top two after a one-month special training?”</p><p>“But we‘ve got Lin Que…” Lou Cheng’s voice faded as he continued, “Master, how does our Martial Arts Club stack up against other universities in this division?”</p><p>“Better than many but definitely not one of the top four. The top eight is possible.” Geezer Shi thought about it and added, “Professional Ninth Pin is a very impressive level for a freshman but not as big deal for the seniors. Songcheng University is not the only one with great talents, profound cultural foundation and highly qualified coaches. Last year’s top eight each had at least one fighter in Professional Ninth Pin. One year has passed. Some of them may have graduated but the rest won’t stay and wait for us to catch up.”</p><p>“Maybe they have become undisciplined and regressed.” Lou Cheng kept the thought to himself.</p><p>“How many students in Professional Ninth Pin does Shanbei University have?” Lou Cheng asked curiously.</p><p>The national champion of last year!</p><p>Geezer Shi smiled. “What does it have to do with you? Don‘t overreach yourself! Peng Leyun was of Professional Eighth Pin last year. Considering his talent and hard work, one year is more than enough for him to move up one level before achieving the physical invulnerability state. Their manager Xu Wannian is also of Ninth Pin but don’t underestimate him as he’s gifted with some supernatural abilities. Another Professional-Ninth-Pin student has graduated but I heard they’ve got a freshman of the same level. For martial arts talents, schools like Shanbei are much more appealing than Songcheng University.”</p><p>The gap between Songcheng University and Shanbei University in martial arts sounded huge. “Xu Wannian alone might defeat our entire club. Not to mention Peng Leyun.” Lou Cheng thought.</p><p>“Is this the distance between a good martial arts university and the national champion?”</p><p>Looking at Lou Cheng’s darkened face, Geezer Shi laughed out. “Take this year’s competition as a warm-up. When Lin Que becomes stronger, you grow mature enough, and other members improve significantly, it will be our turn to shine in the finals.”</p><p>“You grow mature enough…” Lou Cheng felt thrilled and proud and blurted out. “Master, you are thinking very highly of me!”</p><p>He scratched his head and giggled in the manner of Crayon Shin-chan.</p><p>Geezer Shi replied, “Err… Just saying. Don’t take me too seriously.”</p><p>“…” Lou Cheng faced up to cover his awkwardness.</p><p>Luckily Geezer Shi soon changed the topic. “The fight with Wu Dong yesterday must have taught you much. I’ve been watching your pair exercise with Li Mao. You are kind of proficient in basic moves. So from today I’ll teach you moves and styles of the Body Refining stage.”</p><p>What Lou Cheng had learned before was merely a combination of basic moves and skills in exerting strength.</p><p>Restraining his excitement, Lou Cheng bowed.</p><p>“Thank you, master. Which move shall we start with?”</p><p>Geezer Shi put away his casualness after a cough. “The root of my lineage is the Ice Magical Kung Fu, the lost knowledge of the Ice Sect. The nature and attributes of your moves and styles don’t matter much in the Body Refining stage. It won’t affect your achievement of the physical invulnerability state in the future. Today I’ll teach you a body refining set derived from the lost knowledge of the Ice Sect, 24 Blizzard Strikes.”</p><p>“24 Blizzard Strikes?” At this thrilling moment, Cai Zongming’s face appeared in Lou Cheng’s head. If he was here, for sure he would joke about the set, “24 Blizzard Strikes? The first move must be Call Me Daddy!”</p><p>Geezer Shi continued while Lou Cheng was tripping, “This set is known for its ferociousness and craziness but don’t let it take over your mind. Keep your head cool like water slowly becoming ice. Pairing with the explosive force of the Lightning and Fire Stance, it is definitely among the best of the Body Refining stage…” Geezer Shi began introducing the set.</p><p>Lou Cheng listened carefully. This would be his very first martial arts set.</p><p>Soon it was time for the martial arts club’s daily special training when Lou Cheng had just roughly memorized the key points of the 24 strikes.</p><p>…</p><p>Standing in front of the remaining 12 members, Geezer Shi put on a coarse voice.</p><p>“Due to an accidental injury, Wu Dong is unable to continue with the special training. We have one week left before the divisional contest of the National Martial Arts Competitions. Now let me announce our leading fighters and substitutes.”</p><p>Li Mao and other potential candidates dared not to breathe, straining the atmosphere. Yet Yan Zheke nodded slightly at Wu Dong’s misfortune and exchanged a smile with Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Three leading players are Lin Que, Chen Changhua and Sun Jian.” Of course.</p><p>Wu Dong wasn’t a match for Sun Jian based on his previous performance, even if he was not injured. Chen Changhua’s hands had fully recovered after over half a month.</p><p>Geezer Shi took a glance at Chen Changhua. “You senior students will graduate next July. We might never see each other again after that. It’s perfectly understandable if you don’t want to fight your best in this divisional contest. However, after spending three years here, of which two years as the manager, don’t you have any special feeling for this club? Four years end quickly. Don’t you want to leave something here? Don’t you want to be remembered by your junior sisters and brothers as the one who has led the Songcheng University Martial Arts Club to rise again? ”</p><p>Very few people could live without longing for fame and wealth. Chen Changhua’s expressionless face started to glow as he nodded solemnly.</p><p>“Coach Shi, here I give you my words. I’ll do my best in the competition. If we can make it to the top eight, my years of training here will be worth it.”</p><p>Geezer Shi looked pleased with his good attitude.</p><p>“To the top eight we have a good chance!”</p><p>He turned to look at the others. “Three substitutes. Li Mao, Lin Hua and Guo Qing.”</p><p>Most martial arts team events required each team to have three members who take turns to fight one of the three opponent fighters of another team. The winner of each fight would stay for the next challenge until one team’s three members were all defeated. As the list of fighters and the lineup were decided by the coach right before the contest, it was critical to predict the opponent team’s members and strategy thus to accordingly adjust their own tactics like exchange, counteraction, and dissipation.</p><p>Amateur competitions could be as fierce and brutal as those among professional martial artists with weapon license. However attentive and experienced the coaches and supervisors were, injuries couldn’t be completely prevented, making substitutes essential for the event.</p><p>Guo Qing was surprised upon hearing her own name but soon burst into a hooray and had a high-five with Yan Zheke as if she was already the champion.</p><p>“Good physical fitness, great potential plus the three-week training. You are outstanding among Amateur Five Pin fighters if not already at the level of Amateur Fourth Pin,” Geezer Shi was always kinder and sweeter to girls.</p><p>While Wu Dong was injured, all members of sophomores and juniors except Li Mao, Lin Hua and Sun Jian were of Amateur Fifth Pin, it made perfect sense to choose Guo Qing.</p><p>“What a pity Little Ming didn’t attend the special training…” Lou Cheng sighed to himself.</p><p>“Yan Zheke and Li Xiaowen, gather some girls on your martial arts lessons to form a cheering squad, enlivening the atmosphere on the stand. Lou Cheng and Wu Meng, call for two to three dozen boys to help the university guards and student union with security work,” Geezer Shi continued.</p><p>Everyone was lost. After a good while, Chen Changhua asked, “Coach Shi, what security work are we talking about?”</p><p>Geezer Shi laughed. “Don’t you know this year’s opening ceremony will be hosted in Songcheng University and we’ll have a special guest of First Pin? Don’t worry about his safety. He alone can take all of you single-handed…”</p><p>He was cut off by the students’ cheers and shouts.</p><p>“Which master?”</p><p>“Who? Who’s that?”</p><p>“Can we ask for autographs?”</p><p>Geezer Shi cleared his throat and continued, “You will soon find out. The First-Pin master needs no protection from us but should protect us. Our security work will be to help school guards and the student union to block reporters, supporters and fan club members and maintain order on campus. If there’s a chance, I’ll try to help with the autograph.”</p><p>“Long live coach Shi!” The members yelled together as if the pain and weariness from the special training had all gone.</p><p>After the cheers, they looked at each other with gentle eyes and a sense of belonging—even Chen Changhua’s gaze at Lin Que was softened.</p><p>Geezer Shi smiled and reached his hand out to quiet them down, “The conference contest is coming and we have loads to prepare. First, collect information. Split the work and gather all information and videos from last year’s regional and national competitions. As soon as the draw results are announced, all leading fights and substitutes shall start to watch the corresponding parts to learn about your opponents.”</p><p>Lin Que raised his hand. “Coach Shi, I have all this information.”</p><p>“Good. Very good. Don’t forget to send it to me. ” Geezer Shi nodded in satisfaction.</p><p>Lou Cheng had never heard so many words from Lin Que since he joined the Martial Arts Club. As Talker would say, everyone would sympathize with Songcheng University Martial Arts Club in future competitions since commentators will introduce Lin Que, the chief fighter, as a tough-minded deaf-mute…</p><p>“Secondly, in this one last week, I’ll teach you 12 strikes, the first 12 moves of 24 Blizzard Strikes from the Ice Sect.” Geezer Shi stretched his muscles and bones.</p><p>“Hehe. I can learn 24 strikes, but you can only learn half. This is my privilege…” Feeling very pleased with himself, Lou Cheng took the opportunity to review what he had already grasped.</p><p>At noon, Lou Cheng approached Yan Zheke and Guo Qing once again as always after his pair exercise.</p><p>“Which First-Pin master will come this time?” Yan Zheke took the initiative to ask, showing great curiosity.</p><p>Lou Cheng replied with a smile, “I know.”</p><p>“Who’s that?” Yan Zheke’s black eyes were shining, capturing all Lou Cheng’s attention.</p><p>“Liang Yifan from Xinghai Club.” Lou Cheng didn’t want to keep her guessing.</p><p>“Liang Yifan?” Yan Zheke’s thin face was lightened up. “He is also my idol!”</p><p>Guo Qing was the same excited.</p><p>“Many idols you have…” Lou Cheng teased.</p><p>Yan Zheke pouted her lips to make a naughty expression. “If it was the Dragon King, Cheng, would you let me break in?”</p><p>“I’m already a betrayer!” Lou Cheng answered firmly.</p><p>They both burst into laughter but soon Yan Zheke sighed. “I hope Coach Shi will get his autograph for all of us.”</p><p>“Autograph… ” Lou Cheng kept it in mind.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
