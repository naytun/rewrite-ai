In a flash his dull eyes turned into silver, cold but luminous. Deep in his eyes was a reflection of Lou Cheng.</p><p>After a moment of hesitation with a frown, the odd color faded from his eyes. He kept his hands together behind his back and moved away from Lou Cheng. He turned around a few steps later to take another look at him and then continued with his inspection as if nothing special had happened and nothing was strange to him.</p><p>The first still stance experience could be extremely boring which usually resulted in physical weariness and sourness after a short while. Geezer Shi stared at his watch and cleared his throat when the clock hit one hour and a half.</p><p>“Stop. The first still stance training is over.”</p><p>In Lou Cheng’s perception, Geezer’s Shi’s voice seemed to be coming from heaven, almost to the point Lou couldn’t tell if it was real, but in the end he quit the “remaining in one” state. All hustle and bustle, as well as men and women in reality, came back at once, filling up all his senses, which felt like another brand new world.</p><p>“How goddamn tiring Yin-Yang Stance is,” Cai Zongming complained to Lou Cheng while relaxing his legs in turn.</p><p>“Yeah, but also quite interesting,” Lou Cheng went with the flow instead of confessing that he could stand to the end of time in it.</p><p>After, Geezer Shi ordered Chen Changhua to show and explain a moving stance of their Martial Arts Club, including the skills and the divided movements. He gave them one hour to practice, which could help stretch and temper their body, naturally infusing coordination into their instinct.</p><p>During the entire practice, he was chilling in the ring with a cigarette. His total relaxation was quite annoying.</p><p>“Ok. Split the group into two. Those on my right-hand side now follow Chen Changhua to the Strength Training Gymnasium for some muscle training and the rest on my left stay to practice footwork under Lin Que’s supervision. Swap in 40 minutes,” Geezer Shi jumped out of the ring after checking his watch and shouted while holding his arm straight ahead of him, pointing at the middle of the group to split them.</p><p>Lou Cheng and Cai Zongming, both standing on the right-hand side of Geezer Shi, headed toward the weight room among half of their peers.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s right foot stumbled as he walked past Geezer Shi. His body staggered forward.</p><p>A cold sweat overspread him upon the sudden accident. His falling onto the ground face down seemed unstoppable.</p><p>However, Lou Cheng felt all the subtle changes in his muscles while in the air. Similar to the earlier meditation, he wiggled his muscles little by little almost out of instinct to adjust his weight rapidly.</p><p>As soon as one of his feet landed, he straightened his back a bit to drive his entire body forward. A few strides forth and he finally came to a stop on his feet without raising much a laugh.</p><p>He looked back but couldn’t find a clue among all the strange faces of what he had just stumbled over.</p><p>“Cheng, are you alright?” asked Cai Zongming with fright on his face.</p><p>“I’m OK. I don’t know what just happened,” answered Lou Cheng while shaking his head. He let go of the thoughts and resumed his pace.</p><p>Among the crowd, Geezer Shi still held a cigarette in his right hand while he nodded thoughtfully at Lou Cheng’s back.</p><p>In the Strength Training Gymnasium, Lou Cheng felt frustrated. Even with the aid from the Jindan he was still far from being able to push the barbell.</p><p>“It seems the Jindan can only help me get over fatigue and soreness and open up my senses to subtle changes within my body during meditation thus improving coordination and footwork training. It doesn’t quite enhance my performance in strength, speed or agility…” Lou Cheng recalled how he had almost fallen earlier and quietly summarized the benefits of the Jindan. He then doubled his effort in strength training on all his muscles to make use of the instant recovery and little weariness advantages from the Elixir, attempting to improve his strength in a short period. Cai Zongming was dearly stunned by Cheng.</p><p>…</p><p>At the end of the weight and footwork training, Lou Cheng, although strengthened and recovered by the Jindan, was sweating all over. He planned to catch up with Yan Zheke before hitting the shower with Cai Zongming. Chen Changhua, the club manager, stepped out of the troop before Geezer Shi called the end of the martial arts lesson.</p><p>“Coach Shi, the Ranking Event is coming soon but I didn’t have enough practical exercise.” Chen Changhua smiled after a glance at Lin Que, “I’d like to challenge Lin Que. Please be our referee to avoid possible injuries.”</p><p>Hearing his words, many members of the Martial Arts Club took several indrawn breaths. Chen Changhua’s dissatisfaction with Lin Que was apparent during the orientation as the club couldn’t accommodate two champions. However, no one expected such an open challenge to take place so quickly in the very first session.</p><p>“Why is he this confident?”</p><p>“Has he already overcome the rank difference and reached the level of Professional Ninth Pin?”</p><p>Lou Cheng didn’t see this coming either. He looked at Cai Zongming and then attempted to exchange a glance with Yan Zheke through the mass.</p><p>Cai Zongming clicked his tongue. “This ape is not that stupid. At least he knows he should issue the challenge as early as possible.”</p><p>“What?” Lou Cheng withdrew his eyes and turned to Cai Zongming for an explanation.</p><p>“Before reaching the Danqi stage, height and strength play a major role in martial arts, with proper use of which, an amateur of the second or third Pin does have a chance to pass the Professional Ranking Event and be qualified to receive a Professional Ninth Pin certificate. Regarding overall strength, he can level himself as Professional Ninth Pin.” With a few years of formal martial arts training, Cai Zongming explained plausibly, “Lin Que is a genius who reached the Professional Ninth Pin at the age of 18. Give him two more months or half a year and he will become even stronger. OK, he might not reach the Danqi stage yet, but for sure his progress will be much greater than that ape!”</p><p>“So Chen Changhua challenges Lin Que now, before the gap between them enlarges. He wants to defeat Lin and leave him a mental block so he can maintain his superior position till the graduation,” said Lou Cheng with a sudden realization.</p><p>“Mental block? Too many novels you must have read,” Cai Zongming glanced at Lou Cheng, “If Chen Changhua does score a victory here, the rising force may connect his willpower and physical strength to push him to a higher level. Hmm, he is probably confident that he has reached the Professional Ninth Pin level or he wouldn’t fling down the gauntlet now.”</p><p>When the pair were in a hot discussion, Geezer Shi turned to Lin Que with a grin, “Will you accept the challenge?”</p><p>“Sure,” answered Lin Que coldly, showing no emotion.</p><p>Chen Changhua turned around with a courtesy smile and strode into the ring. His bearings changed completely, like a tiger with sharpened claws or a buffalo ready to hunt.</p><p>“The manager of the Martial Arts Club is undoubtedly capable,” thought Lou Cheng, and then his eyes moved to Lin Que.</p><p>Lin wiped the sweat off his face and casually stepped toward the ring. His handsomeness and cool disposition were dazzling in the white suit, drawing all the attention.</p><p>When he stood in the ring, Lin Que maintained the same bearing. His feet resumed a T-step position with his toes slightly pointing inwards and his face showed no expression toward Chen Changhua.</p><p>After Geezer Shi slowly made his way over to be the referee position, Chen Changhua bowed with clasped hands, “Brother Lin, please grant instructions.”</p><p>Of one level lower in rank, Chen made the first move and threw himself at Lin Que like a snake.</p><p>“The ape’s footwork is not bad,” commented Cai Zongming to Lou Cheng. Known for his strength and physique, Chen Changhua’s agile footwork apparently amazed many. No wonder he dared to challenge Lin Que.</p><p>Lin Que moved his left foot to the side to dodge Chen Changhua’s attack but as soon as his left foot landed, Chen abruptly changed his style, pushing his right leg and dashing into Lin with his shoulder and arm like a wild bull.</p><p>Low screams rose from the crowd. Everyone was worried about Lin Que. Such a ferocious move made the audience tremble with fear. Lou Cheng doubted he could handle this strike without breaking an arm and a few ribs if he was in Lin Que’s position.</p><p>That was a move of the Professional Ninth Pin level!</p><p>And it was Chen Changhua’s strength but Lin Que’s weak point!</p><p>At this very moment, Lin Que hacked his back and moved his spine like a snake, pulling his left foot before it completely touched the ground to shift his weight back to the right foot. Using his right foot as the shaft, he spun to the back of Chen Changhua and launched a blow with his left elbow.</p><p>His previous move was a trap!</p><p>Chen Changhua missed his target and felt a strike coming from behind. Chen was left with no choice but to dive forward and roll over to avoid the elbow hit.</p><p>As Chen attempted to use his core to spring up while rolling, Lin Que slid over and pulled his right foot as if cracking a whip. A crispy sound burst in the air.</p><p>Pong!</p><p>Chen Changhua closed his palms in front of his body to confront this whip kick. He pulled back half a meter and blood streamed out from the split between his thumb and index finger.</p><p>Lin pushed his advantage and threw one whip kick after another at Chen’s lower legs, with his legs repeatedly hitting Chen’s palms with a crack.</p><p>Pong!</p><p>Chen Changhua got pushed out of the ring and his hands were battered to blood and pulp.</p><p>Lying on the ground, he appeared puzzled with disbelief in this cushy defeat. He didn’t even have a chance to use his well-mastered throwing skills.</p><p>Seconds of dead silence was followed by a fierce hurrah for the true capable in the hall.</p><p>Lou Cheng turned around, seeing Yan Zheke cheering with excitement on her face and both of her arms in the air.</p><p>“Awesome! You’ve earned my respect. A Professional Ninth Pin martial artist is amazing,” Little Ming murmured to himself.</p><p>Lou Cheng withdrew his eyes with all sorts of feelings twisted inside. Recalling the fight, he became enlightened suddenly.</p><p>The trick move Lin Que made to win this fight was a practical use of Yin-Yang Stance!</p><p>The key of Yin-Yang Stance, he had experienced himself clearly, was to coordinate the entire body and use strength at will. The ultimate of the Yin-Yang Stance training will be the Danqi stage.</p><p>Lin Que had apparently mastered it to some extent. His coordination and control of his body were terrifying. Didn’t anybody else notice that?</p><p>He should be very close to the Danqi stage, the Professional Eighth Pin level…</p><p>Lin Que walked down from the ring after a nod at Geezer Shi. Without a single glance at Chen Changhua, he made his way to the locker room. Wu Dong, another amateur master and a close friend of Chen, stepped out of the troop to raise Chen from the ground.</p><p>…</p><p>At lunchtime, Lou Cheng had a good appetite, wolfing down more than twice as much as his usual portion. Cai Zongming and Qiu Zhigao were in the same shoe. An intense training consumed plenty of energy and their body was crying for a refill though they did take a long rest until one pm to shake off the tiredness.</p><p>Waiting for his two friends to finish their meal, Lou Cheng logged on his QQ account and started chatting with Yan Zheke. The conversation they had would stay vivid even until the afternoon classes.</p><p>“Lin Que is brilliant,” Lou Cheng started.</p><p>“Very! I knew he would win but I didn’t see it coming so easily!” Yan Zheke sent an emoji of a chick nodding as if picking grains.</p><p>Lou Cheng felt jealous, “When can I fight like him…”</p><p>Yan Zheke sent an emoji of gleaming white teeth, “Do you want to hear the truth or a lie?”</p><p>“What is the truth, and what is the lie?” asked Lou Cheng full of curiosity.</p><p>Yan Zheke sent a cute face. “The lie is you have great potential to get your Professional Ninth Pin certificate and reach Lin Que’s current level by graduation if you train hard under Coach Shi’s supervision every day, in all weathers.”</p><p>“Ha, you speak highly of me,” Lou Cheng sent a shy face. “What about the truth?”</p><p>Yan Zheke sent a laughing emoji, “The truth? The truth is you can’t stick to martial arts training for four years because more and more classes and employment pressure will suck up all your time. Also, a university graduate of Professional Ninth Pin will be a bit too old to enter the martial arts world. Everyone has their future. It doesn’t have to be martial arts.”</p><p>“Everyone has their future. It doesn’t have to be martial arts…” These words replayed in Lou Cheng’s mind over and over again when he was staring blankly at the class slides.</p><p>If he hadn’t taken the risk to get the Jindan, these words would have been his best annotation…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
