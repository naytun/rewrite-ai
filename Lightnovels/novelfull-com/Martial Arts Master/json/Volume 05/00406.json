They were dumbfounded and felt it hard to believe that that she’d won.</p><p>In their minds, even if Yan Zheke was able to defeat Jiang Kongchan, it was bound to be a bitter struggle. It should have been a long and drawn out affair, how could it be that it had been that easy and that simple?</p><p>This sudden but pleasant surprise took them aback and caused them to not properly have time to bask in the joy of the victory.</p><p>The crowd, watching from the grandstands, were the exact same as them; they’d forgotten to shout, clap, and cheer. Everything was silent.</p><p><em>This isn’t how it should be!</em></p><p><em>Didn’t Jiang Kongchan clearly have superior strength?</em></p><p><em>How is it that she could lose just like that?</em></p><p><em>She clearly and definitively lost, without any kind of resistance!</em></p><p><em>Hold on, Songcheng University’s Yan Zheke unexpectedly could also use the Nine Words Sound!</em></p><p><em>She was their secret weapon!</em></p><p>During the live broadcast, Chen Sansheng was speechless for a dozen or so seconds, then blurted out,</p><p>“Army Formula? Yan Zheke has also been trained in the Nine Words Sound?”</p><p>“Right, how it is that seemingly every member of Song Cheng University Martial Arts Club possesses this secret discipline… ” The presenter, Liu Chang, still was in a state of shock.</p><p><em>Similar grades and levels of the Nine Words Sound secret discipline are all highly valued, regardless of their faction, group, or clique. Wouldn’t disciples who lacked the basic foundation and other essentials not be able to receive that kind of instruction?</em></p><p><em>Is Songcheng University Martial Arts Club marching on into a kind of communism?</em></p><p>Chen Sansheng finally breathed in and, still not understanding, said, “As we mentioned before, Capital takes place in the rear gardens of Kongtong. In that case, what can this mean for Songcheng University?”</p><p>“I don’t know either… ” said Liu Chang as he stretched his hands. He was at a loss at how to process the dramatic finish of this competition. Other than astonishment, it was like he couldn’t feel anything at all.</p><p>In the Capital College Martial Arts Club seating section, Chen Diguo also had a similar feeling. He sat there in a daze and gazed at the arena, seeing the empty spot where Jiang Kongchan had once been and Yan Zheke was jumping for joy, excitedly pumping her fist.</p><p>All of the color faded from his vision, and the two figures seemed as if they’d become characters from a black and white silent movie, like a distant fantasy.</p><p>…</p><p>“She won? Just like that, she won?” in Lou Cheng’s fan forum, Eternal Nightfall Yan Xiaoling posted, stupefied.</p><p>“It’s not that I don’t understand, it’s that this world changes too quickly!”</p><p>“That’s not true… ” Brahman said, also perplexed.</p><p><em>Being too surprised all at once could actually lead to no emotion at all.</em></p><p>Just now, Many Cats had popped up, and she replied to Yan Xiaoling with a despising emoji.</p><p>“You think I’m nervous? Back then I almost couldn’t help from laughing!”</p><p>Spoken to like this, Yan Xiaoling momentarily searched for the correct feeling, then replied honestly, speedily typing at the keyboard.</p><p>“Hahaha, I should have thought of it sooner. Hahaha, Lin Que had already been trained in the Attainment Formula, and due to Sister Yan’s relationship with Lou Cheng, how could she not have been trained in it? Hahaha, I’m so stupid and was blinded by my nervousness! Hahaha, this is great. Starting tomorrow, I’ll be getting up early!”</p><p>“Not bad. It looks like making a vow still has some effect. I’m also formally making a vow of chastity for a week. Yesterday my girlfriend went on a business trip for ten days!” Bull Demon King said comically.</p><p>Unparalleled Dragon King said, “Yan Zheke took a big risk just then! She waited for Jiang Kongshan to lean in close and then use the Army Formula. If she had been nervous and been slow by half a beat, then she’d have been kicked by her opponent and there’d have been no time to use the secret discipline… ”</p><p>He was still reflecting on the battle that had just occurred and felt that the way in which Yan Zheke had executed the Army Formula move seemed a bit familiar. Her arms had shaken with great speed and her fists shot out like comets, causing the muscles in Jiang Kongshan’s body to tremble. He felt it was exactly the same as Lin Que’s!</p><p>“Haha, don’t mind all of these details! Quick, Unparalleled Dragon King, throw away your barbeque! Also, also, that streaking guy, get running!” Yan Xiaoling excitedly blabbered.</p><p>“Allow me to finish eating this last piece of kidney, then I can begin fasting.” Unparalleled Dragon King replied, covering his face and sighing.</p><p>Yan Xiaoling didn’t pay any attention and obliviously continued,</p><p>“Hahaha, I think we’re all going to be pretty busy for a while. We’re going to have to moderate all the spam posts and watch out for all the haters. If there’s any negative stuff out there, we’ll have to make up for it with our own posts praising Songcheng University and Lou Cheng so that they don’t jinx them! Very busy, very busy indeed!”</p><p>Just then, under the Weibo article, a comment by Superstitious Belief is Bad popped up like a weed,</p><p>“I must confess that I’m suspecting that Master He may have jinxed them. I apologize… ”</p><p>“I’ll take three sticks of incense and pray to Master He for a week, and then another, and another after that. My dear Lord He, your wish is my command. Anything to reverse some of my bad karma!”</p><p>“Master He, I beg you, please insult me! Quick, say that I’m worthless, that I spend every day playing games and watching competitions, how can I possibly pass my tests?”</p><p>“Hey, all of you cocky S.O.B.s, you can be next!”</p><p>“You’re… shouting… too… slowly… ”</p><p>…</p><p>Compared to He Xiaowei’s humor, An All-knowing Man in Ganghood leaned towards a different style.</p><p>Using a dancing emoji, Eternal Nightfall said, “Hahaha, hahaha, I’ll just laugh. I have nothing to say.”</p><p>“Damn, you’re too much!” Wonton Seller replied, using a cat emoji.</p><p>Brahman001 replied with her mouth wide open, “Lou Cheng’s fan circle has started to migrate.”</p><p>“Songcheng University’s fan circle is following closely behind.”</p><p>“Push, push, don’t line up with the rest of the travelers.”</p><p>Seeing all of this, the veins popped in An All-knowing Man in Ganghood’s forehead. His fingers slid down and he deleted the previous few Weibo posts that he had made. He then shut down his computer, put his phone on silent, logged out of the app, and tried to keep as far away as possible from all electronic devices.</p><p><em>Everybody thinks themself a hero until the wind starts blowing!</em></p><p>…</p><p>Atop the arena, Jiang Kongchan shook hands with the excited Yan Zheke, then she turned and ran back towards the seating area to share her joy with Lou Cheng.</p><p>Although she was telling herself she always needed to be reserved and ladylike, she couldn’t help but have a little pep in her step.</p><p>Suddenly, she heard the silence of the arena start to break. One voice after another started to converge and come together until the sound of it reached her ears.</p><p>“Yan Zheke! Yan Zheke!”</p><p>She subconsciously slowed down and looked all around her, bewildered. This was her first victory against a major opponent in a key match, and the first time that she had received such intense acclaim.</p><p>The crowd had regained their vitality. Naturally, they were quite excited to see an underdog take the victory. Not only that, but Yan Zheke was also an extremely pretty and feminine girl.</p><p>“Yan Zheke! Yan Zheke!”</p><p>The rallying cries came in great waves. Hearing it made her spirits soar, and her entire body from top to bottom brimmed with happiness.</p><p>She raised both of her hands above her head and waved in all directions. She then quickened her step and rushed towards the Song Cheng University Martial Arts Club seating area. She couldn’t wait to share everything with her little Cheng.</p><p>Lou Cheng and the others used their hands to pull each other. It was as if they were enveloped in a surging wave that obscured Yan Zheke’s line of sight. Lou Cheng was extremely excited, and it was evident in his expression. Lin Que was a bit stiff; it was obvious that he was not used to being in such close contact with others, but the corner of his mouth was still raised in a slight grin.</p><p>Forgetting herself for a moment, Yan Zheke stepped across and hugged Lou Cheng tightly. Her mind then cleared and she blushed shyly as she bumped fists one by one with Lin Que, Cai Zongming, and Li Mao.</p><p>“Victory!”</p><p>“Victory!”</p><p>…</p><p>They smiled from ear to ear and it was if they’d forgotten any other words. All they could do was repeat that one word over and over: “Victory!”</p><p><em>Yes, we’ve won, and we can go on to win the Capital!</em></p><p><em>Yes, we’ve won, we’re going to the finals!</em></p><p>Seeing the excited figure of Yan Zheke as well as the revelry of all the members in the Songcheng University crowd, Jiang Kongchan was frustrated and disappointed at her loss. Her mind was empty and barren, as if her soul had been lost. There was nothing inside, and all she could feel was a dull pain that seemed to flow within her.</p><p>Yan Zheke hadn’t merely grasped the Army Formula, she’d also trained in the Meteor Force of the Fighting Sect!</p><p>Both of these were two sides of the same coin. Her own Force Concentration should have been sufficient to guard against any accidents. Who knows, it seemed things always tend towards the worst.</p><p>Jiang Kongchan breathed in and puffed out her cheeks in order to control her desire to break out in tears.</p><p>By then she had gotten rid of most of her heartache and returned to the Capital College Martial Arts Club seating area. Ren Li had already come to welcome her, reaching out with both hands to hug her.</p><p>Smelling the dull scent of orchids and feeling her sister’s embrace, Jiang Kongchan was unable to control herself. She buried her face in Ren Li’s shoulder and tears flowed from her swollen eyes.</p><p>“I’m sorry, Sister, I’m sorry… ” she sobbed, choking with tears.</p><p>“It’s fine, it’s fine.” Ren Li stared ahead, patting her back.</p><p>“I… I… Brother Chen’s last year… ” Jiang Kongchan was unable to continue through her cries.</p><p>Beside her, Chen Diguo heard this and, not wanting to dwell on any unpleasant things, wished to console her with a few words to show that he was able to accept it. However, no words came out and he sadly was unable to say anything.</p><p>He turned his head to look at Ren Li and saw that her large, cartoon-like eyes were glistening with a layer of moisture. The pain and loss was obvious.</p><p>Even acting as the favored fighter of the age, it was hard to make up for this loss… these words rang true in Chen Diguo’s heart. He signed inwardly to himself and walked towards the Capital College Martial Arts Club supporters and looked at them. He raised both of his hands high and moved them horizontally before lightly clasping them together, bidding his final farewell.</p><p>Not knowing who should start, these supporters were the same as they’d always been, and they shouted out his name,</p><p>“Chen Diguo! Chen Diguo!”</p><p>With this familiar scene and familiar cheer, Chen Diguo forgot the old adage that men should shed blood, not tears. The edges of his eyes glistened and his nose became stuffy, but he persisted in accomplishing his farewell.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I couldn’t make everyone a champion… ”</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m again unable to win this championship… ”</p><p>Seeing the regret in his far away figure, and seeing how his heart was aching, the crowd chanted loudly all around him,</p><p>“Chen Diguo, Chen Diguo… ”</p><p>Beside him, Qiu Hailin and Du Yiyi also were struck by sadness and began to cry.</p><p>Happiness and revelry, perhaps it all can be mixed together amidst the noise and clamor, but heartache is forever etched in one’s memory.</p><p><em>Goodbye, Capital.</em></p><p><em>Goodbye, Chen Diguo.</em></p><p>…</p><p>In the dusky light of the locker room, the tightly closed doors were suddenly opened, and a youthful-looking student, before entering, shouted in a loud voice,</p><p>“Songcheng University has won!”</p><p>“Songcheng University is going to the finals!”</p><p>Following his words, dazzling bursts of light from outside filled the entire room with light. One clean and collected youth was awakened from his almost meditative state.</p><p>“Songcheng University?” he said in a low voice.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
