The first part was visiting the famous Golden Buddha Temple in Fuluo. The second part was listening to the scriptures lesson given by the living arhat, Zhao Wu. The third part would be having a sparring and teaching exercise with the monks and boxing masters that were not too old. Other than areas that restricted filming, the media followed them for the entire trip. It looked rather proper.</p><p>At noon, with the scorching sun high up in the sky, Lou Cheng and the rest entered the temple while enduring the steam cooker-like environment. They were able to appreciate the differences in style between temples in their own countries and temples in a foreign land from close distance.</p><p>The infrastructure here had sharp edges, was enveloped in gold and looked majestic. As they step in, the unique characteristics of ancient Buddhism were striking to them. As Theravada saw Mahayana Buddhism as extremists, they did not recognise the different realms of Buddhism nor the various Buddha mentioned in their scriptures. Therefore they only enshrined and worshipped the “World Honored Buddha”, Gautama Buddha and his followers such as Mahākāśyapa and others.</p><p>Outside the hall, there was a giant urn and the “Four Faces God”, Brahmā guiding the door. It had a golden body that was still shimmering and eight extended arms holding to different items in each hand, looking extremely solemn.</p><p>As this was an official activity, Lou Cheng, Peng Leyun and the rest were all wearing their white base, red stripes martial arts suits that represented their group. This formed a strong contrast against the traditional clothing worn by Kaori Karasawa, Youko Yamashita and the other members of Japan’s representative group.</p><p>As for Veigar, he was still wearing a large brimmed hat and general suit. He was walking with awe but was still domineering. It was as though he had forgotten about the scar of losing to Kaori Karasawa and the fact that he wasn’t able to force her to use “Quadruple Aerial Ace”.</p><p>Banam was in a classical attire of a Nanzheng boxing master. Both of his arms and legs were wrapped in white bandages and was walking at the back of the group where no one paid attention. The skinny and fat Wahku and Gusai were in monks’ robes, blending in well with their surroundings.</p><p>During the visit, they were moving around in groups of three to five based on their representative groups. There were clear boundaries between each group. Lou Cheng took out his cellphone and fulfilled his responsibility as a tourist. As long as the place allowed photography, he would just take a picture regardless if the workmanship was great or bad. He was intending to share them with his wife at night. As for Ann Chaoyang and Ren Li, their only use was to provide more pictures for him to “steal”!</p><p>Peng Leyun? His phone camera was ruined, and he would drift off from time to time. All he could do was continue being his relaxed and casual self.</p><p>Half past three, their visit had ended. They entered a structure that looked like a lecture room. At the front, there was a skinny, yellow-skinned old monk sitting with his eyes half-opened. There was nothing extravagant around him and one couldn’t spot any vitality on him. This was the initial result of one who had mastered the way to becoming an Arhat and was equivalent to one who had just entered the realm of physical invulnerability. The name of this monk was Master Zhao Wu.</p><p>Zhao Wu didn’t bat an eyelid and was composed throughout. Seeing that everyone had gathered, he started giving a lecture using the Pali language that Buddha had used to write the scriptures in the past. Four middle-aged monks who were standing on his left and right were translating the content using English, Mandarin, Japanese and Shengxiang’s language at the same time. Their voices stacked on and resonated in the Zen hall. This gave an unexplainable deep, solemn and loud feeling.</p><p>Lou Cheng was rather interested and listening attentively. Initially, he was just taking it as broadening his knowledge. However as he listened on, a strong sense of doubt arose in him.</p><p>Master Zhaowu wasn’t talking about some stories in the Buddhism Scriptures but the true meaning behind “Sixteen Insight Knowledges”. He was covering from understanding to how he mastered it step by step and using analogies to break it down. This made Lou Cheng felt that he could actually master part of it.</p><p>“It couldn’t be that “Sixteen Insight Knowledges” is so worthless and he can just say it out for us to listen?” Lou Cheng leaned towards Peng Leyun and asked in a low voice.</p><p>This was equivalent to the core force of “Ice Sect” and “Fire Sect”!</p><p>Peng Leyun tilted his head, took a glance at him and his mouth started moving. The voice was barely audible but went straight into Lou Cheng’s ears:</p><p>“He is only talking about the basics and will not talk about the deeper content. If you are really interested and decide to walk down this path, I believe he would be more than happy to welcome you and pass down the teachings to you himself.”</p><p>Lou Cheng suddenly understood. He continued, “It’s not bad just hearing about it. “Sixteen Insight Knowledge” isn’t recorded in any scriptures books. They are the practical training methods and confirmation methods that Gautama Buddha and various high monks had concluded after reaching the Arhat realm. It’s indeed interesting.”</p><p>Lou Cheng scrutinized Peng Leyun and laughed, “It’s normal for me to listen but you are a disciple of Taoism and half a priest. What are you listening for?”</p><p>I have decided to give Peng Leyun the nickname of “Priest. A priest that always drifts beyond the skies!</p><p>Peng Leyun replied with a laugh, “Since the Song Dynasty, there have been many exchanges of the Scriptures of Buddhism so as to perfect the philosophical system of various parties. Part of it had fused with the training principles of the other party. I might be able to understand something by listening about Hinayana a little more…”</p><p>As he spoke, he seemed to have thought of something. His gaze started to drift and his thoughts were no longer concentrating.</p><p>Lou Cheng felt something and immediately raised his hand. At this moment, he happened to see Master Zhao Wu looking and nodding his head slightly at him. He wasn’t angry nor happy but that half-opened eyes of his had suddenly opened.</p><p>As they opened, a radiant illusion seemed to have covered his eyes. All he could see was that Master Zhao Wu, who was sitting at the other end started turning gold, and grew three heads and six arms. His entire body was emanating dazzling light, looking sacred and solemn.</p><p>It couldn’t be? Could there really be the Golden Body of Arhat? Lou Cheng was greatly shocked and subconsciously formed the “Ice Mirror” to reflect his surroundings. He suspected that his senses and mind had been affected by the mystical influence of Master Zhao Wu, resulting in his illusion!</p><p>Within the “Ice Mirror” a golden statue of an Arhat with three heads and six arms was emanating brilliant light!</p><p>Really… Lou Cheng still couldn’t believe it. He did a “Force Concentration” and allowed the Ice and Fire to rotate to achieve equilibrium, forming a “Starry Sky” where darkness, light, cold and hot coexisted. This was to maximise the minute premonition that he could have felt with his body.</p><p>The surrounding suddenly became empty. He looked once again at Zhao Wu and discovered his muscles had bulged out forming wave-like patterns. His skin was glowing in dull golden light. Where was his 3 head, where was his six arms, where was the brilliant light emanating from his entire body!</p><p>No, in the void around him, his aura was condensing as though it had become the real body. Faintly, it had formed two blurry heads and four additional arms holding different items…</p><p>Up until now, Lou Cheng roughly understood what happened. The Golden Body of Arhat that he had seen previously was partially real and partially fake. It was formed by the aura of Master Zhao Wu’s through his strong mental strength and the mutation of his body.</p><p>So this is an enlightened person similar to one in physical invulnerability stage…</p><p>Recalling the snow-covered environment that his master summoned, they were really the gods of these lands…</p><p>As his thoughts flowed, Lou Cheng became composed and was admiring the mysterious feeling Zhao Wu displayed casually.</p><p>His gaze swept to Peng Leyun and found that his eyes were out of focus and his expression was in a daze. No one knew where he had “drifted” to and he probably didn’t pay attention to the Golden Body of Arhat.</p><p>Master Zhao Wu’s flirtatious look had landed on a blind man… Lou Cheng thought. Shifting his gaze, he saw Ren Li looking at the front in focus. The light in her eyes was dull and there seemed to be a storm gathering. As for Ann Chaoyang, he was mumbling to himself. He seemed to be reciting a poem.</p><p>Reciting a poem? Lou Cheng was shocked and turned his ear. All he heard was Ann Chaoyang reciting softly,</p><p>“That year, I shaved my head and embrace the world, not because of Buddha, but to get closer to your warmth…”</p><p>… Lou Cheng’s mouth twitched and couldn’t help but mocked:</p><p>Hehe, this group of useless people!</p><p>They had wasted these scripture lessons!</p><p>Hmph, other than Ren Li…</p><p>I have to tell this to Ke. She will definitely laugh over it!</p><p>Ten minutes past four, the scripture lesson was over and the group of people left the Zen Hall. Lou Cheng casually glanced at Kaori Karasawa, Veigar and the rest as he wished to find out if there were any signs of them after witnessing the “Golden Body of Arhat”. However these people all had strong wills and their expressions had recovered, making him unable to tell. However the other boxing masters and martial arts artists seemed to be a little distracted and had clearly suffered an extremely large shock to the point that they were starting to have doubts about their lives.</p><p>Following was the guidance exercise segment. Based on the arrangements of the organizing committee, they were divided into two groups. Several female contestants went to guide female boxing masters that were not too old. As for the rest, they headed to the canteen to try out the food of the monks while waiting for the rotations.</p><p>As he was worried that Ren Li would be lost, Guide Zhong Ningtao instructed Lou Cheng for a while before following her in a hurry. Youko Yamashita looked on quietly and nodded his head slightly.</p><p>In the canteen.</p><p>The food was served to them. The drinks were just plain water and the rice was coarse. It was as simple as it could get. Lou Cheng, Peng Leyun and Ann Chaoyang only consumed a few mouthfuls before stopping.</p><p>If they were not hungry, why would they torture themselves?</p><p>Speaking of which, I’m starting to miss the various delicacies at home… Lou Cheng swallowed his saliva.</p><p>Soon after, the monks started to gather the utensils. Youko Yamashita was glancing over using the side of his eyes from a place not far away. Seeing that the three of them didn’t react strangely and allowed the monks to collect their utensils, a smile appeared on his face.</p><p>This monk had been bribed. The utensils they used would be sent to Masane Otake for extractions!</p><p>Although Lou Cheng and the rest always had meals outside previously, they did not make any reservations and therefore he couldn’t bribe the staffs in advance. Moreover their guide would always ensure they did not leave anything behind in the end.</p><p>This time, their guide had been diverted away!</p><p>At this moment, Lou Cheng suddenly remembered something. He immediately halted the monk who was leaving with their utensils, smiled at Peng Leyun and Ann Chaoyang and laughed, “You guys are too careless! Where are we? This is Nanyang where evils arts and curses are common. We can’t leave behind anything that is close to ourselves to prevent people from casting spells on them!”</p><p>Yeah, this is based on what the Coach had instructed him!</p><p>Seeing that Peng Leyun and Ann Chaoyang were dumbfounded, Lou Cheng wiped the bowls and utensils he used previously. A dull flame shimmer. The flame did not burn the material but evaporated their saliva.</p><p>“This move isn’t bad.” Peng Leyun complimented.</p><p>To be able to use fire to deal with the trails but not burning the utensils, this level of control was commendable!</p><p>Lou Cheng should be completing his morph soon right?</p><p>As they spoke, he also stood up. Silverish-white sparks were coming out from his hands. He wiped his own utensils and did not leave behind any additional things.</p><p>Seeing them, Ann Chaoyang was also anxious to try it out. He had not unlocked a supernatural ability and could only attempt to destroy using special wavelength. In the end, he shamelessly took out wet wipes.</p><p>Youko Yamashita was watching from afar quietly and silently.</p><p>……</p><p>When the few female experts were giving guidance, suddenly a gust of wind blew past and blew away the boredom. Ren Li’s hair was also blown up.</p><p>After she reached six pins, the roots of her hair became very strong. Without external force, it would be difficult for her to lose a hair. When giving guidance, there’s usually no requirement for her to tie up her hair.</p><p>At this moment, Kaori Karasawa, who was near her, moved her fingers quietly. A gust of wind mixed into the natural environment and was in perfect tune with the actions of the girl sparring with Ren Li. The wind “twisted” two strands of hair off Ren Li and pulled them off quietly without a trace. It looked just like an accident caused by the move of the female kid.</p><p>No one could possibly master the Absolute Reaction to their hair!</p><p>Two strands of black hair carrying the roots felled. Although Ren Li felt something, she didn’t find it strange and continue to feed moves to the female kid.</p><p>Kaori Karasawa ‘s expression was getting more and more carefree and the smile on her face was still as beautiful and sweet. After the guidance match was over, she pretended to have dropped something and rolled it to the side where she bent down to pick it up.</p><p>…</p><p>When Ren Li was back in the canteen, Lou Cheng told her about the evil arts and curses of Nanyang to remind her to pay more attention.</p><p>Ren Li answered confidently,</p><p>“That’s nothing. I also know about curses.”</p><p>“You know about curses too?” Lou Cheng was surprised.</p><p>“Yeah, there’s a segment about black magic and curses in the “Plague Sect”. However the preparations needed beforehand take a long time and aren’t useful in battle. Moreover, it’s useless if the materials gathered are useless and it would fail most of the time. Nonetheless, it will be a hundred percent accurate if I used it on myself,” said Ren Li. “I happened to have lost some strands of hair and can cast a reverse curse on it…”</p><p>At this point, she looked at Zhong Ningtao, anxious to try it out.</p><p>“Guide, I will like to apply to go out and buy some materials.”</p><p>Oh damn, I have not expected Ren Li to be capable of this… I can’t afford to offend her, cannot afford… Lou Cheng wiped away his cold sweat.</p><p>She can even use curses!</p><p>Eh, not right. I’m able to reflect curses…</p><p>Thinking about this, he no longer spoke any further and headed towards the open space with Peng Leyun and Ann Chaoyang to give guidance to twelve to thirteen years old boxing masters or monks.</p><p>Seeing the immature yet engrossed looks, and their well practised and ruthless actions, Lou Cheng couldn’t help but feel a little emotional.</p><p>In China, one would just have gotten into contact with martial arts at this age and the focus would be on forming the foundation and training the body. There were still several years before they would have fighting strength. It wasn’t that it would take long, but the society had a common understanding that getting too involved in martial arts at too early a stage would affect a person’s growth and resulting in various negative consequences. The kid’s mental health might even be affected by it.</p><p>In this process, they would be taught other things too. This was to prevent them from being illiterate. If their paths of martial arts didn’t work out in the future, at least they would not be useless.</p><p>However this wasn’t the case in Shengxiang. Most of the people here were still very poor and led a very tough life. Although they might not have reached the stage where they did not have food for the next meal, they weren’t much better. From a young age, they had to work in various kinds of jobs to keep themselves alive. Those who were selected to practice martial arts were the lucky ones. The earlier they mastered it and began to possess fighting strength, the earlier they could serve the people nurturing them. This was something that both parties desired.</p><p>As there were only a small number of high level experts, the referees in a lot of competitions were not up to standards. During battles, lost control was common and there was a lingering taste of blood and cruelty. Nonetheless, such boxing matches were abnormally popular. A lot of people liked to watch this kind of battle and were willing to pay money to watch.</p><p>Based on the reports he had read, the boxing masters of Shengxiang were in a group with a high fatality rate. Moreover for those who had not reached the stage similar to the inhuman stage, where one’s core would mutate, they would likely be very prone to disease and pain after they passed their prime years, leading to an extremely sad life. Some of them might not even live past fifty years old.</p><p>Obviously this was already considered as blessed when compared against many other professions. Not only was their income great, but they could also rely on their strength to bully the weak to earn some additional resources. As for transsexuals, their lives were brilliant for a moment but painful for many others. They could also die suddenly.</p><p>The reasons why there were such differences between the two countries were because other than the path of martial arts, China had developed quite well in other aspects. For the kids in China, practising martial arts were more of a dream and for their future. To the kids of the same age in Shengxiang, martial arts were for survival.</p><p>Lou Cheng was giving guidance attentively. He wasn’t discriminating against them, but he only felt pity.</p><p>The talent of the kid opposite of him was average and would likely not make it past the first streaming. He would have to take the road of studying…</p><p>At five thirty in the afternoon, the activity ended. Lou Cheng and the rest didn’t encounter any incidents and successfully found a place to have dinner before returning to the hotel.</p><p>…</p><p>That night, at the place where Japan’s representatives were staying, the researcher, Masane Otake, was trying to keep his excitement in control as he started preliminary handling of Ren Li’s hair. He was intending to separate the hair roots.</p><p>He was operating at full concentration when a dull light lit up in front of his eyes. All he could see was the two strands of hair burning rapidly and becoming ashes in an instant. At the same time, it was giving out a faint fruit smell.</p><p>“What has happened?” Masane Otake was dumbfounded.</p><p>After several minutes, the phone in the hotel room of the leader of Japan’s representative group rang. He picked up the phone and realized it was Masane Otake. He was shouting with difficulty,</p><p>“Help, help me…”</p><p>Help you? The leader immediately rushed out and called for help. After opening the room door of Masane Otake, he saw lying on the floor, bent like a prawn and was vomiting incessantly, looking like he was in pain.</p><p>“There’s, there’s poison!” said Masane Otake while struggling after seeing the “rescue personnel”.</p><p>…</p><p>“It seems to have failed…” Ren Li mumbled to herself while staring at the countless decorations in front of her.</p><p>“There isn’t anyone around right?”</p><p>“Forget it, it will not really harm the person after all. At the worse case, he would just feel terrible for a while.”</p><p>“Yeah, it is considered done now!”</p><p>Ren Li clapped her hand and walked into the washroom happily, intending to have a bath.</p><p>…</p><p>The second day, the twenty-seventh of August. Lou Cheng, who had almost fully recovered, felt that he would complete his morph in just two to three days as he truly entered the inhuman stage.</p><p>During the sparring session in the morning, he was resting to recover. He watched the videos while waiting for the next match and was looking forward to experiencing the “Six Paths of Reincarnation Punch”.</p><p>As to who would become the eventual champion, he naturally would stand on the side of his teammate!</p><p>At seven thirty at night, they had their dinner and arrived at the Shengxiang Stadium. They entered the changing room and were making final adjustments before the match.</p><p>Outside the door, there was a huge crowd of people as the heat wave swept towards the sky. It didn’t seem like they were here to watch a finals but more like watching a grand celebration. In the room, Peng Leyun was holding his phone horizontally. On the phone was the battle video between Lou Cheng and Kaori Karasawa. However, his eyes weren’t focused on the screen but had “drifted” to an unknown place. Suddenly, it seemed like he had connected something.</p><p>Ren Li who had nothing to do was lowering her head and playing on her phone. As she was swiping with her fingers, her eyebrows were raised from time to time. She seemed to be wanting to quarrel with someone. However, she still managed to control herself in the end. Ann Chaoyang was wearing his headphones and listening to his music quietly, as though he was in a world of his own.</p><p>As for Lou Cheng, it was obvious that he was chatting with his little fairy girl.</p><p>“If you are to lose despite being the favorite, I will laugh at you for a lifetime, [cover mouth while smiling expression]” said Yan Zheke.</p><p>For a lifetime… The edge of Lou Cheng’s mouth arced upwards. He typed quickly, “I’m really afraid… I have to think about how long I should play around in this match!”</p><p>Just like this, time passed second by second. Lou Cheng kept his phone and intended to close his eyes to rest for fifteen minutes.</p><p>At this moment, the side of his eyes saw the “return” of Peng Leyun. Vitality came back into his eyes. Remembering something, he asked in a low voice, “How do you think curses work? It felt rather creepy and scary. Is it based on the principles of quantum entanglement?”</p><p>He was guessing with physics knowledge that he barely understood half of it.</p><p>Peng Leyun tilted his head and look at him. He laughed heartily,</p><p>“This has dabbled into my knowledge blind zone. I’m just an undergraduate…”</p><p>“Eh, you know about this joke?” Lou Cheng replied with a surprised tone.</p><p>“I’m not a primitive person.” Peng Leyun waved the phone in his hands with a smile.</p><p>Lou Cheng and his mentality were rather relaxed.</p><p>…</p><p>In Japan’s representative group, the guide heaved a sigh and threw all the distracting thoughts to the back of his mind. He looked with focused eyes at Kaori Karasawa and said,</p><p>“How do you feel?”</p><p>The following match is a battle for glory for Japan!</p><p>Kaori Karasawa moved her hands and legs before replying with a gentle smile, “Not bad, the injuries shouldn’t have any effects on me now.”</p><p>“Great.” The guide nodded his head in satisfaction.</p><p>…</p><p>In the other changing room.</p><p>Gusai who was making his preparation saw the guide walk over and said in a low voice,</p><p>“Lou Cheng defeated Youko Yamashita and Banam. He even forced Kaori Karasawa to use “Quadruple Aerial Ace” and is widely considered as a top four expert in this competition. As long as you can win against him, you could prove yourself and the Shengxiang country. You would receive the compliments of everyone and all the glory!”</p><p>Gusai was also an established monk. He wasn’t agitated by what he heard and replied in a composed tone,</p><p>“He’s a real expert. There’s still some distance between him and I. I’m unlikely to win.”</p><p>In addition, he still suffered injuries during the match against Peng Leyun!</p><p>“Rest assured, we have contacted Wu Cheng from Miluo. He will be the referee for the match between Lou Cheng and you.” The guide said in satisfaction.</p><p>“This would be discovered by Lou Cheng and doubted by everyone.” Gusai shook his head slowly.</p><p>“No, they won’t. This was because he will not affect Lou Cheng or disturb your battle. It is just that his supernatural ability can allow you to have better performance without others finding out at the most crucial moment! Try your best in battle. Go and show everyone who is the real artist!” The guide said in an elevated tone as he waved his hand.</p><p>Entering the finals will be too obvious. Number three is just right!</p><p>Gusai pondered for a moment before replying,</p><p>“I only know about being myself. As for other things, I didn’t hear them.”</p><p>“Great.” The guide left with satisfaction.</p><p>Wahku who came along and was sitting at a side was just watching quietly, not saying a word.</p><p>Perhaps this will be one of the obstacles in Junior Gusai’s practice. He would only truly understand after experiencing it himself.</p><p>When he won against Lou Cheng but felt remorseful and plagued by remorse, he would then understand the pretence of his and started to hate everything in the world, giving rise to the thought of giving up everything in the world…</p><p>Gusai was sitting there, not moving for a long time until he heard the announcement from outside. It was then that he wriggled his terrifying fats and stood up like a mountain.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
