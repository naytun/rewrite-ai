Every kind of vehicle was parked there, shops were sporadically open, there were plenty of tranquil alleyways, and in the darkness there were also old city walls and official residences.</p><p>Lou Cheng sat on the back seat, his eyes floating towards Yan Zheke’s rolling hair lingering on the end of her nose and her beautiful fragrance. In his hands he could feel her soft, flexible, and slim waist. The cold wind swept by his ears along with her crisp and clear voice. He would gladly be carried by her through the clamor and frenzy of the city, through the light and through the dark, through ancient history and the present day. Heaven and earth and everything in between seemed like it had faded into the background. All that remained was this bicycle and the two people on it, leaning against one another. No matter where they rode to, they had no fear.</p><p>Basking in this beautiful feeling, the two of them would stop to take photos from time to time and lazily chat about their lucky victory before at the semi-finals, how painful it must feel to be eliminated at the Capital, and how difficult it would be to fight against Shanbei and their expectations of that fight. Talking and talking, topics came and went like rumors in the night. Two lines of trees at the side of the road swayed in the wind as they spoke about their dreams, their shared future, and how they would keep in contact while they were abroad in a year’s time. They were confident that together they could overcome the trial of distance and time, that their hands would never part, and they would remain together until they were old and grey.</p><p>With the optimism of youth, they quickly took the topic of their early separation and put it in the back of their minds, instead planning on where they would go travelling during the May holidays. It was almost a pity that they’d entered the finals, as they would have to miss the ranking event.</p><p>In Lou Cheng’s opinion, he didn’t care if they did or didn’t join. He believed he could still improve himself. In about a year’s times perhaps he could enter the Inhuman state and go straight to a Fifth Pin. At the moment, he didn’t need a Sixth Pin qualification to prove his abilities or level, so he could use this as a stepping stone to enter professional competitions or be a security guard for rich and powerful individuals.</p><p>This was opposed to Yan Zheke, who was congenitally deficient and had no path to the Dan Stage. Her aspiration was to receive a Professional Ninth Pin certification. Next October she would have some opportunities. When the time came, one possible opportunity would be to become one of the top two names in the division and enter the group phase of the ranks at Songcheng University. There would be no need to join the first few rounds of the knockout and there would be no conflict in the ranking event. The second would be that the substitutes would have grown up and they would have to find time to join the ranking event so they wouldn’t be any influence there.</p><p>Yan Zheke rode the bike under the bright lights and through the gentle wind, escorting Lou Cheng and returning to the entrance of the hotel. Her face was full of cheer and she appeared quite happy.</p><p>Ebbing and flowing, leaving and returning, and along the entire way there was her lover who would be with her for the rest of her life. All of this beauty had caused her to feel a kind of intoxication.</p><p>“What room is Talker in? We need to give the keys back to him.” Yan Zheke locked up the bike.</p><p>At this moment, Lou Cheng saw that her shoelaces were undone, so he bent down and helped her tie them as he laughed. “Do you want to go and knock on his door?”</p><p>“Not me, you.” Yan Zheke lowered her head, her lips twisting into a smile, seeming like a little girl as she watched her boyfriend tie the loop.</p><p>“I can’t either! God knows what those two are doing right now. If I go knock, won’t I be ruining their good time?” Lou Cheng responded with a snicker.</p><p>“You’ve got such a dirty mind! You think everyone’s the same as you and loves to get fresh?” Yan Zheke shot back.</p><p>“This is dirty? When a boyfriend and girlfriend are together that long, this is a normal thing. Also, what if he and Fang Yuan also went out on a date?” Lou Cheng fastened the shoelaces, then stood up and added, “I’ll give Talker a call first to see if he’s actually in his room and if he’s doing anything. Afterwards, I can take the keys and give them back as insurance!”</p><p>“Don’t… ” Yan Zheke suddenly stopped, and the corners of her mouth shrank.</p><p>“Why?” Lou Cheng responded as he took out his phone, bewildered.</p><p>Yan Zheke looked at him as if he were stupid and said, “You just said you didn’t want to ruin their good time, have you already forgotten?”</p><p>“It’s just a phone call, I… ” Suddenly, it was all clear to Lou Cheng, and he tittered, “So you understand?”</p><p>Yan Zheke turned her head and looked to the side, saying, “I’ve read enough romantic novels and seen enough soap operas. The leading actor is always about to seal the deal and on the verge of the critical moment when inevitably his phone will go off and he’ll be really depressed… ”</p><p>As she spoke, her voice lowered two octaves, as if this was an attractive image in her mind.</p><p>Since she didn’t have enough time, she would very rarely read romance novels or watch soap operas. Usually she’d have to depend on Li Liantong to tell her all about the latest developments and crazes.</p><p>“Right, totally depressed.” Lou Cheng repeated, “Then I’ll send Talker a text.”</p><p><em>Actually, according to what I know about Classmate Little Ming, he’s someone with rich experience and history when it comes to the sexual realm. If it’s close to the critical moment, he’ll definitely shut off his phone and pull out the room’s phone cord. If that’s the case, I’ll have to go up and knock like I proposed before.</em></p><p><em>Otherwise, how could he be called “Casanova:?</em></p><p>“Mmm.” Yan Zheke nodded her head up and down.</p><p>Lou Cheng quickly pressed down on the keyboard and sent Cai Zongming a message with an evil laugh,</p><p>“Anybody there? If there’s no one there, then I’ll come knock on your door!”</p><p>A period of time passed, and no one responded. Lou Cheng put away his phone, smiling, and looked at Yan Zheke with his hands outstretched.</p><p>“Was I right or what?”</p><p>“Hmmph!” Yan Zheke stared straight at him but said, “Then I’ll give you the keys. Whenever he responds to your message, you can give them back to him. If he’s fallen asleep, then you can give them back tomorrow morning.”</p><p>While talking, she handed over the keys to Lou Cheng, and afterwards looked down at her body, pinching her calves and stomach and smiling. “I’ve carried you this long, it’s time for you to give me a massage so I can relax!”</p><p>Before, when they werecycling on their nighttime date in the Capital, there were several times when she had refused when Lou Cheng asked to switch places. They’d attracted the attention of many curious onlookers on the side of the road as she escorted her boyfriend for the entire trip.</p><p>“Okay!” Lou Cheng was also very much looking forward to this.</p><p>Hearing his response, Yan Zheke didn’t know what to think. Her face suddenly went pink and she reluctantly said, “You should pass by me. Tonight you can’t get handsy or take advantage!”</p><p>“If I can’t get handsy, then how can I give you a massage?” Lou Cheng laughed lightly.</p><p>“You know what I mean!” Yan Zheke started at him, half angry and half amused.</p><p>Under the reflection of the lights, the look on her face shook him to the core.</p><p>“Alright, alright, alright, I won’t get fresh,” Lou Cheng said as he pulled little Ke into the elevator.</p><p><em>Hehe, if I can’t move my hands, I can move other things. I’ll say it again, how is it that you can call this taking advantage when it’s between boyfriend and girlfriend?</em></p><p>“Cheng, why is it that there’s something weird about your smile… ” Yan Zheke eyed her boyfriend suspiciously.</p><p>“What’s weird about it? Just look at how normal my face is!” Lou Cheng pointed to his forehead.</p><p>Talking and laughing vivaciously, they arrived at their floor and stopped at Yan Zheke’s door. Not knowing what to do, the two of them went quiet at the same time. The atmosphere subtly changed, and in the dusky lighting, there was an inward change in the both of them.</p><p>“I… I’ll open the door.” Yan Zheke didn’t understand why she had blurted out such nonsense.</p><p>Lou Cheng was about to say something when his phone violently vibrated in his pants pocket, shattering the previous atmosphere. Yan Zheke didn’t know what to think, then covered her mouth and laughed, shaking like a leaf.</p><p>Helplessly taking out his phone to have a look and discovering that it was Mom and Qi Fang’s number, Lou Cheng even more hopelessly decided to answer.</p><p>Yan Zheke didn’t swipe her card and with her back towards the room door, groaned with laughter as she looked at her boyfriend.</p><p>“Hello, Cheng, are you okay? I heard that you got hit by some kungfu from the Plague Sect, a really terrible kind,” Qi Fang immediately asked.</p><p>She and Lou Zhisheng were always following the international competitions. After the previous match had finished, she’d called out of concern for her son, but it was when Lou Cheng was outside for his midnight snack celebration. The surroundings were too noisy, so they’d rescheduled to around 10 o’clock.</p><p>“I’m fine, it only affected me for a short time. My body is doing great. Just listen to my voice, Mom, doesn’t it sound fine?” Lou Cheng consoled her.</p><p>“That’s good, that’s good.” Qi Fang laughed. “Then I have to commend you, I’m a bit embarrassed. You know your father, he’s gone and opened another bottle of alcohol… ”</p><p>Talking up until now, she suddenly felt something wasn’t right, “… Is it that your dad is looking for an excuse to drink?”</p><p>“Very smart, Mom!” Lou Cheng sold out his father, Lou Zhisheng, without the least bit of shame.</p><p>Qi Fang rambled on for a bit, then carelessly mentioned, “That girl in your Martial Arts Club… Yan Zheke. Right, Yan Zheke. Isn’t she also from Xiushan No.1 Middle School? I seem to remember running into her at your school once or twice before.”</p><p><em>“Uh…Mom unexpectedly was the first to mention Keke…”</em> Lou Cheng winked at Yan Zheke and replied to Qi Fang with a laugh, “Yeah, she was in the classroom next to ours. Both of us were admitted to Songcheng University.”</p><p><em>It was truly meant to be! Mom, your daughter-in-law has arrived!</em></p><p>“I knew it! Your father didn’t believe me. When you were in the Youth Tournament before, I also saw her.” Qi Fang spoke as if she’d discovered a truth.</p><p>After talking for a little while longer about Yan Zheke, she finally hung up and Lou Cheng looked towards his girlfriend with a smile. “It seems that my mom is keeping an eye on you. What do you think, is she suspicious of our relationship?”</p><p>During the competition, when Keke had used the Army Formula that even Lin Que didn’t fully grasp… While they were celebrating, the arena was a bit chaotic and they’d only given each other an ordinary hug, but the feelings between him and Keke were still rather special…</p><p>“Hmph, are you scared that your mom will find out?” Yan Zheke wrinkled her nose.</p><p>“It’s not that I’m scared. I’d take you to see my parents any time,” Lou Cheng said as he laughed.</p><p>Yan Zheke raised her eyebrows when she heard this and her eyes softened. She turned around, swiped her card, and entered her room.</p><p>“You need to give me a good massage… ”</p><p>She hadn’t finished speaking when she abruptly paused, turning back to look at Lou Cheng as she said,</p><p>“Cheng, if your mom is suspicious, then will my dad… ”</p><p><em>Yes, up until now, Dad still hasn’t called to congratulate me. It wasn’t like this with previous competitions!</em></p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
