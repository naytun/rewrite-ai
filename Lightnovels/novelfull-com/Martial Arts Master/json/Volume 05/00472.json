This was to describe the development to “Unparallel Dragon King”, “Eternal Nightfall” and the rest who couldn’t witness this competition.</p><p>“Sob sob sob. Little Tiger, you are really a good man! [waving a handkerchief]” said “Wanton Seller”.</p><p>“Even the Heavens and Earth are touched! [Igniting Fireworks]” commented “Brahman”.</p><p>Seeing their excited compliments, the smile disappeared on Ann Chaoyang face as he couldn’t help but criticise,</p><p>“I’m the one who did the good deeds without leaving my name behind!”</p><p>If Lou Cheng had not told me that I’m the most reliable among them, I will not have done this so diligently!</p><p>Ka-cha!</p><p>He took a picture of the ring, appended the comment and uploaded it:</p><p>“Lou Cheng seems relaxed while waiting!”</p><p>Ka Cha! Ka Cha!</p><p>Ann Chaoyang seemed to have found something interesting and was uploading pictures after pictures:</p><p>“Baco looked like he has a deep grudge against his opponents.”</p><p>“The relaxed looks of Lou Cheng make it feels like he is attending a festival and not waiting for a battle to start.”</p><p>As he commented, he suddenly paused. He was slow in pressing the ‘capture button’ and type the following words:</p><p>“Eh, Lou Cheng’s is so fluent with these two moves. His “Flame Force” was also stronger than expected!”</p><p>In the picture, the fire waves were raging and extending outwards. It looked just like a real explosion!</p><p>At this very moment, not only did Baco lose the advantage of using Curses, both of his hands were also trembling and were clearly burnt. This was because he withstood the strong explosion from the Flame Force and had received a certain degree of damage. It was also clear that he was in pain and feeling sore.</p><p>In his contracted pupils, he could already see Lou Cheng raising both of his arms, formed seals and was ready to shout.</p><p>This is bad!</p><p>Baco thought to himself. In a split second, he made his decision. He lowered his body suddenly and avoided the edge of the frontal attack instantly.</p><p>Following which, he pushed both of his hands on the floor, straightened his back and swept his right leg towards the ankle of the approaching Lou Cheng. He was forcing him to dodge, forcing him to be distracted so that he couldn’t use the Army Formula!</p><p>This was the “Mantis Kick” from China that had the unique characteristics of Shengxiang mixed in it!”</p><p>If Lou Cheng was to use this move without Force Concentration and with only his hands as support to exert force, the power on the leg might be fierce but would definitely not be considered as sharp. However, the fist arts of Shengxiang focused a lot on the kungfu of kicking and withdrawing. Through training, their entire leg was just like metal. A “mantis kick” could even split a metal bar, not to mention the fragile ankle!</p><p>Within the explosion sound, Baco predicted Lou Cheng to jump to avoid his low sweeping kick. The joints of his arms suddenly bent and then straightened instantly. This allowed his body to leap up creepily and towards his enemy in mid-air.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>His elbow was tilted at an angle while his knee smashed upwards. With his metal-breaking momentum, he executed a series of consecutive attacks.</p><p>While in a perilous situation, Baco fully executed his strength and demonstrated what a grandmaster in national fist arts was like. At the same time, he had forcefully negated the disadvantageous position he was in.</p><p>However at this moment, although he saw Lou Cheng had jumped, the seals made by both of his hands were not disordered in any sense. His expressions were serious, solemn and unchanged. He looked completely composed as though he was watching a fight between children.</p><p>Oh no! As the thought flashed through his mind, he could already hear a low voice propagating throughout his ears.</p><p>“Army Formula!”</p><p>The ancient voice resonated and Baco could hear a buzzing sound in his brain. He felt that he was drowning in the bloodthirst of thousands of people, resulting in the failure of his curse and caused frightening boomerang effects. He could only feel countless hideous face with grudges wanting to drag him to endless hell by pulling his legs.</p><p>No, no, no! He was screaming incessantly in his mind while trying his best to resist. However, he wasn’t able to break free from the fear no matter how hard he struggled.</p><p>After connecting with the Army Formula, Lou Cheng quickly lowered his arms and swung his wrists as he descended. A glowing white light was emitted and headed directly at the enemy who was still in a daze while in mid-air. Each move connected tightly and consecutively. As compared to the battle with Veigar, he had indeed improved steadily.</p><p>“Ice Sect” Twenty-sixth style. “Ice Burning”– Modified!</p><p>On the other side, Baco could see that he was on the verge of falling into hell. Suddenly, he felt pain cruising throughout his five organs and six viscera. It felt like there was something wriggling there vigorously!</p><p>Leveraging on this stimulation, he woke up in fear and broke free from the influence of the Army Formula!</p><p>At the crucial moment, secret arts “Body Protection”!</p><p>However just as Baco walked out from the fear and terror in his heart, he saw a ball of frost light coming straight at his face, burning quietly with cold ice flames.</p><p>Poof!</p><p>Baco tilted his head backwards and his thoughts almost stopped. If it wasn’t for his strong body, he would have fainted directly.</p><p>While feeling a biting cold and stiffness, he wanted to shout but felt slow and powerless. Knowing that this wasn’t good, he quickly released the fear in his body and instantly both of his legs landed on the floor.</p><p>Bam bam bam! His skeletal muscles exploded in an instance. Something seemed to be wriggling and expanding in every part of his muscles as he broke through the ice layer covering his face. At the same time, his body had creepily turned from slightly slim to exaggeratedly muscular. When compared to before, he was even taller by half a head!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The ring was shaking vigorously. Baco stomped his feet and threw his punch as he generated a gust of wind that could blow a kid away.</p><p>It’s just the right time! He had long made his visualisation and completed his hand seals. With his hands pointing at himself, he wriggled his abdomen, involved his throat and shouted,</p><p>“Fighting Formula!”</p><p>Bam! He had also grown taller. Surrounded by sounds of broken things, he pulled back his right arm and shot out a quick punch as though he was firing an arrow. His fist collided head-on with Baco’s fist which was wrapped in tattered black bandage.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>This time, it wasn’t a dull sound but a deafening explosion. Both of them shook at the same time.</p><p>Baco, who was still experiencing lingering frost and damage, was slower by half a step. Instantly, he saw Lou Cheng had contracted his breathing and gathered his mind, residual force and recoil at his lower abdomen. This allowed him to stand firmly at his original position.</p><p>Bam! The Dan aura in Lou Cheng’s body gushed out like an erupting volcano. His left leg expanded and with a jerk in his knee, he had swung his kick towards Baco.</p><p>At this distance and attacking speed, Baco wasn’t able to dodge. He forcefully stimulated his blood and breathing to drive out his potential. Following which, he contracted his leg muscles and kicked out.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>After a dull sound, he, who was slower and had a weaker kick, bounced off and moved back. His body was still shaking and was about to fall.</p><p>Lou Cheng took a small step forward, covered his left arm with crystal cold frost and pushed upwards. He clenched his right fist and struck solidly. A layer of fire started burning as his fist rubbed against the air at high speed.</p><p>“Zhu Rong Force”, Exploding Fire Fist!</p><p>Boom! Baco had no chance for counterattack and could only lower his elbows and cross them in front of him to defend. He looked extremely sorry after withstanding the blow from the fist and the flames caused by the explosion.</p><p>This wasn’t over yet. Lou Cheng swung his left arm down with momentum, grabbed hold to Baco’s shoulders and pulled him towards himself. Using the momentum, he moved to his side, raised his right arms and threw an elbow strike at the speed of lightning.</p><p>Bam! Baco barely withstood it with his arms. However, he was sent retreating from the blow. His chest had taken a hit making him felt pressured and wanting to throw up blood.</p><p>Lou Cheng moved again. His strength wasn’t great but accurately kicked the side of his opponent’s knee. Baco, who was already unsettled, finally lost his balance.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Lou Cheng twisted his waist and his other leg swung out closely behind. His leg was contracted tightly as though it was a battle axe. It was tough and fierce and sent Baco flying instantly.</p><p>Taking huge steps forward, he didn’t give Baco the chance to use his curses to struggle. With a visualization of the dreamy and dark “Ice Spirit Holy Light”, he threw an uppercut with momentum.</p><p>“Severe Warning!”</p><p>Bam! Baco lowered both of his arms and perilously tried to withstand. However, his vision suddenly went dark, and he seemed to have lost his thoughts too.</p><p>Plop!</p><p>He had become a “stone” and fell heavily onto the floor. He fell right at the feet of Lou Cheng and Lou Cheng quickly stopped, his fist at his throat!</p><p>The face of the referee from Shengxiang immediately changed. He sighed secretly, raised his right arm and announced loudly,</p><p>“Lou Cheng wins!”</p><p>Till now, Baco, who had received consecutive blows, had not recovered from the freezing of his thoughts!</p><p>Ka-cha!</p><p>Ann Chaoyang had captured this moment and quickly switched to the live thread. He was still thinking of the explanatory note to be appended.</p><p>In the thread, “Eternal Nightfall” Yan Xiaoling was anxiously rushing him,</p><p>“And then, and then? What happened after Lou Cheng’s Flame Force is beyond expectation?”</p><p>“@Schrodinger Tiger, wake up! They must have exchanged several blows by now! What’s the situation now? [Grabbing and shaking a person expression]” said “Brahman”.</p><p>Ann Chaoyang paused for a while, quickly type some words and send over with the picture.</p><p>“And then Lou Cheng won…”</p><p>After a short period of silence, the forum users started expressing how they felt one after another.</p><p>“Oh damn!”</p><p>“I really wanted to use quality three consecutive blows…”</p><p>“Is his opponent made of paper?”</p><p>“I heard that he is close to the inhuman stage?”</p><p>“My mum is asking me why I’m kneeling down while looking at the forum…”</p><p>“Ahhhhhhhh, I’ll like to see a comedy!”</p><p>…</p><p>Ann Chaoyang pondered seriously and explained,</p><p>“Baco didn’t dare to use curses on Lou Cheng. Moreover, he was surprised by the erupted Flame Force at the beginning of the match and quickly lost the “medium” for his curses. Because of this, his overall strength has decreased by a huge chunk and he is no longer near the inhuman stage.”</p><p>“…””Unparalleled Dragon King” sent an exclamation mark and said, “Just as I have said.</p><p>There should be a line drawn between sixth pins and inhuman stage. It should then be named after Lou Cheng.</p><p>“The Road to Arena” seconded and continued, “It feels like his opponent is completely helpless against Lou Cheng!”</p><p>You guys wouldn’t speak like this in just a few days… Ann Chaoyang withstood the urge to reply and thought to himself.</p><p>In just a few days, Lou Cheng will likely start morphing!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
