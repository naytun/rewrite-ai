The special training members had gathered, in the Songcheng University Martial Arts Dojo after two and a half months of hiatus.</p><p>It hadn’t been long since they clinched the Inter-university Martial Arts Nationals. Having made decent improvements on their own during the summer break, everyone wore smiles on their excited faces.</p><p>“He Zi, did you face get rounder again?” asked the brash Wang Dali when he spotted his familiar teammate with a careless glance.</p><p>His buzz cut above his vicious features made him look like a man who just finished serving time.</p><p>He Zi stared daggers at him, her hands forming a contemptuous gesture.</p><p>“Why does it bother you that my face is round? Am I eating your rice or am I wearing your clothes? Don’t make me transform you into a yaoi character by the end of this night!”</p><p>Since I was young, my face has not once been slim, even during my skinniest days! What do you want me to do about it? I’m the victim here!</p><p>Yaoi character… Then Wang Dali remembered. The round-faced girl was a well-known artist, a master at operating the graphic tablet, in the School of Arts. She once posted a series of drawings, under the title “hot-blooded Martial Arts Club”, which ended up being well-received by the Internet.</p><p>Of course, no one knew whether she really drew yaoi in her spare time.</p><p>As Wang Dali teetered between acting tough and begging for mercy, Cai Zongming emerged from the changing room, in a white martial arts suit with black trim. He scanned left and right.</p><p>“Great, we can form two tables of Mahjong…”</p><p>The fourth years remaining were Sister Xiao Wen and Senior Brother Li Mao. The third years Cheng and himself. The second years consisted of four members—He Zi, Wang Dali, Jin Lu and Mu Jinnian. Counting the student from the new intake, Deng Yang, who had confirmed his attendance, nine members were there in total; but since that bastard Cheng had taken up a part-time job as a martial arts coach and had to travel back and forth, he was omitted, which makes eight of them— just the right number for two tables of Mahjong.</p><p>“After the intake, we should at least have twenty members, right?” Li Mao asked prudently.</p><p>An abundance of first years took an interest in trying out the special trainings, but not many persevered. Martial arts classes that took place once or twice a week was, however, fully booked.</p><p>“That’s why you have to cherish us, prez! For starters, you should organise more activities that can enforce our camaraderie and esprit de corps!” suggested He Zi with a serious expression, before adding with a grin. “Like Dou Dizhu(Chinese poker game) championships and werewolf games!”</p><p>Having known her for a year, Cai Zongming knew that the round-faced girl was a chatterbox beneath her cold and aloof appearance, and that she could take jokes once she opened up to someone, so he went on to tease her. “But aren’t you the Dumb Duo with Yan Xiaoling? Can you really play a game like werewolves?”</p><p>Ehhhhh? When did we earn that title? It must be Xiao Ling’s fault that my name is sullied since we hang out a lot!</p><p>“You have to be responsible for your words, prez! Check out my intelligent looks! How can you liken me to Xiaoling! I even figured out some tips and tricks to werewolves!” protested He Zi, pointing to herself.</p><p>“What tips and tricks?” Cai Zongming asked indifferently.</p><p>“When in doubt, kill Dali!” she replied determinedly, grinning as she looked to her side.</p><p>“What have I done to offend you?!” Wang Dali being targeted for no reason made Mu Jinnian and the others burst out in laughter.</p><p>In the ebullient atmosphere, Deng Yang arrived. His hearty appearance told of his vigorous Qi and blood, which everyone approved. After Cai Zongming introduced him, they all felt surer of the Martial Arts Club’s future. There wasn’t a need to fear for the legacy to end after all.</p><p>At seven fifty-six, Lou Cheng stepped into the Martial Arts Dojo, stopping before He Zi and the others. With a chuckle, he began his “self-introduction”.</p><p>“From today onwards, I will be your coach. Coach Lou!”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Nani?”</p><p>…</p><p>Astonished voices rose and fell. Mu Jinnian, Wang Dali and the others exchanged confused glances.</p><p>“Um, in order to settle some matters, my master has already departed for the Ice God Sect. But fear not, as a part time coach this year, I believe I am capable enough to guide you. The school will also be sending a former martial artist to instruct you, but his role is mainly to act as the captain. Sister Xiaowen, you are a fourth year, so you should focus on finding a job. Not everything needs to be done on your own. Pick some people to help you, teach them the ropes. ” Lou Cheng’s well-paced advices slowly put everyone at ease.</p><p>It wasn’t all that different to have a Heavenly Son of China, who recently reached the Inhuman stage, to replace their Physical-Invulnerability State Mighty One coach. After all, Coach Shi had been missing for the most part.</p><p>At that moment, they felt as if Lou Cheng was the pillar that held the Martial Arts Club in one piece. As long as he was there, the Martial Arts Club will not crumble!</p><p>“Okay, I’ll check with Xiaoling to see if she has the time to help me out,” nodded Li Xiaowen, smiling.</p><p>“Other than being lazy and short-tempered, Xiaoling doesn’t have any shortcomings…” He Zi jested in a hushed voice.</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed, sweeping his eyes across every member as he pondered his next words thoroughly.</p><p>“Seems like everyone made good use of the summer break. Let’s start off by making a small goal for this year— pushing more of you to the Dan stage.”</p><p>The words that concerned them caused a stir among the youthful and energetic crowd. Excitement grew as they exchanged information on the threshold to Dan stage, hopeful about their own futures.</p><p>According to Coach Shi, mastering Force Concentration was where one’s path of martial arts truly began. After that, no matter where they went, they could be sure to lead a decent life!</p><p>Lou Cheng listened with a smile, until their discussion began to die down, and cleared his throat.</p><p>“First, let me tell you about my experiences when I made the breakthrough to Dan Stage,” he announced.</p><p>The words took the breath out of everyone, quieting down as they eagerly stared at “Coach Lou”.</p><p>Though there were many Dan Stage experts who shared their experiences on the internet, no one could confirm their validity. How could something like that hold a candle to a live explanation from a living High-Pin Dan Stage expert?</p><p>Lou Cheng brooded, then began in a sonorous voice.</p><p>“Back then, my master only said ten words “The Human Body Big Dan, round and emits dazzling brilliance”. “Human Body Big Dan” refers to turning into one with the forces surrounding one’s body. Forming one entity. During your trainings, don’t leave any loose ends by avoiding the things you deem as unnecessary. “Round” refers to the all-round clarity of force, Qi, blood and spirit. It should be mellow and unclouded. Removing the “impurities” from your body is going to be a long haul, and it won’t do you any good to rush things…”</p><p>“What I just mentioned are all long hauls. The most important part is the three words “emit dazzling radiance”. This refers to a state of mind, that is, your willpower. I remember an ancient one’s quote that went like this: “What is there to say, when my heart is the light!” And what do I mean by willpower? It’s the reason that drives you to practice martial arts. It’s the reason why you willingly pour your heart and soul into martial arts! It’s not about lip service, shouting empty slogans or doing foolish things on a whim. You have to constantly reflect on yourself. Delve deep into yourself, and find the power that truly keeps your heart beating. Then put it to test. Enhance it. Over and over again until your willpower truly condenses and takes shape… ”</p><p>“Perhaps it would come across some of you as easy. If so, allow me to give an example that might be hard to swallow. Everyone has dreams, but how many actually puts it to action and fights for it? And after putting it to action, how many can overcome the hurdles and obstacles? Like most motivational speeches, this overlooks many elements in reality, but you get my point… ”</p><p>Combining his first-hand experiences, Lou Cheng explained the abstract concepts of seeking inner power and condensing martial arts willpower in a down to earth fashion. He Zi, Deng Yang and the others pondered over his words, somewhat taking away something from it.</p><p>Coach Lou’s teachings had substance in it!</p><p>“Unlocking your hidden potential is not something you can achieve overnight. It might require you to go through certain things. It’s the reason why Theravada Sadhus in Shengxiang frequently go through Tapas. Of course, I’m not asking you lot to beg for your meals, to not eat past noon, or to torment yourselves. What I’m asking you to do is to ruminate about the method that best suit yourselves…”</p><p>On the surface, Lou Cheng’s effortless manners was that of a tempered guru, but in reality he was on the verge of breaking into a sweat.</p><p>Being a master and coach wasn’t easy at all!</p><p>Even though if was something he already mastered, expressing it in succinct words turned out to be no easy task.</p><p>The description he gave at best conveyed 50-60% of what he actually meant…</p><p>“Alright, we’ll stop here for today. Take the time to digest it, don’t rush things. Come look for me if you run into any problems,” said Lou Cheng, secretly heaving a sigh of relief. “Begin your stance practice.”</p><p>“Yes, Coach Lou!” they answered in unison.</p><p>Then, they exchanged glances and smiles. Once again, they found the feeling of when they stomped the Nationals as a team!</p><p>…</p><p>When He Zi got back to the dormitory room, Yan Xiaoling had just gotten up, and was climbing off the double-deckered bed.</p><p>“Coach Shi went back to Ice God Sect, so we have Coach Lou now,” He Zi said, trying to sound nonchalant.</p><p>Yan Xiaoling froze, one foot in slipper and another on the stair. “Coach Lou?” she repeated.</p><p>“Yes, Lou Cheng!” replied He Zi, her lips curving into a sweet smile.</p><p>“… I, I’m attending the special training!” blurted Yan Xiaoling. “I want Lou Cheng’s personal guidance!”</p><p>“Three minutes of enthusiasm,” He Zi said sharply, tossing the words right back at her.</p><p>“…” Yan Xiaoling was rendered speechless. Suddenly, she slapped a hand on her thigh. “Oh shit, I forgot to apply for it! When does the recruitment for special training start?”</p><p>“After the first years go through their mandatory military training,” she replied. “Xiao Ling, is something wrong? You don’t look like you are in a good mood these days.”</p><p>In fact, she was on the verge of tears during her call with her family.</p><p>Yan Xiaoling twitched her lips before letting out a sigh.” It’s nothing serious, just that…every time I go home, it feels like…right, it feels like I’m at a stranger’s home. I can’t wait to make my own living and get my own home.”</p><p>He Zi didn’t press on the topic and managed a smile.</p><p>“Thank goodness, I thought someone had bullied you! Come to me if you run into any problems in the future! I’ll be rushing to your rescue with wings on my back! My forces awaits your signal!(Kung-Fu Hustle reference)”</p><p>She never knew the happy-go-lucky Xiaoling went through such experiences and sorrows…</p><p>” He Zi (Box), your boyfriend power level is over the charts! ” praised Yan Xiaoling, her mood lifting as her thumb did.</p><p>He Zi nodded with a smile.</p><p>“Well said! From now on I will monitor to ensure that you wake up on time, do your homework and memorize English words!”</p><p>“Ah?” Yan Xiaoling looked even worse than before.</p><p>…</p><p>“Ding!” came the message ringtone. Picking up his phone, he saw the 500,000 RMB prize money from King of Youth Pro League arriving in his account.</p><p>That increases his total savings to 2,450,000 RMB. He wouldn’t have to worry about the cost of being a “a man in the air” for the year. He would most likely be in the professional martial arts the following year, so income wasn’t a concern.</p><p>He snapped a screenshot of his balance and sent it to Yan Zheke.</p><p>“Waiting for September 14th! [clenching fist, radiating]”</p><p>But before that, he had to pass the test and upgrade his 8th Pin certificate to 5th Pin!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
