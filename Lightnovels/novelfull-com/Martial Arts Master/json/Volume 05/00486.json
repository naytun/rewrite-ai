This was an official match between Peng Leyun and Ren Li, who had been considered at the same level for a long time after a full year. When they fought the previous time, one of them was a weak sixth pin while the other was a top class seventh pin. Currently, both of them had entered the inhuman stage and were definitely worthy of the title of the Heavenly Son of the Era.</p><p>It’s a shame that the audience for this match didn’t know about the history and meaning behind this battle and it couldn’t be in a better environment.</p><p>Ren Li was secretly regulating her breathing and shaking her muscles faintly as warm-up. In her eyes was the reflection of a young man who was fully concentrated and no longer acting casually and standing opposite of her.</p><p>The referee looked around, raised his right arm and shouted with a bright and loud voice,</p><p>“Begin!”</p><p>As he completed his words, Ren Li immediately strode towards the left, cut back instantly, mobilized her muscles, tendons and force in response and swept towards Peng Leyun with a loud thud and a visible tornado resulted in the process.</p><p>Rustle! The whimpering of the wind seemed to be summoning the devil from the sky, disrupting the emotions of those who heard them.</p><p>Peng Leyun traced the image of the sacred and majestic “Thor’s Image” in his mind to keep his mind in check. He could already feel the heavy pressure of the wind in his space as Ren Li was about to close the distance between them!</p><p>As destined nemesis who knew each other well and through, he didn’t attempt to probe further. He placed both of his palms together and was ready to use “Thunder From The Clear Skies”.</p><p>At this moment, Ren Li seemed to have noticed. Her “Wind Force” immediately expanded, wriggled her muscles, changed her centre of gravity and made an impossible turn from that high-speed charge.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>At the point where she turned, a loud explosion sounded. It was as though an aeroplane had flown past at low heights or a high-speed train zooming past at full speed at a distance of several centimeters away. The strong wind that was created made the referee raised his hands subconsciously to cover his face as his body shook slightly backwards.</p><p>Ren Li’s “Wind Step” had already exceeded the impossible realm and reached the level of inhuman. As she turned, the wind she created could even push a person away!</p><p>Peng Leyun’s “Thunder From The Clear Skies” was engulfed by the loud explosion. As for the thin blade formed, it broke on the track that Ren Li was initially on, as it made contact with the floor of the ring and created a trail of burn marks.</p><p>After sparring between themselves, they were no longer probing the other party. From the very beginning, the match had been thrilling and breathtaking!</p><p>After completing the turn, Ren Li suddenly sunk her shoulders. Using her wrist, she turned her force into a wind blade rotating at high-speed and shot it toward the throat of Peng Leyun at high-speed. At the same time, she twisted her waist and sent seven kicks towards Peng Leyun. Every single strike was aimed at the ankles of Peng Leyun or his knees, completing a low altitude “Wind Sect”, 27 style.</p><p>Attacking from both the top and bottom, a combination attack of “Stern Blade” and “Whirlwind”.</p><p>Peng Leyun seemed to have predicted it in advance and raised his arms in front of him. Electric sparks were enveloping his fist from the bottom to the top and met the bottom of the Wind Blade. The attack was neutralized in the sharp screeches from the friction and the electrical buzzing sound as the attack turned into a gust of wind.</p><p>In his body, a vortex was increasing in pressure and turning at a crazy speed. At the moment when he used his arm to block the “blade”, he was “pushed” away violently by the wind pressure caused by Ren Li’s Whirlwind consecutive kicks. He swung back nicely as he didn’t straighten his back nor exert strength.</p><p>Bam, bam, bam!</p><p>Ren Li’s kicks missed her target. Peng Leyun strode ahead, retracted his blood flow and breathing, erupting the Dan Force, pulled his tendons, catapulted his muscles and executed “Machine Fist”.</p><p>Ta ta ta ta ta! The sounds of the fist didn’t stop and electric sparks could be seen everywhere. Ren Li did not retreat and executed the “Whirlwind” again. Stomping violently, it was as though she was floating in mid-air as she created terrifying and strong wind.</p><p>Seeing that electric sparks were spewing everywhere, strong wind sweeping to the surrounding and the endless “bam” explosions, Lou Cheng and Ann Chaoyang couldn’t help but felt amazed and astonished at the mastery levels of Peng Leyun and Ren Li when they gave their all in their fight.</p><p>“The Big Devil” who was serious from the very beginning was truly frightening. His attacks were smooth and well connected while his defense was cool and collected. As for the unreliable Ren Li, she wasn’t at the losing end at all. Her kick techniques were astonishing and with the palm sword technique, she was evenly matched with Peng Leyun.</p><p>An intense battle at this level was an inspiration to the two of them from time to them. Both of them didn’t dare to blink their eyes in fear of missing out on the critical moments.</p><p>As a result, Lou Cheng only took some pictures occasionally to post it into the live thread. Everyone was also understanding of his current situation. This was because it was the same for everyone. The raucous discussion previously had already turned cold and sporadic.</p><p>Phew. When I completed my morph and consolidated myself, will I have the same standards as the current Ren Li? Lou Cheng thought as he was watching.</p><p>His morphing had been in progress for close to five days. He had already made it past the most difficult initial stage and completed more than half of the progress. All that remained was seven to eight days of minor polishing and gradual concluding. From the physical aspect, he could be considered as a typical inhuman stage expert now. However, he was still lacking in the fine control.</p><p>Hmpf. It might not be as precise as Ren Li but practical battle standards should be similar… Lou Cheng nodded his head as he passed judgements on himself.</p><p>Bang bang bang, bam bam bam!</p><p>On the stage, dust was floating around. The strong winds didn’t stop and lightning shimmered incessantly, lighting up the eyes of the audience. Ren Li and Peng Leyun fought, moved, and competed with positioning, making sharp turns from time to time as they battled from the center position to the left side and then from the left side to the other end. On the floor, there wasn’t a piece of tile that was still nicely intact.</p><p>In this five to six minutes, they didn’t use many simplified physical invulnerability moves. This was because they didn’t have a very good opportunity and once they missed, they would have easily become passive and be suppressed by the other party.</p><p>After another intense period of fighting, Ren Li finally moved in a ghostly manner to the side of Peng Leyun by leveraging her advantage in positioning. She finally got hold of a great opportunity!</p><p>In her mind, she naturally traced out an image covering green whirlwind, seawater, forest, huge boulders and others that connect directly to the skies!</p><p>This brought changes to her relevant muscles, tendons and internal organs. At the same time, her “Postwind Force” intertwined layers by layers, forming a “helix”</p><p>Following closely, various kinds of wind blew past, replacing the gale and formed an image of a female god statue, suppressing the force that she was losing control of.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Ren Li bent her body forward, shifted her left arm up to defend. She turned her waist using the momentum and shot out her right fist from the bottom up like a sky cannon!</p><p>Peng Leyun took in a deep breath. He executed a Force Concentration, expanded his arms, bent his elbow and crashed into it as sparks were fluttering out.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Sounds of explosion were rapid. Ren Li retracted her right arm. Her fist was aching and muscles were numb and took a few steps backs uncontrollably. As for Peng Leyun, he could only feel that every muscle in his body was being pulled and torn. The strong wind arose from the bottom of his feet and surrounded him, making it hard to resist and started flying upwards!</p><p>Wind Sect, tenth move, “Nine Heavens Breath”!</p><p>Simplified Physical Invulnerability Move!</p><p>Peng Leyun was sent flying when Ren Li suddenly stomped her leg. With another loud thud from the sudden change in direction, she reached the landing spot of her opponent. She made preparations and was lying in wait for Peng Leyun.</p><p>Facing this, thoughts flashed past Peng Leyun quickly. He quickly started visualizing as it finally stopped at the image of a green jade amulet floating in void space.</p><p>Bzzzzt!</p><p>Lightning was crisscrossing around the “Jade Amulet” and formed an ancient carving. Inside Peng Leyun, “Divine Wrath Force” was gathering and forming on his right palm.</p><p>Pa! He pressed down quickly and a thumb-sized silverish-white electric shock gushed out of his palm and headed directly towards Ren Li.</p><p>This was a different application of “Thunder Seal”!</p><p>If he wasn’t at the inhuman stage and his body hadn’t mutated, Peng Leyun would also not be able to use such a move!</p><p>Ren Li could feel her head numbing. When her opponent pressed his palm downwards, she immediately bounced off from the ground by forcefully generating strong wings and swinging herself away.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>The electric shock struck and hit the floor as it grazed past the body of Ren Li. Minuscule sparks spread to the surrounding area from the point it struck.</p><p>When he executed the “Divine Wrath Force”, he was already halfway down. When Ren Li gathered herself again, his legs had just landed on the sold floor.</p><p>The reason why he wasn’t using “Calamity” consecutively the way he did when he went against Wahku was because this opponent was different. Ren Li was able to throw out Wind Blade and had various methods. She wasn’t like Wahku who could only fight head-on after turning into “Asura”. Therefore, unless necessary, he felt that it would be better if he didn’t risk it.</p><p>Ren Li knew that her chance was only in an instant and didn’t hold back anymore. In her mind, the scene had already been fixed on the terrifying god of the Plague Sect, which has an indigo-colored face, cinnabar-liked hair, 3 heads and six arms.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>As she threw out punch, her joints seemed to have extended and her arms creepily grew longer a little.</p><p>Because of this ‘little’ extension, Peng Leyun’s dodge was rendered ineffective and he could only withstand the attack with violent force. With a barrage of fist attacks, he finally withstood the attack.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Ren Li was sent flying back from the attacks. As for Peng Leyun, his body was suddenly exhausted of strength. His breathing was rapid and was losing consciousness.</p><p>Knowing that Ren Li would follow up with “Hidden Scent”, he violently executed Force Concentration to dispel the effects first. Following which, he held his breath and started a crazy barrage of attacks.</p><p>Bam bam bam, bang bang bang. Fist, kicks, elbow strikes, knee blows… Every attack of Peng Leyun was filled with a thick layer of silverish-white electric shock. In the eyes of Lou Cheng and the rest, that was equivalent to electric strikes after strikes.</p><p>The consecutive strikes of “Calamity” had been turned into an explosion on flat ground. Yet it was equally terrifying!</p><p>For an inhuman expert, not breathing for several minutes wouldn’t be a problem. However that was under the scenario of not engaging in intense exercise. As of now, Peng Leyun had held his breath for two full minutes while executing crazy series of attacks. Yet, he was not showing signs of slowing down. This made Lou Cheng felt the distance between the other party and him.</p><p>Ren Li expedited “Hidden Scent” as she clenched her teeth and trying to persevere. Her “Wind Force” was constantly destroyed as she suffered electric strikes incessantly and couldn’t open up the distance between them.</p><p>Time passed and the numbness accumulated in her body finally reached the limits. She was even unable to execute “Force Concentration” as Peng Leyun broke through her arm guard with an elbow strike. Following the momentum, he swung his fist towards the throat of Ren Li.</p><p>Ren Li’s body went numb and her movement slowed. She wasn’t able to defend in time and could only see that fist stopped right in front of her vital point.</p><p>The referee didn’t hesitate, raised his hand and announced,</p><p>“Peng Leyun wins!”</p><p>Ren Li heaved a sigh and was speechless from the sorrows. After some time, she used a “Force Concentration” to suppress part of the numbness she felt. Following which, she clasped a tightened fist in her palm as a form of respect, turned around and walked down the stone steps while her muscles were still twitching.</p><p>After taking two steps, she suddenly stopped. This was because Peng Leyun was still standing there without moving. It was as though he was enjoying the cheers of others.</p><p>Doubts arose in her mind. Ren Li turned her head around, looked at that guy and asked softly,</p><p>Why aren’t you moving?”</p><p>Peng Leyun revealed a forced smile and replied,</p><p>“I’ll faint once I move…”</p><p>For the last 10 strikes, I could no longer hold my breath. And now, the effects of “Hidden Scent” has completely shown up…</p><p>I will faint if I move… Ren Li was stunned for a moment. An arc revealed at the edge of her mouth as some sense of satisfaction appeared in her eyes. She waved at the medical personnel at the side, raised her head and said,</p><p>“You guys can help him down!”</p><p>After finishing, she walked down the stage proudly. Her emotions had turned for the better for unknown reason as she accepted the compliments of Lou Cheng and Ann Chaoyang.</p><p>For the last quarterfinals match, Gusai won easily and claimed the last slot in the semifinals.</p><p>The drawings lots ceremony was to be held shortly behind. The guest drew out the first name:</p><p>“Gusai!”</p><p>Eh… Lou Cheng turned his view from his phone and saw the guest took out the second ball.</p><p>Hopefully the host nation will try to fix the match again. I’m the weakest besides Gusai. Pick me, pick me!</p><p>Picking me is his only chance of entering the finals!</p><p>The guest took a look at the ball and display it to the surrounding.</p><p>“Peng Leyun!”</p><p>Ah… Lou Cheng was stunned for a moment. When he regained consciousness, his opponent had already been decided.</p><p>Kaori Karasawa. The top seed, Kaori Karasawa!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
