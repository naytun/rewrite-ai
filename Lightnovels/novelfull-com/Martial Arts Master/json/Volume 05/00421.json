A new message came in, and Lou Cheng picked up his phone. Apparently, his champion prize had arrived.</p><p>“Your account XXXX has received 250,000.00 yuan at three quarters past 9 AM on April 30. The current available balance is 904,724.84 …”</p><p>Since the National Martial Arts Competition drew so much attention, the cost of copyrighting and admission tickets soared. Each team would have to at least spend 500,000 yuan to cover the car fare, board, and the lodging for two weeks. Along with the bus fare and rental for the practice field, etc. Anything remaining was used as a subsidy for the coach and team members.</p><p>The prize for reaching top eight was 800,000, followed by 1,100,000 for semifinalists, 1,400,000 for second place, and 1,800,0000 for the champion.</p><p>This time Songcheng University had been quite generous. They required only 300,000 yuan for administration fee after a deduction of 380,000 yuan to cover expenses. As a cadre, Geezer Shi, Lou Cheng, and Lin Que received 250,000 each.</p><p>Yan Zheke received 100,000 since she had fought many matches and won the key battle at the Capital; Li Mao, who had fought strenuously and been injured, received 80,000; Cai Zongming, who had fought alone, received 60,000; Lin Hua, who joined the fight with the He Brothers, received 40,000; the three substitutes, Sun Jian, He Zi, and Wang Dali, received 15,000 each; and Li Xiaowen, who took care of the everyday errands, received 10,000.</p><p>As for the rest of the team members, those who had taken part in the training but did not fight at the Capital, were subsidized with 3,000 yuan each. The rest of the bonus went into the public account of the martial arts club to cover the daily expenses, such as PC maintenance, parties, and meals …</p><p><em>“I didn’t realize that I was already a millionaire …”</em> Lou Cheng was cheerful as he took a screenshot to show Yan Zheke the money he had earned.</p><p>He was convinced that he was not rich. However, as a college student, he had no mortgage, no marriage or honeymoon plan, and he didn’t have to pay for a nursery or elderly care.</p><p>Besides, he received a set of red pellets from Ice God Sect every month. He lived on campus, and he only went out for one or two dates every week. So food wouldn’t be a huge expense. Although he had spent some money on red pellets for the practice of theSwordsman Formula, his total expenses from mid-February to the present added up to less than 100,000.</p><p>That was not a small amount to Lou Cheng, but when he agreed to the contract with Wu Ting’s father, he got a 700,000 fee for the endorsement and a 250,000 bonus for winning the National Competition, he couldn’t help feeling excited about the money he had earned.</p><p><em>“Am I too simple?”</em> he couldn’t help but think.</p><p>Yan Zheke replied, “I also received my bonus. We are millionaires.”</p><p>“We are a family of millionaires.” Lou Cheng sent an emoji of “pushing up sunglasses with pride” and said, “I have packed up my things. Should I come over?”</p><p>They had made travel plans for Labor Day. Considering they had already skipped class for two weeks, one more day wasn’t going to be a big deal for them. So they decided to plan in advance and come back one day later than scheduled, thus avoiding peak traffic and increasing the length of the holiday!</p><p>What a wonderful plan!</p><p>“Wait a minute. I need to clean up my face,” Yan Zheke said, bewildered.</p><p>“Are you putting on makeup? This is serious and I’m flattered,” Lou Cheng joked.</p><p>“You complained that I am not taking you seriously when we go out on dates. Well, I’m making it up to you,” Yan Zheke replied with a cute emoji.</p><p>“I’m looking forward to it.” Lou Cheng became lost in his fantasy.</p><p>Lou Cheng put down his phone and looked around. He noticed Zhang Jingye, the Model Worker, carrying his package as he passed by.</p><p>“Are you going on a trip with your girlfriend?” Lou Cheng asked with a teasing smile.</p><p>“Sure. You too?” Zhang Jingye saw a huge bag on the table.</p><p>“Yep. Skipping class this afternoon?” Lou Cheng laughed.</p><p>Zhang Jingye found him amazing as he said, “I bet you are not attending class either.”</p><p>“I am afraid you are right,” Lou Cheng answered playfully.</p><p>“Aha!” Zhang Jingye replied with a smile as he exited the dorm.</p><p>At that moment, Zhao Qiang was putting some books into his bag, and he commented,</p><p>“I am so envious of all of you! I have to go to class!”</p><p>“Hey, Qiang, you once mentioned an old classmate, didn’t you?” Lou Cheng asked him.</p><p>During winter break, Zhao Qiang had reconnected with one of his high school classmates who also happened to be a student in Songcheng. They caught up so quickly that Zhao Qiang once announced in the dorm that he was about to take the opportunity and get rid of his single label.</p><p>Zhao Qiang coughed and looked shy as he said, “I’m just thinking …”</p><p>“Hey. It takes more than thinking to pursue a girl. You have to give whatever it takes and not be a coward.” Lou Cheng sounded serious and then he smiled. “After you’ve failed enough times, you will get used to it. There is a walking casanova in our neighborhood, you should ask for some advice.”</p><p>Zhao Qiang sighed, saying, “If I were half as good as you, I would have won the girl’s heart already!”</p><p>“What can I do if you insist on your opinion?” Lou Cheng shrugged his shoulders. “Nevertheless when I am with Yan Zheke, I am practically nobody, and I mean it.”</p><p>He then tossed his hair jokingly.</p><p>To be honest, Lou Cheng made a substantial breakthrough in regards to his relationship with Yan Zheke because they shared a common experience during the Challenge Tournament of the Warrior Sage, which had been an inspiring and miraculous journey. Lou Cheng’s quality and potential had won Yan’s heart.</p><p>Bravery was necessary when pursuing a girl, but it wasn’t enough. After all, any girl being chased after does not have to accept.</p><p>“You are right…” Zhao Qiang understood and muttered, “Nevermind. Some adults reminded us to spend more time on studying instead of dating.”</p><p>“…” Lou Cheng was speechless as he watched Zhao Qiang leave the dorm with his bag.</p><p>After killing time by playing with his cellphone, Lou Cheng finally received a message from Yan Zheke. “Five minutes and then you can come.”</p><p>“Sure.” Lou Cheng replied as he carefully picked up his bag.</p><p>He would rather wait the five minutes outside of Yan Zheke’s dorm.</p><p>As he left through the door, Qiu Zhigao came back with his face covered in sweat and said,</p><p>“It’s late. We’re about to be late!”</p><p>Seeing Lou Cheng, he put on a smile and asked,</p><p>“Cheng, please be honest with me. Can I achieve the Amateur Third Pin before graduation?”</p><p>After hard work, for four semesters, Qiu sadly found out that he was not a gifted student. Although he had passed all of the exams, he never ranked in the top 20%, so a scholarship was out. So he started to face the reality and picked up martial arts. He hoped to get a certificate of the Amateur Third Pin to be more competitive in the job market.</p><p>“Based on your physique and strength, insist on working out three times a week and we will see,” Lou Cheng answered affirmatively.</p><p>Qiu Zhigao was exhilarated. Lou Cheng was a master in the college martial arts circle in his mind. If Lou found him OK, it would be OK.</p><p>“Alright. If possible, could you give me some advice, or if there is anything I can do that will help, please let me know.” Old Qiu was in a rush to the classroom, so he picked up his bag, and took a quick shower in the bathroom.</p><p><em>“Everyone chooses a different path…”</em> Lou Cheng sighed and left the dorm with his bag. He then glanced into the neighboring room and he was astonished with what he saw.</p><p>Little Ming was either focusing on studying or writing something.</p><p>“What’s wrong with you?” Lou Cheng blurted out in confusion.</p><p>Cai Zongming raised his head and answered gruffly, “What’s wrong with learning? We will have almost a month without school, so I decided to keep up with my studies.”</p><p>And then he put on a relaxed smile as he said, “Though, Fang Yuan said so…”</p><p>“Why don’t you go to the classroom?” Lou Cheng asked absently.</p><p>“Is there something wrong with studying in the dorm?” Little Ming asked in reply.</p><p>“You cannot withstand the temptation of computer games there.”</p><p>“Actually, phone games are even more popular. I can play wherever I like, even if I don’t have a particular place to study.” Cai Zongming sounded quite serious.</p><p>Lou Cheng retorted, “But the atmosphere in a classroom is different. Everyone else would be studying, and it would be shameful for you to play your phone game.”</p><p>Cai Zongming replied in disapproval, “Cheng, do you think I am the kind of person who would be influenced by others or the atmosphere? And you think that that would cause me to focus on my studies instead of games?”</p><p>“No…” Lou Cheng gave him a thumbs up and then left through the door.</p><p>…</p><p>Lou Cheng only had to wait a few minutes outside of the no. 3 dormitory building before he saw his girlfriend come out carrying a new suitcase. She was pretty and elegant, like a fairy from a painting.</p><p>Yan Zheke was beautiful when she put on some makeup… Lou Cheng couldn’t help but stare, and Yan Zheke felt satisfied as she raised her head.</p><p>“Here, let me.” Lou Cheng tried to take her suitcase</p><p>“Nevermind, you disabled man, I’m fine,” Yan Zheke joked.</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed, saying, “Seriously? Disabled man?”</p><p>“Haha…” Yan Zheke chuckled as she responded, “You have to take my hand!”</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled. “It’s fine. I can walk and I can take my fairy’s hand.”</p><p>Yan Zheke heard her cell phone ringing as she was about to say something.</p><p>“It’s my grandpa…” She looked at the screen in puzzlement before she answered, saying, “Hey, Grandpa?”</p><p>“Hi, Ke …” Ji Jianzhang said, while smiling, in his slightly old voice. “Bring Lou Cheng home this holiday so your grandma and I can get to know him.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
