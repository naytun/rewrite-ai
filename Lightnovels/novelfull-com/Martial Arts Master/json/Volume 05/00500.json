However the district Martial Arts Association and the Capital had sent personnel to the ground to conduct a joint assessment. The whole process was in the name of justice and fairness.</p><p>“Yes, you may begin.” The leading old man, who had a head of white hair and a peaceful look, nodded his head.</p><p>An inhuman at an age younger than twenty-one. Who knew how far he would reach in the future? Although they were all seniors of higher ranks and were authoritative figures, they also wouldn’t offend the other party for good no reasons over a small matter.</p><p>In the world of martial arts, there was a saying. “You would rather bully a rich old man than a poor young one!”</p><p>Lou Cheng paid respect to them and strode to the side of the field, facing a hanging sandbag.</p><p>He lowered his stance slightly and allowed his blood and breathing to flow back, gathering at the diaphragm of his lower abdomen. It felt a little empty and borderless while also feeling a little like being compressed into a ball that was terrifyingly smooth.</p><p>His Dan Qi was overflowing, and his muscles were expanding with the shape clearly defined. Following which, he shrugged his shoulders and threw out his arms as though he was punching directly ahead.</p><p>In this whole process, his punch burnt through the air with scorching red flame. It was as though he was wearing a violent and explosive glove.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>His fist landed on the target. An explosion like situation happened. The whole sandbag suddenly collapsed. Every grain of sand seemed to be covered in a layer of scorching red flame and was shooting ahead as it moved along with the shockwave. The burning sound it made would have sent chills down people’s spines.</p><p>When all of this ended, an oval shaped fan was formed with the sand in front of him. Seeing the area where the sand grains had scattered, the assessors couldn’t stop their eyelids from twitching.</p><p>“Emperor Yan Force” was indeed something!</p><p>To be able to use the real material and complete “Emperor Yan Force” while doing a “Force Concentration” was enough to prove that he had completely morphed and no longer was a typical human!</p><p>“It’s true that most heroes showed themselves while they are young!” laughed the grey-haired old man. “We have no issues on our side. You just have to sign your name on the certificate and send it back to the headquarters at the Capital later. After waiting for about ten minutes, you can head directly to the office to collect your certification.”</p><p>Although the other two assessors were a little angry about the dictatorial-like actions of the grey-haired old man, who announced the results without consulting them, they could only smile and say, “Congratulations pal, it has been several years since Songcheng had an inhuman.” They didn’t create a fuss about the incident as the grey-haired old man was their senior and this incident was simple and direct.</p><p>“Sorry to have troubled my three seniors.,” Lou Cheng replied courteously.</p><p>After chatting for several minutes, he bade farewell to the assessors and went to the office to wait. He didn’t have to wait very long before he collected the Professional fifth pin certification from the employee. There was a serial number, his name and a red stamp!</p><p>The whole certification collection process didn’t take more than twenty minutes. For Lou Cheng, who was well known recognised by the public, this was really just a formality.</p><p>Puff. Lou Cheng heaved a sigh. Opening the certification on his hands, he took a picture of it and felt a million emotions welling up in him.</p><p>When he came to collect his Professional eighth pin certification last year in September, he had never expected to be able to attain a high pin in just a year. He had even planned to take part in one or two pin certification competitions.</p><p>Plans really couldn’t keep up with the changes!</p><p>From now on, everyone could officially address me as a high pin Dan Stage expert!</p><p>Lou Cheng kept the certification and sent the photo to Yan Zheke to take a look. After flirting with his girl for a while, he then uploaded it to his Weibo. He didn’t append any words and click the “send” button directly.</p><p>The certification by itself could tell a thousand words!</p><p>After refreshing and reading through the congratulatory and impressed messages, Lou Cheng walked along the corridor and headed out of the city Martial Arts Association.</p><p>He only took a few steps when he suddenly saw a familiar yet foreign figure entering the building.</p><p>When the guy noticed him, he was apparently shocked. After a short moment, he was enlightened suddenly and asked with a smile,</p><p>“You are here to collect your fifth pin certification?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Lou Cheng took a glance at the other party and mumbled in his heart. Who is this guy? He looks pretty familiar!</p><p>The guy had a common hairstyle, typical facial features, distinct parting and a steady aura that made him look like a cultured person. He did not notice the hesitation from Lou Cheng and exclaimed with a radiant smile, “When I lost to you last year, I was not convinced at all. Who would have known that in just a year’s time, you’d have left us in the dust?”</p><p>After hearing what the guy had said, Lou Cheng instantly remembered who he was.</p><p>He was Peng Chengguang from Mingwei Martial Arts School and he’d fought him in the preliminaries!</p><p>At that time, he was 24 years old and had held the professional ninth pin certification for 3 years. His vitality was so strong that it had reached the limits of that level. Within his punches and kicks, there were also some feelings of “Withdraw”. He was considered to be one of the most pressing opponents outside of the Dan Stage.</p><p>This guy became famous at a young age and was the most sought after body-refining stage martial artist in Songcheng and was a target of various large martial arts schools. However, in order to preserve the independence of the “Mingwei Martial Arts School” left behind by the previous school owner, he preferred to practice kungfu that was very ordinary. Because of this, he had stagnated at the level before Dan Stage and couldn’t achieve a breakthrough.</p><p>After scrutinizing him, Lou Cheng revealed a sincere smile. He clasped his fist to his palm and said,</p><p>“I guess I should be congratulating you too?”</p><p>The intense vitality that was overflowing had completely gone under control and others couldn’t observe it easily!</p><p>As someone who had been through this process, Lou Cheng knew clearly what this represented!</p><p>Peng Chengguan accepted the greeting honestly and replied emotionally,</p><p>“I have just achieved the breakthrough a while ago and is here to collect my certification. Sigh. I can’t be compared with you, I can’t.”</p><p>After speaking, he clasped his fist to his palm too to congratulate Lou Cheng for reaching the inhuman stage.</p><p>Both of them weren’t particularly familiar with each other and left after chatting for a short while. Just before he stepped out of the main gate, Lou Cheng turned his head and took a look at Peng Chengguan, who was disappearing at the corner of the corridor. He sank into deep thoughts and nodded his head. After searching for his information, Lou Cheng found out that he was still in Mingwei Martial Arts School. Relying on the “work” he was doing for the Martial Arts Association, he got a rather average martial arts education in exchange.</p><p>To be able to persevere in what he believed in after experiencing through so many ordeals, facing temptations, failures, disappointment and pain yet remaining unmoved, this level of willpower, is something that even I am ashamed to admit that I’m not a match.</p><p>After getting past the threshold of Dan Stage, Peng Chengguang will not face any more obstacles before the inhuman stage!</p><p>As for what’s after that, he did not have the foresight yet to see so far into the future.</p><p>…</p><p>After leaving the building where the Martial Arts Association was, he made his way to a martial arts school in the vicinity and took out his phone. He opened the app and was intending to book a ride.</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly felt thirsty. Therefore he went to a supermarket at the side. While choosing performance drinks, he was thinking of the trip to America next week.</p><p>His longing over the last month started to swell up little by little. The lingering disappointment started to dissipate little by little. Lou Cheng was filled with anticipation as he started dreaming about the scene when he would meet up with Yan Zheke again. Subconsciously, he started conjecturing what kind of emotions and topics he would have with his girl. Should he let his emotions flow and give her the most passionate and intense hug, or should he showed his emotions slowly, allowing her to get reacquainted to it gradually…</p><p>As he thought, Lou Cheng had already created a few Television Drama scenarios in his mind, all of them about the romantic time they would have together.</p><p>Naturally, as an adult male and a married person, it was inevitable that he would recall and hope for some matters that were not suitable for children’s knowledge. As he continued thinking, he got even more thirsty.</p><p>He stopped such a trend on time. Grabbing the overly iced performance beverage, he headed to the payment area.</p><p>Suddenly Lou Cheng stopped. Because of his imagination just now, he remembered something that he should be taking note of.</p><p>I’m already inhuman. Based on what Ke’s grandfather has said, there’s a good chance that he might get Ke pregnant…</p><p>I can’t be as reckless as before. I have to take all safety precautions…</p><p>Oh damn, I have not bought those things before. Should I post a thread to ask around? The title will be “How do I act like I have bought condoms before when I’m buying them for the first time?”</p><p>He’s getting a little embarrassed just from the thought of it…</p><p>Ask the search engine! Lou Cheng put down his drinks and took out his phone. After flipping through page after page, he had a plan in mind.</p><p>Based on what others had said, the payment area for most supermarkets would have condoms for sale. He just has to point at it when checking out, and the cashier would understand what to do. There wouldn’t be a need to converse during the whole process to minimise the awkwardness.</p><p>Cough. Lou Cheng wore his black framed spectacles, resolved himself, took the iced drink and waited behind the people at the cashier. After two to three minutes, it was finally his turn.</p><p>His gaze quickly swept through as he attempted to verify his target quickly.</p><p>Oh damn, why are there only chewing gum, lollipops and batteries? Where are those things that I needed? Lou Cheng was stunned.</p><p>“You want this?” The cashier picked up the lollipop and asked.</p><p>“Uh……” Lou Cheng didn’t know how to explain and just nodded his head. He took out his loose change, took the iced drink and lollipop and left.</p><p>After leaving the supermarket, he finally regained his senses. He took a sip of his drink and thought to himself.</p><p>What the hell am I doing right now!</p><p>After finishing his lollipop, he resiliently found another supermarket. This time he wasn’t anxious but still did a detailed surveillance of the surrounding and locked on to the position of his target. Hmph. They have a rack solely for selling condoms!</p><p>Seeing that no one was around, he quickly took a peek and realised there were several brands and each brand has different models.</p><p>There’s no time to go search about which brand is better. He took a box of each model, activated his “Ice Mirror” to control his emotions and went to the queue for payment nonchalantly, disregarding the occasional looks from others.</p><p>After a while, he came to the front of the cashier. The cashier saw the different colourful boxes and asked with bewilderment,</p><p>“All of them?”</p><p>“Yeah” answered Lou Cheng simply. His “Ice Mirror” almost failed.</p><p>The cashier looked at him with a strange look and didn’t continue. He completed the process quickly.</p><p>After payment, he put them in a bag and walked out of the supermarket calmly. When he reached the roadside, he finally felt relaxed. He felt just like he had crossed some extremely difficult obstacle.</p><p>…</p><p>Back in his room, seeing that Zhao Qiang and the rest were all not around, Lou Cheng couldn’t help but flip through his “Spoils of War”.</p><p>As he looked through them, he suddenly had another question.</p><p>How do I even use this thing? If I embarrassed myself at the critical juncture, wouldn’t Ke laugh at me for a lifetime?</p><p>Moreover there’s different models and types here…</p><p>After thinking seriously about it for a while, he opened up the wrapper and started reading the instructional manual. After which, he took a few of them and went to the bathroom…</p><p>After some time, he finally resolved all his queries. He walked out happily and confidently from the bathroom and happened to see Cai Zongming opening the door to his room</p><p>“Eh, Cheng, you look horny. Are you thinking about your trip to America next week?” tease Student Little Ming.</p><p>Lou Cheng was shocked and retorted, “You can tell?”</p><p>“Of course. Do you not know who I am?” answered Cai Zongming confidently.</p><p>You will be going to America next week. It will be strange if you are not thinking about it!</p><p>I can’t tell from the looks but I can deduce it!</p><p>Lou Cheng was stunned from being trick and was once again impressed by “Casanova’s” knowledge in this aspect.</p><p>After which, a week passed by like an eternity for Loy Cheng. Finally, the date September 14th stood out in his eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
