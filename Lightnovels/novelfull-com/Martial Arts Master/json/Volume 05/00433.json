Regardless of the overall style, Lou Cheng was already feeling warm and fuzzy inside after hearing that line. It sounded so pure, giving him a sense of serenity and blissfulness.</p><p>He could not help but turn back to look at Yan Zheke, only to see her also turn towards him with clear, bright eyes. Their eyes met and they both smiled.</p><p>Yan Zheke snuggled against Lou Cheng and reached out to hold his hand. Their fingers crossed and the wedding rings knocked against each other with a tinkle. Their hands were on their laps, holding down the little red book (Note to readers: In China, at birth everyone has to register their identity under a “household account”. The records are kept in a little red book. When a couple gets married, together with the marriage certificate, they would also register their names under the same household, the same little red book. ) With heavenly beams shining upon them, she leaned over and put her forehead on her newly-registered husband’s shoulder.</p><p>Feeling that weight, Lou Cheng had an unexplainable feeling that he never had before. Suddenly, there was the sense of a heavy responsibility. Together with it was a never-ending joy.</p><p><em>This girl’s life journey, happiness, and suffering will now be my responsibility…</em></p><p><em>I want her to smile purely and without worries for life…</em></p><p>The car continued to roll on as the music echoed, as though they were driving the path to eternity.</p><p>During the dinner, amidst the shopping and flowers, Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke would get excited talking from time to time, and then quieten down from time to time. They would look at each other lovingly. It was like they only needed to exchange looks. Without any words, the connection between them beat the connection of countless people.</p><p>Slowly walking through the “clouds”, the pair finally returned to the hotel, back in the warm, cozy room that had been cleaned and tidied.</p><p>“Ke, ever since we got our marriage certificate, you became like a newlywed wife. Wait, no, you’re a newlywed! ” Lou Cheng put down the cake and things that they had bought earlier. He teased his girlfriend. Wait, no, his wife!</p><p>Yan Zheke pretended to glare at him, and said with a joking tone,</p><p>“We haven’t been married long and you want the couch already? With such a huge matter, such a sacred matter, can’t I just be silent for a moment? Hmph, aren’t you the same? Like a lost goose, can’t even remember how to talk. All you know is to look at me and smile silly! ”</p><p>As he heard her words, he could not help but smile.</p><p>Yan Zheke put down the luring roses and glanced at the little red book in her bag. Suddenly, she got emotional again.</p><p>“It’s so magical, Cheng. Did we just get married like that? We’re now husband and wife?”</p><p>Lou Cheng looked into her eyes and answered with a chuckle,</p><p>“Yes, yes. The little fairy from the heaven is finally my wife.”</p><p>Yan Zheke’s eyes glimmered and her dimples danced. She smile softly and said,</p><p>“Coach Yan will also be your advisor for life…”</p><p>After saying that, the two of them laughed.</p><p>“Ke… ”</p><p>“Cheng… ”</p><p>This time, the term of endearment was no longer as each other’s girlfriend or boyfriend. They were now man and wife, starting on a new journey in their lives.</p><p>“Ke…”</p><p>“Cheng…”</p><p>In the midst of the soft mumblings, Yan Zheke’s eyes glittered. Lou Cheng’s body and heart tingled. The two of them got closer and slowly closed their eyes. They leaned towards each other and their lips touched.</p><p>A soft thud. Yan Zheke’s bag dropped onto the floor.</p><p>Piece by piece, their clothes fell on to the ground. This time, the lovebirds were soft and passionate. It was no longer as vigorous as yesterday. Their eyes were open, looking at each other, looking deep into each other’s eyes. Besides kissing, there was almost no distance between them.</p><p>Yan Zheke hung around Lou Cheng’s neck and looked at him lovingly. She panted slightly, feeling every gentle thrust going straight into her heart. Lou Cheng felt warm, wrapped, and embraced by the girl. They were melting together. Heart and mind, soul and body.</p><p>Without any sense of time passing, there were soft groans, and they stopped for a bit, enjoying every moment, every bit of being with the person they loved so much. They hugged.</p><p>“So this is our first night as man and wife, my beloved wife?” Lou Cheng kissed the girl’s ear lightly and chuckled.</p><p>Yan Zheke snuggled up to him and looked at him alluringly. “Can you at least say something decent?!”</p><p>She laughed and reached out to caress Lou Cheng’s face. Her slender fingers traced the lines of his face. Teasingly, she mimicked the speech of the olden days. “Yes, this is our wedding night, my beloved husband… I had intended to follow the traditions – to cut our hair and tie together. But sadly, you have no more than an inch of hair. It’s impossible to tie them…”</p><p>“Oh, yes, this is a problem then… ” Lou Cheng laughed lightly. He humorously said, “Didn’t you say I have a pair of trousers made of hair on me? We can use that.”</p><p>Yan Zheke’s pink lips opened and closed twice. Half annoyed and half tickled, she said,</p><p>“How does that count as being tied together?!”</p><p>A “flipping the table” emoji appeared in her heart.</p><p>This Cheng, how dare he!</p><p>“Then, how about this… We cut up all the hair into bits and mix them up. There’s me in you and you in me.” Lou Cheng’s fingers ran down her back that was glistening in a thin layer of sweat. He was no longer joking; he was seriously suggesting.</p><p>“… sounds plausible!” Yan Zheke happily put on her lingerie and started to look for a pair of scissors. But once she made too big a movement, her body stopped involuntarily. She winced in pain.</p><p>“Don’t rush! There’s nowhere to keep the hair even if we cut them now. Let’s go and buy two fragrance pouches tomorrow and we can have them by our sides all the time. ” Lou Cheng quickly hugged Yan Zheke and pulled her towards him. Feeling a little regretful for what he had done, he put his forehead on hers and said, “I wanted to hold back today and not do anything so that you could rest and recover, but in the end…”</p><p>With her current physique of a top Professional Ninth Pin, she should have recovered quickly. But yesterday night he did not control himself well. It was too vigorous, too passionate, almost a little rough.</p><p>“It’s fine. Without this, the marriage that only belonged to the two of us would not have been complete. I… I didn’t stop you either… ” Yan Zheke said dreamily.</p><p>She didn’t stop him. Instead, she was enjoying every moment of it.</p><p>With that kind of atmosphere and surge of emotions earlier, no girl could have resisted.</p><p>“Oh, alright, so do you prefer today’s style or yesterday’s?” The newbie, Lou Cheng, was curious, so he asked, trying to accumulate some experience.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s pouty mouth opened for a bit. Her already flushed face turned even more red. She turned to look toward the side and pretended to be annoyed.</p><p>“Neither!”</p><p>“Seems like I’ve to try harder!” Lou Cheng played along and nodded as if he was in deep thought.</p><p>According to his Listening Skill, Ke should have enjoyed both very much…</p><p>Yan Zheke’s mouth opened slightly like she wanted to say something. In the end, it seemed like she was too embarrassed to say it, so she did not. Instead, she hit Lou Cheng with “anger”.</p><p>In the midst of the longlasting ambiance, the pair fell silent for a while. With gentle eyes and smiles, they looked at each other.</p><p>After a couple of minutes, Lou Cheng recalled something.</p><p>“Tomorrow, Friday, we should hurry to change our marital status in the household registry records…”</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, he and Yan Zheke looked at each other and together they said,</p><p>“Maybe not!”</p><p>“Maybe later…”</p><p>After a short pause, Ya Zheke stretched her hand out and started to draw imaginary circles on Lou Cheng’s chest. She said, “If we do change our marital status, the school will find out. My mom and family will know too. It’s not that I don’t want them to know, but I’m afraid that they would think that you led me astray; always leading me along to do crazy things. Then they may develop a bad impression of you. I think we could just wait a little, till before our wedding ceremony, before we go change it. Or… maybe wait till someone chases us…”</p><p>As he heard her speak, he felt his heart warm up. Gently, he said,</p><p>“I also have the same thoughts. If my parents knew about how I just got married like that, they’d probably think that I never considered them. My mom would probably think that I’ve forgotten about her after having a wife. She might not think well of you. Such unhappiness may accumulate. Ke, let’s just follow what you say. We won’t change it for now. Wait till they chase. If they don’t, then we wait till we have our ceremony. If my parents find out, I’ll just say that it’s my fault. It was me who got afraid, it was me who didn’t have the confidence, so I asked you to marry me in secret.”</p><p>“Yes, yes. Same for me. If my parents find out, I will also say the same thing. I’ll say that I was worried that I’ll miss you and so I was selfish for once and pulled you to get married. ” Yan Zheke’s brows relaxed and she smiled at him warmly.</p><p>In front of their parents, they would put all blame on themselves, and protect the image and relations of their partner and parents.</p><p>The two talked a lot. They reminisced a lot, talked about the future a lot. It was only at half past 10 that Yan Zheke suddenly remembered that she wanted to take a shower quite some time back.</p><p>In such summer heat, after running around the whole day, even a fairy would sweat. She had intended to shower clean before spending the first night with Lou Cheng. But in the midst of passion, she forgot about it. Now, she was even more untidy.</p><p>“How dirty!” Upset, she hit Lou Cheng lightly before putting on her lingerie and flipping out from the quilt. She walked to the sofa nearby and put on her nightgown.</p><p>Looking at her feminine curves and smooth, white skin, Lou Cheng quickly chanted the Forwarding Formula in his heart, trying to suppress his stirring feelings, afraid that he would not be able to hold back and pounce towards her once again.</p><p>The night was beautiful. Unable to hold himself back from Yan Zheke’s unintentional seduction, he did not manage to clear his mind and heart. He did not manage to sleep on time. Of course, considering that he had to wake up earlier tomorrow, plus her body was almost at its limits, the girl drifted off to sleep after having another exciting round.</p><p>Next morning, Lou Cheng woke up on time. Unlike the usual days, he did not only have thoughts of training in his mind. Instead, he turned one side, leaning on a raised arm, he looked at his wife endearingly, his little fairy.</p><p>Yan Zheke was sleeping soundly. Her lips were in a cute pout. Her nose had a little arch up, sharp and cute at the same time. Lou Cheng could not help but to kiss her once again.</p><p>He took a deep breath and forced himself to get up. He did not dare to turn back, afraid that he would not be able to resist the temptation to stay. He quickly washed up, put on his clothes, and left the room quietly. He headed to where he trained yesterday morning.</p><p>This time, his shoulders, his chest, and his heart were just a little more stable than the past. Somehow, he felt an urge to level up and do even better in martial arts. It was like all the hurdles were no longer hurdles.</p><p>Bam, bam, bam! Pam, pam, pam! Punch after punch, kick after kick, every move was as swift as the wind. His heart and mind were clear and serene. With the Root Pulp that he was already so familiar with, he was calm and steady, filled with a positive atmosphere.</p><p>He felt Root Pulp was the first step towards the Inhuman stage. He was waiting till he could borrow some determination, spirit, and some internal training method to slowly lead it to change. Then he would be another step closer to opening the doors to the Inhuman stage.</p><p>Lou Cheng was at the first step. He had gone through what many would have taken ages to cross. He was at a stage of precipitation; he was strengthening his foundation.</p><p>With a target in mind, he now had a new strength to practice hard. After a tough training, he felt like he had received a lot. His mood got brighter, and he almost wished that he had wings to fly back to the hotel to be with his wife, Ke, to share with her his progress.</p><p>He ran back. When he entered the room, he found that Yan Zheke was already awake. The pair celebrated his breakthrough for quite some time.</p><p>Just as Lou Cheng was contemplating to go out to buy a fragrance pouch, Yan Zheke suggested,</p><p>“Cheng, let’s head back to school and return the household account book. At the same time, we could treat Dirty Tong and the rest to a meal. ”</p><p>In the past two days, her mind and heart were filled with Lou Cheng. She completely forgot to bid her roommates farewell. If they went back any later, Li Liantong and the other girls would have returned home and there would be no chance to gather again before she leaves the country.</p><p>“Sure.” Lou Cheng knew that his wife was rather close with her roommates. Since they would not know when they could meet again, it was only logical that they meet now.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
