Except for some pits, the fighting ground had been taken care of. Standing in the center, Lin Que saw Chen Diguo come step by step with a red handkerchief on his head. Chen’s body was as strong as a bear, looking calm and imposing.</p><p>The second-leading fighter in the Capital College Martial Arts Club was directly influenced by Ren Li and Peng Leyun. He was somewhat gifted, considering that entering the Dan Stage before graduation was worth his time and effort. Of course, he was going to graduate with a college degree, so he would be doing just fine if he were to choose another profession. However, when he met Ren Li in his sophomore year, he realized how narrow-minded he was and how trivial his pursuits were. Therefore, he was inspired to make a difference by not wasting his youth and energy!</p><p>Assisted and guided by Ren Li, Lin Que kept working on martial arts. Finally, he was admitted to Kongtong School and inherited the Wind Sect. It was in May, his sophomore year, that his strength integrated as one and his Qi arose from within his body. He entered the Dan Stage.</p><p>Over nearly two years, he had advanced gradually. Now he was a true Seventh Pin fighter who had entered the Dan Stage, ranking as the second-class Mighty One among fighters of the college level.</p><p>Of course, he paid the price. He was “infected” by Ren Li and was often lost in the martial arts world when he was walking. He even picked a place to practice any time he felt like it. He ended up becoming a “road idiot”—somewhat different than Ren Li. And although he knew the road, when he came back around to himself, he found that he was in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>Once, the club manager and deputy manager of the Capital College Martial Arts Club had gotten lost at the same time…</p><p><em>“He can be a tough enemy…”</em> Lin Que thought. All the details of his enemy flashed across Lin Que’s mind.</p><p>Chen Diguo obtained his certificate of Seventh Pin half a year ago. Now he was getting stronger…</p><p>Stepping forward a little, Chen Diguo held his body still and took the stance with his right palm stretching ahead. This was called the Fighting Stance.</p><p><em>“His Qi is guiding his moves,”</em> Lin Que thought, keeping a close eye on his opponent.</p><p>Lin Que lowered his position and got ready to fight. The atmosphere turned serious immediately.</p><p>In the area of the Songcheng Martial Arts Club, Yan Zheke put her hands together, feeling nervous, and stopped chatting with her boyfriend.</p><p>Lou Cheng leaned forward, putting down the energy drink, Sedative and Brain-invigorating Fluid. He crossed his hands and stared at the ring.</p><p>He had barely accomplished their goals. Their results now depended on his brother-in-law’s performance.</p><p><em>Ren Li will enter into the Inhuman State this year, becoming a high-ranked fighter of the Dan Stage. Peng Leyun will be even faster. As for me, my martial arts competence is of top Sixth Pin, yet my inner state is far below theirs.</em></p><p>Danqi was a great leap, while Inhuman was just a promotion. Essentially, Danqi had a greater influence on fighters, but in actual fighting, entering the Inhuman Stage could enhance a fighter’s competence more than entering into the Dan Stage could.</p><p>But why was that so? Because as martial arts competence was improved, stronger Might was gained. Even if it was only a tiny increase in competence, the effect would be significant.</p><p>As the audience held their breath, the referee raised his right arm and then put it down swiftly.</p><p>“Start!”</p><p>Lin Que stopped trembling. He held his breath and then directed his Qi to his feet.</p><p>His thigh and calf were swollen up immediately. His knees bent forward. Click! Lin Que leapt ahead as fast as a shooting star.</p><p>As a fighter, Chen Diguo had repeatedly watched Lin Que’s fighting videos, and he was ready for Lin Que’s opening attack.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Chen Diguo raised his right leg. His twisted his ankle in midair, kicking out with a strong wind toward Lin Que’s eyes.</p><p>This was the Stern Blade. But Chen Diguo’s strength and competence were less than Ren Li’s, so he could not bring about a sharp wind sword. He could only use that skill to attack his enemy’s weak points and to disturb his sight.</p><p>However, Lin Que’s leap was so fast that if he was hit by the wind blade, the impact would be so hard that it could result in damage to his eyes and blind him!</p><p>The wind was howling. Lin Que put his left arm at his chest and defended himself while still leaping forward. He endured and directly broke through the Stern Blade.</p><p>Of course, Chen Diguo never thought his Leg Blade was enough to fight back his enemy. After kicking, Chen drew back, concentrating his Qi and blood, strength, and spirit.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Chen’s Danqi was erupting out. He stepped forward and dragged his left arm behind. He looked serious as if he was under a heavy burden.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lin Que stood still. His muscles vibrated and his fascia trembled. He turned the momentum into the power of his blast punch with his clenched right fist.</p><p>“Boom!” Lin Que’s fists were like a cannonball, igniting the air in front of him and causing a blast that would have hurt any ordinary man.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Chen Diguo’s left arm had reserved all of its strength and now he pulled it forward like a steel whip, waving against Lin Que’s Meteor Blast and refusing to yield an inch.</p><p>Chen swung his left arm and stirred a strong wind toward the ground. The noise that resounded in the hall was proof of Chen’s Might. If the ground had not been cleaned up before, the ring would have been covered in dust by now.</p><p>This match between top fighters was legendary!</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Chen broke through the air blast by force, and then he stepped back. He then raised his leg and slanted forward.</p><p>He was fully aware that Lin Que’s Earth Cracking was the next move after Meteor Blast. So Chen carried out the Whirlwind, a secret skill in the Wind Sect, as an attack and a way of escaping Lin’s movement.</p><p>Pop! He kicked with both of his legs, arousing a continuous wind blast that made him float in midair.</p><p>Seeing this, Lin Que bent his body and lowered his position, stretching out his arms. He kept punching wildly by his resilient fascia and flexible joints as if he had more than two arms.</p><p>This was the Eight-Arm Divine Punch, the 113th skill in the Fighting Sect.</p><p>Bang! The sound was intense and deep. Chen Diguo’s Whirlwind was completely blocked. Before Chen switched to another move, Lin Que changed his strategy and visualized a fiery shooting star across the sky.</p><p>His shoulders and arms swung swiftly and he launched the Meteor Force onto his enemy’s feet.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>It seemed as if Chen Diguo had stepped on a mine. He could feel the paralysis climbing up from his feet.</p><p>He even felt that his right leg was no longer part of his body. It seemed disconnected somehow.</p><p>He drew back, with his Qi and blood fluctuating. His toe pointed to the ground, allowing him to endure by using Force Concentration to ease the impact. He decided to visualize a storm to control his muscles, fascia, and organs. The interaction would create a series of vibrations that would restore the body.</p><p>This was called the Storm Force of the Wind Sect!</p><p>He knew very well that if his Qi and blood refluxed now, Lin Que would seize the opportunity to carry out the Earth Cracking. And then he would thoroughly lose his balance and, afterward, Lin Que’s Doomed Death would take him down. So Chen needed to use another move.</p><p>Chen Diguo’s body was permeated with Qi, drifting in midair.</p><p>At that moment, Lin Que finished the gathering and realizing of his Qi and force in a short instant and then stepped heavily onto the ground!</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The ring was moving as if there were a volcano within it. The ground where Chen Diguo stood was cracked, with erupting steam and rocks.</p><p>But Chen Diguo was like a flying kite, floating away swiftly.</p><p>Lin Que seemed calm. He raised his arm and made a seal, shouting out,</p><p>“Move!”</p><p>He bounced ahead like lightning, arriving in front of Chen Diguo.</p><p>Chen Diguo drifted along with the Dan realm, and his Qi and blood were refluxing, which stabilized his body.</p><p>By doing so, he eased the impact of Meteor Force and, at the same time, he swung a Forward Punch to fight back. It seemed that Lin Que was moving toward his fists.</p><p>However, Lin Que was too fast. Chen had not even completed the stance.</p><p>At that point, Lin Que stopped on a dime. His Yin and Yang were recycling. His muscles trembled and the momentum of leaping forward turned into the drive that stabilized his balance and fascia.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Lin Que dodged Chen Diguo’s fierce Forward Punch by moving aside. And then he stretched his arms and limbs, lifting his left arm toward Chen’s head.</p><p><em>“Nice…”</em> Lou Cheng smiled and nodded.</p><p>Since the match began, Lin Que seemed anxious, but he had it all figured out. Now he finally had the upper hand.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
