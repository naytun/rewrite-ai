On The Other Thought, It Was Hell!</p><p><strong>Translator:</strong> Larbre Studio <strong>Editor:</strong> Larbre Studio</p><p>Theravada was a branch of Buddhism commonly known as Hinayana. However, they would never call themselves that and hated when others called them that. At the same time, they rejected what was known as Boddhisatva or Mahayana Buddhism. Based on the viewpoints of the three sects of Semitic, heresy was worse than followers of other religions!</p><p>This branch was strict and highly disciplined. They followed traditions closely and practised asceticism. With “Sixteen Insight Knowledge” and “Four Sacred Teachings” at their core, they practised to become Arhat in the modern times. Arhat was also known as the “Self-practice Man” and lacked the desire to help mankind. After understanding the miseries in the world and that everything was just illusory, they would only seek individual reprieve. In other words, before they completely surpassed “reincarnation”, they were very strong individually. It was especially so in the spiritual aspect as they were clearly unique and stronger than their peers.</p><p>Wahku was a monk like this and had practised the “Sixteen Insight Knowledges” to the eleventh stage of “Savkharupekkha Bana”. Through this, he clearly understood the body and desires were illusory and no longer felt persistence nor nostalgic for things. He would also be filled with indifference and alienation. At this stage, his spirits would be in an extraordinary stage and his strength would be frightening. The fact that he was ranked as the third seed was a testament to it.</p><p>He wouldn’t be weaker than Peng Leyun by much… Lou Cheng thought to himself. In his mind, various situations with Wahku flashed past.</p><p>At this moment, he heard the voice from the announcement and saw Peng Leyun, who was beside him, stood up gradually. His eyes were focused and no longer drifting.</p><p>Lou Cheng secretly smiled to himself, clenched his fist, and shouted softly,</p><p>“All the best!”</p><p>“Yeah!” Peng Leyun responded with a fist bump. His muscles and tendons were all shaking faintly, indicating the agitation and excitement in his heart.</p><p>Seeing this, Lou Cheng didn’t know why but wanted to mourn in silence for five seconds for Wahku.</p><p>The first generation machine of Shangqing Sect had finished recharging!</p><p>After bumping fist with Ren Li, Ann Chaoyang and Zhong Ningtao, Peng Leyun turned his body around and walked towards the ring with his aura rising. With every step, his surrounding seemed to get darker and pressurised. Dark clouds were almost formed and thunderous explosion sounds seemed to be sweeping every dissension in the world away.</p><p>Such an imposing momentum seemed to have materialised and was comparable to a senior inhuman stage fighter. However Veigar who was approaching directly towards him still maintained a miserable face. Only those eyes of his seemed deeper as though he had seen through the surrounding illusions. He wasn’t affected by it at all.</p><p>With regards to that, Peng Leyun was neither disappointed or frustrated. On the contrary, radiant light was gathering within his pupils, similar to the lightning that was about to strike down. The fighting intention was getting thicker and thicker.</p><p>When the two of them stood on the predetermined position respectively, the referee raised his right hand without any delay, swung it down and shouted,</p><p>“Begins!”</p><p>Peng Leyun lowered his body, gathered his Qi and his body immediately leapt up like a piece of cloud swinging over. What followed the light-weighted leapt was a loud explosion and intense vibration of the ring, causing Wahku’s body to sway.</p><p>His “Flash Attack” was no longer the same as previous.</p><p>In a flash, as though there were afterimages, Peng Leyun “appeared” in front of Wahku. He extended his right arm and turned it to a large hammer. Surrounding it with buzzing visible silver-white lightning, he smashed it towards his opponents fiercely.</p><p>Wahku did not move. He didn’t even try to resist the vibrations of his body. Facing this “hammer” of Peng Leyun, he heaved a sigh. After which, he took a simple stride ahead, stabilized himself and responded with a straight punch.</p><p>In the ensuing loud explosion, the hatred and will of abandonment in his eyes got stronger. His skinny stature seemed to be inflated and patches of gold started to appear on his yellowish skin. His punch had landed accurately on his opponent’s wrist.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Silver light was flickering and Wahku felt as though his hands had contacted countless needles. His body was shaking and couldn’t complete the subsequent movements properly. However his expression and gaze did not change at all. It was as though the one who got an “electric shock” wasn’t him. As for Peng Leyun, various uncomfortable feelings started rising. He felt just like being exposed in the rain and shine, enduring unbearable hunger and experiencing the various miseries of dehydration!</p><p>This caused him to be slower by a beat before regaining his conscious. As a result, he wasn’t able to leverage on the opportunity when Wahku temporarily lost control of his body.</p><p>“Heart Reflection Punch”, a secret fist martial arts of Theravada. Through this, he would be able to reflect what was in his mind on his opponent’s mind. At the same time, the opponent would experience the trials and the various feelings Wahku had suffered!</p><p>At this moment, radiant light started gathering in the eyes of Peng Leyun once again and the surrounding was illuminated. In his mind, he started visualizing a green-color jade amulet in the sky with electrical circuits forming complicated seals.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>He straightened his body and his muscles started inflating as blood was pumping into it. Without dodging, he took huge strides ahead, holding his fist and ready to strike.</p><p>Thunder Sect’s simplified physical invulnerability move, “Thunder Seal”!</p><p>Seeing this, Lou Cheng couldn’t help but smile. He opened his mouth and scolded,</p><p>“He’s playing again!”</p><p>Since he knew the uniqueness of “Heart Reflecting Punch”, the best choice for Peng Leyun would be to go with the momentum and used “Dan Force” to propel his “Machine Fist” and launched a series of fierce attacks to not give Wahku the opportunity to reflect his heart on his. However, he had chosen to use simplified physical invulnerability move to attack and not avoid the “needle head”. Other than wanting to “experience” the marvellous aspect of “Heart Reflecting Punch”, there’s no other explanation for doing so!</p><p>Facing an expert who was at the same inhuman stage as him, he actually still dared to allow his opponent to showcase his strength!</p><p>“‘Play’ is an apt word…” The bottled and gentle An Chaoyang nodded his head with approval. As for Ren Li, she was looking at the ring with a puzzled look. She was suspecting that Peng Leyun had something deeper objective hidden behind his decision to not go with the best response.</p><p>Hmph, it must be so!</p><p>Lou Cheng shook his head and laughed again,</p><p>“What would happen if he lost because he was playing?”</p><p>“What else could be done? Nonetheless, you are already in the top eight, Ren Li is ninety percent sure too and Ann Chaoyang also has his chances. Having one eliminated can still be taken as showing respect to the host country.,” laughed Zhong Ningtao calmly. “This can also teach Peng Leyun a lesson so that he will not be so arrogant in the future. How good is this?”</p><p>“Do you think this is possible?” Lou Cheng did not look at the Coach but turned and looked at Ann Chaoyang.</p><p>Would the big devil accept this type of lesson?</p><p>“I don’t think this is likely…” Ann Chaoyang heaved a sigh.</p><p>“Me too…” Lou Cheng also heaved a sigh.</p><p>When they talked, the situation on the field had changed. Facing Peng Leyun’s “Thunder Seal”, Wahku didn’t attempt to dodge too. His gaze seemed to have seen through the material world and a faint golden light started enveloping his body. After which, he moved his elbow, clenched his fist and threw it upward. He was going to fight Peng Leyun head on and fight toughness with toughness!</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The fist collided the golden and dull green light intertwined. Their muscles and tendons could be seen and suddenly, a loud explosion propagated from mid-air as though a bolt lightning had exploded on the spot.</p><p>Peng Leyun’s vision turned black and his mind had an unexplainable reflection. He was experiencing the ageing of his body and as time passed, he felt more and more powerless.</p><p>For an expert that habitually relied on his martial arts, this was the most brutal and painful thing. They had spent a substantial part of their lives to train diligently in order to obtain such strength. Yet because of the ageing of their body, they gradually lost their strength. Till the end, there would be nothing left and they might not even be able to defeat a young kid that had just started entering the path of martial arts.</p><p>How weak was this and how pathetic would this be!</p><p>Heart Reflecting Punch, “Old”!</p><p>This was opposite from the previous strike “Misery”!</p><p>Although Peng Leyun was still in his prime years and couldn’t understand such miseries, being in the Shangqing Sect allowed him to see the miseries of many elders after they aged. He had seen many of them plagued by the miseries of old injuries and the helplessness as they lied paralysed on their deathbeds. Peng Leyun had long felt strongly about these and Wahku through injecting his own experiences of ageing into Peng Leyun had caused him to remember those memories. Suddenly, the fear hidden deep within him suddenly erupted.</p><p>In an instant, he stood dazedly at the original spot. Cold sweat was breaking from his face and he seemed stuck in a nightmare that he could not wake up from. He even did not think of recalling “Thor’s image” to suppress his mind.</p><p>As for Wahku who had received his punch, his clothes were already tattered. His arms that were emanating golden light were slightly burned and his whole body was twitching incessantly. He was completely paralysed and couldn’t tell what was happening.</p><p>However, he had trained his body through miseries and had extremely strong resistance to pain, burns and lightning strikes. He had recovered first. With a face full of miseries, he twisted his waist and threw out his left arm.</p><p>Seeing that Wahku’s almost flat fist about to land outside the throat of him, without knowing why, Peng Leyun suddenly seemed to have suffered a double stimulation. He broke free from the nightmare of ageing and vitality reappeared in his eyes. Radiant light was gathering and a white flash was formed in a blink of an eye.</p><p>The vortex in his body was circulating at extreme speed and the sound of “motor” propagated to the surrounding. In the face of Wahku’s fist, he became like a “paper” and was pushed back by the “wind pressure” and managed to dodge this lethal strike by the slimmest of margin!</p><p>This was a very simple application of unlike poles attracts and like poles reflects!</p><p>In the two “electric strike” previously, using his extremely strong control over the core techniques of the Magnet Sect of the Thunder Sect, Peng Leyun had spread a layer of electric charges, that could be maintained for several seconds, over the surface of Wahku’s body. These charges were completely the same as those around his body and therefore when his opponent attacked, he got a response. Coupled and stacked with “Absolute Reaction”, he broke free from the feelings transmitted from “Heart Reflecting Punch”. He was able to execute the techniques of the Magnet Sect and salvage himself from a defeat.</p><p>Wahku wasn’t depressed and activated “Heart Reflection” again and used the killer move of this technique:</p><p>“Six Paths of Reincarnation Punch”!</p><p>From his perspectives, the six paths of reincarnation did just exist in the books of Buddhism and also existed in the world. These were illusory things but manifestations of the human mind.</p><p>Among which, “Hungry Ghost Path” was synonymous to “Greed and unrestraints”. “Animal Path” was synonymous to “uncontrollable desires”. “Asura Path” referred to the “bloodlust and desire for violence” in everyone. “Human Path” was the manifestation of the cause and effects of various loves, hates and grudges. “Hell Path” was the extreme end of “Human Path” and represented the miseries caused from extreme love, extreme hatred and extreme jealousy and was the opposite side of “Human Path”.</p><p>As for “Deva Path”, it referred to the mental state for those who had great cultivation level. These people had gotten away from the remaining give paths and obtained peace and freedom. However this mental state had not reached the point of unconventional and had not escaped from reincarnation. They might be affected by other factors anytime, controlled by their emotions and fell back into miseries. As the saying went: On one thought, it was peace. On the other thought, it was hell!</p><p>“Six Paths of Reincarnation, a reflection of various aspects of the world!</p><p>Wahku’s eyes shimmered in a layer of golden light. However the light was dull and alluring, calming his heart.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>His punch started from his waist level and brought with it a crisp sound without any weird signs.</p><p>Six Reincarnation Punches, “Hungry Ghost Path”!</p><p>Peng Leyun struck again and used “Thunderbolt Fire” to withstand this strike. He did not experience the feelings of “Misery” and “Age” as before and therefore launched his attacks nonchalantly.</p><p>However unknowingly, he felt more and more frustrated as he fought and started to neglect the surrounding more and more. It was as though he was trying to finish his opponents quickly and finding out the weaknesses of his opponents quickly. Wahku defended patiently and used both of his fists and legs to drag for time. From time to time, he would supplement his attacks with another blow of “Hungry Ghost Path” While solidly defending, other than his skin turning a little dark from the burns and the stacking of numbness throughout his body, there were no other signs.</p><p>As they fought on, their intense fight had reached the edge of the ring. As Wahku tilted his body to the side, Peng Leyun pounced forward and almost fell off from it.</p><p>As he twisted his waist, he suddenly awakened and realised the peculiar feeling in his body and mind. He immediately started visualising the utmost Yang “Thor’s Image” to dispel all the distracting thoughts.</p><p>When Wahku saw this scene, the golden light in his eyes immediately started turning red till it became a dark blood-like red.</p><p>“Six Paths of Reincarnation Punch” could be applied on himself too!</p><p>While thinking of Arhat, he was practising the arts of Asura!</p><p>Kacha! Wahku’s body seemed to have expanded as he grew by a few centimeters. The power of his muscles clashed towards Peng Leyun solidly as he tried to directly knock him off the ring.</p><p>At this stage, it was too late to remain calm!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
