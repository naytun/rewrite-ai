The majority of Japan’s representative group, no matter male or female, all looked lost, angry and sad. It was especially so among Ichiei Sakata and other disciples of the “Extreme Hadou Sect” who found it hard to disguise their misery and disappointment.</p><p>How did Mouko-kun lose?</p><p>How could he lose!?</p><p>As one of the signatures of the “Extreme Hadou Sect”, he had surprisingly lost to an opponent who was weaker than him by one level and in strength!</p><p>This was a disgrace!</p><p>This was a blight to the “Extreme Hadou Sect”!</p><p>Now all the audience both in the stadium or in front of their screen will view “Extreme Hadou Sect” as a joke now!</p><p>Kaori Karasawa used her finger and poked her face. In silence, she shook her head, forced a smile and said,</p><p>“Mouko-kun is still too careless.”</p><p>This was mainly because of his own battle style. Next, the information given by Sakata Ichiei was no longer up to date. Mouko-kun was too direct and too tough in his approach. Without roundabouts and gentleness, he went against the super killer move of his opponent head-on and suffered substantial damages. This had eventually become a serious hidden problem for the later stage.</p><p>If it wasn’t because of this, even without the “Wholeness” Formula, Mouko-kun still had a substantial chance of taking this match. If he used the “Wholeness” Formula, he would have definitely won!</p><p>It’s really a shame…</p><p>Obviously, Lou Cheng’s improvements, changes and performance really made others felt pressured from the bottom of their heart…</p><p>Hearing the sigh of Tang Zexun, Sakata Ichiei and the rest barely regained their conscious, broke free from their extreme emotions and starting to truthfully understand the battle previously.</p><p>When they looked towards the ring again, their gazes on Wang Zheng had changed. They were filled with more respect for the strong, astonishment for the one who kept on creating miracles and their anger for this terrifying enemy.</p><p>The researcher with messy hair was still in a daze and feeling both frantic enthusiasm and lost at the same time.</p><p>However not only had Mouko-kun, who promised to collect genetic materials for Great Japan, failed, but he was also beaten and had fallen. He was in a very sorry state as he bled and even threw up water…</p><p>……</p><p>Above the spectator seats, the audience, with darker skin tone, were initially stunned and unable to believe what they had just seen. After a while, they raised both of their arms and started applauding and dancing. This was to cheer on the boxing arts practitioners for his great performance and also for the young guy who defeated someone stronger than him.</p><p>An unseeded contestant had actually defeated a monster level fifth seed!</p><p>No matter which country one was in, similar incidents would always receive admiration and compliments!</p><p>“Lou Cheng! Lou Cheng!”</p><p>From just a few chants, the sound wave gradually gathered and quickly overlapped as one wave was louder than the previous wave.</p><p>“Lou Cheng! Lou Cheng!”</p><p>Standing sideways and hearing the cheers of citizens from different countries, Peng Leyun turned his head around and looked towards the ring. The lazy feeling in his eyes dissipated without a trace. In his eyes, there seemed to be light gathering, just like a flash of lightning.</p><p>Subconsciously, he looked towards Ren Li who was beside him. From each other’s eyes, they could see their own reaction.</p><p>Up till now, he might still have a small lead. However the three of them were almost at the same starting line now. Following this, it would be a race to see who could make the great leap and ascend to the top in one go!</p><p>— People like these were all proud in their core. They were able to identify their weaknesses but would never believe that they were worse than others!</p><p>Ann Chaoyang sank into silence and could only stay so. It was only till he heard Coach Zhong Ningtao sighed, “One with a good reputation will never be without real strength”, that he raised his head and spat out a breath.</p><p>At a remote corner away from the spectator stand, Banam with his hands and legs wrapped in bandages, Veigar wearing a general hat and Wahku closing his eyes and recuperating for his match subconsciously clenched their fists. A silvery- white light flashed across their eyes and they were looking seriously towards the stage.</p><p>…</p><p>“Just as I have said! Lou Cheng might just win!” In the live thread, “Unparalleled Dragon King” used the all-purpose [joking expression].</p><p>“Pig-Riding Knight” answered, “[Bewildered Face expression], this was simply… One year to reach the Dan Stage, one year to reach the inhuman stage… It felt like I’m seeing “Dragon King” when he was young. No, he’s more like the “Warrior Sage” currently.”</p><p>“I no longer dared to doubt him…””Road to Arena” used a [go-and-die expression] to reply.</p><p>“Okamoto’s Fan” sniggled, “Yeap, kneel down and lick my toes!”</p><p>“… We really do have foresight!””Wanton Seller” wasn’t stingy with compliments for herself. “I always have high hopes for him and even passed him a “voluntary signature book”!</p><p>An inhuman younger than twenty had ample time to go for physical invulnerability. He could be considered to have entered the reserved forces!</p><p>“Hahahaha. He did not waste my efforts for waking up early for the last few days!” Yan Xiaoling sent a voice message once again.</p><p>“Sleeping early and getting up early…””A Plumber Eating Mushroom” had recently gotten used to this fellow forum user who had a child- like face and voice. She couldn’t help but insult her, “Sleeping at two-three o’clock in the morning and waking up at twelve in the afternoon, you are really “early”!”</p><p>As for “Brahman”, she replied [unhappily], “If it isn’t me calling you, Little Nightfall you will never have made it! Oh ya, oh ya, let’s go tag “All-knowing Man in Ganghood” on Weibo and tell him that he can delete his account now! Quick quick quick!”</p><p>“All-knowing Man in Ganghood” was staring at the computer screen at the moment, looking at the private messages and tagged information he had received. The face turned grey and his eyes were filled with panic.</p><p>After a while, he resolved himself and intended to lie his way through!</p><p>The King of Youth Pro League isn’t directly broadcasted after all and the majority of martial arts lovers do not know of such a thing. I can just pretend to be blind and deaf for ten days and pretend I did not see the reminders. I can decide what to do next after Lou Cheng completed his “Morphing” and obtained his fifth pin certification. I will try my best to direct as many followers as I can for this period!</p><p>After taking a deep breath, his emotions finally calmed down a little. “All-knowing Man in Ganghood” started typing words quickly on his keyboard while continuing to look at his Weibo. He got to make the best use of every second to direct his popularity away.</p><p>These were all money!</p><p>After completing his typing, he saved them and decided to refresh the page before editing. When he did so, he was dumbfounded to see the number of messages tagging him appearing like flowers after a rain. There were already over a thousand messages!</p><p>“Number one in searches on the Wei Guangdan app!”</p><p>“You got to walk your talk!”</p><p>“Don’t be a coward if you are a guy!”</p><p>“I believe you are someone that will not go against what you promised!”</p><p>“[shaking his head left and right expression] Don’t pretend you are dead!”</p><p>…..</p><p>What just happened? “All-knowing Man in Ganghood” looked through messages after messages. He was both shocked and scared.</p><p>After researching in detail for a while, he found out that just ten minutes ago, star Mo Jingting who had a lot of fans, posted a video stream. At the same time, she used a [owl head expression] and appended a message:</p><p>“To become an inhuman after less than two years of martial arts practice, my little uncle is really great. You are my idol!”</p><p>The face of “All-knowing Man in Ganghood” turned pale instantly as he allowed the video stream to buffer.</p><p>Just as he expected, that was a scene of the first exchange of blows between Lou Cheng and Mouko Yamashita. It was clear that he had undergone morphing!</p><p>With his body shaking, “All-knowing Man in Ganghood” almost fainted. His complexion was extremely bad and was stunned for a full five minutes.</p><p>He stood up and started to walk around his room in a disorderly manner. He was just like ants on a hot pot. In his mouth, he was mumbling in a low tone constantly,</p><p>“You guys are forcing me to my death…. You guys are forcing me to my death…”</p><p>After a period of time, he sat down with a face full of sorrow, anger and hatred. He could no longer pretend that he didn’t see nor hear of the event.</p><p>His current fans were all attracted by sensationalizing news. If he didn’t fulfil his promise, he would definitely be despised by them. Soon, no one would pay attention to him anymore…</p><p>“All-knowing Man in Ganghood” deleted the long article he wrong on Weibo unwilling as though his parents had died. He retyped new content and was making a last-ditch attempt,</p><p>“Alright. I admit that Lou Cheng is one of The Heavenly Son of this Age. I will also fulfil my wager and delete this account. I will pin this message on Weibo for one week as an announcement. When the time comes, I will officially delete this account. If you wish to continue following rumours about martial arts and for those who wish to continue listening to my analysis if competition, please follow public account number xxxxx.”</p><p>Phew. With a week of time, I should be able to direct quite a number of people there right? “All-knowing Man in Ganghood” clicked the “Send” button. His body lay on the backrest of the chair as though all his energy had been drained away.</p><p>After which, he login to the platform to observe the increment of followers. However, the increment was very small. After the wave of the hot topic, the number had even stopped.</p><p>“It’s over, it’s over…””All-knowing Man in Ganghood” seemed to be able to see a stack of notes growing wings and flying away from himself. He closed his eyes and lay on the sofa.</p><p>…</p><p>Beside the driver seat of a moving car, Yan Zheke had made use of the time of the journey to watch the big match between Cheng and Mouko Yamashita. She was filled with anticipation but also uneasiness while watching. After finishing the video, she refreshed the forum excitedly and started to observe the Weibo of “All-knowing Man in Ganghood”. The more she looked at it, the more radiant her smile became. Towards the end, she even let out a peal of clear laughter.</p><p>Hearing this, the Dan Stage expert Du Yan, who was driving, turned around and took a glanced. Recalling what she had seen from the edge of his view previously, he asked with astonishment and envy,</p><p>“That brat in that competition is your boyfriend?”</p><p>How old is he and yet he has started morphing?</p><p>I think his name is Lou Cheng?</p><p>I had practiced martial arts for so many years and up until now, the inhuman stage was still only a dream for me!</p><p>“Yeah.” Yan Zheke covered her mouth and nodded her head slightly. As her eyes turned, he supplemented another line in his heart:</p><p>The truth is, he’s no longer my boyfriend…</p><p>…</p><p>On the ring, looking at Mouko Yamashita who was struggling to get up, Lou Cheng suddenly felt a million emotions.</p><p>In the match that just ended, he had won because of his bravery. If he was frightened by the “Wholeness” Formula of Mouko Yamashita and became depressed, desolate and not dared to counterattack, undoubtedly, he would have “died” in a prolonged re-match and suffer the bitter taste of defeat.</p><p>Truthfully speaking, he was a little arrogant before the match and felt that as long as he could continue the kind of performance he had previously, he would have an equal chance of winning against Mouko Yamashita with the improvements and surprise elements brought from the morphing stage.</p><p>However the truth taught him that it wasn’t only him that could surprise others. The rest could do the same to him too!</p><p>Phew! Pride and self-inflation weren’t things that wouldn’t happen after one reflected on it. They would return frequently as one’s individual strength increased and experienced broadened. Therefore there’s no wonder that people in the past talked about reflecting oneself multiple times every single day!</p><p>Lou Cheng’s emotions had settled and the elation brought by his broke through had dissipated substantially. In the cheers of the whole crowd, Mouko Yamashita who finally stood steadily and Lou Cheng bowed in respect to each other.</p><p>Turning around, he headed towards the stone steps and walked down. It was then that he completely regained his consciousness from the battle and his heart was filled with uncontrollable joy.</p><p>I won!</p><p>I won against the fifth seed!</p><p>I won against an expert at the inhuman stage!</p><p>His steps started to get faster and he couldn’t wait to return to his original position. His target was Ann Chaoyang. No, his target was the phone in Ann Chaoyang hands.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
