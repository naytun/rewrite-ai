Then he asked with a smile, “Pretty good. Sansheng, could you please make the best use of our time and explain to our audience about why you said ‘great’?”</p><p>“Timing, rhythm, and connection, all of them were great! Lin Que has made his Doomed Death famous!” Chen Sansheng continued to praise Lin Que. “For example, Lin Que showed great timing during his final movement that caught Chen Diguo. If he had turned the grasping hand into a palm a little earlier, Chen Diguo would have taken the opportunity to lower his shoulder and thus defuse Lin Que’s attack, which would have enabled him to totally block Lin Que’s attack with the following Force Concentration. On the other hand, if Lin Que had made his action later, Chen Diguo would have completed his Force Concentration and began withdrawing his Qi and blood, which would have weakened Lin Que’s punch as if he had knocked into a bunch of cotton.”</p><p>“So, if he had done it sooner or later, it would not have worked?” Liu Chang asked, echoing him.</p><p>Chen Sansheng nodded. “Yes, and that is exactly the core of Doomed Death. When Lin Que had trapped his opponent with Doomed Death, he would begin tangling them and interrupting their movements with a series of attacks. So his opponents could do nothing but struggle to block his attacks and finally drop into a hopeless situation. As a result, it was Doomed Death, not simplified physical-invulnerability moves, that was named the 10th movement of the Fighting Sect!”</p><p>“Great, great.” Liu Chang praised and then asked, “Sansheng, how much strength do you think Lin Que still has now? Will he be able to beat Jiang Kongchan from Capital College in the last round?”</p><p>“It’s hard to say.” Chen Sansheng shook his head and smiled. “I know what you are thinking about. But actually, I’m brave enough to make a judgment, or even a prediction, of the last round since I have been a commentator for so many years and am long accustomed to criticism for my wrong predictions. But this time, I indeed don’t know who will be the winner because neither Lin Que nor Jiang Kongchan has shown their peak states to us in the past two months.”</p><p>“Yeah, Lin Que defeated his opponents without much effort in the previous several matches, and Jiang Kongchan hasn’t even appeared in the ring yet.” Liu Chang nodded to agree with him. “But it seems that the fight against Chen Diguo has consumed much of Lin Que’s energy.”</p><p>The program director turned the camera to Lin Que standing in the ring, who was now gasping to compose himself, and his hair was damp with sweat.</p><p>“Yeah, Chen Diguo is a tough guy and only second to the top one among all the second-leading fighters, so Lin Que might have, at most, 30% or 40% of his strength remaining after that fierce battle. Jiang Kongchan reached the Dan Stage this year and was enrolled by Kongtong School to be the successor of the Kung Fu of the Wind Sect. And although what she learned was also not the core content, it was enough for her to advance by leaps and bounds. Now two months have passed, and it’s really hard to analyze her present condition. Well, it is her, and not Jiang Jingfeng, that was chosen by Capital University, so it proves that at least she is better than a normal Eighth Pin fighter,” Chen Sansheng said quickly.</p><p>After reaching a new stage, most of the warriors would advance by leaps and bounds over a period of time because there was new Kung Fu and knowledge for them to practice and learn. Lou Cheng, Lin Que, Ren Li, and Peng Leyun had all had this period, and Jiang Sansheng believed that Jiang Kongchan was no exception, even if the improvement she got was not as great as that of those abnormal ones.</p><p>“So, Jiang Kongchan is likely to win the match? It seems that Songcheng University is in danger…” Liu Chang said with a thoughtful expression on his face.</p><p>Then suddenly he smiled. “You reminded me of something interesting. Is Capital College the training base for Kongtong School? There are so many disciples of Kungtong.”</p><p>“Not all of them are. Take Jiang Jingfeng, for example.” Chen Sansheng smiled. “Now that Ren Li is in Capital University, all of the talented students will soon be sent to Kongtong School because of her relationship with them, and no other schools are as competitive as they are.”</p><p>“But things are different in Shanbei…” Liu Chang refuted him unconsciously.</p><p>“Fang Zhirong was selected as the successor of his ancestral Kung Fu before he entered the university. As for Xu Wannian, he hasn’t made any improvements for a long time, except for advancing his supernatural ability, so he couldn’t be enrolled by the Shangqing Sect. But anyway, now he is counted among the Shangqing Sect. Now you know that things are different in the martial arts clubs of the different schools.” The moment Chen Sansheng finished his speech, the program director immediately turned the focus to the scene.</p><p>Round three was about to start!</p><p>…</p><p>“Sigh…” Lou Cheng breathed a sigh of relief when he saw Lin Que finally catch Chen Diguo. Then he was soon struck by self-accusation, for there was a moment that he dared to doubt Lin Que’s strength.</p><p>But Doomed Death was really interesting.</p><p>“Sigh…” Yan Zheke tapped her chest and sighed with relief without hiding her feelings.</p><p>A joyful expression appeared on her face, but it was soon replaced with a worried look. She then asked in lowered voice,</p><p>“Cheng, how much strength do you think my brother still has?”</p><p>Looking at Lin Que in the ring, Lou Cheng said in his girlfriend’s ear,</p><p>“I fought with your brother for learning purposes just before the National Competition, and I know that his limit is making seven explosions in a short time.”</p><p>The remaining force of the Hidden Scent was still stirring up trouble within Lou Cheng’s body. Lou Cheng found it a little hard to breathe but soon pulled himself through the effect with the help of his strong physical body and active metabolism, and thus there was no need for him to go to the doctor.</p><p>“My brother has made the Sextuple Explosion and several other separated ones. He even used his special force and serial moves…” Yan Zheke turned her gaze upward while counting seriously, “Is he still able to use Force Concentration two or three times?”</p><p>The degree of difficulty of a Dan-stage explosion was superimposed according to its level. Though Lin Que could make one Septuple Explosion or two Quintuple Explosions, he was merely able to make a Triple Explosion instead of a Quadruple Explosion after a Sextuple Explosion. So the result of the next round was not as optimistic as they hoped, not to mention that Lin Que still had consumed a lot in the last round.</p><p>Lou Cheng thought for a while and then comforted the girl.</p><p>“We just fought to learn from each other, so what I saw might not be your brother’s real strength. Besides, more than half a month has passed and your brother has been learning and practicing in the ring, so I’m sure he has made some improvements, and now he may be able to make an extra Double Explosion and one or two Force Concentrations after expending so much energy. He is now in the same condition as those who have just reached the Dan Stage.”</p><p>“But the premise is that he won’t use his special force in the next round… While my brother is almost tired out, Jiang Kongchan is a new fighter at her peak…” Yan Zheke said with great concern in her eyes.</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed and then took the girl’s hand in his.</p><p>“You should trust your brother. There are many winning factors in an actual fight, and he will certainly take advantage of them. Even if he loses the match, he will force Jiang Kongchan to use up all her energy before he leaves the ring.”</p><p>Though speaking like this, Lou Cheng was actually feeling a little nervous since none of them knew Jiang Kongchan’s real ability except for that she had just reached the Dan Stage this year. In her previous matches with other fighters, she had been fighting in a straight and narrow way without exposing her real style.</p><p>Yan Zheke was about to say something else, but she suddenly stopped as Jiang Kongchan appeared in the ring.</p><p>Round three was about to start!</p><p>…</p><p>“I’m so nervous, so nervous.” Brahman posted a “trembling” emoji in Lou Cheng’s forum.</p><p>“Nothing serious. The worst result is that we lose the competition, but we will at least be one of the top four, right?” Unparalleled Dragon King said jokingly with a “you should be strong” emoji.</p><p>Eternal Nightfall, Yan Xiaoling, appeared. “Get out! I don’t remember having an elder like you! I don’t want to see Lou Cheng’s efforts be in vain.”</p><p>All Good Names Are Taken By Dogs and the other fans appeared one by one to sigh with emotion and then disappeared, turning their gazes to the broadcasting screen.</p><p>Round three was about to start!</p><p>…</p><p>In the seats of Capital College, when Chen Diguo was snatched and then thrown onto the ground, Jiang Kongchan, the girl with a cute, round face, did not stand up immediately. Instead, she still stared at the ring with her hands joined together at her heart, as if Senior Brother Chen was still able to turn the tide.</p><p>When the referee announced the end of the match, she finally sighed and left her seat.</p><p>Ren Li, who had just recovered from her inner injury caused by the shock, waved her clenched fist at Jiang Kongchan and yelled like a member of the cheering squad.</p><p>“Chan, good luck!”</p><p>“Kongchan, just try your best and do not worry about anything else. I’m sure you will win.” Shen You encouraged her in his usual, calm manner.</p><p>Jiang Kongchan smiled. “Senior Brother Shen, I’m not nervous at all. Every day I was at the mercy of my senior sister, and now I’m trained to be calm under any circumstances.”</p><p>“You upset me by saying that…” Ren Li murmured.</p><p>Instead of showing her great concern of the result of the match, she was still joking and laughing to cheer her junior sister up.</p><p>Jiang Kongchan took a deep breath and walked toward the ring.</p><p>She encountered Chen Diguo halfway, who was still suffering from aching muscles and dizziness.</p><p>Chen Diguo gave her a fist bump and then warned her in his low voice.</p><p>“Do not be frightened by Lin Que. He might not be your match if you fight against each other directly.”</p><p>Lin Que’s last attack exposed his present condition to Chen Diguo.</p><p>“Yeah!” Jiang Kongchan nodded hard and withdrew all her distracting thoughts before stepping into the ring.</p><p>She had made up her mind when she stopped in front of Lin Que.</p><p>She should neither be frightened by Lin Que nor look down upon him. Though she needed not worry about being defeated within a short time, she also knew it was impossible for her to win the match through fighting directly with Lin Que, since he might not be at his limit as she expected.</p><p>She should make the most of her strong points and fight in her usual style as she liked!</p><p>Looking around, the referee decided not to waste time. So he raised his right hand, waved it downward, and announced,</p><p>“Start!”</p><p>Round three started!</p><p>As the cheering sounds came from the stands, Lin Que took action before Jiang Kongchan. In the audience’s eyes, he was just like a cheetah pouncing on his prey from seven to eight meters away!</p><p>Jiang Kongchan felt both relieved and frightened. On the one hand, Lin Que had really used up most of his energy in the former round and now he was unable to use the Dan-stage explosion and the Xing Formula at the start as they would cost him too much energy. On the other hand, Lin Que had not lost his momentum at all in Jiang Kongchan’s eyes, which showed he was really a tough fighter.</p><p>Taking a step sideways, Jiang Kongchan turned in a clever way to dodge Lin Que’s attack and flash to his side at the same time.</p><p>Coming to an abrupt stop, Lin Que transformed the kinetic energy into an impact force with his trembling muscles and fascia and threw out his arm to the right, making a thunderous sound.</p><p>When Lin Que was about to complete his movement, Jiang Kongchan flew backward with Absolute Reaction, stopped herself by stepping onto the ground with her toes, and then bounced back to punch at Lin Que like a bolt of lightning.</p><p>Flying along with the fierce wind, Jiang Kongchan blocked Lin Que’s fist with hers, making a loud grinding sound.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As the two in the ring both swayed for a moment, a joyful look appeared on Jiang Kongchan’s face.</p><p>Now Lin Que’s strength had declined to the same level as hers!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
