That man in the black t-shirt vanished along with those warriors monitoring number 15 Wanhe Street. Maybe they were waiting for something to happen. The ancient town was too large, and it was hard for Lou Cheng to encounter them.</p><p>Finally, Lou Cheng had to turn his gaze to the two girls in the back row — he had encountered them several times yesterday and knew which hotel they were staying in.</p><p>It was not until four or five o’clock that he saw those two familiar figures again. One was good-looking with a fine body shape, and the other a plain-looking youth with an intelligent aura.</p><p>They came back to have a rest and then left on another journey. Lou Cheng followed them from a distance and pretended to be a tourist taking photos when they looked back.</p><p>The two girls walked and laughed, marveling at all the specialties and local instruments being sold on the roadside. It seemed that they were not looking for a place to have dinner but were just walking randomly.</p><p>More than half an hour had passed and Lou Cheng got a little impatient. Quickening his pace to surpass the girls, he took another route that narrowed the distance between them and he began eavesdropping thanks to his inhuman hearing.</p><p>“Xixi, it’s him again!” The literature girl secretly pointed at Lou Cheng.</p><p>Xixi, the pretty girl made a frown with her painted eyebrows and said, “He seems to be following us.”</p><p>“Haha, he must be attracted to your beauty but has to follow us secretly because he doesn’t have the courage to talk to you. I saw him several times yesterday!” the intelligent girl gossiped, “But our Xixi doesn’t pay attention to a dull, plain-looking, indoorsman.”</p><p>Xixi bit her lower lip and said with fear, “Shen, it’s too frightening. What if he is a bad guy or even a psychopath?</p><p>“What if he is a stalker?”</p><p>“Yeah…” Shen also got nervous. “It’s still daytime and there are so many people here. He can’t do anything abnormal, right…. Maybe he just admires you and wants to take a few more looks at you but is too much of a coward to approach you…”</p><p>Lou Cheng wanted to laugh and weep all at once upon hearing their conversation. How had he been discovered in such a short time and was even labeled a stalker…</p><p><em>What, me, an abnormal man? Are you joking?</em></p><p><em>No, that’s not the point. Are my trailing skills that terrible?</em></p><p><em>Er… Obviously the answer is yes. I have no trailing skills!</em></p><p><em>I have never trailed someone before, so I don’t know all the dos and don’ts…</em></p><p>Restraining the urge to cover his face and sigh, Lou Cheng unlocked his cellphone and sent a message to Ke while still following the two girls Xixi and Shen. After telling Ke what had happened just now and complaining to her, he clicked on the browser and typed several words in the search bar:</p><p>“Trailing skill…”</p><p><em>“Bah, it should be ‘following’ skill!”</em> Lou Cheng typed another word, wondering if the two girls would call the police.</p><p>On the other side, Xixi, who stopped and pretended to be selecting some goods, looked back quickly and then whispered in panic,</p><p>“He is still there, still there!”</p><p>“What should we do?” Shen was also nervous. “Should we call the police?”</p><p>“That won’t work, he hasn’t done anything yet… let’s finish eating and go back to the hotel quickly.” Xixi was flustered.</p><p>Shen shook her head with a serious look. “He’ll find out where we’re staying… Xixi, ask Brother Huang for help; he still owes us a meal. He said that he would accompany us, but we haven’t seen him yet.”</p><p>“Brother Huang…” Xixi was almost persuaded.</p><p>“Yeah, Brother Huang is a strong warrior, and he said he was good at fighting. It should be easy for him to scare that coward psychopath away. Bad guys deserve to be punished by fierce guys,” Shen said with great certainty.</p><p>She put on a smile. “Brother Huang admires you, I can see it in his eyes. He won’t pass up the chance to be a hero and save his beauty.You broke up with your boyfriend three months ago, right? Just give yourself another chance!”</p><p>“Well, I’ll ask him if he is free…” Xixi took out her cellphone and sent a long message to Huang Zhihua, whose phone number she got yesterday.</p><p>After several minutes, she smiled. “He told me to leave that guy to him, and we should meet at Yi’an Bridge.”</p><p>“Great, what a charming lady you are!” Shen turned to look at Lou Cheng, who pretended to be looking at his cellphone while still following them.</p><p><em>Well, now I have found the man in the black T-shirt, but I’m not happy…</em> Thinking about it, Lou Cheng sighed silently.</p><p>He decided to keep following the two girls and used another route to surpass them until they arrived at Yi’an Bridge, in case they changed the meeting point halfway.</p><p><em>I must learn some trailing skills on the way, for my opponent will be a Dan-stage warrior!</em></p><p>They went straight down the road, made two turns and continued heading straight. At this moment, Xixi gave her cellphone to Shen and said in a low voice, “You see…”</p><p>Shen took the cellphone in confusion and took a look at the message from brother Huang. “You two won’t find me on Yi’an Bridge, don’t be surprised. I’m hiding somewhere nearby in order not to scare that guy away. I’ll give him a good smacking!”</p><p>“Brother Huang is so…” Shen stopped talking, and then made a gesture to congratulate Xixi. She was looking forward to what would happen.</p><p>“Yes!” Xixi had the same feeling.</p><p><em>That abnormal guy deserves a good smacking!</em></p><p><em>Though he does all this out of adoration…</em></p><p>After walking for another ten minutes, they approached the street where Yi’an Bridge was located and thus slowed down their pace, waiting for Brother Huang to appear and catch the abnormal guy following them. That guy would be dragged into a nearby alley and get severely smashed — it couldn’t be done on the street, where there were too many witnesses to report it.</p><p>On the other side, Lou Cheng was about to surpass them. However, he got a sudden feeling that someone was staring at him. Looking aside, he saw the man in the black t-shirt appear from nowhere and run towards him!</p><p>Instead of taking action to dodge him, Lou Cheng stood still until that man approached him and stretched out one arm to grasp his shoulder. He heard the man laugh in anger.</p><p>“Let’s go somewhere else and have a talk.”</p><p>Feeling sorry that his trailing plans had been interrupted, Lou Cheng pretended to tremble at the man’s words and let himself be dragged into a dim alley without struggling.</p><p>“Yes!” Xixi and Shen yelled with great joy.</p><p><em>Brother Huang is so good!</em></p><p><em>That stalker is just like a child in front of Brother Huang!</em></p><p>They returned to the alley but dared not to look at what was happening inside it.</p><p>In the alley, the man in the black t-shirt released Lou Cheng, clenched his fists with great force, and gave Lou Cheng a fierce smile. “You are so brave! Since you are so daring as to follow the girls, do you dare to face my fist?”</p><p>At this moment, he saw the guy with black-framed glasses raise his hands to make a gesture with his fingers while pronouncing a word.</p><p>“Army!”</p><p>This… Huang Zhihua was stunned, feeling as if he was trapped in a battlefield with the smell of death filling his nose. No matter how he struggled, it was impossible to extricate himself from this horrible dream.</p><p>Giving the man no time to take action, Lou Cheng visualized an icebound river in his mind to adjust the wave propagation caused by his muscles, fascia, and organs. Then he changed the scene to a horrible one with thunder roaring in it.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lou Cheng punched his opponent with Severe Warning!</p><p>As soon as Huang Zihua extricated himself from the illusion created by the Army Formula, he was immediately shocked by Lou Cheng’s punch and lost all sensation.</p><p>There was only one thought in his mind:</p><p><em>“I’ve been settling all the difficulties in my martial arts life, so how come I’ve failed inexplicably this time… I’m all washed up…”</em></p><p>Plump! Lou Cheng again gave Huang Zihua, who couldn’t move both mentally and physically for the moment, a fierce punch, knocking him totally unconscious.</p><p>It was daylight, and that man would finally recognize Lou Cheng through his kungfu, so there was no need for Lou Cheng to disguise himself!</p><p>Glancing at the alley, Lou Cheng squatted down, found the man’s cellphone and unlocked it using the poor guy’s fingerprints one by one.</p><p>Looking through his WeChat records, he gradually got to understand the whole situation.</p><p>The man named Huang Zihua was a core member of the Zhengfa Sect, which was related to Daxing Temple.</p><p>Old Nanny Qiu’s disappearance was so weird that neither the police monitors nor security cameras had noticed it at all. As a result, they had to dig out relevant information from the old flames of Old Nanny Qiu, which proved inefficient.</p><p><em>So I haven’t fallen behind…</em> Lou Cheng put the cellphone back into Huang Zihua’s pocket and then pinched his philtrum to wake him up.</p><p>After doing all this, Lou Cheng kept walking out of the alley and into the crowd.</p><p>At the other end of the alley, Xixi and Shen, who had been waiting for a while, couldn’t help taking steps forward in curiosity. Soon, they saw the strong man in the black t-shirt lying near the wall, unconscious!</p><p>They were speechless for a while and then they let out a sharp cry. They couldn’t believe what was in front of their eyes.</p><p>What had happened just now?</p><p>Wasn’t Brother Huang punishing that guy? How come he got beaten up?</p><p>It’s so weird!</p><p>When Huang Zhihua heard the scream, he thoroughly regained consciousness.</p><p>The real scene in the valley relieved him of his fear. He knew that the martial arts expert didn’t intend to kill him.</p><p><em>Army Formula… a special skill that could freeze his mind… the sound of the Fighting Formula… so young…</em> As thoughts flashed across his mind one by one and connected in series, Huang Zihua finally recognized that plain face he had ignored before.</p><p><em>It’s him?</em></p><p>Huang Zhihua suddenly jumped up in astonishment. Ignoring the blank and frightened expressions on the girls’ faces, in a serious tone, he hurried to call his sect.</p><p>“Lou Cheng is here!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
