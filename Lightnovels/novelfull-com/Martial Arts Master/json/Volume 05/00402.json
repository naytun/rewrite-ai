Without hesitation, he counterattacked by bending back to raise his right arm like a seesaw, blocking Lin Que’s left fist when it was about to approach him.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>While Chen Diguo’s arm bounced off Lin Que’s fist, the latter swung back his left arm with the help of 24 Blizzard Strikes and Yin-yang Twist. Then he took a step with his right foot to change his direction and then threw his right fist toward Chen Diguo’s chest.</p><p>Chen Diguo, a top Professional Ninth Pin fighter, had already made his name before being accepted by Kongtong School and was now learning the Chen clan’s ancestral Taiji Pound. At this urgent moment, he again straightened his backbone and waist with the reaction that came from his right arm. Then he shook out his left fist under the inertia to block Lin Que’s attack.</p><p>Bang! In the dull thud, Chen Diguo had to quickly take a step back to keep balance after defending himself. However, what Chen Diguo had suffered up to now was only part of the Mega Avalanche. Withdrawing his fists and straightening his leg, Lin Que bounced to make a fierce and flexible kick at his opponent at a low height, giving Chen Diguo no chance to use Force Concentration. It seemed as if Lin Que wanted to defeat his opponent directly with an endless series of attacks.</p><p>In the continuous sounds of explosions, Chen Diguo struggled to block Lin Que’s Brutal Blizzard-like attacks and gradually lost his breath.</p><p>He neede to stop it, or Lin Que would gradually accumulate advantages and finally defeat him without much effort.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Raising his left arm in a hurry, Chen Diguo blocked Lin Que’s blast punch with great strength as if he was fighting against a great flood. While his body was still shaking, he swung his right wrist at a high speed to make a gust of boomerang-like fierce wind with the help of Storm Force, which flew directly toward Lin Que’s eyes.</p><p>Wrist Sword, the Chen clan’s special Kung Fu!</p><p>As a normal disciple in Kongtong School, Chen Diguo had no access to the top Kung Fu of the Wind Sect, which belonged to those direct core descendants. So his Storm Force was not as competitive as Lin Que’s movement, and it could not be promoted to a core force directly, like Lou Cheng’s Frost Force, either. As a result, Chen Diguo’s Stern Blade driven by his Storm Force was not as powerful as the same movement made by Ren Li.</p><p>Though Chen Diguo accepted that fact, he was not willing to accept the result, which drove him to study and practice Stern Blade every day. Under the guidance of Ren Li and all kinds of reference files, he succeeded in adapting the skills of Stern Blade to his own condition and thus created a special Kung Fu, Wrist Sword.</p><p>Though its effectiveness did not get any visible promotion, it could now be used quickly and secretly, which made it one of Chen Diguo’s trump cards. Now Chen Diguo wanted to break Lin Que’s series of attacks and fighting rhythm with it!</p><p>The reason why he had plenty of time to create new Kung Fu was that he was unable to increase his strength as fast as Lou Cheng and Lin Que, who were always learning, practicing, and advancing, having no spare time to think about anything else.</p><p>Hoot! Lin Que felt his eyes aching to warn him of the danger as the Wrist Sword approached him.</p><p>Though it could not really hurt him, it was enough for him to feel a constriction in his eyes, which could affect him a little bit, as if being slapped in his eyes by a child.</p><p>He was about to launch another attack and was thus unable to block it in time. So he immediately lowered his center of gravity and bent his head.</p><p>Chen Diguo’s actual purpose was to decelerate Lin Que’s attack! Swinging his Wrist Sword, Chen Diguo drove his Qi and blood back without hesitation as Lin Que’s Mega Avalanche paused. Then Chen Diguo made an explosion in his Dantian, which gave him the force to throw his left fist at Lin Que as a counterattack.</p><p>Lin Que was also an experienced fighter, so he knew he would immediately be at the mercy of Chen Diguo’s serial attacks if he chose to dodge the Wrist Sword. So he withdrew all of his Qi, blood, and force into his Dantian at the same time when he lowered his center of gravity and then punched at Chen Diguo’s pouncing figure without hesitation as if a meteor finally collided into the ground, or a volcano finally made a horrible eruption.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The muscles in their fists bulged slightly, and the blue tendons and vessels could be seen clearly. It seemed as if their fists were stuck to each other and frozen in mid-air.</p><p>In an instant, a strong wind arose, picking up the rubble that was on the ground.</p><p>Trying to keep their balance in that wave of Qi, the two in the ring both bent back while swinging their arms backward.</p><p>At that moment, Chen Diguo again gathered all of his strength in his Dantian to make a double explosion, which helped him to move his center of gravity and kick his right leg out.</p><p>He clearly knew that now that he had gotten an opportunity with the Wrist Sword, he must make as many explosions as possible in a short period and force Lin Que to take the same actions. Thus, he would drain Lin Que’s energy before he lost the match, and thus offer Chan, the last fighter in his team, a good opportunity to defeat Lin Que.</p><p>It could be seen from the previous matches that Lin Que had been advancing rapidly and that he might be able to make seven or eight explosions at his peak. Besides, Lin Que had learned the special Kung Fu of the Fighting Sect, which enabled him to be as powerful as a strong Seventh-Pin warrior. But Chen Diguo himself was also a tough fighter, even though he did not know much about the movements of the Wing Sect and was unable to get access to the top Kung Fu of his school. After all, Chen Diguo was an experienced Seventh-Pin fighter who could also make seven or eight explosions in a short time.</p><p>Lin Que must take Chen Diguo’s serial explosions seriously since they were made by a fighter who was at the same level of him. So he had to withdraw his Qi, blood, and the force gathered from the collision just now and make another explosion. Withdrawing his leg immediately, Lin Que blocked Chen Diguo’s kick and again a fierce wind arose.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Chen Diguo seized the opportunity to make a Triple Explosion and then a Quadruple Explosion with kneeing followed by elbowing at the same time, giving Lin Que no chance to counterattack.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Lin Que mixed the 24 Blizzard Strikes and Yin-yang Twist into his serial explosions of the Dan Stage to make a stiff resistance. With the help of the strength he borrowed from blocking Chen Diguo’s attack, Lin Que was even able to make his counterattack more fierce over time.</p><p>Though Chen Diguo had already known that Lin Que was good at fighting with borrowed strength, he had never expected Lin Que to attain perfection of it. When his Quadruple Explosion came to its end, Chen Diguo was frightened to notice that there was not enough strength left for him to restrain Lin Que!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Gathering all of his strength in his abdomen, Lin Que took advantage of the explosion to stretch his body and then punched toward Chen Diguo with great effort.</p><p>Gritting his teeth, Chen Diguo restrained and then set his Qi and blood free, making a Quintuple Explosion while blocking Lin Que’s attack directly with his left arm!</p><p>He had no choice but to do this, or Lin Que would have immediately beat the sh*t out of him. The well-designed scene that he had designed to trap Lin Que now turned out to be a cage for himself!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>His fist hit his arm and made an explosion sound. Chen Diguo felt his opponent’s surging force that he could no longer resist, so he began retreating at a high speed.</p><p>Focusing on Chen Diguo with his deep, black eyes, Lin Que withdrew his Qi and force without taking any actions to preserve his energy. Then he made an explosion with his surging force to tighten the muscles in his legs.</p><p>Taking this opportunity, Lin Que stepped heavily onto the ground with his right foot, doing a forward roll and creating an opportunity for himself to use Earth Cracking, a special movement of Unique Skill of the Fighting Sect, before Chen Diguo was able to drive his Storm Force!</p><p>A Sextuple Explosion!</p><p>Boom! The ring shook and cracked around Chen Diguo’s foothold, and then the surging force spouted from the break in the floor, which again made Chen Diguo lose his balance.</p><p>After borrowing the force from his stepping onto the ground, Lin Que straightened his knees to pounce forward at Chen Diguo. Then he stretched out his right hand, trying to grasp his opponent’s shoulder with five fingers, which was actually the last movement of the serial attack, Doomed Death.</p><p>When Lin Que was about to touch Chen Diguo’s shoulder, the latter drove his Qi and blood in time and then bent to narrowly dodge Lin Que’s grasping hand. Then Chen Diguo drove the force in his Dantian to swing his arm and grasp Lin Que in turn.</p><p>The 14th move of the Wind Sect, Tangle!</p><p>However, Lin Que’s Doomed Death was not as easy as Chen Diguo had hoped. When his grasping hand missed its target, Lin Que immediately took a step forward and bent to curl his arm, directly blocking Chen Diguo’s arm with his elbow. Now Chen Diguo could no longer gather strength since Lin Que had hit at his acupoints.</p><p>Lin Que defused an explosion of the Dan Stage with the most normal movement!</p><p>Then Lin Que turned sideways to smash himself into Chen Diguo like a falling meteor.</p><p>Out of Chen Diguo’s expectations, Lin Que’s Doomed Death was not only the last move of his attack, but the start of a new one!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Chen Diguo raised his arm to block Lin Que while continuing to retreat.</p><p>Lin Que slid to catch up with him and again stretched out his right arm to grasp him for another Doomed Death!</p><p>When Lin Que was about to grasp Chen Diguo’s shoulder, the latter took a quick breath, visualized wuthering wind in his mind, and then poured his force into every part of his body.</p><p>All his muscles were bulging as if they were filled with gas. Lin Que tried to close his fingers, but they immediately rebounded from Chen Diguo’s muscles.</p><p>How could the “wind” be caught?</p><p>Noticing this dilemma, Lin Que again turned sideways.</p><p>This time he used Force Concentration to stretch his body, and then again smashed himself toward Chen Diguo with greater force.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>Chen Diguo had just withdrawn his arm and put it in front of his chest when Lin Que’s fierce attack broke his stance. He immediately lost the feeling of flying in the sky, because he was unable to drive another flood of force to support his movement in time.</p><p>Lin Que’s attack was as impermeable as a tempestuous wave, and all the audience believed he would easily win this round. But Chen Diguo had been dodging and struggling without being caught by Lin Que, which tightened Lou Cheng and the others’ hearts even though they knew Chen Diguo had already reached his limit. In Lou Cheng and the audience’s eyes, Chen Diguo would immediately fly out of Lin Que’s attack range like a gust of wind once Lin Que made a small mistake, which would result in another round of fierce battling.</p><p>No wonder Chen Diguo was an experienced Seventh-Pin fighter!</p><p>At that moment, Lin Que pounced at Chen Diguo a third time, still trying to use the Doomed Death with his right arm.</p><p>On the other side, Chen Diguo, who had already lost his stance and balance, had no other choice but to bend and struggle to drive his Qi and force back.</p><p>However, Lin Que had learned from his previous mistake and immediately turned his grasping hand into a palm. Crack! He hit Chen Diguo on his shoulder with the help of his swinging elbow, which shocked Chen Diguo greatly and ruined his half-completed Force Concentration.</p><p>While Chen Diguo was still trembling, Lin Que finally grasped his shoulder, visualized a meteor flying across the sky in his mind, and then poured his force into Chen Diguo’s body, restraining the movements of his tendons and vessels and thus defused his resistance.</p><p>Curling his elbow, Lin Que jumped up with Chen Diguo and then smashed him onto the ground with great force.</p><p>The Fighting Sect’s 10th move, “Doomed Death”!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the flying rubble and dust, Chen Diguo lay on the ring, feeling dizzy and disoriented. His whole body was aching and he could not even move at the moment. Then he heard the referee’s loud voice.</p><p>“Round two, Lin Que wins!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
