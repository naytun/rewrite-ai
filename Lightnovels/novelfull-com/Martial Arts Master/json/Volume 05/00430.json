He crouched down and grabbed Yan Zheke’s left ankle.</p><p>As soon as his hand reached her smooth skin, he felt the shaking of her skin and muscles, her heart beating increasingly fast, and her body temperature rising. It was completely different from her previous reaction prior to the massage.</p><p>Dup! Dup! Dup…</p><p>Lou Cheng’s heart experienced a physical resonance to Yan Zheke’s every heartbeat, his mouth dry and body hot. Unconsciously, some expectations began to brew.</p><p>Without further contact or any flirtation, he felt his blood flooding down. His hands, however stable they were in battle, were shivering involuntarily as he pulled up her left foot. He took a deep breath and slowly loosened her shoelace and took off her shoe.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s heart beat even faster and Lou Cheng held his breath as if he was going to turn into a werewolf.</p><p>Dup! Dup! Dup…</p><p>Her beautiful foot was revealed in a see-through sock and Lou Cheng placed it against his knee. His hands began to massage, but soon the pinching motion changed to gentle strokes which became more and more intense.</p><p>“Hmm…” Finally, a long-suppressed sound slipped out of her throat, her lips pursed tightly.</p><p>It was the straw that broke the camel’s back, a call from his little fairy, and the firing of the starting gun. Lou Cheng suddenly lost control and lowered his head, moving up slowly and leaving a hot, exciting line on her body.</p><p>When he finally straightened his body and pinned the girl down on the bed, Yan Zheke had begun to respond, shy but just as intense.</p><p>“Pervert… Quit kissing me…” she complained in a very gentle tone while pushing her lips forward and sticking her tongue out to engage in Lou Cheng’s hungry kiss, feeling her cotton dress close to being torn apart under his rough movements.</p><p>Her pink jacket fell on the floor, followed by her white dress that was light like a cloud and Lou Cheng’s clothing.</p><p>“Turn off the light…” Yan Zheke shouted subconsciously between her heavy breaths.</p><p>However, this time, Lou Cheng didn’t listen to her. In the warm light, Lou Cheng kept the incredible beauty in his head in the manner of making a pilgrimage or a blasphemy.</p><p>He once again lowered his body and began to kiss her from her forehead, her palpitating eyelids, her long, thick, and gently trembling eyelashes, her ruby red ears, to her lovely nose tip…</p><p>In the opposite direction from earlier, Lou Cheng moved all the way down and Yan Zheke grabbed the sheet with both hands, tight or loose, her lips pursed closely, and once in a good a while an inviting sound slipping away.</p><p>Her brows suddenly knitted, face red and hot, and gritted teeth opened, letting out a long, soft whine from her throat.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s blood was boiling. He quickly removed their one last piece of clothing, her underwear hanging by her stockings at her ankle. They were finally completely naked in front of each other.</p><p>He pressed his body down, supporting his weight with both hands so Yan Zheke didn’t have to bear the entire heaviness.</p><p>He had been longing for this final physical and spiritual connection with Ke. Every time, he would advance aggressively and then quit with respect when she firmly demanded him to stop. At this very moment, he was passionately kissing, touching, and moving his hips, pretending this was all he planned to do.</p><p>All of a sudden, he felt surrounded by wetness and a slippery smoothness. His surging joy was soon replaced by an abrupt terror. He looked up at the girl, seeing the flush of her face, around her collarbones and further down, and tears in her sparkling eyes like stars.</p><p>She turned her head away and bit her lower lip hard, without knowing Lou Cheng’s further advance.</p><p>“Ke…” Lou Cheng called.</p><p>Upon hearing her boyfriend’s scorched, desirous voice, Yan Zheke’s eyelashes flapped quickly. She slowly closed her eyes and squeezed out a very quiet answer,</p><p>“Hmm…”</p><p>The heavenly hum made Lou Cheng more excited.</p><p>“I’ll… I’ll find us a condom…”</p><p><em>“Why didn’t I listen to Talker’s advice and keep one condom on me? There has to be one in a five-star hotel room. Well, I’ll receive some odd eyes during checkout, but nothing is more important than this now.”</em></p><p>Before Lou Cheng could get off the bed, Yan Zheke grabbed his wrist. Afraid of looking at his eyes, she tilted her head and said,</p><p>“No need…”</p><p>“Ahh?” Lou Cheng was stupefied.</p><p>“Grandpa… Grandpa said… Before you reach the Inhuman stage… It’s hard… Very hard for me to…” Yan Zheke was too shy to finish her sentence.</p><p>On her mind was a crazy idea. <em>“Grandpa said it would be hard for me to have children. I can’t get pregnant easily before Cheng reaches the Inhuman stage. Let’s give it a try. If it happens at such a low chance, it must be fate and I’ll stay.</em></p><p><em>“I want to be irrational once for Cheng…”</em></p><p>“That’s right.” Lou Cheng was not willing to part with this soft, warm body at all. He got back to the position and resumed his kisses and strokes, adjusting his movements while gazing at her tightening frown and increasingly red face. He advanced carefully and gently.</p><p>Inch by inch, he finally reached the end and felt their bodies become one. Yan Zheke suddenly straightened her waist and wrapped her arms around his neck, her lips close to his ear, her breaths fragrant and hot, and her cries bearing pain and affection.</p><p>“Cheng… Cheng… Cheng…”</p><p>There seemed no end in her voice, and Lou Cheng’s heart became friable. He felt the girl little by little melt into his marrow.</p><p>“Ke…” he responded in a very low voice, and completely lost control of himself.</p><p>Squeak… The very stable hotel bed started to make noises. A while later, a suppressed moan burst out like a heavenly note, followed closely by stronger squeaky noises and a satisfied male sigh.</p><p>They spoke out their love to comfort each other’s body and soul, and their whispering went on and on.</p><p>“You didn’t take a shower! Gross!” Abruptly, Yan Zheke let out a low scream and tapped Lou Cheng’s chest.</p><p>Lou Cheng returned a low chuckle, his heart extremely pleased and his body still burning.</p><p>“How could you!?” As Yan Zheke struggled to cross over him to get off the bed, she accidentally touched Lou Cheng’s weapon, up and ready.</p><p>“Cough… Considering my recovery ability and vigorous blood and qi, this is very normal…” Lou Cheng sounded rather proud of himself.</p><p>“Hmm…” Yan Zheke abandoned her plan to go to the bathroom and started to touch about aimlessly.</p><p>“Hey, stop! I can’t resist much longer!” Lou Cheng wanted to call it a night thinking about the pain his little fairy had just gone through, but the girl took the initiative to provoke.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s eyes were shining with a tempting glow, more inviting than before. She scolded in a very soft tone, “You are allowed to take advantage of me. Why can’t I take advantage of you? Stay still!”</p><p>Lou Cheng couldn’t bear her tease and turned around to pin her under his body.</p><p>The night was short and their love was intense. When Lou Cheng woke up at his usual hour, a faint fragrance flew under his nose and a tender body lied next to his. Everything was perfect like a dream.</p><p>Recalling their last night, a silly grin climbed on his face. His body and heart both felt content, his spirit complete and everything in this world beautiful.</p><p>He raised his head a little to look at Yan Zheke curled up like a baby in his arms, her innocent face with a faint pained expression, her dark hair, fine face, and her delicate, unforgettable skin. Feeling her tight hug and dependence, Lou Cheng knew his heart was melting in her fascinating cries of his name.</p><p><em>This is the connection of flesh and spirit…</em></p><p><em>This is the person I’m closest to…</em></p><p><em>This is the girl I will spend my entire life to protect…</em></p><p>He lowered his head to kiss her long eyelashes and rosy lips. His hands automatically began to move around and his morning passion turned fiercer.</p><p>“Hmm… No more…” Yan Zheke threw a punch at him in her sleep, turned around, and fell back asleep.</p><p>Lou Cheng struggled hard to get up, concerned about how upset and uneasy Ke would be if she woke up alone without him. He almost gave up on his morning exercises.</p><p><em>“Is this what Ke meant by ‘a good man caught in the long-lasting affection?”</em> He poked fun at himself before getting changed for his training. His body and mind were both very excited. He slept merely two hours last night, but he didn’t feel tired at all.</p><p><em>“People are in high spirits when involved in happy events.”</em></p><p>When Lou Cheng started to feel the Force Concentration after his basic training, he could tell his determination was firmer and no one and nothing could defeat him.</p><p><em>This is the life I’m going to defend!</em></p><p>The ice and fire twisted and embraced, pulling the most subtle responses from his body. The ghostly chill was flicking and the dark flame dancing. Lou Cheng’s heart finally caught the sign in the perfect satisfaction and grabbed the tip of every cell and every drop of his body that made up his body.</p><p><em>“This is the root pulp!”</em></p><p>He opened his eyes, very pleased. The grasp of the root pulp indicated his path to the Inhuman stage.</p><p><em>“This is not sufficient, but a necessary condition.”</em></p><p>Since the beginning of May, Lou Cheng’s physical quality had reached the top Professional Sixth Pin level after two months of training. He expected a long wait until the next big progress, but a night in bed with her had hardened his mind, polished his temper, boosted his spirit, and brought his will back. His performance had smoothly improved.</p><p><em>“Six more months till the new year. I have a good chance of opening that gate…”</em> thought Lou Cheng happily. He got out of the stance and returned without delay. Every second seemed too precious to waste.</p><p>The curtains were tightly shut and the room was dark and filled with a strange but arousing scent. Yan Zheke was deeply asleep, sucking on her finger with a bright smile on her face. Feeling peaceful and joyful, Lou Cheng quickly undressed and took a shower before diving into the bed and hugging his soft, fragrant little fairy for some more sleep.</p><p>When he woke up, Yan Zheke’s eyelashes flipped. She slowly opened her eyes and sank in his passionate kisses.</p><p>“Morning… No, good afternoon!” Lou Cheng chuckled, his elbow supporting his head.</p><p>Yan Zheke curved her eyes and brows and circled her arms around his neck with a sweet smile.</p><p>“Good afternoon, darling.”</p><p>She didn’t feel shy at all about this appellation.</p><p>As Lou Cheng was debating whether they should eat first or do something else, Yan Zheke pursed her lips, her eyes shining. She plucked up her courage and opened her mouth.</p><p>“Cheng, I have something to tell you… I… The training program of my department has shifted one year earlier…”</p><p>Her voice was not firm at all, full of hesitation and confusion, as if looking for an answer.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
