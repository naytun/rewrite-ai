Under what little light there was, he stuffed his hands in his pockets and looked around the place carefully. He took in the metal benches, the isolated bathroom, and the clean washroom.</p><p>Chen Diguo took two steps forward and stood before the lockers. With another key, he opened the one with his name on it.</p><p>His locker was cluttered with things, like shampoo bottles and backup razors.</p><p>He took them out one by one and stuffed them inside his backpack. His movements were slow, as if he was weighed down by something heavy. It took him nearly three minutes to finish cleaning out everything.</p><p>His lips stammered when he looked at the empty room. Using all his strength, he closed his locker shut and locked it again.</p><p>Instead of taking out the key, he allowed it to hang there. The key swayed, hitting the locker with a quiet clatter.</p><p>The corner of his mouth lifted when he gazed at the paper with his name on it. He turned away, eyes glistening. He pulled the paper off, smoothing and stroking it carefully before tucking it inside his wallet.</p><p>He strapped on his backpack, put away his wallet, and walked to the door.</p><p>Taking another step backward, he stared far into the distance. Ten seconds later, he grasped the door handle and closed the door of the locker room.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>With the faint sound of the locking door, Chen Diguo was lost in thought as if reflecting on his misdeeds.</p><p>Once again, he left the key on the door and toured the martial arts club carrying his backpack. He went to the strength-training gymnasium with its many equipment, the arena with its well-worn stone stairs, the five-row stands, and the field marked with all sorts of practice.</p><p>With each step as heavy as lead, Chen Diguo entered the Honor Room and came to the display case with the championship trophies belonging to the Capital College Martial Arts Club.</p><p>He held out a hand, feeling the cold glass against his fingers.</p><p>He withdrew his hand after a moment, turned around, and walked out. His backpack was not heavy, as if he had taken nothing away.</p><p>Chen Diguo looked around carefully before arriving at the door of the martial arts club at a snail’s pace.</p><p>He craned his neck to give the place another look and heaved a deep sigh. He forced a smile on his face.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The front door slowly closed and everything familiar gradually disappeared from his sight, leaving nothing behind.</p><p>The moon above was shining as usual. Chen Diguo turned around, his shadow stretching and swaying behind him.</p><p>Standing in the shadow outside the martial arts club office, the long-haired Ren Li and melancholic Shen You were looking on quietly. Neither said anything nor left the shadow.</p><p>Two sighs followed after a long silence.</p><p>…</p><p>On the same night, the long-haired Li Xiaoyuan was dressed in an elegant, vintage style. She was seated on the corner of a cafe, opposite an elder who was reclining on the couch.</p><p>“These are the conditions the Haiyuan Club had set out. Once you agree, you can immediately choose a martial art of the Dan stage from the martial arts suit, the Magnetism Sect, and the Plague Sect. They’re all incomplete, though,” the elder dressed in a dark-colored, old-fashioned martial arts suit said with a smile. “It’s true we’re not in the top professional games now, but you know, the Witch grows fast. This old man here still has a good five years in him. We’ll also be inviting other Mighty Ones with physical invulnerability and nurturing the potential backups in schools. Either way, we’ll join the top twenty before your graduation.”</p><p>Li Xiaoyuan took a sip of the black tea and nodded with a smile. “Sounds pretty good.”</p><p>“Intrigued?” The elderly raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“We can first draft a contract. When you have your formal contract and we make sure nothing’s out of place, then we have a deal,” Li Xiaoyuan said indifferently as if he was simply going the supermarket instead of making a decision critical to his martial arts career.</p><p>No! Even if one was going to the supermarket, one would still struggle with the choices! But Li Xiaoyuan was not struggling at all.</p><p>The elder looked surprised. “Are you not giving it a second thought or want to discuss it further? It’s a done deal?”</p><p>Li Xiaoyuan agreed so easily that he found it unbelievable!</p><p>“I have my reasons.” Li Xiaoyuan smiled.</p><p>“Do you have any special reasons?” the elder asked curiously.</p><p>Li Xiaoyuan took another sip of the black tea and said, “My father grew up watching your matches.”</p><p>“Ah…” The elder was stunned.</p><p>He thought to himself that Li Xiaoyuan was already over 20. That meant his father was likely in his forties. To hear that Li Xiaoyuan’s father grew up watching his matches did not sound like a compliment…</p><p>Just as the elder was lamenting this, Li Xiaoyuan chuckled.</p><p>“I’m just kidding…”</p><p>The elder was stunned speechless.</p><p>Li Xiaoyuan leaned back in his chair and said with a smile, “The real reason is that you’re the first one who officially sent me an invitation.”</p><p>“You’re not joking?” the elder asked doubtfully.</p><p>“Do I look like the sort of person who is constantly joking?” Li Xiaoyuan solemnly replied with a question of his own.</p><p>The elder pondered for a moment.</p><p>“Then let’s make a draft contract.”</p><p>…</p><p>Two days passed in a rush. It was too short a time for most fighters to see significant improvement.</p><p>On April 25th, the Capital City saw clear skies and white clouds. The temperature was just nice, not too high or low.</p><p>It was before sunset when Lou Cheng and his team left the hotel and boarded the bus. Everything was so bright and hopeful.</p><p>With the bus stopping and moving along with the traffic, it did not take them long before they arrived at the martial arts club of the capital. People were already gathered outside in groups of twos and threes, looking relaxed.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s phone vibrated just as they were about to get off the bus and her ringtone blared. It was Empress Dowager calling.</p><p>“Hey, Mom! Are you calling in advance to cheer me on?” Yan Zheke tried her best to sound light-hearted so her parents would not notice her nervousness about the upcoming match.</p><p>No matter how mentally strong one was, it was normal to feel nervous once they finally reached the finals after fighting in the tournament for an entire year.</p><p>Ji Mingyu chuckled. “We’re cheering you on by being present here. Your dad and I are waiting in a cafe and spotted your bus.”</p><p>“You’re here this early?” Yan Zheke blinked, glancing at Lou Cheng.</p><p>Lou Cheng coughed once and straightened his back. When he got off the bus, he looked particularly confident and at ease.</p><p>Keeping his posture straight, he turned and helped his girlfriend off the bus lest she stumbled while speaking on the phone.</p><p>The stress of the finals was finally surfacing!</p><p>…</p><p>The sky was gradually darkening and the number of spectators gathering outside was increasing. There were banners, cartoons, vuvuzelas, inflatable hammers, and songs going on verse after verse.</p><p>It was not a home match for Shanbei nor Songcheng. There were very few diehard fans, and most spectators only had slight inclinations toward one team or the other. Thus, they got along well with one another.</p><p>In the locker room of the Shanbei team, the members were preparing methodically for their match. No one was too excited or tense, as it was their third time in the finals.</p><p>The club manager, Xu Wannian, knocked at the metal bench when everything was ready. He grinned at them.</p><p>“I haven’t gone clubbing for a long time just for this final match.”</p><p>The blonde young man from a Nordic country laughed and replied in a strange accent, “Club Manager, don’t talk. Keep your mouth closed from now on. Don’t curse us!”</p><p>He was rather large and carried an air of confidence.</p><p>“Don’t you think you will be struck by lightning for saying that?” Xu Wannian said in faux anger.</p><p>“That’s enough. Wannian, you’re a fourth-year student with only a few months left in your university life. Put up a good show this time and leave no regrets,” the coach, Huang Qing, said.</p><p>Xu Wannian nodded and glanced at the silent Peng Leyun and Fang Zhirong. He shrugged his shoulders and got up, wrapping his fist in his hand.</p><p>“Then bid me farewell with a beautiful ending!”</p><p>…</p><p>In the locker room of the Songcheng team.</p><p>Geezer Shi looked and coughed twice.</p><p>“There’s no doubt we’re not good as Shanbei. But we didn’t come here to lose or serve the championship on a platter to them! Think about it. Our Songcheng has never had a national championship. The Honor Room is waiting for you to fill it!”</p><p>“There’s nothing to lose or fear. Just go for it!”</p><p>Lou Cheng glanced at Lin Que, who was burying his head without a word.</p><p>Ke had once told him that the best achievement their club had ever made was by Lin Que’s father, also his uncle. However, he was defeated in the finals and ended up as the runner-up.</p><p>Lin Que had given up the professional matches and applied to Songcheng University to compensate for this regret!</p><p>Now they, every one of them, would make up for that regret together!</p><p>…</p><p>In the studio, the giant screen was showing the footage of the recent matches Shanbei and Songcheng had participated in.</p><p>“Shanbei overcame Songcheng, coasting comfortably to a victory in the division matches.”</p><p>“It wasn’t only Lou Cheng and Lin Que who grew through hardships, the substitutes also improved by leaps and bounds.”</p><p>“The defending champion defeated their opponents in the group matches and advanced to the next round.”</p><p>“Though in the death team, Songcheng handled all their opponents with ease and even effortlessly defeated Huahai. Lou Cheng turned the tables at the last minute by beating Ann Chaoyang, showing the capabilities of the top Six Pin fighters. Lin Que won one-against two, not giving the opponent a chance.”</p><p>“They advanced to the quarterfinals without any turbulence.”</p><p>“In the semi-finals, Shanbei once again won against a strong opponent. The championship almost within grasp, Peng Leyun was deserving of the title Great Devil of the National Games.”</p><p>“Songcheng endured a ferocious fight and finally won against Capital after pushing their leading and substitutes players to the maximum.”</p><p>“Now they confront each other at the biggest of stages, ready to end all their past enmity once and for all.”</p><p>After the footage ended, the host, Liu Chang, appeared emotional.</p><p>“There’s actually no need to make a feature show or play up to its atmosphere. One word is good enough to describe this match.”</p><p>“What words?”</p><p>Liu Chang paused before speaking in a louder voice.</p><p>“Finals!”</p><p>Yes! The word “finals” comprised all the significance, passion, and anticipation in the competition.</p><p>The finals of the National University Martial Arts Games.</p><p>Shanbei versus Songcheng!</p><p>Peng Leyun versus Lou Cheng!</p><p>April 25th, 4:40 PM. The match was about to begin!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
