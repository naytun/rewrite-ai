Seeing this, Lou Cheng was somewhat frightened and couldn’t help trying to persuade his girlfriend.</p><p>“Ke, there’s no need to go that fast…”</p><p>She shot him a glance and eased the accelerator to slow the car. She smiled in embarrassment and said, “When I see other cars overtaking us and driving so quickly, I can’t help wanting to catch up to them. I think it’s no big deal driving a little faster. Aren’t they doing the same?”</p><p>Lou Cheng was stunned. He began to look around carefully, measuring every detail of his surroundings.</p><p>“What are you thinking about?” Wearing her white flats, Yan Zheke once again subconsciously pressed on the accelerator.</p><p>He replied with a complicated expression on his face, “I’m considering my options if there’s an accident: how will I gather strength, stop the car with my feet, and resist the collision.”</p><p>She eased her foot off the accelerator, not knowing what to say. When the car stopped at the crossroads, her voice carried both mirth and frustration as she asked, “Is my driving that bad? Except for the ignition part, I think the drive has been pretty smooth.”</p><p>“It’s not the matter of bad driving. Ke, your way of thinking isn’t right. You can’t keep wanting to overtake others and drive so fast. You should control yourself and the car, or you’ll suffer one day.” Lou Cheng was worried Ke might get into an accident when he wasn’t around some day. That was why he gave her a rare serious warning.</p><p>Yan Zheke pouted. “Okay, I’ll try my best.”</p><p>The light turned green and the car once again moved. Taking Lou Cheng’s suggestion, she drove smoothly and steadily this time. Even though she wanted to surpass the other cars occasionally, she managed to control herself in time.</p><p>“Where are we going?” It was only now that Lou Cheng relaxed and began enjoying the scenery of the skyscrapers and rivers of light outside.</p><p>Yan Zheke smiled, revealing her dimples, and said softly, “Elder Sister will show you the night market of Lin Ning. Later, we’ll go enjoy the breeze by the riverside.”</p><p>Lin Ning was the provincial capital of Jiangnan Province.</p><p>“Night market? What kind of night market?” Lou Cheng recalled the flea market he once saw in Xiushan.</p><p>“Hehe. You’ll know when you see it.” Yan Zheke cheerfully kept it a mystery.</p><p>They finally stopped at a lively street half an hour later after driving on erratically. Lit up with countless street lights, the street was as bright as it was daytime. Many pedestrians chatted as they thronged the three rows of simply-decorated shops.</p><p>Yan Zheke successfully parked the car with the help of the automated parking system, greatly satisfying her. She took Lou Cheng’s hand and pulled him into the night market. There were many cheap products for sale here, such as clothes and phone covers. There were plenty of delicacies to be tried as well.</p><p>Lou Cheng extended his left hand, putting it on his girlfriend’s shoulders. He pulled her close to him so she wouldn’t be touching any of the other night market shoppers.</p><p>The two thronged the night market, occasionally stopping at the stalls. Yan Zheke was enjoying the fun of bargaining. Though she didn’t think much of the goods, she wanted to experience life. She even criticized her boyfriend for never learning how to bargain. His conversation with the seller was always in this order: “How much?” “150.” “Can you make it cheaper?” “Nope.” “Okay. I’ll take it.”</p><p>After walking for a while longer, she took him to a roadside stall and ordered two chicken chops. As they waited for their food, she said,</p><p>“They started their business here and it’s now a national chain restaurant. But only the food here is still delicious.”</p><p>“Really? I think the rest of the chain restaurants are still pretty good…” Lou Cheng asked with interest.</p><p>“That’s because you’ve never eaten anything good in your life.” Yan Zheke shot him a ‘despising’ look and said pitifully, “Such a pitiful child. Let Elder Sister broaden your horizons!”</p><p>Their orders arrived midway through their conversation. They each grabbed one piece of chicken chop and began eating as they walked hand in hand. As they walked, they both felt like they were high schoolers on a date.</p><p>“Ah, you’re right! This is really better than the one in Songcheng!” Chewing on the tender flesh of the chicken chop, Lou Cheng praised the food and devoured half of it within seconds.</p><p>She looked up at him with a smug smile. “I told you so! You’re the one who didn’t believe me. Come, let’s take a photo.”</p><p>She took out her phone and made Lou Cheng lean into her. They both lifted their chicken chops and took a photo together.</p><p>She had never been the type of person who enjoyed taking photos. Yet, for some reason, she had begun recording all their interesting experiences together this way.</p><p>Snap!</p><p>Yan Zheke pursed her lips and tilted her head, putting on a pretty image. Lou Cheng remained indifferent and casual before suddenly chuckling. “Ke, didn’t you say you rarely eat at roadside stalls? Where did you hear about this chicken chop stall?”</p><p>“From my cousin! Sister Lingxi once took me here,” Yan Zheke replied, a sweet smile appearing on her face.</p><p>Lou Cheng nodded. “Sister Lingxi really knows how to enjoy life.”</p><p>Ji Lingxi was the eldest female in Yan Zheke’s generation within the Ji clan. She was four years older. Though born with abnormal strength, she didn’t like martial arts and chose to major in management. But she still reached Professional Ninth Pin in her first year in university and touched the threshold of the Dan stage in the second year after graduation.</p><p>She was a particularly playful person. She had dabbled in everything from skateboarding, surfing, singing, dancing, traveling, hiking, sailing, to collecting things. She was also interested in experiencing different local customs and exploring different food stalls and interesting shops. All in all, she was the kind who enjoyed both formal and casual life.</p><p>As they chatted and laughed, they walked from the chicken chop stall to the end of the night market. They tasted food from stall after stall, all recommended by the food expert Ji Lingxi.</p><p>They took a detour, finally returning to their car outside the night market. They drove to the riverside and took a walk in the breeze to help with their digestion.</p><p>Ning River was broad and rippled with jade blue water. The water vapor refreshed their skins and souls. Pulling Lou Cheng by hand, Yan Zheke balanced herself along the guardrail, staggering and giggling like a child.</p><p>Taking a look at her watch, she said with regret, “It’s pretty late. We should go back…”</p><p>“We can stay out tonight,” Lou Cheng said half-jokingly.</p><p>Yan Zheke rolled her eyes and replied in his tone, “Then my grandparents will chase you down through eight whole streets!”</p><p>“I’m trembling…” Lou Cheng joked.</p><p>It was his first time visiting his girlfriend’s family, and he was already abducting her away. Was he asking for a beating…</p><p>They went inside the car from both sides. Yan Zheke was about to fasten her seatbelt and start the engine when she felt a great force pulling her to Lou Cheng’s chest.</p><p>“You…” When she lifted her head, she met Lou Cheng’s burning eyes.</p><p>Considering the fact that they had shared a bed during the National Competition, Lou Cheng had long became deprived of his girlfriend’s affections after being under the careful watch of Yan Kai and Ji Mingyu.</p><p>It was easy to go from depravity to decadence, but difficult the other way around!</p><p>Yan Zheke closed her eyes and straightened her neck, cooperating with him.</p><p>Curled up on the passenger seat, she was almost sitting on his lap with their bodies pressed tightly together.</p><p>He had observed the surroundings earlier and knew no one was around. As he kissed her passionately, he began touching her. His hand gradually moved from her shoulder to her back and legs, and finally somewhere more private.</p><p>“Ke… Can this seat… be reclined…” Lou Cheng asked eagerly when his kiss fell next to her ear.</p><p>He couldn’t do anything in this posture!</p><p>“I-I don’t know… Look it up online…” Yan Zheke whispered vaguely, not knowing what she was actually saying.</p><p>Right now? He was unwilling to divert his attention at all, wanting nothing more than using his Force Concentration to knock the seat down.</p><p>Just then, her phone rang. The ringtone went on and on.</p><p>Yan Zheke pushed him aside, glaring at him with her glistening eyes and a red face. She bit her lips and took out her phone to answer the call.</p><p>“Sister Lingxi?”</p><p>“Oh, you’re back? Yeah, we’re outside. I took Cheng to the night market.”</p><p>“Okay. We’re about to go home.”</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled wryly as he helped her straighten her clothes.</p><p>“Hmph! It’s too dangerous to stay with you!” Yan Zheke returned to the driver’s seat and calmed herself. Her cheeks began flushing.</p><p>Lou Cheng adjusted his pants. “Hasn’t it been some time since we’ve been intimate?”</p><p>She glared at him, biting her lower lip. “Just wait until these few days are over. Either way, I’ll be on my period tomorrow.”</p><p>She burst out laughing.</p><p>“Got it… Well, where’s your aunt?” Lou Cheng changed the topic.</p><p>Having calmed herself down, Yan Zheke started the engine and answered, “She went to Shushan Study to take care of my brother.”</p><p>Their drive home was smooth without any accidents. 40 minutes later, they arrived at the old house of the Ji clan.</p><p>Having parked their car, they entered the front gate and overheard people talking incessantly.</p><p>“This is 300,000 yuan per gram… It has the aroma of herb… It can cure many diseases…”</p><p>“It’s just so-so. It’s not as good as your string of beads, Brother Li…”</p><p>“My beads are just made of ordinary materials, but an eminent monk from Daxing Temple blessed these beads and chanted scriptures in front of them for half a year… Remember my bad luck last year? My father laid down his pride and begged for this string of beads. It’s hard to say how much it truly costs…”</p><p>“That’s enough. Don’t brag about this each time you come. If you’re that great, get us a string of beads each…”</p><p>…</p><p>What was that… Lou Cheng was astonished. He completely didn’t comprehend the conversation earlier.</p><p>Yan Zheke glanced at him and said in a low voice, “Don’t worry about them. That’s the kind of nonsense they like playing with…”</p><p>She twisted the knob and pushed open the door. They saw two men and two women chatting in the living room.</p><p>Lou Cheng recognized Ji Lingxi at once without any need for introductions. The girl resembled Yan Zheke’s mother even more than Yan Zheke herself. Tall and graceful, her only flaw seemed to be her lackluster eyebrows.</p><p>“You’re back?” Ji Lingxi’s attire of white T-shirt, jeans, and heeled sandals showcased her perfect body shape. She stood up and greeted them with a smile. “Come, let me introduce you to Zhang Li, the young master of Jingdi Corporation. His father is very close to the eminent monks in Daxing Temple.”</p><p>Zhang Li’s skin was tanned with ordinary facial features. There was a string of brown beads wrapped around his wrist.</p><p>Ji Lingxi pointed at the other man, smiling. “This is Han Zhengcao. His mother is the chairman of our Provincial Martial Artist Association.”</p><p>Han Zhengcao was more handsome, but his dark circles were dark, indicating his lack of vigor. There was a green pendant in his hand.</p><p>Ji Lingxi turned to the girl with long, curly hair. “This is Guo Guo. Ke, you should know her. We dined together several times. Her father is now the sole person-in-charge of his company.”</p><p>She then pointed at Yan Zheke. “I don’t need to introduce her, do I? My cousin Yan Zheke. So many boys pursued her, but some other guy managed to get her… Ke, introduce him yourself.”</p><p>Yan Zheke looked at Lou Cheng and thought for a while. Her lips curved and she said, without any fanfare,</p><p>“This is Lou Cheng.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
