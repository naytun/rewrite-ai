The corner of Lou Cheng’s mouth twitched. He silently hung up the phone and then looked at the terrain around him. He then set out towards the entrance of the Linfu Building.</p><p>“Senior, they’re going to get in the car…” Zhang Xiaozi followed, hurriedly reminding him as she ran.</p><p>Lou Cheng didn’t look at her and calmly pressed down with his right hand, indicating that he didn’t want to talk.</p><p>Meanwhile, he dialed another number, Yan Zheke’s number.</p><p>After a brief ringtone, she quickly picked up as if she’d always been waiting, full of concern.</p><p>“Hey, Ke, my master is quite unreliable. The small thing he told me to take care of is actually big trouble.” Lou Cheng laughed bitterly.</p><p>Before, when he was en route, he had fully trusted his master. He’d regarded the trouble with Li Zhenhua and his disappearance at Linbian as an issue that was pressing but not dangerous. Even though he’d prepared his fighting equipment, it was just in case of the unexpected, a nonessential precaution. Therefore, he had spoken to Ke carefreely and happily.</p><p>After he had arrived, when Zhang Xiaozi had made everything clear and given him the whole story, he felt that his assignment was mainly to try and discover more clues and to pressure the local police department to do another search, which in a way suited his Dan Stage acuteness. Even if there may be a fight, he would be at most a subsidiary figure, and he’d just be getting in on some of the action in a nice and easy way.</p><p>Until the indication that Si Jianting was fleeing and his master had stated the line, he started to feel that the whole situation was becoming somewhat thorny and a bit dangerous, so he had to explain it to his girl.</p><p><em>The master is defrauding his disciple!</em></p><p>Putting her phone to her head, Yan Zheke’s breathing was made more serious by the clear and crisp sound of the phone signal. After a moment of silence, she said, “Can you please not do it?”</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled. “It’s about the life or death of a martial nephew. Ke, relax, I won’t fight if I’m not absolutely certain. Honestly speaking, I’m not his dad, his mother, or his master. I don’t have to put myself at risk for him.”</p><p>This sentence made Zhang Xiaozi’s face turn white and her legs nearly buckled.</p><p>He wouldn’t go all in unless he had absolute belief. Did that mean the situation would be hopeless?</p><p>Confronting two fearsome fighters, the five or six bodyguards with guns, and Si Jianting, who had been at the Ninth Pin level in his prime, and the at least Inhuman stage Senior still wanted absolute certainty. This was truly at a higher level!</p><p>“Exactly, he can’t compare with me!” Yan Zheke relaxed slightly, then full of concern randomly added, “Promise!”</p><p>“I promise.” Lou Cheng deeply and solemnly gave her this guarantee.</p><p>If Si Jianting didn’t get in the car and didn’t have a group of men under his control, and he confronted the two probably Seventh Pin Dan Stage Fighters and quite a few bodyguards with large caliber firearms on their person, then while he could seize a chance, it wasn’t worth taking the risk for some martial nephew that he didn’t know. After all, in case he got entangled with a master and their powers became intertwined, he wouldn’t be able to endure it.</p><p>It was like the time when he had gone to protect the Guo household. A Seventh Pin fugitive facing him, who at the time was at best a weak Eighth Pin, along with four armed guards. Upon finding out the truth then, he had wanted to back out and didn’t want to take a risk.</p><p>However, now that they’d gotten in the car, this was simple, as this was equivalent to a fighter entering an iron coffin. It was a restricted and narrow space and there was no way to move around. You wouldn’t be able to use even 50% of your full abilities, and furthermore, the gunmen were in the first car.</p><p>According to other masters who had not yet arrived at the Inhuman stage, you may not be able to seize this kind of opportunity. However, as someone with a supernatural ability, and also possibly a disciple able to release a formidable power earlier than expected, in his own eyes, they were just living targets.</p><p>“Okay.” Yan Zheke was reasonable and knew that she shouldn’t say much more, but she still couldn’t help adding a few words, pretending to be at ease as she said, “Give me a call in a while, I’ll be waiting.”</p><p>“No problem.” Lou Cheng grinned as he hung up the phone. He handed his phone and wallet to Zhang Xiaozi and said, “You, get further away.”</p><p>It was in his mind that the cell phone should be kept from being broken, for fear that he couldn’t give Yan Zheke a call if anything happened. His wallet even more so couldn’t receive any injuries, as it was a gift from his wife.</p><p>“Ok, ok, ok, be careful Senior.” Zhang Xiaozi’s heart was pleased as she took the items and set off quickly.</p><p>At 4:26, Si Jianting’s motorcade set off and drove towards the exit of the Linfu Building. Most of the bodyguards were in the first car, while he himself was in the second car. To his left and right were Vincent and Huang Chengda. The man sitting next to the driver was another bodyguard.</p><p>As the first car was turning into the wide and spacious main avenue, and the second was changing directions, Lou Cheng, who was quietly lying in wait on the opposite side, suddenly strode over in a burst of energy. He was like a roaring northern wind and made a few pedestrians’ hearts tremble. They instinctively fled to a distant place, wanting to keep far away from this place.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Lou Cheng stomped and his body arched down. His fists stretched forward with a shake, throwing out two scarlet-red blazes.</p><p>The two blazes flickered brilliantly, hiding their true brutality as they surged forth, leaving a scorched trail in their wake. They separated and charged towards the two cars, each one aimed at the oil tanks!</p><p>Crash!</p><p>Ear-piercing friction sharply rang out, dragging on for a long time. The front and back cars both frantically swung the steering wheels, attempting to avoid those terrible-looking flames.</p><p>Boom! The fireball that had been aimed at the front car with the bodyguards erupted. A wave of flames soared between it and the car behind, creating a partition between their lines of sight.</p><p>Bang! Lou Cheng’s muscles bulged and the cement cracked beneath his feet. He quickly seized his invulnerability and pounced towards Si Jianting in the black limousine!</p><p>Leaning on the peak physical qualities of his Sixth Pin status, he forced his footwork to push into a different level, coming to Ascension to Heaven’s Stars!</p><p>Of course, while this was equivalent to Qiu Lin’s level, it couldn’t compare with Peng Leyun and more so with Ren Li.</p><p>“Don’t stop!” the experienced and dark-skinned Vincent shouted as the “fireball” attacked, using the unfamiliar-to-him Chinese language.</p><p>However, he was unable to prevent human instinct, and the driver had already braked and turned the car, creating a screeching sound as the tires changed their trajectory.</p><p>At this moment, Vincent felt a stab of pain in his side, and his hair stood on end as he felt danger approaching.</p><p>Without thinking, he immediately drew in his strength and threw out his elbow with all of his might, hitting the car door.</p><p>Bang! Both connecting sides of the car door momentarily split open and changed into a kind of steel shield, flying towards the outside.</p><p>From Vincent’s point of view, this could give his opponent a hard time and also help him separate himself from the car at this critical moment. If he was stifled in this narrow space, it’d be very difficult to use his boxing skills fully!</p><p>However, Lou Cheng’s reaction speed was faster than his, surpassing what he had imagined. As the car door’s connections had split open, he’d already leaned in close. His waist lowered and shook, his Qi and Blood contracted and released, and his left arm momentarily enlarged as his palm pressed down on top of the door.</p><p>Bang! On the eve of flying forward, the car door was rigidly pressed down and caved in as it twisted in shape, exposing the wires, components, and other parts inside. It smashed in the opposite direction and into Vincent’s body, causing sharp pain and vertigo.</p><p>At that moment, Si Jianting, who had experienced these kinds of situations many times before, had keenly shrunk back to give himself space. He had already pulled the gun from Huang Chengda’s hand and shot towards the deformed car door.</p><p>Bang! As soon as he had attempted to pull the trigger, Lou Cheng had perceived it. He straightened his back and moved his legs backward, promptly freeing himself and landing on the roof in a flash. He dodged the bullets that had been fired. Additionally, the car had still not stopped and the bodyguards had not gotten out. Their line of sight was also obscured by the wave of fire. The passing traffic noticed that something was wrong, and they had promptly responded accordingly.</p><p>Due to the location that Lou Cheng had chosen, they weren’t too disturbed, to the point where some people wanted to stop their cars and enjoy the bustling scene.</p><p>Bang! Lou Cheng’s wrist trembled again and the scarlet red fireballs changed shape, hurtling towards the roof at Huang Chengda’s position, provoking a reaction from him. The fireball hurtled towards the sky like a bird, and it exploded with a bang.</p><p>Seizing this opportunity, just as the bodyguard next to the driver reacted and began to come over, Lou Cheng pulled back and once again fell to the ground. Without delay, his left hand sent out a sparkling snow-white ray of freezing light, landing right in the middle of the confused and disoriented Vincent’s head, who didn’t have time to react or dodge.</p><p>With a gasp, the outside of Vincent’s head became congealed with a layer of ice crystals and thick frost, temporarily losing all feeling.</p><p>Staggering his feet, Lou Cheng scrambled towards the back of the car, avoiding the gunfire from Huang Chengda and the bodyguards from the front seat. His body straightened, his hands interlocked, and his muscles bulged out in the wake of the power of his Dan.</p><p>Crack! Lou Cheng’s eyes opened furiously, and his feet extended out like spiders webs. His arms lifted and rocked, and with an unrivaled power like moving a mountain, he flipped the black limousine on its side!</p><p>Bang! Crash! As Huang Chengda and the bodyguards in the front seat twisted and turned, they were unable to aim at their target, and their bullets landed in the flower terrace beside them.</p><p>While they were somewhat panicked and lacking the ability to shift places, Lou Cheng shook like a demon, arriving at Huang Chengda’s car door. He kept away from directly facing the door, and by using both of his hands, shattered the deformed cracks. He gravely opened his mouth and said,</p><p>“Army!”</p><p>As the vehicle twisted, Huang Chengda was aware of the danger, and he prepared to fire indiscriminately to the left and right, forcing the enemy to retreat. Afterwards, he took Si Jianting and removed him from the car, drawing him closer to the other bodyguards. However, his mind was still buzzing and humming, as if he was in a nightmare from his childhood. For a moment, he unexpectedly shivered in fear, unable to have any other kind of response.</p><p>Just then, the snow-white ray of freezing light flew in through the crack, smashed into his face, and similarly congealed into a thick frost, making him lose all feeling.</p><p>The effect of Ice Burning to the head was not much more than a Severe Warning, but it still packed enough of a punch to make one dizzy!</p><p>Bang! Lou Cheng used his force, pulling off the door, but he didn’t go inside.</p><p>Bang! With a sinister look on his face, Si Jianting opened fire, but the bullets hit empty air.</p><p>Over by the other car, the bodyguards charged out. Some carried guns and others had knives.</p><p>Bang, bang, bang! At the sound of Si Jianting’s gunfire, Lou Cheng used his invulnerability and landed by Vincent’s car door with one jump. Both of his hands shook, and he threw an Ice Burning cold light towards the bodyguards from the front seat, who were dismayed and attempting to fire, as well as the unaware Si Jianting.</p><p>With two gasps, just the two Ninth Pins were covered in white frost, temporarily becoming ice sculptures.</p><p>Lou Cheng stooped his body and first set out for Vincent. Regarding him as a weapon, he threw him at the other tightly packed bodyguards, making them either dodge or become bowling pins.</p><p>Immediately afterward, he grasped once again, pulling out Si Jianting and displaying him all around for a moment.</p><p>Suddenly, the bodyguards ceased their efforts and didn’t dare make a move again.</p><p>Lou Cheng pressed his hand towards Si Jianting, who was still shivering with cold and had not fully regained consciousness. With a peaceful and calm tone of voice, he said to the bodyguards, “Are all of you are still here? You’ve all got weapons on you and just had a firefight in the middle of the street. The police are going to be here any moment.”</p><p>These words made all of the bodyguards come back to their senses. Seeing that their boss had already been captured, they had no way to reverse the situation. They all stared at each other and immediately scattered like birds, making their getaway. All that remained were Vincent, Huang Chengda, and the bodyguards from the front seat who had still not recovered.</p><p>Recalling the image he had in his mind of the classic villains, Lou Cheng reached out his hand and helped the gradually-coming-his-senses Si Jianting by patting away the frost on his neckline. He said with a smile,</p><p>“Boss Si, can you have a nice chat with our Ice God Sect right now?”</p><p>On the opposite side of the street, Zhang Xiaozi looked at the time on her cellphone in bewilderment.</p><p>4:28.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
