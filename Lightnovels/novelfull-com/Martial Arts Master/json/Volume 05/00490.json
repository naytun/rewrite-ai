If the opponent was struck directly on their body, even if they exerted strength to resist, they would most likely suffer injuries to the tendons and channels, muscles tears and even bone cracks and other injuries. Therefore when she duelled with Veigar, Veigar had to constantly cover his fist with the power of electricity to form a glove so as to crush the faint light before the contest of power.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s “Ice Armour” was more suitable for such battles than “Electric Glove” as it could effectively numb the sharpness and force of the slash strikes. The “Fire Fist” formed from “Emperor Yan Force” was similar to “Electric Glove” as it could burn away the white ray and counterattack on his opponents, combining defense with attacking!</p><p>If he didn’t have these two supernatural abilities, he would have been more careful and would only defend against non “blade’s edge” position. For example, hitting from the bottom up, hitting the wrist from the sides and breaking the forms of Kaori Karasawa. Although that would make him seem more like a grandmaster, he would also be in a more passive position. If he was careless for the slightest, he would have suffered injuries and be forced to leave the competition.</p><p>Explosions sounded from time to time, sparks were sputtering and ice crystals were falling. Lou Cheng using his powers that had almost mutated to become innate, had a particularly intense battle against Kaori Karasawa. Sounds of clashes resonated in the surrounding and incited the enthusiasm in the majority of the audience and ignited their urge to release their emotions.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s power, speed and agility were much inferior to his opponent. However when his body qualities improved, the differences were no longer that huge. As long as he could continue to maintain his patience and defend steadily, Kaori Karasawa would not attempt anything risky. This was because it would be hard to break his form in a hurry and find the opportunity to victory. Moreover, once she committed to taking such a risk, her weaknesses would also start to show in response, giving Lou Cheng an opportunity to turn the tables around.</p><p>Bam bam bam, bang bang bang!</p><p>The battle was stuck in a deadlock and the situation was stale. Lou Cheng, who was at a disadvantage, was defending patiently as he fully utilised the Dan Stage kungfu within his body. As for Kaori Karasawa who had the upper hand, she was equally steady. It was as though she wanted to devour her opponent little by little.</p><p>A full seven to eight minutes had passed. The two of them inevitably exhausted substantial stamina. However Lou Cheng had auto-replenishment from the Jindan. Excluding the slowdown in reaction time caused by mental fatigue, other aspects of him had not shown any deterioration. This formed a stark contrast to Kaori Karasawa. There were signs that Lou Cheng was slowly turning the tables around.</p><p>At this moment, Kaori Karasawa used her right arm, which was glowing in faint light, as a long sword and swept across horizontally. As it contacted with the arm of Lou Cheng that was covered in Ice Armour, she exerted more force from the shoulder, let the attack spin on it and wrapped around the arm of her opponent.</p><p>In an instant, there seemed to be sharp blades colliding. Lou Cheng’s arm was hit back, body was shaken and seemed to be falling towards the side.</p><p>Now is the time! Light condensed in the gaze of Kaori Karasawa as she catapulted her body.</p><p>As for Lou Cheng, an extreme dangerous premonition flashed pass his mind. Tweaking his ears a little, he seemed to have heard a barely audible ‘Kacha’ sound. It was just like loading a sniper rifle or the turning of the barrel of a machine gun!</p><p>Facing such a situation where his centre of gravity was to one side and couldn’t jump up in time, if he was to squat down or lean back to avoid the attack, with the experience of the previous two times, Kaori Karasawa would definitely sent a slash strike or slashed down rapidly and not giving him a chance of surviving.</p><p>Other than following the momentum and fell to the side, abandoning his form and rolled on the floor, Lou Cheng didn’t seem to have any other options!</p><p>Nonetheless, he was prepared. When the “Kacha” sound was heard, he traced out a dark and chilling “Ice Spirit” space, that was without any traces of light or heat.</p><p>When the danger premonition struck him, layers after layers of thunderclouds immediately gathered, resulting in high temperature and a loud explosion that broke the darkness and chill!</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Lou Cheng lowered his left arm, expanded his elbows, shifted his forearm, followed the ripples from the Ice Mirror and threw out a punch from his waist level.</p><p>The original version of “Severe Warning”!</p><p>The reason why he had chosen this move was because he could add layers after layers of thick “Ice Armour” to it. Otherwise, with the terrifying strength displayed by the “Flying Dragon Takedown”, even if he hit his opponent and froze her thoughts, his left arm would also most likely be crippled. Without a month or two of rest, he would also likely not recover from the injuries!</p><p>As the fist that was enveloped in shimmering crystal was thrown out, a flash of light suddenly appeared and reached the surface of Lou Cheng’s fist instantly. The attack collided head on and didn’t give Lou Cheng a chance to react at all.</p><p>After that light had passed, the surrounding air was split into two paths and formed an airwave. There wasn’t any gathering of faint light but the air was dyed white lias though a fighter jet had roared past!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The loud explosion caused a violent “Wind Wave” and blew towards Lou Cheng. At the same time, it was shaking Lou Cheng’s ear drums.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Lou Cheng could not hear the cracking of the thick “Ice Armour” on his left fist but clearly felt the terrifying strength exerted on him. It was as though he was struck by a high speed train. His arm went numb and he lost his senses. His muscles were expanding and cracking and his tendons were in excruciating stinging pain.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>He couldn’t stop and was knocked back, creating two obvious trails as his legs rubbed against the floor!</p><p>Pfft! With a dizzy brain and his ears ringing, Lou Cheng spat out a mouth of fresh blood. His left arm was shaking and couldn’t exert strength for the short while. On the surface of his fist, there was also a wound so deep that one could see the white of his bones.</p><p>The might of one slash astonished the world!</p><p>“The fearsomeness of “Flying Dragon Takedown” is really not exaggerated!”</p><p>In the live thread, the reaction of everyone was even more exaggerated. Almost at the same moment, they exclaimed,</p><p>“Oh damn, he withstood the “Flying Dragon Takedown”!”</p><p>“I, Zhao Ritian, am completely impressed…”</p><p>“He actually took the “Flying Dragon Takedown” head-on and even withstood it!”</p><p>“That’s freaking incredible.”</p><p>“The Sky Shaking Roar, no problem!”</p><p>In several large forums in Japan, there were similar shock,</p><p>“He foresaw the “Flying Dragon Takedown”?”</p><p>“Using his body to foresee and withstand the “Flying Dragon Takedown” forcefully? I think I have seen a monster beast…”</p><p>“No, that is Ultraman!”</p><p>“This is the first time anyone withstood Kaori-chan’s “Flying Dragon Takedown” right?</p><p>“Although she didn’t have a knife with her, one could die from taking Kaori-chan’s “Flying Dragon Takedown” directly with his body. Even if he is a monster that had mastered “Qi”, he will also suffer grave injuries that can only be recovered from after months. He’s is so daring to block it directly…”</p><p>…</p><p>In the tumultuous airwave, Kaori Karasawa was standing at her original position. Her left arm was shaking incessantly as she was covered in a layer of frost. Her beautiful eyes lost vitality and had the feeling of being in a daze.</p><p>“Severe Warning”, greetings to Xinzhai!</p><p>Lou Cheng had no time to check on himself. He endured the injuries, took a huge breath, executed a Force Concentration, and forced them together with the various uncomfortable feelings with the balance of ice and fire.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Dan Qi was gushing out and Lou Cheng’s legs expanded. Bending his knees and extending them subsequently, he leapt out and pounced towards his opponent, whose clothes had become short-sleeves.</p><p>Crack! Blood and sweat that had dripped down could only be found on the spider web-like cracks on the floor where he leapt from and right in front of Kaori Karasawa. This went to prove that speed of this leap and the ferociousness of this pounce!</p><p>Bam!</p><p>The skin and muscles on the surface of the left fist of Lou Cheng constricted and the bleeding stopped. Shaking his right arm, he clenched his fist tightly and hammered down in a diagonal direction.</p><p>Shoosh! A layer of scorching flames enveloped his fist.</p><p>“Emperor Yan Force”!</p><p>To grab hold of this opportunity, Lou Cheng didn’t prepare to use the “Fighting” Formula, “Army” Formula, or simplified physical invulnerability move!</p><p>At this moment, the eyes of Kaori Karasawa were still in a little daze. The otakus in Japan who were watching were all aching in the heart. Nonetheless, her body naturally reacted. Her right arm retracted and drew a razor-like white ray, hitting the raging flames head-on.</p><p>“Mind Reader”!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The force exploded and flames were raging. The black hair of Kaori Karasawa was messy in the air as her body was pushed away forcefully from the shockwave and she staggered back.</p><p>It was only till then that vitality returned to her gaze!</p><p>Lou Cheng was swinging his right armed but retracted it back quickly. Following the momentum, he formed seals in front of his body and directed at himself.</p><p>His expression was serious and started tracing the word in his mind. After which, he growled in a low voice,</p><p>“Fighting!”</p><p>Muscles expanded and displayed the beauty of power. As they contracted, large and small veins were protruding. As Lou Cheng wriggled his waist and back, he threw a punch in an extremely barbaric condition.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>His punch split the space and brought his body flying forward, instantly devouring the distance between the two of them and reaching the abdomen of Kaori Karasawa.</p><p>Kaori Karasawa relaxed her mind and seemed to have returned to that quiet and peaceful zen hall. She was back to the time she was focused in flower arranging and making tea. At this moment, faint flight circulated within her eyes. Her clothes instantly expanded and she looked just like an inflated balloon.</p><p>Bam! Using her left palm as a blade, she reversed slashed across. Her clothes suddenly constricted and stuck closely t her body.</p><p>Xinzhai Sect, “Kasaya Takedown”!</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Small muscles became distinct and dull green veins were all around. This formed a stark contrast against the fair and white palm and the shimmering faint light!</p><p>The “Fighting” Formula was extremely violent. In an instance, Kaori Karasawa was staggering backwards from defending against the attacks. Although her body was light, her steps were heavy as she made several footprints on the floor. As for Lou Cheng, he shook his body and retracted his blood flow and breathing instantly. Releasing the Dan Force, he pounced ahead again, not leaving any room or breaks!</p><p>Seeing that she had not stabilized herself and her opponent was approaching, a faint “Kacha” sound emanated from the body of Kaori Karasawa, It was more obvious than “Flying Dragon Takedown” but it also ended quicker.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>She drew her right arm across her body, swinging her fist diagonally at a speed that left after images. Faint light was left behind and the airflow was split.</p><p>The weaker version of “Flying Dragon Takedown”, “Flying Bird Takedown”!</p><p>The preparations before the strikes were faster but the speed was relatively weaker substantially. It was the same for its might!</p><p>However Kaori Karasawa had combined it to become a terrifying killer move. Using this to complete an explosive barrage of attacks in a short amount of time, she was able to defeat Veigar with this killer move.</p><p>That killer move was the consecutive strikes of “Flying Bird Takedown”, “Triple Aerial Ace”!</p><p>Lou Cheng knew clearly that this was the crucial moment. He stopped his momentum of pouncing forward suddenly, expanded his right arm, shifting them rapidly and threw out a punch.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>The fist met the palm strike as explosion sounded in the air. Lou Cheng was making use of the recoil to gather himself when he heard a “Kacha” sound. At the same time, he saw the left arm of Kaori Karasawa slashed out tightly. It was equally fast, equally ruthless and was also covered in a white light!</p><p>Bam! He forcefully exploded the force in his left shoulder, swung his arm and was finally able to open his five fingers on the left arm, which has lost sense and strength previously, to grab towards the enemy’s palm blade.</p><p>“Triple Aerial Ace”!</p><p>Lou Cheng could no longer execute “Force Concentration” in time and could only rely on his “Ice Mirror” to sense. He lifted his arms up to block in a hurry.</p><p>Bam! His hands shook and bounced away to the sides. The Ice Armour was breaking apart and his tendons were injured. Yet, some happiness was rising from his heart.</p><p>He had withstood the “Triple Aerial Ace” from Kaori Karasawa!</p><p>These consecutive strikes definitely exhausted her greatly and the toll on her must have been huge. The momentum of the match should be shifting from here on right?</p><p>At this moment, a painful expression was showing on Kaori Karasawa’s face. Her left palm which was grabbed by Lou Cheng suddenly bounced up. Following a “Kacha” sound, it split the air barrier at a speed that left after images.</p><p>Forbidden move of Xinzhai Sect, “Quadruple Aerial Ace”!</p><p>Although Lou Cheng’s “Ice Mirror” reflected it, his reaction couldn’t keep up. Just as he raised his left arm, the palm of his opponent had already stopped at the front of his throat.</p><p>The referee revealed gazes of compliments, raised his hand and announced,</p><p>“Kaori Karasawa wins!”</p><p>Lou Cheng heaved a sigh of foul gas and felt a million different feelings in his heart. As for Kaori Karasawa, she was bending down and panting profusely. She had completely forgotten the etiquette that Japan paid a lot of attention to.</p><p>“Quadruple Aerial Ace” wasn’t a move that was easy to withstand. It was so for the enemy and the same for her body!</p><p>The researcher of Japan’s representative group, Masane Otake, was extremely excited at the sight of the blood on the stage. He was anxious to pounce forward to collect them.</p><p>Kaori-chan, Kaori chan, go and step on it and leave some on your shoes!</p><p>After Kaori Karasawa recovered, Lou Cheng bowed at her in respect before shaking his head and walked towards the stone steps.</p><p>On his way down, he suddenly recalled the instructions of the guide to not leave any blood or sweat. Therefore he made a turnaround. When he walked down the stone steps with his back facing, all the blood and sweat on the floor ignited. The smile on the Masane Otake froze on his face.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
