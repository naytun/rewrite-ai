As she frequently met with Gu Shuang, Song Li, and Xing Jingjing, Lou Cheng realized the matter they’d rather not talk about had become impossible to ignore.</p><p>The heaviness began to develop between them. However confident and well prepared they were, the unknown and the long distance were still terrifying for this young couple at the age of 19 and 20.</p><p>Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke were reluctant to part. They spent every possible moment with each other but still couldn’t get enough of each other. They attempted to soothe the mental suppression with the extreme physical pleasure.</p><p>About their meeting up often and spending time together alone, Lou Zhisheng and Qi Fang seemed pleased with it, while Yan Kai and Ji Mingyu turned a blind eye to it.</p><p>However, their passionate lovemaking couldn’t freeze time. Soon came the day she had to leave.</p><p>August 5th, Gaofen Airport before the security check.</p><p>Yan Kai and Ji Mingyu moved a few steps away to give them some privacy.</p><p>Yan Zheke pursed her lips tightly, locked her clear eyes on Lou Cheng, and fixed his collar out of habit. She then put on her soft voice.</p><p>“Cheng, don’t worry. Empress Dowager has decided to stay with me until September to help me adapt myself to the new environment.</p><p>“America is not the safest country, but dangers mostly take place in certain areas. I have no plans to go about, so it won’t be a problem. Also, Empress Dowager has hired a Dan stage master from the Shushan Study to protect me over there. Her husband died young and her son is in college. She has loads of free time and is a great cook.</p><p>“I’ll spend my two long holidays back here. You must make yourself available for me, okay?”</p><p>“I promise!” Lou Cheng forced a smile.</p><p>Yan Zheke finished slowly and her eyes on Lou Cheng became soft and tender, full of affection and sorrow.</p><p>“Take care of yourself when I’m not here. Go out to have a nice meal with Talker now and then. Don’t just get by in the cafeteria.</p><p>“Don’t be completely careless about your clothing. Collocate well before putting them on. Ask me or Talker if you are unsure. You are a famous martial artist now. You are one of the favored fighters of the age. The public image is important…”</p><p>Her eyes were red and her voice was disturbed by sobs.</p><p>Lou Cheng took a deep breath and promised in a deep, mature tone,</p><p>“Yes. I’ll book my flight over once Empress Dowager decides her date for coming back.”</p><p>The Ice God Sect had promised to take care of his passport and visa. All he needed was to show up.</p><p>“Hmm. Reply to my messages every day and talk with me!” Yan Zheke put on a bitter smile and waved. “It’s getting late. I better go.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Lou Cheng struggled to wave his hand, watching her turn around and step to Yan Kai and Ji Mingyu.</p><p>After two steps, she abruptly turned around and waved at Lou Cheng again.</p><p>Lou Cheng responded with nod.</p><p>Yan Zheke and her parents advanced towards the security check.</p><p>A few steps later, she looked back and locked her eyes with Lou Cheng’s for a few seconds.</p><p>She looked back seven if not eight times during such a short distance.</p><p>After the final long gaze, she forced a smile and waved once again, calling silently with her lips,</p><p>“See you in September…”</p><p>She turned around and strode forth to join Yan Kai and Ji Mingyu to the right. Her figure in a chiffon top, jeans, and white shoes disappeared in front of Lou Cheng gradually.</p><p>Intense feelings surged inside Lou Cheng. He ran forward without knowing and caught the beautiful back of Yan Zheke until she completely walked out of his vision.</p><p>He opened his mouth but didn’t let out any sound in the end, feeling lost.</p><p>His little fairy was nowhere in his sight.</p><p>…</p><p>Walking behind her parents, Yan Zheke moved slowly with a small suitcase. She turned around once again subconsciously in hopes of seeing that familiar, adorable figure one more time but in her sight were just strange faces.</p><p>Her heart was empty, so was her mind. She suddenly turned around and ran towards the entrance in search of him.</p><p>“Ke?” Yan Kai’s voice stopped her steps.</p><p>She threw one more glance at the entrance and then rejoined her parents, biting her bottom lip gently.</p><p>Yan Kai and Ji Mingyu exchanged a look with a silent sigh and didn’t say anything.</p><p>After the security check, they headed towards the first class lounge. Yan Zheke remained silent and grabbed the hand next to her out of habit.</p><p>Instead of the thickness and warmth she had expected, it was a cold, slim palm in her hand.</p><p>She turned her head and saw Empress Dowager’s hand in hers.</p><p>She wanted to grab her arm with the other hand to make it natural and less awkward but her other hand was occupied by a suitcase.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s vision was blurred by a thin layer of tears and she turned her head to the side, her eyes red.</p><p>Ji Mingyu was once like this herself. She sensed the mood change in her daughter and tapped her hand gently with a smile.</p><p>“Should have let Lou accompany you to the States. We are not good enough?”</p><p>“No!” Yan Zheke wrapped up all her feelings and emotions like always. She refused to shed tears of sorrow.</p><p>Yan Kai with one backpack and two small suitcases stood there and watched them quietly.</p><p>Ji Mingyu grabbed one suitcase and entered the lounge with her husband and daughter.</p><p>She poured a glass of juice for Yan Zheke and sat down next to her with a caring smile.</p><p>“I think sweetness can soothe emotions.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Yan Zheke took a sip, the sweet and sour taste stimulating her spirit.</p><p>Ji Mingyu put on a very gentle tone,</p><p>“I’ve been concerned about you making silly decisions. I guess I’ve thought too much. You are my good daughter. As Lou has promised, you will see each other in just over one month. Don’t be upset.”</p><p>Silly decisions… Yan Zheke lost in her mother’s words and a wry smile climbed on her face.</p><p><em>“I did make silly decisions…</em></p><p><em>“I’m so not ready to have my own child or to be a mother. But I decided to take the slim chance and leave the decision to God because of my fear of parting with Cheng.</em></p><p><em>“If I got pregnant, things would go beyond my imagination…</em></p><p><em>“How silly and crazy I have been these days!</em></p><p><em>“However, on the other hand, Cheng has done more silly things than me.</em></p><p><em>“He ran until out of breath before talking to me in front of the Martial Arts Club. How shy and nervous he was!</em></p><p><em>“He hoped to hold my hand when we went boating at Zhaoshan Lake during our social meetup, but I jumped on agilely. How silly and cute he was!</em></p><p><em>“He confessed his love for me on that Valentine’s Day without any foreshadowing. Such an impulsive lunkhead!”</em></p><p><em>“He wanted to grab my hand on our first date but was too stiff and scared of being rejected. When we finally held hands, he was so lost and forgot about the traffic and direction.</em></p><p><em>“And that time we were kissing so passionately in the locker room when Reporter Shu knocked at the door. He was stressed and upset, on the edge of beating them up.</em></p><p><em>“And he always desired to make out with me and always managed to stick to the baseline by taking a cold shower helplessly with grief and indignation.”</em></p><p>…</p><p>Yan Zheke’s thought went wild. Thinking about all the silly things Lou Cheng has done for her, her lips curved upward with joy. But as more and more memories flashed in her head, her smile froze and her heart swelled. Something was brewing and something was about to break free.</p><p><em>“After the loss to Shanbei, he wanted me to experience the feeling of jumping off a high building and we hugged so tightly against the wind.</em></p><p><em>“He taught me many wicked things. We climbed walls. We sneaked out all night…</em></p><p><em>“And that night, he couldn’t help kissing every inch of my skin during the foot massage…</em></p><p><em>“That night, he called my name so desperately and passionately in bed. Thrilled and wild with joy, he still thought about protection…</em></p><p><em>“And how adorable he was when he felt jealous of the Dragon King for no reason…”</em></p><p><em>…</em></p><p>Memories from the last two years flooded in her head. The beautiful moments and feelings from their love were clear like yesterday. It bubbled in her heart and mind and blurred her vision. The bondage that kept her emotions under control was about to break.</p><p>“Ke, you are crying?” Ji Mingyu looked at her daughter in shock.</p><p>Yan Zheke wiped her eyes and forced a smile.</p><p>“I’m not, Mom. You know me. I don’t cry for sorrow.”</p><p>She lowered her head and sent Lou Cheng a message from her phone.</p><p>“Cheng, what are you doing now?”</p><p>Lou Cheng standing at a higher position outside the airport replied with a wry smile,</p><p>“I have found a place where I can watch airplanes take off and land…”</p><p>“A place for watching airplanes take off and land…” Yan Zheke chanted silently and everything in her heart went wild. The scenes she had recalled dashed out of her heart and went away.</p><p>Her vision was completely blurred and something warm rolled down her face, leaving a salty taste on her lips.</p><p>“Ke…” Ji Mingyu and Yan Kai was stunned by the tears on her daughter’s face.</p><p>Yan Zheke lost control of her tears and emotion. She grabbed her mobile and stood up, sobbing.</p><p>“Mom, Dad, I need to make a phone call.”</p><p>She ran to the corner and dialed Lou Cheng’s number nervously.</p><p>“Hello, Cheng…” Her voice was shaking and tears continued rolling down her fair face.</p><p>“Ke, what is it?” Asked Lou Cheng, very concerned.</p><p>Yan Zheke couldn’t see clearly. She continued, weeping,</p><p>“Cheng, I have never said it to you.”</p><p>She sobbed and cried in a low voice,</p><p>“Cheng… ”</p><p>“Yes?” Lou Cheng felt his eyes wet.</p><p>Yan Zheke paused for a second and tears filled up her eyes again.</p><p>“Cheng, I love you!”</p><p>…</p><p>One hour later, Lou Cheng checked his phone and confirmed her flight was taking off. He looked up towards the airport and saw a huge airplane rise slowly into the sky and gradually disappear in front of his eyes.</p><p>His heart felt empty like a broken moon or a tideless ocean. Nothing could make up for it.</p><p>He withdrew his eyes and went down the stairs blankly. Then his mobile suddenly rang and it was from Geezer Shi.</p><p>“Hello, Master,” Lou Cheng answered calmly.</p><p>Geezer Shi laughed.</p><p>“Yan Girl has taken off, right? I didn’t want to send you work in these times… We have some clues about the wine pot with the Dou character. The military wants to pursue it themselves, but I’d rather you do it. It’s a good opportunity to test your comprehensive capabilities.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
