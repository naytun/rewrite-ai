However, after two extremely tough fights, Lou Cheng’s final round was with Xu Wannian, whose supernatural ability was completely suppressed. Their expectations had expanded and they had been waiting for this moment to vent off their feelings.</p><p>“Champions!”</p><p>“Champions!”</p><p>Among the cheers and claps, the strongest bench fighter, Yan Zheke, rushed to the ring the first, like an agile deer, and hugged Lou Cheng.</p><p>At that very moment, she could suppress her surging feelings no more. In front of the audience and all the spectators in front of the TV, she showed her love to the world.</p><p><em>“Whatever! My dad already knows anyway.”</em></p><p>During the process, though extremely excited, she carefully avoided her boyfriend’s injured right arm.</p><p>Unlike his well-prepared teammates, Lou Cheng was still in a trance. He had quite some confidence in defeating Xu Wannian despite being at his limit, but he wasn’t completely assured. He had even planned for the worst that he would lay a good foundation for his little fairy’s victory. The win came so sudden, like a dream.</p><p>That hot, tender and fragrant body in his arms brought him back to reality. With joy rolling in his heart, he asked in an uncertain tone,</p><p>“We are the champions?”</p><p>“Yeah!” Yan Zheke nodded, her eyes sparkling.</p><p>“We are the champions!”</p><p>Looking at her joyful but tired boyfriend, she found him extremely handsome; even his strong sweat odor seemed refreshing and pleasant. Highly passionate and enthusiastic, she opened her lips slightly, about to get on her tiptoes to give Lou Cheng a deep kiss in front of the entire world.</p><p>Coming back to reality, Lou Cheng felt his emotions explode. He couldn’t restrain himself anymore and lowered his head to give his little fairy a french kiss in which he could share his feelings with her.</p><p>As their eyes locked, the kiss came really close, but Cai Zongming and the other teammates arrived, surrounded them, and grabbed him by his waist, legs, or shoulders.</p><p>“Champions!”</p><p>They cheered as they threw Lou Cheng up in the air and then caught him firmly.</p><p>“Champions!”</p><p>The celebration continued and Yan Zheke took a step back with a much-amused smile, her right hand upon her pink lips unconsciously. She was shocked by how she had lost control and felt sorry that the kiss had gotten disturbed by their teammates.</p><p>Up in the air, Lou Cheng turned around to look at the pretty Ke, his eyes filled with joy and innocence, showing his pity.</p><p>As their eyes met, Yan Zheke burst into a laugh more beautiful than all the flowers. When one thing suddenly came to her head, she opened her mouth with a worried look.</p><p>“His arm has injuries. Be careful! Careful!”</p><p>“Champions!”</p><p>“Champions!”</p><p>Listening to the ear-deafening screams and watching the excitement of his daughter and all the other members of the Song Cheng University Martial Arts Club, Yan Kai took a deep breath before giving a neutral comment while recalling Lou Cheng’s performance earlier.</p><p>“Very determined, of good quality, and fairly powerful.”</p><p>Quick-eared and sharp-eyed, Ji Mingyu chuckled and said quietly,</p><p>“My girl has a good eye. When they first started going out, I didn’t think Lou could improve to this level.”</p><p>Almost deafened by the shouts around them, Yan Kai, of average martial arts skills and no supernatural ability, turned around and asked blankly, “Ahh? What did you say? I didn’t hear!”</p><p>Ji Mingyu burst into a laugh and threw a glare at her husband, who was dumb like a wooden cock.</p><p>She grabbed his hands and raised them up as she shouted out,</p><p>“Champions!</p><p>“Champions!</p><p>“Being elegant and refined in manners isn’t a fit for this scene.</p><p>“Letting yourself have your own way once in a while is great for your mind and your health.”</p><p>Influenced by his wife, Yan Kai began to assimilate into the celebrating crowd, putting his gentleness and elegance aside for the moment.</p><p>However, something was still bothering him. Lou Cheng had earned his fame at such a young age. With such a bright future, would he give in to temptations, fall for comfort and luxury, and indulge and become promiscuous?</p><p>These things had happened to countless young individuals.</p><p>A father would worry if his little girl was dating a poor man. He would worry still if she was seeing a very successful guy. A father of a girl just couldn’t quit worrying.</p><p>…</p><p>“Round four… Lou Cheng wins!”</p><p>“The final result of the match: Songcheng University Martial Arts Club wins!”</p><p>In the emergency ward, Lin Que heaved a sigh upon hearing the result from the doctor. His tightened body relaxed and his clenched fists stretched open.</p><p>He closed his eyes and a very tough, manly middle-aged gentleman appeared in front of him.</p><p>“Father, I made it! I got the Feitian Cup…” Lin Que muttered silently.</p><p>That middle-aged man smiled gently, with much comfort on his face.</p><p>In the room on the other side of the wall, Bernhard and Mao Chengjun clinched their fists firmly while pained looks appeared on their faces.</p><p>The championship they thought they had secured was gone!</p><p>Peng Leyun, who was lying in bed, was not in a trance or thinking, he was lost and dejected.</p><p>Ever since he picked up martial arts, he had never suffered such a setback!</p><p><em>“I thought I could quit next year’s university tournament…”</em> The corners of his mouth twitched into a smirk at himself.</p><p>Fang Zhirong had long gotten in the locker room, burying his face in a white towel. Xu Wannian, supported by some staff by the arm, stepped down from the ring very slowly, bearing the cramp and pain in his ass.</p><p>He didn’t think he would end it so sumptuously.</p><p>…</p><p>“Round four… Lou Cheng wins!”</p><p>“The final result of the match: Songcheng University Martial Arts Club wins!”</p><p>In the broadcasting studio, the very responsive host, Liu Chang, quickly began to comment with a smile,</p><p>“Congratulations, Songcheng University. Congratulations, Lou Cheng and Lin Que. Congratulations, everyone from the Song Cheng University Martial Arts Club. Congratulations for the championship of this year’s National University Martial Arts Tournament. Congratulations for the very first national championship in Songcheng University’s history!”</p><p>He finished everything in one breath, feeling very passionate.</p><p>Chen Sansheng continued with a tinge of emotion,</p><p>“I’m sure it is obvious to everyone that Shanbei University is stronger than Songcheng University. However, Lin Que’s courage, determination, and self-sacrifice overcame the difference. Then Lou Cheng’s resolution stood up to the pressure and his outstanding performance as a favored fighter of the age brought them the final victory.</p><p>“What I really want to say is that the strongest team lost the title to the best team!</p><p>“Congratulations, Song Cheng University Martial Arts Club! You are the best!”</p><p>After letting out these words with his suppressed emotions, he took a moment to catch shis breath and then added with a smile,</p><p>“Right now I’m really looking forward to seeing how my old friend will honor his promise.”</p><p>Staring at his Weibo page, in front of all kinds of replies, He Xiaowei was lost for a minute. He struggled dearly to move his arm and finally clicked on his nickname.</p><p>He took his time to prepare himself, closed his eyes, and typed in a new name in the dark.</p><p>Poison Milk Hierarch!</p><p>Phew… As soon as it was done, he leaned back and shut his eyes again sorrowfully, feeling his old soul of Superstitious Belief Is Bad dying.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>After the referee’s announcement, An All-knowing Man in Ganghood pounded the table with fury, breaking his treasure into pieces. A sharp pain came from his wrist.</p><p>Once he calmed down, he realized Lou Cheng might reach the Inhuman stage this year and he might have to delete his account as he had promised…</p><p>…</p><p>“Round four… Lou Cheng wins!”</p><p>“The final result of the match” Songcheng University Martial Arts Club wins!”</p><p>In the dorm room of the Faculty of Art in Songcheng University, Yan Xiaoling, instead of posting, telling jokes, or celebrating upon seeing the victory, began to cry, her eyes very red and her vision blurry.</p><p>“It was not easy… Not easy… It was not easy for Lou Cheng or Lin Que…</p><p>“How many setbacks have they gone through? How much effort have they devoted? Finally, they won the title!”</p><p>Through tears, she browsed the forums, which were flooded by the word “Champion,” and cried even harder.</p><p>“It was not easy for any of us!”</p><p>Yan Xiaoling turned around unconsciously to check on Mu Jinnian, who was also dropping tears, eyes red and makeup smudged.</p><p>“You are also crying…” Yan Xiaoling sobbed.</p><p>“Would it be very odd if I called it a coincidence?”</p><p>“Yeah… I’m happy but worried…” Mu Jinnian whimpered. “Ling, your wish has come true!”</p><p>“Of course…” With tears on her face, Yan Xiaoling looked rather proud.</p><p>Mu Jinnian dried her tears and changed to a serious tone,</p><p>“To not cause them any boomerang effect, I’ll make sure you get up early from tomorrow on.”</p><p>“Ahh…” Yan Xiaoling opened her mouth wide. On her face was a dumbfounded expression.</p><p>…</p><p>After the celebration, the staff began to clean the stage. They carpeted the floor, during which singers and dancers were performing.</p><p>Twenty minutes later, everything was set. Fang Jinjue, the chairman of the national university Martial Arts Federation led several guests up onto the stage. They first awarded the 2nd place silver medals to the low-spirited, dismayed Shanbei University members.</p><p>“Next, welcome the champions of this National University Martial Arts Tournament, Songcheng University Martial Arts Club!” called the host loudly.</p><p>Woooo!</p><p>Among waves of vuvuzela blows, all the members followed Geezer Shi up onto the stage. Gold medals were held by Miss Etiquettes, and the Martial Apsara cup was placed on the desk in front of them.</p><p>In a split second, all their emotions were surging up again. Lou Cheng, tears coming to his eyes, turned around to Yan Zheke, noticing her eyes blurry and a crystal tear dripping down her fine face, extremely beautiful and charming.</p><p>“You said you never cried…” Lou Cheng calmed himself down and poked a joke at Ke.</p><p>Yan Zheke quivered her lovely nose and threw a glare at him before answering with sobs,</p><p>“I said I never cried when I was sad and gloomy. Right now I’m very glad and thrilled…”</p><p>Li Mao and Cai Zongming supported Lin Que by the arms, stepping out of the emergency ward. Once his injuries were stabilized, he strongly demanded to attend the ceremony.</p><p>Lou Cheng moved closer to Yan Zheke to make some room for his brother-in-law to his right.</p><p>Before they could share any words, the old gentleman, Fang Jinjue, approached and awarded them each a gold medal.</p><p>“How much alcohol can I get out of this?” Geezer Shi mumbled, giving Fang Jinyu a great deal of shock, who had been pretending to be a total stranger.</p><p>After some coughs, Fang Jinyu placed a gold medal around Lin Que’s neck and praised with a smile,</p><p>“You have persistence, courage, and ability to take action, what a true martial artist is made of.”</p><p>Lin Que nodded gently as his answer, trying to remain cool and calm, but his eyes faltered.</p><p>“A young talent, you deserve to be one of the Heavenly Sons.” Fang Jinjue moved forward and gave a very positive comment to Lou Cheng while putting on the gold medal for him.</p><p>“I have just begun,” answered Lou Cheng in a humorous manner.</p><p>After awarding all the gold medals, Fang Jinjue picked up the Apsara Cup, the highest honor, and handed towards Coach Shi Jianguo.</p><p>Geezer Shi waved and pointed at Lou Cheng. “He will take it.”</p><p>“Give it to Lin Que.” Lou Cheng inserted in a hurry.</p><p>Without asking why, Fang Jinjue handed the Feitian Cup to Lin Que in a very serious way.</p><p>Lin Que accepted it with both hands. His eyes suddenly blurred with tears as the heaviness landed on him.</p><p>He didn’t take a moment to recall any old memories; instead, he raised the cup high in the air. The championship cup of the National University Martial Arts Tournament.</p><p>“Champions!”</p><p>The audience cheered. Lou Cheng and everyone from the team cheers!</p><p>Bam! Bam! Bam! Guns were fired and countless white and black paper pieces flew, becoming a glorious background behind Lin Que, Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke.</p><p>“Champions!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
