Even if they came to the Capital earlier on, they wouldn’t have been able to get in. Don’t forget that I’m the one with the room key.” Yan Zheke rolled her eyes playfully and swiped the room card.</p><p>After the beep, she pushed open the door and walked in, slightly hesitantly, as if she actually was afraid of finding her parents in the room.</p><p>Fortunately, the room was empty, clean, and neatly set, with a hint of faint fragrance.</p><p>“I’m just trying to lighten the tense atmosphere in case you’re nervous,” Lou Cheng said with a smile. He walked in and closed the door behind him before hesitating for a moment and asking, “Ke, if your father really does eventually find out, what should we do?”</p><p>“If he finds out. I’ll, I’ll… I’ll bring you home!” Yan Zheke stammered while waving her hands before finally finishing firmly.</p><p>With a sigh of relief at having come to a decision, she felt less anxious. She then took out her phone and dialed Ji Mingyu’s number.</p><p>She still didn’t dare to face her father and was preparing to avoid him.</p><p><em>Yes, if he can’t reach me, then I don’t need to confront him!</em></p><p>Lou Cheng was now full of courage and confidence, but he was still restless when it came to his girlfriend’s parents. There were still some misgivings. After all, there were some people who were unable to succeed in anything and enjoyed trying to spoil things for others. Family gossip was perhaps one of the last things that might damage his relationship with Ke.</p><p>This was also the reason why he was still secretly dating Ke, even after he got the championship in the Youth Tournament at the provincial level. Before they could talk about marriage, their relationship had to be stable. If their parents meddled carelessly and messed up everything, many conflicts could arise, which would weaken the relationship a lot.</p><p>Thus, as Yan Zheke waited for the call to connect, Luo Cheng subconsciously slowed his breathing. Of course, he’d prepared his men to cover their tracks.</p><p>“How are you, Mom?” Yan Zheke asked in a sweet voice.</p><p>The women on the line said with a smile, “You’re finally calling back.”</p><p>“Mom, how can you say that! I talk to you every day, right? I won an important match today, can’t I share the good news with you?” Yan Zheke rebutted with a pouting smile as she blushed. Soon, she continued, “Ohh, yeah, where’s dad?”</p><p><em>Tonight, Empress Dowager sent a few messages praising me, but Dad didn’t respond.</em></p><p>“Your dad?” Ji Mingyu suddenly said with a grin, “He’s buying a plane ticket to the Capital.”</p><p>“Ah?” Yan Zheke became dumbfounded, while Lou Cheng was taken aback by this news.</p><p>Hearing her reaction, Ji Mingyu replied with a smile, “Isn’t expected for a father-in-law to see the son-in-law who abducted his only daughter?”</p><p>“Does, does he know everything?” Yan Zheke stuttered.</p><p><em>Will Dad over-react? Cheng will not be able to resist at all, poor him…</em></p><p>She leaned over towards her boyfriend in spite of herself.</p><p><em>“Do I have to proffer a birch and ask for a flogging?”</em> Lou Cheng thought of an amusing idea.</p><p>“You and Lou Cheng flirted with each other and even used the word ‘Army’, to celebrate. Your dad is not a fool, you know; how could he not notice that?” Ji Mingyu said gleefully.</p><p>Empress Dowager’s tone made Yan Zheke less tense and she asked with concern, “How… how did Dad react? Did he say something?”</p><p>“He was amazed, surprised, stunned, angry, and disappointed,” Ji Mingyu teased her daughter as if recalling Ke’s father’s face when he caught them dating.</p><p><em>My father didn’t beat him to death at the scene. He was good-tempered enough to spare him at that time…</em> mused Yan Zheke thoughtfully.</p><p>“Then, then what happened?” Yan Zheke asked while Lou Cheng listened more carefully.</p><p>“Your father gave me a look and asked me whether I already knew. I said it was very obvious. After all, I couldn’t just ignore what happened. He looked so lost as if saying ‘My dear daughter, you disappoint me.’” Ji Mingyu chuckled and continued, “So I reminded him of what we did when we were dating. He was speechless! When I told him what you’re thinking now and Lou’s promise, he kept muttering that you two were so inconsiderate and had hidden everything from him. He also said that he was not a domineering dad and could not understand why his own daughter was so disenchanted with him. Your dad is so dramatic!”</p><p>Yan Zheke laughed and said with relief, “Has he accepted it?”</p><p>“He didn’t admit it, but he decided to look up Lou’s information. If your dad was skilled in witchcraft, I think he would have cursed his son-in-law to death. Then he sat there alone for half an hour and smoked two cigarettes for the first time….” With those words, Ji Mingyu began to pity her husband and continued, “You say you’re in love, but do you have to display it so ostentatiously? Can’t you just keep it a secret until you graduate?</p><p>“Since your dad is so worried, he’s already started picking flight tickets. He says it’s so that he can cheer for you in your final competition and check out whether ‘that Lou Cheng fellow’ is an honest and reliable boy, for the fear that you may be cheated. Alas, he’s worrying too much.”</p><p>Hearing these words, Yan Zheke’s heart warmed up and she asked, “When will you get here?”</p><p>“He booked tickets for the day after tomorrow. He has two operations tomorrow and doesn’t want to disturb you before the final game. ‘Play well and we will talk about everything else after the competition’ is what he wanted me to tell you.” Ji Mingyu clicked her tongue and continued, “Your dad has finished bathing. Do you want to talk to him?”</p><p>“Yes, please.” Yan Zheke was full of guilt as she prepared to talk to her father.</p><p>“Hello, Ke. Are you back in the hotel after the celebration?” Yan Kai’s voice was low and magnetic, but he sounded a little tired.</p><p>Yan Zheke answered in a flutter, “We didn’t celebrate, because I have to prepare for the final competition. I, I was out walking around with Lou Cheng and just came back.”</p><p><em>Since Dad doesn’t want us to hide it from him, then I’ll just tell him…</em></p><p>“…” A short silence followed, until Yan Kai sighed and said with a smile, “Time really does fly… My daughter has already grown up! I don’t want to stop you from dating in university, but I also don’t want you to lose the freedom to be yourself. When you become more mature, then, well… Forget it. Just do as you wish. Anyway, love yourself. If you have any problems, Mom and Dad are here for you. Er… After the final match, we can have dinner with Lou.”</p><p>“Okay!” Yan Zheke nodded slightly, her eyes misting over, even though her father couldn’t see her.</p><p>“Well, have a good rest for tomorrow’s competition.” Yan Kai hung up the phone with mixed feelings.</p><p>Yan Zheke stared at Lou Cheng for a few seconds and she put her fist into his chest and said, with a half-sigh, half-smile,</p><p>“You must behave yourself, boy!”</p><p>“Okay!” Lou Cheng reached over and took her hand, taking her in his arms.</p><p><em>It’s even more</em> nerve-racking <em>than beating Peng Leyun…</em></p><p><em>I have to put on a good show for the final competition. Even though Yan Kai must have seen my games before as his daughter’s classmate, this time is different. As a father-in-law seeing his son-in-law, he will probably be a lot</em> <em>more picky!</em></p><p>After they had snuggled up for a while, Yan Zheke suddenly said, “Oh, no!”</p><p>“What if my Dad sees us? My grandparents, uncles, and cousins, what if they can see us?”</p><p>She took the phone, turned it around, and said, “Ugh, I’m not calling them back to ask anyway… Whatever!”</p><p>Lou Cheng wanted to laugh after hearing that, and he jokingly replied, “It’s rare to see you like this. Well, either way, my fairy is cute! Do you want a massage?”</p><p>“Of course!” Yan Zheke gritted her teeth.</p><p>Lying in bed and having her muscle tension relieved by the Tremor force, the girl was half nostalgic and half sad. “My mom said that when I was born, at first he wished I was a boy. Then he bought many books related to family education from infancy to adolescence. Once he got time, he studied them, trying his best to become a good father…”</p><p>“What a sweet and loving father-in-law,” Lou Cheng praised him.</p><p>He thought that Ke wasn’t in the mood to make out with him, so he abandoned this idea and concentrated on massaging her while chatting away with her.</p><p><em>I’m not that kind of person, a man who only thinks about that!</em></p><p>“My dad expects a lot from me. He hopes that I can be an independent girl and establish good values towards love and marriage…” Yan Zheke said with a tone of regret, thinking that she had let him down.</p><p><em>But I don’t really feel regret…</em></p><p>Time moved quickly as they chatted away. The girl fell asleep while enjoying the massage. Lou Cheng stayed the night as he had the key. He took the supple and beautiful body in his arms, feeling quite satisfied and peaceful in his heart.</p><p>Looking at the ceiling, he thought of the meeting with his father-in-law, the final match, and Shanbei.</p><p><em>What’s Peng Leyun doing now…</em> With this thought flashing across his mind, Lou Cheng closed his eyes and fell asleep.</p><p><em>In two days, I’m going to have to fight him.</em></p><p>…</p><p>In the swimming pool, on the top floor of the hotel.</p><p>Bare-chested, Peng Leyun sat in swimming shorts by the swimming pool, watching the shimmering ripples spreading as if he was in wonderland.</p><p>He held his breath while his heart beat audibly as if he had returned into his mother’s womb, which was surrounded by water.</p><p>Return to nature and seek the root pulp!</p><p>Everything around him faded away and all sort of thoughts came to mind. Peng Leyun lost all sense of time, and everything else. He felt every subtle detail in his body as he sustained this wonderful state.</p><p>All of a sudden, he felt a shock and rose to the surface before taking a deep breath of cold air. He wasn’t muscle-bound but still had an explosive force.</p><p>“Good, much better than last time! Another two minutes!” Next to the swimming pool, Xu Wannian held up his phone in his hand and gave him a thumbs up.</p><p>Getting to the bank of the swimming pool, Peng Leyun replied with a smile, “It was so-so.”</p><p>His hair was wet and stuck to his head, giving him a masculine charm.</p><p>“You take a rest, I’ll have a swim and relax a bit.” Xu Wannian put down his phone and plopped into the pool.</p><p>All of a sudden, he gave out a bizarre yell as if he had been poked by something, saying in confusion, “Was that an electric shock!?”</p><p>When he said this, he suddenly realized that his feet were treading on water, and he lifted his head, looking up at Peng Leyun, who was seated in the deckchair and lost in thought.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
