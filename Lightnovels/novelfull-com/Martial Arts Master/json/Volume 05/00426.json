Zhang Li and the rest of the guests momentarily became quiet.</p><p>“Look, this is the favored fighter of the age.” Ji Lingxi was the first to break the silence. Smiling, she turned to Yan Zheke and complained, “They were so excited and curious about Lou Cheng that they came here to wait for you shamelessly. They wanted to see the favored fighter of the age in person to confirm if he really had three heads and six arms.”</p><p>“So I’m a monster in your eyes?” Lou Cheng joked.</p><p>“No, no, no! You reached the top Sixth Pin after only learning martial arts for one and a half years. You’re not a monster but a superman!” Zhang Li smiled.</p><p>This relatively level-headed man kept rotating his string of brown beads.</p><p>“Yes, a superman!” Han Zhengcao gave an exaggerated laugh before asking in confusion, “Lou Cheng, why do I find you a little different from the one I see on screen?”</p><p>“Different?” Lou Cheng smiled, looking at Yan Zheke and finding the same confused expression on her face.</p><p>He had just appeared on the screen five or six days ago!</p><p>Guo Guo was a petite girl, but her facial features were rather imposing. She thought for a while and replied, “You’re a little different. On screen, you’re, uh, more aggressive. The kind of person no one will dare to meet eyes with.”</p><p>“Haha, I got it! In a fight, I’d release my momentum to pressure my opponents. In my post-match interviews, I usually haven’t come out of that state,” Lou Cheng replied.</p><p>The one they saw on screen was probably his ‘combat form’!</p><p>Zhang Li nodded. “I see. You’re calm and kind in your everyday life, but the atmosphere on the arena sets you ablaze.”</p><p>None of them was a fan of martial arts, and they rarely read related news unless it was about the most popular competitions. Therefore, they paid little attention to such details even though they had many Mighty One elders.</p><p>With such an ice-breaker, the atmosphere in the room turned warm and lively. Ji Lingxi and her guests sat down and began chatting happily.</p><p>Their main topic was obviously Lou Cheng and what he had done. Noticing Lou Cheng’s lack of interest in the beads, jade, and ambergris, they didn’t bring those up again. Instead, they began gossiping about the martial arts field.</p><p>Lou Cheng wasn’t concerned about their conversation. Even if he couldn’t afford any one of their collections, he never had an inferiority complex and instead wanted to take the opportunity to broaden his horizons. So he listened on quietly.</p><p>Nothing could affect his self-confidence.</p><p>As the clock ticked, Lou Cheng took a look at his phone and stood up with a smile.</p><p>“It’s getting late. I need to rest. You guys continue with your chat.”</p><p>He was speaking normally but gave the rest the feeling that he resisted any form of rebuke. Ji Lingxi stood up and asked in confusion, “So early?”</p><p>“Ever since he started learning martial arts, he has been operating on an old man’s schedule. Well, me too!” Yan Zheke explained in her boyfriend’s place and made up an excuse for her to leave as well.</p><p>“It’s time for us to leave too.” Zhang Li smiled. “We’re going sailing tomorrow. Would you like to join us? We can go fishing in the sea breeze. There are several covert boxing matches on the high seas too.”</p><p>The existing Challenge Tournaments were exciting but not stimulating due to the presence of referees. To fulfill their desires, some rich folks would organize covert Challenge Tournaments in areas of conflict or on the high seas without referees!</p><p>Even though there were no deaths, the audience would at least see some blood and flesh during these ferocious matches. That would awaken the beast within them.</p><p>Of course, the fighters willing to fight in these covert matches and earn quick money were not that great. If they were able to reach the Dan stage or the Sixth or Seventh Pin, there would definitely be people willing to be their guarantor, or the opportunity to repay their debts slowly would arise even if they were heads over heels in debt.</p><p>Glancing at Yan Zheke, he rejected them with a smile. “No, thanks.”</p><p>Tomorrow, he would stay at home with Ke and help her massage her stomach. When he made his travel plans earlier, he had already accommodated a day for this task.</p><p>“Okay, we’ll invite you again the next time. With your Listening skill, you’re sure to get plenty of fish.” Zhang Li didn’t insist on his offer. He left with Han Zhengcao and Guo Guo and boarded his SUV.</p><p>He took off the string of brown beads and wrapped it around the gear lever. He was deep in thought for several minutes before asking, “What do you think about Lou Cheng?”</p><p>Han Zhengcao rubbed his eyes and replied seriously, “He’s pretty kind, reserved, and friendly.”</p><p>“But… don’t you think his momentum is quite strong and terrifying? We could only obey his words earlier…” Guo Guo frowned.</p><p>“Haha, that’s normal. It’s the confidence of a Mighty One, accumulated little by little from his victories. My mother’s the same. Even though she has never used harsh words to talk to me, I can only obey all her advice without being able to offer a different opinion,” Han Zhengcao said self-deprecatingly. “As the favored fighter of the age, Lou Cheng is even more terrifying than my mother.”</p><p>“Yes.” Zhang Li started the engine and moved the car.</p><p>“Either way, he’ll be sure to morph into the Inhuman stage and become a physical-invulnerability warrior in the future,” Han Zhengcao said. “We’re all weak and don’t have the heart to practice. It’s a good idea to befriend someone like Lou Cheng!”</p><p>“Wow! I didn’t think our Master Han, who loves alcohol, cars, and beautiful women, would say something like this,” Guo Guo teased.</p><p>Han Zhengcao was usually the stereotypical playboy.</p><p>“This is called preparing for danger in times of peace!” he retorted.</p><p>Zhang Li nodded in agreement. “I’m glad you understand. That proves my persuasion all this time isn’t useless. Why do you think Lingxi went home today? Just to see her cousin?”</p><p>“Isn’t it?” Guo Guo and Han Zhengcao asked in astonishment.</p><p>Zhang Li snickered. “The Ji clan is your typical martial arts aristocratic family. They may be influential and rich, with many properties under their name, but within the family, they’re still ranked according to strength…”</p><p>Twirling her long, curly hair, Guo Guo interrupted with a frown, “Uncle Ji gets on quite well with his three siblings.”</p><p>“That’s because their parents are holding down the fort. Don’t you know where there are people, there’s the pugilist world; and where there are money and power, there’s conflict? Uncle Ji kept so many mistresses just so he can have talented children to lay a foundation for himself. But none are promising enough for him to bring home.” Zhang Li sighed. “You don’t know how many tears Lingxi has shed for this. She seems to play around with all her heart, but she knows this truth better than anyone.</p><p>“She knows she won’t go any further in her martial arts career, and she doesn’t want to fight for anything. She just wants to maintain her current position and lifestyle. That’s why keeping up her relationship with Yan Zheke, who she already gets along with, is the most practical choice. Never mind the fact that Yan Zheke also has a truly great fighter for a boyfriend…”</p><p>Lou Cheng might’ve thought that there were many tough fighters close to his age after meeting so many favored fighters of the age recently, but the truth was, such fighters were pretty rare. The only person Zhang Li and Han Zhengcao knew who was even close to that level was Lin Que.</p><p>In a world where a high-ranked Inhuman fighter of the Dan stage could enter the upper levels of civil service, it was completely reasonable to assume Lou Cheng, a favored fighter of the age likely to reach the physical-invulnerability stage, would be greatly favored in the Ji clan.</p><p>“Brother Li…” A stunned Han Zhengcao couldn’t help gasping. “You’ve kept so many secrets to yourself!”</p><p>He could see through everything so clearly!</p><p>Zhang Li sneered. “With the size of my clan, do you think I could survive if I’m not at least that smart? Do you think I would still be the young master?”</p><p>He paused and sighed again. “I truly admire Lou Cheng and his fellow fighters. They’re invulnerable and have no need to fear all these struggles for power… Either way, I’m looking forward to the opportunity to help or get help from him.”</p><p>Whichever way it was, he could develop a closer friendship with Lou Cheng.</p><p>…</p><p>Under the watchful eye of a physical-invulnerability mighty one in the house, Lou Cheng didn’t attempt to sneak into his girlfriend’s room and instead stayed inside the guest room of the Ji clan’s old house. After washing up and lying on the bed, he received a call from his mother.</p><p>After chatting for a while, Qi Fang said mysteriously, “Your brother hit the jackpot lately!”</p><p>“Ah?” Lou Cheng wore a dumb look on his face.</p><p>Lou Yuanwei had really succeeded in his business? He didn’t tell Lou Cheng!</p><p>“Erzi has expanded his business to Xiushan and asked your brother to help him. He even gave your brother shares,” Qi Fang said, gossiping with great enthusiasm.</p><p>She didn’t envy Lou Yuanwei. After all, her son was far more promising, and not everyone could match up to his achievements.</p><p>Lou Cheng momentarily blanked.</p><p>“Who’s Erzi?”</p><p>Qi Fang was speechless for a while. “One of our relatives from Qingfu, our hometown. He’s been visiting your grandparents often recently.”</p><p>“Ah, I remember him! He’s pretty nice,” Lou Cheng said.</p><p>“But short-sighted. He actually asked your brother to help him with his business. Doesn’t he know how many businesses your brother has failed in?” Qi Fang said, insisting on her perception that Lou Yuanwei didn’t have the talent for business.</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed. “It’s fine. We’re not the one suffering the losses.”</p><p>“That’s right. Oh, by the way, your father got promoted recently. Fatty Guo is letting him manage the entire factory and even wanted to give him some shares… Cheng, is it thanks to you? Fatty Guo mentioned this as soon as you became the national champion. As the saying goes… Um, what is it again?” Qi Fang was not well educated and had forgotten what she was supposed to say.</p><p>“Gild the lily,” Lou Cheng chimed in. “Fatty Guo is a pretty decent guy. Didn’t he help us through hard times in the past?”</p><p>“Yeah. But if he really asks for your help, don’t worry about us. Do it if you can and just say no if you can’t,” Qi Fang advised with concern.</p><p>“Yes, yes,” Lou Cheng replied, smiling.</p><p>When the conversation ended and the surroundings fell into silence once again, Lou Cheng sighed with emotion.</p><p>Ever since he was crowned champion in the national martial arts competition and was even dubbed the favored fighter of the age, everything around him was changing. These changes might have begun a long time ago, but they were never this clear. Without him even opening his mouth, the fate of his relatives was also changing…</p><p>Only now did he truly understand what it meant to experience a change in one’s social identity and position.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
