She attempted to throw back the covers and get out of bed but immediately covered her body once she saw the marks and stains on her fair skin from last night’s passionate actions. Blushful, she gave Lou Cheng a gentle kick with her left foot.</p><p>“Bring my nightie over!”</p><p>Completely taken over by her great sexual desire, she didn’t have time to change last night at all!</p><p>Lou Cheng chuckled as he affectionately squeezed her foot and got up, stepping to her suitcase completely naked with beautiful muscles and lines. He found a slash neck nightdress under her secret glances. In the meantime, she quickly put on her underwear under the quilt, recalling their first night together.</p><p>With two feet on the carpet, she suddenly frowned with a pained look before she could stand up.</p><p>“Are you OK?” Lou Cheng approached at once and held her, very concerned.</p><p>“It’s your fault!” Yan Zheke lifted her right foot and stamped him with little force before continuing, “Again and again…”</p><p>Her voice lowered and the redness quickly spread from her face to her neck.</p><p>“But you started the second round…” Lou Cheng defended his innocence.</p><p>“My fault then?” Yan Zheke threw him a glare and the pure yet tempting expression in her eyes turned Lou Cheng on. He wanted to stay in the room with her forever.</p><p>Lou Cheng put on his mature voice and a loving smile.</p><p>“It’s all my fault! 100%!”</p><p>He happily took the blame.</p><p>Except for the second time, he did take the initiative in every round, longing for more and more after the first taste of it. At times he did act very rough, forgetting how delicate Ke was until she called for a truce. Then they hugged and talked deeply, their bodies and souls both connected.</p><p>Yan Zheke stared at him as she made her way to the bathroom.</p><p>Listening to the sound of her shower, Lou Cheng was aroused and very tempted to jump in to join her.</p><p>He didn’t think he could resist the desire in the shower, and in that case, Ke probably wouldn’t be able to leave the room today. He cooled himself down with a bottle of water and got dressed to search for required documents and general procedure for getting married.</p><p>When he figured out everything, Yan Zheke came out, her face very red either from the hot water or the reflection of all the marks and stains on her body.</p><p>Under a white towel were her wet hair, side fringe, and pure, glittering eyes.</p><p>Lou Cheng just couldn’t have enough of her beauty. He stared so much that Yan Zheke had to turn her head away, her mouth pouting and eyelashes flapping.</p><p>“Quit gazing me like an idiot! Come and help me dry my hair!”</p><p>“Sure!” Lou Cheng used two towels to absorb most of the water and then began to blowdry her hair carefully with a hotel hair dryer, his eyes tender and hands gentle as if caressing a precious treasure.</p><p>During the blowdry, Lou Cheng once again felt how hard it must be for a long-haired girl.</p><p><em>“We must cherish these long-haired girls who wash thier hair for you…”</em></p><p>Yan Zheke sat still on the bed, enjoying the warm wind and her boyfriend’s delicate moves, her eyes lowered and mouth curved upward.</p><p><em>“This is the pleasure of married life.”</em></p><p>“Done. Your turn to shower.” Yan Zheke felt her hair with her hand and urged Lou Cheng to go to the bathroom. Then she went through her suitcase, looking for suitable clothes for the weather.</p><p>The curtain was open and the sunshine came in, giving the room a golden shine. His little fairy in a light color chiffon top, a pair of jean shorts, and the same pair of skating shoes from yesterday. Her bare, tender legs against the window were almost too beautiful to be real.</p><p>He stood there, watching Yan Zheke pile up the stained sheets and covers beside the bed. She turned to Lou Cheng, gentling biting her bottom lip, blushful.</p><p>“What shall we do when the cleaner sees this later? Should we just burn it?”</p><p>“It will be more than the cleaner if we burn it…” Lou Cheng chuckled at Ke’s innocence and poked fun at her. “What about we sneak it home as a souvenir?”</p><p>“Sick!” Yan Zheke groaned before leaving this matter behind. She bent down to make the bed and discovered her skin-toned stockings under the cover with stains from last night.</p><p>Her face flushed, thinking about how everything had started, and threw the stocking at Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Pervert!”</p><p>Lou Cheng responded with a silly grin.</p><p>…</p><p>After taking a slice of the fresh cream cake, Lou Cheng booked a car to pick them up from the hotel to save Yan Zheke some walking.</p><p>The ride was surprisingly smooth, and they made it to the university cafeteria for lunch before visiting the Household Registration Department under the Students’ Affairs Department at 2 PM.</p><p>“Teacher, good afternoon. We’d love to borrow our household registration pages. How can we apply?” Lou Cheng stepped in first and spoke to a middle-aged woman politely.</p><p>The teacher at the Household Registration Department looked up at them and blurted out,</p><p>“Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke!”</p><p>No one in Songcheng University didn’t know them!</p><p>A bright smile climbed on her face upon seeing these two celebrities of the school. “Why do you need the household pages?”</p><p>“Teacher, you know we are dating, right?” answered Lou Cheng self-confidently. Yan Zheke subconsciously lowered her head and pinched him in his waist.</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled at the sweet pinch and continued, “We want to make a trip abroad this summer before going back home. We need it for visas.”</p><p>They had come up with this excuse together earlier. Telling the teacher they were getting married would be courting trouble, since a terrified teacher would lead to the dean, the president, and the parents.</p><p>“You young people know how to enjoy life.” If it was another student couple, the teacher would say “no” right in their faces. But these two were known by all and she had no reason to be difficult when the school management seemed to have no problem with their relationship.</p><p>She might not have the courage to give them any problem, considering their martial arts skills…</p><p>Rumor had it that many guys were very fond of Yan Zheke, but they didn’t have the confidence to approach this famous fighter.</p><p>“Enjoy life? You have no idea…” Lou Cheng whispered silently to himself and put on an even bigger smile. “Teacher, please. How can we get it?”</p><p>“Usually, you need to get a paper from your department, fill in this form, and get it signed by your counselor and stamped by the responsible deputy president before coming to me,” said the teacher with a friendly smile. “However, for you two, we don’t need it to be that complicated. The president spoke so highly of you and everybody knows you. We can do it through the Martial Arts Club. Fill in the form and get a stamp from the Security Department. That’s all.”</p><p>“Got it. Thank you so much, Teacher!” said Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke happily.</p><p>The Martial Arts Club on the upswing had been on good terms with the Security Department. Lou Cheng was pretty confident he could get it done easily.</p><p>After merely ten minutes, he came back with two stamped forms to rejoin Yan Zheke outside. They successfully got their household registration pages that could prove their identities.</p><p>The toughest step had been completed and everything else should be easy. They exchanged gazes and smiled lovingly at each other, content and expectant.</p><p>…</p><p>In a mall, Lou Cheng dragged Yan Zheke straight to the area for custom diamond rings.</p><p>“Everything is expensive here. We better pick a special one in a jewelry shop.” She attempted to stop him and continued with a sweet smile, “You need to save money so you can visit me more often. That’s more important than a diamond ring. Give me a better one on our wedding.”</p><p>Lou Cheng thought about it and happily nodded with warmth in his heart. “Fine. I’ll listen to Coach Yan!”</p><p>They went to a well-known jewelry shop and eventually paid over 60,000 for a pair of rings. The diamonds shone so brightly, and they could barely tell if they were in a dream.</p><p>…</p><p>In a residential quarter, Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke followed the map to a photo studio specialized in wedding photography.</p><p>“We have traditional, exotic, modern, and student-style clothing available. Pick any three.” The receptionist did a double take at Yan Zheke’s perfect skin.</p><p>“Yeah.” Yan Zheke nodded excitedly and began to browse albums. After seeking advice from Lou Cheng, she decided on a traditional chinese dress, a student uniform, and a casual suit.</p><p>After a quick makeup application, Lou Cheng changed into a loosely fitted black traditional Chinese robe with red patterns. A while later, Yan Zheke walked out of the fitting room in a matching dress, elegant and decorous. Her hair was beautifully braided to match her dress. She looked more charming than ever.</p><p>As she made her way towards Lou Cheng step by step, the wedding march was played in his head. He couldn’t help stepping forward to receive her.</p><p>His romantic imagination didn’t last long. Soon, the photographer began to give commands.</p><p>“Get closer!”</p><p>“Put your heads against each other!”</p><p>“Don’t touch…”</p><p>“Perfect. Stay!”</p><p>Lou Cheng noticed Yan Zheke constantly moving to his back. He asked in a low voice, “Ke, what’s the matter?”</p><p>Yan Zheke cast a glance at him and smiled,</p><p>“I want to stand a little bit away from the camera so my face looks smaller!”</p><p>“The wedding photos are for life!”</p><p>“…” Lou Cheng didn’t say anything, but the happiness in his eyes was obvious.</p><p>…</p><p>The photos were ready very quickly. They took a cab and arrived at the marriage registration office in the Civil Affairs Bureau just after 4:30 PM.</p><p>They read the posted requirements carefully. Yan Zheke stayed in the office to fill in forms and Lou Cheng took everything to get copies.</p><p>Everything was done by 4:36. They managed to take a number before the staff got off work.</p><p>It was just an average Thursday, June 26. Not many couples were waiting ahead of them. After ten minutes, it was their turn.</p><p>They each took a seat and handed over their papers. Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke looked at each other, seeing the same excitement, expectation, joy, and nervousness.</p><p>A lady in her 50s browsed their papers carefully and double checked everything in their database. She blurted out, “You are students?”</p><p>Before they could say anything, she saw “Professional Eighth Pin, Dan stage” on her screen and began to process their marriage certificates without a word.</p><p>A few minutes later, she put photos on the certificates and handed them to Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke.</p><p>“Don’t forget to update your marital status on your household registration pages in the police station.”</p><p>“Update?” Lou Cheng shared a puzzled glance with Yan Zheke.</p><p>“We are married now?”</p><p>“We are legally married?”</p><p>The procedure was too simple to give them any time to adjust. After the lady kicked them out of the room, they began to feel the change in their status.</p><p>Yan Zheke opened the marriage certificate of Lou Cheng and looked at their photo in traditional Chinese clothing and the date “26 June” under it, smiling and showing her dimples. She took out the male one of the pair of rings with a diamond in a decorative design.</p><p>Her eyes announced her feelings out loud. She grabbed Lou Cheng’s left hand, put the marriage certificate in his hand, and slowly put the dazzling ring on his ring finger.</p><p>As the ring slid on tighter and tighter, Yan Zheke’s eyes became watery and emotions flooded into her head.</p><p><em>“The boy who ran until he was out of breath to chat with me, the youth who used to be so helpless whenever in front of me, the classmate who did everything to make me happy, the man who traveled far and waited all night in the rain just to see me, the boyfriend who never complained about his weariness, the silly Cheng who cherished me in his hands as if I were a piece of treasure, and the determined Lou Cheng who became a martial artist because of me is now my husband. He is my husband now!</em></p><p><em>“As husband and wife, we are to grow grey together…”</em></p><p>The atmosphere suddenly became solemn. Lou Cheng took out the female one, much bigger and with a more elaborate design.</p><p>He held her tender hand, gave her the other marriage certificate, and put the ring on her ring finger.</p><p>In the beautiful sunshine, everything was brilliant. Yan Zheke looked at him, shy but determined, her lips pursed and her head still.</p><p>As the ring slid on her finger, Lou Cheng was suddenly overwhelmed by a mixture of feelings. Yan Zheke’s figure from the past flashed in his head.</p><p><em>“The classmate from next door I went by just to have one glance at, the goddess I couldn’t resist locking my eyes on, the beautiful girl in a white and red suit of traditional Chinese robe in front of the Martial Arts Club entrance, the gorgeous figure I could only dream of, the well-cultured lady way more lively and more interesting than my expectations, and the stubborn maid who would never cry for sorrow…</em></p><p><em>“The cute Ke who accepted my love confession and wanted five minutes to just laugh, the little elder sister who is always so good at throwing a tantrum, the straightforward Yan Zheke who loves to communicate, and the little fairy who has occupied all my beautiful memories about girls, is now my wife. She will be my wife starting today!”</em></p><p>The change of status gradually caught up with them. Yan Zheke unrolled her eyebrows and smiled at Lou Cheng so beautifully.</p><p>“Mr. Yan, nice to mee you!”</p><p>A huge deal of joy began to roll in his heart. He responded gently,</p><p>“Mrs. Lou, nice to meet you!”</p><p>He couldn’t help giving Yan Zheke a big, tight hug, and he whispered to her ear,</p><p>“Wife, wife, wife…”</p><p>Yan Zheke felt drunk in his voice and replied in a very quiet voice, blushful,</p><p>“Husband…”</p><p>The bright sunshine seemed to last forever.</p><p>They walked out of the building hand-in-hand and got in the back seat of a cab to their dinner destination.</p><p>As the car took off, a song came on the radio.</p><p>“How deep and intense love is enough for two people to promise each other the rest of their life?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
