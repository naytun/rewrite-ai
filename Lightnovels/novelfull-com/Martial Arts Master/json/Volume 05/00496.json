Only the cheers from the crowd were still reverberating throughout the stadium, making the end of this journey even more pleasant to the ears.</p><p>Kaori Karasawa circulated her “Qi” throughout her body as she glowed in a layer of faint light. Carrying her still shivering muscles, she walked slowly down the ring. Her back view was slim and elegant, but appeared to be a little lonely.</p><p>In this match, she was in a passive position throughout. Although she fought intensely for a long time, she still didn’t prove very much of a threat to Peng Leyun. What she had been relying on for a long time, the “Flying Dragon Takedown”, had become her weakness. Until the very end, her enemy was making use of her and targeting her. This was one of the main reasons for her defeat today.</p><p>As this thought struck her, Kaori Karasawa recalled the match between Peng Leyun and Ren Li. Throughout the first half of the match, they didn’t attempt an absolute killer move. It wasn’t that they couldn’t do so but they were wary of attempting it too casually. This was because once they were disturbed while trying to gather momentum, or if their absolute killer move failed to hit the opponent, they would likely expose an opening, giving the opponent a great opportunity.</p><p>“Am I too reliant on “Flying Dragon Takedown”?” This thought flashed through her mind as she looked at the group of members of Japan’s representative group, who were dead silent.</p><p>Since she had mastered “Flying Dragon Takedown”, no matter who she encountered, her opponent would always be wary and try to avoid it. Never did she ever expected to be defeated by something more profound.</p><p>No matter how strong it is, it should still only be used at the most appropriate moment… the most appropriate moment… thought Kaori Karasawa. She started to reflect on herself about various things in the past and concluding her experiences and lessons learned.</p><p>Peng-Leyun, I will try my best to catch up to you!</p><p>I’ll look forward to battling against you soon. The next time, I’ll definitely be bringing my “Fugumaru” along!</p><p>…</p><p>After a series of congratulatory messages and the prize presentation ceremony, Lou Cheng, Peng Leyun and others returned to the hotel.</p><p>At the lobby, Guide Zhang Ningtao clapped his hands and said with a face full of smiles,</p><p>“Congratulations to everyone for exceeding expectations for this mission. For the prize money, we will be consolidating and handling it together. It will be transferred to your account within five working days. Have a good rest tonight. The flight will be at five o’clock in the evening. Do you all want to roam around Fuluo or head straight for the duty free shop in the airport?”</p><p>“I’m okay with both” Ann Chaoyang answered nonchalantly. Peng Leyun was acting exactly the same.</p><p>Ren Li sank into deep thoughts and seemed to be in a dilemma. Lou Cheng took a peek at his phone and suggested, “Let’s walk around Fuluo. Some of the stuff cannot be found in duty free shops.”</p><p>Thanks to the reminder of Coach Yan, he finally recalled that he had to get some gifts for his parents as he was overseas. After an “intense” debate, the list of items had been written out. She even looked through the reviews to find out where would be the best place to get the items.</p><p>Naturally, he had to get a gift for his wife too!</p><p>“Alright, let’s walk around Fuluo then. We will have some time to go to the duty free shops when we arrive at the airport anyway.” Zhang Ningtao quickly made the decision without seeking further comments.</p><p>Not mentioning the shopping, the few of them successfully got on the plane on time and reach the seas of China at night.</p><p>Just before they bade goodbye, Lou Cheng saw Ren Li contacting her pickup employee with WeChat. He suddenly asked curiously,</p><p>“Priest, Hipster. You guys should have given me a nickname right? What is it?”</p><p>Typically speaking, nicknames were reciprocal. There were no reasons only he could give others a nickname!</p><p>After hearing the question, Peng Leyun, Ann Chaoyang and Ren Li took a glance at one another and shook their head in unison.</p><p>“Don’t have one!”</p><p>“Really?” asked Lou Cheng suspiciously.</p><p>“Really!” The three of them all nodded their head with force at the same time.</p><p>Alright, you guys are all obedient kids… Lou Cheng took a look at the time, bade farewell to his unreliable teammates and left the airport. He was heading towards a five-star hotel by Ice God Sect in China.</p><p>After completing his training on the second day, he boarded the high-speed train to pay a visit to his master. After getting some guidance, he took a plane in the afternoon and flew straight to the Xing Province.</p><p>After a long journey, he was finally standing at the door of his house. It was already slightly past seven at night.</p><p>“Eh, where are my parents?” When Lou Cheng entered the house, he only saw his cousin, Qi Yunfei.</p><p>She had remedial lessons during the summer break and would be staying here before the school reopened. In other words, he got to sleep on the sofa for several days again!</p><p>As for Chen Xiaoxiao, she had officially entered the third year of high school and wasn’t here with her sister to cause a mess.</p><p>Qi Yunfei was resting her head on her palms which was placed on top of the sofa. She smiled and answered, “They were talking about something happening in one of the small areas and they are heading there to help. They also asked you to eat first. The dishes haven’t gone cold yet. Also, also, I brought you fried dumplings, a huge bag of them!”</p><p>“Hehe. So you still remember you have a brother.” Lou Cheng put down his bag and sat to the side of the dining table. He opened the wrappings and a strong salivating scent rushed towards him.</p><p>Different from other places, there were only two ways of eating dumplings in Xiushan. One of them was steam and the other was frying them. The former could bring out the original scent of flour very well and was more tender. As for the latter, it would be putting dumplings into oil and fry them till they were golden-yellow. Different from grilled dumplings, the fried dumplings were so delicious that made it hard for one to stop eating.</p><p>Qi Yunfei left the soft and sat opposite to Lou Cheng. With one hand supporting her cheek, she stared at Lou Cheng who was eating one after another fried dumpling. In less than five minutes, a total of forty fried dumplings had vanished.</p><p>Moreover, he wasn’t satisfied yet. He stood up and went to get a bowl. Filling it to the brim, he started sweeping dishes of delicious food in front of him.</p><p>“Brother Lou Cheng, you can really eat…” Qi Yunfei said with a stunned look.</p><p>As compared to when I last saw you, you have become an even bigger eater!</p><p>Lou Cheng placed his chopsticks neatly, clenched his right hand, waved it and said, “Where do you think my strength to beat up people comes from?”</p><p>Speaking of this, Qi Yunfei’s eyes immediately lit up. She opened her mouth and said rather emotionally,</p><p>“Brother Lou Cheng, you are different from the past. Last time, you would always take off your top during the summer!”</p><p>“Of course? I have the supernatural ability of Ice Frost. Should I be afraid of the heat?” Lou Cheng laughed and reply. “Moreover I’m older and know more about decorum now… You look like you are very disappointed?”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah!” Qi Yunfei nodded her head without trying to hide at all. “I was still thinking of taking a few photos of you secretly when you are topless. By then, all the girls in my class would all be so impressed by me!”</p><p>She was smiling ludicrously and was immersed in her imagination.</p><p>Her cousin’s figures could make many girls drool and the number of people admiring him at her level was super huge!</p><p>Lou Cheng’s mouth twitched a little. He switched the topic and said with a face full of smiles,</p><p>“Fei Fei, how are your results for the end of semester examinations?”</p><p>“Twenty-something in the class. Hmph. About thirty-something in the class.”</p><p>What are the subjects that you didn’t do well? I remember you are always extremely afraid of mathematics and physics.” Lou Cheng maintained his smile and continued asking further.</p><p>“Mathematics, I failed in Mathematics. Aiya. Brother Lou Cheng, why are you asking about these?” Qi Yunfei was getting uneasy from these questions.</p><p>As a student who didn’t have good results, she hated such conversation topics.</p><p>“I’m caring for you! I’m your brother!” Lou Cheng answered with a serious look. “How many marks did you get for Mathematics? What about Physics? Chemistry? Have you completed your summer homework?”</p><p>Qi Yunfei laughed embarrassingly, stood up suddenly, rushed towards the bedroom while answering in a soft tone,</p><p>“Brother Lou Cheng, I just remembered that I have something to do. We can talk later!”</p><p>Clang! She had closed the door and was stomping the floor angrily.</p><p>Brother Lou Cheng was too much. Why can’t he just have a normal conversation!</p><p>Lou Cheng picked up his chopsticks satisfactorily and continued his previous actions of sweeping the delicacies in front of him.</p><p>Haha. Still thinking of taking pictures of me secretly? Don’t you know that I’m a conversation stopper?</p><p>After he was full and had enough to drink, he took a photo of the sofa, sent it to Yan Zheke and was “complaining in tears” about having to sleep in the living room for a few days. After some time, Lou Zhisheng and Qi Fang finally came back.</p><p>“It’s the Ding Family. His son got into a car accident and his family is in a mess now,” Qi Fang sighed. “He’s just slightly over thirty. How can he just be gone like this? This is…”</p><p>“Sigh.” Lou Zhisheng heaved a sigh and continued emotionally, “Life is unpredictable. Cheng, you have to be careful when crossing the road in the future. Don’t always look down and play on your phone.”</p><p>Car accident? Even if it is a ten-wheels truck, I might not even suffer any injuries… Lou Sheng thought to himself. In his mind, the image of the son of the Ding Family flashed past.</p><p>He was ten years older than Wang Xu and loved novels a lot. When he was poor during high school, he would borrow some books from him from time to time to read. He had not married all along and just had a successful matchmaking. Who knew that all of this would be gone just like that.</p><p>Life was really fragile…</p><p>I have to enjoy myself to the fullest……</p><p>Although he was emotional for a while, such emotions quickly dissipated as he was an outsider after all. Lou Cheng changed the topic and started chatting with his parents about his first experience going overseas. He also passed them their gifts and had not forgotten about Qi Yunfei’s share.</p><p>He slept and woke up on the dot. After training, he felt that his morphing would be completed soon. It should be within the next day or two!</p><p>After eating his breakfast, Lou Cheng hailed a car and headed to the Yingjin Building of the Pingle District.</p><p>He had made an appointment to meet Wu Qinggui and had confirmed the terms of the contract relating to the bonus — Clinching the National Championship, placed third in the Four Nation Competition and entering the inhuman stage should all have their respective awards.</p><p>This time, Wu Qinggui came directly to the doors of the building to welcome him. With a radiant smile on his face, he asked,</p><p>“You don’t seem to be too fond of shopping right?”</p><p>I’ll still shop when I’m accompanying my wife… Lou Cheng shook his head with a smile and answered, “Rarely. I do internet shopping most of the time.”</p><p>“There’s no wonder that you have not seen the few new direct selling shops that we have opened. Several models of martial arts shoes that we have designed specifically for you are all selling very well. This has helped us open up the market in the district. You might not know about this. In this district, no, not just this district, you are really famous and popular! It is especially so with the teenagers. Every single one of them requested to have the Lou Cheng’s model of martial arts shoes! They are even snatching up the publicity wallpapers of you that we have printed.</p><p>“Is it that far fetched?” Lou Cheng asked.</p><p>Wu Qinggui smiled and answered, “It’s more far fetched than what you can imagine. This is also mainly because you do not have many commercial activities and all their passions are accumulated in this.”</p><p>As they spoke, they entered the office of Wu Qinggui. After the door was closed, a skinny but brilliant middle-aged man took out a check and pushed it towards Lou Cheng.</p><p>This was the first time Lou Cheng saw a check. After taking a peak and counting the number of zeros, he asked surprisingly,</p><p>“One Million?”</p><p>This was substantially higher than the amount stated in the terms of the contract!</p><p>“You deserve it.” Wu Qinggui was smiling radiantly with an “I don’t want to follow the contract” look.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
