All his hair stood up.</p><p>The numbing feeling went away immediately as Bernhard turned to look at Peng Leyun blankly. Mao Chengjun on the other side suffered the same electric shock and experienced shivering in his muscles.</p><p>Peng Leyun chuckled and said,</p><p>“Sorry, I had an emotional wave motion.”</p><p>Due to suffering from a severe internal injury, his supernatural ability of thunder and lightning went out of control as his mood fluctuated.</p><p>“No worries. We are also concerned about the match.” Mao Chengjun understood exactly how Peng Leyun felt upon hearing the word “Start”.</p><p>Listening to them talking, Bernhard could only think of one thing.</p><p>“I was actually struck by the lightning…”</p><p>…</p><p>“Start!”</p><p>Before the referee’s voice vanished in the air, Lou Cheng already lifted his hands and formed a seal in front of his lower stomach despite the pain he was suffering.</p><p>Almost at the same time, an ancient character was sketched in his head, his stomach began to wiggle, and his throat opened up to chant in a low voice,</p><p>“Attainment!”</p><p>A figure in a black-edged white robe broke the air screen and dashed into Fang Zhirong in a flash.</p><p>Fang Zhirong had expected the overwhelming Lou Cheng to take the initiative to unleash his advantages and suppress the rival’s morale. He bent his back into an arch and moved in the manner between a wolf and a snake to avoid the frontal confrontation just in time and turn the match into a guerrilla fight.</p><p>He moved swiftly in a rather strange way, blocking the light and creating a black shadow on the floor.</p><p>The shadow wiggled as he turned and twisted, sending a chill down the audience’s spines.</p><p>Every style of the Dark Sect was intimidating in some way!</p><p>Lou Cheng transformed into the North Wind, chasing with a whistle and shortening the distance between them, fast and agilely.</p><p>His progress had been so rapid that he constantly had many new techniques to learn and master with not much effort to spare on improving his footwork. He still wasn’t close to the Treading Dubhe and Alkaid stage, not to mention catching up with Ren Li.</p><p>He didn’t have enough time to mature and brew.</p><p>A few minutes later, Fang Zhirong, assuming Lou Cheng had thrown away his advantages, suddenly turned and launched a counterstrike, aiming at Lou Cheng’s injured right arm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He tightened his thighs and lifted his knee. His right foot rose slightly above the floor and stamped down at Lou Cheng’s foot.</p><p>In the meanwhile, he exerted strength from his shoulders and threw his left arm out to punch the rival’s right arm along with the tramp.</p><p>A trample plus a punch like a stab in the back!</p><p>Fang Zhirong was taking advantage of the injury in Lou Cheng’s right arm and painful movements.</p><p>Knowing Lou Cheng was capable of forming a suit of Ice Armor for defense, he had made a plan for his following moves. Once his punch broke the crystal ice, he would stretch his five fingers out toward the rival’s heart.</p><p>The mouth of a bamboo snake or the sting of a wasp.</p><p>Before his stamp landed, Lou Cheng, as if having telepathy, pulled his own foot back and turned right to perfectly duck the punch and the trample.</p><p>A master of the Ice Mirror by now, Lou Cheng was able to sense every subtle movement within a radius of dozens of centimeters. Fang Zhirong’s attempts had nowhere to hide.</p><p>Lou Cheng wouldn’t have survived Peng Leyun’s Interlinked Thunder Strikes without this.</p><p>After the duck, a seal was formed in his hands and an ancient character floated in his head.</p><p>All those dashes and chases Lou Cheng had done were on purpose to lure this counter-strike from Fang Zhirong so he could duck with the Ice Mirror and launch a sound attack after.</p><p><em>“Damn it!</em> ” Shocked by Lou Cheng’s response, Fang Zhirong had to quit his move and begin to visualize.</p><p>A faint, ghostly green glow shone in his eyes like a toxic viper, his neck bloated, and his tongue stuck out.</p><p>The Spirit and Vigor Secret Art of the Dark Sect, Nightmare!</p><p>“Army!”</p><p>As the mysterious ancient sound flew out, a bloody, evil feeling of a massive war invaded Fang Zhirong’s heart. He shivered with fear, his courage collapsing and his body becoming sluggish.</p><p>With a very peremptory, powerful determination and his familiarity with the Spirit and Vigor Secret Art of the Dark Sect, Lou Cheng quickly recovered after a brief shiver and visualized the Forwarding Formula.</p><p>Instead of calling the spell out loud to attempt a full recovery, he suppressed the impact through the visualization and grabbed the rare opportunity to slide forward and launch a left pound at the rival’s chest.</p><p>An acute pain suddenly woke Fang Zhirong up. He immediately struggled to make a Force Concentration and put all his thoughts aside. Pulling back his blood and qi, force, and spirit, he curled up to form a ball on the floor and dodged Lou Cheng’s mountain-shattering pound.</p><p>The squat was followed closely by a bounce. Fang Zhirong ignited his Dan force and threw his body out fiercely, as if firing a cannon towards Lou Cheng’s vital part.</p><p>However, Lou Cheng had quickly withdrawn his fist, pulled back his blood and qi, and gathered them at his lower stomach like a well-experienced fighter.</p><p>Bam! His muscles bloated and right leg tightened into a whip, cracking towards Fang Zhirong’s lifted arm.</p><p>Dong!</p><p>A dull sound came out when Fang Zhirong, who was floating in the air, was kicked out like a football.</p><p>Lou Cheng drew in a deep breath and performed another explosion. His feet pushed the ground, sending his body out like a bomber after Fang Zhirong.</p><p>Following two loud bangs, Fang Zhirong, who was struggling to stabilize his body on the floor, saw the rival approaching rapidly, pulling back, and then releasing his qi and blood. The muscles on his opponent’s left arm were bloated and a fist shot out.</p><p>Great Snowslide Triple Explosions!</p><p>Suppressed in every possible way, Fang Zhirong felt like his every movement had been predicted by the rival. He dared not take it lightly and hurried to visualize a turbine spinning inside his body like crazy, boosting the pressure.</p><p>Bam! Every muscle of his was suffering an excessive accumulation of blood, making his body taller and bigger. His right fist punched out with supreme force.</p><p>The Turn of Two Ends of the Magnetism Sect, the Magnetic Field Spinning!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Airwaves rolled and rocked as the dark blue vessels stood out on their fists. Their muscles roused even more.</p><p>In a flash, Lou Cheng’s body began to shiver, blending techniques of the 24 Blizzard Strikes into the Force Concentration and once again pulling back his blood and qi and spirit.</p><p>It left Fang Zhirong no other option but to make another Dan stage explosion; otherwise, he would be swallowed by the Brutal Blizzard.</p><p>Bam! The muscles on Lou Cheng’s right leg bloated, kicking his foot out.</p><p>The fourth consecutive explosion!</p><p>Bam! Fang Zhirong confronted him with a whip kick passively.</p><p>Pong! The dull sound made by his leg was instantly followed by another explosion as Lou Cheng tramped the floor with the tip of his foot and dashed forth sideways, relying on his advantageous physical strength.</p><p>His terrifying strikes were so overwhelming, as if he intended to crush Fang Zhirong once for all.</p><p>Fang Zhirong had to respond with his second explosion. His body bloated, his feet touched each other, and his body leaned forward.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The bump was deep and loud. Fang Zhirong swayed and fell back.</p><p>He felt numb on his scalp and immediately pulled back his blood and qi, stabilizing his body and getting into a defensive stance.</p><p>Lou Cheng, like an endless snowstorm, withdrew his blood and qi and then made the Quintuple Explosion mightily while his right foot stepped forward, aiming at the enemy’s knee.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As their insteps hit, their martial arts shoes scattered into the air like hundreds of butterflies.</p><p>Fang Zhirong knew that he couldn’t let this continue. He was someone who focused on the use of poison because his physical strength was weaker than that of his peers of the same rank. He claimed to be an inferior Seventh Pin fighter, but he was merely able to complete the Quintuple Explosion in a row, while the overwhelming rival seemed capable of performing eight continuously. If they continued like this, he would be very close to his doom.</p><p>Unconsciously, his heart was suppressed by Lou Cheng’s presence and his spirit was affected.</p><p>“Fight!” Fang Zhirong clenched his teeth and touched the floor with the tip of his feet, taking the initiative to make the fourth Force Concentration.</p><p>It was immediately followed by his left hand with five fingers spread wide and green veins bulging outward, reaching out to grab Lou Cheng’s right arm.</p><p>His fingers bore a ghostly, faint, green glow which would cause dizziness and nausea.</p><p>The Dark Sect ‘s Dark Poison Force!</p><p>Normally, the launch of a Dan stage explosion along with the use of a sect force would be considered a great strike, which usually could only be performed by martial artists in the Inhuman stage. However, Fang Zhirong’s toxin was stored within his body and inside his fingers so that he could fuse it into his Dan stage explosion. Though this mave had te risk of a possible boomerang effect.</p><p>At that crucial moment, he made that killer move at the cost of his own health in hopes of turning the tide.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As soon as Fang Zhirong reached out with his left hand, he realized that something was off from a very brief delay in Lou Cheng’s Brutal Blizzard.</p><p>Instead of completing another explosion, Lou Cheng lifted his hands and formed a seal!</p><p>He had read the target of Fang Zhirong’s desperate move through his Ice Mirror telepathy and decided to take a reckless counterstrike.</p><p>Crack! With horrible fear, Fang Zhirong’s fingers broke the ice armor on Lou Cheng’s right arm, tore his sleeve, and planted poison in his body.</p><p>Although stunned by sudden physical weakness and mental weariness, Lou Cheng managed to keep his face straight and began to chant in a low voice,</p><p>“Army!”</p><p>Once the qi of blood and evil invaded his head, Fang Zhirong lost his consciousness, trembling with fear as if surrounded by enemies.</p><p>As the Dark Poison Force crept in, Lou Cheng’s internal injury from the earlier thunder strikes was triggered, resulting in his body and mind weakening extremely fast and his capability of performing the Dan stage explosions decreasing.</p><p>He struggled to make one last Force Concentration, suppressing influences from all aspects, turning them into the Dan force, and flowing it into his left arm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>With such a short distance between them, his fist reached out like lightning and stopped right before Fang Zhirong’s throat before he could recover.</p><p>The referee raised his right hand and announced loudly,</p><p>“Round Three, Lou Cheng wins!”</p><p>Lou Cheng had fought fiercely in this round and exhausted himself to the ultimate extreme. Despite the worsening injury in his right arm, he had managed to keep the entire fight under his control thanks to the Ice Mirror and the new tempo change technique he had just learned from Peng Leyun. Fang Zhirong had no chance to shine or to perform his newly mastered skills of the Plague Sect, Dark Sect, or Magnetism Sect.</p><p>Lou Cheng was completely overwhelming on the stage!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>He felt entirely free from worry, physically and mentally, and his fighting will rose up high. He could restrain himself no longer and let out another long shout like a response to the earlier one.</p><p>“Yes! I made it!”</p><p>As his shout echoed in the air, he turned to the Shanbei University Martial Arts Club’s seating area. His eyes, which were like burning torches, locked on to Xu Wannian.</p><p>Once their eyes met, Xu Wannian shivered unconsciously just like how he would shake during every urination.</p><p>“Next!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
