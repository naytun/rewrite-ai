He revealed a smile and mumbled to himself in a low voice,</p><p>“Great!”</p><p>When Lou Cheng easily defeated Baco in the third round of the double-elimination matches, his confidence had actually shaken slightly. This was unforgivable. In the traditions of “Extreme Hadouken”, there was no room for cowardice. He had to make amends immediately and win against him in battle. Now that I’m matched with Lou Cheng, this is just as I wish!</p><p>I will be using this victory to erase the “blight” in me!</p><p>Moreover this can even help me to complete the secret mission!</p><p>A researcher with messy hair, who was standing beside Mouko Yamashita, adjusted his spectacles and beamed with delight. Sakata Ichiei and the rest of the members were all filled with anticipation. There were even some of them showing fervour who shouted,</p><p>“Mouku kun, it’s time to show “Extreme Hadou Sect” to the world!”</p><p>Since the start of the competition, Mouko Yamashita’s luck in the draw had been great. He had not met any strong opponents and wasn’t able to fully demonstrate the dominance of “Extreme Hadou Sect”. Moreover with Sakata Ichiei and other disciples were eliminated one after another, the sect had lost some respect from others.</p><p>Facing the request, Mouko Yamashita straightened his back, nodded his head with a serious face and continued,</p><p>“Alright (Hai)!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Mouko Yamashita?” Lou Cheng was stunned for a second. He laughed in self-mockery and continued, “This luck is really bad!”</p><p>To meet one at inhuman stage at the round of sixteen!</p><p>With regards to the draws, he wasn’t surprised nor disappointed at all. In the round of sixteen, they still followed the rules where contestants from the same country would not meet. Excluding himself and the other three, there were twelve other options. Among which, there were a total of five at the inhuman stage. The probability of drawing them was almost half. On his way to the Shengxiang Stadium, he had already made the mental preparations to face a strong enemy!</p><p>Not waiting for Peng Leyun, Ann Chaoyang and Ren Li to open their mouth, Lou Cheng lowered his head, looked at his phone, and said to Yan Zheke with a [crying from laughing expression],</p><p>“I got matched with another tiger (note: Literal interpretation of Yamashita is “Fierce Tiger”)…..”</p><p>“Schrodinger Tiger Vs the Wild Tiger from the mountains… My money is on the Quantum Physics Sciencers!” Yan Zheke made her replies very quickly. It was as though she was taking her phone out from time to time to check if the results from the draw were out. She “scratched her head” and said, “If you were drawn against him a few days ago, I’m definitely would not be confident. However you have undergone morphing over the past two days. I have high hopes for you! [pat on shoulder expression]”</p><p>“In that case, I must not let your hopes down! [Motivated expression]” replied Lou Cheng</p><p>Frankly speaking, he did have some confidence. He was even interested to give it a try!</p><p>Mouko Yamashita only managed to create “Ha” in May and advanced in level. His standards were at least half a step lower than Veigar. I could even fight Veigar to that extent before my morphing. How hard could it be now?</p><p>Over the last two days, using the current lingo to describe my strength would be: It’s rising even when I’m drinking water!</p><p>After replying, he seemed to feel something. He raised his head and found Peng Leyun, Ren Li, Ann Chaoyang and Zhong Ningtao were all looking at him.</p><p>“What’s the matter?” asked Lou Cheng puzzedly.</p><p>“I was thinking of giving you some encouragement or even some consolation words. However looking at you now, it seems that there’s nothing much I have to say.,” laughed Peng Leyun.</p><p>This dude was happy playing with his phone and full of smiles. He didn’t need our encouragement or whatsoever!</p><p>Ann Chaoyang “opened” his eyes and nodded his head at the same time as Ren Li.</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed shyly and pointed to the ring.</p><p>“They are drawing the second group now.”</p><p>For this group, Veigar was matched with an unseeded contestant who was also not a wild card contestant.</p><p>Using the break in between, Lou Cheng looked at the screen again and made his replies. At this moment, he saw “Talker” sent him a message:</p><p>“I heard that you will be going against an inhuman soon?”</p><p>“How do you know?” Lou Cheng replied with a [Shocked Expression].</p><p>I don’t think I talked about the four countries competition to student Xiao Ming. We have just been talking about random things for the last few days.</p><p>“I suddenly felt like visiting your forum and found that you have been handed over to the nation and are taking part in some “King of Youth Pro League”. You are even matched against a Japanese expert, Mouko Yamashita, who is at the inhuman stage… Is there some animosity between you and his parents?” said Cai Zongming. ” I’m here specifically to tell you something and to console you for meeting a strong opponent.”</p><p>“What do you want to say?” Lou Cheng replied casually without thinking.</p><p>Cai Zongming replied,</p><p>“[Sinister smile expression] You must persevere!”</p><p>“Scram!” Lou Cheng replied in a clear and concise way but still couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>As time passed, the third group was drawn. Banam’s luck was great and he was matched with an unseeded contestant who was also not a wild card contestant. After a short while, the guest started to draw the line-up for the fourth group. He shouted the name of Peng Leyun.</p><p>The atmosphere at the other representative group changed slightly and was slightly tense. Without letting them guessed for too long, the guest grabbed the next round ball, took a look at it showed it to the crowd and said,</p><p>“Shengxiang, Wahku!”</p><p>The third seed, “Arhat” Wahku!</p><p>“Great…” Peng Leyun lazy expression corrected and a lightning-like light shimmered in his eyes. It seemed that he was looking forward to an opponent of this level for a very long time!</p><p>Lou Cheng and the rest didn’t speak too much and only pitied Veigar for three seconds.</p><p>It’s finally your turn to witness who’s the real devil!</p><p>At the place of the representative group of Shengxiang, Wahku stood upright with his chest forward. His expression was still sad and full of hatred. The expressions on the other members around had all became worse.</p><p>After that, another guest drew the match-up for the other four groups. Ren Li continued with her good luck and would be facing an unseeded contestant who was also not holding a wild card just like Veigar and Banam.</p><p>In the live thread, the place had erupted after Lou Cheng was drawn against an inhuman expert. Everyone was commenting fervently and arguing incessantly.</p><p>“Unparalleled Dragon King” said with a [joking expression], “Don’t worry, Lou Cheng’s chances in this match aren’t small. Even if it wasn’t half, he should still have about thirty percent. Think about it, he almost defeated Veigar and what’s more, it’s Mouku Yamashita who is weaker. As long as he has the same performance as when he defeated Baco, I wouldn’t say he has no chances of winning!”</p><p>However the feeling when fighting someone weaker than you and someone who is one stage stronger than you will definitely be different. Lou Cheng probably couldn’t replicate the smooth and fluent performance.” The “Pig-Riding Knight” pointed out the problem with that argument and received the recognition from the “road to the arena” and the rest.</p><p>“Invincible Punch” was more inclined to agree with “Unparalleled Dragon King’s” judgement.</p><p>“When Lou Cheng fought with Veigar, he also had a performance above his norm!”</p><p>“It’s different from that time. He had something new at that time. The “Army” Formula can be considered unexpected which caused Veigar to have miscalculated. As for now, everyone more or less has a good grasp of what Lou Cheng had. When facing an inhuman, it will be very hard for him to clinch the initiative and create chances,” A Plumber Eating Mushroom” commented.</p><p>“You aren’t wrong but it still goes back to that old question. Mouko Yamashita is weaker than Veigar. Taking a discount on both sides, Lou Cheng still has his chances!” Unparalleled Dragon King” insisted on his own views.</p><p>“Eternal Nightfall” Yan Xiaoling continued,</p><p>“[Observing in the Dark expression] What you all are saying all have good reasons… I choose to go and die. No, I meant to pray. Make a wish!”</p><p>“I support Xiao Long! Oh right, did anyone of you go and inform “All-knowing Man in Ganghood” to be prepared to delete his account. It will take at most three months!””Brahman” was using this to relieve the uneasiness and nervousness in her heart.</p><p>“I had already tagged him. Don’t have to thank me for that. I’m a young pioneer!””Okamoto’s Fan” replied with an “evil smile”.</p><p>At this very moment, “All-knowing Man in Ganghood” was browsing the videos of the first few battles of the four countries competition. His face got paler as he watched.</p><p>“It will at most be two months…””It’s about time to direct the traffic to my public account. When I have to delete my WeChat account, it wouldn’t be a big deal. In the worst case, I can just start a secondary account!”</p><p>Yeah, I better make the best of my time. Otherwise, Lou Cheng might have broken through before I redirected my followers.</p><p>…</p><p>8 o’clock that night, the representative groups walked out from their changing rooms respectively and returned to their original location.</p><p>Mouko Yamashita was resting both of his hands on his knees and remained seated while waiting. When the referee had arrived, he stood up suddenly like a mountain towering over the others.</p><p>“Mouku kun, it’s all on you now!” The researcher with messy hair bowed at him from the side.</p><p>Mouko Yamashita nodded his head slightly in response.</p><p>The sequence of the draw had Lou Cheng in front, so he had no choice but to give up on the white dojo suit he wore for karate and changed into the reserved red attire.</p><p>As he was about to walk towards the ring, he suddenly noticed the beautiful Kaori Karasawa from the edge of his eyes. She was standing at a position parallel to his position and her sweet and low voice transmitted to his ears.</p><p>“Are you really going to do as they say?”</p><p>Hmph? Mouko Yamashita showed a puzzled face and looked to the side.</p><p>Kaori Karasawa was looking straight and her voice went straight to Yamashita without spreading,</p><p>“This would be an insult to martial arts. As long as you appear, you got to respect your opponent. Moreover Lou Cheng isn’t weak. Are you really going to extract “materials” in a hurry? You might very well lose to him then. Mouku-kun, go all out and defeat him first before seeing if there’s another way.”</p><p>Mouku Yamashita maintained silence for a while and didn’t reply. He took huge strides and walked towards the stone steps with frightening momentum.</p><p>After walking two or three steps ahead, he nodded his head very slightly while back facing Kaori Karasawa.</p><p>…</p><p>After taking a look at the electronic clock, Lou Cheng also stood up. He took the initiative to do a fist bump with every single one of them and receive various encouragement words of “All the best!”.</p><p>At this moment, the special reminder music also sounded. He picked it up and took a look at the oven photo sent by Yan Zheke. Inside it was a cake and other things. The color indicated that it was slightly burnt and it was oddly shaped.</p><p>“Cough, I have taken time to practise this!” said Yan Zheke.</p><p>“Therefore, what you wanted to say is ‘All the best, I’m waiting for you to come back and have it’?” Lou Cheng helped her to complete her hidden words with smiles.</p><p>Yan Zheke replied,</p><p>“[Thumbs up expression], You know me the best and all the best!”</p><p>“Victory!” Lou Cheng shouted out the slogan and exited QQ. Switching back to the live thread page, he threw the phone to Ann Chaoyang and laughed,</p><p>“Photograph me in a way that makes me look better!”</p><p>After speaking, he walked confidently to the ring. There wasn’t fear but only battle will!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
