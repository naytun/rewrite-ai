As soon as I was done today, this idea popped out, but I didn’t have time to shop around. I searched online and bought these…”</p><p>Listening to her ex-boyfriend and current husband, Yan Zheke’s eyes became watery and the corners of her mouth curved upward. She felt a little bit shy and lowered her head subconsciously, looking at the osmanthus pie, matsutake jam, and local special fruits.</p><p>From the corner of her eye, she saw another bag in Lou Cheng’s left hand. Smart as she was, she easily changed the topic.</p><p>“This is for your parents?”</p><p>“Yeah…. My mom was complaining about me going to Linbian without a word over the phone. Yesterday, I told her I really missed her cooking, but today I couldn’t go home in time for dinner,” answered Lou Cheng with a smile.</p><p>He had bought two of everything.</p><p>“You told your mom you were going to Linbian?” asked Yan Zheke, surprised.</p><p>“A quick mention. I told her my master sent me to take care of a minor matter and promised to come back quickly.” Lou Cheng paused to find the right words. “That was what I thought. Linbian isn’t the safest place compared to Songcheng and Huahai, but nothing serious happens there most of the time.”</p><p>He didn’t have time to explain everything on the phone. Now he found it necessary to tell her everything as they were married and were responsible for each other’s futures. His life was no longer just his.</p><p>“You don’t have to tell me this. I’m not blaming you.” Yan Zheke bit her bottom lip gently, her voice caring and loving. “You have officially become a disciple of your master and a member of a faction, so of course you’ll have to deal with all sorts of tasks. Many relatives of mine are from the Shushan Study. Such things take place often. Usually, tasks from the faction are simple and safe. If a task can’t be done by a disciple at the body refining stage, it will be given to a Dan stage member. If it still can’t be completed, a capable disciple at the Inhuman stage will be assigned. If he fails, a Mighty One with Physical Invulnerability will be put on the task. In case it is not safe for a Mighty One with Physical Invulnerability, they probably won’t insist on doing this mission.</p><p>“When you told me you were heading to Linbian for a minor faction matter, I was concerned about the bad reputation about public security in the city. That’s why I told you to not pull back in case of an emergency. I didn’t want you to wreck in a ditch. I do worry about you, but I’m fine with it.</p><p>“Then the minor matter became more serious, which was beyond your control. You told me immediately and acted with caution and confidence…”</p><p>Yan Zheke suddenly paused, her lips pouting and nose twitching, and began to sob,</p><p>“Ahh… I can’t continue!”</p><p>Her eyes turned red. “I understand all this, but I can’t help feeling bad when things happen. I was very, very worried. When your second call rang, I was so afraid it might be from someone else, calling to inform me of something bad… I was so scared…”</p><p>She stopped her whining and locked her eyes on Lou Cheng with some attitude, her teeth grinding.</p><p>“Cheng, let me bite you!”</p><p>Lou Cheng was very touched by her sudden, true sentiment revelation. Thinking about her concerns, his heart ached for her. He responded in his softest voice,</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>Yan Zheke took one step forward and buried her head in Lou Cheng’s shoulder, her lips open and teeth showing above Lou Cheng’s collarbone.</p><p>Lou Cheng relaxed his muscles and stopped his instinctive responses, preparing for a hard bite.</p><p>However, no pain came to him but a gentle nibble on his skin, which soon turned into a warm kiss.</p><p>“I can’t bite you…” said Yan Zheke without raising her head.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s heart missed a beat and the bag fell out of his hand. He lifted the girl with both hands, caressing his wife’s back and hair. He then lowered his head and kissed her head.</p><p>Yan Zheke kept her head in Lou Cheng’s shoulder and opened her mouth,</p><p>“I know even the simplest task could go wrong and lead to danger. I can’t lock you at home or chain you up. I can’t forbid you from everything… I hope you can be more careful in the future and make your decision after figuring out all the details. Don’t take risks. Act only when you are absolutely confident. Tell me more if time allows so I can be more comfortable… Don’t try to be tough in front of difficulties. Leave when you need to and seek aid from the sect when necessary.”</p><p>“I promise.” Lou Cheng nodded solemnly.</p><p>Yan Zheke remained silent for a few seconds and then heaved a sigh.</p><p>“If my health was better, I could reach the Dan stage and do these things with you. We could be like my grandparents. I really envy them…”</p><p>“Every couple has a different story, and we can’t force ourselves into others’ shoes.” Lou Cheng thought about it and tried to comfort his wife. “If you did accompany me on such missions, I would be unable to remain calm and would be worried about you all the time. I wouldn’t perform as well.”</p><p>The darkness fell slowly and the moon rose. The pair hugged and talked, sharing their deep feelings.</p><p>Seven or eight minutes later, Yan Zheke resumed her normal mood and pushed Lou Cheng away. Happiness filled up her eyes.</p><p>“Go back and eat. I can hear your tummy roaring!”</p><p>“Yeah. Let me walk you back first.” Lou Cheng flushed.</p><p>“No need. It’s just a few steps away.” Yan Zheke bounced backward, her skirt flying up.</p><p>She stopped after two steps and turned around to look at Lou Cheng with a smile hiding behind her hand.</p><p>“Cheng, for a second, I thought you would try to take me out on a date before sending me home.”</p><p>“For a second, I did think about it, but someone didn’t bite me earlier. I must take good care of her.” Lou Cheng chuckled. “However, Empress Dowager and your dear father are waiting for you. Picking up a gift can’t take three hours. How would they think of me?”</p><p>“That’s right. If you told your mom you would be a few more hours late and would rather have something outside, she would slap your face.” Yan Zheke poked fun at him.</p><p>Lou Cheng shook his head and laughed. “I remember someone saying she didn’t like that every date led towards that direction. Spiritual connection is just as important. Taking a stroll, chatting, watching TV shows and programs, and doing homework are also nice. I felt you weren’t very happy in Songcheng, but you gave in at last.”</p><p>“It’s not that I’m not happy or not into it… Phew! I don’t like it at all!” Yan Zheke threw a glare at Lou Cheng, shy but splendid. “As you said, girls care about other things besides sexual things. I thought we were just married and you were very thirsty… I guess that was why I agreed to do it.”</p><p>“Also, we will part very soon. And we have left it to God.”</p><p>“Even now I’m tempted.”</p><p>“Maybe every girl has this irrational side…”</p><p>They waved at each other after some more talking. Lou Cheng watched her elegantly walking into the estate and then returned home with the gift.</p><p>“Finally! Your father and I ate already. I’ll heat it up for you.” Qi Fang stood up from the couch. She hadn’t even thought about waiting for her son to eat together.</p><p><em>“My real mother…”</em> Lou Cheng handed over the bag and put on a bright smile.</p><p>“Mom, Dad, I got you something from Linbian.”</p><p>“My son, you went for business but managed to buy us something?” Qi Fang’s smile was brilliant.</p><p>Lou Zhisheng asked in a reserved manner, “Why did your sect send you to Linbian today? It didn’t take you long.”</p><p>“A minor matter. They needed someone to show up. Just for a few minutes,” answered Lou Cheng vaguely.</p><p>As Qi Fang took over the bag, she casually commented, “Linbian is not a safe place. Why did your master send you there?”</p><p>“Not bad. Our government is very strict. Linbian’s public security is not the best, but how bad can it be? It’s actually pretty safe as long as I don’t go to crowded places or dark allies and don’t make trouble. Otherwise, how do residents there live?” responded Lou Cheng with a sneer.</p><p>“Hmm…” Qi Fang didn’t say more. Dishes were reheated and served. Lou Cheng devoured it all before his parents’ eyes.</p><p>“When you went to Linbian, your dad was worried. He was watching their local TV station earlier.” Qi Fang made fun of Lou Zhisheng.</p><p>“It was by chance.” Lou Zhisheng coughed it off.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s heart was warm and his appetite just got better.</p><p>The family sat together happily. The news came along but disappeared in their chats and laughter.</p><p>“Linbian TV news. This afternoon, a serious gun-related crime took place in the Linfu Building at the Jiuxing junction…”</p><p>“… The case has been solved and the main suspects Si Jianting and Huang Chengda have been arrested…”</p><p>…</p><p>Lou Cheng returned to his room after dinner and turned on his computer, looking for videos from this afternoon.</p><p>Fortunately, he was very efficient to get it done in under two minutes. Most people on site didn’t have the chance to respond. It was a horrifying scene that not many dared to approach, so only a few blurry photos were uploaded.</p><p>“Hmm… Even my mom can’t tell it is me…” Lou Cheng laughed and felt relieved.</p><p>With pressure from the sect, this news couldn’t grow into something bigger.</p><p>Right before he closed the page, a QQ message came in from Wonton Seller.</p><p>“Tiger, did you check the group message? We are meeting up in Huacheng on the 15th. Are you coming?”</p><p>Huacheng, where the Longhu Club was located.</p><p>“Err… I don’t think so,” replied Lou Cheng after some thinking.</p><p><em>“I used to be very interested in meeting them one year ago. But in the past one year, I rarely said anything on the forum and didn’t talk much with anyone. It would be awkward to meet a group of strangers.”</em></p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
