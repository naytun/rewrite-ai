Beads of perspiration were almost dripping down from his face.</p><p>Having such an abnormal reaction, he could already imagine the astonishment, the conjectures and the accusations of others on him!</p><p>What was originally perfectly hidden was exposed right in the face of all the audience!</p><p>His reputation would no doubt dive off of a cliff!</p><p>Gusai’s eyes were lost, reflecting the pool of red that was thrown out from the referee’s mouth. He felt as though he was possessed by a demon previously that made him took part in such a force!</p><p>What was more unacceptable was that he still lost. He had no excuse not to defend himself and no right to feel angry about it. At the last moments, Lou Cheng demonstrated strength that was more terrifying than what he usually did together with the “Fighting” Formula!</p><p>Haha. He suddenly felt like laughing. He wanted to laugh at the unfounded hopes, laugh at that desire, laugh at everything in the world and laugh at his greed.</p><p>“Not good! Has Gusai gone crazy?” Seeing the changes in the expression of that fat monk on the large screen, the audience in the stadium gradually understood what happened and revealed shocked looks. They suspected Gusai had gone mad from the beating from Lou Cheng and that he had completely collapsed afterwards.</p><p>Wahku raised his eyebrows and was in the ring in just a few strides. Clenching his right hand, he hit Gusai, who was not putting up any defence and panting profusely while laughing, in the back of his head. Gusai was knocked unconscious and was dragged and carried to the emergency treatment room.</p><p>From the looks of it, he didn’t understand the illusions around him, thus giving rise to his disgust for the world. He seemed more like he had taken the extreme path and was blinded by the “sky devil”. He had to be stopped immediately or he might really become crazy!</p><p>Seeing people walking past him combined with the things that had happened, the face of the guide of the Shengxiang representative team gradually turned pale as though he had contracted some severe illness or suffered grave injuries.</p><p>With things developed till this stage, he could already foresee his own outcome, the punishment he would receive, and the tragic events that would be happening to him.</p><p>You can’t even win against Lou Cheng with the help of the referee. Gusai, you are useless, useless!</p><p>It’s okay if you are useless. You even implicated me!</p><p>…</p><p>“What has happened?” In the live thread, “Eternal Nightfall” Yan Xiaoling asked with [Picking Petals from Flowers expression].</p><p>“I didn’t watch a lot of matches so please don’t lie to me. Since when does the referee get injured too?”</p><p>“I suspect I have watched a rigged match…””Unparalleled Dragon King” gave the same response.</p><p>“Pig-Riding Knight” wiped his cold sweat and said, “Yeah. Although the battle between inhuman stage experts couldn’t be compared with matches between physical invulnerability stage experts, referees might occasionally suffer a certain level of side effects from trying to stop lethal strikes of both parties. It shouldn’t reach the point where the referee would throw up blood! What the hell is going on?”</p><p>As the saying went, if abnormalities were common, there must be something wrong in it!</p><p>For competitions between inhumans, since the control of both parties had reached a new level, only those who were near the level of Physical Invulnerability Stage would require senior experts to be referees. Under normal circumstances, a battle between five pins would just need a four pin. For matches between four pins, someone at the same level would do. After all, physical invulnerability experts were all figures of an area and wouldn’t become a referee casually.</p><p>“This is still the first time that I’ve seen someone injuring his opponent together with the referee. He’s indeed a monster beast that came from M78 galaxy!””Road to the Arena” [laughed till tears expression].</p><p>“Invincible Punch” [Held His Chin With His Hands expression] and said, “Could it be that the referee had some injuries before the match? Subsequently, he was affected by the stacking of the shockwave caused by “Emperor Yan Force” and the flames, caused him to not be able to suppress his injuries further?”</p><p>“How could it be? It isn’t that they couldn’t find another referee? If he was injured, they just have to find someone to replace him.,” retorted “A Plumber Eating Mushroom”. “With the micro-control an inhuman had over his own body, how would he not have known if he was injured and how serious his injuries were?”</p><p>“There must be some dirty transactions in it!””Okamoto’s Fan” used the expression of Beethoven to show his expression.</p><p>At this moment, “Unparalleled Dragon King” who had been silent for a while, commented, “I just went to check on the information on the referee and discovered that his supernatural ability was very interesting. Translating will give “Resonance”. Whenever his opponents collide with him, they will also suffer the same feelings he felt. In other words, his opponent would take a certain percentage of recoil.”</p><p>“Eh, that sounds a little fishy… Since “Resonance” can transmit blows and damages, can it also transmit positive effects? For example, an increment in power and mental strength?” guessed “Pig-Rider Knight”.</p><p>“You found the right train of thoughts! [Detective Conan Pointing Ahead expression]” replied “Unparalleled Dragon King”. “That is also what I thought. The referee was helping Gusai with “Resonance”, hoping that Gusai could achieve the third position. In the end, who would have expected Lou Cheng to completely erupt and injure Gusai? At that moment, his “Resonance” wasn’t cut off in time. As a result, he suffered the damages of the after effects. There’s no way why he would suddenly throw out blood for no good reason!”</p><p>“Ya, ya, ya. That’s so dirty!””Brahman” scored perfect in reading comprehension.</p><p>“Aren’t the people of Shengxiang too shameless? Disregarding the rigged lots drawing, they even bribed the referee to help!” Facing such an unfair incident, “Above The Sky” said with indignation.</p><p>“Scheming! They knew that Lou Cheng has the supernatural ability to reflect curses and therefore couldn’t deal with him directly and found a referee that could help Gusai instead. If they won, they just have to claim that Theravada has a unique skill of achieving an explosion in mental strength. One wouldn’t be able to tell at all just from the video. Lou Cheng would also not suspect it. No one would have really known! [Fist Hitting Table expression]” said “A Plumber Eating Mushroom”.</p><p>“I have seen shameless people but have never seen anyone this shameless!”</p><p>“The trend in Nanyang had always been very dirty…”</p><p>“I believed that the forum in Japan must have the same conjecture, claiming that Shengxiang, Miluo and Nanzheng are all cheating in the lots. With the precedent of bribing referees, together with their ruthless personalities and dark skin, they would not entertain them anymore in the future.”</p><p>“Haha, Lou Cheng won despite going against the two of them. He even made the referee throw up blood and exposed this incident. That feels so great, so great! I’ll like to see how Shengxiang will deal with the international critiques?”</p><p>“What’s there for them to be afraid of? No one respects them, what are they afraid of?”</p><p>“We still win despite all this, great!”</p><p>…</p><p>Ridicule, indignation and emotional comments popped out like flowers blooming after the rain, making the live thread very lively. However since Lou Cheng clinched the victory “against two of them”, severely injuring his opponent and the referee and finally revealed this incident to the eyes of the audience, everyone wasn’t feeling as bottled up and angry about the incident.</p><p>“I finally understand what you guys are talking about… So infuriating! I want to complain, go on protest!” Yan Xiaoling finally became clear of what had happened after staying behind reading for a long time. “Besides, besides, besides, my muse is really cool!”</p><p>“Eh, Lou Cheng has been promoted to your muse? Indeed, not everyone could win when fighting against two at the same time! Over the past ten years, he is the first person that made the referee throw up blood!””Unparalleled Dragon King heaved a sigh before continuing, “I believe it will be pointless even if you go on protest. Shengxiang will definitely not admit to it. Let’s just wait and see how they will explain this, how strange their explanation will be!”</p><p>“I guess they couldn’t just claim that the referee was injured by Lou Cheng’s fart?””Okamato’s Fan” replied with the always suitable [Joking expression].</p><p>Everyone had their views and Lou Cheng was blurred by what had gone on behind him. He had fought so many matches, watched so many battle videos and yet he had never seen the referee throwing up blood. Who would have expected he would be part of one such fight today.</p><p>Strange… He frowned slightly and thought about it while walking back to the spectator stand.</p><p>“Awesome huh, you even won against “two”!” Peng Leyun extended his fist and fist bumped with him.</p><p>One against “two”. It was until now that Lou Cheng suddenly understood. “The referee was helping Gusai in the dark? No wonder his “Six Paths of Reincarnation Punch” suddenly got so formidable!”</p><p>I apologise, “Priest” and “Hipster” aren’t unreliable…</p><p>“‘Six Paths of Reincarnation Punch’ suddenly got strong? That referee definitely was helping!” said Ann Chaoyang as he felt he completed the whole train of evidence.</p><p>“Let’s go surround them. Yeah, surround that referee and ask for an explanation!” Light shimmered in the eyes of Ren Li as she was anxious to try it out.</p><p>“You guys don’t create a fuss out of this matter. I will protest to the officials and ask our ambassadors to represent us!” Zhong Ningtao immediately tried to calm down the “Heavenly Sons of the Era”. If they were to really go berserk, they were just like a moving ammunition depot.</p><p>Moreover Lou Cheng even won. At this moment, there wasn’t much anger in their heart. Instead, they felt great about it.</p><p>Who asked you guys to scheme against me? Look! See what kind of troubles you got yourself into! To go for wool and come home shorn!</p><p>Gusai, so what if there are people helping you. Didn’t I win too? Moreover, I was just dragging it most of the time!</p><p>He felt angry but it was hilarious at the same time. Shaking his head, he said,</p><p>“Guide, I’ll leave this to you. I want to see what reasons Shengxiang will give.”</p><p>What he was more worried and afraid of now was what he experienced in the “Rotations of Life”. He couldn’t wait and quickly got his phone back from Ann Chaoyang and unlocked it.</p><p>Yan Zheke had already sent him a [Dog with Dumbfounded Face expression].</p><p>“Cheng, what happened in the end? Why do I not understand it?… You’ve crushed Gusai with just two punches… and the referee even threw up blood…”</p><p>“The referee might have been helping Gusai in the dark and therefore probably suffered the after effects.” Lou Cheng quickly glossed over this incident and started talking about what he experienced in that “instance of ten years”. After completing his words, he still felt a little weary and said, “Looking back now, I’m still afraid of that type of regret…”</p><p>Is a form of unexplainable heartache.</p><p>Yan Zheke was looking seriously but broke into a laugh. She was laughing at the fear of stupid Cheng and chided,</p><p>“[Knock Your Head expression] Are you silly? How could we just end without a cause? At that stage, we will at least need to complete the paperwork for divorce! As long as we meet up, we will definitely not bear to part and will reconcile!”</p><p>Lou Cheng was instantly stunned and replied with a blushed face,</p><p>“Yeah, I had forgotten about this at that moment…”</p><p>We have collected our marriage certificate…</p><p>“Dumb!” Yan Zheke laughed while scolding. Typing quickly, she continued, “However, it’s a good thing that you have such experience. You got to conclude what you felt seriously and write a reflection, marking out clearly things and attitudes to be avoided!”</p><p>“Yeah! [Nodding Head Violently expression]” replied Lou Cheng.</p><p>“You got to really write out a conclusion and send it to me. I will supervise you based on the terms! [Run Fingers Through Hair expression]” replied Yan Zheke.</p><p>Yeah, I will also revisit this “conclusion”, remind myself at all times what to avoid and not to forget what I felt initially…</p><p>…</p><p>Due to the uproar of critiques and the pressure from the Chinese Embassy, the organising committee gave an unusual notice ten minutes before the finals and made the explanation:</p><p>“Miluo’s referee, Wu Cheng, had old injuries with him. Due to the effects of the explosion caused by Lou Cheng and the blow from the wind of the punch, he threw up blood. There was no cheating involved.”</p><p>Wu Cheng who was sitting in the resting room heard the explanation from the broadcast. He suddenly clenched his right fist and crushed a metal ball.</p><p>He would rather the organizing committee penalise him for accepting briberies than accepting such an explanation.</p><p>As a senior expert, he was injured by the wind of the punch. How was he going to command respect in the future?</p><p>What was the wind of the punch? That’s the wind brought by the punch!</p><p>If I could be injured by this, how am I supposed to raise my head in front of others in the future!</p><p>Accepting bribes would at most be a problem with his character. However an explanation like this concerns his reputation!</p><p>…</p><p>“Haha, the wind of the punch!”</p><p>In the live thread and various other forums, they were all laughing at this explanation.</p><p>They were really shameless.</p><p>“Oh my Lou Cheng, injuring an inhuman with the Wind of his punch, killing Dan Stage with just a gaze!” Someone was promoting his poem online.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
