BANG!</p><p>In the pool of blood that surrounded Peng Leyun, there were four teeth. The teeth rolled over and over.</p><p>Looking at the scene before him, Lou Cheng felt as if he was watching the end of a film in slow motion, frame by frame, like a dream.</p><p>He’d finally defeated the Big Devil! Though Peng Leyun had been injured before this round, he was still the Big Devil…</p><p>Recalling all he had done in the match, Lou Cheng found that every second had been filled with danger. Frankly speaking, he would have lost the game if Lin Que hadn’t injured Peng Leyun beforehand.</p><p>It was the first time that Peng Leyun had fallen due to lack of stamina since he’d begun fighting in the arena!</p><p>In the past three to four years, he had lost several times in combat battles. But each time he had been able to maintain his public image. He had never been in such a wretched state!</p><p>Lou Cheng exhaled to refresh his body. He knew he was lucky to have pulled himself through the fierce battle. The fact that he had finally defeated the invincible Big Devil was so exciting that he couldn’t calm himself down.</p><p>Though Peng Leyun had been injured in the first round and some might thus look down on Lou Cheng, the fact that the Big Devil had already begun morphing actually added to the difficulty of the second round. It made Lou Cheng feel at ease and justified. Not to mention, he had actually gotten the honor on behalf of all his teammates at the cost of Lin Que’s injury!</p><p>Lou Cheng was so excited that he wanted to shout with joy, but he finally got himself under control and mixed all his excitement into his momentum. He turned his gaze to the freckled man, Fang Zhirong, who sat in one of the seats of the Shanbei University Martial Arts Club.</p><p>Fang Zhirong felt as if two suns were shining straight into his eyes to force them closed. At the same time, a dreamy whistle began echoing in his ears as if there was going to be a blizzard.</p><p>Fang Zhirong’s trembling body reminded him of the fact that Lou Cheng’s momentum had reached its peak after the competition with Peng Leyun!</p><p>If Lou Cheng had run out of stamina or been badly injured, Fang Zhirong wouldn’t have been so nervous. Lou Cheng wouldn’t have defeated Peng Leyun without the help of momentum. The second round had come to its end before Lou Cheng reached his limit. With his inhuman stamina, it was possible for Lou Cheng to win another round. His momentum was of great importance under such circumstances.</p><p>Taking a deep breath to calm himself, Fang Zhirong stood up and walked towards the arena without looking at the others.</p><p>…</p><p>“This is the first time I’ve seen Peng Leyun in such poor condition.” Liu Chang sighed in the broadcasting room.</p><p>“Yeah, it was a really fierce battle,” Chen Sansheng replied. He was writing something on a piece of paper. “I never expected an injured Peng Leyun to be so hard to deal with. And I never knew Lou Cheng could persist so long. Lou Cheng’s good timing and indomitable will are really admirable. Of course, Lou Cheng’s martial arts base is still shallow compared with the experienced Peng Leyun. Well, what I mean is not Lou Cheng’s Kung Fu, but his application and his fighting style in an actual combat. All in all, Lou Cheng is still too young.”</p><p>“Yes, or he wouldn’t have suffered so much.” Liu Chang nodded with a smile. “But Lou Cheng really is a talented warrior, and he’s good at fighting. And his performance in the arena always brings us a surprise. I’m sure he will soon be ready for another competition with a warrior at the top level below the Inhuman stage.”</p><p>Chen Sansheng nodded. “Peng Leyun’s failure was perfectly logical and reasonable. The combination of Lin Que’s courage and Lou Cheng’s strength and invincibility have created miracles.”</p><p>Though he was a little incoherent with excitement, he managed to make himself understood.</p><p>“Okay, Peng Leyun was helped out from the arena. Sansheng, how serious do you think his injury is? Could you please predict Lou Cheng’s competition with Fang Zhirong?” Liu Chang asked.</p><p>Chen Sansheng thought for a while and then answered,</p><p>“Peng Leyun was hit by three Internal Explosions and dozens of Tremor Punches, and he was also suffering from an internal injury. If he hadn’t begun morphing and thus enhancing his physical condition, he would have been badly injured and would have to stay in bed for at least several months. But his morphing enabled him to persist until Lou Cheng made the third Internal Explosion. This extended the fight longer than we expected and actually worsened Peng Leyun’s injury. On the other hand, Peng Leyun’s enhanced physical condition helped considerably. In conclusion, it might take him one to two months to recover.</p><p>“Though the battle cost Lou Cheng a considerable amount of energy, his inhuman stamina is different from ours and thus I can’t make a normal deduction. In my opinion, Lou Cheng should still have enough stamina to fight against a normal Seventh-Pin warrior. But have you realized that Lou Cheng’s right arm is injured? His last attack worsened the injury, so he won’t be able to use his right arm in the third round.”</p><p>Liu Chang nodded. “Yes, Peng Leyun also noticed it, but there was not enough time for him to take advantage of it. Lou Cheng was actually fighting with one arm.”</p><p>“So there is a good opportunity for Fang Zhirong in the third round as long as he takes advantage of it. There might be a sixty percent chance he will win.” Chen Sansheng added, “If Lou Cheng struggles to defeat Fang Zhirong, Songcheng will be the champion. Xu Wannian is much weaker than Lou Cheng and will soon lose the fourth round as long as Lou Cheng is still able to move.”</p><p>“Are you sure? Even though Xu Wangnian can’t use his Corvine Mouth supernatural ability, he is still a Professional-Ninth-Pin fighter.” Liu Chang doubted Chen Sansheng’s comment.</p><p>Chen Sansheng smiled. “It depends on how powerful his opponent is. For example, Lou Cheng could make him suffer substantially with an Army’ Formula, for Xu Wangnian is unable to resist it. The fact is that Lou Cheng is a fighter of a higher level than Xu Wangnian. He has various fighting styles, enough to suppress Xu Wannian’s movements. Unless Lou Cheng’s right arm is injured badly again, and he is unable to make a gesture, he will… No. Even if Lou Cheng loses his right arm, his momentum fueled with the victory of defeating the Big Devil is enough to frighten Xu Wangnian to death.”</p><p>“According to your analysis, Xu Wangnian is one unlucky guy. But now that Lou Cheng has reached his limit, will his supernatural ability to rebound against Xu Wangnian also be weakened?” Liu Chang asked in confusion.</p><p>Since the supernatural ability always came from the variation of a warrior’s root pulp and cells, it was closely related to the warrior’s physical condition.</p><p>“Maybe… But will Xu Wannian dare to take the risk…” Chen Sansheng murmured and then straightened himself under the broadcasting director’s instruction. “Anyway, Lou Cheng is likely to win as long as he can pull himself through the third round and meet Xu Wangnian in the fourth round. The coming round will likely determine the champion.”</p><p>“The third round is about to start. Will Lou Cheng be able to get two straight wins with great momentum? Will Fang Zhirong take advantage of Lou Cheng’s injured arm and help Shanbei get its third championship? Let’s wait and see!”</p><p>…</p><p>“What a tough battle…” Wonton Seller appeared in Lou Cheng’s forum and sighed with emotion.</p><p>She was worried about Lou Cheng. Her heart was beating.</p><p>Unparalleled Dragon King replied jokingly, “That’s why Peng Leyun is called the Big Devil. There was a moment where I believed Lou Cheng would lose the game.”</p><p>“I have dropped my cup out of excitement,” Brahman cried. “Our idol has suffered a lot! I hope he will get the Feitian Cup soon!”</p><p>“Don’t be so excited. We are still unsure which team will be the champion. Lou Cheng can’t use his right arm in the next round and we don’t know whether he can defeat Fang Zherong,” Unparalleled Dragon King analyzed rationally. “God prefers tragedy. Is it more expressive to see an aspiring boy fight to his last minute and finally fail in regret?”</p><p>“I prefer to see your tragedy…” Eternal Nightfall Yan Xiaoling replied. She was nervous again and felt choked with sadness.</p><p>They had been fighting their way to this stage. No one wanted to fall down outside the door of victory!</p><p>The girls forgot to show their idol off on Weibo. Instead, they began praying for Lou Cheng in the forum. On the other side, Okamoto’s Fan and the other fans began covering the web page with posts of just two words:</p><p>“Winning streak!”</p><p>“Winning streak!”</p><p>“Winning streak!”</p><p>…</p><p>“Damn it, even the Big Devil was killed with your poison!”</p><p>A series of comments with the same contents appeared under He Xiaowei’s Weibo.</p><p>“Am I as powerful as they say?” He Xiaowei rubbed his beard and clicked onto the nickname-changing page. Thinking over and over again, he decided to ignore it and again posted on Weibo,</p><p>“I don’t believe that Lou Cheng will defeat Fang Zhirong with only one arm! Shanbei will end up winning the championship!”</p><p>The number of comments on his Weibo began to skyrocket.</p><p>“Well, it seems that you won’t give up until Shanbei is killed with your poison!”</p><p>“I admire you so much!”</p><p>“Be careful. Shanbei might hire someone to kill you after the match!”</p><p>“Is Shanbei really our rival…”</p><p>“How much did Lou Cheng pay you for your poison milk?”</p><p>An All-knowing Man in Ganghood also saw the Weibo post. It made him feel like he’d been hit with a stick. He wished he could be in charge of Weibo and kick Poisonous Milk out.</p><p>He’d felt his heart skip a beat when Peng Leyun lost the round. He was even about to fall down with Peng Leyun. Just as he was soothing himself with the comment “Lou Cheng has an injured arm, while Fang Zhirong is at his peak”, Poisonous Milk’s Weibo post suddenly appeared before his eyes, making him even more depressed.</p><p>He was encountering nothing but bad luck tonight!</p><p>…</p><p>In the seats of the Songcheng University Martial Arts Club, Yan Zheke clenched her teeth tightly when she saw Lou Cheng’s injured arm and slower movement.</p><p>Cheng still needed to join in the next round with his injured arm…</p><p>As thoughts flashed across her mind, she suddenly recalled the time when Lou Cheng had gotten injured before. Lou Cheng had once shown off to her how he could still eat with his left hand, but then screwed up his meal with a blank look. As a result, Yan Zheke had to feed him with flushing cheeks.</p><p>With the help of these sweet memories, Yan Zheke smiled unconsciously. She felt her tension and hesitation release slightly.</p><p>Despite the serious situation, she almost burst out laughing!</p><p>Adjusting her facial expression quickly, Ke brought her hands together at her heart to pray sincerely.</p><p>Lou Cheng was recalling the same thing.</p><p>In order to enjoy Ke’s tenderness like that, he must prevent himself from leaving the arena in regret!</p><p>He decided not to release the numbness with the help of Jindan. His remaining stamina was enough for him to make four or five explosions, and the Jindan would help him make three to four extra explosions. Fang Zhirong was unable to do this!</p><p>Now that he was likely to win the match, he should seize the opportunity tightly!</p><p>Lou Cheng stopped planning for the next round and turned his gaze to Fang Zhirong in front of him. He heard the audience cheering.</p><p>The referee raised his right hand.</p><p>The key round that would determine the competition’s result was going to start.</p><p>The referee waved his arm down.</p><p>“Start! ”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
