Aren’t you on holiday?” asked Wonton Seller out of surprise.</p><p>Lou Cheng put on a silly smile. “I’m quite busy with meeting my girlfriend’s parents.</p><p>“Ke will go abroad soon, so of course she’s my top priority.”</p><p>“Phew! Tiger, you are not even in your third year, are you? Meeting the parents-in-law so early? Are you becoming a father in university?” Her passion for gossip was ignited.</p><p>“You are thinking too much!” Lou Cheng took a sigh with his hands covering his face. “We are adults and our relationship is no longer a secret. Why not?”</p><p>“Ohh…” Wonton Seller sounded disappointed and changed to a serious tone. “Tiger, you are putting your lady ahead of all your friends! Ever since you got in a relationship, you’ve rarely come to the forum or chatted in the group…. Didn’t you say you joined the martial arts club? Did you quit? (Chuckle)”</p><p>“Not at all. I joined the club to pursue my girlfriend. How could I ever quit?” Lou Cheng sneered.</p><p>“Hmm… Your girlfriend sounds pretty awesome. Is she a master? Which amateur pin is she at?” asked Wonton Seller with a shocked expression.</p><p>Lou Cheng told the truth. “Professional Ninth Pin, but she hasn’t attended the ranking event.”</p><p>“Professional Ninth Pin…” Wonton Seller widened her eyes and poked fun at him, “Tiger, you are at a high risk of domestic violence. I feel sorry for you.”</p><p>…Lou Cheng laughed out loud and lifted his palms up. “Domestic violence is a sign of love. I’m not afraid.”</p><p>“Hmm… You are no longer the innocent, shy Tiger. Are you sure you can’t make it to the meeting?” Wonton Seller made another attempt to persuade him. “Don’t you want to see us? Aren’t you curious how we have grown in the past two years? Little Punch has got the Professional Ninth Pin certificate last year and is working hard to reach the Dan stage. Little Ring has become a successful businessman thanks to some financial support from his family. Little Ma, Little Dragon, and Little Pig Rider are all coming…”</p><p>After throwing a dozen names out, she revealed an important piece of news. “Don’t you want to watch the Dragon King fight on site? Little Pig Rider has got us tickets.”</p><p>Fan club managers were usually close to the particular club they supported and had a good chance of getting some guest tickets.</p><p>“You mean the match between Longhu and Shangqing on the 16th?” Lou Cheng’s heart was stirred.</p><p>This exciting match had been arranged on a weekday to make room for a title fight.</p><p>“That’s right! Interested? Wanna come?” asked Wonton Seller, jumping up and down in high spirits.</p><p>Lou Cheng thought about it and still felt awkward about the meeting. He firmly refused, “Never mind. I really don’t have time.”</p><p>“Fine, maybe next time.” Wonton Seller sighed, disappointed. “You and Little Brahma are so different. I can’t get you to come and I can’t stop her from coming anyhow. A 14-year-old girl in grade eight comes all the way to Huacheng to meet her online friends. How can we take responsibility?”</p><p>“I don’t think her parents will let her.” Lou Cheng knew Brahma’s temper. “Keep talking to her and ask her to wait until university.”</p><p>“Every day (Hilarious).” Wonton Seller added an emoji smiling with tears. “I’m on the edge of contacting her parents…”</p><p>Lou Cheng expressed his assent and changed the topic. “Little Wonton, what major will you take?”</p><p>She did pretty well in the college entrance exams.</p><p>“I don’t know… My English is good… I might pursue something related to this…” answered Wonton Seller, uncertain. She then waved goodbye at Lou Cheng. “I’m going to talk with them about our meeting. Please come next time!”</p><p>“Sure. Bye,” replied Lou Cheng, apathetic.</p><p>Yan Zheke finished washing and brushing and replied to his message. He shared it with his wife casually.</p><p>“Longhu versus Shangqing… The Dragon King versus the Martial Arts Lord…” Yan Zheke stroked her chin as her eyes rolled. “I really want to watch… We haven’t watched any professional matches on site together yet… Cheng, I invite you to a date! Let’s go and watch this match! No meeting internet pals in reality. We go on our own!</p><p>“I’ll have fun before I leave!”</p><p>“Sure!” answered Lou Cheng, very excited with a cheeky smile. “Honeymoon?”</p><p>“If you want.” Yan Zheke looked up into the sky with her hands on her waist. “I’ll work on the tickets and you take care of the itinerary.”</p><p>“Deal!” Lou Cheng quickly booked flight tickets and accommodation and browsed travel tips about Huacheng.</p><p><em>“Heheh! I’m going there anyway, but for a different purpose.”</em></p><p>Yan Zheke suddenly sent a crying emoji. “What shall I do? I’m so nervous about meeting your parents tomorrow!”</p><p>“Our parents,” Lou Cheng corrected her.</p><p>“Even more nervous now!” Yan Zheke had tears in her eyes.</p><p>“Hahah. What are you nervous about? Whatever they ask, you answer. If you can’t answer, you turn to me. If there’s nothing to talk about, I’ll give you a tour of my room to save you from any awkwardness.” Lou Cheng understood her feeling completely as he was once there.</p><p>“Should I help set up the table before lunch and clean up after?”</p><p>“No. It’s your first time over. You are our guest!”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>“Just make yourself at home. You do whatever you would do at home.”</p><p>The young couple chatted around this topic for a good while. In the end, Yan Zheke decided to follow Lou Cheng’s advice and just be herself.</p><p>…</p><p>The next morning, Lou Cheng got up for his morning exercises and then took a taxi to the Yan house after breakfast.</p><p>Yan Zheke walked out in a T-shirt, a blouse, a long skirt, and a pair of white shoes a few minutes later. Her hair was tied up into a half ball to show her elegance and sweetness.</p><p>In her hands was a perfect amount of bags.</p><p>“What are these?” asked Lou Cheng out of curiosity as he took over the bags with one hand and grabbed her hand with the other.</p><p>“Tea, health products, and fruits. My mom said girls must be restrained on the first visit, so we didn’t prepare much. I don’t know anything about it. I trust her.” Yan Zheke pursed her lips and made fun of herself. “Cheng, look at my face. This is a smile of giving up on myself…”</p><p>“Hahah… Don’t be dramatic. I’m here.” Lou Cheng tried to comfort her.</p><p>They took a taxi to Lou Cheng’s house, and the neighbors gazed at them as they walked in.</p><p>“They are coming!” Qi Fang, holding her phone, yelled towards the balcony on the fifth floor of building eight.</p><p>Lou Zhisheng, who had taken the day off, today walked back to the living room and coughed. “Just one cigarette.</p><p>“I didn’t watch them…”</p><p>Qi Fang threw him a glare and reprimanded, “Didn’t you say it was no big deal? Why did you smoke, then?”</p><p>Lou Zhisheng sighed with a smile. “I thought I would have four or even five more years to prepare for this… So fast…”</p><p>“Yeah, it’s like a dream. Feels like Cheng is suddenly ten years older,” said Qi Fang with a tinge of emotion. Her face suddenly turned. “Hurry! Sit down! They are coming up!”</p><p>The door opened in less than one minute and Lou Cheng walked in with Yan Zheke. He bent over to take out a newly purchased pair of slippers for her.</p><p>Qi Fang and Lou Zhisheng approached, and Yan Zheke greeted before Lou Cheng’s introduction,”Nice to meet you, Uncle and Aunt.”</p><p>“Nice to meet you.” Lou Zhisheng and Qi Fang looked at their future daughter-in-law, full of joy.</p><p>Lou Cheng handed over the bags. “Mom, Dad, it’s from Ke.”</p><p>“Ahh… You shouldn’t have.” Qi Fang accepted with a laugh and took a quick glance at the bag.</p><p>“Come and take a seat.” Lou Zhisheng pointed at the couch in the living room.</p><p>Yan Zheke nodded, a bit shy. Lou Cheng pulled her over and the four of them sat down together. Lou Zhisheng picked a topic casually. “Zheke, what’s your major?”</p><p>“Economy.” Yan Zheke gave a quick, direct answer.</p><p>Qi Fang smiled. “You two were in the same high school and now in the same university. This is destiny. Did you meet each other in the martial arts club?”</p><p>“I knew Lou Cheng by name in high school but didn’t really know him.” Yan Zheke glanced at Lou Cheng in secret.</p><p>“Hahah… Who could have guessed today?” Qi Fang found it very magical.</p><p>The conversation continued harmoniously. Lou Cheng kept the atmosphere relaxed and active and helped answer some questions, waiting for the topics to run out so he could take his wife to do something else.</p><p>Abruptly, there came a knock on the door.</p><p>“Who is it?” asked Lou Cheng as he turned and stepped over to open the door. It was his younger cousin, Ma Xi.</p><p>Ma Xi raised her brows and popped her head in. She smiled at Lou Zhisheng and Qi Fang. “Uncle, Aunt, my mom loved the chili sauce very much and sent me here to fetch some more.”</p><p>“Ahh… Why didn’t you call?” Qi Fang complained as she walked into the kitchen.</p><p>Ma Xi entered the flat and sneakily glanced at Yan Zheke before greeting her sweetly, “Hello, Sister-in-law!”</p><p>“Hello.” Yan Zheke flushed.</p><p>Lou Cheng hurried to introduce her. “This is my cousin, Ma Xi, my aunt’s daughter. More naughty than ever.”</p><p>“Who said that?” complained Ma Xi.</p><p>She soon left with a bottle of chili sauce. Then another knock came less than ten minutes later.</p><p>“Who is it?” Lou Cheng had no choice but to get up to open the door.</p><p>“Aunt!” As the door was pushed over, he saw Lou Yuanwei’s mother, Wang Lili, in disbelief.</p><p>Wang Lili raised the bottle in her hand. “Brother, Qi Fang, we got some wild meat a while ago, remember? Zhiqiang made this bone wine. I brought a bottle to you.”</p><p>“I was just talking about it.” Lou Cheng rose and smiled.</p><p>Wang Lili stepped in and looked at Yan Zheke up and down with a smile.</p><p>Yan Zheke quickly greeted, “Nice to meet you, Aunt!”</p><p>“Hello,” responded Wang Lili with her eyes narrowed.</p><p>Lou Cheng suddenly realized that they had come for his wife!</p><p>As soon as Wang Lili left, they resumed the conversation until Qi Fang got up to cook.</p><p>Another knock came.</p><p>Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke shared a look, annoyed and amused. They went to the door together to open it.</p><p>It was Lou Yuanwei.</p><p>He read unfriendliness on Lou Cheng’s face and put on a bitter smile. “I’m just passing by… My stomach hurts. May I use your bathroom?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
