Right after using the Wholeness Formula, he used Force Concentration, which condensed the churning in his blood, the tremor in his bones, the soreness in his muscles, and other negative effects in his lower abdomen. By doing so, he maximized the alleviation effects.</p><p>At the same time, he condensed and released his Dan Qi. Borrowing strength from it, he leapt backward, his body facing Zhi Hai. He swiftly retreated to the edge of the crater. The latent Emperor Yan Force in his body was ready to erupt at any time. This allowed him to veer without giving any indication of his intent, preventing his opponent from reading his movements.</p><p>When both of them had reset to a clean slate, Lou Cheng quickly calculated the distance between them. Realizing that he couldn’t stop Zhi Hai from using the Ba Syllable to evolve his Acala form into Vairocana form, he knew that attacking rashly would do him no good. Instead, he fought on the move, patiently chipping at Zhi Hai’s stamina.</p><p>The recovery effects from Wholeness Formula and Hum Syllable were both achieved by intensely shocking the body, meaning they merely appeared to be back to their peak form. In actuality, the rate of energy depletion was faster than usual.</p><p>When it came to physical and mental endurance, Lou Cheng might have outlasted even the Warrior Sage and Dragon King, much less Zhi Hai. He had, after all, been actively improving his stamina ever since learning martial arts and constantly refining his mind with the Nine Word Formula.</p><p>Seeing Lou Cheng leave the crater, Zhi Hai stopped his recovery state. He gave chase, as he had against Empress Luo, his monk robe fluttering as illusory lotuses bloomed beneath his feet. As he moved, the sound of rolling thunder hummed like Buddhist chants. Sometimes, it was unworldly and enlightening. Sometimes, it was a mighty, intimidating roar.</p><p>Great Cloud Thunder Roar! Great Wisdom Roar! Great Lion Roar!</p><p>Zhi Hai was already at the highest stage of his Lotus Seal movements—Eight Accompanying Roars!</p><p>However, the Unleaking Roar, Salvaging Roar, Lion Roar, Wisdom Roar, and Cloud Thunder Roar were drowned out by the first three.</p><p>Putting aside complex maneuvers, Zhi Hai’s movements were only weaker than Mighty Ones known for their agility in his league.</p><p>The deafening Buddhist Roars nearly made Lou Cheng lose his mind and slow down. Thankfully, he had already formed his Ice Heart, which allowed him to calmly examine the cracks forming on the pellucid lake.</p><p>His ears pointed forward and he used the Forwarding Formula to suppress the nervousness and lightheadedness.</p><p>Meanwhile, he loosened his control over his reserved Emperor Yan Force, allowing it to erupt by itself. With some guidance, it turned into a current, pushing his body to the left. Turning at his waist, he began zig-zagging.</p><p>Zhi Hai created a lotus with every step, accompanied by the eight roars as he tailed after Lou Cheng, determined to prevent him from getting away.</p><p>It’s better for me if this goes on. What is Zhi Hai thinking? thought Lou Cheng, puzzled. However, moving at that kind of speed, he couldn’t distract himself with such thoughts. Plus, he had yet to sense danger.</p><p>That would halt any plans of his to come close and attack, making it hard to fight while on the move.</p><p>Bang, bang, bang! Boom, boom, boom! Thunder Roars, Buddhist Roars, and Lion Roars echoed in the bluestone square, nearly forming their own clouds. Lou Cheng and Zhi Hai, one on the pursuit and one being pursued, maneuvered and zig-zagged at high speed. It was a tutorial on movement for the martial artists watching.</p><p>Given the fixed size of the arena, Lou Cheng couldn’t completely lose his pursuer. A few times, he had to slip past his opponent to veer and the side to avoid leaving the range of the arena, which would be the equivalent of him forfeiting. Of course, he only carried out movements he had predetermined to be on the safe side.</p><p>Just as he was about to do this again, he heard a solemn utterance.</p><p>“Ba!”</p><p>Ba Syllable? Is he out of his mind? Lou Cheng was startled. He knew that Zhi Hai’s power level would temporarily be close to the Forbidden Territory once he used the Ba Syllable.</p><p>Once he got close to the Forbidden Territory, Acala Fortification would be equivalent to Vairocana Flesh!</p><p>But I’m out of his reach at the moment. No matter how strong Vairocana Flesh is, it’s useless if he can’t hit me!</p><p>Isn’t he afraid of me dragging out the match until the effects of Vairocana Flesh end?</p><p>Or does he think he’ll catch up to me with the enhanced speed from Vairocana Flesh? If that’s the case, I can wear him out easily and finish him off with Tilting Northwestern Skies, Sinking Southeastern Earth when he is weakened and exhausted.</p><p>Thoughts flashing, Lou Cheng acted without a shred of hesitation. Visualizing the Attainment Formula, he was propelled by the faint blue flames as he fled far in an attempt to waste Zhi Hai’s Vairocana Flesh.</p><p>After using the the Ba Syllable, Zhi Hai’s breathing increased, his body glinting with a blue-black, almost colorless glow as though he was made of light.</p><p>He didn’t give chase when he saw Lou Cheng’s leaping silhouette. Instead, seizing the fleeting opportunity, with the aid of his Vairocana Flesh he used all six-syllables of the Sanskrit mantra.</p><p>“Weng Ma Ni Ba Mi Hum!”</p><p>The words didn’t come in order. They came all at once. In Lou Cheng’s ears, the rumbling Buddha hymn from every direction trembled the air, weaving into a single sound, a sound that spoke a thousand words.</p><p>“Weng Ma Ni Ba Mi Hum!”</p><p>The Sheli Buddha’s light from surrounding stupas turned viscous, like viscous syrup. Like a fly, Lou Cheng was caught in it, slowed down, and restricted.</p><p>An open flesh palm with clear prints and spread apart fingers, shining with infinite radiance, pressed down at him. Slow as it seemed, the surroundings was solidified.</p><p>To think that the Six-Syllable Sanskrit mantra would have that effect when used in conjunction with Sheli stupas… It’s not something you can tell from watching videos. Lou Cheng knew it was likely an illusion, so he quickly used Force Concentration, arranging the stars into the word Fighting.</p><p>There’s still time. He’s still a good distance away. Don’t get fooled what you see and respond rashly. Lou Cheng wasn’t using the complete Nine Words Formula, since that mainly empowered the mind, weakened the enemy, and shook off negative effects. It couldn’t replace burst attacks or be used as a response. If he used it, he would have to escape the binding with the Fighting Formula afterward. Then, he would have to worry about taking a direct hit from the Vairocana Palm, or perhaps try to avoid it. The amount of time he had wouldn’t allow him to do so.</p><p>Bang, bang, bang! Lou Cheng’s body expanded, bones cracking, muscles and fascia bulging hideously. He tore through the viscous, iridescent Buddha Light with his brute strength, causing a sound like air exploding.</p><p>When he had regained freedom, the Vairocana Palm was close. Quickling stabilizing his emotions, he used his danger premonition and judgment to prepare methodically.</p><p>After a short silence, his eyes turned deep, his arm raised, his right hand hollow and within it a vast starry sky.</p><p>Tilting Northwestern Skies, Sinking Southeastern Earth!</p><p>Silently, he flipped his palms and pushed diagonally at the falling Buddha’s Palm, where he sensed the most danger.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Like hardened glass, the iridescent holy soil was reduced to dust. Near it, the illusions were torn into rays of darkness. The Buddha Land was filled with swarming destructive intent that gave the tiny palm the power to resist the giant hand glistening with Buddha Light.</p><p>In the thunderous din, the Vairocana that filled the heavens and the earth crumbled, and Zhi Hai’s figure reappeared. Lou Cheng reeled backward, leaving deep imprints and spitting fresh blood with every step. His right arm trembled and his hand swayed. He nearly lost his balance. With his injuries, he was in awful shape.</p><p>With the remaining force, under the illumination of the remaining Sheli Buddha Light, Zhi Hai preserved his radiant Vairocana form. With lotus steps, he tensed his feet, knees, waist, and the joining muscles like Mahoraga. His palm went towards Lou Cheng, bursting with pure, endless light.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s first thought was to detonate his Emperor Yan Force and dodge. He was quick to quell the thought when he realized he didn’t have time. Sinking his waist, stabilizing his body, and concentrating his Qi and blood, he visualized the Fighting character once more.</p><p>Fighting Formula plus Force Concentration!</p><p>Bang! Hiis body expanded, muscles bulging like a blue-black dragon, and his fist blasted at Zhi Hai’s palms.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Light scattered, quickly dimming. Zhi Hai paused. Lou Cheng flew back. Heaven and earth seemed to freeze in that frame.</p><p>Just as Lou Cheng breathed in midair, relieving the negative effects, suppressing his wounds, and recovering his balance, Zhi Hai didn’t care about his decreased Qixi, His feet stepped on lotuses and he pretended to attack, compelling his opponent to burst his Dan qi and move away. Then, he pounced forward, closing the gap between them.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>His fist, with a pale golden glow, slammed at Lou Cheng’s skull.</p><p>Lou Cheng raised his right arm and barring the fist. Just as they made contact, his left fist shot out in an attempt to counterattack.</p><p>He went straight for Zhi Hai’s temples. He had to use this moment to force his opponent to a defensive position. However, Zhi Hai merely tilted his head a little to protect his vitals. His other fist that went at Lou Cheng’s abdomen didn’t pause at all.</p><p>At this moment, the Emperor Yan Force that had gathered at Lou Cheng’s wrist exploded internally, adjusting the trajectory of his palm. His fingers reached out, grabbing at his enemy’s eyes. He didn’t pay the slightest attention to the attack on his abdomen.</p><p>Zhi Hai, suddenly bulging his neck and stretching his spine, made his head grow a little taller. Lou Cheng’s fingers landed on the sockets below his eyes.</p><p>Ding! As though he had touched metal, Lou Cheng left merely a few drag marks. However, using the veer of his palm, he slanted his body slightly. His right leg went up and caught Zhi Hai in the elbow, causing his punch to go up and miss his abdomen.</p><p>Bam, bam, bam! Bang, bang, bang! Zhi Hai launched a flurry of powerful and manly attacks, deploying fist, palm, and feet to keep his opponent in place.</p><p>That was when Lou Cheng finally understood why he used the Ba Syllable, re-used Vairocana Flesh, and forced him to take fight head-on, without worrying about the cost.</p><p>If they got into an intense fist-fight when both of them were at a low HP level, Zhi Hai’s Acala Fortification—which was like a weakened version of Unbreakable—clearly had the advantage. He didn’t have to worry about his vitals, like Lou Cheng did.</p><p>As for Enemy Heart Freezing Move and All-Seeing God, he can deal with them with Thoughtsteal!</p><p>Lou Cheng had been dragged into the territory where his opponent was most experienced and comfortable.</p><p>He gradually fell into a passive, defensive position, making it hard to counterattack. Unwilling to be a sitting duck, Lou Cheng secretly channeled his Qi and blood to stimulate his body, using a simplified Fighting Formula.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>After blocking Zhi Hai’s punch, he suddenly exerted his strength. With a flip and fling, he tried to push his enemy away and escape.</p><p>That was when Zhi Hai’s fingers shot out, clamping onto Lou Cheng’s forearm, and then onto his hand, which elongated due to his body’s backward momentum. His joints and fascia cracked, producing a bone-chilling sound that sounded like dislocated bones.</p><p>He clamped down tightly, and, using that arm as a spring, pulled himself back. He raised his legs and did a one-two kick at his opponent’s abdomen.</p><p>With no time to dodge, Lou Cheng could only tighten his other hand into a fist and slam it down like a sledgehammer.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>He slanted his body as he hammered down. When his fist touched Zhi Hai’s right foot, his body was already facing Zhi Hai sideways. As a result, Zhi Hai’s follow-up left kick missed.</p><p>Lou Cheng didn’t even have a chance to breathe. Using his palm as support, Zhi Hai swung his waist forward, his bald head glowing an iridescent blue-black, and shot at Lou Cheng’s face like a cannonball.</p><p>Acala’s Metal Head Kung fu!</p><p>It was like hitting an egg with a rock.</p><p>Pupils shrinking, Lou Cheng drew a sharp breath and shrunk his body to use Force Concentration and avoid the headbutt. It was his only way out.</p><p>Bam! Zhi Hai’s forehead crashed through the air. His other hand had gone out silently and stopped at the side of Lou Cheng’s head.</p><p>In this round of attack, he first used his right fist, then his legs, his head, and lastly his left hand. After using nearly all of his body parts, he finally succeeded.</p><p>Lou Cheng had a burst of Dan Qi, but it couldn’t bulge his head to resist the palm strike. He could only stand up.</p><p>In the distance, the referee raised his right hand.</p><p>“Round Three, Super-Class Zhi Hai wins!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
