It sounded like a plane flying at hypersonic speed at low altitude.</p><p>They clashed like ancient giants. One of them had lightning-shaped tattoos protruding from his skin and purple lightning surrounding him, while the other had exaggerated, explosive muscles.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>A loud explosion sounded and Lou Cheng took two steps back. Thin, scattered electric arcs jumped onto his right fist and quickly spread throughout his body as he went numb and his hair stood on end. Qian Donglou also took steps back, his arm clearly shaking after absorbing the shockwaves from the horrifying strength.</p><p>The numbness quickly intensified and Lou Cheng retracted his breathing and blood flow to execute a Force Concentration to relieve the negative effects. With this, he also managed to stabilize his body.</p><p>However, his body was then pulled by an invisible force as he staggered forward uncontrollably. His Force Concentration was shattered just as it just took shape, causing his numbness to linger.</p><p>There seemed to be a mysterious rope tied to between him and Warrior Sage. Whenever the distance between them became too far, it tightened and pulled them back closer.</p><p>Under such a force, Qian Donglou leaned forward and crashed. He lowered his shoulders and seemed capable of moving a mountain.</p><p>Bam! Lou Cheng punched out his left fist with incomplete Dan Force explosion and collided directly with his opponent’s shoulders. He twisted his waist according to the momentum and took steps back to disperse the force accordingly.</p><p>This time, he didn’t execute Force Concentration in a hurry, but instead formed a layer of crystal clear ice over the surface of his body to isolate the electrons sticking to him, which instantly severed the invisible pulling force.</p><p>After the Ice Wall was formed, Lou Cheng’s eyes contracted. Qian Donglou had surprisingly lowered his stance and didn’t give chase or pull on the rope.</p><p>He lifted both of his arms and closed them together rapidly, giving others the feeling that this was easy work for him.</p><p>This is bad! Lou Cheng didn’t have time to do anything else and could only contract his spine using basic movements to jump suddenly to the side.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>A thunderous roar erupted that shook Lou Cheng’s heart. It shattered his peaceful Ice Heart and stunned him. He could only maintain his movements out of instinct.</p><p>Luckily, he had Enemy Heart Freezing Move to take the brunt of the attack and wasn’t completely stunned. He visualized the Forwarding Formula to suppress the remaining waves.</p><p>Bzz! Qian Donglou opened up his palms and formed a thin purple lightning blade that vibrated like cicada wings.</p><p>It slashed towards Lou Cheng, completely ignoring the distance between him and Qian Donglou.</p><p>The eighth move of the Thunder Sect, Thunder from a Clear Sky, Cloudless Thunder Blade!</p><p>Bzzt! Though Lou Cheng dodged, he wasn’t able to completely avoid it. The layer of ice around his right ribs shattered to reveal a charcoal black wound. The purple electric arc and a strong sensation of numbness delved into the wound.</p><p>If he hadn’t formed the Ice Wall in advance, he would have been completely paralyzed and fallen to the ground. His wound would have been so deep that one could have seen his organs.</p><p>Even so, half of his body had gone numb, and he staggered as he landed.</p><p>Qian Donglou stretched his body. Tumultuous clouds formed in the sky, electric snakes jumping within them.</p><p>Bolts of white light cut through the sky and outlined his mighty figure. It was as though he was the Thunder God, executing punishments on behalf of the gods. Standing there, it felt like he was the judge of everything.</p><p>Zzz zzz zzz! Countless electric sparks gathered in his palm and turned into an execution spear.</p><p>Pa! Looking down from above, Qian Donglou swung his fist as though to punish every living thing below and threw out the lightning spear. His undefiable aura weighed on Lou Cheng’s heart as though it was real, making his heart pump frantically with fear, terror, and desolation.</p><p>This move was similar to God-Slaying Saber’s Eternal Silence and was similar to those at the Forbidden Region. It was a perfect combination of punches and kicks, and could attack one’s body and mind at the same time.</p><p>This was the second move of the Thunder Sect, Alternative Heaven’s Punishment and it was done in the most brilliant display. This was because the one using it was the Warrior Sage, Qian Donglou.</p><p>Lou Cheng, who had just managed to stabilize his body, felt negative emotions well up rapidly and a strong sense of danger creep in.</p><p>However, he wasn’t able to identify the strongest point of Qian Donglou’s attacks with his intuition for danger, as there were several spots.</p><p>His intuition, which he relied on to avoid multiple dangerous attacks, was disrupted. Although it didn’t disappear or block off, it wasn’t accurate.</p><p>This was a mind trick of Warrior Sage.</p><p>With a change in thought, Lou Cheng didn’t execute a Force Concentration or the complete Nine Words Formula to break away from the other party’s mental suppression. Instead, he let his emotions that had hidden power within them erupt from deep in his heart.</p><p>He was familiar with such perilous situations, and doing this always filled him with indignation of not wanting to go down or be separated from his parents and Yan Zheke.</p><p>This was a strong desire to continue living.</p><p>Leveraging this belief and desire, Lou Cheng seemed to have returned to the state he was in when facing off against the ninth-pin from the Dark Sect and Ge Hui. His body became clear internally and externally. His power, Ice Spirit Force, Fire Force, mental strength, and intuition integrated into one and erupted out.</p><p>Shaking his arm, he punched out his fist. With his intuition for danger as the steering wheel and his desire of live as motivation, he struck directly against the long spear that was equivalent to Heaven’s Punishment.</p><p>His fist was shaking slightly, as it seemed to possess intelligence that enabled it to move through the forest of electric sparks, making it hard to tell if it was real or an illusion. It was just like playing the game Thunder Fighter.</p><p>Cosmic Universe Style, self-created unique skill, Live!</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Darkness faded, electric sparks dissipated, and all the illusions shattered. Lou Cheng’s fist accurately landed on the right fist of Qian Donglou. Their muscles, tendons, and bones suffered different degrees of deformation, and the image exuded theirpower.</p><p>Bzz! The lightning spear shattered the lingering ice crystals and left Lou Cheng’s left arm completely numb. As for Qian Donglou, he was engulfed by Ice and Fire as the capillaries on his fist exploded and a layer of ice formed over it.</p><p>In a direct contest of strength, Lou Cheng was clearly a notch behind, even when his opponent was just at seventy percent of his peak condition.</p><p>Bam! Moving his legs, he raised a snowstorm while dodging to the side. Using his footwork and three directional changes, he finally opened up some distance and broke free from the perilous situation to use Force Concentration.</p><p>Releasing his Force, the numbness subsided and his left arm recovered.</p><p>He made use of the snowstorm to mask his tracks as he closed the distance between him and Qian Donglou.</p><p>Hypothetically speaking, it would be best to adopt a guerrilla tactic when fighting against Warrior Sage at seventy percent strength and with multiple injuries. This would exhaust him, avoid his edge, and attack his weaknesses. However, Lou Cheng believed that he would suffer a miserable defeat if he did that.</p><p>Disregarding Warrior Sage’s hypersonic speed and Rapid Thunder movement technique, allowing him do as he wished without disrupting his momentum would be extremely dangerous.</p><p>For an expert standing at the pinnacle of Physical Invulnerability, once he got going and had momentum, he would be able to destroy anything in his path. He might even be able to fight against an expert in the Forbidden Region.</p><p>Mental strength could temporarily triumph over the weakness of one’s body.</p><p>With exhaustion as his goal, Lou Cheng went directly against his opponent to disrupt his momentum and prevent him from doing as he wished.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Amidst the howling wind and heavy snow, Lou Cheng swung to the side of Qian Donglou and struck with his elbow.</p><p>Pa pa pa! Bam bam bam!</p><p>He threw punches and kicks like an invading wave of fire. Every strike was covered in faint purple high-temperature flames, forming a strange scene with his opponent’s silverish-white, blue, and purple lightning.</p><p>Sparks fluttered and electric arcs scampered away. Lou Cheng, having just executed nineteen moves, had his arms in front of his chest. Combining the strength of his entire body, he swung out his arm towards his opponent like a returning spear attack.</p><p>This time, his fist was no longer covered in Emperor Yan Force, because after the exhaustion of nineteen moves, the imbalance in his body had intensified. Ice Spirit Force had accumulated enough for Lou Cheng to do a big move using the ubiquity of his personal style that traditional martial arts couldn’t accomplish.</p><p>Lament of the Ice Queen!</p><p>The two of them were in a close combat exchange. Facing such a punch, it seemed that Qian Donglou couldn’t avoid and had to fight directly against it. It would a matter of whether the Ice Coffin would trap him or if his lightning could shatter the ice quickly enough.</p><p>He swung his left arm slowly and casually.</p><p>Zzz zzz zzz! Numerous electric snakes that had scampered to the surrounding area rapidly returned and merged into one.</p><p>Their nature changed as they formed a ping pong-sized ball of black lightning.</p><p>He can do that? Lou Cheng’s pupils contracted but it was too late to stop his momentum.</p><p>Surprisingly, Warrior Sage was able to use this method to execute the ninth move of the Thunder Sect, Yin-Yang Reversal, Darkness Devourer.</p><p>Compared to before, his level had increased once again…or at least, he hadn’t had a chance to use these skills in the previous few matches. After all, he was the only Physical Invulnerability expert capable of using his Cosmic Universe style.</p><p>Poof!</p><p>Lou Cheng’s fist was stopped by the black ball of lightning as the accumulated Lament of the Ice Queen seemed to sink into the depths of the ocean without even a ripple.</p><p>However, the black lightning ball didn’t explode but gradually turned dull until it disappeared, as though its activity was frozen.</p><p>In this clash, Lou Cheng’s body stiffened, and he felt like his mind was devoured by the space.</p><p>Suddenly, he saw Warrior Sage moving his hands back to close his palms once again.</p><p>Again! Lou Cheng didn’t give it any further thought. Igniting Fire Force from the bottom of his feet and spewing light blue flames, he flew out rapidly. Qian Donglou’s palms stopped in the air facing each other.</p><p>Between his palms, countless lightning bolts was created, destroyed, and re-created. The cycle continued, and a terrifying mental force locked down on Lou Cheng. He stopped his movements abruptly as he suddenly felt isolated in the surrounding space. It felt barren and quiet, with only destruction ahead and the thunderous cloud that would end everything.</p><p>Restriction Sect, Shangqing Chapter, Global Extinction!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
