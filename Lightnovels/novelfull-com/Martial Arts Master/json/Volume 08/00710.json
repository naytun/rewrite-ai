Ning Zitong stood at one side of the referee. She regarded the red-clad Holy Monk, Fayuan, with amusement and sentimentality as he slowly walked towards her.</p><p>A fight like this always took her back to the days when she just attained Physical Invulnerability. At that time, Fayuan wasn’t the abbot of Daxing Temple yet. Even so, he had been upholding his record for his “Silent Zen” in years. She, who was still young at heart back then, desperately tried to provoke him into talking. Right as she was about to succeed, the referee announced the start of the competition. She was bitter about it.</p><p>And thus, she tried again, and again, and again… Time flew by, and they had aged before they realized.</p><p>The youthful beauty in her primes was already a middle-aged lady, and fifties didn’t seem all that far away.</p><p>Perhaps, this “hobby” which she has persevered throughout these years was the only thing that could give her moments when she could feel like a young girl again, even though she never succeeded once.</p><p>I’m no longer saying these provoking words to agitate him… I’m saying them to cling on to the last of my youth… Ning Zitong sighed secretly. She saw the gaunt Fayuan stopping at his designated position thirty meters away.</p><p>At this distance, she wasn’t afraid of him reading her thoughts.</p><p>According to the results gathered from actual combat by other seniors and fighters, the effective range for his Thoughtsteal was no more than a ten-meter radius.</p><p>That was when the referee checked the time and raised his right hand.</p><p>“Talk-time begins!”</p><p>Ning Zitong smiled, as though she had been dying for this segment.</p><p>“It’s been a long while, Master Abbot,” she said eagerly.</p><p>Once she said that, the audience and netizens saw the irony in her words. Putting aside the last fight between Longhu Club and Daxing Temple or the recent title battle, it hasn’t even been two months since Ning Zitong last saw Fayuan during the top-tier professional tournament celebratory dinner.</p><p>Are you saying that on purpose to make the Holy Monk retort you?</p><p>Even we won’t fall for such a cheap trick!</p><p>Fayuan seemed a little numb with his head drooped low and a dull expression on his face. He nodded ever so slightly slightly.</p><p>Unperturbed, Ning Zitong went on.</p><p>“I have had a query for some time now, Master Abbot. I was hoping you could give me some guidance.”</p><p>“So, the thing is, if Buddhist disciples do the Silent Zen to reduce unwanted harm that could be done by words, then what should a holy monk practicing that do if he happened to know a secret that could save the lives of billions if told? Should he speak? Or should he remain silent?”</p><p>Of course, she was aware that many wise monks have pondered over such questions. A monk from either the Matayana branch or the Hinayana branch would have been able to come up with a reasonable answer. Therefore, there was no doubt that the wise abbot before her would have a good response to the question. However, such questions often spark controversies, not to mention they were being broadcasted right now. If Fayuan chose not to answer, it could potentially be detrimental to his and Daxing Temple’s reputation.</p><p>Even if a Buddhist practitioner answers in his place online, it would still stir up a shitstorm. Such is the specialty of an information society!</p><p>Unfazed, Fayuan maintained his posture like a lifeless tree.</p><p>That’s a High Monk who practices Silent Zen for you. What admirable patience, thought Ning Zitong.</p><p>Then, smiling, she said,</p><p>“It’s alright if you don’t answer me, Abbot. I know you are struggling inside.”</p><p>Despite the intentional taunts, Fayuan remained silent throughout. Even his breathing rhythm and gaze didn’t change in the slightest.</p><p>After making some more taunts, Ning Zitong stopped out of consideration of her image. She smiled sweetly.</p><p>“I heard that your Silent Zen should end when you master Thoughtsteal. If that’s the case, why are you still refusing to speak? Could it be that you are extending it because you made a blunder, or broke a rule, or accidentally uttered a word?”</p><p>Fayuan did not make the slightest movement to this malicious speculation. Nor was there any change in his emotions.</p><p>After shuffling through a few more methods, the unsuccessful Ning Zitong noticed that talk-time was ending. Reluctantly, she gave up on her attempts and began preparing for the fight.</p><p>That was when she saw Fayuan’s pupils move, like a creature that had just awoken from hibernation.</p><p>Hibernation…Hibernation…Don’t tell me he was sleeping just now? The ludicrous thought stunned her, making her feel amused and pissed at the same time.</p><p>The referee didn’t give her any time to think. Swinging down his raised right arm, he shouted,</p><p>“Begin!”</p><p>Fayuan’s withered, yellow skin began emitting golden light. He raised his right palm and pressed at the air before him.</p><p>Ning Zitong’s upper body remained still as she moved away with specter-like movement. At the back of where she initially stood, a deep and clear palm print formed on the vinyl tiles. There weren’t any cracks around it, as though the imprint had been made by sharp, metallic objects.</p><p>Vajra Realm, Vajra Seal, Almighty Push!</p><p>This technique incorporated various secret arts. Only a few people in this world could have done it as effortlessly as Fayuan.</p><p>Sidestepping, frigid gales began blowing around Ning Zitong. The wind, that had been stained black, grew blacker.</p><p>Whoosh! As she moved around Fayuan, she suddenly began spinning towards her opponent like a drill. She weaved many shadows into the wind before diving into it, which made it hard to spot her real body.</p><p>At the same time, droplets of rain began to form. The raindrops, falling and floating, all went towards Fayuan. The rain droplets had a black shade, but it was actually crimson</p><p>Dark Sect, Bloody Rainstorm!</p><p>The wind tears through the mind and body, while the rain was poisonous! Her movements were hidden by the illusory shadows that seemed real!</p><p>Unexpectedly, Ning Zitong went on the offense from the get-go, instead of fighting while being on the move!</p><p>This was how Phantom King should be!</p><p>It felt as if everything darkened around them. A shade of lapis lazuli flashed across Fayuan’s eyes. Suddenly, a ring of light appeared at the back of his head. A bright, clear light that illuminated the area!</p><p>The light seemed to contain the five Buddha statues that represented the five great wisdoms. Right as it appeared, all the “phantoms” vanished without a trace. The poisonous rain disintegrated, losing its original color.</p><p>Vajra Wing, Wisdom Seal! A combination of Prajna Bodhisattva Body and Thoughtsteal!</p><p>The drill that spun at a great speed showed itself right before hitting her opponent. Fayuan’s large golden palm landed a direct hit.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>The pale golden glow scattered as Ning Zitong flew back. Midair, she veered and zig-zagged like a real specter, avoiding Fayuan’s follow-up attack and putting some distance between them.</p><p>Lou Cheng was awestruck by her incredible movements. Even his Mesmerizing Steps and Wheels of Wind and Flames was nothing compared to her Evanescent Shadows. As for Yanzhao League’s Shunpo, it was too direct and predictable despite its speed.</p><p>Only a practitioner of the Wind Sect, which specializes in movements, can achieve something like this… Actually, Chihuahua might be able to do this someday, thought Lou Cheng.</p><p>With equal beauty, talent, and specialization in movements, it is no wonder that Chihuahua’s master had often been compared with Sister Ning!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
