Wisdom King, Zhi Hai will likely have improved even further. Priest and Chihuahua might not have made it to the level of winning titles yet, but will likely have entered the realm of the super-class. Along with my fast-rising cousin-in-law, there’s Clown, who is going hard for titles; Living Buddha, who possesses Generational Wisdom; Late Bloomer, Liang Yifan; Optimus Prime, Long Zhen; Heaven’s Equal Swordsman; and many others who are in their prime years. There will be intense competition. It can only get more exciting than things now.</p><p>Thinking about the future, Lou Cheng suddenly felt exhilarated.</p><p>As thoughts fluttered in his mind, he suddenly shook his head and sighed. He turned his head and looked beyond the balcony.</p><p>That future is amazing, but the present is also equally important. If I can’t grab at least a title from Dragon King or Warrior Sage before they step into the Forbidden Region, I’ll regret it.</p><p>This was the obsessiveness of a martial artist.</p><p>That means I have to make the best use of every opportunity at title competitions.</p><p>For example, the new Warrior Sage Battle that would take place in one month.</p><p>…</p><p>It was the next afternoon, and Lou Cheng had just completed his training in the garden of his master’s house and was returning to the living room.</p><p>As he stepped through the main door, he saw his master lying lazily on the sofa. In front of him were a wine carafe, a cup, peanuts, and other snacks.</p><p>This way of life is too decadent… Lou Cheng mumbled silently.</p><p>That’s true. My master isn’t like other ordinary old men who like to garden, play mahjong, fish, or do other hobbies like that. He also doesn’t have the desire to fight the Ice God Sect for control over the subsidiary companies, like Sect Master Martial Uncle. When he watches TV, he focuses on martial arts programs. All he does nowadays is drink alcohol and laze around, watch competitions, and visit the military base once a month or so to cooperate with experiments or bother his old friends.</p><p>It’s unhealthy, monotonous, and boring.</p><p>Yeah. I need to find a hobby for Master. Looking at him now, he probably wouldn’t even care if Senior Martial Sister and Senior Martial Sister-in-Law had a child. There’s another good example of this… Talker’s dad couldn’t keep himself busy because of his illness. After returning home to recuperate, he fell in love with video games. He only likes games relate to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and nothing else. Since Master loves to drink alcohol and isn’t lacking in money, he could surely go for a wine collection or a private tasting event… Lou Cheng slowed his steps as these thoughts flashed in his mind.</p><p>“Hey brat, what’s that expression for?” Geezer Shi was a top-tier Physical Invulnerability expert who could easily pick up on things. He turned his head abruptly and stared at his disciple.</p><p>Lou Cheng dry-coughed twice and said,</p><p>“I was wondering if Master gets bored staying at home all day drinking alcohol?”</p><p>Geezer Shi snorted and said with disdain,</p><p>“Isn’t living like this and enjoying wine comfortably the reason I worked so hard my entire life?”</p><p>Your level of thinking is advanced… Lou Cheng was speechless.</p><p>After having lunch, he got his head together, carried his luggage, and bade his goodbyes.</p><p>He had to get ready in both body and mind for the Warrior Sage Battle.</p><p>…</p><p>Shangqing Sect, Demonstration Hall.</p><p>Countless Inhuman-level experts were crowding around to watch the Physical Invulnerability experts demonstrate Thunder Sect’s unique techniques.</p><p>It was like their once-a-month welfare.</p><p>In the hall, shadows crossed and thunder roared. There was only one area that was peaceful and quiet.</p><p>Beside the main pillar was a deck chair. There, leaning on the deck chair, was an exquisite-looking man in white rope with hair tied up in a Taoist’s bun. He looked completely carefree. It was none other than Qian Donglou who held the title of Warrior Sage.</p><p>He had lost this title temporarily, but earned The King title. Alternative Heaven’s Punishment, The King of Thunder Sect!</p><p>At this moment, he squinted his eyes as the sunlight shone through the glass dome onto him. He looked as if he might fall asleep at any time and had no intention to join the demonstration.</p><p>The people in Shangqing Sect were already used to this behavior and pretended not to see.</p><p>Rumor had it that the reason why Warrior Sage, Qian Donglou didn’t get stuck when he was young was that he felt that once he made it to the Physical Invulnerability stage, he would no longer be rushed by his seniors and could finally slack as he wished.</p><p>This mentality had only changed after he met Dragon King, Chen Qitao, who had beaten him to the brink of defeat.</p><p>Unknowingly, time flew by quickly. Peng Leyun stopped his movements and took a short break.</p><p>“Not bad, you’re improving quickly.” Qian Donglou smiled brightly and said from a half-sitting, half-lying position.</p><p>Huff. “I’m still not at the level of a stable first-pin expert.” Silverish lightning flashed from time to time on the surface of Peng Leyun’s body and made a buzzing sound.</p><p>“That’s already pretty good.” Qian Donglou smiled lightly and said, “In maximum two years, minimum one year, I will likely make the breakthrough. At that time, Shangqing Sect’s reputation in the professional league circle will have to depend on you guys, and you’ll be the main pillar of the team.”</p><p>Talking about entering the Forbidden Region, he sounded definitive.</p><p>One year? In one year’s time, I should have reached the brink of a super-class. I could finally fight as Lou Cheng’s equal again… Peng Leyun sank deep into his thoughts but quickly recalled another matter,</p><p>I’ve been working on integrating modern physics to modify the unique techniques of Thunder Sect. However, the results are minimal so far…</p><p>I’ve clearly differentiated thunder and lightning. Lightning is a form of electromagnetic waves and displays one of the four fundamental forces. As for weak interaction force and electromagnetic magnetism, they’ve long been…</p><p>Hmm. This path of modification could likely take ten or twenty years, or even a lifetime of effort…</p><p>As he thought, he suddenly felt tingling followed by a numbing sensation. He was immediately awakened.</p><p>“You were daydreaming again.” Qian Donglou got up slowly and said in a definitive tone.</p><p>The surrounding electric sparks became lively as he moved. This was why Peng Leyun had been jolted awake.</p><p>“I was thinking about some things,” answered Peng Leyun honestly, but he noticed that Qian Donglou didn’t seem to believe him.</p><p>One who was always daydreaming didn’t need an excuse!</p><p>Peng Leyun didn’t intend to retort but posed a question instead,</p><p>‘Martial uncle, are you going to practice?”</p><p>Qian Donglou smiled faintly and said, “Yes, I have to be a little more serious.”</p><p>He wiggled his neck before explaining,</p><p>“I need to make the breakthrough before Chen Qitao. Hehe. I can’t let him exceed the number of titles won just because I make the breakthrough before him and will no longer be participating in competitions. I have to win more titles over the next year or so to open up a gap. After all, he’ll at least be a year and a half behind me.”</p><p>He’s really calculating. Especially when competing with the Dragon King. Peng Leyun kept his thoughts to himself about his Martial Uncle.</p><p>As of now, Qian Donglou was ranked first with twenty-three titles. Dragon King and Queen of Thought, Fei Dan both tied for second with twenty titles each. King of Swords, Wu Qiao had fallen to fourth place with nineteen.</p><p>However with the momentum of Chen Qitao, by this year or the next, he would exceed the number of titles held by Queen of Thought.</p><p>Peng Leyun looked around the hall. He saw Yunyan, Minghe, and other Physical Invulnerability experts demonstrating techniques. He took a deep breath and rejoined this rank.</p><p>I feel like I’m missing someone… Peng Leyun frowned slightly but soon forgot the matter.</p><p>…</p><p>Hexi City, Kong Tong Grand Hotel, 33rd floor.</p><p>Because it was still on school grounds, Ren Li was able to arrive a week early to take advantage of the increasingly lively atmosphere of the Warrior Sage Battle to hone her heart and make her preparations.</p><p>She returned from the Jiuwen Stadium and took a personal lift with her assistant to her room.</p><p>Walking down the hallway’s thick carpet, the assistant with a cute face couldn’t help but steal a glance at her martial aunt. It was a tradition of the Kongtong School to employ disciples who didn’t really have the skills to be personal assistants to Physical Invulnerability experts. They rotated once every two years. The goal was to let them witness up close how a Physical Invulnerability expert worked and receive the teachings of strong experts directly.</p><p>Huff. Martial Aunt already has the strength of a pseudo first-pin at such a young age. Her winning percentage against those at the same level is high and she succeeds in her challenges. When the assessment happens at the end of the year is over, she’ll probably obtain the first-pin certification. And to add, when sparring internally, she even defeats Grand Martial Uncle Qi and Martial Uncle Feng occasionally. It’s no wonder that she’s one of the Heavenly Sons of the Era and a future title expert… The young assistant was thinking about these when she heard abnormal beeping sounds.</p><p>She lifted her head and looked over to see Ren Li standing in front of a door swiping her room card again and again. The door didn’t open. Ren Li looked lost and bit her lip like someone suffering a grievance.</p><p>Seeing that her assistant was watching, Ren Li nodded her head and said,</p><p>“The room card is bad!”</p><p>The assistant was stunned for a moment but soon lifted her head again to take a look at the room number. After which, she covered half her face and said,</p><p>“Martial Aunt, this isn’t your room.”</p><p>One ends with an 8 while the other ends with a 0. How did you get that mixed up?</p><p>I was just distracted for a minute. How did this happen?</p><p>“So that’s why…” Ren Li understood immediately and said straightforwardly, “I was wondering! How could it not open the door?”</p><p>She turned and opened took some steps, but was stopped by her assistant, who silently pointed her to the other direction.</p><p>When things were corrected and her room was in sight, the assistant heaved a sigh of relief and said half-jokingly,</p><p>“Martial Aunt Ren, luckily, the door of that room was closed. If you had just gone in, what would have happened if there was an unreasonable, violent person in it?”</p><p>“Someone said that to me before.” Ren Li’s memory was triggered.</p><p>“How did you answer?” asked the young assistant curiously.</p><p>“I forget. If it happened again now and he dared to do anything,” Ren Li paused before answering calmly, “I would throw him out the window.”</p><p>Horrifying… The young assistant took the card from Ren Li and opened the door to the suite.</p><p>Once inside, she remembered Ren Li’s habit and switched on the TV to a specific channel.</p><p>It was broadcasting a program and the guest commentator was commenting passionately,</p><p>“The challenge right of this competition will be to see who can stop the Warrior Sage.”</p><p>“I have listed four candidates based on their performance over the past year. They are the super-class among the super-class.”</p><p>“They are Kirin, Dong Baxian; God-Slaying Saber, Lu Yongyuan; Wisdom King, Zhi Hai; and Sky-Shaking Roar, Lou Cheng, who also goes by the nickname King of Gods!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
