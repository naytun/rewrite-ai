She called out to him uneasily.</p><p>Lou Cheng recovered quickly. He put down his phone, squeezed out a smile, and said,</p><p>“You can just leave them here and take what you want to eat.”</p><p>Auman followed professional protocol and didn’t ask about what she shouldn’t. She smiled, nodded her head, and left.</p><p>Lou Cheng picked up a custard bun and bit into it. He had intended to scroll through the webpage with his free hand to see the comment section under the new headline, when he saw Empress Luo, Ning Zitong, wearing a white exercise uniform with a towel around her neck walk in energetically.</p><p>“Eating at this hour?” Ning Zitong smiled and greeted, her voice questioning if he was alright. She suddenly recalled, “Dragon King will only return next week for recovery practices. The second round of matches is still on us.”</p><p>Dragon King isn’t returning for some time? Lou Cheng unknowingly heaved a sigh of relief. He rubbed his vaguely painful mouth and said in a light-hearted manner,</p><p>“I’m okay, Sister Ning. No stress.”</p><p>“Really? We’re going to challenge Daxing Temple up North at Zhaofeng!” Ning Zitong returned the question with a giggle as she casually pulled a chair over.</p><p>Oh damn! I forgot that our next opponent was Daxing Temple. And it would be at their home ground! Lou Cheng was shocked for a few seconds before he said plainly,</p><p>“I’ve been looking forward to it for a long time.”</p><p>Daxing Temple was one of the few strong powers with the ability to fight for the title of World Number One. Although they were regarded as slightly inferior to the Longhu Club and the Shangqing Sect by outsiders, they couldn’t be underestimated. Fa Yuan Divine Monk was of the same generation as Lou Cheng’s master and would be fifty-seven years old this year. He practiced Silent Zen, had great mastery over Thoughtsteal, and had won two titles previously. Despite his old age, his foundation was solid. Wisdom King, Zhi Hai, was one of the most outstanding representatives of the newer generation of martial artists. He had obtained the titles Supreme Class and King before the age of twenty-eight, and was regarded as having the potential to be the name of his generation. Living Buddha, Shi Shan, was the holder of the Mystery of Reincarnations. With generations of practice, his mental strength was terrifying, and he was the most difficult first-pin expert who still hadn’t won a title.</p><p>This was a lineup with two super-classes and a first-pin. In the past, the team of Dragon King, Empress Luo, and Optimus Prime were still a notch above them. After Long Zhen left, no matter if it was Long Zhen or Lou Cheng who replaced Long Zhen, they would still be slightly behind. Though the two sides were on roughly the same level, with Dragon King recuperating from his injuries, coupled with the fact that Daxing Temple had the homeground advantage, a victory would be difficult.</p><p>“Your attitude is pretty positive.” Ning Zitong took the bowl of noodles from her assistant before laughing, “There, you can do as you like since it’s not our home ground. Just dismantle and destroy as you wish.”</p><p>When are you going to stop with this joke? Lou Cheng cursed silently. He purposely changed the topic and said, “Sister Ning, you’re only eating a small bowl of noodles?”</p><p>The serving of a normal bowl isn’t enough to fill the gaps between my teeth!</p><p>“There are more bowls coming.” Ning Zitong pointed to her assistant waiting at the storefront of the noodle house. She had already finished nearly the entire bowl of noodles without so much as a slurp.</p><p>“Why don’t you just put everything in one bowl? It would be so much easier to just use a big basin,” Lou Cheng replied casually.</p><p>Ning Zitong stared at him and said,</p><p>“The noodles aren’t nice if they’re in the soup for too long. And do you think I’m the kind of person to eat directly from a basin?”</p><p>So it’s about image! Image!</p><p>I’m the kind of person who eats from the basin… Lou Cheng had no words.</p><p>…</p><p>Zhaofeng City, Bodhi Mountain, Daxing Temple.</p><p>The monk in charge the monastery reception, Zhi Jing, stepped into the yard where the abbot lived and greeted Fa Yuan Divine Monk who was sitting on a round futon.</p><p>“Abbot, I have something to report.”</p><p>Fa Yuan was wearing a yellow monk’s robe with a red kasaya. He looked haggard, and the edge of his eyes, mouth, and nose drooped down. But still, there wasn’t a wrinkle on his face. His eyes were gentle and peaceful. One could easily see their own reflection in them.</p><p>As Zhi Jing finished, the abbot extended his hands towards the pile of papers, took one out, and placed it in front of his chest.</p><p>There were three words written in black ink with a large question mark.</p><p>“What’s the matter?”</p><p>Zhi Jing was long used to this form of questioning. After all, his abbot practiced Silent Zen, too. He thought about his words before continuing,</p><p>“Abbot, the reporters here today have insisted they interview you. They are from Inner Haizi.”</p><p>What’s wrong with these people. Don’t they know what Silent Zen is?</p><p>Fa Yuan didn’t react, as if he had known about it beforehand. With his compassionate eyes, he took a piece of white paper and scribbled several words on it,</p><p>“Let Shi Shan and Zhi Hai head over. I still have work to do.”</p><p>“Yes Abbot, I’ll look for Zhi Hai and Martial Junior Shi Shan right away.” Zhi Jing took a few glances before placing his hands together to bade goodbye.</p><p>A small curve appeared at the edge of Fa Yuan’s mouth. He drew a piece of paper from that stack with the words,</p><p>“I want supper, I want supper, I want supper.”</p><p>Zhi Jing stood there confused.</p><p>Fa Yuan frowned and seemed to understand. He quickly threw the paper away and took a new one.</p><p>“I have already asked Shi Shan to help me sort this out.”</p><p>Ah, the abbot wrote that in advance as a joke because he knows Martial Junior Shi Shan so well… Zhi Jing was struck with the sudden realization.</p><p>Fa Yuan nodded gently and took out another paper from the original stack,</p><p>“Great, great.”</p><p>The words on this paper were like scribblings of a kid. Clearly, it wasn’t the same handwriting as before.</p><p>“In that case, I shall take my leave first.” Zhi Jing controlled his desire to laugh.</p><p>Fa Yuan took the paper at the top with two majestic words written on it,</p><p>“Namo Amitabha.”</p><p>When Zhi Jing left the Zen room and closed the door, Fa Yuan immediately waved his robe and flipped the papers. The stack of papers fell to the ground and revealed their contents.</p><p>Sweeping his gaze over, he saw comical expressions and words made of symbols like “(???_??).” His mouth twitched several times and he almost blurted out laughter.</p><p>…</p><p>After exiting the Zen room, Zhi Jing glanced at the skies. He made his way to the kitchen quickly and indeed saw the fat, burly Living Buddha Shi Shan looking in, swallowing his saliva, just as Fa Yuan’s joke had implied. He seemed incapable of waiting any longer.</p><p>“Martial Junior Shi Shan, the abbot has instructions for you.” Zhi Jing said with a smile.</p><p>“What’s the matter?” said Shi Shan without turning back.</p><p>“He wants you to attend the interview. Can you help me inform Martial Junior Zhi Hai too?” Zhi Jing got straight to the point.</p><p>“I’m not free,” said Shi Shan as he waved his hand, all of his attention focused on the buns about to be cooked.</p><p>Zhi Jing kept his hands behind him and walked several steps around him. After which, he said,</p><p>“The reporter who came this time is a big-shot. We’ve prepared top-class snacks to welcome them.”</p><p>“Where is it?” Shi Shan turned around abruptly.</p><p>“Clear Heart Hall.” Zhi Jing held back his desire to laugh and asked, “They wanted to interview the abbot. Where are these people from? Don’t they know that our abbot practiced the Silent Zen? Martial Junior Shishan, why does master have to practice Silent Zen if he practiced Thoughtsteal? Haha, naturally you don’t count. You are my senior’s senior’s senior’s senior’s senior.”</p><p>Shi Shan’s plump face showed signs of emotion as he sighed,</p><p>“You lose something if you gain something. If you gain great mastery in Thoughtsteal, it is best if you practice Silent Zen, too.”</p><p>“Why?” Zhi Jing was truly curious.</p><p>Whether it was the abbot or Shi Shan, they had never used Thoughtsteal in front of the other sect members.</p><p>“You really want to know?” Shi Shan asked with a strange look on his face.</p><p>“Yes!” Zhi Jing nodded his head quickly.</p><p>Shi Shan lowered his voice and said,</p><p>“Obviously I’m interested in this? What is there to be afraid of? Why is this glutton trying to make it sound so mysterious?”</p><p>Zhi Jing’s expression changed as he hurriedly waved his hand to deny,</p><p>“That’s, that’s not what I’m thinking!”</p><p>The edge of Shi Shan’s mouth twitched a little before continuing,</p><p>“Amitabha. He really could, he really could hear the words in my heart… Oh my gosh. I have called him the glutton so many times in secret. And said that he looks like a Living Buddha!”</p><p>Zhi Jing’s jaw dropped. He wanted to say something but couldn’t in the end.</p><p>Shi Shan helped him out of goodwill,</p><p>“I’ll leave! I’ll leave by myself!”</p><p>Before he finished his sentence, Zhi Jing lifted his monk’s robe, covered his face, and left in a hurry.</p><p>“Look! At times like this, don’t you wish that I practiced the Silent Zen?” Looking at Zhi Jing leaving, Shi Shan shook his head and laughed. He wasn’t insulted or angry at all by how Zhi Jing saw him.</p><p>He swung his monk’s robe and headed to Bodhi Garden. When he opened the door, he saw Wisdom King, Zhi Hai standing between two Bodha trees.</p><p>This world-famous young man was wearing a white monk’s robe. He had a baby face and often wore a smile, giving off bright, amiable vibes to others.</p><p>At this moment, he was looking at the top of the Bodhi trees deep in thought. No one knew what he was thinking about.</p><p>Shi Shan didn’t attempt to listen to his thoughts. This wasn’t a personal discipline issue, as he was able to use and release it at any time, but he wasn’t engrossed in it. He just still wanted to see the other party’s soul and mind.</p><p>When he had first mastered Thoughtsteal, his lingering, teenager mischievousness had once made him listen to the thoughts of his martial senior Zhi Hai. He learnt that Zhi Hai was the type of person whose mind aligned with what he was doing. When he was practicing, he would think of practicing; when he was eating, he would think of eating. He had almost no distracting thoughts at all.</p><p>There were obviously times when he thought about many things, such as now. But because of his strong mind and spiritual cultivation, Shi Shan could only roughly make out the contents without the details.</p><p>Sensing the arrival of Shi Shan, Zhi Hai turned around. He revealed his usual bright smile and said,</p><p>“I suddenly detest my former self.”</p><p>“What do you detest?” Shi Shan cooperatively asked.</p><p>“I could see past money, sex, and other things, but still couldn’t look past fame. I’m ashamed.” Zhi Hai shook his head and laughed as though he was talking about someone else.</p><p>“Since you are already immersed in fame, why don’t you just enjoy the experience.” Shi Shan replied, hidden meaning in his words.</p><p>“Why?” Zhi Hai frowned slightly.</p><p>“See past, see past. If you don’t experience it, how can you see past it?” Shi Shan replied casually before changing the topic, “The abbot wants us to take an interview in Clear Heart Hall.”</p><p>Zhi Hai nodded his head and followed Shi Shan to the Clear Heart Hall.</p><p>When the interview ended, they headed to the Zen room of the Abbot to report.</p><p>“It will be better if you do the reporting,” Zhi Hai said to Shi Shan with a smile.</p><p>“Alright.” Shi Shan walked to the side of Fa Yuan Divine Monk and sat down casually on the futon.</p><p>The Zen room went silent. After staring at each other for a few minutes, Shi Shan cleaned the dust off his monk’s robe, stood up, and broke the silence as he said to Zhi Hai,</p><p>“I’m done with reporting.”</p><p>And I got a scolding…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
