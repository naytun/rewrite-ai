The snow blurred one’s vision, affected one’s hearing, and clouded one’s mind. Lou Cheng embodied the snow as he blended into the storm, making him difficult to see.</p><p>Just as everyone thought he was going to use this opportunity to adjust his conditions and recover from his injuries, the snowstorm suddenly split. Lou Cheng ejected light blue flames from his back as he dashed towards Optimus Prime, Long Zhen. He threw a punch in front of him like a knife that sliced through the air.</p><p>As he left afterimages, Lou Cheng regulated his breathing and blood flow. His body was stimulated with consecutive Attainment Formulas, which increased his speed substantially until he appeared right in front of Long Zhen.</p><p>There wasn’t anything special about his fist, but it became ignited with a layer of flames because of the high-speed friction against the air. The terrifying speed equalled strength and destruction.</p><p>The whole process was so quick that the commentators couldn’t even keep up. It felt like Lou Cheng was just replicating what he was dealt with and returning it back to Long Zhen.</p><p>You might be able to use Attainment Formula for a secondary acceleration, but so can I. And I can do it better than you and reach a quicker speed!</p><p>Seeing this, Long Zhen wasn’t surprised at all. On the contrary, his eyes seemed to say that he saw it as a joke.</p><p>Feeling the strong wind smashed into his face like a metal plate, seeing his opponent appear in front of him with a punch that crushed towards him at impossible speed, Long Zhen’s body shifted casually to the side to avoid. The moment was so perfect, it was as though he had practiced it over a thousand times.</p><p>I know that you’re well-versed in Nine Words Formula, so of course I prepared by keeping a secret Fire Force to change direction at critical moments.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Lou Cheng’s fist landed on the afterimage left by Long Zhen and caused a strong gust of wind by striking through the air currents.</p><p>Long Zhen hadn’t shifted far. Contracting his muscles and back, he turned around. He grabbed with his right and created several golden flames before combining them into one point.</p><p>Pa! Holding the small golden dot in his hand, he slashed towards his enemy.</p><p>As he missed, Lou Cheng used his momentum to step forward. He kept his left arm behind and swung upwards as he moved past Long Zhen and struck with his fist.</p><p>Bam! As the two of them collided, the gold dot collapsed and began to spread. Lou Cheng became shrouded in it like an ignited human torch.</p><p>The flames cruised over his clothes, then his hands and neck, then onto his face and over his mouth, eyelashes, and hair. Lou Cheng had no choice but to shut his eyes to prevent the fragile areas from being injured.</p><p>The first move of the Fire Sect, Prairie Burning Starry Flames!</p><p>However, the flames were tamed and didn’t harm Lou Cheng as they were quickly extinguished by the spreading crystals of white frost.</p><p>Connecting on his attack, Long Zhen didn’t let the opportunity slip. The muscles on his large body expanded as he released his Dan Qi throughout his body. Veins protruded like thick snakes as he smashed downwards from the higher ground where he stood.</p><p>He was born with unnatural strength.</p><p>Seeing this, Lou Cheng couldn’t help but feel suffocated by his pure, overbearing strength. Triggering his Fighting Formula, he quickly turned into a giant. Lou Cheng immediately raised his flame-covered arms and readied himself for the impact.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Faint purple and golden flames scattered all around. Lou Cheng barely withstood the attack but didn’t have to step back. However, Long Zhen didn’t end it there. Throwing both of his arms, he walloped fiercely in a rhythm. Each strike was full of power, as fluid as spreading flames.</p><p>This caused Lou Cheng to busy himself defending. He took steps back from time to time, but found it hard to shake Long Zhen. He was firmly locked down by his opponent, trapped in a close combat fight.</p><p>Bam bam bam! Amidst the sounds of the collision, Long Zhen gradually formed golden, scorching red, and multi-colored fireballs behind his back.</p><p>“We can use gaming terminology to describe this. When he has enough mana to gather all five flames, that’s when he should use his ultimate move.” Cai Zongming, who was in the broadcasting room, was dispirited but tried hard to liven up the atmosphere.</p><p>Lou Cheng, who was tightly locked down by Long Zhen, had the advantage of hindsight from previous moves. He knew that Long Zhen might not wait until all Five Flames were gathered before combining them. Once again, Lou Cheng adjusted his muscles, tendons, and organs down to their most minuscule parts.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>As their fists collided, Lou Cheng flew back, giving no resistance. His injuries had worsened once again.</p><p>In mid-air, he ignited the Fire Force within his body to make consecutive directional changes as he attempted to escape.</p><p>Seeing this, Long Zhen’s eyes seemed to mock Lou Cheng. He took a huge stride forward and executed Attainment Formula on the surface while hiding Fire Force in the dark. He wasn’t just faster than Lou Cheng, but was also capable of sharper turns, without giving any signs beforehand. Long Zhen had completely locked down on Lou Cheng and prevented the distance between them from getting too wide.</p><p>In this aspect, Emperor Yan wasn’t better than Fire Force.</p><p>When he finally caught him, that would be the moment to combine five flames into one and summon the Great Sun.</p><p>Lou Cheng lowered his center of gravity and stopped.</p><p>He seemed to have made his preparations while escaping, or perhaps he prepared this move in a hurry. Lou Cheng lifted his right arm and clenched it weakly. Star-studded darkness appeared within it.</p><p>Tilting Northwestern Skies, Sinking Southeastern Earth!</p><p>This killer move, derived from his understanding of the Restriction Sect Chapter, was just like Lu Yongyuan’s final strike, Eternal Silence. It mostly affected one’s senses. Long Zhen’s vision was instantly shrouded in darkness. All he could see was a fair, white palm striking towards him as space collapsed and everything was destroyed.</p><p>The Five Flames, which were maintained using one’s mental strength, were clearly shaking and on the verge of losing control.</p><p>Long Zhen had seen the Clear Jade Chapter too and formed his own understanding. However, he was in the middle of executing Nine Rotations of Five Flames and wasn’t willing to throw it aside while he adjusted. It seemed like all he could do was fire out the fireballs.</p><p>With his enemy’s mental disruption in place, there was a high chanc that the path might be erroneous and wouldn’t land on his enemy.</p><p>In the past, Long Zheng would have ignited the Five Flames while there was still some distance between them, which would allow him to block the enemy’s attack. That way, though he would suffer damages too, he would have the opportunity to consolidate himself again.</p><p>However, he now had a better option.</p><p>It was none other than the complete Nine Words Formula, which was capable of weakening his opponent, increasing his own physical strength, strengthening his mental strength, and breaking him free from restraints.</p><p>When the thought flashed in his mind, Long Zhen quickly traced the seals of the Nine Words Formula and combined them into one in his mind. His hands made the complicated seals as he prepared to shout the ancient words.</p><p>Once he saw Long Zhen started forming hand seals, Lou Cheng retracted his breathing and blood flow, stopped his technique, and allowed his mind and Force to gather in his lower abdomen.</p><p>Within the miniature universe, stars moved rapidly as they traced out ancient word after ancient word.</p><p>Confrontation! Army! Fighting! Swordsman! Wholeness! Formation! Dequeuing! Forwarding! Attainment!</p><p>They appeared together at once as though they had been hidden within the universe all along.</p><p>With the nine words in place, Lou Cheng erupted his Dan Qi and pushed both of his palms forward as he managed to release the complete Nine Words Formula before Long Zhen.</p><p>With a buzzing in his head, Long Zhen’s focus mysteriously dropped. The complicated word that he wanted to form collapsed instantly and caused serious energy backflow. He felt like his head was smashed violently by a rod and like he wanted to throw up blood.</p><p>Lou Cheng had waited and planned for this opportunity and couldn’t just let it slip. Taking a huge stride ahead, he triggered the Fighting Formula, and turned into a flame-covered giant with hidden Ice Spirit Force. Lifting his hammer-like fist, he smashed towards his opponent.</p><p>He had pretended to return what he was dealt to Long Zhen in order to let Long Zhen get the upper hand and let down his guard. This also allowed him to start forming the Five Flames.</p><p>His Tilting Northwestern Skies, Sinking Southeastern Earth wasn’t finished, and he had no time to complete it. He used pure mental simulation to force Long Zhen to use the complete Nine Words Formula. After which, using his advantage in the Nine Words Formula, he was able to execute it before Long Zhen could, disrupting his preparation. With this, not only was Long Zhen hit with the negative effects, he also suffered energy backflow.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Lou Cheng hammered down his fist covered in faint purple flames as he pulled along Long Zhen’s Five Flames, which was close to losing control after Long Zhen couldn’t maintain it with his mental strength.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Raging flames flooded both of their shadows. The ice crystals on Lou Cheng shattered and he suffered multiple wounds. However, he didn’t care about the damages from the explosion, because Long Zhen took more damage from the brunt of the attack.</p><p>Long Zhen was covered in wounds as his body swayed front to back. There was blood flowing from his the edge of his mouth, nose, and arms, which he used to block Lou Cheng’s attack. He was shaking incessantly.</p><p>Lou Cheng moved his left leg and pressed forward once again. Taking advantage of the time his opponent used to recover from the explosion, Lou Cheng adjusted his body and mind. After which, he lifted his right palm with his miniature universe in his palm and executed the real Tilting Northwestern Skies, Sinking Southeastern Earth.</p><p>Everything was instantly shrouded by darkness. Seeing that he couldn’t avoid, Long Zhen triggered Fighting Formula and turned into a giant that went beyond the limits of human. After which, he threw his fist upwards.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Amidst the horrifying commotion, turbulent air currents raged and blinded everyone’s vision. Long Zhen, who wasn’t in a good state, felt like his opponent’s punch was capable of completely crushing him. Feeling a heavy blow, his bones cracked and he was forcefully shortened by over a meter.</p><p>After the previous explosion, the area was filled with holes the sand was loose. Long Zhen had sunk in deeply and his body was half-covered in sand.</p><p>His breathing and blood flow raged as he spat out a red liquid that ignited on its own. He wanted to break free and escape, but suddenly felt powerless.</p><p>Pa! Lou Cheng turned around and threw a kick. He tensed his left leg and elegantly stopped beside Long Zhen’s temples.</p><p>The fight between the two of them hadn’t even lasted a minute.</p><p>The referee was silent for two seconds before raising his right hand and announcing,</p><p>“Lou Cheng wins!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
