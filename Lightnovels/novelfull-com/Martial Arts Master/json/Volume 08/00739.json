His still appeared middle-aged, with deep eye sockets, a straight nose, and a head of black hair streaked with silver. There was a brilliance of flames were hidden deep within his eyes. He seemed reserved and held back but made one feel flustered and terrified.</p><p>Thinking back to the first time he met this senior, Lou Cheng remembered being afraid, tense, and unable to see the depth of his strength. Now, Lou Cheng could vaguely determine the level this senior was at through their connection with the atmosphere.</p><p>He was a super-class expert with a strong mind who had integrated his mental state into his strength. However, it was clear that he was on the decline.</p><p>I could already see this senior as equal… Lou Cheng suddenly felt a little emotional.</p><p>On the long sofa beside of Divine Enchanter of Sin Flame was Queen of Thought, Fei Dan, who looked like she was in her thirties, and Empty Nest Greybeard, Wu Molian, who lazily smoked a cigar as he smiled at Lou Cheng. From time to time, they turned their attention to Geezer Shi as though they were comparing Lou Cheng to him.</p><p>Geezer Shi, who had a head of white hair but few wrinkles, turned around, frowned, and said with disdain,</p><p>“Why did you make a specific trip here? These geezers force me to hold a party every five to ten years. Based on our customs, it’s usually around the the ninth year. Tsk. Going by the lunar calender, it would have been 10 years.”</p><p>Make a specific trip here? From what you said… Master, you’re actually pretty happy about me being here, aren’t you? Lou Cheng laughed silently to himself before replying,</p><p>“As your disciple, how could I skip my master’s birthday?”</p><p>Was Master really trying to hint that he wants a large party when he turns seventy based on the lunar calendar years to show off to his friends?</p><p>Hmm. With his injuries under control, he hasn’t been coughing non-stop over small tasks and has regained the look of an expert in his prime. And how could he not want to show off after taking in such a good disciple like me?</p><p>If Geezer Shi knew what Lou Cheng was thinking, he would probably have tried to stomp this unworthy disciple to death. He waved his hand and snorted, “I know you well enough to know that you are only saying it nicely. In the last few years, you’ve only given me a call and come to visit once!”</p><p>Lou Cheng was dumbfounded for ten seconds before finally replying,</p><p>“It was you, Master, who said that I didn’t need to come…”</p><p>It’s only been three years since I celebrated Master’s birthday. The first year, I took the role of assistant coach and was involved in the Inter-University Martial Arts Nationals. The other year, I had just broken free from the sequelae of the Jindan and was recuperating in the mountains, unable to travel far. Plus, you also went to the resort in the Northern military base to recuperate…</p><p>I did not expect you to be such a petty old man…</p><p>“Did you think you didn’t have to come just because your master said you didn’t? That was a test of your sincerity. Brat, you should have remembered and who helped you in the past,” scolded Geezer Shi in a jokingly manner. After which, he pointed to the living room and said, “Find a place and take a seat.”</p><p>Lou Cheng paid his respects to each senior before finding a seat and assuming a posture that suggested he would only listen and not interrupt.</p><p>Wu Molian smoked a mouthfuk of cigar before giggling,</p><p>“Oh, Jianguo…”</p><p>“How many times have I told you to not call my name directly?” Geezer Shi interrupted and stared at him.</p><p>Wu Molian giggled and said as he wished,</p><p>“With what you said, I would have thought that you accepted an unworthy disciple. Why don’t we talk about it and transfer your unworthy disciple to me?” He sighed. “Speaking of which, you’ve been keeping a low profile as a master. How did you raise a Physical Invulnerability expert disciple so easily? Over the years, none of us have managed to raise a good successor.”</p><p>“Don’t drag me into it. My closed-door disciple has already reached the Physical Invulnerability stage,” Queen of Thought, Fei Dan interrupted.</p><p>She was referring to Crouching Tiger, Ann Chaoyang.</p><p>“How can a mischievous old man like you be compared to me when it comes to teaching disciples.” Geezer Shi got cocky. “Speaking of which, I was the one who gave guidance to Lin Que from Geezer Ji’s family when he was at the most crucial step of achieving Dan stage. In two short years, I’ve already helped two Physical Invulnerability experts lay their foundations. Hmph. It isn’t that I’m looking down on you all, but you are far from where I’m at.”</p><p>Lou Cheng almost burst into laughter as he listened from the side. Using his extreme self-control, he maintained a poker face and nodded his head in approval of his master from time to time.</p><p>Seeing this, Shi Yuejian gave Lou Cheng a silent thumbs-up before walking into the kitchen to prepare a sumptuous lunch.</p><p>“This type of matter…” Divine Enchanter of Sin Flame paused for a moment before continuing, “Depends on luck and not the person.”</p><p>Good talent isn’t common, but it can also easily be poached by others.</p><p>“What do you mean by that? Didn’t you accept a good disciple in the past too? But when you brought him to the war-torn zones he ended up cornered. When he got out, he was on the verge of death and has been stuck at the Inhuman stage since,” Geezer Shi retorted.</p><p>Divine Enchanter of Sin Flame replied angrily, “Wasn’t that because we were supposed to meet up with you! Do you know how many mistakes you made in the war-torn zones? Your enemies are everywhere!”</p><p>“I have to put in some impartial words here.” Wu Molian said with a giggly face,”Jianguo… Hmm… Geezer Shi did do a better job than you in the war-torn zones. Once, he fell into a trap and was surrounded by three Physical Invulnerability experts, led by the man known as Ares, and yet Geezer Shi still managed to get out. It was just that then he was bedridden for two months and needed others to help him pee and defecate.”</p><p>“If they didn’t team up, I would have thrashed every one of them!” Geezer Shi replied with disdain.</p><p>Following this topic, the old seniors, whose names once resounded loudly in the war-torn zones, began to reminiscence on their pasts. They boasted about who they finished off in the war-torn zones and that the twenty titles that Queen of Thought had won were largely because they didn’t participate in the professional leagues. However, their remarks were ruthlessly rejected when Fei Dan retorted calmly,</p><p>“Those that lost more than seven out of ten times against me should shut up.” Therefore, Shi Jianguo, Wu Molian and Divine Enchanter of Sin Flame quietened down.</p><p>“If you’re truly capable, let’s fight it out in a real battle. If I hadn’t suffered grave injuries…” After several tens of second, Geezer Shi mumbled to himself softly. After which, he quickly changed the topic to his experience in the war-torn zones.</p><p>He was at the same level as Queen of Thought when he was at his peak, and they were just half a step from reaching the Forbidden region. However, they weren’t able to make the breakthrough and could now only look back emotionally.</p><p>Lou Cheng sank deep in thought after hearing what they had said. However, he held back his urge to speak. When lunch was over and the seniors went to take a short break, he finally asked Shi Jianguo on the stairs,</p><p>“Master, who’s the Forbidden Stage expert that injured you?”</p><p>Geezer Shi looked at him and laughed,</p><p>“What? Are you thinking of taking revenge for me? Are you that confident you’ll reach the Forbidden Region?”</p><p>“At this stage, how can one not imagine aiming for that stage. However, your disciple is clear and knows it would be extremely difficult. It would probably take decades to achieve,” answered Lou Cheng honestly. “At that time, if I’m successful, I’d be able to fulfil my duties as your disciple and take revenge for you.”</p><p>“What revenge are you talking about?” Geezer Shi replied angrily. “Isn’t your master still capable of everyday activities? I’ll live another twenty to thirty years. If you are thinking of going against a Forbidden Region expert just for previous injuries, the people seeking revenge against your master could line up from here to the city. It’s not worth it, it’s just isn’t worth it.”</p><p>He coughed twice before continuing, “Unless your master dies prematurely because of the incident rather than pass away in peace, there’s no point in seeking revenge. You could also make things difficult for him or foil his plans for other forms of revenge.”</p><p>But he ended Master’s chance of making the breakthrough… Lou Cheng exclaimed silently. A question popped up in his mind. He thought about it seriously and couldn’t help but ask,</p><p>“How will I know if my master passed away naturally or passed away because of the previous incident?”</p><p>No one really knows how long they’ll live…</p><p>Hearing this question, Geezer Shi was stunned but soon scolded,</p><p>“Brat, you are really hoping for your master to die?”</p><p>Nothing good comes out of your mouth!</p><p>Um… Lou Cheng’s expression froze.</p><p>Geezer Shi snorted, put his hands behind his back, and walked up the stairs. Halfway up, he heaved a sigh and said,</p><p>“The truth is, when your master was severely injured, I had almost no hope of reaching the Deity Territory. I was already over fifty years old. If only, if only I was ten years younger…”</p><p>His tone was complicated and he didn’t stop. In the blink of an eye, he disappeared around the corner of the corridor.</p><p>Lou Cheng listened silently and felt a little disheartened.</p><p>He walked step by step to the second floor and happened to see Queen of Thought, Fei Dan walking over from the balcony at the end of the hallway.</p><p>“Your master was right. At our age, the hardest and most natural thing is to accept ageing. This has nothing to do with others.” She smiled and nodded her head as she spoke.</p><p>After which, she went past Lou Cheng towards the guest room. Along the way, she shook her head and sighed emotionally,</p><p>“To be born, to grow old, to get sick, and to die is truly bitter.”</p><p>“No one can escape age…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
