Apart from old friends like Queen of Thought and Divine Enchanter of Sin Flame, there were only his Senior Martial Brother Sect Master, his daughter, his shitty disciple, and the other Physical Invulnerability experts of the Ice God Sect.</p><p>Of course, Wuyue Club’s alliances—Hai Xi Sect, Hanchi Sect, and Dinghaizhu—had all sent worthy disciples to congratulate him, along with gifts like fine wine.</p><p>Lou Cheng listened quietly as his seniors bragged about their pasts. Suddenly, he felt something behind him. He turned and peered at the door.</p><p>Queen of Thought did the same, and Geezer Shi and the rest followed suit, puzzled.</p><p>It was dark and raining outside. The tree branches breathed spring.</p><p>“Hmm?” uttered Shi Jianguo curiously after a few seconds.</p><p>Shi Yuejian was confused at first, then stood as her eyes lit up. She walked briskly to the door and pulled it open.</p><p>In the scattered rain, a tall, mighty figure clad in navy blue slowly approached with two old jars in hand. Raindrops evaporated without a trace as they neared him. It was none other than Dragon King, Chen Qitao.</p><p>His appearance brought silence to the living and dining rooms. All eyes were on him as he advanced through the heavy rain, like a great sun rising in reverse.</p><p>Chen Qitao ambled into the mansion, not a drop of rain on him. He didn’t have to say anything, for his might and authority spoke for him. Shi Yuejian, who had let him in, forgot to say anything. In fact, it was the same for everyone.</p><p>He walked to the dining table and placed the two old jars before Geezer Shi. The cutlery moved by themselves to provide sufficient space.</p><p>“Ten thousand-year-old wine from the ancient chambers of the Yao state,” said Chen Qitao, patting the seal on one of the jars. An irresistible aroma wafted through the air.</p><p>Coming back to his senses, Geezer Shi laughed loudly.</p><p>“I recall that there are only five jars of that left. You took half of them away!”</p><p>“Brat, go get an extra chair!”</p><p>Lou Cheng only realized what was going on after hearing the order.</p><p>Dragon King was here to celebrate his master’s birthday!</p><p>No one had expected it. The ambience felt more like an enemy seeking vengeance and blood.</p><p>Without a doubt, Dragon King’s solemn, stern disposition also played a major part.</p><p>Most likely, Master had invited him casually without actually expecting him to show up.</p><p>As he thought about it, he and Shi Yuejian found a chair from the guest room and set it before his master.</p><p>Dragon King took the offer and sat down.</p><p>“Back then, back when I almost died in the war-torn zones, you never came to gift me any wine. What brought you here today?” said Shi Jianguo half-teasing and half-sentimentally.</p><p>“It wasn’t your birthday then,” answered Chen Qitao with an earnest poker face.</p><p>Everyone fell silent once again, unsure of what to say.</p><p>What a dry joke… Dragon King really lacks a sense of humor. What a party pooper. It was the first time Lou Cheng had seen Chen Qitao at such an occasion, and he couldn’t help but poke fun at him internally.</p><p>Geezer Shi laughed dryly, shaking his head.</p><p>“After all these years, you haven’t changed. Not in the least. Ah, I’ll leave it to you to beat my troublemaker of a disciple into shape.”</p><p>Master, he literally beats me… Lou Cheng’s body ached at the word.</p><p>Since he had lost to Dragon King in the Battle of Warrior Sage, Dragon King’s attitude hadn’t changed, just like the rumors predicted: that he would treat juniors like trainees, and only qualified contenders as foes. It could have been that he wasn’t yet worthy of being a threat.</p><p>The first time they fought in an official match, he hadn’t expected to lose so badly, despite his power being reduced to seventy percent from injuries. It was pretty much a one-sided match. That experience gave him some insight into how the Legendary Twins in their best forms earned their names.</p><p>Anyways, after the first couple beatings, they never stopped, and he had improved rapidly in the past year. During daily practice, though he was mostly on the losing side, he began to taste victory. However, terrifying counterattacks and merciless beatings followed every win. It hurt to even remember.</p><p>Without a doubtless, those beatings were the main reason behind his rapid improvement. In less than two years, he could proclaim himself as super-class without guilt.</p><p>“No problem,” said Dragon King. He didn’t give so much as half a look at Lou Cheng, but his expression softened, as though they were talking about a recreational activity.</p><p>Subconsciously, Lou Cheng rubbed the corner of his lips. The wound there had come and gone, just like how his teeth had fallen and grown. It seemed like a relapsing condition by now.</p><p>Since Dragon King had also once dominated the war-torn zones, he had a common background with Queen of Thought and the others, so the ambience of the party soon returned to normal.</p><p>Though he spoke less than he listened, when he did speak, everyone remained silent.</p><p>“If Ares could hear your verdict, his juniors would have a hard time holding his coffin shut…” Wu Molian shook his head profusely at Dragon King’s poisonous comments.</p><p>But he was the only one who had the right to say such things, for he was the one who slew Ares.</p><p>Recalling his own past, Geezer Shi was about to brag on his Physical Invulnerability kills when he saw Dragon King glance at the door.</p><p>Then, his shitty disciple stood up with a smile and opened the door.</p><p>“Better late than never.”</p><p>“Mhm,” said Lin Que, unperturbed by his words.</p><p>He was also carrying two jars of wine. He walked over to Geezer Shi, remained silent for a moment, then said,</p><p>“Coach Shi, my grandparents have sent me to bring you these twenty-year-old homemade brews. May your luck be as vast as the eastern oceans, and may your longevity be as great as the southern mountains.”</p><p>Lou Cheng smiled as he watched his cousin-in-law recite his greetings, waiting for him to stutter, pause, or get embarrassed. However, Lin Que was cool as a cucumber throughout his speech and didn’t yield any reactions.</p><p>How do you say such stale greetings so eloquently? Lou Cheng secretly nodded his head, silently muttering, “Boring, boring…”</p><p>…</p><p>A different mansion, near the Wuyue Club.</p><p>When the dull Huang Ke was done polishing his Ice Chi Spear, he retrieved a jade bottle from the wine cabinet and poured himself a cup of wine the color of a lake.</p><p>His disciple, Zhen Yu, who was endeavoring to make it to Physical Invulnerability, asked puzzled,</p><p>“Why the sudden urge to drink, Master?”</p><p>His master had always collected and admired wine, but seldom drank.</p><p>Another disciple glanced at the balcony and peered out. “Today is the 65th birthday of Senior Shi from the Ice God Sect. Does Master intend to send over a jar of wine?”</p><p>But what’s the logic behind drinking it before gifting it?</p><p>Huang Ke said nothing and ambled towards the balcony, wine glass in hand. He peered in the direction of Geezer Shi’s house, and after a while, said,</p><p>“No need. We aren’t close.”</p><p>His tone became a little dreamy.</p><p>“When I entered the sect, he was at the peak of his career. I have always treated him as a target to surpass in hopes of challenging him. A pity it never happened.”</p><p>“And now…” A rare smile appeared on his face. “We have all grown old.”</p><p>For Mighty Ones like them, beating an Inhuman was a walk in the park, even if you add thirty to their age. However, compared to the youth and young adults of the same league, they had to admit that age was catching up to them.</p><p>Spear King did not sigh, but raised his glass in the direction of the Shi household and downed it, toasting from afar.</p><p>…</p><p>When the birthday party ended, some took their leave while others continued reminiscing.</p><p>Worried that his cousin-in-law wouldn’t feel like he fit in, Lou Cheng dragged him to the quiet balcony. Smiling, he asked,</p><p>“Been through a lot in the war-torn zones?”</p><p>“Indeed,” said Lin Que tersely.</p><p>“Like what?” asked Lou Cheng, intrigued.</p><p>“Too many things.” Lin Que was being a party pooper as usual.</p><p>Lou Cheng felt the corner of his lips twitch. Then, smiling, he asked,</p><p>“So how did you make the great leap and attain Physical Invulnerability?”</p><p>“Just like that,” replied Lin Que calmly.</p><p>Can’t you hold proper conservation… Dipping his head, Lou Cheng sent a message to Ke Ke.</p><p>“Your brother is impossible to talk to!”</p><p>Lin Que watched as he tapped on the virtual keyboard. Slowly, he said,</p><p>“In the war-torn zones, actions speak louder than words.”</p><p>“True,” nodded Lou Cheng thoughtfully. “I’ll help out the people there the next time I go over for a mission.”</p><p>Though I probably wouldn’t be welcomed by the Physical Invulnerability experts there…</p><p>After a brief silence, he shifted the subject.</p><p>“Are you participating in the Battle of Warrior Sage next month?”</p><p>“Yes,” said Lin Que.</p><p>“Hm. Any goals in mind?” asked Lou Cheng casually.</p><p>Lifting his eyes, Lin Que stared at him with pitch-black eyes.</p><p>“Defeating you.”</p><p>My dear cousin-in-law, are you being serious or are you making a joke…? Lou Cheng was a little taken aback.</p><p>Lin Que turned and walked towards the guest room. As he was about to leave the balcony, he added,</p><p>“I’ll continue to work hard.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
