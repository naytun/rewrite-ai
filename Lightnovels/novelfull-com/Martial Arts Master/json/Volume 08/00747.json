The stagnant scene finally changed when Lou Cheng stood up, lifted his arms, and clasped a fist in his palm as a display of respect and said,</p><p>“Thank you for your guidance.”</p><p>It was a simple action, but it was enough to cause pain in his chest. With his senses back, he felt the relief and joy that comes after an intense match.</p><p>Excluding the time when they took turns fighting against him in the professional league, this was the first time he had won against the Warrior Sage in an individual fight, even if Warrior Sage was seventy percent cooked…no…at seventy percent of his peak!</p><p>Compared to the Supreme Class Battle that took place a year ago, although the other party’s condition was worse, Lou Cheng could clearly feel his improvement, which excited him.</p><p>Qian Donglou took a deep breath and his complexion started to improve. He waved his tattered white robe and took a deep look at Lou Cheng. After which, he shook his head and said emotionally,</p><p>“The way you charged through the explosion was just like Chen Qitao.”</p><p>After speaking, he turned around and walked slowly towards the exit.</p><p>Lou Cheng was a little stunned by what he heard and couldn’t help but curse silently,</p><p>People usually compare me to you… What do you mean I’m like the Dragon King?</p><p>Who do I resemble more?</p><p>Why do I feel like I’m a product of combining different characteristics of Dragon King and Warrior Sage?</p><p>Eh, that sounds weird…</p><p>The joy of winning against the top-ranked in the world made Lou Cheng feel relaxed, and all sorts of strange ideas surfaced in his mind.</p><p>The audience in the stadium finally reacted to the situation. They were full of surprise and awe as they cheered,</p><p>“Lou Cheng!”</p><p>Collecting his thoughts, Lou Cheng endured the pain as he waved back to show his appreciation.</p><p>…</p><p>Lou Cheng’s fan forum.</p><p>Nie Qiqi said,</p><p>“[shocked emoji] This makes no scientific sense… How did he just win?”</p><p>Unparalleled Dragon King answered comically, “Why shouldn’t he win? Lou Cheng is also a super-class, and the difference between him and Warrior Sage isn’t that great. In addition, Warrior Sage had a tough schedule and even took a ruthless blow from Lu Yongyuan. It was optimistic to say that he was only at seventy percent of his peak.”</p><p>“As for Lou Cheng, he only encountered two strong opponents. The injuries he sustained from his match with Living Buddha were mostly mental. Based on the available information about his recovery abilities, he should have recovered from it before this match. Therefore, only the match against the Long Dam that Guards the Sea should have exhausted him, and his injuries weren’t that serious. Lou Cheng was probably at eighty to ninety percent of his peak condition. Putting these factors together, winning against the Warrior Sage was difficult but not impossible.”</p><p>“What I meant was how did Lou Cheng just get into the rank of super-class? Isn’t it a little too soon? It felt like a dream. Peng Leyun and Ren Li just reached the level of first-pin.” Nie Qiqi expressed her shock incoherently.</p><p>A Plumber Eating Mushroom said, “Isn’t there an interview that reported Lou Cheng opened his own martial arts path to be a future grandmaster? He’s integrated other styles and created the Cosmic Universe style. When he made the great leap and become a Physical Invulnerability expert, his starting point was aready a little higher than Peng Leyun and Ren Li. Together with diligent training, no slacking off, and beatings from Dragon King, it’s perfectly normal that he should lead the pack!”</p><p>“Take a look at Wisdom King, who reached the ranks of super-class in a little over two years and got his first title in less than three. With so many conditions working in favor of Lou Cheng, one could say that this was unprecedented. It’s only natural for him to squeeze into the ranks of super-class faster than the Wisdom King by approximately half a year. And Lou Cheng’s improvisation abilities were already widely complimented as being super-class level!” Invincible Punch explained.</p><p>Eternal Nightfall, Yan Xiaoling, said,</p><p>[clenched fist emoji] What’s the point of talking so much? I’m too lazy to look at your analysis. The results are that Senior won. He won! Hahahaha. He won against the Warrior Sage in a title match!”</p><p>“Yeah yeah. Little Nightfall puts it well. We could say that he is the leader of the four Heavenly Sons of the Era now! [nodding emoji]” replied Brahman.</p><p>“Don’t get excited so quickly. Let’s wait till Lou Cheng gets a title next year before we have this discussion. Otherwise, he still isn’t as good as Wisdom King. Earn some karma points! [dancing emoji]” said Wonton Seller.</p><p>“Yeah, he hasn’t even gotten the challenge right. From what I saw, Lou Cheng’s injuries look pretty serious. He has to get past Dong Baxian next,” Unparalleled Dragon King said optimistically.</p><p>…</p><p>In the TV studio broadcasting room, guest commentator, He Xiaowei laughed and said,</p><p>“Like I said! Lou Cheng will definitely be one of the leading figures after the era of the Legendary Twins. He’ll definitely be the brightest, or at least among the top three!”</p><p>“To be able to defeat Warrior Sage and enter the final stage to battle for challenge rights in less than two years as a Physical Invulnerability expert… Since the beginning of these title competitions, he’s only the second person to do it!” The host seconded with shock and emotion.</p><p>The first to do it was the the record-holding Qian Donglou. Wherever there was a positive record for something, his name was a part of tit. Sometimes, he even took up several positions in the top ten.</p><p>For example, after he reached the Physical Invulnerability stage, in less than two years, not only did he enter the final stage to fight for challenge rights, he even made it to the finals and won two titles.</p><p>He Xiaowei continued joyously,</p><p>“Although Warrior Sage isn’t in peak condition today, Lou Cheng’s victory was enough to prove his standard and level. So now the question arises. When will Lou Cheng get his first title? When will that be? I’d like to invite everyone to my Weibo for a poll. When the results are known, I’ll give out good prizes for those who got it right.”</p><p>“You’re advertising,” the host cursed jokingly. “Xiaowei, don’t be too confident about it. Regardless of whether or not Lou Cheng is able to deflect your curse, the uncertainties in arena matches might be enough to stop him from getting a title within the next year.”</p><p>“Think about it. Unless you have outstanding strength like the Warrior Sage or Dragon King, getting a title is very much down to luck, too, especially for super-class experts like Lou Cheng. If he really wants to be the final victor, he’ll need all the benefits of opportunity, location, and luck. Take a look. Even with Warrior Sage’s outstanding strength, didn’t he fail to overcome the circumstances today? After fighting against strong enemies and having intense matches the whole way, he was finally stopped by Lou Cheng. If his luck wasn’t so bad, he would likely still have been able to obtain the challenge rights.”</p><p>He Xiaowei rubbed his smooth chin and said,</p><p>“That’s right. That’s why I dont have high hopes for Lou Cheng to obtain the challenge rights this time and get the title. He’s still lacking one of the three things: opportunity, location, and luck. He’s a little unlucky to not be matched against Ren Li today. It’s a shame that time can’t rewind. Yeah, Lou Cheng’s injuries from this battle are pretty serious. It shouldn’t be too much of a problem for Kirin, Dong Baxian, to defeat Ren Li. When it’s time for the finals, the difference will be distinct.”</p><p>“Why do I feel like you just cursed Dong Baxian…” The host gasped and continued, “Now my confidence is wavering.”</p><p>I just said it out of habit… He Xiaowei coughed twice and changed the topic.</p><p>“I just searched through the database. Lou Cheng is the youngest Physical Invulnerability expert to defeat Warrior Sage in an individual match!”</p><p>“I have a feeling that succession is happening and the era is changing. The time of the Legendary Twins is about to end. Will the next ten to fifteen years be an era of multiple potential contenders, or will there be one who dominates the field?”</p><p>“No matter what, Lou Cheng’s name will definitely be well-known. Perhaps he might really be able to get the nickname he wants and actually be the king of the field!”</p><p>“Xiaowei, you’re getting better with words. I’m getting pumped up just listening to you!” The host replied jokingly and emotionally.</p><p>…</p><p>In the room of a well-known commentator, notifications popped up the screen.</p><p>“Why did you stop talking?”</p><p>“Why did you go silent all of a sudden?”</p><p>“Come out and show us how you’ll boast! We’re all waiting to see!”</p><p>“Tell us. Did you have to go to wipe your tears or are you did you take it like a man?”</p><p>“Didn’t you have a lot to say before? Whenever Lou Cheng wins, you always have unique, non-repetitive compliments for him. Did you go dumb today?”</p><p>“Lou Cheng defeated the Warrior Sage! He defeated the Warrior Sage! Aren’t you going to say something?”</p><p>Damn it, you guys are spoiling the mood… Cai Zongming found it both hilarious and infuriating. He said,</p><p>“Don’t you guys know? This is what it means to say it best by not saying anything at all. This is the highest level of a compliment!”</p><p>“Commentator, you indeed can’t lose in an argument, no matter what.”</p><p>“He truly deserves his nickname Talker.”</p><p>“If you worked with Lou Cheng, you guys would be able to dominate every second of the arena matches!”</p><p>“I’m thinking of the fusion technique from Dragon Ball… Oh shit, I just revealed my age…”</p><p>…</p><p>VIP Suites, Jiuwen Stadium.</p><p>“Lou Cheng…wins!”</p><p>Geezer Shi raised his eyebrows after witnessing the match. He laughed out loud, extended his arm to pat to his sides, and said,</p><p>“Oh Wuguang, my disciple isn’t bad, right?”</p><p>Poof… His jab hit nothing but air.</p><p>Turning his head, he realized that the seat beside him was already empty. He hadn’t even noticed when Taoist Wuguang left.</p><p>“Where is he?” asked Shi Jianguo.</p><p>Queen of Thought, Fei Dan and the others looked at each other, but no one knew.</p><p>…</p><p>Lou Cheng was basking in the joy of winning as he walked to his personal resting room. Along the way, he collected his phone from Auman.</p><p>Yan Zheke had already sent over several emojis, like “dumbfounded,” “shocked,” “dancing happily,” “fireworks,” and “blowing a kiss”.</p><p>After all these, concerned, she asked,</p><p>“How are your injuries?”</p><p>“I have a few broken ribs and countless injuries over the rest of my body.” Lou Cheng gritted his teeth and laughed, “It’ll be great if I can recover to fifty to sixty percent of my peak by the time of the finals.”</p><p>The fractures were more than just hairline cracks and couldn’t recover in two to three days. On the day of finals, he would, at most, be able to barely maintain.</p><p>To face the current Number 3 in the world, Dong Baxian in his current condition…the outcome was easy to predict.</p><p>“That’s not too bad. One can’t possibly not pay a price for defeating Warrior Sage.” Yan Zheke tried her best to console Lou Cheng. “Perhaps Ren Li is will give Dong Baxian some trouble and leave hidden injuries on him.”</p><p>“That’s true.” Lou Cheng smiled and asked, “Ke, don’t you have class today?”</p><p>Why do I feel like you watched the whole match?</p><p>Yan Zheke replied,</p><p>“[angry emoji] I don’t give a damn!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
