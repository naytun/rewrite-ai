Since then, he had followed what Empress Luo and his master had taught him: exploring the inner strength within him, fusing his most tender emotions into his body’s will, expressing that through his mind, and blending it into his moves.</p><p>This wasn’t simple took, and it took him a good eight or nine months to just barely get the hang of it. Part of this was enabled by his unique, rough experience making the great leap; part by the aging of his parents and master; part by being apart from the girl he would spend the rest of his life with; part by the scarcity of gatherings with his friends who were busy all over the country.</p><p>Now, Yan Zheke was nearing graduation, and her schoolwork burdened her more every day. In the past, they had been able to talk a little during her lessons, but that had been taken away. Even when she was back home, she’d had too much on her hands. They had to make time for small-talk, which was limited to short windows.</p><p>Lou Cheng had already gone to America once during the New Year and now could only helplessly wait for the end of June to arrive. It truly gave him a taste of the helplessness and torment of a long-distance relationships.</p><p>At first, he tried smothering these emotions. Whenever he felt a yearning or a wave of melancholy, he tried his best to get rid of it by distracting himself or making his girl smile with his silliness, for he knew she had the same emotions as himself.</p><p>However, while exploring his inner strength, he also had to let his emotions run loose while he quietly tasted the loneliness, the yearning, and the pain of not being able to see someone he was dying to see.</p><p>The ambience brewed mysteriously, and a faint but strong feeling slowly rose to dance in the gloom of the bedroom as the gentle veil of moonlight enveloped it.</p><p>“So much to do!!! Uni’s killing me!” wrote Yan Zheke during her bathroom break.</p><p>The phone screen lit up. Lou Cheng read the message, amused and feeling sorry for her. His emotions broke the previous silence. Smiling, he replied,</p><p>“I wanted to help you, but then I remembered the last time when I skimmed through your books and even though I found every word understandable, their meanings were completely beyond me when strung together. I felt so illiterate…”</p><p>His self-deprecating humor made her chuckle and some of her weariness and tenseness melted away.</p><p>She sent a “thinking” emoji.</p><p>“As your life mentor, I think I need to give you classes when I’m back in China! I can’t let you be illiterate…”</p><p>After chatting for a bit, she once again threw herself into mental labor. Lou Cheng’s mood lightened as well.</p><p>Yes, there are still many wonderful things in life!</p><p>For example, no matter how busy Ke Ke was, she wouldn’t sacrifice their quality time. Like when she made that long, bumpy journey home during her March holiday to be with him for less than two days, despite the short duration and the many things she was juggling.</p><p>For example, his Dad was practically worshipped by his boss for his skills, and his career had been smooth sailing. For example, his mother had become fashionable, often dragging his dad or aunt to go travel, even without his encouragement. For example, his grandparents were still healthy despite reaching old age.</p><p>For example, his master’s old wounds were getting under control through his diligent practice of the Nine Words Formula which nourished his body. It seemed like living twenty to thirty more years would be no problem. For example, his cousin-in-law had found what he sought after eight months of training in the war-torn zones. Before the start of the year, he had made the great leap and attained Physical Invulnerability. For example, Hipster had progressed slowly but steadily and attained Physical Invulnerability two months before his cousin-in-law.</p><p>For example, Talker had made a name for himself in the martial arts commentary scene with his refreshing humor and eloquence. Now, he was finished with tending his dad’s company and was on his way to Didu by flight to reunite with his girlfriend. For example, Jiang Pang had gone on blind dates and finally secured a girlfriend through hard work and determination. Business at his restaurant had also been flourishing. For example, Qin Rui vaguely grasped the concept of “withdrawing” after a year as a backpacker. For example, Priest and Chihuahua got their second-pin certificates, with enough ability to make it to first-pin.</p><p>For example, he was able to proudly say, “My strength is around the super-class level.”</p><p>After the Battle of Kings a year ago, Lou Cheng had stepped up his game and registered for the Battle of Kirin elimination tournament at the end of June. However, being the center of attraction, he received fierce retaliation from the super-classes. Coupled with his atrocious luck at lot drawing, he didn’t even make it past the double-elimination segment.</p><p>He wasn’t discouraged, but gave up on the Battle of Masters main tournament in late October to save up his energy for the Battle of Kings in December.</p><p>This time, he had made it through multiple stages, despite unlucky lots, and ended the run in top eight. Following that, he shone in the Battle of Super-Class and made it to top four once again. Unfortunately, he was a step away from entering the top four round robin (plus the defending champion) when he lost first to Warrior Sage and then to Dong Baxian.</p><p>However, he had established himself as a super-class in that tournament, and no one doubted his abilities from then on.</p><p>All five title tournaments had concluded the week before, and he was about to enter a new cycle. In the previous cycle, the Dragon King successfully defeated Qian Donglou and took his Warrior Sage title. However, during the New Year, he had lost The King title to his archnemesis. On the other hand, Qian Donglou had successfully defended his The Master title while Dragon King took back the title of Super-Class. Dong Baxian barely defended his Kirin title so that the Legendary Twins wouldn’t take home all.</p><p>In the previous year of top-tier professional matches, Longhu Club was extremely unlucky. Their powerhouses were always injured during crucial matches, and they handed First in China title to Shangqing Sect as a result.</p><p>At this point, everyone was convinced that Dragon King and Warrior Sage were in a league of their own. However, at the same time, they knew that this wouldn’t last long, and that they would likely make another breakthrough in two or three years and step down from the scene.</p><p>Fragments of these thoughts surfaced as Lou Cheng’s mind went to the past. Dipping his head, he played some games on his phone.</p><p>Soon, he closed the application and laid down in the darkness once again.</p><p>After a good deal of time, he set his phone down and opened an audio file.</p><p>“Lou Cheng! Lou Cheng! Do your best, Lou Cheng!”</p><p>The silvery voice resounded in the room, again and again.</p><p>…</p><p>At the crack of dawn, Auman awoke to the strident beeping of her alarm clock.</p><p>After wiggling for a minute, she sat up and reclaimed the room’s silence.</p><p>Rubbing her eyes, she studied her room in the dim light. It was a heartwarming, girlish room. She felt happy, her heart at ease.</p><p>This was her home. A home that she could truly call her own.</p><p>After being a Physical Invulnerability expert assistant for a year, she had used the savings she had accumulated and bought a house. She had to pay in installments since the house was in a good location, but the procedures were simple and hassle-free.</p><p>She invited her parents over to supervise the construction. After letting the house air for a while after the construction, she and her parents had officially moved in the day before.</p><p>Someone who had never rented would have a hard time sympathizing with her desperate yearning to own a house. She had always felt insecure when renting or staying at a hostel provided by the company, a constant reminder that she would eventually leave.</p><p>During her renting days, she often had to move when the rent increased, or when the landlord decided to reclaim the room for their children to move in. Each time left her weary.</p><p>But now, no one could make her move. This was her home, where she truly belonged.</p><p>Auman stretched lazily and got out of bed to freshen up.</p><p>Seeing her skin had improved in the mirror, she felt joyful. At the same time, she knew that everything she owned had come from her boss, a super-class Mighty One, Mr. Lou.</p><p>Speaking of that, he really is a man of self-restraint and discipline in every aspect.</p><p>In the last year, besides going to America and Xiushan, he led a simple and routine life. Even when he wasn’t practicing, his main source of entertainment was the internet. Plus, he was disciplined and always stopped on time, never indulging himself. It was exactly as he presented himself in Shu Rui’s show.</p><p>And it wasn’t something that lasted for one or two days, but something he persevered in for three or four hundred days.</p><p>After her bestie watched the show, she had come over to gossip about it. After getting validation, she said,</p><p>“I heard that martial arts masters are usually lustful, not to mention a Physical Invulnerability expert. Your boss, on the other hand, is almost a monk! He’s reserved, guarded, disciplined, and unswayed by temptations despite his easy-going appearance. Hmm, I wonder what kind of expression he does in bed… Ahhh, I can’t help but want to try and tease him to see if I can break his spree of asceticism!”</p><p>Her bestie was getting more and more ridiculous, and Auman didn’t know what to say. However, she often found herself wondering,</p><p>What is Mr. Lou like in front of Ms. Yan?</p><p>She took out a wet tissue and cleansed her face. Patting her face, she halted her thoughts.</p><p>She was fully aware of what landed her this enviable job:</p><p>Seriousness, kindness, diligence, and attentiveness. Most importantly, she knew her place and never tried anything funny.</p><p>After grooming herself, she walked out of her room to her parents setting breakfast on the table.</p><p>“Smells so good!” she said with springy steps and a bright smile.</p><p>Mr. Lou was going to train at home today and wouldn’t leave for the airport until 7:50, which meant she didn’t have to arrive at this mansion at 5:30 and could indulge herself in a breakfast made with love.</p><p>…</p><p>At 7:45, Auman stepped out of the silver-gray minivan. She waited for a few minutes before she saw Lou Cheng walking out of his mansion with a travel bag.</p><p>“Good morning, Mr. Lou!” she smiled.</p><p>“Good morning,” nodded Lou Cheng, smiling.</p><p>Auman moved aside and pointed inside the car as the door slid open automatically.</p><p>“The breakfast you ordered has been bought.”</p><p>“Mmm,” said Lou Cheng, establishing himself in his usual seat. Pointing at the abundant dim-sums, he said, “You can have some, too.”</p><p>“No thank you Mr. Lou, I already ate. My mom made breakfast,” said Auman with a pretty smile.</p><p>Homemade breakfast? Lou Cheng zoned out for a little, remembering how his mom loved to cook a large pot of beef with bamboo shoots, put it in the refrigerator, and add a scoop to noodles in the morning.</p><p>He then remembered how a certain someone always volunteered to make breakfast when Aunt Du was off, dragging him along during mornings in Connecticut. During that time, they experimented many dishes, often fusing western food with Chinese food. As for the taste, it was open to interpretation…</p><p>He paused and exhaled silently, fully absorbing the feeling before settling down for breakfast.</p><p>“Straight to the airport, Mr. Cheng?” asked Auman.</p><p>“Mhm,” he nodded.</p><p>July 11th, which happened to be the next day, was his Master’s 65th birthday. As his disciple, it was a must for him to head to Moshang.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
