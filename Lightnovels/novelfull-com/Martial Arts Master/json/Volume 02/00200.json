Damn it. I suggested a while back that we should play that exclusive interview during the draw ceremony for the knockout. Yet they failed to make a final decision after several discussions. How weak! Why wait until the very last minute? If they had told me a little earlier, I’d have finished it before the holidays, and there would have been no need for me to work overtime.” Su Rui complained.</p><p>Cheng Mingqian held her hands like he always did in school, smiling. “That exclusive interview with Lou Cheng?”</p><p>“You know about it?” Shu Rui’s eyes lit up, and her attention was distracted as well.</p><p>Cheng Mingqian felt proud of himself. “I’m your boyfriend. How could I not know what my girl has been doing or what you have done? I remember everything you told me.”</p><p>Sui Rui laughed. “Yep. It’s that exclusive interview. Sigh. You’re also a leader. Do all leaders change their decisions at will?”</p><p>“I’m nothing like that.” Cheng Mingqian thoughtfully replied. “Rui, you don’t have to work so hard. I can support you. If you’re interested in your current job, then I’m fine with it. But if this job requires too much work and harms your health, why not be my housewife? If director Zhao calls you again, just tell him off. Let him work overtime.”</p><p>Looking at her boyfriend, Shu Rui let out a sigh. “I wish that too. However, how could I be your housewife without marrying you and meeting your parents?”</p><p><em>Meanwhile, I don’t like just being a canary.</em></p><p>Speaking of this, there was an embarrassed smile on Cheng Mingqian’s fair-skinned and good-looking face. “Rui, I assure you that my mom cannot object once my company is on track. By then, I’ll bring you to her. Just give me one more year. You have my word.”</p><p>Cheng Mingqian’s mom was a famous ‘iron’ lady in the Songcheng business circle. She was bossy enough to arrange everything for his son, including his marriage. If he had no achievements, he would not dare bring his girlfriend to his mom.</p><p>“I trust you.” Shu Rui answered with a smile.</p><p>She had heard something similar like this several times, and she had given similar replies several times.</p><p>Even when you plan to hang yourself, you need to catch a breath first. So Shu Rui let her boyfriend drop her off at the television station after they had finished their dinner.</p><p>For tonight’s date, she boldly tried a bohemian style gown with a pair of high-heeled sandals. Unfortunately these sandals which were rarely worn gave her blisters on her heels. When she got into the passenger seat, she couldn’t help rubbing the wound as it hurt so much.</p><p>Cheng Mingqian took a glance without saying anything and drove out of the underground parking lot.</p><p>A few miles down the street, he suddenly stopped the car by the roadside.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Shu Rui turned to her boyfriend, puzzled.</p><p>“Give me five minutes.” Cheng Mingqian smiled at her.</p><p>He pulled the handbrake, opened the door and headed towards the pedestrian crossing. Because something obstructed her sight, she had no idea where he was going.</p><p>Several minutes later, Cheng Mingqian came back with a bag within which was a box. He pulled out a pair of white sneakers from the box, smiling. “You’ll have to do with this pair temporarily. I think I got the right size.”</p><p>Shu Rui was touched by his thoughtfulness as her bright eyes swept across the shoes.</p><p>“I thought you didn’t notice!”</p><p>When she changed into sneakers, her grievance for working overtime was relieved by quite a bit and she was willing to chat again. After small talk, they soon arrived at the building where the television station was located.</p><p>“Call me when you have finished, I’ll pick you up.” Cheng Mingqian said while putting his thumb and little finger by his ear and mouth.</p><p>For now, he had to head back and report in.</p><p>Shu Rui waved goodbye to her boyfriend with a smile and then walked into the building carrying a handbag. While waiting for the elevator, she sighed out loud.</p><p>Her boyfriend was perfect, much better than her first love who was naive and immature, and also better than her second who was a male chauvinist. Otherwise she would not fall in love with him out of so many others. She also would not have given up the offer from Huahai Satellite TV. She came to Songcheng on her own just to be with him.</p><p>However, he was not exactly completely perfect since he was a mama’s boy.</p><p><em>Forget it, there is no perfect man in this world…”</em> Shu Rui could only console herself. She stepped into the elevator and arrived at the second newsroom where she ran into Yang Juan who had also arrived to put together Lou Cheng’s exclusive interview.</p><p>“Juan, what’re you thinking of?” Shu Rui noticed Yang Juan appeared distracted.</p><p>Yang Juan was startled by her sudden question. “Rui, don’t you make any sound when you walk?” She spoke with her hands folded across her chest.</p><p>“You were thinking too hard.” Shu Rui chuckled.</p><p>Yang Juan turned to Shu Rui, hesitated for a while and said, “Rui, can I ask you something? My friend has fallen in love with a man and she wants to make the first move. Can you give her some advice?”</p><p>Shu Rui could not hold back her smile. “Juan, I assume that friend is you.”</p><p>Yang Juan blushed upon hearing this, knowing her story was too lame.</p><p>Shu Rui stopped smiling and said earnestly. “I can’t say that every man is the same, but most of them are easy to seduce. Get his contact details and chat with him every day. Don’t worry about the topic. Remember to be more active, optimistic and cute. But don’t overdo it. Don’t talk too long, but you should let him know that you are interested in him. Trust me, it’ll take you three months at most to get him. As for whether he’ll be your boyfriend or just a friend with benefits, it depends on how he sees the relationship.”</p><p>“That simple?” Yang Juan looked shocked.</p><p>Shu Rui stretched her hands out and said, “But first you have to learn how to apply makeup and dress yourself. At least you need to make yourself look attractive, and this only works for some men, not all.”</p><p>“Have you tried this before?” Yang Juan blurted out.</p><p>“Nope.” Shu Rui answered with an innocent look, “I have never made the initial move. My former roommate told me this and she successfully picked up several men.”</p><p>“How did they end up?” Yang Juan curiously asked.</p><p>There was a twitch in the corner of Shu Rui’s mouth. “I’m embarrassed to mention her because she only enjoys flirting. When the man starts to take the initiative, she’ll lose her interest and drop him.”</p><p>“Nothing is too strange in this big world…” Yang Juan sighed with complex feelings.</p><p>Shu Rui put down her handbag and picked up a glass. There was a curve at the corner of her mouth.</p><p>“Talk to me on Wechat if you have any problems. Now let’s work on Lou Cheng’s exclusive interview, so we can go home earlier.”</p><p>…</p><p>At 9 o’clock on Sunday evening, Zong Yanru came out from next door and saw Li Liantong holding a glass, watching television while sitting on the couch.</p><p>“Dirty Tong, what’re you watching?” She asked curiously.</p><p>LI Liantong laughed while changing the channels. “The draw ceremony for the knockout tournament is being held tonight.”</p><p>“What elimination round?” Zong Yanru was lost.</p><p>“The tournament for martial arts clubs, remember?” Li Liantong added.</p><p>“Right. I’d forget it if you had not reminded me,” said Zong Yanru .</p><p>“Me too. Luckily Ke reminded me at noon.” Li Liantong explained. “I do not understand the rules for this competition. The group competition finished in the first week of April and it took organizers almost one month to hold the draw ceremony. Who would remember without paying special attention?”</p><p>Zong Yanru sat next to her and seemed unbothered. “I’m sure the school will publicize it.”</p><p>Although almost ten thousand spectators were coming to the auditorium, most of them went there for fun. Few would follow the news when it was no longer in the spotlight. They gradually forgot about the competition since there was other things in their life, such as studying, dating, reading novels, video gaming, online shopping and so on. Also there were always new headlines and topics every day to draw their attention. Everybody was busy after all.</p><p>“Yeah!” Li Liantong took a sip from the glass and gazed at the screen. “Don’t talk anymore. The ceremony begins now.”</p><p>Few events like this had been held in Songcheng University, and forum users such as Yan Xiaoling and other Lou Cheng’s supporters had already had a frenzied discussion, hoping Lou Cheng’s squad would not meet powerful opponents.</p><p>Lou Cheng, Yan Zheke and other members who participated in the special training gathered in the already closed arena, watching the live show from the laptop in Geezer Shi’s office.</p><p>They gradually became nervous after the first group of draws were performed and anxiously waited for the second group.</p><p>“The second group, Songcheng University Martial Arts Club.” One female guest took out the first ball.</p><p>Inside the office, everyone seemed to hold their breath. The upcoming draw determined how much revenue they would receive from the live broadcast.</p><p>The female guests took out another ball, carefully looked at it and announced loudly,</p><p>“Donglin Squad!”</p><p>“Songcheng University Martial Arts Club versus Donglin Squad.”</p><p>“Ohh…” Lou Cheng and the other members exhaled with relief upon hearing the result.</p><p>They did not get the worst draw.</p><p>Monday Squad from Songcheng had one fighter of the Seventh Pin in Dan stage and one fighter of the Eighth Pin in Dan stage. They aimed to advance during knockout and went for the preliminaries in the second stage.</p><p>Meanwhile, Donglin Squad came from Donglin city, which was another economic pillar in this province. The squad built upon a local sect with a thousand-year history. They were led by fighters of the high-ranked Dan Stage. So Donglin Squad was regarded as the leading representative in the Donglin martial arts circle.</p><p>“Donglin Squad has one fighter of the Eighth Pin in Dan stage and three of Professional Ninth Pin. Those fighters are young representatives of Wensheng School, stronger than members of the Fearless Squad.” Yan Zheke explained.</p><p>She had already gone through all the profiles of the final eight. After all, it did not require much work.</p><p>“We still stand a chance…” Sun Jian smiled at Lou Cheng and Lin Que.</p><p>The knockout used the host-guest tournament system. The squad which got the first ball played on the road then at home. If each squad got a victory, then scores would be added up according to the number of wins. If their number of wins was the same, then competition would be held between substitutes after the second match so that the overall strength of the squad would be measured.</p><p><em>“Another Mighty one in Dan stage…”</em> Lou Cheng grew excited but also a little nervous.</p><p><em>Wensheng School’s position in martial arts circle was proven by its long history, so by no means can we underestimate their disciples in the Dan stage.</em></p><p>Yan Zheke was about to say something when she saw video clips which introduced the fighters from both sides being played during the interval.</p><p>They stopped talking and focused on these official profiles. While watching, Yan Zheke suddenly turned to Lou Cheng, amazed and exhilarated.</p><p>“Cheng, is that the interview you mentioned before?”</p><p><em>Why did they release this video after so long?</em></p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
