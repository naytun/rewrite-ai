A spring storm was brewing. Songcheng University Martial Arts Arena had no choice but to turn on all its lights earlier than scheduled, lighting up the whole arena.</p><p>As compared to the previous week where many came unprepared, though the students did not bring along light sticks or trumpets to cheer the fighters on, many students were feeling excited about this year’s match as they recalled last year’s awful experience. Their hopes and joyfulness brought waves and waves of cheers, which gradually got louder and louder.</p><p>As they heard the cheers for Songcheng University, the leader of the muscular Azure Dragon Squad, Mo Zicong, could not help but sigh.</p><p>“When can we have such grand spectators at our home court, with such great atmosphere…”</p><p>He and his three other team mates did not find a seat, but stood at the back at the highest point of the spectator’s area, as though they were four pillars or four bouncers.</p><p>Deng Hua, the man with the Mohican-looking hairstyle, wiped off the relaxed look on his face. He smiled bitterly and said,</p><p>“That’s what others have created, not something we can learn. Unless we’re able to get into the preliminaries…”</p><p>They were Songcheng’s local battle team, not as exclusive as Yimo’s, neither were they like Songcheng University Martial Arts Club who naturally had thousands of students as supporters. They need to compete with other strong teams for supporters. Furthermore, Songcheng as a provincial capital already had two teams entering the third stage of the district contest, which meant that it had already gathered in most of the corresponding market. What remained were only a few slots for the strong teams in the preliminaries stage.</p><p>Azure Dragon Squad was formed from a combination of three martial arts schools, and they rented Songcheng city martial arts arena second lounge as their home court, which could contain thousands of spectators at the stand instead of the usual 600 to 700 spectators. This was also why many people would habitually come to watch a few matches during the weekends.</p><p>Therefore, they saw the importance of advancing in tournaments. This would mean more live broadcasts, more spectators and higher chances of getting the martial arts scholarship. After they lost to the Yimo Fearless Squad, they were left with no choice but to defeat Songcheng University Martial Arts Club!</p><p>Thus, they purposely took the opportunity that their tournament was held on a weekend to come to Songcheng University and observe Lou Cheng. Afterall he was a genius who had achieved a professional level within half a year. His two weeks rest due to injuries might have resulted in some changes. This tournament was not a critical one, so there would not be any live broadcast, only a replay later. It was also unknown to them when the TV station would broadcast so they might not see it in time.</p><p>…</p><p>In the home team’s locker room, Geezer Shi took a sip of wine before he casually advised Lou Cheng, Sun Jian, Li Mao and Yan Zheke,</p><p>“Last few points to note, Peng Chengguang indeed has potential. If he could master a better set of martial arts skills, he’d have no trouble entering Dan stage within a year. I’ll consider him within Songcheng Top Ten Professional Ninth Pin fighters. However, I always feel that Top Ten Professional Ninth Pin fighters ranking is crap. When you guys were in school, aren’t there rankings like Grade Top Ten and Class Top Ten? These are very normal ranking, but yet schools want to come out with this Top Ten consolidation. Do you think it’s meaningful at all?”</p><p>Hahaha… Lou Cheng and the others found it amusing and instantly burst out laughing, which made the atmosphere more relaxed.</p><p>Even though they were also grouped by Coach Shi and were placed in the “poor students” category, since he’s a Mighty One with physical invulnerability, who could refute his decision to do so?</p><p>Geezer Shi was pleased with the effect his words brought. He happily added, “Sun Jian, Li Mao, you guys will fight first. In Mingwei Martial Arts School, regardless of Peng Chengguang, whether they’re Gao Rao, Zhang Ying, Qu Yu or Liu Wei, their levels are on par with you. Just do your best and fight with no worries. Anyway, Lou Cheng would be the final fighter, so if we lose, we’ll push the blame to him!”</p><p>Haha… Lou Cheng chortled as he raised his hand to protest. “Coach Shi, you’re giving me a lot of pressure!”</p><p>Yan Zheke, who was beside him, covered her mouth and laughed gently. Li Mao was also feeling much more relaxed.</p><p>“Pressure?” Geezer Shi would never admit that he said it on purpose. Instead he laughed and added, “I remembered this is your first battle in home ground?”</p><p>Lou Cheng was stunned by his words as he solemnly nodded his head and replied,</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>Indeed, I’ve almost forgotten about it. This is my first time representing Songcheng University Martial Arts Club to battle at school!</p><p>Geezer Shi nodded slightly, pointed out and said, “Listen.”</p><p>The locker room was instantly silent. Lou Cheng listened attentively as he heard the familiar cheering. It was the familiar waves of cheer that had once shocked him and left him with an extremely deep impression.</p><p>“Songcheng University! Songcheng University!”</p><p>“Songcheng University! Songcheng University!”</p><p>This time, they’re cheering for us!</p><p>“Heard that?” Geezer Shi chuckled and asked.</p><p>“Heard it!” Lou Cheng nodded strongly.</p><p>Geezer Shi then smiled and asked, “Do you feel the pressure?”</p><p>“Yes.” Lou Cheng did not hide his fear as his body shivered. He could feel Yan Zheke’s sleek hand slowly grabbing his left hand.</p><p>Geezer Shi’s expression suddenly turned solemn, as he asked in a low voice,</p><p>“Then, do you want to win?”</p><p>Lou Cheng could hear the reverberation of the cheers in his ears and felt a warm gush of blood in his chest. He shouted,</p><p>“Yes!”</p><p>…</p><p>In the away team’s locker room, Peng Chengguang sat on the long bench as he looked at his surrounding juniors and smiled.</p><p>“Why do you all look like you all have made mistakes?”</p><p>He was wearing a dark gray martial arts suit with a common-looking brush cut. His facial features were average-looking, but the edge of his face was sharp. He gave off a trustworthy vibe and looked extremely highly-trained.</p><p>Zhang Ying, who had a doll-like face, bit her lower lip. She said, “Elder Senior Brother, we, we often feel that we’re a burden to you. Since Master passed away, you’re one who has been supporting the martial arts school and helps us so that we don’t have to return to the welfare center. However, we, we’re not only unable to repay you, but we have always caused you to fail. For many years, we’re unable to advance, or get the award for martial arts unique skills…”</p><p>“Elder Senior BrotherSenior, if you had agreed to collaborate and join other teams, you might have already, already obtained excellent martial arts skills, and entered Dan stage. We’re really useless, and will only be a liability to you, Elder Senior Brother!” Gao Rao, who had long limbs, started to self-depreciate.</p><p>Peng Chengguang raised his hand to stop them and said,</p><p>“Enough. I’ve promised Master to carry forward the martial arts school, so that I can give each of you a bright future. This is my choice, so it’s not something you should be concerned with.”</p><p>“Moreover, I can’t just depend on myself to enhance the martial arts school, I need all of you to help. Unity is the strength, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Don’t worry much about this preliminary. Our current objective is to take this opportunity to strengthen ourselves. Obviously, if we win, it’ll be great, but even if we lose, it doesn’t matter. Once we have such experience, maybe next year, or the year after next, one of you may become a professional fighter. By then, as long as we’re united and help one another, advancing will be easy! I’m still young. I can still wait.”</p><p>Hearing Elder Senior Brother’s words, Gao Rao stopped feeling guilty. Instead, he got worried. He added, “Elder Senior Brother, Lou Cheng from Songcheng University Martial Arts Club would probably be fighting today. You must be careful.”</p><p>Upon hearing it, Qu Yu, who was beside him, disagreed as she rebutted. “Senior Brother Gao, Lou Cheng may be strong, but he’s still weaker than our Elder Senior Brother. Our Elder Senior Brother has a body quality of a Professional Ninth Pin fighter!”</p><p>“But Lou Cheng mastered mercurial balance, and his stamina is crazy…” Liu Wei commented as he started to worry as well.</p><p>Peng Chengguang stopped his juniors from arguing as he grinned and nodded his head. He said,</p><p>“Lou Cheng is strong, definitely an opponent to be aware of. Facing with such a Mighty One, I should be modest and say that I’ll be happy if I win, and this battle is also worth it if I lose. However, I can’t bring myself to say it.”</p><p>After he finished his sentence, he touched his left chest and added, “The stronger the opponent I meet, the faster it beats, as if it is telling me…”</p><p>He suddenly stood up, and said with determination,</p><p>“I want victory!”</p><p>…</p><p>After all the preparations, Geezer Shi allowed some free time for Lou Cheng and the others while they were waiting to get on the ring.</p><p>Lou Cheng should be closing his eyes to rest before doing some warm-ups for the battle, but he noticed that Yan Zheke had taken out her phone and was typing fiercely.</p><p>Buzz! His phone rang in his pocket.</p><p>Curiously, he took out his phone and saw a message from his girl, who sent him a “pity-looking” emoji. She added, “I’m so mad!”</p><p>“Why?” Lou Cheng asked, with puzzled emoji.</p><p>“Just kidding…” Yan Zheke replied with a blushing emoji. “Just a little disappointed. I thought I have the chance to go in the ring today. I kept feeling that with my balancing and listening skills, I’m not any weaker than Senior Brother Sun Jian and Senior Brother Li Mao… (squatting down in a corner drawing circles) Am I getting arrogant? Complacent?”</p><p>If it was Little Ming, Lou Cheng would say “You bitch! Just won a match and you’re getting all proud!”. However, towards his girlfriend, it had to be said differently, “You’re between an Amateur Second and Third Pin. Though you’re on par with them regarding skills, you lack experience.”</p><p>“Okay, I’ll gain more experience from next week’s Amateur Ranking Event!” Yan Zheke replied with an “eyes shining brightly” emoji.</p><p>The 1st Annual Amateur Ranking Event was here again!</p><p>Lou Cheng unconsciously revealed a smile on his face as he asked, “Which Pin are you registering for?”</p><p>“Amateur Second Pin! One needs a goal to work for!” Yan Zheke replied with a “red scarf tied on the head and looking determined” emoji. She then added, “Eh, I think I’ve said something similar before, and just my goal was Amateur Fifth Pin at that time…”</p><p>“Yep.” Lou Cheng recalled and said, “That time I felt that registering for Amateur Seventh Pin was too daring a move.”</p><p>“In the end, now…” Yan Zheke commented with a “face full of tears” emoji.</p><p>Before Lou Cheng could reply, Yan Zheke sent him another message:</p><p>“Faster close your eyes and rest! Stop looking at your phone! If you can’t perform well later, humph, this week you don’t even think of that!”</p><p>“You are the one who initiated the message…” Lou Cheng gave a silent judgment, then replied with a shocking emoji,</p><p>“Yes, Coach Yan!”</p><p>Seeing her boyfriend finally put down his phone and obediently closed his eyes to rest and meditate, Yan Zheke felt the sweetness in her heart. She grinned slightly, revealing the dimples on her face. Just as she was about to do the same, she suddenly noticed that the door of the locker room was opened and Lin Que came through the door.</p><p>“Cousin is so late today…” While she remained amazed by the fact that his cousin was late, she saw Lin Que gestured her to look at her phone. He was expressionless at the same time.</p><p>Ay? See the phone?</p><p>Yan Zheke looked down and felt her phone vibrating as she saw the message sent by Lin Que.</p><p>“Last week at Tiantong Taoist temple, not only did Xie Tianque saw Lou Cheng with you, Uncle Xie saw the both of you as well. This week when he went to visit Grandpa, he casually mentioned about it.”</p><p>“Your mom called me and asked if it’s true.”</p><p>“This…” Yan Zheke suddenly shivered a little. She felt as though her heart was going to stop beating.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
