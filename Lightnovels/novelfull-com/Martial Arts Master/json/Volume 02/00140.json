You may be able to test it personally very soon.”</p><p>Li Liantong’s dirty talk caused Yan Zheke’s face to turn bright red, but she immediately changed the topic by attacking Li Liantong herself, “Dirty Tong, look at you. Why are you so dirty even though you have such a pure and innocent appearance?”</p><p>“I call this storing up on theoretical knowledge.” Li Liantong said with a straight face.</p><p>Yan Zheke continued, “So who among the two boys who chased you do you fancy?”</p><p>“None of them!” Li Liantong abruptly came to realization, “Ke, don’t you try changing the topic to me. You have to bring your boyfriend out and show us just who is it who managed to capture your affection! You can’t keep a horse or a donkey penned up forever!”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah! I can’t believe your boyfriend hasn’t treated us to a meal yet! This is unacceptable as your boyfriend! God knows what he did to capture your affection!” Zong Yanru joined in on the fun as well. She was a little plump, but she wasn’t ugly looking. Although she was born in an estranged family, it nurtured a generous and caring temperament in her instead.</p><p>Shi Xiangyang immediately slapped the bed plank and echoed, “I want to see my love rival directly. I want to know on what basis he kidnapped our white, soft and sweet Ke!”</p><p>Shi Xiangyang was a tall girl with slightly tanned skin. She looked a little muddle-headed without her spectacles, but when she put on her spectacles, picked up a surgical knife and faced little white mice and little white rabbits, she looked a little like the cruel killer Li Liantong described her to be.</p><p>Yan Zheke could not beat back the rioting girls, and so she could only surrender and promise them,</p><p>“Fine fine fine, I’ll bring him over to meet you all and treat you to lunch when there’s time.”</p><p>…</p><p>Lou Cheng took out his keys with his left hand and opened the main door of his dormitory. The living hall was empty, but the smell of alcohol was in the air.</p><p>“A weekend communal meal, and an online gaming session along the way?” he made guesses about the reason behind the invitation familiarly and strolled back to his own small dormitory.</p><p>Suddenly, he heard the sound of the doorknob being turned swiftly and felt a flash through his mind. He immediately took a few steps backward.</p><p>It was at this moment Cai Zongming and the others opened the dormitory’s wooden door. Zhao Qiang, Qin Mo and the others jumped out and sprayed randomly at the front while holding spray ribbons used during birthday celebrations. The ribbons nearly landed beside Lou Cheng’s feet and covered his entire head.</p><p>“Welcome back for triumphing over the opponent, our great expert!” Cai Zongming cast a sneaky glance at Lou Cheng and said, “Surprise?”</p><p>“Surprise, not!” Lou Cheng let out a laughing abuse, “why did you guys think of doing this?”</p><p>Thank goodness my senses were acute and I backed away in time. Otherwise, I would have to bath yet again!</p><p>This was a slightly difficult task considering that one of his arms were hurt!</p><p>Cai Zongming pointed at Qin Mo and said, “We were going to congratulate you verbally after asking about your injury over the phone, but Qin Mo insisted on doing this and make things more lively and grandiose. We’re free anyway, so we decided that we would just throw a surprise.”</p><p>He wore the helpless look of an adult fooling about according to the kids’ wishes, but Lou Cheng remembered clearly that student Little Ming was the one who looked the proudest and created the biggest havoc! Surprise, he says!</p><p>“I’m not fooling around. I’m showing my gratitude to Cheng for winning me respect in front of my friends!” the cultured animal Qin Mo immediately retorted.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Cai Zongming asked in astonishment. He obviously hadn’t heard Qin Mo bringing this up earlier.</p><p>Zhao Qiang and the others looked curious and waited for Qin Mo to answer their doubts.</p><p>Qin Mo laughed mischievously and said, “Allow me to drink a mouthful of hot shit and explain things from the beginning.”</p><p>Pu… Lou Cheng nearly broke into laughter. He felt keenly that Qin Mo’s temperament was pretty great and sociable even though he did not share much interactions regarding entertainment with his roommates as a rich kid.</p><p>…</p><p>During the afternoon, after they were done watching Lou Cheng and his team’s difficult and desperate battles, everyone in the dormitory felt as if they had exhausted all of their energy as well.</p><p>Qin Mo took out his cell phone, snapped a blurry television image, started QQ Talk and shared it with his friends boastfully, saying,</p><p>“Congratulations to my awesome roommate for obtaining victory and defeating three opponents on his own!”</p><p>When they were done playing a few rounds of games online, he picked up his cell phone once more and checked if there were any replies. He saw many people liking his post and asking what type of match was it.</p><p>When he posted a general ‘preliminaries group stages’ answer, he noticed that a friend who often butted heads with him replying and saying, “What kind of great fighters could you university students possibly have? I know a true young expert who’s rather famous in the entire Songcheng martial arts circle. When he was pressed down by three big men last time, he only needed to shake once to send them all flying out of the way. He’s great, isn’t he!”</p><p>“Zeng Xiao’er, you boast better than my own singing! My friend has beaten a Professional Ninth Pin before!” Qin Mo could not help but boast back.</p><p>Zeng Xiao’er’s real name was Zeng Xiaowen. He had an elder sister in the family and could be considered a proper rich kid.</p><p>Zeng Xiaowen immediately replied with a ‘loud laugh’ and said, “Stop boasting already, animal. There’s no way a fighter who could beat a Professional Ninth Pin is obscure. Tell me his name; maybe I know this guy? Should I ask the expert I know to spar with him?”</p><p>“Why not. His name is Lou Cheng. Go check him out yourself if you think you’re so good!” Qin Mo put on a brave front and said.</p><p>Zeng Xiaowen was drinking afternoon tea with his friends, and when he saw the reply on his cell phone he let out a chuckle, looked up and asked,</p><p>“My brother loves to talk big the most, and he says he knows a super awesome young expert. Can you help check if it’s real?”</p><p>The young man with a sharp countenance sitting beside him smiled and said, “A super awesome young expert? I should know if he’s in Songcheng’s circle then.”</p><p>Zeng Xiaowen chuckled and said, “Didn’t I tell you? He loves talking big the most. If this guy turns out to be some random amateur fighter, then there’s no way you’ll recognize him.”</p><p>“Tell me, what’s his name? Maybe we can spar for a bit.” the young man with a sharp countenance smiled calmly.</p><p>Zeng Xiaowen took a sip of tea and said, “He’s called Lou Cheng or something. I’ve never even heard about him!”</p><p>However, the young man with a sharp countenance was stunned on the spot. A long while later, he finally asked, “Songcheng University’s Lou Cheng?”</p><p>“Er, yeah, sure. My brother is from Songcheng University, and he says that Lou Cheng is his classmate.” Zeng Xiaowen observed his friend’s expression and said, “Is he really that good?”</p><p>The young man with a sharp countenance nodded heavily, “He’s very good.”</p><p>“How does he measure up to you?” Zeng Xiaowen asked again in astonishment.</p><p>Right now he was at the young age when he was receiving education, and the mature Danqi State experts would at best act amiably around him as a show of respect to his father, and the ordinary ones would not mingle with him. Among all the fighters whom he shared a good relationship with, the person before him was the absolute best!</p><p>The young man with a sharp countenance recalled the competition that had just ended not long ago, the hand gesture that shut up every person in the arena, and the fact that the other party had only practiced martial arts for half a year. Although he was reluctant to admit it, he ultimately nodded,</p><p>“He’s stronger than me…”</p><p>“He’s stronger than you…” Zeng Xiaowen sucked in a chilled breath.</p><p>He no longer dared to reply to Qin Mo’s follow-up questions and bring up the topic of sparring any longer.</p><p>…</p><p>“Haha, I’m shaking with joy the second I imagine the beaten look on Zeng Xiao’er’s face! Cheng, you’re awesome now. You can be considered famous even in the whole Songcheng martial arts circle!” Qin Mo said in a carefree tone.</p><p>Before Lou Cheng could say anything, Qiu Zhigao immediately asked in puzzlement, “How did you know what happened on the other side? You even know about the details of the conversation…”</p><p>Qin Mo laughed, “They’re not the only two people drinking afternoon tea at that time. Most of Zeng Xiao’er’s friends are my friends too. They sold him the second they looked away!”</p><p>Although he was reluctant to admit it, Lou Cheng himself felt a little pleased on the inside. After a moment’s pondering, he asked, “Who is that young fighter Zeng Xiao’er know of? Maybe I know him too.”</p><p>“He’s called Pan, Pan Chengyun.” Qin Mo said honestly.</p><p>Lou Cheng frowned and shook his head, “He sounds a little familiar, but I probably don’t know him…”</p><p>His roommates did not fuss over this question either. Cai Zongming chuckled, “Cheng, they say it’s time to give you a new nickname. I personally find Iron Lungs, Four Lungs, Eight Lungs and the like are too average. I suggest the nickname ‘Perpetual Motion Machine’!”</p><p>Lou Cheng was startled for a moment before he mulled over for a bit, “Perpetual Motion Machine… it’s not bad, but something just doesn’t feel quite right…”</p><p>“What do you mean? Perpetual Motion Machine has infinite stamina, right?” Cai Zongming explained, but he made the hand gesture of a piledriver with a dirty smile on his face and said, “You are forever in motion!”</p><p>“Get out, you dirty fellow! I don’t know you!” Lou Cheng let out a laughing abuse.</p><p>While chatting and laughing, the main entrance suddenly opened to reveal Tang Wen returning from outside.</p><p>“Tang Wen, hadn’t you gone to sit for the makeup exam for calculus?” Qin Mo asked in astonishment.</p><p>Tang Wen said with a dazed look, “Yeah, the exam is over. It was all the knowledge stuff Professor Zhang told me yesterday afternoon. He didn’t accept my gifts…”</p><p>“Professor Zhang is truly a model lecturer.” Zhao Qiang exclaimed with a sigh of admiration, “He does not intentionally stop others from passing with their results.”</p><p>An expression that was uglier than a cry suddenly appeared on Tang Wen’s face,</p><p>“But I still don’t know how to do it…”</p><p>Lou Cheng and the others were immediately stunned by the reveal. They looked at each other and could not find a proper point to ridicule or comfort him.</p><p>After returning to his small dormitory, Lou Cheng put his cell phone in place properly and typed swiftly on the keyboard with his left hand. He shared his moment of limelight even without being present with Yan Zheke.</p><p>Yan Zheke ‘covered her mouth and smiled sneakily’, saying, “That’s awesome. You’re a person whose name would flood the screen now, Cheng!”</p><p>After chatting for a few lines, she brought up her roommates’ request, “Those girls said they want you to treat them and see if you have three heads and six arms!”</p><p>“I’ll have to disappoint them then. Right now I am just a one-armed hero…” Lou Cheng was extraordinarily pleased that Yan Zheke was willing to share their relationship with her roommates, “As for when we’ll be having this meal, please decide the date and time for us, Coach Yan!”</p><p>“Let’s make it Monday afternoon then.” Yan Zheke used a pitiable round eye emoji and replied, “You have no idea how badly they teased me!”</p><p>Lou Cheng hastily consoled her and listened to her grumblings. It was only when she had gone to work on her homework that Lou Cheng opened the web browser to check the praises on his own forum.</p><p>Suddenly, he was stunned when he opened the forum. That was because all of the threads were abuses aimed towards him, saying that he was a ‘thrash who played dirty’, a ‘disgusting lecher who did not have a shred of fighter honor at all’, a ‘nasty character who happened to achieve his dreams for a time’, an ‘immoral character’, and that his ‘arrogance would soon conclude badly’ and so on…</p><p>“The forum’s been flooded?” Lou Cheng was not unfamiliar with this. While he was a little angry, annoyed and worried for his own fans, he quickly calmed down and closed the web page rationally.</p><p>Arguing with these fellows was not only a waste of time, but also a pollution of one’s feelings as well. Plus, they were only venting for a short while. Once it was over, he could help bump some quality threads to the front page.</p><p>The best way to humiliate them in return was to grow stronger and defeat more and more opponents. He would make it so that they could only look up to him! He would make it so that their spat salivas could only land back onto themselves!</p><p>When he calmed down once more, Lou Cheng recalled every detail o today’s match and analyzed his own countermeasures from an observer’s point of view. He inspected his own mistakes and habits, and gradually he felt that he had gained something entirely new. For example, he learned that attacking an opponent’s groin wasn’t bad or ineffective, but if he attacked there whenever the opportunity presented itself, he would easily fall into the enemy’s trap.</p><p>When he and Yan Zheke bid ‘good night’ to each other, he felt that he had grown stronger again.</p><p>My enemy’s hatred is the best praise I can receive!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
