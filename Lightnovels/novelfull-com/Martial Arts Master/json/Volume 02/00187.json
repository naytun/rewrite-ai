The big screen paused when Lou Cheng’s fist collided with Mo Zicong’s. Ripples seemed to break out from the point of impact, causing some of the audience to forget the worry they felt when Sun Jian was kicked out of the ring. They stared intently at the clash of fists and forgot to cheer for their own team.</p><p>This confrontation happened only for an instant, but Mo Zicong felt as if it lasted for an entire century. While holding his guard up against the effects of the tremor, he felt cold currents seeping into his body along with his opponent’s power instead. It instantly froze his arms and spread all over his body, making him feel like he was staying overnight in a world of ice and snow, tens of Celsius beneath the freezing point, naked.</p><p>He couldn’t help but tremble uncontrollably. His lips immediately turned blue from the cold as one thought came to dominate his mind.</p><p>&lt;m i=’7′&gt;”好冷!”&lt;/m&gt;”好冷!”</p><p>It also wasn’t easy for Lou Cheng since Frost Force wasn’t a unique skill that could increase power. While Mo Zicong was born with great power and was outstanding in this aspect among all the fighters of Professional Ninth Pin. He was only inferior to Ye Youting, who was like a superman with great power. In addition, he still practiced the fighting style “Throwing Elephant” which was known for its ability to increase power, so if he punched out with full strength, its power was as strong as the erupting power of Jiang Guosheng in the Hongluo Martial Arts School.</p><p>The power Jiang Guosheng attacked with when he used his full strength had touched the edge of the Dan stage!</p><p>So, Lou Cheng dared not wrest this attack for fear that it would hurt his right arm because the attack contained a strong power which felt like it could throw an elephant. After he understood the situation, he couldn’t defend it by only moving backwards, so he bounced his back and took the initiative to swing his center of gravity backwards.</p><p>He took three steps backwards. From the beginning, he stepped on the ground so hard that he even broke the black brick, but at last, he unloaded the power, stepping on the ground normally with the brick still intact.</p><p>Even now, Mo Zicong heard the strong beating of his heart, pound, pound, pound. His heart was constantly surging with hot blood to ease the chill all over his body.</p><p><em>What</em> is martial art <em>this?</em></p><p><em>There isn’t even a way for me to resist or guard against it!</em></p><p>He looked at Lou Cheng in astonishment, wanting to catch up with him, but his body was still trembling and his legs were still stiff. It was difficult for him to take even one step forward, so he had to hope that the temperature of his blood could help him recover from this condition.</p><p><em>Seriously, What martial art is this?</em></p><p>…</p><p>After Zhu Tao noticed that Lou Cheng had rushed towards Mo Zicong, he didn’t hesitate anymore. He exerted force into his legs and took a step forward to catch up with Yan Zheke who was staggering backwards. He was about to take the opportunity to defeat her before she found her center of gravity, while she couldn’t fight back.</p><p>Bang. He shook his right arm and punched out directly towards the opponent’s neck. When Yan Zheke realized that she couldn’t resist this attack, she simply gave up her center of gravity, bent backwards, kicked a high-flying kick, and then she performed the Lazy Donkey Rolling on the Ground.</p><p>At this time, Li Mao and Lin Hua arrived just in time. One of them tightened his muscles and launched a whip kick from behind towards the middle of Zhu Tao’s legs. The kick even brought the sound of wind. The other one sank his waist, cut his fist downwards and attacked the temple on his opponent from the side.</p><p>Both of them didn’t hesitate as they aimed for the vital parts of their opponent!</p><p>Confronted with this situation, Zhu Tao seemed to have predicted it, so he bounced his waist and back, bulged his glowing black skin, and actually moved a small step to the left side forcibly. In the end, Li Mao’s foot only kicked his thigh and Lin Hua’s cutting fist only hit on his right shoulder.</p><p>&lt;m i=’24’&gt;噗!&lt;/m&gt;噗!The attacks of Li Mao and Lin Hua were too weak to break the Iron Canvas Shirt of their opponent.</p><p>While Zhu Tao, on the contrary, had borrowed some power from their attack and rushed forwards. As he was about to pass by Yan Zheke, he stretched out his hands to grasp her right arm. And then he fell on the ground relying on the inertia and threw her out of the ring.</p><p>Yan Zheke felt like she was walking on air as she forced herself to be calm. She slightly adjusted her body in the air and controlled her center of gravity, then bounced her spine, exerted force on her waist, turned over like a sparrowhawk, and dropped onto the ground lightly. She stood on the ground firmly without falling, but the only problem was that she was already outside of the ring.</p><p><em>“I’m so angry, but I still have to keep smiling so I won’t affect the other members and Cheng…”</em> she pursed her lips and thought. While she was watching the match in the ring, she walked along the edge of the ring towards the home seats.</p><p>No matter how much the preparation was or how much the analysis was, it still wasn’t enough in a real battle with endless permutations.</p><p>As he succeeded in this attack, Zhu Tao felt relieved like a big stone within his heart had landed. He took several steps forward and turned around by the power of walking. Then he rushed towards Li Mao and Lin Hua.</p><p>This time, he didn’t need to worry about being besieged by anymore!</p><p>Could fighting with two amateur fighters be called a siege?</p><p>…</p><p>At that time, Lou Cheng had unloaded most of the power and borrowed the remaining power to exert it into his feet, breaking the black brick under his feet as he rushed forwards more ferociously by using the borrowed power.</p><p>Whether the students in the arena, or the audience in front of the computer or TV screens were surprised, Mo Zicong missed the opportunity when Lou Cheng lost his center of gravity and stumbled backwards. But when Yan Xiaoling, Brahman, and the others thought of Peng Chengguang in the last fight, they nodded like they understood everything and said to themselves,</p><p>“Well, this is Tremor Punch!”</p><p>Only Peng Leyun, who sat in the office of Shanbei University Martial Arts Club, slightly frowned and stared at Mo Zicong’s lips that had become cyanotic and pale.</p><p>As Lou Cheng rushed towards his opponent, who hadn’t completely recovered yet, Lou Cheng quickly adjusted his body slightly to correspond with the “Frozen Ground Diagram” within in his mind, so that part of his muscles, fascias, and joints could be ready for it. And because he just started to learn the Thunder Roar Zen, he had yet to practice this martial art until it was ingrained in his bones and body. All he could do was influence his internal organs indirectly with a deep respiration exercise. It meant that he needed to prepare for a while before he could attack with the Frost Force, so he couldn’t do it instantly.</p><p>And because he was only able to control a bit of this martial art, It also could not be combined with “Thunder Roar Zen,” nor could he use the unique skill of the latter, which was called “Severe Warning.”</p><p>Lou Cheng rushed in front of Mo Zicong within two steps. After adjusting his body completely, he was ready to fight again, so he began picturing the rolling and turbid river again.</p><p>Crack! Lou Cheng stepped on the ground so heavily, completely breaking the black brick which had already been stepped on and broken. He bounced his ankle joint and knee, straightened his back, threw his shoulder, and struck out with a Forward Punch which seemed very ordinary.</p><p>While at the same time, the stored force in his body also broke out. The power was added to the waves and created a frozen feeling which also magnified the Power of Frost, changing the force into a cold wave. Then it rolled towards his fist.</p><p>Lou Cheng visualized the scene of coldness striking the river with a strong power that suddenly froze it. It was covered with frozen layers and even the spray scattered in the air was frozen like a crafted work of art.</p><p>Affected by this, the muscles, the viscera, and fascia in Lou Cheng’s once body again changed subtly, creating some strange waves. He changed the chill rushing towards his fist into an icy force.</p><p>This was the essence of Frost. This was Frost Force!</p><p>Pia! As Lou Cheng struck out with Forward Punch, a white steam appeared around his fist which looked like the steam people breathed out in the cold of winter.</p><p>This was because he had not practiced Frost Force enough, causing its momentum to leak out. If he was skillful, then he could launch a punch without any Frost Force leaking and all the force would be contained within his fist!</p><p>While Mo Zicong was confronting this punch and thinking of the previous experience, he really didn’t want to defend again and struggle with that cold hell. But he had to fight back because his frozen legs had only recovered a little. If he rushed to escape from this punch, he would give Lou Cheng an opportunity to strike him more ferociously.</p><p>He suddenly took a deep breath and sent out the deep sound of “Elephant Trumpet” from his abdomen. But this time, the sound was a trembling sounding like a tropical animal that cried after arriving at the north pole.</p><p>Mo Zicong sank his back and bulged the rigid muscles in his arms. He crossed his two hands in front of his body to defend himself.</p><p><em>Bang!</em></p><p>As this punch landed on Mo Zicong, the cold frost current in it also went into his body. Once again he had the feeling that his whole body had been frozen quickly, and he even felt like he had lost his consciousness.</p><p><em>“Cold! I’m Cold!”</em> &lt;m i=’56’&gt;冷!&lt;/m&gt;冷!</p><p>His teeth involuntarily chattered as he felt the temperature of his body decrease rapidly. His heart began to beat heavily in an attempt to resist the invasion of coldness.</p><p>“This is Frost Force…” Peng Leyun who sat in the office of Shanbei University Martial Arts Club whispered to himself.</p><p>“Is this Frost Force?” Xu Wannian looked at Junior Brother Peng in astonishment</p><p>Snow suddenly appeared on the screen of the computer in front of them and the computer made some noises. It seemed that the computer was affected by the external electromagnetic field.</p><p>…</p><p>While Yan Zheke was being thrown out of the ring, Lin Que narrowed the distance with Deng Hua and suddenly went into a state of “meditation”.</p><p>He took a breath, pressed all his force, spirit, qi, and blood to a certain extent and then released it suddenly.</p><p>While the force was released, Lin Que suddenly jumped forward, like a leopard who finally cornered his prey.</p><p>The safe distance and reaction time that Deng Hua had suddenly disappeared as Lin Que closed in on him before he could dodge.</p><p><em>“There is a sense of the Dan stage…”</em> He was so surprised that he crossed his arms in front of his body without thinking after he took a breath.</p><p>As soon as he set up a defending posture, Lin Que released a punch that was like a meteor. This punch was abnormally quick and even contained some remaining force.</p><p><em>Bang!</em></p><p>The moment Deng Hua was hit by this punch, he felt like a bomb exploded as a great blast wave rolled over his body and made every bone in his body shake, every muscle tremble, and every part of his blood roll over!</p><p>And it also touched the residual effect from the last attack he had forced himself to bear. So, it even affected his inner organs, making him feel uncomfortable and disgusting.</p><p>Therefore, he was a little bit late when he tried to use his martial art to counteract the shaking effect. Then, he saw Lin Que throw a punch at him again!</p><p>…</p><p>Facing with the counterattacks of Zhu Tao, Li Mao bore the tension in his heart and didn’t fight with him directly. While he slipped to the side and cooperated with Lin Hua, one of them aimed for the throat while the other one aimed for his temple.</p><p>Relying on his Iron Canvas Shirt, Zhu Tao suddenly shrank, slightly lowered his body, turned around, and bumped against the fist of Li Mao.</p><p>Bang! Because the height and orientation had changed, his forehead was hit directly and made a sound like a hand clapped of an ancient clock. Meanwhile, Lin Hua’s first hit on his shoulder and was bounced by his bulging neck muscles.</p><p>Bang! Zhu Tao bumped against Li Mao strongly and made him stagger, taking a step backwards. Li Mao barely managed to stay in the ring.</p><p>Then this evil bald man bore the kick of Lin Hua without any defense, relying on his Iron Canvas Shirt and accurate judgment. After which, he caught up with Li Mao using big steps and opened his arms to hit him violently.</p><p>Li Mao couldn’t dodge, and after he defended against these two attacks, he felt that he was about to lose this battle. At this moment, Lin Hua caught up with them and exerted force into his feet, launching a whip kick towards a vital part of Zhu Tao.</p><p>While in this critical moment, Zhu Tao didn’t even defend himself. He slipped, spun, and arrived behind Li Mao. After he bore the back kick without any defense, he forcefully narrowed the distance to Li Mao and punched towards the spine of his opponent.</p><p>However, he only touched his opponent and didn’t exert force in the attack. The referee pulled Li Mao away and led him out of the ring.</p><p>During such a short time, there was only one amateur fighter left among the four amateur fighters. So when Lin Hua saw Zhu Tao was about to attack her, she instinctively chose to dodge around.</p><p>Zhu Tao was satisfied because he knew that his team would win this battle in the end. As long as Mo Zicong and Deng Hua weren’t defeated within several attacks, then this battle would be easy for them to win.</p><p>He glanced at the other two battlefields and found Mo Zicong standing there with his strong and big body, which made people feel at ease and safe. At that moment, Mo Zicong stood there with his hands crossed in front of his body to stop the fist of Lou Cheng.</p><p><em>“Keep defending. I’ll come to aid you right now!”</em> Just when Zhu Tao came up with this thought, his eyes suddenly froze.</p><p>Because he saw that Lou Cheng had already taken back his fist and turned around without looking at Mo Zicong anymore!</p><p><em>Is he silly?</em></p><p>Zhu Tao stood there and waited to see Mo Zicong attack Lou Cheng violently. However, all he could see was that his leader who was always called “Elephant” was obviously trembling with a blatantly glowing white face.</p><p><em>“What happened?”</em> Zhu Tao forgot to chase Lin Hua and was so stunned that he even stopped walking.</p><p>Lou Cheng bent and stared at Zhu Tao. Behind him, Mo Zicong fell to the ground like a pillar falling down to the ground, making a loud sound and splashing a little gravel.</p><p><em>Lu Zhishen killed Zhen Guanxi with three punches, and this is the challenge tournament, so I only used two punches!</em></p><p><em>“Did he defeat “Elephant” so easily?”</em> Zhu Tao was shocked. Then he heard the sound that another fighter had fallen to the ground. He turned around and saw Deng Hua lying on the floor, retching. He also noticed that Lin Que turned around and stared at him just like Lou Cheng, with indifferent eyes!</p><p>On the left side stood Lou Cheng. On the right side stood Lin Que. He suddenly felt utterly desperate!</p><p><em>What f*cking happened just now?</em></p><p>Lin Hua also noticed the situation had changed. She was standing near Zhu Tao and looking at him with a little embarrassment.</p><p><em>If Lin Que and Lou Cheng start to attack him together, they’ll definitely trade ferocious blows. It would be too dangerous for me to take part in their fight rashly. I would become a burden to them. Since it’s like this, I have nothing to do even if I’m still in the ring.</em></p><p><em>What should I do now?</em></p><p>She seriously began to consider this “difficult” problem.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
