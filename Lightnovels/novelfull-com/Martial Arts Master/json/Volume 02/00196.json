What do the last two lines mean?</p><p>He suddenly came to the realization and ecstasy exploded in his heart. The joy was too huge that he fell at a loss.</p><p>“OK. Of course.”</p><p>Yan Zheke has agreed to sleep with me tonight?</p><p>Although they would just sleep together, it was still a big leap in their relationship. It was something Lou Cheng had been longing for so badly.</p><p>Lou Cheng didn’t ask why the girl suddenly changed her mind—he was smarter than that. He could foresee how annoyed Yan Zheke would be if he dared ask. She might kick him out of the room directly.</p><p>“Something that can be done but can’t be said…” said Lou Cheng silently to himself. He turned around, running towards his room gladly.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As the door shut behind him, Yan Zheke raised her hand to feel her red face as if the words had drained all her strength. She murmured to herself,</p><p>“why did I give in to him…”</p><p>“Hmm… He cannot do anything anyway.”</p><p>…</p><p>Running all the way to his room, Lou Cheng took out changing clothes and a martial arts suit for tomorrow’s morning training from his backpack.</p><p>His hands stopped as an idea suddenly came to his mind. He thought about it for a few dozens of seconds before putting everything back in his backpack, including his dirty laundry in a separate bag.</p><p>As long as I behave myself tonight, she’ll let me stay tomorrow night for sure. In this case, why not bring everything over? No point making another trip.</p><p>Besides, we can save a few hundred bucks by checking this room out tomorrow.</p><p>Lou Cheng seemed very confident in his good behavior tonight. She was having her period, her belly painful and body weak and cold. How could he take advantage of her like this? Any human being wouldn’t do such a thing.</p><p>He inspected the room thoroughly, making sure no item was left behind. Carrying the backpack on his shoulder, he took out the key and ran towards his light, Yan Zheke’s room.</p><p>Knock-knock… He tried hard to control his excitement, preventing the knock sounding hurried.</p><p>After the third knock, Yan Zheke opened the door, making way for him to enter.</p><p>She’d tied her hair up with a hairpin, looking a few years younger than her actual age, like a middle school girl.</p><p>As her eyes ranged over Lou Cheng’s backpack, Yan Zheke’s lips slightly opened. Then her eyes dropped as well as her head, rushing into the washroom.</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed in his sleeve, feeling out her current thought.</p><p>She must be saying “give knaves an inch and they’ll take a yard.” She said yes to tonight and he brought everything over, planning for tomorrow.</p><p>Since Yan Zheke had the washroom door locked from inside, Lou Cheng couldn’t watch her remove her makeup. He put his backpack next to her suitcase and took a seat on her bed, waiting patiently with a bright smile with no interest in playing with his phone or browsing online forums.</p><p>The sound of the shower came from the washroom, as if every drop of water fell on his heart, making Lou Cheng feel parched with thirst.</p><p>He opened a complimentary bottle of water and took a big sip, experiencing this extreme challenge. Knowing he shouldn’t do anything and couldn’t do anything, still he couldn’t restrain his mind from roaming.</p><p>Err… Didn’t they say girls during their period can’t take a shower?</p><p>He felt puzzled about the inconsistency of his knowledge and reality.</p><p>I’d better consult my life mentor Coach Yan later!</p><p>It didn’t take her long to finish the shower. Lou Cheng immediately sat upright, stiff and proper to prove he hadn’t been going off into wild flights of fancy.</p><p>The bathroom door slipped open. Yan Zheke stepped out, her hair tied up, her fine neck exposed, her entire body shrouded by a faint layer of heavenly air, extremely attractive and beautiful. Lou Cheng was stunned, almost forgetting his question.</p><p>“What’re you looking at?” She turned her head away, avoiding his eyes.</p><p>“Looking at a fairy!” Lou Cheng complimented in a joking tone after drawing in the pleasant fragrance and suppressing his impulse.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s eyes still had a blurry feeling from the shower. She threw a glare at him.</p><p>“Go and wash up!”</p><p>Her face flushed as she added, “Wait a few more minutes.”</p><p>I just finished my shower. It feels weird if Cheng goes in now.</p><p>Lou Cheng was stroked by her glare, almost losing control over himself. He didn’t notice her subtle abnormality and tried to distract himself with a question. “Ke, aren’t you having your period? How could you take a shower?”</p><p>“Why not?” answered Yan Zheke, gazing at him strangely. “I usually take a shower after the first one and a half or two days, and then take one every other day. But I won’t wash my hair. Otherwise, I can smell blood from myself.”</p><p>She felt shy and didn’t continue to explain more.</p><p>“I see…” Lou Cheng gained some new knowledge and smiled. “Coach Yan deserves to be my life mentor.”</p><p>Yan Zheke was amused, chuckling.</p><p>“Be a good student then. You’ve got loads to learn.”</p><p>They chatted a few more minutes until Lou Cheng got permission to enter the washroom with his changing clothes. He could smell the remaining warm fragrance.</p><p>He swallowed some saliva, pressed his restlessness down, brushed his teeth and took a quick shower. He suddenly felt unsure towards the end. “Should I go out in my boxer briefs, or put my jeans back on?”</p><p>New to this scenario, Lou Cheng felt shy as well. Eventually, he walked out fully dressed.</p><p>In the dim light, Yan Zheke lay on her side, facing the washroom, her entire body buried inside the duvet except for her small face and beautiful long hair. Her big clear eyes opened wide, watching Lou Cheng approach quietly.</p><p>“You don’t have sleeping clothes?” Yan Zheke suddenly opened her mouth, her eyes twinkled as if she had discovered some big secret.</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed. “Boys are not that exquisite. I never wear sleeping clothes…”</p><p>I wear cotton jerseys when it’s cold and I’m half naked when hot. Who needs sleeping clothes? Changing clothes is so troublesome. It’s not like I have someone to meet in bed…</p><p>“Rough men indeed.” Yan Zheke chuckled. She didn’t seem to care this different habit in life.</p><p>She planned to buy two suits of sleeping clothes for Cheng and started to train him. But in case he didn’t like it, it was no big deal.</p><p>“When two people get together, it’s normal for their ideas and habits to be different. Catch the main ones to work on and ignore the minor ones or they’ll both feel restrained…” This was Yan Zheke’s opinion, based on books she had read. She wasn’t sure it was right or not.</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed to admit he was one of the rough men. He was about to take off his jeans when he noticed Yan Zheke’s beautiful eyes were still on him, full of curiosity.</p><p>“Damn it… I’ve never stripped in front a girl before. Especially I have nothing inside but a pair of boxer briefs…” Shameless as Lou Cheng still felt uneasy. He coughed as a signal for his girlfriend to turn around.</p><p>Yan Zheke blinked and kept on to stare like a curious baby with no clue what that cough was about.</p><p>“whatever… I’m not the one losing here.” Lou Cheng took a deep breath before opening his belt and revealing his boxer briefs under his jeans.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s fine face flushed, with a faint grin hidden at the corner of her mouth. She pointed out in her soft voice.</p><p>“Cheng, your legs are so hairy.”</p><p>She had noticed it before when she put ointment on Lou Cheng’s body but today it was direct and impressive.</p><p>“I’m just average.” Lou Cheng kept the dark t-shirt on as his sleeping top in case the girl felt too shy. “Some guys are much hairier than me. Their legs are pretty much wearing a pair of hairy pants.”</p><p>He was thinking about Qiu Zhigao but didn’t feel necessary to name him.</p><p>“Hairy, hairy pants…” Yan Zheke chuckled after a moment of confusion. “A very good description. Very good.”</p><p>Lou Cheng decided to brazen it out and dived into bed in his boxer briefs, moving closer to the girl.</p><p>“Move your hairy legs away!” Yan Zheke complained, requesting her boyfriend to lie down on his back. She put her little feet on his legs and hands on his belly under his t-shirt.</p><p>The cold, silky feeling turned Lou Cheng on. The girl took the initiative, making him swallow some saliva, struggling.</p><p>“Ke, what’re you doing?”</p><p>“Didn’t you say you want to warm my hands and feet?” Yan Zheke opened her eyes wide, giving Lou Cheng her innocent looks.</p><p>Today you promised to warm my hands and feet when you found out girls would feel cold at their limbs during their period.</p><p>Lou Cheng tilted his head, looking at her clear eyes, and took a deep breath.</p><p>“I was shocked by the chill…”</p><p>“Ha-hah. Pretty cold, isn’t it?” Yan Zheke’s right hand slid across Lou Cheng’s belly. “Your six-pack is very obvious.”</p><p>For some reason, a well-known line said by the role of an overbearing CEO came to Lou Cheng’s mind, “Woman, you are playing with fire.”</p><p>“Ke, you’re giving me an erection…” He heaved out a sigh and carefully warned in case Yan Zheke accidentally touched his male parts and misunderstood him.</p><p>Scared by his words, Yan Zheke quickly withdrew her hands and looked at Lou Cheng timidly. “You react to these moves?”</p><p>“Yeah. I’m very hot-blooded…” Lou Cheng made up an excuse. “Bring it. I can handle.”</p><p>“Ohh…” Yan Zheke placed her feet and hands on his body with great care and didn’t move around at all.</p><p>Lou Cheng was enjoying her pleasant smell and relieving his reaction when she asked all of a sudden, “Cheng, did you help catch a thief this morning?”</p><p>“Yes. How do you know?” Lou Cheng turned his head, confused.</p><p>Yan Zheke smiled and said, “It’s in the news already!”</p><p>She took her right hand back and reached out to her mobile under her pillow, which she handed to Lou Cheng after unlocking the screen. “I browsed a web portal during your shower and found this in the local news section. I clicked on this amusing one and found Cheng.”</p><p>Lou Cheng took the phone and saw a phone of himself taken from behind under the title</p><p>“Deliveryman stepped out for justice. White-collared girl caught a thief”</p><p>“Deliveryman?” Lou Cheng blurted out.</p><p>When did I become a deliveryman? Where do I look like a deliveryman? Have you seen a deliveryman of Professional Ninth Pin?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
