Faint dimples appeared on her cheeks as she said, “Ke’s constitution was weak since young. Maybe it’s because she was pampered and spoiled since young, but she is unlike me in that I’ve fooled around with my senior brothers and sisters since young and learned how to lie a long time ago. While she hadn’t used any unnecessary descriptors when she brought up the fact that you and her cousin had taken down an Eighth Pin Dan stage fighter in a preliminary of attrition, she couldn’t hide her pleased, proud and joyful feelings from her tone. She was happier than the time she got the highest score in the exam. At the time I could already hear my stomach dropping to the ground: Oh no, my daughter did have a boyfriend.”</p><p>“So this was how our relationship was exposed from the beginning…” Lou Cheng came to realization but wasn’t dismayed by the revelation. In fact, he had the urge to laugh out sweetly. After learning about Yan Zheke’s tone and attitude when she talked about him from an outsider’s point of view, his love for her had only grown stronger and stronger. He was filled with a sense of satisfaction and happiness.</p><p>With the girl I love by my side, I will not be afraid no matter how scary mother-in-law and father-in-law are!</p><p>It was unfortunate that he hadn’t seen Ke’s appearance with his own eyes and Ke’s tone with his own ears at the time…</p><p>“If I couldn’t find out your background even with this crucial information in hand, then the experience I’ve gained after half a lifetime would’ve been for nothing, don’t you agree?” Ji Mingyu said with calm eyes, “The main reason I came to look for you today is to inform you two of my wishes as Ke’s mother. It’s not a request.”</p><p>“Do tell, auntie.” Lou Cheng regained his usual cool after seeing that empress really wasn’t looking to separate him and Yan Zheke forcefully. However, he was not as calm as he used to be, and there were a lot of reverence mixed with his attitude as well.</p><p>The mere fact that the “Queen Mother” had given birth, raised and cared for Ke was deserving of his respect already!</p><p>Ji Mingyu turned her head sideways and smiled at Lou Cheng. “First, you must not overdo it before you’re sure that you can bear Ke’s life on your shoulders. Can you do this?”</p><p>“Not overdo it…” Lou Cheng almost failed to understand the meaning behind these three words until he circulated them several times in his head. “Mother-in-law, your words are almost too implied to fathom!”</p><p>“I’m not an irresponsible person. I’ll work hard to improve myself for Ke’s sake, and I’ll not hurt her.” Lou Cheng’s answer was also more tactful since he was facing his mother-in-law.</p><p>Ji Mingyu nodded, “As for my second wish. No matter how compatible and in love two people were before, I know that they have to make a certain amount of sacrifices to fully acclimate with each other before they can truly live together as a family. However, I hope that you won’t make Ke sacrifice her own dreams and future for your sake. Believe me, true love will withstand the test of time and distance.”</p><p>“The test of time and distance? Ke’s dreams and future?” Lou Cheng was a little confused, and he wasn’t sure exactly what she was pointing at. But still he said sincerely, “Auntie, if that really is Ke’s dream, then I’ll only raise both hands in agreement.”</p><p>“Alright, remember what you said today.” Ji Mingyu slowly stood up and threw out a comment, “It shouldn’t be a big deal for Ke to win this match. Alright, I’ll be leaving. Please don’t tell Ke about my visit.”</p><p>“Mm.” Lou Cheng was suppressed by the Queen Mother’s aura and thus couldn’t find the opportunity to say more things. He could only watch her leaving behind a mature and elegant back and meet up with another woman. They walked along the aisle of the spectator’s grandstand and exited the NO.2 hall.</p><p>“What dreams would Ke have? I don’t think I’ve ever asked her about this, have I?” Lou Cheng withdrew her gaze and saw Yan Zheke suppressing Chen Jun and unleashing the 24 Blizzard Strikes. He felt both a little dazed and afraid for some indescribable reason on the inside.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside Songcheng Martial Arts Arena, Ji Mingyu paused at the entrance and cast a backward glance indoors. She let out a soft sigh.</p><p>“Junior master, that wasn’t your initial plan…” Liu Xiaolin’s senses were far better than a common person’s. They weren’t close to each other, but she had heard the gist of things nonetheless.</p><p>Ji Mingyu smiled self-depreciatingly and said, “When I saw Ke walking wherever that boy leads her to, and when I think the shocked, fearful, worried but absolutely stubborn look on her face, I cannot help but recall the past and falter before I knew it.”</p><p>Back then, Xiushan’s train station was a wreck that hadn’t yet been fixed for many years. Back then, there was a girl who carried her only one bag of luggage as she arrived from Jiangnan. When she saw her the man of her destiny at the railway station, she neither cried nor complained about her grievances. She simply smiled beautifully and declared, “I only have you now…”</p><p>As the memories kept flashing before her mind, Ji Mingyu’s expression turned gentle as she felt a sudden, strong urge to return home right away. Therefore, she started towards the parking lot and instructed her companion. “Little Lin, you shouldn’t tell this to anyone including your husband. If Ke’s father, grandpa, and grandma hear about this, they will turn the world upside down, understand?”</p><p>“Don’t worry, junior master. I know what to do.” Liu Xiaolin answered with a smile beside Ji Mingyu.</p><p>That was true. Back then both grandpa and grandma was pissed and hurt quite badly by their youngest and most beloved daughter. After the incident, they had cast those loves all onto their exceptionally precious granddaughter. If they learned that their beloved girl had been kidnapped by a ‘wild’ man right after she started university, she literally couldn’t imagine what might happen next!</p><p>… …</p><p>After obtaining the versus list, Chen Jun had also investigated into Yan Zheke. He learned that the girl was good in listening skill, could forcefully regain her center of gravity and had attained a small level of mastery in meditation after he wandered among his circle of friends in Songcheng’s martial arts circles. She had also mastered the 24 Blizzard Strikes. Therefore, he was prepared for this and had prepped all the necessary countermeasures since a long time ago.</p><p>Unfortunately for him, his own strength was average, and the improvised fighting style he had to adapt into to avoid his opponent borrowing strength through her listening skill made him incredibly uncomfortable. He kept showing weaknesses throughout the battle, and had to pay extra attention to Yan Zheke’s ability to regain her center of gravity. It wasn’t long before he fell into the unavoidable suppression of the 24 Blizzard Strikes. In just half a round’s time, he faltered before her attacks and had to avoid being hurt and hit off the ring with the referee’s assistance.</p><p>After she was done with the round, Yan Zheke immediately felt lots of assurance on the inside. She now had greater insight towards her own strength:</p><p>She did possess the ability to aim for the qualification of Amateur Second Pin now!</p><p>Joy surged inside the girl’s heart as she turned to look towards the spectator’s grandstand, searching for Lou Cheng’s figure. When she found that familiar figure and looked into his eyes, she suddenly felt a lot calmer for no particular reason and broke into a wide smile. She tightened her fist and waved at him.</p><p>Lou Cheng was both overjoyed and dazed at the same time as he stared at Yan Zheke’s overpoweringly dazzling smile. Her aura and the Queen Mother’s quite literally felt like heaven and hell.</p><p>Does this mean that the Queen Mother has acknowledged my relationship with Ke?</p><p>It’s only a wish, but not a request?</p><p>In that instant, he came back to himself and felt so excited that his entire body was trembling. Wild joy surged from the depths of his heart.</p><p>He wasn’t sure what happened to make his mother-in-law give her sudden, tacit approval, but at the very least he had succeeded in the first step and gained a good beginning!</p><p>I’m now Ke’s official boyfriend!</p><p>He swung his fists and looked unusually excited to the point where Yan Zheke cocked her head slightly in doubt.</p><p>Why did Cheng look even happier and more excited than I am? This is just the first match of the ranking event…</p><p>Oh well, as long as he’s happy!</p><p>Plus, he looked like he could not help but feel happy from the bottom of his heart, hehe…</p><p>The girl left the ring, confirmed her identity at the tournament supervision area and took back her cell phone. She walked along the aisle with light footsteps towards Lou Cheng. Meanwhile, Lou Cheng had long since been welcoming her with open arms, longing to give her a big hug!</p><p>Seeing her boyfriend’s open arms, Yan Zheke cast embarrassed glances to her surroundings and confirmed that no one was paying attention before she bit her lips, turned her head sideways, took two quick steps forwards and allowed him to hold her.</p><p>“Why do you look so happy?” the girl restrained her laughter and asked in a soft voice.</p><p>Lou Cheng had so many things to say, and just as many things to ask. But when he considered the fact that his girlfriend still had matches during the afternoon and night, he forcefully held himself back. “I’m just happy that you’ve started things off with a bang, aren’t I?”</p><p>Pu! Yan Zheke broke into a laugh and struggled out of his arms. She brushed her loose hair and cast diffident glances to her surroundings before she examined her boyfriend suspiciously. “Why do I keep having the feeling that your laugh is unnatural?”</p><p>“Sweatdrop, is this what they call a woman’s intuition?” Lou Cheng let out a laugh and said, “And how is it in any way unnatural? Let’s head over to that seat and wait a bit for senior brother Sun Jian and Li Mao, shall we?”</p><p>“Alright.” Yan Zheke was feeling happy, and thus she didn’t look deeper into her boyfriend’s earlier expression. She sat down with him, opened the energy drink he passed over to her and took small sips to replenish her water.</p><p>With her stamina, she couldn’t help but sweat all over despite executing only half a cycle of 24 Blizzard Strikes.</p><p>Since the time arrangement was just right, the duo didn’t wait for too long before Sun Jian and Li Mao ended their respective matches and won their first round.</p><p>Later on, Sun Jian went to wait for Lin Hua while Lou Cheng and the others met up with Guo Qing, who had finished her match since a long time ago. They walked to an express hotel franchise fifteen minutes away.</p><p>Since Songcheng University’s new school campus area was too far away from Songcheng Martial Arts Arena, it was troublesome to go back and forth between them. As usual, they had booked a room in advance for resting purposes after every match to recover themselves from fatigue to the greatest degree. Of course, once the third round at night was over, they would still rush for the last school bus back to the dormitory if there was enough time.</p><p>Lou Cheng ran back and forth and busied himself for a bit before he finally arranged Sun Jian and Li Mao, Jiang Fusheng and Wu Meng, Lin Hua and Li Xiaowen, Yan Zheke and Guo Qing, and himself into their respective rooms.</p><p>However, he made an excuse to invite Yan Zheke to discuss her afternoon match after they had obtained their room cards. He wanted to ‘kidnap’ the girl into his own room.</p><p>“You’re not thinking of doing anything bad, are you?” Yan Zheke suddenly felt a little nervous standing in front of the door as she bit her bottom lip.</p><p>I think this is the first time I rent a hotel room with a boy…</p><p>Lou Cheng broke into a laugh and said, “Am I that horny in your eyes?”</p><p>“Yes!” Yan Zheke answered crisply and without any hesitation at all.</p><p>After she said this, faint dimples appeared on her face as a sweet smile blossomed on her face.</p><p>Lou Cheng actually couldn’t say anything in objection for a time, and he had no choice but to tell the truth, “How would I dare do anything naughty when you have a match later this afternoon? I just thought that I could apply a new skill I’ve learned today, you know?”</p><p>“What new skill?” Yan Zheke’s eyes turned with full curiosity.</p><p>Lou Cheng swiped his card and opened the room’s door. He said with a smile, “It is a massaging skill that can swiftly alleviate your fatigue!”</p><p>“Really?” Yan Zheke wore a look of plain disbelief.</p><p>“You’ll know after you try it. Coincidentally, I can use it with this ointment to eliminate the bruises on your body so that you won’t be left with any hidden wounds later.” Lou Cheng put the room card into the wall slot while saying very seriously.</p><p>Seeing her boyfriend’s serious expression, Yan Zheke nodded slightly and smiled.</p><p>“Then your coach shall tentatively believe you this one time~!”</p><p>While speaking, she walked inside and examined her surroundings curiously. She didn’t look like she had visited an express hotel like this before.</p><p>Clang! Lou Cheng closed the door and isolated all noises from outside.</p><p>“Sit beside the bed, and I’ll help you massage.” he suggested while beaming.</p><p>Yan Zheke rolled her eyes at him. “I’m completely sweaty. Even if you don’t mind the stench I do mind being filthy. I’ll test your new skill after I take a bath~”</p><p>Plus, ointments had to be applied after a bath anyway!</p><p>Once she was done, she accepted the basket from Lou Cheng’s hands just like she used to inside the locker room after a match. However, just as she was about to bent down and take off her shoes, she suddenly froze as if she’d recalled something. A blush rose above her pretty face, and she hastily grabbed her shoes and other articles and rushed into the toilet. She slammed the door shut tightly and locked it with a clak.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Lou Cheng was a little confused as he sat casually beside the bed.</p><p>A few minutes later, he heard the sound of the shower coming from inside the toilet. It was a thin, dense sound that resonated beside his ears.</p><p>At first, Lou Cheng didn’t feel anything towards it. But as he continued to listen, he suddenly realized that his surroundings were unusually quiet. It was completely different from when he was inside the locker room.</p><p>Here in this room, Ke and I are the only ones around?</p><p>This sudden realization flashed across his mind and instantly nurtured a certain kind of emotion inside his heart. He couldn’t help but feel that the sounds of falling water were beating at his heart and drawing forth an ambiguous feeling.</p><p>“We’re alone in a room…” He inhaled deeply and told himself that Yan Zheke still had a match this afternoon; an incredibly important ranking event no less. He absolutely couldn’t disturb her state of mind right now.</p><p>He froze water into ice, but the ice then melted right away. The cycle kept repeating as Lou Cheng felt as if he was sitting on needles. At times he was restless, and at times he was calm. It was only when the sounds of the shower had screeched to a halt that he finally exhaled on the inside. He felt as if he had just fought a challenge tournament.</p><p>A while later, Yan Zheke opened the door and walked out. She was wearing the black-bordered white martial arts suit belonging to Songcheng University as usual. Her hair was tied loosely with a rubber band, and her neck looked white, clean and delicate.</p><p>Her countenance grew prettier and prettier in Lou Cheng’s eyes. Her exposed skin looked moist and reddened from the bath. It looked as soft as a bubble.</p><p>Lou Cheng stared dumbly at Yan Zheke as if a bolt of lightning had stricken him. His mouth and throat slowly turned dry.</p><p>“What’re you looking at!” Yan Zheke immediately blushed red the second she noticed Lou Cheng’s gaze. She let out a loud, embarrassed humph and followed up quickly in a slightly afraid tone, “I, I think I’d better head over to Qing’s…”</p><p>She kept feeling that Cheng was going to let out a howl and turn into a pervert!</p><p>Why had I stupidly decided to come in with him?</p><p>Lou Cheng inhaled deeply and caught a whiff of shower fragrance from the girl’s body. He hastily froze water into ice and said sincerely and seriously, “Trust me, I really just want to give you a relaxing massage. There’s no way I’ll interrupt the ranking event you’ve been looking forward to for so long, right?”</p><p>Yan Zheke bit her bottom lip after seeing the sincere look on his face.</p><p>“Alright, I trust you.”</p><p>When she said this, she looked up with eyes that were still a little misty and said somewhat timidly to Lou Cheng,</p><p>“Don’t let down my trust…”</p><p>“Of course I won’t. Just look at this righteous look on my face!” Lou Cheng purposely cracked a joke to soothe the girl’s anxious feelings.</p><p>“A dumb look, more like!” Yan Zheke pursed her lips and let out a laughing abuse.</p><p>She set down the articles she was holding such as her martial arts shoes and sat beside Lou Cheng. With a bit of embarrassment and worry, she stared at her own feet and said,</p><p>“Let’s begin…”</p><p>“Okay~” Lou Cheng first took out the ointment and set it at the side so he could use it later. Then, he had the girl turn her body sideways while he knelt on one knee at the edge of the bed. He extended both hands and began pressing her shoulders.</p><p>“A few times later, Yan Zheke said with a hint of happiness and astonishment,</p><p>“Cheng, when did you learn this? You’re not half bad!”</p><p>Lou Cheng let out a mischievous laugh and said, “Didn’t you say that you’ll let me treat you and help you relax once I’ve mastered massaging? I’ve kept it in mind and looked through many videos and searched for much information. With my insight and understanding of the body’s minute details, how can their little technique possibly fool my eyes? I picked it up instantly!”</p><p>“You still remember that?” Yan Zheke pursed her lips and looked towards the front. Her two cheeks were covered in deep dimples that overflowed with sweet happiness. “But where did you find the time to read this when you’re normally so busy? You even found so much information on ocean life…”</p><p>“There’s time if you cramp things here and there.” Lou Cheng moved his hands downwards and pressed the muscles behind the girl’s back. He chuckled and answered, “Some general courses didn’t require any attention, but couldn’t be skipped either. It’s the perfect time to use to read on such things.”</p><p>The only downside is that it seems a little wasteful…</p><p>There were plenty of similar courses in the university. Lou Cheng had always suspected these courses weren’t specifically prepared to give students an easy time. On the contrary, optional courses that were chosen on the basis of interest could increase one’s desire to listen carefully. No wonder a senior brother once said that his state of mind was to choose to skip an optional course, and absolutely skip a compulsory course…</p><p>Yan Zheke narrowed her eyes into thin crescents and said, “I use those courses to review my specialized course and read in-depth documents.</p><p>“You’re a good student!” Lou Cheng praised her once and asked like a child waiting to be praised, “Are you comfortable? Do you want me to continue stronger, or lighter?”</p><p>“It’s alright~” Yan Zheke gave him a reserved answer. “Just a bit stronger, thank you.”</p><p>Sensing her satisfaction, the smile on Lou Cheng’s face grew brighter as he used the ointment and began applying them to the girl’s hands and feet where she exerted strength. This is to ease the remaining tension in her muscles after a burst of energy. After the period of familiarization earlier, his handiwork pleased Yan Zheke more and more. She gradually closed her eyes and focused on enjoying the experience.</p><p>After some time of ‘physiotherapy’ later, Lou Cheng wasn’t bold enough to tell his girlfriend to lie down. Instead, he crouched down himself and began pressing around her ankle. He looked upward and saw that there was a bruise at the exposed skin of her slippers behind her foot. Therefore, he applied the ointment at that position and began rubbing with just the right strength.</p><p>Since the slippers partially blocked the bruised area, he was just about to raise his head and tell Yan Zheke to lift her legs and take off her shoes. However, when he saw that the girl was closing her eyes and enjoying the experience, he thought that there was no need to ask any longer. Of course, she wouldn’t turn him down since she was already allowing her to rub that position.</p><p>Lou Cheng held the tender and delicate ankle in his hands and lifted it lightly into the air. Yan Zheke instinctively struggled for an instant before relaxing. Her eyebrows were trembling lightly, and her cheeks were covered in rosy red before anyone noticed.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s breathing suddenly lagged after he had taken off her shoes. The sole of her feet was compact, and her toes looked delicate. Her skin was like fine jade, and the back of her feet was meaty. It didn’t quite tally with her beautiful appearance, but it was still very cute.</p><p>Before he knew it, Lou Cheng felt that his breathing had turned heavier. His massaging movements also felt more like a caress now.</p><p>He thought that it couldn’t go on like this, and he hastily looked up towards somewhere else. However, the first thing that entered his eyes was Yan Zheke’s round and full chests.</p><p>Hot blood seemed to run through his veins as Lou Cheng’s mouth and throat turned dry. Restlessness overcame him, and he instinctively pushed a pressure point on the girl’s leg harder than usual. It caused her to let out a low humph.</p><p>When the sound of exhalation entered his ears, Lou Cheng’s heart abruptly beat faster. Just as he was about to do something, Yan Zheke opened her eyes and asked innocently and in puzzlement,</p><p>“What’s wrong, Cheng?”</p><p>Why did he press so strongly all of a sudden?</p><p>Lou Cheng inhaled deeply and recalled that today was the day of the ranking event. He hurriedly spoke,</p><p>“Let me wash my face with cold water for a minute!”</p><p>Yan Zheke was confused for a second. Then, she saw Lou Cheng running into the toilet with a bent back. She abruptly came to a realization and blushed as red as a tomato.</p><p>“That big pervert!” She lay down sideways, grabbed a pillow and buried her head into it. She sounded as if she was both embarrassed and pleased, and when she recalled Lou Cheng’s look she couldn’t help but let out a low chuckle again. It sounded both a little sweet and touched.</p><p>“I wonder how a cold face wash feels… is he going to take a cold bath if it’s not enough?…” The girl thought embarrassedly and naughtily.</p><p>Right now Lou Cheng was splashing cold water on his face, using the icy feeling of the water to dissipate the heat inside him. He felt as if he had waged another epic battle right there.</p><p>What an amazing and painful experience this is!</p><p>When he calmed down and returned to the room, Yan Zheke was looking tired already. She wrapped herself tightly inside the blanket and said, “Cheng, I’m going to take a short nap. Wake me for lunch later at eleven thirty, okay?”</p><p>“Got it. We’ll eat lunch and discuss this afternoon’s match later.” Lou Cheng walked beside the girl and said.</p><p>Yan Zheke turned around once and acted coquettishly. “Give me a rub around my temple until I fall asleep.”</p><p>“Okay!” Lou Cheng happily accepted this task and rubbed the girl’s temple softly.</p><p>A while later, he heard that Yan Zheke’s breathing had become soft, long and steady. His heart immediately turned gentle as he looked at her quiet and innocent sleep appearance. He forgot about his nonsensical thoughts from earlier and just stared at the girl he loved like that for a very, very long time.</p><p>He took the opportunity to gather all the necessary materials. He hadn’t woken Yan Zheke up from her sleep and instead went downstairs to buy some food. He woke her with the fragrance of food, and she slowly opened her eyes.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s black hair covered both sides of her head, and her face was white and exquisite. Her black, spirited eyes looked a little confused after waking, and the sight had Lou Cheng spellbound. He felt as if he would never forget this sight in his life.</p><p>…</p><p>Because Yan Zheke was sufficiently prepared and strong in the first place, she managed to obtain victory for both the afternoon and night matches. Lou Cheng had also experienced another ordeal of ice and fire as he gave Yan Zheke a massage during the afternoon.</p><p>At 8 p.m. night time, the Martial Arts Club group returned to the old school campus area. Guo Qing, Li Mao and the others were rather excited since they had won all of their matches. On the other hand, Sun Jian was unlucky to meet a strong opponent in his subgroup and lost the previous match. His chance of advancing was low because of this, and he was a little discontented as a result.</p><p>“You’re just unlucky. You can still try again this June.” Everyone consoled him this way.</p><p>After walking for a moment, Yan Zheke slowed her footsteps and said pitifully beside Lou Cheng’s ears, “I used too much strength tonight, and my muscles are aching a little.”</p><p>Lou Cheng looked at his surroundings before he suggested with a beaming smile, “Let me carry you then?”</p><p>“It’s so embarrassing!” Yan Zheke turned down the offer immediately.</p><p>“What’re you afraid of? We’ll just walk slower and circle around from another path! You can bury your face in my shoulder later, and no one will be able to recognize you then. Then you won’t feel embarrassed.” Lou Cheng said in half jest.</p><p>Yan Zheke broke into a laugh. “You make me sound like an ostrich!”</p><p>She finally agreed after falling under Lou Cheng’s great efforts at seductions. The duo walked slower and slower and completely broke off from the group.</p><p>“Come on up, will you?” Cheng crouched and said smilingly.</p><p>Yan Zheke propped both hands on his shoulders and allowed him to grab both her legs and lift her up.</p><p>“You’re so light…” Lou Cheng let out a low chuckle.</p><p>By now the sky was dark, and the night wind was a little cold. The thin fragrance of flower was in the air, and the atmosphere was both quiet and peaceful.</p><p>Yan Zheke didn’t say anything. Her face was red, and faint dimples appeared on her face.</p><p>Lou Cheng glanced around and saw no one around them. He inhaled and said,</p><p>“Ke, your mum came to look for me while you were competing today.”</p><p>“Ah?” Yan Zheke’s face was a look of bewilderment. She thought she had heard wrongly.</p><p>Lou Cheng didn’t turn around. He smiled and said,</p><p>“She was sure that we’re seeing each other, but she didn’t seem too much against the idea.”</p><p>Although his mother-in-law had told him not to tell Ke, he had an obvious idea who would become his family in the future, and who was the most important one!</p><p>“My mom? She came back?” It was only now Yan Zheke finally reacted to his words. She was both puzzled and shocked as she asked him.</p><p>Lou Cheng reiterated their dialogue in detail before asking the question in his heart that he wanted to know the most,</p><p>“Ke, what’s your dream?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
