She was busily tapping away on the keyboard.</p><p>“Haven’t Ru and Pak Choi come back yet?” She asked casually.</p><p>Li Liantong stopped typing and turned to Yan Zheke. “I heard that they got stuck at the old campus.”</p><p>Many schoolmates were returning back to school at this time after the holidays, so there were not enough school buses!</p><p>“Right.” Yan Zheke chuckled. “Ru might as well skip classes for one more day.”</p><p>May Day Holidays this year were from Wednesday to Friday. Skipping all the classes on Monday and Tuesday, including the previous weekend meant that Zong Yanru had given herself a super long seven-day holiday.</p><p>Resting her chin on one hand, Li Liantong watched Yan Zheke open her suitcase and busily unpack the luggage. “Did you and Cheng not take the school bus?” She mused.</p><p>After Li Liantong had gotten to know Lou Cheng better, she had begun to use his nickname as well.</p><p>“Yep. He used an online taxi hailing service.” Yan Zheke replied with a hint of a smile.</p><p><em>If we had taken the school bus, it would have been at least one or two hours before returning.</em></p><p><em>But calling a cab online was expensive since the ticket for the school bus only cost four yuan. We had spent 60 or 70 yuan on the cab. What a waste of money!</em></p><p><em>And this trip had already cost Cheng a fortune. The room rate alone was more than 3,000 yuan at least. Plus other miscellaneous expenses, I’m afraid Cheng had to spend nearly 5000 yuan on this…</em></p><p><em>I wonder how much money he will have left…</em></p><p>She had come from a well-off family and money was never a problem for her, so she had never thought about saving money. However after she had been with Lou Cheng, she had unconsciously developed a habit of being more frugal. Guess love changes people.</p><p>Otherwise, she would never have reminded her boyfriend to cancel that extra room reservation. It was too embarrassing and humiliating.</p><p>Seeing Yan Zheke lost in her thoughts, Li liantong could not help teasing her.</p><p>“Ke, you look great~”</p><p>Coming out of her reverie, Yan Zheke rolled her eyes at her roommate. “Dirty Tong, there’s nothing wrong with what you just said, but you speaking it makes me feel weird.”</p><p>Li Liantong was gifted in making everything she said sound dirty.</p><p>Li Liantong chuckled. “You’re right about me, but I do have my manners. I will not invade someone’s privacy on purpose and would never ask a thing about how much intimacy you have shared with Cheng. You look great. That’s how I feel when I see you.”</p><p>“Bah! What were you thinking? I just had my period.” Yan Zheke suddenly came to the realization and stared at Dirty Tong, shy and angry.</p><p>Li Liantong stretched her hands out, smiling.</p><p>“Naive!”</p><p>“Nothing works when it comes to lust, not even your period. Trust me, men could do anything just to get your pants off. Like, like, like…”</p><p>Even if Li Liantong failed to give an example, Yan Zheke was stunned by her words. She and Cheng were too pure and innocent to think of something nasty like that.</p><p>She had read so many romance novels in which the love described was innocent and pure!</p><p>Astonished for a moment, she rubbed her forehead and said, “Dirty Tong, your mind was much dirtier than I could have imagined.”</p><p><em>Who would believe that Li Liantong was a girl who had never been in a relationship before?</em></p><p>Li Liantong gladly accepted this remark as if it was a compliment for her, but her look became more serious when she started to talk again. “Ke, seriously, I have to remind you of something.”</p><p>“What?” Yan Zheke asked blankly.</p><p>“If you can’t turn him on when you guys were together, then you must be careful.” Li Liantong answered solemnly.</p><p>Yan Zheke blushed immediately upon hearing this. “What have you been watching recently? Sounds so weird!” She pouted.</p><p>“It’s just that I saw posts where some scumbags hid their sexual orientation so as to commit marital fraud.” Li Liantong sighed. “Looking at your blushing face, I guess you don’t have to worry about that,” said she with a smile.</p><p>“Mm.” Yan Zheke responded with a voice as soft as a mosquito’s.</p><p><em>Indeed, I don’t have to worry about the problem like that. Cheng’s sexual desire was so strong that we almost got into a fight over this.</em></p><p>But she was too shy to continue with this topic, so she unpacked her suitcase, took out her clothes for laundry and started to pick her outfit for tonight’s dinner.</p><p>“Date night again? Come on, you guys just came back. Don’t you think you’ve spent too much time together?” Li Liantong knew everything about being dirty but knew nothing about keeping a relationship.</p><p>Yan Zheke smiled when picking out her outfit. “His roommate, the closest one, invited us for dinner.”</p><p>“There are other girls?” Li Liantong walked next to Yan Zheke as she gave her some advice on what to wear.</p><p>“Yep.” Yan Zheke let out a laugh.</p><p>“No wonder…” With a smile, Li Liantong looked her roommate up and down and suddenly gave out a sign. “Ke, your beautiful collarbone makes me envy you so much. I would love such delicate collarbones.”</p><p>“Your hobby sounds a bit weird…” Dirty Tong had mentioned her obsession with collarbones several times and Yan Zheke felt strange every time she talked about this.</p><p>Li Liantong laughed. “Strange? I don’t think so. What’s wrong with my obsession? I love beautiful collarbones, many people in this world are obsessed with hands, feet, legs, long hair, short hair, flat chests and so on. Everyone has their own fetishes. They’re all normal people.”</p><p><em>“What’s my obsession?”</em> This problem suddenly occurred to Yan Zheke when she heard Dirty Tong’s explanation.</p><p>After a careful consideration, she found that she had no preferences. If she had to pick one, then she must be obsessed with fools.</p><p><em>“Silly Cheng…”</em> She unconsciously revealed a smile. Then she thought of something else.</p><p><em>What’s Cheng’s obsession?</em></p><p><em>Obsessed with little fairies?</em></p><p>…</p><p>After washing and drying his clothes, Lou Cheng tidied himself up and confirmed the time and place with Little Ming again.</p><p>According to his plan, he set out a little earlier and waited outside dormitory 3. Before long, his girlfriend appeared with a bag in her hand.</p><p>Yan Zheke wore a white T-shirt and a pair of black knee-high culottes, revealing her straight and fair-skinned legs. Her light-colored sneakers, simple yet not dull, made her look young and beautiful. With her makeup, she looked stunningly radiant and gorgeous.</p><p>“Wow, why so formal? I mean your dress tonight.” Lou Cheng asked both in astonishment and disbelief.</p><p>As he recalled, Ke had never tried so hard to look good except for their first date.</p><p>With a big smile on her face, Yan Zheke lowered her head and said, “You know, sometimes girls make an extra effort dressing themselves when their dates are girls. Dating a boyfriend is much easier.”</p><p>“Eh?” Lou Cheng had a dumb look on his face.</p><p>“Never mind, you boys would not understand this.” Yan Zheke held his arm with one hand, smiling. “Let’s go.”</p><p>Instead of using an online car hailing service, they took the school bus to the old campus as usual. There was no need to wait in line at this time of day. Once they arrived at Songcheng, they heade straight to Tao Ran Ju, a restaurant nearby.</p><p>Tao Ran Ju was elegantly decorated. Tables were set between shelves on which all kinds of books and porcelain sculptures were placed. The layout was carefully designed so that every table would have privacy, and the lighting was fairly dim, what a perfect place for dating!</p><p><em>“The Casanova picked the best place to eat!”</em> This compliment came from the bottom of his heart. Then Lou Cheng, hand in hand with Yan Zheke, told the waitress their table number and let her guide them to Cai Zongming and his girlfriend.</p><p>Upon seeing them, Cai Zongming stood up in big smiles and began with the introduction.</p><p>“Cheng, this is my girl, Fang Yuan.”</p><p>“Yuan, this is Cheng, and that’s his girlfriend, Yan Zheke.”</p><p>Lou Cheng and Yan Zheke greeted the girl standing next to Cai Zongming. “Nice to meet you.”</p><p>Fang Yuan who was of medium height looked fairly ordinary, as her eyes were squinted due to her high myopia.</p><p>She wore a T-shirt, an ankle-high dress, and minimal makeup. She looked at Lou Cheng, smiling.</p><p>“Nice to meet you, Cheng. Ming has mentioned you so many times. I know you’re a gifted martial fighter who has infinite strength. But I can tell that what Ming admires the most is your perseverance and determination. With you as a model, he has gotten rid of so many bad habits.”</p><p>Lou Cheng was smiling at the beginning of the conversation, but soon he noticed that Fang Yuan was not the kind of girl he had imagined. She was a lot more serious. The way she talked made him feel pressured as if he was talking with the school dean.</p><p>He took a breath and joked. “I can’t believe what you just said. <em>I thought he would only insult me. How’s it possible for Talker to praise me?</em> Does he admire <em>me? That’s impossible!”</em></p><p>Cai Zongming interjected with a smile. “Yuan, I told you. Cheng won’t buy it. That’s how men get along with one another. You confessing my admiration for him just freaks him out.”</p><p>Their conversation amused the girls, livening the initially awkward atmosphere among them.</p><p>They continued their small talk after settling into their seats. Then Cai Zongming winked at Lou Cheng.</p><p>Upon getting this hint, Lou Cheng looked around right away and asked, “Where is the restroom?”</p><p>“I’ll show you. Ladies please check out the menu first.” Cai Zongming cheerfully stood up and headed to the corner with Lou Cheng.</p><p>When they left, the two girls who did not know each other before this fell into silence immediately. However, the well-educated Yan Zheke started the conversation again. “I heard you’re studying in the department of mathematics at Capital College, right?”</p><p>“Yep.” Fang Yuan looked uncomfortable.</p><p>“Did Professor Smith give a lecture last month at your college?” Yan Zheke asked with great interest.</p><p>Professor Smith was a top scholar whose research field had shifted from mathematics to finance.</p><p>“You know that lecturer?” Fang Yuan’s eyes lit up instantly.</p><p>“Yes. Could you tell me a little bit more about the lecture since I’m interested in that field?” Yan Zheke asked with great curiosity.</p><p>By now, Fang Yuan had taken her as a bosom friend and soon opened up.</p><p>Inside the restroom, Lou Cheng looked at Cai Zongming in amusement. “Isn’t it inappropriate to leave them alone there?”</p><p><em>It’s not nice!</em></p><p>“I know, but I’m also afraid that you’re going to put your foot in your mouth before her. Yuan is an old fashioned girl. She can’t take the jokes that we used to play on each other,” said Cai Zongming while washing his hands.</p><p>“Old fashioned?” Lou Cheng asked in surprise.</p><p>“What’s wrong? I just love her being old fashioned,” said Cai Zongming crossly.</p><p>“I did not know your type…” Lou Cheng continued. “When I talk with her, you have no idea what I’m imagining. Never mind, I’ll keep it to myself…”</p><p><em>I have no problem insulting my friends, but insulting their girlfriend is different. It’s not cool.</em></p><p>Cai Zongming signed. “Does she remind you of our school dean?”</p><p>“Holy crap, how did you know that?” Lou Cheng looked at the Casanova in astonishment.</p><p>“We used to be deskmates for years. That’s how we developed our relationship. At first, I thought she was not my type. How could I fall in love with a girl who is bossy and old fashioned? But later my obsession with her got out of control.” Cai Zongming continued with an ironic smile as he recalled the old days. “Damn it. I hate my parents’ supervision. I hate old fashioned people. However, everything changed when I met her, like Monkey Sun meeting Buddha. I just like her being bossy towards me. I like her serious demeanor…”</p><p>Lou Cheng was shocked for quite a while.</p><p>“Ming, you’re so not you…”</p><p><em>I can’t imagine that he is into this type.</em></p><p><em>Does he suffer from Stockholm Syndrome?</em></p><p><em>One lid matches one pot. They’re exactly like this.</em></p><p>As they spoke, they headed back to their table only to find their dates having a nice chat.</p><p>Cai Zongming paused for a moment and said, “Now I regret asking you to bring your girlfriend…”</p><p>Girls gossiped when they became familiar!</p><p>Lou Cheng drew in his breath as well.</p><p>“I regret it too…”</p><p>…</p><p>Shu Rui, who was dating her boyfriend, suddenly got a call from the director.</p><p>“Can you work overtime tonight to finish that exclusive interview of Lou Cheng? We need to play it for the draw ceremony the day after tomorrow.” The director instructed.</p><p>At this moment, Su Rui felt like smashing her cell onto the ground…</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
