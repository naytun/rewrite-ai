There are a lot of combats waiting for you, so never be intoxicated in your victory. People should always move on. Am I right?” He slightly rained on the cheerful atmosphere. “Our next combat will still away from home, so we’ll go to Yimo where is not far from here. It’s only forty or fifty minutes’ ride, so we can go there and back in the same day to save money for our stingy University.”</p><p>Sun Jian did not get the opportunity to play today, so he was still full of energy. He asked excitedly, “Coach Shi, which martial art club do we fight with?”</p><p>“Our opponent is not a martial art club. Several outstanding young local fighters had broken the barrier of martial art club and organized their own team. The key fighter named Wei Shengtian who is in the Danqi State and of Professional Eighth Pin. His goal is to win a spot to advance in this division and win the Martial Arts Unique skills reward. The remaining two members of this team are of Professional Ninth Pin, even their substitutes are above the Amateur Third Pin. So this team is considered as the favorite of this division.” Geezer Shi took a piece of crumpled paper out of his pocket and read it to us. Although he described them as tough opponents, it didn’t feel like he was all too serious.</p><p>“There is one fighter of Professional Eighth Pin and two fighters of Professional Ninth Pin…” Lou Cheng felt his club had no chance to win this combat when he heard of this. “However, our Martial Arts Club set our goals on National University Martial Arts Games, and we had just participated in the preliminaries for practicing in actual combat, so we wouldn’t care too much about the results.</p><p>Even if we lost the combat with experts, we would learn much more than just beating the inferior team.</p><p>With a relatively strong strength, this team still has a certain distance from Shanbei University Martial Arts Club. It even couldn’t surely win the combat with the Sanjiang College, and the results would depend on whether they can restrain the supernatural ability of their opponents.”</p><p>“Coach, can you explain it specifically?” Young people weren’t afraid of failure and did not set any goals on the preliminaries. So Li Mao asked with interest instead of being frightened.</p><p>Geezer Shi coughed and said, “I’ll email the relevant information to you tomorrow, you can study them carefully. The reason why I don’t email you today is that I want to leave you some time to enjoy the victory today.”</p><p>Heard of this sentence, students like Lou Cheng felt very funny and they all remembered the joy of having beaten the Hongluo Martial Arts School. They looked at each other and cried to show the hot and unabashed youth. They called out loudly,”</p><p>“We win!”</p><p>“Songcheng University is invincible!”</p><p>Their cheering voice spread out of the locker room which made the audience who were leaving the arena feel sad and aggrieved. They hoped the two teams could fight with each other again.</p><p>…</p><p>The school bus came out of the parking lot slowly to the entrance of the Hongluo Martial Arts School. Lou Cheng waved to Yan Zheke and Guo Qing reluctantly and got on the bus until he saw them get in the online car-hailing.</p><p>“Guo Qing is like a third wheel!” Sun Jian who was sitting with Lin Hua said. He was trying to show his sympathy for Lou Cheng, but then he turned back and said with a grin, “Darling, I have thought for a while. How about we have a date later for time is available? Seeing how sweetly Cheng gets along with Yan Zheke, I recall our great past. Let’s go! Let’s have a date!”</p><p>“I won’t date with you!” Lin Hua said and fiercely pinched Sun Jian. But at last, she was still pulled away by him, waiting for the taxi with a shy face.</p><p>The single members like Chen Changhua and Li Mao said nothing but they together showed the middle finger to the silhouette of Sun Jian.</p><p>Lou Cheng felt a little angry but funny. Suddenly he regretted that he did not go there with Yan Zheke. “Why should I care the third wheel!”</p><p>He looked around and found Cai Zongming didn’t get on the bus. Just when he was going to take out the phone to call Little Ming, he received his call.</p><p>“Hey, hurry up! Or you’ll miss the bus.” Lou Cheng quickly reminded him as the phone was connected.</p><p>Cai Zongming laughed and said, “I won’t take the school bus this time. You know that Model Worker had a girlfriend, so he offered to treat our roommates and the roommates of his girlfriend today. And because he came from a normal family and had to save money for dates, we decided to pay the dinner by ourselves. Do you want to come? First of all, we’ll go to the KTV, and then to eat hotpot. How terrible the weather is! Ever since the sun went down, it would be freaking cold outside. So hotpot is the best. Right, do you go with us or not?”</p><p>“How can I answer you when you never stop talking? Talker?” Lou Cheng complained. “No, forget it. I already have a date with Yan Zheke about dinner. We’ll eat in the cafeteria.”</p><p>“Hello, Cheng, you ditch friends for a girl! And goodbye! “Cai Zongming teased and said,” I mean since you have your girlfriend now, are you ready to treat us a big meal now? Look what Model Worker does today! ”</p><p>“Haha. Of course, I’ll treat you when we are free.” Lou Cheng decided to treat them in the cafeteria!</p><p>I should save money for the important things.</p><p>In the Hongluo Martial Arts School, Cai Zongming hung up the phone and said to other people like Zhang Jingye and Wu Qian, “Cheng has a date with his girlfriend, so he can’t participate in our group activities.”</p><p>“A date? Has he already got Yan Zheke?” Qiu Zhigao said astonishingly with his half-opened mouth.</p><p>Because he sometimes would chat with Guo Qing, he was certain that Lou Cheng was chasing Yan Zheke. However, he always thought that such a beautiful girl might turn her nose up at him. “Even though Cheng has increased a lot in the ability of martial arts and become more confident and attractive during this semester. But next, doesn’t it at least need about a year to pursue her?</p><p>However, Cheng even wins both martial arts and love!</p><p>How does he move Yan Zheke, a girl who has so many pursuers?”</p><p>Cai Zongming smiled and nodded, “Yes. Everything comes to people who wait. From last term, he began to pursue her, and all his works finally paid off.”</p><p>Zhao Qiang froze there for a while and said,</p><p>“God, he is the real winner of life!”</p><p>Wu Qian asked curiously, “Are you talking about the beautiful girl in the Martial Arts Club?”</p><p>“Yes, at that time I didn’t hold any hope to it. However, you never know the results of this kind of love story until you really tried. What if he made it? What if he was very lucky? What if the girl didn’t care his ugly face?” Cai Zongming couldn’t stop but tease Lou Cheng who even wasn’t here now and then he said, “Even as an exotic boyfriend, I still feel so envious of them.”</p><p>“Exotic boyfriend… Have you also had a girlfriend?” The other roommate of Wu Qian asked with a smile.</p><p>Cai Zongming nodded and replied frankly and humorously, “Of course, do I look like the kind of boy who has no girlfriend, such as Zhao Qiang and Qiu Zhigao?”</p><p>Zhao Qiang and Qiu Zhigao was so embarrassed, so they said,</p><p>“Let’s go now. Do not waste any time!”</p><p>Cai Zongming laughed and said, “You are right. Here can be recognized as a hostile place. And all the members of the Martial Arts Club have gone. If we still stay here, we’ll be beaten!”</p><p>After saying this, he suddenly felt there was chill around, and then he saw that many members of Hongluo Martial Arts School were looking at him complicatedly. He was suddenly shocked and quickly took the other friends out of the martial arts school. When they went out, the sun was still shining in the sky. He said like he just escaped from hell,</p><p>“Let’s go! Let’s have fun!”</p><p>…</p><p>On the online car-hailing, Guo Qing couldn’t help but ask Yan Zheke, “Ke, why do you suddenly come out of the idea of going shopping?”</p><p>Yan Zheke put off her ponytail and flipped her hair. Then she turned to look out the window and said with a slight smile, “It’s because Cheng’s shoes have broken just now…”</p><p>“Oh, I get it…” Guo Qing suddenly understood and then she said with grievance, “Could you please stop showing off your sweet love story like this? I feel so envious!”</p><p>Yan Zheke didn’t feel shy due to her cute reaction. She smiled and said, “So you need to get your boyfriend as soon as possible.”</p><p>Guo Qing sighed, “Why do we not have a lesson about how to get a boyfriend? I even want to knock out Old Qiu and then make him be my boyfriend.”</p><p>Seeing Guo Qing looking at her, Yan Zheke laughed and said, “It’s useless to look at me. I have never pursued any guy! You need an expert to instruct you. Qing, in fact, you have regular features. So if you pay more attention to your appearance and don’t wear the clothes which would expose most of your arms and legs, you’ll find a boyfriend.”</p><p>“Yes, I think so!” Guo Qing was naturally optimistic and she was very outgoing. So she forgot this thing almost in a flash.</p><p>In the shopping mall, Yan Zheke and Guo Qing strolled from shop to shop. They selected and compared the martial arts shoes very seriously like they were doing a great thing.</p><p>…</p><p>There were few people in the moving school bus. Lou Cheng occupied two seats by himself. He took a nap under the warm sunlight. Sometimes he woke up to chat with Yan Zheke for a while and he was totally relaxed in the warm and idle atmosphere.</p><p>This’s what weekend should be like.</p><p>After arriving at the new campus, he said good bye to people like Li Mao, Lin Que and so on and then return to his dormitory.</p><p>Li Mao stood still and watched everyone leave. He recalled the combat just now, and his mind froze in the moment when Lou Cheng was fighting with Jiang Guosheng so drastically that his shoes even were fallen apart.</p><p>He reflected upon himself and thought of the tension he had whenever he got on the ring. He was suddenly afraid of being much behind his team members that he had no chance to catch up and make up the mistakes he made last year.</p><p>“Well, that’s okay. I’ll practice as much as possible and change all the movements into my instinct so that I can use them even when I’m nervous…” Li Mao took a deep breath and walked directly to the Songcheng Martial Arts School instead of returning to his dormitory.</p><p>Not long after, he carried his change clothes into the martial arts arena which was not empty. On the weekend, many students preferred to come here to keep fit and they could use all the things here, except the locker room.</p><p>Li Mao looked around and went to the men’s locker room. When he was going to take out of the key to open the door, suddenly he found a person was standing next to him.</p><p>“Oh, Senior Brother Chen…” He turned to look at that person and was surprised to find that person was Chen Changhua. “Why do you come here, either?”</p><p>Chen Changhua smiled with sorrow. “I have some pressure after I watch the combats of those two younger brothers. I’ll participate in the Professional Ranking Event in April, and definitely will run into Lou Cheng. He’s so good that I hope we aren’t on the same team. Thinking that I didn’t practice much in the morning, I thus come here to do more exercise this afternoon. Do you think so?”</p><p>“Yes.” Li Mao answered with a tacit smile.</p><p>This is our weekend.</p><p>…</p><p>When Lou Cheng went back to his dormitory, he opened the computer and clicked on the browser to find out what had changed with his personal forum after the live show today.</p><p>“God, there are four hundred and thirteen fans now.” He looked at this number and felt unbelievable.</p><p>Are there four hundred and thirteen people supporting me already?</p><p>This equals to the students of seven or eight classes combined in high school!</p><p>Looking through his forum, he found the post and the active ID were less than he thought, but it was also normal. Most of the people were silent online and the people who followed him might not be his supporters.</p><p>He read every post and he was amused by the talented answers of his fans. He was surprised that “Unparalleled Dragon King” had become his fan, and he was moved that “Eternal Nightfall” and “Brahman” had tried so hard to keep the order. And he picked up the phone to chat with Yan Zheke, and he planned to share this thing with her tonight when they were having dinner.</p><p>Lou Cheng also looked through the posts in the Longhu Club forum and he commented a little. At that time, “Wonton Seller” found him and asked curiously,” ‘Little Tiger’, why do you hide again recently?”</p><p>“Because I fell in love!” Lou Cheng said it humorously. He couldn’t wait to share his happiness with people all around the world.</p><p>“Hey, how can you get a girlfriend so quickly? The university students now are really good at it and make the old guys like us envy.” People like “Road to the Arena” began to tease him.</p><p>“Brahman” even incited Lou Cheng to update photos of his girlfriend, but he refused him mercilessly.</p><p>“Well, okay, do not force our ‘Little Tiger’ to do that. He is very shy ~”. “Wonton Seller” said with a smile.</p><p>At that time, “Road to the Arena” @ the moderator: ” ‘Riding pig’, it has been a long time that we knew each other, so how about organizing a party for us at some time?”</p><p>“OK, how about we meet when ‘Little Wonton’ finishes her entrance examination?” “Pig-Riding Knight” agreed.</p><p>“Okay! Let’s have a party until I finish my exam!” “Wonton Seller” said happily.</p><p>This group of people quickly began to focus on the discussion of gathering party. Lou Cheng watched them silently, and occasionally he would also cut in the conversation. He felt so leisurely, sometimes barked with Fatty Jiang and other friends, and sometimes called his mom to tell her that he had won the game.</p><p>For him, living like this was very comfortable. He was not only the calm and strong Lou Cheng on the arena who was talented in martial arts and could beat down his enemy, but also a living person who had his own social contacts, his friends, his daily lives and his emotions. Similarly, everyone had their own lives and they were also the main characters in their own world.</p><p>When all the roles and feelings mixed together, people called it “Life”.</p><p>The leisurely afternoon had passed away soon, and Lou Cheng received a message from Yan Zheke,</p><p>“Cheng, I’m back to school!”</p><p>“Please wait for me on the Mapletree Crossroad outside the First Cafeteria~”.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
