However, guessing had no matter with dealing with this thing. “How could I involve in the thing among the experts of super physical invulnerability?”</p><p>I must be patient, keep cool, wait for the results and never trip ourselves up!</p><p>He breathed out, and threw this thing to the back of his mind. Then he packed up and intended to go out.</p><p>On the weekend, Zhang Jingye went to date with his girlfriend Wu Qian. Qiu Zhigao was said to exercise in the Strength Training Gymnasium of Martial Arts Club. So there only were Lou Cheng and Zhao Qiang in the little dormitory.</p><p>Seeing he was leaving, Zhao Qiang took his eyes back from the computer and laughed. “Cheng, how was your wound? Can you participate in the combat now?”</p><p>“I can’t even do the recovery training, not to mention the combat.” Lou Cheng said with a wry smile.</p><p>“It was also because you save a life. Now you’re Superman Cheng in our dormitory.” Zhao Qiang said jokingly, “Since you won’t play this combat, I don’t watch it either. It’s boring without your participating.”</p><p>Lou Cheng was not surprised at all. The confrontation between fighters of amateur level had no way to attract everyone. But it still has a good point which my senior brother Li Mao won’t be so nervous if surrounded by less audience.</p><p>“OK, you can be a “real” fan.” Lou Cheng ridiculed him, put on the bag and walked out of the small room.</p><p>After experiencing the cold current boomerang, he found himself lacking a thermos cup. He usually would directly drink water in the drink fountain by the paper cups in the Martial Arts Club or in the school buildings. When he got to the dormitory, he only drank from a coverless ceramic mug. Yan Zheke had said that he lived roughly and lived up to the title of “Rough Guy.”</p><p>“Hey, Cheng, why go out so early?” Cai Zongming just came out from the bathroom.</p><p>“Not very early, I have to pick up my wife.” Lou Cheng laughed happily.</p><p>Cai Zongming ridiculed. “God, now you even called her as your wife?”</p><p>“I learned it all from you?” Lou Cheng answered him with a smile.</p><p>Cai Zongming disdained him, “I knew that you leave in advance to take the opportunity to date with your girlfriend. Hey, looking back to that year when we were in pairs that we always did everything together. And now that group of guys said I was brutally abandoned by you.”</p><p>Hearing the high-level self-deprecation of Little Ming, Lou Cheng couldn’t help laughing.</p><p>“There is no way for that. I am sorry that I ditch friends for a girl?”</p><p>He said it so proudly showing no shame at all.</p><p>Cai Zongming rarely was speechless and he had to underbragged. “Since you had a girlfriend, Cheng, you grow a thicker skin. Go, just go. I’ll go to cheer up for you in the martial arts club later. At least, I’m a member who also has special training.”</p><p>“Right, Talker, how’s your special training?” Lou Cheng asked unintentionally.</p><p>Cai Zongming gave the expression of “I want to hit you” and said, “Cheng, we’re all members of the special training, and we practiced together every day. Don’t you feel sorry that you only think of concerning and asking me today?”</p><p>“I’m sorry…” Lou Cheng answered with a hollow smile.</p><p>Cai Zongming showed a proud face. “After the special training which lasted more than ten days, I think that I’m back to the peak condition before and because of the stimulation from you, I also gradually drop into a peaceful mind and slightly touch the threshold of meditation. After one or two months, I may be able to do the concealment of spirit and qi and play 24 Blizzard Strikes. And I may directly reach the level of Amateur Third Pin in summer break which makes me able to go back to my hometown gloriously and brag myself in my small city.”</p><p>“Good, in the next semester you may be able to be a substitute.” Lou Cheng looked at his phone and checked the time. “I have to go now, see you later.”</p><p>Heard of his perfunctory farewells, Cai Zongming snapped.</p><p>“Go to your f*cking date!”</p><p>…</p><p>In the girl dormitory, Yan Zheke directly put on the martial arts suit so as not to change it in the male locker room. Although there was a small compartment for bath, it still would make the girl feel uncomfortable. The female locker room was given to the guest team.</p><p>Seeing her being ready, Zong Yanru asked curiously, “Ke, will your boyfriend fight this combat today?”</p><p>After she said that, Li Liantong who was playing games and Shi Xiangyang who was watching movies stopped their actions at the same time and they listened carefully.</p><p>“No way. How could he fight when his arm injury was not recovered yet?” Yan Zheke replied naturally.</p><p>Li Liantong blurted out and said, “Did his injury become worse because of the saving that day?”</p><p>Yan Zheke startled for a while with her black and beautiful eyebrows slightly wrinkled. “Do you guys all know about it?”</p><p>Li Liantong and Shi Xiangyang glance at each other and sulked. “We’re not blind. We met him at noon of that day. So how can we not recognize him in the video? We’ll just be waiting for your honest explanation, but we have waited for a week. Humph, you never even mention it!”</p><p>“You girls don’t talk about this topic so I have no chance to mention it.” Yan Zheke said in injured tones.</p><p>I can’t possibly directly show off how great my boyfriend is. Right? How bad it is!</p><p>“I think it’s because you have no time. You share all your spare time with him and when you come back to the bedroom, you’ll continue to chat with him on the phone. You two want to date with each other all day long!” Li Liantong laughed. “Ke, ah, you have to grab hold of yourself. Don’t lose your body to him so fast. For boys, the easier they get it, the less they would cherish it.”</p><p>“Pooh! I don’t talk with the dirty people!” Yan Zheke cursed jokingly.</p><p>Recalling this period, it seemed that Li Liantong was right that I was really enjoyed in this kind of state instead of feeling resistant.</p><p>Meanwhile, I have to go to the special training of martial arts every day, go to classes and do homework seriously. So, the time to accompany with Cheng is quite limited and is forced out which makes me cherish it more unconsciously.</p><p>Shi Xiangyang interrupted. “Ke, since both your boyfriend and Lin Que were hurt, will you play today?”</p><p>“That depends on the condition of other members. So there’s a chance of it.” Yan Zheke said it cautiously so as not to curse Li Mao and other people.</p><p>Zong Yanru suddenly said happily, “Then we’ll go to the martial arts club to cheer up for you! Maybe you can play this time.”</p><p>Li Liantong and Shi Xiangyang agreed and imagined Yan Zheke as a Wonder Woman.</p><p>While she was having fun with her roommates, she saw the message from Lou Cheng who said he had arrived. So she brought all her prepared things and went out of the dormitory quickly.</p><p>“They’re a perfect couple…” looking at her back, Li Liantong sighed with emotion.</p><p>Zong YanRu quipped. “Dirty Tong, you didn’t say that before!”</p><p>“That’s because I don’t know him too much before.” Li Liantong said with a thick “face”, “He reaches such a martial arts level when he’s so young. His future will be really bright. And his character is also very nice and he treated his girlfriend even better. I can’t agree more with the love relationship between Ke and him.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the Third dormitory building, Lou Cheng saw the girl walked out happily. He smiled unconsciously, walked towards him, took the bag, and held her hand. The whole process went very smoothly and was trained for a long time.</p><p>Yan Zheke looked at him with a smile. “Cheng, Dirty Tong and my other roommates knew that the boy who saved a life was you. They kinda worship you a little.”</p><p>“Hey, why this sentence sounds kind of weird…” Lou Cheng laughed seriously. “Because they have not seen the world.”</p><p>After saying that, he quickly transferred the topic. “Coach Shi can’t come this afternoon because he has something to do. So he let me take his place to arrange the game this afternoon.”</p><p>“God…” Yan Zheke slightly opened her mouth with bewilderment which made her look cute. It seemed that she did not figure out what happened just now.</p><p>After a few of seconds, she can’t help laughing. “Coach Shi is so capricious… Cheng, you’re the real Coach Lou~!”</p><p>“I’m not a real coach, for I’m also controlled by the Supreme Coach.” Lou Cheng laughed.</p><p>As for the supreme coach, he is certainly not Coach Shi!</p><p>Yan Zheke turned back, coughed twice and pretended to be serious. “How do you plan to arrange it?</p><p>“I thought if senior brother Li Mao showed up at last, he would be more nervous because he felt he was burdened with the success of our Martial Arts Club. However, if he were the first player, he mostly would feel he have to play a good start. So it would be better to put him on the second turn which would give him the least stress…”Lou Cheng said his concerns and also felt very lucky that he had studied the videos of Dream Squad for his girlfriend, so as not to know nothing about their opponents.</p><p>“Good, we think the same.” Yan Zheke praised him.</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed, “This is what people called “Great minds think alike”.</p><p>“Pooh!” Yan Zheke raised her head and closed mouth to show her disdain.</p><p>It was still early. The couple walked all the way slowly and took the opportunity to have a date. Sometimes they would also discuss their opponent. When they were approaching to the martial arts arena, Lou Cheng said surprisingly, “There’re so many people today.”</p><p>Students coming from everywhere are more than I expected!</p><p>Yan Zheke was also confused and laughed. “Does the Propaganda Department advertise it again at last?”</p><p>Both of them were blank and walked into the arena by holding hands. They saw there were some audiences on the seats of both sides.</p><p>“There’re almost a thousand people, right?” Lou Cheng exclaimed.</p><p>The number of students couldn’t compare with the number of University Martial Arts Combat, but also was enough to hold a combat.</p><p>Yan Zheke said with concern, “If the audience became more, senior brother Li Mao might feel more nervous…”</p><p>They entered the male locker room with concerns, and they directly saw Sun Jian standing up. He ridiculed.</p><p>“Cheng, it’s all your fault. You attracted so many students!”</p><p>“What wrong with me?” Lou Cheng asked with a muddled face.</p><p>Sun Jian laughed. “Did you save a student when he jumped from the building? Everyone was curious about who the hero was. So when they heard of there was a combat of Martial Arts Club on weekend, they came spontaneously.”</p><p>School didn’t advertise there was a preliminary of Martial Arts Club on this weekend, and it also didn’t hide the news. Because the combat needed the arena, people particularly put a notice on the door to tell the students who were used to practicing on Saturday afternoon not to come here. And the news traveled so fast.</p><p>“It’s really all my fault …” Lou Cheng never thought about this reason.</p><p>He could not help but look at Li Mao and found him sitting in the corner with a hot towel covering his face who seemed slightly nervous.</p><p>At that time, Lin Hua pulled Yan Zheke to the other side and whispered to her for a while.</p><p>Yan Zheke came back with a weird face, she whispered to Lou Cheng, “Sister Lin’s menstruation came earlier because of nervousness, so she doesn’t feel good today and asks me to replace her.”</p><p>“Well, can it even come earlier?” Lou Cheng asked surprisingly.</p><p>“Of course! It can be influenced by the mood change, stress, switching of habits and physical condition. For example, on the Valentine’s Day, I was already very tired, but you still proposed to me which made me feel so happy that my period also came early that night!” Yan Zheke whispered.</p><p>Lou Cheng counted, and then he said, “It came early by so much?”</p><p>“That’s because my period is shorter than usual people which only has 26 days.” Yan Zheke said shyly, “You’re the coach today. Arrange the start order now. Why bother to count this?”</p><p>Lou Cheng took a breath and looked at her. “Then you really have to play today.”</p><p>Yan Zheke nodded slightly with some excitement and nervousness.</p><p>“Ok!”</p><p>Lou Cheng shook her hand and whispered, “Don’t be afraid. You should be confident since we pair exercised for a few days. However strong they are, I still can beat them with one hand!”</p><p>Yan Zheke looked at the deliberately arrogant face of her boyfriend. She could not help laughing and felt relieved a lot.</p><p>And then Lou Cheng clapped to attract the attention of several senior brothers and sisters.</p><p>“Be quiet. Coach Shi can’t come today, so I’m appointed to replace him.”</p><p>“What?” Sun Jian and others looked at him with a stunned face.</p><p>Coach Lou?</p><p>He would probably be the youngest coach. He would probably be the youngest coach in the history of Martial Arts Club, even if he is the coach in only one combat…</p><p>…</p><p>In the female locker room, Qian Ruoyu who looked very sweet said,</p><p>“Lin Que in the other party can’t fight this time, but Lou Cheng would probably fight with his injury. However, their team focused on practicing their skills. So if Lou Cheng planned to play this combat, he must be the last to play. It needs us to beat the previous two fighters as soon as possible and to deal with him at full strength in the end.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
