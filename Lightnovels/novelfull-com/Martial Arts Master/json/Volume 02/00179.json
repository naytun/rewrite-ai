Within minutes Lou Cheng saw her appear at the unit doorway, holding a bag, and walking towards him with light footsteps.</p><p>As usual, she was in the white Songcheng University martial arts suit with black trim. However, it was the martial arts suit for reserves. She wore a pink white overcoat on the outside and looked like a beautiful white flower.</p><p>Lou Cheng went forward to welcome her. While taking her bag, holding her delicate hand, and smiling, he said,</p><p>“You seem to have recovered well. Your muscles aren’t aching anymore, are they?”</p><p>On the way back to the new school campus area last night, he brought Yan Zheke to the lakeside again, where he applied ointment to help her aching muscles and then kneaded them to ease her weariness. Obviously, he was striving to be a good boyfriend.</p><p>Her fragrance, tender skin, and gorgeous face had been attracting Lou Cheng during the process. Especially when he helped her take off her martial arts shoes and socks to do a foot massage. He felt as if he was undoing her clothes and hurried to kick the idea out of mind with his superhuman self-control ability. To make it up to himself, he gave her a passionate kiss.</p><p>“They’re no longer aching.” Yan Zheke said, smiling and showing her dimples, “I should call you massage master!”</p><p>“Hey hey, whenever you feel tired after special training or competition, you can come to me for this kind of physiotherapy.” Lou Cheng tried hard to keep the big smile off his face.</p><p>By then, Yan Zheke would have finished all the matches, so there would be nothing for him to worry about or struggle with over his desire!</p><p>Just thinking of it made Lou Cheng full of anticipation for the days to come!</p><p>Yan Zheke rolled her eyes, giving Lou Cheng a stare, and then said with anger and shame,</p><p>“You’re grinning like a lecher!”</p><p><em>Am I an idiot? Hum, you’ll certainly do the “physio” in front of other people to show off our relationship!</em></p><p>“What?” asked Lou Cheng, looking at her in bewilderment.</p><p>If it was not because both his hands were occupied by the girl and her bag, Lou Cheng would be kneading his stiff face now.</p><p>“Just look at yourself!” said Yan Zheke as she covered her mouth and chuckled.</p><p>While chatting and laughing, they rushed directly to the school bus station, where Guo Qing, Li Mao, and the others were waiting for them.</p><p>After getting on the bus and sitting themselves down, Yan Zheke noticed Lou Cheng’s tired face and asked with concern, “Cheng, why do you look so tired?”</p><p>She stopped here because Dirty Tong’s words suddenly came back to her, which made her face flush. Fighting back the laughter, she turned to look outside the windows. While feigning a casual voice, she asked, “You, did you sleep well last night?”</p><p>An image of Lou Chen’s figure flashed through her mind, rushing to the toilet with his waist and back bent last night. She tried so hard to stifle a laugh that her body was shaking because of it.</p><p><em>Oh, no! I’ve been corrupted by Cheng and Dirty Tong…</em></p><p>The girl’s reaction and her question made Lou Cheng’s thick-skinned face flush immediately.</p><p>Lou Cheng actually had an erotic dream last night, but he couldn’t remember Yan Zheke’s charming appearance when he woke up this morning…</p><p>Alas, after all, he was a strong young man with superhuman energy. Could he still stay calm under so much physiological stimulation yesterday?</p><p>Zheke’s mother had warned him to behave himself since enough was enough. It now seemed to be a great test!</p><p>But to what extent was it enough?</p><p>Thinking about it, he lowered his voice and explained, “You wronged me, Coach Yan. The reason I’m so tired isn’t that, but because I managed to cross the threshold of the visualization method today and overdrafted my mental power.”</p><p>“Visualization method…” Being born in a martial arts aristocratic family, Yan Zheke naturally could understand what Lou Cheng’s visualization method was. She hurried to turn around and asked in a surprised and cheerful voice, “Coach Shi acknowledged you as his disciple?”</p><p>He even showed Cheng the “visualization diagram”!</p><p>“Yes.” Lou Cheng admitted it frankly.</p><p><em>Master, I never told anyone about it, but she guessed on her own. So I haven’t broken my promise!</em></p><p>Yan Zheke rolled her eyes joyfully and twisted her lips into a smile. “From now on, you’re a martial arts expert’s disciple with a strong background, and you’ll no longer be bullied by anyone.”</p><p><em>Even those venerable seniors will think highly of you!</em></p><p>“That’s far from enough. Only through improving your own strength could you earn true honor and respect.” Having just crossed the threshold of the visualization method, Lou Cheng was now full of confidence.</p><p>Looking at his black eyes, shining with confidence, Yan Zheke smiled and said, “It took my cousin three months to learn the rudiments of Meteor force’s corresponding visualization method…”</p><p>Even if Cheng had been learning and comprehending the visualization diagram since his Power of Frost was awakened, it took him less than one month!</p><p>Thinking of it, she couldn’t help letting pride and joy color her tone.</p><p>Lou Cheng didn’t tell the truth, that he only spent one week, because he thought it was mostly due to the Jindan’s help. So he just smiled and explained, “Maybe everyone has different talents. I’ll soon master Frost Force with the help of my Power of Frost!”</p><p>Through saying these things, he didn’t mean to show off his achievement but to share the good news with his beloved girl, thus strengthening her confidence.</p><p>According to what Little Ming, the Casanova, said about long-distance relationships, Lou Cheng identified with a point that was stressed on it. When facing the challenge of time and distance, relationship keeping relied not only on the emotion but also on the lovers’ faith in each other. So they should give each other enough confidence in all aspects.</p><p>“Frost Force…” Yan Zheke repeated Lou Cheng’s words in a low voice, and her face was lit up with unobtrusive joy.</p><p>Being discontent with merely holding Yan Zheke’s hand, Lou Cheng entwined his fingers with hers while enjoying the moment of happiness. In a lover’s eyes, any topics, even the most boring ones, became so interesting.</p><p>After a while, Yan Zheke rolled her eyes wickedly and brought up the question again, out of curiosity. “If it’s not for that reason you were so tired, you’re admitting that you didn’t sleep well last night? Did you dream about something strange?”</p><p>She blushed as soon as her voice faded. Turning to look outside the window, she couldn’t help turning around secretly to see Lou Cheng’s reaction.</p><p>She found herself getting more bold and cheeky after such a time together with Cheng, which was terrible!</p><p>Lou Cheng forced a hollow laugh since the question reminded him of how he got up to change his underpants after midnight. He decided to tell the truth in a flirtatious tone,</p><p>“Yeah, I had an erotic dream, about you and me…”</p><p>“Stop!” Yan Zheke pounded on his Leg with his own hand and turned her eyes away in a flurry, but her flushing ears gave her away. After a long while, she calmed down, faced Lou Cheng, and mouthed, “You Lothario!”</p><p><em>“Didn’t you raise the question yourself? Why are you so embarrassed? Girls are always weird…”</em> Lou Cheng wanted to scratch the back of his head in confusion.</p><p>Noticing he had behaved himself, Yan Zheke nodded in satisfaction and said voluntarily, “Come a little closer, I’ll knead your temple to show you my ability as a massage master!”</p><p>“Good!” Lou Cheng was suddenly struck by this pleasant surprise. He moved sideward to make room for her. Then, she began kneading his temple with her slender and nimble fingers, relieving fatigue.</p><p>“You’re so skilled. When did you learn this?” Lou Cheng praised sincerely.</p><p>Yan Zheke raised her chin and replied with a little pride, “Yesterday when you gave me the message. It’s so easy that I immediately mastered the essentials. No one is as stupid as you are!”</p><p>“Yes, of course. You’re the symbol of wisdom in our home!” Lou Cheng praised her dramatically.</p><p>The tender girl induced a feeling of well-being. How Lou Cheng wished the road to the old campus was longer instead of only half an hour’s drive!</p><p>Yan Zheke’s opponent this morning was Zhang Hengwang, the strongest in her group, whose fighting videos had already been spread on the Internet.</p><p>Lou Cheng felt lucky that Zhang Hengwang was not Yan Zheke’s first opponent. When analyzing the fighting videos yesterday, Lou Cheng discovered that Yan Zheke was inexperienced in actual combat compared with Zhang Hengwang, making it easier for mistakes to happen.</p><p>However, after watching Yan Zheke’s three matches yesterday, Lou Cheng was sure his girlfriend was no longer a rookie. Considering her strength, superior familial kungfu, and what she had learned from his analysis of the fighting videos, she had at least a 70 percent chance to win the match.</p><p>Yan Zheke rolled her eyes joyfully and twisted her lips into a smile.</p><p>However, Lou Cheng had been worrying about her for fear of any accidents that would make her upset.</p><p>Just then, he saw three figures come towards him, whom he had once met but was not familiar with.</p><p>“Dream Squad?” Lou Cheng said to himself.</p><p>They were exactly Qian Ruoyu, Jiang Dingyi, and Feng Shaokun!</p><p>“What a coincidence.” Qian Ruoyu greeted Lou Cheng with a charming smile.</p><p>Lou Cheng felt a little confused. “Yeah, I’ve never expected you to be here.”</p><p>They were all of Amateur First Pin and didn’t need to enter the Ranking Event.</p><p>“We came to cheer for our junior sisters and junior brothers just like you and your girlfriend,” Qian Ruoyu said, then laughed and turned her gaze toward Yan Zheke, in the ring. “I saw you by accident and came to say hello.”</p><p>“I see…” Lou Cheng simply replied. He didn’t want to talk more since he was unfamiliar with them.</p><p>Qian Ruoyu didn’t pay much attention to Lou Cheng’s attitude as she continued with a smile,</p><p>“Are you going to join the work-study program this summer break? How about doing a part-time job at my family’s martial arts club? A nine-to-five job with considerable payment. And you only need to guide the students on their basic movements.”</p><p>She was actually conveying an invitation from her father. Since Lou Cheng was a gifted fighter with great potential and strong background, there were many fighters and forces intending to court him.</p><p>Though one couldn’t always turn enemies into allies, one more friend might provide you one more method, which was a universal truth that those cunning old foxes all knew clearly!</p><p>Lou Cheng knew he would soon reach the peak of body refining realm before summer break with the help of Thunder Roar Zen. After that, he needed to make preparations for knocking on the door of the Danqi State, which was quite expensive for him. So Lou Cheng had been looking for ways to make money—He still had some private money, which was used for dates with Yan Zheke and would certainly not be enough!</p><p>But Yan Zheke had to go back to Xiushan during summer break, so there was no need for him to stay at Songcheng.</p><p>He could also make money at Xiushan!</p><p>Thinking of it, Lou Cheng replied politely,</p><p>“I’m sorry but I must go home this summer break. Given an opportunity next time, I’ll be willing to take the part-time job.”</p><p>“You’re always welcome.” Qian Ruoyu was still wearing her standard smile.</p><p>After they turned and walked away, Qian Ruoyu took a deep breath and said,</p><p>“I feel so stressed and self-abased when I’m around that guy…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
