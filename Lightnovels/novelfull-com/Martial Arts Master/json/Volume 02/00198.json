It was a little earlier than his usual biological clock because he didn’t sleep well all night. He was dreaming, all erotic dreams related to Yan Zheke.</p><p>Erotic dreams were fine, but at the critical moment, his subconscious seemed to think this was wrong and forced him to stop whatever he was doing!</p><p><em>“I controlled myself in reality and also in my dreams… Can this really happen?!”</em> Lou Cheng silently smiled. For the first time, he realized that his will power was so powerful, that it could even affect his dreams.</p><p>Carefully thinking about it, he felt that this should be caused by his subconsciousness. With the warm and soft body in his arms, he was worried that he would have ‘wet’ dreams and that the dream would be reflected in reality. If he unconsciously touched Yan Zheke, it could result in misunderstanding and resentment. He was worried that he would have to change his underwear at midnight and leave her with a bad impression. So he had been self-controlled, even in his dreams.</p><p>He tightly held Yan Zheke’s waist, feeling his beloved in his arms. But he moved his lower body away, as he could not control his morning erection.</p><p>Suddenly, he found that her posture seemed not to have changed all night. She was always turned back to him, and curled up to sleep, quiet and restrained.</p><p><em>“She was also embarrassed in her sleep, and did not turn around?”</em> Lou Cheng’s mouth curved and smiled. Suddenly there came a little tacit understanding in his heart.</p><p>He supported his upper body so that he could see Yan Zheke’s sleeping face. Her face was fair and delicate, mouth slightly pouted. Was it because of worry, joy or both?</p><p>Lou Cheng enjoyed this scene for several minutes until he saw Yan Zheke slowly reach out, wipe her mouth, and then stick her finger in her mouth like a baby.</p><p><em>“So cute I could explode…”</em> Lou Cheng mind was swirling. When he finally remembered to take a photo, she had felt his searing gaze. She restlessly moved, turned her body, and slowly woke up. Her eyes innocently looked at Lou Cheng, while quietly asking, “What time is it?”</p><p>“Half past five…” Lou Cheng would not say that he had looked at her for nearly ten minutes.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s eyes gradually became more alert and she said,</p><p>“You can wash first. I want to lie for a while longer. The bed has kidnapped me.”</p><p>Lou Cheng had never seen her like this before. His heart felt like bursting. He paid attention to her posture, how she stretched her arm out and buried her head.</p><p>Aware of the shadow that blocked the light, Yan Zheke’s face showed a burst of faint red. She closed her eyes, lazily stretched out her hands and held Lou Cheng’s neck like a child wanting a hug.</p><p>Four lips connected, first gentle, and then passionate. Her tongue came and went after Lou Cheng sucked on it.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s hands were clinging to the bed, afraid of the slightest movement. Because after a night her pajamas were disheveled, revealing a lot of snow white skin. He was afraid that he would be unable to control himself if he touched her.</p><p>With no idea of how much time had passed, Lou Cheng raised his head. Seeing her charming and shy face, with wet and red lips and playful eyes, he kissed her once again.</p><p>Yan Zheke once again closed her eyes, but found her boyfriend did not go too deep but only lightly kissed the traces of their last kiss.</p><p>A warm feeling arose spontaneously from her heart. She opened her eyes. She looked at Lou Cheng, who was looking at her too. With shyness, she said, “Good morning.”</p><p>“Good morning.” Lou Cheng got up with great effort. He took out his martial arts suit and went into the bathroom. After changing, he came out in high spirits. Yan Zheke was sitting on the bed. Her black hair was loose, and she looked at him tenderly yet strangely.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Lou Cheng asked with bewilderment.</p><p>Yan Zheke seemed to have recovered. She tied her hair up, looking pure and innocent she shook her head.</p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p>She hurried out of bed and opened the suitcase. Holding a lot of things, she went into the bathroom and locked the door. She only showed an embarrassed smile.</p><p>She would not tell Lou Cheng that from waking to the present she felt comfortable, like an old couple!</p><p>…</p><p>The morning exercise started ten minutes later than expected, so the end of the exercise was delayed. When he was visiting the early stalls with Yan Zheke, Lou Cheng found that she was lively like a deer, which she had never shown before.</p><p>“Let’s eat rice dumplings! I especially want to eat this, okay? ” Yan Zheke holding the arm of Lou Cheng, said helplessly.</p><p>“Alright, alright!” How could Lou Cheng refuse such a request?</p><p>Sitting down, she had a meat dumpling and a rice dumpling. Lou Cheng doubled her food.</p><p>“I used to want to eat rice dumpling outside, but unfortunately I never had a chance.” Yan Zheke smiled.</p><p>Lou Cheng was tempted. “Do you mean the rice dumpling outside No.1 middle school?”</p><p>This was really something they shared due to their common high school experience.</p><p>“Right, you’ve eaten them?” Yan Zheke nodded in surprise.</p><p>“It’s so famous, how could I not eat it? I passed by every day. I love their glutinous rice dumpling with chili sauce and a variety of spices most after that is the glutinous rice dumpling with brown sugar. When I’m tired of that, then I’ll eat the meat and rice dumpling.” Lou Cheng recalled his early school days.</p><p>“Well, a lot of people in our class said that this was good. I especially wanted to eat that. But everyday mum made me breakfast, and my appetite was small, so I never had a chance.” Yan Zheke said pitifully.</p><p>Lou Cheng grinned and immediately replied, “In fact, fried dumplings from the cafeteria of No.1 middle school are also super delicious. The dumplings are golden yellow, while inside the meat is very tender. They’re particularly fragrant.”</p><p>That rice dumpling store was still open. During the summer holidays, he would take advantage of his morning exercise to buy a few. He would deliver breakfast for Yan Zheke like a deliveryman!</p><p>“I have eaten this before! Once Song Li bought a bag, so I tried one, and then I couldn’t stop…” Yan Zheke answered excitedly as if finding a fellow glutton.</p><p>They talked happily. They had an enjoyable and fun breakfast. Yan Zheke rarely ate at the roadside stalls, but now she happily stuffed her face.</p><p>When they returned to the hotel and stepped into the lobby, Yan Zheke suddenly paused after two steps. She turned to look to the side, with her cheeks flushed.</p><p>Her eyes looking around, she said in an ordinary tone,</p><p>“Cheng, it’s a waste of money to leave your room empty…”</p><p><em>Doesn’t it cost hundreds of yuan?</em></p><p>Confused for a while, Lou Cheng slowly realized her meaning and said with a smile, “Right!” I’ll go check out right now!”</p><p><em>I’ve got a place to sleep tonight!</em></p><p>Seeing Lou Cheng wanting to take her to the front desk, Yan Zheke was shy and anxious. She suddenly released his hand and ran to the elevator in a flash, leaving only a pout of embarrassment behind.</p><p>“You go on your own!”</p><p>Lou Cheng was planning to check out and was carrying the room card. Right now, he looked at the girl’s back with a smile and went to the front desk.</p><p>“Checkout.” He handed the room card out.</p><p>The front desk waiter took it, swiped it, and looked carefully.</p><p>“Is it this room?”</p><p>“That’s right.” Lou Cheng suddenly felt a little embarrassed.</p><p>It looked like they were going to be sleeping on the same bed…</p><p>The front desk waiter had seen this a lot, so he was discreet and quietly sent people to check the room, and then completed the checkout.</p><p>He had paid for two days so Lou Cheng breathed out, feeling his face becoming a little hot.</p><p>Next, he and Yan Zheke went to the nearby ancient town and bought some special food, shopping around a variety of old shophouses.</p><p>Because the traditional Chinese clothing on Yan Zheke looked amazing, Lou Cheng originally thought of taking her to try out various classic clothing from previous dynasties in the ancient town. But the quality was too shoddy. The clothes were casually put together, so she didn’t like them. Ultimately they chose to give up. Yan Zheke promised Lou Cheng that after returning to Xiushan, she would put on all her traditional Chinese outfits for him to see.</p><p>In the afternoon, they followed Lou Cheng’s plan and went to a nearby leisure villa. First fishing, then a barbecue. During this time, Yan Zheke became more relaxed in front of Lou Cheng and showed her lively side.</p><p>When she found her boyfriend’s Listening Skill could be used while fishing, she used sneaky tricks from time to time to ensure that she would be the final winner. Also during the barbecue, she unearthed the “little barbecue energy”!</p><p>In the end, with a ruddy face, she sat in her chair with a little sweat on her forehead, watching Lou Cheng continue to barbecue. He could properly use the heat of the furnace. She watched Lou Cheng prepare things, then he approached her, picked up a paper towel, bent over and wiped her face little by little.</p><p>For a moment, Yan Zheke felt intoxicated.</p><p>Holiday time flew by. Lou Cheng felt both joy and sorrow as the evening wore on. He wanted this feeling every day and every night. If he could only holding Yan Zheke, smelling her fragrance, feeling her body, talking a variety of interesting things with her, reminiscing about the past, and thinking of the future, life would be perfect!</p><p>At half-past two in the afternoon on the 3rd, the two sat on the bullet train to return to Songcheng. Holding each other’s hand, they felt a delicate connection in their hearts for the first time.</p><p>Feeling his girlfriend snuggled next to him, Lou Cheng recalled the memories from the tour. Every detail was so worth remembering. Their deep communication had made their hearts feel even closer.</p><p>If a shallow kiss becoming a deep kiss was physical progress in love, then this was a similar progress at the spiritual and emotional level.</p><p>At this moment, he came up with an idea.</p><p>“The draw for the knockout stage will be published tomorrow… And the broadcast bonus will soon be delivered…”</p><p>“At that time, I’ll send a ring to Ke…”</p><p><em>This is a vow for a lifetime.</em></p><p>Yan Zheke was leaning against her boyfriend, holding a shallow smile, and her eyes flowing with colors and thoughts.</p><p>“When the bonus of the broadcast is delivered, I’ll take Cheng to buy rings. He sends me one, I send him one…”</p><p>Her white cheek suddenly flushed, because she inexplicably thought of a phrase.</p><p>In pairs, in couples.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
