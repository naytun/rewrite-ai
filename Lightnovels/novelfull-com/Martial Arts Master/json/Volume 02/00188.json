When Lou Cheng and Lin Que pounced towards Zhu Tao from both sides like fierce beasts, the bald tough man abruptly ran to the side, with bulging muscles underneath his swarthy skin while springing his backbone. In the audience’s eyes, the tall and bulky fighter was running like a little white rabbit who got shot with an arrow.</p><p>Then he jumped out of the ring, out of the ring…</p><p>All the cheers came to an abrupt stop as the whole arena lapsed into silence. No one here had expected Zhu Tao, with his awe-inspiring presence, to suddenly surrendered without even a moment’s hesitation. He looked like he was escaping from a fierce beast’s cave.</p><p>Beneath the arena, Zhu Tao didn’t feel ashamed at all. On the contrary, he was congratulating himself for making a prompt decision at that crucial moment without any hesitation.</p><p>regardless of whether Lou Cheng had just finished a difficult battle or not, Zhu Tao wasn’t sure if he could even defeat Lou Cheng in a one-on-one match. The terrible Tremor Punch combo attack was still fresh in everyone’s minds!</p><p>Not to mention that Lin Que was also in the ring gazing at him with piercing eyes. Was there any better choice for him than surrendering?</p><p>It was not because he was cowardly, but because his opponents were too powerful and scary!</p><p><em>A wise man submits to his circumstances!</em></p><p>He had intended to raise his hand and call the referee to stop the game. But considering it was him who just threw Lou Cheng’s girlfriend out of the ring, he was afraid that Lou Cheng would pounce on him and beat him up before the referee could come and stop him. As a result, Zhu Tao decided to dodge and jump off the ring on his own initiative, just to be safe!</p><p>Lou Cheng paused, watching Zhu Tao’s former position as the poor guy jump off the ring, which amused him.</p><p>Having never expected that this seemingly tough, bald-headed guy would surrender without hesitation, Lou Cheng couldn’t help telling Lin Que the truth,</p><p>“To be honest, I almost use up all my stamina…”</p><p><em>Zhu Tao shouldn’t be so frightened!</em></p><p>Lou Cheng was not lying. Since he had just started learning Frost Force and was far from mastering it, it took him more energy to use the method each time. He had originally planned to use Frost Force followed by Thunder Roar Zen, which was then upset by the Double Elephant Trumpet. As a result, he had to gather all his energy into a second Frost Force and give his opponent the final blow, which consumed almost all his physical and mental strength.</p><p>However, Lou Cheng didn’t regard Zhu Tao’s surrender as a matter of rejoicing, for he was sure he would win the match anyway. If the competition hadn’t stopped, Lou Cheng would still be able to throw a Thunder Roar Zen at his opponent, not to mention his Professional-Ninth-Pin strength and the help from his Brother-in-law.</p><p>He would even act like Lin Que’s assistant and wait for him to defeat Zhu Tao. How nice it would have been!</p><p>Hearing what Lou Cheng had said, Lin Que turned and gave him one word,</p><p>“Likewise.”</p><p><em>“Likewise?”</em> Lou Cheng was stunned for a moment but soon understood what Lin Que meant. Staring at his Brother-in-law in astonishment, Lou Cheng found his eyes clear and steady, showing he was not lying.</p><p><em>“What a coincidence…”</em> Lou Cheng couldn’t help forcing a smile.</p><p>Then he saw the referee raise his right hand and announce loudly,</p><p>“The final result is that Songcheng University Martial Arts Club wins!”</p><p>The audience burst out yelling, both cheering for the victory and in regret for the final battle finishing so quickly.</p><p>What an explosive and breathtaking competition. The only shortcoming was that it was too short!</p><p>They were all left feeling unfulfilled!</p><p>…</p><p>With the referee’s announcement, Lou Cheng’s thoughts were soon replaced by the joy of winning the match and getting the bonus.</p><p>Lou Cheng raised his hand and applauded to acknowledge the crowd. Afterward, he came back to his team’s position, at a brisk pace in the wave of cheers, where he greeted Sun Jian, Li Mao, and the others with a fist bump, one by one.</p><p>When Yan Zheke’s turn came, Lou Cheng choked down the urge to hug her for fear that she might get embarrassed. He laughed in a low voice and said,</p><p>“I owe it all to Coach Yan’s advanced preparations!”</p><p>Yan Zheke gave him a big smile, showing her snowy teeth, and then raised her chin.</p><p>“Hum, now you know you won’t lose by listening to Coach Yan’s instructions?”</p><p>She turned and looked to the side. Feigning a calm tone, she added,</p><p>“Your Frost Force was also quite powerful…”</p><p>Yan Zheke’s praise greatly satisfied Lou Cheng, and he felt so proud of himself. He was even happier than when they won just now.</p><p>What was more, even without using the Jindan in his body, he could still master Frost Force on his own!</p><p>“I should have no problem with getting the advanced bonus,” said Lou Cheng with great joy.</p><p>At this moment he took the opportunity to make some plans. “We have been working hard these past three months. Now, we’ve finally got a good result. How about using the bonus to travel on Labor Day break and celebrate?”</p><p>Yan Zheke’s eyes lifted as her face flushed.</p><p>“Let me think about it!”</p><p>“Think about what?” Lou Cheng asked half-jokingly, and he was now very pleased.</p><p>The girl didn’t reject his invitation immediately, which meant he still had hoped!</p><p>“Hum, it depends on whether the tourism spots you chose satisfy me, and whether you can behave yourself!” Yan Zheke pretended to be annoyed, but her smiling eyes gave her away.</p><p>Geezer Shi, who had been looking at them silently, could not help complaining in his mind,</p><p><em>“It’s a problem that this guy hasn’t run into any trouble yet…”</em></p><p><em>“Why don’t you come and comfort your master? All you know is how to flatter your girlfriend!”</em></p><p><em>“I’d rather have a dog as my disciple instead of you!”</em></p><p>…</p><p>On the other side, Mo Zicong and Deng Hua made it back to Azure Dragon Squad’s position with the help of others. While one of them was pale and trembling, the other still felt dizzy and would retch occasionally.</p><p>Hearing the audience’s cheers, all the substitute fighters were upset, so they set Songcheng University Martial Arts Club as their common enemy.</p><p>“Songcheng University Martial Arts Club was really powerful, so are Lin Que and Lou Cheng. Actually, we still had a chance just now, but I underestimated Lou Cheng’s strength since I didn’t know he had mastered such an odd force…” Mo Zicong took a deep breath while criticizing himself seriously.</p><p>In fact, he was sincerely convinced by Lou Cheng’s strength and didn’t regret losing the competition. After being forced to fight recklessly, he had no chance to resist Lou Cheng’s Frost Force.</p><p>However, Mo Zicong couldn’t speak his mind out and admit that he was not Lou Cheng’s match. He should give hope to his team and thus create a chance to integrate the four martial arts clubs!</p><p>Deng Hua followed his topic. “I also made a mistake. Er, I never expected that Lin Que would have initially learned to gather his qi, blood, and force…”</p><p>“All in all, it’s a glorious defeat, and we’ll still aim to advance from group competition when we come back next year!” Zhu Tao also seized the opportunity to save some face.</p><p>Upon recalling the match just now, he felt frightened, as if Lou Cheng and Lin Que were still gazing at him.</p><p>The two were likely to be in the Dan stage when he met them in the ring next time.</p><p>…</p><p>In the studio of Songcheng TV station, Fang Juexiao put on a wry smile and said, “Though it was indeed an explosive match, wasn’t it too short? How long have they been fighting against each other, less than one minute?”</p><p>“Almost…” Gan Le laughed. “Don’t worry, it was enough to attract an audience, and we still have spare videos to fill the vacancy.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Fang Juexiao nodded. “Old Gan, I’m still thinking about the two blows Lou Cheng threw at Mo Zicong because they were so weird. Could you please analyze it for us?”</p><p>Gan Le nodded. “Okay, let’s look at the screen. It’s a screenshot of Lou Cheng and Mo Zicong’s match, in which we can see Mo Zicong’s pale face and blue lips clearly, as if he was suffering from hypothermia. We all know that Lou Cheng is good at 24 Blizzard Strikes, which belongs to the Unique Skills of the Ice Sect, so we have reason to believe that he has supernatural ability or special talent, which helped him master one of the core forces in Unique Skill of the Ice Sect in advance, before reaching the Dan stage!”</p><p>“I’ll explain. Before we reach the high-ranked Dan Stage, all the martial arts movements we learn are relatively simple and plain, focusing on how to gather our strength. Each school has its own secret know-how in this respect. Once the strength-gathering skill is combined with a visualization method, it will develop into Force, the core of any unique martial arts skills.”</p><p>“I’d go so far as to say that whatever school of the Ice Sect Lou Cheng belongs to, he can be one of the most important disciples in that school.”</p><p>“I see…” Fang Juexiao echoed. “Then what about Lin Que? It seems like he has once again made great progress according to the skills he used today?”</p><p>Gan Le made a positive response.</p><p>“Yeah, he had previously learned how to withdraw strength. Still, remember that I once predicted he would reach the Dan stage by the end of this year? Now I’ll correct it since he is likely to achieve it in the first half of this year!”</p><p>…</p><p>While listening to the match commentary in the video, Yan Xiaoling sent a post excitedly.</p><p>“Hey, will somebody please explain the core force of the Ice Sect?”</p><p>She added the Unparalleled Dragon King and Road to the Arena in the main post.</p><p>The Unparalleled Dragon King soon replied, “Aren’t you in charge of admiring Lou Cheng? Why are you asking a technical question?”</p><p>Eternal Nightfall, Yan Xiaoling, answered back sarcastically,</p><p>“Don’t look down upon me! I’m good at not only admiring him, but also eating shit, no, self-deprecation!”</p><p>The others openly made fun of her for this, but she never got annoyed. Instead, she was willing to cooperate with them and even fond of self-deprecation, which earned her the title of Shit-Eating Moderator in Lou Cheng’s fan form.</p><p>“I don’t know what to say.”</p><p>“She’s really worth the title of Northern Shit-Eating Demon…”</p><p>Brahman, Unparalleled Dragon King, and other familiar net friends clicked to like her one by one.</p><p>Finally, Unparalleled Dragon King gave a detailed explanation,</p><p>“The so-called Force is actually the core of a unique skill, without which even physical invulnerability movements would be useless with no more than 30 to 40 percent of its original power…”</p><p>“Only fighters at the Dan Stage or above could learn this level of kungfu. Neither their body-controlling ability nor physical condition was adequate enough to meet its needs. Though fighters at the Body Refining State can barely make an attempt, their Force can hardly display a special skill effect such as freezing or burning their opponent…”</p><p>“Lou Cheng has not reached the peak of Body Refining State yet, but he is still able to freeze someone with his Force, which suggests he might have a supernatural ability or some other special talents. Damn it, I just remembered he can use the Power of Blaze!”</p><p>“What the hell is it?”</p><p>Eternal Nightfall, Yan Xiaoling, replied with the emoji of a circling figure,</p><p>“Thank you, Dragon King. Though I’m still a little confused, I know it’s really powerful! I’ll fall in love with him all over again! Ah, why should the match be so short? I’ve waited all week for Lou Cheng’s several-minute performance! I’m feeling aggrieved, upset, and sad… Why couldn’t he show some mercy to his opponent and stay in the ring a little longer?”</p><p>Brahman sent a crying face. “Little Changye, I’m more depressed than you. How could my idol master the core Force of the Ice Sect so fast? I expected him to join Longhu Club after graduation and inherit the unique skills of the Fire Sect…”</p><p>“Anyway, he mastered the Force and will surely have a brilliant prospect!” Nie Qiqi and the others made the same comment.</p><p>Okamoto’s Fan suddenly said, “Am I the only one that noticed there was a substitute girl in Songcheng University Martial Arts Club who could score nine points?”</p><p>“You’re not the only one. I was about to say something when the match was over…” This Poor Monk Names Himself Randomly replied, “I even want to attend this year’s college entrance exam and apply for Songcheng University. Then, I could join the Martial Arts Club!”</p><p>Seeing this reply, Yan Xiaoling giggled and said to herself,</p><p>“I’m already here…”</p><p>She again added Unparalleled Dragon King and asked him with pleasure, “How far do you think Lou Cheng and his teammates will reach in the preliminaries?”</p><p>“They should have no problem advancing from the team match, but there will be less hope for them to advance further since their opponents will continue to be more powerful. With the knockout still more than one month away, who knows how much progress Lou Cheng and Lin Que will make? We shouldn’t try to predict it so early…” The Unparalleled Dragon King dared not comment.</p><p>…</p><p>Shu Rui, the reporter of Songcheng TV station, interviewed Azure Dragon Squad first since they were in a hurry to leave. Then she went to wait outside the locker room of the champion team, for the purpose of interviewing them one by one!</p><p>Liu Que was the first to come out. This cool and calm young man made Shu Rui wince a little since she recalled Liu Que’s dry humor last time.</p><p>She asked cautiously, “Lin Que, is an interview convenient for you at present?”</p><p>Lin Que nodded.</p><p>Shu Rui cautiously selected her words and said, “Lin Que, your pounce towards Deng Hua just now was more explosive and powerful than usual. Does that suggest that you have preliminarily learned how to withdraw your strength?”</p><p>Lin Que answered seriously,</p><p>“That’s a secret.”</p><p><em>“Secret? We all know what that means!”</em> Shu Rui was almost driven berserk.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
