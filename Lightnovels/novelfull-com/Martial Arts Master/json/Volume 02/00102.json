Determination! Wait till I join the special training this semester, and I’ll rechallenge you before the summer break!”</p><p>“Great, I shall wait and see!” Lou Cheng did not pursue on with this matter but moved on with what’s on his mind. He glanced left and right before he whispered, “Talker, to the balcony, I’ve something to consult you.”</p><p>Cai Zongming took down the hero head kerchief on his head, gave an evil laugh and said, “Your goddess and you have a breakthrough, and you need my advice on what to do next?”</p><p>“F*ck, how did you guess that?” Lou Cheng replied with a shock.</p><p>Cai Zongming tsk-tsked. “Look, you just don’t carve the matter out into words. Your lecherous expression tells it all!”</p><p>Lou Cheng touched his face, smile forcefully and said, “Is it that obvious?”</p><p>While chatting, both of them arrived at the balcony. They had closed the glass door that led to the living room, isolating themselves from the rest of the world.</p><p>Just as Lou Cheng was about to start, Cai Zongming grinned cheekily and said,</p><p>“Well, feel like there’s a need for some cigarettes whenever we’re here to chat. How about this? You pretend to give me a cigarette, while I pretend to smoke.”</p><p>Hee… Lou Cheng gave him a despising look and pretended to take a cigarette from his pocket. He then handed “it” to him and added, “Come, Casanova, here’s a ‘cigarette’ for you.”</p><p>“Great!” Cai Zongming grinned and took “it”. He placed “it” in his mouth.</p><p>Just when he was about to “light it”, Lou Cheng smiled and added, “I’ve fire, I’ve fire. Let me light it up for you!”</p><p>“Not bad, you’re pretty observant!” Cai Zongming praised and stretched his head forward, waiting for someone to light his “cigarette”.</p><p>Lou Cheng tried to suppress his smirk as he stretched out his right hand and snapped his finger loudly in front of Cai Zongming.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>A small fire appeared, and burnt Cai Zongming’s two strands of hair.</p><p>“Dafug…” Cai Zongming blurted out. His eyes seemed as if he was still looking at that fire and said, “Bastard, you know magic?”</p><p>“Magic? Have you seen cool magic like this before?” Lou Cheng boasted as he snapped his finger again and again, creating several small fires.</p><p>Cai Zongming touched his hair on his forehead as his expression kept changing. He then blurted out.</p><p>“Cheng, I’ll take back my words about challenging you before summer break. Bastard, how can you bully people with your supernatural ability?”</p><p>Lou Cheng smirked and asked, “Why take back your words? Don’t tell me you’re getting cold feet?”</p><p>“Why would I? This’s a promise between men, so we’re gonna keep our promise!” Cai Zongming promised, giving off a sense of righteousness and justice. “But you’re gonna tie up one of your hands, to be fair!”</p><p>“Sure, sure, sure, I’ll just fight you with one hand.” Lou Cheng beamed with happiness.</p><p>By then, Cai Zongming had finally calmed down as he asked surprisingly and curiously, “When did you awaken your supernatural ability? Is it strong?”</p><p>“Thought you’ve seen the video on my battle with Ye Youting?” Lou Cheng questioned him back instead.</p><p>Cai Zongming saw the light and added, “That battle? If you talk about other battles, perhaps I can’t remember, but I’ve got a vivid impression of that battle. Yeah, that lady is not bad looking… Anyway, you mean that your final fierce attack is your supernatural ability awakening?”</p><p>“Yup, currently it’s not strong, I’m gradually working on it. Now it can only be used to light a cigarette.” Lou Cheng honestly stated the power of his supernatural ability.</p><p>As for how he could work on it, he was sure there would be a way. Perhaps he got to wait till he had the body quality of Professional Ninth Pin, before he tried to exert pressure onto the Jindan (the Golden Elixir) again. As long as he did not overdo it to the extent greater than that day at the Challenge Tournament, he was sure that he could slowly digest that Jindan (the Golden Elixir) into his body as one.</p><p>Cai Zongming touched his chin and took a glance at Lou Cheng. “Within this half a year, you seem to have gone through lots of changes… Just feel that what you’ve been through can’t be explained with science at all…”</p><p>“Haha.” Lou Cheng forced a laughter before he added. “I’ve dated Yan Zheke to go for a big feast a couple of days later. Casanova, do you think I have the chance to hold her hands?”</p><p>Because he had yet to prepare any strategy, nor booked any restaurant, nor fixed a date.</p><p>“Hold hands?” Cai Zongming looked doubtful. “Which stage are you all at now? If you aren’t clear about it, it’ll be difficult for me to make a judgment…”</p><p>Lou Cheng pondered about it before answering. “During our free time, we can chat on QQ from morning till night. At times, we’ll chat on the phone or via video calls. On my birthday, she even waited till 12 a.m. sharp to call and wish me. When I requested for a birthday song as a present, she sang. Today, I brought the food she likes for her. She seemed very surprised, happy, and had even promised to go with me for a big feast…”</p><p>The moment he finished his sentence, he looked at Cai Zongming, waiting for his comments and guidance. However, the Casanova just reacted with a half-opened mouth and a dumb face.</p><p>“Casanova?” Lou Cheng waved his hand in front of Cai Zongming.</p><p>Cai Zongming was taken a back as he said, “Why you guys proceed so fast? Do I miss anything in between? I recall you two are just friends before the break, even if both of you are to send messages on QQ everyday, things shouldn’t advance that fast either. Moreover, with your personality, it’s impossible for the relationship to improve by leaps and bounds…”</p><p>Seeing the old hand was surprised by how fast their relationship had progressed, Lou Cheng was ecstatic. He recalled and said,</p><p>“I feel that our relationship breakthrough started during the few days at Warrior Sage Challenge Tournament. Since both of us shared a common interest in martial arts, and also it was my first time participating in a Challenge Tournament, not forgetting the shocking experience I had in the later battles, our relationship had become stronger and better…”</p><p>Cai Zongming pondered and said, “No wonder… I always think your goddess will be hard to pursue, or else you won’t need to try all means to please her and be prepared to fight a long-term war. Never thought that you could take advantage of the Challenge Tournament to win the girl’s heart, what a lucky bastard you are!”</p><p>Lou Cheng did not despise the way he put it, his eyes widened as he gazed at him instead. “You mean she likes me too?”</p><p>Cai Zongming smiled gently and answered, “Don’t say it so directly. Women are complicated, all I can say is that she certainly has a good impression of you. As for to what degree, I’m not a mind reader, nor did I see her firsthand reaction there, so how would I know?”</p><p>“However being at this stage also means that this’s a very dangerous period. To most of the girls, in particular for those who are more conservative, they’ll need to be very careful when deciding whether to be in a relationship with a guy. It’s better that you don’t pressurize her too much, or it might lead to rebellious mentality, or worst, her good impression of you will decline. Even so, you can’t stop flirting with her and can’t stop presenting the best side of you. If you didn’t do anything for the next one and a half year, you this bastard will end up becoming her bestie. By then, you’ll only have the leftover girls to pick from.</p><p>“Now that you say this, I’m feeling anxious again.” Lou Cheng commented, taking a breath of cool air.</p><p>Cai Zongming jested. “Chill bro, you’re almost near the finishing line. As long as you continue to perform your best, there’s still chance! Moreover, you still have me as your strong backing, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Why your words sound kinda disgusting… Strong backing…” Lou Cheng joked, trying to make himself forget the worries and feel better.</p><p>“I kinda start to understand. You goddess must have chosen to focus on studies while in junior high school, so no matter how outstanding her pursuers were, she wasn’t bothered by them. If you tried your luck at that time, even with the same Warrior Sage Challenge Tournament experience, I believe there would be zero chance for you to win her heart. However, by the time she goes college, she’ll feel that she’s an adult and will no longer be very stressful about studies. Subconsciously, she starts to look forward to falling in love. That’s when a crack appears in her inner defensive wall and just then, you appeared.” Cai Zongming excitedly analyzed the situation.</p><p>Upon hearing, Lou Cheng was impressed by it and said, “What you’ve analyzed in the first half is exactly what Yan Zheke told me!”</p><p>Student Killer!</p><p>Cai Zongming initially grinned, then followed by a sigh before he displayed an old hand look. He then added, “This’s about meeting the right person at the right time.”</p><p>“Then I shouldn’t try to hold her hand when I date her out, or else I may give her too much pressure?” Lou Cheng went back to the main topic as he voiced out his concern.</p><p>Cai Zongming cackled and said,</p><p>“It’s only your first date and you’ve already thought of holding hands? Are you planning to leave her an impression that you’re a lecher? Holding hands is much more significant than kissing, and it’s a critical stage that can transform quantity into quality. Once you manage to hold her hand, it means a relationship is established. Kissing is just a matter of time.”</p><p>“Of course, if the both of you are just planning for a one night stand, then ignore what I’ve said.”</p><p>Lou Cheng was suddenly enlightened and he added, “I never know that holding hands can be so critical… Casanova, how do you think I should present myself on that day?”</p><p>“Just present yourself like you always do, and do things that please her as usual. You gotta know that she’s nervous as well, so do your best to create a comfortable atmosphere.” Cai Zongming paused all of a sudden, chuckled and whispered, “Also, I’ll teach you another thing.”</p><p>“What?” Lou Cheng answered excitedly.</p><p>Cai Zongming coughed twice and continued, “Since she’d already promised to go out with you alone on a date, the girl will look forward to it. If you really did nothing special for her, she might be disappointed. She’ll be weighing the pros and cons of this relationship, and start to think if you haven’t loved her deep enough. So you gotta do something, without making her nervous and stress.”</p><p>“What I gotta do?” Lou Cheng immediately asked.</p><p>Cai Zongming grinned and added, “Gotta find a chance to hold her hand! Oh, but don’t really hold it. You must express your excitement and expectation, yet at the same time, your unfamiliarity, nervousness and act as if nothing has happened. Show her your upsetting look when you ‘fail’ to hold her hand twice and give up. Let her know your feeling so that you can make her feel nervous and stress without overdoing it.”</p><p>“Even if within her heart, she feels that both of you are not yet to the stage of holding hands, and cause her impression of you to worsen a little after the matter, both of you can continue to flirt and work on the relationship since you have not successfully held her hand.</p><p>“After you’re done with this, come back and observe her attitude. If there’s not much change, then there’s more than 70% possibility that you have succeeded. If she starts to become slightly colder towards you, this means the time hasn’t ripe and you gotta work harder. So let’s say it’s the former, you should try to date her again after a period. If she agrees to go out with you again, this means she’s ready, and you can just be brave to hold her hand when the time is right!”</p><p>Lou Cheng stared at him in astonishment as he felt that Ming was really godlike. He listened and digested the details before he spoke. “Have you tried this move before?”</p><p>Cai Zongming spread out his hands.</p><p>“Of course not!”</p><p>Lou Cheng twitched the corner of his mouth and yelled. “Then how can you still teach me that!”</p><p>“Do you think I need such techniques to test a girl? Based on my judgment, experience, and standard, do you think I don’t know when to initiate hold hands?” Cai Zongming questioned him as he felt pleased with himself. “Relax, I bet it on my ‘Casanova’ nickname that this move will definitely work. Of course, if the other party is too obtuse and doesn’t realize your intention of holding hands, then I’m helpless. Also, you gotta learn how to observe the situation. If the ambiance and her reaction are good enough, then change your plan. Hold her hand for real.”</p><p>Lou Cheng frowned and asked, “Do you think a newbie like me can handle such a complicated stuff?”</p><p>“Well, just being your true self is good enough.” Cai Zongming teased.</p><p>But my true self will be shaky, nervous and try to pretend that nothing has happened!</p><p>Lou Cheng did not retort as he kept silent in agreement and confirmed his plan. After which, he said, “Is Qin Mo around? I need to come out with a food strategy. He’s from Songcheng, asking him directly is better than googling it.”</p><p>“Still sleeping, you gotta wait till noon.” Cai Zongming replied as he patted Lou Cheng’s shoulder and gave him a you-can-do-it hand gesture. He then pulled open the glass door and returned to the living room.</p><p>Lou Cheng took out his phone and gave Geezer Shi a call.</p><p>“Master, I’m back at the dormitory.”</p><p>Geezer Shi pretended to reprimand him. “Finally bear to come back? Alright, since all are back, we’ll begin our special training tomorrow at 8 a.m.. You’ll wake at 5:30 a.m. and wait for me at the old place.”</p><p>“Sure.” Lou Cheng answered without any hesitation.</p><p>It’s time again for martial arts practice from morning till afternoon…</p><p>But now I’m no longer an ignorant person!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
