He walked towards the ring and saw Li Mao struggling to stand up on his feet. Li Mao shook his head once and staggered back to his team.</p><p>When he came across Li Mao who was still feeling a little dizzy, Sun Jian took the initiative to extend his fist and said wholeheartedly,</p><p>“Terrific!”</p><p>Li Mao instinctively straightened up his back. He could not hide his smile when he gently bumped fist with Sun Jian and completed the greeting ceremony.</p><p>“Senior Brother Sun, do your best!”</p><p>Sun Jian nodded and walked past Li Mao. He had seen the path leading towards honor and glory.</p><p>This is the last battle of the match. I shall be the end of all battles!</p><p>This time, I’m really fighting instead of only showing a pose!</p><p>While he went upstairs along the stone, Sun Jian suddenly had some feelings.</p><p>I was born in a family with professors. So I studied from the subordinate kindergarten, attached primary school, attached secondary school, key high school and now to my father’s university without experiencing too many setbacks and never been bullied by other students. At first, I started to learn martial arts only for showing off in front of my childhood friends. Later, I practiced it because I wanted to escape from the higher standard of my father and regarded the Martial Arts Club as a shelter which could help me get peace and freedom.</p><p>With this mentality, I certainly won’t be afraid, but on the contrary, I also won’t treat the fight with a tough and desperate attitude.</p><p>Just after shouted out “kick your sorry ass,” he felt that his educated and gentle manner was thrown away. Meanwhile, the brutality hidden in the bottom of his heart was woken up which encouraged him to challenge the strong monster.</p><p>Boarding on the ring, Sun Jian suddenly felt that he was so small when he saw his opponent who was almost 190 centimeters high just like an iron tower. He felt that he had to look up at him just like facing his father who was an academic leader whose image was so great within his heart. He was afraid of his father and he had a deep shadow for his frowning, his strictness and his order.</p><p>If you couldn’t challenge the authority and wouldn’t obey the orders, the only thing you could do is to escape.</p><p>But now, he wouldn’t escape anymore because he had to face it anyway. Looking at the high and powerful Jiang Dingyi who looked like invincible, he cried in a low voice,</p><p>“Kick your sorry ass!”</p><p>…</p><p>Lou Cheng knew nothing about Sun Jian’s psychological changes. Now, he felt very relaxed and did not hold too earnest expectations to the final results.</p><p>The development of those several games had already made him feel satisfied today!</p><p>Yan Zheke has won her first fighting game and also accumulated the experience about crisis. Li Mao finally defeated the devil hiding in his heart and achieved his dream of victory. So there is no reason for me to feel unsatisfied!</p><p>As for the final victory, it looks like the brightest jewel on the top of crown which is better to have it. But without the victory it still won’t damage the essence of the crown.</p><p>At that time, Li Mao got back to the seat accompanied by a burst of applause and he stopped in front of Lou Cheng.</p><p>Lou Cheng reached out his right hand and held it into a fist.</p><p>“You did it!”</p><p>Li Mao looked like he was going to cry. He also reached out his right hand and pounded fist with Lou Cheng. At the same time, he whispered,</p><p>“Thank you!”</p><p>Thanks for never giving me up!</p><p>At first, Lou Cheng was going to recall some famous sayings to encourage Senior Brother Li Mao. And if he couldn’t think of them, he would make some up. But the referee on the ring did not give him this opportunity. He waved his right hand to announce the start of the last game when both Jiang Dingyi and Sun Jian had stood by.</p><p>Sun Jian had much more experience on the real fight than Lou Cheng. So without Lou Cheng’s reminding, he knew that he had to hit the left shoulder of Jiang Dingyi fiercely which was hurt by Li Mao. As soon as he heard the word “start,” he suddenly leaned back, walked with Snake Steps and flashed to the left side of his enemy.</p><p>With his spine straightened, his right leg also became tighten. He snapped out his leg very quickly and kicked to the left knee of Jiang Dingyi.</p><p>Jiang Dingyi was good at power and not flexible enough. So he didn’t compete with Sun Jian about agility and physical movement. Facing this, there appeared the scene which was that the ground cracked and the volcanic erupted in his mind. And the muscle on his thigh suddenly tightened which made his pants stretched and outlined the good-shaped muscles.</p><p>Bam! A side kick was thrown out remarkably and came so quickly which exactly confronted with the Whip Kick of Sun Jian.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Sun Jian swung back his right leg and felt a burst of soreness of his hurting points which made him almost lose his focus.</p><p>This made him realize the gap between Jiang Dingyi and him in power.</p><p>Simply comparing the power of the body with Jiang Dingyi, he was much worse than him who also controlled the meditation and had the idea of short burst of fighting the game!</p><p>Sun Jian was so firm that he did not let the depressed feelings affect himself. He sat back his right foot, stepped on the ground and straightened his back to hit the left shoulder of his opponent ferociously like a bomb.</p><p>Because both Sun Jian and Li Mao didn’t reach the meditation level on 24 Blizzard Strikes, they didn’t have the corresponding visualizing ways to help them. They could play some power out only by experiences and feelings during the fighting process. If they met an enemy with much too strong power, they would have a problem in dealing with the coherence of their movements and couldn’t play the power out which also meant that they couldn’t fight more ferocious and more desperate.</p><p>And Li Mao could narrowly play the 24 Blizzard Strikes just now, only because he was fighting with Feng Shaokun who had already consumed a lot of stamina and had declined a lot in all respects. However, Sun Jian couldn’t play the same way as his Junior Brother Li Mao.</p><p>But he also had his own advantage, that is, he was able to hit the wound of his opponent fiercely.</p><p>As soon as he took back his right leg that he had to face the Blast Punch from his enemy. Jiang Dingyi didn’t move his left shoulder and set his right foot as a pivot which helped him move backward quickly. Meanwhile, he hit his right hand fiercely like a knife which went exactly down to the fist of Sun Jian. This movement made the right arm of Sun Jian bounce off and made him took back his attack quickly.</p><p>Sun Jian wasn’t very annoyed. On the contrary, he was a little glad. He thought that the previous performance of Jiang Dingyi showed that his injury on his left shoulder was so heavy that he might have no chance to use his left hand.</p><p>He slid to the right side of Jiang Dingyi who was turning back at that time. He then opened his left hand like a sharp claw and suddenly hit the left shoulder of Jiang Dingyi. Once he could clutch him, then his enemy would get injured heavily with a fracture.</p><p>The members of Martial Arts Club like Sun Jian and Li Mao who were born in the ordinary family were different from others. They mostly were taught by the famous teacher in their home town. So what they learned also included a lot of great playing style except 24 Blizzard Strikes. For example, the Flower-tearing and Willow-striking Hand which Sun Jian was playing now, and if it could be played practically, it could almost cut down one arm of the enemy with only one grasping, one catching and one tearing.</p><p>Jiang Dingyi showed no emotion. He twisted his spine peristalsis and bounced his back to abruptly throw himself to the right side to avoid the grasping from Sun Jian.</p><p>Sun Jian felt so happy and he honestly caught up with his enemy. He continuously hit the left side of Jiang Dingyi. While Jiang Dingyi sometimes defended by legs, sometimes he changed his moving style or sometimes he ran away to avoid his attack, but he still couldn’t get rid of his attacks and was forced to the edge of the ring.</p><p>When Sun Jian was going to take this advantage to beat him down, he found that Jiang Dingyi suddenly paused as if his legs were two nails which made him firmly stand on the edge of the ring, and his body suddenly rounded back with this rebounding trend. He also lifted his left arm which turned into a sharp knife and front swept horribly with the help of visualization.</p><p>At that moment, he was like a great general who was riding a horse and fighting a war. He dragged a long knife and was chased by the enemy. And then he suddenly straightened the reins so that his beloved horse could stop at once and raise its forefeet. At the same time, he could depend on the rebounding power to fight back and unexpectedly kill the chasing enemy.</p><p>That was the Trailing Blade Style!</p><p>Jiang Dingyi planned for a long time to wait for this opportunity which could beat down Sun Jian at once!</p><p>Sun Jian rushed too hard and was unable to avoid. So he could only take a deep breath and set up his left arm to defend himself.</p><p>Bang! Jiang Dingyi hit Sun Jian’s left arm fiercely with his left hand. The Trailing Blade Style which he had planned for a long time showed its great power and hit Sun Jian out only with one attack.</p><p>“Li Mao was flying…” Yan Zheke clenched the left palm of Lou Cheng with worries in her beautiful eyes.</p><p>She hoped that today could be a perfect day that she could get the victory and at the same time their Martial Arts Club also could win the game.</p><p>“Senior Brother Sun offered to fly away…” Lou Cheng comforted his girlfriend while he was staring at the ring.</p><p>Sun Jian was hit out. Just when he was reaching the ground, he suddenly stretched out of his two hands and used the power on his fascia joint to press on the ground.</p><p>Bang! His body suddenly bounced to another direction and escaped from the “leg blade” of Jiang Dingyi very narrowly.</p><p>During the process of bouncing, Sun Jian turned over in the air and touched the ground with his feet. Then he bounced again to change a position and finally he found his center of gravity.</p><p>That was Catapulting Movement!</p><p>It was in the same level of Modern Blast Punch and Shooting Fillip which was made by imitating the jump shot of bullets.</p><p>If Sun Jian didn’t fly out when facing the last strike, he would at least get fractures on his left arm. So people could know the terror of the Trailing Blade Style!</p><p>As soon as he stood still, Sun Jian saw that Jiang Dingyi rushed over aggressively.</p><p>He did not choose to escape. He clenched his teeth and directly fought back with only one thought in his mind,</p><p>I don’t believe that your left shoulder will be okay after it was directly hit by Li Mao and played such ferocious Trailing Blade Style.</p><p>Never give him the opportunity to recover!</p><p>In the face of this ferocious attack, Jiang Dingyi finally changed his attitude.</p><p>These two people closed to each other in a moment. Sun Jian bent a little and escaped to the front of his enemy, and then he started the hand-to-hand fight with Jiang Dingyi steadily and surely with his hand, wrist and elbow just like practicing with a wooden man.</p><p>Bang, bang, bang. These two continued to attack each other with the playing sound broke out again and again. The audience also felt very nervous because of the fierce fighting process.</p><p>Sun Jian thought he was going to be beaten down by his enemy whose power was a little stronger than him, he suddenly perceived that the left arm of Jiang Dingyi slowed down a bit.</p><p>Too late to think about the reason, Sun Jian hit his enemy with a cross elbow as soon as possible and took the advantage to attack.</p><p>Pooh! His elbowing beat back the left arm of Jiang Dingyi so that to make Jiang Dingyi expose a lot of space on his body for him to attack.</p><p>That’s an opportunity!</p><p>Sun Jian was unable to think carefully about the current situation, following the instinct, and he straightened his elbow with the power from the rebounding and the power of the joints. Then he threw out his forearm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>His forearm with a fist hit exactly on the ribs, even though this strike wasn’t powerful. It still made his enemy scream and suddenly shrink the body.</p><p>Sun Jian took this chance to resist counterattack of his enemy and at the same time, he opened his fist to grab his enemy. Then, he moved forward with his right leg and put it in the middle of Jiang Dingyi’s legs.</p><p>At that time, there was only one thought in his mind, that was,</p><p>“Kick your sorry ass!”</p><p>“Kick him out!” He suddenly pushed up his arms and used the right leg as a fulcrum. He cast his enemy out to the edge of the ring.</p><p>Pong!</p><p>Jiang Dingyi fell outside the ring with his back touching the ground, accompanied by the cheering words and crying of the audience.</p><p>Sun Jian gasped and raised his right hand. He shouted within his heart,</p><p>“Awesome!”</p><p>The referee also raised his right hand to announce the result,</p><p>“Round Five, Sun Jian wins!”</p><p>“The final result is Songcheng University Martial Arts Club wins!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
