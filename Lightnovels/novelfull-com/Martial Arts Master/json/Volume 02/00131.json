Naturally, he would not shift the battle into the other side’s advantages. He was planning to learn from Lin Que just now, putting on a stance, neutralizing and countering Wei Shengtian’s attacks. He tried to adapt flexibly, unleash his advantage of being in a perfect condition and having an abnormal amount of stamina, and wait for the opportunity to shift the balance of victory to show up.</p><p>Wei Shengtian had just experienced an intense battle earlier and got rammed into fiercely by him. He had also used his full power three to four times. Just how long could he maintain his current level of strength?</p><p>Pam! The air erupted, and Wei Shengtian swung his right fist right onto Lou Cheng’s prepared stance, causing his arms to tremble and his body to shake.</p><p>It was at this moment Lou Cheng turned his back rapidly, borrowing the punch’s strength and exerting the force of his body and his joint bones all at once. He immediately spread out and followed up with a toss!</p><p>This was Swing Force he learned after the battle with Jiang Guosheng. After his exploration and guiding from Geezer Shi, he finally succeeded in the use. Today, he would give Wei Shengtian a “surprise.”</p><p>Wei Shengtian suddenly felt that his body seemed to be severely hit by one side. He was about to lose the center of gravity and fall to leave.</p><p>He put down his gravity center. The spine was like the dragon creeping. Feet were like nails, tightly tied in place The upper body swung with the potential to the side of the flash, and then back like a spring. He twisted waist to use punches, fast and ruthlessly collapsing to the lower abdomen of Lou Cheng.</p><p>All of a sudden, he broke Swing Force, filling the dignity of the territory of Dan stage!</p><p>Of course, this was also because it was the beginning of Lou Cheng and the body was at a disadvantage. He had long been psychologically prepared. In his mind, he visualized Brutal Blizzard. Borrowed from the other side of the rebound back of the power, he put down the gravity center, held down the feet. He then made his right hand clenched, closely pounded, and accurately hit Burst Fist of Wei Shengtian.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Among the dull sound, Lou Cheng’s body shook. He smartly walked back a few steps, like Lin Que, trying to pull away again.</p><p>He had worried that Wei Shengtian would use the big move to disrupt his rhythm, but only to find that Wei Shengtian’s body seemed to have stagnation, and actually stiffed in the original place.</p><p>The residual effect of “Meteor force”?</p><p>Declining physical condition?</p><p>Many thoughts flashed. Lou Cheng’s back foot suddenly forced to bring the body inertia changes, ferociously pre-flutter!</p><p>I’ll kill you while you’re sick!</p><p>A thunderbolt flashed in Lou Cheng’s mind. Silver Serpent Strike, shaking the snow peaks of ten thousand years, creating a white torrent which could swallow all. “They” went through the waist of the turnover, the feet of the top, the influx of the left arm, and pushed like a violent punch.</p><p>Just after hitting one punch, Lou Cheng saw Wei Shengtian was smiling, with his essence and his whole body strength received together and held into a human body big dan.</p><p>With Big Dan boomed, Wei Shengtian’s muscles were bulging and his martial arts suit turned into skin-tight clothes. Dark black skin tightened like a stone’s surface, Wei Shengtian seemed to have turned into a tall and mighty giant spirit statue, with some visible traces appearing below the foot.</p><p>He clenched his right fist, and suddenly hit the horizontal pound. His cohesion of strength and momentum seemed to find the only hole to vent, which promoted his crazy attack, frying along with the air.</p><p>Lou Cheng dwindled his sight, he understood that he was cheated by Wei Shengtian!</p><p>As an expert of Dan stage, he even had to play a trick, deliberately pretending to consume to a certain extent and his body appearing some troubles!</p><p>Although despicable, I have to admit that he was very accurate at grasping his own mentality, and knew that I was waiting for this opportunity.</p><p>In match against, there’s no despicable but only outcome.</p><p>The winner has justice!</p><p>Striking his own attack, Lou Cheng could not stop temporarily, otherwise the result would be even more terrible. Sometimes when two parties seemed to be stalemated with legs against legs, they were subject only to some bruises. When either party might emerge with fear, become less determined and showed the retreating force, he would end up with broken bones.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The two did not change strokes, and stroke together. Lou Cheng felt his fist painful and bones cracked. He did not dare to resist under the fear of breaking the arm. He could only choose homeopathic by that majestic vigorously lift, severely thrown not far away.</p><p>Bam! He had just fallen to the ground, Wei Shengtian had been rushing to step, not giving him any chance to adjust the recovery.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Yan Zheke’s clenched fist loosed. Martial Arts Club of Songcheng University all made a sigh.</p><p>The results would soon appear. Lou Cheng failed, and Wei Shengtian won. Two strong fighters of Professional Ninth Pin failed to defeat an expert of Eighth Pin in Dan stage by the wheel war!</p><p>The audience immediately burst into cheers, full of catharsis cheers!</p><p>Shadows shrouded the body, Lou Cheng knew that he was about to lose, but he did not give up any struggle and had the idea of admitting failure. Just like life and death, who would give up like that?</p><p>Not to shed a tear until one sees the coffin; refuse to be convinced until one is faced with grim reality!</p><p>He adjusted the muscles and fast rolled back, but the speed of the body tumbling couldn’t match Wei Shengtian’s steps into the attack. Seeing he was about to get caught, he soon would encounter a leg.</p><p>At this point, Lou Cheng seemed to step on a stone.</p><p>Suddenly, an idea flashed. His left hand grasped the ground a grasp, facing Wei Shengtian.</p><p>A full hand of small stones came out, right straight to his face!</p><p>He did not have time to force the ground, but here was Lin Que and Wei Shengtian’s final collision position. The ground had long been broken and split!</p><p>Sometimes life really needs a little luck.</p><p>This is also considered Lin Que’s “victories”!</p><p>Flying stone hit face, don’t believe the hype, Wei Shengtian seemed to go back to the previous fighting years as a small bully. But he did not dare not to escape and block. Because under Lou Cheng’s force, those flying stones would penetrate the eyelids and make him blind.</p><p>Was it worth for the preliminaries?</p><p>Wei Shengtian instinctively stopped. He lifted his left hand, blocking in front of his face to block the flying gravel.</p><p>Grasping this opportunity, Lou Cheng moved forward in no hurry to play Carp Jumping Moves, but familiarly used Rocket-like Punch to straight between the opponent’s legs!</p><p>Wei Shengtian was experienced. He had long been prepared, sinking his body and pressing his right hand quickly, like a hammer hitting down.</p><p>Bang! Just a collision, Lou Cheng leveraged waist, coming up. While Wei Shengtian coldly smiled, with his left arm already hanging down, Burst Fist hitting out.</p><p>Waiting long for you trying to stand straight!</p><p>However, Lou Cheng didn’t try, he directly jumped up. His body horizontally stretched. He dangerously escaped from the fist coming to his lower abdomen. And then White Crane Wing Spreading, his hands tapping, hit to Wei Shengtian’s Temple.</p><p>Wei Shengtian took a breath, the strength of a “close”. His arms quickly pulled back, blocking at his head.</p><p>Hands clapping with the sound muffled, Lou Cheng changed his move from hitting to pressing, to leverage over Wei Shengtian’s head, with his body fell to Wei Shengtian’s back.</p><p>Just when Lou Cheng hit the ground, he bounced his back and pedaled a few big steps forward. Once again he avoided Wei Shengtian’s reflexive leg, and homeopathically swiveled at the force of the feet and balanced the situation!</p><p>This change was completely beyond the presence of the vast majority. So they stared and only inertially cried with the voice gradually weakened.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s hands lifted, virtually clutching her face, surprised and delighted. She could not believe this.</p><p>At that time, Geezer Shi coughed a little. “This little bastard has a little crazy thing…”</p><p>His words awakened the other members of Songcheng University Martial Arts Club, and they issued a cry loudly:</p><p>“Good job!”</p><p>At the same time, the audience came to realize the situation and got sober while angry. They burst out a tsunami-like abuse, for Lou Cheng’s shameless Blowing Sand into the Eyes and Crotch-grasping Movement.</p><p>“Asshole!”</p><p>“F*ck you!”</p><p>“You attack behind him!”</p><p>For their roar, Lou Cheng automatically filtered. Only Wei Shengtian was in his eyes.</p><p>This time, he did not block, but directly marching footwork, ferociously rushed past. Because in the next two or three hands, he “listen” to the opponent’s body of disharmony, and he really felt Wei Shengtian’s hidden weakness!</p><p>Wei Shengtian had fought to this far with his force out broken for so many times and had encountered Lin Que’s “Meteor force”, it was normal for him to get affected. Otherwise, Lou Cheng would doubt that he had entered the Inhuman Stage of Dan, which was of professional fourth or fifth Pin level!</p><p>The Jindan (the Golden Elixir) in Lou Cheng’s body was expanding, contracting, and then slowly turning. It separated the ice and heat flow, healing his whole body, so that his physical strength could maintain the best state, so was power!</p><p>In the face of the counterattack of Lou Cheng, Wei Shengtian’s face was as deep as water. He didn’t show timid, with back force, using the same flutter to give a positive hit!</p><p>Click! The two sides had just got close, Lou Cheng stepped and split a brick. Avalanche-like violent forces rebounding with his spine peristalsis, he created a record of Downward Cut with Fist.</p><p>Pam! The ground cracked at the feet of Wei Shengtian. His right arm opened, the giant hammer side stroke!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the sound of the collision, Lou Cheng’s body shook, and later he used a step back. But this time, he was clearly aware that the power of Wei Shengtian much weaker than the beginning!</p><p>He trampled on the ground and rebounded forward with a suddenly strong force, to strike the Seabed Blast and hit straightforward to Wei Shengtian’s abdomen.</p><p>24 Blizzard Strikes!</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Wei Shengtian didn’t lose a half step. The two in the square continuously did some collisions. In the beginning, Lou Cheng felt it difficult to rely on the withdrawal of small skills to barely support. He felt like a wrought iron which was constantly compressed and quite hard. The body had a similar internal shock experience.</p><p>But consisted for a minute later with a shaky body, he slowly pulled back, because the opponent’s power was really weakened!</p><p>All of the audience did not notice this, only to see Wei Shengtian suppressed Lou Cheng by Disorder Double Pounds and Wind Chasing Rapid Strike. It seemed that he was able to win at any time. So once again there broke out the cry. Firstly the audience roared,</p><p>“Yimo!”</p><p>Then they answered themselves,</p><p>“Invincible Wei!”</p><p>“The Yimo Invincible Wei!”</p><p>Under the momentum of the horrible home court, Lou Cheng felt that Wei Shengtian suppressed him to a certain extent. The muscles and fascias were in the external force of the “hit” under the passive taut, and passively got “close” and “pressure”.</p><p>“This…” His eyes squinted. Following this feeling, his mind immediately visualized thunder clouds all over and the picture and sound of thunder shaking.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>There seemed to have the sound of thunderbolt inside Lou Cheng’s body. Lou Cheng crashed out his right fist suddenly, just when he contacted Wei Shengtian’s Hammer of Repulse, his taut muscle fascia opened up, like lighting the gunpowder.</p><p>Thunder Roar Zen!</p><p>Passive Thunder Roar Zen!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Wei Shengtian felt himself like an ancient clock which was severely knocked. The body surface suffered forceful burst of “fluctuations” and “buzzing”, which led to a shock of the bone marrow blood, muscle and fascia shock, turning over the uncomfortable internal organs once again.</p><p>He almost spat out old blood. The body was stiff there, and the audience was still calling “Invincible Wei”!</p><p>Stirring residual effects inside the body of his opponent with one successful strike, Lou Cheng immediately moved forward desperately and snuggled up with the crazy avalanche force.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>This time, Wei Shengtian was difficult to shrink the whole body momentum to deal with. He could only barely set up his arms blocked, and got a hard hit by Lou Cheng!</p><p>Lou Cheng’s eyes was deep into the water and the water turned to ice. Not the slightest mood swings, slightly rebound, and then he hit again.</p><p>Bam! He seemed to hit the stone. Wei Shengtian stumbled back.</p><p>A chance can’t be lost for two times. Lou Cheng stepped to catch up. He took the enemy’s left arm, pulled back, and hit sideways!</p><p>He did not burst out of the full, but with Delicate Force. Suddenly Wei Shengtian flew out, flying to the edge of the ring not far away.</p><p>“Yimo!”</p><p>“Invincible Wei!”</p><p>The audience looked at Wei Shengtian falling down inch by inch, like watching the film’s slow motion. The sound gradually stopped.</p><p>Pong!</p><p>Wei Shengtian hit the ground, the audience went silent.</p><p>The referee raised his right hand and announced loudly,</p><p>“Second Round. Lou Cheng wins!”</p><p>Hearing this sentence, Lou Cheng breathed out. All sorts of emotion in heart crashed out. He looked back at Songcheng University Martial Arts Club, looking at Yan Zheke, clenched fists, and suddenly waved up.</p><p>I won!</p><p>I did it!</p><p>Yan Zheke jumped up from the seat, using the same fist cheering.</p><p>After venting the tension and pressure of the battle, Lou Cheng recalled just now. Suddenly he put up the index finger, putting it in front of the mouth, and looked around the audience in a circle proudly and slowly.</p><p>Shut up!</p><p>Shut up you all!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
