Gao Rao fended off blow after blow from Sun Jian. The longer they fought, the more ferocious his opponent became.</p><p>He had watched the match videos of the members from Songcheng University Martial Arts Club, and he knew how terrifying the 24 Blizzard Strikes was once it was put into play. He had made preparations against it and considered how to avoid letting the enemy use his own strength against him. However, he was thrown into confusion due to his earlier passive response and now sought only to defend himself. He did not have the ability to unleash any explosive force at all.</p><p>Meanwhile, Sun Jian’s 24 Blizzard Strikes had been revealed. Every punch was heavier, and every kick was more ferocious than the last. His strength had fallen below Sun Jian, and he could only focus on defending himself. This way, he no longer had the opportunity to execute abrupt explosive force or engage in a hand-to-hand fight.</p><p>If only Jiuyang Punch was a bit better and had moves that contained the explosive power of the Modern Blast Punch, or the irrational and violent moves of the Bear Form, then Gao Rao could at least challenge Sun Jian head on and directly interrupt Sun Jian’s storm-like suppression. Unfortunately, the greatest feature of the Jiuyang Punch was that it had no feature at all. It had all kinds of moves including single whips, blast punches, and leg techniques. It had everything except the vital finishing move that would make it an amazing martial art!</p><p><em>“Must I keep waiting until his stamina is exhausted… I’m afraid that I won’t be able to hold out much longer…”</em> Faced with Sun Jian’s Seabed Blast and Half-step Burst Fist, Gao Rao was worried and could no longer wait to escape from the current situation.</p><p><em>If I lost again, then I would be ashamed to see my big senior brother, to see the one who refuses to join other forces in order to maintain the prestige of our martial arts club, to see the one who is unwilling to be the disciple of the fighters of Dan stage in order to maintain the relationship with his master, and to see the one who always helps us and never complain! This is my great senior brother!</em></p><p><em>Even in my dreams, I want to help him!</em></p><p><em>I can’t drag him down again!</em></p><p>Feeling the burning desire and the impulse to overcome the present dilemma within his heart, he could no longer wait. He strengthened his back and thigh, and then his feet suddenly pushed against the ground.</p><p>Once the power rebounded, he flexed his knee, tightened his thigh, straightened his spine and twisted his waist using his full power. It helped him to activate his muscles so that his right arm could hit out suddenly like a ferocious and strong whistling steel whip.</p><p>This might be the strongest blow that he could produce!</p><p>Sun Jian took the opportunity to bend his back and move forward, mixed with borrowed power, and then he unleashed a Mountain Blast Punch with great effect.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A dull boom erupted on the ring. Gao Rao who was weaker shook a bit and finally managed to stay upright. However, at this time, he saw Sun Jian moving back half a step. It looked like he was staggering and was about to fall over!</p><p><em>Is he only pretending to be stronger, although he has already lost his balance?</em></p><p>Gao Rao felt so glad when he saw that. But just as he was going to stabilize his stance and begin to fight back, he saw that Sun Jian had rebounded forward like a spring bouncing off the ground!</p><p>He was so fast that Gao Rao only had time to raise his arms to defend.</p><p>That was the Catapulting Movement!</p><p>As Sun Jian approached Gao Rao, he opened his right hand with fingers like sharp teeth and ferocious claws while scratching his enemy’s arm mercilessly.</p><p>Gao Rao was planning to twist his arm to throw off the attack but Sun Jian stepped on the ground, rebounded in a flash and moved behind him. He took the chance to turn around and caught Gao Rao’s arms with both hands.</p><p>With a twist, a lift and a lock, Sun Jian caught Gao Rao. At the same time, he raised his right foot to kick his knee which abruptly stopped his enemy’s back kick so that his enemy couldn’t fight back. Gao Rao could no longer stand, and he knelt down on one knee.</p><p>Gao Rao suddenly sobered up and understood that he had been tricked by Sun Jian.</p><p>The referee next to him raised his own right hand and announced the result loudly,</p><p>“Round one, Sun Jian wins!”</p><p>There was a buzzing sound within Gao Rao’s mind. His heart was full of regret and bewilderment.</p><p><em>Have I lost?</em></p><p><em>Did I lose again?</em></p><p><em>Did I drag Elder Senior Brother down again?</em></p><p>After Sun Jian released him, he staggered as he stood up and left the ring soullessly.</p><p><em>Sure, this is not an anime. Even if you have the will and the faith to win it does not mean that you can definitely obtain the victory…</em></p><p><em>It does not mean that if you recalled memories of past or cheered for yourself within your mind that you can beat the super enemy…</em></p><p>Sun Jian showed no interest in the emotions and the thoughts of his opponent. His whole body was filled with happiness and pride that his trap actually worked.</p><p>The taste of victory was really good, and so was the feeling of unleashing ferocious blows!</p><p>He turned around and raised his fist to both the members of Songcheng University martial arts club and the audience in the stands.</p><p>Lou Cheng and other members all clapped and laughed while the audience responded with a warm cheer,</p><p>“Sun Jian!”</p><p>Gao Rao walked back to where the guest team sat and he couldn’t even raise his head because he was ashamed to face Elder Senior Brother and the other junior brothers and sisters.</p><p>“At first you were too nervous while later you were too impatient.” Peng Chengguang wasn’t disappointed or angry, and he simply commented on the fight. “When you go home, you should think it over. As long as you understand and absorbed the fighting experience in this preliminary then hopefully you will grow further.”</p><p>Listening to the comfort and encouragement of his Elder Senior Brother and feeling his brother’s relaxed attitude towards his failure, Gao Rao felt even more upset. He wanted to be severely criticized or punished by his Elder Senior Brother. It seemed only through this would he feel better and be able to relieve some of the guilt and self-blame in his heart.</p><p><em>“Elder Senior Brother, I’m not a kid!”</em> He wanted to roar.</p><p>Peng Chengguang looked at Zhang Ying who stood beside him and whispered to her, “You have to take the initiative. Don’t let him interrupt your rhythm and never give him chance to fight with you hand-to-hand. What’s more, you have to keep cool and be patient because your enemy is brilliant and is good at setting traps.”</p><p>Zhang Ying nodded and kept the words of Elder Senior Brother in mind. Then she turned and walked into the ring with her eyes staring at Sun Jian.</p><p><em>Well, to sum up, he is a polished scoundrel.</em></p><p>Zhang Ying tied up her hair to a ponytail which always swayed back and forth, and with her born baby face, she looked like a high school student. When she stood in front of Sun Jian, she took a deep breath and told herself to stay calm.</p><p>“Round Two. Start!” The referee did not give them an opportunity to mentally prepare.</p><p>Gao Rao was a fighter of Amateur First Pin, so it seemed that Sun Jian defeated him easily, but in fact it wasn’t. If at the beginning of the batlle, he had not suppressed his opponent and took the opportunity to use the 24 Blizzard Strikes, it would have been difficult to tell to whom the victory would go.”</p><p>And experiencing such a fierce battle and using the 24 Blizzard Strikes would have consumed much of his stamina. It was obvious that Sun Jian’s condition wasn’t good. All he had in mind now was to force his opponent to fight with him directly so that he could create opportunities for the next fighter, Li Mao.</p><p>Bang! As soon as he heard “start”, he stepped forward to attack. His right arm straightened like a long spear with great power and hit towards Zhang Ying.</p><p>Zhang Ying had been prepared for his attack, so she dodged his right foot and flashed to the other side because she was trying to play it safe.</p><p>When she came to the side of her opponent, her muscles in her thigh stretched which extended her knee to kick a “whip kick” which could even make a sound like wind.</p><p>Sun Jian took a breath, while twisting his back and tightening the muscles in his leg, he side kicked with his left leg ferociously.</p><p>Bang! After the collision, Zhang Ying changed her position using the rebound with her toes lightly touching the ground. Then she once again started to attack and took control of the rhythm.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! They continuously fought with each other and sometimes they would also separate. Zhang Ying never gave Sun Jian the opportunity to use 24 Blizzard Strikes and fight hand-to-hand. She used to hit and run tactics as she hit him but stayed away.</p><p>After the continuous collisions, she found an opportunity. She blocked and pulled with her left hand before punching with her right fist at once.</p><p>Bang! Sun Jian right hand hit like a hammer which went straightly down and was just to block the punch. His body was shaken after this round of attack.</p><p><em>“Has he lost all his power already? Has his strength already decreased to this level?”</em> Zhang Ying wanted to take advantage of this chance to attack him ferociously. But she recalled what Elder Senior Brother had said to her.</p><p><em>Keep cool, do not worry!</em></p><p>Zhang Ying kept calm and then she twisted her back slightly. She stepped forward and closed in once again. At that time, she saw that he moved forward ferociously with the rebounding power and that this attack was as strong as when he was filled with power.</p><p><em>“Oh, he is really treacherous!</em> <em>I was almost fooled by him!”</em> Zhang Ying felt a little angry, so she caught up with him quickly, raised her right hand, stabilized her waist and hip, and she was going to take the opportunity to hit him with a downward cut.</p><p>At the same time, Sun Jian stepped down and jumped out of the ring.</p><p><em>He jumped out of the ring…</em></p><p><em>Jumped out of the ring!</em></p><p>Zhang Ying looked at Sun Jian in confusion and she suspected that he was bewildered after too many battles.</p><p>As Sun Jian stood firmly, he quickly pulled at his hair and praised his own intelligence.</p><p><em>When my attack which had been prepared for so long time missed my enemy, I knew that I couldn’t fight anymore and I had reached my limits. So once my opponent attacks me once more then I would definitely lose the fight.</em></p><p><em>Since in the end, I will lose, why should I just stand there to be hit by my opponent, knocked by her or even injured by her? Why should I make myself look pitiful like a drowned rat?</em></p><p><em>I have to keep up my reputation and appearance before the audience!</em></p><p>Sun Jian wiped his hair, walking towards his own seat briskly.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Li Mao suddenly stood up and moved towards the ring.</p><p>Because he didn’t look as nervous as the two previous battles, his body was not as rigid as before. Lou Cheng and the other members did not say anything so that they would not put any more pressure on him.</p><p>“Take your time and waste all her energy, sh will definitely lose.” Sun Jian held his fist and said to Li Mao with a laugh as he was going to meet Li Mao.</p><p>This time, Li Mao felt only a little nervous but did not lose his ability to think. After he heard what Sun Jian had said, he nodded and pounded his fist with his.</p><p>As he walked up along the stone steps, he gently breathed and adjusted his slightly tensed body.</p><p><em>Just like what Cheng and other members said, as long as I take away the burdens then my anxiety will decrease with increasing combat experience. It isn’t a problem that I cannot overcome…</em></p><p><em>My body is still a bit tense, so if I defend passively, it would be easy to go wrong. I better take the initiative to attack first and once I get through the hard beginning then I can really enter into a good fighting state…</em></p><p>Li Mao meditated “attack first” and then he came to the front of Zhang Ying.</p><p>Compared with the past, he was quite satisfied with his current state, at least his head was not blanked out.</p><p>On the other side, Zhang Ying was trying to use the time to recover her stamina. Because she had also consumed a lot enemy during the battle with Sun Jian.</p><p>She felt relieved after she had won a round, and now she could analyze the opponent’s situation calmly.</p><p><em>My opponent is a fighter, called Li Mao. He is always very nervous. Although his symptoms certainly won’t be so serious after the last combat since he has beaten Feng Shaokun, I still have</em> a chance <em>to beat him because Rome is not built in one day.</em></p><p><em>I’ll attack him first and let him feel worried at the beginning of this match!</em></p><p>“Round Three. Start!” The referee waved his arm.</p><p>As soon as the referee announced, Li Mao used his power and stepped forward by instinct. Zhang Ying pushed with her knees and moved forward ferociously. So these two fighters suddenly were close together. There was a burst of exclamation from the audience.</p><p>Neither of them could retreat and dodge the attacks given such a close distance. It would be too late!</p><p>Both of their pupils constricted. They clenched their teeth, twisted their waists and punched a fist towards the other party in a flash with their instincts as fighters.</p><p><em>Meeting on a narrow path means who dares wins!</em></p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
