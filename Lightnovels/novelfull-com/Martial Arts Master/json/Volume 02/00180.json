He wondered when there would be an emotional outbreak among them.</p><p>Turning his gaze back to the ring, he saw Yan Zheke finally creating an attacking opportunity for herself by pulling back her center of gravity twice in a row. She borrowed energy from her enemy and unleashed 24 Blizzard Strikes, fully suppressing Zhang Hengwang with Mega Avalanche.</p><p>Zhang Hengwang attempted to interrupt Yan Zheke twice, but each time his force would be cleverly dispersed by the girl using a partial technique from Yin-yang Twist. He could only watch helplessly as Mega Avalanche grew fiercer and more terrible, ultimately ending with a domineering force that blew apart its opponent’s stance.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Yan Zheke visualized meteors crashing into the earth and combined all of the energy she had borrowed earlier with her own. Then, she turned sideways and shouldered Zhang Hengwang directly out of the ring. If she hadn’t withdrawn her strength at the last second, the simple movement would have broken at least a few of her opponent’s ribs.</p><p>“Yan Zheke wins!” announced the referee, who withdrew his hand after nearly interfering to stop the match at a critical moment.</p><p>Yan Zheke exhaled and found herself worn out. Her leg muscles were shaking somewhat involuntarily.</p><p>It was a hard battle. Though Zhang Hengwang had been at an unfavorable position from the beginning, he was tight in defense due to abundant experience and extraordinary strength, and could even attack back occasionally. When facing Yan Zheke’s final attack with Mega Avalanche, he even got through one round of it before being defeated, which showed his persistence and thus cost the girl much energy.</p><p>While Zhang Hengwang was about to stand up with hand clenching his breast, intending to speak with the girl, Yan Zheke turned her gaze at the stand and caught Lou Cheng’s eyes, and a big smile appeared on her face.</p><p>Anyway, she had advanced in group competition, and there was only one match remained on her road to Amateur Second Pin.</p><p>Getting back her cell phone, Yan Zheke turned to walk upwards along the aisle. She’d only gone a few paces before she felt a sudden tightening and tremble in her leg muscles, which weakened her knees and almost let her collapse.</p><p>Before she could think about the situation, she saw Lou Cheng directly jump down from the top of the stand in eagle-pouncing movement, and then point his toes to change direction halfway and fly towards her. The whole process was breathtaking as combining the beauty of energy outbreak and charming martial arts skills together.</p><p>“Are you all right?” Lou Cheng steadied the girl and asked with concern.</p><p>Yan Zheke was stunned with a blank look until her boyfriend steadied her body. A beautiful smile gradually appeared on the girl’s face as she looked to the side to hide her joy and pride. “Nothing serious, it took me too much energy. But you scared me! You just appeared in the blink of an eye!” She complained deliberately.</p><p>“I saw you almost lose your balance.” Looking around, Lou Cheng found that quite a few people had noticed his magnificent feat and were now making gestures to show their admiration to him.</p><p>In their eyes, the guy was risking his life to save the beauty!</p><p>Just a piece of cake! Lou Cheng smiled proudly and suggested the girl, “Let’s go back to the hotel for physiotherapy and recovery without waiting for them, since you still have an important fight this afternoon. Get through the last match and you’ll get relaxed!”</p><p>“Okay.” Knowing it was the best choice, Yan Zheke nodded without hesitation.</p><p>When she was about to move with the support of Lou Cheng, she saw the latter crouch down, pat his shoulder and said,</p><p>“Come on, I’ll carry you!”</p><p>Yan Zheke had intended to refuse him but finally swallow her words down since her muscles were still tightening and her boyfriend was determined. Rolling her eyes to look around in embarrassment, she lowered her head and let the hair down to cover her cheeks.</p><p>“You can’t see me, you can’t see me…” She murmured and leaned over Lou Cheng’s back, supporting herself with elbows to avoid further physical contact.</p><p>Knowing the girl was shy, Lou Cheng kept chatting with her to divert her attention.</p><p>“I met Qian Ruoyu just now, and she invited me to do a part-time job in her family’s martial arts club this summer break.”</p><p>Yan Zheke was suddenly attracted as she forced a smile at the back of Lou Cheng’s head and asked, “Do you want to go?”</p><p>“Isn’t it up to you?” Lou Cheng took the opportunity to ask her, “Ke, are you going back to Xiushan this summer?”</p><p>“Of course. I’m feeling a little homesick!” Yan Zheke’s tone turned brisk as she knew Lou Cheng’s decision. “I’ll spend at most two weeks to visit my grandpa.”</p><p>“Since you’re going back to Xiushan, why should I stay at Songcheng like an idiot?” While carrying the girl, Lou Cheng kept walking fast and soon left No.2 hall.</p><p>Yan Zheke asked as if something occurred to her, “Cheng, you’ll keep all the martial arts movements in your body and bones this summer, won’t you?”</p><p>In other words, he would reach the peak of body refining state!</p><p>“I don’t have to wait until summer break.” Lou Cheng simply replied with confidence, and then began detailing his plan to the girl. “I’ve been thinking, since the remaining ten thousand yuan was not enough for me to enter Danqi State, I’ll enter for some minor Challenge Tournament to get the bonus, or find a part-time job in martial arts club with my classmates’ help…”</p><p>Realizing that Lou Cheng had already made arrangement and preparation for their summer break, Yan Zheke bit her lower lip to hide the smile yet her tender look still gave her out. At the same time, she unconsciously relaxed her arms, which were originally supporting her, and twined them around Lou Cheng.</p><p>Noticing the girl’s action. Lou Cheng felt his heart thumping wildly as the girl’s breast touched his back.</p><p>It was in the warm spring and Lou Cheng was wearing thin clothes because he was more energetic than ordinary people and thus easier to get his blood boiling. On the other hand, Yan Zheke had just finished a match and hadn’t put on her pink white jacket yet.</p><p>Praying silently to calm himself down, Lou Cheng tried hard to divert attention to something more important as before.</p><p>Ke had won four matches in the past one and a half day, which made her tire out. Now she was in need of a physio to restored at least 70 to 80 percent of her stamina…</p><p>As for the coming summer break, he didn’t know whether his special training would stop during the International Labour Day for them to take a break… Since Little Ming’s girlfriend would come to visit Songcheng, should he also go for a travel with Ke to surround tourist spots…</p><p>While thinking about all the bits and pieces, he kept chatting with Yan Zheke and finally made it to the hotel.</p><p>Having learned from past experience, this time Yan Zheke went for shower in the room of Guo Qing and her, leaving Cheng alone outside to wash his face and cool himself down. The poor boy was still reciting some tongue twisters to move attention from his physiological reaction.</p><p>Maybe it was because he had behaved well yesterday and was able to control himself at the critical moment, today Yan Zheke trusted him more. Though still being bashful, the girl directly lay down on the bed and was willing to change her posture as Lou Cheng kneaded different parts of her body.</p><p>Looking at her fine body lines and curves, Lou Cheng raised head to force his eyes away, finding that tongue twisters could no longer cool him down.</p><p>“Cheng, what’re you doing?” Yan Zheke was laying her back against the pillowing.</p><p>Lou Cheng gave a wry smile.</p><p>“I’m reciting the Buddhist sutra. The form itself is emptiness, emptiness itself is the form…”</p><p>It took Yan Zheke great effort to stifle her laughter, and yet her body was still trembling.</p><p>“Continue reciting it, and I trust you!”</p><p>“But I don’t trust myself…” Lou Cheng cried piteously to himself as he exhaled and visualized thundercloud in his mind while tightening his muscles, and then he began kneading the girl’s leg muscles with Tremor force!</p><p>He had found the new function of Thunder Roar Zen after the massage yesterday: control the kneading strength to lessen muscles ache in deeper layers!</p><p>Yan Zheke suddenly felt it and asked in surprise,</p><p>“Cheng, what kneading method is it?”</p><p>It was so strange!</p><p>“A normal method derived from Tremor Force. What do you feel about it?” Lou Cheng asked proudly.</p><p>“Thunder Roar Zen was originally a kind of kungfu used to build one’s bones and viscera!”</p><p>But he still had a strange feeling as turning a powerful kungfu into kneading method. Would his master give him a sound beating if knowing this?</p><p>“Tremor force?” Yan Zheke unconsciously opened her mouth to show the snowy teeth with a blank look.</p><p>Is it the Tremor force I know that can defeat most of the Professional-Ninth-Pin fighters?</p><p>Does he use it for massage?</p><p>Cheng is so creative!</p><p>Why do I feel so happy…</p><p>“Yeah, what’s your feeling now?” Lou Cheng continued to ask her in order to determine the proper massage strength.</p><p>Yan Zheke curved her lips and eyebrows, smiling.</p><p>“Just be a little lighter.”</p><p>Or the other parts of her body instead of the muscles would be affected.</p><p>Devoting himself into controlling the kneading strength, Lou Cheng naturally stopped filling his head with nonsense. However, when he switched back the normal kneading method to restore his mental power, he saw Yan Zheke fall into sleep, which again induced his physiological reaction. As a result, he went to the bathroom to cool himself down three times during the whole process.</p><p>When Yan Zheke woke up, she saw Lou Cheng was still busying kneading her muscles, which warmed her heart and softened her voice. “Cheng, are you tired?”</p><p>He looked so tired…</p><p>Tremor force was an energy-guzzling kungfu…</p><p>“Nothing serious,” Lou Cheng struggled to say, “How about you? How much stamina have you restored?”</p><p>Yan Zheke got out of bed and slowly warmed herself up with a series of exercise action. Then she said in a pleasant surprise,</p><p>“I’ve gotten back to nearly the same physical state as this morning!”</p><p>“All right! I’ll go for some food and you shall lie back on the bed.” Lou Cheng felt all his effort paid off when he saw the girl’s happy face, and then they only need to wait for Yan Zheke’s body to recover itself.</p><p>Watching her boyfriend rush out of the door, Yan Zheke lay back against the pillows and smiled with shining eyes.</p><p>…</p><p>At one o’clock they returned to the arena and got the result of drawing lots:</p><p>Yan Zheke vs He Lingling!</p><p>Though being exhausted due to mental power overuse, Lou Cheng supported himself with spirit and began searching for He Lingling’s information.</p><p>“She seems to be a little stronger than your opponent this morning.” He sized up the situation quickly while studying the relevant documents.</p><p>Yan Zheke, who was also searching with her cell phone, slightly nodded. “Since she majors in Dragon Style, she is good at catching and has built a strong and flexible backbone.”</p><p>“Do not leave her any chance to catch you, for dragon claw’s movements were mainly tearing and tugging and you’ll easily get injured…” Lou Cheng began discussing with the girl.</p><p>After a long while, when Yan Zheke got a basic understanding of He Lingling’s fighting style, she sighed and told Lou Cheng, “Qing told me through QQ just now that though senior brother Sun Jian won his final match, he failed to advance in group competition.”</p><p>“Good luck is really important in Ranking Event. My fairy is always lucky because of good character!” Lou Cheng commented.</p><p>Yan Zheke gave him a big smile. “You are going to enter for the April’s Professional Ranking Event. What do you think about your luck? Shall I spare my good fortune with you?”</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed. “Coach Yan, may I brag?”</p><p>“Sure!” Yan Zheke’s eyes were blinking in curiosity.</p><p>“Regarding the current situation, I’m actually the standard for the other fighters to measure their luck.” Lou Cheng explained with a smile, “Those who’ll get me as their opponent are really unlucky!”</p><p>He was so proud and confident.</p><p>Since he had initially grasped Thunder Roar Zen and would master Frost Force by the end of April, it was impossible for him to fail the Ranking Event!</p><p>…</p><p>At 2:50 p.m., Yan Zheke appeared in the ring, where her last and the most crucial opponent in the Ranking Event was waiting for her.</p><p>Only if she won the match could all her previous effort make sense, or she had to start over again!</p><p>He Lingling was about Yan Zheke’s height with a serious look. She took a deep breath and smiled.</p><p>“I thought the match would be a little easier…”</p><p>“Anyone advanced from group competition is hard to handle.” Yan Zheke was not deluded by her compliment.</p><p>I won’t be careless and let you take advantage of it!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
