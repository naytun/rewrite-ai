Any Professional Ninth Pin fighter in their prime could have done the same thing. What was shocking was the ease at which Peng Chengguang took out Li Mao with plenty of energy to spare. It was awe-inspiring. The majority of the audience in the grandstand were casual viewers and did not fully understand the qualities of a professional. They were more stunned with the contrast between the previous and current match, and the effects of the one-shot kill.</p><p>Just moments ago Li Mao had battled against Zhang Ying like a clash between Mars and Earth before scoring a ferocious victory at the end of it. But now, he was taken out with a single move. It was only understandable that any person who didn’t understand the gap between those at low ranks would be temporarily dumbstruck and speechless given the outcome.</p><p>During the rare moment of silence between today’s matches, Lou Cheng exchanged a look with Yan Zheke and high-fived each other. He then walked towards the ring.</p><p>During this process, he saw Li Mao returning with a slightly dazed look on his face. He seemed to be stunned by the outcome. The surrounding cheers were scarce and there was an indescribable stifled atmosphere.</p><p>Under such circumstances, Lou Cheng vaguely felt as if he had already been overwhelmed in spirit by Peng Chengguang.</p><p>He hadn’t used his full strength and already won the match in a way that startled the audience. So how has it became like this?</p><p>In the Songcheng University Martial Arts Club’s seating area, Sun Jian and his friends also sensed the weird atmosphere which had arisen.</p><p>Yan Zheke, in her white martial arts suit trimmed in black thread, suddenly stood up and yelled in her soft voice.</p><p>“Come on, Lou Cheng!”</p><p>As her voice pierced the silence, Yan Zheke came to realize what she was doing and hurriedly sat down gracefully. Ignoring all the eyes looking on her, she acted as if nothing had happened.</p><p>“Come on, Lou Cheng!</p><p>Hearing the familiar voice imprinted in his mind, Lou Cheng looked back with a smile. He saw Yan Zheke sitting where she was as she gave him an innocent look with her beautiful blinking eyes. The girl clenched her fist and waved at him as if she was saying, “I’m quiet and well-behaved. That crazy woman was not me!”</p><p>While Lou Cheng was trying hard to keep a straight face, all the audience were gradually roused and began to cheer him on. Their voices were at first in a mess but soon became synchronized, finally turning into a roar echoing around the arena.</p><p>“Come on, Lou Cheng!”</p><p>At this moment, Lou Cheng felt as if he was the main character being escorted by the big crowd in front and behind while walking step by step towards the ring.</p><p>As he passed Li Mao, he nodded and stretched out a fist.</p><p>“Good job!”</p><p>Li Mao greeted him with a fist bump and sighed.</p><p>“I’m sure you can defeat him!”</p><p>After they brushed past each other, Lou Cheng calmly walked up the steps and then towards Peng Chengguang. While the crowd was still cheering, Lou Cheng stopped in from of his opponent.</p><p><em>I’ll enjoy myself in my home territory!</em></p><p>Leaving no chance for them to exchange any words, the referee raised his right hand and announced,</p><p>“Final Round. Start!”</p><p>Voice fading, Lou Cheng, who had already adjusted his physical condition, quickly changed his center of gravity to move in an arc and pounced on his opponent.</p><p>At the same time, Peng Chengguang’s leg muscles began bulging and wriggling as if they were alive, which accelerated him from a standing start to high speed as he rushing at Lou Cheng’s original position. It seemed that he had intended to attack Lou Cheng immediately and to prevent him from using mercurial balance.</p><p>After the dodge and dash, Lou Cheng approached Peng Chengguang’s flank. He slightly bent his body, pressed both feet on the ground and threw a Seabed Blast at Peng’s waist with a burst of strength.</p><p>Though the series of movements looked much like the fighting while roaming skill he had used in previous competitions with the help of mercurial balance, it was different from that.</p><p>It was not Seabed Blast but Seabed Shock!</p><p>When his opponent was still confused, Lou Cheng had already lowered the center of gravity in preparation for a full-strength strike!</p><p>Boom… Thunderclouds gathered in Lou Cheng’s mind while his muscles and tendons in arms and shoulders were tightened to their extreme.</p><p>Peng Chengguang had just balanced himself when Lou Cheng’s blow approached him. Having no time to do a side kick, he gathered strength in his shoulder and threw his right arm and fist towards Lou Cheng’s fist like a hammer.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The moment their fists collided, Lou Cheng blasted out his strength as if detonating a bomb.</p><p>The first blow of Thunder Roar Zen!</p><p>Boom! Peng Chengguang was shaken and felt as if he had stepped on a landmine. A violent shock traveled from his right fist and soon spread throughout his body, shaking his skin, muscles, tendons, and bones, boiling his blood and even impacting all his vital organs!</p><p><em>Tremor Punch?</em></p><p>Is Lou Cheng <em>able to master Tremor Punch?</em></p><p>Peng Chengguang felt so uncomfortable that he wanted to vomit while finding it difficult to gather strength, and soon realized he would immediately lose the game if he did nothing. Supporting himself with his spirit, he curled and then opened up his body, stomping violently on the ground.</p><p>Crack! Fissures appeared on the ground around his feet and soon formed a spider web. With the help of his resilience, Peng Chengguang’s muscles in his limbs and trunk all came to life and became like sinister flood dragons that exploded at the same time.</p><p>Without pausing, he twisted his back and waist to gather all his strength and then threw a fierce Swing Force at Lou Cheng!</p><p>Lou Cheng had just succeeded in attacking Peng Chengguang and was about to give him the decisive punch. Then suddenly he felt Peng Chengguang turn into an erupting volcano with tremendous power erupting from all over, which was the last thing he felt before being throwing away.</p><p><em>“What an incredible outbreak of strength…”</em> Lou Cheng began to get nervous and hurried to adjust his muscles. Though having already rebalanced himself with the first step on the ground, Lou Cheng didn’t stop but took two more steps, during which he kept gathering strength in preparation for greeting Peng Chengguang’s pursuit with a back thrust!</p><p>After turning around, Lou Cheng found Peng Chengguang standing where he was taking a deep breath instead of using the opportunity to pursue him.</p><p>Then he realized that Peng Chengguang might also be feeling uncomfortable because of his Thunder Roar Zen and had to calm down his boiling qi and blood.</p><p>Although he was eager to pursue Lou Cheng, he was unable to do so!</p><p>The moment their gazes caught, they yelled with one voice.</p><p>“Bravo!”</p><p>They were cheering for the excellent performances of each other!</p><p>On the stands, Cai Zongming, Qiu Zhigao, Zhao Qiang and the others had already arrived as a group of family and friends of Lou Cheng.</p><p>They were now tensely looking at the big screen and gasping at the collision just now.</p><p>In his previous strike, Lou Cheng directly attacked his opponent with Thunder Roar Zen, which seemed to be much gentler than Peng Chengguang’s movements in the audience’s eyes, while the latter had broken stone bricks, wriggled his muscles and blown his opponent away! Since none of Lou Cheng’s friends and families were professionals, they were all shocked by Peng Chengguang and began to worry for Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Talker, Cheng’s opponent seems to be quite powerful…” Zhang Jingye got nervous.</p><p>Cai Zongming was also worrying about Lou Cheng but tried to keep calm. “Is he more powerful than an Eighth Pin expert in Dan stage?”</p><p>“But it was Lin Que who made the first move last time…” Qiu Zhigao replied automatically.</p><p>Cai Zongming smiled. “Peng Chengguang’s not at Dan stage, either. Did his movements scare you? Cheng could easily do the same as him, such as breaking stone bricks! Besides, it is quite normal for a fighter to lose several Challenge Tournaments, even the Dragon King and Warrior Sage have once failed. There are so many martial arts competitions nowadays that no one can guarantee he will always meet someone only a little stronger than himself!”</p><p>Zhao Qiang knew little about martial arts and was thus convinced by Talker’s words, which sounded quite reasonable. <em>“So exciting!”</em> Zhao Qiang put his mind at ease and again looked at the ring.</p><p>Lou Cheng was again fighting hand to hand with Peng Chengguang. This time he still controlled his center of gravity with Mercurial Balance and flashed to the left side of his opponent. He decided to make a feint and trick Peng Chengguang into striking first, while he would dash to Peng’s back and take the opportunity to use Thunder Roar Zen.</p><p>Thinking about this, Lou Cheng shook the right arm as if getting ready to punch, while his center of gravity changed at the same time and helped him to flash to Peng Chengguang’s back like a ghost.</p><p>However, Peng Chengguang stood still without reacting to his movements as if he had already seen through Lou Cheng’s trick.</p><p>Not daring to pause, Lou Cheng moved his center of gravity and flashed to Peng Chengguang’s right side.</p><p>According to Peng Chengguang’s performance in the previous competitions he had seen on video, Lou Cheng knew that he tended to make an absolute reaction to any attack, an ability Lou Cheng lacked. As a result, Lou Cheng was unable to find any opportunity to throw Thunder Roar Zen at him despite feints and mercurial balance… While moving at high speed, Lou Cheng began to realize what a big mistake he had made.</p><p><em>Maybe I should think the opposite.</em></p><p><em>Since Peng Chengguang’s Absolute Reaction is not perfect, it might work if I combined a real attack with a feint.</em></p><p>Having no time to think it over, Lou Cheng took a breath and hid his spirit in the state of concealment of spirit and qi. Visualizing mountain ranges covered with pure white snow in his mind, Lou Cheng dismissed all distracting thoughts while focusing on the visual imagery.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Giant bolts shooting down from the sky, causing an avalanche with millions and billions of tons of snow flooding down from the mountain. Lou Cheng shook his right arm as if getting ready to release this almighty force.</p><p>At this very moment, his Mega Avalanche progressed both physically and spiritually!</p><p>As Lou Cheng was performing these movements, Peng Chengguang suddenly tightened his leg muscles, destroying his shabby martial arts shoes, and threw a quick and fierce side kick at Lou Cheng.</p><p>However, just when it seemed that Lou Cheng’s Mega Avalanche was about to be formed, he again moved his center of gravity and flashed to the back of Peng Chengguang.</p><p>Taking the opportunity as Peng Chengguang hadn’t withdrawn his side kick yet, Lou Cheng lowered his waist to do a squat and compressed his muscles in both arms and legs. After all this he clasped his hands to form a giant hammer and thumped Peng Chengguang from the top right downwards to the left.</p><p>This blow was as powerful and destructive as a double attack of Tremor Punch!</p><p>This blow was known as the regular killer move of Thunder Roar Zen, which was named Mountain Blast Punch!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
