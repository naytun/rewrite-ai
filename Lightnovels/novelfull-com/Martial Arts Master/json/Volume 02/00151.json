She did not expect that the Songcheng University Martial Arts Club had another secret weapon other than the injured Lin Que and Lou Cheng. Being able to enter into Solemn Silence was a secret weapon, so was being able to understand and know every detail of one’s own body!</p><p>This arrangement was exactly tailored for such a university division martial arts competition!</p><p>The good thing was that she had actual fight experience with other fighters. Though she was astonished, she was not flustered. While she was unable to retract her right fist, she immediately tightened the muscles on her right thigh. Bam! A side-kick delivered, fast and hard.</p><p>But, Yan Zheke did not stop there. She swiftly swung behind Qian Ruoyu, right at the moment where Qian Ruoyu retracted her right leg and was not able to put any strength to it.</p><p>Oh no! She does not look like she never had any actual fight experience?!</p><p>Facing Yan Zheke’s furious punches, Qian Ruoyu silently said to herself that things were not going too well. Her right kicks started to pick up speed, and her arm repeated swung forward and backward, pounding repeatedly. These moves made the upper body turn upside down. It helped her to avoid critical hits by leaning the body to one side. At the same time, her lower body was steady and held her firmly to the ground, with no imbalance.</p><p>Since her punches were not reaching her opponent, Yan Zheke decided to turn her fist into a palm strike, aiming for a lower height so that she could make Qian Ruoyu unstable.</p><p>However, at the same moment, Qian Ruoyu’s upper body was like a huge spring. She sprung back and forth, as fast as the attacks were coming, and her left arm was raised, ready to deliver an elbow strike anytime.</p><p>Yan Zheke lifted her left hand and blocked the elbow attack just in time. As the blow was rather strong, she did not dare to slack, she continued her palm strikes, trying to give strength after strength.</p><p>In the midst of electrifying lights and fire, with the blocked elbow attack, Qian Ruoyu swung her arm out with a bam, and her fist was aimed towards Yan Zheke’s abdomen.</p><p>Dense body pound! Stirring Yin Palm! Both are not a whole lot you can do about it!</p><p>Yan Zheke had watched countless videos of her rival. She was familiar with her rival’s moves. Though it was her first time in an actual fight, though she was not too nervous, her mind still seemed to be a little fuzzy. She was unable to accumulate or to think in a well-rounded manner. Just like the bait and the current pounding moves, she had not been able to execute a good response in time.</p><p>The good thing was that her choices were not all wrong. As her left palm pushed against Qian Ruoyu’s elbow, it drew a small arch, curving upwards. With a shake and matching the pressure on the right palm, she pushed her opponent forward by one step.</p><p>Pam!</p><p>The distance between the two opponents grew wider. Qian Ruoyu’s Dense Body Pound landed in the air. So she used the force that pushed her forward to take a few more steps away. Then, she turned, reverting the situation to how it is when they first started the competition.</p><p>Previous scenes flashed past Yan Zheke’s mind. She knew very well that she lacked the actual battle experience, and was in passive position. She has misjudged a few times, but luckily she was careful, or else she would have lost.</p><p>At the moment, she then understood why Lou Cheng suggested that she went all out, not reserve any energy, and made herself the main lead of the battle.</p><p>This was because only like that can a rookie best avoid mistakes.</p><p>It always pays to listen to “elders”…</p><p>Nonetheless, without experiencing it once herself, she would not be able to understand the penetrating insights of these words…</p><p>She took a gentle breath and felt herself entering competition state. Her mind was refreshed and alert, no longer nervous and slow.</p><p>Since she was enlightened, she would just need to heed Coach Lou’s advice!</p><p>She pounced forward. Within a few steps she was near her rival, and she started her attack.</p><p>Lou Cheng heaved a sigh of relief after seeing Yan Zheke escape the blow of the Dense Body Pound so narrowly. From her final neutralizing and countering tactics, he was sure that she had gotten used to fighting in a competition and no longer had the rawness of a rookie.</p><p>“With such an experience to not be defeated in the face of danger, the martial arts road for Ke will only be easier from now on,” Lou Cheng said to himself.</p><p>Similar to his experience, he was only enlightened after fighting with the Shaolin disciple, Wu Shitong, and using the Listening Skill.</p><p>The spectators started to applaud. Following the name list on the big screen, many started to cheer for Yan Zheke. None of them had thought that such a delicate and demure lady could have such a refreshing experience, such elegant moves and energy.</p><p>Amongst the shouts of “Go, Yan Zheke, Go”, Li Liantong, Shi Xiangyang and Zong Yanru were the loudest and most enthusiastic ones. Such atmosphere almost left one drunk, with no care for anything in the world. It was just them enjoying the moment, venting whatever emotions they were carrying, including happiness, pride, and even the negative emotions that they usually carried.</p><p>“How come everyone in Songcheng University Martial Arts Club can enter meditation state so easily?” Yu Qiao could not help but exclaim as his eyes followed the pretty silhouette greedily.</p><p>Members of the Dream Squad all had exceptional family backgrounds. However, till now, only Jiang Dingyi had entered the doors of the Solemn Silence.</p><p>For martial arts aristocratic families, skills such as Solemn Silence was not something that they could just train for anytime. If they were too young, although their mind was pure and sincere, they did not know anything. If they had tried to meditate, they would fall asleep. As they grew older, they would have more contact with the society and receive much more complex information. This would just make it harder to achieve the concealment of spirit and qi. Hence, the best age to train for Solemn Silence would be from 10 to 22 or 23 years old.</p><p>Amongst all these, there were intimate relations between the spirit and the body. The more passionate the qi and blood and the more spirited the person, the easier it would be to enter meditation. Records had shown that if fighters trained for Solemn Silence after they had developed physically and reached a certain level of energy for their qi and blood, they would only end up being mentally drained, slow in their mind, and weak in their knees. Without some innate talent, it seemed almost impossible to master the Solemn Silence.</p><p>Upon considering these, martial arts aristocratic families usually sent their children to train for Solemn Silence between the ages of 17, 18 to 22 years old. Some families were extreme. They demanded that their children’s physical development reached the level of Professional Ninth Pin before they could train. Jiang Dingyi, Feng Shaokun, and Qian Ruoyu all just started to train this recent two years.</p><p>Feng Shaokun responded in a worried tone. “Does the coach of Songcheng University have some secret teaching or way? Yan Zheke seems like she has already trained to some level for the Solemn Silence. Her full capability and potential shouldn’t be just this. If Ruoyu is careless and slips up, it’s going to be bad…”</p><p>Though the other girl was attractive, he still concerned and liked Qian Ruoyu the most.</p><p>“To find the talented few among the tens of thousands of Songcheng University students, to train for Solemn Silence, is not difficult at all…” Jiang Dingyi sighed.</p><p>Although his martial arts club had a few high-ranked Dan Stage fighters to hold the fort, to be able to pick someone good from a hundred was already a feat, especially since they were not some famous or very strong force to begin with.</p><p>In the ring, Yan Zheke moved in towards Qian Ruoyu. With a Seabed Burst Punch, she aimed straight for Qian Ruoyu’s abdomen.</p><p>In this process, she did a visualization. She mixed a little of the Meteor force with the fist, which made it move so fast that it made sounds when it cut through the air.</p><p>Her body had not reached the level where she could execute the actual full Meteor force.</p><p>Bam! Qian Ruoyu’s body dipped, and her left hand forcefully pounded downwards to block Yan Zheke’s Burst Fist.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>When the two exchanged blows, she decided to reattempt the same attack earlier. She led her rival’s fist to one side, and with a shake of her body, she retracted her fists, and borrowed the force. Her left hand sprung out towards Qian Ruoyu’s shoulder, fast and furious.</p><p>The Brutal Blizzard of 24 Blizzard Strikes!</p><p>Qian Ruoyu was not surprised, in fact she was glad and was waiting for this moment. With both legs arched inwards, a force was released from her lower back and her right shoulder moved forward.</p><p>She was just in contact with Yan Zheke’s palm. Right before her opponent managed to grab them, her shoulder suddenly tightened with a bounce followed by a shake immediately.</p><p>Yan Zheke’s left hand was thrown off and stopped in midair.</p><p>Jumping on the opportunity, Qian Ruoyu’s right arm quickly threw a move out. She tried to use the Tai Chi Hand Wrap to catch Yan Zheke’s palm.</p><p>When Jiang Dingyi and Feng Shaokun saw this scene, they immediately shouted a good job. They wished that they could run to the side of the ring to applaud. However, when they caught Lou Cheng smiling, they were enlightened and quickly shouted,</p><p>“Let go!”</p><p>At this moment, Qian Ruoyu could no longer hear any sounds outside the ring. Without much hesitation, she held her rival’s five fingers and twisted them down.</p><p>But, before she could release her force, it was like Yan Zheke had predicted her move. Yan Zheke’s left hand followed the direction of the hand twist, pulling their bodies closer to each other. Her right hand curled into a tight fist and went all the way out towards Qian Ruoyu’s abdomen.</p><p>Qian Ruoyu did not dare to slacken. She decided to stop trying her right hand, and started to focus her strength and energy to deliver a thunderous pound with her left fist.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>In the midst of the muffled cheers, Yan Zheke used some force from the Listening Skill. She lashed out her left hand. Subconsciously, Qian Ruoyu’s grip tightened and with the combined force of the two, she pulled her forward.</p><p>With this pull, Yan Zheke’s right thigh tightened, and her knee went right to Qian Ruoyu.</p><p>Pfft! Her knee hit Qian Ruoyu’s abdomen squarely, but she managed to hold back some force.</p><p>The referee took back his hands that signaled “stop”. He raised his right hand and announced,</p><p>“Round one, Yan Zheke wins!”</p><p>Yan Zheke retracted her right leg. She stood upright while being a little shaky sometimes.</p><p>This means I’ve won?</p><p>Even though she made so many wrong judgments earlier and put herself in a bad position, once she followed her boyfriend’s advice, she managed to turn the tables and score a victory so easily.</p><p>Qian Ruoyu really loved to use the Tai Chi Hand Wrap, and she also really loved to compete on Listening Skill…</p><p>Qian Ruoyu was going with the flow too much. Her reaction was too slow when she was thrown off guard by the sudden change…</p><p>And, this was completely what Cheng had predicted earlier…</p><p>As her thoughts flowed, she could not help but turn and look at Lou Cheng. She saw a boy smiling brightly, punching a fist in the air and giving a thumbs up.</p><p>“He has become someone who has seen enough and could differentiate the fighters.” This thought flashed through Yan Zheke’s mind. Her lips arched into a smile. She wrinkled her nose and made a face at Lou Cheng.</p><p>After she regained her senses, she started to become extremely excited about her first win. She could not wait to dash down the ring and celebrate with Lou Cheng.</p><p>It was the first time that a girl made a face to Lou Cheng. For that split moment, he was mesmerized. Spectator’s eyes were glued to the big screen and no one missed this scene. The cheers died down.</p><p>Qian Ruoyu rubbed her belly and straightened her body. It was difficult to read her expression.</p><p>She never thought that she would lose this quick, and lose this cleanly.</p><p>When she realized that her opponent could pull back the core and balance with force, she should have used her Solemn Silence skills to support the battle of the Listening Skills.</p><p>Qian Ruoyu said reluctantly</p><p>“I didn’t understand you and your abilities well enough. Just wait for it! I’ll beat you the next time! ”</p><p>After completing her sentence, she realized that Yan Zheke’s mind was completely somewhere else. Yan Zheke was not listening to her, and in fact she was exchanging questionable views with her “coach”, Lou Cheng.</p><p>So disrespectful! Qian Ruoyu snorted, turned and walked away. Feng Shaokun hurried forward to console her and gave her a pat on her back.</p><p>Yan Zheke turned back. Her brows relaxed and with a small laugh, she said,</p><p>“The next time, I’ll no longer be an amateur… ”</p><p>It was only after a moment later did the spectators start to realize what had just happened. Many started to cheer for her loudly. Loud cheers echoed throughout the martial arts arena.</p><p>“Yan Zheke! Yan Zheke! Yan Zheke! ”</p><p>Yan Zheke could finally understand the glorious feeling that her boyfriend had been raving about. Her cheeks were flushed and as she saw Feng Shaokun step into the ring, the judgments that Lou Cheng made earlier came flowing into her mind.</p><p>Everyone knew that Feng Shaokun had the hots for Qian Ruoyu, and he was the standard knight in shining armor you would find anywhere. Since his beloved had just been defeated, he would be desperate to take revenge to get her to have a better impression on him. Hence, his way of fighting would be more extreme than usual…</p><p>This is my chance to use the 24 Blizzard Strikes!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
