He then forcefully straightened his leg and kicked out, which went head-to-head with Lou Cheng.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>When the two legs collided, Lou Cheng immediately sucked in his abdomen and pushed his knee, as he channeled the energy from rebound impact to his thigh, and then to his abdomen, which straightened his back.</p><p>He had used Dong Yi’s leg as the base to prepare himself for a second attack. Using his right fist, he threw a rapid and fierce punch towards the opponent!</p><p>After rounds and rounds of battle, especially after his fierce fight with Wei Shengtian where he managed to create energy through relaxing, he had a better understanding of his 24 Blizzard Strikes. Never did he know that he could use such fantastic method to prepare his subsequent attacks, and indeed, Brutal Blizzard did give him a feeling that he could attack continuously!</p><p>Dong Yi initially wanted to take advantage of the situation to dodge the attack by furthering himself from Lou Cheng, and used agile dogfighting techniques which he specialized in to counterattack. However, before he could do all these, Lou Cheng had already rapidly followed by a series of attacking moves, which were both crazy and barbarous. There was no way Dong Yi could intercept.</p><p>Out of no choice, he hurriedly lifted his left arm and retreated his right foot as he stomped onto the ground. He stabilized himself before he turned his back suddenly, which shocked his joints and generated a swing force.</p><p>Bam! The fist hit Dong Yi’s arm. The impact had caused Lou Cheng’s body to sway. However, since the opponent had counterattacked him hastily, as an experienced fighter, Lou Cheng stomped his right foot, wriggled his back and forcefully pulled his body back. He then took advantage of the situation. With a jerk, he threw out his left fist like a spear and shot a piercing lightning strike, which forced Dong Yi to give up dodging the attack but use his palm to suppress it instead.</p><p>This allowed Lou Cheng to fight heartily as he followed up the attack with his 24 Blizzard Strikes. He repeatedly borrowed strength and launched his next attack. As his punches and kicks grew fiercer and fiercer each time, the cheering noise from the spectators became softer and softer. It seemed like they were too terrified even to breathe.</p><p>Dong Yi swayed under the Brutal Blizzard attack and he was certain that he would soon be defeated if this was to continue. He then noticed that his opponent now was also growing weaker and could be easily defeated as well.</p><p>Things can’t go on like this!</p><p>He twisted his back and stomped his feet, producing a violent whirlwind force to the ground. At that instant, the ring shook, like the houses that shook and swayed in heavy thunder, where faint colliding sound could be heard in the echoes.</p><p>Dong Yi’s shoes split open. He fiercely pushed his palms forward, like a heavy thunder, and slammed them onto Lou Cheng.</p><p>Since Lou Cheng had been borrowing energy, his energy now was at his peak and was fearless of anything. With the “Lightning and Fire Stance” and “Mega Avalanche” in his mind, he bent his legs and lowered his center of gravity. As if an unstoppable force, he waved his right arm and threw a Mountain Blast Punch. He had decided to use an attack move to counter the opponent’s attack and went head-to-head with the opponent, without any sign of retreating at all.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>One fist against two palms, causing Lou Cheng’s and Dong Yi’s bodies to sway back and fro. It was a tie.</p><p>Just then, Dong Yi moved his abdomen and opened his mouth. A sudden lightning bolt appeared as he yelled.</p><p>“Suffering!”</p><p>The sound of Thunderbolt Blast roared, so loud that it rocked the sky!</p><p>Lou Cheng never thought that Dong Yi could launch such a strong move under this circumstance, and his brain was in buzz at once. Waves seemed to have appeared in his frozen Heart Lake, creating a whirlwind and constantly breaking the “layer of ice” that was originally there.</p><p>This made him dizzy as he felt a rusty metallic taste from his throat. He could no longer keep his balance as he staggered backward.</p><p>Luckily he had never looked down on Dong Yi from the start and remained cautious about his opponent. At this critical moment, he bit the tip of his tongue.</p><p>The piercing pain caused Lou Cheng to wake at once as he quickly recovered his balance. He then continued to retreat and hopefully to distant himself from the opponent, to dodge from the constant attacks.</p><p>On the other hand, Dong Yi, who had perpetually used his killer move, was not feeling any better. He retreated awhile before advancing. With a dash that was as swift as lightning visualized in his mind, he moved his back, leaped a few steps, and then appeared beside Lou Cheng.</p><p>He used his right palm as a knifehand and aggressively struck towards Lou Cheng’s throat.</p><p>As Lou Cheng had just recovered his balance, he had no time to cope with the strike. All he could do was to shift his shoulders, raised his right arm and blocked that strike.</p><p>Bam! The moment the knifehand struck Lou Cheng’s arm, Dong Yi turned his left hand into a shape of a bird’s beak as he silently poked towards Lou Cheng’s weakest point on his waist.</p><p>The right hand acted as a distraction, while the left hand silently attacked the opponent!</p><p>This was indeed the most vicious killer move!</p><p>If the opponent managed to hit that weak point, Lou Cheng’s kidney on that side would be considered useless!</p><p>Just then, the Lou Cheng’s Heart Lake was once again “frozen.” His pores suddenly opened as he felt danger from the opponent.</p><p>Though he had yet to master his “Ice Mirror,” but after several days of tough training, he had managed to raise his perception of Condensation Stance. Together with his skilled meditation, he could somewhat stimulate the sense of “Absolute Reaction.”</p><p>Even so, Lou Cheng had only managed to open his pores. He still did not have the perception of how and where the enemies could attack from.</p><p>Without thinking, he tightened his right thigh and launched a ferocious side kick towards Dong Yi’s groin. He had decided to attack to defend himself!</p><p>Of course, Dong Yi would not sacrifice his life for Lou Cheng’s kidney. Seeing the situation, he gave up on launching “Hidden Thunder Palm” as he lowered his center of gravity and barely used his left palm to block Lou Cheng’s kick.</p><p>Taking advantage of the situation, Lou Cheng withdrew his kick, turned his body and swept out his left leg.</p><p>Bam! Like a soft whip, he straightened his left leg and kicked towards Dong Yi’s knee joint, forcing the opponent to use his leg to block the attack.</p><p>They collided and rebounded. Once again, Lou Cheng borrowed energy, took advantage of the situation and struck out the “Brutal Blizzard.” This had helped to pull back the situation.</p><p>Ever since Dong Yi had started using “Thunderbolt Blast,” till now when everything was back to normal, all the spectators seemed to have sat through a rollercoaster ride. Every time before they could cheer and dance for Dong Yi, they were forced to swallow back their cheers again with the change in situation.</p><p>Yan Zheke, who was sat at Songcheng University martial arts club seats, did not show much reaction. As compared to the battle between Lou Cheng and Wei Shengtian, this vicious fight was nothing.</p><p>It was as if she was certain that Lou Cheng could resolve such situation at ease.</p><p>Of course, she would feel worried, anxious, terrified, but all these were natural and uncontrollable. Her body shivered slightly as she unconsciously interlocked and grasped her hands tightly, looking as though she was praying.</p><p>Behind Yan Zheke, Sun Jian, Li Mao and the others heaved a long sigh of relief. It was till now that they had finally returned to themselves from that shock.</p><p>After a long fierce fight, Dong Yi had once again felt that Lou Cheng’s strikes were becoming fiercer and fiercer. He had an illusion that his opponent could never stop.</p><p>He forcefully took a deep breath. A thunder seemed to blast within his body and jerked his abdomen.</p><p>“Split!”</p><p>Another Thunderbolt Blast split open the clear sky and slowed down Lou Cheng’s movement.</p><p>However, as compared to the killer move which he had accumulated earlier on, this move which Dong Yi had just struck was not as strong and did not cause Lou Cheng any dizziness.</p><p>He was clear about this. Thus, his main purpose was not to injure his opponent, but to dodge aside and use Thunderclap Steps to keep a distance from his opponent.</p><p>Lou Cheng took a deep breath, sprang his back and leaped forward. Together with the crazy strong vibe he had when he defeated Wei Shengtian, he displayed a strong determination in pursuing his opponent.</p><p>Though Dong Yi was faster than Lou Cheng, the former did not have the ability of mercurial balance and was not as agile as the latter when switching moves. As the ring space was limited, Dong Yi was also unable to run straight. Every time he tried to change his direction or position, the distance between Lou Cheng and himself would draw nearer.</p><p>“I can even feel the weariness though I’ve just entered the ring. Yet he is still looking energized after battling two rounds of fierce battles…” Dong Yi was stunned. He knew he could no longer escape as he saw Lou Cheng ferociously chasing after him. In his eyes, Lou Cheng was like a terrifying god statue that could swallow his spirit and this frightened him.</p><p>Being frightened could only slow one down. Lou Cheng leaped a big step forward and got hold of Dong Yi. He lifted his left hand and struck a Downward Cut with Fist towards Dong Yi’s neck.</p><p>The spectators, as if they had sensed the danger, went dead silent when they saw the scene.</p><p>Noticing that a punch was heading his way, Dong Yi quickly shrank his field of view. Instead of blocking the punch with his hand, he tightened and sprang from his back as he forcefully dodged to his left.</p><p>At the same time, he rapidly used his left hand to strike towards Lou Cheng’s right chest.</p><p>All these changes happened in an instance. Lou Cheng had never expected Dong Yi to give up defending himself totally, so he was not in time to terminate his attack halfway. He could only purposely missed his attack by shifting his body to the left, and allowed the opponent’s palm to brush against his chest and strike the inner part of his right arm. Yan Zheke jumped from her seat when she saw what Lou Cheng was doing.</p><p>While her heart was aching for her lover, Lou Cheng’s left fist had ferociously struck Dong Yi’s right arm.</p><p>Clank! Dong Yi’s shoulder blade dented in as his bone fractured.</p><p>Enduring the pain, Lou Cheng pressed on in advancing his attack. Taking advantage of the situation to recover himself, he jerked his left arm and attacked towards Dong Yi’s temple. To determine who would win the battle, one needed to act fast!</p><p>Bam! Using one of his hands to block Lou Cheng’s left fist, the referee took a glance at the miserable Dong Yi who had given up before he raised his other hand and announced aloud,</p><p>“Lou Cheng wins!”</p><p>It was till then that Lou Cheng recalled what had happened just now. He used his hand to cover the injury on his right arm and asked, feeling puzzled,</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>It was only a preliminary, and not the final stage to advancement. Why did he choose to fracture his bone in order to injure his opponent slightly?</p><p>Why?</p><p>Dong Yi forced a smile, sighed and said,</p><p>“That’s the only thing I can do…”</p><p>The spectators finally understood the reason behind what had happened. All of a sudden, they shouted in unity,</p><p>“Dong Yi! Dong Yi! Dong Yi!”</p><p>Their voices contained a sense of disappointment, but yet at the same time, with a strong sense of affection.</p><p>Dong Yi was creating an opportunity for their last player!</p><p>“Dong Yi! Dong Yi! Dong Yi!”</p><p>Listening to the cheering that filled the arena, Lou Cheng did not make any gesture this time. Instead, he was touched by this solemn and stirring atmosphere, at the same time, enjoying it.</p><p>Being able to “beat” these arrogant spectators to the extent that they could only cheer solemnly, he felt somewhat satisfied with himself.</p><p>He was kind enough not to inform Dong Yi that he had reached his limit. He had depleted most of his energy, and if Dong Yi were to press on for another round of attack, he might just give up on winning.</p><p>…</p><p>At Fearless Squad club sitting area, Tan Ming stood up and walked towards the ring in bewilderment.</p><p>Just then, Qiu Yang who was behind him yelled.</p><p>“You go find the tournament supervisor to report your injuries and request for a change in player. Substitute to take over.”</p><p>Tan Ming turned around, looking stunned and replied softly,</p><p>“But I, I’m not injured…”</p><p>Qiu Yang had already walked in front of him. Using his left hand as a support, he slanted his body to block to the camera while he used his right hand to throw a punch towards Tan Ming’s abdomen secretly.</p><p>The punch caused Tan Ming to bend forward from the impact, and he heard Qiu Yang whispered,</p><p>“You’re injured now…”</p><p>The pain allowed Tan Ming to understand the situation as he recalled this guy in front of him had a famous nickname at Yimo.</p><p>“Mad Dog!”</p><p>“Mad Dog” Qiu Yang!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
