She asked,</p><p>“Cheng. Why are you wearing such an odd look on your face?”</p><p>“Ah?” Lou Cheng suddenly returned to earth and realized that he was drunk in his self-delusion just now. So he answered humorously, “When I see your smile, I thought I must be a very, very particular and unique man out of the billions of other men on Earth to be chosen by a girl as good as you Yan Zheke.”</p><p>After he had gotten rid of the anxiety and fear within his heart, he felt so extraordinarily relaxed that he was able to say the things that he was normally too embarrassed to talk about.</p><p>“Pooh…” Yan Zheke immediately broke into laughter upon hearing this, and it took her an enormous amount of effort before she finally stopped her body from trembling. Then, she put on a look of grievance and said, “Cheng, you’ve changed!”</p><p>“I did?” Lou Cheng asked subconsciously.</p><p>Yan Zheke nibbled her lower lip softly and said pitifully,</p><p>“You’re not like this before…”</p><p>“Oh? How was I before?” Lou Cheng let out a laugh and asked.</p><p>A beautiful dimple appeared on Yan Zheke’s face as she looked up and said ‘grievingly’,</p><p>“The first time you talked to me, you were so nervous that you would stammer out of anxiety! Later on, you would only send me corny words through QQ. However, you can say all these things to me with a straight face now! Humph, tell me! You have a ‘dog’ outside, haven’t you? You must be practicing with it every day…”</p><p>Speaking of this, she really pretended to be mad and covered her mouth with her left hand. She smiled with her eyes even shimmering.</p><p>Lou Cheng also felt fun. He sat down by her side to dig a block of ointment and picked up her wrist. He continued to smear the bruises on the girl’s right arm and until Yan Zheke stopped laughing he answered, “I was just inspired in the moment…”</p><p>At that time, he heard Li Mao almost stopped bathing. So he transferred the topic quickly. “What I told you today is the basic issues you should pay attention to as a new fighter. Although it’s my experience and lessons learned, it turns that other coach will also instruct you the same way as me.”</p><p>Yan Zheke said with a smile, “But the first time you were playing the Challenge Tournament, did you have any guidance?”</p><p>“Oh, I didn’t get it…” Lou Cheng stunned for a while. “How can Coach Shi even not ask about me and let me fend for myself?”</p><p>Not until he guided Yan Zheke that he found something wrong about his first Challenge Tournament. At that time, he thought that all the coaches treated their apprentices the same attitude as Coach Shi when their apprentices had a challenge tournament.</p><p>…</p><p>While Geezer Shi got back to the teacher’s apartment, he lied on the sofa and put legs on the coffee table without any manner.</p><p>He wrinkled his brows, thinking out loud.</p><p>“This guy has luck, curiosity, and perseverance. But he went with the flow so successfully, so I need to teach him some lessons about failure…”</p><p>…</p><p>While they were chatting like straying off topic, Lou Cheng had rubbed the bruises on the arms and hands of Yan Zheke. He got out of the seat and squatted before her, and then pointed to her leg and said,</p><p>“Are there also some bruises?”</p><p>Yan Zheke answered “Yes” with biting her lips.</p><p>Lou Cheng rolled up her pants cautiously and was afraid of touching her wound. And then he glanced at her skinny white legs which had fine lines. When he found the bruise, he held up her shank with one hand and used the other hand to rub the bruise with ointment carefully. He discovered that the girl’s leg touching as soft and delicate as ivory that he was reluctant to let it go.</p><p>Watching Lou Cheng squatting before her so toughly and feeling his tenderness and love, Yan Zheke was very happy, so she thought that she should change a position for the convenience of Lou Cheng.</p><p>Should I put feet on the bench? No, this posture is so ugly and rude…</p><p>Or should I put my feet on his knee to raise the calf so that he needn’t bend anymore? But the shoes are dirty. If I really want to do so, I have to take off the shoes first…</p><p>Yan Zheke suddenly felt too shy and ultimately she gave up this idea. So she intended to sit holding her knees. When she was going to say it, she heard that the bathroom door opened and she heard the footsteps of Li Mao. She quickly pushed back the falling hair and sat very seriously and square.</p><p>Li Mao had been used to their sweetness. He glanced at them and said,</p><p>“Cheng, Yan Zheke, see you at half past six!”</p><p>“Okay, see you later!” Lou Cheng turned back and waved good bye. He watched Li Mao opening the door and walking out.</p><p>Bang! The door of the locker room closed by itself and it again isolated them from the outside world.</p><p>“Well, let’s change the other leg.” Lou Cheng put down Yan Zheke’s pant which was rolled over just now inch by inch to avoid sticking the ointment on the pant.</p><p>Then, he rolled up her right pant and slightly adjusted his center of gravity to keep awkward squatting posture which even made him feel embarrassed. He rubbed the scattered bruises carefully and slowly with the ointment.</p><p>While he was rubbing, he suddenly found the unusual quietness all around. The sound outside the locker room was so far from him like it came from the horizon.</p><p>Are there only Yan Zheke and me in the locker room?</p><p>Only two of us?</p><p>After realizing this point and hearing gentle and long breath sound of the girl, Lou Cheng felt the skin he was touching being more tender and delicate. He suddenly felt like ants in the pants.</p><p>In the locker room which was as quiet as isolated with the whole world, he suddenly was woken up by the heavier breath sound. After he thought over that he just found the sound was his.</p><p>And the girl’s breath seemed to be already affected by his breath which also vaguely sped up a little.</p><p>There appeared a little bit inexplicable atmosphere among the breathing sound. Lou Cheng felt his mouth patched and tongue scorched and felt strangely nervous. He found that the girl’s leg seemed soft, but in fact, it contained the surprising flexibility which was made by the long-term martial arts practice. So he enjoyed every time he pressed his hand on it.</p><p>He heard that Yan Zheke’s breath became lower as if she was restrained her emotion. But the more she behaved like this, the thirstier he was. He felt her breathing sound was like a feather which tickled his heart gently and continuously.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s hands gradually slowed down. It seemed that he was not rubbing the bruises.</p><p>Surrounded by the empty silence, Yan Zheke suddenly called him in a low voice,</p><p>“Cheng…”</p><p>This shivering sound made Lou Cheng feel surprised. He suddenly raised his head and saw the girl whose eyes were as beautiful as lake. And the girl was so shy that her cheek became pink which was so lovely that he liked so much.</p><p>“What…” Lou Cheng didn’t know why he had to swallow spittle so hard and he felt Yan Zheke was also gently trembling.</p><p>When he was speaking, Yan Zheke put her hands on his shoulders. She bent over and said in front of Lou Cheng’s face with crimson cheek,</p><p>“I’m not showing my thanks… ”</p><p>Before she finished her words, she suddenly closed her eyes and held her breath. Then she kissed the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Lou Cheng stunned for a while. And when he saw that the girl moved back shyly with a little proudness like a frightened white rabbit who was trying to avoid, his blood immediately burned. He suddenly sat straight and rushed forward to hold Yan Zheke. Then he kissed her beautiful lips at once.</p><p>Yan Zheke struggled by instinct. Her head shook around so that Lou Cheng only kissed her cheek.</p><p>But only because of this slight kiss, she was suddenly quiet and closed her eyes with her hands falling down to seize the clothes of Lou Cheng.</p><p>Lou Cheng kissed the girl’s cheek once and once again. He felt her cheek was so soft and smooth which was actually much better than the skin on the arms and legs.</p><p>He kissed Yan Zheke with his dry lips for a while and then moved to her glowing pink lips. He was getting there closer and closer.</p><p>Finally, he could not help but kiss her lips directly, containing both her upper and lower lip at one time.</p><p>The hands clutching his skirt of Yan Zheke suddenly paralyzed. She seemed to have a fine sigh and she became submissive to lean to Lou Cheng with her quivering eyelashes.</p><p>Lou Cheng felt that the girl’s lips were as sweet as orange petals. Sometimes he sucked them, and sometimes he outlined her lips with the tongue. He never missed any good taste on her lips and kissed in a daze.</p><p>He occasionally separated the girl’s lips and counted her shell teeth with his tongue. He tasted something sweet, but no longer separated her teeth delicately until he found that the girl was closing her teeth very firmly. He gave up forwardly and he would wait till the girl agreed to kiss like that.</p><p>After a long time, Yan Zheke suddenly took back her lips. She breathed heavily and glanced at him shyly and charmingly,</p><p>“Do you want to suffocate me…”</p><p>She said it when her cheek was against Lou Cheng’s. Lou Cheng understood what kind of breathing was like the orchid. He also puffed because of the excitement. Meanwhile he laughed, “Couldn’t you breathe with your nose?”</p><p>Is this the instinct?</p><p>“Well, I’m not as amative as you!” Yan Zheke said.</p><p>I just like to kiss with holding my breath, so what?!</p><p>Seeing the shining eyes, pink cheek and glossy lips of Yan Zheke, Lou Cheng couldn’t help but kiss her once again and he kept both the two tempting lips in his mouth.</p><p>This time, he no longer kissed violently. He tasted the taste on her lips carefully and put his hands on the back of the girl as he gently touched her back.</p><p>They separated and kissed again and again. Finally Yan Zheke pushed him away and said to him seriously as she was puffing,</p><p>“We should go back now!”</p><p>And if we go on like this, I really do not know what will happen next!</p><p>“Go back?” Lou Cheng said in dismay, “How good here is with no noise and no bystanders.”</p><p>Having such a place for date is rare!</p><p>Yan Zheke wiped her mouth and turned to the other side.</p><p>“Well, I won’t give ‘pervert’ like you a chance to make something wrong!”</p><p>Speaking of this, she found that Lou Cheng was in a loss through the corner of her eye, so she suddenly changed a soft tone.</p><p>“I have a lot of things to do next. I can do my homework at night, but I have to take advantage of the warm sun today to dry the quilt, to wash clothes and to clean up the dormitory.”</p><p>“Well, OK.” Lou Cheng could sense the girl’s fear, so he didn’t ask more. And he was already contented that he could kiss her for so many times!</p><p>He glanced at Yan Zheke and suddenly laughed.</p><p>“But we can’t go back immediately. We have to wait for a moment.”</p><p>“Why?” Yan Zheke asked with her ‘bright eyes’.</p><p>“Because what you look like now…” Lou Cheng laughed and reminded her with his eyes full of uncovered love.</p><p>Yan Zheke took out the phone with confusion and used the screen as a mirror. Then she found her lips were so red and glossy and her cheek was also red which directly gave people the feeling that she had kissed for a long time.</p><p>“Big pervert!” She pounded Lou Cheng shyly and said, “Right, you haven’t finished rubbing my bruises. Continue now!”</p><p>Lou Cheng squatted again with a smile and continued to rub the bruises on the right leg of Yan Zheke. Sometimes when he looked up to the girl, he found that she always bit her lower lip and looked at him shyly and quietly. Even though she said nothing, her beautiful eyes contained a lot of emotions.</p><p>The locker room became quiet again. Different from the previous quietness filled with pink, this time it was like the lake at night, peaceful and tranquil.</p><p>Lou Cheng suddenly thought of a song with one special lyric,</p><p>“When I was seventeen years old, I kissed her face and I thought that we would be together forever…”</p><p>And now, when he was nineteen years old, he first had a feeling about forever.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
