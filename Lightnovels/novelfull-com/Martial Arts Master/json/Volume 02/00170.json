After such a fierce battle, he was feeling rather excited, which caused him to say some words from the bottom of his heart. This was perfectly normal. However, to repeat the same words for his opponent would be damn awkward and embarrassing!</p><p>He could only maintain his polite smile and replied,</p><p>“You’re very strong.”</p><p>This was true indeed. Last week when he was challenging himself at Tiantong Taoist temple with that Xie fellow, he had also depended on his last-minute reaction. However, his victory was also partially because the opponent did not have enough strength to counterattack. If today Peng Chengguang had gotten that Xie fellow’s martial arts skills, it was very likely that he himself would lose in this battle.</p><p>As Lou Cheng thought of all these and wanted to add on to his words, he instantly heard a buzzing sound in his ears. All of sudden, waves of loud and joyful cheers filled the arena.</p><p>“Lou Cheng! Lou Cheng!”</p><p>Even though most of the students did not understand the fierce exchanges of fists and kicks between the two fighters, neither could they sensed the horror of Tremor force, they could see how Peng Chengguang had split open the ground like a spider web through his explosive attack, and how Lou Cheng had cracked open the bricks from his movements. They had observed the terrifying tension during the hand-to-hand fight and had vividly seen the beauty in how Lou Cheng had finally rotated both his arms to attack his way to victory continuously.</p><p>That fierce battle that stretched the human muscles to the limit, that beauty of displaying the strength, that continuous pounding that made the spectators’ heart pounded with excitement as it gradually shattered the masks of the spectators and demolished the walls that were built around their hearts. It fired them up as they finally vent out their emotions that were suppressed within them for days!</p><p>For those students that were usually quiet and tamed, such outburst of emotions made them felt lost for a moment. When the referee announced the outcome of the battle, they appeared slightly bewildered as they paused and kept silent for a while. They then lost control over their emotions and roared the name aloud,</p><p>“Lou Cheng! Lou Cheng!”</p><p>The screams from the thousands of spectators turned into a storm, as if it could blow away the curved roof of the martial arts arena. Yet in the midst of this warm and enthusiastic atmosphere sat four people who seemed to be frozen from their skins to their bones and drenched from head to toe by the water from the Antarctica.</p><p>“How are we going to fight…” Deng Hua, the guy with the Mohican-style hair, was full of confidence when he stepped into Songcheng University. He was the only one who seemed relaxed. However, after watching the series of Thunder Roar Zen that Lou Cheng had played in the battle, his confidence had plunged. He finally became hopeless the moment their leader, Mo Zicong, exclaimed the phrase “Tremor Punch”.</p><p>Noticing him open and close his mouth, Mo Zicong and the others turned pale.</p><p>Facing Lou Cheng, attrition warfare tactic would be useless. However, based on his battles with Fearless Squad, it seemed that he was still incapable of sweeping off most of the Ninth Pin fighters from the ring. This gave them a chance. As long as one out of the four did his best in attacking Lou Cheng, even if that person couldn’t defeat him, it would still help the teammates to deplete his energy for an easy fight.</p><p>By then, even if the strong Lin Que joined in the battle, he did not have infinite stamina. With pairing up attrition warfare tactic, they might have a chance of winning. As for the remaining fighters in Songcheng University, they could not even be bothered with them!</p><p>However, in only about two weeks’ time, Lou Cheng had managed to master Tremor Punch. Without any tactic or skill to counter him, who would dare to go against him by then? If no one was there to go against him, how could they do their best to attack him?</p><p>What was even scarier was that for a Professional Ninth Pin fighter like Lin Que, even if he did master a skill like Tremor Punch, he could at most launched it thrice or four times, which was insufficient for the opponent to feel helpless. As long as they were cautious and alert, they might still be to withstand them or dodge them. However, it would be different in Lou Cheng’s case. Lou Cheng could spread open his arms and rotated them as he continuously launched his Tremor Punch onto the opponent. How many Professional Ninth Pin fighters could withstand that?</p><p>If Peng Chengguang could not withstand, anyone that was weaker than him would certainly be unable to withstand!</p><p>How could they battle like this?</p><p>Bam bam bam! Mo Zicong could almost hear the sound of the Tremor Punch echoed in his heart as he saw himself and his teammates were one by one pounded by Lou Cheng on the ring. No one could withstand more than three strikes.</p><p>How could they battle like this?</p><p>They looked at each other and noticed each other’s fear. Their feelings were totally different as compared to the relaxed feeling they had when they first arrived.</p><p>They never thought that they would observe their opponent’s battle to the extent that they lost all their confidence and was fearful of battling him!</p><p>Just as Zhao Qiang, Zhang Jingye and the others had abandoned their goody two shoes student image and were cheering aloud, Lou Cheng exchanged glances with Yan Zheke who was at the martial arts club seats. He silently raised his fist to express victory but quickly returned to normal as he saw Peng Chengguang shaking his head.</p><p>Peng Chengguang bowed to his opponent before he staggered down the ring, and walked towards Gao Rao, Zhang Ying and his other juniors, who all appeared transfixed by the outcome of the battle.</p><p>Lou Cheng actually thought of questioning Peng Chengguang after bowing. He wanted to ask him why he did not want to collaborate with other martial arts schools and pursue the preliminaries reward of obtaining a rare skill, but he felt that his relationship with him was not strong enough for him to ask such question, so he bit his tongue.</p><p>“Lou Cheng! Lou Cheng!”</p><p>The joyful cheers reverberated in the martial arts stadium. Lou Cheng revealed his happiness and satisfaction. He did not consider much as he enjoyed the sweet taste of victory. He raised both his arms up high and clapped his hands to show his appreciation as he returned to their martial arts club seats. He then smacked his hand with Yan Zheke, Lin Que, Sun Jian, Li Mao and the others to celebrate his victory.</p><p>Just then, one of the students noticed that there were many crushed bricks on the ring ground, which reminded him of the school suicide video that was spread around recently. He recalled that the student fighter who rescued the man had also crushed the ground in the same manner.</p><p>He then looked at the figure of Lou Cheng and a thought struck him as he exclaimed loudly, “That person who rescued the guy was Lou Cheng!”</p><p>“Him?” “Yes, if it’s not Lin Que, it’s definitely him!” The words spread fast across the spectators stand. Suddenly the cheers were greatly reduced in the martial arts arena as many of them took out their phones to check out the video. Many faces were flushed red as they looked agitated and respectfully at Lou Cheng. They then excitedly discussed the topic with their friends, causing the enthusiastic atmosphere to increase instead.</p><p>At Mingwei Martial Arts School seats, Zhang Ying, Qu Yu and the others were speechless as they could not believe what had happened. They suppressed their emotions and kept silent, looking as if they were more disappointed with their Elder Senior Brother’s defeat than himself.</p><p>Peng Chengguang took a glance at them as he heard the cheers echoing in the martial arts arena. He smiled bitterly and said,</p><p>“What’s there to be bitter about? What’s there to be shame about losing to such opponent? This just encourages me to work hard and reminds me not to slack down so that I can be on par with him someday.”</p><p>He then turned his body and subconsciously glanced over to Songcheng University Martial Arts Club area.</p><p>By then, how much stronger will Lou Cheng be again?</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the locker room, after helping Lou Cheng to apply ointment and was passionately kissed by him several times when no one was around, Yan Zheke returned to her dormitory.</p><p>She had yet to mention to Lou Cheng that her mum might be coming to do a “spot check”. She decided to think of a strategy first before discussing this matter with his boyfriend.</p><p>The moment she stepped into her room, she saw Zong Yanru and Shi Xiangyang were surrounding Li Liantong, who was watching her phone. She exclaimed and praised from time to time while watching the battle video.</p><p>“That’s really cool!”</p><p>“How can he have such a strong leg….”</p><p>“Martial Arts Competition can indeed destroy shoes…”</p><p>Hearing which, Yan Zheke rejoiced and blurted out,</p><p>“Dirty Tong, you’re done recording the video?”</p><p>She had requested her dormitory mates to do a favor by recording the battle video, focusing only on Lou Cheng’s battle!</p><p>This was because it was hard to say when the recorded video by the TV station would be broadcasted. Moreover, a battle between Lou Cheng and a strong opponent like Peng Chengguang would be meaningful to keep and remember. Thus, she would want to get such video first-hand, so that she could save it and give to her boyfriend as a gift.</p><p>“Of course~ For your treat, we did not even focus on watching the tournament and each of us recorded a video for you!” Li Liantong replied, feeling pleased.</p><p>Yan Zheke was excited as she urged.</p><p>“Faster, let me look at it. Is the recording blurry?”</p><p>Li Liantong chuckled and said, “How can that be? I’m a talented videographer!”</p><p>While talking, Yan Zheke squeezed beside them and carefully looked at the recording as she recalled about what happened yesterday.</p><p>Last week her own virgin battle video was only broadcasted on Friday and she’d almost forgotten to record it. Luckily, Cheng remembered it and set the alarm. During his lesson, he gave an excuse of having diarrhea to leave class early as he hurriedly rushed back to his dormitory to record the broadcast via the internet.</p><p>As she had lessons in the same school building at that time and was seated by the windows, she coincidentally saw Cheng ran rapidly to the dormitory zone. Out of curiosity, she messaged to him to ask him what happened, and yet his reply made her eyes almost filled with tears. She felt really touched, so she decided to request Li Liantong and her other dorm mates to help her took video of today’s battle.</p><p>Seeing from the beginning till the end, Yan Zheke was really satisfied with the video. She then asked Li Liantong to copy it onto the computer while she shared with her about her mum, who might be coming to “spot check”. She clasped her hands together, interlocked her fingers and reminded, “When my mum is here and I’m not in the room, just answered her honestly about anything except Cheng. Also, for this weekend, just tell her that I’ve gone shopping with Guo Qing.”</p><p>Zong Yanru looked at her suspiciously and asked, “Ke, your mum will really come all the way here for ‘spot check’?</p><p>Just because she suspected that you might have a boyfriend?”</p><p>Yan Zheke looked at her with a stern face and nodded her head vigorously. “I feel that she will… Let me tell you. The unique thing about my mum is that she takes actions really fast! Either she doesn’t come at all, or she’ll come within these few days!”</p><p>If her actions were not so fast, she would not dare to elope when she was young!</p><p>“Kinda feel like I’m meeting an Empress Dowager soon…” Shi Xiangyang joked as she felt fearful about it.</p><p>After reminding her dorm mates, Yan Zheke pulled out last year’s “Freshman Guide” from the bookshelves and flipped open the page that displayed the map of the new school campus area.</p><p>She sat down and took out a ruler. Next, she started measuring and drawing on the map. Her attentiveness and seriousness made her looked even more attractive. Li Liantong and the others stared at her blankly as they wondering what she up to was.</p><p>Looking at the map and measuring the distance, Yan Zheke rolled her eyes and looked up as she murmured to herself,</p><p>“If mum were to come suddenly, most likely she would silently hide at a corner to observe the situation. However, she’s neither familiar with the campus nor my class schedule. With her intelligence, she’ll definitely not depend on luck to wait and observe, but would likely choose a place where she could see me to observe me in the dark secretly…”</p><p>“Excluding this condition, she could only choose three places to observe. First place would be the pedestrian walkway near the dormitory gate, since that’s where she’ll see people who returned from the cafeteria. Second place would be the entrance of the long bridge near the school building, because anyone who is returning to the dormitory and heading to the cafeteria would definitely walk pass there, so she would not miss anyone. Third place would be the exit of the martial arts arena…”</p><p>“She’s a Professional Ninth Pin fighter. According to the statistics provided on the information she found, she would have a wide field of view.”</p><p>Yan Zheke gently bit her low lip and she seriously stared at the three dangerous places which she had indicated. She then looked satisfied as she nodded her head and commented,</p><p>“Yup, as long as Cheng is not dating me in these places, mum will never find out about him!”</p><p>Just as she was about to praise herself for her intelligence, she suddenly saw Li Liantong came beside her and gave her a weird expression before asking,</p><p>“Ke, why don’t you just directly keep the distance away from Lou Cheng for a few days?”</p><p>Those assumptions, logic, the field of view, dangerous regions are too complicated!</p><p>Yan Zheke gave an “eh” sound, blinked her eyes and smiled innocently.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
