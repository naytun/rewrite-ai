I’m not inviting him alone… Since my daughter has bothered him, surely it would be okay for me to say thanks to him particularly if I gave a treat to all the members in special training. Are there any problems?”</p><p><em>“No problem, no problem… There was a big problem!”</em> Yan Zheke felt very worried that her head almost exploded, so she racked her brain to say, “But mom, everyone has their own activities on weekends. So how can I gather them just by saying it? And, mom, haven’t you said that you wanted to give a treat for my roommates?”</p><p>“Yes, I’ll treat your roommates tonight and then the group of people from the martial arts club tomorrow. We can go just after you finish your special training, so you do not need to worry that you can’t find them tomorrow.”</p><p><em>As for the problem about where to stay tonight, it would be easy to find a good hotel in such a big Songcheng City.</em></p><p>At this moment, Yan Zheke was speechless and she felt that she could not match her mother. She tried to control her panic and frustration and said as she looked up,</p><p>“Well, okay. I’ll mention it to them during special training tomorrow.”</p><p><em>If I refused this plan too vehemently, my mother would know that I am covered something up. Why should I be afraid? It’s just a meal. It’ll be all right if I urge Qing and Senior Sister Lin to pass on my words and tell Cheng to behave naturally!</em></p><p>As soon as she finished her words, Liu Xiaolin who stood next to her and who was always quiet suddenly said, “Junior master, you have other arrangements tomorrow. You have to attend the signing ceremony in Qin Yang.”</p><p>Liu Xiaolin was the daughter of Elder Senior Brother Ji Mingyu, so she called the mother of Yan Zheke junior master. However, she was only five years younger than Ji Mingyu and she had also married a family friend of Yan Zheke’s family. So Yan Zheke should actually call her auntie.</p><p>“I have a terrible memory!” Ji Mingyu patted her forehead and said regretfully, “Ke, I’m sorry that I can’t treat the members from your martial arts club who have special training.”</p><p><em>“No need to feel sorry…”</em> Yan Zheke silently relaxed, and then she suddenly realized that if she had been making excuses to prevent it, then it would probably have become a reality. Even her mother wouldn’t mention anything about the signing ceremony!</p><p><em>Mother, you’re really good at setting traps!</em></p><p>“Well, you can treat them next time. Anyway, I haven’t told them yet…” She said amiably, and changed the topic casually, “Mom since you’re so concerned about my teammates from the martial arts club, do you know something about our coach?”</p><p><em>Cheng has always been curious about the coach!</em></p><p>Ji Mingyu chuckled, “I’ve asked your grandfather about him. He only answered ‘an old guy’.”</p><p><em>“An old guy. It seems that our coach is really an expert of physical invulnerability in the same generation with my grandfather. But Coach Shi seems to have no relationship with my grandfather…”</em> Yan Zheke thought for a while. Then she threw all the tangled thoughts out of her mind and adjusted her mood so that she could continue to show her mother and aunt Liu the campus while chatting with them.</p><p>…</p><p>Lou Cheng put his phone by his side after he went back to the dormitory as he was waiting for good news from Yan Zheke. He did not play games with Cai Zongming and Zhao Qiang. He took out of his books and sat down to review what he had learned before carefully.</p><p>The amount of knowledge you had learned in university was dozens of times more than the knowledge in high school. Usually, the teacher would teach dozens of pages in one lecture. So if you weren’t talented and only studied by listening to the teacher in classrooms and doing homework, you would only understand a few of the main points. You would barely pass.</p><p>Therefore, the university required a higher standard of self learning. Your grades would get worse and worse if you couldn’t study independently, review, summarise the main points or find relevant reading material.</p><p>Lou Cheng was busy with martial arts training. He also had to go to classes both in the afternoon and at night. So he could go to the library with Yan Zheke only during weekend. Because of that, he could not master subjects very well. He realised that there was something new every page he reviewed after he opened his book.</p><p>While he was busy learning, it had become dark outside. Suddenly his phone buzzed and vibrated strongly.</p><p><em>“Was it a message from Ke?”</em> Lou Cheng felt glad and put down the gel pen in his hand. He did not dare have too much hope because this similar scene had happened sometimes where the messages were only spam or replies from Jiang Fei or Chen Qili.</p><p>As he picked up the phone, he saw the latest message directly on the screen even without unlocking the phone. And the message was:</p><p>Yan Zheke had sent an emoji which was like setting off the firecrackers,</p><p>“I’m ‘free’!”</p><p><em>“Is the inspection of my mother-in-law over now?”</em> Lou Cheng felt relieved. He felt so happy and he quickly unlocked his phone. He immediately replied,</p><p>“So can I ask my fairy out for a walk tonight?”</p><p>Yan Zheke stood at the bus stop and she almost had the impulse to cry as she watched the bus which her mother and aunt Liu had taken driving out of the eastern gate of her school.</p><p><em>That was hard work!</em></p><p><em>However, didn’t my mother leave too easily? Does she already believe me after only testing me twice?</em></p><p>Or did she do this because she is not suspicious?</p><p>While she was feeling confused and drained, she took out her cell phone and saw the reply. There was a slight smile on her face and she now felt relief and happiness.</p><p>“Okay~ But you have to wait another hour. The ‘fairy’ is afraid that the ‘Queen Mother’ would sneak back like a back thrust!”</p><p><em>“It looks like my ‘fairy’ has been frightened a lot by my mother-in-law…”</em> Lou Cheng felt not only distressed but also amused when he saw this message. <em>“It’s good to wait for another hour as I haven’t eaten dinner yet.”</em></p><p>…</p><p>Once the moon appeared above the willow tree, the people in love would go out on dates with each other. As soon as Lou Cheng saw Yan Zheke coming out of her dormitory, he rushed towards her and grabbed her hand immediately with fingers entwined.</p><p>“Let’s take a walk along the lake?” He suggested with a smile because there were too many people around.</p><p>Yan Zheke stared at him for a while with her eyes shining like stars. She chuckled and said, “Don’t you dare think of doing something bad!</p><p><em>It’s night now!</em></p><p><em>And that’s how I lost my first kiss!</em></p><p>Lou Cheng answered seriously, “I guarantee I won’t do anything bad!”</p><p><em>Is making out with my girlfriend a bad thing?</em></p><p>They strolled to the lake holding hands. Lou Cheng asked lovingly, “Are you tired from this afternoon? Is it hard to deal with the ‘Queen Mother’?”</p><p>“Yes, it is!” Yan Zheke nodded like a chicken pecking grains. “I’m not exaggerating. If it were you, you would have betrayed yourself within three minutes!”</p><p>“Haha, is it so hard?” Lou Cheng couldn’t believe it.</p><p>Yan Zheke took he right hand out of her pocket and counted the reasons with her fingers. “First, the ‘Queen Mother’ has been in relationships before and she’s experienced. Second, she’s a successful businesswoman with sharp eyes and a strong mental aura. Third, my mom is wise and she has lots of traps prepared. Fourth, she gave birth to me and raised me up which means she knows me intimately…”</p><p>“You must have worked hard just now!” Lou Cheng felt that she was so cute when she behaved like that, but on the other hand, he pitied her for working so hard.</p><p>Yan Zheke tilted her face to look at Lou Cheng with aggrieved eyes. “Yes, I really do. So how would you comfort me~!”</p><p>Lou Cheng stared at her delicate pink lips and said,</p><p>“How about a kiss?”</p><p>“Humph, that is not comfort. Obviously, you want to take this opportunity to satisfy yourself!” Yan Zheke said shyly. She turned to the other side and said, “Cheng, answer me honestly, had you prepared a lot for the visit to the aquarium this afternoon?”</p><p>At that time, they walked to the quiet secluded place where there was nobody around and only the dim light of road lamps shining on the ground.</p><p>“Not too much…” Lou Cheng answered humbly.</p><p>Yan Zheke turned around and stared at him with her beautiful and sparkling eyes. “Would you please let me have a look?”</p><p>Since she asked so gently, Lou Cheng could not help but hand his phone over and unlocked the screen to show the gallery. “I just downloaded some pictures, and made some notes… or how about I set up a password with your fingerprint so that you won’t have any trouble when you want to unlock my phone.”</p><p>“Aren’t you afraid that I’ll discover your secrets?” Yan Zheke looked over at him with a faint smile.</p><p>“In front of you, I have no secrets.” Lou Cheng answered with a sweet smile.</p><p>Yan Zheke chuckled and stopped walking. She looked down at the pictures downloaded by Lou Cheng. One, two, three… She looked through the pictures for a long time.</p><p>“So many pictures…” She whispered to herself and looked up at Lou Cheng. It seemed that she was moved to the point of tears in her eyes.</p><p>The girl quickly looked down and clicked the notebook in which she saw all this knowledge about marine life. The facts were categorized and some of it was highlighted looking just like the review notes she took before the NCEE (National College Entrance Examination)!</p><p>Yan Zheke said nothing for a long time as she stared at the phone. Lou Cheng said feeling slightly anxious, “I looked it up online and didn’t waste too much time on it…”</p><p>Yan Zheke’s hair had fallen down and covered part of her cheek. Lou Cheng could still vaguely see the sweet dimple on her face.</p><p>“Cheng, I’m very happy…”</p><p>“Ah, what?” Lou Cheng was stunned and didn’t hear what she said clearly.</p><p>Yan Zheke looked up and grunted. “Just let it go if you didn’t hear~”</p><p>Under the light of the street lamp, her eyes turned slightly red.</p><p>Lou Cheng was not a fool, so he understood her tone and guessed that she must have been touched. He said with a laugh, “I heard that you wanted a kiss.”</p><p>“Beh! Shameless! You big pervert!” Yan Zheke retorted and turned away while blushing with her pink cheeks.</p><p>But when Lou Cheng grabbed her hand and pulled her to his side, she came without resistance like she was boneless. She rested her head on his chest with her eyes half closed. Her eyelashes trembled, her nose moved slightly and her mouth opened slightly. She was so shy yet looked like she was waiting to make out with Lou Cheng.</p><p>Lou Cheng was so excited that he kissed her without thinking. He kissed her sweet lips and outlined her lips with his tongue. Sometimes he sucked her lips and sometimes he licked her lips.</p><p>After kissing her many times, Yan Zheke couldn’t hold her breath when they were kissing. She breathed rapidly with her noses. And her smell was so sweet and fragrant that Lou Cheng was enchanted.</p><p>In accordance with his belief that trying out once would do no harm, Lou Cheng again put his tongue into her mouth and touched her crystal white teeth. Then he tried to separate her teeth.</p><p>If she resisted, he would stop.</p><p>However, when his tongue touched her teeth, suddenly he felt that Yan Zheke stopped closing her mouth and opened her teeth slightly.</p><p>Hum! Lou Cheng felt that all the blood had come to his brain. He didn’t mind being bitten and squeezed his tongue through the small gap. When he made contact with the delicate tongue of Zheke, he felt an electric jolt and a soft sensation.</p><p>Yan Zheke moaned softly and held Lou Cheng tightly with her hands.</p><p>Looking for it, chasing it, entangling with it…Lou Cheng was like a traveler who was dying of thirst. He was desperate to suck the sweetness from Yan Zheke’s mouth and caress her clumsy, delicate and fragrant tongue.</p><p>He had no experience. But seeking a good thing was an instinct.</p><p>At this moment, he completely forgot the surrounding environment and forgot the drama and tension from the day.</p><p>He lost track of time. When he finally held the tender and fragrant tongue and decided to pull it into his mouth, Yan Zheke suddenly whimpered a cry and pushed him away. Her mouth was bright and red with saliva on it.</p><p>Then she buried her red face in his shoulder and took a few deep breaths.</p><p>“Pervert, pervert, you’re a big pervert!”</p><p>Her right hand pounded on the back of Lou Cheng gently and rhythmically.</p><p>Lou Cheng seemed to have forgotten to breathe just now, so he gasped in a breath and felt so happy and comfortable.</p><p>He said proudly, “If what you said is right, then all husbands and boyfriends are big perverts!”</p><p><em>I am proud to be a pervert since it’s with my beloved girlfriend!</em></p><p>“Well, I don’t care. You’re the number one big pervert!” Yan Zheke answered shyly. And suddenly, she cried out an “uh” in confusion, “What is touching me?”</p><p>Lou Cheng was so surprised but it was too late for him to hold his stomach in. Yan Zheke quickly lowered her head and saw the eye-catching ‘tent’.</p><p>The kiss just now was so passionate that Lou Cheng felt that his “little brother” looked like a sword.</p><p>“This, this is…” He thought quickly so that he could think of some good excuses.</p><p>Yan Zheke just felt so embarrassed. She suddenly turned around and said quietly in a soft voice,</p><p>“Pervert!”</p><p><em>I’ll never kiss you again!</em></p><p>Lou Cheng smiled with embarrassment and again held her in his arms. He explained seriously,</p><p>“If I don’t have such a reaction, you should be worried!”</p><p>“Well, anyway, you’re a big pervert!” Yan Zheke did not struggle and answered ‘angrily’.</p><p>Lou Cheng also recovered from his embarrassment. As he huggedher and listened to her shy and cute answers, he was also breathing in her fragrance and recalling the sweet taste of her mouth. He wanted to shout out the happiness within his heart.</p><p>…</p><p>After Yan Zheke’s mother had dropped by, the relationship between Lou Cheng and her became closer during the next week. Lou Cheng would successfully French kiss her from time to time, so he was very happy the whole week.</p><p>He practiced harder and became peaceful again instead of being irritable. After two more attempts feeling the cold state of Jindan (the Golden Elixir), he could almost control the real essence of the visualization.</p><p>It was slower than he expected, but still was within the normal range.</p><p>In a flash, it was Saturday morning. After Lou Cheng finished his morning tempering, he accompanied Yan Zheke and the others to the martial arts arena of Songcheng City.</p><p>This was the 1st Annual Amateur Ranking Event!</p><p>Songcheng Martial Arts Arena was very large and was divided into several sections. There was a business circle around which was built for the spectators and fighters who came here.</p><p>“What should I do, I’m a little nervous…” Yan Zheke held the hands of Lou Cheng and said pitifully.</p><p>Lou Cheng comforted her.</p><p>“Don’t be afraid, the fighters who are competing for the Amateur Second Pin were previously fighters of the Amateur Third Pin. So you have lots of advantages!”</p><p>A few hundred meters away from them, there was a coffee shop through which people could just see the entrance of the martial arts arena through its one way window.</p><p>And beside the one way window, Ji Mingyu wearing a black business suit held her coffee and silently looked at the couple who walked hand-in-hand.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
