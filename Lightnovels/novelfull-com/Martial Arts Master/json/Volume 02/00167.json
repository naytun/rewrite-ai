Then Li Mao wobbled back, while Zhang Ying took half a step backward to cancel out the force before she finally managed to stabilize her form.</p><p>Although they were both Amateur Second Pin fighters, Zhang Ying was a girl and had fought a passionate battle earlier, and thus she was at a disadvantaged position when it came to absolute strength!</p><p>Li Mao’s mind was still a little tense, so he couldn’t think clearly. Relying on his fighting instincts, he swayed and swung, twisting his waist and bulging his thighs into the form of a flexible whip as he kicked out with his left leg.</p><p>Pah! His left leg swiftly straightened and caused an explosion in the air.</p><p>Zhang Ying couldn’t dodge away in time. She could only grit her teeth, tighten the surface of her feet, and reply with a whip kick.</p><p>Bang! Their legs hit and shook, and they both backed up a step. With his thoughts focused only on attacking, Li Mao sprang at Zhang Ying again without any adjustments. He swelled his muscles and raised his right arm, then punched out like swinging a hammer heavily on war drums.</p><p>“Again…” Zhang Ying’s eyes shrank, as she quite regretted making that previous decision. At this point, she had no choice but to fight recklessly!</p><p>With the right leg slammed on the ground, she lifted her shoulder, clenched her fist and shot out just like a cannonball.</p><p>Bang! Another muffled sound. Failed to bear her opponent’s strength, Zhang Ying fell her upper body backward with her right arm swung open and her center of gravity uncontrolled, while Li Mao just staggered a little—he was ready to attack again!</p><p>Suddenly, Zhang Ying remembered the video from a competition that she studied a few days before. A picture flashed in her mind.</p><p>“You can try this! It won’t be worse, anyway!” She gritted her teeth, gave up trying to steady herself and attacking hurriedly. She tumbled backward, just like bending backward, but her right leg suddenly bounced up like a straight whip, hitting Li Mao unexpectedly.</p><p>Iron Bridge Moves! Dragon Turning Over Moves!</p><p>Zhang Ying learned this move from watching Lou Cheng’s battle video!</p><p>Before one entered high-ranked Dan Stage, there were no complicated moves and changes for the reason that low-level fighters would just turn them into showy but not practical skills instead of completing them.</p><p>Therefore, the core elements for these stages of martial arts were visualization, the strength of the skills, the set of exercises for tempering different muscles, and the things people could not learn from watching battle videos. Of course, some moves and skills could be learned by watching the videos several times, such as the back step of unloading trick in a collision, Lou Cheng’s Iron Bridge Moves, and Dragon Turning Over Moves.</p><p>Regarding the style, this move was simple and clear. The difficulty of this movement lay in their ability to control their own body’s center of gravity. But understanding was not grasping!</p><p>Zhang Ying was not at Lou Cheng’s level, but she also had never thought she would able to balance the body using the force to stand quickly. She simply relied on a girl’s flexibility and sought the chance to resist her enemy.</p><p>She bent over and kicked her leg like a whip beyond Li Mao’s expectation. Li Mao decided to attack, his left hand was pumping out like a whip. At that moment, he saw a black martial arts shoe move straight to his chin in a roaring speed.</p><p>Failed to return to his stance or block the attack with his right fist, Li Mao got nervous. He ducked his head, curled into a ball and then dodged the move without too much thought, like a lazy donkey rolling on the ground.</p><p>Zhang Ying missed the kick and lost her balance. She fell to the ground, rolling twice.</p><p>At the same instant, both of them used Carp Jumping Moves, and then they stood up again.</p><p>At this time, the students came to themselves from former excitement. They applauded for the courage and determination of the two fighters in the strikes.</p><p>And after this, Li Mao was frightened and scared. Calming down and getting prepared, he continued to face Zhang Ying’s attack.</p><p>Zhang Ying didn’t have the will for attacking. She began using footwork and walked around her opponent. She tried to control the game to have the initiative of attack.</p><p>She just walked over to the side and punched with a tremendous power. Li Mao wasn’t interested in gaining merits, but only in avoiding making any mistakes. He raised his right arm and blocked the attack, and then swung his arm to avoid the counterattack.</p><p>Zhang Ying moved behind him, lifted her thigh and kicked her toe to point at the bend in her enemy’s knee, while Li Mao twisted his waist, turned back, and then swept with a whip kick.</p><p>Similar scenes were repeated over and over, the muffled sounds of the collisions and air blasts resounded from time to time. Two fighters—one of them displayed a good attack, the other one defended steadily. For now, it is hard to tell the winner.</p><p>Instead of only taking defensive tactics in this process, Li Mao adopted a lightly and flexible style. Once he saw an opportunity, he would counterattack to ease the pressure from his passive position.</p><p>As time went on, he suddenly heard that Zhang Ying’s breathing became heavy, and her flexible footwork seemed to have slow a little bit.</p><p>“Her strength has diminished to the point of a qualitative change?” Li Mao felt his heart flicker. He didn’t immediately counterattack because he remembered that he was too anxious in the last game—he had started a fierce attack after noticing that Feng Shaokun was close to the limit, only to be nearly defeated by Feng Shaokun’s Tiger and Crane Assault.</p><p>That previous experience was a lesson. Li Mao held his mind and would steadily and slowly promote the offensive and defensive trend.</p><p>After using one move to force back Zhang Ying, he took a step and raised his right arm and swung it as if it were a steel whip. Pah!</p><p>It didn’t disrupt Zhang Ying’s footwork. Her right arm crossed her chest, beat in reverse, and sheltered this whip.</p><p>Li Mao obviously felt her weakness when they bumped into each other, so he didn’t show her any mercy. He swung his arms so that they were like two steel whips. With his body forward, he was crazily beating and lashing her. The flapping sound was endless.</p><p>Zhang Ying had to bite the bullet and even use her arms to block the attacks a few times. Finally, she couldn’t resist any longer, and with her arms spread out, it seemed that her body would be hit.</p><p>At this time, the referee next to them reached out his hand lightning fast and put it on Li Mao’s shoulder, and dispersed his power with just one shake.</p><p>“Round Three, Li Mao wins!”</p><p>With the referee’s announcement, the audience in the stand applauded loudly, not only cheering for Li Mao, but also to show respect for the girl who had fought so wonderfully.</p><p>Then, some students were whispering whether Li Mao’s last few moves were the legendary Turtle Fist or not.</p><p>Li Mao didn’t care about this. Even if his posture was ugly, it was good to win the game!</p><p>“This is the second victory I have won on behalf of the Songcheng University Martial Arts Club!” He gasped, overjoyed, and arose a thought:</p><p>“Martial art is so interesting!”</p><p>Zhang Ying released her grip, looking a little lost. She wanted to defeat Li Mao so that her Elder Senior Brother could meet Lou Cheng in his best physical condition—as to consume Lou Cheng’s energy, after witnessing that he played three games in a row, she never thought of it again.</p><p>“Well, with Elder Senior Brother’s abilities beating Li Mao is a piece of cake, and that game won’t affect the battle between him and Lou Cheng.”</p><p>Once she changed her thoughts she felt better, and walked down the ring toward her Elder Senior Brother.</p><p>“Well done.” Peng Chengguang didn’t hesitate to praise her.</p><p>Zhang Ying looked delighted after hearing this sentence, but then had a strange feeling. Her eyes began to well up, almost shedding tears. The words she had prepared before only came out in three words, “Elder Senior Brother…”</p><p>Elder Senior Brother, I’m so happy to help you…</p><p>Peng Chengguang smiled confidently, without spectacle.</p><p>“Go back and leave the rest to me.”</p><p>After a high-five, he walked along the path then up the stone steps and boarded the ring.</p><p>Li Mao suddenly felt some apprehension when he looked at the well-known Ninth Pin expert, not because of nervousness, but due to it being the first time he faced a professional fighter.</p><p>Don’t panic, I just want to dissipate his energy, I’m afraid of nothing!</p><p>Li Mao stabilized his mind, staring at Peng Chengguang as he posed.</p><p>This Ninth Pin expert looks more mature than his actual age…</p><p>Audiences shouted Li Mao’s name once again, cheering for him. Now they didn’t expect Li Mao could win this match after the last game, they only wanted him to consume the enemy’s energy using two pins gaps to create an advantage for Lou Cheng.</p><p>“Li Mao! Li Mao!” The roar of the audience swept across the arena. The referee waved his right hand.</p><p>“Round Four. Begin!”</p><p>Li Mao didn’t dare to fight directly with the Mighty One, who was of Professional Ninth Pin—he moved with snake steps, flashed to the side of Peng Chengguang, closed his fist and cracked it into his opponent.</p><p>Peng Chengguang had been standing firmly, not attacking. At this time, his right foot suddenly stepped to the side of Li Mao while raising his right arm. He blocked the fist easily by lifting up his arm.</p><p>And because of his ingenious step he was in close to his opponent!</p><p>At this time, all the back muscles of Peng Chengguang connected as if they were one piece, just like a big snake jittered. His right arm was followed by an elbow.</p><p>Bang! Li Mao blocked with his left palm in a hurry. He felt a vigorous hit immediately, and his hand abruptly hit his chest from the force of Peng Chengguang’s power.</p><p>He felt like he was suffocating. Just then, he lost his center of gravity and toppled backward onto the ground!</p><p>Peng Chengguang used his elbow of the potential impact, and quickly popped up his arm and grabbed Li Mao’s collar like the wind, using that force to help him to stand firm. He then withdrew his hand cheekily and smiled at him.</p><p>“If he didn’t grab my collar, but pinched my throat, I’d have died already…” Li Mao stood there, listless. The referee announced the results.</p><p>“Round Four. Peng Chengguang wins!”</p><p>The shouts and applause in the martial arts arena stopped abruptly, with only a few sounds reverberating. The audience didn’t expect for Li Mao to lose the game so fast without any fury!</p><p>He looks like he is defenseless!</p><p>This Professional Ninth Pin is too strong?</p><p>Lou Cheng stood up suddenly. He looked at the ring and felt as if his whole body was on fire. He was eager to fight.</p><p>This is an expected adversary!</p><p>If only bullying those weaker than you all the time, what’s the point to learn martial arts?</p><p>Peng Chengguang turned around and looked at Lou Cheng, squared away, and made the posture of invitation!</p><p>Four eyes contacted, as if to stimulate the spark and electricity in the middle of the air.</p><p>The four fighters in Azure Dragon Squad held their breath and seemed to feel the churning emotions between Lou Cheng and Peng Chengguang. Lin Que took a breath—rare for him to express regret, he only hated that his injury had not healed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
