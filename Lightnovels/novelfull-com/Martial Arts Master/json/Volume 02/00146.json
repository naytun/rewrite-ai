Is there really such a thing?” Lou Cheng disguised his shock as surprise.</p><p>Geezer Shi pushed aside the junk on the sofa and said, “Of course there is. However, it’s not the same as what you see on television, or read in novels. Neither is it as scary as the legends foretold. Hehe, in reality, a large majority of those legends were in fact describing top class physical invulnerability masters or restriction masters.”</p><p>“I see…” Lou Cheng seized the opportunity to ask what had been confounding him this whole time. “Where do the differences lie?”</p><p>“They could be counted as fighters at the beginning, but since their point of origin is different from fighters, their recognition towards one’s physical body, spirit, and the illusory soul is different as well, hence leading them onto a path different from ours. However, sigh, they ultimately failed to break through the threshold. Why do you want to know?” Geezer Shi said impatiently, “Give me your right hand.”</p><p>“I’m just curious, that’s all.” Lou Cheng smiled awkwardly before he passed over his right hand slowly.</p><p>Geezer Shi stretched out three fingers and placed it on top of his cunkou pulse. His half shut eyes glowed with a soft, blue glow as he pressed his injured parts and said, “It’s okay. You’ll not succeed in your attempt to become a one-armed hero, and you don’t even need acupuncture and moxibustion treatment. Take this ointment and apply it to your wound when you get back, and you can tentatively train your exertion a week later.”</p><p>“A week starting from today, you mean?” Lou Cheng asked in confirmation.</p><p>Does this mean that the remaining three and a half days of recuperation have been extended to a week?</p><p>“Aren’t you asking a redundant question?” Geezer Shi shot him a glare and said, “Now get going and do whatever you’re supposed to do.”</p><p>After Lou Cheng exited the teacher’s apartment and this area, his complexion slowly darkened. The news from his master had caught him by surprise and had created a burden in his heart.</p><p>I wonder if that Longhu Immortal is the original master of this Jindan in my stomach…</p><p>I wonder if my master’s friend would find out that there is an Immortal Cultivator legacy residence beneath Weishui Lake…</p><p>I wonder if they would find a clue and track it back to me…</p><p>“I had put stones into the black fish and tossed it back into the river. If it didn’t rot completely or was eaten by other organisms, then the marks are pretty obvious. However, there’re several tens of thousands of students in the new school campus area, and more than half a year has already passed since then. No matter how powerful a supernatural ability may be, they shouldn’t be able to trace me from the black fish…”</p><p>“I can’t be nervous. I can’t be panic and give myself away. I’ll just pretend that I know nothing and live my life as usual!”</p><p>“Mm, I’ll find a chance to squeeze the Jindan during these two days and see if I can awaken the Power of Frost. If it works, I’d have something that belongs to myself even if I was found out and had the Jindan taken away from me… they probably wouldn’t do anything to me out of respect to my master…”</p><p>The reason he wanted to awaken the Power of Frost was not to enhance the power of his blaze. It was because his master’s martial arts obviously belonged under the ‘Unique Skill of the Ice Sect.’ If he had the Power of Frost, then he’d be able to save a lot of time with better results when cultivated.</p><p>After making up his mind, Lou Cheng had almost regained his cool. With his current abilities, this was the best he could do in the face of such problems.</p><p>After putting away the ointment, he rushed straight to the third school building with his martial arts suit and other items that he had not put back into his dormitory, in his right hand. Right now there was still the chance that he might make it there in time.</p><p>As for the books and other items, he had told Little Ming to carry it for him a long time ago. As the saying goes, preparedness averts peril!</p><p>It was at this moment his cell phone rang with a melodious ring tone. He took it out and saw that it was a call from Cai Zongming.</p><p>“Damn, it can’t be that the roll call was brought ahead of time? There should still be a few minutes left before class begins!” Lou Cheng decided to answer the call despite his surprise.</p><p>“Cheng, your awesomeness is through the roof this time!” Cai Zongming pelted Lou Cheng with these words immediately after he answered the call.</p><p>Lou Cheng looked utterly dumbfounded. “What has happened?”</p><p>“You’re still pretending? Someone had even posted a video already. I dare not make the same claim about others, but even if you’ve turned to dust I’ll still be able to recognize you!” Cai Zongming let out a laugh while scolding him lightly.</p><p>“Video?” Lou Cheng roughly figured out what Talker was talking about now. He blurted out. “Is there really someone who would film videos even at a time like that?”</p><p>Cai Zongming laughed softly and said, “It’s not like you’ve never surfed the web before. You should know that some people would take a few selfies and post it to weibo, talk or friend circle even after they got into an accident. It’s their instinct to take photos and videos whenever something happens. However, I suppose that no one expected that someone would catch the suicider. The main focus was on the male student, while your figure in the video was a bit blurry and your face wasn’t overexposed either. Those who aren’t particularly close to you probably won’t be able to recognize you. Hehe, should I reveal this as an insider?”</p><p>He continued in a very excited tone, “You’re amazing, and I can’t believe you could catch a person who jumped down from the seventh floor. Even I’m a little impressed and looking forward to practicing martial arts now! Cheng, you’re probably famous in school now. I heard a lot of students talking about this along the way. They were all saying that you’re super cool and smart, and they’re filled with admiration for professional fighters. Alright, I’ll cut it short here. Professor Qu is here, and he’s probably going to do a roll call again. Hurry up. There aren’t many people today. I don’t think I can answer on your behalf this time.”</p><p>At first, Lou Cheng was secretly felt rather pleased with himself. Then his expression froze when he heard the end.</p><p>“Taker, stretch your neck before me when I arrive later.”</p><p>“What for?” Cai Zongming asked, puzzled by the bizarre request.</p><p>“That’s because I’m going to strangle you!” Lou Cheng said through gnashing teeth, “If it wasn’t because of your phone call I would’ve arrived already!”</p><p>The teacher’s apartment wasn’t far away from the school building. With his current running speed and abnormal level of stamina, he should be able to make it to the third school building in just two or three minutes. However, it was impossible to run as quick while speaking on the phone!</p><p>Cai Zongming said after falling silent for a dozen or so seconds,</p><p>“Good luck!”</p><p>He hung up quickly after saying this.</p><p>…</p><p>Shi Xiangyang enjoyed a beautiful afternoon nap, and when she heard the alarm she sat up and tidied up for a bit before slowly climbing down the bed. She looked at Li Liantong who was watching a video and said, “Dirty Tong, it’s almost time to leave already.”</p><p>“Alright.” Li Liantong closed her computer and tidied her hair for a bit. Then, she picked up the books beside her and began to leave.</p><p>Shi Xiangyang looked at her in astonishment. “Aren’t you going to wash and tidy a bit? Why are you in such a hurry?”</p><p>“I’m just a little confused, that’s all.” Li Liantong let out some dry laughs before setting down her books and rushing into the washroom.</p><p>Shi Xiangyang followed behind her and asked in puzzlement, “Why does Dirty Tong look super frightened?”</p><p>She shook her head and asked in concern after everything was done, “Are you okay, Dirty Tong?”</p><p>“Nothing! I’m fine!” Li Liantong said without any hesitation.</p><p>Shi Xiangyang had always been a carefree person, which was why she didn’t put it in her heart. However, on the way to the school building, she realized that Li Liantong kept looking like she wanted to say something with an extremely odd expression on her face.</p><p>“Dirty Tong, are you really okay?” Shi Xiangyang thought that something must have happened if even she could say affirmatively that the other party was acting weird!</p><p>Li Liantong opened her mouth for a moment before sighing. “You’ll know later.”</p><p>“I’ll know later?” Shi Xiangyang was baffled. Her heart itched as if a cat was scratching against it, but Li Liantong revealed nothing despite her ‘interrogation by torture’ like a hardened warrior.</p><p>After they entered the classroom, the duo sat beside a student whom they were relatively close with.</p><p>“Yangyang, have you seen that video?” the female student called Dong Mingshan gossiped and asked Shi Xiangyang.</p><p>“What video?” Shi Xiangyang was even more confused.</p><p>“Didn’t someone jump down a building this afternoon? I don’t know who caught the video at the time, but the male student who saved the suicider was so cool. Even I feel like attending the martial arts club and practice martial arts to strengthen myself!” Dong Mingshan said excitedly.</p><p>“Pooh, you’re not there to practice martial arts but to find that boy who practiced martial arts, aren’t you?” Shi Xiangyang mocked her before accepting Dong Mingshan’s cell phone. She started the video.</p><p>“Wow, he managed to catch him even in this situation? I don’t see any fire or lightning around him…” Shi Xiangyang then rewatched the video again. “He does look pretty cool, er…”</p><p>She suddenly froze. Abruptly, she turned around and looked at Li Liantong who had been unusually quiet until now. She finally understood why she was acting so strangely!</p><p>Was it him?</p><p>…</p><p>It was evening. Lou Cheng waited at Changqiaokou until Yan Zheke arrived. Then, he extended his left hand and grasped the girl’s icy cold hand in his own, giving some of his warmth to her.</p><p>Yan Zheke cast him a glance with a smile that was not quite a smile. “Cheng, you’re famous in our school now. There were a few girls in our class who praised that you look especially handsome when you’re saving a life. They were guessing if he was a certain leading player in the martial arts club, or a mysterious expert who hasn’t joined the martial arts club. Aren’t you delighted and pleased by this?”</p><p>“I’m a little happy and pleased by this…” was what Lou Cheng was going to say, but he could shake the nagging feeling that it wasn’t exactly the right thing to say. Therefore, he said with a smile, “I’ll only be especially pleased and happy when you’re the one who calls me handsome.”</p><p>“Humph.” Yan Zheke raised her head slightly with a smile in her eyes and said, “Lies!”</p><p>“On the contrary, it can’t be more real than it is!” Lou Cheng was telling the truth. It’s just that he didn’t tell all of the truth.</p><p>He immediately thanked his good fortune when he saw the girl’s happy reaction. He had the vague feeling that he nearly fell into a trap just now.</p><p>“Humph humph, I guess I’ll believe you this time.” Yan Zheke put on an ‘I’m just pitying you’ look before protesting coquettishly with a faint blush on her face. “I’m telling you, in the future you can’t just kiss me however you want!”</p><p>“Why are we emphasizing this again?” Lou Cheng’s mind twirled, and he put on a pitiful look and said, “But I want to get closer to you, always. I think that a kiss between couples is a wonderful thing. That’s how I feel at least…”</p><p>Yan Zheke humphed. “This is to teach you not to have a loose tongue!”</p><p>Lou Cheng immediately came to the realization. He understood that the girl wasn’t protesting against normal kissing. The fact that she hadn’t pushed him away back was clear proof of her acceptance.</p><p>However, she had kept her teeth tightly clenched all this time, and it was he who had opened her teeth with delicate force. Moreover, she had forcefully exited his embrace the second their tongues came into contact…</p><p>“I was wrong, Coach Yan. I was impulsive at the time.” Lou Cheng hastily admitted his fault when he understood his mistake.</p><p>“Humph, if it isn’t because you didn’t forcefully hold me down and pulled away the second I pushed you, I’d have ignored you!” Yan Zheke pouted slightly before letting out a sigh. She said in a soft voice, “Cheng, I know that guys and girls have different cognitions in certain things. I hope that you can respect my feelings and, hmm, work on our relationship.”</p><p>I guess this is the first time we have a small argument ever since we became associated with each other… Thank goodness she spoke out her mind frankly and did not hold it on the inside. Otherwise, I would not even know where I went wrong. A small argument can easily balloon into a large argument…” Lou Cheng was somewhat grateful for this conversation. He also very much liked the fact that the girl worked hard to communicate her thoughts rather than hold it on the inside and get angry. Hence, he said sincerely in slightly witty manner,</p><p>“There’s no need to work on anything. Everything Coach Yan says is correct, and everything will be according to Coach Yan’s will!”</p><p>Yan Zheke broke out in laughter at the joke, and her previous sigh vanishing completely.</p><p>“You must remember what you’ve said!” she broke into a slow run while pulling Lou Cheng’s hand. “Let’s get a seat quickly, or there won’t be one later!”</p><p>“Alright!” Lou Cheng ran with the girl into the canteen while he was filled with joy.</p><p>…</p><p>The next day morning, when the training was done and Geezer Shi had left, Lou Cheng purposely found a secluded place and began his plan to awaken his supernatural ability while facing Weishui Lake.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
