Of course, no issues with his physical stamina, just that his mental stamina was reaching its limits.</p><p>To tighten and pressurize certain muscles and to maintain control over them until reaching the enemy and exploding in full force was something that took up a lot of energy. Not to mention that during this process, the fighter still had to punch and attack.</p><p>With this battle, Lou Cheng estimated that the maximum number of times he could execute the Thunder Roar Zen was ten consecutive times. Anymore he would have physical strength but no mental power to do so anymore.</p><p>It was the reason why he did not try to entice Yan Zheke to continue to stay in the locker room and whisper sweet nothings. Instead, he took her suggestion to return early, take a nap and do some revision with her in the evening!</p><p>At this time, Cai Zongming and the rest were all missing. No one knew where they went. Lou Cheng lay on his bed, still excited and happy. He was unable to sleep, so he picked up his phone and started to check on his fan forum.</p><p>When he entered, he saw the Eternal Nightfall’s new comment: “It has replayed again and again! If I don’t see Lou Cheng soon, I’m going to die! Ahhhh! ”</p><p>Another lady, the Brahman, responded to her in a serious tone: “I want to call the TV station to complain!”</p><p>“Ay, shouldn’t you call to make a suggestion?” Nie Qiqi could not really comprehend the thoughts of the other young lady.</p><p>The Brahman sent a furious emoji and wrote, “Little Changye and I have already phoned in to suggest! But they’re not listening! I want to complain!”</p><p>“Eternal Nightfall” quickly replied: “Yes. Plus they said it so seriously, ‘Our apologies, this is the broadcasting arrangement of our TV station. Please check the broadcasting time and details.’ Heya, this formal tone is so well-done. Hahaha, I really dislike them!”</p><p>Lou Cheng felt like laughing after reading. He opened another post, and saw the Unparalleled Dragon King hiding. The Unparalleled Dragon King, a little afraid, wrote: “Never try to reason with girls, especially the two underaged kids!”</p><p>“Right, the generation gap is as deep as the Mariana Trench!” The Okamoto’s Fan wrote with a crying emoji. “But, to be honest, how can you be sure that they’re girls. Maybe with their pants off, they’re thicker and longer than you (joking emoji with moving hands)”</p><p>In the past few days, the few of them had tried to appease and console “Eternal Nightfall” and “Brahman”, the two girls, as much as possible. Sadly, they had failed terribly and pissed the two girls off.</p><p>“Ay, no live broadcasting? It’s not easy to accumulate those fans, and it would just get quiet from now since there were no more live broadcasts…” Lou Cheng sighed, exited the post and returned to the home page.</p><p>At this moment, he noticed a familiar ID appearing at the top of the posts:</p><p>“Lou Cheng’s Girlfriend”!</p><p>“Ke?” Lou Cheng was surprised and looked towards the title of the post subconsciously:</p><p>“(Video) Songcheng city division fourth round of preliminaries—Lou Cheng VS Peng Chengguang!”</p><p>“What video…” Curious and surprised, he clicked into the post and found that Yan Zheke only uploaded a video clip and three words:</p><p>“You’re very welcome!”</p><p>Lou Cheng was stunned. He chose to click play and watched himself walk up the ring, step by step, and Peng Chengguang was already in position, inviting Lou Cheng to the game.</p><p>The whole video clip was shot from a distance, so the facial expressions would be unclear. However, the person who was filming had very stable hands, which helped to make up for the distance. Because of the stable hands, the video image was very clear and time to time it would move to shoot the large screen. All these captured the tension and excitement completely.</p><p>“Looking at where it’s being shot from, and how fast Ke got it… She must have asked Dirty Tong to help shoot it…” Lou Cheng was pleasantly surprised when he figured out how the video came about. Then, Lou Cheng recalled how he sprinted two kilometers crazily just to be in time to record Yan Zheke’s first battle yesterday.</p><p>“When you do something for your lover wholeheartedly and if she does the same for you too…” Lou Cheng felt waves of warmth enveloping him. Undescribable emotions were flowing out from his heart, and he really wanted to run to Yan Zheke and hug her tightly.</p><p>The feeling is totally amazing!</p><p>He held his phone, smiled brightly and turned in his bed. He could not hold back his feelings and pulled out his call record and selected Yan Zheke’s phone number.</p><p>In just a few seconds, a sweet mechanic voice drifted into his ear.</p><p>“Sorry, the number you have dialed is engaged at the moment. Please try again later. ”</p><p>…</p><p>Yan Zheke stood on the balcony, looking out into the fine drizzle of rain, taking in the scent of spring.</p><p>“Hello, Mum? Why’re you calling me all of a sudden?” She took her phone, pretending to be taken by surprise.</p><p>At the other end of the phone, a light but matured voice said, “You, young lady, I’m your mother. I can call you whenever I miss you. Do I need any other reason to do so?”</p><p>Yan Zheke laughed gently and said, “Here I am, missing mum, you, every day, right? Plus, I just called you two days ago.”</p><p>“No matter how busy, there’s always time for my precious daughter.” The matured lady voice said good-naturedly. “I heard from your Uncle Xie that you have a boyfriend now?”</p><p>Yan Zheke wanted to answer “Of course not”, but she was also unwilling to deny the fact about “boyfriend”, so she said to her mum in a spoiled manner,</p><p>“You trust his nonsense! It’s all because Uncle brought Xie Tianque and the others before saying anything, putting me in such an awkward position. I was so annoyed, so I just asked for someone in the martial arts club to help…”</p><p>She subconsciously avoided the word “smokescreen.”</p><p>“Why would your martial arts club friend go with you to the Tiantong Taoist temple?” The matured lady asked in a non-pushy manner.</p><p>Yan Zheke was already ready with her counter statement. “He was there to see Cousin!”</p><p>The older lady sniggered and said, “Your cousin has mild autism, why would he have friends who would travel so far to visit him?”</p><p>“Mum, this, you don’t know well enough. This is camaraderie among the men!” Yan Zheke tried her best to be lively so that her mum would not pick up any hints. “He collaborated with Cousin and with attrition warfare, and they won a fighter with Eight Pin Dan stage. They probably appreciate each other very much.”</p><p>“He has professional Ninth Pin level? Haha, your cousin can only make friends with people doing martial arts.” The older lady seemed to no longer suspect their relationship. “Ke, your dad and I object that you have a relationship during college isn’t because we’re conservative. But we feel that real love should appear only after you have had a lot of experience in life, seen far and wide. Only then, can you understand truly what kind of relationship you want to be in.”</p><p>“And, Ke, have you forgotten your dream? Every time you tell us what you want to do in the future and what you intend to chase, you’re glowing, shining so brilliantly. Even I, as your mum, get jealous, and always worry about how some hooligans may cheat our little princess…”</p><p>Yan Zheke listened in silence, her lips arching upwards prettily, her dimples dancing in warmth.</p><p>She could only feel her mum’s love in all these statements. So she did not refute or argue, but only promised and said,</p><p>“Mum, don’t worry. I’ll not enter into a relationship so easily!”</p><p>Yes, I’ll not start a relationship “easily”. I’m very serious, very careful and loving the relationship!</p><p>…</p><p>Since the line was engaged, fatigue started to set in and Lou Cheng fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>An hour later, he woke up naturally and picked up his phone. He refreshed the page, wanting to see the responses to the post.</p><p>At the second floor, the Eternal Nightfall sent a jumping emoji: “I won’t thank, but I’ll just offer a bow. One bow!”</p><p>Brahman followed almost immediately: “Second bow!”</p><p>Nie Qiqi added: “Third bow!”</p><p>The Unparalleled Dragon King added a “face with a hand wiping cold sweat” emoji and wrote: “We’re just short of a ‘Returns from the family’ and we can play the funeral music already…”</p><p>After these few lines, they only added more comments a little later. Obviously, they went to watch the video.</p><p>“The secretive video made me feel like I’m watching an R rated video…” The Eternal Nightfall commented with a sniggering emoji. “To be honest, just two weeks without watching Lou Cheng in a match, I could hardly recognize him in the video. He is much more ferocious than before and become so much stronger…”</p><p>After her long admiration post, the Brahman sent a laughing emoji and wrote: “Little Nightfall, you’re getting dirtier and dirtier! Anyway that’s not the main point. The main point is that my idol is now better looking than ever! Better looking than ever! Better looking than ever! Important things must always be said three times! He fought with such manliness! (Very much charmed emoji)”</p><p>The Unparalleled Dragon King threw out some questions: “How come I don’t seem to be able to understand the competition anymore. There’re so many strange details in competition.”</p><p>At this moment, the Road to the Arena, who no one knew when he sneaked into the forum, wrote: “If I’m not wrong, Lou Cheng has already mastered a Tremor Punch!”</p><p>“Tremor Punch? No wonder!” The Unparalleled Dragon King sent an emoji hitting its thigh. “This explains why he’s a so different and changed man, just after two weeks. He has managed to master the Tremor Punch!”</p><p>This is a powerful martial arts move!</p><p>The Road to Arena sent a sly looking emoji and wrote: “Even if you pulled out all the Professional Ninth Pin in the country, Lou Cheng, with his Tremor Punch will probably rank in somewhere. Just that he has not competed much yet. If I were to battle him again, within three punches, I would probably shit in my pants! ”</p><p>“So it’s the Tremor Punch. Even though I don’t really understand, but it seems like it’s very powerful!” The Eternal Nightfall responded excitedly.</p><p>After some discussion, the Okamoto’s Fan wrote: “Come, come, come, everyone. To celebrate Lou Cheng mastering the Tremor Punch, I’ll continue to dispatch cars!”</p><p>“Tsk! You’re no driver!” The Unparalleled Dragon King “cursed” at him and then continued writing: “From the video, ‘Lou Cheng’s Girlfriend’ is from Songcheng University.”</p><p>“Yes.” The Lou Cheng’s Girlfriend chimed in with “good child sitting” emoji.</p><p>Lou Cheng’s heart skipped a beat when he saw this, and continued to read below.</p><p>“Really? Then do you know of any gossips? Does my idol have a girlfriend?” The Brahman asked curiously.</p><p>“Yes, he does!” Yan Zheke answered with a righteous looking emoji.</p><p>The Eternal Nightfall added to the discussion and wrote: “Who, who, who? Any photos? His classmate?”</p><p>“Me, of course! Just read my ID!” Yan Zheke sent a laughing with its hand over its mouth emoji.</p><p>“No one knows if you’re male or female…” The Unparalleled Dragon King sent the emoji with cold sweat again.</p><p>Yan Zheke responded immediately:</p><p>“Of course female, a pretty one!”</p><p>No one believed what she said. Only the Eternal Nightfall wrote enthusiastically:</p><p>“I’ll believe whatever you say! As long as you be a good undercover and provide us with inside stories on Lou Cheng’s development. I decided on one matter!”</p><p>“Father! I’m your long-lost son!”</p><p>After a bout of laughter and joking responses, The Lou Cheng’s Girlfriend did not appear again. The Brahman wrote in a despising manner: “Little Nightfall, you’ve chased her away with your dirtiness!”</p><p>“Where am I dirty?” The Eternal Nightfall asked in a wronged manner.</p><p>“Isn’t it dirty to just call anyone father?” The Brahman sent a laughing and hitting the floor emoji.</p><p>After reading till here, Lou Cheng exited the forum and went to give Yan Zheke a call, with the brightest smile.</p><p>About today’s victory, he was somewhat proud, but not arrogant. This was because he almost lost to Peng Chengguang who did not even have proper or any good martial arts skills. How about all those Professional Ninth Pin fighters with such power?</p><p>…</p><p>On the drive back, the four-member team of the Azure Dragon Squad was under great pressure, depressed and silent.</p><p>Suddenly, Deng Hua with a Mohican haircut said in a deep voice,</p><p>“I have an idea!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
