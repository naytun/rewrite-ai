However, he was a good-tempered otaku who always spent most of his time between his home and the martial arts school.</p><p>He actually wanted to take the opportunity to raid Lou Cheng and take out this strong enemy. But he also knew that Mo Zicong had forced himself to deliver the second “Elephant Trumpet”. It was weak enough that it could only bully some amateur fighters at best. As someone whose physical fitness had reached the level of Professional Ninth Pin, Lou Cheng wouldn’t be affected by the attack too much. At worst, he would experience a bit of dizziness and discomfort, maybe losing his sense of balance for several seconds.</p><p>Therefore, he really couldn’t say that he was confident in his ability to seize the opportunity and take out his opponent. If he was even a bit careless, then he would be forced to clash head-on against Lou Cheng, losing more than he gained.</p><p>Lou Cheng was a fighter who had reached the perfect level of Solemn Silence and had great control over his own body!</p><p>Zhu Tao stepped on the ground hard and pounced towards Sun Jian, like a cheetah. As his muscles bulged and his skin glowed greenish black, he twisted his waist and threw out a common but ferocious step-up Forward Punch.</p><p>He had watched the collection of battle videos of Songcheng University Martial Arts Club, and also found the videos about ranking events for several of the substitutes. He knew that Sun Jian was the strongest fighter among the four amateur fighters on the ring, even though he was also the most unlucky one, who failed the ranking event.</p><p>Sun Jian was struck by the roaring “Elephant Trumpet” and his tongue had also been in the wrong place, so it was too late to bite it again. Right now, he walked with an uneven stride, like in a cotton field, with shaky steps, barely keeping himself from falling on the ground.</p><p>Of course, he was only dizzy and uncomfortable instead of being in a daze or a coma. So, he still reacted to the sound attack of Zhu Tao timely. He bounced his back, shook his shoulder, pressing his right fist directly in the case he couldn’t stabilize his waist and was unable to fight with his legs.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Zhu Tao threw out a punch to stop his rush and weak attack as he also rushed to get in front of him. Sun Jian almost fell down as he tried to dodge because he lost his balance. Yan Zheke, Li Mao, and Lin Hua tried to rescue him, but with their shaky footsteps and staggering bodies, they had no choice but to watch the evil bald man lean his body slightly, using his left arm to throw a hook at Sun Jian’s lower abdomen.</p><p>Pooh! Zhu Tao timely controlled the force, to avoid the interference of the referee. Even though he had controlled his force, Sun Jian still felt a burst of pain, clutching his stomach as he fell to the ground. He was pulled away immediately by the referee, who was bending his body next to him, and was sent out of the ring to prevent him from incurring extra injuries when the others traded blows.</p><p>When this referee left the battlefield, at the edge of the ring, another referee immediately replaced his vacancy.</p><p>This was the reason this battle needed at least four referees!</p><p>When Zhu Tao seized the opportunity to defeat Sun Jian with his sound attack, Deng Hua, with the Mohawk hairstyle, also confronted Lin Que.</p><p>Although Deng Hua didn’t know enough about Lin Que’s unique skill, “Meteor force,” he still understood the great power of this skill because he had watched it make the Mighty One, Wei Shengtian, of the Professional Eighth Pin and Dan stage, shake all over and become paralyzed. After a feinting a movement in front of Lin Que, he slipped to Lin Que’s side, slightly bent his body, shook his muscles, twisted his waist, and threw an aggressive blast punch.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>As he launched this punch, there seemed to be a tiger roaring in the air. It was actually formed from the air turbulence produced when Deng Hua’s muscles were exerted, along with the sound produced by his breathing when he punched. Because the ferocity of this punch could be sensed from the roaring sound, it was called “Powerful Punch with Tiger Roar”.</p><p>Lin Que seemed to be in a hurry to stop Zhu Tao’s attack, so he didn’t parry. He bounced his spine explosively, leaned his body to the other side, jumped, and moved forwards rapidly.</p><p><em>“This is an opportunity!”</em> Deng Hua realized it at once, so he hooked the ground with his ten toes and exerted strong force to catch up with Lin Que. He cut downwards with his fist, towards the enemy’s right shoulder, so rapidly and violently that it even produced the roaring sound like a tigers roar or the sound of the wind.</p><p>He controlled his timing properly and precisely while Lin Que just stepped forward with his right foot, unable to kick behind himself. Lin Que also couldn’t defend by moving his arm backwards, so it was a little bit late for him to protect that vital spot and fight back against the enemy!</p><p>Even as a well-experienced fighter, Deng Hua still felt a trace of joy within his heart. <em>“If I can defeat Lin Que by taking advantage of his impatience and panic, I’ll be the first hero today and I can boast about this for years.”</em></p><p>Pooh! As soon as his cutting punch hit Lin Que, he noticed that Lin Que’s body was trembling as his blood and power seemed to shrink into his body. His shoulder also sank. With this trend, he dissipated most of the power from the punch with his shoulders that were shaking and bouncing.</p><p>Lin Que crawled forward to the right side and his body was like a seesaw. As long as he strengthened his qi and blood, twisted his waist, and moved his spine, his left leg could sweep backwards.</p><p>Pop!</p><p>His foot generated a strong sound of wind and made Deng Hua, who had less power after attacking with a strong punch just now, unable to dodge!</p><p>Deng Hua didn’t dare to disregard this attack. He stabilized his waist, set a good stance, and punched out with his left hand, like a hammer.</p><p>Bang! He felt the power of Lin Que’s attack was very strong, completely beyond his original estimation. His right arm was rebounded towards his ribs, as it confronted Lin Que’s kick, causing him to feel pain. It was difficult for him to maintain his center of gravity.</p><p>Yin-yang Twist included the force of the two parties.</p><p>And while his body was shaking, Lin Que turned around with the power of a Front Sweep. Lin Que’s temple suddenly bulged and his body seemed to be brewing a volcano.</p><p>Accompanied by the meteor flying through the sky in his mind, Lin Que swung his arm rapidly, quickly punching out his fist towards the middle of Lin Hua’s chest and abdomen.</p><p>He fought with high tension in the beginning, going all out in accordance with Yan Zheke’s plan, he pretended to rescue others but actually used it to counterattack his opponent.</p><p>As Deng Hua endured the pain in his ribs, he suddenly took a deep breath and sank his right arm, just in time to put it in front of the opponent’s fist.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>He suddenly felt like he had been hit by a hammer as the rapid shock spread all over his body, going as far as to influence his inner body. It seemed that even his teeth began to tremble and wanted to separate from his gums.</p><p>De, De, De… Deng Hua felt every muscle, muscle fascia, and bone was unstable, so he was unable to use his power at that time. But he spat out the breath that he just sucked in, visualized the corresponding image, and created a reverse vortex like a wind tunnel to eliminate most of the shock.</p><p>While Deng Hua was enduring the uncomfortable feeling and his rolling qi and blood, his head suddenly shrank and his body rolled backwards, just barely escaping from the front sweeping lash of Lin Que’s left arm.</p><p>He dared not fight directly with his opponent, so he took this opportunity to flash to the side like a civet.</p><p>After he escaped from Lin Que’s attack successfully, he realized that he was very fortunate to survive such a dangerous situation!</p><p>Lin Que stopped pretending, exerting force into his two legs as his spine wriggled up and down like a dragon. He suddenly rushed to the side after his left arm has already set up, using his elbow as a weapon.</p><p>Deng Hua dodged successively, then walked around and kept fighting with Lin Que. Although his fighting range was growing smaller under the active attack of his opponent, he still showed no sign of failure.</p><p>At this moment, Zhu Tao had already rushed in front of Yan Zheke. His glowing black skin bulging, he exerted force into his two legs and punched out suddenly and powerfully. He totally ignored Li Mao and Lin Hua behind him.</p><p><em>After defeating Sun Jian, of course, I have to deal with this beauty who can pull back her center of gravity and control the ability of meditation. And it was said that she is Lou Cheng’s girlfriend, so fighting with her could influence the emotion of my greatest enemy effectively.</em></p><p><em>If there are only two amateur fighters left among the amateur members of Songcheng University Martial Arts Club, I won’t be afraid at all. Even if they’re all fighters of Amateur First Pin, I can defeat them easily!</em></p><p><em>The two “Elephant Trumpet” and sound attacks at the beginning decided the result.</em></p><p>Pa! The black brick under Zhu Tao’s feet cracked. His fist punched out like a real hammer, making bombing sounds.</p><p>Yan Zheke had recovered a little and she knew that as long as she could block the blow that she could get rescued by her partners. So she didn’t panic and she took a quick breath. Then she held back her uncomfortable feeling, stabilized her waist, and set up her arms to defend herself.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As soon as she stopped Zhu Tao’s fist, she also took a step backwards in order to counteract his attack.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, she should barely be able to resist this punch. But she failed because of the follow-up attacks from her opponent. Also, because her condition in all respects hadn’t completely been adjusted and her attacking and defending powers were not enough after just recovering from “Elephant Trumpet”.</p><p>After she stopped for an instant, she could not bear but once again step back. Her light and agile body began staggering.</p><p>Lou Cheng had already recovered before Zhu Tao defeated Sun Jian. When he saw that Yan Zheke was in danger, he seemed to rush to her without thinking, like an eagle opening its wings in order to attack the back of his enemy. This strategy was called “relieve the besieged by besieging the base of the besiegers”.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Mo Zicong, who just got his breath back, felt a little happy after he noticed that Lou Cheng had made the most unwise choice because he was so worried about his girlfriend.</p><p>He exerted force into his two fierce and powerful legs and immediately rushed to Li Mao, who was attacking Zhu Tao. He wanted to take the opportunity, while Li Mao was still influenced by “Elephant Trumpet,” to defeat him quickly.</p><p>As long as Lou Cheng couldn’t beat Zhu Tao within one or two hits, then the situation could be reversed!</p><p>And Zhu Tao was not a fool. Once he found Lou Cheng was about to attack him, he would certainly give up Yan Zheke and begin to fight with Lou Cheng by working around instead of trading blows with him.</p><p><em>You’re still too tender and young!</em></p><p>However, at this time, he saw Lou Cheng, who was rushing forwards, suddenly step on the ground and break the black brick. He rebounded and turned around with this stepping force. He rushed towards him aggressively, looking as though he had prepared for this for a long time or like he had expected this situation before because he controlled the time so properly that it made him unable to dodge on time.</p><p><em>“In accordance with the guidance from “Coach Yan,” once she is in danger, we can’t rush to rescue her because that would only cause chaos and give our opponents the opportunity to fish in troubled waters. The best choice is pretending to rescue her but actually attacking the enemy…”</em> Lou Cheng thought this in his mind. He had adjusted his muscles before he rushed to Zhu Tao, so now he was finished with his preparations.</p><p>Confronted by with Lou Cheng, with cold eyes and an unstoppable attack, Mo Zicong took a deep breath, exerted his strength, and prepared to fight back directly.</p><p>He noticed that although Lou Cheng was able to use “Tremor Punch” continuously, the power of each punch was weaker than Lin Que’s.</p><p><em>I don’t believe that I can’t defend against a single “Tremor Punch”! I don’t believe I can’t find an opportunity to dodge!</em></p><p>As he meditated and visualized, his muscles shook and his abdomen sent out the sound of the Elephant Trumpet, which was deep but had no effect on his enemy. His two hands gripped together as if he was seizing a “giant elephant.” He exerted force into his legs, straightened his twist, threw his arms ferociously, and hit towards Lou Cheng.</p><p>Crack. A lot of cracks spread out on the ground, like a spider web.</p><p>This was “Throwing Elephant,” which meant the power of an elephant!</p><p>Lou Cheng’s eyes looked like an icy lake as he also visualized a scene where the river was turbulent within his mind.</p><p>While he rushed to the front of Mo Zicong, he stepped on the ground hard, twisted his back, bounced his spine, and started off with a Mountain Blast Punch.</p><p>At the same time, the cold current in his body started to flow towards his right fist as the “big river” within his heart began rapidly freezing, inch by inch. Even the crystal clear spray which had splashed into mid-air froze.</p><p>He threw out a punch which containing Frost Force!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
