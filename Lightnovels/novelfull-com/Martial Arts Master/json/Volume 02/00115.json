You must be prudent and not arrogant in your competition tomorrow.”</p><p>Fang Tong’s hair was combed straight up looking wanton and arrogant. His angular face made him an imposing figure and even playing children would quiet when they saw him. Without expression he replied,</p><p>“Yes, Grandmaster.”</p><p>Seeing his attitude, Wang Hui quietly sighed. This disciple was good, at everything, but he was also too impatient and anxious. This meant, there was no way for him to attain a united form of strength, and while he was capable of releasing energy, he was not able to withdraw it. Even though he was only one step away from Dan stage, in three years, he wasn’t able to improve. This had dropped him from the status of a slightly reputable genius fighter in Songcheng to an after tea joke at other martial arts schools.</p><p>They could only hope that Cheng Yun’s rapid improvement would put pressure on him and he would shake off his arrogance and impatience…</p><p>While looking around, Wang Hui told Pan Chengyun,</p><p>“You have not participated in the last three months and those three months were when you would have progressed the quickest. Your enemy certainly can’t touch your bottom line, and will still treat you as a fighter of Amateur First Pin. But, you mustn’t be careless. Usually, practices with Guosheng and Fang Tong are different from an arena battle. You have to adapt to the changes and master your new strength, just in case, the difference throws you off.”</p><p>Finishing, before Pan Chengyun could answer, he replied with emotion,</p><p>“This is an excellent opportunity for our martial arts school. You have to go all out in the fights for the fame.”</p><p>And fame equals money!</p><p>Through underground gang connections, the martial arts school received benefits. In a larger city, the connections are hidden and harder to find.</p><p>Because of the attention of the public, the focus of the media, and the involvement of the government, all aspects of the Songcheng was more standardized and legal when compared to the small cities. Many martial arts clubs wouldn’t dare to waste their own staff, so they made their fortune by exploiting their wealthy students.</p><p>With out a good reputation for fame, it would be hard to recruit disciples, and after many years they would shut down, or have to take a risk.</p><p>In addition, talented and high-quality disciples are sought after to produce a reputation of fame. Without the reputation for fame, no one will choose your martial arts studio for an apprenticeship.</p><p>In today’s society, the creation of a warrior is actually established in two major steps. The first is at their primary school graduation when a child begins to develop physically. This is when they can begin practicing martial arts and go through a unified test. The test would identify the specific martial arts specialization they would be placed in. The second part is normal schooling, which every person should receive to run a society. People of all talents are needed, not just warriors and some jobs are considered more important, like a scientist’s.</p><p>After the evaluation, unless the family is wealthy and able to pay the high fees related to practicing martial arts, most of the students give up practicing. They look for other activities to spend their energy on. This is why Lou Cheng hadn’t met many martial arts fighters and the ones he did were mostly amateurs.</p><p>Most of the martial arts schools were established by the state, where they could pull resources to fill their organizational needs. These state run schools create an assembly line of fighters to fill the military forces and the police department. In light of this, the Shangqing Sect, Longhu Club, and other forces had also opened their own martial arts school. They did this to cultivate a large number of disciples, by creating a reputation. For example, Jin Tao of the “Invincible Punch” was a student from the Jiuqu Branch of Haiyuan Martial Arts School.</p><p>However, even though there are lots of martial arts school, when compared to the number of suitable students, there were not enough. The schools would only take students on merit, so it appeared talent driven and some of the students were “late bloomers.” Maybe around fourteen or fifteen years old and even some as late as seventeen or eighteen would slowly start to show their talents. So, the martial arts school took this second opportunity to conduct another exam.</p><p>The form of martial arts club in cultivating a large number of fighters was lagged. But if only a few like a dozen disciples could take the elite education, it was the same as the martial arts master’s transmission, which was better than the martial arts school. And therefore it built a lot of illustrious famous experts. So many young people carrying dreams, who could not enter the major martial arts forces, would abandon the martial arts school and take the embassy of the martial arts club.</p><p>So, the martial arts club regarded talented disciples as the core, and even began to pay the disciples of Amateur First Pin a certain salary to maintain their own strength. And then through advertising, trials, and local challenge tournaments, etc. to gain fame, they attracted external hobbies and wealthy disciples, which could not only get the money, but also might pick out talented people buried by a variety of reasons, develop their social relationships and get other opportunities to make money.</p><p>They spoke of martial arts, but it was actually a business.</p><p>And as a business, it would be weird if they were not enthusiastic about the local and peripheral television broadcast preliminaries!</p><p>Who did not like free “ads”?</p><p>…</p><p>Humming pop songs, Lou Cheng went back to the dormitory. With the same beautiful feeling brought by drinking some wine, he felt that everything was very good. He couldn’t wait for everyone to have the same happiness as his own.</p><p>He knocked on the next door, with no surprise to see the rich kid Qin Mo and his girlfriend Mu Yuanxing not being there. The “game fantastic” Tang Wen was diligent with his study. Last time he was so addicted to playing games to forget the date when he should take the exam nearly. If people around were not in the same class to take the exam, he would have definitely failed the exam for this ridiculous reason. Of course, no doubt, he still failed in three subjects. Now he was preparing for school examinations again, or he would have to rebuild. So he gave up games for a while.</p><p>“Where is Mouth King?” Lou Cheng asked.</p><p>Tang Wen was absorbed in books. He carefully recalled and said, “He went to the balcony to call his girlfriend.”</p><p>“Oh.” Lou Cheng calmed down, vaguely hearing a voice from the balcony.</p><p>Saying thanks, he closed the dormitory door not to disturb Tang Wen. When he was about to return to his own small dormitory, he saw the balcony glass door opening. Cai Zongming came in with a smile.</p><p>“Damn the weather! Making a phone call can freeze you!” Little Ming breathed out white air when he closed the door.</p><p>Lou Cheng laughed. “Why don’t you video chat in the bedroom?”</p><p>“Someone is in the bedroom, so some private words are not convenient to say, you know.” Cai Zongming deliberately rose his brow.</p><p>“You dirty guy!” Lou Cheng scolded, with a humorous tone.</p><p>“Pooh! You are the dirty guy! I mean nauseating love words. What did you think of? Recently fallen in love, blood calls?” Cai Zongming scolded Lou Cheng badly but in a good way.</p><p>Lou Cheng clicked his tongue and said, “Are your love words clean? Old hand!”</p><p>He then checked his surroundings, and said softly, “Casanova, you tell me if there is any problem…”</p><p>He said all the things of Yan Zheke’s reactions in their first date, and finally said, “Will this seem disrespectful of her thoughts, too reckless?”</p><p>Cai Zongming replied with a laugh, “Darn your indiscriminate love! You wouldn’t have any of these questions, if you followed my steps. But you did a good job today. You can’t let girls lead you in this case. You go fast!”</p><p>“Really?” Lou Cheng got into a serious student attitude.</p><p>Cai Zongming grinned, “Your Goddess is now in a state like standing on the swamp. There are full of temptations in the world of love below. It’s difficult to resist, but give up resistance, and slowly sink. She has not adjusted the mind yet, so she slows this speed and adapts this gradually. If you pull too fast and make her sink too fast, out of fear, uncertainty, or inadequate love, it really will cause a rebellious sense and may let her start to hate you.”</p><p>“But you can’t do nothing, let her make her own mentality. Only ghost knows what adjustments she’ll make, maybe good, maybe not. Furthermore, when it takes longer, the feelings of the impact will get weak. She’s going to calm down and start over again. If you think about enhancing the good impression then, it’ll be Half the Results for Twice the Effort and she might say that she doesn’t think you are the ones for each other and should better break up.”</p><p>“So you have to seize the current state of warmth, limit the distance, and enhance a good impression, which is the meaning of hot ironsmith. You can’t really do not get close when girls say so. Sometimes they themselves don’t know if they want it or not.”</p><p>Lou Cheng had the feeling of reading for ten years. He sincerely nodded. “No wonder you are Casanova…”</p><p>Cai Zongming said with smiling, “To answer the confession is to determine the relationship, and to determine the relationship is equal to holding the hand. For this, she’ll not be too resistant. She should have some psychological preparation. But don’t go further. Don’t give her pressure which causes rebellion. Keep the trend, step by step with the affectionate, and slowly pull her over. Hey, even I am jealous!”</p><p>“Unfortunately, you have no time to go to the Capital.” Lou Cheng glared at Little Ming with pity.</p><p>Cai Zongming clicked his tongue and said, “I can’t go, but she can come! I have succeeded to confuse her. This time I don’t have to save money. The lucky money is big! ”</p><p>“Cool!” Giving a thumbs up, Lou Cheng said,</p><p>“Right, are you ready for tomorrow competition” As a member of the special training, Cai Zongming cared about this.</p><p>Lou Cheng nodded with a smile and said, “Almost, I’ll think through it again.”</p><p>“I’ll help you find the audience.” Laughing badly, Cai Zongming suddenly went outside, unscrewed the door, and said to Zhao Qiang, Qiu Zhigao and Zhang Jingye who were relaxing at home on weekends, “Good news! Good news! Cheng will represent our Songcheng University to participate in the competition tomorrow. Let’s go to cheer him up!”</p><p>“On behalf of Songcheng University? Cheng?” Zhao Qiang stunned, and then pushed his black box glasses.</p><p>“Martial Arts Competition?” Qiu Zhigao surprisedly turned his head.</p><p>Only Zhang Jingye looked dumb, like he didn’t seem to understand.</p><p>Cai Zongming grinned. “Yes, Martial Arts Competition. Didn’t Coach Shi organize to participate in the preliminaries of the team? Cheng is the leading player. Tomorrow, he’ll compete with Hongluo Martial Arts School of Songcheng.”</p><p>Qiu Zhigao did not take the first three martial arts lessons because of his own arrangements, so he didn’t know anything about this. He suddenly stood up, surprisedly and shockedly staring at Lou Cheng who was behind Cai Zongming. “Are you the leading player?”</p><p>Is this a little unscientific? No, not a little, it is too unscientific!</p><p>Lou Cheng didn’t have to explain. Cai Zongming smiled and said, “Cheng is recognized as a genius in martial arts, and now he is of Professional Ninth Pin. That day he fought so badly with Lin Que. He lost by one step.”</p><p>“Professional Ninth Pin…” Qiu Zhigao breathed in.</p><p>For the difficulty of enhancing the rank, he had a profound experience.</p><p>A new with no rank to being of Professional Ninth Pin actually only spent half a year!</p><p>“A genius in martial arts?” Zhao Qiang looked at Lou Cheng up and down, like wanting to see flowers out from him. “You don’t know yourself before?”</p><p>“Well, I did not get in touch with the martial arts before, and Coach Shi is very professional.” Lou Cheng said casually.</p><p>Zhao Qiang exclaimed. “Human, of course, rely on self-struggle, but also have to consider the process of the history…”</p><p>“The competition is at three o’clock tomorrow afternoon. Are you coming?” Cai Zongming asked again.</p><p>“Of course, I’m going! Why not? An expert from our dormitory! It’s so cool to say!” Qiu Zhigao came over with excitement and coax.</p><p>Zhang Jingye hesitated and stammered. “Can I take someone else?”</p><p>“Whom?” Zhao Qiang asked with bewilderment.</p><p>Cai Zongming cackled and said, “Model Worker, I can’t see huh. You get a girlfriend in silence?”</p><p>“Haha, almost.” Zhang Jingye smiled simply.</p><p>“Sh*t…” Zhao Qiang blurted out, pointing to Zhang Jingye. “I figured out the dog not barking bites hard. When did you get a girlfriend?”</p><p>Lou Cheng also had a burst of admiration. He spent so much time and effort to catch Yan Zheke, but Zhang Jingye suddenly got a girlfriend!</p><p>“Oh, last term, when I came back, I met a bunch of students in the art school making micro-video. Due to curiosity, I watched for a while. They invited me to do the extras, so I met one of the girls, and then we got familiar…” Zhang Jingye simply said.</p><p>After everyone sighed, Zhao Qiang seriously said, “Model Worker, you have to learn even though you have a girlfriend. You can’t indulge in beauty. Right, when do they make the next micro-video?”</p><p>Puff! Everyone laughed together, and the atmosphere became quite warm.</p><p>…</p><p>Yan Zheke finished washing and climbed to her own small bed, leaning on the minion. Covered in the quilt, she unlocked the phone.</p><p>Her smile consciously appeared. She was waiting to use QQ to send Lou Cheng a message. Suddenly she remembered a matter, so she clicked the browser, and got into the search page.</p><p>“Meimei bread…” She entered the name of the cake shop. She would like to see if the comments of fresh cream cake were as good as Lou Cheng said.</p><p>During a blink of an eye, the search results came out, but Yan Zheke got confused.</p><p>Because there were no search results of Meimei Bakery, but only related adjectives.</p><p>“Online search…” Yan Zheke got an idea. She seemed to understand something. Getting out of the quilt, she climbed down and tasted the fresh cream cake on the desk.</p><p>“Not too sweet, just as well…” Yan Zheke sat there. Her left hand was gently hanging around the hair. Her right hand was holding a spoon, unconsciously shaking. There were two sugar plums around her mouth. Her eyes were staring at the cake, with the tender that couldn’t be spoken.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
