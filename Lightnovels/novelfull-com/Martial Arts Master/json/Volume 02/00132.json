They all became as silent as clay puppets, so there was an eerie and extreme silence surrounding the whole arena.</p><p>The invincible Wei Shengtian of Yimo lost… He was beaten!</p><p>Although he had lost an attrition warfare against two strong Professional Ninth Pin fighters, how could he not beat two Professional Ninth Pin fighters if he was known as invincible in Yimo?</p><p>After a brief silence, the audience came to themselves. They realized they were looked down and provoked, and so they immediately exploded into a storm of angry roars as they flung all kinds of classic swears and abuses such as f*ck, bullsh*t and s*cker.</p><p>Lou Cheng put down his fingers. He was delighted with the extreme silence where no one out of ten thousand people dared to respond to him just now. He also didn’t care for the abuses he was experiencing right now. The fiercer they scolded, the more they exposed their earlier meekness and accentuated the earlier silence. It was as a famous saying goes: the enemy’s abuses and slanders is a sign that you have achieved great success!</p><p>No wonder master said that it was awesome to fight until all the audience fell silent and was unable to speak.</p><p>So awesome!</p><p>…</p><p>Li Mao, Sun Jian, Lin Hua, Guo Qing and other members who sat on the seat were surprised for a while, but not until the referee officially announced the result that they all stood up with hands up, ignoring the audience, cheering loudly. They were so glad that they lost the usual calmness and even looked a little crazy.</p><p>They had been suppressed for too long time!</p><p>Not to mention Lou Cheng himself on the ring, even as onlookers, they were suffering from that fight. Lou Cheng had been beaten down several times and he was in the abyss of despair. However, he struggled to fight against his opponent once again and again and ultimately grasped the opportunity for him to win the game. At last, he beat his opponent who was considered as an invincible Lord.</p><p>When they finally relieved from the nervous atmosphere, they felt so relaxed and excited just like having eaten ginseng fruit that thousands of pores in their body had opened and breathed comfortably!</p><p>The more difficult the battle was, the more excited and happier you would feel when you won!</p><p>While Coach Shi has encouraged them in the locker room, they were also fuming in anger with their fighting spirit soaring a lot. They still held no hope to beat away the impenetrable fortress of the Fearless Squad. Even though there were two strong fighters of Professional Ninth Pin, they were still afraid of their opponent because he was of Professional eighth Pin and even reached to the Dan Stage.</p><p>However, Lou Cheng and Lin Que, they together really created a miracle!</p><p>How much they had denied themselves at first made how surprised they were now!</p><p>Yan Zheke cheered for him with her clench fists and she cried out all the apprehension, tension, uneasiness, expectation, surprise and excitement and all kinds of emotions just like she won the fight. Her cheeks became red because of excitement and her eyes became so bright that made her more beautiful and attractive.</p><p>After seeing Lou Cheng showed the shut-up gesture to all the audience, she suddenly restrained her ecstasy. She looked at Lou Cheng so gently and her sight was as clear and tender as water. She also smiled with her sweet dimple and felt a kind of peace which seemed like there was only Lou Cheng and her in the whole world.</p><p>At that time, she vaguely heard that Coach Shi was whispering something. He seemed to say “They really win the game… I just plan to give them some encouragement…”</p><p>“Uh, did he say this was a small target just now?” Yan Zheke thought to herself.</p><p>Lin Que, who also cared much about the result and had been staring at the ring during the fight, sipped his mouth and loosened his clenched fist.</p><p>…</p><p>While in the studio, the commentator, He Xiaowei and the TV host looked at each other and couldn’t speak a word. They had seen the embarrassment on each other’s face. And every word they said before was so different from the reality as if the words were mercilessly slapping their face.</p><p>After a brief stagnation, He Xiaowei became serious and he said like nothing happened,</p><p>“For the rest of our time, I’ll analyze what happened just now. Through this replay scene, we can clearly see that Wei Shengtian has been hit hard, and his body seemed to shake a little. It’s reasonable to believe that hit by Tremor force which exploded like bomb brought a lot of impact to his body, making his blood boil over and influencing his vital organs.</p><p>“Of course, Tremor force should not have caused such a big impact to an expert of Eighth Pin and in the Dan stage, but I’ve been aware of one thing before. Director, please replay the scene when Wei Shengtian was fighting with Lin Que…”</p><p>“As we have watched, Wei Shengtian also appeared still in this fight, but resolved it by his ability as a fighter in Dan stage. In the last fierce collision with Lin Que, he was certainly hurt and his internal organs became unstable, which made him weaker as the fight went on. Ultimately, he was influenced by the Tremor force from Lou Cheng which also affected his internal injury. So at last, he gradually lost his energy and failed.</p><p>“While Lou Cheng played this combat very vicious and calm, he almost seized every opportunity whether when he was in the disadvantage position or so close to winning. Of course, he was lucky enough to fall down on the place where some gravels were left in the last fight.</p><p>“As for the question about whether this action civilized or not, I only say it once, martial arts itself is the most uncivilized thing. Every movement of it is created to kill or hurt the opponents rather than play a game. If a fighter doesn’t know how to use the environment, he’d better go back home to nurse his child.”</p><p>“All in all, this is a victory that we should congratulate. This victory is due to a little luck but due to most of his ability.</p><p>Hearing of these, the TV host was stunned and looked at He Xiaowei as if he were a monster. It seemed that he felt unbelievable and his eyes were asking, “You didn’t say that just now! How can you slap your own face!”</p><p>He Xiaowei looked him back casually and cursed in a low voice “Too young, too simple”.</p><p>Do you think it’s easy for me to become a well-known commentator?</p><p>This is an impetuous society. If you want to become famous, you have to be extreme. You have to talk extremely to shock the audience!</p><p>How many people scolding and ridiculing you means how much fame you have, and fame equals to money!</p><p>Even though I’ve seen something, I’d still say the opposite. If you comment in a straight and narrow way, how could you stand out from those ordinary people?</p><p>There even is a song which sings about it, called Exaggeration.</p><p>As for self-esteem, is it more important than money? If you gave me several million, I’ll curse myself to die in a minute. If you don’t understand how to roll with the punches, how would you be a good commentator?</p><p>And that’s why you’re just a local TV host, while I’m famous across the country!</p><p>While he was thinking these, he still kept commenting.</p><p>“Now, Fearless Squad should be nervous. It seems that Lou Cheng should be at the end of his rope after he played so fiercely just now. But if the following fighter, Dong Yi of Fearless Squad, really thinks so, he would then definitely lose. According to the statistics, Lou Cheng owns great physical strength, and maybe he has such kind of talent!”</p><p>…</p><p>In the personal forum of Lou Cheng, the living posts had broken out. Yan Xiaoling and Brahman constantly posted to show their excitement, joy and pleasure. As for the content of posts, they were all about meaningless modal articles and all kinds of praising sentences. They hoped to use all the appreciative words to praise Lou Cheng, and they particularly liked the shut-up posture.</p><p>After watching so many posts, Yan Xiaoling suddenly realized.</p><p>“Wait a minute, I remember that somebody updated a post just now which said if Lou Cheng won the game, he’d send resource torrent. And there’s a man said that if Lou Cheng won, he would celebrate it by streaking around!”</p><p>It had been a long time for the Unparalleled Dragon King to reply and he wrote: “Having watching such a wonderful game which has twists and turns, now I’m waiting for the streaking video!”</p><p>“Hoping to watch it online!” Nie Qiqi also said happily. There was nothing happier than to see Lou Cheng beat a powerful enemy and have something fun to boo.</p><p>Even some IDs who always kept silent also said that they were waiting for the streaking.</p><p>After a while, the Okamoto’s Fan wrote: “I’m the man who has said that he would send the resource torrent. As soon as the fight is over, I’ll update it!”</p><p>“Di, student card.” Yan Xiaoling said with adding highly colored details, “I find the guy who said he was going to streak, come out now! @ All Good Names Are Taken by Dogs.”</p><p>“All Good Names Are Taken by Dogs” said weakly,</p><p>“… I, I’ll go to the bathroom to streak around, and there will be no live show!”</p><p>“Despise you.” All the people replied the same.</p><p>…</p><p>In the dormitory of Lou Cheng, Cai Zongming and other roommates also couldn’t help but cheer loudly and celebrated heartily.</p><p>People all knew how strong his enemy through the consecutive two matches was, who was considered as an invincible fighter. However, Cheng still beat him down. Even though the process was full of danger and he was so close to lose, but at last he still won the match.</p><p>The more dangerous the process was, the better the taste of victory was!</p><p>“I even couldn’t recognize Cheng on the ring. He’s so great…” Cai Zongming said.</p><p>Qin Mo agreed and said, “Thinking of a fighter who can slap me to die always treats me so well, now I feel unreal and unbelievable…”</p><p>…</p><p>When Wei Shengtian was kicked out of the ring, the members of Fearless Squad were silent and they seemed to have collective illusions.</p><p>Over ten seconds later, Dong Yi threw away his jacket, stood up suddenly, and walked towards the ring leaving his members in bewilderment.</p><p>At that time, Wei Shengtian who majored in Bright Stone Style had stood up, rubbed his chest, floated around to the ring stone steps. He stopped Dong Yi and whispered, “Be careful, he has unlimited stamina. It seems that he didn’t lose any energy at all.”</p><p>Dong Yi startled for a while and looked up to the ring. He did not know why, but his feelings suddenly welled up in his heart.</p><p>Ever since Fearless Squad was set up, people were mostly concerned about and discussed Wei Shengtian, the invincible fighter in Yimo, or Qiu Yang, the talented young fighter. Few of people would talk about me. In the game I had participated, it was indeed difficult for me to play an important role.</p><p>But this time, because Wei Shengtian was beaten down, and Qiu Yang was injured and our opponent was so powerful, it is me that can take the burden to save our team from losing this fight!</p><p>He took a deep breath, nodded to Wei Shengtian, and then proudly stepped on the stone steps.</p><p>I’m also a fighter of Professional Ninth Pin! I’m better than any fighter of the same level with me!</p><p>…</p><p>When Wei Shengtian just returned to his seat, Qiu Yang asked him with concern,</p><p>“Brother Wei, are you okay?”</p><p>Wei Shengtian shook his head. “I’m okay, only got some minor injuries. Not serious.”</p><p>“Do you think that Brother Dong can beat Lou Cheng?” Qiu Yang asked anxiously.</p><p>Wei Shengtian watched the ring for a while and paused to say,</p><p>“I don’t know…”</p><p>…</p><p>Seeing Dong Yi has got on the ring, Yan Zheke sat down and looked forward to the second fight of Lou Cheng.</p><p>Among all the people in this arena, only Coach Shi and I know how great his stamina is. So as long as he was not injured in the last fight, then he would also be full of energy and has a fair chance of winning this fight.</p><p>“Do we really can win the fight with Fearless Squad…” she whispered to herself.</p><p>Geezer Shi agreed, “That depends on the dignity of the other party.”</p><p>…</p><p>On the ring, Lou Cheng stood still and waited for Dong Yi to close in step by step.</p><p>At this moment, he was full of energy and was confident of his ability.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
