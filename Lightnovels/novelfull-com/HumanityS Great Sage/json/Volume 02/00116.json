Instead, he slashed at the young man fiercely! A fiery-red light flashed across the blade of his knife, making his knife seem as though it was on fire.</p><p>The young man was clearly taken aback by Lu Ye‚Äôs ferocity. He hurriedly changed the trajectory of his sword, lifting his sword to block the attack instead. There was a loud clashing sound. When their blades interlocked for a moment, his sword nearly flew out of his hands and he was pushed back by that force. The shock in his eyes intensified. Before he could do anything, the knife in Lu Ye‚Äôs hands came slashing down upon him like a tempest.</p><p>Ever since Lu Ye left Green Cloud Mountain, he would resolutely practice his swordsmanship for at least four hours a day as long as the conditions allowed. While this training might not allow him to master any special or mysterious sword techniques or skills, it had made his foundation become more and more solid.</p><p>Coupled with the experience he accumulated from the battles over the past few days, he was no longer the same greenhorn who left Green Cloud Mountain back then. He had slowly formed a fighting style of his own. It was fierce and vicious. That was because he could rely on the Protection Spiritual Pattern. ùóáùû∏ùëΩùêûùê•ùêßùî¢xt.ùìíùíêùî™</p><p>If the young man had not hurriedly changed his move to block the first attack just now, he would have been cut in half by that blow. His prudence had allowed him to escape death, but that was all‚Ä¶</p><p>The clashing sounds rang out incessantly. Every slash that landed would force him back by three steps. Moreover, his wrist was beginning to crack under the impact of that mighty force. He wailed inwardly, [Where did this lunatic come from!? How can he fight so aggressively!? I am also in the Fourth-Order Spirit Creek Realm, but I am significantly weaker than him!]</p><p>Whenever his opponent attacked, the vitality around his opponent‚Äôs body would surge greatly. It gave him the illusion that the person in front of him was a wild beast that escaped from a cage and was choosing its prey to devour.</p><p>Out of the corner of his eyes, he could see his two Junior Brothers flanking his opponent from behind. He would be able to join forces with his two Junior Brothers to besiege his opponent as long as he persevered for a few more seconds. While backing away, he reached his hand toward his Storage Bag. He had just taken out a Spirit Talisman Paper and was just about to activate the Spirit Talisman Paper when he heard a cracking sound‚Ä¶</p><p>He was shocked. Out of the corner of his eyes, he saw that his longsword had broken into two. The broken blade flew out to the side. Immediately after that, his body went numb and he froze in place. Then, his field of vision began to tilt. The last thing that came into view was one half of a body that looked very familiar.</p><p>[Is that my body?] His consciousness began to fade.</p><p>When the blood splattered everywhere, Amber‚Äôs tiger roar came from the right. It was immediately followed by a terrified scream. There was another sound of something slicing through the air on the left. The enemy hiding in the shadows had shot another arrow at Lu Ye again. It was just that this arrow missed its target. The death of that young man seemed to have shaken the attacker‚Äôs mental state. That person was not the only one who was unsettled. The other two cultivators not far away who had rushed up behind Lu Ye were similarly shaken.</p><p>There were a total of five cultivators on this mountain peak. One was in the Fourth-Order Spirit Creek Realm; two were in the Third-Order Spirit Creek Realm; and two were in the Second-Order Spirit Creek Realm.</p><p>This line-up was not that strong, but Tai Luo Clan was right behind them. That was why there was no need for them to have such a strong line-up. As long as the mountain peaks in front were not lost, the Green Feather Mountain cultivators would not reach this place. This position could be said to be the safest location.</p><p>The only reason they left some people here to keep guard was just in case, but this originally fool-proof arrangement was destroyed by Lu Ye‚Äôs arrival.</p><p>The two Tai Luo Clan cultivators who had sneaked up behind Lu Ye felt as though they had been splashed with a basin of cold water. Their entire bodies were ice cold. They had just witnessed their Senior Brother in the Fourth-Order Spirit Creek Realm being cut in two by an uninvited guest in no more than five seconds. Therefore, their shock and panic had risen to extreme levels. This in turn caused them to abruptly halt in their tracks at a position less than 10 meters away from Lu Ye.</p><p>Lu Ye spun around, his knife pointing diagonally at the ground. Blood was dripping from his blade. He pushed off the ground with both feet, leaving behind a hole in the ground where he stood before. It didn‚Äôt take more than a few strides for him to arrive in front of the two Tai Luo Clan cultivators who were frozen stiff in terror.</p><p>At a juncture of life and death, these two finally burst out their potential and lunged at Lu Ye all at once. The sounds of their confrontation clanged loudly. The two cultivators in the Third-Order Spirit Creek Realm leaned back, leaving themselves wide open. The difference in their cultivation left them unable to block Lu Ye‚Äôs attacks despite working together.</p><p>The long knife blessed with Spiritual Power drew a long arc of fiery red light in front of him. He didn‚Äôt even bother to use the Sharp Edge spiritual Pattern in this attack. When the screams rang out, the chests of the two people struck by the blow split open and a faint burnt smell came from their wounds. One person collapsed to the ground while the other person staggered backward.</p><p>He took a step forward and stabbed the cultivator who fell over backward in the chest. Without stopping, he pulled out his knife to slash at the other person. Then, he saw an arrow flying toward him out of the corner of his eye. Lifting his knife in a swinging slash, he cut down the arrow. He was just about to deal with the surviving Third-Order Spirit Realm Master, but that person had already collapsed headfirst to the ground. His previous attack had slashed right through that person‚Äôs heart‚Ä¶</p><p>An extremely terrified scream came from the side. Lu Ye turned his head to look and saw Amber biting a female cultivator in the neck. The female cultivator held a bow in her hand, blood spurting wildly from her mouth. Despite struggling desperately against Amber, she couldn‚Äôt even make Amber budge in the slightest.</p><p>This female cultivator was only in the Second-Order Spirit Creek Realm. She was the one hiding in the trees and shooting arrows at Lu Ye.</p><p>When Amber separated from Lu Ye earlier, it immediately ran straight in this direction. The tiger alone might not have been able to do anything to her. She was hiding up in a tree after all. However, things were different with Yi Yi around. Yi Yi had appeared directly behind the female cultivator and shoved the latter off the tree.</p><p>After following Lu Ye for all this while, Amber had been eating well every day. Who knew how many Spirit Restoring Pills it had consumed during this period? Therefore, its current strength had greatly improved compared to before. With Yi Yi‚Äôs support, they easily took down the Second-Order Spirit Creek Realm Master.</p><p>Ignoring the female cultivator, Lu Ye looked to the side. Two people had attacked him with arrows just now. Amber had caught one in its mouth, so there was another one. To his surprise, he discovered that the other party had already fled nearly as far as 30 meters away when he looked over in that direction.</p><p>He raised his knife and was about to give chase when he suddenly remembered something. Raising his hand, he faced his palm toward that person‚Äôs back. At the same time, fiery red Spiritual Power began to gather at the palm of his hand. The pure Spiritual Power then formed into a fat and pudgy Fire Quail, which flapped its wings and flew forward like an arrow released from the bowstring.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Fire Quail brushed past the fleeing cultivator and hit a large tree. The tree went up in flames.</p><p>[I missed‚Ä¶] He raised an eyebrow, Spiritual Power gathering in the palm of his hand again. This time around, he adjusted his aim slightly.</p><p>A second Fire Quail flew out and struck that person squarely in the back. There was a loud explosion. That person fell to the ground as if he was struck by a bolt of lightning. His back was a charred mess, and he twitched several times before he died.</p><p>This was one of the Spell Techniques that came with the Red Lotus Sky Mnemonic. It turned out to be quite powerful.</p><p>Just then, a small red light flew over from that spot and sank into the back of Lu Ye‚Äôs hand. He glanced around, frowning. ‚ÄúWhat the Hell!?‚Äù</p><p>This battle came out of nowhere. He simply answered the other party‚Äôs password wrongly and the other party instantly attacked without mercy. They didn‚Äôt even bother to ask him which faction he belonged to. Since the other party had not held back, he did not bother to restrain himself either. It wasn‚Äôt until he finished killing them all that he became certain that these people belonged to the Thousand Demon Ridge faction. It looked like he had not killed the wrong people.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
