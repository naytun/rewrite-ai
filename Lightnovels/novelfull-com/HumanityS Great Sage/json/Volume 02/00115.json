Occupying so many mountain peaks in the early stages of the Dragon Spring Conference might not necessarily be a good thing. In this way, Green Feather Mountain had to spread out its strength to guard these hills.</p><p>Now that ten mountain peaks had been lost in a row, Green Feather Mountain’s defenses were strengthened instead. It would be difficult for the Tai Luo Clan to proceed any further. Besides, Green Feather Mountain did not lose many men. The cultivators originally guarding those mountain peaks did not choose to fight recklessly after sensing the strength of the enemy forces, which preserved a large part of their strength.</p><p>The current disadvantage was only temporary. It could not determine the final result.</p><p>After several days of confrontation, Green Feather Mountain was obviously going to start a counterattack. There was an area on the topographic map reflected by the Shadow Moon Disk where blue and black dotted lights intersected. Fierce battles had broken out on several of the mountain peaks. The cultivators from both sides were tangled together in battle and some of the dotted lights would be extinguished from time to time.</p><p>The blue dots were the cultivators of Green Feather Mountain while the black dots were the Tai Luo Clan. As for the red dots, they represented the Qin Family.</p><p>The gazes of Tang Wu and the other two were focused on the place of confrontation. They were judging the pros and cons of the situation from the remaining number of dotted lights. Han Zhe Yue’s expression gradually became gloomy. That was because the Tai Luo Clan was clearly at a disadvantage in this confrontation.</p><p>An hour later, the outcome of the battle came out. Green Feather Mountain had regained two mountain peaks!</p><p>Han Zhe Yue immediately became unhappy and coldly snorted. “A bunch of trash!”</p><p>Tang Wu stood there as motionlessly as a mountain, showing neither joy nor anxiety.</p><p>“A rogue cultivator just barged into the fray,” Qin Wan Li suddenly said.</p><p>Tang Wu and Han Zhe Yue turned to look at the same time and immediately noticed the addition of a white dot that had appeared on the edge of the Shadow Moon Disc.</p><p>“Fourth-Order Spirit Creek Realm…” Han Zhe Yue quickly determined the other party’s cultivation from the brightness of the white dot. She curled her lips into a smile. “This guy is pretty unlucky.”</p><p>The reason for her words was that the location where that white dot had appeared was the territory of the Tai Luo Clan. A large part of the continuous mountain range in that area was occupied by the Tai Luo Clan. Moreover, there were at least five or six black dots on each mountain peak that stayed behind to guard the place. A Fourth-Order Spirit Creek Realm Master was not considered weak in this area, but he was by no means powerful either. He could be defeated by any random Fifth-Order Spirit Creek Realm Master.</p><p>One Hundred Peaks was very large, so it was impossible for the three factions to waste their resources to seal off the entire One Hundred Peaks during the Dragon Spring Conference. Besides, the rogue cultivators nearby knew that the Dragon Spring Conference was currently being held here. Aside from the rogue cultivators summoned by Green Feather Mountain, nobody else would suddenly barge into the area.</p><p>Naturally, there were always exceptions to everything. The Dragon Spring Conference had been held so many times before. It was not as though no rogue cultivator had accidentally barged into One Hundred Peaks during the Dragon Spring Conference. It was just that those rogue cultivators never enjoyed a good ending.</p><p>If he had intruded into the area occupied by Green Feather Mountain, he might have been recruited by Green Feather Mountain. Unfortunately, those who intruded into the area occupied by either the Tai Luo Clan or the Qin Family… there was no saving them anymore.</p><p>Due to the previous contract, Green Feather Mountain could recruit these outsiders as helpers. However, the Tai Luo Clan and the Qin Family could only use their own strength to prevent any problems before they happened. Therefore, the Tai Luo Clan and the Qin Family would never allow any outsider to roam the One Hundred Peaks alive.</p><p>“Guess which faction he is from.” Han Zhe Yue looked at the white dot with interest. As a Ninth-Order Spirit Creek Realm Master, she had no choice but to return to host the Dragon Spring Conference. It was actually a very boring event for her. Since she could neither kill nor beat up these weaklings, she could only find other things to amuse her on her own.</p><p>Qin Wan Li chuckled. “He will belong to whichever faction you say he belongs to, Senior Sister Han.” 𝗇𝞸𝑽𝐞𝐥𝐧𝔢xt.𝓒𝒐𝔪</p><p>His response was equivalent to him not saying anything at all.</p><p>“Tang Wu, what about you?” She lifted her head to glance at Tang Wu.</p><p>Tang Wu didn’t even bother to acknowledge her, which made her pout. “Wooden pillar!” Then, she turned to look at Qin Wan Li. “Do you want to make a bet?”</p><p>Qin Wan Li said, “It’s rare for you to be interested in something, Senior Sister Han. This Junior Brother will keep you company.”</p><p>“200 Contribution!” She suddenly became excited.</p><p>“Cough, cough…” He abruptly coughed violently. “Let’s play a small wager for entertainment only.”</p><p>After saying that, he didn’t even give her a chance to respond. He immediately continued, “I’ll wager 20 Contribution points that this person is associated with the Thousand Demon Ridge!”</p><p>She snorted softly, her interest flagging slightly. “How boring!”</p><p>She leaned her body back and threw her hands into the air, leaning back against the chair in a spread-eagle pose. Her womanly charms were on full display, and her posture invited one’s imagination to go wild. There was not the slightest shred of a Ninth-Order Spirit Creek Realm Master’s demeanor in her behavior.</p><p>“200 Contribution points that he is from the Grand Sky Coalition!” Tang Wu, who had been silent all this while, suddenly spoke up.</p><p>Han Zhe Yue immediately got up and glanced at Tang Wu. She pursed her lips into a charming smile. “Alright! I’ll bet against you!”</p><p>“May the Heavens Witness!”</p><p>“May the Heavens Witness!”</p><p>In an instant, three pairs of eyes focused on the white dot. They watched as the white dot approached the nearest mountain peak at an extremely fast speed.</p><p>Sitting atop the tiger’s back, Lu Ye frowned. He did not know if he was only imagining things, but he felt as though he was being watched. It was just that a careful check of his surroundings revealed nothing. This made him become vigilant, and he even recalled Yi Yi, who was picking medicinal herbs nearby.</p><p>As they continued forward, they did not meet with any incidents until they climbed the nearest mountain peak. Amber suddenly stopped in its tracks.</p><p>Lu Ye, who was sitting atop the tiger’s back, pressed his right hand against the hilt of his knife. He secretly activated his Spiritual Power. Amber also crouched down low and let out a deep growl. There was an ambush here.</p><p>.</p><p>Lu Ye had clearly noticed the fact that he had fallen into someone else’s ambush. He did not know who was hiding in ambush here, why they had set up an ambush here, or even what the other party’s cultivation was. The current situation was very disadvantageous for him.</p><p>Wind blew across the mountain top, making the leaves rustle in the wind. A person’s voice suddenly rang out from not far away. “Lightning!”</p><p>Lu Ye immediately turned to look in the direction of the voice and saw a young man sitting among the branches of a large tree. The young man was quietly looking at him, and it was this young man who spoke just now. Activating his Spiritual Power, he studied the aura around the other party’s body. It was a Fourth-Order Spirit Creek Realm Master!</p><p>Frowning, he tentatively asked, “Thunder?”</p><p>There was a sound of something slicing through the air. Lu Ye hurriedly ducked his head. Two sharp arrows narrowly passed over the top of his head from both left and right directions. Several strands of his hair fell to the ground. The other party had attacked without warning. If not for the fact that he had experienced many life-and-death struggles recently, he would not have been able to avoid that attack just now. It was obvious that he had wrongly answered the other party’s secret password. The people hiding in ambush here were extremely decisive and immediately attacked when the secret password was answered wrongly.</p><p>Meanwhile, Amber was already charging toward the left. Lu Ye kicked off from the tiger’s back, leaping straight into the air. Blocking an arrow shot toward his head when he was suspended in mid-air, he fixed his gaze upon the young man who spoke earlier.</p><p>At the same time as those attacks were launched, that young man had leaped off the tree. A longsword appeared in his hand as he lunged toward Lu Ye.</p><p>Lu Ye had just landed on the ground and the young man had already closed the distance between them. The longsword stabbed forward like a snake sticking its tongue out, aiming directly for Lu Ye’s chest. The young man was really going in for the kill because of a single wrong answer.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
