Lu Ye was currently sitting crosslegged on a tall platform in front of the Sanctum of Providence.</p><p>Tens of meters away from the platform, countless cultivators were standing and watching Lu Ye with an expectant look on their faces. These Spirit Creek Realm cultivators might not know much about the Gift of Providence, but their seniors knew that there was a high chance Lu Yi Ye of the Crimson Blood Sect might qualify for it. It was because most of the enemies he killed were one or more cultivation levels higher than him. That was why they had ordered their Spirit Creek Realm cultivators to gather at the Crimson Blood Sects Outpost.</p><p>No one knew exactly how the Gift of Providence would benefit a cultivator, but they certainly werent going to miss the bestowment.</p><p>Even if they were wrong, and the Gift of Providence eluded Lu Ye after all, it wouldnt be a huge loss to the youngsters. At worst, they would lose a few days they couldve spent on cultivating their power.</p><p>Right now, the Outpost was perfectly silent even though it was holding thousands and thousands of people. On the platform, Lu Ye could not help but feel a bit of pressure.</p><p>This was supposed to be a normal occurrence, but thousands of people had come to witness his ascension. He knew he was famous, but he did not realize exactly how influential he was in the Spirit Creek Battlefield until now.</p><p>Top 10 English Verbs for Conversati‚Ä¶</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>Top 10 English Verbs for Conversations on Adventure Sports and Extreme Activities</p><p>He recalled what his second senior sister told him to dispel some of the pressure. She had told him to put the Gift of Providence out of his mind because the decision to obtain it was ultimately not in his hands. If he obtained it, then all was well. If he didnt, it wasnt like it would affect his cultivation or his Way. He would still strive to be the cultivator he wished to be, wouldnt he?</p><p>A bit of pressure was alleviated from his mind when he thought this.</p><p>The nine Microcosmic Orbits in his body slowed to a halt. His cultivation level began dropping as well. It would continue until his Spiritual Power stopped flowing completely.</p><p>He had witnessed Ju Jias ascension to the Cloud River Realm at the Myriad Poison Forest, so he knew that the process was smooth and easy. As long as he had enough Spiritual Points, all he needed to do was to connect all his Spiritual Points in accordance to his cultivation technique and form a Cosmic Orbit. He would naturally ascend to the Cloud River Realm then.</p><p>Lu Ye knew what he needed to do. While recalling the details of the Great Sun Veluriyam Technique, he began channeling his Spiritual Power and connecting his Spiritual Points as per the cultivation technique dictated one by one. His slumbering Spiritual Power began to flow faster and stronger as more and more Spiritual Points became connected.</p><p>Finally, when all three hundred and sixty Spiritual Points were joined together, the massive stream of Spiritual Power finally poured back into his Source Spiritual Point.</p><p>With this, he had officially formed a Cosmic Orbit inside his body.</p><p>A buzz came from within Lu Yes body. The flow of Spiritual Power sounded like that of a rampaging river.</p><p>An invisible shockwave that spanned the entire Outpost swept out of his body, and just like that, he had ascended to the Cloud River Realm!</p><p>When Ju Jia had ascended to the Cloud River Realm, the Heavens had immediately booted him out of the Spirit Creek Battlefield and to headquarters Sanctum of Providence. Lu Ye was feeling the same thing right now. He suddenly felt as if he was shoved into a tiny hole, and the very space around him was trying to eject him from the Spirit Creek Battlefield.</p><p>Suddenly, a mysterious power descended from the Heavens. The next thing he knew, the rejection was no more.</p><p>It really is the Gift of Providence! Someone exclaimed in shock.</p><p>Although their elders had already informed them about the possibility, there was no telling if Lu Ye would actually receive the Gift of Providence until it happened. Now, they knew their elders were right.</p><p>A rainbow-colored lotus was descending from the sky. It was not a physical object but more like an illusion, though it was definitely composed of some sort of energy. ùíçùíäùôóùìªùíÜùì™ùôô.ùôòùô§ùô¢</p><p>The moment the lotus appeared, a unique fragrance abruptly filled the air. It cleared the mind and made everyone feel lighter.</p><p>The rainbow lotus descended right on top of Lu Ye. At first glance, it looked as if Lu Ye was sitting at the center of the lotus. As it spun slowly, Lu Yes surroundings turned flowery and illusory all of a sudden. The way the petals kept appearing and vanishing were beyond fascinating!</p><p>A strange energy instantly permeated the entire Outpost.</p><p>The smarter ones tried to inhale the strange energy and immediately discovered that it strengthened both their body and their mind. someone immediately cried out, Cultivate! We need to cultivate now!</p><p>All cultivators on the ground immediately dropped to their feet and began cultivating. The ones in the air quickly found a place to land and did the same.</p><p>Less than thirty breaths after the rainbow lotus descended, all two to three thousand people in the Outpost had entered a cultivation state.</p><p>They could clearly feel the strange energy slowly strengthening their body and mind. They were overjoyed as a matter of course. They knew that they had made the right choice to visit the Crimson Blood Sects Outpost.</p><p>Lu Ye was seated in the middle of the lotus, so he felt the spilling energy even more so than the others. After the rejection force had disappeared, he could clearly sense a warm and gentle energy pouring into him. It was tempering his body and strengthening his divine soul at the same time.</p><p>It was similar to when he was absorbing the Spirit Mist in the Pool of Heavens, but the benefits were far greater. To make a comparison, he could barely feel the Spirit Mists strengthening effects during his fourth visit. The Gift of Providence though, he could feel it enhancing his body and soul at visible rate.</p><p>Time passed bit by bit. The entire Outpost was so silent one could hear a pin drop.</p><p>At some point, the cultivators slowly opened their eyes and discovered that the platform was empty, and Lu Ye was nowhere to be seen. They knew then that the young man had ascended to the Cloud River Realm and left.</p><p>More and more cultivators were opening their eyes and checking their bodies. It wasnt long before everyone was grinning from ear to ear.</p><p>Practically everyone had benefited from the Gift of Providence. Not only were their bodies and minds stronger than before, some of them had even unlocked Spiritual Points that had remained locked for a long time. Even more people discovered that the concentration of Pill Poison in their bodies had decreased, and their Spiritual Power was purer than before.</p><p>For a time, they could not help but wonder just how much Lu Ye had benefited from the Gift of Providence as he was its main target. One thing was certain, Lu Ye was stronger than ever before.</p><p>The Grand Sky Coalition cultivators werent the only ones who were celebrating Lu Yes ascension. The Thousand Demon Ridge was cheering and dancing like crazy as well.</p><p>And why were they in a celebratory mood. It was because the One Leaf of the Three Banes of Spirit Creek had finally left the Spirit Creek Battlefield!</p><p>Just now, Lu Yi Yes name had suddenly vanished from the Scroll of Supremacy before being replaced by Lan Zi Yi of the Infinite Island.</p><p>There was no chance in hell that Lu Yi Ye had died a sudden death, so the bastard could only have ascended to the Cloud River Realm.</p><p>Countless Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators felt like crying when they learned this. Finally, the sonuvabitch was gone from the Spirit Creek Battlefield. No longer did they have to worry about a single cultivator dominating the entire battlefield anymore.</p><p>It was like an oppressive mountain had suddenly been lifted off their shoulders. For the longest time, it felt like their spines were broken, and every action they took must factor Lu Yi Ye into the equation. Now? They could finally stand straight and do whatever they wanted!</p><p>To put it simply, the responsibility of killing Lu Yi Ye now fell on their Cloud River Realm seniors, not them!</p><p>It was a day worth celebrating and memorizing. Countless people suddenly remembered how to smile again, and some people nearly almost cracked out the musical instruments to celebrate his departure.</p><p>Unfortunately, their cheer was dampened all too quickly. It wasnt long before they heard that Lu Yi Ye had obtained the Gift of Providence when ascending to the Cloud River Realm!</p><p>The Gift of Providence represented the attention and acknowledgement of the Heavens themselves. Since ancient times, only a handful of cultivators had ever obtained the Gift of Providence, and every single one of them was incredibly accomplished in their cultivation journey.</p><p>In fact, the last cultivator to receive the Gift of Providence had come from the Crimson Blood Sect. The sonuvabitch had even crushed them so badly that their own parents couldnt recognize them. If he hadnt been too straight-laced and inflexible in the end, they would still be hiding in a corner of the world and jumping at their own shadows.</p><p>The news soured the Thousand Demon Ridges good mood immediately. Even at the end, the bastard just could not leave without giving them one last middle finger, could he? Heavens dammit</p><p>Lu Ye was back at the headquarters. He was currently sitting in the Sanctum of Providence and checking his body.</p><p>After connecting all three hundred and sixty Spiritual Points and forming a Cosmic Orbit in his body, his Spiritual Power was flowing like a river. Not only was he far stronger than he was before, the speed at which his Spiritual Power was flowing was way better than it used to be!</p><p>Something didnt feel right though. The Gift of Providence had greatly enhanced his body and his mind. To make a comparison, it was about equal to the first two trips to the Pool of Heavens. But was this all?</p><p>He did not know what his first senior brother had gotten when he had received his Gift of Providence because there wasnt a detailed record of the event. Shui Yuan was also too young to recognize the signs at the time.</p><p>One thing was certain, the reward he received did not match the Gift of Providences legendary status.</p><p>[Maybe theres a hidden reward that Ill only recognize when I visit the Cloud River Battlefield or something?] Lu Ye consoled himself.</p><p>After checking his Comic Orbit again and confirming that everything was running as smooth as butter, he rose to his feet just in time to feel a disturbance from his Battlefield Imprint. He checked it and realized that it was time to meet his artificer.</p><p>He hurriedly pressed a hand to the Divine Opportunity Column and connected his mind to the Vault of Providence. He quickly appeared in the small room once more.</p><p>(Patreon)&gt;&gt;</p><p>The source of this content is ùìµùíäùì´ùìªùìÆùì™ùíÖ.ùì¨ùì∏ùô¢</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
