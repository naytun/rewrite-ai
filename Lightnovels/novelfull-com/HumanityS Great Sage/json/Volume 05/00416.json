Not only could she treat the ill and slay the wicked, the wicked wouldnt even find out that she was their killer until it was too late.</p><p>However, Lu Ye wasnt sure if she could help considering the odds that were pitted against them.</p><p>Outside the Myriad Poison Forest, Lu Ye was in a terse stand-off against two hundred plus Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators. Since Lu Ye wasnt moving, of course the Thousand Demon Ridge wasnt moving either. It wasnt because they didnt want to kill Lu Ye, but because their numbers were lacking. If they were to charge him now, he was one hundred percent going to run away again.</p><p>Dragging out this stand-off was advantageous for the Thousand Demon Ridge because it meant that their comrades would have more time to assemble.</p><p>Of course, they hoped that Lu Ye would attack them. That would save them all the trouble of having to chase and entrap him. There was no way he could defeat the two hundred of them no matter what he tried.</p><p>Besides that, there were flying Spirit Beasts circling the sky and constantly transporting more Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators over.</p><p>Gordon Ryan‚Äôs Journey to Five A‚Ä¶</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>Gordon Ryan‚Äôs Journey to Five ADCC World Championships!</p><p>Someone shouted from the line of Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators, You cant escape, Lu Yi Ye! Just get over here and accept your death already!</p><p>Lu Ye ignored the taunt and continued chewing his Healing Pills.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ye looked up at his enemies. They were looking a little restless all of a sudden.</p><p>Meanwhile, at the Thousand Demon Ridges defense line, a good number of people were holding a hand to their ear with a puzzled expression. It was because they were hearing odd noises from the forest behind them.</p><p>Whats that? Someone asked while looking behind them. However, the Myriad Poison Forest was covered in a poisonous fog. It was impossible to see much without going deeper.</p><p>More people tried to listen for the strange noise. It wasnt long before they heard what sounded like a series of rustling noises; something like what one might hear when a many-legged insect was crawling across the ground. They could also hear the faint buzzing of wings.</p><p>Whoosh</p><p>Suddenly, an incredible amount of moths and butterflies rushed out of the poisonous fog. They were headed straight toward the Thousand Demon Ridges defense line.</p><p>Everyone in the area blanched immediately. The Myriad Poison Forest wasnt just filled with poisonous fog. It was covered in deadly creatures as well. ùëôùíæùí∑ùò≥ùò¶ùò¢ùò•.ùí∏ùëúùòÆ</p><p>When Lu Ye was still trapped in the Myriad Poison Forest, a lot of people had ventured into the forest to drag him out of his hidey-hole. However, all they found were a ton of deadly creatures and plants. Some of them had even died as a result of such encounters.</p><p>These colorful moths and butterflies were among the most poisonous creatures in the forest. They werent too deadly, but they scattered a kind of dust that would cause even a cultivator to feel itchy all over. It would be an extremely unpleasant experience if nothing else.</p><p>That was why the Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators panicked and scattered as soon as they saw the moths and butterflies. Some were even hitting them with their Spirit Artifacts.</p><p>Dont attack them! Just dodge! Someone yelled in panic.</p><p>The insects did not discharge much dust if they werent attacked. But if they were, then the amount would increase considerably.</p><p>Without their Spiritual Power to protect them, a cultivator could hardly avoid the tiny, near invisible dust no matter how fast they were. Countless people were inflicted with a terrible itchiness instantly!</p><p>While the Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators were falling into disarray due to the massive amount of moths and butterflies, a cry suddenly broke out, Spiders!</p><p>A Thousand Demon Ridge cultivator who was busy scratching his itch yelled, This is the Myriad Poison Forest! Of course there are spiders!</p><p>He was going to say more, but then he saw what his fellow cultivator had and abruptly paused in his tracks. Fear slowly crept onto his face.</p><p>It was perfectly normal to find a spider or two outside the Myriad Poison Forest. But what if there were hundreds, thousands? And what if they were all headed their way?</p><p>That wasnt all. They also saw scorpions, ants, venomous toads, venomous snakes and more creatures that they had never even seen before. It was like the creatures of the Myriad Poison Forest had chosen today of all days to have a group exit!</p><p>The grassy ground was crawling with these creatures. It was literally impossible to count them all. There were even forty-meter long giant boas that spat out a kind of green fog in the mix. Any cultivator who inhaled the fog would literally turn green in the face before falling to the ground, unable to move a muscle.</p><p>The Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators screamed and ran and screamed as they tried to avoid the stampede of poisonous creatures. Many times, someone would accidentally step on an insect and was rewarded with a puff of aquamarine smoke to the face. Countless people suffered, and chaos reigned supreme for a time.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lu Ye was already riding Amber toward a gap in the defense line.</p><p>He did not know how Hua Ci had done this, but it was clear that she was the one who caused this stampede. He had no idea she possessed such an ability.</p><p>The Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators on the ground were unable to pay attention to Lu Yi Ye. How could they when their very lives were in grave danger?</p><p>The aerial scouts were the only ones who noticed the young mans movement, but their numbers were too few to delay Lu Ye for even an instant. They had no choice but to watch Lu Ye getting closer and closer to the Myriad Poison Forest until finally, they lost track of him.</p><p>With this, the Thousand Demon Ridges operation to kill Lu Yi Ye had ended in failure once more. He had succeeded in escaping into the forest last time, and now it had happened yet. It would seem that history had repeated itself.</p><p>Unlike the last time though, it was pure luck that saved his life instead of an unknown skill. For whatever reason, the natives of the Myriad Poison Forest had chosen today of all days to stampede. As a result, the Thousand Demon Ridges formation was completely annihilated.</p><p>But was it really luck that saved Lu Yi Ye?</p><p>It was impossible not to suspect that the combat cultivator had something to do with the stampede, although they were unable to figure out exactly what he did. Lu Yi Ye was at least a full kilometer away from the Myriad Poison Forest at the time. He literally did nothing besides resting on his tigers back and chewing his pills. Even if he was the culprit behind the stampede, he could not have done it from so far away.</p><p>That said, it was too coincidental. Also, they still hadnt figured out how Lu Yi Ye managed to stay in the Myriad Poison Forest for days.</p><p>The first time he was trapped in the forest, the Thousand Demon Ridge believed that it was only a matter of time before he died. Now, no one was expecting anything.</p><p>Inside the Myriad Poison Forest, Lu Ye and Amber didnt go far before they saw a familiar figure waving at them. It was of course Hua Ci.</p><p>After Amber trotted up to the medicine cultivator, and Lu Ye pulled her up its back, she asked seriously, Are you hurt badly?</p><p>She was serious because both Lu Ye and Amber looked absolutely horrible. Lu Yes upper torso was covered in wounds, and his pants were dyed red with blood.</p><p>Theyre just flesh wounds.</p><p>Hua Ci let out a sigh of relief.</p><p>An hour later, they finally returned to the wooden building.</p><p>Before the Yuan Metal Storm occurred, the wooden building was protected by a defensive ward. Nothing could enter it so long as it had Spiritual Power.</p><p>Besides that, Lu Ye had left behind a Central Ward as well.</p><p>However, the defensive ward had stopped working because the World Spiritual Qi was frozen solid. Naturally, the place was now as poisonous as everywhere else in the forest.</p><p>Lu Ye was immune to poison since he had the Tree of Glyphs. He was safe as long as it had fuel. However, Amber did not have such an ability, and it wasnt like Hua Ci could stay by its side twenty-four seven. Not in its current form anyway.</p><p>Amber cant change forms now, can he? Hua Ci asked.</p><p>If Amber could assume its cat form, then she would be able to carry it at all times and shield it from the poison.</p><p>Give me a moment, Lu Ye said before connecting his mind to the Scroll of Supremacy. He was currently the champion, followed by the female archer he had fought before and a Grand Sky Coalition cultivator from a Tier-One sect in Ding Zhou named Han Tiejun.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Ye had never crossed paths with this man. It was fine though. He simply needed to find someone who knew him and asked them to carry a message for him.</p><p>Amber was unable to switch forms because it required Spiritual Power to perform, and the entire Spirit Creek Battlefield was covered in the Yuan Metal Storm right now. However, the Scroll of Supremacys battlefield was different. He had already confirmed that it wasnt affected by the Yuan Metal Storm.</p><p>He looked inside his Battlefield Imprint and sent out a dozen or so messages. A while later, he received a challenge request.</p><p>Lu Ye accepted the request and chose the terrain. His figure immediately turned transparent.</p><p>Lu Ye and a now aquamarine-colored Amber appeared in the battlefield at the same time. Standing on the opposite side was a young man with a sharp aura.</p><p>Lu Ye clasped his hand in greeting. Are you Fellow Cultivator Han Tiejun?It is I.</p><p>Thank you very much for your help, fellow cultivator! Lu Ye said.</p><p>The bad thing about being the champion of the Scroll of Supremacy was that there wasnt anyone he could challenge. That was why he had to ask Han Tiejun to challenge him to enter the battlefield.</p><p>Youre welcome, Fellow Cultivator Yi Ye. I have heard about your situation. How are you doing? Do you need us to assist you?</p><p>Its okay. Ive managed to slip back into the Myriad Poison Forest. The Thousand Demon Ridge can harm me no longer.</p><p>Han Tiejun looked impressed. You are incredible, fellow cultivator.</p><p>While the two men were speaking, Amber shivered once before discharging a good amount of mutant energy. It quickly shrank to the size of a cat before leaping onto Lu Yes shoulder.</p><p>Han Tiejun quickly left since he wasnt actually trying to challenge Lu Ye. He was just helping Lu Ye by giving him the opportunity to enter the Scroll of Supremacys battlefield.</p><p>Lu Ye exchanged imprints with the man before they parted ways because he had a feeling that they would cross paths again in the future.</p><p>After that, Lu Ye exited the battlefield as well.</p><p>Hua Ci grabbed Amber and cured it from its poison first. It was only then that she treated Lu Ye. However, there were many methods she couldnt use because she was unable to channel her Spiritual Power.</p><p>Thankfully, most of the wounds he received were flesh wounds due to his tough physique. They would recover given enough time.</p><p>The commotion outside the forest had subsided as well.</p><p>Now that the Three Sages Schools Outpost was breached, the Thousand Demon Ridge no longer had any way to force him to exit the Myriad Poison Forest.</p><p>In fact, Lu Ye swore to himself that he wasnt leaving until he had reached Heaven Nine!</p><p>He was already the champion at Heaven Eight. If he cultivated to Heaven Nine, then no one in the entire Spirit Creek Battlefield could threaten him anymore.</p><p>In the wooden building, Lu Ye recuperated while studying the booklet his third senior brother had entrusted his son to pass to him again and again.</p><p>He was able to learn a lot.</p><p>Silavin: Double release this week to catch up.
