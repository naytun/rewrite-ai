It did not matter how well the holder of the Amulet hid. Their location would be revealed immediately!</p><p>This type of Amulet was usually hotly contested by countless elites. After all, it was completely up to luck what kind of Amulet one might obtain from a Token of Providence event, but the special Amulet bestowed upon the receiver was guaranteed to be a Gold Amulet. Assuming that one‚Äôs cultivation level was high enough, it was perfectly possible to snatch it from the receiver‚Äôs hands and claim it as their own.</p><p>Lu Ye remained calm as he recalled everything he knew about the Carnage Colosseum.</p><p>Since he failed to escape the Carnage Colosseum before it was too late, the next best action was to do everything in his power to ensure his survival.</p><p>A large number of cultivators was guaranteed to arrive at the Carnage Colosseum in the next few days. This was especially true for high level cultivators like Xia Qianqian or Wei Que.</p><p>While the Carnage Colosseum was more dangerous than rewarding to Lu Ye, it was the opposite for high level cultivators. There was no way they would allow this opportunity to slip through their grasp. freewùöébnùê®ùòÉùêûùóπ.ùó∞ùöòùó∫</p><p>Lu Ye was okay with getting nothing from this Carnage Colosseum. All he wanted was to survive until the end of the event!</p><p>Although his cultivation level was weak, his ability to survive was way stronger than another cultivator at the same cultivation level.</p><p>For starters, he could conceal himself using Invisibility and Conceal Presence.</p><p>Soar and Windwalk guaranteed that he could escape all but the strongest cultivators.</p><p>This wasn‚Äôt enough, however. Lu Ye knew that he would need to make a lot more preparations to be truly secure. A plan quickly took form in his mind even as he thanked his past self for having the foresight to create a ton of ward flags in preparation for the future. Otherwise, he would feel so much more insecure right now.</p><p>There was a Divine Trade Association hotspot within the Carnage Colosseum. The red screen encompassed an entire region of hundreds of thousands of kilometers after all. However, the hotspot would shut down its business and remain closed until the event was over. This meant that he could not enter the hotspot and seek shelter until the event was over, much less trade with them.</p><p>It was a rule set by the Heavens themselves.</p><p>Lu Ye had prepared a sufficient amount of Spirit Stones, Spirit Pills, ward flags and ward keystones beforehand. As long as he was careful, he should be able to survive until the end of the Carnage Colosseum without any issues.</p><p>Generally speaking, the event should last a month at most. Looking back, most Carnage Colosseums lasted between half a month to a month, though it was impossible to predict how long the event would last before it was actually over. Also, the Heavens always gave out a signal right before the event was about to end.</p><p>Lu Ye was still thinking when the red screen next to him suddenly distorted unnaturally. The next thing he knew, a man stepped right out of it!</p><p>Clearly, the newcomer was someone who was looking to participate in the Carnage Colosseum. Since the red screen was completely opaque, the newcomer did not see Lu Ye until it was too late, and vice versa.</p><p>As their eyes met, the Battlefield Imprint on the back of Lu Ye‚Äôs hand abruptly shone blue without warning. At the same time, the Battlefield Imprint on the back of the newcomer‚Äôs hand shone red.</p><p>[He‚Äôs a Thousand Demon Ridge cultivator!]</p><p>Judging from his size and vitality, he was a body-tempering cultivator too.</p><p>Anyone who dared to enter the Carnage Colosseum alone could not be weak, and anyone who was too weak would not dare to enter the Carnage Colosseum without good reason. It would be suicide otherwise.</p><p>There was a brief standoff as the body-tempering cultivator glanced back and forth between Lu Ye and Yi Yi. He then said solemnly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just passing through!‚Äù</p><p>Although Lu Ye belonged to the opposing faction, the body-tempering cultivator figured that it would be folly to engage him without figuring out his cultivation level first, not to mention that he was outnumbered two to one.</p><p>The body-tempering cultivator nodded and began stepping away after expressing his intention. Lu Ye simply watched him with a blank expression. Yi Yi remained motionless as well.</p><p>The body-tempering cultivator was about fifty meters away when he suddenly stopped in his tracks and asked, ‚ÄúYou two were trying to leave, weren‚Äôt you?‚Äù</p><p>The second he said this, Lu Ye immediately launched himself at the body-tempering cultivator like a cannonball. Yi Yi also fired a Golden Arc straight at the man.</p><p>The body-tempering cultivator abruptly spun around and crushed Yi Yi‚Äôs spell with his bare fist. His mouth split into an ugly, malicious grin. ‚ÄúI knew it!‚Äù</p><p>The body-tempering cultivator hadn‚Äôt dared to attack Lu Ye and Yi Yi at the beginning because he didn‚Äôt know what their cultivation levels were. That was why he claimed he was just passing through and pretended to leave. If Lu Ye and Yi Yi were powerful cultivators, then there was no way they would let him go without a fight. On the other hand, they could not be too strong if they simply watched him leave without trying anything.</p><p>Moreover, the duo were standing at the edge of the Carnage Colosseum and facing toward the red screen. It was clear that they were hoping to leave the region. If they were powerful cultivators, they would not do this right at the start of the event. Anyone who was Fifth-Order or even Fourth-Order would not make such a choice.</p><p>That was why the body-tempering cultivator grew certain that Lu Ye and Yi Yi were newbies. They were at best Third-Order cultivators, and they had to know nothing about the Carnage Colosseum at all. Otherwise, they would know that it was impossible to pass through the red screen. The only way to leave was to wait until the event was over.</p><p>He took action as soon as he made up his mind. He grew even more certain in his hypotheses when Yi Yi and Lu Ye flared their Spiritual Power, revealing themselves to be a puny First-Order spell cultivator and a Third-Order combat cultivator. He would be remiss to allow such easy prey to slip through his grasp!</p><p>The body-tempering cultivator was so confident in his abilities that he didn‚Äôt even bring out his Shield Spirit Artifact. The fact was that he had crushed Yi Yi‚Äôs spell in one punch.</p><p>Suddenly, the body-tempering cultivator‚Äôs grin froze on his face. Then, he abruptly threw a punch at the combat cultivator and jumped away from him at the same time. Unfortunately, he was a little too slow to dodge the strike that was aimed at his abdomen. When he looked down, he saw that the strike had left a massive gash in his stomach. He could hardly believe his eyes. Did a Third-Order combat cultivator really just disembowel him?</p><p>He was a Fifth-Order body-tempering cultivator. His physique was so strong that even a Fifth-Order combat cultivator would be hard pressed to leave such a tremendous wound on his body. And yet, the Third-Order combat cultivator before his eyes had completely overturned his common sense.</p><p>The reason he hadn‚Äôt brought out his Shield Spirit Artifact at the beginning was because he was confident that he would win. Now, that confidence had been stomped into smithereens.</p><p>Another spell hit him before he could think of a solution. A First-Order spell cultivator should not be able to cast this quickly!</p><p>[These two‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre not ordinary Cloud River Realm cultivators! The combat cultivator especially must have entered the Scroll of Supremacy before!]</p><p>The thought flashed across his mind as he hurriedly brought out his Shield Spirit Artifact to block Yi Yi‚Äôs spells. However, he sensed a burst of killing intent from behind him. The combat cultivator had somehow taken his flank without him noticing!</p><p>[He‚Äôs ridiculously fast for a Third-Order cultivator!]</p><p>The body-tempering cultivator hurriedly spun around and just barely blocked Lu Ye‚Äôs thrust with his Shield Spirit Artifact. His shield arm turned numb from the sheer amount of force that was transmitted through his shield.</p><p>[He‚Äôs ridiculously strong for a Third-Order cultivator as well!]</p><p>The body-tempering cultivator was really starting to regret his latest life choice. Just who on earth were these people? They were way stronger than they had any right to be considering their cultivation level!</p><p>He pushed Lu Ye‚Äôs saber away with one hand before summoning what looked like a mace to the other hand. Then, he brought it down on Lu Ye‚Äôs head with great force.</p><p>The spell cultivator was blasting away at his back like a repeating crossbow, but he couldn‚Äôt afford to pay her any attention right now. He could only channel his Spiritual Power and vitality to block her spells.</p><p>Bang bang bang! Although the body-tempering cultivator was extremely durable, it still hurt him to endure a continuous barrage of spells head on. The good news was that he was four minor realms above the spell cultivator. His back might look awful from a bystander‚Äôs perspective, but the damage was superficial at best especially since he was a body-tempering cultivator.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ye posed a far greater threat than Yi Yi. As his vitality became mingled with Amber‚Äôs, he channeled a good amount of it into his right arm before swinging his saber upward. When the blow connected, the body-tempering cultivator‚Äôs eyeballs nearly fell out of his sockets. It was because the blow was so strong that he nearly lost his grip on his Shield Spirit Artifact.</p><p>As his shield and his arms were flung over his shoulders, his front was completely exposed. Lu Ye had already withdrawn his saber and assumed a stabbing stance. Every hair on the body-tempering cultivator‚Äôs body stood on end as he tried to respond to the attack. Unfortunately, he just wasn‚Äôt fast enough to keep up with the combat cultivator. He had just caught himself when the saber flew toward his abdomen. Goosebumps erupted all across his body as he cycled his Spiritual Power to the limit and attempted to bring his Shield Spirit Artifact in front of the saber. He had already taken enough hits to know just how terrifyingly powerful the combat cultivator wearing a fox mask was. If he failed to block the attack in time, the combat cultivator was going to skewer him like an animal!</p><p>It looked like he would make it in time when suddenly, the white Spirit Beast on the combat cultivator‚Äôs shoulder suddenly let out a thunderous roar. Shockwaves visibly washed over his body and made him feel like someone had cracked open his skull and hit his brain with an invisible hammer.</p><p>His movement paused for only an instant‚Ä¶ but that was all it took to seal his fate.</p><p>Lu Ye‚Äôs saber brushed against the edge of the body-tempering cultivator‚Äôs Shield Spirit Artifact and pierced right through his stomach. Without pause, he activated Burster and caused a million energy spikes to burst out of the blade. A painful howl escaping his lips, the body-tempering cultivator pushed Lu Ye away and brought his mace down on his head. Lu Ye immediately withdrew his saber to defend himself, and the blow sent him skidding at least thirty meters away from the body-tempering cultivator and leaving a pair of trenches on the ground.</p><p>Meanwhile, Yi Yi was still blasting away at the body-tempering cultivator‚Äôs back with impunity and knocking him off balance. It would not have been possible if not for the fact that his stomach was bleeding profusely, and his insides hurt so much that his face was distorted.</p><p>He could sense that his death was near. It was because the combat cultivator‚Äôs saber had somehow transformed into a deadly cactus inside his body and turned his internal organs into goo just now.</p><p>As his life force ebbed away like crazy, he abruptly spun toward Yi Yi and roared, ‚ÄúYou are dead!‚Äù</p><p>He knew he wasn‚Äôt going to walk away from this fight alive. However, that didn‚Äôt mean he couldn‚Äôt take at least one of his would-be killers down with him.</p><p>The Third-Order combat cultivator was way too agile for him to catch even if he was at full strength. On the other hand, he only needed one hit to turn the First-Order spell cultivator into fleshy mush if he could get close to her.</p><p>&lt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
