The biggest reason Lu Ye was able to go even against him was because he could activate all kinds of Glyphs to boost his combat capabilities. Protection especially had saved his life multiple times in this battle.</p><p>However, Bloodrage slowly but surely increased Lu Yes strength and speed over time. Eventually, it reached the point where he definitely surpassed Shi Guang. Since then, the spear cultivator was unable to win even a single clash. Even now, Bloodrage was still increasing Lu Yes strength and speed.</p><p>Right now, Shi Guang was completely blinded by rage. The Qi Boosting Pill could temporarily boost a cultivators strength, but its side effects were just as severe. Two such effects were diminished sanity and increased irritability.</p><p>If Shi Guang was his normal self, he shouldve realized that the gap between himself and Lu Yi Ye was only growing over time. However, he was so blinded by rage that he could not think of anything besides killing the opponent in front of him!</p><p>After climbing back to his feet and spitting out a spittle of blood, Shi Guang narrowed his swollen eyes at his incoming foe. He then raised his spear slightly into a never-before-seen stance.</p><p>The next moment, his Spiritual Power poured into his spear like a broken dam.</p><p>While running, Lu Ye suddenly felt every hair on his body standing on end. At the same time, the alarm bells in his head were ringing in full force. He immediately knew that Shi Guang was probably executing some sort of powerful secret technique!</p><p>He considered his options for a moment but decided to push on. He too channeled his Spiritual Power and caused the flames surrounding the saber to burst into an inferno.</p><p>Rumble rumble rumble</p><p>The discharge of Spiritual Power from both combatants distorted even the space of the battlefield. Energy vortices of all shapes and sizes were appearing all over the battlefield.</p><p>Amber was pushed all the way to the edge of the battlefield. It had to press its entire body against the ground to keep itself from moving further.</p><p>The two figures rushed toward each other at high speed. ùìµùì≤ùì´ùôßùìÆùôñùôô.ùíÑùì∏ùô¢</p><p>Shi Guang thrust his spear forward while yelling, Flames of War!</p><p>The shadow of a spear appeared in Lu Yes vision. Then one became ten, and ten became a hundred. As its name suggested, it spread like the flames of war until all he could see was spears.</p><p>He ignored them all and brought down his flaming saber with all his might.</p><p>The spears abruptly shattered like they were never there. He felt the Inviolable sinking into flesh, but his own chest was abruptly pierced by a cold, foreign object.</p><p>Drip, drip</p><p>Considering how noisy the battlefield was a while ago, it was now silent enough that they could hear blood drip.</p><p>Two men stared into each others bloodshot eyes before raising their legs at the exact same time.</p><p>Bang! Both men staggered away from each other. Blood immediately gushed out of Lu Yes chest and Shi Guangs neck like a pair of fountains.</p><p>Clang</p><p>Lu Ye lost his grip on his saber but was able to remain standing. Shi Guang, however, was finally past his limits. He collapsed on the ground at the same time his aura began weakening at a visible rate.</p><p>The Qi Boosting Pill had finally run its course, and the side effects were ripping into his body so painfully that his expression looked completely distorted. He could not even climb back on his feet, much less fight Lu Ye for even a second longer.</p><p>Lu Ye panted heavily as he barely stopped himself from collapsing. He then slowly made his way toward Shi Guang.</p><p>Shi Guang opened his swollen eyes and stared at the sky thinking Heavens-know-what. It wasnt until he heard Lu Yes footsteps that he finally opened his mouth.</p><p>Roar! Amber roared at the perfect time, but it didnt affect Shi Guang. Since the Thousand Demon Ridge had figured out Ambers ability, of course Shi Guang was prepared for it. An invisible barrier abruptly appeared around the spear cultivator and shielded him from the roar.</p><p>I surrender! Shi Guang spat out the two words before finally relaxing. He looked like an entire mountain had been removed from his shoulders.</p><p>The Heavens enveloped him in their mysterious power and teleported him away.</p><p>Lu Ye also stopped in his tracks.</p><p>Yi Yi appeared and caught him immediately. While keeping him upright, she stared at Lu Yes chest wound with fear and relief. If the spear had struck Lu Ye just a few milimeters to the left, the young man would be dead already.</p><p>In fact, Shi Guang was aiming at Lu Yes heart. The combat cultivator had just dodged it at the last moment.</p><p>A while later, Lu Ye was lying in his bed in the wooden building with Hua Ci tending to him. Refined Wood Attribute Spiritual Power flowed around her hands as she slowly treated his wounds. Of course, Lu Ye had fallen unconscious long before she finished the treatment.</p><p>Lu Ye was satisfied. His fight with Shi Guang was easily the most satisfying fight he had ever had since he began climbing the Scroll of Supremacy. Whatever grievances and frustrations he had accumulated due to assholes like Gui Yingzi and the other top ten rankers were all gone.</p><p>Although his opponent had employed what most people would consider a dishonorable tactic, all was fair in love and war, not to mention that they were enemies.</p><p>Right now, Lu Ye did not want to think of anything. He just wanted to sleep to his hearts content.</p><p>While he was sleeping, the cultivators of the Grand Sky Coalition and the Thousand Demon Ridge were experiencing completely different emotions.</p><p>Both factions had been watching the Scroll of Supremacy closely for many days now, so they had noticed the switch between the first and third place immediately. Countless Grand Sky Coalition cultivators erupted in cheers like never before. Lu Yes feat would go down in history as one of, if not the greatest achievements in the Spirit Creek Battlefield, and they were all deeply proud of it.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Thousand Demon Ridge was as silent as a wake. In the end, their biggest fears had come true. Lu Yi Ye of the Crimson Blood Sect had defeated Shi Guang as a Heaven Eight cultivator and became the champion of the Scroll of Supremacy!</p><p>This feat broke not just one, but multiple records since the Cultivation World of Jiu Zhou came to be.</p><p>No Heaven Eight cultivator had ever become the champion of the Scroll of Supremacy. Even Li Baxian was only ranked third by the Heavens after he fought against Yan Xing and revealed his true strength, and he had been stuck in the Spirit Creek Realm for over a decade.</p><p>Although the caliber of this Scroll of Supremacy were nowhere as good as when the Three Tumors were still around, that did not diminish Lu Yes achievement one bit.</p><p>Only the top hundred cultivators were displayed in the Scroll of Supremacy, and not only was Lu Ye the only Heaven Eight cultivator in a rank list that was completely dominated by Heaven Nines, he was the champion!</p><p>It was a feat that was destined to go down in the history books.</p><p>Speaking of which, Lu Yi Ye was only Heaven Seven when he joined the Scroll of Supremacy as the thirty-third ranker. That too was an unprecedented feat. No one except him had ever entered the Scroll of Supremacy as a Heaven Seven cultivator, much less be ranked among the upper fifty from the get go.</p><p>Even if they pretended that he was a Heaven Nine cultivator all along, the speed at which he scaled the ranks was another achievement that could go down in the history books.</p><p>It had only been half a month since Lu Yi Ye began climbing the Scroll of Supremacy earnestly. The guy had even wasted five days doing Heavens-know-what with Bai Lan and butting heads with time wasters like Gui Yingzi.</p><p>Strictly speaking, he had only spent ten days climbing the Scroll of Supremacy!</p><p>It was hard enough to believe that someone could climb all the way to the top without suffering a single loss. To do it in ten days? That was just unthinkable!</p><p>Dark clouds hung over every Thousand Demon Ridge cultivator. Were they going to be dominated by a single cultivator again?</p><p>Although the bastard had given them a similar heart attack back when he was at the Inner Circle, at the time he was relying on his ward breaching skills to create an invasion force.</p><p>This time though, he had done it with his own strength! The threat level between this and that were completely different!</p><p>Lu Ye was undoubtedly a far scarier man than he was at the Inner Circle.</p><p>Thankfully, there was one silver lining to all this bad news. According to Shi Guang, Lu Yi Ye had not walked away from his battle unscathed, and it would probably take him days before he fully recovered. For now, the Thousand Demon Ridge did not need to worry that Lu Ye might cause more trouble.</p><p>Normally, the Thousand Demon Ridge would seize the opportunity to challenge Lu Ye and drag him down from his throne. However, they only had two rankers in the top six. One of them was Shi Guang, and the other was the female archer.</p><p>Shi Guang was heavily injured and suffering from the side effects of the Qi Boosting Pill. It would take him ten days to half a month at least to recover. He would be lucky to keep his current rank, much less challenge Lu Ye.</p><p>As for the female archer, she had used up every arrow in her quiver. It would take her days to replenish it, and days was all Lu Ye needed to recover.</p><p>The only ones who had the chance to pull Lu Ye down his throne now was a Grand Sky Coalition ranker, but of course no one was stupid or crazy enough to do such a thing.</p><p>That said, the top six Grand Sky Coalition rankers had been challenged non-stop since Lu Ye became the champion. It was clear that the Thousand Demon Ridge were plotting to replace these rankers with their own and have them issue Lu Ye a challenge request. If they succeeded, there was a high chance Lu Ye would not be able to defeat them in his current state.</p><p>In the wooden building, Lu Ye woke up feeling pain from his left arm and chest area. His energy level was incredibly low as well. He slowly sat up and let out a huge yawn.</p><p>Yi Yi had been guarding his bed. The moment she heard his movement, she immediately stood up and put a pillow behind Lu Yes back. She then asked in a concerned voice, How do you feel?</p><p>Not bad. Lu Ye gave his stomach a rub. Im hungry. Can you get me something to eat?</p><p>He could smell the scent of food from outside the window. Hua Ci must be cooking again.</p><p>For some reason, many disciples of the Crimson Blood Sect seemed to be excellent cooks. His second senior sister was an outstanding cook, his fourth senior brother was an outstanding cook, and Hua Ci was an outstanding cook as well.</p><p>Give me a moment, Yi Yi said before floating out of the window. A while later, she returned with a bowl of porridge filled with bright and questionable colors</p><p>Lu Ye looked through the messages in his Battlefield Imprint while drinking his porridge. He selectively replied to some of them.</p><p>Most of the messages were congratulatory messages regarding his unprecedented feat. Lu Ye kept his response polite but succinct because frankly, it would take hours if he crafted a serious response to all of them.</p><p>(Patreon)&gt;&gt;</p><p>This content is taken from ùìÅùëñùëèùëüùò¶ùí∂ùò•.ùí∏ùò∞ùëö</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
