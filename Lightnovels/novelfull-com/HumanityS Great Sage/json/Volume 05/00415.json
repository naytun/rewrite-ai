Amber could not break free no matter how much it struggled.</p><p>There were two bodies on the ground. One of them was obviously dead since his head was shattered, and the other person had a caved chest but was still breathing. 𝓵𝒊𝒃𝙧𝓮𝙖𝓭.𝙘𝒐𝙢</p><p>It was obvious that these two cultivators had been struck by Amber during the struggle, the unlucky bastards. No Spirit Creek Realm cultivator could survive a direct hit from its massive paw without Spiritual Power.</p><p>If the Spirit Net was not the only problem Amber needed to contend with, then Lu Ye might not have come to its aid so soon. The problem was the flying Spirit Beasts in the air.</p><p>At first, the scouts wanted to shoot Lu Ye and Amber to death. After discovering that their arrows did next to no damage, they simply watched Lu Ye and kept their allies updated on the situation.</p><p>Lu Ye was absolutely plowing through their allies right now. They didnt dare to harass him for fear of becoming his target.</p><p>Earthly Deity Chapter 32</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>Amber was a different story though. The white tiger was currently trapped in a Spirit Net, so some of the scouts decided to have their Spirit Beasts grab each corner of the Spirit Net. They were trying to lift it into the air!</p><p>It was true that the arrows werent enough to kill Amber, but anyone could fall to their deaths given enough height!</p><p>By the time Lu Ye finally reached Amber, the tiger was already hovering at least ten meters above the ground!</p><p>Lu Ye leaped into the air with all his might before swinging his saber at one of the Spirit Beasts talons.</p><p>The Spirit Beast clearly noticed that he was a threat because it hurriedly let go of the Spirit Net and took off to the sky.</p><p>Lu Ye immediately seized the opportunity to climb up the Spirit Net. While staring at another different Spirit Beast, he raced toward it and raised his saber aggressively.</p><p>The rider wasnt going to allow Lu Ye to hit him or his Spirit Beast, of course. He immediately commanded his mount to let go of the Spirit Net and took off to safety.</p><p>At the same time, Amber finally broke free from the Spirit Net and fell toward the ground. Lu Ye immediately stopped harassing the riders and leaped after Amber.</p><p>On the ground, the Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators had collected themselves and spread out once more. When Amber and Lu Ye descended from above, they immediately thrust their weapons upward.</p><p>Amber roared in anger, and Lu Ye stifled a groan. At that moment, both man and tiger took a ton of wounds.</p><p>Go! Lu Ye climbed onto Ambers back and uttered through gritted teeth.</p><p>Amber immediately locked its gaze in one direction and took off at full speed. Anyone who dared to stand in their way were either sent flying by Amber or cut down by Lu Ye.</p><p>It was a short, harrowing and bloody conflict, but in the end, they were able to break out of the encirclement and escape.</p><p>The remaining Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators did not give chase. They simply stared at the escaping duo in fear and disbelief!</p><p>They had lost nearly half their numbers even though the clash was as brief as it was bloody. Worse still, they still werent able to kill Lu Yi Ye!</p><p>The battle showed them just how unreasonably powerful a cultivator could be.</p><p>They did not give chase not because they were afraid, but because they didnt have mounts. They would not have been able to catch up to him even if they tried. Also, they had technically accomplished their mission. Although their casualties were horrifying, neither Lu Yi Ye nor his mount had escaped unscathed. Now, they could only leave the rest to their fellow cultivators.</p><p>While they werent pursuing Lu Yi Ye, the aerial scouts riding their flying Spirit Beasts were. Any Thousand Demon Ridge cultivator within tens of kilometers of the area only needed to look up to know where Lu Yi Ye was.</p><p>Lu Ye knew they couldnt continue like this. If he couldnt find a way to shake off the aerial scouts, it was only a matter of time before he ran into another premeditated ambush.</p><p>Thankfully, he was quite experienced in this matter. The reason the enemy could track him wherever he went was because they controlled the sky. In that case, he only needed to escape into a forest where the terrain would hide him from view. He would be able to shake off the persistent bastards then.</p><p>He couldnt open his Storage Bag and check his 10-point map, so he had to recall it by memory and identify his destination that way. Thankfully, he was able to do just that and steer Amber in the right direction.</p><p>An hour later, the man and the tiger finally escaped the seemingly boundless plains and entered a forest. 𝘭𝑖𝘣𝓇ℯ𝘢𝒹.𝘤ℴ𝘮</p><p>While this forest wasnt as good a hiding spot as the Misty Mountains, the trees were as tall as the canopies were thick. His enemies would be hardpressed to keep track of him even if they had control of the sky.</p><p>Amber did not stop running even after it entered the forest. It wasnt until they traveled deep into the forest that they finally managed to shake off the aerial scouts.</p><p>After that, they found a cave and entered. Both man and beast collapsed on the floor almost as soon as they were out of view.</p><p>It took Lu Ye a long, long time before he was able to muster the energy to climb back to his feet and ripped off his blood-soaked clothes. He then grabbed the bag he had tied to Ambers back.</p><p>Luckily, they hadnt lost the bag during the attacks. It contained a lot of bandages, ointments, Healing Pills and various supplies.</p><p>First, he fed Amber and himself some Healing Pills. Then, he started applying the ointments to his wounds. It was painful work that caused him to hiss in pain once in a while.</p><p>A long time later, after Lu Ye had bandaged himself like a zongzi, he proceeded to do the same for Amber.</p><p>It wasnt a good idea to start a fire for various reasons, so he and Amber could only content themselves with jerkies.</p><p>Lu Ye felt better after he appeased his growling stomach somewhat. He then leaned against the wall and shut his eyes to catch some rest. Amber lay next to him and was out like a light just like that.</p><p>Unfortunately, their rest would be disturbed not even an hour later. Lu Ye opened his eyes when his ears picked up some commotion. Amber was also glancing out of the cave warily.</p><p>[Can a man not catch some rest?]</p><p>Lu Ye rose to his feet and climbed onto Ambers back. The tiger dashed out of the cave and came face to face with a squad of Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators.</p><p>Lu Ye had the element of surprise this time, so the battle was over almost as soon as it began. A swipe here, a slash there, and the entire squad was dead just like that.</p><p>Lu Ye picked up the loot as quickly as he could. Then they took off once more, moving deeper into the forest.</p><p>The Thousand Demon Ridge knew that this was their best chance to kill Lu Yi Ye. They knew where he was, and the Yuan Metal Storm stopped him from being able to use his Spiritual Power and outfly all of them. If they could surround him, then he was dead for sure.</p><p>No one was willing to miss this opportunity. If the Thousand Demon Ridge wasnt going all out before, they were now.</p><p>As a result, Lu Ye and Amber were unable to hide in one place for long even in this ancient forest. No matter where they hid themselves, it only took their enemies an hour at most to find them. This situation would continue for a couple more days.</p><p>The continuous battles gave Lu Ye and Amber almost no time to rest. Both man and tiger were weary to say the least.</p><p>Thankfully, they had the superior quality honey Lu Ye had stolen from the wasp nest. It was one of the main reasons they were able to hang on until now.</p><p>Lu Ye knew this couldnt continue, though. At first, he thought they were safe after they shook off the eyes in the sky. However, he had underestimated his enemys determination to kill him. They werent going to stop until he was dead.</p><p>In the end, the Myriad Poison Forest was his only refuge. As long as he could get there, the Thousand Demon Ridge could sacrifice every cultivator they had, and they still wouldnt be able to get their hands on him.</p><p>His mind made up, he and Amber caught one last rest before resuming their great escape.</p><p>Half a day later, Amber and Lu Ye burst out of the forest and headed straight toward Myriad Poison Forest!</p><p>It didnt take long before the Thousand Demon Ridge discovered Lu Yes whereabouts. An unimaginable amount of cultivators began pouring out of the forest. Those with a mount that could keep up with Amber gave chase immediately, though most of them were unable to participate in the pursuit. Not everyone had a Tamed Beast after all.</p><p>It was a grand spectacle if nothing else.</p><p>Lu Ye and Amber spent as little time fighting the Thousand Demon Ridge as possible. Right now, there was nothing more important than making it back to the Myriad Poison Forest.</p><p>Amber took almost no breaks on the way. Near the end, its entire body even started steaming as if it was overheating.</p><p>Three whole days later, the Myriad Poison Forest was finally within view. Unfortunately, the Thousand Demon Ridge had figured out his destination as well. Although they didnt know how he managed to survive the forbidden zone, it was clear that he was planning to escape into the Myriad Poison Forest once more. If he succeeded, then this operation would end in failure yet again.</p><p>That was why they couldnt allow Lu Yi Ye to enter the Myriad Poison Forest no matter what!</p><p>By using the flying Spirit Beasts as transports, the Thousand Demon Ridge was able to move their manpower to the Myriad Poison Forest in just a short time.</p><p>By the time Lu Ye reached the edge of the forest, a defense line made up of almost two hundred cultivators was waiting for him!</p><p>Steam continued to rise off Ambers body as it slowed down. It stared at the hordes of enemies in front of them and growled threateningly.</p><p>Lu Ye was exhaling behind Ambers back as well.</p><p>If the Yuan Metal Storm hadnt happened, he might have been able to break through the defense line. At the very least, he would be able to escape using Windwalk or Soar.</p><p>But without his Spiritual Power? There was no chance he could make it even if he was at peak form, and both him and Amber were nearing their last legs after three days of non-stop escape.</p><p>Lu Yi Ye! Someone shouted from the other side. Come and fight us!</p><p>It was never honorable to overwhelm an enemy with numbers, then again, Lu Yi Ye must have killed at least a thousand Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators by this point. When it came to the combat cultivator, honor had ceased being a thing a long, long time ago. Any price was acceptable as long as they could kill Lu Yi Ye.</p><p>After all, they would only lose more allies if he was allowed to live.</p><p>While Amber was pacing back and forth across the defense line, Lu Ye tapped his Battlefield Imprint and sent out a message, I dont think well be able to make it through. Ill try to circle around and see if I can break through from a different direction.</p><p>That was what he said, but he knew that the plan was more than likely to end in failure. If he could circle around, his enemies could as well. For as long as they had eyes on him, the chances he might be able to slip back into the forest was almost zero.</p><p>The Spirit Creek Battlefield was massive, but there were only two places he could seek refuge right now. The first place was the poisonous forest in front of him. The second place was the Crimson Blood Sects Outpost. There, anyone stupid enough to intrude their territory would have to face Beakys wrath. Not even the Thousand Demon Ridge would challenge a flying Tyrant to kill him.</p><p>However, the Crimson Blood Sects Outpost was located in the outermost ring of the Outer Circle. To say that it was far away would be a gross understatement. With Ambers speed, it could run for a month and still not make it to the Outpost.</p><p>That was why the Myriad Poison Forest was still his only hope.</p><p>[I can only do my best and pray that the Heavens will have mercy on me!]</p><p>Lu Ye was just thinking this when he suddenly received a response. Stay there and dont move. Im coming to get you!</p><p>The reply came from Hua Ci, of course. She had been paying close attention to Lu Yes activity this whole time. She was well aware that he was being hunted.</p><p>Lu Ye frowned. It sounded like Hua Ci had a plan, and he wondered what it was.</p><p>(Patreon)&gt;&gt;</p><p>Visit 𝒍𝙞𝙗𝒓𝒆𝙖𝓭.𝙘𝒐𝒎 for the best novel reading experience</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
