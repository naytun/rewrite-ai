He thought that focusing completely on defense would give him the safety he desperately sought, but in reality it barely did anything. He had forgotten that sometimes, the best defense was a good offense.</p><p>It couldnt be helped. Lu Ye was so infamous that he wasnt confident he could beat the young man even with an Armor Golem.</p><p>While his strategy wasnt completely unsoundhe was completely protected at the beginninghe lost any chance of retaliation when Lu Ye managed to pry open an unblockable gap in his defense.</p><p>While Amber was smacking the body-tempering cultivator left and right with its large paws, Lu Ye targeted Zhu Pangs flank with deadly intent. The sharp blade made Zhu Pang feel as if he had been dropped into an ice pit.</p><p>He focused his attention completely on Lu Ye and Amber and channeled all of his Spiritual Power to defend against their attacks. However</p><p>Boom!</p><p>One second, he felt a violent surge of Spiritual Power from his side. The next, a massive blast poured through the gap of his defense and slammed into his body like a mountain. At that moment, Zhu Pang felt as if he was being rent from limb to limb. If his physique wasnt as tough as it was, the blast wouldve killed him already.</p><p>Even so, the attack had shredded his protection and left a deep hole in his body. One could even see his internal organs if they looked closely!</p><p>He turned around to see what had attacked him. His pupils contracted into needles when he saw a girl channeling another powerful spell some distance away from him!</p><p>[What the]</p><p>[What is going on here?]</p><p>Zhu Pang was flabbergasted to say the least. The battles of the Scroll of Supremacy had always been a one-on-one duel. He had no qualms with Lu Yi Ye bringing his Tamed Beast into the battle since it was something the Heavens allowed since the Scroll of Supremacy was a thing. After all, Beast Tamers primarily fought using Tamed Beasts. To forbid them from bringing their Tamed Beasts into the fight would be to neuter them completely.</p><p>But who the fuck was this girl?</p><p>She couldnt possibly be a Tamed Beast, could she?</p><p>He just could not make sense of this no matter how hard he tried.</p><p>Zhu Pangs first thought was that Lu Yi Ye had used some sort of unimaginable method to circumvent the Heavens supervision and bring in a spell cultivator to kick his ass. However, he quickly discarded the idea. The Heavens were a higher existence that had been maintaining law and order since the beginning of their Cultivation World. As far as he was aware, there had never been a fairness issue regarding the Scroll of Supremacy. He could not imagine that the Heavens would screw up so badly that they would allow a spell cultivator to enter the battle of the Scroll of Supremacy and screw up the duel completely.</p><p>He didnt get to ponder on this issue for long though. As Yi Yis spells blasted him again and again, he started shaking non-stop like a boat attempting to survive a thunderstorm on the sea.</p><p>This was before mentioning that Lu Ye and Amber were attacking him non-stop as well.</p><p>His senses were screaming for him to run when he lost yet another Shield Spirit Artifact. It felt like death was breathing down his neck.</p><p>Zhu Pang wanted to surrender, but Amber would not stop roaring at him. It grew to the point where he was starting to bleed from his nose continuously. A tiny voice urged him to surrender again and again, but he just could not concentrate enough to say the words out loud.</p><p>More spells struck his muscular body when finally, a sharp blade slipped through his broken defense, pierced through his lower jaw and out of his skull!</p><p>The body-tempering cultivators Spiritual Power abruptly ceased. Yi Yi dispelled her spells, and Amber retreated to a corner. That said, Amber was still in a pouncing stance just in case the body-tempering cultivator managed to pull off one last attack before his inevitable death.</p><p>Drip</p><p>Drip</p><p>Red blood dripped off Zhu Pangs chin and splashed wetly against the floor. He stared at the young man who killed him with hate, disbelief, the desire to live and many, many more emotions</p><p>Lu Ye withdrew his saber, and the blood poured out of the wound earnestly. The body-tempering cultivator hit the floor with a thud and curled up slowly. It wasnt long before an entire pool of blood appeared beneath the corpse</p><p>That was the end of the sixth ranker, Zhu Pang.</p><p>Yi Yi stepped forward and took all of Zhu Pangs valuables including the broken Armor Golem he was wearing. She then tossed the Storage Bag into Lu Yes hands before slipping back into Ambers body.</p><p>While this was happening, Lu Ye hurriedly took out a stack of bandages and healing medicine from his Storage Bag, put them all inside a normal bag, and tied it to Ambers back.</p><p>This was just the beginning. Unless he was sorely mistaken, a harsher battle awaited him when he returned to the Spirit Creek Battlefield!</p><p>The Yuan Metal Storm froze any and all Spiritual Qi. The effect was so absolute that even Storage Bags were unusable during this time. That was why he had taken out his healing items and put them in a normal bag. Not only that, he also picked out a few sabers that shared almost the same shape as the Inviolable from his pile of loot to use as spares.</p><p>After everything was ready, Lu Ye stuffed a couple of Healing Pills into his mouth and climbed onto Ambers back. Only then did he allow the Heavens to teleport him out of the battlefield.</p><p>The first thing he saw upon returning to the Spirit Creek Battlefield was a boundless expanse. However, things were definitely not the same as they were before. His vision had just recovered when a powerful gust of wind struck Ambers body like a hammer. The tiger was huge and strong, but the attack still nearly knocked it over.</p><p>The tiger let out an angry roar and swiped in the direction where the attack came from. It was able to tear a chunk of flesh from its assailant.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ye felt a powerful attack sailing toward him. He instinctively swung his own blade in response. There was a loud clash as the enemys Spirit Artifact was sent flying. He also heard his attacker crying out in surprise.</p><p>It was only now that Lu Ye saw who their attacker was. It was a Thousand Demon Ridge cultivator riding a Spirit Rhino. The Rhino was the one who rammed into Amber, and the cultivator the one who attacked him.</p><p>Unfortunately for his attackers, the surprise attack wasnt enough to make up for the large disparity in strength between them. Not only did the Spirit Rhino take more damage than it dished out, its rider had fallen right off its back.</p><p>Lu Ye was about to kill the cultivator when several massive shadows charged toward him from different directions. They were all cultivators riding all sorts of Spirit Beasts. ùëôùò™ùí∑ùìáùëíùëéùëë.ùò§ùëúùëö</p><p>Although Lu Ye was able to kill Zhu Pang in just a short time, some of his enemies still managed to reach his location before he finished. That was why he was attacked the second he returned to the Spirit Creek Battlefield.</p><p>The good news was that their numbers were few. Amber had already leaped out of the encirclement of Spirit Beasts without waiting for Lu Ye to give it a command. While they were in the air, Lu Ye bent down and swung his saber at a cultivator who was attempting to pierce Ambers stomach with his spear.</p><p>Clang! The attack was neutralized without issue, and Amber landed about thirty meters away from the encirclement. It immediately took off into the distance while the Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators hurriedly turned around and gave chase.</p><p>For a time, a white tiger could be seen running across the plains while being chased by a random assortment of Spirit Beasts. Their riders cried, Lu Yi Ye is here!</p><p>Kill Lu Yi Ye!</p><p>Do not let him escape!</p><p>If someone were to look at the ground from a birds eye view, they would see many more riders converging upon Lu Yes location. There were at least thirty of them.</p><p>Lu Ye was glad that he managed to kill Zhu Pang as quickly as he did. If he was even a dozen breaths slower, he wouldve had a much harder time breaking out of the Thousand Demon Ridges encirclement.</p><p>Suddenly, both Lu Ye and Amber heard a series of whistling noises from the sky. They were being attacked from the air!</p><p>The attack had caught both of them off guard. Despite Lu Yes swift reaction, he only managed to parry some of the attacks. The rest struck both him and Amber.</p><p>Everyone including Lu Ye himself thought they were fucked, but then something hilarious happened. The attacks had practically bounced off both his and Ambers body!</p><p>Lu Ye looked up and saw a dozen or so bird-type Spirit Beasts flying in the sky. Their riders were raining arrows at him!</p><p>Their tactic was sound, but they had completely underestimated Lu Yes physique.</p><p>How powerful was an arrow without Spiritual Power, even one that was shot by a cultivator from an incredible height? The best the arrows could do was to scratch Lu Yes skin. As for Amber, the arrow couldnt even pierce its fur.</p><p>How is Lu Yi Ye so tough?</p><p>The Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators were stunned by how ineffective the arrows were. They had thought that their aerial assault would be more than enough to kill Lu Yi Ye, but in reality that wasnt the case.</p><p>To be fair, Lu Ye was way tougher than the average combat cultivator. His physical change had first begun at the Dragon Spring. The Dragon Spring itself didnt improve his body too much, but the dragon scale he had obtained from it was a different story. The blood qi in the dragon scale could strengthen ones physique, so Lu Ye used it whenever he could. By now, he had completely depleted the dragon scale.</p><p>Besides that, Shui Yuan prepared a medicinal bath that could strengthen the body every time he returned to the Crimson Blood Sects headquarters. The Blood Sturgeons in the Lunarmere could strengthen the body as well. Technically speaking, an official disciple could only receive one Blood Sturgeon per month, but Lu Ye obviously enjoyed special treatment in this regard.</p><p>His appetite was way bigger since he cultivated the Gluttonous Feast, and everything he ate was converted into his vitality. Besides that, he had also received the Heavens reward.</p><p>All things considered, it would be stranger if his physique wasnt strong. The only reason he did not look muscular was because he had never cultivated like a body-tempering cultivator.</p><p>He might be nowhere close to Ju Jias level, but he was definitely on par or stronger than the ordinary body-tempering cultivator.</p><p>Amber was even tougher than he was as it consumed most of the blood qi in the dragon scale. At least fifty percent of its blood qi had gone to the white tiger. Lu Ye came in second with thirty to forty percent, and Ju Jia last with ten to twenty percent.</p><p>Besides that, Amber was a Spirit Beast, one who had learned how to inhale and exhale the essence of a celestial body from Ju Jia no less. Physique wise, Amber was at least two or three times stronger than Lu Ye. If it activated its mutant powers, it could be immune to even a cultivators Spirit Artifact.</p><p>Now, all those refinements were paying dividends. Most cultivators wouldve taken some injuries after being treated to a rain of arrows. Assuming they took too much damage, then their death was all but certain.</p><p>However, Lu Ye and Amber were immune to the arrow shots. At first, Lu Ye still tried to parry the attacks with his saber, but ignored them completely when he realized that they were about as harmful as a scratch.</p><p>(Patreon)&gt;&gt;</p><p>The source of this content is ùìµùíäùì´ùìªùìÆùì™ùíÖ.ùì¨ùì∏ùô¢</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
