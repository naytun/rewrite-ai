The air was charged with tension and killing intent.</p><p>Suddenly, Lu Ye spun toward seemingly thin air before swinging out his saber. An invisible ghost cultivator that had skulked up to him and was just about to attack him was immediately split in half.</p><p>The ghost cultivators eyes were filled with disbelief. He never found out how Lu Ye had sensed him until he died.</p><p>His peers were even less inclined to move. Lu Yi Yes senses were way keener than they expected. It might be nigh impossible to ambush him.</p><p>The Mystic Green Palace cultivators seemed to see his attack as a signal, because those in the formation abruptly shouted, Kill! The next moment, a barrage of spells and flying weapons rained down on his location.</p><p>The Untold Story of a Jiu Jitsu Leg‚Ä¶</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>The Untold Story of a Jiu Jitsu Legend ‚Äì Craig Jones Exposed!</p><p>Empowered by Windwalk, Lu Ye dashed here and there to avoid the bulk of the barrage. From the Mystic Green Palace cultivators perspective, he was like a fish in water dodging ninety percent of their attack and blocking the rest with his Glyph.</p><p>It took him only three breaths to cross sixty six meters of distance. The body-tempering cultivator Lu Ye was charging toward placed his Spirit Shield Artifact in front of himself and mustered his vitality and Spiritual Power. He looked as solid as a rock.</p><p>However, Lu Yes right arm abruptly grew a size bigger as he channeled an incredible amount of vitality into it. Then, he brought his saber down on the Spirit Shield Artifact like a thunderbolt.</p><p>Flash!</p><p>To everyones shock, the nonuple enhancement shield shattered like it was glass. Not only that, the Inviolable continued to slam the body-tempering cultivator behind the shield to the ground. As a result, a small gap appeared in the tight formation.</p><p>Lu Ye slipped through the gap and brought the Inviolable and his flying weapons to bear. He slaughtered them like a tiger might slaughter its prey.</p><p>He had invaded a Thousand Demon Ridge Outpost once when he was Heaven Eight. At the time, he had barely put up a fight before he was chased out like a rat.</p><p>But now? Now, he could single handedly destroy an Outpost.</p><p>He wouldnt have come here in the first place if he wasnt sure he could do this.</p><p>The best way to deal with a horde of enemies alone was to get into the thick of it. Although he would be surrounded, he would have some measure of control especially since he was a combat cultivator. He could also limit the amount of attacks he received as his enemies would be hard pressed to attack him without causing friendly fire.</p><p>Had he decided to attack from range, he wouldnt be surrounded as easily, but his enemies would be able to bombard him with flying weapons and spells to their hearts content.</p><p>In the enemy formation, only seven or eight people could attack him at a time, and only with close-ranged attacks as flying weapons or spells would most likely result in friendly fire.</p><p>Every time Lu Ye killed a cultivator, a couple more wounds would be added to his body. Thankfully, his body was strong enough that the injuries looked severe, but in reality werent. His vitals were protected by Protection at all times.</p><p>It wasnt long before the situation quickly devolved into utter chaos, and Lu Ye wasnt the only contributor. Every time Amber roared out, some people were guaranteed to fall to Lu Yes blade. Besides that, a petite figure was soundlessly causing havoc behind enemy lines as well.</p><p>When Lu Ye had invaded the Outpost and killed the first batch of cultivators, Yi Yi had already slipped out of Ambers body and hid underground. She was sneaky enough that no one noticed her. Now, she reappeared while holding a treasure that looked like a painting. It was of course the Nine Realms Scroll.</p><p>She snuck up to a bunch of panicking Mystic Green Palace cultivators without anyone noticing. While Lu Ye was distracting everyone with his flamboyant slaughter, she threw the Nine Realms Scroll over their heads and vanished them without a trace.</p><p>A couple of ink figures immediately appeared in the ward scroll. They were all completely confused by the sudden change of scenery.</p><p>The Nine Realms Scroll was a Spirit Treasure, and Yi Yi had been entrusted with it since nearly the beginning. Unfortunately, forget killing these cultivators herself, she would be hard pressed to trap them for long. She just wasnt strong enough to use the Nine Realms Scroll to its full potential.</p><p>If she was strong enough, anyone she trapped within the Nine Realms Scroll could be massacred as she pleased. She could kill them with a single thought, and they wouldnt even know what had happened until their final moments.</p><p>Since she could neither kill her enemies or trap them for too long, the only thing she could do was to let them go.</p><p>That was why she went about fifty meters into the underground before releasing them directly</p><p>It should not need to be said, but the poor cultivators were dead the second they reappeared in reality. At this depth, no Spirit Creek Realm cultivator could possibly survive the crushing pressure around them.</p><p>Yi Yi could traverse the underground freely because she was an apparition with no physical body. They werent.</p><p>She would continue to do this again, and again, and again.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Mystic Green Palace cultivators had gone from righteous fury to cold fear in a matter of minutes.</p><p>At the beginning, they were beyond furious that Lu Yi Ye would dare to invade their Outpost alone. They felt scorned and looked down upon.</p><p>But now? Now they realized that Lu Ye actually could kill them alone. ùìÅùëñùò£ùëüùò¶ùò¢ùíπ.ùëê‚Ñ¥ùòÆ</p><p>It hadnt even been a tea time yet, but over thirty people had died at his hands already. Even the body-tempering cultivators were unable to withstand a single strike from him. The bastard had literally sliced them and their Spirit Shields in half.</p><p>What was even more puzzling was the fact that many of their cultivators had suddenly disappeared without warning. Nobody knew where they went, only that they had suddenly vanished into thin air.</p><p>It took only a moment for their group of seventy plus to dwindle to less than twenty. The square in front of the Sanctum of Providence was covered in blood, and the corpses were piled into tiny hills of flesh. Today, death was blossoming in full force!</p><p>The man who did it all was covered in blood and seemingly insane. It was because he hadnt said a word from the start until now. It looked like all he cared about was killing them to the last person!</p><p>The survivors finally lost their nerve. Someone shouted, Retreat! We need to retreat to Jiu Zhou before its too late!</p><p>It was a sentiment that was met wholeheartedly by everyone else.</p><p>The survivors began mounting an organized retreat to the Sanctum of Providence. Once they reached the Divine Opportunity Column, they teleported away as quickly as they could.</p><p>Of course, a couple more people fell to Lu Yes blade during this time.</p><p>Lu Ye did not stop until the last Mystic Green Palace cultivator finally vanished from sight.</p><p>When Yi Yi appeared from the underground again, she looked around and exclaimed in surprise, Where did they go?</p><p>She had missed the moment where the Mystic Green Palace cultivators had teleported back to their headquarters because she was underground just now. By the time she returned, all that was left were the corpses.</p><p>They ran.</p><p>Lu Ye flicked off the blood on the Inviolable before returning it to its sheath.</p><p>Thats a shame.</p><p>She thought they would be able to annihilate the Mystic Green Palace to the last person, but some of them managed to escape in the end. The number of survivors shouldnt be many though.</p><p>Twenty five kilometers away, a great number of auras were flying toward the Mystic Green Palaces Outpost. The leader was none other than Situ Han, the Legate of the Three Sages School. He was followed by the elites of his sect.</p><p>The Three Sages School was the Mystic Green Palaces neighbor. Since the Spirit Creek Realm talents of this generation werent very impressive, they were often bullied by the Mystic Green Palace and two other Thousand Demon Ridge factions.</p><p>It was why their Sect Master had requested Lu Ye to cultivate at their Outpost. He was hoping to buy one Lu Ye and get Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan for free so to speak, but his plans backfired on him because the two cultivators had ascended to the Cloud River Realm.</p><p>Even Lu Ye was unable to cultivate at their Outpost for obvious reasons.</p><p>It should not need to be said, but their neighbors had played a major role in the occupation of their Outpost. The Mystic Green Palace especially was all too happy to kick a dog when it was down. There was more resentment between them than a single book could scribe.</p><p>Although the Three Sages School was in the middle of reconstruction right now, the lack of Contribution Points meant that the concentration of its World Spiritual Qi and even its radius were far, far lousier than before.</p><p>That was why Situ Han had mustered nearly half of his cultivators and made a beeline for the Mystic Green Sects Outpost the second he received Lu Yes message. He was going to work with the young man and take bloody revenge against their tormentors.</p><p>The Three Sages School cultivators behind Situ Han were brimming with excitement and killing intent as well.</p><p>Junior sister Feng, Situ Han suddenly spoke up.</p><p>I am here, Feng Yue hurriedly replied.</p><p>Feng Yue was now a Ninth-Order cultivator, and she had gathered enough Contribution Points to purchase the Heaven-Grade cultivation technique she needed thanks to the Three Sages School. It should not take long before she ascended to Heaven Seven.</p><p>Where is Brother Yi Ye right now? Situ Han asked.</p><p>Give me a second, Feng Yue replied while messaging Lu Ye.</p><p>A moment later, she replied with an odd expression, Fifth senior brother said hes inside their Outpost.</p><p>Situ Han blanched a little when he heard this. Hes attacking them already? I didnt know hes this impatient.</p><p>He thought for a moment before letting out a Spiritual Power-empowered shout, Junior brothers and sisters, Brother Yi Ye is already attacking the Mystic Green Palaces Outpost, and he may be surrounded right now! Let us rush to his aid as quickly as we can!</p><p>Yes sir! The cultivators responded before speeding up.</p><p>An incense stick later, they arrived outside the Mystic Green Sects Outpost and found that their Grand Ward had stopped working. Not only that, they saw a massive trail of blood and corpses all the way to the center of the Outpost.</p><p>[Is is it over already?] Situ Han couldnt quite process what he was seeing.</p><p>(Patreon)&gt;&gt;</p><p>Updated from ùò≠ùò™ùëèùëü‚ÑØùí∂ùëë.ùò§ùëúùòÆ</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
