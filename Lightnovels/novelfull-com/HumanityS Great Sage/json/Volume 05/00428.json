He communed with his saber as he breathed.</p><p>It had been three days since he arrived at the Spirit Peak, or five days since he gave the Thousand Demon Ridge his ultimatum. No one had shown their faces just yet, but Lu Ye could tell that a lot of ghost cultivators were skulking nearby.</p><p>At first, Lu Ye thought that the ghost cultivators were here to assassinate him. Now though, he thought differently. If that was the case, they shouldve attacked him a long time ago. They never made a move even though he had exposed himself many times for the past three days.</p><p>Did Thousand Demon Ridge not want him dead? Of course they did. No one dared to make a move though. Lu Ye had already given them his terms, and any sect that paid the price would be spared from his wrath. It was one thing if they could kill him, but if they failed then the consequences were unimaginable.</p><p>Lu Ye thought he knew why these ghost cultivators were really here. They were here to spy on him, but he suspected that they were also carrying the valuables he demanded. As for why they hadnt paid him yet, it was because there was still time before the deadline.</p><p>They were all waiting for the other ghost cultivators to turn in the valuables first. After all, there was absolutely nothing to be proud about this</p><p>Earthly Deity Chapter 45</p><p>Please enable JavaScript ùò≠ùëñùò£ùëüùò¶ùí∂ùò•.ùò§ùëúùòÆ</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>Earthly Deity Chapter 45</p><p>In any case, there were still five days until Lu Yes deadline. They could afford to waste this time.</p><p>Time continued to pass as more and more ghost cultivators continued to show up and observe Lu Ye from the shadows.</p><p>Meanwhile, an interesting news had broken out from the Divine Trade Association. Apparently, a new Tyrant Mutant had appeared in the Core Circle. Not only was she a female Mutant capable of taking on a humanoid form, she did not have a fixed territory. She seemed to be roaming the Core Circle in search of something.</p><p>In fact, the Divine Trade Association had noticed her two months ago. It was just that she wasnt worth giving out information for free back then. However, she started garnering more and more attention after she appeared in the Core Circle.</p><p>No one knew what she was searching for, only that she wasnt overtly hostile toward cultivators. She always left them alone unless they provoked her.</p><p>According to the elites of the Divine Trade Association, the female Mutant was originally a Fire Attribute Spirit Beast before she transformed into her current form, a Firecube to be exact. She most likely hailed from the Burning Lands because that place was a forbidden zone and the perfect habitat for Fire Attribute Spirit Beasts. On a related note, the Burning Lands had begun receding several months ago. No one knew why this was happening.</p><p>The Divine Trade Association guessed that the female Mutant originally lived in the Burning Lands until it began receding for an unknown reason. That was why she was roaming the Core Circle. She was probably looking to claim a new territory.</p><p>Countless sects were tempted when they heard this news. A female Mutant who could assume a human form was a recruitable Mutant. Not only was she a massive fighting power, any Outpost she was guarding would never have to worry about being attacked again.</p><p>Take the Crimson Blood Sects Outpost for example. Why was it untouchable even though it had been abandoned for years before Lu Ye showed up? It was because it was protected by the Tyrant, Beaky.</p><p>A few sects had already made contact with the female Mutant. Unfortunately, no one had succeeded in recruiting her yet.</p><p>The female Tyrant happened to be passing through Skysword Peak when suddenly, she dove toward the peak as if she noticed something. She landed right in front of Lu Ye and said in an unclear voice, I found you!</p><p>Lu Ye was reading his books when he looked up and saw the uninvited guest. Feeling an immediate headache, he asked, Why are you here?</p><p>He honestly did not think he would ever meet her again. Moreover, it sounded like she had been looking for him</p><p>The ghost cultivators hiding in the shadows werent expecting this at all. No one knew how Lu Yi Ye had gotten entangled with a Tyrant-level Mutant, not to mention that it looked like they were acquaintances.</p><p>I was looking for you! She said.</p><p>For what?</p><p>I couldnt find the flame anywhere.</p><p>Its gone then.</p><p>Of course she couldnt find it. The True Phoenix Flame had been devoured by the Tree of Glyphs and transformed into Glyph: Fire Phoenix.</p><p>He had to admire her for her persistence though. He did not think she would still be looking for that fire after so long.</p><p>The female Primal shook her head. Impossible. Help me. She then made a grab for Lu Ye regardless of his free will.</p><p>Lu Ye wasnt willing to go with her, of course. Forget that the True Phoenix Flame was long gone, he did not feel like acquainting himself with this Tyrant for any longer than was necessary. It was just too dangerous for his personal wellbeing.</p><p>So, he dodged the grab and suggested, Why dont you try a little longer?</p><p>I couldnt find it. She shook her head stubbornly. Find it for me.</p><p>She then made a grab for Lu Ye again.</p><p>Lu Ye frowned and unsheathed the Inviolable. The female Primal withdrew her hand right before the saber would cut her. Her scarlet pupils contracted slightly as her expression turned unfriendly.</p><p>Dont get handsy. And listen to people when theyre talking to you, Lu Ye warned while holding the saber in front of himself.</p><p>I want that flame! The female Primal replied impatiently. At the same time, her nails elongated into sharp claws while fiery red energy began rolling off her body.</p><p>Meanwhile, the nearby ghost cultivators were stunned by this outcome. They thought that Lu Yi Ye was acquainted with the female Tyrant, and they were right. However, it seemed like this relationship was a hostile one.</p><p>[This is great for us!]</p><p>Lu Ye brushed his thumb against the hilt while lowering his gaze. Nobody likes being pestered. If you keep this up, Ill have to request my brothers and sisters to gang up on you. You dont want that, do you?</p><p>The female Primal immediately swept her gaze across the areas. The ghost cultivators skulking in the shadows blanched like someone had stripped them naked. They knew then that Lu Yi Ye and discovered them a long time ago.</p><p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh</p><p>The ghost cultivators hurriedly revealed themselves and brought out their flying Spirit Artifacts. They immediately escaped in every direction.</p><p>The female Primal turned to look back at Lu Ye, but Lu Ye was already swinging his saber at her.</p><p>After interacting with the female Primal twice, Lu Ye knew that she was as formidable as she was dumb as a rock. Once she had locked her mind onto a certain course of action, she wouldnt change her mind for a long time.</p><p>She had been searching for him all this time so he could look for the True Phoenix Flame for her. He didnt expect her to give up now just because he said no. That was why the only way to force her into abandoning this course of action was to fight her.</p><p>When Lu Ye first encountered her at the Burning Lands, he was only a Heaven Seven cultivator. At the time, he was weak enough that she had nearly killed him after a brief clash.</p><p>He was no longer who he was then, however. Not only was he Heaven Nine, he had been baptized by the Heavens reward three times. With his strength, he had single handedly brought the Thousand Demon Ridge to their knees.</p><p>He did not know if he could defeat the female Primal, but he knew that a negotiation was only possible between equals. This was doubly true for Spirit Beasts.</p><p>The female Primal dodged his first attack effortlessly like she was weightless. However, he had many, many more to throw at her. He attacked her like a furious storm.</p><p>Meanwhile, the news that Lu Yi Ye was fighting against the female Tyrant had spread across the Spirit Creek Battlefield like wildfire. It wasnt long before everyone in Jiu Zhou had heard about it as well.</p><p>The higher-ups of the Thousand Demon Ridge were beyond delighted to hear this. Some of them nearly broke out cackling like a villain.</p><p>Karma was a bitch, and it looked like she had finally caught up to Lu Yi Ye. Although they didnt know why Lu Yi Ye was fighting that female Tyrant, there was no way he could be a match for her!</p><p>The sentiment was shared by every other Thousand Demon Ridge cultivator as well. They could not wait to hear the news that he had died horrifically under the female Tyrants claws and celebrate his demise.</p><p>The ghost cultivators who were at the scene confirmed that the female Tyrant had been targeting Lu Yi Ye from the start. They knew this because the female Tyrant had said, I found you, when she appeared at Skysword Peak. She also discussed something about a flame with him</p><p>In any case, the man and the female Tyrant were engaged in a great battle right now. The ghost cultivators watched from afar while updating their people in real time.</p><p>Countless Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators prayed that the female Tyrant would unleash her true power and crush Lu Yi Ye like the bastard he was. If he was dead, then the Spirit Creek Battlefield would be freed from his tyranny. Naturally, they would not need to prepare the remunerations either.</p><p>However, their hopes and dreams were extinguished as more updates came. As it turned out, Lu Yi Ye was actually powerful enough to fight a Tyrant to a standstill. ùìÅùò™ùëèùëü‚ÑØùí∂ùëë.ùëê‚Ñ¥ùòÆ</p><p>Right now, Lu Ye was clashing against the winged Tyrant in the sky. Both combatants were zipping across the sky and turning it bright red with their attacks.</p><p>Not only was Lu Ye stronger than the female Primal in terms of physical strength, his speed was a match for hers thanks to Soar. In addition, Lu Ye was a Glyphweaver. His bag of tricks allowed him to gain a slight advantage over the female Primal.</p><p>What had been a celebratory atmosphere quickly turned as dead as a wake as they received the latest updates. At the same time, the Thousand Demon Ridge finally realized that Lu Yi Ye was a Tyrant himself. Only a Tyrant could go up against another Tyrant.</p><p>This was the first time in history where a cultivator had reached the level of a Tyrant!</p><p>The battle would continue from day to night, night to day; from the ground to the sky, then from the sky to the ground</p><p>It wasnt until a full day and night later was it finally over.</p><p>(Patreon)&gt;&gt;</p><p>Updated from ùìÅùëñùò£ùò≥‚ÑØùò¢ùò•.ùí∏‚Ñ¥ùëö</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
