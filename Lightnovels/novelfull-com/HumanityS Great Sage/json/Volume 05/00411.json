Soon, a refined young man wearing a robe with long sleeves stepped into the room. Lu Ye was pretty young, but the young man looked even younger than he was. Since everyones Spiritual Power was currently shackled in their bodies, he was unable to determine his cultivation level from his aura. Still, the fact he was in the Core Circle could only mean that he had already switched to a Heaven-Grade cultivation technique. He must be Heaven Seven at least.</p><p>The young man stepped forward and bowed politely. Xiao Changhe greets his Fifth Senior Uncle!</p><p>[Did he just call me and his name]</p><p>Are you Xiang Xinghes?</p><p>Xiao Changhe smiled gently. That is correct. Xiao Xinghe is my father!</p><p>Lu Ye let out an exclamation of realization. Before he joined the Crimson Blood Sect, the Sect Master and his second senior sister were the only ones left in the entire sect. The first senior sister he had met at the Spirit Creek Battlefield, Mo Yuan did not count because she was really the same person as Shui Yuan. However, their personalities and even their body shapes were completely different for some reason. ùìµùôûùì´ùíìùôöùì™ùì≠.ùíÑùì∏ùì∂</p><p>Lu Ye had gradually learned about this after he joined the Crimson Blood Sect.</p><p>Lu Ye also had two senior brothers. His fourth senior brother, Li Baxian was one of them. The other person was his third senior brother, Xiao Xinghe.</p><p>Although Lu Ye had never met the man in his life, the young man before him had called himself Xiao Changhe and addressed Lu Ye as his fifth senior uncle. Naturally, he had made the connection immediately.</p><p>Although they were only one or two years apart, Lu Ye belonged to the same generation as his third senior brother from a sects point of view. It made sense that Xiao Changhe would address him as his fifth senior uncle.</p><p>[I see! My third senior brother is with the Blue Emperor City!]</p><p>It was only now that Lu Ye had found out about this. He knew that the Sect Master had sent his third senior brother away to keep him safe just like Li Baxian, but he not learned that he joined the Blue Emperor City until now.</p><p>He watched Xiao Changhe closely and internally praised his third senior brother for his, ahem, skills. Not only was his son almost the same age as him, he was extraordinarily talented as well.</p><p>Third Senior Brother wanted to meet me, didnt he? Lu Ye asked.</p><p>Earlier, Shui Yuan had messaged him saying that someone would like to meet him. All things considered, it could only be his third senior brother.</p><p>Xiao Changhe nodded. Yes. In fact, my father was going to invite you to the headquarters, but this Yuan Metal Storm had temporarily disabled the Divine Opportunity Columns teleportation ability.</p><p>The Divine Opportunity Columns teleportation required Spiritual Qi to function. Since the Spirit Creek Battlefields World Spiritual Qi was temporarily frozen, of course it wouldnt be able to teleport anyone.</p><p>After that, Xiao Changhe passed over a booklet and said, When my father sensed that the Yuan Metal Storm was about to befall the Spirit Creek Battlefield, he told me to return to the headquarters and take this booklet. He wanted me to give it to you.</p><p>Lu Ye accepted it and took a look. The booklet was only the size of a palm and about a dozen or so pages thick. It looked like it had been sewn using animal skin.</p><p>He flipped it open and saw that it was filled with tiny words. His eyebrows slowly rose as he went through the columns though.</p><p>It was his third senior brothers insight into blade techniques!</p><p>This reminded him of an old memory. His fourth senior brother was with him the first time he had returned to the headquarters from the Spirit Creek Battlefield. At the time, Li Baxian had complained that Lu Ye had picked up a blade like his third senior brother instead of the sword!</p><p>To this day, Lu Ye could still recall Li Baxians sad face.</p><p>Since ancient times, blade wielders had looked down on sword wielders and vice versa. Technically speaking, Li Baxian wouldve cherished Lu Ye all the same no matter which weapon he had chosen, and it was true. That said, Li Baxian would be even fonder of Lu Ye if the young man had picked up the sword.</p><p>This booklet contains some of my fathers insights into his personal blade techniques in recent years. He hopes that it will be of use to you since he is unable to teach you himself.</p><p>It most certainly is. Please thank him on my behalf.</p><p>Lu Ye wasnt just flattering Xiao Changhe when he said this. This booklet was practically a treasure to him since he had been hitting a wall when cultivating his blade technique for a while. He had many ideas, but not many ways to succeed. Even if he did discover a feasible way to succeed, he wasnt quite able to find a point of entry so to speak. Worse, he had no one he could consult or study with.</p><p>He was like a blind man trying to cross a river. He only had the feedback of his subpar senses to rely on.</p><p>That was why his third senior brothers gift was most timely. The difference between having to explore a path entirely on his own and following a guide was like night and day. The destination was the same, but this one booklet would save him so much time and effort.</p><p>My father knew you would say this. He said there is no need for thanks between family members, Xiao Changhe replied smilingly before adding, Fifth Senior Uncle, my father has been cultivating in the Cloud River Battlefield for the past three years. He has not been able to return to Jiu Zhou even once until he ascended to the Real Lake Realm a while ago. That is why hes clueless to anything that happens outside of the Cloud River Battlefield.</p><p>Lu Ye understood what Xiao Changhe was trying to say and nodded. I understand. Please inform my third senior brother that he has nothing to worry about. In the future, I will pay him a visit. Also, please inform him that I, Lu Ye, am a lucky and tenacious man. The Thousand Demon Ridge cannot kill me no matter what they do!</p><p>My father looks forward to meeting you.</p><p>Xiao Changhe made an earnest attempt to get Lu Ye to stay at the Outpost, but in the end Lu Ye took his leave after a brief rest.</p><p>The Thousand Demon Ridge must be looking for him right now. If his location was leaked, the Blue Emperor Citys Outpost would surely be in danger.</p><p>The Yuan Metal Storm stopped not just the Grand Wards from functioning, but also the Divine Opportunity Column from teleporting. Many people would die if the Thousand Demon Ridge invaded the Outpost.</p><p>Lu Ye took off in the direction of the Myriad Poison Forest after leaving the Blue Emperor Citys Outpost.</p><p>He was missing his wooden home more than ever right now. He could not wait to study the gift his third senior brother had given him.</p><p>The first page alone had given him much inspiration and discovery. If he could digest the booklet completely, Lu Ye was certain that his strength would enter a whole new level.</p><p>Meanwhile, a falcon was flying high up in the clouds and looking down at the young man and his tiger. It was no coincidence. At this altitude, Lu Ye would be hardpressed to detect this falcon even if he was searching for it.</p><p>This was especially true after the Yuan Metal Storm had descended on the Spirit Creek Battlefield. He was unable to channel his Spiritual Power into his eyes and focus his eyesight to the maximum range.</p><p>In fact, Lu Yes supernatural sense of danger was greatly diminished without his Spiritual Power. As a result, he did not notice that the Thousand Demon Ridge was executing a certain plan.</p><p>This was possibly the Thousand Demon Ridges final shot at killing Lu Yi Ye. If they failed, they might not get another chance like this. That was why an unbelievable amount of cultivators were mobilizing with the Yi Ye Elimination Front at the helm.</p><p>Lu Ye was surprised that he hadnt encountered a single Thousand Demon Ridge cultivator since he left the Blue Emperor Citys Outpost. Amber was fast, but not so fast that it could outrun all of its pursuers.</p><p>This revelation both puzzled and worried him. Unless his pursuers had fully withdrawn to their Outpost, he shouldve encountered at least one enemy along the way.</p><p>Then again, he was overthinking this. The arrival of the Yuan Metal Storm meant that every Outpost in the Spirit Creek Battlefield was exposed right now. Some cultivators were especially vulnerable in this environment. He supposed that it made sense that they would huddle up in a secure location to protect themselves.</p><p>While Lu Yes powerful mind was diminished without his Spiritual Power, that didnt mean his perception was completely neutralized. If his enemies really were spying on him from nearby, he should be able to detect their gazes.</p><p>While Lu Ye was passing through a canyon, he suddenly felt a disturbance from his Battlefield Imprint. When he checked, he realized that someone had just issued him a challenge request!</p><p>He quickly connected to the Scroll of Supremacy and checked the five rankers below him. He saw the female archer, Gui Yingzi and finally, a body-tempering cultivator he did not recognize.</p><p>Yu Lianzhou and Shi Guang had already ascended to the Cloud River Realm. Naturally, their placement had gone up as well.</p><p>He did not think that the female archer and Gui Yingzi would be bold enough to challenge him. They were powerful, but terrain was a huge factor of their strength. Since Lu Ye was the one being challenged right now, it meant that the right to choose the terrain was in his hands. If Lu Ye were to choose a battlefield that was only tens of meters in radiusand why wouldnt he?both the female archer and the ghost cultivator would be lucky to live to see another day.</p><p>This meant that his challenger had to be the body-tempering cultivator named Zhu Pang!</p><p>[Is it just a coincidence that hes challenging me now, or]</p><p>Lu Ye scanned both his surroundings and the sky above his head, frowning. The reason he was suspicious was because the canyon around him was perfect for an ambush. If he accepted the challenge request and entered the battlefield now, the Thousand Demon Ridge would have the perfect opportunity to surround him. If they managed to block all the entrances before he returned, then he would be hard pressed to escape even if he grew wings!</p><p>Just because he didnt feel someone spying on him, didnt mean that no one was spying on him. It was entirely possible that his spies were spying on him from beyond his eyesight or perception.</p><p>Add to that the fact that he hadnt encountered a single enemy since his departure Lu Ye quickly made up his mind.</p><p>He accepted the challenge request but did not choose the terrain immediately. He could delay this for four hours max before he must enter the battlefield or forfeit by default.</p><p>As if noticing Lu Yes intent, Amber kicked it up a notch and moved even faster. It wasnt long before the canyon was behind them.</p><p>Meanwhile, a ton of messages were being exchanged from where Lu Ye could not detect.</p><p>Lu Yi Ye has accepted the challenge request. Tell Brother Zhu Pang to get ready!</p><p>Zhu Pang is ready, but the battle hasnt begun yet. Lu Yi Ye must be planning on buying time for himself.</p><p>What a shame. He would be dead for sure if we were able to surround him in that location!</p><p>Theres no hurry. We still have a chance. As long as Brother Zhu Pang can delay Lu Yi Ye for an incense stick, we will be able to surround him from every direction. When that happens, not even he would be able to escape!</p><p>Can someone ask Zhu Pang if its possible for him to delay Lu Yi Ye for an incense stick?</p><p>He said hell do his best, but he also urged us to act as quickly as we are able.</p><p>His best isnt enough. We need him to be able to survive an incense stick no matter what. Our forces are just too far away from Lu Yi Ye right now. Without enough time, its physically impossible for him to entrap him. Anyway, Zhu Pang is a body-tempering cultivator, isnt he? Is he seriously saying that he cant even last an incense stick against Lu Yi Ye?</p><p>Zhu Pang said, You can stall Lu Yi Ye yourself if you think youre so hot.</p><p>Hes the final hope of Thousand Demon Ridge! How can he say something so irresponsible? If I was qualified to challenge Lu Yi Ye, I wouldve done so already!</p><p>Cut the nonsense. If you have time to chatter, then you have time to calculate his travel speed and estimate his location. We need to know where hell appear in four hours so we can intercept him there!</p><p>(Patreon)&gt;&gt;</p><p>Visit ùô°ùôûùì´ùôßùíÜùôñùì≠.ùôòùô§ùô¢ for the best novel reading experience</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
