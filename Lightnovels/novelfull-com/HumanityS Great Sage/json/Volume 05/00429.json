He was covered in wounds right now.</p><p>The battle against the female Primal was difficult, but it was also one of the most exhilarating fights of his life.</p><p>Right now, there was no cultivator in the entire Spirit Creek Battlefield who was a match for him.</p><p>Lan Zi Yi could give him a run for his money before he was Heaven Nine, but now, even she was no match for him anymore. The fact that Lan Zi Yi hadnt challenged him in the past two months was the biggest proof of it.</p><p>Now, only a Tyrant could give him a real fight.</p><p>There was no winner or loser in this battle. One could say that they were both winners or losers. Both him and the female Primal were exhausted and fairly wounded at the end of the battle.</p><p>The female Primal might have an underdeveloped brain, but she wasnt so stupid as to have no self-preservation instinct whatsoever. She had escaped to Heavens-know-where to recuperate.</p><p>DYM Chapter 21-22</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>DYM Chapter 21-22</p><p>Lu Ye didnt leave because he was still waiting for the Thousand Demon Ridge to deliver him his goods.</p><p>Night fell. Suddenly, the silence was broken by the sound of breaking leaves.</p><p>Amber immediately grew alert. Yi Yi was watching her surroundings carefully as well. Lu Ye remained seated but gripped the Inviolable in case the enemy decided to attack him.</p><p>He was at his weakest right now. Now was the Thousand Demon Ridges best chance to kill him.</p><p>A cultivator abruptly stepped out into the open. Their outfit clearly marked them as a ghost cultivator. They stopped about thirty meters away from Lu Ye, clasped his hands together in respect, and threw a bulging Storage Bag in Lu Yes direction.</p><p>Yi Yi caught it easily. When she looked up, the ghost cultivator was already gone. From the start, they hadnt revealed their origin or even spoken a word.</p><p>Yi Yi looked thoughtful as she opened the Storage Bag. She found a jade slip with the name of the ghost cultivators sect on it.</p><p>She whispered the name to Lu Ye, and Lu Ye nodded.</p><p>More ghost cultivators showed up after the appearance of the first ghost cultivator. Just the same, they all tossed their Storage Bags in Lu Yes direction before leaving.</p><p>Being forced to submit to your enemys demand was hardly an honorable thing. That was why the ghost cultivators remained perfectly silent from the start to the finish. Jade slips or other identifiers had been placed in the Storage Bags so there was no chance Lu Ye wouldnt know which sect had paid the price, and which hadnt.</p><p>For a time, it felt like Storage Bags were raining from the sky. Even Yi Yi was unable to catch them all immediately.</p><p>A good number of ghost cultivators didnt even show their faces. They simply tossed their Storage Bags from afar and left after confirming that Lu Ye had accepted them.</p><p>There were still three days before Lu Yi Yes ten-day deadline was up, and at first the ghost cultivators were going to wait until the last moment before giving up their Storage Bags. However, they lost even that last bit of resistance after witnessing the great battle between Lu Yi Ye and the female Tyrant.</p><p>Lu Yi Ye was the first ever cultivator to join the rank of tyrants. It was yet another unprecedented achievement. Who in their right mind would dare to risk incurring the young mans wrath after that, not to mention that the fates of the twenty three Outposts were still fresh in their minds?</p><p>Originally, there were some sects who were preparing to negotiate with Lu Yi Ye and see if they could reduce the amount a little. After all, even Tier-One sects would be hard pressed to prepare three hundred thousand Contribution Points worth of goods in ten days.</p><p>Those thoughts were now the furthest thing from their minds. They would rather pay three hundred thousand Contribution Points worth of goods than risk incurring the wrath of a Tyrant.</p><p>The next morning, the amount of Storage Bags piled in front of Lu Ye had exceeded four hundred. Yi Yi looked a little faint as she stared at the Storage Bags and murmured, Were rich, Lu Ye!</p><p>Yes, we are! Lu Ye nodded strongly.</p><p>He gave her the 10-point map and left the inventory to her. Her job was to check if a sect had submitted the appropriate amount of goods before marking them on the 10-point map. It was the kind of tedious work that was perfect for Yi Yi, not to mention that Lu Ye was still recuperating.</p><p>Oh right, leave the Raving Bladesmen Storage Bag for the last, Lu Ye instructed.</p><p>Kay.</p><p>Three days passed by in the blink of an eye. Lu Ye had almost fully recovered, and Yi Yi was done with the tallying. She had also organized all the goods by category.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was impossible to stuff hundreds of Storage Bags into a single Storage Bag. There were just too many items. Despite her best efforts, she was still carrying thirty or so Storage Bags that were filled to the brim. Lu Ye could not help but frown when he saw this. Not only did it look bad, it would definitely affect their ability to fight ùìµùíäùì´ùìªùìÆùì™ùíÖ.ùì¨ùì∏ùô¢</p><p>There was no other option though. Plus, he would rather have to deal with being too rich than the other way around.</p><p>According to the 10-point map, every Outpost within the Core Circle except the twenty three Lu Ye had conquered had delivered their goods. Not a single sect had decided to tempt fate.</p><p>This is the Raving Bladesmens Storage Bag, Yi Yi said while handing a single Storage Bag to Lu Ye. Lu Ye opened it and took a moment to check its contents. He saw Spirit Pills, Spirit Stones, Spirit Artifacts, herbs and more. It would take a while to tally them all and confirm that there were three hundred thousand Contribution Points worth of goods in it. That said, the Raving Bladesmen was a Tier-One sect, and they had chosen to pay him instead of fighting him to the bitter end. Therefore, he was fairly certain they wouldnt try to cheat him.</p><p>However</p><p>Do you think there are three hundred thousand Contribution Points worth of goods in this Storage Bag? Lu Ye suddenly asked Yi Yi.</p><p>I think so? Yi Yi sounded hesitant because she had a feeling that Lu Ye was plotting something.</p><p>If you cant be sure, then that could only mean that theyre trying to cheat us! Lu Ye uttered murderously all of a sudden, How dare the Raving Bladesmen do such a thing! They must not want their Outpost.</p><p>Yi Yis eyes twitched once. What are you planning? She didnt know why Lu Ye was targeting the Raving Bladesmen.</p><p>Lets go to their Outpost! Lu Ye rose to his feet and brought out his flying Spirit Artifact.</p><p>Half a day later, Lu Ye landed outside the Raving Bladesmens Outpost. A sentry immediately noticed his presence and came forth to investigate. He immediately spotted a young man carrying an insane amount of Storage Bags around his waist.</p><p>It was like he was wearing a skirt of Storage Bags. The sentry had never seen anyone carrying this many Storage Bags on their person. He could write the words I am rich on his forehead, and it still wouldnt be as impactful as this.</p><p>Then, the sentry saw the young mans face and blanched. Lu Yi Ye!</p><p>Lu Ye pretended that the sentry did not exist and searched for the grand wards nodes with Insight. Then, he brought out his ward flags and began doing his thing.</p><p>What are you doing, Lu Yi Ye? The sentry could not help but yell in anger when he saw this.</p><p>It was said that Lu Yi Yes ward breaching skill was one of a kind. He always slipped through the grand ward first before going on a killing spree. Naturally, Lu Yes action scared the sentry greatly.</p><p>He had just finished yelling when Lu Ye lifted a corner of the grand ward and walked in. The cultivator immediately backpedaled from the young man and raised his Spirit Artifact defensively. Despite his fear, he shouted, LU YI YE IS HERE!</p><p>The entire Outpost bubbled with activity instantly. Many cultivators appeared from various directions before landing tens of meters away from Lu Ye.</p><p>As expected of a Tier-One sect, dozens of people had arrived less than ten breaths after the sentry had cried out the warning. Their reaction was incredibly swift.</p><p>The cultivators of the Raving Bladesmen had heard of the infamous Lu Yi Ye since forever, but for most of them, this was the first time they saw the man in person. At first glance, he didnt look any different from the average Heaven Nine cultivator. In reality, they knew they were facing down a Tyrant-level existence.</p><p>Despite their numbers advantage, it was clear that the Raving Bladesmen were incredibly nervous. It was almost comical that Lu Ye, the guy who invaded the Outpost alone, was perfectly calm.</p><p>A man with steadfast features stepped out and asked solemnly, Why have you invaded our Outpost, Lu Yi Ye?</p><p>The guy had to be the Legate or the prolegate. No one else would dare to speak to him considering the circumstances.</p><p>Lu Ye tossed the Storage Bag into the air. The man caught it and gave it a quick check before asking with an ugly expression, What is the meaning of this?</p><p>He remembered the Storage Bag and his contents very well. After all, he was the one who had handed it to their ghost cultivator to deliver to Skysword Peak. It was the goods they were supposed to pay Lu Yi Ye to buy his peace.</p><p>The fact that Lu Yi Ye had returned it exactly as it was could not be a good thing.</p><p>Its not enough!</p><p>Are you sure you checked it properly? The guy asked through gritted teeth.</p><p>He was one hundred percent sure there were three hundred thousand Contribution Points worth of goods in the Storage Bag. After all, he was the one who prepared them with a Real Lake Realm elder. He knew better than anyone just how much they were worth.</p><p>Since they had chosen to compromise, of course they werent going to skimp on the payment. It would only bring them trouble.</p><p>If you dont believe me, you can sell them to the Vault of Providence now and see if you can get three hundred thousand Contribution Points in return, Lu Ye said expressionlessly.</p><p>Lu Ye did not know exactly how much the contents of the Storage Bag were worth, but he knew that there was no way the Raving Bladesmen would get three hundred thousand Contribution Points in return if they actually sold them to the Vault of Providence. There was almost a fifty percent difference between the purchase and sell price of an item.</p><p>The Legate turned red in the face. Are you serious right now? Going by Lu Yes calculation, they had to pay double the amount to buy his so-called peace!</p><p>This was just too much!</p><p>Whats the problem?</p><p>What was the problem? The problem was that he knew that everyone else was paying Lu Yi Ye based on the purchase price in the Vault of Providence, not the selling price. It was clear that Lu Yi Ye had it out for them for whatever reason!</p><p>The man was so angry that he let out an incredulous laugh. There is such a thing as too much greed, Lu Yi Ye!</p><p>Did you just talk back to me? Lu Ye stared at him.</p><p>I didnt</p><p>He didnt even get to finish his sentence before he saw Lu Ye turning into a blur and appearing in front of him in the blink of an eye. Noting the deadly flash of red, the man hastily raised his Spirit Artifact to block the attack.</p><p>Boom! A tremendous force sent the man flying. Blood was seeping out of his lips when he landed at the center of a crowd and climbed back to his feet!</p><p>He was stunned. He was ranked twenty or so on the Scroll of Supremacy right now, but he still failed to withstand a normal strike from Lu Yi Ye!</p><p>Hand me twenty blade technique insights. Otherwise, you can say goodbye to your Outpost, Lu Yes voice reverberated throughout the Outpost.</p><p>(Patreon)&gt;&gt;</p><p>This chapter is updated by https://ùò≠ùëñùò£ùìá‚ÑØùò¢ùíπ.ùò§‚Ñ¥ùòÆ</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
