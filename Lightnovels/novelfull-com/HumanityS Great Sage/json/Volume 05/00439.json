It was because there were only a handful of Tattoo Artists in the entire Jiu Zhou.</p><p>To become a Tattoo Artist, one must be incredibly accomplished in the Way of Glyphs and the art of tattooing. Even if a Tattoo Artist was willing to perform the work, the materials needed to ink a Tattoo were so expensive that most people couldnt afford it.</p><p>All Tattoos were based on Glyphs. There were offensive Tattoos, defensive Tattoos, supportive Tattoos and more.</p><p>Lu Ye did not need offensive or defensive Tattoos because he already had Sharp Edge and Protection. He did not need supportive Tattoos either as he already had many supportive Glyphs.</p><p>There was one supportive Glyph that he had been vying for a long time though. That was why he answered Lady Yuns question without hesitation, Void!</p><p>He had first read about Void from the books. Since it wasnt something he learned from the Tree of Glyphs, he was unable to conjure it with a single thought. So far, the greatest thing he ever did with Void was to arrange a Teleportation Ward. Unfortunately, the teleportation range left much to be desired, and the experience even more so.</p><p>Shakespeare: Timeless Master of Wor‚Ä¶</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>Shakespeare: Timeless Master of Words</p><p>Void wasnt just used to set up a Teleportation Ward, however. For example, it could be used to forge special Spirit Artifacts that could be used to store items such as Storage Rings, Storage Bracelets and more.</p><p>The most common storage item used by a cultivator was a Storage Bag. It was because Storage Bags were sewn from a special Spirit Beast skin that could be bred in captivity. It was also why Storage Bags were incredibly cheap and could be owned even by the poorest cultivators.</p><p>However, a Storage Bags storage space was incredibly limited. It was nothing compared to a Storage Ring or a Storage Bracelet!</p><p>Of course, their price was incomparable to a Storage Bag either. The Sect Master was the only one he saw who owned a Storage Ring. Not even his second senior sister owned one. Though to be fair, she didnt own a Storage Bag either.</p><p>Once, Lu Ye indulged in his curiosity and asked his second senior sister how she stored her stuff without a Storage Bag. She had explained that a storage item wasnt the only way to store items.</p><p>For example, a Tattoo with Void at the center could be marked on a cultivators body to create a storage space. This way, the cultivator would not need to carry a Storage Bag anymore.</p><p>The best thing about this storage method was its speed and convenience. Items in the storage space could be produced immediately with a single thought. On the other hand, items in a Storage Bag had to be extracted by hand.</p><p>Besides that, a Tattoos storage space was way bigger than a Storage Bags.</p><p>Lu Ye did not want to carry dozens of Storage Bags on his person ever again.</p><p>Lady Yun nodded when she heard his answer. You are a Glyphweaver, so Void is a good choice. Very well.</p><p>Lady Yun sat down and lay out a bunch of needles of all shapes and sizes beside her. She also pulled out a bottle of amber-colored blood that probably belonged to a Spirit Beast.</p><p>The Way of Tattoos is an interesting one. If you are interested, I can teach you when you are experienced enough in the Way of Glyphs. With a skill like this, youll never have to worry about cultivation resources anymore. People will pay you almost anything for your services, Lady Yun said while opening the bottle of blood. She then dipped a needle into the blood before pushing it into the back of Lu Yes hand. The pain resembled that of a bee sting.</p><p>Every time Lady Yun inserted her needle into his flesh, she would have to dip it in blood. Lu Ye did not know what Spirit Beast it belonged to, but Lady Yun had done the same thing when she was tattooing Wings on his back. This almost certainly meant that Tattoos required special materials to create, and the beast blood used to create a Void Tattoo could not possibly be cheap.</p><p>Sometimes, Lady Yuns movement was as slow as a snails. Sometimes, she moved so fast he could barely follow her. They hurt all the same. Lu Ye quietly observed the work as time passed bit by bit.</p><p>While Lu Ye was getting a Void Tattoo from Lady Yun, a new commotion had struck the Spirit Creek Battlefield. Less than half a day after Lu Yi Ye, one of the Three Banes of Spirit Creek, was gone, a new Crimson Blood Sect disciple had appeared on the Scroll of Supremacy.</p><p>She was Hua Ci, a Heaven-Grade Ninth-Order cultivator.</p><p>To a Spirit Creek Battlefield cultivator, the name could only be described as unfamiliar. Only a handful of people had ever heard of her. The reason they were paying attention to her was because she came from the same sect as Lu Yi Ye, of course!</p><p>Her association with the One Leaf wasnt the only thing that caught their attention, however. It was also rumored that she was a medicine cultivator.</p><p>There were very few medicine cultivators on the Scroll of Supremacy as a matter of course, and none of them were in the top fifty. It was because a medicine cultivators strength was limited even if they dabbled in another cultivation faction. ùò≠ùíæùëèùìáùò¶ùí∂ùò•.ùò§ùò∞ùëö</p><p>If that was all, then they wouldve put her out of their mind. The problem was that she was climbing the Scroll of Supremacy exactly like Lu Yi Ye did! She had started from the bottom and challenged every Thousand Demon Ridge ranker above her! More importantly, everyone she challenged had perished!</p><p>This infuriated the Thousand Demon Ridge as a matter of course. This was practically a reenactment of the tragedy from four months ago. Four months ago, Lu Yi Ye had slaughtered every Thousand Demon Ridge ranker above him and allowed the Grand Sky Coalition to dominate the rank list for a time. Who wouldve thought that the same thing would happen again four months later, and by the hands of a Crimson Blood Sect disciple no less?</p><p>As if that wasnt bad enough, Hua Ci was just a medicine cultivator. Who gave her the gall to do this?</p><p>For a time, every Thousand Demon Ridge ranker above her was filled with righteous fury. It was true they couldnt beat that bastard Lu Yi Ye, but there was no way they couldnt defeat a mere medicine cultivator. They were going to do everything in their power to stop Hua Ci, if only to protect whatever remained of their tattered dignity.</p><p>It wasnt long before they realized in horror that they couldnt. Not only that, Hua Ci was killing their rankers and rising through the ranks at meteoric speed. Worse still, they could not figure out how she had done it.</p><p>Lu Yi Ye had a Tamed Beast whose roar could stun the mind and prevent his opponents from surrendering. But what about Hua Ci? How did she manage to prevent her opponents from surrendering?</p><p>Just what was the Crimson Blood Sect anyway? How did they manage to produce so many monsters?</p><p>At the Summit of Clarity, Lady Yun had already left to catch some rest. Even a Glyphweaver like her felt tired after marking a Void Tattoo for Lu Ye.</p><p>Void was much more complicated than most Glyphs. In the end, it had taken the entire bottle of blood to mark the Tattoo.</p><p>In the room, Lu Ye was examining the new Tattoo and checking out his new storage space. It was easily twenty times the size of a Storage Bags. Now, he no longer needed to worry about space anymore. He could even put the Inviolable in it if he wanted to.</p><p>He usually carried the Inviolable on his waist because it was faster than having to retrieve it from a Storage Bag. Not only was it inconvenient, the slight delay might cost him the chance to kill an enemy.</p><p>He did not need to worry about this anymore. The storage space was at the back of his hand. He could retrieve anything and everything with a single thought.</p><p>Despite this, Lu Ye still chose to carry the Inviolable like he always did. He had long since become accustomed to its weight and texture. It felt like he was missing something if he did not carry it on his person or his hand.</p><p>He followed the female attendant out of the residence after that. He never saw Lady Yun again.</p><p>When he was outside, he channeled his Spiritual Power and shot to the sky.</p><p>He had just ascended to the Cloud River Realm, and there were countless things he had had to acclimatize himself with. Flying without any aid was one of the simplest things he could learn.</p><p>Most people would need several days to get used to flying without aid, and even then they had to be careful not to lose control and fall from the sky.</p><p>Lu Ye had no such problems though. He might not have flown without aid until he ascended to the Cloud River Realm, but he had flown many times using Wings or Soar. One might say that he was fairly experienced in flying.</p><p>Two hours later, he could fly without wobbling and straying off course anymore.</p><p>Another two hours passed, and he could pull all sorts of moves in mid-air.</p><p>He returned to the Summit of Fortitude when it was late evening. After enjoying a delicious dinner at his second senior sisters place, Shui Yuan said, Junior brother, it is time you choose a Spirit Peak of your own.</p><p>Im sorry? Lu Ye tilted his head in confusion.</p><p>Shui Yuan explained, There are over a hundred mountains in Mount Ao, and in the past every mountain would be overflowing with disciples. Thirty years of decline later, the old man and I are the only ones left who are still guarding the Summit of Fortitude because it is the heart of our sect. Even if we count Lady Yun, that is two out of a hundred peaks that are unused and abandoned. Now that youre at the Cloud River Realm, you have the right to own a Spirit Peak. Our sect is doing better and better, and it is only a matter of time before we get more Cloud River Realm cultivators. They cant all stay at the Summit of Fortitude, can they?</p><p>To be clear, Im not chasing you out of the Summit of Fortitude. You might nominally be the Fifth Senior Brother if you consider our history, but youre really the First Senior Brother of this generation. You are also the second disciple in our sect to ascend to the Cloud River Realm besides Ju Jia. It falls on you to set an example for the rest of the disciples.</p><p>Lu Ye nodded in agreement. Very well. I will search for a Spirit Peak then.</p><p>Shui Yuan smiled and put some food on his plate.</p><p>After he was done eating, Lu Ye flew out of the house and rose into the sky. He had flown circles around Mount Ao many times while practicing his flight, and he had seen just as many abandoned buildings on the Spirit Peaks. He could almost imagine how glorious his sect looked at its peak.</p><p>The Summit of Fortitude and Lady Yuns Summit of Clarity were obviously out of the question, but he was free to claim any other Spirit Peak as his own.</p><p>Which one do you like, Yi Yi? Lu Ye asked.</p><p>Yi Yi was floating right next to him. She looked around for a bit before pointing, That one!</p><p>Okay then. Lu Ye didnt have a particular preference in this regard. Any place that was hospitable was fine in his book.</p><p>(Patreon)&gt;&gt;</p><p>This chapter is updated by ùëôùò™ùí∑ùò≥ùëíùò¢ùëë.ùí∏ùëúùëö</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
