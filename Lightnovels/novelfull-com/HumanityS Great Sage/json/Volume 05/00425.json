Long before they even reached the square, they saw a blood-caked man sitting on the steps leading to the sanctum with his saber hanging carelessly beside his waist. There was also a literal hill of Storage Bags in front of him. There had to be one or two hundred of them at least. Judging from his appearance, he seemed to be unlocking the Restraining Locks on the Storage Bags?</p><p>The bloody figure was none other than Lu Ye, of course!</p><p>Fifth senior brother! Feng Yue cried out while rushing to his side.</p><p>Lu Ye turned her way and gave her a nod of acknowledgement. He then looked at Situ Han and said, Youre here.</p><p>The Legate was currently wearing a complex expression on his face. When Lu Ye spoke up, he jolted back to reality and saluted the young man. Are we late, Brother Yi Ye?</p><p>Oh no, youre just in time. I finished up just a moment ago.</p><p>[We ARE late, then.]</p><p>Master Of The Blade Chapter 27</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>Master Of The Blade Chapter 27</p><p>Situ Han had rushed over intending to assist Lu Ye, but not only was the battle already over, it was clear that it had ended with the Mystic Green Sects horrible defeat. He had counted roughly sixty to seventy bodies on his way. If this didnt count as a horrible defeat, he didnt know what was</p><p>Suddenly, he realized that Lu Ye had never intended for them to participate in this battle. That was why he said that they had arrived just in time!</p><p>Did did you kill them all alone, Brother Yi Ye?</p><p>Of course not.</p><p>Situ Han relaxed while thinking to himself, [I shouldve known.] If Lu Ye had done all this by himself, well he wouldnt even know what to say. He didnt spot Lu Yes helpers anywhere though. They had probably hidden themselves or left.</p><p>Amber was a major help in this battle, Lu Ye added while patting Ambers head affectionately.</p><p>[ YOUR TAMED BEAST STILL COUNTS AS YOUR OWN STRENGTH, MAN!]</p><p>Situ Han felt like squeezing his own heart until it burst. At the same time, a dizzy spell hit him with the full force of his incredulity.</p><p>Behind him, the Three Sages School disciples were gulping as well</p><p>Who wouldve thought that one man could cause the massacre around them? The sheer amount of corpses littered in front of the Sanctum of Providence alone wasnt something they could achieve!</p><p>They had long heard that Lu Yi Ye of the Crimson Blood Sect was extraordinarily strong, but it was only now they realized just how strong he was.</p><p>Situ Han sucked in a deep breath before replying, Brother Yi Ye, you called us here because</p><p>To be honest, he couldnt quite figure out why Lu Ye had called them here. If Lu Ye could conquer an entire Outpost himself, then why did he summon them over through Feng Yue. He had thought that Lu Ye was asking for assistance, but clearly that wasnt the case.</p><p>The Three Sages School lost their Outpost because of me, did you not? I also heard that the Mystic Green Palace was a major contributor in that battle. That is why they should be the one to pay the biggest price. An Outpost for an Outpost so to speak. Also, remember the promise my sect made to your Sect Master? I was supposed to cultivate at your Outpost. Unfortunately, I cannot fulfill that promise as I am already Heaven Nine, and I will be leaving the Spirit Creek Battlefield very soon. But before that, it is my responsibility to relieve some pressure for the Three Sages School, no?</p><p>Situ Han didnt know what to say. This wasnt just relieving some pressure, this was crushing their enemy so thoroughly that they could never hope to ride on their heads ever again.</p><p>By the way, I havent touched a single thing in their Outpost. Please help yourselves to anything you want.</p><p>The Three Sages School disciples grew excited. They all understood what he meant by that.</p><p>Situ Han looked even more ashamed. How could we? We havent lifted a finger in this battle</p><p>Back in the Inner Circle, when the Heavenly Derivative Sect had lost their Outpost because of me, I promised them that I would return what they had lost to them. I see no reason to make an exception for the Three Sages School, so please, do not turn down what is rightfully yours. Plus, my disciples may visit your Outpost in the future. When the time comes, I would request that you take good care of them.</p><p>Situ Han finally nodded. In that case, I humbly accept your gift. Just send us a message if anyone from the Crimson Blood Sect decides to cultivate at our Outpost. Our doors will forever be open for your disciples!</p><p>After that, Situ Han stepped into the Sanctum of Providence and began plundering the Mystic Green Palaces Blessings in his capacity as the Legate.</p><p>Lu Ye stayed behind to unlock the Storage Bags while Feng Yue treated his wounds. 𝒍𝓲𝒃𝙧𝓮𝙖𝒅.𝓬𝙤𝓶</p><p>Lu Ye had to admit that Feng Yues cultivation and medicinal skills had improved tremendously since the last time he saw her. As they chatted, he also learned that the Three Sages School treated her very well even though they wouldve been in their right to discriminate against her because of the incidents.</p><p>Then again, she was a medicine cultivator and a sweet woman. Few people would choose to offend a sweet medicine cultivator, not to mention that the Thousand Demon Ridge was truly to blame for the occupation of their Outpost.</p><p>While the Three Sages School was busying themselves, the news that Lu Ye had single handedly destroyed the Mystic Green Palaces Outpost had spread like wildfire.</p><p>Not everyone from the Mystic Green Palace had perished. Around thirty cultivators had managed to teleport away using the Divine Opportunity Column. Of course, the Mystic Green Palace had still lost over seventy percent of their Core Circle cultivators, and they werent going to recover any time soon.</p><p>Everyones first reaction upon hearing the news was, of course, utter denial.</p><p>Even if Lu Yi Ye was extraordinarily powerful, and even if he had ascended Heaven Ninehis cultivation level on the Scroll of Supremacy had been updated after the massacrethere was no way he could annihilate an Outpost single handedly!</p><p>This had never happened in the history of Jiu Zhou. How could Lu Yi Ye do what even Feng Yuechan and Li Baxian couldnt do after honing themselves at the Spirit Creek Realm level for over a decade?</p><p>For a time, countless people messaged the Mystic Green Palace to confirm the veracity of the rumor.</p><p>In the end, they confirmed that it was definitely real.</p><p>Not only had Lu Yi Ye barged into the Outpost alone, it was revealed that he was completely unstoppable from the Grand Ward all the way to their Sanctum of Providence. The Mystic Green Palace was unable to stop him even after they had fallen into a formation meant to be used against a Heavens damned Tyrant-level Spirit Beast.</p><p>It was bad enough that few in the history of their Cultivation World could rival the mans bloodlust and brutality, it was worse that he had the power to carry it out. Core Circle cultivators were as powerless as helpless chicks before the man</p><p>The entire Jiu Zhou was shocked yet again.</p><p>Every Thousand Demon Ridge Outpost in the Core Circle fell into full-blown panic.</p><p>Even the higher-ups could not help but be stunned by the news.</p><p>Although they had a feeling that Lu Yi Ye would probably be strong enough to dominate the entire Spirit Creek Battlefield after he ascended to Heaven Nine, somehow it still escaped their imagination that he would do such a thing so soon after his ascension.</p><p>Were they really about to enter an unprecedented era where a single man ruled it all?</p><p>The Thousand Demon Ridge could not accept this, of course. Was there really no one who could keep that inhuman butcher in check?</p><p>Just half a day later, another stunning news broke out.</p><p>The Waning Moon Pavilion, a Thousand Demon Ridge Outpost not far away from the Mystic Green Palace had been occupied as well!</p><p>Once again, Lu Yi Ye had done it all by himself!</p><p>The Mystic Green Palace was a Tier-Three Sect with not even a single Scroll of Supremacy ranker in their midst. They only had a handful of Heaven Nine cultivators as well. They could claim that the Mystic Green Palace was conquered because they werent strong enough, but the same could never be said for the Waning Moon Pavilion. Why? It was because the Waning Moon Pavilion was a Tier-One sect!</p><p>Not only did the Waning Moon Pavilion have far more Heaven Nine cultivators than the Mystic Green Palace, one of them was a Scroll of Supremacy ranker in the fifties. Despite this, they were forced back to Jiu Zhou after suffering huge casualties.</p><p>Technically speaking, the Waning Moon Pavilions casualties werent nearly as terrible as the Mystic Green Palaces. Having been warned of Lu Yi Yes arrival beforehand, they were prepared for his arrival. They had fought him in formation and retreated in an organized fashion when it became clear that they wouldnt win.</p><p>Despite this, they still lost over forty people. That was forty cultivators who would definitely make it to the Cloud River Realm if they hadnt had the misfortune of going up against the butcher known as Lu Yi Ye. The higher-ups of the Waning Moon Pavilion could barely stop themselves from spitting blood.</p><p>If the Thousand Demon Ridge wasnt too worried when the Mystic Green Palace was occupiedmany people told themselves that the reason they were conquered was because they were too weakthey were now. If even a Tier-One sect could not stop the bastard, who else in the Spirit Creek Battlefield was safe from his wrath?</p><p>The next day, a third Thousand Demon Ridge Outpost was conquered. It was the one neighboring the Mystic Green Palace and the Waning Moon Pavilion.</p><p>The Thousand Demon Ridge was both furious and aghast that history had repeated itself. Back in the Inner Circle, Lu Ye still needed to create an entire invasion force to conquer their Outposts. Now? He didnt even need an army anymore. He was conquering Outposts left and right all by himself.</p><p>No wonder people called him the Vanquisher of Sects!</p><p>You could get a persons name wrong, but never their earned name.</p><p>Back then, the Thousand Demon Ridge had assembled an army of their own to stop Lu Yi Ye and force the Grand Sky Coalitions army into a stand-off. At the same time, their Divine Ocean Realm cultivators negotiated a compromise with their Grand Sky Coalition counterparts. It was only after they paid an incredible sum of resources that the matter was finally settled.</p><p>They could not do the same here though. Even if they could muster the manpower, literally no one could catch up to Lu Yi Ye now that he was Heaven Nine. And if they couldnt catch up to him, what could their people possibly do against him?</p><p>For a time, countless champions found themselves with a massive headache. Eventually, they realized in horror that they literally did not have a single effective means to control Lu Yi Ye. The only way they could think of that might work was to abandon all their Outposts, form a super army, and take out every Grand Sky Coalition Outpost in the Core Circle. That would be the lets all die together scenario.</p><p>However, the last resort did not affect Lu Yi Ye one bit. They couldnt even target his Outpost because it was located at the outermost ring of the Outer Circle. The entire Core Circle could turn into a wasteland, and it still wouldnt affect him one bit.</p><p>While the Thousand Demon Ridge was discussing strategy, Lu Ye continued to conquer one Core Circle Outpost after the other. Even the Tier-One sects felt as fragile as paper before Lu Yi Ye. At first, there were a number of sects who refused to believe that Lu Yi Ye was as strong as the rumors claimed and attempted to stop him with sheer numbers. They retreated only after Lu Ye had given them a bloody wake-up call. 𝒍𝓲𝒃𝙧𝓮𝙖𝒅.𝓬𝙤𝓶</p><p>(Patreon)&gt;&gt;</p><p>Visit 𝑙𝒾𝒷𝘳𝑒𝑎𝒹.𝑐𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
