Although Su Zining was the host and the Legate of the Green Feather Mountain, it was clear that he was acting more reserved than normal. Naturally, everyone else only fared worse.</p><p>The Green Feather Mountain was just a Tier-Eight sect with a Real Lake Realm cultivator as their champion. They did have a couple Spirit Creek Realm cultivators in the Core Circle right now, but they would never make it to Heaven Nine because of their talent. One could even say that they had never had a Heaven Nine cultivator since their sect was founded.</p><p>Understandably, having a Scroll of Supremacy champion in his Outpost like Lu Ye put a lot of pressure on Su Zining. He didnt even know why Lu Ye had suddenly decided to pay them a visit.</p><p>After an exchange of pleasantries, Lu Ye asked, How is senior brother Tang Wu doing?</p><p>Senior brother Tang Wu has ascended to the Cloud River Realm, Su Zining answered.</p><p>Lu Ye wasnt surprised. Tang Wu was already a Ninth-Order cultivator two years ago. He should have ascended to the Cloud River Realm some time ago.</p><p>Lu Ye was pretty sure he had ascended as a Heaven Seven or Heaven Eight cultivator though.</p><p>DYM Chapter 41-42</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>DYM Chapter 41-42</p><p>He also asked about Xie Jin, Qiao Qiao Er, Song Xie, Tao Tian Gang, Mu Ling and more. They were all people he had fought alongside with and were indebted to in some ways.</p><p>Su Zining answered, Brother Xie, Sister Qiao and Sister Mu have entered the Inner Circle. Unfortunately, Brother Song and Brother Tao have passed away.</p><p>Lu Ye was silent for a while. It had only been two years, and some of his acquaintances were already gone forever. Unfortunately, constant danger was the price all cultivators must pay to grow stronger.</p><p>Su Zining was beyond curious. If you dont mind me asking, how do you know so many of my senior brothers and sisters, Senior Brother Yi Ye?</p><p>Lu Ye smiled. Havent they told you about the battle at the One Hundred Peaks two years ago? Your senior brothers and sisters and I fought side by side back then.</p><p>Su Zining exclaimed in wonderment. He really had no idea about this. No wonder Lu Ye had purposely paid their sect a visit.</p><p>He immediately felt much closer to the Scroll of Supremacy champion.</p><p>Should I inform my senior brothers and sisters of your arrival and tell them to come back?</p><p>Its okay, Lu Ye waved him off immediately, It is a long journey from here to the Inner Circle. I dont want to waste their time when they can be cultivating. I really came today to make a request. Ill take my leave once Im done with my business.</p><p>What is it that you need, Brother Yi Ye? We will do our best to fulfill your request.</p><p>I very much appreciate that. Lu Ye said slowly, I would like to enter the Dragon Spring!</p><p>Su Zining looked puzzled. But Brother Yi Ye, youre already at Heaven Nine. I do not think the Dragon Spring will be able to help you much.</p><p>Lu Ye shook his head. I have my reasons.</p><p>He then untied a Storage Bag from his waist and pushed it across the table. Im sorry to trouble you, but I would like you to return to your headquarters and speak to your elders about my request. Im aware its not time for the Dragon Spring to open yet, so this is my payment for disrupting your schedule.</p><p>Su Zining hurriedly said, This is but a simple matter, Brother Yi Ye. You do not need to pay me anything.</p><p>Lu Ye smiled and slapped the Storage Bag on his hands. Treat this as my gift to the Green Cloud Mountain then. Leave it to your elders to decide what to do with it.</p><p>Su Zining thought for a moment before nodding. Very well, Brother Yi Ye. Please wait a moment while I return to the headquarters!</p><p>Thank you again for making time for me.</p><p>Lu Ye waited patiently in the guest room while Su Zining left to convey his request. Just an hour later, the Legate returned with an old man.</p><p>Lu Ye rose to his feet as Su Zining introduced the old man, Brother Yi Ye, this here is Elder Ye Yang.</p><p>Lu Ye saluted him respectfully. Well met, Elder Ye.</p><p>Barring exceptions like the Crimson Blood Sect, all Elders must be Real Lake Realm cultivators. The old man looked like he was Heaven Eight only because he was at the Spirit Creek Battlefield right now.</p><p>Ye Yang looked Lu Ye up and down once before stroking his beard. Your reputation precedes you, Lu Yi Ye of the Crimson Blood Sect. I can see that you more than deserve your reputation.</p><p>You praise me too much, Elder Ye. My apologies for making you come all the way here, Lu Ye returned politely.</p><p>He was aware that Elder Ye was treating him with the utmost respect because one, he was deserving of that respect, and two, the Storage Bag he gave to Song Zining contained three hundred thousand Contribution Points worth of goods. He had prepared it specifically for this visit.</p><p>Why else would an Elder purposely come to the Spirit Creek Battlefield to meet him in person? It wasnt cheap for a Real Lake Realm cultivator to teleport into the Spirit Creek Battlefield.</p><p>Now youre the one whos being excessive, young friend. In any case, let us sit before we talk about business, shall we? Ye Yang said.</p><p>After they had all taken a seat, Ye Yang started, I heard that you wish to enter the Dragon Spring?</p><p>Yes. Is that okay?</p><p>Ye Yang answered smilingly, If you were someone else, then my answer would be no. But since its you, it is no problem at all.</p><p>Oh? Whys that?</p><p>Ye Yang replied, To enter the Dragon Spring, one must acquire the permission of my Green Feather Sect, the Tai Luo Clan and the Qin Family. If any one of us disagrees, then the Dragon Spring cannot be opened. Naturally, most people would be turned away no matter how prestigious they are. You are a different story though. Im sure theyll agree if they know that youre the one who made the request.</p><p>The Tai Luo Clan and the Qin Family would need to have a death wish to say no to the Vanquisher of Sects. While it was tacitly agreed that Outer Circle business should be handled to the Outer Circle, the Thousand Demon Ridge had broken this unspoken rule multiple times in their attempts to kill Lu Ye. As a result, they did not have a leg to stand on even if Lu Ye overtly broke that rule and bent the Tai Luo Clan and the Qin Family to his will.</p><p>I see! Lu Ye nodded. I suppose I will have to visit the Tai Luo Clan and the Qin Family then!</p><p>Thats right. Ye Yang nodded. You already know our answer. All you need to do is to get a yes from them as well. ùô°ùíäùíÉùìªùíÜùíÇùì≠.ùôòùì∏ùì∂</p><p>Ye Yang didnt even ask why Lu Ye wanted to visit the Dragon Spring because of the gift. He was a wise old man. Every cultivator had a secret or two they must keep, and only an idiot would openly ask about it.</p><p>Lu Ye immediately rose to his feet and said, I shall see you in a bit then.</p><p>Ye Yang grinned. Yes. I shall await the good news at the Dragon Spring Peak.</p><p>The Tai Luo Clan and the Qin Familys Outposts were only ten kilometers or so from the Green Feather Mountain. That was the case for other Outer Circle Outposts as well. Their cultivators cultivation level was low after all. If the Outposts were placed too far apart, then they would clash against one another only once in a blue moon.</p><p>In just a tea time, Lu Ye had arrived at the Tai Luo Clans Outpost.</p><p>Lu Ye did not have a good impression of the Tai Luo Clan. At the beginning, it was Han Zhe Yue of the Tai Luo Clan who had pursued him. Not only that, she was the one who exposed his identity at the Goldentip and forced him to battle forty plus Sixth-Order enemies in a row.</p><p>When the Grand Ward was in sight, Lu Ye descended from the sky and unsheathed the Inviolable. It was just a normal swing empowered by two Sharp Edges, but the Grand ward still shattered in one blow!</p><p>The Grand Wards in the Outer Circle were generally weaker than those in the Inner Circle and Core Circle not because they were stingy and purchased an inferior product, but because the concentration of the World Spiritual Qi in the Outer Circle was thinner.</p><p>The better the World Spiritual Qi, the stronger the Grand Ward. One could say that the concentration of an Outposts World Spiritual Qi directly affected the strength of their Grand Ward.</p><p>At Lu Yes current strength, there wasnt a single Outpost in the Outer Circle whose grand ward could withstand a hit from him.</p><p>Grand Wards did not break soundlessly. The loud noise immediately attracted the Tai Luo Clans attention as cultivators swarmed out of their dwellings like ants. No one knew what was going on until someone saw Lu Ye hovering in the sky on his Spirit Boat. Panic immediately spread throughout their ranks.</p><p>A Seventh-Order cultivator stepped out and forced himself to say, Who are you, fellow cultivator? Why have you broken our Grand Ward?</p><p>He did not recognize Lu Ye, but he was one hundred percent certain that Lu Ye was a Grand Sky Coalition cultivator. No ally would break their Grand Ward by force. As if that wasnt bad enough, their aura marked them as a Heaven Grade cultivator.</p><p>It was also why the Seventh-Order cultivator was confused. What kind of Core Circle cultivator would come to the Outer Circle and bully an Outer Circle Outpost?</p><p>I am Lu Yi Ye of the Crimson Blood Sect! Lu Ye replied in an indifferent tone.</p><p>The Green Feather Mountains cultivators failed to remember him immediately after Lu Ye reported his name, but not the Tai Luo Clan. Without exaggeration, every Tai Luo Clan cultivator turned as white as a sheet while backing away from Lu Ye like he was a monster.</p><p>Tell your elders that I wish to speak with them. I will be waiting for them at the Dragon Spring Peak! Lu Ye said this before flying away.</p><p>He was more than capable of killing everyone in the Outpost, but the thought had never crossed his mind. Forget that only a weakling would murder someone weaker than them, he was a Heaven Nine cultivator right now. Heavens know how many Contribution Points he was going to lose if he actually went on a killing spree.</p><p>Chaos rippled across the Tai Luo Clans Outpost for a moment. When someone brought the news back to the headquarters, panic rippled across the higher-ups as well. No one knew why the Vanquisher of Sects had suddenly visited their Outpost and demanded them to show up at the Dragon Spring Peak.</p><p>Lu Ye did the same thing when he arrived at the Qin Familys Outpost. He shattered their grand ward in one strike before giving them the same message.</p><p>A while later, Lu Ye arrived at the Dragon Spring Peak of One Hundred Peaks.</p><p>Two years ago, he had entered the Dragon Spring to temper his body. He even obtained a dragon scale from it.</p><p>Today, he had returned as a reborn person.</p><p>There was a great hall on the peak of Dragon Spring Peak. The Green Feather Mountain and the Tai Luo Clan had built them together. The passage leading to the Dragon Spring was hidden beneath the great hall.</p><p>(Patreon)&gt;&gt;</p><p>Read latest chapters at ùìÅùò™ùò£ùò≥‚ÑØùí∂ùò•.ùò§ùëúùìÇ Only</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
