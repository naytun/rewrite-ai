Not only was he familiar with them, they were among the first batch of cultivators to join the Crimson Blood Sect. The only reason they were still here was because they were independent cultivators, and their talent was so-so at best. That was why one of them was still at the Sixth-Order Realm, and the other the Seventh-Order Realm.</p><p>Despite this, this was a far better outcome than the life goal they had set for themselves when they first became cultivators. They were only Third and Fourth-Order Realms when they first joined the Crimson Blood Sect, and they were sure that they would never go higher than the Seventh or Eighth-Order Realm. But now? They thought they could aim a little higher.</p><p>The Crimson Blood Sect Outposts cultivation environment was excellent and not lacking in cultivation resources. That was why even the independent cultivators from way back then had managed to surpass expectations.</p><p>Lu Ye looked at the Seventh-Order cultivator and declared, Duan Yi!</p><p>I am here.</p><p>Earthly Deity Chapter 43</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>Earthly Deity Chapter 43</p><p>Transfer your authority to Cheng Mu now.</p><p>Cheng Mu was the Sixth-Order cultivator.</p><p>Yes, sir.</p><p>Duan Yi replied respectfully before making a formal request to the Heavens to transfer his prolegate authority and seal to Cheng Mu.</p><p>When he was done, Lu Ye then transferred his Legate authority and seal to Duan Yi.</p><p>With this, Duan Yi had become the Legate, and Cheng Mu the prolegate of the Crimson Blood Sect.</p><p>Lu Ye had not chosen Cheng Mu to be the prolegate. It was his second senior sister who suggested it after he inquired her opinion about it.</p><p>Currently, the young blood of the Crimson Blood Sect was still too young to be able to carry the sect on their backs. That was why they had no choice but to choose the next Legate and prolegate from the earliest disciples.</p><p>It was true that Duan Yi and Cheng Mu werent very talented, but they were steady and competent. They were also strong enough to lead the Outpost as the Legate and the prolegate for now.</p><p>On a related note, the reason they didnt choose another Seventh-Order cultivator to be the prolegate was because all cultivators who reached the Eighth-Order Realm were expected to leave the Outpost.</p><p>Making a Sixth-Order cultivator the prolegate meant that they wouldnt have to find a successor too soon, and Cheng Mu should be able to take over as the Legate when it was Duan Yis time to leave.</p><p>When Gu Yang was the prolegate, I told him to locate his successors as soon as possible. That advice applies to the two of you as well. I leave the Outpost to you two.</p><p>We will not disappoint the sect or you, fifth senior brother, they said in unison.</p><p>Lu Ye nodded. Cultivate hard, and do not be too concerned about your talent. I promise you that your future will not end in the Outer Circle.</p><p>After the duo were gone, Lu Ye finally left the meeting hall and took to the sky. When he landed on a Spirit Peak, Beaky flew over to receive Lu Yes offering as usual. It swallowed all the Blood Sturgeons Lu Ye had captured in one gulp like it was swallowing worms. It looked pretty happy.</p><p>While stroking its feathers, Lu Ye said, When my first senior brother left the Spirit Creek Battlefield, he told you to protect the Outpost. The sect has survived its hardest times, and it will only get better in the future. So you dont need to stay here anymore. If you wish to leave and see the world, then leave. If you dont, well, Im certainly not going to complain. One way or another, the sect will always welcome you back with open arms.</p><p>Beaky was a Tyrant-level Spirit Beast. Of course it could understand Lu Ye.</p><p>The Crimson Blood Sect had declined for thirty years, and Beaky had watched over it for just as long. Even when there wasnt a single disciple in the Outpost, it remained faithful to his first senior brothers orders and protected it all day and night. Eventually, it even became a Tyrant.</p><p>Beaky was incredibly loyal, but it was still an eagle. An eagle naturally yearned for freedom and the blue sky. In consideration of their current situation and its faithful service, Lu Ye believed it was finally time to give it the freedom to choose its own future. No matter what Beaky chose, he would accept its choice.</p><p>A moment later, Lu Ye took to the sky and disappeared.</p><p>Not long after, a magnificent eagles cry resounded throughout the Outpost as well. The Crimson Blood Sect disciples looked up and saw Beaky flying further and further into the horizon.</p><p>Lu Ye flew toward the east at high speed.</p><p>Five days later, he passed over on a mountain with a flat and barren plateau.</p><p>The mountain was oddly shaped. It looked like an ultimate champion had literally cut off its top with a blade or something because it was as flat and smooth as a mirror.</p><p>There were also some blackened blood stains on the peak; proof that a great battle had once happened here.</p><p>It was none other than the Goldentip!</p><p>Back then, he had fought forty-three matches in a row and killed countless Sixth-Order cultivators as a Fifth-Order cultivator. In the end, he was able to win a sliver of hope for himself.</p><p>It was the place where Lu Ye had first made his name.</p><p>It was the place where a legend was born.</p><p>It had almost been two years since then. Time truly passed quickly.</p><p>Not everyone could grow from Fifth-Order to Heaven Nine in just two years. His cultivation speed was only rivaled by the most talented cultivators of the greatest sects.</p><p>It was rumored that an opportunity could be found on the Goldentip because its unnatural plateau was supposedly created by a blade-wielding champion. They claimed that the remnants of that champions blade technique could be found here, though Lu Ye personally could not sense anything unusual.</p><p>Another day passed, and this time he passed through a valley surrounded by a Spirit Peak.</p><p>This was the place where he had shouted, Lu Ye is here! while riding Amber.</p><p>That day, Lan Yudie and the cultivators of the Northern Star had intercepted his pursuers for him</p><p>He was retreading the path he had walked two years ago.</p><p>Two years ago, he was as weak as an ant. He, Yi Yi and Amber had departed from the Green Cloud Mountain and journeyed toward the Crimson Blood Sects Outpost with a 10-point map to guide them. It was one of the most difficult journeys of his life.</p><p>Two years had passed since. Today, it only took him a day to retread a path that the old him couldnt have trod on foot in two months.</p><p>Today, he had grown strong enough to be labeled a Tyrant.</p><p>All kinds of thoughts and feelings passed through his mind.</p><p>The skies of the Outer Circle were very peaceful. The chance one might run into another flier was almost non-existent compared to the Core Circle.</p><p>The cultivators of the Outer Circle were weak after all. They couldnt even fly on a flying Spirit Artifact yet.</p><p>The 10-point map indicated that he was currently at the Green Feather Mountain.</p><p>There were also two Thousand Demon Ridge sects nearby, namely the Tai Luo Clan and the Qin Family.</p><p>At the intersection point of the three sects was a mountain range that was literally made up of a hundred mountains called One Hundred Peaks. Two years ago, Lu Ye had killed plenty of Tai Luo Clan and Qin Family cultivators at that place.</p><p>He landed outside the Green Cloud Mountains Outpost and observed their grand ward for a moment.</p><p>The grand ward of an Outer Circle sect was way lousier than a Core Circle sect. Not only that, their sentries were far less perceptive. When Lu Ye attacked a Core Circle Outpost, the sentries would always discover him at first notice and panic. ùíçùì≤ùíÉùôßùìÆùôñùíÖ.ùì¨ùô§ùì∂</p><p>But here, they never even realized he was there until much, much later.</p><p>Finally, a cultivator who happened to be passing by the area caught sight of Lu Ye and grew alert.</p><p>Lu Ye was just about to identify himself when suddenly, he felt the mysterious power of the Heavens enveloping him.</p><p>It was time for the Heavens reward yet again.</p><p>This would be the fourth time he received the reward after becoming champion. Judging from his experience, it probably wouldnt do much for him.</p><p>He did not resist. He allowed the Heavens to teleport him to the Pool of Heavens.</p><p>It was exactly as Lu Ye had predicted. The Spirit Mist in the Pool of Heavens was as thick as ever, but its effects on his person were minimal at best. It was the same for Yi Yi and Amber. They had gained as much as they possibly could from the Pool of Heavens.</p><p>In other words, Lu Ye could stay at the Spirit Creek Realm for another month, and it wouldnt do him any good. He had gained absolutely everything he could in terms of reward, cultivation level, and rewards. It was time to ascend to the Cloud River Realm.</p><p>At the same time, the cultivator who caught sight of Lu Ye before he disappeared had summoned some reinforcements to his side. Among them was the Legate himself, Su Zining.</p><p>Where is this strange man you speak of? Su Zining looked around but couldnt find anyone.</p><p>He was here a moment ago before he suddenly disappeared, The cultivator who saw Lu Ye explained while pointing at the location he was at.</p><p>He suddenly disappeared? Su Zining frowned. Could it be a ghost cultivator?</p><p>Only ghost cultivators could suddenly vanish into thin air.</p><p>Did you see what his cultivation level was? Su Zining asked.</p><p>No. He vanished before I could check.</p><p>Su Zining turned serious. Tell everyone to stay alert. They are to report to me immediately if they notice anyone or anything that is suspicious.</p><p>Until he knew who this mysterious person was and what his intentions were, the only response to such an incident was to prepare for the worst.</p><p>The cultivators responded to his order affirmatively. Hundreds of Green Feather Mountain cultivators immediately got ready for battle.</p><p>Lu Ye hadnt expected his appearance to alarm the Green Feather Mountain so. The timing was just too coincidental. He had just caught the attention of a Green Feather Mountain cultivator when the Heavens whisked him away to the Pool of Heavens.</p><p>An hour later, when Lu Ye reappeared outside the Green Feather Mountains Outpost once more, he looked up and saw a couple of cultivators looking at him warily. One of them yelled, Who are you?</p><p>Lu Ye reported, I am Lu Ye of the Crimson Blood Sect! I have come to visit the Green Feather Mountain!</p><p>The Green Feather Mountain was a Grand Sky Coalition sect. That was why he hadnt entered their Outpost without permission, not to mention that he owed them a favor.</p><p>Lu Ye of the Crimson Blood Sect? A cultivator repeated with a frown. He thought that the name sounded very familiar, but he wasnt able to recall it immediately.</p><p>It had been over a year since Lu Ye left the Outer Circle. While they were aware of his exploits, they didnt remember him nearly as well as a cultivator from the Inner Circle or the Core Circle. That was why the cultivator wasnt able to recall Lu Ye immediately.</p><p>It only took the cultivator a few extra seconds to put two and two together though. He pointed a shaky finger at Lu Ye and stuttered, Y-youre the champion of the Scroll of Supremacy, Lu Yi Ye!</p><p>That was another reason he hadnt made the connection immediately. Everyone knew him as Lu Yi Ye, not his real name.</p><p>Yeah! It is him!</p><p>Excitement immediately gripped the cultivators. Some of them hurried into the Outpost to report Lu Yes arrival.</p><p>How often did an Outer Circle cultivator get to meet a champion of the Scroll of Supremacy? The answer was not at all. That was why they were so excited. These days, Lu Yi Ye of the Crimson Blood Sect was synonymous with invincibility within the Grand Sky Coalition. After all, how many people could earn ludicrous titles like The Vanquisher of Sects or The Three Banes of Spirit Creek?</p><p>(Patreon)&gt;&gt;</p><p>This chapter is updated by ùò≠ùëñùò£ùìá‚ÑØùò¢ùíπ.ùò§‚Ñ¥ùòÆ</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
