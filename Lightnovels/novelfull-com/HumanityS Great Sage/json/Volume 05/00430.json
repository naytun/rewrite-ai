The Northern Profound Sword Clan was famous for their sword technique, and sword cultivators loved to pay them a visit and cultivate their attainment in the Way of Swords at their headquarters.</p><p>However, Lu Ye was a blade cultivator, so the Northern Profound Sword Clan was the opposite of what he wanted. The Raving Bladesmen was a blade-focused sect, but he couldnt pay them a visit for obvious reasons. If he dared to visit their headquarters, forget tomorrows sun, he wouldnt even live to see tonights moon.</p><p>While he couldnt visit their headquarters, their Outpost at the Spirit Creek Battlefield was a completely different story. He wasnt asking for their elites to teach them in person either. He just wanted twenty random booklets of insights like what his third senior brother gave him.</p><p>This was the real reason he targeted the Raving Bladesmen of all sects.</p><p>Now the cultivators of the Raving Bladesmen understood why Lu Ye had come here. His claim that the items in the Storage Bag werent worth three hundred thousand Contribution Points was, of course, bullshit. He was really here to get their cultivation insights.</p><p>DYM Chapter 41-42</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>DYM Chapter 41-42</p><p>Meanwhile, some people lost control and charged Lu Ye after seeing that he had injured their Legate.</p><p>In response, Lu Ye lowered his gaze and pointed his saber at the ground. Spiritual Power began rising from his person.</p><p>When the Legate saw this, he hurriedly shouted, Stop!</p><p>He let out an audible sigh of relief when his cultivators complied.</p><p>He absolutely could not allow his cultivators to fight Lu Yi Ye. It would only end with the death and destruction of their people. The Mystic Green Palace was the best example of that!</p><p>The first sect Lu Yi Ye had conquered in the Core Circle was the Mystic Green Palace, and over seventy percent of their cultivators had been slaughtered by him. Heavens only know how long it would take them to recover.</p><p>If Lu Yi Ye could kill seventy percent of the Mystic Green Sects cultivators, of course he could do the same to the Raving Bladesmen. Even worse, they would lose their Outpost. That was tens of generations of hard work gone just like that.</p><p>After taking a moment to calm his breathing, the man said, Moderation is a virtue, Lu Yi Ye.</p><p>If you think you are not qualified to make a decision, I am perfectly fine with you discussing my terms with someone who can. Im a busy man, so you have an hour. If I do not receive a satisfactory response in an hour, then prepare to say goodbye to your Outpost!</p><p>The Legate stared at Lu Ye for a long time before he finally said something to the person standing next to him in a low tone. Then, he left in a hurry.</p><p>As Lu Ye suspected, the Legate wasnt qualified to make such a decision. This was something he must speak with his elders and superiors to obtain a decision.</p><p>Lu Ye returned the Inviolable to its sheath. After maneuvering the sheath in front of him and placing both hands on the hilt, he closed his eyes and waited for the Raving Bladesmen to give her an answer.</p><p>While waiting, the other Raving Bladesmen cultivators glared at him hatefully from tens of meters away. No one dared to act recklessly as their Legate had specifically told them to stay put before leaving. So, they vented their anger and frustration through their gazes.</p><p>Some people were also watching Lu Ye curiously. He was an infamous figure, but most of them had only seen his picture or heard about him.</p><p>Time passed little by little. Suddenly, a fearsome-looking female cultivator stepped out of the crowd and walked up to Lu Ye. She was holding a cup of tea.</p><p>You must have traveled a ways to come to our Outpost. Please, have some tea!</p><p>Lu Ye opened his eyes and looked down on her.</p><p>The female cultivator smiled tauntingly, Or are you too afraid to enjoy our hospitality?</p><p>It was true they couldnt defeat Lu Ye, but it was one thing to accept the unchangeable and another to resign oneself completely.</p><p>Their Legate had warned them not to clash against Lu Ye before leaving. However, they were only serving him tea, not fighting him. This was just basic hospitality, was it not?</p><p>If they were Lu Ye, then they would never drink the tea. After all, the tea could be poisoned. Even if it wasnt, who would risk their lives to test something like this?</p><p>This was their way of pushing back against Lu Ye and extinguishing his arrogance.</p><p>If Lu Ye did not accept the tea, then they were absolutely going to make Lu Yi Ye the Coward his new nickname. The guy had earned plenty of nicknames already. He could definitely handle one more.</p><p>The female cultivator was just thinking this when Lu Ye grabbed the tea cup out of her hands and drank it in one gulp.</p><p>It could be poisoned, sure, but it could never kill him!</p><p>The female cultivators eyes twitched violently. The tea was, in fact, not poisoned, but only because she didnt expect Lu Yi Ye to be bold enough to drink it. She immediately regretted not putting some deadly poison in the tea. If she failed, then whatever. If she succeeded, then the entire world would thank her for her contributions. Now, it looked like she really had come to serve him tea</p><p>The Raving Bladesmens Legate did not wait an hour to return. When he showed up, Lu Ye interrupted him before he could speak, Just so you know, you are in no position to negotiate. The Raving Bladesmen has existed for many years, and countless champions have been born under your sect. I refuse to believe you cannot hand me twenty blade technique insights.</p><p>Whatever the Legate wanted to say died in his mouth. His elders had, in fact, instructed him to negotiate with Lu Ye to the best of his abilities. Although they had multiple copies of the insights, to give them to Lu Yi Ye was to assist him in his growth. This was completely different from the assortment of goods they had given him earlier. Naturally, they wanted to minimize their contribution as much as possible.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Ye predicted that they would do this. That was why he shut the Legate up before he even got the chance to speak.</p><p>The Legate stared at Lu Ye for a moment before throwing a Storage Bag to Lu Ye. Lu Ye caught it and inspected it immediately.</p><p>The Storage Bag hadnt been locked with a Restraining Lock, so he grabbed a random book and went through it for a bit. Judging from the fact that the ink wasnt even dry yet, he was certain that it had only been written a while ago.</p><p>He checked the contents for a bit and confirmed that the Raving Bladesmen hadnt tried to swindle him. He did the same for the next few books and arrived at more or less the same conclusion.</p><p>Finally, Lu Ye put the books back into the Storage Bag and held out his hand to the Legate. You can give it back now!</p><p>The Legate asked darkly, What are you talking about?</p><p>[Is the bastard seriously still asking for more?]</p><p>Lu Ye said matter-of-factly, Im talking about the payment I demanded ten days ago, of course!</p><p>The Legate stared at Lu Ye in disbelief. You you already took our insights, and you still want it back?</p><p>Are you joking right now? Lu Ye asked expressionlessly, This is this, and that is that. Of course, if you dont mind me destroying your Outpost, then feel free to withhold my payment.</p><p>The Legate looked angry enough to burst an organ. He eventually grabbed the Storage Bag and flung it in Lu Yes direction.</p><p>After Lu Ye had tied it safely around his waist, he asked, Now, are you going to open your ward, or do I have to do it myself?</p><p>Open the ward! The Legate ordered.</p><p>It wasnt like they could stop him from leaving even if they refused to open the grand ward. And what would that achieve anyway? A morsel of satisfaction for the destruction of their Outpost? Right now, there was nothing more important than sending this sonuvabitch away as soon as possible!</p><p>A gap appeared on the grand ward, and Lu Ye flew right through it. He was gone in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Countless Raving Bladesmen cultivators stared at the sky where Lu Ye had disappeared to and clenched their fists. Their humiliation and anger would not subside until a very long time later.</p><p>In the air, Lu Ye checked his 10-point map briefly before steering his flying Spirit Artifact toward the Myriad Poison Forest.</p><p>He was almost done with the Core Circle, and every sect had paid the price besides the twenty three he had conquered. If he broke his promise now, then, the Thousand Demon Ridge would have reason to attack his comrades.</p><p>It was time to return to the headquarters.</p><p>Speaking of which, he was still the Legate of the Crimson Blood Sect. That was why he needed to pass it to someone qualified before he ascended to the Cloud River Realm.</p><p>The massive amount of Blessings he plundered after conquering the twenty three Outposts also necessitated his return to the headquarters.</p><p>Thirdly, he was literally carrying too many Storage Bags for his own good. That was between fifty to sixty million Contribution Points worth of goods. He wouldnt be able to sleep well until he had safely passed it to Shui Yuans hands.</p><p>Finally, there were still ten days before he received the Heavens reward. He wasnt going to miss it, but he fully expected the Spirit Mist to be even less effective than it was before.</p><p>He had reached the absolute pinnacle of the Spirit Creek Realm and obtained all the profits he should obtain. Once he had done one last thing, there was no need to stay in the Spirit Creek Battlefield any longer.</p><p>The reason he was heading to the Myriad Poison Forest right now was to give Hua Ci some cultivation resources.</p><p>On the way, he suddenly received a message from his second senior, Shui Yuan. she said, Make sure you return to the headquarters before you ascend to the Cloud River Realm!</p><p>Got it.</p><p>Lu Ye didnt know why his second senior sister wanted him to go to the headquarters before ascending, but it didnt matter since he was already planning to do so.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ye landed in front of the wooden building. He did not see Hua Ci anywhere, so she was probably cultivating as usual.</p><p>Instead of seeking her out, he went to the third floor and slept. 𝘭𝑖𝒷𝓇𝘦𝘢𝒹.𝑐𝘰𝘮</p><p>The Spirit Creek Battlefield was massive, but there was only one place in the entire world where he could relax himself completely, and that was this wooden building. Not even the Outpost could achieve the same effect.</p><p>Unfortunately, he couldnt stay here forever.</p><p>He did not know how long he was asleep, but when he woke up to the scent of food and the sound of laughter, the sun was already high up in the sky. He could hear Yi Yi and Hua Ci chatting idly from outside the window.</p><p>Lu Ye got up and walked to the window. He looked down and watched the two women busying themselves and having a great time while preparing lunch.</p><p>For a time, he simply stayed there and watched them in silence. His heart was filled with warmth.</p><p>The warmth would last longer if Hua Ci didnt drop the strangest creatures into a clay pot to make her soup.</p><p>Youre awake, Lu Ye? Yi Yi looked up and greeted him when she saw him.</p><p>Yeah, Lu Ye replied carelessly before withdrawing from the window, Call me when lunch is ready.</p><p>He returned to his bed and assumed a meditative stance. He then took out one of the books he took from the Raving Bladesmen and began reading.</p><p>The Raving Bladesmen was the sect with the highest percentage of blade cultivators in the entire Jiu Zhou. They were also a Tier-One sect. The sect had produced countless blade wielders since forever, so of course they had left behind an innumerable amount of blade technique insights for their disciples.</p><p>(Patreon)&gt;&gt;</p><p>The source of this content is 𝙡𝙞𝙗𝒓𝙚𝓪𝙙.𝒄𝓸𝓶</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
