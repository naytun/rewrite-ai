That was why he was still labeled as Heaven Eight on the Scroll of Supremacy.</p><p>There was no one in the entire Spirit Creek Battlefield besides Hua Ci, Amber and Yi Yi who knew of his ascension.</p><p>The first two times he left the Myriad Poison Forest were like a grand festival. He was swiftly discovered and chased by countless Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators.</p><p>This time though, things were a lot more peaceful. He didnt find anyone until he had traveled at least a hundred kilometers on his Spirit Boat.</p><p>In the Core Circle, most cultivators chose to fly at high altitudes for convenience sake. Generally speaking, there wasnt much danger in doing so. As long as they didnt completely drop their guard, there was always a chance to escape even if they did run into an enemyassuming that the enemy wasnt too fast to shake off, of course.</p><p>The moment Lu Ye saw the three auras in the horizon, he immediately changed directions and sped toward them.</p><p>The trio had clearly seen Lu Ye as well, as they had paused in their tracks.</p><p>Earthly Deity Chapter 28</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>Please enable JavaScript</p><p>Earthly Deity Chapter 28</p><p>Lu Ye did not know who they were, where they came from, or even what their faction was. Naturally, it was the same for the party of three. The only reason they dared to wait for Lu Ye to come to them was because they outnumbered him three to one.</p><p>If Lu Ye was one of their own, then all was well. Even if he wasnt, the numbers advantage was firmly in their grasp.</p><p>When the distance between them had shortened to just three hundred meters or so, one of the trio suddenly stared at Lu Yes face like he was trying to drill a hole in it. He then asked a question that caused his companions hearts to skip a beat in unison, Senior Brother Li. Is it just me, or does that guy look like Lu Yi Ye?</p><p>The cultivator named Senior Brother Li immediately countered, Thats not funny, man. Stop scaring me.</p><p>Suddenly, he recalled that their current location was too far away from the Myriad Poison Forest. There was a chance the young man headed toward them might actually be that bastard, Lu Yi Ye. He immediately trained his eyes on Lu Ye and saw a familiar face and a snow white Spirit Beast lying on his shoulder. Who else could he be except Lu Yi Ye? 𝓁𝒾𝘣𝑟𝑒𝘢𝘥.𝘤𝘰𝑚</p><p>FLY! The cultivator named Li immediately shouted. All three cultivators panicked and attempted to flee to safety.</p><p>Unfortunately, they were too late. Lu Ye had already split his nine flying weapons into three groups and sent them after the cultivators.</p><p>The trio were a pair of Heaven Eight and one Heaven Seven cultivator. How could they possibly survive Lu Yes telekinesis?</p><p>The screams lasted only a moment before blood began raining from the sky. By the time Lu Ye had reached the position they were at a moment ago, all three cultivators had already been killed.</p><p>Lu Ye had become much stronger after he ascended to Heaven Nine. His ability to kill was looking more and more natural and controlled as well.</p><p>Yi Yi flashed out of Amber and grabbed the loot like usual. After she was done, Lu Ye resumed his journey once more.</p><p>Every time he encountered a cultivator, Lu Ye would fly up to them to confirm their affiliation. As a result, every Thousand Demon Ridge cultivator he encountered for the next couple days had been slain without fail.</p><p>Three days later, Lu Ye arrived at his destination and landed outside the Grand Ward of a Thousand Demon Ridge Outpost. The sect was called Mystic Green Palace.</p><p>He then applied Insight to his eyes and began identifying its nodes.</p><p>A cultivator wearing a loose robe with long sleeves responded to the commotion and questioned Lu Ye from behind the Grand Ward, Who are you?</p><p>The second he said this, he realized who he was looking at and blurted in panic, Lu Yi Ye?</p><p>The cultivator had turned as white as a sheet. He never thought that the infamous Lu Yi Ye would one day appear outside his doorstep. It was clear that he wasnt here for tea either.</p><p>He hurriedly channeled his Spiritual Power and shouted, LU YI YE IS HERE!</p><p>As soon as the shout ended, the entire Outpost abruptly bubbled with activity. Countless auras took to the sky and rushed to this side.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lu Ye had already planted his ward flags in the grand ward and poured his Spiritual Power into it. Just a few seconds later, the Spiritual Power in the area enclosed by the ward flags stopped flowing completely.</p><p>Then, like he was passing through a curtain or a tent flap, he lifted a corner of the Grand Ward and stepped inside.</p><p>A couple of Mystic Green Palace cultivators arrived at the scene faster than the others. Many more were on their way. Naturally, they werent just going to allow Lu Yi Ye to waltz into their Outpost without resistance. They immediately launched their attacks at him.</p><p>Lu Ye empowered himself with Windwalk the second he unsheathed the Inviolable. After dodging all the attacks with uncanny speed and unthinkable precision, he ran up to a cultivator and brought down his saber!</p><p>Swish!</p><p>Blood splattered against his face, but Lu Ye didnt even bat an eyelid. He simply ran toward his next victim</p><p>Five corpses lay on the ground just three breaths later. Blood slowly dripped down the Inviolable.</p><p>As more cultivators showed up, one Heaven Nine roared in fury, Lu Yi Ye! You dare!</p><p>Was there anyone in the world who could stand a lone enemy barging into their Outpost and slaughtering their brethren like cattle? Unlikely. Countless eyes turned bloodshot when they caught sight of their fallen brothers and sisters.</p><p>The second the Heaven Nine cultivator finished talking, countless spells and flying weapons rained down on Lu Yes position from above.</p><p>There was a whoosh as a pair of large wings made of fiery red Spiritual Power appeared behind Lu Yes back. He soared into the sky and dodged the bombardment effortlessly.</p><p>He soared over the crowd and trained his gaze on the Heaven Nine cultivator. It only took him two flaps to reach the man.</p><p>Unimaginable pressure and even greater killing intent extinguished the Heaven Nine cultivators fury like a bucket of ice water. The second he saw Lu Ye charging toward him, he plunged to the ground as quickly as he could.</p><p>He might be Heaven Nine, but he wasnt even strong enough to enter the Scroll of Supremacy. Naturally, he felt exactly zero sense of security before the champion. Right now, the only way anyone might kill Lu Ye was to overwhelm him with numbers.</p><p>Unfortunately for him, he had just started descending when Lu Ye appeared right in front of him. [How the fuck is the bastard so quick?]</p><p>Wings was way faster than a flying Spirit Artifact to begin with, not to mention that Soar was an enhanced version of it.</p><p>Windwalk was in play as well. Together, it would not be an exaggeration to say that he was literally as swift as lightning.</p><p>As the Inviolable descended on the Heaven Nine cultivator like a guillotine, he tried to raise his Spirit Artifact to parry the attack. However, their weapons had just made contact when an unimaginable amount of force ripped it right out of his hand and numbed his arm. He himself was sent flying toward the ground uncontrollably.</p><p>When Lu Ye swung his saber a second time, the Heaven Nine cultivator hurriedly thrust his hand into his Storage Bag and pulled out a Golden Body Talisman Paper. Unfortunately, he did not manage to slap the talisman on himself before Lu Ye had separated his head from his torso.</p><p>Cries of shock, grief and anger erupted from below as blood rained from the sky. The man Lu Ye just killed was none other than the Legate of the Mystic Green Palace!</p><p>The Heaven Nine cultivator wasnt just a competent Legate, he was also someone who watched out for his junior brothers and sisters. At least dozens of people were indebted to him in some way. Naturally, his death was a huge blow to all cultivators of the Mystic Green Palace Outpost. 𝓁𝘪𝘣𝘳ℯ𝒶𝘥.𝘤𝑜𝓂</p><p>Lu Ye had no idea that the man he just killed was the Legate, though he had gone after him thinking that that might be the case. After all, Heaven Nine cultivators were fairly uncommon even among Core Circle Sects. In any case, he had chosen to kill the Heaven Nine cultivator because it would remove a valuable fighting power from the enemy and lessen the pressure on his shoulders.</p><p>He was planning to intimidate the enemy with the act as well, although it looked like it had had the opposite effect. Everyone was staring at him with indescribable rage and sorrow.</p><p>Lu Ye allowed himself to fall to the ground after killing the Heaven Nine cultivator. The second he reached ground level, he immediately rushed toward the area with the most number of cultivators.</p><p>All nine of his flying weapons flew out of his Weapon Holder and spun round and round in front of him like a top. Behind the literal storm of blades, Lu Ye was swinging the Inviolable and reaping lives with nearly every swing.</p><p>Blood Curdling screams, shouts of anger, and Ambers roar filled the air. Every time Amber roared, all nearby cultivators would stagger on their feet and give Lu Ye the chance to plow through them like wheats. The charge alone had cost the Mystic Green Palace at least a dozen lives.</p><p>Lu Ye was currently bathed from head to toe in blood. Most of it belonged to his enemy, but some was his own. As he was currently fighting against an entire Outpost, there was no chance he couldve come out without a scratch. Thankfully, Protection was a versatile Glyph that he could manifest on his vital spots at any moment.</p><p>Lu Ye eventually made it back to the edge of the grand ward. His saber was pointed toward the ground, and his eyes squinted slightly in concentration. On the opposite side, the Mystic Green Palace cultivators anger had been replaced by astonishment and disbelief. A heavy silence hung over the Outpost before they knew it.</p><p>In the past, if someone had told them that there existed a cultivator who could single handedly invade an Outpost and massacre the cultivators within like cattle, they would not have believed a word of it. Cultivators they might be, but there was only so much a single person could do, and so strong a single cultivator could become.</p><p>Not even the Three Tumors couldve done such a thing at their peak. The Grand Ward alone wouldve stopped the invasion before it even began.</p><p>But there was no denying the reality in front of them. They were witnessing history being made at the cost of their own lives!</p><p>For a time, the Mystic Green Palace cultivators could only stare at Lu Ye with their jaws on the floor. There was a question that they desperately wanted to ask Lu Ye: Are you even human?</p><p>Lu Ye did not dilly-dally for too long. When he saw that his enemies werent coming to him, he shrugged and rushed them himself.</p><p>Having learned from their earlier experience, the Mystic Green Palace cultivators immediately scattered in every direction to avoid getting caught in his storm of flying weapons. However, they werent able to back away faster than Lu Ye could charge. The young man simply picked a random direction and cut down everyone standing in front of him. He left a literal trail of bodies in his wake.</p><p>Lu Ye would not stop until he had reached the square in front of the Sanctum of Providence. There, nearly seventy cultivators were waiting for him in a solid formation.</p><p>Generally speaking, Core Circle Outposts did not have many cultivators. On average, a Core Circle Outpost only had a hundred or so cultivators. Even those with a larger-than-normal cultivator base did not have more than two hundred cultivators.</p><p>The Mystic Green Palaces Outpost was a standard Core Circle Outpost. It only had a hundred and twenty cultivators or so.</p><p>However, Lu Yi Ye had killed nearly one-third of them in less than a tea time!</p><p>The survivors were all gathered in front of their Sanctum of Providence. The body-tempering cultivators were lined up at the front, the combat cultivators were right behind them, the spell cultivators were further back, and the ghost cultivators were hiding and waiting for a suitable opportunity to stab Lu Yi Ye in the back.</p><p>(Patreon)&gt;&gt;</p><p>This chapter is updated by https://𝘭𝑖𝘣𝓇ℯ𝘢𝒹.𝘤ℴ𝘮</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
