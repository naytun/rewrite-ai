When she was finally done, he immediately asked, What did Fellow Cultivator Lu say, Junior Sister Feng?</p><p>Situ Han let out a sigh of relief after Feng Yue told him everything. It was never a good thing to lose ones Outpost, but Lu Yes promise had dispelled his worries. Worst case scenario, they would evacuate to their headquarters and wait for the danger to pass. It wasnt like they could chase them to Jiu Zhou.</p><p>Once upon a time, there was an Inner Circle sect called the Heavenly Derivative Sect who lost their Outpost to the Thousand Demon Ridge because of Lu Ye. Later, Lu Ye had destroyed all the Thousand Demon Ridge sects within their vicinity and led them on an unprecedented conquest that allowed them to recoup everything they had lost and some more.</p><p>This was why Situ Han did not doubt Lu Yes ability in the slightest.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lu Ye bade Hua Ci goodbye in front of the wooden building before bringing out his flying Spirit Artifact and taking to the sky. As usual, Amber was draped across his shoulder.</p><p>Last time, he had returned to the Myriad Poison Forest fairly quickly because he just wanted to buy some stuff at the Divine Trade Association. This time though, he was planning to stir some trouble. That was why he decided to bring Amber and Yi Yi with him.</p><p>Hua Ci wanted to come with them, but Lu Ye needed someone to watch over the Central Ward at the courtyard, so that was that.</p><p>A massive number of Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators were currently surrounding the Three Sages School in an attempt to force him out. Naturally, he wasnt stupid enough to oblige their wishes and walk into their death trap.</p><p>Logically speaking, the Thousand Demon Ridge should leave the Three Sages School as soon as he revealed himself. Of course, there was a chance they might decide to occupy the Outpost anyway since they were already there. This wasnt something he could change.</p><p>In the air, Lu Ye took out his 10-point map and checked his surroundings for a bit. A while later, he selected the Thousand Demon Ridge Outpost over one hundred and fifty kilometers away from the Myriad Poison Forest as his target.</p><p>The Outpost belonged to a Tier-Three Sect called the Meandering Mountain Clan. He rushed over as soon as he identified the direction.</p><p>Both his physique and his mind were stronger after receiving the reward of the Heavens. His telekinesis speed had improved as well.</p><p>About forty minutes later, Lu Ye arrived at his destination and descended right outside the Outposts Grand Ward. A sentry immediately noticed his presence and greeted Lu Ye cordially, Hail, fellow cultivator. May I know your name?</p><p>Normally, only a friend of the sect would show up without prior notice. The sentry would let them in after a quick check.</p><p>That was why this cultivator did not suspect that Lu Ye was an enemy. After all, what cultivator would be crazy enough to show up at an enemy sects doorsteps alone?</p><p>Lu Ye was inspecting the nodes of the Grand Ward with Insight when he heard the question. He turned toward the cultivator and asked expressionlessly, Who do you think I look like?</p><p>Caught off guard by the unexpected question, the cultivator examined Lu Yes face for a second before blanching. He then pointed a finger at Lu Ye and stuttered, You youre ùò≠ùëñùí∑ùìáùò¶ùò¢ùíπ.ùëêùò∞ùòÆ</p><p>He then channeled his Spiritual Power and shouted on top of his lungs, LU YI YE IS HERE!</p><p>In that instant, the entire Outpost stirred like a kicked hornets nest. Countless auras began flying over even as they wondered if they were hearing things, or if the cultivator who shouted the warning was mistaken.</p><p>Lu Yi Ye had gone underground for a while now. For what reason would he suddenly come to their Outpost?</p><p>By now, Lu Ye had taken out his ward flags and planted them into the Grand Ward. A bit of finessing later, the Spiritual Power within the marked area came to an abrupt stop. Finally, he opened a corner of the Grand Ward like he was opening a tent flap and walked in.</p><p>He had used the exact same method against the Devoted Ones when he was visiting their Outpost with Ju Jia and Feng Yue. If even a Tier-Two Sects Grand Ward could not stop Lu Ye, of course the Meandering Mountain Clan could only do worse.</p><p>That said, he wasnt trying to bring down the entire ward or even damage it in any way. Therefore, this tactic could only be used by a single person or a small group of people.</p><p>By now, dozens of cultivators were surrounding him, and more were coming from every direction. Lu Ye had just walked into the Outpost when a barrage of attacks flew toward him.</p><p>Lu Ye was prepared for this, of course. He immediately activated Protection to shield before dashing to the side with Windwalk.</p><p>Despite his preparation, the Glyph shattered almost immediately after he constructed it. This would happen another five times before he finally managed to escape to a corner where the enemy could not quite focus him down.</p><p>His Weapon Holder vibrated as nine flying weapons shot into the open. Blood curdling screams immediately broke out all around him.</p><p>A Tier-Three Sects Outpost was mostly made up of Heaven Seven and Heaven Eight cultivators. Not only that, their handful of Heaven Nine cultivators werent strong enough to enter the Scroll of Supremacy. Naturally, they were no match for Lu Ye.</p><p>That said, the Meandering Mountain Clan had responded to the threat very quickly. Just ten breaths later, every cultivator in the Outpost was on the move.</p><p>For a time, the sky was filled with hundreds and hundreds of auras. It was quite the spectacle if nothing else.</p><p>Although Lu Ye had entered the Outpost alone, he knew from the start that his chances of occupying an Outpost by himself were zero. The reason he did this was to cause a big enough commotion to draw the Thousand Demon Ridges attention.</p><p>More and more Meandering Mountain Clan cultivators fell to Lu Ye, but the combat cultivator was being worn down at a steady rate himself. What he was doing was impressive, but every second he still breathed was a second he might not have. The smallest mistake could see him dead.</p><p>Protection was not a powerful Glyph, but quantity itself was a form of quality. Moreover, Lu Ye didnt get many opportunities to attack the enemy.</p><p>As time passed, the Meandering Mountain Clan gradually calmed down and discovered that the infamous monster wasnt invincible after all.</p><p>Alone, none of them was a match for Lu Yi Ye even if they fought to the last man. But together, they might not be able to kill him, but he certainly wasnt going to escape unscathed.</p><p>After the Legate and the prolegate of the Meandering Mountain Clan had collected themselves, their defense suddenly became much more solid. Not only that, they were actively trying to hinder and kill Lu Ye.</p><p>As a result, Lu Ye was forced to leave the Outpost less than half a tea time later.</p><p>The battle had ended with the death of twenty to thirty cultivators for the Meandering Mountain Clan, and a full body of injuries for Lu Ye.</p><p>Lu Ye did not leave, however. In fact, he stood right outside of their Grand Ward and stared at them while swallowing his Spirit Pills from time to time. ùíçùíäùíÉùìªùíÜùì™ùôô.ùíÑùô§ùíé</p><p>The Meandering Mountain Clan did not dare to open their Grand Ward and chase him away. Inside the Outpost, Lu Ye had very little room to maneuver. But outside the Outpost where the sky was the limit, the combat cultivator could go all out against them.</p><p>Neither the Legate nor the prolegate were dumb enough to fight Lu Ye in his element.</p><p>However, their cultivators were beyond angry and frustrated that a single man could trap them within their Outpost. So, they jabbed fingers and yelled obscenities at him from the other side of the Grand Ward.</p><p>Lu Ye did not respond no matter how ugly the curses were.</p><p>Only a kid would argue with their mouth.</p><p>Meanwhile, the news that Lu Yi Ye of the Crimson Blood Sect had infiltrated a Thousand Demon Ridge Outpost and wreaked havoc swiftly spread throughout the Spirit Creek Battlefield. All nearby Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators began moving to rescue their ally.</p><p>Although Shi Guang had ascended to the Cloud River Realm, the Yi Ye Elimination Front was still present. It was precisely because it was a loose organization established purely to kill Lu Yi Ye that Shi Guangs presence, while sorely missed, did not affect the organization too much. For as long as the desire to kill Lu Yi Ye existed, so would the organization.</p><p>More and more cultivators were converging upon the Meandering Mountain Clan. The Spirit Creek Battlefield that was silent for half a month finally became lively once more.</p><p>Lu Ye left after standing outside the Outpost for two hours.</p><p>Since he had achieved his objective, there was no longer any need to stay.</p><p>As he left, it so happened that he ran into a squad of Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators who were coming to the Meandering Mountain Clans rescue. At Lu Yes current strength, any group that was smaller than twenty or even thirty people was no match for him. After all, this was not the challenge battle of the Scroll of Supremacy. There, the challenger must deal with all sorts of limitations and geographical disadvantages. But here in the outdoors, victory was decided by the depth of their foundation and their tricks.</p><p>And Lu Ye wasnt lacking in either department.</p><p>Lu Ye charged his enemies without even bothering to maneuver out of harms way. Only a handful of Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators managed to cross paths with him and live.</p><p>Lu Ye did not have a specific destination in mind. He was simply traveling in a straight line and killing everyone in his way.</p><p>If the Thousand Demon Ridge wanted him to show himself so badly, then he would oblige them. He only hoped that they could bear the consequences.</p><p>After suffering many losses, many Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators decided to retreat. However, even more people were moving in to intercept him as his location was being shared among his pursuers in real time.</p><p>Lu Ye was very glad that he had brought Yi Yi and Amber with him. Otherwise, he would have no time to rest at all.</p><p>He hadnt stopped flying since he left the Meandering Mountain Clans Outpost. No matter where he went, Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators would swoop in to try to kill him.</p><p>It was only thanks to Yi Yi and Amber sharing some of the burden that he was able to hang on.</p><p>The Thousand Demon Ridges plan was very clear. They were going to slow him down and wear him out with sheer numbers. No matter how strong Lu Yi Ye was, he was still human. Once he was exhausted, he would fall like any other.</p><p>It wasnt a smart plan, but it was certainly the most effective plan against Lu Ye.</p><p>Lu Ye almost never ran out of Spiritual Power thanks to the Tree of Glyphs and Gluttonous Feast, but he could not say the same for his mind and stamina. It was only a matter of time before either one of them gave out.</p><p>That was why Lu Ye began making his way toward Myriad Poison Forest when he was approaching his limit. Right now in the Core Circle, the Myriad Poison Forest was his one and only refuge. Nowhere else was safe for him.</p><p>As long as he could get within fifty kilometers of the Myriad Poison Forest, he would be able to teleport back to the wooden building.</p><p>Once he was done recovering, he could come out and repeat this all over again.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt a stirring in his Battlefield Imprint. It was a message from Feng Yue.</p><p>Fifth senior brother, the Three Sages Schools Outpost is about to fall. I will be evacuating to Jiu Zhou with Senior Brother Situ and the others. Take care, fifth senior brother!</p><p>Lu Ye was silent when he saw the message. In the end, he wasnt able to save the Three Sages Schools Outpost.</p><p>It was the expected outcome. The Thousand Demon Ridge had gathered enough cultivators to defeat the Three Sages Schools Outpost. Why would they leave empty-handed?</p><p>Lu Ye attempted to respond to Feng Yues message, but he quickly discovered that his response could not be sent. Feng Yue had already teleported back to Jiu Zhou.</p><p>If the Three Sages School could not save their Outpost, what about the Devoted Ones?</p><p>He reckoned that the Devoted Ones would not escape their fate either. In the past, no one dared to challenge them because they had fourth senior brother and Senior Sister Feng to protect them. But now? This generation of Devoted Ones was nothing impressive, so he did not think they would be able to defend their Outpost.</p><p>(Patreon)&gt;&gt;</p><p>New novel chapters are published on ùíçùì≤ùì´ùíìùíÜùíÇùíÖ.ùôòùô§ùíé</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
