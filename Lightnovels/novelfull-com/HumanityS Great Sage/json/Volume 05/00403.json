Naturally, he would not want his enemy to be able to distance themselves from him or hide behind obstacles.</p><p>That was why Lu Ye had encountered all kinds of terrains until now.</p><p>In the wooden building, Lu Ye connected his mind to the Scroll of Supremacy and issued a challenge request to the female cultivator.</p><p>His opponent accepted the challenge request, but the battle did not begin immediately. He waited for two whole hours before the Heavens finally enveloped him in their mysterious power and teleported him into the battlefield.</p><p>Lu Ye immediately scanned his surroundings as his vision gradually recovered. He discovered that the terrain was exactly what his friends had said it would be.</p><p>The large battlefield was made up of two mountains that were over a thousand meters tall. The mountains were completely bald and covered in craggy outcrops. The good news was that the slopes werent particularly steep. The bad news was</p><p>Lu Ye took out his flying Spirit Artifact and tried to fly. The result was exactly as he had heard: this battlefield was under an Aerial Lock effect!</p><p>Lu Ye knew then that his opponent had chosen a terrain that was overwhelmingly in her favor just like the spell cultivator from before.</p><p>A battlefield that was under an Aerial Lock effect meant that it was way, way harder to find the enemy. Lu Ye looked at the two mountains to his left and right and wondered which one she would choose as her high ground. He did not want to waste his energy climbing the wrong mountain, so he simply stayed where he was and waited for Yi Yi to search for the enemy.</p><p>A while later, Yi Yi messaged him to inform him of the enemys location. He immediately started running toward the mountain to his right. He moved so fast that he left afterimages in his trail.</p><p>However, he hadnt even climbed three hundred meters up the mountain when he heard a whistling noise. As he dodged, he felt a gust of wind brushing past his face and leaving behind a stinging pain.</p><p>He looked up. A tall, slender woman with a ponytail was standing at the mountaintop. She wore a tight white dress with purple fringes that outlined her curvaceous body. She was holding a bow and looking down on him without an expression.</p><p>His opponent this time was an archer cultivator!</p><p>Archer cultivators were an incredibly niche faction, but sometimes their rarity played to their advantage. This was because most cultivators lacked the knowledge and experience necessary to deal with them.</p><p>Not only was flying forbidden in this battlefield, his opponent had claimed the high ground before him. This was obviously a terrible start for Lu Ye.</p><p>If he wished to defeat his opponent, then he would have to get close enough to attack her with his flying weapons at the very least. However, he would have to weather an endless hail of arrows to get there.</p><p>The straight-line distance between Lu Ye and his opponent was about eight hundred meters, which didnt seem like a lot for a cultivator. In reality, Lu Ye had to cover at least 1.6 kilometers of ground to get to the archer cultivator.</p><p>The female cultivator surpassed her mortal counterpart not just in terms of strength, but also equipment. For starters, her arrows could be imbued with all kinds of special effects. The female cultivators aim was incredibly good as well. It should be easy for a cultivator to dodge a shot coming from at least eight hundred meters away, but it had still nearly hit him. Sure, she had the high ground advantage, but it did not diminish her skill in any way.</p><p>As if that wasnt bad enough, he could tell that the shot was just a greeting.</p><p>This was very much like his fight against the spell cultivator. The only way to deal with these long-range bastards was to get close enough to attack!</p><p>Lu Ye inhaled slightly and exchanged a glance with his opponent. Then, he crouched a little, imbued himself with Windwalk, pushed off hard enough to leave two small dents on the ground, and dashed forward like the wind!</p><p>At almost the same time, the female archer shot three arrows that flew toward him from three different angles. Not only did they greatly restrict his available space, his skin prickled before they even got close. It was clear that the arrows were not common, and combined with her unusual talent and skill their penetration and killing power could only be described as terrifying.</p><p>Lu Ye leaped into the air to dodge the three arrows, but a fourth arrow appeared out of nowhere before he could land on the ground. He never even saw her shooting the fourth arrow!</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ye realized that it was a four-shot combo. The first three arrows were meant to draw the enemys attention and force them to maneuver in a certain way. The fourth shot was the true killing blow!</p><p>There was no way he could dodge the shot while in mid-air, so he unsheathed the Inviolable and slashed the arrow.</p><p>Boom! There was an explosion of Spiritual Power as Lu Ye was blown back. He had just caught himself when a couple more arrows flew toward him.</p><p>The enemys attack was continuous and never-ending. She seemed capable of predicting his next move. Even if he managed to dodge one attack, the next would stop him in his tracks without fail.</p><p>On a mountain, a man ran like the wind while a woman fired a ceaseless stream of arrows at him.</p><p>Lu Ye had to admit that the female archer was one of the most powerful opponents he had ever seen in his life. The Grand Sky Coalition was lucky that large-scale battles did not happen anymore, or this woman could single handedly turn losing battles into stalemates, and stalemates into crushing victories with her archery. Almost no one she targeted in the chaos of the battlefield could live, not to mention that her attack range was even greater than a spell cultivators!</p><p>Lu Ye continued to climb up the mountain. Sometimes, he was forced to jump to the back to avoid a killing blow. Sometimes, he had to roll all over the place like he was a circus animal, dignity be damned.</p><p>In reality, he was quickly gaining ground on the female archer. In just half a tea time, the distance between them had been shortened by half.</p><p>However, the female archers archery was growing deadlier and deadlier as well. At eight hundred meters away, the shots were fairly easy to deal with, especially with his speed. But the closer he got, the livelier and more unpredictable her archery became. She could even control the trajectory of her arrows to a certain extent.</p><p>Yi Yi was still hiding in the dark because Lu Ye was still nowhere close enough to attack the woman. If she attacked now, the likelihood that she would fail was incredibly high.</p><p>She would attack only when Lu Ye was close enough to attack the enemy as well. Only then could they guarantee a kill.</p><p>The female archers attack abruptly became much more powerful when he got within the four hundred-meter range, which slowed down his progress considerably. The arrows rained from the sky like a meteor shower, and the bow twangs sounded like they would never end. There wasnt any interval between the shots whatsoever.</p><p>Lu Ye felt like he was charging an entire encampment on his own. Rocks flew everywhere, and his lungs were filled with dust as he kept dodging or blocking the shots. There wasnt a patch of ground behind his back that wasnt filled with large pits, and his entire body was covered in soot. Appearance wise, he did not think he had ever looked so terrible in his life.</p><p>Suddenly, the ceaseless attacks came to a stop. When Lu Ye looked up in confusion, he saw the female archer watching him with a calm expression. Her bowstring was dripping with blood, and her bow hand had been stripped off so much flesh that it was practically a skeletal hand. Her face was white and covered in sweat as well.</p><p>As it turned out, firing so many powerful shots in an incense stick was a little too much even for an archer who dedicated her life to this fighting style. However, Lu Ye did not think that her injuries were enough to make her stop. He suspected that the real reason she stopped attacking him was because she had run out of arrows!</p><p>The female archer must have shot at least eight hundred arrows at Lu Ye during this time, if not a thousand. Lu Ye was able to dodge most of it and block the rest with the Inviolable.</p><p>Lu Ye stopped his advance there. He simply watched the female archer in silence.</p><p>He felt a disturbance from his Battlefield Imprint. It was probably Yi Yi messaging him and asking if she should attack the female archer now.</p><p>Lu Ye slowly shook his head.</p><p>Youre strong. Shi Guang is no match for you!</p><p>The female archer said this before looking at the sky and announcing, I surrender! 𝒍𝙞𝙗𝒓𝒆𝙖𝓭.𝙘𝒐𝒎</p><p>The Heavens enveloped her in their mysterious power and teleported her away from the battlefield.</p><p>As Lu Ye had guessed, the female archer had run out of arrows. Although she was incredibly powerful, she was highly reliant on her equipment to unleash her full strength.</p><p>Simply put, an archer with no arrows might as well be a sitting duck.</p><p>In fact, the reason she had made Lu Ye wait two whole hours before entering the battlefield was to prepare her arrows.</p><p>The battle against Lu Ye had cost her an ungodly amount of wealth. Even if her arrows cost only a Contribution Point a piece, that was hundreds of Contribution Points she had thrown away for a lost battle. And they did not cost just a Contribution Point. Each and every arrow had to be forged by an artificer to make them strong enough to withstand her strength and imbue them with special effects. 𝓁𝑖𝒷𝑟𝘦𝒶𝑑.𝒸𝘰𝘮</p><p>Lu Ye did not sheathe his saber until the female archer was completely gone. He was silent for a couple of seconds before he allowed the Heavens to teleport him back to the wooden building.</p><p>Oh, the great second runner-up of the Scroll of Supremacy has returned to us! Congrats, congrats.</p><p>Hua Cis teasing voice came from the side. The medicine cultivator had just returned from her cultivation.</p><p>Lu Ye ignored her and messaged Yu Lianzhou to ask about Shi Guang.</p><p>Wow, the silent treatment? Was he bullied during the fight? Hua Ci exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>Yi Yi walked up to the medicine cultivator and whispered into her ears. After she found out what happened, she covered her mouth and giggled. Who cares about the process so long as it ends with your victory?</p><p>Lu Ye understood this as well as she did, but really</p><p>What the FUCK was wrong with the top ten rankers of the Scroll of Supremacy?</p><p>He hadnt had a proper fight since he started challenging them.</p><p>Gui Yingzi had wasted two days of his time before surrendering without ever revealing himself.</p><p>The spell cultivator had chosen a pair of islands as his terrain and surrendered the second Lu Ye crossed the sea and reached him.</p><p>This fight was even worse. It was bad enough the battle was over before he got within three hundred meters of his opponent, he was the defender from the start to the end.</p><p>It was true that all the battles had ended with his victory, but he couldnt derive even an ounce of happiness from them at all.</p><p>It was at this moment Yu Lianzhou responded, Shi Guang is a combat cultivator, and his Spirit Artifact is a spear!</p><p>Lu Ye let out a long, long breath. Finally, he could have a proper fight.</p><p>Lu Ye immediately issued Shi Guang a challenge request. Although he wasnt at peak form right now, he was frustrated enough to give himself an aneurysm if he delayed the fight any longer. He could not wait to clash against a PROPER opponent and vent it all as soon as possible.</p><p>The good news was that Shi Guang did not keep him waiting for long. A tea time after issuing the challenge, the Heavens teleported him to a battlefield about three hundred meters in radius. Both men appeared and saw each other at the same time.</p><p>First things first, Lu Ye examined his surroundings. He decided that it was a suitable battleground even though he personally wouldve chosen a smaller battlefield.</p><p>Lu Yi Ye! Shi Guang pointed his spear at him and yelled, Come forth and die!</p><p>(Patreon)&gt;&gt;</p><p>This chapter is updated by 𝑙𝑖𝑏𝓇𝘦𝑎𝒹.𝑐𝑜𝓂</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
