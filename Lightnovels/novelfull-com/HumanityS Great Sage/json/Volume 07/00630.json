One couldn‚Äôt see anything else when shrouded in the miasma. It was an extremely dark color that seemed able to devour all the light.</p><p>All of them thought Lu Ye had cast a lethal Spirit Artifact at them, so they were surprised when it turned out to be poisonous smoke.</p><p>The unsuspecting cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge were instantly covered in the miasma.</p><p>The next moment, someone exclaimed, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs poison!‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúHold your breath!‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúTake some Antidote Pills immediately!‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúDang it! I‚Äôll tear you into pieces, Lu Yi Ye!‚Äù</p><p>‚Ä¶</p><p>The cultivators who hadn‚Äôt been affected by the miasma were horrified as they retreated to stay away from the poisonous smoke. Those that had been affected quickly activated their Spiritual Powers to protect themselves and held their breaths at the same time. They also immediately fished out some Antidote Pills from their Storage Bags and consumed them.</p><p>In this chaotic situation, another Omnipoison Pill emerged from the miasma and hovered above these cultivators. The pill had exploded before they could stop it.</p><p>A dark poisonous cloud expanded and shrouded a large number of cultivators.</p><p>Then, in another direction, the third Omnipoison Pill detonated.</p><p>When Lu Ye returned to Spirit Creek Battlefield to visit Hua Ci previously, he only took three Omnipoison Pills from her. This time, he had used them up at once, causing all the cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge to be covered in the poisonous cloud. As their Spiritual Powers fluctuated, the dark cloud spread across the entire mine.</p><p>Soon, people were heard coughing in the thick green fog, followed by shrieks and difficulty in breathing.</p><p>These cultivators were horrified to learn that even though they had activated their Spiritual Power Shields, they still couldn‚Äôt fend off the poisonous fog. Although they had held their breaths, the omnipresent fog seemed able to sneak into their bodies through their pores.</p><p>In just ten breaths of time, all of them started reacting differently to the poison.</p><p>Some only felt numb while some felt extremely itchy. There were also some people who felt dizzy, causing them to stagger as an unusual tone of green appeared on their faces.</p><p>Without exception, all of them felt their Spiritual Powers becoming sluggish, and their Rivers of Spiritual Power started flowing more slowly. These symptoms became even more conspicuous as time passed.</p><p>Just then, some dull thuds were heard coming from different directions. Apparently, some weaker cultivators were unable to hold on any longer as they collapsed to the ground.</p><p>Those who could still persevere were running around. However, the poisonous fog had covered most of the mine, and even Lu Ye‚Äôs location seemed susceptible to the poison. As such, where were they supposed to go to keep themselves safe?</p><p>They could‚Äôve fled the mine through the passageway, but it had been destroyed earlier on. As such, this place had become a sealed space.</p><p>Growls and curses sounded. Some people exclaimed when others stepped on them.</p><p>The entire place had descended into turmoil.</p><p>Somewhere in the crowd, Song Zhui could feel himself weakening rapidly as his eyelids twitched.</p><p>He was a Ninth-Order Master who came from a Tier-One Sect, but he still couldn‚Äôt ward off the poisonous fog, let alone the others.</p><p>Not long ago, he still held on to the belief that Lu Ye was doomed unless he had set up a Teleportation Ward in advance, but in the blink of an eye, everything went downhill for them. ùêë√¢Œù’ïÍûñƒö·π°</p><p>Lu Ye didn‚Äôt have the intention of fleeing. He stayed there to lure them into the mine. His intention was to eliminate all 2,000 cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge on his own.</p><p>There was no doubt he was recklessly brave.</p><p>It was a goal that supposedly couldn‚Äôt be realized, but as everything unfolded according to his plan, this seemingly impossible task showed some hope of getting achieved.</p><p>At this point, it dawned on Song Zhui that it was all Lu Ye‚Äôs plan.</p><p>His whereabouts were indeed exposed, but it wasn‚Äôt an accident. He had done so intentionally to lure them to this place.</p><p>His injury must be a form of pretense as well. At the very least, Song Zhui couldn‚Äôt see any symptoms of Lu Ye being injured as his aura was stable.</p><p>He had built many Explosive Wards in the passageway, but his main goal wasn‚Äôt to stop these cultivators from moving further inside; it was to weaken the walls around the passageway so that he could get it destroyed later.</p><p>When all the cultivators entered the mine, his secret helper made a move and caused the passageway to collapse, entrapping everyone in the mine.</p><p>In such a sealed environment, the effects of the poisonous fog had undoubtedly been maximized.</p><p>Song Zhui had some doubts previously. For example, why was Lu Ye injured, and who hurt him?</p><p>Why had no one discovered him when he had been hiding in the depths of Grand Wilds Peak for a few days, but his whereabouts were exposed when he was in the periphery?</p><p>Even though they had found him, he shouldn‚Äôt have chosen such a place to hide where there was only one exit.</p><p>Despite all the doubts, he dismissed them with some possibilities he came up with.</p><p>Moreover, no one could‚Äôve expected a Fifth-Order Cloud River Realm Master to be so bold. When everyone from Thousand Demon Ridge was hunting him down, he had set up a trap instead of trying his best to hide. He even lured so many of them to enter the mine all at once.</p><p>Wasn‚Äôt he worried that he would mess up?</p><p>Nonetheless, it was pointless for Song Zhui to ponder such matters at this moment.</p><p>In such a sealed space, the power of the poisonous fog was taking effect. Song Zhui could feel his power declining quickly. Although he had immediately consumed some Antidote Pills, their effects were limited. They had to leave the mine as soon as possible. Otherwise, all 2,000 of them would lose their lives here.</p><p>At the thought of the worst possible outcome, Song Zhui shuddered.</p><p>Around 2,000 people getting eliminated when both parties were in the same Realm was unprecedented in the history of the cultivation world in Jiu Zhou. It was simply not a thing one would expect to happen.</p><p>Song Zhui had heard that Lu Ye had directly and indirectly killed several thousand cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge on the Spirit Creek Battlefield. However, he didn‚Äôt witness it, and the number of casualties meant nothing to him.</p><p>Nevertheless, when he witnessed so many lives getting destroyed right before his eyes, he couldn‚Äôt remain unperturbed even though he had killed many people himself.</p><p>He activated his Spiritual Power and bellowed, ‚ÄúStop panicking! To those who are Third Order and below, quickly clean up the passageway now, and to those who are above the Third Order, destroy the wards and kill Lu Yi Ye!‚Äù</p><p>It had to be said that Song Zhui was indeed an experienced man who was able to make some quick arrangements under such a circumstance, and his arrangements were undoubtedly impeccable.</p><p>As long as they could swiftly clean up the passageway, they would have a way out. Regardless of how potent the poison was, there would be a way to dispel it so long as they survived.</p><p>While clearing the mess in the passageway, they also had to get to the source of the problem by killing Lu Ye. Even though doing so wouldn‚Äôt get them any antidote, they could ensure no one could threaten them in such an environment at the very least.</p><p>In the sealed space, Lu Ye was their only enemy.</p><p>During a tumultuous time like this, it required someone like Song Zhui to take charge of the situation.</p><p>Following his order, the flustered cultivators quickly pulled themselves together and started taking action.</p><p>Lights of different colors flickered again as the cultivators resumed what they were doing. They pressed on while breaking the wards in front of them.</p><p>Cultivators who were Third Order and below turned around and charged toward the passageway, ready to clear up the rocks. However, many of them staggered and collapsed to the ground.</p><p>They were not dead, but all their energy seemed to have left their bodies. Their Rivers of Spiritual Power almost stopped flowing, so they were unable to activate their powers.</p><p>In that case, they were merely beings who were slightly stronger than the commoners.</p><p>In the end, only around ten people managed to enter the passageway, but even they were not sure they could hold on for how long.</p><p>*Boom! Boom! Boom!* Violent sounds were continuously heard, and the fluctuations of Spiritual Powers were a mess.</p><p>At this point, the entire mine was filled with poisonous fog. Even Lu Ye‚Äôs location wasn‚Äôt spared.</p><p>He was still standing there with a saber, unperturbed by the cultivators who were marching toward him. Not only was he calm and collected, but he also had time to look into his soul and check on the Tree of Glyphs‚Äô reaction.</p><p>Soon, he discovered that the power of the Omnipoison Pills he had cast this time was greater than that from the previous time. That was because the Tree of Glyphs was reacting even more violently this time, which went to show that the Omnipoison Pills were even more potent.</p><p>The discovery surprised him.</p><p>Prior to this, he had only used the Omnipoison Pills once in the Myriad Beast Domain to go against the Sect Master of Black Tortoise Sect, Niu Meng, who had transformed into a Beast Form.</p><p>At that time, the situation was indeed desperate. Even though there were several Ninth-Order Cloud River Realm Masters on their side, they were powerless against Niu Meng, who was in a Beast Form and had even become the core of the insectoid nest.</p><p>After taking off his pretense as a Spell Cultivator, Pang Da Hai, who was actually a Body-tempering Cultivator, was almost killed by Niu Meng. Even a Sword Cultivator like Zhou Hai, who was known to be ruthless, failed to cause any serious damage to Niu Meng.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ye had no choice but to use the Omnipoison Pills to harm both his friends and foes. Only then did he manage to weaken Niu Meng. Then, he and Zhou Hai found a chance and broke his Beast Form Secret Technique.</p><p>At that time, using the Omnipoison Pills was undoubtedly the last resort. After all, even though Lu Ye was immune to poison, the others were not.</p><p>It also didn‚Äôt help that Niu Meng in a Beast Form was formidable. After witnessing Berserk Giant Ape‚Äôs power, Lu Ye felt that Niu Meng in a Beast Form had almost reached the elite level.</p><p>Despite that, his power was still weakened by the Omnipoison Pills.</p><p>Even an elite-level being was unable to fend off the Omnipoison Pills, let alone these cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge who had barged into the mine.</p><p>Furthermore, the Omnipoison Pills he used this time were more potent than the previous ones.</p><p>Unbeknownst to Lu Ye, the Omnipoison Pills were the condensation of Hua Ci‚Äôs power. Not only could they be used against the enemies, but they could also serve as Hua Ci‚Äôs reserve power.</p><p>In other words, when she ascended to the Cloud River Realm in the future, she could consume the Omnipoison Pills she had made to strengthen her power.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
