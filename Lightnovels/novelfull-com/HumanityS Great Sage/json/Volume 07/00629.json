Near the entrance, the cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge formed into an arc as they continuously made a move and inched forward.</p><p>The Spiritual Powers were a mess in the spacious mine.</p><p>Song Zhui stopped making a move, for there was no longer such a need, considering the number of people inside the mine.</p><p>He had been observing Lu Ye’s reaction. What puzzled him was that despite being in a desperate situation, Lu Ye remained calm and collected.</p><p>His chest tightened when he saw that. [Has Lu Yi Ye already built a Teleportation Ward? Otherwise, why is he so composed? Or, has he given up on resisting, knowing that he can’t run away? However, if he had set up a Teleportation Ward, he would’ve fled instead of taking a risk by staying here.]</p><p>He estimated the efficiency of these cultivators and reckoned that it would only take them several minutes to move across 150 meters. Given the distance by then, they could destroy Lu Yi by launching some long-distance attacks. Even though he had a Defensive Ward, he couldn’t stay safe forever.</p><p>As many thoughts ran through Song Zhui’s mind, Lu Ye, who had been unmoving the entire time, suddenly rose to his feet and looked at Song Zhui while holding his saber.</p><p>As their eyes met, Song Zhui noticed a faint smile on the man’s face. Following that, a calm voice was heard saying, “I’m glad many of you are here!”</p><p>Song Zhui frowned and questioned, “What trick are you trying to pull again, Lu Yi Ye?”</p><p>He had been fooled by Lu Ye in the Ameloriate Valley back then, so he had been resentful. As such, he couldn’t help but wonder what Lu Ye was up to when the man suddenly said such a thing.</p><p>Considering the current situation, there was no way Lu Ye could flee unless he had set up a Teleportation Ward in advance.</p><p>Nonetheless, it didn’t look like he was ready to run away.</p><p>“Well, what trick can I pull when there are so many of you while I’m all by myself?” Lu Ye replied matter-of-factly.</p><p>Someone growled, “Lu Yi Ye, if you don’t want to suffer, you’d better end your own life. Otherwise, when we get to you, it will be difficult for you to seek your end.”</p><p>“Well, who can foresee which one of us will live?”</p><p>The person guffawed. “Do you seriously think you have a chance to flee?”</p><p>The rest of the cultivators laughed.</p><p>“It’s none of your concern whether I’ll be able to run away. However, I’m afraid none of you will live to see the next sunrise.”</p><p>The cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge jeered at his blind confidence. At that moment, the atmosphere in the mine was rather cheerful.</p><p>Someone laughed so hard that he covered his abdomen and pointed at Lu Ye. “I’m dying. I’ve always heard that Lu Yi Ye is an incredible cultivator, but it turns out that he’s only good at bluffing.”</p><p>“You’re so impertinent!” another person growled. “Let’s see how you’re going to make sure we won’t live to see the next sunrise!”</p><p>As though responding to this person, the violent fluctuations of Spiritual Power were suddenly felt coming from the passageway behind them, and it was followed by a loud buzz.</p><p>The turn of events astounded the cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge. When they turned around to look, their expressions changed drastically. For some reason, the passageway had collapsed, and large rocks had fallen and sealed off the entrance.</p><p>The fluctuations of Spiritual Power continued. Someone seemed to be making a move in the passageway, and as that happened, more and more parts of the passageway collapsed until the noise faded.</p><p>Presently, Yi Yi was casting her attacks in the passageway. The powerful spells struck the fragile walls, causing them to come apart as the rocks fell and blocked the passageway.</p><p>Given her cultivation, it would have been difficult for her if she wanted to destroy a perfectly fine passageway.</p><p>However, the passageway had been damaged by the Explosive Wards Lu Ye had set up, so the walls were already fragile. Some of the parts had even collapsed.</p><p>Considering the damage that had been done, Yi Yi could easily destroy the entire passageway.</p><p>Now, all the cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge had entered the mine, so no one was in the passageway. Moreover, their attention was on Lu Ye. As such, no one noticed her presence when she appeared in the passageway earlier on.</p><p>It wasn’t until she started destroying the passageway that the cultivators were alerted, but it was too late for them to stop her.</p><p>The moment the passageway started falling apart, all the cultivators stopped making a move. Ning Zizai approached the entrance and looked into the situation. He could see that the passageway had been tightly sealed off, and the sound of things collapsing was so far away that there was probably a distance of around a kilometer.</p><p>Given the magnitude of the collapse, they couldn’t solve the problem in a short time. Despite the large number of cultivators in the mine, it would take them half a day to clear the passageway.</p><p>Fortunately, the passageway’s collapse did nothing to affect the inside of the mine. Yet, the tremor had caused many rocks to fall.</p><p>Certainly, the people outside could hear the noise as well.</p><p>Senior Brother Qin and the others had been waiting outside after accepting Gui Yingzi’s advice. When they noticed the anomaly, they looked up and saw the mountain shaking violently.</p><p>“What’s going on?” Senior Sister Hu asked.</p><p>Senior Brother Qin frowned. “I suppose there’s a collapse inside.”</p><p>“Why would that happen out of nowhere?” Senior Sister Hu was puzzled.</p><p>“Perhaps it’s caused by the repercussions of battle inside.” The moment Senior Brother Qin finished speaking, he felt something was off. Lu Ye was on his own while there were around 2,000 cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge. Therefore, the battle couldn’t possibly be so intense. The cultivators could supposedly kill Lu Ye in a short time after they found him.</p><p>During their conversation, a gale suddenly gushed out of the entrance, bringing motes of dust with it.</p><p>“The inside has indeed collapsed.” Senior Sister Hu was terrified. Even Cloud River Realm Masters couldn’t ignore such a large-scale collapse. Once they were buried alive, there wasn’t a chance for them to survive.</p><p>She wondered if any of them had been affected.</p><p>“Is this the danger you’ve sensed, Junior Brother?” Senior Sister Hu turned to look at Gui Yingzi. It had to be said that the Junior Brother was incredible at detecting danger. If he hadn’t dissuaded them from entering, they would have experienced the calamity.</p><p>Gui Yingzi shook his head with a solemn expression. “I don’t think it’s as simple as that.”</p><p>The collapse couldn’t possibly make him shrouded in a great sense of danger. Even now, he was still horrified when he recalled the feeling.</p><p>Nonetheless, he couldn’t figure out what danger there was inside the cave. At any rate, there was no doubt Lu Ye was doomed.</p><p>Inside the mine, as the collapse sounded, the cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge came to a standstill, but they were still relatively calm.</p><p>There wouldn’t be a problem as long as the mine didn’t collapse entirely.</p><p>The passageway’s destruction would only mean that they couldn’t leave for the time being. After they killed Lu Ye, they could work together and clear the passageway. As such, they wouldn’t be stuck in the mine forever.</p><p>“I can’t believe he has a helper!” Song Zhui frowned.</p><p>The turn of events was someone’s doing, not an accident.</p><p>Lu Ye had a secret helper who destroyed the passageway after all of them entered the mine.</p><p>However, no one had seen what the helper looked like.</p><p>The incident itself didn’t matter, but the unusual signal Song Zhui derived from it made him feel uneasy.</p><p>He recalled walking behind Si Nan earlier as the man marched forward and mercilessly destroyed the Explosive Wards Lu Ye had set up.</p><p>At that time, he felt that Lu Ye had decided to trigger the Explosive Wards in advance upon realizing that Si Nan was unstoppable. The man must have intended to destroy the passageway to stall for time.</p><p>Now, it seemed that things weren’t that simple.</p><p>The Explosive Wards that had been triggered didn’t destroy the passageway. Instead, it weakened the walls around the passageway and made it susceptible to destruction.</p><p>Lu Ye’s secret helper then destroyed the passageway behind their back, ensuring none of them could leave the mine for the time being.</p><p>The current situation wasn’t a coincidence. Everything was unfolding according to Lu Ye’s plan.</p><p>[What is he trying to achieve?] Song Zhui furrowed his brow, unable to figure out Lu Ye’s motives.</p><p>The only possibility he could think of was that Lu Ye had set up a Teleportation Ward and was ready to run away at any moment. In that case, their mission would be pronounced a failure again.</p><p>Yet, Lu Ye didn’t seem to have the intention of leaving, so there likely wasn’t a Teleportation Ward.</p><p>He also had a secret helper who made everyone stuck in the mine.</p><p>Suddenly, someone was heard laughing. “Lu Yi Ye, are you trying to destroy this mine and make all of us go to Hell with you? In that case, you must be utterly disappointed. Only the passageway has collapsed.”</p><p>Although the empty mine was slightly affected by the tremor, it was still fine and sturdy.</p><p>“That’s the funniest joke I’ve ever heard.” Lu Ye swept a dismissive glance over these cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge. “You don’t have the right to make me go to Hell with you, and I’ve already said that none of you will live to see the next sunrise.”</p><p>The next moment, Lu Ye raised his arm with an emerald pill between his fingers.</p><p>At that instant, the Tree of Glyphs in his Source Spiritual Point was covered in a fog.</p><p>Then, Lu Ye infused his Spiritual Power into the pill and cast it at the cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge.</p><p>“Don’t let that thing come closer!” someone bellowed.</p><p>Whatever the thing that Lu Ye had cast at them, anything he did at such a point was suspicious.</p><p>After the person finished speaking, countless attacks came at the emerald pill. freёwebnoѵel.com</p><p>The lights of different colors soon swept through the emerald pill like a flood, but the next moment, an emerald light wiped out all other colors and spread across the place like a green cloud.</p><p>The Omnipoison Pill, which would be famous across the entire Jiu Zhou and arouse fear in countless cultivators’ hearts in the future, showed its might for the very first time.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
