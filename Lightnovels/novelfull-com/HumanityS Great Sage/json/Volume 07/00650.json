If Lu Ye wished to reach the City Lord‚Äôs Mansion, he had to move across half of the city and arrive at the city centre.</p><p>Even though he now had control over seven insectoids, the trip might still not be safe.</p><p>So far, the strongest insectoids he had come across were in the Real Lake Realm, but he wasn‚Äôt sure if there were insectoids in the Divine Ocean Realm.</p><p>If there were such insectoids, his concealment might not be useful.</p><p>A squad formed by seven insectoids in the Real Lake Realm was undoubtedly powerful. As they moved forward, they killed group after group of insectoids, which allowed Lu Ye‚Äôs battle points to increase rapidly. Now, it was over 20,000 points.</p><p>One had to know that it only required 16,200 battle points to trade for a Golden Amulet from the Vault of Providence. With the battle points he had, he could get one Golden Amulet with some spare points left.</p><p>In such an environment, coupled with the moves Lu Ye could use now, it was the best place for him to earn battle points.</p><p>Throughout the entire Jiu Zhou, there probably had never been any cultivator who had access to such convenience. Although Lu Ye had no idea how to leave this place just yet, he treasured this opportunity.</p><p>He wouldn‚Äôt kill all the insectoids he came across, though. When there were too many of them, he wouldn‚Äôt dare to make such a rash move. He could only make his insectoid squad circle those insectoids. After all, he had concealed his presence and curbed his aura. Since the insectoids didn‚Äôt detect any anomaly, they wouldn‚Äôt stop his squad from moving forward.</p><p>When they passed a street, Lu Ye suddenly noticed an anomaly.</p><p>The ground was covered with the broken limbs of insectoids and their green blood. There were also traces that showed there had been a battle.</p><p>Through the traces, he could tell that the battle was intense as there were many carcasses on the ground.</p><p>This surprised Lu Ye.</p><p>He was sure that he hadn‚Äôt been to this place, so he wasn‚Äôt the one who left behind these traces.</p><p>In that case, it must be the sentries of Xianyuan City Watch who did that.</p><p>There were sentries and all sorts of apparitions in the Lost City of Xianyuan, but those apparitions were weak. Apart from the City Lord and the mysterious red-clothed woman, the rest of them were only in the Spirit Creek Realm.</p><p>In the face of such a calamity, Spirit Creek Realm Masters were powerless to resist.</p><p>Therefore, Lu Ye hadn‚Äôt come across any sentries so far. He believed that when such a disaster struck, all the sentries in the city must have been wiped out.</p><p>Nevertheless, the traces on the battlefield were somewhat odd.</p><p>There were many carcasses of insectoids, many of which were powerful. Therefore, it was a mystery as to how those sentries, who were only in the Spirit Creek Realm, were able to kill those insectoids.</p><p>[Did the City Lord or the red-clothed woman make a move?] If it was either of them, the massacre of insectoids on this level was possible. However, Lu Ye couldn‚Äôt detect their auras anywhere.</p><p>While sitting on the spider‚Äôs back, he led his squad to move across the battlefield. Suddenly, he realised that something was off.</p><p>Insectoids would gnaw at their companions, but these carcasses were still around. Moreover, judging from the blood and their wounds, the battle only took place not long ago.</p><p>In other words, there had been a battle between cultivators of the city and the insectoids in this place moments ago.</p><p>[Is someone still alive?]</p><p>Lu Ye was astounded. Even though he knew the idea sounded ludicrous, he couldn‚Äôt rule out this possibility. One had to know that there were some buildings in the city with red lanterns hung outside. The powerful insectoids could never destroy those buildings, so those people would be safe by hiding inside. ·πò√£ÔºÆ√ì ôŒïùì¢</p><p>As such, if there were still survivors in the city, they must be staying in those special buildings.</p><p>It was probable that carcasses in this place hadn‚Äôt been devoured because the other insectoids nearby had been lured away.</p><p>As the pieces fell into place, Lu Ye led his squad to look around for the survivors.</p><p>An hour later, the squad arrived at a street that was full of insectoids. It seemed like something had attracted them to this place.</p><p>A building was especially conspicuous on the street because all other nearby buildings had been destroyed while this particular one was still intact, looking like a boulder amidst the raging storm.</p><p>The ruins around the building were full of insectoids.</p><p>As expected, there was a red lantern hanging outside that building.</p><p>Lu Ye looked at the building but wasn‚Äôt sure if there were people inside. However, considering the situation, there were likely people hiding inside.</p><p>The insectoids that had gathered together must be attracted to the people inside the building, just like what had happened to him before.</p><p>If there were people inside, they would be in a perilous situation. With so many insectoids around, they wouldn‚Äôt be able to leave for quite a while.</p><p>That said, they only had to wait for a bit longer before the insectoids would leave.</p><p>As time passed, the insectoids with low sentience withdrew from the place. There were still quite many of them that stayed, including powerful insectoids in the Real Lake Realm.</p><p>After one to two hours, everything remained calm. Just as Lu Ye thought he was mistaken, the tightly closed door opened all of a sudden before a figure dashed out of the building.</p><p>Lu Ye, who had been watching everything, was astounded, for the figure that came out of the building was familiar to him.</p><p>Despite his chubby figure, this man was dextrous as he reached an insectoid in a blink and wielded his knife. As a cold glint flickered, the insectoid was cut in half before it even had time to react.</p><p>The man passed through the broken carcass and charged towards the next insectoid. Although he didn‚Äôt exude a powerful aura, he appeared determined to destroy everything in his way. The knife in his hand was razor-sharp as he easily shattered the solid carapace that covered the insectoids.</p><p>[Why is he so powerful?] Lu Ye was dumbfounded.</p><p>As far as he was concerned, this man was only a Heaven Grade Seventh or Eighth Order apparition, but the power he showcased now far exceeded that. It was to the point where Lu Ye was unable to scrutinise his power.</p><p>What was even more shocking was that after the chubby man dashed out of the building, another ten more figures emerged.</p><p>Although Lu Ye didn‚Äôt know who they were, he was familiar with the uniform they were wearing.</p><p>They were the sentries of Xianyuan City Watch!</p><p>More than ten sentries followed the chubby man and made a move at the same time. They soon destroyed the nearby insectoids, whose blood formed into puddles. Many insectoids were alerted as they surrounded those people, besieging them.</p><p>Lu Ye was bewildered, for everything he was seeing was different from what he knew about this city.</p><p>He was already astonished that the chubby man was able to use a power that far exceeded his expectation. Much to his surprise, it was the same case for the sentries.</p><p>When he visited the city in the past, the sentries were only Eighth-Order or Ninth-Order Masters. Only the squad leaders were Heaven Seven or Heaven Eight.</p><p>Now, it seemed that none of the sentries were weaker than Spirit Creek Realm Masters. Most of them were in the Real Lake Realm with a small number of them in the Cloud River Realm. It was undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with.</p><p>This made Lu Ye puzzled as he wondered if he was indeed in the Lost City of Xianyuan.</p><p>Or perhaps the one he had visited previously was a sham.</p><p>Despite the doubts in his heart, he still reacted promptly. He instructed his insectoid squad to kill all the enemies. The next moment, the rest of the insectoids pounced on the opponents except for the spider.</p><p>He didn‚Äôt let the spider take part in the battle because the place was chaotic. If he made the spider charge forward, the repercussions of the battle might expose him, which would make him fall into trouble.</p><p>Although the sentries and the chubby man were formidable, Lu Ye could see that all of them were injured.</p><p>They must have gone through many similar battles before. Even without Lu Ye‚Äôs help, they would still be able to handle the situation, though they would have to consume more energy, and some of them might be killed.</p><p>Nonetheless, things were different now with Lu Ye‚Äôs help.</p><p>Insectoids were not vigilant against their companions. Presently, their attention was all on the sentries. As such, when six insectoids flared up all of a sudden, they easily killed many of the insectoids that used to be their companions.</p><p>The sentries initially didn‚Äôt notice the anomaly, but as time passed, someone detected it and exclaimed, ‚ÄúSir!‚Äù</p><p>A cold glint flickered from the knife in the chubby man‚Äôs hand as he nodded almost imperceptibly. While killing the enemies, he scanned his surroundings.</p><p>A moment later, he set his eyes on the spider that had stayed away from the battlefield. Even though Lu Ye had concealed his presence, he could feel the other party looking straight at him.</p><p>As their eyes met, the man nodded at Lu Ye and continued destroying the enemies.</p><p>[He saw me!]</p><p>Lu Ye felt some ripples coursing through his heart.</p><p>Considering his unique state, his power was equivalent to that of a Real Lake Realm Master, and he had blessed himself with Glyphs that could curb his aura and conceal his presence. Even cultivators who were slightly more powerful than him should not notice him when he was in such a state.</p><p>It was unless the other party was one Major Realm above him.</p><p>In other words, the man he thought was only Heaven Seven or Heaven Eight was actually a Divine Ocean Realm Master.</p><p>As Lu Ye recalled the experiences when he arrived at the Lost City of Xianyuan for the first time, he was shrouded in a sense of surrealism. At that moment, he didn‚Äôt seem able to distinguish reality from dream.</p><p>If the other party was indeed a Divine Ocean Realm Master, it explained why he was so formidable. The insectoids in the Real Lake Realm couldn‚Äôt even take one move from him.</p><p>With Lu Ye‚Äôs squad and the sentries working together, the number of insectoids continued to decrease until there was none left.</p><p>The sentries set their minds at ease, and even the man with a knife let out a breath of relief.</p><p>Amidst the carcasses, only Lu Ye‚Äôs insectoid squad was left. The sentries looked doubtfully and warily at the insectoids, not understanding what was going on with these insectoids which went against their companions earlier.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
