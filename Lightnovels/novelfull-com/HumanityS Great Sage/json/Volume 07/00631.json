That was why she repeatedly lowered her cultivation by producing Omnipoison Pills.</p><p>Besides the amount of power that Hua Ci had to consume when making the Omnipoison Pills, their strength also had something to do with the potency of the poison she ingested.</p><p>When she gave Lu Ye the Omnipoison Pills for the first time, she still wasn’t adept at making the products, so she merely treated it as a practice round. Moreover, to prevent Lu Ye from detecting any anomaly and getting worried, she didn’t consume too much of her power.</p><p>Her skills improved as she made more and more Omnipoison Pills.</p><p>This time, Hua Ci consumed significantly more power to make the pills for Lu Ye than the previous time.</p><p>Also, she had found the source of Myriad Poison Forest and even created a Poison Pond in the depths. When Lu Ye visited her previously, she was leisurely bathing in the pond.</p><p>That was the manifestation of the Myriad Poison Forest’s Poison Source, and it was tremendously more potent than the poison fog she had devoured back then.</p><p>All of these factors led to one result.</p><p>The potency of the Omnipoison Pills that Lu Ye had cast this time was more than double that of the previous time.</p><p>This came as a surprise to Lu Ye. If he were aware of how potent the pills were, he would’ve kept one pill instead of using them all at once.</p><p>Since he had already used them, it was pointless to regret anything.</p><p>No one was spared as the entire mine was filled with poisonous fog. At the same time, the gray fog around Lu Ye’s Tree of Glyphs thickened.</p><p>He was immune to poison as he had the Tree of Glyphs’ protection. As long as there was enough fuel for the tree, he didn’t have to worry about the poison’s influence. However, the same couldn’t be said of the cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge. Even though they had Antidote Pills with them, they were unable to ward off the poison.</p><p>The weaker cultivators reacted even more violently to the poison.</p><p>Initially, only those who were in the Third Order and below collapsed to the ground. They were not dead, but their Rivers of Spiritual Power had stopped flowing altogether, making them unable to activate their powers and causing them to be paralyzed. Under such a circumstance, if they couldn’t dispel the poison quickly, they would be doomed.</p><p>Gradually, even the Fourth-Order and Fifth-Order Masters weren’t able to hold on any longer. Although the stronger cultivators could persevere, they could feel their powers declining sharply.</p><p>A sense of horror and anxiety proliferated. Moreover, in order to destroy the wards before their eyes, the cultivators had been madly activating their powers and using all sorts of moves, which accelerated the poison’s influence on them.</p><p>These cultivators had never expected to come across such a nightmare when they only wanted to besiege and kill Lu Ye.</p><p>They had certainly come into contact with poison before. After all, they were Cloud River Realm Masters, so they had experienced all sorts of strange poison. However, it was their first time dealing with such potent and pervasive poison.</p><p>Just as all of them panicked, Lu Ye, who had been unmoving the entire time, suddenly fished out a Ward Flag and waved it.</p><p>The next moment, a deafening clap of thunder was heard reverberating across the sealed mine.</p><p>Following that, a flash of lightning appeared from above and struck the crowd.</p><p>“Ah!” someone exclaimed as the lightning descended. It was a mystery as to who was unlucky enough to get struck.</p><p>The first bolt of lightning seemed to serve as a signal, for the next instant, even more flashes of lightning descended from above as they penetrated the emerald poisonous fog and played the rhythm of death. ṞäNΟᛒΕ§</p><p>Claps of thunder were continuously heard. When they looked up, they would see countless bolts of lighting descending from above. At the top of the mine was a huge, glowing ward with complicated patterns that constantly flickered. As the lightning struck, people would be heard shrieking.</p><p>It was the Lightning Invocation Ward!</p><p>Lu Ye had built a lot of Explosive Wards, for it was simple to set them up, and they were pretty destructive. Once someone stepped into such a ward, they would be badly injured.</p><p>However, that didn’t mean Lu Ye could only build Explosive Wards.</p><p>He had mastered quite a lot of Glyphs, which could be used as the cores in the wards, and that would allow him to build the corresponding wards.</p><p>The ward with the Invoke Lightning Glyph as the core was Lightning Invocation Ward. Similarly, it was Golden Arc Ward with the Golden Arc Glyph as the core and Fire Ward with the Fire Glyph as the core.</p><p>None of them had expected Lu Ye to have built some wards at the top of the mine in advance. They were fully focused on breaking the wards before their eyes, so it surprised them when danger struck from above.</p><p>After Lu Ye activated the wards’ powers, the place became even more chaotic in an instant.</p><p>The dazzling lightning, Golden Arcs, and blazing fire snakes rained down from above as the wards were running.</p><p>Actually, these wards were not powerful. Usually, even Fifth-Order and Sixth-Order Masters were able to drive them off. However, at this moment, they were all troubled by the poisonous fog, which had massively weakened their powers. As such, the wards seemed lethal when they struck at this point.</p><p>The burnt smell of flesh and a metallic tang permeated the place. Many people lost their lives in the emerald fog, and there didn’t seem to be an end to it.</p><p>The thick fog had filled every part of the mine. As such, both Lu Ye and the cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge couldn’t see each other.</p><p>Anyway, that didn’t matter to him one bit, for everyone else in the mine was his enemy. As such, he only had to lead the powers of the wards to strike the places where many people gathered.</p><p>Someone finally came to their senses and bellowed, “Break the wards above us now!”</p><p>In an instant, many attacks were seen shooting toward the ceiling, destroying the wards and causing the rocks to fall.</p><p>By now, most of the wards Lu Ye had built in the mine had been destroyed. Even though a large number of cultivators were paralyzed, there were the stronger ones who persevered.</p><p>However, when the furious cultivators arrived at the spot where Lu Ye was supposedly located, the man was nowhere in sight.</p><p>Naturally, he wouldn’t just stay there and wait for their arrival.</p><p>The chaotic and dark environment gave him enough room for maneuver. Since everyone was his enemy in this place, he just had to charge around and wield his saber whenever he detected a person’s aura. Without fail, a shriek would be heard, and blood would splash onto the floor.</p><p>Amidst the chaos, Song Zhui ordered, “Stay close to each other to prevent getting killed and report Lu Yi Ye’s whereabouts immediately!”</p><p>However, his voice was soon drowned out by the clamor.</p><p>Realizing that Lu Ye was wandering around to kill them, these cultivators tensed up in an instant. Whenever someone approached them, they would use their most lethal moves, which resulted in many accidental injuries and caused even more conflicts and disturbance.</p><p>The entire place had descended into turmoil.</p><p>Song Zhui secretly chastised them for being useless, but he understood that everyone was naturally anxious under such a circumstance. He was shocked to realize that if this dragged on, it wasn’t impossible for Lu Ye to kill all 2,000 people on his own.</p><p>Presently, cultivators who were in the Fourth Order and below were paralyzed and powerless to counterattack. Song Zhui had asked the cultivators in the Third Order and below to clean up the passageway, but they couldn’t hold on for long before collapsing to the ground.</p><p>The metallic tang in the air thickened, and people never stopped shrieking. More and more souls were lost. In the dark poisonous fog, Lu Ye was like a Grim Reaper. Wherever he went, he would send many people to Hell. These cultivators were powerless to fend him off.</p><p>Moreover, as time passed, the poison’s influence on these cultivators intensified, which resulted in their powers getting weaker and allowed Lu Ye to end their lives more easily.</p><p>There came a moment when Lu Ye bumped into a difficult opponent.</p><p>After the wards at the top of the cave were destroyed, he started moving around to kill his opponents. Regardless of their cultivation, he could kill them with only one move.</p><p>Nevertheless, when he slashed at this burly Body-tempering Cultivator, the other party’s initially weak aura turned formidable all of a sudden. After the Spirit Artifact around his arm fended off Lu Ye’s attack, he extended his other hand towards his opponent and bellowed, “I’ve finally found you!”</p><p>Lu Ye instantly realized that this man had either pretended to be weak or used a Secret Technique that could enhance his power.</p><p>The moment the person made a move, he also revealed his Ninth-Order cultivation.</p><p>Since there were so many cultivators from Thousand Demon Ridge here, it was only natural that there were Ninth-Order Masters. Song Zhui was a Ninth-Order Master, and there must be a few more such people.</p><p>As such, Lu Ye had never put down his guard even when he was charging around.</p><p>He remembered seeing this burly man, who was standing not far away from Song Zhui early.</p><p>The person was none other than Wei Zhong, a Ninth-Order Body-tempering Cultivator.</p><p>Although he and the other Ninth-Order Masters were shocked by Lu Ye’s ruthless moves, they were not flustered in such a situation as they came from powerful backgrounds. Instead, they had been secretly waiting for a chance to strike.</p><p>Lu Ye attacking Wei Zhong was exactly what the latter wanted. That way, Lu Ye’s whereabouts would be exposed. Even if he couldn’t defeat Lu Ye, he just had to hold him back and wait for Song Zhui and the others to come to their senses. By then, they could join forces and capture Lu Ye even though their powers had been significantly weakened.</p><p>As long as Lu Ye was detained, their crisis would be solved, and they only had to clear the passageway to get out of there.</p><p>That was the plan in his mind, but when he extended his hand toward Lu Ye, he failed to grab anything.</p><p>There was no doubt Lu Ye was even more agile than Wei Zhong thought.</p><p>The instant Lu Ye sensed danger, he leapt backwards and raised his left hand before casting an Exotic Treasure he had been holding in his hand. The Exotic Treasure turned into a ray of light and charged towards Wei Zhong.</p><p>At that moment, Wei Zhong felt cold all over his body. It was a natural reaction when he was faced with danger. However, before he could come to his senses, the ray of light arrived and easily penetrated his body, bringing out some blood from the other side.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
