As all his energy left his body, he fell to the ground with a thud.</p><p>He didn’t expect Lu Ye to have something that could end his life. Even though his power had been weakened, he was a robust Body-tempering Cultivator. How was it possible that he was so frail?</p><p>Unbeknownst to him, the Exotic Treasure that Lu Ye had cast was even able to penetrate Ju Jia’s defense in an instant.</p><p>The Exotic Treasure was the Broken Arrow, which Wei Zhong had used before!</p><p>Although Ju Jia was only a Fifth-Order Master, his physique was just as sturdy as that of Wei Zhong, who was a Ninth-Order Master. Since Broken Arrow could shatter Ju Jia’s defense, it could do the same to Wei Zhong.</p><p>Moreover, Lu Ye had caught him off guard, so the outcome wasn’t so surprising.</p><p>However, even though Broken Arrow was powerful, it required a lot of energy to use.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ye had a Spirit Storage Ring with him. After a long time, the ring was filled with Spiritual Power. Following the use of the Broken Arrow, Lu Ye realized that half of the Spiritual Power in the ring was gone.</p><p>In other words, even if he made use of the Spiritual Power in the ring, he could only activate the Broken Arrow once in a short time. If he wanted to use it for the second time, he would consume the rest of the Spiritual Power in the ring and also a bit of his own.</p><p>Besides requiring a lot of energy to use, the other problem with Broken Arrow was that there was a limit to how many times he could use it.</p><p>Exotic Treasures had all sorts of uses, but without exception, there was a limit to how many times one could use them. Also, most of them could only be used once.</p><p>It was the case for Tracking Disc, Golden Body Token, and Deathmatch Platform.</p><p>Even though Broken Arrow wasn’t a single-use consumable, it couldn’t be used many times. When Lu Ye acquired it, there was already a crack on the surface. The crack widened after he used it once. If he had the time to take a proper look, he would realize that he could only use the Broken Arrow one more time.</p><p>Nevertheless, he didn’t have the time to examine the Exotic Treasure. After Broken Arrow killed Wei Zhong, it returned to Lu Ye following his command.</p><p>Although he had gained the upper hand, and many weaker cultivators were powerless to defend themselves, there were still those who were able to counterattack. The fact that he managed to mightily kill a Ninth-Order Body-tempering Cultivator stunned the rest of the powerful cultivators, and it allowed him to make his next move more easily.</p><p>Therefore, he wouldn’t use Broken Arrow again unless it was necessary to do so.</p><p>Truth was, the moment Wei Zhong made a move, Song Zhui, Ning Zizai, and the other Ninth-Order Masters immediately detected it and came over to help, but the next instant, Wei Zhong fell to the ground with no vitality left.</p><p>Covered in the poisonous fog, they couldn’t see what had happened, but they were undoubtedly flabbergasted to realize that Wei Zhong had lost his life.</p><p>Their expressions changed drastically as they stopped in their tracks. Song Zhui called out tentatively, “Brother Wei?”</p><p>Naturally, no one responded to him.</p><p>Song Zhui gulped with difficulty, realizing that the situation was getting out of hand.</p><p>He didn’t expect Lu Ye to be able to kill Wei Zhong. Although Wei Zhong couldn’t fully activate his power under the poison’s influence, he was a staunch Body-tempering Cultivator, after all.</p><p>Prior to this, Song Zhui was still calm and collected. Although the situation was terrible, and Lu Ye was wandering around to kill them, they had many cultivators on their side, and there were several Ninth-Order Masters in charge. As such, Song Zhui believed that Lu Ye could never leave this place alive unless he could kill them all. ℞ἈΝöВĚＳ</p><p>Nonetheless, when Wei Zhong was killed, his confidence faltered.</p><p>If even Wei Zhong couldn’t fend off Lu Ye’s attack, could they protect themselves?</p><p>“Let’s go!” Song Zhui ordered and led his fellow Sect members to the exit. They couldn’t pin their hopes on the weaker cultivators, so they could only clean up the passageway themselves and leave this place as soon as possible.</p><p>Suddenly, someone was heard shrieking behind him. It was supposed to be Junior Brother Yan’s voice. However, he didn’t dare to turn around to look, for he knew he wouldn’t see anything even if he did.</p><p>When he arrived at the passageway, he realized many people had come up with the same idea. A lot of cultivators were scrambling to come to the passageway and clean up the fallen rocks. Nevertheless, due to the large crowd and the fact that everyone was trying to flee, they were not very organized. Not much of the mess had been cleaned up. Instead, they started attacking each other, hoping to be the first to leave.</p><p>In the poisonous fog, Lu Ye was still moving around to kill his opponents.</p><p>His blood-soaked clothes had initially dried up, but they were moist and sticky again now.</p><p>The cultivators were heard shrieking and wailing from different directions. Many of them were actually killed by their companions.</p><p>Just then, some cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge arrived at the passageway entrance upon getting wind of the situation. They arrived late as they had just heard of the news, and there were not many of them.</p><p>By the time they arrived, most of the cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge had entered the mine, and a large part of the passageway had collapsed following Yi Yi’s actions.</p><p>Presently, they were standing outside the entrance and listening to what was going on inside as a myriad of expressions came over them.</p><p>Cloud River Realm Masters had incredible hearing abilities. Moreover, even the slightest noise in an environment such as the passageway would be amplified. As such, even though they were several kilometers away from the mine, they could still hear some strange noise.</p><p>“Why do I hear many people screaming inside?” A cultivator suspected that he was mistaken. “Do you all hear that?”</p><p>Since around 2,000 cultivators had streamed into the mine to end Lu Ye’s life, the battle would supposedly end very soon. However, why were many people heard wailing from inside?</p><p>The noise indicated that the battle was pretty intense.</p><p>“Yes, there are people wailing.” Someone nodded to show that he heard the noise as well. Then, he asked doubtfully, “Does Lu Yi Ye have some helpers with him?</p><p>In that case, the shrieks must be coming from Lu Ye and his helpers. They were currently besieged by the cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge, after all.</p><p>Senior Brother Qin and his fellow Sect members, who were near the entrance, were also listening to the noise. They exchanged glances with solemn expressions.</p><p>They were not sure if Lu Ye had some helpers, but they knew that things turned out to be different from their expectations. Moreover, following Gui Yingzi’s warning, all of them felt their hearts growing heavier. They felt that something terrible was happening.</p><p>Some unimaginable ideas formed in their minds, but they quickly dismissed them and assumed that such things would never happen.</p><p>However, what if the cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge inside were indeed in danger?</p><p>In that case, Gui Yingzi’s warning had undoubtedly come true, and they had saved their own lives by not following everyone else into the mine.</p><p>Just then, two rays of light were coming over from a distance. Their powerful auras showed that they were Ninth-Order Masters.</p><p>They landed near the entrance, after which two men revealed themselves.</p><p>If Lu Ye were here, he would’ve recognised that they were Xia Liang and Tan Sheng.</p><p>After Huo Liaoyuan was killed in the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade, the two of them left the Ameliorate Valley. That was because Xia Liang concluded that when Lu Ye and the others faced a crisis they couldn’t solve, they would make use of the Divine Opportunity Column to return to Jiu Zhou. As such, the two of them decided not to waste any time by staying there.</p><p>They initially intended to go looking for Lu Ye a month later after the latter entered the Cloud River Battlefield again.</p><p>Much to Xia Liang’s surprise, things unfolded differently from what he had expected.</p><p>Lu Ye didn’t return to Jiu Zhou. Instead, he made a deal with the cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge who besieged Ameliorate Valley. Then, he hid somewhere and waited for a chance to kill the invaders on Grand Wilds Peak.</p><p>Following that, he exposed his whereabouts in this place and trapped the cultivators inside the mine.</p><p>Xia Liang and Tan Sheng had already left this area, but they rushed over to this place in a hurry upon getting wind of it.</p><p>Xia Liang swept a glance over them and asked, “Is Lu Yi Ye inside?”</p><p>A cultivator nodded. “Yes, that’s what we heard.”</p><p>“What’s going on now?”</p><p>The cultivator shook his head. “We’ve just arrived, so we aren’t sure what’s going on.”</p><p>“Does anyone know what’s happened?” Tan Sheng asked.</p><p>After giving it some thought, Senior Brother Qin stepped forward and explained, “Half a day ago, around 2,000 cultivators entered the mine following the order of Senior Brother Song Zhui of the Rainbow Temple. For some reason, the passageway collapsed all of a sudden, trapping everyone inside. People from the outside can’t enter either. Moreover, there seems to be an intense battle in the mine, and many people have lost their lives.”</p><p>As Senior Brother Qin related the story to them, Xia Liang and Tan Sheng could also hear the faint shrieks coming from the depths of the passageway.</p><p>They couldn’t help feeling doubtful, and Xia Liang asked with a frown, “How many people are with Lu Yi Ye?”</p><p>Senior Brother Qin replied, “I heard that he’s on his own, but I’m not sure if that’s indeed the case.”</p><p>These people knew little about the situation, so it was impossible to glean any useful information from them. Xia Liang and Tan Sheng exchanged glances before entering the passageway, and the others followed suit in a hurry.</p><p>Only Senior Brother Qin and his fellow Sect members stayed outside, not daring to enter.</p><p>They didn’t follow everyone else into the mine earlier on, and it was too late to do so now. Moreover, following Gui Yingzi’s warning and the turn of events, they didn’t have the guts to step into the passageway.</p><p>They only decided to stay there to find out the outcome of the incident.</p><p>With that said, they believed that regardless of the outcome, Lu Ye was undoubtedly doomed. There was no way he could survive under such a circumstance.</p><p>Not long after Xia Liang and Tan Sheng entered the passageway, they realized the path ahead had indeed been blocked. Furthermore, they could hear the shrieks more clearly from their location.</p><p>At that moment, they realized something was off.</p><p>The noise coming from inside suggested that the battle was intense. If Lu Ye were on his own, he couldn’t have pulled off such a feat.</p><p>[Has Lu Yi Ye brought many people with him? Are they fighting the people on our side right now?]</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
