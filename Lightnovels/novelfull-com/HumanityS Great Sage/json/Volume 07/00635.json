I’ll be waiting for you in Hell!”</p><p>Apart from being scheming and devious, Song Zhui was a brave man. Even when he was faced with the prospect of death, he was unafraid, looking as calm as ever.</p><p>Lu Ye pressed the tip of his saber against the man’s chest and said unenthusiastically, “Don’t make it sound like I’m an evil person. I only wanted to cultivate in Ameliorate Valley in peace, but all of you tried to kill me. You had it coming.”</p><p>Then, he stooped and whispered beside Song Zhui’s ear, “After I kill you, I’ll return to Jiu Zhou and enter Spirit Creek Battlefield again to destroy the Outpost of Rainbow Temple. In the future, I’ll go to the Spirit Creek Battlefield every two months.”</p><p>Song Zhui was undaunted even when he was on the brink of death, but upon hearing Lu Ye’s threat, he became agitated at once. “Don’t you dare!”</p><p>The next instant, the saber penetrated his body and destroyed his heart. His eyes widened as he clenched the weapon, letting the blade slit across his hands until they were covered in blood.</p><p>“Let’s see if I dare.” Lu Ye straightened up and squinted in contempt.</p><p>After the saber was retracted, blood spurted from Song Zhui’s chest. He collapsed to the ground, the light going out of his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ye shook the Inviolable Saber to dispel the blood and put it back in its sheath. Following that, he moved along the passageway and entered the mine, where he searched around. Upon making sure that there was no living person, he let out a breath and sat down before lying flat on the ground.</p><p>He had consumed too much of his Spiritual Power. Although he wasn’t on his last legs yet, he was drained of all energy.</p><p>When he decided to leave Grand Wilds Peak a while back, he didn’t expect things to unfold in such a way, but when he accidentally found this mine, some plans formed in his mind.</p><p>Even though the process was full of difficulties, everything was still within his control. Presently, countless corpses of Thousand Demon Ridge were lying in the mine, and around seven to eight of them were Ninth-Order Masters, including someone like Song Zhui, who came from a Tier-One Sect.</p><p>It could be said that Thousand Demon Ridge suffered immense losses this time. If word got out, it would send a shock wave across the entire Cloud River Battlefield and even Jiu Zhou.</p><p>There was no doubt the Divine Ocean Realm Masters would be aware of Lu Ye’s existence, and he would be targeted and dealt with.</p><p>Anyway, he didn’t regret anything. Even without this incident, those of Thousand Demon Ridge would continue to target him. It was just that they had never succeeded before. On the other hand, Lu Ye managed to grow rapidly after experiencing rounds of suppression. It could be said that without his opponents trying to eliminate him, his power wouldn’t have increased so rapidly.</p><p>In a way, he had to thank those of Thousand Demon Ridge for always trying to vanquish him.</p><p>Despite being exhausted, he knew he couldn’t stay in this place for long.</p><p>The main reason was that the mine was filled with poisonous fog. Even though he was immune to poison, the Tree of Glyphs needed fuel to burn and cleanse the poison entering his body.</p><p>Therefore, he would suffer greater losses if he stayed there any longer.</p><p>As such, even though he wanted to get proper sleep, he got up after resting for about an hour.</p><p>There were many corpses lying on the floor. Every one of them had two to three Storage Bags, and there were also Spirit Artifacts in their hands. That was a considerable wealth.</p><p>Lu Ye darted around the pools of blood and corpses, picking up the Storage Bags and Spirit Artifacts.</p><p>While he was busy, he suddenly received a message on his Battlefield Imprint. He hurriedly took a look and saw it was Yi Yi’s message.</p><p>Some people were clearing the rocks from the other side of the passageway, and the two people ahead of everyone else were Xia Liang and Tan Sheng.</p><p>Lu Ye couldn’t help feeling that those two guys were relentless and extremely lucky.</p><p>If they had barged into the mine along with those 2,000 cultivators, they would’ve lost their lives as well. However, since they arrived late, they were obstructed by the collapsed passageway, which saved their lives. 𝙧𝘼ℕÔ𝖇ËꞨ</p><p>The cultivators on the other side of the passageway were not affected by the poison, so they were still at the peak of their powers. As such, they were efficient in clearing the passageway. According to Yi Yi, they would achieve their goal in just an hour.</p><p>Since Lu Ye had little time left, he had to hurry up.</p><p>It took him less than an hour to collect most of the loot. There had to be things he had neglected, but he didn’t have time to search around carefully.</p><p>He dashed into the passageway and arrived at the ruins where he heard people talking and clearing the rocks from the other side.</p><p>Since he could hear the noise, it showed that the cultivators were already not far away from him.</p><p>He quickly released Amber from Spirit Beast Bag. Yi Yi promptly appeared and snuck into the tiger. Then, Lu Ye stuffed the tiger back into the bag before he returned to the mine with a package over his shoulder.</p><p>The Aerial Lock Ward had been removed in advance. He leapt into the air and landed in a cave in the depths of the mine.</p><p>A moment later, the ward in the cave flickered as the space contorted, after which Lu Ye disappeared.</p><p>Song Zhui’s speculation was right. Lu Ye had indeed built a Teleportation Ward, but it wasn’t on the ground. Instead, it was in a cave on the wall.</p><p>Although he believed there was a great chance of him killing the cultivators using the poison, he had to get prepared for things possibly going against his wishes. The Teleportation Ward could serve as his way out.</p><p>If the Omnipoison Pills didn’t achieve the result he had expected, he would immediately leave the place using the Teleportation Ward.</p><p>Much to his surprise, the Omnipoison Pills were more potent than he had expected. It could be said that the death of 2,000 cultivators was largely thanks to the three pills, for a lot of weaker cultivators were killed by the poison.</p><p>One had to know that the Omnipoison Pills were already potent when Hua Ci was only a Spirit Creek Realm Master. It was hard to imagine how powerful the pills would be when the woman ascended to the Cloud River Realm, not to mention she would go on to reach the Real Lake Realm and the Divine Ocean Realm.</p><p>If she managed to become a Divine Ocean Realm Master one day, there was no one in Jiu Zhou she couldn’t kill with poison.</p><p>Lu Ye already knew that Hua Ci must have acquired an incredible inheritance, but after this incident, he came to realize that the inheritance was more terrifying than he had expected.</p><p>Inside the cave, Lu Ye’s figure disappeared as the Teleportation Ward started taking effect. Three breaths of time later, the ward he had activated in advance destroyed the Teleportation Ward.</p><p>The loud noise and tremor shocked the cultivators on the other side who were cleaning up the mess. Xia Liang and Tan Sheng were both astounded and doubtful.</p><p>Around an hour ago, the noise coming from the mine started dying down gradually until no more sounds were heard.</p><p>No one knew what was going on in the mine, but Xia Liang and Tan Sheng were overwhelmed with unease.</p><p>A long time later, someone announced joyfully, “We’ve reached the end of the passageway!”</p><p>The cultivators started cheering as there was a gap at the end of the passageway, but before they could celebrate, a green fog wafted from the gap.</p><p>The cultivators nearest to the gap accidentally breathed in the fog. They felt dizzy in an instant, and their bodies went weak.</p><p>“It’s poison!” someone exclaimed, after which the cultivators moved backwards.</p><p>“Go away!” Xia Liang ordered and wielded his weapon, the Saber Light destroying the last of the blockage. The rocks came apart, revealing the entrance to the mine. However, even more of the poisonous fog billowed from the mine, forcing the cultivators to keep retreating, and they looked discomfited.</p><p>Ultimately, they had no choice but to activate their Spiritual Powers and push the poisonous fog back into the mine.</p><p>Soon, they caught sight of the situation in the depths of the mine.</p><p>When they saw what had happened, their expressions changed drastically.</p><p>Inside the mine, countless corpses lay on the ground. The blood streaming out of their corpses formed into puddles, and the ground had been dyed red.</p><p>When someone caught sight of Song Zhui’s corpse leaning against the wall, he said in a trembling voice, “T-That’s Senior Brother Song Zhui!”</p><p>This person had met Song Zhui outside Ameliorate Valley several days ago, so he could recognise him at once.</p><p>The Ninth-Order Master was still high-spirited outside Ameliorate Valley back then, but now, his corpse was seated on the floor with his back against the wall, looking like a pile of mud. His eyes were still wide open, as though he was unresigned to the fact that he was killed just like that. A hint of fear and unease remained on his face, which showed that he had heard something unnerving before his death.</p><p>Song Zhui was dead, and even more corpses lay around him. The entire mine was in an eerie silence.</p><p>They felt cold all over their bodies as an unimaginable idea formed in their minds.</p><p>Someone asked anxiously, “Is anyone still around?”</p><p>His voice reverberated across the place, but no one responded to him.</p><p>Some people were heard gulping with difficulty.</p><p>“I’ll go in and have a look,” Xia Liang suggested upon realizing that something was off. He heard that around 2,000 people had entered the mine, so it wasn’t likely that all of them were dead.</p><p>“Be careful!” Tan Sheng warned.</p><p>Xia Liang nodded and activated his Spiritual Power Shield to protect himself. Then, he consumed an Antidote Pill before dashing into the mine.</p><p>Over ten breaths of time later, he returned to the passageway with a solemn expression, and there was a note of greenness on his face.</p><p>“How is it?” Tan Sheng asked.</p><p>Xia Liang shook his head. “All of them are dead.”</p><p>Although Tan Sheng already had some speculation, he still couldn’t believe it upon hearing Xia Liang’s words. “They’re all… dead?”</p><p>All 2,000 people were cultivators, not commoners. How were they killed just like that?</p><p>Suddenly recalling another matter, he asked, “Is Lu Yi Ye dead as well?”</p><p>“I have no idea.” Xia Liang shook his head.</p><p>Although the poisonous fog in the mine had become thinner, no one could stay inside for a long time. Despite being a Ninth-Order Master, Xia Liang had to come out quickly. He only spent more than ten breaths of time scanning his surroundings, and the situation he saw was like a living hell.</p><p>Even though he didn’t have time to look carefully, he was certain that all the cultivators who had entered the mine previously were all dead.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
