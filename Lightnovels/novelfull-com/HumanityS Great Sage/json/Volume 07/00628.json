Gui Yingzi, a Ghost Cultivator, was able to detect potential danger that was imperceptible to an average person.</p><p>Take what happened when they stepped into the passageway as an example. If not for the fact that Gui Yingzi had sensed some danger and given them a heads-up in time, Senior Brother Qin, who was in front of everyone, would have suffered a more severe injury.</p><p>“Are you sensing something?” Senior Brother Qin asked.</p><p>Gui Yingzi’s eyes became a shade redder as he shook his head. “I don’t know, but it’s very dangerous.”</p><p>Since he started cultivating, his talent had helped him dodge many crises. For example, when he was in the Myriad Poison Forest on the Spirit Creek Battlefield and the Carnage Colosseum on the Cloud River Battlefield, he managed to flee in time after detecting danger in advance. It was proven that his vigilance had helped him evade countless calamities, which allowed a weak cultivator like him to stay alive. Those who liked to watch a good show and were more powerful than him were all killed.</p><p>However, there had never been a time when he felt this alarmed.</p><p>He had a feeling that if they entered the mine, the crisis they would face would be deadlier than anything they had experienced before.</p><p>Both Senior Brother Qin and Senior Sister Hu were hesitant.</p><p>Gui Yingzi dissuaded them by saying, “Senior Brother, too many people have participated in this matter. Even if we succeed, we won’t get a lot of benefits. It’s not worth it to risk our lives for such negligible benefits. Even if I’m wrong, we’ll only lose some resources. But what if I’m right?”</p><p>If he was right, they would dodge another crisis.</p><p>Senior Brother Qin was undoubtedly swayed. He patted Gui Yingzi’s hand and nodded. “Alright, we’ll be staying outside.”</p><p>Only then did Gui Yingzi breathe a sigh of relief. Honestly, there was nothing he could do if Senior Brother Qin insisted on entering the mine despite his dissuasion. He could only make sure to steer clear of the matter, but he couldn’t force anyone to do the same, even though they were from the same Sect.</p><p>Fortunately, Senior Brother Qin wasn’t obstinate.</p><p>Senior Sister Hu asked, “Do we have to give the others a heads-up?”</p><p>Senior Brother Qin shook his head. “No one will believe us.”</p><p>The cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge gathering in this place were like cats catching a whiff of fish as they streamed into the passageway. It wouldn’t matter that Senior Brother Qin and the others refused to enter. However, if they warned others against doing so, not only would they be mocked, but some people might even suspect they had some ill intentions.</p><p>The cultivators slowly entered the mine until only Senior Brother Qin and his fellow Sect members were left outside. The place was initially boisterous, so it was difficult to get accustomed to the quietness now.</p><p>Dull sounds were heard coming from the depths of the mine. Song Zhui and the others managed to catch up to Si Nan and saw the incredible sight.</p><p>Si Nan continued to move forward as Explosive Wards were activated, causing rocks to roll down the trembling walls.</p><p>They came to the same conclusion as Si Nan. The person who had set up the wards must have realized that his wards could no longer stop Si Nan, so he decided to blow up the passageway to buy some time for himself.</p><p>Nevertheless, these wards were not powerful enough. As such, even though the passageway was trembling, it was still pretty sturdy. As long as there wasn’t any external force, the passageway wasn’t at risk of collapsing at any moment.</p><p>Anyway, it wouldn’t matter if a part of the passageway collapsed. All of them were Cloud River Realm Masters. So long as they were not buried alive, they wouldn’t lose their lives. It would only take them some time and effort to clear the passageway.</p><p>Despite being meandering, there was an end to the passageway.</p><p>The noise coming from the Explosive Wards stopped. When the last bit of fire went out, an empty mine came into everyone’s sight.</p><p>Si Nan was the first one to step into it, followed by Song Zhui and the others. Then, the cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge streamed into the mine as well.</p><p>It was dark inside the mine, but Song Zhui and the others still immediately detected a familiar aura as they looked in that direction.</p><p>Just then, someone cast a spell. Even though the spell wasn’t lethal, it was extremely bright as it rose into the air like a rising Sun, illuminating the entire mine.</p><p>It was a big space that was full of rocks. In the deepest part of the mine, a figure clad in blood-soaked clothes was seated. The blood had dried up, causing his clothes to harden.</p><p>He was only seated there in silence as he looked calmly at these unwelcome guests.</p><p>“Lu Yi Ye!” someone shouted, and then all of them broke into a commotion.</p><p>Before this, although the cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge had speculated that Lu Ye was hiding in the mine, no one had any proof.</p><p>It wasn’t until this moment that the man, whom they had been hunting down for a long time, finally came into their sight.</p><p>The moment the person finished speaking, countless spells and lights from Spirit Artifacts rained on Lu Ye.</p><p>Nonetheless, the distance between them was too far. Even though Lu Ye was within their attack range, their attacks had significantly weakened by the time they reached the man.</p><p>A light screen suddenly appeared around Lu Ye. It was apparently a Defensive Ward.</p><p>The weakened attacks struck the Defensive Ward and formed layers of ripples, but they couldn’t harm the man one bit. Even the ward showed no signs of cracking.</p><p>These cultivators were understandably displeased, finally realizing why Lu Ye stayed so far away.</p><p>Someone bellowed, “Get ready to die, Lu Yi Ye!”</p><p>Another person growled, “Let’s see how you can still flee from us!”</p><p>Given the confined space and the stark difference in power, anyone would assume that Lu Ye stood no chance of fleeing. It was unless he could use the help of the Divine Opportunity Column again and return to Jiu Zhou.</p><p>Fortunately, they didn’t see any Divine Opportunity Column anywhere near the man.</p><p>Yet, these people only had the guts to clamor, but they didn’t dare to move forward. Since Lu Ye had set up so many wards in the passageway, it was logical to believe that there were some wards in the mine as well.</p><p>They were certain that it must be the case, so none of them dared to make a move before the wards were destroyed.</p><p>Song Zhui approached Si Nan and whispered, “Lu Yi Ye is able to build Teleportation Wards, Brother Si Nan. Can you see such a ward around him?”</p><p>When they were in the Ameliorate Valley back then, Lu Ye made use of Teleportation Ward to run away.</p><p>Although they didn’t see anything that looked like a Divine Opportunity Column, Lu Ye could still flee if he had set up a Teleportation Ward.</p><p>With that said, the chances were low. As far as Song Zhui was concerned, Lu Ye had accidentally exposed his whereabouts and hidden in the mine to recuperate. It was impossible that he had set up a Teleportation Ward in advance unless he had foreseen what was to happen and prepared a trump card.</p><p>Si Nan looked around seriously for a moment before shaking his head. “I don’t see any traces of Teleportation Ward, but I can’t rule out the possibility that he might’ve hidden it somewhere.”</p><p>Since the distance between them was long, he couldn’t see everything clearly.</p><p>Song Zhui remarked, “Well, he’s in danger now. If he had built a Teleportation Ward, he would’ve used it and fled. There isn’t a need for him to cover it. Since we don’t see such a ward, it surely isn’t there.”</p><p>Lu Ye was doomed in such a despairing situation. Unfortunately, Ying Wuji had failed his mission in the Ameliorate Valley back then. Otherwise, Song Zhui would not have had to worry about not having enough cultivation resources again.</p><p>“It’s not easy to kill him, though. He has built a lot of wards here. Are all of you going to wait for me to break the wards or attack him with brute force?” Si Nan asked.</p><p>Suddenly, a hint of doubt formed in his heart.</p><p>Supposedly, if Lu Ye wanted to fend them off, the entrance to the mine would be the best place for him to build some wards. In actuality, there were no wards at the entrance at all. It was as if Lu Ye had specifically left a safe space for the cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge to take a breather. frёewebnoѵēl.com</p><p>At any rate, Si Nan didn’t have time to think too deeply about this. He simply assumed that Lu Ye didn’t have enough Ward Flags.</p><p>The man had set up a lot of wards in the passageway and the mine, so he must have consumed an unimaginable number of Ward Flags.</p><p>Still, even more cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge were streaming into the mine. There were a total of roughly 2,000 people, and the passageway was narrow, so it was understandable that it took time for all of them to enter the mine.</p><p>Song Zhui said, “Although it’s safer to break the wards first, it’ll also take a longer time. Lu Yi Ye is cunning, so we’d better not waste too much time. I’d suggest attacking him with brute force. Everyone, what do you say?”</p><p>His question was directed at the other Ninth-Order Masters.</p><p>Ning Zizai replied, “You’ll make the call, Brother Song.”</p><p>Wei Zhong and the other two Ninth-Order Masters were fine with anything.</p><p>Only then did Song Zhui dip his head. “We’ll attack him directly, then.” Although there might be some casualties in that case, there wouldn’t be a problem as long as they were careful enough.</p><p>At the thought of this, he raised his arm and shouted, “Fellow cultivators, Lu Yi Ye is right before our eyes. If you want to share the reward, follow me to break his wards and end his life!”</p><p>With that, he took the initiative to launch an attack on an empty space.</p><p>He couldn’t break the wards like Si Nan, nor could he see where the wards were. However, as long as they were powerful enough, they could eliminate everything, rendering the wards useless.</p><p>He certainly couldn’t achieve that on his own, but with all the cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge joining forces, they could destroy everything regardless of how many wards Lu Ye had built.</p><p>These cultivators launched their attacks after Song Zhui. At that moment, the Spiritual Powers in the mine were a mess, and the colors of different lights flickered.</p><p>The attacks struck the ground over and over again. All the hidden wards were destroyed before they were even triggered.</p><p>Some impatient cultivators leapt into the air to attack Lu Ye, but before they could even fly high, they felt immense pressure descending on them, causing them to suffocate.</p><p>It was apparent that an Aerial Lock Ward had been set up in the mine.</p><p>Sounds of explosions were continuously heard. These cultivators formed into an arc as they launched their attacks and soldiered on, inching closer to Lu Ye and bringing with them an aura of destruction.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
