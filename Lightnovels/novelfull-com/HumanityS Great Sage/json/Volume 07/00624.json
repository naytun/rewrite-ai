He originally thought that it was just a well-hidden cave that could be used as a shelter, but the cave stretched too deep into the mountain.</p><p>Feeling pensive, he walked to the side and examined the features of the cave. The rock walls on both sides of the cave showed signs of being mined in the past. Moreover, these traces indicated that quite some time had passed.</p><p>This was not a cave! It was a mine!</p><p>In the past, he had served as a mining slave under the Evil Moon Valley and spent many years toiling away in the mining tunnels. Therefore, he could easily determine whether or not this place was a mine.</p><p>It could be that this place contained valuable ores in the past, and cultivators had figured out a method to mine the ores. As a result, the mining tunnels developed during the mining process had been preserved over the years. There were many similar areas scattered throughout the Cloud River Battlefield and the Spirit Creek Battlefield, so it was not a surprising discovery.</p><p>Lu Ye was not particularly interested in the mine. After all, the mine had existed for a long time. Even if there were highly valuable ores in the past, these ores would have been mined clean by now. How could he hope to find anything?</p><p>He continued to walk deeper into the mine. After walking for several kilometers, an enormous cavity suddenly appeared in front of him. It was an enormous and spacious area, slightly bigger than the space occupied by the Ameliorate Arcane Glade.</p><p>A quick estimation of his position indicated that he should be deep within the belly of the mountain by now. The ores hidden here in the past must have been extremely valuable. Otherwise, the mountain would not have been hollowed out so much.</p><p>Although the cavity was completely shrouded in darkness, Lu Ye’s sight was not affected in the slightest. He studied the hollowed-out cavity, then a vague idea suddenly popped up in his mind. As his thoughts churned excitedly, the idea became clearer and more distinct.</p><p>“Lu Ye, are we resting here tonight?” Yi Yi had already taken a look around the mine and found nothing dangerous. On the contrary, she found some man-made traces left behind in the cavity. It would seem that others had also found this place as there were traces of people resting here in the past. The entrance of this mine might be hidden, but it was ultimately discoverable.</p><p>“No!” Lu Ye shook his head.</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“We’re going to give the Thousand Demon Ridge another present!”</p><p>Lu Ye originally had no other intentions after hunting for several consecutive nights in the Grand Wilds Peak. Not only did he kill many Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators, but there was even an Eighth Order Realm Master among his victims. The main reason was that his strength had been lacking. There was no point even if he had other intentions. That was why he decided to leave the Grand Wilds Peak.</p><p>However, a plan involuntarily came to mind when he saw the enormous cavity. If his plan succeeded, then he could cause a heavy blow to the Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators who had been searching for him! Especially against Ninth Order Realm Masters like Song Zhui! He might be no match for Song Zhui in a direct confrontation, but he might have the chance to kill Song Zhui if his plan succeeded!</p><p>Just as he had previously surmised: Revenge should be done as quickly as possible in a place like the Cloud River Battlefield and should not be delayed. Otherwise, there might not be another chance for revenge in the future.</p><p>Then, Lu Ye turned around and walked outside with brisk footsteps.</p><p>Yi Yi might not know what Lu Ye was planning, but she knew that he was up to no good when she saw the expression on his face. Hence, she did not question him and quickly followed after him.</p><p>Lu Ye’s preparations took a whole day. During this period, the Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators continued searching for his whereabouts in the Grand Wilds Peak only to find nothing.</p><p>Somewhere in the Grand Wilds Peak, Song Zhui’s companions rested and recovered their strength. Meanwhile, Song Zhui communicated with several other cultivators and asked them about the situation on their side. Then, he sighed heavily after a short while.</p><p>Three days had passed. During the past three days, the Thousand Demon Ridge had not suffered any further losses aside from several unlucky cultivators who were mauled to death after they encountered powerful Spirit Beasts that they could not defeat. At present, all the signs clearly indicated that Lu Ye had left the Grand Wilds Peak.</p><p>Although he was frustrated and unwilling to accept the situation, there was nothing he could do.</p><p>Lu Ye had previously taken the initiative to leave the Arcane Glade and given them the chance to hunt him down. Unfortunately, their efforts proved to be useless! Despite having hundreds of Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators searching frantically, they had neither seen hide nor hair of Lu Ye!</p><p>Even though Song Zhui was reluctant to admit the fact, he knew that the operation was a complete failure. The enormous reward that was originally at the tip of his fingers had flown away from right under his nose.</p><p>Now that Lu Yi Ye had left the Grand Wilds Peak, he was bound to be more cautious in the future. It would not be easy to find him again.</p><p>Just as Song Zhui was musing over his thoughts, one of his Junior Brothers nearby suddenly opened his eyes and raised his hand to tap on his Battlefield Imprint. It was evident that he had received a message.</p><p>After the Junior Brother checked the message, his expression immediately changed drastically. “Senior Brother! We found Lu Yi Ye’s whereabouts!”</p><p>Song Zhui had already given up on finding Lu Ye at this point, but he immediately felt as though he could see a ray of hope shining through the darkness when he heard those words. He quickly inquired, “Where?”</p><p>“He’s at the outer edges of the Grand Wilds Peak! Moreover, he seems to be injured! And, his injuries seem to be fairly serious!”</p><p>“The outer edges of the Grand Wilds Peak…” Song Zhui muttered under his breath.</p><p>The location made sense. There had been no casualties among the Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators over the past three days. Judging by the situation, Lu Ye left the vicinity three days ago and arrived at the outer edges of the Grand Wilds Peak recently.</p><p>“Let’s talk on the way!” Song Zhui ordered. Then, he immediately summoned a flying-type Spirit Artifact and soared into the air.</p><p>The situation puzzled him. Over the past few days, many powerful cultivators had diligently searched for traces of Lu Ye only to find nothing. So, how did Lu Ye’s whereabouts suddenly get exposed at the outer edges of the Grand Wilds Peak?</p><p>Whilst heading toward the outer edges of the Grand Wilds Peak, Song Zhui inquired about the specific situation. Only then did he learn the truth.</p><p>Lu Ye’s whereabouts were revealed by accident. At the time, he had been hiding inside a well-hidden cave to rest and recover his strength. It just so happened that a team of Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators had also entered the cave to rest. Consequently, both parties ran into each other inside the cave. When the Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators recognised Lu Ye’s appearance, they were overjoyed and immediately unleashed their full might at Lu Ye. In the end, Lu Ye had fled!</p><p>“Wait a minute…” Song Zhui raised a hand to interrupt his Junior Brother with a suspicious expression. “Lu Yi Ye escaped? Does that mean the cultivators survive?”</p><p>“Two died, but Lu Yi Ye seemed to be heavily injured and unwilling to fight. It seems he fled from the battle as soon as possible.”</p><p>Lu Ye was capable of decimating teams consisting of Sixth Order Realm and Seventh Order Realm Masters, but he had failed to eliminate the cultivators along the outer edges of the Grand Wilds Peak whose cultivation was generally uneven.</p><p>Looking at the situation, his injuries must be severe indeed. Moreover, his severe injuries might be the reason that prompted his decision to leave the Grand Wilds Peak. That was why the Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators had not suffered any casualties over the past three days.</p><p>Song Zhui did not think too deeply about the reason for Lu Ye’s serious injuries. After all, Lu Ye killed so many people recently. It was only natural for him to receive some injuries in return.</p><p>There were many Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators surrounding the outer edges of the Grand Wilds Peak. In fact, it was not an exaggeration to say that the numbers were ten times higher than the number of cultivators crawling in the depths of the Grand Wilds Peak. It would not have been a big deal if Lu Ye had remained safely hidden. However, it would not be easy for him to go back into hiding once his whereabouts were exposed.</p><p>“After encountering the first team of Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators, he killed two of them and escaped. He later also encountered several other teams and fought with them, but he eventually vanished.”</p><p>“Vanished? How did he vanish?” Song Zhui was astonished.</p><p>“I don’t know. The person who sent me the information did not seem to know much either. However, it can be confirmed that Lu Yi Ye has not left the area. Many people have gathered in that location to search for his whereabouts.”</p><p>“Hurry up!” Song Zhui shouted.</p><p>They increased their speed significantly and hastily sped toward the outer edges of the Grand Wilds Peak.</p><p>Seeing as they had received the news about Lu Ye, it was only a matter of time before the other Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators received the same information. At that time, all the Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators searching for Lu Ye in the depths of the Grand Wilds Peak would gather at the outer edges of the Grand Wilds Peak. If they were too slow to arrive, then they would be too late to participate in the hunt.</p><p>It was just as Song Zhui expected. At this moment, countless teams were setting off from the depths of the Grand Wilds Peak and heading toward the outer edges of the Grand Wilds Peak.</p><p>At the outer edges of the Grand Wilds Peak where Lu Ye recently appeared, there were traces of Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators everywhere within a five-kilometer radius. Every one of them was frantically searching for Lu Ye’s whereabouts.</p><p>They originally thought that the hunt for Lu Ye would be unrelated to them since their cultivation was too weak to venture deep into the Grand Wilds Peak. Contrary to their expectations, Lu Ye had escaped to the outer edges of the Grand Wilds Peak and accidentally revealed his whereabouts during the process.</p><p>A golden opportunity had landed before them. The heavily wounded Lu Ye was currently hiding in an unknown location. In this situation, the person who found him first would be able to rise to riches overnight.</p><p>The desire for the huge bounty on Lu Ye’s head made many Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators excited. Hence, they spared no effort in searching for Lu Ye. Be that as it may, they failed to find any traces of his whereabouts. That was until a small team of five appeared!</p><p>…</p><p>Gui Yingzi was actually very resistant to the search for Lu Ye’s whereabouts. It was not that he was unmoved by the enormous reward. He simply had an instinctive feeling that he could not make an enemy of Lu Ye. Otherwise, he would suffer a tragic fate.</p><p>Not including their secret confrontation during the Spirit Creek Battlefield’s Roll of Supremacy, he had actually met Lu Ye on two occasions. Nevertheless, both encounters left a deep impression on him. Not only did a huge and flaming beast—one of the Four Sacred Beasts—appear at each encounter, but countless Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators lost their lives each time.</p><p>Their first meeting was outside the Spirit Creek Battlefield’s Myriad Poison Forest, and their second meeting was inside the Cloud River Battlefield’s Carnage Colosseum.</p><p>Gui Yingzi was very talented. As a result, he had been ranked ninth on the Spirit Creek Battlefield’s Roll of Supremacy back then. Nevertheless, it was not his talent but his intuition that was his greatest trump card. His intuition was unrelated to the strength of his Mental Power. On the contrary, his intuition was similar to an inherent skill that gave him a strong sense of premonition whenever he was in danger. It was by relying on his intuition that he managed to avoid various fatal risks throughout his cultivation journey.</p><p>Take this occasion for example, his heart had been pounding violently during the search for Lu Ye. There was not a moment of rest, as though something very dangerous was about to occur.</p><p>Although he did not wish to participate in the search, he could not object to the persuasion of his companions. There was nothing he could do except join them. Even if they encountered danger, they would be able to avoid some risks with him there… At least, that was what he believed.</p><p>At this moment, he was a Third Order Cloud River Realm Master. His cultivation speed could not be considered slow, but he was undoubtedly inferior when compared to Lu Ye.</p><p>“Senior Brother Qin, why do we keep circling around in this area?” One of the female cultivators in the team abruptly asked. This female cultivator was known as Senior Sister Hu. She was not only very pretty, but her figure was also very slim. The rest of her companions seemed to have some feelings for her. On the other hand, Gui Yingzi was the only exception.</p><p>[Women will only affect the speed at which I can draw my blade! How does wasting energy to court a woman compare to the happiness of working hard on my cultivation!?]</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
