Instead, more and more insectoids had come together, which made Lu Ye feel threatened. To avoid getting killed, he had no choice but to come back.</p><p>Since his speculation had been verified, he was naturally exultant.</p><p>But soon, he discovered that things were more complicated than he thought.</p><p>That was because the brief battle earlier had made him frail.</p><p>This kind of frailty was unlike the feeling caused by injuries. It was more like a sense of burnout after he exerted himself.</p><p>He instantly realized that even though he could use moves that were exclusive to the Divine Ocean Realm Masters in advance due to the environment and his unique state, his soul was still too weak, after all.</p><p>Undoubtedly, his soul was stronger than those of the cultivators in the same Realm, but it wasn‚Äôt powerful enough to allow him to use Divine Glyphs to deal with his enemies for a long time.</p><p>Given the environment and his current state, if he used up his Spiritual Power, he could replenish it by consuming Spirit Pills. However, if his Soul Power was depleted or even injured, he would have to rely on Soul Cleansing Water, which he had a limited amount of.</p><p>He had previously used one drop of it, so he wouldn‚Äôt want to keep consuming it unless it was necessary to do so.</p><p>In that case, he couldn‚Äôt frequently use Divine Glyphs even though they were effective in destroying the insectoids. Otherwise, once his Soul Cleansing Water ran out, he would be in trouble.</p><p>At that moment, he couldn‚Äôt help but feel disappointed. The brief battle earlier had allowed him to earn another 2,000 battle points. If he could use Divine Glyphs without worries, he would obtain a large number of battle points in a short time.</p><p>Insectoids were heard raining attacks on the building from the outside again. Lu Ye was unflustered, for a building like this with a red lantern hung outside the door was protected by a mysterious power, ensuring that it was indestructible.</p><p>As for where the mysterious power came from, Lu Ye had an answer in his heart.</p><p>The noise outside slowly subsided. The insectoids had low sentience, after all. Even though they had seen Lu Ye entering the building, they would forget him when he was nowhere to be seen for a long time. They soon went on doing their own things.</p><p>Lu Ye recuperated inside the house until there was no more noise outside. After waiting for a long time, he approached the door and looked out through the gap.</p><p>The carcasses of the insectoids had disappeared. Only the green blood on the ground served as a reminder that there had been a battle.</p><p>As for where the carcasses went‚Ä¶ Naturally, they had been eaten by insectoids that were still alive. Insectoids would just eat anything that could provide energy.</p><p>Lu Ye had experienced an insectoid attack when he was on the Spirit Creek Battlefield. Wherever the insectoids went, there wouldn‚Äôt be any vitality left; not even a strand of grass could stay alive.</p><p>Anyway, the fact that there were insectoids showed that an insectoid nest existed. Lu Ye wondered where the nest was in the Lost City of Xianyuan.</p><p>He immediately recalled the crack he had seen in the sky where countless insectoids had emerged from.</p><p>Was the insectoid nest inside the crack?</p><p>Under normal circumstances, to deal with the insectoids, one had to destroy the insectoid nest to solve the problem at its source. However, the problem looming over the Lost City of Xianyuan was apparently beyond Lu Ye‚Äôs ability to solve. Therefore, the moment he realized where the nest was located, he knew he was powerless to do anything about it. ùñóùí∂Œù»Æ ôƒòÔº≥</p><p>First of all, there was an Aerial Lock Ward in place, so he couldn‚Äôt fly higher than 30 meters, whereas the crack in the sky was hundreds of meters above the ground. Regardless of how powerful he was, he simply couldn‚Äôt reach it.</p><p>There were several insectoids roaming around on the street. Lu Ye blessed himself with Glyphs that could curb his aura and conceal his presence before he gently pushed the door open and stepped out.</p><p>This time, his goal wasn‚Äôt to kill any insectoids. Instead, he was looking for a kind of insectoid that met his requirements.</p><p>Regardless of the reason he even arrived at the Lost City of Xianyuan, he had to get some benefits out of it.</p><p>Soul Cleansing Water and the battle points acquired from killing insectoids were benefits that an average cultivator had no access to. Despite being in a perilous situation, Lu Ye also stood a chance to gain massive rewards.</p><p>He couldn‚Äôt sustain Divine Glyphs for a long time, for they were highly energy-consuming. Although he could curb his aura and conceal his presence to let him move around stealthily, it was difficult for him to pass the insectoids and arrive at the City Lord‚Äôs Mansion.</p><p>Moreover, he couldn‚Äôt kill the insectoids to earn battle points in such a situation.</p><p>To solve these problems, he had to take some risks.</p><p>As for whether he would succeed, he wasn‚Äôt sure. Regardless, he had to give it a shot.</p><p>With his figure being invisible, he moved along the streets and saw different types of insectoids. Soon, he was certain about his current location.</p><p>He was probably on the periphery of the Lost City of Xianyuan.</p><p>The city covered a large area. When he came to the city as an Eighth-Order Spirit Creek Realm Master back then, he couldn‚Äôt visit all the places. As such, he had no idea how big it actually was.</p><p>Having said that, his current location was supposed to be in the same direction as the crack in the sky.</p><p>What was worth mentioning was that rarely any insectoids emerged from the crack again. Perhaps most of the insectoids had left the insectoid nest.</p><p>Although the insectoids had low sentience, it was difficult to scrutinize their other abilities. Basically, every type of insectoid had a special forte.</p><p>Take the mantises, which Lu Ye was most familiar with, as an example. They had the best combat skills among the insectoids he had seen before. They acted just like Combat Cultivators when they wielded the blades on their front legs.</p><p>On the other hand, the insectoids that looked like hounds had sensitive olfactory organs.</p><p>Even though Lu Ye had curbed his aura and concealed his presence using Glyphs, he was almost detected by the hound-like insectoids on several occasions. As such, he would stay away from those insectoids when he came across them.</p><p>There were also insectoids that looked like hedgehogs. They were covered in spines, looking like they had no weaknesses. Faced with such insectoids, Lu Ye felt that he could only use attacks on the soul to defeat them. There were no other ways.</p><p>Additionally, the pink, chunky insectoid that looked like a silkworm, which Lu Ye had come across before, was full of poison, and even the threads it spat out were venomous.</p><p>Such an insectoid wasn‚Äôt that much of a threat to Lu Ye. With the Tree of Glyphs in his possession, he was immune to poison. Nevertheless, poison wasn‚Äôt its only weapon. The threads it spat out could be turned into a huge web to trap its enemies, and it would be hard to get rid of it.</p><p>Wherever Lu Ye went, he would memorize the locations of the buildings where there were red lanterns outside. They could serve as his shelter when he was in danger.</p><p>All in all, such buildings were few and far between. Usually, he would only come across one after moving along several streets.</p><p>It took him four hours to find an insectoid that met his requirements.</p><p>He had bumped into some suitable insectoids before, but a large number of them had gathered together, so it was difficult for Lu Ye to use his move.</p><p>Finally, he found an insectoid that was on its own.</p><p>The insectoid was pretty large. At first glance, it looked like a spider with the carapace protecting it from the back to the belly. Its hideous teeth were jagged, looking terrifying.</p><p>Although Lu Ye hadn‚Äôt exchanged moves with the insectoid yet, he could tell it was in the Real Lake Realm.</p><p>The reason he set his eyes on this insectoid was that it was huge enough with a broad back. That way, he could sit stably on it after concealing his presence.</p><p>Certainly, the prerequisite was that he could put his idea into action. If things went against his wishes, he wouldn‚Äôt be able to use the next move.</p><p>Having said that, he didn‚Äôt think there would be a problem, for the insectoids had low sentience. That move might not be effective on cultivators in the same Realm, but it was powerful against insectoids.</p><p>He approached the spider in silence and stopped in his tracks when he was six meters away from it.</p><p>The distance was dangerous. Although spiders were not known to have sensitive olfactory organs, the short distance would make the insectoid realize something was off.</p><p>Nonetheless, Lu Ye took the initiative to reveal himself before the insectoid could react.</p><p>In an instant, his eyes met with the insectoid‚Äôs compound eyes. At the same time, he grabbed the hilt of Inviolable Saber and activated his power, ready to kill the other party if something went wrong.</p><p>The spider lifted its hairy front legs, which looked hard as they were covered with something that looked like bones. Coupled with the fact that its front legs were sharp enough, such an attack would be equivalent to that cast by a Real Lake Realm Master.</p><p>The battle seemed imminent.</p><p>However, the spider suddenly froze, no longer able to bring down its front legs. Besides that, its mouth was initially squirming and making noise the moment it caught sight of Lu Ye, but now, it had stopped hissing altogether.</p><p>Additionally, its originally lively compound eyes turned dim as if they were covered with a layer of dust.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ye‚Äôs eyes became brighter than usual. If one looked intently, one could see some complicated patterns behind his eyes. The patterns came together and formed an abstruse picture.</p><p>It was Charm Divine Glyph!</p><p>It was unlike Sharp Edge and Protection. When they were activated using Spiritual Power, they were Glyphs, but when they were cast using Soul Power, they were Divine Glyphs.</p><p>On the other hand, Charm was a Divine Glyph that could only be activated using Soul Power.</p><p>Lu Ye acquired this Divine Glyph after he killed the Fox Mutant in Fox Immortal Valley and devoured her Core Flame.</p><p>Initially, Lu Ye thought that before he ascended to the Divine Ocean Realm, he would never be able to use this Divine Glyph. Much to his surprise, he arrived at the Lost City of Xianyuan again in such a unique state, which allowed him to activate his Soul Power.</p><p>After verifying the transformation of Sharp Edge, he had the urge to give Charm a try. A plan had already formed in his mind with this Divine Glyph as the core.</p><p>In Fox Immortal Valley, the Fox Mutant made use of her innate ability to enslave around 100 cultivators. Many of them were Ninth-Order Cloud River Realm Masters.</p><p>The effects of Charm were similar to those of Fox Mutant‚Äôs innate ability. It could be used to control a person‚Äôs mind, but it wasn‚Äôt as effective as the one used by the Fox Mutant.</p><p>One had to know that when Ju Jia met with the Fox Mutant‚Äôs eyes for the first time, he was immediately subjugated. The move the Fox Mutant used on Ju Jia back then was similar to the one Lu Ye used on the spider now.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
