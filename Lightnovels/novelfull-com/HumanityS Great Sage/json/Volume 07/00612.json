They shared the same opinion as Tu Guanxiong and strongly doubted that Lu Ye had killed Huo Liaoyuan with his strength alone. After all, the gap between Lu Ye’s cultivation and Huo Liaoyuan’s cultivation could not be denied. Regardless of Lu Ye’s impressive heritage, it was impossible for him to achieve something so outrageous.</p><p>Besides, they had some understanding of Lu Ye’s real strength. Even if his cultivation had improved by two Minor Realms compared to when he was in the Carnage Colosseum, he was ultimately just a Fifth Order Realm Master.</p><p>“Considering Huo Liaoyuan had an Exotic Treasure like the Deathmatch Platform, it’s not far-fetched to believe that Lu Yi Ye possessed some sort of Exotic Treasure too. Huo Liaoyuan certainly suffered an unjust death!” Tan Sheng sighed sadly. At the same time, he could not shake off the lingering fear in his heart.</p><p>There was no doubt that Tan Sheng was stronger than Huo Liaoyuan, but the difference in strength was marginal. If Lu Ye had the ability to kill Huo Liaoyuan, then he also had the ability to kill Tan Sheng.</p><p>However, Exotic Treasures were basically disposable consumables that were extremely difficult to acquire. Since Lu Ye had used his Exotic Treasure on Huo Liaoyuan, it could be said that Huo Liaoyuan had taken the fall in their place. Otherwise, either Tan Sheng or Xia Liang would have been sacrificed instead. In a way, they had to thank Huo Liaoyuan for his sacrifice.</p><p>“Huo Liaoyuan’s death does not deserve pity. But, in this way…” Xia Liang turned and glanced in the direction of the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade cultivators.</p><p>There seemed to be an invisible cloud of gloom looming over the heads of the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade cultivators. Every one of them was in low spirits.</p><p>Tan Sheng and Xia Liang originally planned to borrow the strength of the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade to overcome the various traps and defenses in Lu Ye’s Arcane Glade. In the end, things didn’t work out as they planned. The Sacred Universe Arcane Glade had suffered enormous losses. On the other hand, Lu Ye only suffered slight damage to several Wards and lost several Wolf Mutants. The losses he sustained were practically negligible in comparison.</p><p>Xia Liang couldn’t help feeling annoyed. [Huo Liaoyuan, this bastard… How can he be so useless?]</p><p>“Are they leaving?” Tan Sheng abruptly noticed something unusual. The Sacred Universe Arcane Glade cultivators seemed to be preparing to evacuate the place.</p><p>Xia Liang frowned and stepped forward to stop Ming Zhe, then he questioned, “Junior Brother, where are you going?”</p><p>Ming Zhe glanced at Xia Liang, his eyes burning with flames of fury. These two were the ones who ultimately caused the deaths of Huo Liaoyuan and so many Juniors! Fortunately, he knew that he could not afford to offend them. Suppressing his rage, he faintly replied, “Naturally, we are leaving this place!”</p><p>They did not wish to leave, but they might be ambushed again during the night if they remained there. Several of their companions died last night, and that was with Huo Liaoyuan’s protection. Now that Huo Liaoyuan was gone, how could they dare to remain there?</p><p>Ming Zhe was an Eight Order Cloud River Realm Master. Tu Guanxiong had ordered him to act according to the situation. Needless to say, he had some opinions of his own. He believed that this was a dangerous place, so they should not remain there for long.</p><p>Xia Liang scowled. “Are you leaving just like that?”</p><p>Ming Zhe’s eyes were bloodshot. He gritted his teeth and snapped, “What are you trying to say, Senior Brother Xia?”</p><p>Xia Liang righteously replied, “With such a deep hatred, it is only natural to take revenge.”</p><p>[If the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade cultivators leave this place, then my plans will fall apart!]</p><p>Ming Zhe gave Xia Liang a sideways glance, then he glanced at Tan Sheng nearby. “Senior Brothers, please teach me. How do I take revenge? How do I retaliate against my enemy? Are you willing to lead our defeated troops into battle? If you are willing to lead the way by example, then the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade will obey your orders!”</p><p>Xia Liang was speechless for a moment.</p><p>Although the number of remaining troops was not small, they did not have enough strength to invade Lu Ye’s Arcane Glade unless they could resolve the issue with the wolf pack first. Ꞧ</p><p>Ming Zhe hated the information they brought to the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade, but he hated their blatant attitude of wanting to take advantage of the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade even more. Refusing to speak further, he clasped his fists together to excuse himself and ushered the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade cultivators onto the Spirit Boat.</p><p>A short while later, the Spirit Boat rose into the air and departed.</p><p>Two days ago, they had arrived in a mighty procession of over hundred and fifty people. In the span of two days, not only had their leader, Huo Liaoyuan, died in battle but also only half of the hundred and fifty people survived. What happened during the past two days was a nightmare for everybody involved.</p><p>They withdrew from the Grand Wilds Peak and stopped at the edges of the Grand Wilds Peak.</p><p>Seeing as Tu Guanxiong planned to spread the news of Lu Ye’s whereabouts to the public, it was foreseeable that the Grand Wilds Peak would soon become very lively. They might not have the strength to exact revenge with their own hands, but they wanted to witness Lu Ye’s death to relieve some of the hatred in their hearts.</p><p>The Sacred Universe Arcane Glade cultivators retreated under Ming Zhe’s leadership. However, Xia Liang and Tan Sheng did not leave. Standing at the entrance of the Ameliorate Valley, they gazed in the direction of the Arcane Glade in silence.</p><p>A long time passed before Tan Sheng finally asked, “Brother Xia, what are your plans now?”</p><p>Xia Liang explained, “I’m considering whether to completely expose Lu Ye’s information to the public.”</p><p>Tan Sheng said, “He has the Divine Opportunity Column. If something goes wrong, he will surely escape to Jiu Zhou. So, we won’t be able to harm him even if we expose his whereabouts. We will only make him lose an Arcane Glade at most.”</p><p>“Of course, I know that. But, we can’t let him walk free just because we have no means to harm him. He will have to return to the Cloud River Battlefield for cultivation eventually. If we destroy his Arcane Glade now, then we will have a chance to kill him next time. If we do nothing, then we will never get a chance to kill him. Besides, Huo Liaoyuan had a Deathmatch Platform. What’s to say nobody else will? The possibility of killing him might not necessarily be nil.”</p><p>Despite knowing that the possibility was very slim, Tan Sheng echoed the sentiment. “That’s true.”</p><p>The reason Xia Liang and Tan Sheng only disclosed Lu Ye’s information to the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade was that they were afraid the persecution might be too severe otherwise. If that were to happen and Lu Ye fled back to Jiu Zhou via the Divine Opportunity Column, then their schemes would have been in vain.</p><p>On the other hand, Lu Ye would not be pushed to desperation if the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade were the only ones to attack the Arcane Glade. They were hoping that their plan would give them the opportunity to exploit the situation when both Lu Ye and the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade cultivators were injured from fighting each other. In the end, the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade had proven to be useless. Not only were they completely defeated in just two days, but the leader of the operation, Huo Liaoyuan, also died in the battle.</p><p>In this situation, it was impossible for Xia Liang and Tan Sheng to kill Lu Ye. All they could do now was force Lu Ye to abandon his Arcane Glade and hope for a better opportunity to kill him in the future.</p><p>Having made up his mind, Xia Liang was about to send the message out when Tan Sheng unexpectedly received a message. Tan Sheng finished checking the message and communicated with the other party for a short while. Then, he exclaimed in surprise, “Brother Xia, somebody has taken action before us!”</p><p>“What?” Xia Liang was puzzled.</p><p>“Somebody has already leaked Lu Yi Ye’s location to the public.”</p><p>The information that Tan Sheng received was a message from a Junior in his Sect, telling him about Lu Ye’s current location. However, it should have been impossible for his Junior to learn about such information out of nowhere. After making some inquiries, he found out that this information was already known to the public.</p><p>“It’s the work of the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade!” Xia Liang immediately realized the truth.</p><p>The only people who knew Lu Ye’s location were Xia Liang, Tan Sheng, and the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade. Just as they had decided on their course of action, it turned out that somebody else had already taken action before them. There could be no other possible candidate except for the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade.</p><p>Xia Liang did not know who was currently making the decisions for the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade, but he understood the reasoning behind the other party’s decision. In any case, he was saved the trouble of doing the task himself.</p><p>“Grand Wilds Peak is about to get lively.” Xia Liang sighed. “Let’s go!”</p><p>Tan Sheng was astonished. “Brother Xia, are we leaving?”</p><p>Xia Liang retorted, “Why should we stay here? Do you want to watch Lu Yi Ye escaping back to Jiu Zhou?”</p><p>Tan Sheng understood after pondering for a moment. Based on the development of the current situation, it would not take long before Lu Ye fell into a desperate situation. He would eventually be forced to escape to Jiu Zhou via the Divine Opportunity Column, leaving all the cultivators who rushed over to attack him.</p><p>Therefore, it was meaningless to remain here at this point. What they currently needed to do was wait for Lu Ye to enter the Cloud River Battlefield once more. Then, they could monitor his movements in secret and find an opportunity to kill him!</p><p>Inside the Arcane Glade, Lu Ye quietly recuperated from his wounds. The advantage of having a tough physique was revealed at this moment. Ordinary cultivators would have taken ten to fifteen days to recover from his level of injuries, but it only took him one or two days to recover from most of his injuries.</p><p>At the same time, the news that Lu Ye was hiding in the Ameliorate Valley at the Grand Wilds Peak spread like wildfire with the help of Tu Guanxiong’s efforts to publicize the matter.</p><p>The major Sects in the Thousand Demon Ridge had further increased the bounty on his head After the incident at the Carnage Colosseum, which motivated countless Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators into taking action.</p><p>During this period of time, many people had secretly been paying attention to his whereabouts. However, nobody expected him to not only hide in the depths of the Grand Wilds Peak but also use a Grand Ward to hide his presence. Even the cultivators who occasionally passed through the area had failed to notice the presence of the Arcane Glade.</p><p>In Xia Liang and Tan Sheng’s case, they had only barely managed to discover Lu Ye’s general location with the help of an Exotic Treasure. Unfortunately, they ended up fleeing in embarrassment after suffering casualties of one dead and two injured.</p><p>With the news spreading among the public, the cultivators who had been searching hard for Lu Ye’s whereabouts immediately reacted like cats drawn to the smell of fish and rushed toward the Grand Wilds Peak from all directions.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the undercurrent in the Cloud River Battlefield was surging with excitement.</p><p>Lu Ye fully recovered from his injuries two days after killing Huo Liaoyuan.</p><p>At this moment, the four people in the Arcane Glade sat inside the wooden hut.</p><p>Li Baxian reported, “The Sacred Universe Arcane Glade has probably withdrawn from the Arcane Glade. I have not seen them in the past two days. Junior Brother Ju Jia also ordered the Wolf Mutants to search the surroundings, but they did not encounter anybody either. Even Xia Liang and Tan Sheng were gone.”</p><p>“That’s within my expectations.” Lu Ye nodded.</p><p>In addition to the heavy losses of the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade, they also had to guard against Lu Ye’s secret ambush. Naturally, they would not choose to remain here and wait for their deaths to come. As for Xia Liang and Tan Sheng… It was meaningless for them to remain alone in this place once the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade departed.</p><p>“Senior Brother, I’m afraid there’s a high probability that we will lose possession of the Arcane Glade.”</p><p>First, it was Xia Liang and the others joining hands to attack him. Now that the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade was aware of this place, the location of the Arcane Glade was completely exposed. More and more people were bound to learn about the location of the Arcane Glade with the passage of time.</p><p>Lu Ye discovered that he seemed to have poor compatibility with the Arcane Glade…</p><p>When he first entered the Cloud River Battlefield, he had a stroke of luck and obtained a Tertius-level Arcane Glade. In the end, the Arcane Glade was invaded and the Wisp of Sanctification was stolen when he entered the Myriad Beast Domain’s Hidden Realms with Kitty Shen. He later obtained the top place in the Carnage Colosseum’s Roster of Carnage through great effort and received a Primus-level Wisp of Sanctification as a reward. With great deliberation, he placed the Arcane Glade deep in the Grand Wilds Peak and gathered the wolf pack for protection. He did not expect to encounter such a tragedy so soon.</p><p>There were times when he truly wondered whether the so-called Heaven’s Favour actually existed. If the so-called Heaven’s Favour actually existed, then why was he so unlucky sometimes?</p><p>On the other hand, there were times when he certainly felt as though he was blessed with great luck. Take his encounter at the Fox Immortal Valley for example. The Fox Mutant had been dominating the Fox Immortal Valley for nearly twenty years, but she happened to meet a person like him who could restrain her ability. In the end, he had slaughtered the Fox Mutant and rescued many people. He was also rewarded by the Heavens, which greatly boosted his heritage.</p><p>Matters involving luck were truly puzzling indeed.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
