As for how long that would be, Lu Ye wasn‚Äôt sure.</p><p>Although it was safe to stay in this building, it wasn‚Äôt like he could stay here for a long time.</p><p>After giving it some thought, he whipped out a jade bottle from his Storage Sphere.</p><p>The jade bottle contained the last bit of Soul Cleansing Water he had, and there were roughly ten drops of it. He had reserved it for emergencies, but he had no choice but to use it in such a situation.</p><p>After opening the lid, he caught a whiff of the Soul Cleansing Water‚Äôs unique fragrance, which helped energize him in an instant, and the sense of lethargy that had been bugging him subsided significantly.</p><p>This made him certain that the Soul Cleansing Water was the best remedy to his current predicament.</p><p>He didn‚Äôt dare to take a lot of it, reckoning that one drop might be sufficient. A sense of gentleness swept over him, and his lethargy dissipated rapidly. Even his wounds healed in no time.</p><p>As expected, the Soul Cleansing Water was immensely useful in treating his injuries.</p><p>He remained seated with peace of mind for the next two hours. It wasn‚Äôt until he fully recovered that he rose to his feet.</p><p>Then, he walked up to the door and looked out through the gap.</p><p>The insectoids that had hunted him down were nowhere to be seen. Only several insectoids were roaming around aimlessly, and they posed no threat to him, considering that he had recovered.</p><p>Since he had to head to the City Lord‚Äôs Mansion, the most pressing issue for him was to find out his current location.</p><p>But before that, there was something he needed to verify.</p><p>He already detected an anomaly when fighting the insectoids a while ago, but he didn‚Äôt have time to verify it, given the fact that he was in danger.</p><p>Now, with such a unique building as a shelter, he could be assured that he could always come back whenever he came across any danger. Therefore, he wanted to know if the anomaly he had detected was just as he had expected.</p><p>If it was a yes, he might be able to use moves that he usually couldn‚Äôt.</p><p>After taking a look at his Battlefield Imprint, he realized that he now had over 3,000 battle points.</p><p>The number was neither big nor small. One had to know that he had killed a lot of insectoids, and many of them were in the Real Lake Realm.</p><p>Now, it seemed that the calculation of battle points was on the basis that he was a Real Lake Realm Master. As such, even though he had killed insectoids in the Real Lake Realm, he wouldn‚Äôt get a lot of battle points.</p><p>This was slightly disappointing. If the calculation of battle points was on the basis that he was a Fifth-Order Cloud River Realm Master, the battle points he had acquired from the previous battle would‚Äôve multiplied.</p><p>After giving it some thought, he felt that he should be grateful, considering that it came as a surprise that he could get some battle points in this place.</p><p>Although 3,000 battle points were not a lot, they could be traded for two Blue Amulets. Moreover, it was only the beginning. If his plan could be executed, he would obtain even more battle points soon. Perhaps after this trip, he would have enough battle points to trade for many Golden Amulets, which would help significantly increase his power.</p><p>After opening the door, he immediately activated Glyphs that could curb his aura and conceal his presence.</p><p>The slight noise alerted the insectoids, but when they turned around and saw nothing, they soon lost interest and kept roaming around.</p><p>Insectoids came in different shapes and forms. Some of them looked just like Spirit Beasts, but they were definitely not Spirit Beasts.</p><p>There were also some insectoids that looked unique, and it was against the impression of what people had about what insectoids should look like.</p><p>Having said that, all of them had the same characteristic without exception, which was the fact that they were covered in the carapace, and their blood was emerald green. ùò≥ùò¢êåΩ√≥ùêõ–Å≈ù</p><p>The stronger the insectoids, the more robust their carapace was. Therefore, killing insectoids required skills as one needed to attack areas where there was no protection, thus causing severe damage to the insectoids.</p><p>Lu Ye had repeatedly entered the Rift of Illusions to get some training, so he was fully aware of the weaknesses of different insectoids.</p><p>His target this time was an insectoid that looked like a centipede. Its back was covered with pieces of white carapace, looking like a long stretch of white bones. It was crawling forward with over a hundred pairs of legs, making some rustling noise.</p><p>The thing that Lu Ye wanted to verify wasn‚Äôt complicated. However, to ensure the accuracy of the outcome, he didn‚Äôt immediately launch an attack. Instead, he was merely observing it in silence.</p><p>A moment later, the centipede stopped in its tracks and twisted its body into a coil in the ruins before it stayed unmoving.</p><p>Lu Ye stealthily approached the centipede. It wasn‚Äôt until he was only nine meters away from the insectoid that he stopped.</p><p>The serenity was shattered all of a sudden. The moment Lu Ye‚Äôs power fluctuated around him, the centipede realized it was in danger, but before it could react, the space in front of Lu Ye contorted. The next moment, a thing that looked like an arrow shot forward and crashed into the centipede‚Äôs head before vanishing into thin air.</p><p>The centipede was instantly injured, its 30-meter-long figure writhing about as it hissed in pain.</p><p>Lu Ye revealed himself and unsheathed his Inviolable Saber before slashing his weapon across the centipede while the insectoid was struggling.</p><p>Green blood spurted out as its huge head was sent flying away. An insectoid as powerful as a Real Lake Realm Master was killed just like that.</p><p>Lu Ye remained calm and collected, though there was a hint of joy behind his gaze. That was because he realized the thing he had detected was real, not an illusion.</p><p>When he was running for his life and contending with the insectoids a while ago, he blessed his Inviolable Saber with Sharp Edge. At that time, he was troubled by a strange feeling, for Sharp Edge was slightly different from usual.</p><p>In the past, he had to bless a Spirit Artifact with Sharp Edge to make it sharper.</p><p>Certainly, he could also bless other things with the Glyph, but all in all, it needed a medium to take effect.</p><p>Nonetheless, when he used Sharp Edge in the Lost City of Xianyuan, there didn‚Äôt seem to be a need for a medium.</p><p>At that moment, Lu Ye realized that if a Glyph was constructed using Spiritual Power, it was nothing more than a Glyph. However, apart from Spiritual Power, he could also activate Soul Power now.</p><p>Moreover, the Glyphs that were constructed using Soul Power were called Divine Glyphs.</p><p>Therefore, Sharp Edge didn‚Äôt need a medium. That was because a Divine Glyph built with Soul Power was already a form of means that could be used to kill enemies directly.</p><p>That was what Lu Ye wanted to verify.</p><p>It turned out that his speculation was right. In such an environment, the Divine Glyphs he weaved using Soul Power could directly kill his enemies.</p><p>The arrow that had appeared momentarily earlier was the manifestation of Sharp Edge Divine Glyph.</p><p>Furthermore, unlike using Inviolable Saber, attacking the insectoids using Divine Glyphs was especially lethal, for they were fundamentally attacks on the soul. The problem with insectoids was that they had low sentience. As such, they were practically defenseless against attacks on the soul.</p><p>When the arrow transformed from Sharp Edge penetrated the centipede‚Äôs mind, it caused immense damage to its weak sentience. The sudden impact made its mind split apart.</p><p>The thick carapace around its figure provided no protection against such an invisible attack.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, even if Lu Ye could kill the centipede, it would take him some effort. Nonetheless, with the help of Sharp Edge, he could do so with only one move.</p><p>When his speculation was proven to be true, he was ecstatic.</p><p>In such an environment, the attacks using Divine Glyphs would yield amazing results. If he had known this earlier, he wouldn‚Äôt have ended up in a battered state.</p><p>Nonetheless, before getting any confirmation, he would never dare to act recklessly. He was running for his life at that time, so any negligence would cost him his life.</p><p>At the end of the day, he was only a Fifth-Order Cloud River Realm Master. Even though his power was in the Real Lake Realm now, he was still far from having the ability to use Soul Power, which was exclusive to the Divine Ocean Realm Masters.</p><p>But in such a unique environment, Lu Ye had grasped the power that only the Divine Ocean Realm Masters could use in advance.</p><p>He couldn‚Äôt help but recall what Lady Yun had said to him before.</p><p>There existed Glyph Warlocks in this world. Although it was already difficult to deal with them before they even ascended to the Divine Ocean Realm, their forte lay in their myriad combat styles. During a battle, they could activate different types of Glyphs and make their opponents go through the most horrible experiences in the world.</p><p>When they ascended to the Divine Ocean Realm, it was more than just difficult to deal with them. Most of the time, their opponents had passed away before they even understood why.</p><p>Simply put, a Glyph Warlock in the Divine Ocean Realm could be more powerful and intimidating than an average Divine Ocean Realm Master.</p><p>The reason was that Glyph Warlocks in the Divine Ocean Realm were able to use Divine Glyphs to attack the opponents‚Äô souls.</p><p>Although other Divine Ocean Realm Masters could do that as well, they were not as skilful as the Glyph Warlocks.</p><p>The Sharp Edge Divine Glyph constructed using Soul Power had caused immense damage. The noise over here had attracted the attention of nearby insectoids as they streamed toward this place.</p><p>With the Inviolable Saber in his hand, Lu Ye charged toward the insectoid nearest to him. While he was at it, he activated Sharp Edge again, causing the space to contort. An arrow shot forward, and before the insectoid could come near Lu Ye, it collapsed to the ground and hissed in pain.</p><p>When Lu Ye arrived, the insectoid was still oblivious to the imminent danger. He lifted his Inviolable Saber and killed another insectoid just like that.</p><p>Not all Glyphs could be activated using Soul Power. One could do that with Sharp Edge and Protection. The former could be used to attack the soul, and the latter could be turned into Soul Power Shield to fend off attacks on his soul.</p><p>Nonetheless, for Glyphs like Radiance, Bloodrage, and Windwalk, there wouldn‚Äôt be special effects even if they were activated using Soul Power.</p><p>On the other hand, Glyphs like Gravity Well, Burster, and Illusion could be turned into Divine Glyphs, and their effects would be different too.</p><p>Gravity Well could make insectoids feel immensely pressured. Just like Sharp Edge, Burster could cause tremendous damage to the insectoids‚Äô souls.</p><p>Illusion Divine Glyph wasn‚Äôt lethal, but it could make the insectoids fall into an illusory realm momentarily.</p><p>As Lu Ye walked along the streets, he went on to activate different types of Divine Glyphs to find out their uses. As a result, the insectoids lost their lives one by one.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
