As such, even though the outcome of the battle in the mine was horrifying, their zest and determination to look for Lu Ye never died.</p><p>Moreover, they believed that following the battle, even if Lu Ye wasn’t dead, there was no way he was fine. Therefore, he supposedly wasn’t able to run to a faraway place; he should be hiding somewhere near the mine.</p><p>Certainly, they were wary of the potent poison he had used before, but a poison that could kill 2,000 people must be costly, so he probably no longer had it. Even if he still had the poison, it was fine as long as they refrained from staying in a sealed space like the mine.</p><p>It could be said that after the battle in the mine, their hostility against Lu Ye had intensified instead of subsiding.</p><p>In a teahouse directly facing the Divine Trade Association in the City of Heavens E56, there was a cultivator patiently waiting on the second floor.</p><p>A moment later, two people approached him and sat down across from him.</p><p>They were a man and a woman, both very good-looking, and it could be said that they seemed like a perfect couple. There was a mark that looked like a burning flame on their foreheads.</p><p>In the entire Jiu Zhou, only a great force had such a conspicuous mark.</p><p>Cult Blackfyre!</p><p>The cultivator, who had been waiting for them, quickly got up and saluted them. “Senior Brother Chu, Senior Sister Zhou.”</p><p>Chu Yun nodded and shifted his attention to the Divine Trade Association before asking, “Are you sure it was Lu Yi Ye?”</p><p>The cultivator replied, “I didn’t manage to see his face as he was wearing a ghost-motif face mask, but his figure was identical to Lu Yi Ye’s, and he had a huge package over his shoulder.”</p><p>Zhou Pei asked softly, “Lu Yi Ye has a white little beast with him. Did you see it?”</p><p>“I didn’t see it, no.” That was what puzzled the cultivator. Everyone knew that Lu Ye always had a white little beast with him, but the cultivator didn’t see such an animal that day, so he wasn’t sure if the person was indeed Lu Ye. However, he still spread the news as an act of caution.</p><p>Two Ninth-Order Cloud River Realm Masters had arrived at the teahouse in response to the news, which went to show that Cult Blackfyre prioritized the matter.</p><p>After all, Huo Liaoyuan was killed by Lu Ye, and there was an irresolvable blood feud between Cult Blackfyre and Crimson Blood Sect in the first place. There was no doubt that among the Sects in Thousand Demon Ridge, they were the most eager to destroy the Crimson Blood Sect. Ṙã𝐍Ｏ𝐁Ёᶊ</p><p>The two of them had arrived from the main Sect in Jiu Zhou. Huo Liaoyuan was killed, and many of the Sect members were injured. Certainly, those of Cult Blackfyre had to get their revenge. As such, the duo rushed to the teahouse upon getting the news, but they were surprised to hear such an answer.</p><p>Chu Yun looked in the Divine Trade Association’s direction and tapped on the table before saying slowly, “Lu Yi Ye must have been injured when he fled the mine, and he certainly had to find a place to recuperate. There’s no doubt the Divine Trade Association is a good option.”</p><p>Zhou Pei asked, “Senior Brother, do you think it was Lu Yi Ye?”</p><p>“Yes, I think so.”</p><p>“But Junior Brother didn’t see the white little beast.”</p><p>“A while back, a Secret Technique that was a game changer for the Beastmasters appeared in the Vault of Providence, and there was a new thing called Spirit Beast Bag. It seems that they had found the items in a Hidden Realm. A Spirit Beast Bag can be used to keep Spirit Beasts.”</p><p>It wasn’t exactly a secret. In Jiu Zhou now, many Beastmasters could buy the Secret Technique as long as they had enough Contribution, but no one had yet to fully activate the Secret Technique’s power.</p><p>Upon hearing his explanation, Zhou Pei asked, “Do you think he has a Spirit Beast Bag, Senior Brother?”</p><p>“Even though a Spirit Beast Bag is rare and expensive, I believe Lu Yi Ye can afford to buy it. As for the huge package… Don’t forget about the 2,000 cultivators who lost their lives in the mine. Lu Yi Ye took all the Storage Bags before he left.”</p><p>“So, the package was filled with Storage Bags!”</p><p>In fact, Lu Ye attracted a lot of attention when he entered the Divine Trade Association that day. After all, cultivators were usually equipped with Storage Bags, so no one would lug a package with them, let alone a huge one.</p><p>As such, even though he had only stayed on the first floor of the Divine Trade Association for a short time, he had drawn a lot of attention.</p><p>They didn’t think too deeply about it at first, but as time passed, some people realized what had happened.</p><p>Chu Yun and his fellow Sect members weren’t the only ones monitoring the Divine Trade Association. On the second floor of this teahouse alone, several eyes were secretly watching the building across from them as well.</p><p>Lu Ye had thought about the possibility of him getting exposed because of the huge package, but he had no other choice unless he was willing to give up the loot.</p><p>If there were only 100 to 200 bags, he would’ve thrown them away, but he didn’t have the heart to do so since there were over several thousand of them.</p><p>“We can confirm it was Lu Yi Ye, then,” Chu Yun remarked.</p><p>“No conflicts are allowed in the Divine Trade Association, so there’s nothing we can do when he’s hiding inside.”</p><p>“It’s not like he can stay inside forever.” As Chu Yun spoke, he looked around and happened to see a familiar face glancing at him. As their eyes met, they nodded in silence, knowing each other’s intentions for staying in this place.</p><p>Presently, most of the cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge were searching around for Lu Ye’s whereabouts, but some had gotten wind of such unconfirmed news and gathered in the City of Heavens E56. They were scattered around, watching the entrance of the Divine Trade Association from different directions.</p><p>The cultivators who had been staying in the city for a long time noticed something was off recently as many powerful cultivators had arrived at this place.</p><p>In one of the rooms of the Divine Trade Association, Lu Ye continued to open the Restraining Locks of the Storage Bags while Yi Yi sorted out any useful items.</p><p>Regardless of how efficient Lu Ye was in unlocking the bags, it would take him seven to eight days to open all 5,000 Storage Bags.</p><p>That left the cultivators waiting outside the Divine Trade Association feeling helpless.</p><p>No one was certain if Lu Ye had indeed entered the Divine Trade Association, so it remained to be speculation. They had sent some people to look around in the Association, but they couldn’t find the man.</p><p>As time passed, Lu Ye was still nowhere to be seen, which made some people doubtful.</p><p>Was Lu Yi Ye even inside the Divine Trade Association?</p><p>If he wasn’t, it would be a waste of time for them to keep waiting. Even if he was inside, no one knew when he would come out.</p><p>It was costly to have a room in the Divine Trade Association, but the accommodation fees were nothing to someone like Lu Ye, who even had enough money to use the Divine Opportunity Columns twice.</p><p>If he decided to stay in the Divine Trade Association for six months to a year, would they still wait for him?</p><p>Many people were fidgety at the thought of this, but there was nothing they could do about it.</p><p>In the room, Lu Ye was still working hard on opening the Restraining Locks. Fortunately for him, he had dealt with half of the Storage Bags already.</p><p>He hadn’t found anything special, though. Most of the items in the bags were Spirit Pills, Spirit Stones, Spirit Artifacts, and Spirit Talisman Papers. There were even more miscellaneous items like ores and herbs.</p><p>Despite the myriad of items, they were worth a lot of money.</p><p>Lu Ye had very few Spirit Pills left, so his reserve of such items had been replenished.</p><p>What was worth mentioning was that he had also collected a lot of Mutant Cores, which could serve as Amber’s food. Ever since the tiger had a taste of Mutant Cores, it had never wanted Spirit Pills again. After all, consuming Mutant Cores could help with the growth of its power faster.</p><p>To Lu Ye, the only good news was that even though he never stopped opening the Restraining Locks, he could still cultivate at the same time.</p><p>Gluttonous Feast was continuously running, so he only had to consume some Spirit Pills from time to time. Although the Spiritual Qi in the room wasn’t as thick as that in the Arcane Glade, it wouldn’t affect his cultivation session.</p><p>A while back, he contacted Li Baxian and learned that everything was fine in Ameliorate Valley. Ju Jia had found the pack of wolves, and those of Thousand Demon Ridge didn’t have the guts to harass them again. As such, they could cultivate their powers with peace of mind.</p><p>The good news set Lu Ye’s mind at ease.</p><p>Although he had left behind a threat before leaving Ameliorate Valley, he wasn’t entirely sure if it would be useful, especially after the battle in the mine. Some people who were blinded by fury might go to the Arcane Glade and find fault with them.</p><p>Now, it seemed that his threat was intimidating enough, after all. Before his death, no one would have the audacity to attack Ameliorate Arcane Glade.</p><p>As for his threat about going back to the Spirit Creek Battlefield to destroy the Outpost of Rainbow Temple when killing Song Zhui, he didn’t really mean it, so he naturally wouldn’t do such a thing.</p><p>He merely detested how resolute Song Zhui looked at that time. It was those of Thousand Demon Ridge who kept finding fault with him, and he had never taken the initiative to provoke them as he only wanted to cultivate in the Arcane Glade peacefully. In the end, they made him look like he was an incredibly evil person.</p><p>He just wanted to intimidate Song Zhui before his death.</p><p>His words proved to be useful, after all. The determined Song Zhui was killed with his heart full of resentment. Lu Ye had successfully unnerved him before his demise.</p><p>“Lu Ye! Lu Ye!” Yi Yi suddenly shouted, bringing Lu Ye back to reality from his messy thoughts.</p><p>He turned his head and saw Yi Yi holding an item as she said in amazement, “Look at what it is!”</p><p>Upon making out what the item was, he fell into a dazed state.</p><p>The Storage Bag in his hands suddenly buzzed and detonated, turning into ashes in an instant.</p><p>He had carelessly exerted more force on his hands, which triggered the restriction in the Restraining Lock.</p><p>After the Storage Bag exploded, the things inside had also been destroyed. Lu Ye didn’t mind it as it was only a Storage Bag.</p><p>His interest was piqued as he took the thing from Yi Yi’s hand. “Where did you find it?”</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
