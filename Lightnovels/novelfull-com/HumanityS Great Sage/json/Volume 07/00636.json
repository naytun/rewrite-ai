As such, even though only those of Thousand Demon Ridge were aware of the incident initially, everyone soon got wind of it in just half a day.</p><p>The news had sent a shock wave across Cloud River Battlefield and Jiu Zhou.</p><p>As time passed, even more details were revealed.</p><p>It wasn‚Äôt a coincidence that 2,000 cultivators gathered together; they were trying to hunt down Lu Ye of the Crimson Blood Sect. Before that, they got wind that Lu Ye was badly injured and that he was hiding in a mine to recuperate. They initially believed they could destroy him easily, but for some reason, all of them ended up losing their lives instead.</p><p>Judging from the traces left behind in the mine, most of the cultivators were killed by poison. Even those who were injured had been struck with poison as well.</p><p>In other words, Lu Ye had acquired a kind of potent poison from somewhere and used it in that sealed space. Since the passageway had been blocked, the cultivators were unable to flee, and they eventually went to Hell.</p><p>In fact, the news had already been spread before Xia Liang and Tan Sheng entered the mine to look into the matter.</p><p>Cultivators like Ming Zhe of Sacred Universe Arcane Glade had sent a message to their fellow Sect members to inform them about what was going on in the mine.</p><p>Coupled with the information they had extracted from the traces in the mine, everyone could imagine how despondent those 2,000 people were at that time.</p><p>As the poison spread, 2,000 people were trapped in the sealed space, slowly losing the strength to resist. The weaker cultivators were killed by the poison while the stronger ones were destroyed by Lu Ye, leading to the living hell they witnessed.</p><p>It was Lu Ye again!</p><p>When he was still a Spirit Creek Realm Master, he had kicked up a storm on the Spirit Creek Battlefield, which alerted the Divine Ocean Realm Masters. The situation had gotten worse after he ascended to the Ninth Order where he dominated everyone else on the Spirit Creek Battlefield.</p><p>After he became a Cloud River Realm Master, they could finally enjoy some peaceful time. Only a storm was caused when the Carnage Colosseum opened up previously.</p><p>However, that storm was nothing compared to the disaster this time.</p><p>It was strange and terrifying that one person could kill all 2,000 cultivators.</p><p>Many doubts arose as the news spread.</p><p>Where did Lu Ye obtain such potent poison? In fact, there were many sorts of poison in Jiu Zhou that could kill Cloud River Realm Masters, but only some could destroy so many people at once. Moreover, an average Cloud River Realm Master didn‚Äôt have access to those things, for they were not sold in the Vault of Providence. That was because such poison could make the balance tilt, and the Vault of Providence was known for being impartial, which was why they would never sell such poison.</p><p>Also, since so many cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge had gone to Hell, was Lu Ye also dead?</p><p>Although the weaker cultivators were killed by poison, the stronger cultivators surely had the power to fight. Despite the fact that their powers had been weakened, Lu Ye couldn‚Äôt possibly deal with so many of them on his own.</p><p>Soon, they got their answer.</p><p>Lu Ye‚Äôs corpse wasn‚Äôt found in the mine.</p><p>In other words, he must be alive and kicking, but they didn‚Äôt know where he was.</p><p>Considering that he could build a Teleportation Ward, he must have made use of it to leave the mine after killing the cultivators. Furthermore, the Storage Bags of those cultivators were missing as well. ùîØ–ê≈ä·ªô–íƒö»ô</p><p>He had crossed the line by killing so many people while still having the time to pick up the loot.</p><p>Those of Thousand Demon Ridge were furious, and they started surrounding Grand Wilds Peak in an attempt to find Lu Ye and destroy him so that they could avenge their companions‚Äô deaths.</p><p>In the past, even though Lu Ye had repeatedly kicked up a storm and killed many of his opponents, he had never destroyed so many people at once.</p><p>It could be said to be the most outrageous incident in the history of Jiu Zhou.</p><p>Back then, they targeted Lu Ye because they were from opposing sides, and they were tempted by the huge reward to kill him. Nonetheless, it was different now. Lu Ye had killed many of their fellow Sect members, friends, and even relatives. Besides being opponents, they also had a blood feud with him now.</p><p>It could be said that following the battle in the mine, those of Thousand Demon Ridge had become more eager to destroy Lu Ye, and their resentment toward him had never been more intense.</p><p>Certainly, those of the Grand Sky Coalition wouldn‚Äôt sit back and do nothing as they headed to that area. They were not there to watch a good show. Since many people of Thousand Demon Ridge had gathered together, it was a good chance for some assassination attempts.</p><p>A storm was brewing in that area.</p><p>In the City of Heavens E56, the place was boisterous as the cultivators brushed past each other. A group of five people entered the city before heading to the Divine Trade Association.</p><p>They were not powerful, ranging between the Third Order and the Fifth Order. A group like this was common on the Cloud River Battlefield.</p><p>This group was where Gui Yingzi belonged, and Senior Brother Qin was the leader.</p><p>‚ÄúJunior Brother, it‚Äôs thanks to you that we‚Äôve managed to stay alive. Let‚Äôs go. I‚Äôll treat you to a meal. No one shall leave before getting drunk!‚Äù Senior Brother Qin clapped Gui Yingzi‚Äôs shoulder and guffawed.</p><p>All of them were still reeling from the shock when they recalled what had happened three days ago.</p><p>If not for Gui Yingzi‚Äôs dissuasion, they would‚Äôve entered the mine along with the other cultivators, and they would‚Äôve gone to Hell by now.</p><p>None of the 2,000 cultivators were alive, including a Ninth-Order Master like Song Zhui.</p><p>As such, Senior Brother Qin and his group would never have survived if they had also barged into the mine, considering how much weaker they were.</p><p>When they heard about what had happened in the mine, they felt like their lives had been saved, which made them admire Gui Yingzi for his instincts.</p><p>They had left that place early on. The reason they had even stayed there a while back was to wait for an outcome. Now that they had learned of the news that had shocked the entire Jiu Zhou, they no longer had to keep staying there.</p><p>As such, they rushed toward this city, ready to get some rest for a few days.</p><p>Senior Sister Hu stood beside Gui Yingzi and asked with a smile, ‚ÄúJunior Brother, why is your perception of danger so sensitive? Can you teach me something?‚Äù</p><p>Gui Yingzi shook his head and replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not trying to hide anything, but it seems to be an innate instinct that can‚Äôt be passed on to anyone. However, if all of you trust me, please keep something in mind.‚Äù</p><p>Hearing that, Senior Brother Qin and Senior Sister Hu sported solemn expressions.</p><p>Gui Yingzi continued seriously, ‚ÄúAnything to do with Lu Yi Ye must be a disaster. So, wherever he appears, regardless of how big the reward is, we must stay as far away from him as possible.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúIs he such a jinx?‚Äù Senior Sister Hu arched her brow.</p><p>Gui Yingzi sighed. ‚ÄúI was dragged into three incidents that had something to do with him, and every time, many cultivators lost their lives. This time is especially‚Ä¶‚Äù He caught himself and shuddered.</p><p>Senior Brother Qin nodded. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll keep that in mind. Wherever there‚Äôs Lu Yi Ye, we‚Äôll stay as far away from him as possible. It‚Äôs simple, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù</p><p>They then entered a nearby restaurant while chatting joyfully.</p><p>They were always on the go, so they rarely had a chance to pig out on food in such a place, nor were they willing to spend so much money to do so. Regardless, they had just dodged a disaster, so it would be fine to wind down and enjoy some delicious food.</p><p>In the same city, in a particular room on the third floor of Divine Trade Association, Lu Ye lay flat on the floor, looking like he was drained of all energy.</p><p>Amber crouched down and took a look at him before extending its paw into the Storage Bag hung over its neck. Then, the tiger took out a Mutant Core and munched on it.</p><p>Yi Yi was seated beside the man as she fished out the things from the Storage Bags and sorted them out. When she saw how lethargic Lu Ye looked, she said, ‚ÄúGet some rest if you‚Äôre tired.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm not tired!‚Äù Lu Ye leapt to his feet at once.</p><p>He had never expected that having too much loot was also a kind of trouble.</p><p>He had obtained many Storage Bags in the past, but the loot was especially tremendous this time.</p><p>There were a total of 2,000 cultivators, and each of them carried two to three Storage Bags or even more. Even though he hadn‚Äôt managed to pick up everything, he had brought back around 5,000 Storage Bags.</p><p>If these bags belonged to Spirit Creek Realm Masters, he could‚Äôve saved himself the trouble by selling them to the Divine Trade Association in a bundle, which would be some considerable income. Spirit Creek Realm Masters usually didn‚Äôt have any good stuff with them anyway.</p><p>However, the owners of these Storage Bags were Cloud River Realm Masters, so he couldn‚Äôt just sell them away without taking a proper look, for there might be some treasures inside.</p><p>As such, he had no choice but to open them one by one. Even though he was adept at unlocking Restraining Locks, he felt apathetic having to open so many bags.</p><p>Three days ago, he left the bloodied mine by making use of his Teleportation Ward. Then, he dragged his tired figure to this City of Heavens without any delay. That was because he knew that he would be in trouble if he didn‚Äôt act quickly. The cultivators who had lost their lives in the mine were only some of his opponents, so more people must be heading to the mine at that time.</p><p>If he didn‚Äôt flee as fast as he could, he would be besieged again.</p><p>If not for the staggering amount of loot, he could‚Äôve hidden in the wild by using some Glyphs to conceal his presence. However, with so much loot with him, it wouldn‚Äôt be realistic to do so. To him, staying in the Divine Trade Association would be the safest option.</p><p>He didn‚Äôt come across any enemies while on his way. After entering the place, he got a room and recuperated.</p><p>A day later, he finally recovered from his lethargy, after which Yi Yi urged him to unlock the Restraining Locks.</p><p>Nonetheless, the amount of Storage Bags was mind-numbing.</p><p>Looking at the pile of bags in front of him, Lu Ye felt like he would rather get into a life-and-death fight or a battle of wits with those of Thousand Demon Ridge.</p><p>With that said, it was some immense wealth. Regardless of how fidgety he was, he had no choice but to patiently open the Restraining Locks one by one.</p><p>On the other hand, Yi Yi was responsible for going through the things in the bags and sorting out any useful items.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
