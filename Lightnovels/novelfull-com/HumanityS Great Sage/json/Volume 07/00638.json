They looked identical, and it could be said that they were made from the same mould.</p><p>It was none other than a Mystic Fruit Seed!</p><p>The Mystic Fruit Seeds came from Mystic Fruits, which were Spirit Fruits found exclusively in the Chess Sea. The flesh could help a cultivator restore his Spiritual Power quickly, and the seeds had many different uses.</p><p>When Lu Ye was a Fifth-Order Spirit Creek Realm Master back then, he took Hua Ci to participate in the Battle Royale of the Legates. With their distinct abilities, they led the Legates of the different Sects of the Grand Sky Coalition to turn things around and occupy the central area of the Chess Sea, where there was a Mystic Fruit Tree that bore many Mystic Fruits.</p><p>Since Lu Ye and Hua Ci played a key role in the battle royale, one of the Mystic Fruits was given to Lu Ye, and the rest were sold.</p><p>He then passed the Mystic Fruit to Shui Yuan, who made some Mystic Fruit cider using the flesh. The cider had been fully consumed.</p><p>On the other hand, the Mystic Fruit Seed became Lu Ye‚Äôs key that allowed him to enter the Rift of Illusions, where he could get some training.</p><p>However, not all Mystic Fruit Seeds could help the cultivators go to the Rift of Illusions. After all, the seeds had distinct uses. Li Baxian once told him that someone from Thousand Demon Ridge had acquired a Mystic Fruit Seed that could significantly enhance the power of any ward. Therefore, on the Spirit Creek Battlefield, there was a particular Outpost of Thousand Demon Ridge that was impenetrable.</p><p>There were also Mystic Fruit Seeds that were basically useless, but they could be sold to the Vault of Providence for at least 100,000 Contribution Points for each seed.</p><p>Some seeds could increase the cultivators‚Äô intelligence and change their aptitudes if they carried the seeds long enough.</p><p>There were also some seeds that were connected to the veins of ores that were full of Spirit Stones.</p><p>All in all, no one could be certain about the uses of any one Mystic Fruit Seed until they activated it.</p><p>When Lu Ye heard about such information in the past, he found Mystic Fruit Seeds amazing, but he didn‚Äôt think too deeply about them.</p><p>As his power increased and his experience enriched, he gradually came to the realization that the myriad of uses found in the Mystic Fruit Seeds was most likely bestowed by the Heavens, not something they were born with.</p><p>Take the Mystic Fruit Seed in Lu Ye‚Äôs possession as an example. It was merely a key, and every time Lu Ye activated it, he would enter the Rift of Illusions where he could get some training without worries.</p><p>Lu Ye‚Äôs Blade Technique was improved through his life-and-death battles against the cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge, but it was also significantly strengthened through his experience in the Rift of Illusions. Every time, he would end up getting killed, thus remembering the vivid details of the invaluable lessons he had learned through sacrificing his life and body.</p><p>This time, it came as a surprise that he found a Mystic Fruit Seed in the loot. He had no idea who the previous owner was, though.</p><p>‚ÄúI found the seed in this Storage Bag.‚Äù Yi Yi showed him the bag in her hand. Lu Ye took a look but didn‚Äôt find anything special about it.</p><p>Most Storage Bags looked similar as there were no new designs. Some female cultivators might embroider some flower prints or other patterns on the bags, though. ·πûùí∂Œù∆ü‚Çøƒö≈ú</p><p>Certainly, some male cultivators might also carry such bags, which were given to them by the women who admired them.</p><p>There was nothing special about the Storage Bag in Yi Yi‚Äôs hand, so Lu Ye had no idea who the previous owner was.</p><p>There wasn‚Äôt a need to find out about it, though. Lu Ye was more curious about the use of the Mystic Fruit Seed he had inadvertently acquired.</p><p>At the thought of this, he lifted the Mystic Fruit Seed and infused his Spiritual Power into it, ready to look into what was inside.</p><p>Regardless of the use, the seed certainly wasn‚Äôt useless since the previous owner had been carrying it.</p><p>As his soul sank into the seed, his vision blurred. When he came to his senses, he realized he was in a sealed space with nothing else in sight. There was only a door with some words above it. ‚ÄòIf you wish to enter the Rift of Illusions, you have to spend 100 Contribution Points.‚Äô</p><p>Lu Ye frowned, thinking that he might have taken the wrong seed, for it was supposed to be the use of his own seed.</p><p>He didn‚Äôt push the door open, for once he did, he couldn‚Äôt come out unless he was killed.</p><p>Instead, he opened his eyes and picked up another Mystic Fruit Seed before infusing his Spiritual Power into it.</p><p>Just like what had happened earlier, he appeared in a sealed space the next moment with nothing in sight except for a door. The words above it read, ‚ÄòIf you wish to enter the Rift of Illusions, you have to spend 100 Contribution Points.‚Äô</p><p>Lu Ye looked dazedly at the door before his eyes.</p><p>He was now certain that he didn‚Äôt pick up the wrong seed. Both seeds had the same use, which was to allow him to enter the Rift of Illusions.</p><p>At that, he was torn between tears and laughter.</p><p>He initially thought he had acquired a wonderful item, but it turned out to have the same use as his own seed.</p><p>That brought up some unpleasant memories in his mind.</p><p>When he was a Spirit Creek Realm Master back then, he once entered the sealed space and came across a cultivator of Thousand Demon Ridge, who was so ruthless as to kill him repeatedly.</p><p>Since then, he had been vigilant every time he activated the Mystic Fruit Seed, worried that he might bump into the same person.</p><p>At that time, he speculated that the other party had a Mystic Fruit Seed with the same use. However, he hadn‚Äôt obtained the Gift of Providence back then, and the person was shrouded in a thick fog, so he couldn‚Äôt make out his appearance. He was only certain that the person was from Thousand Demon Ridge and that the latter was more powerful than he was.</p><p>They came across each other in the sealed space because they activated their respective Mystic Fruit Seeds at the same time. It was a small chance, so Lu Ye had only bumped into that person once.</p><p>After getting killed several times, he swore that he would get his revenge one day.</p><p>As such, he wondered if the previous owner of the seed was the cultivator he had met by chance in the sealed space in the past.</p><p>In that case, it would be a coincidence.</p><p>Having said that, Lu Ye wasn‚Äôt surprised that such a thing happened to him. After all, he had acquired the Gift of Providence, so he was extremely lucky. Although he could be unlucky sometimes, luck was usually on his side.</p><p>Unfortunately for him, he had no idea who the previous owner was, so it wasn‚Äôt exciting even though he had gotten his revenge.</p><p>Since the person had a Mystic Fruit Seed, it showed that he was a powerful cultivator who came from a major Sect. Judging from the way he destroyed Lu Ye previously, he was supposed to be a Combat Cultivator.</p><p>It seemed that the previous owner of the seed was a formidable Combat Cultivator in the Eighth or Ninth Order.</p><p>Lu Ye immediately recalled killing a Ninth-Order Combat Cultivator in the mine. Under normal circumstances, he wouldn‚Äôt have been a match for him. However, the person was struck with poison, so his power had been significantly weakened. Despite that, it still took Lu Ye ten breaths of time to kill him.</p><p>The person‚Äôs excellent combat skills showed that he had experienced countless battles.</p><p>Everything fell into place at that instant.</p><p>The previous owner of the Mystic Fruit Seed must be the Ninth-Order Combat Cultivator who happened to be killed by Lu Ye. The person had frequently gotten some training in the Rift of Illusions, so he appeared more powerful than the other Ninth-Order Masters before his eventual demise. There was no doubt he had incredible combat skills.</p><p>Unfortunately for him, his skills couldn‚Äôt help him fend off the effects of Omnipoison Pills.</p><p>Lu Ye didn‚Äôt expect the enmity between them, formed in the sealed space, would be settled in such a way.</p><p>Since he had two Mystic Fruit Seeds with the same use, he decided to give one to Li Baxian when there was a chance in the future. It was beneficial to get some training in the Rift of Illusions, for one wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about losing his life inside. He would only experience some pain at the time of death.</p><p>Lu Ye then retracted his soul from the space and stuffed both seeds into the Storage Sphere on the back of his hand before continuing to explore the rest of the Storage Bags with Yi Yi.</p><p>As time passed, there came a moment when he finally unlocked the last Restraining Lock.</p><p>He tossed the Storage Bag at Yi Yi and got to his feet before stretching his back, finally relieved from this strenuous task.</p><p>A moment later, Yi Yi pushed a hundred Storage Bags toward Lu Ye, each of them filled with things.</p><p>She had divided these bags into three groups. She pointed at a pile of bags and said, ‚ÄúThese bags contain the Spirit Pills and Spirit Stones that you can use. There are also some Mutant Cores.‚Äù</p><p>Then, she pointed at the pile of bags in the middle. ‚ÄúYou can bring these back to the Sect.‚Äù Although some things were not useful to Lu Ye, he could bring them back and pass them to his Junior Brothers and Sisters. Since the items were already sorted out, those from Crimson Blood Sect could place them in the vault to be used at a later time.</p><p>Finally, she pointed at the last pile of bags. ‚ÄúThese aren‚Äôt very useful, so you can sell them to the Divine Trade Association or the Vault of Providence.‚Äù</p><p>With a helper like Yi Yi who was adept at planning and sorting out items, Lu Ye didn‚Äôt have to worry about many things, which saved him a lot of time.</p><p>Lu Ye nodded and sat down cross-legged. Then, he poured the items out from the Storage Bags and put them in his Storage Sphere.</p><p>His Storage Sphere was formed from the Void Glyph that Lady Yun had carved, so it had a large space. Despite that, after he put all the items inside the sphere, there was little space left.</p><p>It had to be said that the amount of loot this time was indeed staggering. It was the total wealth of 2,000 cultivators, after all.</p><p>‚ÄúTell a Manager to come and see me,‚Äù Lu Ye ordered while looking at the pile of bags on the floor. He couldn‚Äôt leave the room lest his whereabouts were exposed. As such, Yi Yi doing it for him would be more appropriate.</p><p>Yi Yi hummed in response and pushed the door open.</p><p>A moment later, she returned with a Manager from the Association.</p><p>When the middle-aged Manager saw the pile of Storage Bags in the room, he felt his eyes twitch despite being a seasoned man.</p><p>Usually, a cultivator would carry two to three Storage Bags, though some would take four to five bags with them. Any more than that would be the loot from killing others.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, only a small number of people would bring dozens of Storage Bags to the Divine Trade Association each year.</p><p>However, the number of bags in front of the middle-aged man was shocking. Given his impeccable eyesight, he soon estimated that there were about 4,000 to 5,000 bags on the floor.</p><p>He knew that the pile of bags meant the loss of countless lives.</p><p>Initially, he thought it was only a normal transaction, but it turned out to be more astounding than he had expected.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
