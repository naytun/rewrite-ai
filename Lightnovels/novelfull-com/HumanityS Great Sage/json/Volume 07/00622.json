He was positioned approximately one hundred and twenty meters above the ground, which was a smart distance to maintain. Not only could he see the situation on the ground clearly, but he also had enough time to react and dodge to the side if he was ambushed.</p><p>Just from this point alone, it could be seen that he was an experienced man indeed.</p><p>When he passed by a certain spot, he suddenly noticed a weak Spiritual Power fluctuation coming from below. He would probably have missed the abnormality if he had not been concentrating so hard. Hence, he immediately turned to look in that direction and saw a figure hastily darting between the trees like a startled bird. Despite the dim light of the night, the other party’s figure was clearly imprinted in his eyes.</p><p>“Lu Yi Ye!” The sight delighted him greatly. He never imagined that he would be able to find Lu Ye, so he was overjoyed to be blessed by such great luck.</p><p>Hurriedly chasing after the figure, he arrived in front of Lu Ye in the blink of an eye and descended from the sky. He was still in mid-air when a machete appeared in his hand. Activating his Spiritual Power, he slashed down on Lu Ye like an eagle pouncing on its prey.</p><p>There was a loud crash.</p><p>Lu Ye, who had been running away, staggered from the powerful impact. At the same time, the Spiritual Powers from their respective Spirit Artifacts collided with each other with a powerful shock and subsequently exploded with tremendous force. The violent wave of air that burst out in all directions abruptly separated them from each other.</p><p>Lu Ye’s feet were planted firmly on the ground, but he slid backwards by more than ten meters. Two long and deep skid marks were plowed into the ground before him. On the other hand, the other party spun around and landed lightly on the ground.</p><p>Even though Lu Ye seemed at a disadvantage from their confrontation, the explosive power he exerted at that moment made the Eighth Order Realm Master frown slightly. The Spiritual Power fluctuation coming from Lu Ye was indeed at the level of a Fifth Order Realm Master, but the strength he displayed did not belong to a Fifth Order Realm Master.</p><p>In any case, the Eighth Order Realm Master did not care. Lu Ye was famous throughout the world for killing enemies stronger than himself, so his performance was not very surprising.</p><p>[In the end, he will die by my hands anyway!] Just as the thought crossed his mind, a figure silently emerged from the ground behind him…</p><p>There were times when Lu Ye had the feeling that Yi Yi had chosen the wrong path in her cultivation. If she had chosen to cultivate the Way of Ghost back then, then she would definitely have the potential to surpass all the other Ghost Cultivators in existence.</p><p>Unfortunately, there were only two members in the Crimson Blood Sect when Lu Ye first joined the Crimson Blood Sect. One was Shui Yuan, and the other was the Sect Master.</p><p>Yi Yi once studied under Shui Yuan to cultivate the Way of Medicine. In the end, she discovered that she had no talent in that aspect and decided to study under the Sect Master to learn the Way of Spells instead. Contrary to expectations, she displayed extraordinary talent in the Way of Spells. She could quickly master any kind of Spell Technique, regardless of how advanced or difficult they were.</p><p>Moreover, she was not restricted by many factors when casting Spell Techniques due to her existence as a Ghost Spirit. She could also perform various types of Spell Techniques except for Lightning-type Spell Techniques… It might be because she was a Ghost Spirit, but she was extremely afraid of Lightning-type Spell Techniques for some reason. Naturally, it was impossible for her to cultivate them herself.</p><p>In any case, she had embarked on the path of a Spell Cultivator and shown impressive talent in the field. It was no longer easy for her to switch to another path at this point, but she would always have the option to concurrently cultivate the Way of Ghost when she became stronger one day.</p><p>Although she had never been exposed to the Way of Ghost, she was born with several inherent advantages that Ghost Cultivators could never hope to match thanks to the fact that she was a Ghost Spirit.</p><p>At this moment, the other party remained completely oblivious to her presence even when she silently appeared behind the enemy. It was not until the Spiritual Power fluctuation came from behind when Yi Yi summoned the Nine Wards Scroll that the Eighth Order Realm Master jumped in fright. Before he had the time to investigate the danger lurking behind him, his vision suddenly went blurry. Then, his entire figure suddenly appeared inside a rocky jungle.</p><p>“Find a place to hide,” Lu Ye instructed before he plunged into the Nine Wards Scroll.</p><p>Time flowed slowly. After a cup of tea’s time, Yi Yi gave the Nine Wards Scroll a shake. Lu Ye’s figure emerged with a few additional wounds on his body. It was fortunate that his injuries were merely minor flesh wounds. Ꞧ</p><p>Meanwhile, the corpse of the Eighth Order Realm Master lay at Lu Ye’s feet. The Eighth Order Realm Master had more wounds on his body in comparison, and his clothes were dyed bright red with blood. Even though he no longer had any vitality, his eyes remained wide open as though he died without understanding the reason.</p><p>There was no denying that the Eighth Order Realm Master had died with great grievances.</p><p>Lu Ye and the Eighth Order Realm Master were evenly matched at the beginning, but they were locked inside the space of the Nine Wards Scroll where Yi Yi could interfere to a certain extent. With her secretly helping Lu Ye, how could the Eighth Order Realm Master hope to compete on equal terms? He was eventually hacked to death by Lu Ye.</p><p>“Let’s go!” Lu Ye called out, then he randomly chose a direction and hurried away.</p><p>The sky was brightening. Besides, he was exhausted after hunting the entire night and needed to rest.</p><p>An hour later, Lu Ye sat cross-legged inside a Concealment Ward and consumed some Spirit Pills to recover his strength.</p><p>He had the feeling that he was strong enough to rival an Eighth Order Realm Master when he returned from the Fox Immortal Valley, but there was no chance to verify his suspicion until he came across the lone Eighth Order Realm Master just now. Their confrontation earlier successfully verified the conjecture in his heart.</p><p>He undoubtedly had the capital to fight evenly against an Eighth Order Realm Master under normal circumstances. Even without Yi Yi helping him in secret, he was confident he could slaughter his enemy. In other words, he had the ability to slay enemies who surpassed him by three Minor Realms!</p><p>In the past, he could only surpass his limits by a maximum of two Minor Realms. The main reason for these changes was the opportunity he received at the Fox Immortal Valley. The baptism of the Heavens that he received as a reward at the time greatly improved not only his heritage but also of Li Baxian and the others.</p><p>It should be said that his current abilities were only measured under normal circumstances. If he activated the Beast Form Secret Technique, then his strength would be further boosted by a significant margin. He might even be able to compete against a Ninth Order Realm Master in direct confrontation!</p><p>Unfortunately, he could not be certain about the extent of his strength. Even if he had single-handedly killed a Ninth Order Realm Master in a one-on-one battle, he had relied upon the Tree of Glyphs’ ability to isolate the effects of the flames during his battle with Huo Liaoyuan. It could be said that he had forcibly drained Huo Liaoyuan to death… Therefore, that was a special situation which could not be used as a standard.</p><p>The activation of the Beast Form Secret Technique also required a long time, and he only activated the Secret Technique once so far.</p><p>In any case, his current strength could already be said to be on par with a Cloud River Realm Master. He was no longer the weakling who was bullied by others when he first entered the Cloud River Battlefield. That was the reason behind his confidence to leave the Arcane Glade. Anybody who dared to underestimate him because of his cultivation would definitely pay a terrible price.</p><p>The Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators never imagined that Lu Ye’s revenge would come so quickly. From their viewpoint, he had fled from the Arcane Glade and hidden himself in the Grand Wilds Peak. He was definitely hiding in fear and panic. Hence, they were determined to keep searching until they discovered his whereabouts and slaughtered him.</p><p>Contrary to their expectations, four or five teams went missing in just one night.</p><p>These Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators had formed small groups and combined their forces, which greatly facilitated their efforts to track Lu Ye.</p><p>Lu Ye was hunted in a similar fashion on many occasions when he was just a Spirit Creek Realm Master. However, he was no longer comparable to his past self in the Spirit Creek Realm. He had yet to master the Concealment Glyph and the Conceal Presence Glyph when he was being hunted in the Spirit Creek Battlefield, so it had been very difficult for him to hide his whereabouts from their large-scale search. At the time, he could only keep running and changing positions to prevent himself from being caught.</p><p>Unlike back then, things were different now. Thanks to the Blessing of the Concealment Glyph and the Conceal Presence Glyph, he could wield the skills of a Ghost Cultivator despite his cultivation as a Combat Cultivator. The Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators had mistakenly assumed that he was their prey, but the truth was the complete opposite. They were actually his prey.</p><p>Although the four or five teams went missing in one night, their absence did not draw much attention. Most Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators generally traveled with their Sect members or close friends and rarely communicated with others, so not many people noticed their absence even after they had gone missing.</p><p>That was the case for the first night, the second night, and the third night… In fact, it was not until the third night that the Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators realized something was amiss.</p><p>Song Zhui was one of those who noticed that something was wrong. Back when he instigated the Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators at the entrance of the Ameliorate Valley, many of those cultivators had exchanged contact information with him via the Battlefield Imprint. However, a batch of these cultivators, who exchanged contact information with him, would disappear every night. Their disappearance was clearly not the work of Spirit Beasts but the malicious actions of men.</p><p>On that note, there was only one other person in the Grand Wilds Peak aside from the large numbers of Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators. That person was none other than Lu Ye!</p><p>[Is he really that strong?] Song Zhui was puzzled. Then, he recalled the words Ying Wuji said to him before they parted ways. Ying Wuji had warned him to be careful of Lu Yi Ye because he was very strong.</p><p>At this moment, he realized that he had always been underestimating Lu Ye. It could even be said that he did not know the depth of Lu Ye’s heritage. If these missing Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators were Lu Ye’s handiwork, then Lu Ye was stronger than he had initially imagined.</p><p>What annoyed him even more was that he had been unable to trace Lu Ye’s whereabouts over the past few days. Lu Ye seemed to have evaporated into mist after he departed the Ameliorate Valley via the Teleportation Ward.</p><p>Nevertheless, he was certain Lu Ye remained in the Grand Wilds Peak! If the missing Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators were indeed Lu Ye’s handiwork, then Lu Ye was bound to repeat his actions.</p><p>The fourth night came… Song Zhui was well-prepared for tonight. He first went out of his way to contact the Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators and ask them for their location in advance, then he simply waited quietly.</p><p>As soon as the first Battlefield Imprint abruptly vanished from existence, he immediately shot into the sky and sped in a certain direction. The rest of his companions quickly followed behind him.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was too late by the time he arrived on the scene with his Juniors. Several corpses were strewn across the ground, their blood soaking the ground around them.</p><p>Song Zhui carefully examined the scene and discovered that the deceased had died from saber wounds. Furthermore, the traces of battle left behind indicated that the fight had been brief. Not only did the team of four consist of cultivators in the Sixth Order Realm and the Seventh Order Realm, but the configuration of their team structure was also pretty good. free𝑤ebnovel.com</p><p>[Lu Ye is only in the Fifth Order Realm. How did he kill so many people in such a short time? Did he have a helper? But, he left the Ameliorate Valley alone. How did he obtain a helper?]</p><p>There were too many questions without answers, and all Song Zhui could confirm was that Lu Ye’s strength was greater than he had imagined.</p><p>Song Zhui was deep in thought when a stream of light passed by overhead. Seeming to notice their presence, the stream of light changed directions and landed nearby to reveal a figure.</p><p>The person nodded lightly at Song Zhui. “Brother Song!”</p><p>“Brother Zizai.”</p><p>This person was Ning Zizai. He was a Ninth Order Realm Master who came from a Second Tier Sect in You Zhou. They not only met each other at the Ameliorate Valley but also had dealings with each other in the past. Therefore, they were not complete strangers to each other.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
