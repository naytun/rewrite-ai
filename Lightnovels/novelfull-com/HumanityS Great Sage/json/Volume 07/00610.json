A fragment of light suddenly appeared between his palms, then the light rapidly expanded and flared brightly. It was immediately followed by the fluctuation of an intense but chaotic Spiritual Power that surged wildly. At a glance, it almost seemed like he was holding a small sun between his hands. The Spiritual Power circulating within the small sun was visible to the naked eye.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ye was currently only thirty meters away from Huo Liaoyuan!</p><p>Huo Liaoyuan‚Äôs strange movements made Lu Ye wary. Although he did not underestimate his opponent, he did not stop his forward charge either. The distance of thirty meters was something he could cross in a second. It would only take a split second for him to slaughter Huo Liaoyuan in a single blow regardless of how powerful the Spell Technique Huo Liaoyuan cast.</p><p>On the other hand, the aura around Huo Liaoyuan had gone dim. It was obvious that he had pretty much exhausted his strength at this point. After all, he had poured the entirety of his remaining Spiritual Power into the small sun in front of him.</p><p>All of a sudden, he shoved both hands forward. The small sun between his palms shot toward Lu Ye at a high speed, and the Spiritual Power flowing across the surface of the small sun simultaneously began to fluctuate at an increasing speed.</p><p>Then, layer after layer began to peel off from the little sun like a gorgeous flower whose petals were blossoming one by one. A horrifying aura instantly filled the Deathmatch Platform as the fiery petals unfolded, and the small sun transformed into an enormous Flame Lotus in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Lu Ye had already dodged to the side by then, but he had not expected such changes to occur. By the time he noticed, he was already enveloped by the Flame Lotus.</p><p>The Flame Lotus Technique bloomed silently, unlike the explosive manifestation of the Prairie Fire Explosion or the majestic appearance of the Meteor Shower. However, the power unleashed by the Spell Technique was more horrifying than the previous two Spell Techniques combined. It was a terrifying heat that could melt everything in existence.</p><p>This particular Spell Technique was another one of Huo Liaoyuan‚Äôs trump cards, but it was a trump card that he had yet to master fully!</p><p>Due to a fifty percent chance of failure whenever he cast this Spell Technique, he generally did not dare to utilize the Spell Technique when facing an enemy lest he hurt himself instead of the enemy. He would not have dared to take such a risk if not for the fact that he was backed into a corner with no other choice.</p><p>Fortunately, he was blessed with good luck. He managed to cast the Spell Technique despite the fifty percent chance of failure. It might be the result of his extreme focus brought about by the tremendous pressure he faced. Nevertheless, his complexion had turned as pale as a sheet. Quietly watching the blossoming Flame Lotus, he finally breathed out in relief at the sight of Lu Ye being engulfed in the flames.</p><p>[Lu Yi Ye won‚Äôt be able to survive now‚Ä¶ right?] Just as the thought appeared in his mind, his pupils contracted in shock and his eyes began to tremble violently.</p><p>A figure slowly walked out from the blooming Flame Lotus ahead with a relaxed expression. His movements were leisurely, as though he was not walking through a vortex of death but his own garden. In fact, his expression was so bland that there was no fluctuation at all.</p><p>Lu Ye did not know much about the Spell Technique that Huo Liaoyuan cast, but he could guess that the power of the Spell Technique was fearsome indeed from the other party‚Äôs reaction and the sensations he felt. Be that as it may, he could isolate the damage from the flames with the blessing of the Tree of Glyphs. Comparatively, the Flame Lotus did not cause as much damage to him as the Prairie Fire Explosion earlier. The impact from the Prairie Fire Explosion had at least caused him severe damage. The silently blooming Flame Lotus could not even burn a single hair on his body.</p><p>‚ÄúHah!‚Äù Huo Liaoyuan murmured unconsciously and involuntarily took a few steps back. His expression was filled with absolute horror. It was another nightmarish scene!</p><p>[First, it was the Prairie Fire Explosion. Then, it was the Flame Lotus Technique. Just what did Lu Yi Ye do!? How is he able to survive two of my trump cards!? Am I dreaming or something!?]</p><p>Unfortunately, the weakness and the pain coming from his body were a constant reminder that he was not dreaming.</p><p>Step by step, Lu Ye took his time and walked until he stood ten meters away from Huo Liaoyuan. The enormous Flame Lotus behind him was gradually dissipating, and the space distorted by the extreme heat returned to normal as though gently relieved by an invisible hand.</p><p>When their gazes met, Huo Liaoyuan parted his dry lips as though to speak. In the end, he couldn‚Äôt bring himself to speak. He simply released a furious roar and boldly charged toward Lu Ye.</p><p>Not a single drop of Spiritual Power remained in his body. As a Spell Cultivator, not having any Spiritual Power meant that he did not even have the capital to cast a single Spell Technique. Even so, he neither admitted defeat nor begged for mercy. The Deathmatch Platform was a place where only one person could survive after all.</p><p>Without taking a step forward, Lu Ye twisted his wrist. A blade light flashed through the air. Then, he gently swung the Inviolable Saber and returned the blade to the sheath.</p><p>A muffled thump came from behind him. It was followed by crimson blood that gushed out and dyed the ground of the Deathmatch Platform bright red.</p><p>Inside the Ameliorate Arcane Glade, the wolf pack and the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade cultivators faced each other across a distance of several hundred meters. Although the distance was within the attacking range of the cultivators, they did not launch an attack on the wolf pack.</p><p>The reason they confronted the wolf pack was to wait for Huo Liaoyuan.</p><p>According to the rules of the Deathmatch Platform, the two parties who entered the Deathmatch Platform would be forced into a fight to the death. When one party perished, then the other party would be returned to their original location. ùêë</p><p>Huo Liaoyuan had activated the power of the Deathmatch Platform inside the Ameliorate Arcane Glade and dragged Lu Ye into the Deathmatch Platform. Therefore, he would be returned to the Ameliorate Arcane Glade when he emerged once more. The Sacred Universe Arcane Glade cultivators naturally had to ensure that they could meet up with him as soon as he appeared.</p><p>Since they did not attack, the wolf pack had no reason to pick a fight either.</p><p>Meanwhile, Li Baxian stood nearby with a gloomy expression on his face and constantly checked Lu Ye‚Äôs Battlefield Imprint to confirm Lu Ye‚Äôs survival. He had nearly gone insane with worry when Lu Ye was dragged into the Deathmatch Platform. It never crossed his mind that Huo Liaoyuan would possess an Exotic Treasure.</p><p>Lu Ye was only in the Fifth Order Realm while Huo Liaoyuan was in the Ninth Order Realm. The difference between their cultivation was incredibly large. Even if Lu Ye had an impressive heritage and excelled at defeating enemies beyond his current strength, there was a limit to everything.</p><p>Li Baxian did not believe that Lu Ye stood a chance against Huo Liaoyuan.</p><p>If Lu Ye could activate the Beast Form Secret Technique with Amber‚Äôs support, then Li Baxian might have had more confidence in Lu Ye. However, Amber remained in a deep slumber even now. It was impossible for Lu Ye to receive help from Amber. Therefore, this battle was extremely dangerous for Lu Ye.</p><p>Li Baxian wished he could take Lu Ye‚Äôs place instead‚Ä¶ Unfortunately, he himself did not have the confidence to defeat Huo Liaoyuan.</p><p>The atmosphere throughout the Ameliorate Arcane Glade was very depressing.</p><p>Time passed slowly. A cup of tea‚Äôs time‚Ä¶ A stick of incense‚Äôs time‚Ä¶</p><p>The expression on Li Baxian‚Äôs face became increasingly strange‚Ä¶ He originally believed that persevering against Huo Liaoyuan in a one-on-one battle for a hundred seconds would be Lu Ye‚Äôs limit. However, Lu Ye remained safe and sound even though an incense stick of time had passed.</p><p>Li Baxian abruptly realized that he might have underestimated Lu Ye. Either that or Amber had suddenly regained consciousness. If that was the case, then it would be hard to determine who would eventually survive the battle once Lu Ye activated the Beast Form Secret Technique.</p><p>Time continued to pass. Li Baxian was becoming more and more certain that Amber had finally awoken at a critical moment. It might even be Lu Ye who had awoken Amber!</p><p>The anxiety and unease that overwhelmed him earlier vanished without a trace. Then, he quietly waited for Lu Ye‚Äôs return. That was because he genuinely believed Lu Ye could defeat Huo Liaoyuan as long as Lu Ye activated the Beast Form Secret Technique!</p><p>On the opposite, the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade cultivators looked very relaxed. In their opinion, Huo Liaoyuan surpassed Lu Ye by four Minor Realms in terms of cultivation. How could Huo Liaoyuan lose? If time dragged on slightly, it must be because Huo Liaoyuan was toying with Lu Ye. Lu Ye was probably suffering a fate worse than death at this moment.</p><p>What they needed to do was simple: They only needed to rush forward to meet Huo Liaoyuan when he finally returned.</p><p>‚ÄúWhat is Huo Liaoyuan doing?‚Äù Somewhere in the crowd, Xia Liang muttered softly under his breath.</p><p>It was a pity that he could not kill Lu Ye and take revenge with his own hands. Be that as it may, Huo Liaoyuan had promised to share twenty per cent of the bounty on Lu Ye‚Äôs head. He was bound to keep his word, but his efficiency was too low. Even though so much time had passed since he entered the Deathmatch Platform, there remained no signs to indicate his return. Did he not know that something unfavorable might happen if a situation dragged out for too long?</p><p>‚ÄúLet‚Äôs wait a little longer. Who knows? He might come out soon,‚Äù Tan Sheng persuaded.</p><p>Xia Liang nodded slightly. Raising his head, he glanced forward and said in a low voice, ‚ÄúBrother Tan, I need your help.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúBrother Xia, please speak.‚Äù</p><p>Xia Liang declared, ‚ÄúI want to kill Li Baxian!‚Äù</p><p>His original purpose was to kill Li Baxian. Yan Xing had died at the hands of Li Baxian, and he had to avenge Yan Xing. His main purpose for targeting Lu Ye in the Carnage Colosseum was to lure Li Baxian out into the open. In the end, he not only accidentally implicated the Raving Bladesmen but also had to give a large number of resources as compensation. That was also how his enmity with Lu Ye had been triggered.</p><p>Although he experienced many twists and turns during the period, he had not forgotten his original intention. Relatively speaking, he wanted to kill Li Baxian more. Now that Lu Ye was destined to die at Huo Liaoyuan‚Äôs hands, there was only one goal left for him.</p><p>Tan Sheng naturally knew about Xia Liang‚Äôs obsession with Li Baxian. Thus, he nodded and agreed ‚ÄúI will cooperate with you when the time comes, Brother Xia.‚Äù</p><p>Xia Liang expressed his thanks. ‚ÄúThank you very much. If all goes well, just let me know if you ever need my help in the future.‚Äù</p><p>Tan Sheng‚Äôs eyes lit up at those words. He acknowledged that his strength was not inferior to Xia Liang. Nonetheless, there was a significant gap between their Sects. The Raving Bladesmen was a First Tier Sect. On the other hand, the New Moon Sect was only a Third Tier Sect. It would not harm his future to obtain this promise from Xia Liang. After all, a favor was often very precious in certain situations.</p><p>‚ÄúBrother Xia, you‚Äôre being too polite. I‚Ä¶ He‚Äôs coming out!‚Äù Tan Sheng suddenly exclaimed.</p><p>Everybody noticed the abnormal phenomenon at the same time. That was because a small ray of light had abruptly flashed into existence in mid-air. Immediately afterwards, the phantom of the Deathmatch Platform appeared in the middle of the light. A white light shot out from the Deathmatch Platform and landed on a certain position. The space around that location suddenly became distorted, and a figure emerged out of thin air!</p><p>The Sacred Universe Arcane Glade cultivators who had been standing at the ready to escort their leader at any time froze in place as though they had been struck by a Lighting Invoking Talisman Paper. Their eyes trembled in disbelief at the sight.</p><p>Among the crowd, Tan Sheng felt his eyelids twitching furiously. Meanwhile, Xia Liang exclaimed in shock, ‚ÄúHow is that possible!?‚Äù</p><p>They were reacting as though they had seen something absolutely unbelievable.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
