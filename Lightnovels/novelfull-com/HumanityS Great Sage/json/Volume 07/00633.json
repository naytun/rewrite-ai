However, most of them were destroyed by the poisonous fog.</p><p>The three Omnipoison Pills that Lu Ye had cast were even more potent than he had expected. The weaker cultivators naturally had less resistance against the poison.</p><p>Cultivators, especially those in the Fifth Order and below, were powerless against the poison even though they had consumed Antidote Pills.</p><p>Also, those in the Fifth Order and below came in the largest number.</p><p>Initially, they only felt the flow of their Spiritual Powers becoming sluggish. They were listless and light-headed. However, as time passed, their vitality was leaving their bodies rapidly under the poison‚Äôs influence, and they eventually lost their lives.</p><p>Those who were still alive were all above the Fifth Order, but regardless of how powerful they were, they were lethargic.</p><p>Gradually, the shrieks and wails in the mine became sparse. It wasn‚Äôt that Lu Ye had stopped attacking; it was just that fewer people were alive now.</p><p>The poisonous fog had become thinner as well, which allowed them to see their surroundings more clearly.</p><p>Somewhere in the mine, Ming Zhe‚Äôs face was tinged with the color green, and behind him were some cultivators of Sacred Universe Arcane Glade.</p><p>There were 2000 of them initially, but only a few of them were left now. The rest of them were lying on the floor, either killed by other people or the poison.</p><p>Those who were still alive appeared horrified, and some of the female cultivators were sobbing in fear.</p><p>Ming Zhe had no idea how things came to this, just like he didn‚Äôt understand how Huo Liaoyuan was killed by Lu Ye. Whenever they dealt with the jinx from Crimson Blood Sect, things no one had expected to happen would take place eventually.</p><p>Tu Guanxiong was the one who exposed the Ameliorate Arcane Glade‚Äôs location. Many cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge gathered in front of Ameliorate Valley, and Ming Zhe returned with the remaining cultivators of Sacred Universe Arcane Glade. They initially wanted to witness Lu Ye‚Äôs death, but things went against their wishes.</p><p>Lu Ye made use of the Teleportation Ward and left Ameliorate Arcane Glade before killing his opponents in the depths of Grand Wilds Peak. As such, some of those from the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade lost their lives as well.</p><p>Then, upon getting wind of Lu Ye‚Äôs whereabouts, Ming Zhe rushed over with his people.</p><p>They thought they would finally witness Lu Ye‚Äôs demise, but to their chagrin, they turned from predators to prey. There were a lot of people on their side, but most of them ended up losing their lives.</p><p>How did that even happen?</p><p>Lu Ye was only a Fifth-Order Master, so how did he even pull off such a feat?</p><p>The poisonous fog rolled around. Following a yelp, a figure emerged from the fog. Even though Ming Zhe couldn‚Äôt make out the person‚Äôs face, he would never forget the familiar figure.</p><p>The person was none other than Lu Ye!</p><p>Lu Ye had apparently discovered them as well, so he wielded his saber without hesitation.</p><p>Ming Zhe growled and stepped forward. As the two figures brushed past each other, blood spurted from Ming Zhe‚Äôs neck before he collapsed to the ground. In the last moments of his life, he heard the screams of the cultivators from the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade who had been hiding behind him. ùê´√°≈ä√≥‚Çø∆ê≈ù</p><p>If he were at the peak of his power, he would‚Äôve been able to fight Lu Ye, considering that he was an Eighth-Order Master. However, the power of Omnipoison Pills had weakened his power by half, so he wasn‚Äôt even able to take one move from Lu Ye.</p><p>By now, the cultivators who had left the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade were all dead.</p><p>Back in the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade, Tu Guanxiong‚Äôs face was livid as he felt the Battlefield Imprints disappearing.</p><p>Not long ago, Ming Zhe had sent him a message informing him about what was going on. Tu Guanxiong only wanted to avenge Huo Liaoyuan‚Äôs death with the help of others, but he didn‚Äôt expect that they would suffer even more losses.</p><p>Presently, Ning Zizai was hiding behind a boulder and restricting his aura. Although the discomfort caused by the poison made him want to puke blood, he didn‚Äôt dare to make any noise.</p><p>He wasn‚Äôt a Ghost Cultivator, so he couldn‚Äôt conceal himself. Nevertheless, in the mine that had been filled with poisonous fog, he could reduce his risk of getting exposed by doing so.</p><p>He even felt that as long as he was careful enough, Lu Ye wouldn‚Äôt discover him.</p><p>Yet, it was all his wishful thinking.</p><p>Everyone‚Äôs eyesight had been affected by the fog, so they could only sense their surroundings, and Lu Ye had a very sensitive perception.</p><p>Even a Ghost Cultivator like Ying Wuji couldn‚Äôt easily approach him, let alone those who were not.</p><p>When Lu Ye was charging around to kill his opponents, some people thought they were smart enough to fool him by lying on the ground, pretending to be dead.</p><p>However, vitality couldn‚Äôt be concealed, and they were eventually killed.</p><p>The sparse shrieks were getting closer to Ning Zizai. Eventually, he saw a figure emerging from the green fog and charging towards him.</p><p>At that moment, he knew his whereabouts had been exposed.</p><p>Without hesitation and certainly not leaving his life to fate, he summoned his Spirit Artifact and contended with Lu Ye, but barely three breaths of time later, his vision slanted, and the last thing he saw was a headless corpse.</p><p>Lu Ye discovered that there were indeed several Ninth-Order Masters among the cultivators who had come to destroy him, and some were still hidden among the crowd.</p><p>At least three to four people had concealed their powers, waiting for a chance to strike.</p><p>They must have come up with plans, but everything was derailed following the detonation of Omnipoison Pills.</p><p>They were unable to locate Lu Ye at the earliest possible opportunity, and as time passed, the poison rendered them weaker, and they were killed by Lu Ye in the end.</p><p>Just four hours ago, the mine was still roisterous, but now, it was so quiet that one could hear a pin drop, and only Lu Ye‚Äôs heavy panting was audible.</p><p>Even though he had only personally killed some of the cultivators as most of them were destroyed by the poison, he was still exhausted. All the Spiritual Power in the Spirit Storage Ring was gone, and only 30 percent of his own Spiritual Power was left in his body.</p><p>It was imaginable that without the ring, Lu Ye wouldn‚Äôt have been able to destroy them all even if he cast all three Omnipoison Pills.</p><p>Compared to the loss of Spiritual Power, he was even more worn out physically. His right arm was numb while holding his saber, and he was swamped with a feeling of indescribable frailty. It was as though he would collapse to the ground at any moment.</p><p>It wasn‚Äôt the most difficult battle he had experienced because the opponents he had to deal with were practically powerless to counterattack. The only person that posed a threat to him was the Ninth-Order Body-tempering Cultivator, but he still managed to kill him with Broken Arrow.</p><p>Since the mine was filled with poisonous fog, Yi Yi was unable to help in the battle, and Lu Ye had kept Amber in the Spirit Beast Bag in advance. If Amber had been around, the situation would‚Äôve been better as he could borrow some energy from the tiger.</p><p>Now, only the last batch of people were left.</p><p>With the saber in his hand, he shuffled towards the passageway.</p><p>Presently, dozens of people gathered in the passageway as they madly cleaned up the rocks in an attempt to flee. However, the passageway was narrow, only allowing several people to stand together shoulder-to-shoulder. Moreover, the poison they were struck with made them inefficient.</p><p>So far, they had only cleaned up 150 meters of the passageway.</p><p>When they heard someone sauntering toward them from behind, their expressions changed drastically. They turned around and saw the blood-soaked Lu Ye approaching them, bringing with him cold and merciless murderous intent.</p><p>These cultivators were naturally horrified.</p><p>Were all the people in the mine dead?</p><p>There were around 2,000 people, so how could they be gone for good so soon?</p><p>But as they listened intently, they realized there was no more noise coming from the mine.</p><p>Lu Ye was coming at them, but there wasn‚Äôt a way out for them. How were they supposed to fend him off when their powers had been weakened by the poison?</p><p>What puzzled them further was why Lu Ye wasn‚Äôt affected by the poison one bit. One had to know that even the Ninth-Order Masters were not safe from the poison.</p><p>At the back of the crowd was a figure who wasn‚Äôt burly, so it was apparent that he wasn‚Äôt a Body-tempering Cultivator. He was poisoned as well, so his skin was dyed green. However, as he stood there, he gave off an imposing vibe. Even though he was facing the merciless Lu Ye, he was unafraid, and he even appeared tempted to give it a shot.</p><p>Lu Ye certainly noticed the person‚Äôs anomaly, and he wondered what was wrong with him. Nevertheless, he didn‚Äôt have time to consider anything else. The remaining cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge were right before his eyes. Once he killed them all, his mission would be pronounced a success.</p><p>He believed that following this incident, he would enjoy a long period of uninterrupted peace.</p><p>As his power increased in the future, he would be unrivaled on the Cloud River Battlefield, just like how he was on the Spirit Creek Battlefield.</p><p>He exerted more force on his legs and leapt forward, the fiery red Saber Light shattering the poisonous fog as his Inviolable Saber reached for the cultivators nearest to him.</p><p>A light screen appeared out of nowhere. Lu Ye‚Äôs all-out attack struck the light screen, only causing a dent in it but not breaking it.</p><p>It was a Defensive Ward!</p><p>Lu Ye stepped backwards and studied the Defensive Ward that protected these cultivators. He recalled Yi Yi saying that there was a skilful Ward Cultivator who managed to break the Explosive Wards in the passageway.</p><p>This person was supposed to be the Ward Cultivator.</p><p>‚ÄúWell done, Brother Si Nan!‚Äù Song Zhui‚Äôs weak cheering was heard coming from the depths of the passageway. He didn‚Äôt expect Si Nan to stay at the back of the crowd and even protect them with a Defensive Ward during a crisis like this. He wasn‚Äôt even aware of when the ward was built.</p><p>The passageway was narrow, so they were well-protected once the Defensive Ward was activated. Unless Lu Ye could break the ward, he could never approach them.</p><p>This came as a surprise to them. As long as Si Nan could hold on for long enough, they could clean up the mess with peace of mind and flee.</p><p>The prerequisite was that they were not killed by the poison before they achieved their goal.</p><p>As such, Song Zhui reminded him by saying, ‚ÄúYou have to hold on at any cost, Brother Si Nan!‚Äù</p><p>Behind the light screen, frailty was written all over Si Nan‚Äôs face. However, he still appeared confident as he replied calmly, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry. He can‚Äôt approach us as long as I‚Äôm still around!‚Äù</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
