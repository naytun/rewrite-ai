As far as Lu Ye could see, countless insectoids were charging towards him. It was too late for him to use some Glyphs to curb his breathing and conceal his presence. Therefore, he immediately leapt into the air, ready to flee in a particular direction.</p><p>However, he barely rose up for 30 meters before he felt some immense pressure, making sure he couldn‚Äôt go any higher.</p><p>At that moment, he was torn between tears and laughter.</p><p>In the Ameliorate Arcane Glade back then, he had repeatedly used the Aerial Lock Ward to deal with the cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge, making them suffer setbacks. He didn‚Äôt expect to be suppressed by the Aerial Lock Ward himself one day.</p><p>He supposed what went around, came around.</p><p>Although he had no idea where this place was, there was apparently an Aerial Lock Ward in place, and he couldn‚Äôt fly higher than 30 meters.</p><p>After he was held up for a while, the insectoids were already closer to him. They kept hissing as their wings were heard fluttering.</p><p>Lu Ye leapt away from the second floor and dashed forward in a particular direction.</p><p>As he looked around, he was overwhelmed with a strange sense of familiarity again.</p><p>This place seemed to be a city. Although he couldn‚Äôt look into the distance, he could see that the streets were neatly constructed, and those streets were lined with houses, which had been ruined following the insectoids‚Äô destruction. Having said that, there were still some houses that were intact.</p><p>The house he had appeared in was one of those in mint condition. Initially, he thought it was a safe place, but it turned out to be a different case.</p><p>It was as if some salt had been dropped into a pan with boiling oil. The moment Lu Ye showed up, all the insectoids in the area were agitated as they hurriedly surrounded the man. Some of their auras showed that they were powerful beings.</p><p>A red glow radiated from the Inviolable Saber as he fully activated his senses. He tried to evade the powerful beings and break the siege.</p><p>His Blade Lights kept flickering as the insectoids that came his way spurted green blood and lost all their vitality. Wherever he went, a storm of bloodlust swirled up.</p><p>While he was running away, he realized something was odd. For example, his senses were more sensitive and powerful than before.</p><p>When he scanned his surroundings in the past, he could only sense some vagueness, and it was restricted within a range of 30 meters.</p><p>But now, his range of perception had expanded by several times, and it was no longer vague. The information that came to him would be clearly displayed in his mind.</p><p>This transformation must have something to do with the fact that his soul had left his body. Back then, he was restricted by his body. Even though his Soul Power was incredible, he wasn‚Äôt able to fully use his power.</p><p>Without the restraint now, he could wholly activate his Soul Power.</p><p>The sensitive perception and the outside information that came to his mind were signs of having the ability to use his Divine Ego.</p><p>Besides that, the Glyphs he crafted seemed different as well.</p><p>Since he was running for his life, he didn‚Äôt have time to think deeply about all of this. As such, he could only push his doubts aside first.</p><p>A large number of insectoids that came in different forms and powers occupied every corner of the city. Lu Ye understood that he could not keep running away forever.</p><p>As time passed, he fell into an even more perilous situation. That was because the powerful insectoids he had avoided were now relentlessly running after him, looking determined to destroy him. As such, the further he went, the more insectoids were racing after him.</p><p>If he was in the Rift of Illusions in the past, he wouldn‚Äôt worry too much, for he could still come back again after he was killed.</p><p>However, he hadn‚Äôt the foggiest idea about what was going on in this Rift of Illusions. He didn‚Äôt know if he would really lose his life if he was killed. Therefore, he didn‚Äôt dare to take any chances.</p><p>While he was running away, a pink, oval insectoid suddenly appeared in the sky in front of him. The insectoid was chubby with four limbs. At first glance, one might mistake it for a bald fatty. ·πö√°êåΩùñîùêõŒï≈°</p><p>The insectoid didn‚Äôt have wings, so Lu Ye had no idea how it could fly. Despite its adorable appearance, it gave off a dangerous feeling.</p><p>As such, Lu Ye was alarmed the moment the insectoid came into his sight.</p><p>He wanted to change directions, but it was too late. The insectoid opened its mouth and shot out a crystal-clear thread, which turned into a web in the blink of an eye and covered a large area.</p><p>Lu Ye was unable to dodge. As he was surrounded by the web, he uncontrollably crashed into it.</p><p>The web that appeared out of nowhere didn‚Äôt only restrict him. Lu Ye could also feel the Tree of Glyphs within him reacting abnormally.</p><p>Nonetheless, he didn‚Äôt have time to examine anything. Whenever there was an anomaly with the Tree of Glyphs, it usually meant he was struck with poison.</p><p>In other words, the web was venomous.</p><p>Any other Real Lake Realm Master would‚Äôve been paralyzed and killed by the poison even if he managed to get rid of the web.</p><p>However, the poison didn‚Äôt have any effects on Lu Ye.</p><p>Before he even landed on the ground, he wielded his saber and broke free from the web. The instant he stabilized himself, he was ready to start running again.</p><p>Just then, the sky above him turned dim. The relentless insectoids had caught up with him and covered a large area above his head.</p><p>After he was held up for a moment, he fell into a passive situation as the insectoids encircled him in all directions.</p><p>Needless to say, he was unable to run away.</p><p>Right after the thought flashed through his mind, he charged forward with his saber and got into a fight with the insectoids in that direction.</p><p>The short while of running for his life made him realize that nowhere was safe in this strange environment. Regardless of where he went, there would be insectoids trying to kill him.</p><p>In order to stay alive, he had no choice but to kill all the insectoids in sight. Only then would he have a chance to take a breather.</p><p>There was no doubt it was a difficult feat to pull off.</p><p>The insectoids that had surrounded him were all in the Real Lake Realm, and there were dozens of them. Lu Ye felt that the pink, chunky insectoid was the most formidable among them.</p><p>Moreover, the battle might even attract more insectoids to come over. Based on his observation, the scenario was likely to happen.</p><p>Certainly, Lu Ye wouldn‚Äôt want to get killed to find out what would happen after his death.</p><p>As such, he only had one option left.</p><p>In the past, regardless of what danger he fell into, he still had Amber and Yi Yi with him.</p><p>But this time, he was on his own. Without Yi Yi and Amber around, he couldn‚Äôt borrow any external force. Although his power had reached the Real Lake Realm after he got rid of the restraint that was his body, the enemies he came across were also more powerful.</p><p>He was worried he might lose his life here.</p><p>More and more insectoids were killed during the battle. Lu Ye moved around dexterously while the Saber Lights of Inviolable Saber crisscrossed the battlefield.</p><p>Although Lu Ye was resentful of Xia Liang, he was grateful to him at this moment because the man had taught him Mind‚Äôs Eye Technique back in Fox Immortal Valley.</p><p>When he was in a one-on-one fight, the effects of Mind‚Äôs Eye Technique were not so conspicuous. However, when he was surrounded by so many enemies, the Secret Technique proved to be immensely useful.</p><p>Most of the time, Lu Ye managed to fend off the lethal attacks by relying on Mind‚Äôs Eye Technique.</p><p>Nevertheless, it couldn‚Äôt help bring him out of danger. Even though Lu Ye managed to kill a lot of insectoids, the rest of them were still fearlessly launching attacks on him, causing more and more injuries to form on his figure.</p><p>Although he didn‚Äôt bleed, the wounds had affected him in the same way as under normal circumstances. The injuries were painful and accelerated his consumption of energy.</p><p>As time passed, the battlefield was covered in the broken limbs and carcasses of the insectoids, but Lu Ye‚Äôs attacks had also become weaker.</p><p>He was running out of energy.</p><p>At that moment, he couldn‚Äôt help but recall the question that had been bugging him. Would he really lose his life if he was killed here?</p><p>If that was a yes, Yi Yi and Amber wouldn‚Äôt stay alive either. He and Amber had activated the Life Energy Art together, so their fates had been intertwined. On the other hand, Yi Yi was an apparition that was inseparable from Amber. It could be said that the three of them couldn‚Äôt live without each other.</p><p>If he was to lose his life, he would feel terribly sorry for the two of them.</p><p>The moment he saw the second door, he knew that the world behind it was dangerous. However, based on past experiences, he firmly believed that he wouldn‚Äôt really lose his life in the Rift of Illusions. That was why he even pushed the door open and entered it.</p><p>Nonetheless, that was merely his assumption, and he didn‚Äôt expect to fall into such a state.</p><p>A huge impact came right at him all of a sudden. A hound-like insectoid crashed into him and sent him flying away. At that moment, he felt his vision become blurred.</p><p>It was at that instant that a red glow flashed across his eyes.</p><p>The momentary red glow stirred up a sense of familiarity within him again.</p><p>At the most critical moment, time seemed to have stopped moving. Many ideas flashed across Lu Ye‚Äôs mind, and he soon figured out what was going on with the sense of familiarity.</p><p>He had actually seen the red glow before.</p><p>[No way! How could that be?]</p><p>If things were just as he thought, it would be inconceivable.</p><p>Either way, he had to go on and verify it. If that was indeed the case, he might stand a chance to survive.</p><p>The moment he leapt into the air, the insectoids around him also dashed towards him, but they were met with a fiery attack in a half-moon shape.</p><p>The attack was more powerful than anything Lu Ye had cast ever since he started cultivating.</p><p>Several insectoids were dismembered in an instant, and even more of them were sent flying away. Lu Ye landed on the ground and blessed his legs with Windwalk before running after the red glow.</p><p>More than ten breaths later, Lu Ye broke the siege and dragged his injured figure forward. He looked into the distance and saw a fiery red lantern in front of a building.</p><p>The red glow came from the cover of this lantern.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
