Once their disciples reached a certain level of cultivation, they were free to choose where they wished to train. Recently, many of the Crimson Blood Sect‚Äôs disciples had left the Outpost and entered the Inner Circle. Some chose to take shelter with other sects‚Äô Outposts, while others, like the forerunner Chen Yu, chose to venture into the Inner Circle alone.</p><p>The choice was entirely up to the individual. No one was forced into anything.</p><p>Disciples from their allied sects were also sent to the Crimson Blood Sect to cultivate, further strengthening the sect‚Äôs power. A few days ago, there was an insectoid attack, but instead of worrying, the Crimson Blood Sect simply saw them as a great source of Contribution Points, not stopping until they‚Äôd completely exhausted the energy of the Nucleus of Life in their nest.</p><p>In the battlefield of the Outer Circle, the Crimson Blood Sect‚Äôs Outpost undoubtedly stood as a mighty force. In a radius of a thousand kilometers from the Crimson Blood Sect‚Äôs Outpost, no Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators dared to tread recklessly.</p><p>It was said that several nearby Thousand Demon Ridge forces were even planning to relocate their Outposts.</p><p>They had no choice. Life had become too difficult, and what else could they do but move?</p><p>‚ÄúThere aren‚Äôt any targets left.‚Äù</p><p>Lu Ye stood up upon hearing Tao Zhengyu‚Äôs inquiry and stretched his back.</p><p>He also wanted to move on to the next target, but it was best not to go overboard sometimes.</p><p>No matter how one looked at it, he was bullying the weak this time, which was a little different from back when he was in Heaven Nine.</p><p>Of course, the main point was that he didn‚Äôt know the origins of the Ninth-Order Cloud River Realm cultivators who had attacked him in Carnage Colosseum. Otherwise, he could just openly go after them.</p><p>He only knew Tan Sheng and Wei Que‚Äôs origins because of Li Baxian and Xia Qianqian.</p><p>There was also a blade wielder that others referred to as Xia Liang. He seemed to come from the Raving Bladesmen. The blade technique insights that he needed‚Ä¶ seem to have shown themselves.</p><p>‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Tao Zhengyu hummed a response without protest. Though somewhat disappointed, he didn‚Äôt push the matter.</p><p>The gains from this trip were already abundant.</p><p>‚ÄúYi Yi, take Junior Brother Tao back to the Outpost, and be careful on the way.‚Äù</p><p>Lu Ye instructed.</p><p>UpdatùìÆd frùô§m ∆í–≥eewe…ìn‡´¶vel.com.</p><p>‚ÄúUnderstood. You take care too,‚Äù Yi Yi responded as she summoned her Flight-Type Artifact.</p><p>She had her own Flight-Type Artifact, but following Lu Ye all the time, she never had the opportunity to use it.</p><p>After a while, Yi Yi rose to the skies with Tao Zhengyu and flew in the direction of the Crimson Blood Sect‚Äôs Outpost.</p><p>She and Amber could both exert strength at the level of Heaven Nine, so they hardly encountered any danger in this Spirit Creek Battlefield, especially now that all the major Thousand Demon Ridge sects were on high alert, wary of Lu Ye‚Äôs arrival. None of the powerful cultivators would be wandering around.</p><p>But with their strength, even if they bumped into a couple of Heaven Nine cultivators, they would still be able to handle them.</p><p>That was why Lu Ye wasn‚Äôt concerned about Yi Ye and Amber‚Äôs safety at all.</p><p>After checking his 10-point map, Lu Ye also quickly summoned his own Flight-Type Artifact and stepped onto it, flying leisurely in one direction.</p><p>He was heading to Skysword Peak to wait for the offerings sent over by Thousand Demon Ridge.</p><p>After all that busy work, it was time to reap the rewards.</p><p>The agreed-upon time was ten days, so there was no need to hurry. He wandered around leisurely, feeling quite carefree.</p><p>While he was enjoying himself, many Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators were in the midst of suffering.</p><p>Almost every one of Thousand Demon Ridge‚Äôs Outposts had received warnings from their sect to stay on guard against Yi Ye. If they were to find his tracks, they were to immediately withdraw back to Jiu Zhou.</p><p>This caused almost all the cultivators in the Thousand Demon Ridge‚Äôs Core Circle Outposts to be on high alert, for fear that The Annihilator of Sects would suddenly attack.</p><p>And, there was no need to mention just how on edge the sects that were close to the Clouded Sun Clan‚Äôs Outpost were.</p><p>But despite waiting and waiting, no one saw any sign of The Annihilator of Sects. After destroying the Outpost of the Clouded Sun Clan, he disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Two days later, Lu Ye arrived at Skysword Peak.</p><p>He had been here once several months ago to wait for the Thousand Demon Ridge‚Äôs peace offering, and he thought he would never come here again after leaving the Spirit Creek Battlefield, but he didn‚Äôt expect to come back again and do the same thing as he did several months ago.</p><p>Life truly was unpredictable.</p><p>After landing on the Spirit Peak, Lu Ye found a flat rock and sat cross-legged on it, his Inviolable Saber right beside him.</p><p>Looking at the sea of clouds rolling in front of him, Lu Ye suddenly regretted giving such a long deadline to the Thousand Demon Ridge.</p><p>It was impossible for him to cultivate in the Spirit Creek Battlefield since his cultivation had already exceeded the level of the Spirit Creek Realm. So, even if he took in the Spiritual Energy from this Heaven and Earth or consumed Spirit Pills, neither had any effect.</p><p>But there was nothing he could do about that. He could only take out the books he had gotten from Lady Yun and study them.</p><p>He had already gone through these books more than once, but each time he reviewed them, he would gain something new. He also learned some interesting Glyphs from the books, but as they were not on the Tree of Glyphs, constructing them would require extensive practise all the while carrying a risk of failure.</p><p>Up till now, the most useful Glyph he had learned from these books was Glyph: Void.</p><p>Without Glyph: Void, he wouldn‚Äôt have been able to survive multiple near-death experiences in the Carnage Colosseum, nor could he have persisted for so long under the pursuit of so many powerful cultivators.</p><p>This was a very promising Glyph, and Lu Ye had always thought that there must be a similar Glyph on the Tree of Glyphs. However, he had not been able to unlock it and didn‚Äôt know which leaf it was on.</p><p>If he could unlock that Glyph on the Tree of Glyphs, it would make setting up Teleportation Wards much easier in the future. With one fixed-point Teleportation Ward, he could return to it at any time through the use of Glyph: Void as long as he was within range of it, and he wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about setting up multiple Wards.</p><p>The Glyph itself had the effect of teleportation and the purpose of using it as the core of the Ward was to make the Glyph more robust and stable.</p><p>Without the framework of a Ward and no one to maintain it, Glyphs were easily destroyed.</p><p>He could even construct the Glyph on his own Spirit Artifact to develop new means of killing enemies.</p><p>Of course, these were all just ideas that he pondered during his leisure time. To accomplish such a thing, he would need to get the right leaf burning on the Tree of Glyphs.</p><p>While he was studying on Skysword Peak, two figures flew out on their Flight-Type Artifacts from the Outpost of a Core Circle sect. They were one man and one woman. The man appeared to be in his thirties or forties, with a majestic appearance and a tall and imposing figure, clearly someone in a high position.</p><p>The woman had a beautiful appearance, and it was simply impossible to tell her exact age from looks alone. She could be 16 to 17, or 24 to 25. She had a tall figure, but what was rare was her supple figure.</p><p>Both of them were experts in the Ninth Order Real Lake Realm.</p><p>Never in their lives had they imagined that they would still have the opportunity to enter the Spirit Creek Battlefield, let alone with the mission of negotiating with a brat on the Cloud River Realm.</p><p>The matter had been discussed by the Divine Ocean Realm experts, and in the end, the two of them were chosen to come.</p><p>The main reason was because this matter was neither big nor small, so it was not appropriate for the Divine Ocean Realm experts to come in person. If the negotiations failed and the situation became awkward, then it would be difficult to wrap up the situation once a fight broke out.</p><p>Of course, the most important reason was Lu Ye‚Äôs domineering strength. These Divine Ocean Realm experts really did not have the confidence to defeat him.</p><p>It would be fine if they won the fight, but what if they lost? They were all Divine Ocean Realm cultivators, so how could they explain it to the world when they were pressed on the ground by a kid who was barely 18 and taught a lesson by him?</p><p>So, after much discussion, they decided that it was more appropriate for a cultivator in the Real Lake Realm to handle the negotiations. Firstly, it showed their sincerity, and the Real Lake Realm cultivators were also confident in being able to keep the negotiation under control.</p><p>Originally, two male candidates were chosen, but just as they were concluding the matter, one Divine Ocean Realm expert spoke up and replaced one of them with the woman instead.</p><p>The flower-basket-like Flight-Type Artifact flying in the sky looked beautiful, complementing the woman‚Äôs stunning beauty and curvaceous figure, enough to attract the gaze of almost all the men in the world.</p><p>Yun Qingyue stood on the flower-basket, looking up at the rolling clouds in the sky, feeling a little annoyed inside.</p><p>It wasn‚Äôt just because of the occasional glances she felt from behind, but also the instructions given by that Divine Ocean Realm senior before their departure.</p><p>She didn‚Äôt know where that Divine Ocean Realm senior had obtained the information, but it was said that The Annihilator of Sects had no preferences other than women who were big and round, and that was why she was chosen to replace the original negotiation candidate, all in hopes that she could perform well.</p><p>On one hand, her figure suited The Annihilator of Sects‚Äô taste, and on the other hand, her appearance made it difficult to gauge her age, making it easy for people to mistake her for a young girl in her teens, which could lower Yi Ye‚Äôs guard.</p><p>It was not abnormal for a hot-blooded young man, only 17 or 18, to have a fondness for beautiful women. With so many female cultivators in Thousand Demon Ridge, why did they choose her specifically?!</p><p>But the Divine Ocean Realm expert had spoken, and she had no room to refuse. She had no other choice but to grit her teeth and go, only hoping she would not suffer too much humiliation.</p><p>The strength of a Spirit Creek Realm cultivator at the elite-level was not something she could contend with.</p><p>As for the rumor that The Annihilator of Sects liked women who were big and round, she heard that it had supposedly been verified.</p><p>When he challenged the Roll of Supremacy, he had killed practically all the opponents he faced, regardless of gender, save for a single woman called Bai Lan, who was big and round‚Ä¶</p><p>Even female cultivators were killed, showing that Yi Ye was not soft-hearted towards the fairer sex, but inexplicably, he spared Bai Lan, which naturally made people ponder.</p><p>‚ÄúJunior Sister Yun, there‚Äôs no need to be so anxious. That brat gave a ten-day deadline and it‚Äôs only been two days. With our speed, we‚Äôll be able to reach Skysword Peak in a day,‚Äù said Wu Jun, who followed behind Yun Qingyue.</p><p>They weren‚Äôt of the same sect, but they had interacted during their youth.</p><p>Speaking of which, he had once been infatuated with this Junior Sister Yun. After all, Yun Qingyue was a heavenly beauty that drove all the young people in all of the Thousand Demon Ridge crazy during their generation. It was rare for someone to see her appearance and not be moved.</p><p>Unfortunately, he was a nobody then and only had the qualification to admire her from afar.</p><p>Now, he was also a cultivator in the Ninth-Order Real Lake Realm with a chance of breaking through into the Divine Ocean Realm in the future. He was no longer the young and humble youth of the past and had gained some composure. Though he still found this heavenly beauty pleasing to the eye, he wouldn‚Äôt have other thoughts about her.</p><p>Still, it was rare to be able to go on a mission with the dream goddess of his youth, and he did find it enjoyable to some extent, so he wasn‚Äôt in a hurry to rush over. In fact, he even hoped to take the journey slow.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
