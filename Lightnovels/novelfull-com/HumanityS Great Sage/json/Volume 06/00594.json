Yet, Lu Ye and the others unexpectedly encountered it here.</p><p>In that case, it seemed that activating the altar did not lead to a Hidden Realm as Feng Yuechan speculated, but simply brought them to a Divine Baptism.</p><p>But for Lu Ye and the others, this was the best reward.</p><p>After the excitement subsided, Lu Ye suddenly realized a problem.</p><p>During his time in the Spirit Creek Battlefield, he had received the Divine Baptism four times, with each subsequent one having diminishing effects. By the fourth time, the effect was almost negligible, which was why he decisively advanced to the Cloud River Realm. If he could still receive good benefits, why would he leave the Spirit Creek Battlefield?</p><p>But it was not only him. Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan were in the same situation. They had occupied a spot on the Roll of Supremacy for over ten years, but they heard that the Heavens was no longer guiding them. Occupying a spot on the Roll of Supremacy was just an empty ranking without any substantial rewards.</p><p>Among the four present, including Amber, only Ju Jia had not experienced the Divine Baptism before.</p><p>So, even if this was a land of baptism, would it really be effective for them?</p><p>If it was useless, then even if this was a land of baptism, they would not gain any benefits.</p><p>Li Baxian clearly realized this problem and had been silently refining the surrounding power. After a while, he had an excited look on his face. “It’s effective!”</p><p>Lu Ye also tried it and discovered that, just as Li Baxian said, the mist here was different from the Divine Baptism they obtained from the Roll of Supremacy. It was evidently more advanced. The Divine Baptism from the Roll of Supremacy was useless for Lu Ye and the others, but the one here was effective.</p><p>“Let’s spread out,” Lu Ye said.</p><p>Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan both nodded in agreement.</p><p>Ju Jia had already sat down cross-legged and closed his eyes to cultivate. With each breath he took, a large amount of dense white mist was drawn into his mouth and flowed into his body.</p><p>Lu Ye walked in a certain direction, but after walking only a hundred meters, he was blocked by an invisible barrier.</p><p>He raised his hand and probed it, only to find that the barrier was extremely sturdy and couldn’t be shaken with his current cultivation level. So, he changed direction and walked to the side.</p><p>After walking around a hundred meters, as expected, another invisible barrier appeared ahead.</p><p>With that, he gathered that the space here wasn’t large, only around a hundred meters in length and width.</p><p>Looking back, Lu Ye couldn’t see Li Baxian and the others anymore. The dense white mist was blocking his line of sight.</p><p>There was no need to continue exploring. Lu Ye sat down in place and began constructing small Spirit Gathering Funnels in his body.</p><p>Yi Yi also emerged from Amber’s body and sat down ten meters away to cultivate, while Amber opened its mouth wide and devoured the pervasive mist.</p><p>Several small Spirit Gathering Funnels worked together, drawing the surrounding mist into Lu Ye’s body constantly with an invisible force, but the flow of the mist around him was clearly visible.</p><p>His cultivation aptitude was indeed very poor, and he couldn’t absorb the World Spiritual Qi normally, not even the Spiritual Power in Spirit Stones.</p><p>But with his unique cultivation method and this environment, the benefits he could obtain were unmatched by anyone else.</p><p>Thinking back to when he was in the Dragon Spring, the Pool of Divine Purification, he had used such a cultivation method to obtain unimaginable benefits.</p><p>From the simple test earlier, he confirmed that the white mist here was of a higher grade than that of the Divine Baptism from the Roll of Supremacy in the Spirit Creek Battlefield. However, it was difficult to determine the exact level of improvement.</p><p>Until this moment.</p><p>Vague astonishment was revealed on Lu Ye’s face.</p><p>As the invisible force surged into his body, every piece of flesh and blood in his body slowly squirmed. It was a sign that his body was growing stronger, and his mind soared even more so with an ethereal and transcendent feeling. His Mental Power also rapidly strengthened at an impressive speed.</p><p>Not only that, but the surging power injected into his body merged with the River of Spiritual Power, increasing its volume while accelerating its flow at the same time.</p><p>The Divine Baptism here… actually had the effect of enhancing one’s cultivation!</p><p>The Divine Baptism from the Roll of Supremacy didn’t have such an effect. Lu Ye had received the baptism of the Heavens four times in the Spirit Creek Battlefield, which strengthened both physique and mind, but none of those times resulted in even the slightest increase in his cultivation.</p><p>But here, it was possible!</p><p>Upon careful thought, it did seem reasonable.</p><p>Generally speaking, cultivators who could ascend to the Roll of Supremacy in the Spirit Creek Battlefield were mostly in Heaven Nine, which was already the limit of the Spirit Creek Realm. Any further advancement would require breaking through into the Cloud River Realm. Therefore, the Divine Baptism in the Spirit Creek Battlefield had no effect on cultivation as it would be useless for the powerhouses who could get on the Roll of Supremacy.</p><p>Lu Ye was the first person in history to climb the Roll of Supremacy with a cultivation level of Heaven Seven and occupy the top position with a cultivation level of Heaven Eight.</p><p>This Divine Baptism, which could enhance his physique, strengthen his mind, and even elevate his cultivation, was much better than the Divine Baptism from the Roll of Supremacy in the Spirit Creek Battlefield.</p><p>It could be foreseen that after this time, his own strength would be significantly enhanced.</p><p>The only unknown was how long he could cultivate here.</p><p>Even if this was a reward from the Heavens, it was impossible to cultivate here indefinitely. Realizing this, Lu Ye became even more eager.</p><p>While the group was cultivating here, in the Grand Wilds Peak, two figures were rushing away in a sorry state, and they were none other than Xia Liang and Tan Sheng.</p><p>After Lu Ye killed the Fox Mutant and released the Divine Soul Secret Technique, the two of them realized the danger they were in and fled immediately, flying all the way until they reached this place.</p><p>“Brother Xia, let’s take a break.” Tan Sheng gasped for breath. What they experienced today was just like a dream. They had battled an elite-level Spirit Beast and hadn’t even fully recovered yet when a pack of Wolf Mutants attacked.</p><p>Their survival was not entirely due to luck.</p><p>Most of it was thanks to their own powerful strength. After all, they were Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivators with foundations that surpassed ordinary cultivators.</p><p>Even so, Tan Sheng was nearing his limits.</p><p>Even though Xia Liang still had strength to spare, he also wouldn’t be able to last for long. When he saw the sorry state that Tan Sheng was in, he nodded. “Let us do that.”</p><p>The two landed at once and took out Spirit Pills to help them recover.</p><p>After a moment, when Tan Sheng recovered slightly, he had a nervous expression on his face as he said, “I didn’t expect there to be monsters of such a level in the Cloud River Battlefield.”</p><p>Recalling the past month or so they spent in Fox Immortal Valley, Tan Sheng felt as if he were in a dream. When he was enslaved by the Divine Soul Secret Technique of the Fox Mutant, he didn’t feel anything until the Secret Technique dispelled on its own after the Fox Mutant died, where he finally woke up as if from a dream.</p><p>“What I can’t understand is how Lu Ye managed to break free.” Considering everything that happened before, Lu Ye must have never been affected by the Divine Soul Secret Technique. Otherwise he wouldn’t have mobilized the wolf pack to encircle them. Today’s events were definitely planned by Lu Ye for a long time, or the timing wouldn’t have been so coincidental, happening right after the battle with the elite-level Spirit Beast in Fox Immortal Valley when their strength was greatly diminished.</p><p>Xia Liang was also pondering this question and voiced his suspicion, “The only possibility is that his Divine Soul is powerful enough to resist the Fox Mutant’s Divine Soul Secret Technique.”</p><p>Tan Sheng’s eyes twitched, “He’s only in the Fourth Order Cloud River Realm. How strong could his Divine Soul be?”</p><p>Despite saying that, he also understood that this was the only reasonable explanation. The Fox Mutant probably couldn’t imagine that among all the cultivators in Fox Immortal Valley, she would end up dying at the hands of someone with the lowest cultivation level.</p><p>“This Lu Yi Ye… has done many extraordinary things in the Spirit Creek Battlefield. We must not underestimate him.” After the last time, Xia Liang had thoroughly investigated Lu Ye, and he was astonished when he saw the reports on him.</p><p>Throughout history, no cultivator had caused such a stir in the Spirit Creek Battlefield, let alone repeatedly defeating the sects in the Core Circle with his own strength.</p><p>Throughout history, no Heaven Eight cultivator had ever occupied the top position in the Roll of Supremacy.</p><p>Before this journey, Xia Liang had already warned himself not to underestimate Lu Yi Ye, but now he realized that he had still underestimated him even when he thought he was overestimating him. Three Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivators sought revenge together, but Wei Que had died, and they were now fleeing like stray dogs.</p><p>Tan Sheng chuckled. “Doesn’t this mean that we owe him a life-saving favor?”</p><p>Xia Liang coldly snorted, “Tan Sheng, are you implying that we should be grateful to him?”</p><p>Tan Sheng’s expression turned cold, “How is that possible? He killed an acolyte of my New Moon Sect and destroyed our Outpost. How could I forget that? It’s just… Seeking revenge against him is as difficult as reaching the Heavens!”</p><p>So what if they found out where the location of Lu Ye’s Arcane Glade was now? The Arcane Glade was shrouded by Wards and guarded by Wolf Mutants. Even if they found several dozen men to help them, it still wouldn’t guarantee success.</p><p>With their connections, they could gather that many helpers, even hundreds.</p><p>But even so… would they really be able to take down that Arcane Glade? Could they truly kill Lu Yi Ye? Even if they succeeded, they would undoubtedly suffer heavy casualties.</p><p>Xia Liang clenched his fists, which cracked with a crisp sound. He couldn’t understand what Lu Yi Ye had done to deserve such an ability that allowed him control over a wolf pack!</p><p>He also recalled how he had guided Lu Ye daily in the cultivation of his blade technique on Fox Immortal Valley and taught him the Mind’s Eye Technique… The frustration in his heart was almost overwhelming.</p><p>That bastard wasn’t affected by the Divine Soul Secret Technique at all, but he used it as an excuse to seek guidance on his blade techniques. He was also incredibly foolish, teaching him whatever he wanted to know!</p><p>“There are more than just the two of us who want to take his life in Thousand Demon Ridge,” Xia Liang said, trying to calm himself.</p><p>“Brother Xia, are you suggesting that…” Tan Sheng pondered.</p><p>“We should secretly spread the location of Lu Yi Ye’s Arcane Glade. There will always be someone who will cause him trouble, especially those large Arcane Glades… They are constantly plundering Wisps of Sanctification to expand and improve their Arcane Glades, and the allure of a Primus-level Wisp of Sanctification is not small to them, adding on Lu Yi Ye himself…” Xia Liang paused suddenly. “I remember there is an Arcane Glade nearby that is mainly composed of Cult Blackfyre cultivators. Cult Blackfyre hates the Crimson Blood Sect more than anyone else. If that group of lunatics finds out Lu Yi Ye’s whereabouts, guess what they will do?”</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
