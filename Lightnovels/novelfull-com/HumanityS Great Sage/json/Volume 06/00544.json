There’s no need to discuss anything with me.”</p><p>Wu Jun stepped forward and said sternly, “If we don’t agree, what then? Do you really have the guts to destroy all of the Thousand Demon Ridge’s Outposts?”</p><p>“You think I don’t?” Lu Ye turned his gaze to Wu Jun.</p><p>“I believe that Cultivator Lu does have the capability!” Wu Jun stared back at him, unflinching.</p><p>Considering what happened a few months ago, with so many of the Thousand Demon Ridge’s Core Circle Outposts being destroyed and so many cultivators being killed, Lu Ye did indeed have the ability. However, having the ability didn’t necessarily mean he would do it. If he really did, it wouldn’t bode well for the Grand Sky Coalition either, and when that happened, the entire Spirit Creek Battlefield would descend into chaos. If Yi Ye was at all rational, he wouldn’t make such a reckless move.</p><p>“You’re right. It is indeed impractical to destroy all the Outposts.” Lu Ye’s tone changed, and he spoke with a thoughtful expression. “But among so many Core Circle Outposts, picking out three, five, or even ten sects shouldn’t affect much. Let’s start with the Snow Feather Clan and the Wind Cloud Mansion. What do you both think?”</p><p>[Did we challenge you?]</p><p>Follow curr𝒆nt nov𝒆ls on fɾeeweɓnѳveɭ.com.</p><p>Both Yun Qingyue and Wu Jun’s expressions changed. If Lu Ye really acted as he said, the Thousand Demon Ridge really wouldn’t have a good way to deal with it. Compared to the number of Core Circle Sects in the Thousand Demon Ridge, three or even ten weren’t many. As Lu Ye said, even if they were occupied, it wouldn’t affect the overall situation.</p><p>He had already done something similar just a few months ago where he captured nearly thirty Outposts.</p><p>If he were to attack again, who knew which Outpost he would capture? Until this matter was resolved, every sect in the Core Circle would be living anxious lives as if a blade was hanging over their necks. Nobody could ensure that their Outposts would remain safe from Yi Ye’s tyranny.</p><p>If it so happened that Yi Ye paid them a visit, one would undoubtedly be willing to pay a price in exchange for the safety of their Outpost.</p><p>As for Lu Ye’s statement about starting with the Snow Feather Clan and the Wind Cloud Mansion, it was a clear threat. Yun Qingyue and Wu Jun couldn’t be unaware of it.</p><p>Yun Qingyue felt helpless. It seemed that her intervention did not bring about any special effect in the slightest. Though this young man had taken an extra glance at her when they first met, it didn’t earn her any special treatment.</p><p>How could someone so young be so difficult to deal with?</p><p>She quickly spoke again, “Please rest your anger, Cultivator Lu. Senior Brother Wu and I came here in order to discuss and find a solution that can satisfy everyone. How about this? The Thousand Demon Ridge is willing to provide resources worth 3 million Contribution Points. If you agree, I can have someone deliver it at once.”</p><p>Three million Contribution Points worth of resources, even when calculated based on the purchase price of goods from the Vault of Providence, was still a sizable amount.</p><p>It was enough to sustain any cultivator for a lifetime.</p><p>Though Cloud River Realm cultivators could accumulate more Contribution Points than Spirit Creek Realm cultivators, most of them would have only a few thousand to tens of thousands of Contribution Points, so the terrifying number of three million Contribution Points would undoubtedly make any Cloud River Realm cultivator so excited that they could hardly breathe.</p><p>Lu Ye, however, remained calm.</p><p>He had received resources worth twenty to thirty million Contribution Points from the Thousand Demon Ridge last time, so what was a mere three million? It was almost a tenfold difference. The Thousand Demon Ridge’s offer today was like throwing scraps to a beggar.</p><p>Though his demands seemed unjust, it had always been a common tactic for two major factions to weaken the enemy’s resources while strengthening their own, something which anyone would be happy to see.</p><p>Furthermore, there were reasons to justify his demands.</p><p>Lu Ye didn’t speak, and Yun Qingyue didn’t either. They both waited silently.</p><p>Instead, Wu Jun continued to play his role and said sternly, “Cultivator Lu, offering resources worth three million Contribution Points is already the greatest sincerity that the Thousand Demon Ridge can show. One should not be too greedy.”</p><p>“Cultivator Yun.”</p><p>Lu Ye ignored Wu Jun and called out to Yun Qingyue softly.</p><p>Yun Qingyue immediately showed an attentive attitude. “Please speak, Cultivator Lu.”</p><p>“If the Thousand Demon Ridge is troubled by my demands, we can invalidate my previous proposal. Resources are convenient, so just give me something worth three hundred thousand Contribution Points.”</p><p>Rather than show a happy expression, Yun Qingyue’s expression became much more serious. “Does Cultivator Lu still have any other conditions?”</p><p>The sudden change in Lu Ye’s stance indicated that something was waiting for her.</p><p>“Give me another Golden Body Token, and we’ll consider the matter settled!”</p><p>Certainly it was true that more than one Golden Body Token existed in the world. Lu Ye obtained one in the Carnage Colosseum, so Thousand Demon Ridge probably had reserves, too, though not in large numbers.</p><p>This was a life-saving trump card for any cultivator. After experiencing its power, Lu Ye had been unable to forget it.</p><p>Compared to the loss of a Golden Body Token, the one hundred thousand Contribution Points he spent on the Divine Opportunity Column in the Carnage Colosseum was negligible.</p><p>Contribution Points could be accumulated slowly, but Golden Body Tokens were not easily obtainable.</p><p>“You jest, Cultivator Lu. I have never even seen a Golden Body Token in my life, so where would I find one for you?” Wu Jun’s face darkened.</p><p>And even if they did have one, the Thousand Demon Ridge wouldn’t possibly give it to Lu Ye. The Golden Body Token was valuable even for Divine Ocean Realm cultivators since it was a divine protection bestowed by the Heavens. Before its time limit, no one could break through its defense.</p><p>“In that case, there’s no need to say more. The two options are before you, so just choose for yourselves!”</p><p>Wu Jun shouted, “Yi Ye, we came here to discuss with you in good faith. Don’t try to take advantage of us!”</p><p>Lu Ye’s fingers touched the Inviolable Saber, and his eyes were slightly downcast. “Do you think the Thousand Demon Ridge will seek revenge for you if I kill the two of you here? Unless, are you curious to know whether I can actually kill you or not?!”</p><p>Wu Jun and Yun Qingyue’s expressions changed, both of them becoming alert.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ye showed no signs of attacking them. However, it was evident that he was getting impatient, and if they lingered here, this young man might actually make his move.</p><p>If they really died here, the trip would have been pointless. Yi Ye’s hands were already stained with the blood of Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators, and two more casualties wouldn’t matter.</p><p>At this thought, Yun Qingyue spoke, “We will report our discussion with Cultivator Lu back as soon as possible, and we will come again to inform you of any results.”</p><p>Saying so, she signaled to Wu Jun with her eyes, then they both flew away from Skysword Peak together.</p><p>After flying a dozen kilometers away, Yun Qingyue took in a long breath, her chest rising high before falling again. In that moment, she truly felt that she had had a brush with death.</p><p>She never imagined that as a Real Lake Realm cultivator, she would be so powerless in front of a Cloud River Realm cultivator.</p><p>Not far away from her, Wu Jun’s expression seemed normal, but there was also a trace of fear in his eyes.</p><p>“Send a message back and see what the Divine Ocean Realm Masters decide,” Yun Qingyue said.</p><p>Wu Jun nodded in silence.</p><p>Without delay, they relayed the result of their negotiation to the cultivators back at their own Outposts, who would then pass it back to Jiu Zhou.</p><p>However, both of them knew that the Thousand Demon Ridge was likely to suffer heavy losses again this time, unless they dared to ignore Yi Ye’s threat.</p><p>But would anyone dare to ignore him?</p><p>As he said, he wouldn’t attack all the Outposts, just select a few of them. Who would dare to bet that their Outpost wouldn’t become one of the unlucky ones?</p><p>That was not something they could gamble on!</p><p>The most pressing matter was, if Yi Ye went directly to one of the Thousand Demon Ridge’s Outposts and asked for a peace offering, then threatened to attack their Outpost if they didn’t pay up, what would one do in such a situation?</p><p>Give in to his demands, of course! Compared to the amount they had spent on their own Outpost, what was a few hundred thousand Contributions worth of resources worth?</p><p>As such, Lu Ye only needed to spend some time to visit each Outpost one by one and he could still achieve his goal without completely disrupting the balance of the Spirit Creek Battlefield.</p><p>They didn’t have to wait long, and in less than half a day, they got a response.</p><p>Sure enough, the Divine Ocean Realm Masters compromised. They had no choice, and even though it was shameful, they had no capital to refuse.</p><p>In response, however, the Thousand Demon Ridge also had their own demands. The message clearly stated that if Yi Ye couldn’t accept these demands, then the Thousand Demon Ridge was prepared for a mutually destructive ending. At that time, they would abandon all their Outposts and gather the forces in the Core Circle to destroy all the Grand Sky Coalition’s Outposts as well.</p><p>To let both jade and stone burn together in complete destruction could also be seen as the last resort of the Thousand Demon Ridge.</p><p>After reading the message, Yun Qingyue sighed. She didn’t know whether Yi Ye would accept these demands either. Strictly speaking, the Thousand Demon Ridge was the disadvantaged party, and if Yi Ye refused, nobody could do anything to him about it.</p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Yun Qingyue said, “Senior Brother Wu, I’ll go by myself this time, you wait here.”</p><p>With the negotiation coming to a close, there was no need for the tough guy to appear anymore in case it stiffened the atmosphere later.</p><p>“How could I just stay behind? What if Yi Ye tries to harm you? How would you defend yourself then?” Wu Jun shook his head immediately.</p><p>Yun Qingyue said, “With his strength, even if you and I join forces, we would still be no match for him if he decides to attack.”</p><p>What she said left a bitter taste in Wu Jun’s mouth, yet he could not refute her…</p><p>“Senior Brother Wu, just wait for me here. I’ll be back soon. That Yi Ye doesn’t seem like someone who can’t be reasoned with.”</p><p>“In that case, be careful, Junior Sister. Keep in touch with me at all times.” Wu Jun nodded.</p><p>Yun Qingyue took out her flower basket Spirit Artifact and flew away.</p><p>In a short while, she arrived at Skysword Peak again, and the young man was still sitting in the same place, holding a roll of paper which he studied attentively.</p><p>The sunlight broke through the sea of clouds and shone on the young man’s profile, giving him a somewhat scholarly air.</p><p>However, this was the man who was giving the entirety of the great Thousand Demon Ridge faction an extreme headache. Moreover, he was currently holding a butcher’s blade over their heads, preparing to take a slice out of the Thousand Demon Ridge.</p><p>When his blade came down, none of the Core Circle Sects of the Thousand Demon Ridge could escape.</p><p>“Cultivator Lu,” Yun Qingyue called out in a soft voice before tucking her hair behind her ear, and her already impeccable appearance seemed to gain another hint of charm.</p><p>“Have they come to a decision?” Lu Ye didn’t even lift his head and continued poring through the contents of his slips, which made Yun Qingyue feel as if she had launched her fist only for it to land on cotton.</p><p>“The Divine Ocean Realm Masters have discussed the conditions, and they can agree to Cultivator Lu’s demands. However, they also have one request. If Cultivator Lu can agree to that request, then we will send everything you asked for within two days.”</p><p>“Speak!”</p><p>“The Thousand Demon Ridge hopes that Cultivator Lu will never return to Spirit Creek Battlefield in the future!”</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
