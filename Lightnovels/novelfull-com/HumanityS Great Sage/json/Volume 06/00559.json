He thought it would take some persuading, but he never expected it to be so cooperative with him.</p><p>However, creating a Tattoo required specific materials, and different Tattoos required different materials which must all be meticulously chosen.</p><p>The materials generally consisted of a mixture of beast blood and medicinal fluids, and each Tattoo Artist prepared their own blend of the mixture in different proportions, their own exclusive formula.</p><p>Lu Ye had access to various Tattoo formulas, naturally from Lady Yun, and they were all of excellent quality.</p><p>However, the Storm Shade and Venomous Python blood he collected previously were not suitable for tattooing Sharp Edge, and it would be impractical to go out and buy or collect more at this time.</p><p>After some thought, Lu Ye came up with an idea.</p><p>Since it wasn’t feasible to go out and buy or collect the materials, he decided to summon a Divine Opportunity Column directly and use it to purchase some from the Vault of Providence.</p><p>He had already planned to summon a Divine Opportunity Column before, but time had been so short that he hadn’t had the opportunity to act on it yet.</p><p>While summoning a Divine Opportunity Column was costly, having one around was a lifesaver in case of an unavoidable crisis. The cultivators of the Arcane Glade could use it to escape back to Jiu Zhou, so it was worth the high cost.</p><p>In addition, the Arcane Glade was located deep within the Grand Wilds Peak, making it an inconvenience to interact with the outside world, like if there was a need to buy something… such as in this case, Lu Ye could connect directly to the Vault of Providence without leaving the area to find the Divine Trade Association.</p><p>Most large Primus-level Arcane Glades have their own Divine Opportunity Columns for the convenience of the cultivators’ needs.</p><p>Smaller Arcane Glades rarely possessed the means to summon a Divine Opportunity Column, but an exception was probably going to appear today.</p><p>Once he made up his mind, Lu Ye respectfully requested for a Divine Opportunity Column.</p><p>Having already summoned a Divine Opportunity Column once in the Carnage Colosseum, the second time naturally went much smoother for Lu Ye.</p><p>As Lu Ye spoke, a blue light shot up into the air from the back of his hand, followed by the descent of a majestic object from the sky, creating a powerful aura that swept through the surroundings.</p><p>Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan, who were both cultivating in their respective rooms, were startled by the commotion and quickly came out to investigate.</p><p>Upon seeing the appearance of a new Divine Opportunity Column in front of Lu Ye, Li Baxian’s eyes twitched. “Little Junior Brother, did you summon another Divine Opportunity Column?”</p><p>For a single cultivator in the Cloud River Realm to summon two Divine Opportunity Columns, and with only a little over a month between each summoning, was probably unprecedented.</p><p>One Divine Opportunity Column was worth 100,000 Contribution Points, so two columns equaled 200,000 Contribution Points.</p><p>Which Cloud River Realm cultivator was so wealthy?</p><p>Li Baxian couldn’t help but sigh in amazement at how wealthy his Little Junior Brother was. He really couldn’t be compared. Then, when he thought about the two Point Restoration Pills Lu Ye bought him that cost 300,000 Contribution Points each… he realized that he was miserably poor as the Senior Brother in comparison to him.</p><p>“En. There’s something I want to buy,” Lu Ye casually explained. He placed his hand on the Divine Opportunity Column and connected his consciousness to the Vault of Providence.</p><p>Feng Yuechan sighed, “Truly, with wealth comes freedom to do anything one pleases.”</p><p>To summon a Divine Opportunity Column just so he could buy something from the Vault of Providence, this level of extravagance was unsurpassed.</p><p>However, they couldn’t compare with him on such matters. Even though they were disciples of the Second Tier Sect, the Devoted Ones, with a large family came many mouths to feed, and even for a pampered disciple like Feng Yuechan, the resources allocated to her were still limited. Often, they had to find ways to acquire cultivation resources themselves.</p><p>But Lu Ye was different. He practically built up the entire Crimson Blood Sect on his own, and with his position and strength as the overlord of the Spirit Creek Battlefield, he received plenty of benefits there.</p><p>The Crimson Blood Sect was wealthy because of him, so nobody restricted him whenever he used some of the resources.</p><p>Once they confirmed there was no external threat, Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan returned to their rooms to continue cultivating.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lu Ye stayed in the Vault of Providence for a while and quickly acquired the various materials he needed.</p><p>Summoning a Divine Opportunity Column cost 100,000 Contribution Points, but purchasing the materials only cost him less than 1,000 Contribution Points…</p><p>Checking his battlefield information, the Contribution Points section displayed the number: 83,520.</p><p>Through selling various resources in the Spirit Creek Battlefield, Lu Ye had accumulated around 300,000 Contribution Points. However, he quickly spent a large portion of that buying Flames of Earthen Spirits and various other flames. He also bought a Spirit Storage Ring. After entering the Cloud River Battlefield, he also bought many Mutant Cores for Amber to eat as snacks, so he was left with just over 180,000 Contribution Points.</p><p>Now, he had once again spent more than 100,000 Contribution Points.</p><p>All his spending was still worth it in the end. With a Divine Opportunity Column in the Arcane Glade, they could enter anytime from the outside world, and they would be sent directly into the Arcane Glade itself.</p><p>With the various materials now in his possession, Lu Ye followed Lady Yun’s formula and processed them. It was his first time doing this, so it was inevitable that he would be slightly clumsy. Fortunately, it wasn’t too complicated. In an incense stick of time, three bottles of differently-coloured Tattoo materials appeared before him.</p><p>One was golden, one was ochre, and one was cyan.</p><p>The Wolf Mutant with the blue flower on its head was still squatting next to Lu Ye.</p><p>Lu Ye raised his hand and pointed to the golden bottle, saying, “This one is this type!” As he spoke, Glyph: Sharp Edge was formed in his hand, emitting a faint brilliance and exuding a sharp aura.</p><p>Then, he pointed to the ochre bottle and said, “This one is this type!”</p><p>The Glyph transformed into Glyph: Protection, emanating a sturdy protective force.</p><p>Finally, he pointed to the cyan bottle and said, “And the last one is this type.”</p><p>The Glyph transformed into Glyph: Windwalk, and a sense of agility and lightness appeared throughout his entire palm.</p><p>“So, little one, which one do you want?”</p><p>Whether it was Sharp Edge, Protection, or Windwalk, they were among the simple and practical Glyphs that Lu Ye initially obtained, and he had practiced them many times on himself. While he couldn’t guarantee a perfect success rate, eighty to ninety percent was still doable since these three Glyphs were not complicated.</p><p>Originally, Lu Ye just wanted to try Glyph: Sharp Edge on the Wolf Mutant, but now that he had enough materials, he could provide it with more choices.</p><p>Even though the Wolf Mutant couldn’t understand human speech, it possessed sentience and could naturally understand Lu Ye’s simple gestures.</p><p>After Lu Ye finished speaking, it raised its paw and tapped the golden bottle.</p><p>Lu Ye nodded. With its fierce and aggressive nature, it was natural for the Wolf Mutant to pursue the ultimate attack.</p><p>Since it made a choice, Lu Ye naturally had to fulfill its request. After all, it was his first client… even if it were a Mutant Beast that couldn’t speak.</p><p>Lu Ye made up his mind to give it a good experience.</p><p>The question was where to make the Tattoo.</p><p>Glyph: Sharp Edge was an offensive Glyph, so there were only two suitable locations, and those were the claws and the mouth.</p><p>Over the past few days, Lu Ye had witnessed the play fights among the Wolf Mutants. Their sharp claws and teeth were their natural weapons. Judging by the commotion they created, anyone would think they were fighting to the death, but based on Lu Ye’s observations, they were in fact merely honing their skills through this method.</p><p>Looking at the Wolf Mutant in front of him with the blue flower on its head, its strength was undoubtedly relatively low compared to the rest of the pack. Its Spiritual Essence was not particularly rich, probably only at the level of the Fourth or Fifth Order Cloud River Realm. It often suffered disadvantages in battles with other races.</p><p>After carefully observing the Wolf Mutant in front of him, Lu Ye made up his mind.</p><p>He chose to Tattoo its mouth as the Wolf Mutant relied more on its teeth than its claws.</p><p>Raising his hand, Lu Ye squeezed its wolf mouth shut and turned to Amber. “Tell it that it might feel a bit of pain and to keep still.”</p><p>Amber immediately let out a growl.</p><p>Disdain flashed in the Wolf Mutant’s eyes, clearly not taking Amber’s warning to heart.</p><p>Once everything was prepared, Lu Ye’s expression turned serious.</p><p>Despite having tried it on his own body with many successful attempts, it was still just practice.</p><p>Strictly speaking, this was his first real Tattoo, so he definitely couldn’t allow it to fail.</p><p>The needle was placed right by his side. Lu Ye held the wolf’s mouth firmly with one hand and swiftly took out a needle, dipped it in the material from the bottle, and quickly pricked into its skin at lightning speed.</p><p>The source of this c𝓸ntent is frёeweɓηovel.coɱ.</p><p>His concentration reached its peak at this moment. When the needle came down, his Spiritual Power surged slightly, and the first primary element was formed.</p><p>Removing the needle, replacing it, dipping it in the material again, and then piercing again. At the moment the second primary element formed, it perfectly merged with the first one.</p><p>Lu Ye’s movements were extremely fast but orderly. With the fall of each needle, a small, arrowhead-shaped golden mark slowly took shape on the wolf’s mouth.</p><p>The composition of Glyph: Sharp Edge didn’t involve a large number of Yin-Yang elements, only a few dozen.</p><p>So, Lu Ye was able to finish his work in less than a short thirty breaths. When the final needle came down and the final primary element was formed, the golden mark that had come into form emitted a faint light.</p><p>The Wolf Mutant hadn’t moved at all throughout the process. There wasn’t even a flicker in its eyes. Obviously, the pain during the Tattooing process meant nothing to it.</p><p>Lu Ye let out a breath and released its maw.</p><p>Carefully looking at it, it seemed that a golden tattoo had appeared on the Wolf Mutant’s mouth, giving it a standout look.</p><p>This was a Visible Tattoo, and it was not permanent. It was of the same type as the Glyph: Wings Tattoo that Lu Ye had initially obtained.</p><p>Lu Ye’s proficiency in the Way of Tattoos was not particularly high. Being able to achieve this level was already his limit. In the future, when his skills improved, he would be able to create Hidden or Permanent Tattoos, but of course, those would require different materials.</p><p>The Wolf Mutant eyed Lu Ye with suspicion since it didn’t feel any particular change in itself.</p><p>“Activate your Mutant powers and give it a try,” Lu Ye said.</p><p>The Wolf Mutant understood and immediately activated its Spirit Essence. In the next moment, the golden mark on its mouth shimmered, causing its sharp teeth to emit a faint glow, adding a sense of sharpness. It bared its teeth at Lu Ye, appearing quite imposing.</p><p>Lu Ye slapped it aside and said, “Go play by yourself.”</p><p>Having become familiar with each other, there was no need for him to be courteous with it.</p><p>With his first Tattoo a perfect success, Lu Ye was in a good mood.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
