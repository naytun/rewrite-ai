The first time he came in contact with them, these people left a deep impression on Lu Ye.</p><p>It was at the Spirit Creek Battlefield’s Goldentip where he had his final battle against a Sacred Child from Cult Blackfyre, who had crippled her own Spiritual Points, causing her cultivation to drop from the Seventh Order to the Sixth Order.</p><p>The battle was extremely fierce, and both sides fought until they were spent like dried-up oil lamps. In the end, he used up the last trace of his Spiritual Power to unleash the Fire Phoenix Technique and finally killed his opponent.</p><p>Later, in the inner circle, when they pulled together a coalition force called the Grand Sky Coalition, Lu Ye specifically led the coalition to destroy Cult Blackfyre’s Outpost since his senior sister had mentioned that Cult Blackfyre had a deep grudge against the Crimson Blood Sect!</p><p>Now, with the sudden appearance of someone that seemed to be a member of the Universe Clan and the fact that there was a Sacred Universe Arcane Glade controlled jointly by Cult Blackfyre and the Universe Clan a few thousand kilometers away, it was inevitable that Li Baxian would make various connections.</p><p>“If this person truly hails from the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade, we might be facing quite the trouble in the near future,” Li Baxian said.</p><p>Leaving aside everything else, a relatively large First Tier sect had been forcefully knocked down and had only recently recovered to the Fourth Tier. There was nothing that could resolve such a grudge. Once the people from Cult Blackfyre learned of Lu Ye’s current location, they would surely take action.</p><p>“Let’s just wait and see what happens before we do anything.” Lu Ye’s gaze flickered.</p><p>He had thought that with a Primus-level Arcane Glade, he could peacefully cultivate here with Li Baxian and the others. However, contrary to his wishes, it hadn’t been long before Xia Liang, Tan Sheng, and others launched an attack on them, and now they might be targeted by the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade as well…</p><p>But Lu Ye was unfettered. Within the Arcane Glade was the Divine Opportunity Column he had invited, along with numerous Wards and a pack of Mutant Wolves to stand guard. The worst-case scenario would be the Arcane Glade being breached, and he and Li Baxian would be forced to retreat to Jiu Zhou.</p><p>“Did he transmit any messages before dying?” Li Baxian asked.</p><p>Lu Ye nodded. “Yes, but I’m not sure if it was successful or not.”</p><p>When this guy named Yan Gui sensed that something was wrong, he suddenly pressed on his Battlefield Imprint. Even though Lu Ye killed him quickly, he had no idea whether he had managed to transmit the message successfully or not.</p><p>“Prepare for the worst and respond appropriately,” Li Baxian said, and the three quickly returned to the Arcane Glade.</p><p>Amber was sound asleep, mainly because Lu Ye had fed it the Mutant Core of that elite-level Spirit Beast.</p><p>Lu Ye had already opened the Storage Bag he scavenged from the Fox Mutant, and the harvest was quite substantial. There were hundreds of Mutant Cores alone.</p><p>It wasn’t surprising that she had accumulated so many of these Mutant Cores considering how the Fox Mutant had been lording over Fox Immortal Valley for twenty years.</p><p>Amber had swallowed many Mutant Cores before, but there hadn’t been much of a reaction. However, after swallowing the Mutant Core of the Berserk Giant Ape, it soon fell into a deep sleep. Apparently, the power contained within that Mutant Core was too strong, and Amber needed to enter into a deep sleep in order to refine it.</p><p>As a result, Yi Yi also entered a silenced state.</p><p>However, Lu Ye was quite excited about the abnormal reaction. Once Amber woke up, it would definitely have experienced significant gains, perhaps even achieving a breakthrough. fгee𝑤ebɳoveɭ.cøm</p><p>The Sacred Universe Arcane Glade.</p><p>Tu Guanxiong suddenly felt a response from his Battlefield Imprint and quickly investigated it. He discovered that it was a message sent by Yan Gui, who had left a few days ago. The message was very simple, consisting of just two words.</p><p>“Yi Ye…”</p><p>It wasn’t that Yan Gui didn’t want to send a longer message, he just didn’t have the time. Being able to transmit these two words was already his limit.</p><p>And, just as Tu Guanxiong finished reading the cryptic message, Yan Gui’s Battlefield Imprint disappeared completely.</p><p>Tu Guanxiong’s expression changed.</p><p>The disappearance of the Battlefield Imprint was undoubtedly a sign of Yan Gui’s demise, something he had never expected. After all, Yan Gui was in the Seventh Order and, as a Ghost Cultivator, excelled in concealing his presence. Unless he exposed himself voluntarily, even encountering a Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivator wouldn’t pose much danger to him.</p><p>This was also the reason why he was confident to allow Yan Gui to take action.</p><p>He was simply sent to investigate the situation in Ameliorate Valley, so how did he suddenly meet his demise like this?</p><p>But the message Yan Gui sent before his death was without a doubt an indication that he had encountered Yi Ye. In other words, the information Huo Liaoyuan had previously obtained was true!</p><p>Yi Ye was in Ameliorate Valley!</p><p>“Damn it!” Tu Guanxiong muttered through gritted teeth, feeling extremely heartbroken over the inexplicable death of his Junior Brother.</p><p>Suppressing his grief, Tu Guanxiong left the room and found Huo Liaoyuan to inform him of Yan Gui’s fate.</p><p>Huo Liaoyuan was greatly surprised. “Yan Gui is dead?”</p><p>Tu Guanxiong answered in a grim voice, “He’s dead.”</p><p>The disappearance of his Battlefield Imprint was the most definitive proof.</p><p>Huo Liaoyuan’s lips squirmed, but in the end, he could only say, “My condolences.”</p><p>“Yan Gui cannot die in vain!” Tu Guanxiong spat coldly.</p><p>Huo Liaoyuan nodded. “Of course, we won’t let him die in vain. Since Yi Ye is indeed in Ameliorate Valley, I will round up some men to kill him at once!”</p><p>“If the information about Yi Ye being in Ameliorate Valley is true, then the rest should also be true. Dealing with a few hundred Wolf Mutants won’t be easy. Brother Huo, if the numbers are lacking, then success may not necessarily be guaranteed!”</p><p>Huo Liaoyuan nodded. “Rest assured, I will send out a message and have the nearby acolytes of my Cult Blackfyre to gather in Ameliorate Valley. In addition, I will also bring half of the men in the Arcane Glade with me!”</p><p>Just half the Arcane Glade cultivators alone would make up fifty people. If the cultivators gathered by Cult Blackfyre were included, it would easily form a force of a hundred people. With such a lineup, they did have a chance against Ameliorate Valley… Only if the information they possessed was correct.</p><p>“Take seventy percent!” Tu Guanxiong said. “If we’re going to take action, we must crush them with absolute power!”</p><p>Huo Liaoyuan wanted to say that it might not be necessary, but when he saw the hatred in Tu Guanxiong’s eyes, he ended up nodding. “I will personally kill Yi Ye and bring back his head.”</p><p>Tu Guanxiong said, “Brother Huo, it’s best not to be careless. During the last battle in the Carnage Colosseum, Yi Ye used the Divine Opportunity Column to escape to Jiu Zhou. There’s no telling if he has the ability to summon the Divine Opportunity Column again.”</p><p>“I have heard of the incident in the Carnage Colosseum. The main reason he was able to escape was not due to the Divine Opportunity Column, but the protection of the Golden Body Token. No one could break it. This time, however, he doesn’t have the Golden Body Token anymore. Even if he summons the Divine Opportunity Column, he may not have a chance to escape back to Jiu Zhou,” Huo Liaoyuan said, a cold smile forming on his face. “Furthermore, don’t forget, Brother Tu, I still have that in my hands. As long as I find an opportunity, his fate is sealed!”</p><p>Tu Guanxiong was momentarily taken aback, then he seemed to remember something and nodded slightly. “That’s true, but it seems… a bit wasteful to use that on Yi Ye.”</p><p>“I will assess the situation and act accordingly. Just wait for my good news, Brother Tu.”</p><p>With a firm resolution in mind, Huo Liaoyuan immediately took action. He gathered all the members of the Arcane Glade who were not in secluded cultivation and selected seventy percent of them.</p><p>Then, Huo Liaoyuan continuously sent out messages to summon the scattered Cult Blackfyre acolytes and instructed them to converge on the outskirts of Grand Wilds Peak.</p><p>Just an hour later, a huge Spirit Boat soared into the sky and flew towards Grand Wilds Peak.</p><p>In the Spirit Creek Battlefield, this kind of large Spirit Boat capable of carrying many cultivators was not uncommon, especially in the inner and core circles. Almost every Sect Outpost had one.</p><p>Although the massive Spirit Boat couldn’t match the flying speed of smaller Flight-Type Artifacts, it wasn’t too slow either. It was an essential tool for any Sects or factions to travel together.</p><p>However, in the Cloud River Battlefield, such large Flight-Type Artifacts were rarely seen, and that was because there were rarely situations where a large number of Cloud River Realm cultivators gathered together. Only some of the larger Arcane Glades were equipped with such Flight-Type Artifacts in preparation for occasional needs.</p><p>Tu Guanxiong saw off the Spirit Boat. Even though he wanted to seek revenge personally, someone had to stay behind to defend at the Arcane Glade. With Huo Liaoyuan having that in his possession, he had to be the one to lead the army.</p><p>As the Spirit Boat set off, a couple of eyes silently observed it from dozens of kilometers away.</p><p>It was Xia Liang and Tan Sheng. After a few days of rest, both of them had mostly recovered.</p><p>“Brother Xia’s intuition is impeccable. The Sacred Universe Arcane Glade couldn’t resist and made a massive move, and it seems the information hasn’t been completely leaked.”</p><p>Xia Liang snorted, “When profits are involved, how could they bear to let the information leak? If that were to happen, everyone would want a share of the spoils.”</p><p>“Should we set off, too?”</p><p>“Let’s go.”</p><p>The two of them didn’t follow the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade’s Spirit Boat. After all, they already knew the location of Ameliorate Valley and could reach there ahead of time to lie in wait.</p><p>Within the Arcane Glade, all was quiet.</p><p>Li Baxian and the others were cultivating, Amber was still asleep, and Lu Ye was fiddling with a broken arrow in his hands, examining it repeatedly.</p><p>This broken arrow belonged to Wei Que. Back when he was on the verge of death, he sacrificed this arrow, which erupted with tremendous power. Even Ju Jia’s body couldn’t withstand its attack and was pierced through.</p><p>Later, Lu Ye and Li Baxian chased the heavily injured Tan Sheng and Xia Liang while Feng Yuechan stayed behind to take care of Ju Jia and kept the broken arrow.</p><p>The object seemed to have been around for quite some time, but it was unclear where Wei Que had obtained it.</p><p>However, according to Feng Yuechan, this broken arrow was an Exotic Treasure.</p><p>Exotic Treasures were treasures the grades of which were difficult to evaluate based on ordinary standards.</p><p>For example, the Golden Body Token that Lu Ye used in Carnage Colosseum, as well as the Tracking Disc Tan Sheng used to trace his location, were both Exotic Treasures.</p><p>Jiu Zhou had a considerable number of Exotic Treasures, most of which emerged from the Hidden Realms, while some were bestowed by the Heavens. Anything related to these treasures couldn’t be judged by common sense and often possessed various strange and unique functions.</p><p>Take this broken arrow, for example. According to Lu Ye’s examination, it didn’t have many restrictions but was equivalent to a Top Grade Spirit Artifact.</p><p>However, no Top Grade Spirit Artifact could unleash such lethal power. After all, even Ju Jia’s defenses couldn’t stop it.</p><p>And this was just a broken arrow!</p><p>It was hard to imagine the power it would possess if it were intact.</p><p>A crack had formed on the broken arrow, indicating that it couldn’t be used many more times. The reason Feng Yuechan gave it to Lu Ye was because activating this object required an enormous amount of Spiritual Power. Even though she had reached the Sixth Order Cloud River Realm, unleashing the power of this broken arrow would still likely deplete all her Spiritual Power.</p><p>That was why it was challenging for her to make effective use of it.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
