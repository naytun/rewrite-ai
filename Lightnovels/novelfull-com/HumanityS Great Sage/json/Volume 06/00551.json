Once those were also covered in holes, he moved to his abdomen.</p><p>He had a strong body, so petty injuries like this would not affect him much. After just one night of rest, he could continue his practice again.</p><p>Due to the purple concoction, however, his body was covered in a purple color.</p><p>His skill grew little by little at a visible rate, allowing Lu Ye to Tattoo more and more primary elements.</p><p>In two days, he was able to Tattoo Glyph: Nine.</p><p>This type of numbered glyph was the most simple type of Glyph constructed with only nine primary elements, but even though it was a Glyph, it didn’t serve any special function and was used by new Glyphweavers to practice.</p><p>Lu Ye had practiced these before, but this time, he was practicing them again in the form of Tattoos, so the difficulty was undoubtedly much greater than before.</p><p>After a first successful experience, Lu Ye had undoubtedly gained a deeper understanding of the Way of Tattoos.</p><p>As time passed, the Glyphs that Lu Ye could Tattoo became more and more complex, and he had to say that Tattoos truly did drain the mind a great deal.</p><p>Right now, the Glyphs that he could Tattoo were only the most basic ones. Glyphs such as Void consisted of as many as 3,000 primary elements, which would equate to 3,000 jabs in total, during which he couldn’t make any mistakes or pause in any way. He had to complete all 3,000 at one go, which would be difficult for one to hold on if their Mental Power was lacking.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, inside the study several days later, following the last prick on his skin, a Tattoo formed on Lu Ye’s right arm.</p><p>This Tattoo was not a numerical Glyph, but Glyph: Sharp Edge, which he obtained from the Tree of Glyphs at the very beginning.</p><p>The shape of the Glyph was just like an arrow.</p><p>Being able to Tattoo a practical Glyph such as this one was undoubtable proof that Lu Ye had made it past the threshold in the Way of Tattoos. Now, the only thing left to do was keep on practicing to accumulate experience.</p><p>However, since the Tattoo was made entirely out of a medicinal concoction, it was not powerful enough to exert strength.</p><p>If a suitable mixture of animal blood and herbal juices were used, then it would truly become a real tattoo, and if Spiritual Power were poured into it, the Glyph would be able to bring about a sharpening power.</p><p>He breathed a long sigh of relief. It wasn’t until this moment that Lu Ye finally felt a trace of fatigue.</p><p>It had been more than half a month since he entered the Summit of Clarity, and he hadn’t rested at all during this time. Even if he had a strong body, it was not strange for him to not be able to hold up any longer.</p><p>It was time for him to bid farewell to Lady Yun.</p><p>To a cultivator, enhancing one’s cultivation realm was the most important thing for them. The Way of Glyphs was just an embellishment in the path of becoming stronger. Lu Ye had the talent and foundation, but he would not concentrate on the trifles and neglect the essentials simply because of this.</p><p>He took out the books he had finished reading from his Storage Sphere and placed them back on the bookshelf, then he looked for some books he hadn’t read before and stored them away.</p><p>Most of the books he chose this time were related to the Way of Tattoos. Since he had learnt the Way of Tattoos from Lady Yun, he would naturally make more effort on it in his spare time in the future.</p><p>He walked out of the book room and left to see Lady Yun.</p><p>Knowing the purpose of his visit, Lady Yun did not make him stay and only taught him a little more on the Way of Tattoos before letting him go.</p><p>Lu Ye bowed and thanked her.</p><p>After not seeing the sun for more than half a month, Lu Ye couldn’t help but squint as the sunlight washed over him.</p><p>Returning to the Summit of Bamboos, he took a bath before changing into a clean set of clothes. Then, Lu Ye fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>After cultivating to the Cloud River Realm, his need for sleep had become very low. When cultivators meditated, they were, in fact, in a state of semi-rest, and as long as the efficiency of their cultivation was high enough, they would come out of the session full of energy.</p><p>However, it was human nature to eat and sleep, this was a truth that even the most advanced of cultivators could not erase.</p><p>Lu Ye was eventually woken up by a wet tongue.</p><p>When he opened his eyes, he saw Amber’s head right in front of his face, its large tongue lapping happily at his face.</p><p>After pushing it away, Lu Ye sat up.</p><p>He had no idea how long he slept for, but the exhaustion had been cleared from his body, restoring him to a refreshed mood.</p><p>Fragrance of freshly prepared food wafted in from the outside, and when Lu Ye walked out out of curiosity, he found the table covered in rice and dishes that were still fresh and steaming.</p><p>The door had been opened, and Yi Yi walked in with another dish in hand. Upon seeing Lu Ye, she exclaimed in surprise, “Finally awake?”</p><p>Lu Ye answered with a hum before sitting down at the table, grabbing a pair of chopsticks, and digging in.</p><p>He was surprised. “Did you make this?”</p><p>Yi Yi giggled. “It was Second Senior Sister who made it, I just delivered them.”</p><p>He was wondering why the taste was completely the same as Second Senior Sister’s cooking. On second thought, Yi Yi didn’t even have this skill set to begin with.</p><p>While eating, he chatted idly with Yi Yi, and it didn’t take long for Lu Ye to scarf down the table full of food.</p><p>After eating his fill, he left Yi Yi to clean up the table while he went out to exercise his body.</p><p>After an hour, back in the hall, Lu Ye and Yi Yi sat opposite each other while Amber sat between the two of them.</p><p>“I’m starting now,” Lu Ye said to her.</p><p>Yi Yi responded in excitement, “I’m ready.” freēwēbηovel.c૦m</p><p>Lu Ye laughed and brought out his share of the Amulets, then casually crushed one of the white ones.</p><p>A white spiral emerged, from which pure Spiritual Power poured out in a dense, unscattered form, lingering around the two cultivators and the tiger. Just by breathing, they could take that energy into their bodies and use it to strengthen themselves.</p><p>White Amulets did not hold up for long, and it disappeared completely in less than an incense stick of time, then Lu Ye picked up another.</p><p>Once the White Amulets were exhausted, he started on the green ones, and once those were done, he went into the blues, then the purples, before finally moving onto the five Golden Amulets.</p><p>As the effects of the second Golden Amulet were about to deplete, Lu Ye distinctly felt the river of his Spiritual Power reaching a limit inside him, giving rise to that familiar sensation of fullness once again.</p><p>This was the sign of a breakthrough.</p><p>Previously, when he returned from the Myriad Beast Domain, he had broken through into the Third Order and even moved slightly further beyond that. Later, he also obtained a purple Amulet from Xia Qianqian. Coupled with days of consuming Spirit Pills, he was now not far from reaching the Fourth Order.</p><p>Now, breaking through was just a natural progression.</p><p>More power was being consumed and refined as it flawed into his body, enhancing the volume of his River of Spiritual Power.</p><p>Until a certain moment, Lu Ye felt a surge in his River of Spiritual Power. Right after, that sense of fullness suddenly disappeared as if something had been shattered, replaced by an indescribable sense of contentment.</p><p>A wave of energy surged in all directions. He had advanced into the Fourth Order Cloud River Realm!</p><p>In comparison to his previous advancement, going from the Third Order to the Fourth Order undoubtedly took longer, primarily due to the recent distractions. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been delayed this much.</p><p>If he had possessed cultivation at the level of the Fourth Order Cloud River Realm during his time at the Carnage Colosseum, then slaying the Seventh Order He Bing would not have been so troublesome. However, Lu Ye was reluctant to use his Amulets to enhance his strength in the Carnage Colosseum as a single golden Amulet could last for a full day and night. It would be a waste if he encountered enemies during that process.</p><p>Almost simultaneous with his advancement into the Fourth Order Cloud River Realm, Yi Yi and Amber also experienced changes.</p><p>A sudden flash of light emerged on the surface of Yi Yi’s body, and Amber’s vitality surged for an instant.</p><p>Clearly, they had also made a breakthrough!</p><p>However, Yi Yi was an apparition and Amber was a Spirit Beast, which made it difficult to define their progress by cultivation realms. Still, judging by the fluctuations in their Spiritual Power, they had undoubtedly entered the Second Order of the Cloud River Realm.</p><p>There were still three golden Amulets remaining, so they continued cultivating.</p><p>Three days later, all the Amulets had been consumed.</p><p>None of them experienced another breakthrough during that period. Lu Ye was still in the Fourth Order, but after consuming three Golden Amulets, he had accumulated considerable progress within his new minor realm.</p><p>As for Amber and Yi Yi, they were on the brink of teaching the Third Order. With a bit more dedicated cultivation, they should be able to make a breakthrough.</p><p>As his cultivation advanced, resource consumption grew. Naturally, the more Amulets he could get, the better.</p><p>The Amulets that Lu Ye acquired had to be shared with both Yi Yi and Amber. Fortunately, he wasn’t very demanding when it came to his cultivation environment. While a favorable environment was beneficial, it wasn’t essential. He just had to consume Spirit Pills. This advantage was something most cultivators couldn’t hope to gain.</p><p>Several days had passed since his agreed-upon one-month deadline with Li Baxian, so it was time to return to the Cloud River Battlefield to meet with him. Even though he had six golden Amulets left, he had to hand them over to his Fourth Senior Brother and Feng Yuechan. After all, those were their possessions.</p><p>There was still that Primus-level Wisp of Sanctification that he had to place in a suitable location in the Cloud River Battlefield. While Lu Ye wasn’t so needy with his conditions, the same couldn’t be said for Yi Yi, not to mention his Fourth Senior Brother and Feng Yueshan, as well as Ju Jia…</p><p>Thinking of Ju Jia, Lu Ye’s eyes couldn’t help but twitch.</p><p>The last time he had been in contact with Ju Jia was nearly two months ago. At that time, Ju Jia had gotten lost in the Cloud River Battlefield, so Lu Ye instructed him to wait in a certain location. After so much time had passed, he had no idea how Ju Jia was faring.</p><p>Follow current novℯls on ƒгeewёbnovel.com.</p><p>Speaking of which, he had been in the Carnage Colosseum for almost twenty days, and Ju Jia hadn’t reached out to him…</p><p>After tidying up a bit, Lu Ye left the Summit of Bamboos with Amber and Yi Yi, quickly arriving at the Summit of Fortitude.</p><p>He met with Shui Yuan and informed her of his intention to enter the Cloud River Battlefield, which Shui Yuan did not oppose, only cautioning him to be careful. After all, for cultivators in the Cloud River Realm, training in the Cloud River Battlefield was the fastest way to advance as it was the only place to obtain Amulets.</p><p>After bidding farewell to Shui Yuan, Lu Ye headed straight to the Sanctum of Providence. He pressed his hand on the Divine Opportunity Column, then connected his consciousness to the Cloud River Battlefield.</p><p>In the next instant, a vast array of lights appeared in his consciousness. Each light represented a Divine Opportunity Column. Lu Ye could freely choose a light to enter the location of the respective Divine Opportunity Column.</p><p>Last time, it was through this method that he arrived directly in a Divine Trade Association.</p><p>However, amid the myriad of lights, one light was particularly distinct. While the others were white, this light was uniquely blue.</p><p>After a brief thought, Lu Ye realized that the blue light represented the Divine Opportunity Column he had called forth at the Carnage Colosseum!</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
