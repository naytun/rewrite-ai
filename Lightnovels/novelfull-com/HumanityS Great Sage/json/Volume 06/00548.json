If Shui Yuan were willing, she could pour the resources of her entire sect onto herself, an advantage that no Divine Ocean Realm Master could ever hope to match.</p><p>Lu Ye was only in the Cloud River Realm at this time so he didn‚Äôt have to worry too much about future matters. After all, it wouldn‚Äôt be too late to wait until he advanced into the Real Lake Realm before dealing with it.</p><p>Inside the Vault of Providence, Lu Ye dug through his Storage Sphere and sold some resources that he and his sect weren‚Äôt in need of fire now, and he saw his Contribution Points being raised at a visibly fast rate.</p><p>It wasn‚Äôt until he was close to the 300,000 Contribution Points mark that he finally stopped.</p><p>This much was more than enough for his own use. Even if he encountered some overwhelming danger in the future, he could summon a Divine Opportunity Column to escape.</p><p>Still, it wasn‚Äôt a guarantee to be able to escape just because he could summon a Divine Opportunity Column.</p><p>He had the protection of the Golden Body Token when he was in the Carnage Colosseum, and that was the reason why all those Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators failed to do anything to him. Without it, even if he did manage to summon a Divine Opportunity Column, he might not have been able to reach it.</p><p>So, that method could only be used when he could ensure that he had enough time and space to pull it off.</p><p>Then, Lu Ye bought some Flames of Earthen Spirits and swallowed them up piece by piece.</p><p>He had to hurry and replenish the Tree of Glyphs‚Äô fuel stock. He had only known previously that the Tree of Glyphs could burn toxins, but it was only now that he realized that the Tree of Glyphs could even burn the Judgement of the Heavens inside of him, so there was no saying what else it could burn in the future, and thus it was only natural that he should put more care into refueling it.</p><p>Time passed, and one by one, the Flames of Earthen Spirits were consumed.</p><p>To Lu Ye‚Äôs surprise, the leaves on the Tree of Glyphs didn‚Äôt react at all.</p><p>It wasn‚Äôt until he swallowed nearly two hundred Flames of Earthen Spirits that one of the leaves on the Tree of Glyphs showed any signs that it was beginning to burn.</p><p>Lu Ye guessed that his encounter this time had caused a crisis in the Tree of Glyphs, and so the Flames of Earthen Spirits he had consumed before had all been turned into fuel. It was only when he felt that his reserves were almost full that he began to see changes in the leaves.</p><p>It had been a long time since he had gotten any new Glyphs from the tree, so Lu Ye was naturally curious about what sort of Glyphs he would get next. So, he continued buying Flames of Earthen Spirits and devoured all of them.</p><p>After buying almost a hundred more pieces, Lu Ye was surprised to find that there were no more for him to buy!</p><p>This surprised him as it turned out that the stock of Flames of Earthen Spirits in the Vault of Providence actually had a limit.</p><p>He always thought that the goods in the Vault of Providence never ran out.</p><p>But come to think of it, he had simply taken it for granted. The things in the Vault of Providence did not come out of thin air. All of the treasures sold inside had to have come from somewhere.</p><p>The most widely rumored theory was that the contents in the Vault of Providence were related to the Divine Trade Association.</p><p>That was because someone had once sold something to the Divine Trade Association, only to find traces of it appearing in the Vault of Providence.</p><p>In that case, the Flames of Earthen Spirits should also have been collected by cultivators from somewhere before being sold to the Vault of Providence. Lu Ye wasn‚Äôt sure where these flames could be collected. The ones who used them either refined pills or Spirit Artifacts, so the purchase amount would not be too large, thus there was always a large stock available.</p><p>But when it came to him, he would buy several dozen to hundreds of these flames at a time. Even more outrageously, he had bought a few hundred this time and completely dried up the stock in the vault.</p><p>If Flames of Earthen Spirits were out, there should still be other flames.</p><p>Lu Ye searched the Vault of Providence for more of what he needed.</p><p>A few moments later, many things related to flames appeared in his field of vision.</p><p>However, each item was different, and most of the ones that appeared were Core Flames.</p><p>Core Flames were not used for refining pills. Instead, they were the Mutant Cores of fire attribute Spirit Beasts, and each core was just like a ball of flames.</p><p>The prices were also different for each one. The cheapest one started at five to six hundred, but there were also those that cost up to tens of thousands.</p><p>New novel chapters are published on freew—ëbn‡´¶ŒΩe…≠.com.</p><p>Among them, Lu Ye also noticed one that was called Paramount Glacial Flame, which should be a type of Mystic Flame. Just looking at it gave one a chilling feeling, and the flame even had a ghostly blue color.</p><p>This thing was also ridiculously expensive at 180,000 Contribution Points!</p><p>He couldn‚Äôt help but think of the True Phoenix Flame he had gotten in the Burning Lands.</p><p>If this thing was put into the Vault of Providence, then it would surely fetch a hefty price as well. Perhaps, its price may even be higher than this Paramount Glacial Flame. Since it was Lu Ye who got his hands on it, he would only use it for the consumption of the Tree of Glyphs, but others could use these flames to cultivate some special Secret Arts, and thus the value was naturally not the same as the rest.</p><p>Devouring the True Phoenix Flame added Glyph: Fire Phoenix to the Tree of Glyphs, so Lu Ye was curious to know what sort of changes the Tree of Glyphs would show if he were to devour the Paramount Glacial Flame.</p><p>However, the price of 180,000 Contribution Points was enough to dissuade him from that thought.</p><p>Even if he had the capital to afford it, he still decided to give up on it after some thought.</p><p>He couldn‚Äôt expect to get some sort of glacial Glyph by consuming this Paramount Glacial Flame. After all, such a Glyph didn‚Äôt exist in the world, and if he didn‚Äôt get a corresponding Glyph from it and simply used it as fuel, it would not be cost-effective.</p><p>Lu Ye didn‚Äôt stop until he bought up all of the flames that cost less than 1,000 Contribution Points. ∆íreeùë§ebnœÉvel.com</p><p>The total damage racked up to nearly 300,000 Contribution Points. To have spent so much at once, money truly did go as quickly as it came.</p><p>And this was only the Cloud River Realm. Once he arrived at the Real Lake Realm or the Divine Ocean Realm, he would really need to spend a lot of Contribution Points. Talent and qualifications were certainly important in the path of cultivation, but without sufficient financial support, it would still be difficult for one to raise their cultivation level quickly.</p><p>The Tree of Glyphs was still devouring the flames, but Lu Ye was prepared to save some as spares in case he encountered a situation where the Tree of Glyphs ran out of fuel again.</p><p>Immersing his mind, he saw the leaves on the Tree of Glyphs burning up one by one as the flames were consumed.</p><p>Lu Ye couldn‚Äôt help but be excited about what he would get.</p><p>Compared to the Glyphs that he learned from books, he could use the ones from the Tree of Glyphs at will, which often came with the possibility of increasing his strength in some way.</p><p>He continued searching through the Vault of Providence.</p><p>Next, he had to find Spirit Artifacts that could store Spiritual Power.</p><p>He had used Glyph: Fire Phoenix twice, and he remembered both experiences vividly in his mind.</p><p>He had to say that though this Glyph could set the tune with one beat of the gong at times, the price he had to pay in order to use this Glyph was also great.</p><p>The after-effects he could recuperate from as long as he had a safe place to rest afterwards.</p><p>However, the Spiritual Power that was needed to support this Glyph was terrifying, and that was a problem that had to be dealt with.</p><p>He‚Äôd used Glyph: Spirit Storage to complete the construction of this Glyph, but if he had a Spirit Artifact that could do the job, then it wouldn‚Äôt have to be as troublesome.</p><p>He could simply store Spiritual Power into the Spirit Artifact beforehand, then use it when he needed it.</p><p>All varieties of treasures could be found in the Vault of Providence, so there should be no shortage of the Spirit Artifact he needed.</p><p>Sure enough, hundreds of Spirit Artifacts appeared in Lu Ye‚Äôs vision after a moment. Even though they were all of different quality, the price differed as well. They were even in different shapes and sizes.</p><p>After browsing through them, Lu Ye finally settled on a ring.</p><p>A ring was easy to wear and not easy to lose. Moreover, it was of good quality equivalent to a Top Grade Spirit Artifact.</p><p>Within the realm of Spirit Artifacts, the quality of a Spirit Artifact was determined by how many Restraining Locks were built into it.</p><p>Below 9 Restraining Locks meant it was a Low Grade Spirit Artifact.</p><p>9 to 18 signified Middle Grade.</p><p>18 to 27 were High Grade.</p><p>And 27 to 36 were Top Grade.As the quality differed, the price naturally changed as well. Generally, Top Grade Spirit Artifacts cost between 1,500 and 2,000 Contribution Points in the Vault of Providence, but the difference was not too great.</p><p>From Lu Ye‚Äôs perspective, a mere thousand to two thousand Contribution Points were naturally nothing. He could simply spend it without worry.</p><p>However, for most Cloud River Realm cultivators, even a few thousand was a lot, especially since each cultivator needed more than one Spirit Artifact.</p><p>Spirit Artifacts had to be constantly replaced as their level of cultivation increased. So, cultivators tended to spend a lot of Contribution Points on their Spirit Artifacts.</p><p>Of course, it was possible to purchase them using Spirit Stones from the Divine Trade Association, but one had to first have enough of them in order to make the purchase. When it really came down to it, however, purchasing goods using Spirit Stones would actually be more expensive than spending Contribution Points.</p><p>The Spirit Storage Ring that Lu Ye chose was slightly ridiculous, costing a whopping 4,000 Contribution Points.</p><p>For one, Spirit Bank artifacts were special and not weapons for cultivators to fight with. Such Spirit Artifacts generally cost more than the usual Spirit Artifact since their numbers were limited.</p><p>Secondly, this was the smallest of the Spirit Bank Spirit Artifacts, and also the most portable, so it was naturally more expensive.</p><p>With the Spirit Storage Ring now in his possession, Lu Ye put it on his finger and found it to be very suitable. It didn‚Äôt affect his blade swings either, and it had the ability of absorbing and storing the Spiritual Power that usually drifted out from the surface of a cultivator‚Äôs body. So, even if Lu Ye didn‚Äôt actively pour Spiritual Power into it, as long as he wore it for a long enough period of time, it would be able to store a sufficient amount.</p><p>When Lu Ye needed it, it was much more efficient for him to extract Spiritual Power straight from the ring rather than using Spirit Pills to recover his power.</p><p>He had bought all that he needed to buy and sold all that needed to be sold.</p><p>Then, Lu Ye checked his Battlefield Imprint.</p><p>The Contribution column read: 193,643 Contribution Points.</p><p>Now, it was time for the main event.</p><p>The reward from the Carnage Colosseums‚Äô Roster of Carnage.</p><p>Since returning from the Carnage Colosseum, Lu Ye hadn‚Äôt bothered to deal with the reward. Instead, he headed straight into the Spirit Creek Battlefield as soon as he recovered.</p><p>Now, he finally had the time to check it.</p><p>When the Carnage Colosseum closed back then, the Heavens engraved a golden mark on the back of his hand. Through that mark, Lu Ye could link with the Vault of Providence from any Divine Opportunity Column and retrieve his reward there.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
