The flowing Spiritual Power on the barrier was dense and unwavering, showcasing the abundant Spiritual Qi of this place.</p><p>If before, Tan Sheng and the others only suspected that this might be Lu Ye’s hiding place, then after seeing this Grand Defensive Ward, their certainty increased by at least seventy to eighty percent! ƒreeωebnovel.ƈom</p><p>The strength of the Grand Defensive Ward was directly related to the density of World Spiritual Qi. The denser the Spiritual Qi, the stronger the Grand Defensive Ward’s power.</p><p>Considering the vast range and astonishing strength of this Ward, it indicated that the Spiritual Qi here was undoubtedly equivalent to that of a Primus-level Arcane Glade.</p><p>The first place reward of the Roster of Carnage was none other than a Primus-level Wisp of Sanctification!</p><p>However, due to the presence of Wards, the three of them could only see the barrier of the Grand Defensive Ward and not the situation inside.</p><p>If they could see through it, then they definitely wouldn’t have attacked with such momentum.</p><p>Because within the Arcane Glade at this moment were more than two hundred Wolf Mutants who all raised their heads to look at the three figures in the sky upon their disturbance. Some of them had even slightly lowered their bodies and were emitting threatening growls.</p><p>However, it wasn’t only the wolf pack that the commotion disturbed.</p><p>Li Baxian, Feng Yuechan, and Ju Jia all emerged from their cabins and looked up.</p><p>When their gazes swept over the three figures in the sky, Li Baxian was slightly astonished. “How did they find their way here?”</p><p>Li Baxian was naturally familiar with these three individuals. Tan Sheng and Xia Liang didn’t need to be mentioned. They had both climbed the Roll of Supremacy and had some interactions with Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan.</p><p>They had fought Wei Que last time in the Carnage Colosseum before, and it was with the Trap Ward that Lu Ye laid that they escaped from him in the end.</p><p>These three people appearing together in the sky above the Arcane Glade and attacking the Grand Ward clearly indicated their hostility. Moreover, from what they were shouting earlier, it seemed like they were specifically looking for their Little Junior Brother.</p><p>“Where’s Little Junior Brother?” Li Baxian didn’t see Lu Ye around, but Yi Yi had instead rushed out.</p><p>Yi Yi told him, “Lu Ye is honing his blade techniques in the Rift of Illusions.”</p><p>“At this time…” Li Baxian felt somewhat helpless. He knew that Lu Ye could enter the Rift of Illusions to cultivate using the seed of the Mystic Fruit since in recent days, he and Feng Yuechan would also occasionally use the seed to hone their combat skills against enemies in the rift.</p><p>So, he knew that if Lu Ye was in the Rift of Illusions, he wouldn’t be able to perceive the situation in the outside world, and there was nothing they could do but wait for him to come out on his own.</p><p>But if they continued waiting like this, the Grand Defensive Ward definitely wouldn’t hold up. The power that an uncontrolled Grand Ward could exert was limited, and the three Ninth Order Cloud River Realm experts were formidable in strength. It wouldn’t take long for them to forcibly break through the Grand Ward.</p><p>“Where is the Control Gem for the Grand Ward?” Li Baxian then asked.</p><p>“I’ll look for it.” While saying so, Yi Ye left in a flash.</p><p>She quickly returned with a Control Gem in hand. “Here it is.” She hastily handed it to Li Baxian.</p><p>Li Baxian accepted it and infused his Spiritual Power into it. After familiarizing himself with it, he began manipulating the World Spiritual Qi to control the Grand Ward.</p><p>In the current situation, Li Baxian wasn’t worried about Tan Sheng and the others entering the Arcane Glade. While they certainly weren’t a match for Tan Sheng and the others, they weren’t the only ones around. They also had a defense force of two to three hundred Wolf Mutants. If Tan Sheng and his group did break in, they would definitely suffer.</p><p>However, he couldn’t let them enter the Arcane Glade before Lu Ye emerged from the Rift of Illusions. Otherwise, if a chaotic battle broke out and Lu Ye was accidentally injured, that would be troublesome.</p><p>So, the best course of action now was to buy time until Lu Ye came out of the Rift of Illusions.</p><p>As he manipulated the Grand Ward, Tan Sheng and the others immediately sensed the movements.</p><p>As a result, their attacks grew even more ferocious. Tan Sheng even shouted repeatedly, “Give up, Yi Ye! Unless you can summon the Divine Opportunity Column again, this place will be your burial ground today!”</p><p>While speaking, he launched a relentless assault that caused ripples to spread continuously across the Grand Ward’s barrier.</p><p>There was no response from within the Grand Ward, but the more so that it was, the more Tan Sheng and the others became convinced that Lu Ye was inside. If it were someone else, they would have simply come out and explained the situation. It was precisely because it was Yi Ye inside the Grand Ward that he didn’t dare to show himself easily.</p><p>Moreover, they had been tracking Lu Ye’s whereabouts all the way here, and now they coincidentally encountered a Primus-level Arcane Glade with a Grand Ward of this level. There was no way such a coincidence could exist in this world.</p><p>Spiritual Power surged and the brilliance of the barrier flickered incessantly. Tan Sheng and his group were surprised at just how powerful this Grand Defensive Ward was. Despite attacking jointly, they still couldn’t break it.</p><p>However, even if they didn’t break through the Grand Ward, their attacks still had some effect since the light barrier of the Grand Defensive Ward was clearly dimmer compared to before.</p><p>If this continued, they would eventually break through the Grand Ward and would be able to launch a direct assault.</p><p>“Attack together!” Xia Liang shouted fiercely as he swung his blade.</p><p>The night was long, and who knew if Yi Ye would summon the Divine Opportunity Column? So, the sooner they broke through the Grand Ward, the better.</p><p>After Xia Liang’s blade came down, Wei Que’s spells quickly followed, and Tan Sheng joined in as well. Their relentless attacks landed on the same spot of the Grand Ward. Their precise coordination caused the targeted area on the barrier to flicker constantly.</p><p>Inside the Arcane Glade, the worry on Li Baxian’s face was growing deeper by the minute. Though he tried his best to maintain the Grand Ward’s function, he was not a Ward cultivator, and the Ward was not his creation either. His capabilities were limited, and at best, he could mobilize more power to sustain the area targeted by their attacks.</p><p>As his thoughts raced, he realized that he had no choice but to let these three reckless bastards in, then they’ll have the Wolf Mutants to deal with them.</p><p>Just as he was thinking this, Lu Ye’s voice suddenly sounded by his ear, “What’s going on?”</p><p>When Li Baxian turned around, he saw Lu Ye standing beside him, looking up at the sky. He exclaimed with joy, “Little Junior Brother, you’re finally awake.”</p><p>Lu Ye also noticed the fierce appearance of Tan Sheng and his group and couldn’t help but feel strange about it. “How did these three guys find their way here?”</p><p>And for all three to have come together!</p><p>His first thought was whether the Tracking Disc was still in effect, but upon careful consideration, it didn’t make sense since the Tracking Disc’s Secret Technique had already disappeared from him since the day he left the Carnage Colosseum and returned to Jiu Zhou. It didn’t make sense for it to still work after so long.</p><p>However, the three of them couldn’t have found their way here for no reason. Even though he had no idea how they had done it, they had obviously used a special Spirit Artifact similar to the Tracking Disc.</p><p>Enemies had come knocking on his door and were even attacking the Ward he had set up. Naturally, a battle was inevitable. Lu Ye turned his head and saw the Wolf Mutants looking up in the air, many of them were already baring their teeth in a ferocious show of hostility.</p><p>Seemingly sensing Lu Ye’s gaze, the leader of the pack turned its head to meet his eyes and nodded slightly.</p><p>Lu Ye felt relieved. After raising an army for a thousand days, it was finally time to put them to use. It was a wise decision to use the Wolf Mutants as the most sturdy defensive force of the Arcane Glade. While the Wolf Mutants were initially attracted to this place because of Ju Jia, over time, Lu Ye had also developed a peaceful relationship with them. Now that enemies had arrived, the Wolf Mutants would certainly not sit idly by.</p><p>Lu Ye received the Control Gem from Li Baxian, infused it with his Spiritual Power, and then began manipulating the Grand Ward. “Fourth Senior Brother, take Senior Sister Feng and Ju Jia to this location and wait.”</p><p>Saying so, he tossed out a Ward Flag, which flew out into the distance.</p><p>The Wards he had set up in Arcane Glade were not only Defensive and Concealment Wards, and the wolf pack definitely weren’t the Arcane Glade’s only measure of defense either.</p><p>Even though he could borrow the strength of the wolf pack, he never relied on them completely.</p><p>Li Baxian nodded and immediately led Feng Yuechan and Ju Jia in the direction the flag indicated.</p><p>In a short while, their figures were hidden following Lu Ye’s actions.</p><p>Yi Yi burrowed into the ground and waited for an opening while Amber leapt onto Lu Ye’s shoulder, ready for action.</p><p>When the Spiritual Power in Lu Ye’s palm moved, the Grand Ward began to change.</p><p>At the same time, a light crack could be heard in the air like a shattering mirror, and a gap was opened on the tight seal of the Grand Defensive Ward.</p><p>The three figures rushed in, accompanied by Tan Sheng’s triumphant laughter. “Yi Ye, your time is up!”</p><p>But their laughter stopped abruptly as if their throats had been wrung.</p><p>The smile froze on Tan Sheng’s face, and both Wei Que and Xia Liang next to him had expressions of shock. Three pairs of eyes stared fixedly at the over 200 Wolf Mutants watching beneath them, then their expressions turned grim.</p><p>Though they did see Spirit Beasts coming and going from this place, and it was precisely because of that that they were able to ascertain that a Ward was covering this place, the three of them would never have expected so many of them to have gathered in this valley! Judging by their scale, it was undoubtedly a pack of wolves!</p><p>The Yi Ye that plagued their minds stood just below them, coexisting peacefully with the wolf pack, but the gazes of those Wolf Mutants towards them were filled with ferocity.</p><p>[What’s going on?!]</p><p>Tan Sheng and the others were completely bewildered by the scene before their eyes. They originally thought that the biggest problem they would face after breaking through the Grand Defensive Ward in this place was either that Lu Ye would escape using a Teleportation Ward or that he would summon the Divine Opportunity Column to flee. But now, things seemed to have developed in a completely different direction.</p><p>Yi Ye showed no signs of wanting to escape. On the contrary, it was the three of them who had inadvertently fallen into a trap. This wasn’t an Arcane Glade at all, it was simply a wolves’ den.</p><p>Yi Ye actually had the ability to tame such a wolf pack?</p><p>“Retreat quickly!” Xia Liang was the first to react, immediately trying to exit through the gap they came in.</p><p>However, as Lu Ye waved the Ward flag in his hand, the Grand Defensive Ward twisted and transformed in an instant, turning into a massive Trap Ward. The crack in the barrier disappeared without a trace, and Xia Liang was incapable of escaping as he crashed right into the Trap Ward’s barrier, unless he had the ability to destroy the Trap Ward.</p><p>With such a wolf pack guarding him, Yi Ye had no need to fear them. The reason he didn’t let them in immediately was so he could lull them into a false sense of security while a trap had been prepared for them all along. Upon realizing this fact, all three of their expressions twisted with bitterness.</p><p>Wei Que suddenly shouted, “Don’t panic! These Wolf Mutants don’t seem to have the ability to Fly. As long as we don’t fall down, they can’t do anything to us!”</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
