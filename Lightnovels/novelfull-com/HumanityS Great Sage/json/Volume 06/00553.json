Once the matter of the three of them owning an Arcane Glade was revealed, it would inevitably attract a large number of cultivators from that faction to attack them. Not to mention saving the Arcane Glade, they couldn’t even guarantee their own safety then.</p><p>“I’ll come up with an idea for the location.” Li Baxian said. He had been in the Cloud River Battlefield longer than Lu Ye, and his connections were also much vaster when compared to Lu Ye’s, so he was the best person to leave this matter to.</p><p>“In that case, I’ll be troubling you on that, Senior Brother.”</p><p>Feng Yuechan suggested, “This Primus-level Wisp of Sanctification should create a small Arcane Glade, but even so, it’s still an Arcane Glade that can accommodate five people. Currently, we have four people. If Junior Brother Lu has any candidates for a fifth person, then bring them over. Otherwise, that empty spot would go to waste.”</p><p>“As for candidates, I have another person on my side.” He turned towards Li Baxian. “Senior Brother, do you still remember Ju Jia?”</p><p>Feng Yuechan had never seen him before, but Li Baxian had, but they hadn’t had too many chances to get to know each other. After some contemplation, he remembered who he was. “That Body-tempering Cultivator?”</p><p>“Him exactly. He came to the Cloud River Battlefield a few months earlier than me and I was going to look for him before heading into the Carnage Colosseum, but I was held up by what happened there and didn’t get the chance to meet up with him even until today.”</p><p>Li Baxian nodded. “His physique seems a little unusual. Little Junior Brother has good eyes. In that case, tell him to come join us, then we’ll have exactly five people.”</p><p>And, among the five of them, they had one Body-tempering Cultivator, one Combat Cultivator, one Sword Cultivator, and two Spell Cultivators, which was a very sensible party. If they encountered any trouble in the future, they should be able to deal with it with their combined strength.</p><p>Lu Ye sighed. “Ju Jia seems to be bad with directions. Previously, when I asked him to join me, he got lost in a deep forest, so I asked him to wait there for me, so I need to go find him.”</p><p>Li Baxian was dumbfounded. “To think such a thing could happen…”</p><p>It was hard to imagine how a large guy like Ju Jia could get lost in the Cloud River Battlefield, but it was inevitable for some special people to exist in this world who could not be judged by common sense.</p><p>“Then, while Junior Brother Lu is looking for Junior Brother Ju Jia, Senior Brother and I can cultivate here with the Amulets, and we can go and look for a place for the Wisp of Sanctification later. We’ll contact each other again once we have any ideas.”</p><p>“That sounds good.” Lu Ye nodded in agreement.</p><p>After their discussion, Lu Ye didn’t stick around since Ju Jia had been waiting for him for nearly two months. He wasn’t sure whether he was getting impatient or not.</p><p>A few moments later, in front of the Divine Trade Association, Lu Ye stepped out and summoned his Flight-Type Artifact to take him into the air, then he followed the directions that Ju Jia had given him previously.</p><p>Checking the 10-point map, Ju Jia’s current location seemed to be in the middle of a mountain range called the Grand Wilds Peak, and from the map, this Grand Wilds Peak seemed to occupy an extremely large area. Moreover, the core area was marked with one very eye-catching word, “Elite”.</p><p>This meant that an elite-level Spirit Beast was living in the depths of this Grand Wilds Peak.</p><p>Elite was not a realm, but rather a title of extreme strength.</p><p>The elite-level Spirit Beasts of the Spirit Creek Battlefield have reached the limits of what the Spirit Creek Battlefield could hold.</p><p>The same was true of the Cloud River Battlefield. Elite-level Spirit Beasts had reached the maximum of what the Cloud River Battlefield could hold.</p><p>But the two were vastly different in strength, naturally so as they were in different realms.</p><p>Generally speaking, any place where an elite-level Spirit Beast took residence in was basically a forbidden area for cultivators. No cultivator was willing to trespass on the territory of an elite-level Spirit Beast unless they were sick of living.</p><p>This was also the reason why Lu Ye was able to establish his dominance as a cultivator, leaving a huge impact on the hearts of the Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators.</p><p>No other cultivator had ever achieved such a feat in the Spirit Creek Battlefield since the beginning of time, not even Feng Yuechan, who dominated the Roll of Supremacy for over a decade.</p><p>The fact that an elite-level Spirit Beast lay at the very core of Grand Wilds Peak meant undoubtedly that this was not a good place. Many Spirit Beasts were sure to be living in a deep forest such as this, and the deeper one trod into the mountainous wildernesses, the more dangers there would be.</p><p>The Grand Wilds Peak was not very close, so even with Lu Ye’s current speed, it would still take him ten days to arrive.</p><p>Luckily, the journey wasn’t too boring with Yi Yi and Amber to accompany him, and he could take turns controlling the Flight-type Artifact with Yi Yi in day-night shifts. That way, they could shorten the journey by almost half.</p><p>The journey was uneventful as they flew along, enjoying the unique scenery provided by the Cloud River Battlefield.</p><p>Occasionally, they would encounter some cultivators, but most of them wouldn’t disturb them. For the few that were eager to cause trouble due to their high cultivation level or those with a large group, Lu Ye avoided them in advance or used Glyph: Soar to escape.</p><p>With his current Fourth Order cultivation, as long as he didn’t catch the attention of experts at the Eighth or Ninth Order that wouldn’t stop chasing after him, then there wouldn’t be any danger.</p><p>There were a considerable number of Eighth and Ninth Order experts in the Cloud River Battlefield, but no one would chase after a cultivator that they didn’t know the faction of for no reason.</p><p>While rushing on his way, Lu Ye didn’t forget to swallow some pills and cultivate.</p><p>Six days passed by in a flash in that manner, and a travel-worn Lu Ye entered the Grand Wilds Peak, where he got into contact with Ju Jia once more to confirm his exact location.</p><p>When he matched it to the 10-point map, Lu Ye’s brows were raised.</p><p>Ju Jia was quite the courageous sort, for he was not in the outer periphery of the Grand Wilds Peak’s radius, but deeper inside. He wondered whether he had encountered any dangers after being there for so long.</p><p>However, with that guy’s special physique and thick skin, he had self-preservation capabilities that Lu Ye couldn’t hope to match, so there was no need for him to worry about his safety.</p><p>A considerable number of cultivators seemed to come in and out of the Grand Wilds Peak, generally in groups, but there were the occasional few loners.</p><p>This place was a paradise for Spirit Beasts. There were about seven or eight such places scattered in the Cloud River Battlefield, places where Spirit Beasts gathered in large numbers, and these places were naturally a hotspot for cultivators.</p><p>Cultivators could hunt Spirit Beasts and gather some treasure so they can be exchanged for cultivation resources. Even though cultivators of major sects received a salary each month, it was not enough to support one’s cultivation.</p><p>The reason for that was not because the sects were stingy. Instead, there was a reason for doing so.</p><p>If that monthly salary that the sects paid out were enough to satisfy the needs of each cultivator, then there would be no need for them to gain experience or adventure, which would be detrimental to one’s growth.</p><p>So, no matter how prosperous a sect was, they would never grant their disciples a salary that met all their cultivation needs, and the more powerful the sect, the more stringent they were. That way, they could promote independent habits in their disciples.</p><p>Lu Ye did have sufficient cultivation resources. Even without entering the Cloud River Battlefield, he could still raise the level of his cultivation through consuming Spirit Pills and consuming at the main sect.</p><p>However, there wasn’t much of a point in growing this way. Only by going through constant trials and tribulations could a cultivator have strength matching their realms. Simply growing one’s cultivation level would only lead to superficial growth.</p><p>It hadn’t been more than half a day that Lu Ye entered the Grand Wilds Peak and he could already feel the aftershocks from several battles around him. Clearly, they were from the battles of cultivators who were hunting the Spirit Beasts.</p><p>He watched the battles from afar and found that the cultivators worked together well. They had members keeping a lookout on their surroundings, a vanguard, and a flank. With this division of labor, as long as they chose the right opponents, it wouldn’t take long for them to finish the battle and gain some loot.</p><p>He also came across several scattered Spirit Beasts on the way. They weren’t that strong, so with Yi Yi and Amber’s help, they were able to kill them easily.</p><p>He collected the beast blood, mutant cores, and some other useful items from the Spirit Beasts just in case.</p><p>During his time in the Spirit Creek Realm, Lu Ye had also hunted some Spirit Beasts, but the loot from those Spirit Beasts weren’t worth much, so he didn’t even waste the energy collecting them.</p><p>However, things were different now that he was in the Cloud River Realm. Without even mentioning the rest, the Mutant Cores found in the bodies of Cloud River Realm Spirit Beasts alone were a favorite of Amber’s</p><p>When he left the Divine Trade Association, he had even spent some Contribution Points on Mutant Cores and left them in Amber’s Storage Bag for it to snack on.</p><p>Moreover, the blood of the Spirit Beasts could be useful in the Way of Tattoos.</p><p>Th𝗲 most uptodate novels are published on ƒгeewёbnovel.com.</p><p>As for the rest of the materials, some of them could be used for pill refining, others could be used for artificing, and so on. The role that these materials could play would depend on whose hands they fell into.</p><p>The deeper they went into the mountain range, the stronger the Spirit Beasts they encountered. On the contrary, the number of cultivators appeared to be fewer and fewer.</p><p>If the outermost region of the Grand Wilds Peak could be said to be a training ground suitable for any Cloud River Realm cultivator, then where Lu Ye was currently at was a dangerous place where one could not ascertain their safety unless they were in the Fifth Order at the very least.</p><p>After reaching this place, Lu Ye didn’t dare to fly recklessly in the sky either since there were plenty of flying Spirit Beasts in this damned place. If he bumped into some of them in the air, then it would end in a difficult situation for him.</p><p>He really couldn’t understand why Ju Jia had come to such a deep place in this mountain range when he had merely gotten lost. Once he found him, he would have to give him a good talking to to stop him from simply stepping into dangerous places like these in the future.</p><p>As night fell, Lu Ye was about to look for a hidden place to recover his energy when he suddenly felt something in his heart that caused him to turn his head in a certain direction.</p><p>There seemed to be some noise coming from that direction. It was the sound of people talking, and there seemed to be a lot of them.</p><p>After pondering for a moment, he put Amber into his Spirit Beast Bag while he hid himself with Glyph: Concealment, then he slowly crept in that direction.</p><p>Within a few moments, a clearing appeared before his eyes where at least thirty to forty cultivators were gathered. Some were alone while others were in groups of three or five, but he had no idea what they were here for.</p><p>However, as many of them sat cross-legged and cultivating to recover their strength, it seemed like they were getting ready for some sort of operation.</p><p>There were so many people gathered here that it was clear they were not of the same clan. Some were not even from the same faction, and there were also those that were injured.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
