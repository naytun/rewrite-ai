After that, Ju Jia waved his hand.</p><p>The pack leader shook its head and silently plodded back to its original spot, then laid back down again as if nothing happened.</p><p>The corner of Li Baxian’s eye twitched. “Little Junior Brother, I have no more questions. Let’s place the Arcane Glade here.”</p><p>Lu Ye nodded. “I agree!”</p><p>All their worries were solved. Despite Ju Jia treating the pack leader in such a way, it still did not reveal any of its beastly nature, which obviously meant that it really meant no harm to them.</p><p>So, the placement of the Arcane Glade was decided upon.</p><p>Several huts had already been built, and the Wisp of Sanctification naturally had to be placed at the center of these huts so that all of them could share rain and dew evenly.</p><p>Lu Ye led Li Baxian and the others to a suitable location before bringing out his Spirit Beast Bag and taking the fat, white Primus-level Wisp of Sanctification out of it.</p><p>“Senior Brother, how do we do it?” Lu Ye looked at Li Baxian.</p><p>He knew only that a Primus-level Wisp of Sanctification could be used to create a Primus-level Arcane Glade, but Lu Ye wasn’t sure just how exactly it was done.</p><p>“Just put it down,” Li Baxian explained.</p><p>So, Lu Ye put the Wisp of Sanctification down on the ground in front of him.</p><p>All eyes were on the fat and white Wisp of Sanctification, watching as it curled up its body then stretched open again before rolling into the ground, which looked rather comical.</p><p>Seemingly curious as to why Ju Jia was so absorbed in watching the wisp, several wolves also stuck their heads over to watch, all of which were slapped away by Ju Jia with a palm each.</p><p>The Wisp of Sanctification’s movements might have seemed clumsy, but it was in fact highly efficient. In just a few moments, a hole had been dug out of the ground that led deep underground.</p><p>Everyone waited in silence.</p><p>It wasn’t until about an hour later that cloudy spring water suddenly emerged from the ground, rising several meters into the sky, which shocked Amber, who was in the middle of investigating the hole.</p><p>The spring water soon ran clear and gurgled out, gradually forming a small stream on the ground, and its emergence was followed by extremely rich and pure World Spiritual Qi.</p><p>Just from a quick sampling of it, Lu Ye could tell that it was worthy of its name as a Primus-level Spirit Spout. As the water came out of the ground, the World Spirit Qi that filled the air was even denser than that which emerged in a Tertiary-level Arcane Glade.</p><p>Moreover, this was just the beginning. Once the Arcane Glade stabilized completely, the World Spiritual Qi would only become richer.</p><p>“Senior Brother, there’s something that I can’t understand,” Lu Ye suddenly said.</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>“They say that as long as one possesses a Wisp of Sanctification, then one can create an Arcane Glade of the equivalent level, but World Spiritual Qi cannot come from nowhere. Where does the Spiritual Qi that is pouring out of the ground alongside the Spirit Spout come from? It can’t have come from the Wisp of Sanctification.”</p><p>Li Baxian explained, “I’ve thought about this question myself, and I’ve also asked some people. In short, there are two known theories. One is that an enormous amount of rich World Spiritual Qi exists deep underneath the Cloud River Battlefield, and the Wisp of Sanctification has opened up a Spirit Spout, which spring water gushes out of, thus leading up the World Spiritual Qi that had been hidden deep underneath the ground.”</p><p>Lu Ye pondered for a while and shook his head. “This doesn’t sound right.”</p><p>“Why do you say that?”</p><p>“You see, Senior Brother, if that truly were the case, then the World Spiritual Qi that exists under the ground should be of a fixed quality. However, if we use a Primus-level Wisp of Sanctification here, then what we get would be a Primus-level Arcane Glade. And, if we were to use a Tertiary-level Wisp of Sanctification here, then it would be a Tertiary-level Arcane Glade instead, and there’s no way to explain that phenomenon.”</p><p>Li Baxian nodded. “Indeed. If the World Spiritual Qi underneath the ground is fixed, then it shouldn’t matter what quality of Wisp of Sanctification is used. The resulting Arcane Glade should be the same.”</p><p>“What is the second theory?”</p><p>“That the Wisp of Sanctification is only a catalyst, and the Spirit Spout is only the external manifestation. There’s no World Spiritual Qi hidden in the ground either, just a gift bestowed by the Heavens. In other words, as we make use of the Primus-level Wisp of Sanctification, it is like opening a channel with the Heavens, a channel that can transfer over the corresponding grade of World Spiritual Qi according to the level of the Arcane Glade. So, as long as there exists a Wisp of Sanctification, it doesn’t matter where it’s placed and an Arcane Glade of equivalent level can be created.”</p><p>“That’s… quite a novel theory.”</p><p>“However, it does explain a lot of the questions.”</p><p>Pondering for a moment, that does seem to be the case indeed. If it was based on this theory, then all the doubts he had in his heart could be explained.</p><p>The Spirit Spout had already been born, and the accumulation of World Spiritual Qi in the Arcane Glade still required a few days before it could stabilize, which was a good time for Lu Ye to set up the Wards. He refined a large number of Ward Flags a few days ago, and now they can finally be put to use.</p><p>Updated from freewёbnoνel.com.</p><p>Yi Yi and Feng Yuechan on the other hand, were in charge of furnishing the wooden huts. For a long time to come, they were going to be living here, and having a more comfortable living environment would naturally bring up one’s mood. Li Baxian and Ju Jia tried to help, but very soon, the two of them were blasted out of the huts.</p><p>Looking at each other, Li Baxian could only go and look for Lu Ye instead and help him. As for Ju Jia, he just sat down next to the Spirit Spout and cultivated in peace.</p><p>As night fell, the fire was rekindled. The moon hung high in the sky, and the picturesque valley was filled with joyous laughter and the aroma of delicious wine and meat.</p><p>In the second half of the night, Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan finally saw the anomaly resulting from Ju jia’s cultivation, and they were both astonished.</p><p>Especially when the entire wolf pack would resonate with him as he cultivated, swallowing the moon’s essence. The scene was spectacular.</p><p>Fortunately, Lu Ye had set up a Concealment Ward beforehand, so even though a magnificent phenomenon was produced, as long as one wasn’t too close, then one shouldn’t be able to detect it, whether they be man or Spirit Beast.</p><p>A few days later, Lu Ye had set up large numbers of Wards around the entire Arcane Glade, and the World Spiritual Qi inside of it also stabilized completely.</p><p>Compared to the Tertiary-level Arcane Glade that he and Kitty Shen occupied before, the cultivation environment in the Primus-level Arcane Glade was ten times more favorable than that. The pure World Spiritual Qi had almost turned into a mist that enveloped the entirety of the Arcane Glade. So, even without actively cultivating, one needed only to live in this place and their cultivation level would rise continuously.</p><p>All of them deeply felt just how much a Primus-level Arcane Glade could provide to a cultivator, and it was no wonder why the cultivators of the Cloud River Realm were so eager to occupy such a place.</p><p>With an Arcane Glade like this, the growth of a cultivator in the Cloud River Realm could be shortened by at least half.</p><p>Through the past few days, Yi Yi and Amber had both broken through, reaching the Third Order Cloud River Realm. They were just short of it before, and now with the accumulation of their cultivation through the past few days, they naturally gained enough to allow them to make a breakthrough.</p><p>After the first few days of excitement and novelty were over, their days gradually returned to normal.</p><p>That was how a cultivator’s life was like, always focusing on the pursuit of realm enhancement. Amongst the few, the one who cultivated the hardest was undoubtedly Ju Jia.</p><p>During the day, he cultivated in his hut by breathing in the World Spiritual Qi, but as a moonlit night fell, he would leave his abode and cultivate outside. If there was no moonlight for a few days, then he could stay inside his hut for many days at a time.</p><p>Lu Ye had also given him a piece of dragon scale. The vitality contained within a dragon’s scale was extremely useful for a Body-tempering Cultivator like Ju Jia.</p><p>Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan also cherished their new cultivation environment very much, and all of them were working hard to improve their strength.</p><p>In contrast to them, Lu Ye was the one who had the most time on his hands.</p><p>He never needed to put too much effort in cultivating. With hundreds of Spirit Gathering Funnels all over his body, he needed only to be inside of the Arcane Glade and World Spiritual Qi would seep into his body incessantly. Then, by consuming some Spirit Pills every so often, the volume of the River of Spiritual Power within his body would grow day by day.</p><p>While cultivating, he would always spend that time reading books.</p><p>The books he brought from Lady Yun and the blade technique insights that he got from the Raving Bladesmen were his chosen reading materials that he used to pass the time.</p><p>Perhaps due to how he was the most idle one, Lu Ye had been getting along quite well with the wolf pack during this period of time. A few of them had even become quite familiar with him and would occasionally squeeze their heads over to join him whenever Lu Ye was reading a book.</p><p>A batch of Wolf Mutants would leave every few days to hunt due to a Spirit Beast’s instinct to survive.</p><p>After getting to know the Wolf Mutants, Lu Ye also gained some Spirit Beast meat from them whenever they came back from their hunt.</p><p>Other than reading books and practicing his blade techniques daily, Lu Ye spent most of his time practicing Tattoos on himself.</p><p>These days, his mastery in the Way of Tattoos had increased again, but so far, he had only been able to practice on himself as there were no suitable subjects for him to work on.</p><p>One day, as he was practicing on his own body, a large head suddenly pushed its way over and looked on in curiosity.</p><p>Lu Ye raised his head to meet the gaze of the pair of wolf eyes.</p><p>This was one of the Wolf Mutants that he had grown closer to recently, and there was a patch of blue fur on its forehead that looked like a blooming blue flower.</p><p>Four eyes met, but Lu Ye ignored it and continued focusing on practicing his Tattooing.</p><p>But soon, his hand stopped, and he looked up again at the Wolf Mutant before him… A thought passed through his mind. [This seems like a good target to practice the Way of Tattoos on?]</p><p>He hadn’t thought about it before, mainly because in order to create a Tattoo on a Spirit Beast’s body, it was inevitable to have enough trust with one beforehand. Otherwise, Lu Ye could very well be attacked by the Spirit Beast while pricking them with a needle, and the loss would outweigh the gains then.</p><p>However, now that they were acquainted with each other, maybe he could give it a try?</p><p>With that thought in mind, Lu Ye quickly called out to someone. “Amber!”</p><p>Amber, who was lounging lazily in the sun not far away, quickly got up and came over, leaping onto Lu Ye’s shoulder.</p><p>Lu Ye raised his hand and constructed Glyph: Sharp Edge on his palm. In a flash, a light bloomed over his entire palm.</p><p>The Wolf Mutant took a step back, clearly sensing the sharpness of the aura.</p><p>“Ask it, does it wish to possess such an ability?”</p><p>Amber immediately understood Lu Ye’s intentions and began conversing with the Wolf Mutant before it.</p><p>The Wolf Mutant glanced over at Lu Ye’s palm from time to time with a clear look of temptation in its wolf eyes.</p><p>“Tell it that I just need to prick its skin a few times with a needle, and it would gain that ability. It can make its claws even sharper!” Lu Ye struck while the iron was hot.</p><p>Amber continued relaying Lu Ye’s words.</p><p>As expected, the Wolf Mutant was tempted by the offer. It stepped forward and lowered its head, showing submission to Lu Ye to do whatever he wanted.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
