Even if he was in the Ninth Order Cloud River Realm, he still couldn’t hold on for long.</p><p>The Spiritual Power in his body was pouring out like an open floodgate, and each Spell Technique he launched reverberated through the surroundings. Despite his calls for help, Tan Sheng and Xia Liang’s rescue never arrived. Wei Que realized that their situation was probably not favorable either. Otherwise, there was no reason for them to ignore him.</p><p>The scent of blood lingered in the air, and the pain throughout his body caused him to sweat profusely. He was completely engulfed by an aura of death.</p><p>He never would have imagined that his pursuit of Yi Ye would lead him into this life-threatening situation. If he had known this would be the case earlier, he would never have agreed to accompany Tan Sheng here.</p><p>However, it was too late for regrets at this point. In this current situation, he couldn’t see even a glimmer of hope for escape.</p><p>Just as he was thinking so, something changed all of a sudden.</p><p>The Ward that surrounded him suddenly shifted, followed by the rapid dispersal of the surrounding mist and colorful illusions.</p><p>Wei Que was stunned for a moment, but then he was overcome with joy!</p><p>He had inadvertently broken through the Illusion Ward! The Heavens had not forsaken him after all.</p><p>As the mist dissipated, he saw several figures gathering not far away from him. Among them were indeed Li Baxian, Feng Yuechan, and also Yi Ye. In addition, there was a burly cultivator dressed in linen. It was a Body-tempering Cultivator with large bulging muscles.</p><p>A clear flicker of surprise flashed in Yi Ye’s eyes.</p><p>Clearly, he hadn’t expected Wei Que to destroy the Ward either.</p><p>Indeed, Lu Ye hadn’t expected it.</p><p>The Illusion Ward was set up by Lu Ye using Ward Flags. Unlike the Grand Defensive Ward and the Trap Ward, it didn’t possess much defensive capability. If the Ward Flags were destroyed, the Ward wouldn’t be able to maintain itself.</p><p>Wei Que’s reckless attacks coincidentally hit one of the flags, which caused the Illusion Ward to collapse by itself.</p><p>It could only be said that this guy was incredibly lucky.</p><p>After breaking out of the Ward and seeing the true forms of Lu Ye and his party, Wei Que immediately roared, “Yi Ye!”</p><p>He was filled with as much anger as he was fearful before. As a Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivator, he had been virtually defenseless against a few Fourth to Fifth Order Cloud River Realm cultivators to the point of having to seek help from his companions. That undoubtedly made it difficult for him to lift his head.</p><p>As he roared, a fierce Spell Technique blasted in Lu Ye’s direction.</p><p>Lu Ye didn’t move, but Ju Jia swiftly stepped forward. A burst of Spiritual Light flashed before him, blocking the Spell Technique, and the only result was that he was blasted back a few steps but remained unscathed.</p><p>Wei Que’s eyelids twitched as he witnessed this scene, amazed by Ju Jia’s tough physique. He wasn’t able to fully grasp Ju Jia’s might when he was within the mist earlier, but upon seeing how effortlessly this Fourth Order Cloud River Realm cultivator blocked his Spell Technique, Wei Que was truly shocked.</p><p>With five Minor Realms of difference in their cultivation, even if the opponent was a Body-tempering Cultivator, he should not have been able to withstand that attack. Yet in reality, not only could he endure it, it barely even seemed to affect him.</p><p>Just as Wei Que was about to attack again, an inexplicable sense of weakness surged in him, causing him to fall back uncontrollably.</p><p>He cursed under his breath. He had expended too much energy before, and combined with his numerous injuries, how could he still have any strength left to continue fighting?</p><p>A sword cry sounded as Li Baxian’s body was covered in a flowing light, then an endless barrage of Flying Swords descended upon Wei Que. Feng Yuechan stood beside him, continuously casting exquisite and powerful Spell Techniques, shooting them at Wei Que one after another.</p><p>Wei Que’s complexion changed, and he hastily circulated his dwindling Spiritual Power to defend himself.</p><p>*Deng deng deng…* Ju Jia ran forward in a large stride, figure rising and falling amidst the glimmers of Flying Swords and Spell Techniques. He rapidly closed the distance between him and Wei Que, carrying an oppressive force akin to a collapsing mountain.</p><p>When he got close enough, Ju Jia took advantage of when Wei Que was preoccupied with dealing with the Flying Swords and Spell Technique to throw a kick out.</p><p>Feeling the terrifying momentum of this kick, Wei Que’s pupils contracted. Given the current circumstances, he would rather be struck by Li Baxian’s Flying Swords or hit by Feng Yuechan’s Spell Techniques than risk being kicked by Ju Jia.</p><p>If that kick landed, he would likely be reduced to a bloody mist in an instant.</p><p>In the face of life or death, his nerves were tensed to the extreme, and he displayed an agility that didn’t belong to a Spell Cultivator. While blocking the attacks of the Flying Swords and Spell Techniques, he narrowly avoided Ju Jia’s kick.</p><p>But before he could even breathe a sigh of relief, a figure concealed behind Ju Jia’s stalwart form charged out.</p><p>It was none other than Lu Ye.</p><p>A fiery red glint flashed from his blade, illuminating the panic and helplessness on Wei Que’s face. Faced with this descending slash, he had no room to dodge.</p><p>Flash!</p><p>The blade descended, breaking through Wei Que’s protective Spiritual Power and leaving a massive wound from his shoulder to his waist, revealing the wriggling organs beneath his skin.</p><p>The powerful impact sent Wei Que flying backwards, blood spraying from his mouth.</p><p>Struggling to stabilize himself, Wei Que’s vision turned blood-red, and stars danced before his eyes. Even the flow of Spiritual Power within his body became disordered.</p><p>Having spent so much energy and sustaining sick heavy injuries, he was like a lamp that was soon to run out of oil.</p><p>Seeing the unrelenting Lu Ye approaching with his fiery saber, determined to exterminate him, Wei Que grew resolute.</p><p>Though his foundation was not as strong as Tan Sheng and Xia Liang, he had still reached the Ninth Order Cloud River Realm. Over the years, he had experienced numerous life and death crises, and he was not lacking the courage to fight through them.</p><p>He realized that his chances of survival were slim and felt regretful for letting himself be blinded by greed, but what use of regret now that things had reached this point?</p><p>But even in death, he wouldn’t let his enemies off easily!</p><p>Reaching into his Storage Bag, he retrieved an item.</p><p>It appeared to be an arrow, and a broken one at that. The object looked aged, and it was not known where Wei Que had obtained it from.</p><p>However, it definitely held immense value to him for him to bring it out at such a moment. It was his most precious possession and his final trump card.</p><p>Biting his tongue, he sprayed blood onto the broken arrow, which instantly caused the old arrow to emanate a brilliant light, accompanied by a dangerously ominous aura.</p><p>Lu Ye, who was charging towards him with a raised blade, immediately halted his movement and decisively drifted backwards. In that moment, a tremendous sense of alarm surged within him as he focused his gaze on the Broken Arrow in Wei Que’s hand. He knew very well that the threat was emanating from that Broken Arrow!</p><p>As Wei Que poured his Spiritual Power madly into the broken arrow, its radiance intensified like a blazing sun. With a blood-covered grin, he scoffed. “Yi Ye, even if I die, I’ll make you accompany me to the grave!”</p><p>Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan both sensed the gravity of the situation. The Broken Arrow was clearly a treasure surpassing that of a Spirit Artifact or even a Spell Artifact. Even in its damaged state, its power must be immense. If Wei Que was successful in wielding it, nobody could tell the extent of its devastation.</p><p>Both of them exerted all their power so that they could kill Wei Que before he could unleash the artifact. However, despite their combined efforts, the best they achieved was causing Wei Que’s to stagger and blood to spurt from his mouth. Taking his life would be difficult within such a short time frame.</p><p>In less than three breaths of time, the Broken Arrow in Wei Que’s hand transformed into a streak of light, shooting forward like lightning.</p><p>In that instant, Lu Ye’s body bristled with goosebumps as an unprecedented sense of danger surged within him.</p><p>Without hesitation, he took off in one direction to create distance between Wei Que and himself. However, the streak of light was too fast, almost reaching him in the blink of an eye.</p><p>Amber, perched on Lu Ye’s shoulder, had also sensed the danger. Its fur stood on end as it arched its back, letting out a growl as it merged its life force with Lu Ye’s.</p><p>Lu Ye raised his blade, and the flesh of his right arm instantly bulged.</p><p>Flash!</p><p>A flurry of slashes!</p><p>The dense sounds merged into one. To outsiders, it seemed like a single strike, but in reality, Lu Ye had unleashed five strikes within that incredibly short period.</p><p>Every strike that landed caused Wei Que’s body to shake as if it were his body that the Inviolable Saber was cutting into. Blood spewed out of his mouth like a fountain while his complexion grew visibly pale.</p><p>The slashes that he poured all his strength into were not without effect. The streak of light in front of him froze for a moment, and Lu Ye seized that opportunity to fall backwards, landing pitifully on the ground.</p><p>The streak of light grazed his nose and flew past, stirring up a gust of wind in its wake that stung Lu Ye’s face.</p><p>However, before he could catch his breath, he caught the streak of light changing direction and flying back towards him from the corner of his eye.</p><p>Wei Que was clearly controlling the arrow. Disregarding Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan’s relentless attacks, Wei Que remained fixated on killing Lu Ye, making good on his vow to take Lu Ye down with him even in death.</p><p>Lu Ye had no idea what kind of treasure this was, but its destructive power was evident. Despite his best efforts, he could only impede its flight slightly. It seemed that this would not end unless he killed Wei Que.</p><p>As it struck again, Lu Ye, who had just risen from the ground, was too late to avoid it.</p><p>Just as he prepared to swing his blade again, he felt a weight on his shoulder as a large hand grabbed him. In the next moment, Lu Ye found himself being tossed into the air.</p><p>While in mid-air, he saw Ju Jia’s stalwart figure standing right where he was.</p><p>A radiant light burst forth, and a protective shield resembling a turtle shell appeared before Ju Jia.</p><p>The streak of light collided with it.</p><p>*Hong…*</p><p>After the loud eruption, Ju Jia’s body shook violently, and dense cracks formed on the seemingly impenetrable turtle shell before it shattered instantly.</p><p>The streak of light pierced through Ju Jia’s body, bringing forth a burst of blood. A groan escaped Ju Jia’s lips as he fell to one knee.</p><p>Lu Ye’s gaze turned cold, and the flames on his Inviolable Saber burned even more intensely.</p><p>On the other side, Li Baxian merged with the light from his sword, transforming into a towering Sword Light that struck Wei Que. His sword moved like an agile viper, leaving a trail of bloody wounds on Wei Que’s body. He intended to capitalize on the opportunity to cut him down but was pushed away by one of his Spell Techniques.</p><p>At this critical moment, Lu Ye descended from the air, the streak of light that injured Ju Jia following closely behind.</p><p>Despite feeling the killing intent that was sticking to his back like maggots on rotting bone, Lu Ye’s gaze remained unwavering. It was clear that Wei Que was on his last legs. If this strike landed, he would undoubtedly die!</p><p>Now, it was a race to see who was faster—his blade, or Wei Que’s treasure.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
