On the contrary, with their agile figures and foundation as Cloud River Realm cultivators, they could gradually chip away at these Wolf Mutants.</p><p>Of course, their main target was still Yi Ye. As long as they could kill Yi Ye, they could completely disregard the Wolf Mutants.</p><p>Just as they were thinking this, Lu Ye suddenly waved the Ward Flag in his hand and softly uttered words that sent chills down their bodies.</p><p>“Aerial Lock!”</p><p>As these words emerged, the Ward covering the Arcane Glade suddenly changed.</p><p>More than a month ago, Lu Ye was still unable to set up an Aerial Lock Ward, but he obtained four more Glyphs from the Tree of Glyphs, and all four of them were related to Wards, including this Aerial Lock Ward.</p><p>If the wolfpack were to unleash their full potential, the Aerial Lock Ward was undoubtedly necessary.</p><p>As the Ward transformed, Tan Sheng and the group who were floating in the air suddenly felt an invisible mountain pressing down on them. Caught off guard, the three figures tumbled downward, limbs flailing pitifully as they fell.</p><p>Howls rang out as many Wolf Mutants opened their mouths, spewing out a dense array of faint green wind blades that swept towards the three of them.</p><p>Indeed, these Wolf Mutants lacked the ability to fly, but they possessed a certain degree of aerial combat capabilities in the form of these wind blades that they naturally possessed as a kind of innate talent.</p><p>It was not only the Wolf Mutants who had this capability, but most other Spirit Beasts. Without it, they wouldn’t be able to survive in the perilous Grand Wilds Peak.</p><p>Of course, compared to their sharp claws and fangs, these wind blade-like attacks were much weaker and less flexible.</p><p>But their advantage was in their numbers.</p><p>The densely packed wind blades swept towards Tan Sheng and his group, causing flickering to appear as they landed on their bodies.</p><p>It was only to be expected of these Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivators. They could still defend themselves even though they appeared particularly pitiful under the onslaught of the wind blades. Even so, they were still in a precarious situation.</p><p>As they continued to fall, the pressure on their bodies rapidly decreased.</p><p>That was how the Aerial Lock Ward worked. The higher they flew within the Ward’s coverage, the greater the pressure they faced. If they were standing on the ground, they wouldn’t feel any pressure at all.</p><p>They only managed to stabilize their bodies when they reached ten meters above the ground. At this height, the pressure from the Aerial Lock Ward was negligible.</p><p>In the end, Lu Ye’s attainments in the Way of Wards was still not enough. Otherwise, not to mention 10 meters, he would have made it so that they couldn’t even fly one meter high.</p><p>Even though they were able to avoid the fate of falling down miserably, there was no trace of joy on the faces of Tan Sheng and his group. Instead, their expressions became more solemn because as the Wolf Mutants had them surrounded in all directions.</p><p>Following their resounding wolf howls, the Wolf Mutants initiated their attacks. Giant figures leaped agilely towards Tan Sheng’s group, and watching from a distance, the attacks of the Wolf Mutants were like a wild and unending storm, beating Tan Sheng and the others into a sorry state.</p><p>The three of them took on a triangular formation and each wielded their Spirit Artifacts, blocking and repelling the attacking Wolf Mutants. Occasionally, a Wolf Mutant would be injured, and blood would splatter.</p><p>Despite how tough the hides of the Wolf Mutants were, the strength of Tan Sheng and his group was evident. If it weren’t for the advantage in numbers that was overwhelming them, a single Wolf Mutant, or even the pack leader, wouldn’t stand a single chance against them.</p><p>The methods that cultivators could employ were ultimately much greater than those of the Spirit Beasts.</p><p>While they were embroiled in an intense battle, Lu Ye remained calm in the distance, observing them silently. Occasionally, he would raise his hand and unleash some telekinetic techniques or spells to divert the attention of Tan Sheng and his group.</p><p>They were so frustrated that they almost coughed up blood!</p><p>During these past few days when they were venturing deep into the Grand Wilds Peak, they had to endure hardships and camped outside on a rough journey until finally finding Yi Ye with much difficulty, but they never expected to be greeted with such a situation.</p><p>The immense wolf pack launched a relentless attack on them while their actual target stood by and watched. There was simply no justice in this world!</p><p>They couldn’t understand how Yi Ye could have such good luck to be able to bring a wolf pack into his subordination.</p><p>If it weren’t for the interference of the wolf pack, any one of the three of them could easily cut him down.</p><p>In the midst of the fierce battle, the three of them also sensed that something was amiss.</p><p>When some of the Wolf Mutants pounced to bite them, there was a faint but eye-catching glow on their mouths. Moreover, when attacked, defensive Glyphs would suddenly appear on their backs…</p><p>Upon closer inspection, many of these Wolf Mutants had golden arrow-shaped markings on their mouths!</p><p>“Yi Ye Tattooed these beasts!” Xia Liang exclaimed.</p><p>Tan Sheng and Wei Que were both shocked. While they knew that Lu Ye had considerable attainments in the Way of Wards, they never realized that he had delved so deeply into Tattooing as well.</p><p>For him to be able to tattoo Spirit Beasts undoubtedly indicated many things.</p><p>This guy was defying the Heavens! How could he be adept at everything?</p><p>The battle that dragged on seemed to leave the pack leader seemed somewhat annoyed. From the outside of the battlefield, it let out a howl to the sky, and in the next moment, the onslaught of the wolf pack became even more intense.</p><p>Tan Sheng and the others forced down the bitterness in their mouths. They could tell increasingly that things were not looking good for them, and if they were to let this go on, then don’t even mention Lu Ye. Whether or not they could guarantee their safe retreat was still a question.</p><p>They couldn’t delay this any longer. It was undoubtedly unwise to be engaging in a desperate battle with the wolf pack, especially since their target had only been a single person from beginning to end.</p><p>“Wei Que, kill Yi Ye!” Xia Liang roared as a dazzling light radiated from his blade. The Spiritual Power in his entire body began to boil.</p><p>Tan Sheng sensed his intention and quickly activated his own power to cooperate with him.</p><p>With their raging Spiritual Power, the two of them worked together to tear open a gap in the wolf pack’s encirclement. From that gap, a Blade Light was launched directly in Lu Ye’s direction like a beam.</p><p>The Inviolable Saber was brought out of its sheath and vitality gathered in Lu Ye’s right arm. As a brilliant light flashed his body was sent flying backwards.</p><p>Being in the Fourth Order, he fell a bit short of directly confronting a Ninth Order cultivator’s Blade Light. This strike caused the blood in his chest to roll up his throat while his right arm that held the saber felt somewhat numb.</p><p>The incoming Blade Light shattered, and following closely behind it was the figure of Wei Que, who charged at Lu Ye with a fierce expression on his face. Spiritual Power surged around him, revealing his killing intent.</p><p>Tan Sheng and Xia Liang worked together to create this opening for him. He certainly couldn’t let them down!</p><p>When he saw Lu Ye’s figure flying backwards, Wei Que immediately launched a Spell Technique towards him. At the same time, he followed closely behind him and opened his hand, and within his palm, Spiritual Power surged with enough momentum as if he wanted to completely eradicate Lu Ye.</p><p>Lu Ye’s Glyph: Protection formed in front of his body just in time, barely blocking the Spell Technique, after which it shattered, and he was sent even further by the impact.</p><p>Then, under Wei Que’s intense gaze, Lu Ye’s body seemed to collide with a transparent film. With a ripple, he disappeared mysteriously without a trace.</p><p>[Another Ward?] Wei Que was taken aback. However, as the howl of a wolf came from behind, he gritted his teeth and quickly chased after him.</p><p>Even though he wasn’t sure what Ward Lu Ye had set up ahead, it had taken much effort to break free from the wolf pack, and if he couldn’t take him down quickly, all their previous efforts would have been in vain. Without Tan Sheng and Xia Liang’s support, his situation would be even worse.</p><p>So, even though he knew it was not advisable to chase after him, Wei Que had no choice but to push forward with resolution.</p><p>His body seemed to break through a barrier, and Wei Que felt himself enveloped by a Ward. Looking around, he couldn’t see Lu Ye’s figure, but instead, a dense fog appeared all around him.</p><p>The fog spread at an extremely fast pace. In the blink of an eye, the surrounding area became pitch black, and to Wei Que’s surprise, colorful lights were constantly flickering and moving inside of the fog. With the changing movement of those lights, he occasionally caught glimpses of inexplicable figures in his field of vision.</p><p>“Illusion Ward!” Wei Que immediately realized that he had been caught in some sort of Ward, and a chill ran from his head to his feet. This was a bad situation.</p><p>[What kind of monster was this Yi Ye? Has his proficiency in Wards reached such a level?]</p><p>Since they entered Arcane Glade, they had already experienced the Grand Defensive Ward, Trap Ward, the Aerial Lock Ward, and now, even an Illusion Ward had appeared…</p><p>And these were just the ones he had seen. There were definitely many more that he hadn’t seen yet!</p><p>Could a Cloud River Realm cultivator really set up so many advanced Wards?</p><p>But on second thought, if that guy could set up Teleportation Wards, what could he not do?</p><p>With this thought in mind, Wei Que didn’t dare to stay in place. He immediately began rushing to break free from the enveloping Ward.</p><p>This was undoubtedly the most sensible response. The range of the Ward’s envelopment was ultimately limited. As long as he kept rushing in one direction, he would eventually break free.</p><p>The speed of a Ninth Order cultivator was extremely fast, and with Wei Que exerting all his effort, it might not even be an exaggeration to describe him as being as fast as the wind.</p><p>However, as time passed, a despairing scene unfolded before him. No matter how fast he ran, no matter how hard he pushed himself, he was still trapped inside the fog, unable to escape from the shroud of the Ward.</p><p>In a certain part of the Grand Ward, following Wei Que’s movements, Lu Ye was continuously manipulating the Ward. This was the first time he had observed someone breaking into the Illusion Ward, so he naturally wanted to summarize the experience and see how effective the Ward was.</p><p>For now, the results seemed to be quite good.</p><p>Built with the Glyphs Mist Shroud and Mirage as its core, the Illusion Ward seemed to confuse the enemy’s perception. So, even though Wei Que believed he was fleeing in one direction, in reality, under Lu Ye’s manipulation, he had been running in circles within the Grand Ward without realizing it.</p><p>Inside the Grand Ward, Wei Que’s forehead was covered in sweat, and his expression was grave.</p><p>He had also noticed that something was wrong. According to reason, everything he saw in such a Ward should be an illusion. What his eyes perceived might not be true, but his perception itself should not be false.</p><p>However, it seemed now that his own perception had also gone awry, otherwise, it didn’t make sense why he couldn’t run out of the Ward.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
