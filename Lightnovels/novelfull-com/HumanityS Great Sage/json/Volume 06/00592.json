Xia Qianqian had told him that if he sold something that could revolutionize an entire faction to the Vault of Providence, he would receive the favor of the Heavens and enhance his own luck.</p><p>And indeed, it proved to be true. After leaving the Myriad Beast Domain’s Hidden Realms and selling the jade slips engraved with the Beast Pact Art and Glyph: Life Energy to the Vault of Providence, he not only received numerous Contribution Points but also felt the favor of the Heavens coming upon him in the dark.</p><p>It felt exactly the same as what he felt just now.</p><p>In the Carnage Colosseum, he was able to turn his bad luck into good luck mainly because of the Golden Body Token he obtained. The Golden Body Token was an extremely precious object that even Divine Ocean Realm cultivators coveted, yet he, a Cloud River Realm cultivator, obtained it as a spoil of war. Not only did he turn the tides in his favor, he also obtained first place in the Roster of Carnage in the Carnage Colosseum and received a reward from the Heavens.</p><p>Were these instances not manifestations of his own luck?</p><p>Luck, although invisible and intangible, constantly influenced him.</p><p>Last time, it was because he brought out something that could revolutionize an entire faction from the Myriad Beast Domain’s Hidden Realms that earned him the favor of the Heavens.</p><p>What about this time?</p><p>So he also got one for killing the Fox Mutant and saving those cultivators?</p><p>He suddenly recalled the inexplicable last words of the Fox Mutant.</p><p>[So, the Heavens have already enacted their punishment.]</p><p>At first, Lu Ye didn’t understand the meaning of her words, but now, combined with his own experiences, he had a vague realization.</p><p>For twenty years, the Fox Mutant had been tyrannizing Fox Immortal Valley, enslaving many cultivators with the help of the Divine Soul Secret Technique that shouldn’t have appeared on the Cloud River Battlefield. Countless cultivators had died because of her, and even though he killed her solely for self-defense and to save Li Baxian, it could be a considered beneficial act</p><p>If he hadn’t killed the Fox Mutant now, there might be even more unfortunate cultivators in the future.</p><p>And the reason he entered Fox Immortal Valley was because he followed Li Baxian in pursuit of Tan Sheng and Xia Liang, thus encountering Zhou Yuntian and his group along the way.</p><p>Now, looking back, when Tan Sheng and Xia Liang fled from the Arcane Glade, they should have escaped to the outskirts of Grand Wilds Peak. But for some reason, they ended up fleeing deep into its depths instead…</p><p>This clearly didn’t match their situation at the time, and two cultivators in the Ninth Order Cloud River Realm should not have made such a confused choice.</p><p>He chased after them with Li Baxian, and as a result, they encountered Zhou Yuntian and the others and were led into Fox Immortal Valley. Coincidentally, he possessed the Tree of Glyphs and was unaffected by the Fox Mutant’s Divine Soul Secret Technique, and even more coincidentally, he had a wolf pack under his command!</p><p>Even the battle against the Berserk Giant Ape in Fox Immortal Valley went surprisingly well.</p><p>The Fox Mutant’s twenty-year-long revenge plan failed, but shortly after Lu Ye arrived in Fox Immortal Valley, he assisted her in completing it…</p><p>Everything seemed reasonable, but upon deeper contemplation, many inexplicable coincidences could be found.</p><p>It seemed as if there were invisible hands manipulating everything behind the scenes.</p><p>What… exactly was the Heavens?</p><p>Was he its punishment for the Fox Mutant?</p><p>He killed the Fox Mutant, resolving the disaster in this region, so the Heavens was bestowing favor upon him once again?</p><p>Thoughts tumbled in Lu Ye’s mind, and he suddenly felt a chill down his back.</p><p>He looked down at the back of his hand. Just now, when the Heavens bestowed its favor upon him, his hand also felt slightly warm. Looking at it now, Lu Ye was astonished</p><p>That was because a golden mark had appeared on his hand, exactly the same as the one he received from the Heavens when he obtained first place in the Roster of Carnage!</p><p>Not only did he receive favor, but he also received a reward?</p><p>However, Lu Ye didn’t know what exactly this reward was at the moment. The reward for ranking first in the Roster of Carnage was clear, but he would have to return to the Arcane Glade and consult the Divine Opportunity Column to learn more about this reward.</p><p>Collecting his thoughts, Lu Ye looked to the side and saw Ju Jia standing head bowed with a dejected expression.</p><p>It was evident that he was still troubled over attacking Lu Ye and chasing after Yi Yi.</p><p>Dispelling his distractions, Lu Ye approached Ju Jia and patted his arm, comforting him. “Don’t mind it. Even Fourth Senior Brother couldn’t withstand the Fox Mutant’s Secret Technique, let alone you.”</p><p>Ju Jia glanced up at him. Even though he remained silent as before, his expression seemed to have loosened up slightly.</p><p>Lu Ye then turned to look at Li Baxian, only to see Feng Yuechan giggling. “Senior Brother, what’s the situation with that Cultivator Yu? It seems like you have a close relationship with her?”</p><p>Before the group of cultivators left Fox Immortal Valley, Yu Daiwei specifically bid farewell to Li Baxian, and her peculiar mannerisms made her extremely pissed off.</p><p>Li Baxian maintained a composed demeanor. “She is also a Sword Cultivator. When we were in Fox Immortal Valley, she often came to me to spar, but I’m not really that close with her… Tsk, why am I even telling you all this? Also, I’m your Senior Uncle! Don’t just blindly call me anything!” He raised his hand and lightly tapped Feng Yuechan on the head.</p><p>Feng Yuechan’s cheeks puffed up slightly, looking upset.</p><p>Li Baxian walked over to Lu Ye and asked with concern, “Little Junior Brother, how are your injuries?”</p><p>“They’re just minor flesh wounds, nothing serious.”</p><p>Li Baxian sighed, “I didn’t expect such a dangerous Spirit Beast to exist in the Cloud River Battlefield. When she enslaved us with her Divine Soul Secret Technique, I didn’t even realize that anything was wrong, but now that I think about it… It truly was horrifying. By the way, how did you manage to break free from her Secret Technique?”</p><p>This was the part that puzzled him the most. On that day when he and Lu Ye were brought back together, they should have all been affected by the Fox Mutant’s Divine Soul Secret Technique, but Lu Ye had not shown any flaws either in all of those days. It wasn’t until today that he learned that his Little Junior Brother had been planning in secret to kill the Fox Mutant all along.</p><p>Before Lu Ye could answer, Feng Yuechan spoke up first. “Silly Senior Brother, have you forgotten how powerful Junior Brother Lu’s Divine Soul is? No matter what, the Fox Mutant’s level is no way past a Champion-class Spirit Beast. Even if she did use her Divine Soul Secret Technique on Junior Brother Lu, what effect could it have on him?”</p><p>Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan were both aware that Lu Ye had obtained a lot of Soul Cleansing Water, which was a divine item that enhanced a cultivator’s Divine Soul, and Li Baxian had also received some from Lu Ye as well. The fact that Lu Ye could give them away to someone else indicated that he had used a considerable amount himself.</p><p>Feng Yuechan assumed that Lu Ye’s ability to break free from the Fox Mutant’s Divine Soul Secret Technique was definitely related to the strength of his Divine Soul.</p><p>This was something that Lu Ye was glad to see. It was difficult for him to explain too much about the Tree of Glyphs, so he went with Feng Yuechan’s flow and agreed. “Senior Sister Feng is right.”</p><p>“We do have to thank Little Junior Brother’s actions this time. Otherwise, the outcome could have turned out far worse than today.”</p><p>Feng Yuechan continued, “Little Junior Brother is still injured, so let him focus on healing first. Senior Brother, I have something to ask you. Come with me.”</p><p>Li Baxian immediately wore a troubled expression, but before he could say anything, Feng Yuechan pulled him aside.</p><p>Lu Ye shook his head and chuckled, but he did need some time to rest and recover.</p><p>With the wolf pack guarding the surroundings, there was no need to worry about any danger.</p><p>After finding a spot, he sat cross-legged and tossed some Spirit Pills and a Healing Pill into his mouth before silently refining them.</p><p>In less than half a day, his depleted Spiritual Power had mostly recovered.</p><p>Lu Ye immersed his mind and explored the pink leaf on the Tree of Glyphs. Gathering his consciousness, a large amount of information flooded into his mind suddenly, which shook him slightly.</p><p>When he took a closer look at the information, Lu Ye’s expression became peculiar.</p><p>This time, he was lucky and obtained a Glyph directly.</p><p>But this Glyph… was different from all the previous ones he had obtained.</p><p>It wasn’t that it was incredibly complex. The most complex Glyph he currently knew was undoubtedly Glyph: Fire Phoenix, followed by Glyph: Void. However, Glyph: Void was something he learned from a book and couldn’t be freely constructed like the Glyphs on the Tree of Glyphs.</p><p>Moreover, it was just information from a single leaf. No matter how complex it was, it couldn’t be too bad.</p><p>The reason it was considered special was that, based on the information, activating this Glyph consumed not Spiritual Power but Soul Power instead.</p><p>In other words, it relied on the power of the Divine Soul.</p><p>Lu Ye was surprised. This turned out to be a Divine Soul Glyph, also known as a Divine Glyph!</p><p>The Way of Glyphs was vast and profound. The ones Lu Ye had learned and mastered so far could be constructed using Spiritual Power. However, if Lu Ye’s cultivation reached the Divine Ocean Realm and he possessed his own Soul Power, many Glyphs could be constructed using Soul Power, allowing him to unleash even more abilities.</p><p>For example, Glyph: Sharp Edge. Constructing it solely as a Glyph could enhance the lethality of Spirit Artifacts, but if constructed with Soul Power, it could be turned into a Divine Soul attack.</p><p>It worked with Glyph: Protection, too. Constructed with Soul Power, it could turn into a Divine Soul barrier.</p><p>But there were some special Glyphs that could only be constructed using Soul Power, and such Glyphs were known as Divine Glyphs.</p><p>What he obtained this time was exactly one of them.</p><p>Divine Glyph: Charm!</p><p>Based on the multitude of information carried by the leaf, Divine Glyph: Charm had the effect of enchanting the mind, similar to the Divine Soul Secret Technique used by Fox Mutant.</p><p>The Fox Mutant’s Divine Soul Secret Technique was Heaven-defying, but that was her innate ability as a Six-Tailed Divine Fox. Ordinary cultivators or Spirit Beasts couldn’t possibly master it. If Divine Glyph: Charm could unleash even a fraction of the power of the Fox Mutant’s Secret Technique, that would already be remarkable in itself.</p><p>Unfortunately, this was a Divine Glyph that required Soul Power to activate. As Lu Ye’s current cultivation level was in the Cloud River Realm, he couldn’t utilize it at all. He could construct it using Spiritual Power, but nothing would happen even if he did so.</p><p>However, there would come a day when his cultivation would reach the Divine Ocean Realm, and naturally, he would be able to use the Divine Glyph then.</p><p>Just this one Divine Glyph had brought him tremendous gains, not to mention the favor bestowed upon him by the Heavens. His own luck and fortune would probably become even more prosperous in the future.</p><p>As for the reward bestowed by the Heavens, he didn’t know what it was…</p><p>Slowly opening his eyes, he stood up.</p><p>When Li Baxian, who stood nearby, saw Lu Ye getting up, he asked, “Little Junior Brother, are we returning to the Arcane Glade?”</p><p>Since the Fox Mutant was dead, and the cultivators in Fox Immortal Valley had dispersed, there was no need to return there.</p><p>“Yes.” Lu Ye nodded and suddenly remembered something, “Let’s make a trip to Fox Immortal Valley first. There’s something there that caught my interest.”</p><p>Li Baxian didn’t inquire about the details and simply nodded. “Very well.”</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
