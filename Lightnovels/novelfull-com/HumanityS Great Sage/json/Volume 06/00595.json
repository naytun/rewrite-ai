However, they were only a Fourth Tier sect today. The main reason for that was the complete annihilation of their Divine Ocean Realm disciples, and the culprit behind it all was the Crimson Blood Sect.</p><p>Back then, in the major battle between the two factions, three First Tier sects in Thousand Demon Ridge were forcefully knocked down from their high positions. Apart from Cult Blackfyre, there were also the Tower of Morning and the Vale of Venom.</p><p>In terms of hatred for the Crimson Blood Sect, these three sects were the strongest in that regard. Mo Yuan had mentioned these three sects to Lu Ye when they first met.</p><p>Tan Sheng’s eyes lit up as he listened. “compelling the wolves to devour the tigers, reaping the benefits without taking action! That’s a great plan, Brother Xia!”</p><p>With just their strength, they couldn’t pose any threat to Lu Ye. It wouldn’t be realistic for them to gather helpers for revenge either. If they did so, there would certainly be a lot of casualties. After all, there were many Wolf Mutants at Lu Ye’s Arcane Glade.</p><p>But if the people from Cult Blackfyre knew about the situation there, they would definitely take action. At that time, the two of them could hide in the shadows to wait for an opportunity to strike and even get a share of the benefits.</p><p>As for discreetly conveying the information to Cult Blackfyre, it naturally wouldn’t be a problem for the two of them.</p><p>After a short rest, the two of them once again took to the skies with their telekinetic techniques and flew towards the outskirts of Grand Wilds Peak, transmitting messages out along the way.</p><p>Time passed by. At the land of baptism, Lu Ye and the others were cultivating separately.</p><p>Lu Ye originally thought they wouldn’t be able to stay in this place for too long, but to his surprise, it wasn’t until three days later that a powerful repulsive force came from all directions, and he quickly stood up.</p><p>Before Lu Ye could make any further movements, his vision suddenly blurred, and he appeared directly on top of the altar. His body staggered for a moment, but he hurriedly stabilized himself.</p><p>Looking up, he saw Li Baxian, Feng Yuechan, Ju Jia, Amber, and Yi Yi, all expelled from the altar, the Spiritual Power surging within them.</p><p>Judging from the fluctuations of their Spiritual Power, it was evident that their cultivation had improved.</p><p>Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan were originally in the Fifth Order Cloud River Realm, but they had now reached the Sixth Order in just over a month since their last breakthrough.</p><p>Yi Yi and Amber’s auras had also reached a level comparable to the Fourth Order.</p><p>Lu Ye and Ju Jia had both reached the Fifth Order!</p><p>Lu Ye had broken through just one day ago. The speed of his cultivation in that place was even higher than the efficiency of using the Golden Amulet. If he had not experienced it for himself, he could hardly believe it was true.</p><p>“Little Junior Brother, do you feel it?” Li Baxian gently clenched his fist, then opened it, and clenched it again, as if experiencing the growth of his own power.</p><p>Lu Ye nodded.</p><p>During these three days, his experience was the most obvious since he didn’t have to focus his mind during cultivation. With the continuous functioning of the small Spirit Gathering Funnels, he could naturally and continuously devour the white mist without doing anything, and even with much higher efficiency than the others.</p><p>But It was different for Li Baxian and the others. They had been immersed in their cultivation all along and only now felt the changes within themselves.</p><p>This breakthrough not only improved their cultivation, but also strengthened their physique and Mental Power. The speed of the River of Spiritual Power’s flow within their bodies had also become faster. Compared to before, the speed had increased by at least thirty percent.</p><p>Clearly, these were the benefits brought on by the Divine Baptism.</p><p>An advancement in their cultivation meant a strengthening of their power, as well as the enhancement of their physique and Mental Power. The increased speed of the River of Spiritual Power’s flow further augmented their power.</p><p>It could be said that this cultivation session was not a simple improvement of a small level for everyone.</p><p>Compared to three days ago, the change in their power was like night and day.</p><p>However, true strength could only be demonstrated through life and death battles. Thus, Lu Ye was unsure what his true level was at currently.</p><p>Li Baxian still had an incredulous expression on his face. After a long while, he sighed. “As the ancient people once said, when one person achieves greatness, even chickens and dogs can ascend to the Heavens. This time, we owe it to Little Junior Brother for killing the Fox Mutant.”</p><p>If Lu Ye hadn’t killed the Fox Mutant and received the reward of the Heavens, they wouldn’t have obtained such opportunities. As for the thousands of Middle Grade Spirit Stones consumed to activate the altar… Compared to the benefits gained, it was nothing. Not to mention thousands, even tens of thousands of Spirit Stones couldn’t compare with what they got.</p><p>“What do you mean chicken and dogs… I’m not an animal…” Feng Yuechan pouted, looking displeased.</p><p>Li Baxian laughed heartily, “It means what it means!”</p><p>Feng Yuechan smiled and turned to Lu Ye. “But we really do have to thank Junior Brother Lu this time. With this opportunity, our future cultivation path will definitely be broader and smoother.”</p><p>What she said was right. Although the Cloud River Realm was not the foundational realm of cultivation for cultivators, their level in the Cloud River Realm was not that high. The benefits they obtained this time could be said to have laid a more solid foundation for them and would greatly benefit their future growth.</p><p>“We are a family, so why does Senior Sister speak as if we are from two different families?” Lu Ye said with some amusement.</p><p>Feng Yuechan clearly misunderstood and glanced at Li Baxian, a blush appearing on her face.</p><p>“The altar…” Li Baxian turned to look at the altar. He had originally planned to wait until their cultivation stabilized before cultivating again. However, when he glanced over, he realized that the altar had already cracked, and the words that reached his mouth were swallowed back down.</p><p>Lu Ye also noticed the change in the altar and said thoughtfully, “It seems that the reward from the Heavens was a one-time thing.”</p><p>Though, even if the altar hadn’t cracked, they still wouldn’t be able to reactivate the altar without the golden mark.</p><p>And now, it seemed like the altar located deep in Fox Immortal Valley was a reward that the Heavens had prepared long ago.</p><p>“Let’s return to the Arcane Glade,” Li Baxian said.</p><p>With the altar destroyed, there was no need to stay in Fox Immortal Valley any longer.</p><p>After a moment, several streams of light shot up into the sky, heading straight towards Arcane the Glade, followed closely by the vast pack of wolves.</p><p>“Is there something on your mind, Little Junior Brother?” Li Baxian leaned in and asked.</p><p>Lu Ye replied, “Tan Sheng and Xia Liang are not dead yet, and the location of the Arcane Glade has been exposed. They will definitely come back.”</p><p>Li Baxian’s expression also darkened. It was regrettable that they couldn’t kill Xia Liang and Tan Sheng. When Feng Yuechan and Ju Jia led the wolf pack to assist them, they had given the Wolf Mutants the order to surround but not to kill them as they couldn’t determine the allegiances of the other people. Actually engaging them in battle would undoubtedly result in significant losses for the wolf pack.</p><p>Even though the order had been given, the wolf pack were not cultivators and did not possess considerable Spiritual Intelligence. At that time, Feng Yuechan was trying to restrain Li Baxian, and Ju Jia had been enslaved by the Fox Mutant with her Divine Soul Secret Technique. In the midst of the chaos, Tan Sheng and Xia Liang managed to escape with their lives.</p><p>After all, those two were Ninth Order cultivators and not so easily killed.</p><p>They had suffered a great loss the last time because they were caught off guard, unaware of the existence of the wolf pack, resulting in heavy injuries for two while Wei Que was killed outright.</p><p>Now, they were well aware of the strength in the Arcane Glade, so if they were to return, they would surely be fully prepared.</p><p>“The situation may not be so bad.” Li Baxian shook his head.</p><p>“Why do you say that?”</p><p>Li Baxian explained, “Since they know the strength of the Arcane Glade, they must also be aware that bringing fewer people would just be futile. But even if they did bring a sufficient number of people, they would undoubtedly suffer heavy casualties in a fight, which they won’t be able to accept. In order to completely overwhelm our Arcane Glade, they would need to bring hundreds of people at the very least.”</p><p>“What if they really brought hundreds of people?”</p><p>Li Baxian’s brow furrowed slightly. “I don’t think it’ll come to that…”</p><p>“Personal grudges alone shouldn’t be enough to make them act, but don’t forget that I carry a significant bounty on me, Senior Brother. Money has always been a powerful motivator. Even if they simply reveal the location of the Arcane Glade, we will still face constant troubles in the future.”</p><p>“Is Little Junior Brother suggesting…” freewёbn૦νeɭ.com</p><p>Lu Ye fell silent. He had thought that selecting the location of their Arcane Glade to be deep in Grand Wilds Peak, and with the wolf pack to guard them, would ensure their safety, but trouble had already arisen in such a short time.</p><p>Recalling the Tertius-level Arcane Glade they obtained last time, he also hadn’t been able to hold onto it for long. He had only entered the Myriad Beast Domain’s Hidden Realms when it was stolen by someone else.</p><p>He was still someone who had Heaven’s favor, after all. He had great fortune and auspicious luck, but how come that didn’t seem to apply with Arcane Glades?</p><p>“There are two options. We either move the Arcane Glade or secure a retreat route.”</p><p>“Moving the Arcane Glade…” Li Baxian shook his head. “The Arcane Glade has the Divine Opportunity Column that you bought, Little Junior Brother. If we move it, we would be wasting 100,000 Contribution Points for nothing. Furthermore, transferring the Arcane Glade would cause the level of the Wisp of Sanctification to decline…”</p><p>Lu Ye was extremely surprised. “Transferring the Arcane Glade would cause the level of the Wisp of Sanctification to decline?” He genuinely had no idea about this.</p><p>Li Baxian nodded. “Though there is a way to extract the Wisp of Sanctification again, each extraction would lower its level by one.”</p><p>“So to say, if we move the Arcane Glade, we would only have a Secundus-level Arcane Glade?”</p><p>And a Divine Opportunity Column would also be consumed in compensation.</p><p>So, in the end, when the Tertius-level Arcane Glade’s Wisp of Sanctification was stolen, they would only have obtained a Quartus-level Wisp of Sanctification. What a waste that would be.</p><p>“That’s right, so unless absolutely necessary, we should avoid moving the Arcane Glade.”</p><p>Lu Ye nodded. “Then, we should focus on securing retreat routes instead. After we return, I will set up several Teleportation Wards just in case.”</p><p>With Teleportation Wards in place, then even if the Arcane Glade were breached, their safety would be reasonably guaranteed.</p><p>In the Carnage Colosseum, when Lu Ye was in the Third Order Cloud River Realm, the Teleportation Wards he set up could cover a range of a hundred kilometers. Now that he was in the Fifth Order and with his increased power, the range he could cover would surely be wider.</p><p>Regardless of what Tan Sheng and Xia Liang would do, taking care of their own side first was never a bad idea.</p><p>After discussing it with Li Baxian for a while, Lu Ye’s plan became clearer in his mind.</p><p>They swiftly flew back and by the time evening approached, they could see Ameliorate Valley in the distance. It had been a few days since they returned and there was no one guarding the Arcane Glade, but fortunately, the Wards that Lu Ye had set up were still functioning perfectly. From a distance, there were no signs of the Arcane Glade being attacked.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
