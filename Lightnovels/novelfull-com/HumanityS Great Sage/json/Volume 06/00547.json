It seemed like he would have to replenish the fuel again once he was back.</p><p>Hua Ci sat right across from him, sending food to his bowl from time to time while saying, “It’s easy to be blinded by the complexities of the world. You should eat more to nurture yourself.”</p><p>Lu Ye pretended not to have heard her.</p><p>“Where’s Yi Yi and Amber? I don’t see them around.”</p><p>“They’ve returned to the Outpost.” Lu Ye took down two Storage Bags from his belt as he spoke, casually tossing them to the table.</p><p>The most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on freёwebnovel.com.</p><p>Hua Ci picked them up and when she saw the contents inside, she was surprised. “There’s so much in here. Which sect did you rob this time?”</p><p>Each Storage Bag was filled with the resources sent over by First-Tier Sects, and the two Storage Bags were worth a whopping 600,000 Contribution Points in goods. Of course, if these things were to be sold to the Vault of Providence, the value would be cut down slightly.</p><p>Lu Ye drew a circle in the air. “All of the Core Circle Sects. Not one of them escaped me this time.”</p><p>Hua Ci Didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. “What did they do to you?”</p><p>“It’s a long story; let’s not talk about that.”</p><p>Naturally, there was no need to tell Hua Ci about how he was chased in the Carnage Colosseum and was forced to use the Golden Body Token in the end, then having to summon a Divine Opportunity Column before he could escape successfully. It would just make her worry for nothing.</p><p>“I can’t use these for my cultivation…”</p><p>“If you can’t use it, just sell it and get some Contribution Points out of it. Contribution Points will be useful once you reach the Cloud River Battlefield.”</p><p>Hua Ci thought about it and nodded. “Very well. I’ll accept it.”</p><p>“What’s with that pool of poison?” Lu Ye casually asked.</p><p>“It’s the Poison Spring of the Myriad Poison Forest. I found it by chance and drew it over there. That way, cultivating will be much more effective than just refining the fog.”</p><p>It was exactly her ability to refine the energy in the pool that caused the Myriad Poison Forest to shrink in such a short amount of time. The changes happening in the forest had already attracted the attention of many. Only, nobody could figure out what was going on. After all, in the Spirit Creek Realm, the only person who could enter and leave the forest’s depths unharmed was Lu Ye.</p><p>Lu Ye was curious. “You’ve already reached Heaven Nine, so how are you going to keep cultivating?”</p><p>Heaven Nine was the peak of the Spirit Creek Realm. Once one reached this level, then there was no way to keep on cultivating unless one advanced into the Cloud River Realm.</p><p>“I have my ways.” Hua Ci smiled.</p><p>“Are you planning to refine the entire Poison Spring before moving on to the Cloud River Realm?”</p><p>“Of course. It’s rare to have such a cultivation environment, so of course I’m going to make good use of it. Is there a similar place as this in the Cloud River Battlefield?”</p><p>“I haven’t found one, but I’ll take note of it for you once I return.”</p><p>“Mutant Cores of Spirit Beasts will also work. Some of their cores are highly toxic.”</p><p>“The Vault of Providence should have something like that. Once you advance into the Cloud River Realm, you can go and buy some yourself. I’ll also keep an eye out for you.” Then, he suddenly thought of something. “Have you reached the Roll of Supremacy yet?”</p><p>Hua Ci then shot him a playful wink. “I’ve occupied the top of the Roll of Supremacy for a few months now. Didn’t you know?”</p><p>Lu Ye was stunned. “The top of the Roll of Supremacy? You?”</p><p>“Don’t you look down on me!” Hua Ci wagged her fingers at him.</p><p>Hua Ci had the strength to make an impact on the Roll of Supremacy, that Lu Ye was sure of. Back then, she had killed many Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators in the Myriad Poison Forest, but to say that she could occupy the top spot for months in a row was still more or less a surprise to him.</p><p>But naturally, Hua Ci wouldn’t joke about such a thing to him.</p><p>First, there was the Crimson Blood Sect’s Yi Ye who ruled the Roll of Supremacy for several months, and now there was the Crimson Blood Sect’s Hua Ci taking the top spot. And, from how things were going, it seemed she would continue to dominate the rankings for a long time to come.</p><p>Especially since Hua Ci was still publicly known as a Medical Cultivator…</p><p>Lu Ye was curious to know what the mood of those Heaven Nine cultivators on the Roll of Supremacy was like nowadays.</p><p>Since ancient times, Medical Cultivators were rarely able to make it within the top 50 of the Roll of Supremacy, but then there was Hua Ci, who occupied the topmost position.</p><p>On second thought, however, Hua Ci may be a Medical Cultivator, but after gaining her complete inheritance, she was no longer the same as the other regular Medical Cultivators.</p><p>Most such cultivators would also cultivate the Way of Spells or some other school for the sake of self-preservation, but Hua Ci did not adopt any of them. Strictly speaking, she was now a Poisoneer.</p><p>Medicine and poison have always been of one category, and as a Poisoneer, Hua Ci was different from the general Poisoneer. If she willed it, then she could even emit poison from her breath, not to mention transmitting venom through touch.</p><p>With this sort of heritage, occupying the top spot of the Roll of Supremacy should naturally be no issue for her. The Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators who challenged her would often not be able to see her before their minds were stirred up by her poison and forced to admit defeat or flee. After that happened a few times, nobody dared to challenge Hua Ci for her position anymore.</p><p>What the Thousand Demon Ridge wanted to know was where this Crimson Blood Sect’s Medical Cultivator was hiding since no one had seen her in the Spirit Creek Battlefield. She never even appeared in the Outposts of any sect before.</p><p>To the Thousand Demon Ridge, Lu Ye was a nightmare, but at the very least, he would show himself outside and stir up some wind and rain. However, Hua Ci was like a riddle without an answer.</p><p>In the entirety of the Spirit Creek Battlefield, in the recent year or so, Bing Zhou’s Crimson Blood Sect was simply like a mountain weighing down on the heads of the Thousand Demon Ridge’s cultivators, so heavy that it made it hard for them to breathe.</p><p>After having his fill of food and drink, Lu Ye stretched his back with a comfy look on his face.</p><p>While cleaning up the dishes, Hua Ci asked, “Are you leaving now?” freeωebnovēl.c૦m</p><p>“En. You should come to the Cloud River Battlefield soon, too. I’ll be waiting for you there.”</p><p>“I will.”</p><p>“By the way, do you have more of the Omnipoison Pill you gave me last time?”</p><p>Those pills could play a very strong role in specific environments. For example, in the Myriad Beast Domain. If Lu Ye hadn’t sacrificed the Omnipoison Pill then, he wouldn’t have been able to deal with that Niu Meng. Even though that pill was a double-edged sword, if used well, it can also play a role in turning the tides in a desperate situation.</p><p>“I do.” While saying so, Hua Ci reached into her dress and pulled out a handful of green Omnipoison Pills that were still warm with her body heat.</p><p>Lu Ye’s eyes twitched at that. Looking at the dozen of Omnipoison Pills, he didn’t stand on ceremony and took three from the pile, storing them inside his Storage Sphere.</p><p>“Take more. I can always make more,” Hua Ci insisted.</p><p>“No need. These are enough for self-defense.”</p><p>He didn’t know what it cost Hua Ci to make these Omnipoison Pills, but he was sure that they didn’t come easy, so he naturally couldn’t squander it.</p><p>“I’m going now.” Lu Ye turned around and waved to her before bringing out his Spirit Boat. Upon stepping on it and pouring his Spiritual Power into it, it took to the skies.</p><p>Hua Ci stood in place, watching him go, raising her hands around her mouth and shouting, “Be careful out there, my child’s father!”</p><p>Lu Ye stumbled and almost fell off his Spirit Boat. He looked down and glared at Hua Ci, only to see her giggling sweetly like blossoming flowers.</p><p>After watching Lu Ye’s figure disappear into the distance, Hua Ci also stretched her back, accentuating her beautiful and graceful figure. She was going to be alone again, but in these recent months, she had gotten used to such a life, so she didn’t feel that lonely.</p><p>Still… she had to work hard on cultivating and strive to refine the Poison Spring entirely so that she could join him on the Cloud River Battlefield soon.</p><p>She was still a Medical Cultivator at the very least and could help him heal his injuries as she followed him around.</p><p>Through the clear blue sky and picturesque scenery, Lu Ye hurried on his way.</p><p>The calm journey led him out of the Core Circle, into the Inner Circle, then to the Outer Circle before he finally made it to his Outpost.</p><p>In fact, he could have used the Divine Opportunity Column of the Divine Trade Association nearby to teleport straight back to the Outpost after leaving the Myriad Poison Forest, but that would also cost a good amount of Contribution Points.</p><p>It wasn’t that he had anything to do recently anyway, and he couldn’t enter the Cloud River Battlefield either, so there was no need to waste money.</p><p>In three days, Lu Ye arrived at the Crimson Blood Sect’s Outpost, and as soon as he entered the Grand Defensive Ward, he heard the clear voice of an eagle ring out.</p><p>Raising his head to look at the Spirit Peak nearby, he saw a familiar figure standing there, staring at him.</p><p>Beaky had returned.</p><p>Lu Ye got on his Spirit Artifact and flew towards the Spirit Peak and arrived at the eagle’s nest, feeding the fish that he had caught from Lunarmere to Beaky before playing with it for a while.</p><p>Then, he entered the Sanctum of Providence.</p><p>An endless stream of disciples saluted him on the way. There were those from the Crimson Blood Sect itself, as well as those from outside sects who had come to train. There were even female cultivators with hot personalities that would take the initiative to come up and make small talk with him, looks of reverence clear in their eyes.</p><p>After dismissing those cultivators, Lu Ye stood in front of the Divine Opportunity Column and pressed his hand on it, then he connected his consciousness to the Vault of Providence.</p><p>He had to sell some things to the Vault of Providence; only then could he ensure that he would have enough Contribution Points for his use.</p><p>This time, he had received a total of twenty to thirty million worth of resources, so even if he sold them all to the Vault of Providence and took the sale loss, he would still be able to pocket more than ten thousand million Contribution Points.</p><p>Naturally, however, Lu Ye wouldn’t sell everything.</p><p>As long as he had enough Contribution Points for his own temporary use, then that was enough. The rest would be better off handed over to his Second Senior Sister to ensure the smooth development and operation of the sect.</p><p>Especially as his Second Senior Sister was now in the Divine Ocean Realm, her cultivation needs were quite hefty.</p><p>Cultivators in the Spirit Creek Realm could cultivate in the Spirit Creek Battlefield, but as they reached the Cloud River Realm and arrived at the Cloud River Battlefield, there was no specific battlefield to head to after advancing into the Real Lake Realm.</p><p>Lu Ye wasn’t particularly sure how the Real Lake Realm and Divine Ocean Realm Masters were supposed to cultivate, but it was said to be related to a clan’s heritage. The stronger the clan’s heritage, the faster the Real Lake Realm and Divine Ocean Realm Masters could advance.</p><p>So, in the entirety of Jiu Zhou, the powerful sects kept on pumping out strong experts, whereas the weaker sects could only slowly accumulate strength and develop, just waiting for the day that they could leap over the dragon’s gate.</p><p>With Shui Yuan’s talent, she had, in fact, long been qualified to advance to the Divine Sea Realm, but until half a year ago, she was still in the Ninth Order Real Lake Realm.</p><p>It wasn’t that she wasn’t qualified to advance, but it was due to the Crimson Blood Sect’s pitiful condition that they did not have enough resources to support her in her cultivation.</p><p>However, with the rise of Lu Ye, the good days had finally come for the Crimson Blood Sect.</p><p>When Lu Ye put together a Grand Sky Coalition army in the Inner Circle and conquered all the four corners of the realm, he forced the Thousand Demon Ridge to bend to his will and sent out a great offering of resources in order to calm the situation down.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
