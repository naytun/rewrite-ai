In just two days, he had nearly 300 Ward Flags ready.</p><p>Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan also found several suitable locations for setting up Teleportation Wards.</p><p>With the consumption of a large number of Ward Flags, one Ward took shape after another, and soon the 300 Ward Flags were completely depleted.</p><p>On the fourth day after returning from Fox Immortal Valley, while Lu Ye was refining more Ward Flags, he suddenly looked up and glanced in a certain direction outside of the Arcane Glade.</p><p>In the next moment, he got up and flew out of the Arcane Glade. As his figure rushed out of the Grand Defensive Ward, he instantly activated Glyph: Invisibility and Glyph: Conceal Presence, causing his figure to quickly disappear.</p><p>Less than half a kilometer from the Arcane Glade, Yan Gui quietly waited behind a large tree while concealing his figure.</p><p>He had rushed all the way here after receiving Tu Guanxiong’s order. With his cultivation in the Seventh Order Cloud River Realm, it shouldn’t have taken him four days to arrive.</p><p>However, this place was deep within Grand Wilds Peak, and there were many dangers along the way. Fortunately, he was a Ghost Cultivator and could avoid many unnecessary battles, but it still caused some delay.</p><p>He had only just arrived at Ameliorate Valley today, but unexpectedly, it wasn’t long before he triggered an Alarm Ward.</p><p>He immediately distanced himself from the location of the Alarm Ward and silently observed from the shadows.</p><p>Tu Guanxiong only instructed him to investigate the situation in Ameliorate Valley without specifically mentioning what was there. However, the fact that both Tu Guanxiong and Huo Liaoyuan attached great importance to it indicated that there were some secrets hidden here in Ameliorate Valley.</p><p>Since there was an Alarm Ward, someone must have set it up.</p><p>Who was hiding here?</p><p>Now that he had triggered the Alarm Ward, the person who laid the Ward would surely come to investigate, and then he would be found out. However, what puzzled him was that he had waited for half a day but still hadn’t seen a trace of anyone.</p><p>Almost a thousand meters away from him, Lu Ye concealed himself and silently observed the situation. There were no signs of wild animals or Spirit Beasts in the vicinity, and he couldn’t catch any anomalies around him either…</p><p>Someone had been here!</p><p>Moreover, from the current situation, it was highly likely that it was a Ghost Cultivator!</p><p>He rushed out the moment the Ward was triggered, but still failed to catch the other person. It was clear that they had gone into hiding, showing that this Ghost Cultivator was a cautious person.</p><p>[Was it someone sent by Tan Sheng and Xia Liang?]</p><p>It seemed unlikely since the two of them knew the situation in the Arcane Glade like the back of their hands, so why would they send a Ghost Cultivator here?</p><p>Could it be a passerby?</p><p>Perhaps… Perhaps not…</p><p>Lu Ye moved slowly with his aura completely concealed, quietly looking around his surroundings. With his Mental Power enhanced again, he could sense any abnormalities without relying on Glyph: Insight within a range of a hundred meters.</p><p>After a cup of tea’s time, then an incense stick of time…</p><p>The game in the dark unfolded silently.</p><p>It wasn’t until nearly an hour later that Lu Ye suddenly turned his head and looked towards the back of a large tree. Something… seemed off over there.</p><p>With Glyph: Insight empowering his vision, colorful lights began to flow. As expected, behind the large tree, amidst the flowing and intertwining colors, the outline of a slightly short figure was revealed.</p><p>He quietly approached.</p><p>Yan Gui suddenly felt a sense of unease. Though it was faint, as someone who often ventured into dangerous places as a Ghost Cultivator, he was always cautious. Otherwise, Tu Guanxiong wouldn’t have trusted him to come here alone to investigate the situation.</p><p>He immediately held his breath and focused his senses, silently searching for the source of his unease.</p><p>It was then that a sudden surge of Spiritual Power fluctuations appeared behind him. Without hesitation, he quickly turned around, the scimitar in his hands glowing with a Spiritual Light as he blocked behind him.</p><p>A figure had appeared not far behind him at some point in time, and as the fiery red blade descended, Yan Gui felt a tremendous force accompanied by the eruption of Spiritual Power coming from the front, which sent him flying backwards, and the blood and Qi around his chest felt like it was to tumbling.</p><p>His Concealment was broken, and his figure was revealed in the air.</p><p>From the air, he recognized the face of the person who had attacked him at a glance. Eyes flickering, he exclaimed, “Yi Ye!”</p><p>[So that’s how it is!]</p><p>It finally dawned on him why Senior Brother Tu and Senior Brother Huo would ask him to come and investigate the place, it turned out that this was Yi Ye’s hiding place. ƒгeeweɓn૦vel.com</p><p>He had seen Lu Ye’s image before. The Sacred Universe Arcane Glade was led by Cult Blackfyre, who shared deep enmity with the Crimson Blood Sect, and Huo Liaoyuan had obtained an Image Stone from somewhere, which Yi Ye’s image was imprinted into.</p><p>Huo Liaoyuan’s intention was undoubtedly to have all of Cult Blackfyre acolytes memorize Yi Ye’s appearance.</p><p>So even though Yan Gui had never seen Lu Ye before, he recognized who he was at a glance.</p><p>Excitement and exhilaration surged in his heart… followed by boundless astonishment.</p><p>A storm of blade strikes enveloped him, with each blade emitting a deathly aura. Yan Gui kept retreating, but in a short span of time, his hand had become numb and the web of his thumb was ripped while the Spiritual Power grew tumultuous within his body!</p><p>[How is this guy… so strong?]</p><p>Even though Yan Gui was a Ghost Cultivator and not skilled in direct confrontations, he was still in the Seventh Order. The ebb of Yi Ye’s Spiritual Power was only in the Fifth Order, yet he couldn’t resist him at all. Faced with the ferocious and relentless blade strikes, he couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed.</p><p>[I’m going to die!] The terrifying thought couldn’t help but form in his mind. The excitement on Yan Gui’s face had long vanished, leaving only fear and panic behind.</p><p>Lu Ye didn’t use his full strength with the first strike because he couldn’t determine the identity of the person who came.</p><p>However, when Yan Gui shouted out his name, their stance became clear to him.</p><p>Since he recognized him, he naturally knew his background. If the other party belonged to the Grand Sky Coalition, they would have revealed their Battle Imprint willingly. Otherwise… It meant they were from Thousand Demon Ridge.</p><p>So, from the second strike onward, Lu Yi Ye didn’t hold back.</p><p>*Chi la…* Yan Gui screamed in agony as the clothes on his chest were torn open, revealing a bloody wound.</p><p>Senses dulled by pain, Yan Gui’s defense became even more chaotic. Lu Yi Ye took advantage of this and struck again with a cut that nearly beheaded Yan Gui, but at the last moment, the latter had raised his own Spirit Artifact to block the would-be fatal strike. Even so, he was sent flying, blood spraying in the air.</p><p>Landing miserably on the ground, Yan Gui didn’t immediately escape. Instead, he placed his hand on his Battle Imprint…</p><p>Yan Gui did not know why Yi Ye was so strong, but he knew that he had been exposed, and that he would surely meet an unfortunate end. Regardless, he had to transmit the information back no matter what. He couldn’t just die in vain.</p><p>He didn’t even consider begging for mercy because he knew that begging would only bring greater humiliation and torment to himself.</p><p>However, in the next moment, his heart suddenly contracted violently, and his strength and vitality rapidly dissipated. He looked down and saw a fiery saber piercing through his chest, and the raging Spiritual Power exploded inside him, causing him to stumble and cough up blood.</p><p>The brightness in his eyes quickly dimmed as Lu Ye withdrew his sword, and his body fell forward.</p><p>Shaking the blood off his Inviolable Saber, Lu Ye placed it back into its sheath.</p><p>A small red light floated out from the body of the Ghost Cultivator in front of him and landed on the back of Lu Ye’s hand like a firefly.</p><p>Frowning at the corpse before him, Lu Ye suddenly realized… that he seemed to have underestimated his current strength.</p><p>Even though the opponent was a Ghost Cultivator who wasn’t skilled in direct combat, he was still in the Seventh Order. Yet, in the face of Lu Ye’s current self, he could barely put up the slightest resistance.</p><p>Recalling the Seventh Order Combat Cultivator they had encountered in the Carnage Colosseum, he and Li Baxian had fought with all their might. In the end, if he hadn’t successfully activated the Beast Form Secret Technique, it would have been hard to say who would have emerged victorious.</p><p>In just a short two months, a cultivator of the Seventh Order that once pushed him and his two senior brothers to their limits could not even last for thirty breaths against him now. The growth of his own strength could be described as Earth-shattering</p><p>Of course, he was only in the Third Order Cloud River Realm at the Carnage Colosseum, whereas now, in just a little over two months, he had advanced by two Orders and reached the Fifth Order Cloud River Realm.</p><p>But it was undeniable that the Divine Baptism he had obtained from the altar at Fox Immortal Valley had greatly enhanced his foundation.</p><p>Especially the increased flow rate of Spiritual Power in his body. The faster the Spiritual Power flowed within a cultivator’s body, the stronger the power that could be instantly erupted from one.</p><p>Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan arrived together and landed nearby. Seeing the corpse in front of them, Li Baxian asked, “What happened?”</p><p>Lu Ye replied, “Someone came to investigate.”</p><p>Li Baxian frowned. “Was it Xia Liang? Tan Sheng?” Then, he changed his mind. “No, they are well aware of the situation in the Arcane Glade. There’s no need for them to send someone to investigate. Could it be a passerby?”</p><p>“Doesn’t seem like it.” Lu Ye shook his head. If it were just a passerby, it wouldn’t make sense for them to have accurately located Ameliorate Valley. Moreover, recalling the reaction he had seen when the Ghost Cultivator caught a glimpse of his appearance, it felt more like this cultivator had been sent here unknowingly to gather information.</p><p>Raising his hand, Lu Ye used his Spiritual Power to retrieve two Storage Bags from the body.</p><p>In just a moment, the Restraining Locks on the Storage Bags were opened, and Lu Ye quickly searched through them. He soon found a jade tablet that resembled an identification badge with a pattern of a palace on the front and a large character engraved in the middle of it.</p><p>[Huan!]</p><p>Looking at the back, it should be the name of the deceased Ghost Cultivator, Yan Gui.</p><p>Lu Ye tossed the jade tablet to Li Baxian, who glanced at it and pondered, “It might be someone from the Universe Clan.”</p><p>Universe Clan…</p><p>Lu Ye tried to remember and vaguely recalled that it was a Fifth Tier sect. He had seen the marking of their Sect Outpost on the 10-point map during the Inner Circle of the battlefield.</p><p>“Sacred Universe Arcane Glade!” Li Baxian murmured again.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Li Baxian took out his 10-point map and examined it, then furrowed his brow. “If it’s someone from the Universe Clan, then they might be from the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade! The Sacred Universe Arcane Glade is a large-scale Arcane Glade jointly owned by the Universe Clan and another force from Thousand Demon Ridge. They’re marked on the 10-point map and are only less than two thousand kilometers away from us.”</p><p>A thousand or so kilometers was undoubtedly a long distance for a Spirit Creek Realm cultivator.</p><p>However, for one in the Cloud River Realm, it wasn’t a considerable distance at all. With Lu Ye’s current speed, even if he only flew with telekinesis and traveled at full speed, it would only take him about a day.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
