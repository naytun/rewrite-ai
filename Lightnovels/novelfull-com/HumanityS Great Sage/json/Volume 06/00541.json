Does anyone have any opinions?”</p><p>“I agree.”</p><p>“No objections!”</p><p>“I have a suggestion. Let’s try to find Heaven Nine cultivators in the Roll of Supremacy. If they’re too weak, they won’t be able to verify anything. Furthermore, if possible, we may be able to seize the opportunity to eliminate him.”</p><p>“Very well, let’s settle it at that. My Hundred Pass Sect can send one person.”</p><p>“The Seacliff Pavilion will send one person!”</p><p>“My Flying Thunder Cult will send one person.”</p><p>With the contributions of each Divine Ocean Realm cultivator, they quickly formed a team of about twenty to thirty people, all of whom were from the Roll of Supremacy, with no shortage of those who ranked in the top twenty.</p><p>“Then please send word to the Spirit Creek Battlefield and have them make their move as soon as possible,” said an elderly Divine Ocean Realm cultivator who had been silent in the chief seat this whole while.</p><p>After receiving their orders, they immediately began to spread the message.</p><p>This content is taken from freeweɓnovel.cѳm.</p><p>However, it was at that moment that some news seemed to come from the outside. Many Divine Ocean Realm Masters checked the messages one after another.</p><p>After a short while, everyone’s expressions became serious.</p><p>Even the Divine Ocean Realm elder who had spoken earlier furrowed his brow and raised his hand to say, “Let’s put what we were discussing on hold for now.” He looked around with his seemingly cloudy eyes and slowly spoke, “We’ve received information that just a quarter of an incense stick of time ago, the Outpost of the Clouded Sun Clan was breached by Yi Ye, and more than ten people were killed!”</p><p>As soon as he spoke, the entire hall fell silent.</p><p>They were just discussing how they were going to verify their previous speculation, but now it seemed there was no need to verify anything. Yi Ye had already attacked the Clouded Sun Clan’s Outpost, invalidating their previous conjecture.</p><p>Where the gazes of many converged, a Divine Ocean Realm expert, whose eyes seemed to be spewing fire, gritted his teeth and cursed, “That little bastard!”</p><p>This man was a Divine Ocean Realm cultivator from the Clouded Sun Sect, and coincidentally, he also happened to receive the information from his clan about what had happened in the Spirit Creek Battlefield while he was here.</p><p>Though in comparison, the casualties sustained by their acolytes were much lower compared to the New Moon Sect, it was mainly because they had learned from the New Moon Sect’s experience and quickly evacuated their men. Otherwise, with Yi Ye’s proclivities, there would likely have been rivers of blood and mountains of corpses.</p><p>“Who has a 10-point map of the Spirit Creek Battlefield?” the elder presiding over the discussion asked.</p><p>Never did he expect that a Divine Ocean Realm expert like himself would still have to personally inquire about the matters in the Spirit Creek Battlefield, but the Spirit Creek Realm was the foundation of every sect, and this matter had reached a point where he needed to make personal inquiries.</p><p>“I have one.” At the emergence of that sentence, a 10-point map of the Spirit Creek Battlefield was taken out, and the Divine Ocean Realm expert poured his Spiritual Power into it while someone else raised their hand to construct a peculiar Glyph.</p><p>The Glyph and the detailed map were connected, and in the next moment, a large image appeared before everyone’s eyes.</p><p>The image projected was that of the 10-point map of the Spirit Creek Battlefield.</p><p>“The New Moon Sect’s Outpost is not that close to the Clouded Sun Clan’s Outpost, but it’s not far either.” The presiding elder looked at the map and continued, “With Yi Ye’s strength, he should be able to reach there in less than half a day, so the timing matches up. However, several other Outposts of other sects between the two of them. Why did Yi Ye leave those Outposts alone and specifically attack the Clouded Sun Clan’s Outpost?”</p><p>From Yi Ye’s route of action, he seemed to be targeting the Clouded Sun Clan’s Outpost specifically.</p><p>“Brother Fu, is there any reason behind this?”</p><p>The Divine Ocean Realm expert from the Clouded Sun Clan, the one surnamed Fu, had an unsightly expression on his face. “We received news earlier that an acolyte named Wei Que from our clan participated in the siege against Yi Ye in the Carnage Colosseum. That’s most likely the reason why Yi Ye came to our doorstep.”</p><p>At his words, the faces of many Divine Ocean Realm cultivators also became unsightly.</p><p>First, there was Tan Sheng from the New Moon Sect, and now Wei Que from the Clouded Sun Clan. Yi Ye was acting with specific targets in mind.</p><p>However, they weren’t the only ones who participated in the siege against Yi Ye. Many of them had acolytes under their wings that were involved as well. Did this mean that Yi Ye would also come to their Outposts? Some weren’t able to determine this as they didn’t know whether the acolytes of their sects were involved in what happened in the Carnage Colosseum or not.</p><p>This was a risky situation!</p><p>They quickly sent messages out, warning the acolytes in the Spirit Creek Battlefield to be on alert, and to immediately retreat to Jiu Zhou as soon as they discovered Yi Ye’s tracks. If the Outpost was breached, there was no way the Blessings of the Divine Opportunity Column could be maintained, but the most important thing now was to ensure the safety of their own acolytes.</p><p>“Brother Fu, did the Heavens enact punishment on Yi Ye after he killed those men?”</p><p>The cultivator surnamed Fu responded, “I’ll inquire about it.”</p><p>He sent a message back to his clan to ask about the situation, and it wasn’t long before a response came back. “Yes, purple lightning was coiling around his body as soon as he made a move against the first person.”</p><p>The nearly a hundred Divine Ocean Realm experts in the hall fell silent.</p><p>They couldn’t figure out what the situation was with Yi Ye. They had initially speculated that he had a special method to suppress Heavens’ punishment, but the information they now received didn’t seem to make sense.</p><p>If he had the means of Suppressing the punishment, then the purple lightning shouldn’t have appeared around him, but if he didn’t suppress it, how could Yi Ye remain unscathed?</p><p>After a while, the presiding elder spoke, “A few months ago, our Thousand Demon Ridge, gave in to his demands. In just a few months, Yi Ye has once again made such impertinent demands. We shouldn’t encourage this kind of deviant behavior. Otherwise, he might come every few months, then should we be expected to compromise every single time?”</p><p>Everyone fell silent.</p><p>On careful thought, even though Yi Ye was despicable in some ways, he could still be considered a reasonable person.</p><p>He stopped troubling the sects of the Thousand Demon Ridge after receiving the peace offering from them last time, and it wasn’t long before he advanced into the Cloud River Realm and left the Spirit Creek Battlefield.</p><p>It wasn’t that he acted without reason this time either. If it wasn’t for the targeted attack he suffered in the Carnage Colosseum, he probably wouldn’t have come to the Spirit Creek Battlefield.</p><p>Of course, even if they thought that way, they wouldn’t say it out loud.</p><p>“What do you think, Elder Chen?” someone asked.</p><p>“Let’s send some people into the Spirit Creek Battlefield and negotiate with him. His actions seem to indicate that he’s not just a reckless person. He should also be aware of the consequences if he acts too recklessly.”</p><p>After Elder Chen laid out his plan, the other Divine Ocean Realm experts nodded in agreement.</p><p>Since Yi Ye had given them a ten-day deadline like last time, it would be better to talk to him first regardless of the outcome.</p><p>It didn’t seem like an optimistic move, but what if negotiations came out successful?</p><p>Even if they couldn’t reach an agreement, they still had ten days to prepare.</p><p>They couldn’t just give him whatever he wanted, otherwise, what would happen to the pride of the Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators when they went out in the future? Were they shameless?</p><p>While the Divine Ocean Realm experts were talking, in the Clouded Sun Clan’s Outpost, Lu Ye had immersed his mind into his consciousness and was examining the Tree of Glyphs.</p><p>A large cloud of gray smoke rose from the tree, indicating that its fuel was still abundant.</p><p>Mainly, it was because he hadn’t killed too many people this time.</p><p>It wasn’t that he didn’t want to, he just didn’t get to.</p><p>As soon as the cultivators of the Clouded Sun Clan realized that Lu Ye had entered their Outpost, they quickly began evacuating and all left in just a short period of time.</p><p>This also made things easier for Lu Ye.</p><p>The only thing that made him feel helpless were his Contribution Points…</p><p>He had already spent all his Contribution Points earlier on Flames of Earthen Spirits to fuel the Tree of Glyphs.</p><p>As a result, the Contribution Points section on his battlefield imprint showed that he owed a total of 435 Contribution Points.</p><p>It was a first for Lu Ye to find out that Contribution Points could actually be owed!</p><p>It was eye-opening.</p><p>It seems the Heavens would never make a losing deal, Lu Ye could only sigh.</p><p>Fortunately, he still gained some spoils of war. After sorting through them, he tossed them all into the Vault of Providence, only then did he pay off all the Contribution Points owed and even earn a little bit extra outside of that.</p><p>Lu Ye didn’t know what kind of consequences one might face for owing Contribution Points to the Heavens as no one had tried such a thing before. After all, who would owe Contribution Points in the first place?</p><p>However, he had been plagued with a feeling of unease from the moment he began owing those Contribution Points, as if something bad might happen to him at any moment.</p><p>Owing Contribution Points seemed like it could potentially affect his own luck and make things go awry.</p><p>Even someone with such remarkable luck as he felt that way upon owing Contribution Points. So it was not difficult to imagine that consequences would befall an ordinary person if they faced the same situation. They might stumble while walking and even choke while drinking water.</p><p>As the Tree of Glyphs continued to burn, the purple thunder lingering around Lu Ye’s body gradually dissipated.</p><p>Tao Zhengyu emerged from the Sanctum of Providence with an excited expression. “Fifth Senior Brother, where are we going next?”</p><p>Following his Fifth Senior Brother around had given him a taste of greatness, and there weren’t any risks to it at all. They could even plunder the Blessings of others’ Outposts, including the Outposts of Core Circle sects. After plundering two of them, he had reaped abundant gains. Though the plundered Blessings had to be converted into Contribution Points at their own Outpost, as the current Legate-In-Charge of the Crimson Blood Sect’s Outpost, he could even do himself a little favor and distribute a monthly salary to himself.</p><p>Without even mentioning anything else, there was no longer any need for him to worry about not having enough Contribution Points to buy Heaven Grade cultivation disciplines in the future.</p><p>This could also be considered his business trip expenses for following his Fifth Senior Brother. He believed his Second Senior Sister should allow it.</p><p>Looking back, none of the previous Legates of the Crimson Blood Sect had ever had the opportunity to plunder Blessings from multiple enemy Outposts like him and his Fifth Senior Brother.</p><p>He was extremely proud to be initiated into the Crimson Blood Sect. In the past, he was just an independent cultivator, living a lonely and destitute life, unable to secure enough resources for his cultivation. However, after joining the Crimson Blood Sect, life became better day by day. Now, the monthly salary he received from the sect was comparable to the treatment of disciples from the First-Tier Sects. For this reason alone, he was the envy of ninety percent of the Spirit Creek Realm cultivators in Jiu Zhou.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
