After all, this place was deep within Grand Wilds Peak, and even if cultivators passed by, they wouldn’t necessarily notice anything due to the Wards set up by Lu Ye that shrouded this place.</p><p>After activating the Grand Ward’s Control Gem, they entered the Arcane Glade, where they were greeted by a beautiful scenery. On the soft green grass, many wolf cubs were frolicking and playing around. The adult Wolf Mutants who stayed behind to guard the Arcane Glade weren’t many, only about a dozen or so. When they sensed the commotion and confirmed that it was Lu Ye and the others returning, they paid no further attention to them.</p><p>It took another five or six hours before the wolf pack returned in its entirety.</p><p>Wolf Mutants couldn’t fly, so they were much slower than Lu Ye and the others.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ye stood before the Divine Opportunity Column and connected his consciousness to the Vault of Providence, purchasing a large quantity of materials.</p><p>The location of the Arcane Glade had already been exposed, and Tan Sheng and Xia Liang were unlikely to just give up so easily. It could be foreseen that it wouldn’t be long before cultivators from Thousand Demon Ridge would come to attack. Since they had decided to temporarily stay within the Arcane Glade, it was necessary to set up some Wards, especially Teleportation Wars. Although the Arcane Glade had the Divine Opportunity Column that Lu Ye brought, allowing them to return to Jiu Zhou at any time, it still wouldn’t hurt to set up a few Teleportation Wars.</p><p>After acquiring the materials, Lu Ye began refining Ward Flags.</p><p>He had recently crafted a large number of Ward Flags in Fox Immortal Valley, but they had all been consumed, which resulted in his successful assistance in the Fox Mutant’s slaying of the Berserk Giant Ape.</p><p>After a few days, he started refining Ward Flags again, and the feeling was completely different. It was easier to refine them now.</p><p>This was not only the result of his cultivation level increasing but also his Mental Power becoming stronger. With a strong mind, he could control Spiritual Power more intricately.</p><p>In the past, it took him several days to refine two Ward Flags, but now he could make three, which was a great improvement in efficiency.</p><p>Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan were responsible for searching for suitable locations to set up Teleportation Wards in the surroundings. As for Ju Jia, he couldn’t help much, so as long as he didn’t cause trouble, it was already good enough. Since their return, he had been in cultivation.</p><p>While the group was busy here, in another valley less than 1,500 kilometers away from Ameliorate Valley, in a Grand Ward enveloped area, cultivators were frequently coming in and out.</p><p>This place was the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade, which was also marked on the 10-point map sold by the Divine Trade Association.</p><p>The Sacred Universe Arcane Glade had existed in the Cloud River Battlefield for over twenty years and was considered one of the more famous Arcane Glades in the vicinity.</p><p>Compared to Lu Ye’s Arcane Glade, the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade was undoubtedly a large one. With over twenty years of development, the scale of the Arcane Glade had continuously expanded. Currently, there were over a hundred cultivators in the entire Arcane Glade. Looking across the entire Cloud River Battlefield, there weren’t many places that were larger in scale than the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade.</p><p>What was particularly rare was that a few years ago, the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade had been promoted from a Secundus-level Arcane Glade to a Primus-level Arcane Glade.</p><p>The level of an Arcane Glade could be upgraded, and the scale could be expanded by integrating more Wisps of Sanctification into it. In the case of Lu Ye’s Arcane Glade, it was already a Primus-level Arcane Glade, the highest level, but if Lu Ye could obtain other qualities of Wisps of Sanctification and placed them in the Spirit Spout, the level of the Arcane Glade wouldn’t be improved, but the scale would expand. The higher the quality of the integrated Wisps of Sanctification, the greater the expansion of the scale, allowing more cultivators to reside in it and cultivate.</p><p>In general, the development of large-scale Arcane Glades in the Cloud River Battlefield followed the same step-by-step process.</p><p>Many Sects had their exclusive Arcane Glades that were passed down from generation to generation.</p><p>This had significant long-term implications for the development of Sects because once their disciples advanced to the Cloud River Realm, they could enter the Arcane Glade to cultivate in peace.</p><p>However, for many cultivators, cultivating in the Arcane Glade was not without its drawbacks. It provided stability but lacked the strive and the spirit.</p><p>So, even for sects with inherited Arcane Glades, the cultivators wouldn’t stay in the Arcane Glade all the time. They would frequently go out to hone themselves.</p><p>The Sacred Universe Arcane Glade was not the exclusive Arcane Glade of a single Sect but rather belonged to two.</p><p>One was Cult Blackfyre, and the other was the Universe Sect.</p><p>Both were Sects from Thousand Demon Ridge and happened to be in the same region of You Zhou. They had a good relationship, so when their acolytes arrived in the Cloud River Battlefield, they naturally helped each other.</p><p>Currently, the cultivators of the Sacred Universe Arcane Glade were led by two Ninth Order Cloud River Realm experts. One was Huo Liaoyuan from Cult Blackfyre, and the other was Tu Guanxiong from the Universe Clan.</p><p>Having only two Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivators lead over a hundred people in an Arcane Glade may make it seem small, but it was not to say that they were the only ones in the Ninth Order. Even if Cult Blackfyre and the Universe Clan were not First Tier Sects, they were still Fourth or Fifth Tier Sects. It was not possible for them to have only two Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivators.</p><p>However, Cloud River Realm cultivators didn’t stay in the Cloud River Battlefield all the time. Especially after reaching a high cultivation level, they spent most of their time in Jiu Zhou. Improving their cultivation was secondary. Achieving personal growth through experiences was more important.</p><p>Even if they had to stay in the Arcane Glade to take care of their Junior Brothers and Sisters, they still couldn’t possibly stay there all year round.</p><p>The ones who stayed still only did so on a rotational basis. They would be replaced by other Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivators after three months once their time was up.</p><p>Inside a secluded room, Huo Liaoyuan was in the midst of cultivation. When he sensed some movement from his Battlefield Imprint, he didn’t check on it immediately but remained quietly seated.</p><p>After an incense stick of time, he slowly opened his eyes and exhaled a breath of impure Qi.</p><p>He touched the Battlefield Imprint to check, and as soon as he did, his expression changed slightly. This message was sent by one of his Junior Brothers who was traveling around to train in the Cloud River Battlefield, but it was the information in the message that caught his interest.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, he sent out a message and hurriedly got up.</p><p>Leaving the room, he went straight to another building. Before he could knock on the door, it opened by itself and a figure appeared before him. It was Tu Guanxiong, the other Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivator in the Arcane Glade.</p><p>Tu Guanxiong welcomed Huo Liaoyuan inside and asked, “Senior Brother Huo, is the information reliable?”</p><p>“It was a message sent by Nan Cheng from the outside. Whether it’s accurate or not, I can’t confirm,” Huo Liaoyuan replied.</p><p>Tu Guanxiong thought for a moment and recalled who this ‘Nan Cheng’ was. Both sects had more Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivators than just the two of them, and there were also more Cloud River Realm cultivators from both sects than the mere hundred in the Arcane Glade.</p><p>However, the Arcane Glade could only accommodate a hundred cultivators for cultivation. Therefore, more acolytes were scattered throughout the Cloud River Battlefield in search of their own opportunities.</p><p>“Where did he get the information?” Tu Guanxiong asked.</p><p>Huo Liaoyuan explained, “Someone passed on the message to him, and the person who received the information heard it from somewhere else. The source cannot be determined.”</p><p>“What does Senior Brother Huo think about the credibility of this information?”</p><p>“Until we see it with our own eyes, it’s hard to believe any piece of information. However, when it comes to Lu Ye, it’s worth investigating. What concerns me is that the information that came seemed too detailed,”</p><p>The information he received not only included Lu Ye’s current location but also the various forces within his Arcane Glade, including the cultivation levels of Li Baxian and others, as well as the relatively large wolf pack.</p><p>“Is Senior Brother Huo suspecting that…” Tu Guanxiong was thoughtful.</p><p>“If I’m not mistaken, someone suffered a big loss at Lu Ye’s hands and had no hope of revenge, so they want to use someone else as a pawn to kill him!” Huo Liaoyuan paused. “To have nearly three hundred Wolf Mutants… Yi Ye is no Beastmaster, so how does he manage to control them?”</p><p>Even if he were a Beastmaster, it was impossible to control so many Wolf Mutants.</p><p>“If that’s the case, we might not be able to handle it,” Tu Guanxiong said worriedly. However, he knew about the grudge between Cult Blackfyre and the Crimson Blood Sect, and that Yi Ye carried a huge bounty on his head. If he knew such details, then surely Huo Liaoyuan must be tempted as well. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have come to discuss this matter with him.</p><p>Not to mention Huo Liaoyuan, even he himself was tempted. After the incident at the Carnage Colosseum, Yi Ye extorted a significant amount of resources from the major Sects in the Spirit Creek Battlefield’s Thousand Demon Ridge, and the bounty on him from the Thousand Demon Ridge had increased again by a considerable amount.</p><p>During these days, countless people in the entire Cloud River Battlefield were searching for Yi Ye’s whereabouts, but unfortunately, they came up empty. No one knew where he was. Now that they had an exact location, who wouldn’t be tempted? If this information were to be spread, it would only take a few days for that place to be crowded with people.</p><p>However, the person who leaked the information chose not to spread it but instead delivered it straight to Cult Blackfyre, so it was clear that they weren’t completely giving up yet.</p><p>“They do have a considerable number of Wolf Mutants, but with careful planning, we may still have a chance to get Yi Ye.”</p><p>Previously, Lu Ye’s cultivation was only in the Third Order Cloud River Realm. Even if he received the reward from the Roster of Carnage, his cultivation wouldn’t have changed much. When dealing with such an enemy, they could strike a fatal blow on him as long as they were given an opportunity, so why even bother getting entangled with the wolf pack?</p><p>“In any case, have someone go and investigate first. We need to confirm if the information is reliable. As for those who are just planning to sit by and wait for the fish to swim into their nets…” A cold glint flashed in Huo Liaoyuan’s. “We’ll have to see whether they have the ability to snatch the opportunity or not!”</p><p>For them to act so covertly indicated that they were acting alone and lacked power, but they had the power of an entire Arcane Glade behind them, so what was there to fear?</p><p>“I understand,” Tu Guanxiong agreed and immediately sent out a message.</p><p>When it came to investigating such matters, a Ghost Cultivator was naturally required to take action. However, almost all of the acolytes in Cult Blackfyre were Spell Cultivators, and it was impossible to find a single Ghost Cultivator among them. They could only rely on the Universe Clan to send someone.</p><p>In just a moment, a small and lean man stepped in. “Senior Brother Tu, Senior Brother Huo.”</p><p>Tu Guanxiong said, “Yan Gui, I want you to go and investigate a place.”</p><p>The Ghost Cultivator Yan Gui responded, “Please instruct me, Senior Brother.”</p><p>“Go to Ameliorate Valley!”</p><p>Yan Gui took out a 10-point map, quickly examined it, and located the position of Ameliorate Valley. He raised a brow. “This place is already deep into Grand Wilds Peak. Senior Brothers, what is over there?”</p><p>“You’ll know once you’re there.” Tu Guanxiong didn’t explicitly say, fearing it would give their Junior Brother a biased impression. “Remember, investigate carefully, be cautious. It… might be dangerous there.”</p><p>Yan Gui didn’t mind, “Don’t worry, Senior Brother. I will be cautious.”</p><p>Even though his cultivation level was not particularly high, he was still in the Seventh Order Cloud River Realm. Moreover, as a Ghost Cultivator, he excelled in the art of sneaking, and gathering intelligence was a simple task for him.</p><p>“If you discover anything, report back immediately.”</p><p>“Yes!” Yan Gui accepted the order and left the room. Using his telekinetic techniques, he soared into the sky.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
