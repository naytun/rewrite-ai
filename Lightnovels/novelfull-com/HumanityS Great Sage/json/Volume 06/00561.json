Then, it slightly lowered its head as if agreeing.</p><p>Lu Ye felt amazed that he had actually made a deal with a group of Mutant Beasts. Even though the details of the transaction and the specific price was vague and unclear, the fact that the pack leader agreed meant he could now collect some Mutant Cores in return from them.</p><p>It also saved him the trouble of finding targets to practice on, so it was a good thing.</p><p>He immediately sat cross-legged on the steps of his wooden cabin and took out the materials he had bought from the Vault of Providence, arranging them in a row in front of himself.</p><p>UpdatùíÜd frùëúm freewebn√∏vel.com.</p><p>Just as he had done before, he displayed the different effects of the three Glyphs in front of the pack leader.</p><p>‚ÄúRemember, if there‚Äôs a Glyph you need, just choose it and I will Tattoo the Glyph for you,‚Äù Lu Ye instructed the Wolf Mutant.</p><p>The pack leader turned around, tilting its head.</p><p>Among the wolf pack, a giant wolf immediately stepped forward and stood in front of Lu Ye.</p><p>The pack leader raised its paw and tapped on the golden bottle symbolizing Glyph: Sharp Edge.</p><p>‚ÄúUnderstood!‚Äù</p><p>Lu Ye reached out and grabbed the maw of the Wolf Mutant in front of him, then took out a needle and began the process.</p><p>In just a short while, a Sharp Edge Tattoo took shape, leaving a golden arrowhead mark on the mouth of the Wolf Mutant.</p><p>The Wolf Mutant activated its Spirit Essence and bared its fangs. The sharp fangs were immediately covered in a faint glow, turning even sharper.</p><p>Though Lu Ye had already witnessed Sharp Edge‚Äôs power as displayed by his companions in previous fights, seeing how this power was born first hand felt completely different.</p><p>Lu Ye clearly saw a hint of surprise in the eyes of the pack leader. Even the quiet wolf pack became restless, their gazes toward Lu Ye becoming heated.</p><p>This had never happened before. There were over a hundred Wolf Mutants in this wolf pack, and they usually paid little attention to anyone that was not Ju Jia. They basically acted as if they didn‚Äôt exist in the Arcane Glade. But now, upon realizing that Lu Ye possessed the power to make them stronger, their perception of him undoubtedly underwent some subtle changes.</p><p>Moreover, this increase in strength came effortlessly without any cost.</p><p>This made the wolf pack value Lu Ye even more.</p><p>Another Wolf Mutant approached under the pack leader‚Äôs signal, who once again tapped the golden bottle symbolizing Glyph: Sharp Edge.</p><p>After a short rest, Lu Ye began the next Tattoo.</p><p>The actual time he spent on Tattooing was not long, a few dozen breaths at most, but the mental drain he sustained during that short time was immense.</p><p>With each Tattoo made, Lu Ye‚Äôs technique also became more proficient.</p><p>While he was busy, outside the Grand Wilds Peak, three streams of light traveled together, moving swiftly through the air.</p><p>From the fluctuations of their Spiritual Power alone, it was clear that the three of them were in the Ninth Order Cloud River Realm.</p><p>And, all three of them were Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivators whom Lu Ye had handled before.</p><p>The black-clad figure in the middle was Tan Sheng of the New Moon Sect. On his left was Wei Que from the Clouded Sun Clan, and on his right was Xia Liang of the Raving Bladesmen.</p><p>Compared to his previous state in the Carnage Colosseum, Tan Sheng‚Äôs aura at the moment was undoubtedly somewhat violent. His eyes were bloodshot, and he had become thinner all around.</p><p>The New Moon Sect‚Äôs Outpost in the Spirit Creek Battlefield had been conquered and over fifty of their disciples were either killed or injured. The losses were devastating. When Tan Sheng received this news in the Cloud River Battlefield, he almost fainted out of anger. It was also at that time that he made a vow to himself to kill Yi Ye and avenge his fallen junior disciples.</p><p>He was on the verge of advancing into the Real Lake Realm, and he had also gained some benefits in the Carnage Colosseum that could allow him to advance and leave the Cloud River Battlefield at any time if he wanted to.</p><p>But in order to kill Lu Ye, he forcibly delayed his advancement.</p><p>What qualifications did he have to advance into the Real Lake Realm if he hadn‚Äôt even settled this deep hatred and enmity?</p><p>He admitted that he was the one who orchestrated what happened in the Carnage Colosseum, but it was no reason for Yi Ye to target the Sect behind him. A matter in the Cloud River Realm was brought to the Spirit Creek Battlefield, and after suffering such substantial losses, the New Moon Sect was powerless to counterattack. Yi Ye was nothing short of a beast!</p><p>So no matter what, he had to kill Yi Ye on the Cloud River Battlefield. Only then could he ascend into the Real Lake Realm with peace of mind.</p><p>Wei Que had the same reasons as Tan Sheng, but compared to the New Moon Sect, his Clouded Sun Clan suffered fewer casualties. Only their Outpost was broken into and they suffered a significant loss of Contribution Points.</p><p>Wei Que didn‚Äôt have the same intense hatred that Tan Sheng had. He was more concerned about the substantial reward he would receive for killing Lu Ye.</p><p>After Lu Ye‚Äôs second robbery of the Thousand Demon Ridge‚Äôs major Sects and Clans in the Spirit Creek Battlefield, his bounty had increased significantly.</p><p>As for Xia Liang‚Ä¶</p><p>He did not come for Lu Ye, but to find Li Baxian instead!</p><p>For Xia Liang, Yan Xing was like both a brother and a father figure to him, and such a person was killed by Li Baxian.</p><p>Since learning that Li Baxian had entered the Cloud River Battlefield, he had been searching for his whereabouts. Unfortunately, the Cloud River Battlefield was too vast, and finding one person in such a place was like finding a needle in a haystack.</p><p>However, Lu Ye and Li Baxian had a close relationship. If they could capture Lu Ye, Li Baxian would definitely not stand idly by.</p><p>This was part of the reason why he attacked Lu Ye in the Carnage Colosseum back then.</p><p>The convergence of these three individuals in such a vast battlefield was naturally no coincidence but a hunt on Lu Ye led by Tan Sheng. Wei Que and Xia Liang were both invited here by him.</p><p>They didn‚Äôt invite more people since the three of them, who were in the Ninth Order, was more than enough to deal with Yi Ye. So what if they got more people like last time? He still managed to escape from them.</p><p>Moreover, the main reason he was able to escape last time was thanks to the Golden Body Token. With that thing protecting him, no one could break through his defenses, but there was no way that Yi Ye could possess another one of them. So, as long as they could find his whereabouts, they could definitely kill him!</p><p>During their flight, Wei Que said, ‚ÄúBrother Tan, can we be sure that Yi Ye entered the Grand Wilds Peak?‚Äù</p><p>Tan Sheng remained silent and took out a compass-like object from his clothes. He lowered his head to examine it and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure.‚Äù</p><p>The compass looked similar to a Tracking Disc, but its actual effectiveness was far inferior. A Tracking Disc could clearly indicate the location of the target and provide a very specific direction. The closer the distance, the stronger the response on the Tracking Disc. However, the compass Spirit Artifact in Tan Sheng‚Äôs hand couldn‚Äôt do that.</p><p>It could only point one in a general direction.</p><p>Strictly speaking, this thing was like a severely limited version of a Tracking Disc.</p><p>Even so, this object was extremely valuable and was hard to find throughout the entirety of Jiu Zhou.</p><p>It was acquired at a great cost by the New Moon Sect, who purchased it from the Divine Trade Association before having it delivered to Tan Sheng in the Cloud River Battlefield by one of the disciples.</p><p>It was obtained solely for the purpose of tracking Lu Ye‚Äôs whereabouts so that they could get revenge for the destruction of their Sect‚Äôs Outpost as well as the killing of their disciples.</p><p>So, even though it was a severely limited version of a Tracking Disc, it was no problem for it to point out a general direction for them. Following the guidance of this compass, the three of them hurried towards the Grand Wilds Peak.</p><p>‚ÄúIf Yi Ye is only in the Third Order, then even if he received the reward from the Roster of Carnage, and even if he has reached the Fourth Order now‚Ä¶ it wouldn‚Äôt be wise for him to enter the Grand Wilds Peak. Why would he go there?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúExperience, cultivation‚Ä¶ There has to be reasons,‚Äù Tan Sheng casually replied. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt forget, the reward for ranking first on the Roster of Carnage includes a Primus-level Wisp of Sanctification!‚Äù</p><p>Wei Que‚Äôs eyes lit up at that. ‚ÄúBrother Tan means‚Ä¶‚Äù</p><p>Tan Sheng scoffed. ‚ÄúThe value of a Primus-level Arcane Glade is extraordinary. Even if Yi Ye obtains a Primus-level Wisp of Sanctification, he wouldn‚Äôt dare to settle down arbitrarily. He has to find an inconspicuous area to settle the Wisp of sanctification, and Grand Wilds Peak is undoubtedly a good choice. Although it is very dangerous there, as long as he is lucky, he may find a suitable place to reduce the risk of the Arcane Glade being discovered by others.‚Äù</p><p>Wei Que‚Äôs eyes brightened. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a good point.‚Äù</p><p>If Yi Ye‚Äôs goal in entering the Grand Wilds Peak was to settle a Wisp of Sanctification, then it made sense. In that case, if they succeeded this time, not only could they obtain a large bounty but also a Primus-level Wisp of Sanctification.</p><p>However, compared to the reward they would get from Thousand Demon Ridge, the temptation of a Primus-level Wisp of Sanctification seemed pale in comparison. Nevertheless, it would still be an extra gain.</p><p>‚ÄúAlso, Brother Xia. If things are as I suspect, then Li Baxian might be with Lu Ye,‚Äù Tan Sheng made another astonishing statement.</p><p>Xia Liang‚Äôs eyes, who had been silent all this while, suddenly turned sharper. ‚ÄúHow so?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúCurrently, the Crimson Blood Sect only has a few cultivators in the Cloud River Realm, so it‚Äôs impossible for Yi Ye to monopolize a Primus-level Arcane Glade by himself. You should also be aware of Li Baxian‚Äôs situation within the Devoted ones. They have their own Arcane Glade, but it is unlikely that Li Baxian would get the opportunity to enter and cultivate there. If Yi Ye has a Primus-level Arcane Glade, do you think he wouldn‚Äôt invite Li Baxian to settle there with him?‚Äù</p><p>Xia Liang‚Äôs eyes became even brighter. ‚ÄúIf that‚Äôs truly the case, this will be interesting!‚Äù</p><p>The sound of a blade suddenly rang out, and as the bright Saber Light flashed by, Xia Liang had already rushed forward like an arrow released from a bow. A huge flying beast approached from the front, and when the two figures passed by each other, a rain of blood filled the sky.</p><p>Xia Liang had effortlessly cut down a powerful flying beast equivalent to the Seventh Order Cloud River Realm with a single slash.</p><p>Wei Que looked at him with envy.</p><p>Even if they were both Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivators, Wei Que couldn‚Äôt compare to Xia Liang at all. Even Tan Sheng surpassed him. The reason behind this was that Wei Que‚Äôs foundation in the Spirit Creek Realm wasn‚Äôt solid enough. Though all three of them had advanced into the Cloud River Realm with 360 Spirit Points, only Tan Sheng and Xia Liang had their names on the Roll of Supremacy while Wei Que had never left his mark on it.</p><p>Xia Liang was filled with fighting spirit, Tan Sheng sought revenge, and Wei Que had his eyes on the bounty. On this day, the three Ninth Order cultivators followed the trail and ventured deep into the Grand Wilds Peak.</p><p>Inside the Arcane Glade, Lu Ye had Tattooed nearly thirty Wolf Mutants before waving his hand at the pack leader in front of him. ‚ÄúCome back tomorrow.‚Äù</p><p>He had depleted his mental energy and would need some rest in order to recover.</p><p>Not all the Tattoos he did were Glyph: Sharp Edge. Some of them were Glyph: Protection and Glyph: Windwalk.</p><p>The choice of the Glyphs was up to the pack leader. Lu Ye had summarized a rule that those above the Fifth Order, not including those in the Fifth Order itself, would receive Glyph: Sharp Edge. Below that, they either got Glyph: Protection or Glyph: Windwalk.</p><p>Glyph: Protection was Tattooed on their abdomen, while Glyph: Windwalk was on their legs.</p><p>The pack leader undoubtedly made these choices for the weaker members of the pack so that they could gain enough of a self-defense capability.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
