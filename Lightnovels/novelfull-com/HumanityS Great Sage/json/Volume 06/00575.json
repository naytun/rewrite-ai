He was not tall with a slim and small stature, and he had a cultivation level in the Seventh Order Cloud River Realm.</p><p>To have that level of cultivation at that age was undoubtedly a sign of one thing, that Xie Yunhan had mediocre aptitude for cultivation, or one could even say it was very poor.</p><p>There was a special existence on the Spirit Creek Battlefield known to all as the veteran Ninth Order. Due to their limited aptitude, it became difficult for them to make further progress in their cultivation once they opened up 180 Spiritual Points. The minimum standard for cultivators to advance into the Cloud River Realm was to open 240 Spiritual Points and cultivate Heavenly-grade techniques. Therefore, these veteran Ninth Orders were unable to break through into the Cloud River Realm and could only reach a standstill in the Ninth Order.</p><p>Lu Ye had even encountered some elderly cultivators with white hair who couldn’t open more Spiritual Points due to their lacking talent.</p><p>It was rare to see old cultivators on the Cloud River Battlefield as the cultivators there could make use of things such as Amulets, which could rapidly increase their cultivation level. As long as a cultivator’s luck wasn’t too bad and they weren’t too lazy, their cultivation level would gradually improve.</p><p>However, just because they were rare didn’t mean they didn’t exist. Different individuals had different levels of talents, and their cultivation progress varied.</p><p>In general, though it was rare to see cultivators stagnating in the Cloud River Battlefield like the veteran Ninth Orders in the Spirit Creek Battlefield, there were still some middle-aged faces, albeit in small numbers.</p><p>Xie Yunhan was undoubtedly one of them. Among the entire Fox Immortal Valley, he was the oldest in age but not the highest in cultivation level.</p><p>Led by Zhou Yuntian, Lu Ye met Xie Yunhan, and they got to know each other. Upon learning that Lu Ye cultivated the Way of Wards and would be assisting him, Xie Yunhan was undoubtedly overjoyed. Despite having so many people in the valley, he was the only one skilled with Wards. He was responsible for setting up and maintaining all of the Wards, which kept him busy each day and drained him mentally. If not for that, his cultivation level would not have remained in the Seventh Order Cloud River Realm, which was mainly due to him having little time for cultivation in his daily life.</p><p>“I’ll leave Cultivator Lu in your hands now, Cultivator Xie. He just arrived here and has a lot to learn, so I hope you can guide him,” Zhou Yuntian said.</p><p>Xie Yunhan agreed, “Rest assured, Cultivator Zhou. I’ll take care of him.”</p><p>After Zhou Yuntian left, Xie Yunhan examined Lu Ye from head to toe, his eyes filled with undisguised delight, clearly welcoming of Lu Ye’s arrival. “Cultivator Lu, I would like to test your proficiency in the Way of Wards. I hope you don’t mind.”</p><p>Lu Ye nodded. “Naturally.”</p><p>Xie Yunhan waved his hand. “Follow me.” With that, he led the way forward.</p><p>After a short while, they arrived at a corner of Fox Immortal Valley. Xie Yunhan pointed ahead and said, “There’s a Trap Ward here, but it has been set up for quite some time. I plan to move it to a different location. Cultivator Lu, I’ll trouble you to dismantle this Ward.”</p><p>“Very well!” Lu Ye nodded and stepped forward. With Glyph: Insight enhancing his vision, he looked into the Ward ahead.</p><p>He could not be any more familiar with breaking Wards. To him, it was even simpler than setting them up.</p><p>After a few moments, he had a plan.</p><p>The technique used in this Trap Ward was not that fine, and the overall strength of the Ward was not high. Even if he mistakenly got trapped in it, he could easily break free in just a cup of tea’s time through brute force.</p><p>Based on Lu Ye’s current proficiency in the Way of Wards, it would take no effort at all for him to dismantle this Ward.</p><p>He pondered for a moment, considering whether he should reveal his true abilities or conceal them.</p><p>If he were to reveal the true extent of his abilities, it might draw Xie Yunhan’s ire and envy. After all, he was the only Ward Cultivator in the valley before his arrival and was greatly valued by the Fox Mutant. Once he showed a greater level of proficiency to him in the Way of Wards, then it may change the way that Xie Yunhan saw him in the future.</p><p>However, by doing so, Lu Ye could seize the opportunity to gain the Fox Mutant’s favor and be entrusted with important tasks, which should facilitate his future endeavors.</p><p>When he met the Fox Mutant yesterday, she showed clear interest in Li Baxian due to his reputation and immense potential, while Xia Liang came second due to his formidable strength.</p><p>As a Fourth Order Cloud River Realm cultivator, if it weren’t for his possession of some special abilities, the Fox Mutant may not have even given him a second glance.</p><p>In order to slay the Fox Mutant, he had to earn her trust and attention first. Compared to that, the possible resentment and envy he may receive from Xie Yunhan wouldn’t mean anything.</p><p>With his decision made, Lu Ye immediately took action.</p><p>In a short twenty breaths, the Trap Ward was perfectly broken, and the Ward Flags were retrieved.</p><p>Xie Yunhan looked astonished and exclaimed, “Cultivator Lu, your proficiency in the Way of Wards… seems to be quite high?”</p><p>Even though this Ward was set up by him, objectively speaking, even if he were to dismantle it himself, he wouldn’t have been able to do it as quickly as Lu Ye did.</p><p>From merely a glimpse, Xie Yunhan could get a vague sense that Lu Ye’s attainment in the Way of Wards was remarkable. However, it was hard to see much from the dismantling of one Ward, so Xie Yunhan led him around the various places in Fox Immortal Valley to continue his assessment.</p><p>Some Wards needed to be removed, some needed reinforcement and maintenance, while some areas needed the placement of new ones.</p><p>Under Xie Yunhan’s instructions, Lu Ye swiftly and meticulously completed each task.</p><p>The work that was planned to have lasted the entire day was already finished by noon.</p><p>The surprise in Xie Yunhan’s eyes grew even deeper. Initially, he only thought that his future tasks would become easier now that Lu Ye had been sent to help him, but now, he realized that Lu Ye far surpassed him in the Way of Wards.</p><p>Not only was it easier, it was simply like picking up a treasure.</p><p>Instead of showing envy or resentment as Lu Ye expected, Xie Yunhan happily pulled Lu Ye’s arm, saying, “Since we managed to gain some leisure time, let’s have a drink together, Cultivator Lu.”</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ye wouldn’t refuse. It was also an opportunity to improve his relationship with Xie Yunhan while learning more about Fox Immortal Valley from him.</p><p>As they arrived at Xie Yunhan’s pavilion, Xie Yunhan personally cooked up some dishes and retrieved a jar of wine that was stashed away in the empty space behind the pavilion.</p><p>On the second floor of the pavilion, Xie Yunhan and Lu Ye sat face-to-face, enjoying a conversation over drinks.</p><p>Due to his Second Senior Sister’s influence, Lu Ye rarely drank. However, at his cultivation level, he wouldn’t be affected as long as he didn’t drink too much.</p><p>He didn’t rush to inquire about the situation in Fox Immortal Valley, but made casual conversation with Xie Yunhan instead.</p><p>After three rounds of drinks, the atmosphere became more harmonious, and “Cultivator Lu” from Xie Yunhan’s mouth turned into “Brother Lu”. Despite it being their first meeting, Xie Yunhan did not put up a guard against Lu Ye since he had the Secret Technique implanted in him by the Fox Mutant.</p><p>Basically, just as Zhou Yuntian said before, once someone entered Fox Immortal Valley, they would become part of the family.</p><p>A jar of fine wine was quickly finished, so Xie Yunhan stood up. “Wait a moment, Brother Lu. Let me go and fetch another jar.”</p><p>But Lu Ye quickly stopped him. “I have some here, Brother Xie. No need to bother.”</p><p>Saying that, he took out several jars of different wines from his Storage Sphere.</p><p>He wasn’t a drinker, but he had killed many Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators, many of whom were connoisseurs of good wine, so wine from various regions of the continent naturally came to occupy his Storage Bag as spoils of war.</p><p>Most of it was given to Li Baxian while he kept only a small portion for himself since he had no use for it.</p><p>Opening the seal, he poured a bowl for Xie Yunhan and half a bowl for himself.</p><p>Xie Yunhan picked it up and gave it a light sniff, then his eyes glazed over with intoxication. He threw his head back and drank it all, then closed his eyes and savored it before shaking his head and exclaiming, “Yun Zhou’s Jade Flower Wine is still as sweet and mellow as I remember it.”</p><p>“If Brother Xie likes it, feel free to have more.” Lu Ye topped up his bowl and casually asked, “Brother Xie, are you from Yun Zhou?”</p><p>“That’s right, this Xie hails from Yun Zhou.” Xie Yunhan reminisced with a hint of nostalgia in his eyes, “In the past, this Xie loved this Jade Flower Wine the most. Could it be that Brother Lu is also from Yun Zhou?”</p><p>“I’m from Bing Zhou,” Lu Ye replied.</p><p>Xie Yunhan laughed. “Whether it’s Bing Zhou or Yun Zhou, we’re all family once we’re here.”</p><p>“Yes. I toast to Brother Xie.”</p><p>They threw back another large bowl of wine.</p><p>While pouring the wine, Lu Ye casually said, “Brother Xie, I’m new here and don’t understand many things within the valley. If I make any mistakes in the future, I hope Brother Xie can offer me your guidance.”</p><p>Xie Yunhan picked up a bite of food with his chopsticks and ate while assuring pridefully, “Rest assured, brother! You and I are cultivators of the same kind and our temperaments are also compatible. This Xie will definitely take care of you. I dare not guarantee the rest, but nobody knows the taboos and customs of Fox Immortal Valley better than I do. After all, this Xie has been here for twelve years.”</p><p>[Twelve years…] Lu Ye’s eyes twitched.</p><p>He really wanted to ask what Xie Yunhan had been doing here for twelve years, and why he was only in the Seventh Order Cloud River Realm.</p><p>As if recalling something, Xie Yunhan couldn’t help but sigh. “Twelve years have passed and I’ve seen people come and go within the valley, one generation replacing another. Ai!”</p><p>“Is there anyone in the valley who has been here longer than you, Brother Xie?” Lu Ye asked.</p><p>Xie Yunhan snorted and shook his head. “Of course not. At most, it only takes a year or two until…” He suddenly snapped awake and stopped talking, lowering his voice to whisper, “Regardless, you and I are indispensable talents under the mistress as Ward Cultivators, so our safety is guaranteed. Also, Brother Lu, don’t progress too quickly in your cultivation. Do keep that in mind!”</p><p>“Why is that?” Lu Ye felt as if he had touched upon some secret. From Xie Yunhan’s words, it seemed that advancing too rapidly in cultivation came with some sort of risk or danger.</p><p>However, Xie Yunhan didn’t explain any further. He just said, “Listen to me. Many geniuses have come to the valley and advanced rapidly in their cultivation, but then what? They all turned into nothing more than mounds on the earth. On the other hand, this Xie is still alive.”</p><p>Since he put it that way, there was nothing more that Lu Ye could ask either. Lest he arouse suspicion from the others, he immediately raised his bowl. “Brother Xie, I toast to you again.”</p><p>Xie Yunhan responded, “No need to stand on ceremony, brother. Let’s drink together!”</p><p>They drank wine from noon until the evening. Lu Ye wasn’t able to gather much information from Xie Yunhan, but what he learned confirmed his previous speculations. There surely had to be some dangers hidden in the seemingly peaceful and tranquil Fox Immortal Valley, dangers that would cause those with higher cultivation levels to die faster.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
