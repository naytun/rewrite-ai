It struggled instinctively, but to no avail.</p><p>It had completely exhausted its strength.</p><p>The Fox Mutant reached out and grabbed a sword from a cultivator’s hand before making a graceful landing on the chest of the giant ape. As she leaned forward, a wonderful spring view was revealed at her chest, but no cultivator had the courage to appreciate this rare beauty during this moment.</p><p>“You still recognize me, don’t you?” The Fox Mutant’s eyes were filled with satisfaction, and her words were icy, “I said that you will one day die by my hands, and I’ve been waiting for this day for eighteen years! Eighteen years!”</p><p>A mixed expression of either mirth or sadness appeared on her face.</p><p>Eighteen years of waiting with numerous failures in between. The hatred that filled her heart finally found release at this moment.</p><p>She held the hilt of the sword with both hands and aimed at the chest of the giant ape before raising it high. She gritted her teeth. “Die!”</p><p>The sword ruthlessly came down, and as it pierced flesh, blood splattered in the air, and the sword went straight through to the hilt.</p><p>After suffering this heavy blow, a trace of clarity flashed in the dull eyes of the giant ape. It let out a furious roar and suddenly raised an arm that should have been pinned to the ground, causing frightened gasps among the cultivators as it swept its hand towards the Fox Mutant.</p><p>The Fox Mutant’s expression changed. She never expected that her enemy would still have the strength to counterattack in such a state, let alone have the strength to break free from its restraints.</p><p>She reacted quickly and almost instantly retreated as the giant ape raised its hand. However, she was still caught by the shockwaves of the ape’s attack.</p><p>Her tall and graceful body fluttered like a falling leaf.</p><p>“Mistress!” The cultivators shouted in alarm.</p><p>The Fox Mutant landed pitifully and a mist of blood spewed out from her mouth. Her face had also turned pale, and her aura was in turmoil.</p><p>Just being grazed by the ape’s attack had caused such severe injuries. If she hadn’t reacted quickly, she might have already died.</p><p>“Kill it!” the Fox Mutant howled in anger.</p><p>The cultivators obeyed the command, launching numerous attacks on the giant ape, but it showed no reaction.</p><p>The palm that struck Fox Mutant was its final dying struggle.</p><p>The wounded Zhou Yuntian rushed to the Fox Mutant’s side and asked anxiously, “Mistress, how are your injuries?”</p><p>The Fox Mutant shook her head slowly, and Zhou Yuntian quickly took out Healing Pills from his storage pouch and presented them to the Fox Mutant. Without any hesitation, Fox Mutant took them and swallowed them.</p><p>After a while, a pale-faced Yu Daiwei approached with an earth-coloured Mutant Core in her hands, reporting, “Mistress, the giant ape is dead!”</p><p>The Fox Mutant opened her eyes and looked at the Mutant Core in front of her, nodding slightly, her expression calm but with a slight hint of confusion.</p><p>For eighteen years, she had spent every day wallowing in hatred. Suddenly, now that she had obtained vengeance, along with the satisfaction in her heart was an inexplicable emptiness, as if her life had lost its purpose in an instant.</p><p>She looked up at the many cultivators under her command and almost everyone was injured, all looking disheveled.</p><p>She raised her hand and picked up the elite-level Spirit Beast Mutant Core, saying, “Your performance was commendable in today’s battle, especially Lu Ye and Xie Yunhan. You two shall be credited with the slaying of this beast. When we return to the valley, I will reward you accordingly.”</p><p>Lu Ye and Xie Yunhan quickly bowed and expressed their gratitude.</p><p>“Stay and rest for six hours, then return to the valley!”</p><p>“Yes!” the cultivators answered.</p><p>After the great battle, everyone could finally relax, and they each found a place to rest and recover. As for a patrol, that was unnecessary as this area was considered the territory of the elite-level Spirit Beast, and no other Spirit Beast would usually dare to provoke it.</p><p>However, there were over eighty people when they arrived, and now only less than half of them were still alive. Even among this half, many were severely injured.</p><p>It should be noted that this was with the help of over a hundred Wards set up in advance by Lu Ye and Xie Yunhan, along with the cultivators fighting to the death under the Fox Mutant’s control. Moreover, the cultivation levels of the cultivators from Fox Immortal Valley were also on the higher side in general.</p><p>If the cultivators had truly gathered together to slay the Berserk Giant Ape without help, it would have been impossible to succeed without at least two or three hundred people.</p><p>The horror of an elite-level Spirit Beast was evident.</p><p>Among all the cultivators, only three remained uninjured. Li Baxian, who had been by Fox Mutant’s side, as well as Lu Ye and Xie Yunhan, who oversaw the Wards.</p><p>While the cultivators were meditating and recovering, the Fox Mutant was also healing her injuries.</p><p>Lu Ye said, “Thank you, buddy. You should also rest. I will go and set up some Alarm Wards.”</p><p>Xie Yunhan nodded, “Then I’ll leave it to you, Brother Lu.”</p><p>Lu Ye walked to a nearby location and while setting a Wards, he placed his hand on the Battlefield Imprint to send out a message. It didn’t take long before he received a response, and as he checked it, a light glinted in his eyes.</p><p>He quickly returned and sat down not far from the Fox Mutant, stuffed a few Spirit Pills into his mouth, and silently refined them.</p><p>Time passed.</p><p>At a certain moment, rustling sounds suddenly came from the quiet thicket. The cultivators had excellent hearing, so when they heard the noise while they were recovering, they all opened their eyes. However, before they could figure out what was happening, giant wolves with silvery-white fur suddenly entered their sights.</p><p>The giant wolves surrounded them from all directions, leaving no gaps.</p><p>In the next moment, as if it had been planned between the Wolf Mutants, an average of six or seven giant wolves targeted each cultivator and launched their attacks on them directly.</p><p>“Enemy attack!” An alarmed and angry shout broke the silence, and the cultivators quickly stood up, instantly engaging in battle with the attacking Wolf Mutants.</p><p>Zhou Yuntian shouted, “Protect the Mistress!”</p><p>He ran towards the Fox Mutant as he shouted, but he was barely able to get far before he was entangled by several wolves that came at him.</p><p>In a certain spot among the crowd, Li Baxian looked astonished at the scene. Watching the familiar wolves moving around in the battlefield, a sense of unease suddenly arose within him, but before he could fully grasp what was happening, a figure descended from the sky and landed in front of him.</p><p>Li Baxian’s expression changed. “Yuechan?”</p><p>He never would have expected that Feng Yuechan would appear in front of him like this.</p><p>“Senior Brother!” Feng Yuechan stared intently into Li Baxian’s eyes, but she was unable to discern anything unusual from his expression. However, from the messages she saw from Lu Ye earlier, there was no way she didn’t know that her Senior Brother had already fallen under the control of Fox Mutant even if there were no visible abnormalities.</p><p>“How come…?” Li Baxian’s words were cut off as he suddenly came to his senses and swiftly turned his head to look where the Fox Mutant was.</p><p>What he saw caused his soul to shudder.</p><p>Lu Ye had approached the Fox Mutant at some point, appearing to be protecting her loyally. However, as everyone’s attention was drawn to the sudden appearance of the wolf pack, flames suddenly ignited on the blade in his hand. Before it was aimed at Fox Mutant’s back. Then, with lightning speed, he stabbed the saber into her.</p><p>*Pu chi…* The Inviolable Saber pierced through the Fox Mutant’s back and came out through the front of her chest.</p><p>The Fox Mutant’s eyes widened in an instant, and the other cultivators who were protecting her by her side, felt chills run down their spines.</p><p>No one could have expected that Lu Ye would suddenly lay a lethal strike on the Fox Mutant!</p><p>A faint gleam of light flashed on the Inviolable Saber’s blade, empowered by Glyph: Burster.</p><p>Undeniably, the Fox Mutant herself was very powerful. Judging from the killing blow she landed on the giant ape, her strength was comparable to that of a Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivator. In a direct confrontation, Lu Ye wouldn’t stand a chance against her.</p><p>But she had been injured by the giant ape earlier, and she was now distracted by the sudden appearance of the wolf pack. Moreover, she would never expect that her own subordinate would turn against her and make an attempt on her life, so she was caught completely unprepared.</p><p>The Fox Mutant’s body was pierced through with a single stab. Her already pained expression twisted even further, and the sudden eruption of Glyph: Burster made her scream in agony, while a mist of blood sprayed from her mouth with bits of her organs vaguely visible in the mess.</p><p>“Lu Ye!” an angry roar echoed out as the cultivators standing beside the Fox Mutant finally reacted and attacked Lu Ye one after another.</p><p>However, Lu Ye had anticipated this situation when he made his move. After a successful strike, he withdrew his blade and brought out a splash of hot blood from within the Fox Mutant’s body. In front of him, layer upon layer of Protection Glyphs appeared.</p><p>*Hong hong hong…*</p><p>The powerful impact sent Lu Ye flying, and as he landed, he saw the few cultivators emanating with boundless killing intent rushing towards him.</p><p>Just moments ago, he was hailed as a hero, praised by the Fox Mutant, and envied by all the cultivators of Fox Immortal Valley. But now, he had become an enemy that they had to kill.</p><p>For the cultivators in the valley, the Fox Mutant was their Heaven, and Lu Ye’s sudden betrayal was not something that they could tolerate.</p><p>Staying still in his position, Lu Ye watched as the cultivators wanted to rush at him, but at that moment, the sound of wolf howls came from behind them. Wolf Mutants the size of calves rushed out and engaged the approaching cultivators, instantly transforming the scene into a chaotic battlefield.</p><p>With a distance of over thirty meters between them, the Fox Mutant’s gaze collided with Lu Ye’s. Her beautiful eyes trembled, filled with an expression of disbelief. “How… How could you?”</p><p>Even at this moment, she couldn’t accept that her own subordinates had suddenly stabbed her.</p><p>On the other side, Li Baxian tried to come forward to protect the Fox Mutant when he saw her get hurt, but Feng Yuechan activated her Spiritual Power to summon a humongous Cloud Giant tens of meters tall in front of him to block him.</p><p>She was filled with bitterness, but she didn’t try to persuade Li Baxian. She knew that the only way to break the Divine Soul Secret Technique was for Lu Ye to kill the Fox Mutant. Her sole task now was to keep Li Baxian occupied and prevent him from getting close to Lu Ye.</p><p>*Dong dong dong…*</p><p>As if the sound of war hammers pounding, the ground trembled as a burly figure swiftly approached the Fox Mutant from one direction. When he drew near, he threw a punch that cracked in the air, displaying its terrifying might.</p><p>It was an attack from Ju Jia!</p><p>Given the Fox Mutant’s current condition, being struck by this punch would undoubtedly result in certain death even if her strength was comparable to that of a Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivator.</p><p>While retreating with light steps, her eyes emitted a strange and radiant glow, Ju Jia’s mighty figure reflected in them.</p><p>There was a peculiar surge of energy fluctuations.</p><p>When he felt this strange power, Lu Ye, who was rushing toward Fox Mutant, suddenly felt an inexplicable sense of discomfort as if a seed of anxiety was taking root in his heart.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
