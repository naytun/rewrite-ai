We need to leave time for each sect to prepare so we have to be quick about it.”</p><p>Saying so, not only did she not slow down, she even accelerated a little. Seeing this, Wu Jun had no choice but to follow suit.</p><p>After speeding all the way, Skysword Peak began to peek out in the distance.</p><p>Suddenly, Wu Jun spoke, “Actually, we can try to send a Ghost Cultivator to assassinate him. If we can kill him, all our troubles will be solved.”</p><p>“But what if it fails?”</p><p>If they failed, it would only enrage Yi Ye further, and the consequences would be unpredictable.</p><p>In fact, the Divine Ocean Realm experts did consider dispatching highly skilled Ghost Cultivators, but the risk was too great. Without even mentioning anything else, Yi Ye was proficient in the Way of Wards and even if he was only making a temporary stop at Skysword Peak, he must have set up Alarm Wards in his vicinity, so the Ghost Cultivators may not be able to sneak up to him without being caught.</p><p>Once they were discovered, then with Yi Ye’s domineering strength, things definitely wouldn’t end well for the Ghost Cultivators.</p><p>It was for these concerns that the Thousand Demon Ridge didn’t dare to act rashly and instead sent Wu Jun and Yun Qingyue to negotiate with him.</p><p>Arriving above Skysword Peak, the two swept their eyes around the area and found a figure sitting at the top of the Spirit Peak.</p><p>“Over there,” Yun Qingyue said, then descended her Flight-Type Artifact towards the ground while Wu Jun followed closely behind.</p><p>In a moment, the two landed about a few dozen meters away from Lu Ye.</p><p>When they saw him, they were both inwardly surprised as they saw no traces of purple lightning lingering around Lu Ye’s body.</p><p>Based on the information they had received before, the purple lightning coiling around Lu Ye’s body should have become almost palpable in appearance after breaking into the New Moon Sect’s Outpost and killing over 50 cultivators, but when he appeared in the Clouded Sun Clan’s Outpost less than half a day later, that lightning had already disappeared without a trace, only reappearing again once he took another life.</p><p>But now, it was gone again…</p><p>This undoubtedly indicated that Yi Ye indeed possessed the means to suppress the Judgment of the Heavens, but could such a miraculous method truly exist in this world?</p><p>While they were observing Lu Ye, the latter, who was immersed in his book, also looked up at them, and he was instantly attracted by Yun Qingyue’s appearance.</p><p>To have been known as a heavenly beauty to the men of her generation, she was naturally a great beauty, and beautiful things could always lift a person’s mood.</p><p>When his gaze shifted downwards, his eyes lit up even more.</p><p>This slight movement naturally did not escape Yun Qingyue’s sharp eyes, but she was helpless. This brat was indeed as the rumors suggested…</p><p>Fortunately, he looked at her without any lecherous intentions in his gaze, and he quickly averted his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ye glanced at Wu Jun as well, but he didn’t pay much attention to him.</p><p>What he could ascertain was the fact that neither were in the Spirit Creek Realm, nor the Cloud River Realm. At the very least, they would be Real Lake Realm cultivators, but it was highly unlikely for them to be in the Divine Ocean Realm.</p><p>What did puzzle Lu Ye slightly however, was the woman’s age. From her appearance alone, she didn’t seem older than himself. But for someone with cultivation in at least the Real Lake Realm, how could she be so young? For her to have such an ambiguous appearance, one could only say that the woman preserved her beauty well.</p><p>“Are you Cultivator Yi Ye of the Crimson Blood Sect?” Yun Qingyue was the first to speak.</p><p>This young man before them was the only person in history to have caused such turmoil in the Spirit Creek Battlefield with his own strength and left the Thousand Demon Ridge completely helpless. Despite her cultivation level surpassing Lu Ye by far, Yun Qingyue had no intention of underestimating him.</p><p>Besides, she had a gentle character to begin with.</p><p>They had seen Lu Ye’s portrait before coming here, which matched the person before them, but she still needed to confirm it.</p><p>Not only did she have an enchanting appearance, even her voice was soft and pleasant as a passing spring breeze.</p><p>To address Lu Ye as a fellow cultivator as a Real Lake Realm cultivator was enough to show her full sincerity. Given her cultivation level and status, she could easily address Lu Ye as “little friend” or simply by name.</p><p>“One and the same.”</p><p>Lu Ye put away the book in his hand.</p><p>In his mind, he was speculating the Thousand Demon Ridge’s intentions in sending this woman here.</p><p>He quickly concluded that these two had not come to deliver the peace offerings.</p><p>“What evidence do you have to prove that you’re Yi Ye?” Wu Jun suddenly spoke.</p><p>Before coming here, he had discussed with Yun Qingyue that one of them would play the villain and the other the reasonable negotiator, which was common during negotiations. That was also the reason why the Thousand Demon Ridge sent two people. If both were easy to talk to, then what was the point of negotiating? That was why someone had to be there to play the tough character so as to highlight the sincerity of the other person, which would make it easier to bargain during negotiations.</p><p>Wu Jun had no personal malice towards Lu Ye, and the difference in their cultivation levels was evident, but as a cultivator from the Thousand Demon Ridge faction, Lu Ye’s actions naturally made him somewhat resentful for his allies, and so he would naturally not be courteous with him.</p><p>“What proof do you want?” Lu Ye didn’t believe that these two hadn’t seen his portrait before coming here.</p><p>Wu Jun said, “I heard that Yi Ye has a little white beast by his side that’s always with him, but I don’t seem to be seeing it around.”</p><p>Th𝗲 most uptodate novels are published on ƒгeewёbnovel.com.</p><p>“It’s not here.”</p><p>Yi Yi had to send Tao Zhengyu back to the outpost, so Amber had to accompany them. Both Spirit and Mutant were a linked pair and couldn’t stray too far from each other.</p><p>“A Cloud River Realm cultivator should be subject to the Judgement of the Heavens after invading the Spirit Creek Battlefield and killing others, but I don’t see any traces of it on you. How can you prove that you’re Yi Ye?” Wu Jun was adamant. No matter what, he had to assert his authority and let Yi Ye know that the Thousand Demon Ridge was no easy target.</p><p>Most importantly, Wu Jun wanted to know how Lu Ye managed to suppress the Judgement of the Heavens. It would be worth any price to find that information out.</p><p>*Ceng…* The Inviolable Saber was unsheathed, then bright glints emerged before three crescent-shaped Saber Lights were swept in Wu Jun’s direction.</p><p>Wu Jun never expected that Lu Ye would actually attack him. When he saw the three Saber Lights coming at him, his expression changed, and he immediately circulated his Spiritual Power and vitality to protect himself.</p><p>He was a Body-tempering Cultivator, and a Real Lake Realm Body-tempering Cultivator at that, who was past the stage of relying on Spirit Artifacts for defense. His own physical body was the strongest protection he could have.</p><p>*Du du du…* Following three muffled sounds, the aura around Wu Jun’s body flickered, and he was forced back several steps before stabilizing himself.</p><p>His face immediately turned serious.</p><p>Even Yun Qingyue, who was watching from the side, revealed a look of surprise.</p><p>It was then that she realized that the rumors were indeed true, and Yi Ye’s strength was as domineering as was said to be.</p><p>The three Saber Lights she saw had exceeded her understanding of what a Spirit Creek Realm cultivator was capable of.</p><p>“Now, is that enough evidence?”</p><p>Lu Ye silently put away his blade.</p><p>Wu Jun was silent, his heart filled with shock. Even though it was just three Saber Lights, it allowed him to glimpse the extent of his strength. If they were to fight to the death here, then based on his current strength, he wouldn’t last more than three moves against Yi Ye.</p><p>The young were truly a force to be reckoned with!</p><p>“Please rest your anger, Cultivator Lu. Senior Brother Wu and I truly haven’t met you before. We came here today for an important matter, and Senior Brother Wu is just being cautious. There is no ill will behind it.” She bowed gracefully to Lu Ye. “Yun Qingyue from Snow Feather Clan greets Cultivator Lu.”</p><p>Wu Jun reluctantly cupped his fist and grumbled, “Wind Cloud Mansion, Wu Jun.”</p><p>Lu Ye had seen both the Snow Feather Clan and Wind Cloud Mansion on the 10-point map before, and both were First-Tier Sects. One was from Lei Zhou, while the other was from You Zhou, all information that was labeled on the map.</p><p>Lu Ye nodded slightly and returned the greeting. “Crimson Blood Sect, Lu Ye.”</p><p>Despite being from different factions, they were still experts in the Real Lake Realm or above, so It was only appropriate to show respect.</p><p>“What have the two of you come for? It doesn’t seem like you are here to deliver something,” Lu Ye asked, cutting straight to the point.</p><p>Yun Qingyue explained, “To be frank, the Divine Ocean Realm Masters are still discussing whether or not they should agree to your demands. After all, such a thing has happened once before, and our Thousand Demon Ridge was agreed to compromise then in hopes that you would not return to the Spirit Creek Battlefield after you left. Unexpectedly, after just a few months, the same situation has repeated itself, so the Divine Ocean Realm Masters are finding this situation difficult to accept.”</p><p>Mainly, they didn’t expect Lu Ye to continue killing recklessly in the Spirit Creek Battlefield even after advancing into the Cloud River Realm. Normally, higher-level cultivators would be constrained when invading the Spirit Creek Battlefield, but Lu Ye seemed to act without any fear.</p><p>“Senior Brother Wu and I were entrusted by the many Divine Ocean Realm Masters to come here and discuss a mutually acceptable solution with you.”</p><p>Lu Ye kept his gaze fixed on Yun Qingyue, who faced him with an amiable smile.</p><p>“How do you propose we discuss this?”</p><p>Yun Qingyue answered, “Regardless of what happened, Cultivator Lu can be considered to have bullied the weak in your actions this time. There are rules on the battlefield, and forcibly invading into the Spirit Creek Battlefield with your Cloud River Realm level of cultivation and destroying the Thousand Demon Ridge’s Outposts is indeed inappropriate. If all the cultivators from the major factions were to act like this, would the Spirit Creek Battlefield not then descend into chaos? What do you think?”</p><p>“Who else under the Heavens has the ability to do what I did?”</p><p>Yun Qingyue instantly fell silent. That was exactly the question that stumped the Thousand Demon Ridge. Without an answer to this question, they would never be qualified to negotiate with Lu Ye on equal terms.</p><p>“If anyone from Thousand Demon Ridge wants to emulate me, they are welcome to do so without any reservations. I have the ability, so I set the rules. Those without the ability should obediently follow. As for bullying the weak… in terms of age, most of the Core Circle cultivators are older than me. In terms of cultivation level, the Heavens have suppressed my cultivation level at Heaven Nine, which means that is all the power I can exert. So, where does this bullying of the weak come from?”</p><p>Yun Qingyue felt helpless at his questioning. “What you say is true, but your demands are indeed too harsh. Your demands bled out the various sects in the Thousand Demon Ridge last time, and they will not agree to such a thing again. The Divine Ocean Realm Masters have already reached a consensus on this matter. I know you suffered greatly in the Carnage Colosseum and incurred huge losses, so it’s understandable that you expect such compensation. However, you have already destroyed two Outposts and killed many people. Is that not enough to ease your anger?”</p><p>Lu Ye gazed indifferently at her star-like eyes. “If Cultivator Yun is here to talk nonsense, there’s no need to say more. I will only be waiting here until the end of the ten day deadline.”</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
