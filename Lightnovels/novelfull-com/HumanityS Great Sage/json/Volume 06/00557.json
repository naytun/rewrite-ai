His breath grew almost still, and even his vitality and his aura were reduced to an extreme state as if he were a dead man.</p><p>A milky-white light formed around his burly figure that induced the moon’s essence to pour down, and all of a sudden, half of the valley was bathed in the hazy and majestic moon essence.</p><p>The wolves gathered around Ju Jia and tilted their heads up, greedily devouring the moon essence that descended from the sky. Even Amber, who was perched on Ju Jia’s head, took on the same posture as the wolves.</p><p>Lu Ye stopped what he was doing and just watched the scene silently.</p><p>He wasn’t sure why such a phenomenon was triggered whenever Ju Jia cultivated, but for one, he believed that the phenomenon brought great benefits to the Spirit Beasts. Otherwise, the wolves wouldn’t keep on clinging to Ju Jia.</p><p>Amber had cultivated with Ju Jia before, and it did benefit it as well.</p><p>Rumor had it that Spirit Beasts had the ability to swallow the essence of both the sun and the moon to cultivate themselves, but Spirit Beasts wouldn’t generally cause such a commotion when they cultivated. Ju Jia was the only one that had this peculiarity.</p><p>After some thought, Lu Ye decided to collect his mind and tried to cultivate as well.</p><p>But soon, he gave up on the idea as it didn’t seem to have any special effect on him. The moon essence that he bathed in certainly warmed him up, but it didn’t have any effect on his strength.</p><p>The situation was the same for Yi Yi. So, he concluded that this kind of cultivation was only suited for Spirit Beasts! Ju Jia was undoubtedly an outlier, in this case.</p><p>Calling Yi Yi, Lu Ye stood up and summoned his Spirit Boat, heading up into the sky.</p><p>He wanted to see how visible the phenomenon formed by Ju Jia’s cultivation truly was. Even though the valley was surrounded by mountains on all sides, which could cover the visibility of the anomaly to a great extent, there was still a risk of exposure if the scope was too great. If that were the case, then the Spirit Beasts inside of the Grand Wilds Peak would surely gather, adding a lot of trouble to their plates. And if the cultivators were also lured over here, then this place would not be suitable for the Arcane Glade.</p><p>A quick inspection revealed that the situation was not that bad.</p><p>The phenomenon was mostly concealed by the valley, so unless one was close enough, it wouldn’t be easily detected.</p><p>Once he returned, he could set up a special Concealment Ward for Ju Jia, then there shouldn’t be too much of a problem left.</p><p>After returning to his spot, Lu Ye continued refining more Ward Flags.</p><p>When the sun came up, he, Ju Jia, and Yi Yi worked together to build places for them to live.</p><p>Since they decided to set up the Arcane Glade here, then they naturally couldn’t go without homes to live in. Even if cultivators did not have high requirements for their place of residence, it was still necessary to have a place where they could be protected from the wind and rain.</p><p>It didn’t take much to build a few wooden huts.</p><p>As the days passed, a few huts were erected in the picturesque mountain valley. In terms of Wards, Lu Ye had only set up a Concealment Ward to cover the phenomenon that arose from Ju Jia nightly cultivation, but he had not set anything up beyond that.</p><p>Everything would have to wait until Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan arrived and confirmed that the Arcane Glade would be created here.</p><p>On this day, Lu Ye was refining Ward Flags when he suddenly had a feeling in his heart, and he looked up in a direction. There, two streams of light entered his vision, quickly making their way over.</p><p>Once he focused his vision and confirmed who the two streams of light were, Lu Ye rose up to greet them.</p><p>Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan had arrived!</p><p>Upon seeing Lu Ye, the two of them immediately flew over to him, and soon, they were face-to-face. Lu Ye saluted, “Fourth Senior Brother, Senior Sister Feng!”</p><p>Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan both looked travel-worn, and in a bit of a messy state. Even though both of them were already in the Fifth Order Cloud River Realm, they still encountered some difficulties along the way. There were far too many Spirit Beasts lurking around in the Grand Wilds Peak. So, no matter which direction they came from, they would inevitably meet with some trouble.</p><p>If it weren’t for the many treasures that Feng Yuechan carried, then it would’ve been impossible for them to have come this deep into the mountain range with just their level of cultivation.</p><p>Even so, the two of them were targeted by a powerful Spirit Beast, and it took a lot of effort for them to get out of that situation.</p><p>Now that he saw Lu Ye, Li Baxian finally breathed a sigh of relief. “Little Junior Brother, this place really wasn’t easy to get to.”</p><p>However, it was exactly for that reason that this place was well-hidden.</p><p>Feng Yuechan had already been captivated by the picturesque scenery and was looking around. Upon seeing the many huge Wolf Mutants scattered around the valley, she couldn’t help but wince and tugged on Li Baxian’s sleeve, pointing to the front. “Senior Brother, look!”</p><p>When Li Baxian looked up, even his expression changed slightly, and he looked at Lu Ye with uncertainty. “What’s going on here?”</p><p>So many Wolf Mutants were gathered here that it was clear they were a pack. However, what he couldn’t understand was why his Little Junior Brother seemed to be living in peace with this pack of Wolf Mutants?</p><p>“It’s a long story.” Lu Ye called over Ju Jia, who was hanging around the side, and introduced them.</p><p>Ju Jia gave a silent bow as his greeting to Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan.</p><p>Feng Yuechan had to crane her head up to look at Ju Jia, who was at least two to three heads taller than her. Even though she had seen many large Body-tempering Cultivators before, she couldn’t help but think of two words upon seeing this man. Naturally gifted!</p><p>Ju Jia’s size alone gave off an oppressive aura, and it was hard to imagine just what kind of terrifying strength was hidden in such a tower-like figure.</p><p>Li Baxian had seen Ju Jia from a distance before, but had never met him face to face. Moreover, Ju Jia’s cultivation level was much lower than his then. Now that he got the chance to meet him again, he gave off a very different feeling to him. Even without fighting him, Li Baxian could judge at a glance that this Junior Brother Ju Jia was not an easy one to deal with.</p><p>“The wolf pack was brought here by Ju Jia. He creates an anomaly when he cultivates, and it benefits the wolves, so they began regarding Ju Jia as a sacred figure of theirs, and you can say they have a dependent relationship with Ju Jia,” Lu Ye gave them a brief explanation.</p><p>“Dependent?” Li Baxian clicked his tongue in wonder at what he heard, then he snapped to his senses. “Is this the complicated situation that you mentioned earlier?”</p><p>Lu Ye nodded.</p><p>Li Baxian didn’t know what to say. Not only was this a complicated situation, it was simply unheard of. It was unimaginable that a pack of Mutant Wolves like these would choose to become dependent on a cultivator.</p><p>“Do you think it’s safe?” Li Baxian asked.</p><p>“For now, it seems so. The wolves haven’t expressed any sort of hostility towards me in the past few days. They just want to cultivate with Ju Jia.”</p><p>“So, what’s that anomaly you were talking about? And why would it make the wolves follow Junior Brother Ju Jia?”</p><p>“Um, you’ll find out by nightfall. It’s a type of anomaly that has a strong attraction to Spirit Beasts. Many cultivators saw it before and thought that an Exotic Treasure had been born, which caused quite a commotion.”</p><p>Li Baxian pressed down the doubts in his heart and nodded. Then, he looked around at his surroundings before commenting, “This place is deep within the Grand Wilds Peak so it’s an excellent location, and the scenery is great. With a natural barrier, too… If this wolf pack can be relied upon, then this is indeed a suitable location for an Arcane Glade. Little Junior Brother has good eyes.”</p><p>Lu Ye shook his head. “It was the wolves who brought me here. He raised his hand and pointed at the largest Wolf Mutant. “That’s the pack leader. Generally, it’s the one we talk to when we have any issues.”</p><p>“Oh?” Li Baxian looked in the direction that Lu Ye was pointing to and saw the wolf looking their way. It had a curious look in its eyes, as if it couldn’t understand why two more Humans had come.</p><p>However, in the wolf’s mind, as long as their pack’s sacred figure didn’t go away, then it didn’t matter if more humans came. So, the wolf only looked at them for a moment before resting on the ground, no longer paying attention to their side.</p><p>“Do you think this is a suitable place for the Arcane Glade, Senior Brother?” Lu Ye asked.</p><p>“If we can trust the wolves, then it’s suitable,” Li Baxian answered. The only problem they may have to face by placing their Arcane Glade here was whether Spirit Beasts would come to disturb them. Moreover, any Spirit Beast that appeared in such a place would certainly not be too weak.</p><p>If the wolves could be relied upon, then they would serve as a natural deterrent, so not many Spirit Beasts would dare to come lest they bring misfortune upon themselves.</p><p>Foll𝑜w current novℯls on ƒrēewebnoѵёl.cσm.</p><p>“I’m curious to know just how strong that pack leader is, and also, what is the general strength of the pack?” Li Baxian asked cautiously.</p><p>“I’ve been observing them for the past few days and the pack leader has strength equivalent to the Ninth Order Cloud River Realm, but the strength of the pack is mixed. There are those in the Eighth or Ninth order, but also those in the First or Second Order. Most of them are above the Fifth Order, whereas those below that only take up thirty percent of the pack.” Lu Ye went on, “I know what Senior Brother is worried about, and I was considering the same question myself. However, based on my observations through the past few days, the wolves have shown no intentions other than a strong reliance on following Ju Jia to cultivate.”</p><p>“What about Junior Brother Ju Jia?” Li Baxian then asked.</p><p>“Ju Jia is in the Fourth Order.”</p><p>His cultivation level was the same as Lu Ye’s current level.</p><p>He entered the Cloud River Battlefield several months before Lu Ye, but there was still energy left in the Mutant Core in Ju Jia’s body when he broke through into the Cloud River Realm, so he had some foundation in his cultivation upon his advancement.</p><p>The reason Lu Ye could advance so quickly in his cultivation was thanks to the number of Amulets he had amassed, but Ju Jia was different. His gains in his cultivation came through bitter cultivation that he obtained while in that state of dormancy.</p><p>Lu Ye had known as early as in the Spirit Creek Battlefield that Ju Jia was very tolerant of loneliness. Apart from cultivating, his greatest pleasure in life was generally to eat with Lu Ye. Other than that, there was nothing else that could arouse his interest.</p><p>Lu Ye had met so many people, and there was none that lived a life as pure as Ju Jia. And, it was precisely because of that purity that even through grueling cultivation, he could advance so quickly.</p><p>Not to mention, Ju Jia’s method of cultivation was more special than anyone else.</p><p>“Senior Brother, are you thinking that Ju Jia isn’t strong enough to suppress the wolves?” Lu Ye could see the concern that Li Baxian was having.</p><p>Li Baxian nodded. “Spirit Beasts are simply Spirit Beasts, after all. They’re wild and undomesticated, so it’s difficult to subdue them without sufficient strength.”</p><p>It was only natural for him to be worried. If one day, the wolves suddenly erupted and attacked them, then none of them would get away unscathed.</p><p>However, there was no guarantee that that would happen.</p><p>While the two of them were talking here, Ju Jia, who stood idly by the side, suddenly raised his head and made a strange sound towards the location of the wolves. it sounded deep like the howl of a wolf, but not exactly.</p><p>The pack leader that was lying at that side immediately got up and ran over to Ju Jia’s side, then looked up at him with enquiring eyes.</p><p><i>Peng peng…</i> Ju Jia raised his hand and slapped it on the head several times.</p><p>Both Lu Ye and Li Baxian’s eyes twitched at that.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
