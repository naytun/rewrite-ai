The roar originated from at least ten to fifteen kilometers away, yet it still exerted an immense sense of oppression on everyone as it reached them.</p><p>This was the might of an elite-level Spirit Beast!</p><p>After another while, several figures appeared before their eyes. It was Zhou Yuntian and the others who had left earlier. freeweɓnovel.cøm</p><p>Even though there were more than ten of them when they left, only seven of them returned. The rest of the group had vanished, but it was easy to guess their fates.</p><p>A tall figure rose and fell behind them, chasing them closely like maggots on bones. The figure couldn’t fly and only leapt continuously across the ground, but its speed surpassed even that of Zhou Yuntian and the group’s telekinetic flight, causing tremors with each landing.</p><p>The group who were being chased had panic-stricken expressions on their faces. Each of them had exerted all their strength, pushing their speed to the limit, but they still couldn’t shake off their pursuer.</p><p>Lu Ye focused his gaze over and discovered that the black figure was a giant ape covered in red fur. It was the elite-level Spirit Beast that was marked on the 10-point map, the Berserk Giant Ape!</p><p>Whatever Zhou Yuntian and the others did to it, the Berserk Giant Ape’s eyes were filled with ferocity and the killing intent that emanated from it was palpably chilling, freezing the hearts of the escaping cultivators as if they had fallen into a cavern of eternal ice.</p><p>The Berserk Giant Ape leapt high into the air again, and a large hand suddenly reached out, grabbing one of the cultivators at the back of the group.</p><p>Though Lu Ye wasn’t familiar with this particular cultivator, he had seen him a few times among the people of Fox Immortal Valley and knew that his cultivation realm was in the Eighth Order.</p><p>However, at this moment, this cultivator in the Eighth Order Cloud River Realm, who could be considered a strong presence in the entire Cloud River Battlefield, was just like a little chick in the hands of the Berserk Giant Ape.</p><p>“Help!” The cultivator looked panicked as he waved his arms, calling for help.</p><p>Those words had barely left his mouth when the Berserk Giant Ape tightened its grip, and with a squish, he exploded into a rain of blood, with no trace of his remains left behind.</p><p>This scene shocked the onlooking cultivators, causing their eyelids to twitch nervously and filling their hearts with horror.</p><p>Before today’s mission, the Fox Mutant had already informed them of their task and target. Even though they were mentally prepared to sacrifice their lives for the Fox Mutant, witnessing this scene still sent chills down their spines and an uncontrollable fear permeated their bodies.</p><p>Many cultivators instinctively backed away as doubts grew in their hearts.</p><p>Was this terrifying existence really something they could kill?</p><p>A cultivator at the Cloud a River Realm was instantly crushed by a single hand. This visual impact caused their previous ambitions to melt away like snowflakes under the scorching sun.</p><p>Facing such a formidable opponent, no one cultivator felt safe!</p><p>“What are you afraid of? Today, either it dies or you all perish! No one is allowed to retreat!” bone-chilling words were uttered from the red lips of the Fox Mutant.</p><p>As soon as she spoke, the cultivators no longer backed away, and the looks of fear on their faces gradually disappeared, replaced by resolute expressions.</p><p>The Divine Soul Secret Technique planted by the Fox Mutant had taken effect. For the cultivators of Fox Immortal Valley, the Fox Mutant’s words were commands that they could not resist.</p><p>Someone roared, “For the mistress, we must slay this beast today!”</p><p>The warriors were invigorated, “Slay the beast!”</p><p>In an instant, their fighting spirit soared.</p><p>Moving 10 kilometers in the blink of an eye, Zhou Yuntian and the others managed to escape in a sorry state, but they managed to stay alive. Behind them was the Berserk Giant Ape that was chasing after them.</p><p>“Attack!” With the Fox Mutant’s command, the scattered cultivators of Fox Immortal Valley attacked at once. For a while, there was a chaotic mess of Spiritual Power. A torrent of telekinetic techniques and spell techniques surged towards the Berserk Giant Ape, turning the area around it into a deadly vortex.</p><p>As the cultivators of Fox Immortal Valley attacked, the Berserk Giant Ape leapt into the air. However, the eruption of telekinetic techniques and spell techniques caused the massive beast to fall straight down and crash heavily to the ground.</p><p>The earth cracked and dust filled the air.</p><p>*Hou!* The Berserk Giant Ape struggled to its feet and let out a furious roar, causing shockwaves that were visible to the naked eye to sweep forward, uprooting nearby trees like a tornado.</p><p>Yet it was met with even more telekinetic techniques and spell techniques that blossomed into colorful lights, lighting up the area.</p><p>*Du du du…* The attacks sounded as they blasted against the Berserk Giant Ape’s body. The gigantic figure that stood over ten meters tall staggered backward under the relentless assault, swaying unsteadily.</p><p>Despite some casualties, there were still about eighty cultivators from Fox Immortal Valley, so the convergence of such force was terrifying.</p><p>For a moment, the might of the Berserk Giant Ape was suppressed.</p><p>Seeing this scene, the cultivators of Fox Immortal Valley rejoiced as many of them realized that this elite-level Spirit Beast wasn’t as formidable as they had imagined, so their attacks grew fiercer.</p><p>Among all the cultivators, only Lu Ye and Xie Yunhan did not participate in the siege against the Berserk Giant Ape.</p><p>The two were responsible for overseeing the Wards in the area and were flying in mid-air with their Spirit Artifacts.</p><p>Watching the massive figure stagger under the barrage of telekinetic techniques and spell techniques, Lu Ye glanced at the Fox Mutant who stood in the midst of the crowd.</p><p>The Fox Mutant’s face showed no signs of joy. Instead, she had a grave expression.</p><p>This caused Lu Ye’s heart to sink.</p><p>The situation wasn’t as optimistic as he had thought. Among all of Fox Immortal Valley, no one knew the strength of the Berserk Giant Ape better than the Fox Mutant. Her expression undoubtedly conveyed some hints.</p><p>However, in such a situation, Lu Ye simply couldn’t think of any means by which the Berserk Giant Ape could turn the tables. Over eighty cultivators were focusing their attacks on it, so even an elite-level Spirit Beast should struggle to make a comeback.</p><p>Just as he was thinking so, another thunderous roar erupted from the Berserk Giant Ape. It seemed that the attacks had enraged the elite-level Spirit Beast, and this roar was even more powerful than the one before. Even Lu Ye’s figure swayed in the air from its sweeping shockwave.</p><p>As he looked, Lu Ye’s eyes twitched.</p><p>He saw that within the center of the chaotic area where the colorful lights and mess of Spiritual Power were, a dazzling red radiance suddenly expanded like a bursting sun. Terrifying Spirit Essence engulfed the surroundings, and cries of astonishment rang out among the cultivators as their connections with their telekinetic techniques were severed in that instant.</p><p>*Ding ding dang dang…* A series of sounds resounded as various telekinetic techniques fell around the Berserk Giant Ape, their radiance clearly indicating that they had lost their spirituality.</p><p>This was due to the impact of the elite-level Spirit Beast’s Spirit Essence.</p><p>In the next moment, the previously suppressed Berserk Giant Ape suddenly leapt high, breaking through the encirclement, and its large figure that emanated an indescribable sense of oppression descended upon the most densely packed area of people.</p><p>In that instant, Lu Ye’s pupils contracted in shock.</p><p>Without the interference of the telekinetic techniques and spell techniques, Lu Ye could finally see the current state of the Berserk Giant Ape, and was astonished to find that despite enduring the relentless bombardment from the cultivators for more than a dozen breaths, the Berserk Giant Ape had not suffered any injuries. Even its red fur remained undamaged, wrapped in a dense and solid layer of Spirit Essence that formed an impenetrable defense!</p><p>Lu Ye finally understood why the Fox Mutant’s expression had become grave.</p><p>The strength of this elite-level Spirit Beast had actually exceeded his expectations.</p><p>During the previous situation, even a cultivator who had just advanced into the Real Lake Realm would not have been able to emerge unscathed, yet the Berserk Giant Ape showed no signs of injury.</p><p>Lu Ye did not know the exact extent of its power, but its defensive capabilities were undoubtedly much more formidable than those of some low order Real Lake Realm cultivators.</p><p>It was impossible to harm it without breaking through its barrier of Spirit Essence.</p><p>If they couldn’t even damage it, how could they hope to kill it?</p><p>Lu Ye inwardly rejoiced that he hadn’t tampered with the Wards but instead exerted all his efforts on them, showcasing everything he had learned. Otherwise, things would truly have been dangerous.</p><p>Amidst cries of alarm, the Berserk Giant Ape crashed down.</p><p>The earth trembled, and cracks spread out like a spider’s web with its landing point as the center.</p><p>Some quick-witted cultivators had already fled, but a few were caught off guard and only realized that they had to escape when the Berserk Giant Ape landed in front of them.</p><p>However, it was too late!</p><p>With a swipe of its hand, the Berserk Giant Ape grabbed the nearest cultivator, smashing them mercilessly into the ground amidst their terrified and desperate screams.</p><p>The despairing cries ceased abruptly, and a bloody mess was left on the ground.</p><p>The Berserk Giant Ape took a few steps forward, catching up to another cultivator. Its massive hand covered the sky as it slammed down, reducing the cultivator to a pulp before they could even make a sound.</p><p>It then turned around, emitting short growling sounds from its mouth. With an agility that no one could comprehend, it swiftly grabbed a third cultivator and opened its gaping red maw, biting down on them.</p><p>Blood spattered as the cultivator’s upper body disappeared in an instant!</p><p>The giant ape did not pursue the fleeing cultivators but instead spat out the half of the corpse it held in its mouth that was now covered in blood. It stood tall with its head held high, raising its hands to beat its chest.</p><p>*Peng peng peng…* A dull thumping sounded like a war hammer striking a battle drum, shaking the eardrums of those around.</p><p>Accompanying the beating, it let out a furious roar, showcasing the might of this elite-level Spirit Beast.</p><p>In the air, the Ward Flag in Lu Ye’s hand flickered.</p><p>The Berserk Giant Ape had vaguely sensed something, but before it could react, violent Spiritual Power surged around it, followed by a dazzling blaze that soared into the sky, turning a vast area into a hellscape.</p><p>A thunderous noise echoed, spreading in all directions as the blaze enveloped the form of the Berserk Giant Ape.</p><p>Explosive Ward!</p><p>However, in the next moment, the stalwart figure of the Berserk Giant Ape charged out from within the blaze, its entire body engulfed in swirling Spirit Essence, still without a scratch.</p><p>This was an Explosive Ward that Lu Ye had set up and activated in advance using a Spirit Stone to start accumulating energy. Its power was at least one and a half times as strong as a normal Explosive Ward, yet it still couldn’t shake the protective Spirit Essence of an elite-level Spirit Beast.</p><p>“Kill it!” the Fox Mutant roared.</p><p>The panicked cultivators snapped out of their daze and attacked the Berserk Giant Ape once again.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
