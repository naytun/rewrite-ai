After all, he possessed cultivation in the level of the Ninth Order Cloud River Realm. Lu Ye, a Fourth Order cultivator, could do nothing more than confine him rather than possess any actual ability to kill him.</p><p>His only priority now was to escape from this place as quickly as possible. Although Tan Sheng and Xia Liang were stronger than him, the saying, two fists were no match for four hands, still held true. They were definitely not a match for the wolf pack. It was unrealistic to expect himself to be able to cut down Yi Ye quickly on his own. If he lingered here for too long, regardless of the outcome for Tan Sheng and Xia Liang, Wei Que knew he wouldn’t have a good end.</p><p>But how could he escape from here?</p><p>Wei Que felt frustrated. Gritting his teeth, he shouted angrily, “Yi Ye, is this all you’ve got? Come out and fight me if you dare!”</p><p>Unless he was pushed to the brink, it was embarrassing for a Ninth Order cultivator like him to shout such words at a Fourth Order cultivator unless absolutely necessary. Of course, he only shouted once and didn’t expect it to have any effect.</p><p>As long as Yi Ye was out of his mind, he wouldn’t show himself in front of Wei Que.</p><p>However, what surprised Wei Que was that just as his voice sounded, he suddenly sensed the flow of a different aura not far ahead.</p><p>That was an aura mixed with Spiritual Power and vitality unique to cultivators!</p><p>And it was right in front of him!</p><p>Wei Que was overjoyed. He raised his hand and sent out a swift and powerful Golden Arc with a forward slash, simultaneously lunging forward to take Lu Ye down.</p><p>The Golden Arc rang dully as it hit its target, as if his Spell Technique had struck against some sort of indestructible defense.</p><p>Wei Que didn’t think much of it and continued moving forward until a tall figure appeared in the mist ahead, and that was when he finally realized that something was wrong.</p><p>[Yi Ye… shouldn’t be that burly, right?]</p><p>The mist churned, and a large hand like a fan emerged, going straight for Wei Que’s neck. The speed of the hand wasn’t fast, but it carried an overwhelming aura.</p><p>Even as a Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivator, Wei Que couldn’t help but get the illusion that it would be difficult for him to escape once he was caught by this hand.</p><p>[What’s this? An illusion?]</p><p>Wei Que was confused for a moment. The Spiritual Power around his body surged, and he launched a golden arrow forward, which clashed directly with the incoming hand. With a bang, the Spell Technique exploded, momentarily slowing down the hand’s movement. However, it quickly launched at him again at an even faster speed.</p><p>Wei Que felt a chill run down his spine. While his body froze up, he hastily retreated.</p><p>Before he could steady his footing, however, the hum of swords ringing out one after another resounded intensely. At the same time, a stinging sensation spread across his skin.</p><p>“Flying Swords!” Wei Que’s expression changed abruptly as he frantically circulated his Spiritual Power to protect himself.</p><p>In the next instant, flying swords came slashing from all directions, causing the Spiritual Light around his body to flicker incessantly, and the Spiritual Power protecting him quickly dimmed.</p><p>Another Spell Technique hit him from the side, staggering him.</p><p>But it wasn’t over yet. Just as Wei Que was confused, another figure dashed past him. A fiery red Blade Light descended, violently shattering his Spiritual Power shield.</p><p>The figure vanished in a flash before Wei Que could counterattack, leaving only a flared gash on his body.</p><p>Wei Que was shocked, but the burly figure in front of him came pressing down like a mountain, striking out with a punch.</p><p>With a loud bang, Wei Que’s body was sent flying back and he landed in a pitiful state. He quickly got up, still confused as he looked around him. Apart from the rolling mist and the colorful bands of light, there was no sign of anyone.</p><p>He was truly dumbfounded!</p><p>He had initially thought he only needed to deal with the Fourth Order Yi Ye, but from the sudden turn of events, it seemed there was more than one Yi Ye in this Illusion Ward!</p><p>In the short span of time just now, at least four people had attacked him. There were three others besides Yi Ye!</p><p>One was a burly Body-tempering Cultivator, another was a Sword Cultivator, and the third was a Spell Cultivator!</p><p>Sword Cultivator… It had to be Li Baxian!</p><p>Wei Que immediately realized that their previous conjecture about Yi Ye inviting Li Baxian to join Arcane Glade had been correct. However, when they stormed into the Arcane Glade, they only saw Lu Ye and didn’t notice any traces of the others. They didn’t think much of it at the time, but now it seemed that Yi Ye wasn’t alone in the Arcane Glade. The others had hidden themselves in advance.</p><p>The Sword Cultivator who attacked him was undoubtedly Li Baxian. Even the cultivation level matched.</p><p>In that case, the Spell Cultivator should be Feng Yuechan. These two were always inseparable.</p><p>As for the Body-tempering Cultivator… Wei Que had no clue. It seemed that Yi Ye had found himself another helper from somewhere.</p><p>After figuring this out, Wei Que’s heart sank.</p><p>He didn’t feel much sense of danger when he was caught in the Illusion Ward at first. After all, one Yi Ye couldn’t do much to him. If his opponent truly wanted to kill him, he was completely capable of counterattacking at the opportune moment.</p><p>But now, he was facing not just one Yi Ye but three others as well. Coupled with the Illusion Ward, Wei Que could already smell the scent of death wafting over him.</p><p>*Dong dong dong…*</p><p>Heavy footsteps approached from the side as if something gigantic was running towards him. When Wei Que turned his head to look, he saw the burly figure revealing itself again, breaking through the mist and charging straight towards him like a thunderbolt.</p><p>Wei Que swiftly dodged while casting a Spell Technique towards the attacker.</p><p>When his Spell Technique struck his opponent, the burly figure only paused for a moment, showing no signs of injury. Taking advantage of when Wei Que’s attention was diverted, the cacophony of swords rang out once again, and immediately after that, Wei Que felt himself being bombarded by a storm of attacks.</p><p>In addition to the Flying Swords that were cutting his way, there were also Spell Techniques bombarding him from an unclear sauce, staggering him as the blood in his body tossed.</p><p>Another fierce surge of killing intent emerged behind him, and Wei Que quickly turned around, only to be greeted by another fiery red light.</p><p>As the blade descended, a massive wound appeared on his chest, and blood splattered everywhere alongside an exclamation of shock from Wei Que.</p><p>The burly figure managed to close in on him and delivered a seemingly clumsy punch, yet it contained terrifying force. Wei Que was sent flying like a raggedy sack, spitting blood in mid-air.</p><p>He quickly landed and shouted with a clear look of panic on his face, “Brother Xia, Brother Tan, save me!”</p><p>He never expected that chasing after Yi Ye would lead him into such a dire situation.</p><p>The attackers mobbing him weren’t too powerful, all of them in the Fourth or Fifth Order. Under normal circumstances, Wei Que could easily handle them even if he were alone.</p><p>However, being trapped in the Illusion Ward rendered his strength practically useless while his opponents thrived, launching attacks every so often and retreating before he could counterattack.</p><p>He was just like fish on a chopping board, being sliced by the enemy from time to time…</p><p>In these circumstances, if he didn’t seek help, the only thing he could do was await death.</p><p>A piercing scream echoed within the Arcane Glade, causing the faces of Tan Sheng and Xia Liang, who were engaged in a fierce battle with the Wolf Mutants, to change. frёewebnoѵēl.com</p><p>They were also in an extremely precarious situation at the moment. The number of Wolf Mutants was overwhelming, and if it weren’t for the profundity of their foundations, an ordinary Ninth Order cultivator would long have failed to hold on since long ago.</p><p>Even so, both of them were still struggling to defend themselves against the continuous onslaught of the Wolf Mutants.</p><p>They had initially hoped that Wei Que would quickly succeed. As long as they killed Yi Ye and obtained the Control Gem, they could easily get away. Instead, however, what they heard was a plea for help from Wei Que!</p><p>There was no way they wouldn’t be shocked by that.</p><p>When they managed a quick glance towards the source of the sound in the midst of their fight, they saw a shearing mist that shrouded a vast area, concealing the figures of Wei Que and Yi Ye. Only occasional flashes of light emerged from the mist, accompanied by Wei Que’s shrieks and cries.</p><p>[What was going on?]</p><p>Both Tan Sheng and Xia Liang were bewildered.</p><p>Since invading the Arcane Glade, everything they encountered had been beyond their imaginations, and it left them at a loss. Though they had no idea what Wei Que was encountering, they could tell from the commotion in his direction that he was in danger.</p><p>In this current situation, not to mention killing Yi Ye, whether they could escape or not was still uncertain.</p><p>They regretted having not brought more reinforcements with them.</p><p>They initially thought that with three Ninth Order cultivators working together, Yi Ye shouldn’t be able to cause much trouble once they found him, but who could have thought that this was how things would go for them?</p><p>In the midst of the intense battle, Tan Sheng and Xia Liang exchanged glances. Even without words, they understood what the other meant to imply.</p><p>They couldn’t stay here any longer!</p><p>Regardless of what Wei Que was going through over there, Yi Ye was definitely involved. If Wei Que died and Yi Ye turned his attention towards them, things naturally wouldn’t end well.</p><p>Therefore, it was crucial to leave as soon as possible.</p><p>However, with Arcane Glade enveloped by the Trap Ward, they would have to destroy it first to have any chance to leave. As for whether or not they should rescue Wei Que, it was no longer within their consideration. The premise of rescuing someone was being able to protect oneself. If they didn’t even have the power to protect themselves, there was no point in thinking about rescuing others.</p><p>After making up their minds, both of them cooperated tacitly, shifting the battlefield towards the edge of the Grand Ward.</p><p>Given the circumstances, it was unrealistic to expect they could break through the Ward with their own strength. Surrounded by the Wolf Mutants, they could barely maintain their own defense. If they truly wanted to destroy the Ward, they would have to rely on the power of the Wolf Mutants and have them break the Ward with the aftershocks of their attacks.</p><p>Though this approach was less efficient, it was better than simply waiting for death in this place.</p><p>In order to destroy the Trap Ward more quickly, both of them exerted all their strength, causing them to sustain even more injuries, which left them in an even sorrier state.</p><p>As time passed, Wei Que became disheveled in the Illusion Ward, covered in blood and wounds from head to toe as he circulated his Spiritual Power as desperately as he could, unleashing powerful Spell Techniques aimlessly in all directions.</p><p>He didn’t know where the enemies were hiding, but he knew that as soon as he revealed any openings, he would be met with a torrential storm of attacks. In less than an incense stick of time, he had already accumulated seven or eight wounds on his body. Among them, the wound in his abdomen was the most severe. A Flying Sword had pierced through him, causing blood to flow incessantly whilst his face contorted in agony.</p><p>So, even if he understood that his actions were merely quenching a thirst with poison, he had no choice but to press on. Stopping would only result in a quicker death.</p><p>This approach was still quite effective. At the very least, no one came to launch a surprise attack on him in the midst of his unceasing Spell Techniques.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
