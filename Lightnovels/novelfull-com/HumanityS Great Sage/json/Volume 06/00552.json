Other people were unable to use that particular column.</p><p>So, even though the Divine Opportunity Column in the Carnage Colosseum was worth a hundred thousand Contributions, it was nothing more than abandoned waste in the end.</p><p>He hadn’t agreed with Li Baxian on a meeting place, but Lu Ye had a feeling that he would be waiting near the Carnage Colosseum. So, after just a moment of thought, Lu Ye picked the blue light dot.</p><p>As his vision distorted, his body grew light.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, his figure disappeared from the Sanctum of Providence.</p><p>This chapt𝒆r is updated by frёewebηovel.cѳm.</p><p>In the Cloud River Battlefield, where the Carnage Colosseum one was, Lu Ye appeared before the Divine Opportunity Column and immediately began looking around his surroundings.</p><p>Nothing seemed out of place here. This place was bustling more than a month ago, but as the Carnage Colosseum had been closed for such a long amount of time, there were naturally no more cultivators hanging about this area.</p><p>However, Lu Ye could still spot traces of a large battle in his surroundings, especially where Lu Ye used Glyph: Fire Phoenix. The ground there was scorched, showing the intensity of the battle that went on that day.</p><p>Lu Ye pressed on his Battlefield Imprint and sent out a message. “Fourth Senior Brother, I’ve returned!”</p><p>It wasn’t long before he received Li Baxian’s reply. Just as Lu Ye guessed, Li Baxian and Feng Yueshan did not head far. Since they did not agree on a meeting place beforehand, the two of them had been training within a radius of around 500 kilometers from here while they waited for Lu Ye’s return.</p><p>They conversed briefly and chose to meet up at the nearby Divine Trade Association. Then, Lu Ye messaged Ju Jia.</p><p>It was a brief message stating, “Location!”</p><p>Atop a certain Spirit Peak, a large figure resembling a large statue sat on the ground, traces of dust and frost over its body. The area where it sat was practically covered in fallen leaves.</p><p>The large figure did not breathe, and its aura was extremely dim. There also seemed to be hardly any vitality flowing out of it.</p><p>Even if someone did walk by it, they would only assume that it was a dead man.</p><p>After sitting here for more than two months, Ju Jia had entered a state of stillness.</p><p>After receiving Lu Ye’s message to wait there, he had obediently kept still until now.</p><p>He did not even feel the time passing by.</p><p>It wasn’t until he felt a reaction from his Battlefield Imprint that Ju Jia slowly opened his eyes to check on it. Leaves trickled down as he moved, and two birds that were nesting on his head flapped their wings and flew away.</p><p>Ju Jia scratched his head and caught a bird’s nest from the top of it. Seemingly finding it a shame to destroy it, he put it back on his head after some thought.</p><p>Ju Jia was confused when Lu Ye asked him for his location, but he gave him his current position anyway.</p><p>On the other end, when Lu Ye saw Ju Jia’s response, he was stunned, the reason being that the location he was in was exactly the same as the one he gave him nearly two months ago.</p><p>“You never moved?”</p><p>“Nope!”</p><p>“Wait there for me.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>It wasn’t until Ju Jia ended the conversation with Lu Ye that he noticed the changes in his environment. Looking around, he saw giant wolves the size of calves either squatting or standing in all directions, their beast eyes staring intently at him.</p><p>Their numbers were quite large, and there seemed to be at least hundreds of them.</p><p>Any other cultivator would be shocked to encounter such a thing, but Ju Jia only froze for a moment since he didn’t see any malice in the eyes of those wolves, but a more human sense of surprise and curiosity. These giant wolves seemed to be surprised that Ju Jia was alive!</p><p>After all, Ju Jia had not moved for nearly two months, nor did he show any clear signs of vitality. None of the wolves expected him to be a living thing.</p><p>After watching them for a moment, Ju Jia shut his eyes again and soon entered the same bizarrely still state.</p><p>He didn’t feel any sense of crisis being surrounded by such a large pack of wolves. In his mind, if the other party didn’t harbor any malicious intent towards him, then it didn’t matter.</p><p>What was more, even if the wolves were going to gang up on him, he wasn’t without the power to defend himself.</p><p>Seeing that Ju Jia had fallen silent again, the wolves that were in a bit of commotion calmed down as well, and a while later, one of them went up to Ju Jia and sniffed him carefully as if to ascertain whether this guy in front of him was actually alive or dead.</p><p>Eventually, it walked away in confusion.</p><p>As night fell, the bright moon and sparse stars appeared in the sky.</p><p>As he was enveloped by the moonlight, a milky glow suddenly appeared on Ju Jia’s body. That light seemed to have a strange resonance with the moon in the sky, drawing the moon into pouring down its essence.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, moon essence surged incessantly on the large Spirit Peak, bathing it in that milky white glow, giving the Spirit Peak an extremely sacred appearance.</p><p>Ju Jia could cultivate through breathing moon essence in and out, something which Lu Ye had long known. Amber had also followed along with Ju Jia to cultivate in the same way, and according to Yi Yi’s observation, Amber gained a lot out of it. It was just a pity that they never saw each other again since leaving the Spirit Creek Battlefield. frёeωebɳovel.com</p><p>This pack of wolves were drawn to the Spirit Peak due to the strange occurrences that happened every night. If Amber could benefit from cultivating with Ju Jia, then so could these wolves.</p><p>The wolves had been aware of Ju Jia’s presence five days since he ended up here, but Spirit Beasts were simple-minded. Whether Ju Jia was dead or alive, it was an existence that could bring about great benefit to them, so even when Ju Jia woke up, the wolves did not show him the slightest hint of malice.</p><p>In their minds, Ju jia was equivalent to a divine relic to their pack, something that could make them grow stronger at a rapid rate, and that was why they stayed here the whole time.</p><p>As the essence of the moon poured down, each wolf instinctively raised and breathed the essence in.</p><p>As the moon rose into the sky, the anomaly on the Spirit Peak became even clearer.</p><p>But the wolves weren’t the only ones attracted by the scene. Other Spirit Beasts were present, too.</p><p>Spirit Beasts were strongly territorial, so such a relic that could enhance the strength of one’s tribe had long been regarded by the wolf pack as their forbidden possession that other Spirit Beasts were not to lay their hands on.</p><p>So, on almost every moonlit night, the wolves fought with the other Spirit Beasts that were attracted to the area, and it was through these fights that the wolves established their monopoly over this territory.</p><p>Ju Jia was completely unaware of these goings-on.</p><p>He always thought that he was just taking a short break.</p><p>At the Divine Trade Association, in a guest room, Lu Ye was cultivating while reading. When a knock came at the door, Yi Yi got up to open it.</p><p>Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan, who wore masks of a boy and a girl, arrived together.</p><p>Lu Ye got up to greet them.</p><p>Taking off his mask, Li Baxian had a look of shame on his face. “Little Junior Brother, you have truly suffered in the Carnage Colosseum, and as your Senior Brother, I wasn’t able to do anything to help. For that, I’m ashamed!”</p><p>During this period of time, every time he recalled what happened in the Carnage Colosseum, Li Baxian would feel himself racked with guilt. Fortunately, however, Lu Ye had a strong heritage and the favor of the Heavens, so he was still able to escape from that desperate situation at the very end.</p><p>Lu Ye reassured him. “Don’t beat yourself up over it, Senior Brother. When I was being hunted down, I’d received aid from many of the Grand Sky Coalition’s experts. If it weren’t for Senior Brother’s connections, then I wouldn’t have been able to hold out until the end.”</p><p>Li Baxian sighed. “In the end, it’s most important for one to be strong themselves.”</p><p>In the Spirit Creek Battlefield, he and Feng Yuechan dominated for many years, but upon arriving at the Cloud River Battlefield, the fame of their past did not bring them any conveniences, but instead brought them danger, something which he couldn’t help but sigh at.</p><p>And how could it be any different for Lu Ye?</p><p>Before the Carnage Colosseum, he didn’t have too many worries walking about in the Cloud River Battlefield, but after the incident, he was sure that the Thousand Demon Ridge would spare no effort in finding out where he was and to hunt him down again.</p><p>In the future, his situation in the Cloud River Battlefield may not be as peaceful as before.</p><p>Next to them, Feng Yuechan advised, “Strength will grow bit by bit so there’s no need to rush. Compared to others, our cultivation levels have already been rising quickly.”</p><p>“Senior Sister Feng is right.”</p><p>Lu Ye invited the two to sit down whilst Yi Yi poured them cups of tea. Only then did he bring out the six Golden Amulets and pushed it to the two of them. “These are for Senior Brother and Senior Sister Feng. I’ve already used my share.”</p><p>Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan did not refuse the Amulets and stored them away.</p><p>With these Golden Amulets, they would be able to make a breakthrough into the Fifth Order in a short amount of time. Such a speed in cultivation could not be described as slow by any means, and with both of them in the Fifth Order, even if they were to bump into a Seventh Order cultivator in the future, they may not be any match for them.</p><p>Lu Ye also took out his Spirit Beast Bag and took out the fat white Primus-level Wisp of Sanctification from it.</p><p>“So this is the Primus-level Wisp of Sanctification?” Other than Lu Ye, everyone present couldn’t help but look at the object in curiosity as it was their first time seeing it.</p><p>Yi Yi went forward and gave it a poke, causing the Wisp of Sanctification to curl up in response.</p><p>“It’s still alive?” Feng Yuechan was astonished.</p><p>“What do you think, Senior Brother? Should we use this Wisp of Sanctification ourselves or should we sell it?” Lu Ye asked.</p><p>Li Baxian pondered for a while before responding, “If we sell it, then we certainly wouldn’t have to worry about finding a buyer. However, we don’t really have much of a need for idle resources. If we were to trade it for Amulets, then we aren’t sure how much a Primus-level Wisp of Sanctification is worth either. Moreover, other people may not be able to gather enough Amulets for it within a short amount of time. Right now, all of us are in the Fourth Order, so we’ll be here in the Cloud River Battlefield for a long time. If we can have our own Arcane Glade, then our cultivation would become more efficient.”</p><p>Lu Ye nodded. “I think so too.”</p><p>Instead of selling the Primus-level Wisp of Sanctification for some Amulets, it would be better to use it themselves.</p><p>Furthermore, even if they were to ascend into the Real Lake Realm in the future and left the Cloud River Battlefield, the Primus-level Arcane Glade that was left behind could be passed on to the other disciples of their sect.</p><p>In the Cloud River Battlefield, there were many such Arcane Glades that had been passed down for generations, all of which were the exclusive domains of each sect.</p><p>“But if we really want to use it for ourselves, then there are some issues that have to be resolved, the largest one being the location of the Arcane Glade,” Li Baxian slowly spoke up.</p><p>With a Primus-level Wisp of Sanctification then as long as one was in the Cloud River Battlefield, one could create a Primus-level Arcane Glade anywhere, but if one did not choose the location well, then they would surely meet with a lot of trouble in the future.</p><p>Firstly, they had to make sure that it was well hidden.</p><p>However, for high-flying Cloud River Realm cultivators, where could one find a hidden place to begin with? Unless it was some forbidden area that some cultivators dared not tread into, like the Myriad Poison Forest or the Burning Lands of the Spirit Creek Battlefield.</p><p>Even Lu Ye’s Wards could not guarantee much. Back then, they had a Tertiary-level Arcane Glade, and Lu Ye had also left Wards behind when he left. In the end, it had still been breached, and his Wisp of Sanctification had been plundered.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
