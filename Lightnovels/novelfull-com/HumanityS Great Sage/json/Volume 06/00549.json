After all, it was a reward that could directly aid him in cultivation. For the current him, nothing was more important than that.</p><p>Inside the Vault of Providence, Lu Ye immersed his consciousness and connected it with the golden mark on the back of his hand. Then, his vision blurred, and he appeared inside of a secret room. The room wasn‚Äôt very large, and there was a table at the very center of it. There were only two chests placed on the table, one big and one small, looking extremely simple.</p><p>On each chest was a golden mark, which was the same mark that the Heavens left on the back of Lu Ye‚Äôs hand. The mark just looked like a golden octagonal disc with nothing special about it.</p><p>Walking forward, he opened up the larger chest, and all of a sudden, the room was filled with a dazzling, golden light.</p><p>Lu Ye waited for the light to subside before looking into the chest. There, several Golden Amulets entered his vision.</p><p>He took them out one by one, and there were exactly nine of them in total.</p><p>Counting the two Golden Amulets that he had, now, he had a total of 11 of them with this addition.</p><p>He still had Amulets of other qualities as well‚Ä¶</p><p>For a Third Order Cloud River Realm cultivator to have so many Amulets was simply unheard of. Since ancient times, no single cultivator from Jiu Zhou had ever been in possession of so many Amulets at once and at such a low cultivation level.</p><p>If it wasn‚Äôt for the rewards from the Roster of Carnage, Lu Ye wouldn‚Äôt have been able to achieve such a feat either. Mainly, it was the Glyph: Fire Phoenix he used at the end that killed a large number of the Thousand Demon Ridge‚Äôs cultivators, allowing him to ascend into the top position of the Roster of Carnage.</p><p>With so many Amulets in hand, Lu Ye estimated that if he were to use all of them, it wouldn‚Äôt be too hard for him to reach the Fifth Order Cloud River Realm.</p><p>Of course, not all of these nine Golden Amulets belonged to him. He still had to split them with Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan later, so he could only have three of them.</p><p>After putting the Amulets away, Lu Ye looked to the smaller chest.</p><p>The large chest contained the Golden Amulets, so the small chest should contain the legendary Primus-level Wisp of Sanctification.</p><p>Even though Lu Ye had a Tertius-level Arcane Glade at some point, he had never seen what the Wisp of Sanctification actually looked like.</p><p>He raised his hand to open the small chest, but nothing unusual happened. When he looked down, however, a frown formed on his brow.</p><p>There in the chest lay a white and chubby thing like a chrysalis. It was the length of a palm and seemed to be alive, and that was because Lu Ye could sense that it was breathing, and following its breaths, its body appeared solid at times, and illusory at others.</p><p>[So this is a Primus-level Wisp of Sanctification?]</p><p>It was not what he expected‚Ä¶</p><p>But since it was a gift from the Heavens, it had to be real.</p><p>It was said that if one possessed this thing, then no matter where one was in the Cloud River Battlefield, one could use it to create a Primus-level Spirit Spout, which in turn gave birth to a Primus-level Arcane Glade.</p><p>However, it was only limited to the Cloud River Battlefield. For a Spirit Spout to give rise to an Arcane Glade was something unique to the Cloud River Battlefield, and such a thing did not exist anywhere else. So, the Wisp of Sanctification could only work in the Cloud River Battlefield.</p><p>Lu Ye grabbed the fat white Wisp of Sanctification, which felt unexpectedly nice in his hand.</p><p>But how should he store this thing? It seemed to be a living thing, so he wondered whether anything would go wrong if he were to just keep it in his Storage Bag.</p><p>After some thought, Lu Ye looked at the small chest in front of him and put the Wisp of Sanctification back before picking up the chest.</p><p>This chest was also a gift from the Heavens. Though he had no idea what material was used to make it, it had to be good stuff, so he brought it along with him. Maybe he could use it to store something else in the future.</p><p>To his surprise, no matter how much strength he used, he couldn‚Äôt get the chest to budge. When he tried to move the larger chest next to it, it was the same.</p><p>The chest couldn‚Äôt be taken away! Wasn‚Äôt this too stingy of the Heavens?</p><p>Left with no other choice, Lu Ye took out a Spirit Beast Bag and put the Wisp of Sanctification into it.</p><p>Storage Bags couldn‚Äôt contain living things, but it was no problem for the Spirit Beast Bag.</p><p>After collecting the wards from the Roster of Carnage, Lu Ye moved his mind and left the Vault of Providence.</p><p>When he came back to his senses, he stood before the Divine Opportunity Column with disciples surrounding him, all of them bowing when they saw him open his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ye responded to their greetings and gave them a few words of encouragement before returning back to the Crimson Blood Sect through the Divine Opportunity Column.</p><p>Upon sensing Lu Ye‚Äôs return, Amber scurried in from the outside and nudged him with its large head.</p><p>‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Yi Yi?‚Äù Lu Ye asked.</p><p>Amber raised its head and gestured in a direction, which told Lu Ye that Yi Yi was cultivating with the Sect Master.</p><p>Yi Yi was a Spell Cultivator, and so was the Sect Master, so it naturally made it easy for her to receive guidance from him. Compared to Lu Ye, Yi Yi was more like the Sect Master‚Äôs final disciple.</p><p>Rather than disturb them, Lu Ye went straight towards Shui Yuan‚Äôs residence.</p><p>When he found Shui Yuan, he took out all the materials he brought from outside, which Shui Yuan was so shocked to see that she could hardly speak. ‚ÄúAgain? So many?‚Äù</p><p>The scene in front of her seemed familiar. Just a few months ago, Lu Ye had brought in such a huge amount of supplies, but she didn‚Äôt think that he would bring another batch back in just a short few months.</p><p>When Lu Ye entered the Spirit Creek Battlefield, he said that he was going to get revenge. But now, rather than revenge, it seemed more like he was going to stock up on resources.</p><p>She wondered just how the Thousand Demon Ridge was feeling after being extorted by the same guy twice. freewebnove‚Ñì.com</p><p>‚ÄúSenior Sister, things will get better and better for us in the future, so no need to be stingy with your cultivation needs. You and Sect Master are the only two Divine Ocean Realm Masters in the sect, and the Sect Master is growing old so there are things that he can no longer keep up with. In the future, you‚Äôll have to watch after the sect more.‚Äù</p><p>Shui Yuan nodded. ‚ÄúI understand. Instead of me, you‚Äôve worked hard out there.‚Äù</p><p>Even though she had no idea what Lu Ye had done to make the Thousand Demon Ridge compromise, if she didn‚Äôt guess wrong, then some fights and killings had to be involved. Otherwise, unless such a large faction was forced to a point of desperation, how could they possibly be willing to compromise?</p><p>‚ÄúTake your time organizing the resources, Senior Sister. I‚Äôll be taking my leave.‚Äù</p><p>Saying so, Lu Ye took out his Spirit Artifact and took to the skies, flying towards the Summit of Bamboos.</p><p>Looking at the mountain of resources in front of her, Shui Yuan laughed and shook her head. It was going to be another busy but fulfilling day, and the sect‚Äôs storage was going to be filled to the point of overflowing.</p><p>In the sleeping chambers of the Summit of Bamboos, Lu Ye divided the Amulets in his hands into two sets. One set with six Golden Amulets was for Li Baxian and Feng Yuechan.</p><p>UpdatùìÆd from freewƒìbnove‚Ñì.com.</p><p>There was another set of five Golden Amulets, one purple one, a blue one, two green ones, as well as four white ones. Other than the Golden Amulets, most of these came to him as spoils of war from when he slaughtered his enemies in the Carnage Colosseum, but there were also those he got from opening Amulet Caskets.</p><p>He didn‚Äôt rush to use these Amulets, however, since Yi Ye was not around.</p><p>Once Yi Ye was free, they could cultivate together to increase their strength.</p><p>He continued taking out various flames for the Tree of Glyphs‚Äô consumption, and as time passed, the leaves on the Tree of Glyphs burned one by one.</p><p>Lu Ye didn‚Äôt stop until only thirty Flames of Earthen Spirits were left in his possession.</p><p>He had to keep some behind for unexpected situations, just in case the Tree of Glyphs ever ran out of fuel again.</p><p>Then, he began checking the Glyphs on the leaves.</p><p>As before, most of the leaves did not carry complete Glyphs, but rather special connection techniques that were very useful to Lu Ye. They could be considered the basis and foundation for his advancement in the Way of Glyphs. Otherwise, it would be impossible for him to master the construction of Glyphs without knowing how to connect them.</p><p>Glyphs could be used alone or with the help of Wards. If a Glyph were activated through a ward, then these connection techniques will have to be used. Strictly speaking, Glyphs and Wards were complementary to each other.</p><p>It took Lu Ye almost three hours to finish inspecting all the burning leaves.</p><p>There were four new Glyphs in total.</p><p>Moreover, each Glyph was more complex than the previous ones as they were carried on not just a single leaf.</p><p>For example, Lu Ye‚Äôs first Glyphs, Protection and Sharp Edge, were both basic Glyphs that were not complicated to construct. A single leaf was enough to carry all their information.</p><p>However, there were some complicated Glyphs that couldn‚Äôt be contained in just one leaf. For example, Glyph: Space was carried by several dozen leaves, and Glyph: Fire Phoenix was even more ridiculous. The outline of the leaves that carried it looked just like a Fire Phoenix crouching on the Tree of Glyphs when linked together.</p><p>The more difficult the Glyphs, the more leaves it had to be carried on.</p><p>This time, he had received three types of Glyphs, split into leaves as few as three or four to as many as seven to eight.</p><p>This meant that these were much more difficult to construct than basic Glyphs like Protection and Sharp Edge.</p><p>Trapped Beast.</p><p>Mist Shroud.</p><p>Mirage.</p><p>Aerial Lock.</p><p>These were the four new Glyphs he obtained.</p><p>Lu Ye had seen every type of these Glyphs in books before. Of them, he had used Glyph: Trapped Beast in the Carnage Colosseum before. Other than Glyph: Void, this was another practical Glyph that he learnt from a book that was used during fights.</p><p>The Trap Ward he set up before was based with Glyph: Trapped Beast at its core. In the Carnage Colosseum, he was able to escape the pursuit twice from Ninth Order Cloud River Realm Experts, so the role that this Glyph played was self-evident.</p><p>However, that was something that he learned from a book. Compared to that which was inspired by the Tree of Glyphs, it was different for Lu Ye.</p><p>The Glyphs he taught himself carried a risk of failure and were not very efficient, but the Glyphs on the Tree of Glyphs could be activated at will, and setting up a Trap Ward with such a Glyph would also be more efficient.</p><p>Glyph: Mist Shroud was as its name suggested. It could create a shroud of mist and the more energy that was poured into it, the denser the mist.</p><p>This Glyph was used specifically for Wards. A confusion Ward was set up finely enough and supplemented by other techniques, then it could be used to effectively confuse an enemy.</p><p>Glyph: Mirage was similar to Glyph: Mist Shroud, but rather than create mist, it created an illusion to confuse reality and falsehood. Similarly, this Glyph can also be used as the core of a Ward to set up a Mirage Ward.</p><p>If Mist Shroud and Mirage were to be combined, then it would truly become a proper Illusion Ward.</p><p>As for Aerial Lock, it was also as its name suggested. It had the ability to prohibit flight in the air, and if used as the core of a Ward, it would become an Aerial Lock ward.</p><p>These four Glyphs didn‚Äôt improve Lu Ye‚Äôs own strength much, but it offered him more choices in the Way of Wards.</p><p>Lu Ye couldn‚Äôt help but get a strange feeling rising up in him. He had gained four Glyphs from the Tree of Glyphs last time, but he ended up going farther and farther down the path of a Spell Cultivator.</p><p>This time, with the four new Glyphs he received, he was going farther and farther down the path of a Ward Cultivator.</p><p>He wondered what else he would get next time.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
