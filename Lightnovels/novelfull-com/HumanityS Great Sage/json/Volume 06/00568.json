After that, he was surrounded and attacked by everyone, and eventually, he had to resort to using the Broken Arrow regardless of anything. At this moment, he was truly a lamp that had run out of oil.</p><p>His vision blurred, and as he looked up, he could only see Lu Ye’s figure descending from the sky, but he couldn’t make out his expression.</p><p>The gleaming blade flashed past, and the Inviolable Saber effortlessly broke through Wei Que’s weak defense of Spiritual Power, slicing his neck.</p><p>When they passed each other, Lu Ye’s feet skidded across the ground for at least 30 meters before he managed to gradually gain his footing.</p><p>That sense of crisis that had been latching onto his back disappeared at the same time as when he made that slash. After all, the Broken Arrow was controlled by Wei Que, and once he died, the treasure lost its power, its radiance faded, and it returned to its original appearance before falling from the air.</p><p>Lu Ye let out a long sigh before looking back, only to see Wei Que’s headless corpse falling to the ground, blood gushing from his neck.</p><p>He and Li Baxian managed to kill a Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivator together!</p><p>The Illusion Ward had to be given great credit for this achievement. Under its entrapment, Wei Que was simply unable to resist the joint attack of Lu Ye and the others.</p><p>It should be noted that Lu Ye and his group had struggled greatly even against a Seventh Order cultivator like He Bing back in the Carnage Colosseum. In the end, Lu Ye had to go as far as to unleash his Beast Form Secret Technique to kill him.</p><p>Even though the difference between the Seventh and Ninth Order were only two Minor Realms, their strengths were worlds apart. Even with Lu Ye’s advancements in cultivation within the Carnage Colosseum and the addition of Ju Jia, without the Illusion Ward, the four of them wouldn’t have been a match for Wei Que. The best they could hope for was to be defeated one by one.</p><p>The disappearance of Wei Que’s vitality shocked Tan Sheng and Xia Liang, who were still entangled with the wolf pack. Neither of them had expected that Wei Que, a Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivator, would be killed by Yi Ye and his party.</p><p>At this moment, both of them were in a pitiful state. They were covered in wounds, and their clothes were stained with blood. Even though they were extremely powerful, they were still overwhelmed by having to deal with an entire pack of Mutant Wolves.</p><p>If it were not for the wolf pack acting wary and not daring to press them too much, the two of them would probably have lost their lives long ago. Even so, they were both severely injured and out of breath.</p><p>Almost at the very same moment that Wei Que died, Xia Liang suddenly let out a roar, and a stunning Blade Light bloomed from his saber as he swung it forward with all his might.</p><p>With the descent of this strike, the already crumbling Trap Ward finally could hold on no longer and shattered with a bang.</p><p>When they saw the difficult situation that Wei Que fell into, both Xia Liang and Tan Sheng knew that it would be difficult for them to kill Yi Ye this time, so they had been trying to find a way to escape. Once one was caught in a Trap Ward, the only way to escape was by destroying the Ward.</p><p>Under their attacks, the aftershocks of the battle leeched out into their surroundings time and time again.</p><p>After all, no one was maintaining the Ward. Even with its considerable strength, it still wasn’t Heaven-defying by any means. Bit by bit, it was worn down until Xia Liang unleashed an Earth-shattering strike that finally destroyed the Trap Ward.</p><p>“Let’s go!” Xia Liang shouted and swiftly rushed out while Tan Sheng followed closely behind him. Even though Wei Que had died right before their eyes, neither of them had any intention of seeking revenge for him.</p><p>They were only in a cooperative relationship to begin with. It was Wei Que’s own carelessness and stupidity that resulted in him being killed by a few Fourth to Fifth Order Cloud River Realm.</p><p>Furthermore, they were in a precarious situation themselves. If they didn’t escape, even they would be buried here.</p><p>Two figures rushed out in succession, accompanied by wolf howls. Light blue wind blades were launched towards the two of them, giving Xia Liang and Tan Sheng trouble on both sides, adding onto their injuries.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Wolf Mutants couldn’t fly, so if the two of them wanted to escape, the Wolf Mutant wouldn’t be able to stop them.</p><p>Lu Ye had only just calmed down the surging Spiritual Power within himself after cutting down Wei Que and hadn’t the time to bother with Tan Sheng and Xia Liang when he saw the two of them destroy the Trap Ward and escape.</p><p>He immediately gave chase.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, he wouldn’t even consider pursuing two Ninth Order cultivators. That would be no different from seeking death.</p><p>However, both Tan Sheng and Xia Liang were severely injured right now, which would make it hard for them to exert their full strength. It was a perfect opportunity to finish them off. Otherwise, once they were given the chance to recover, killing them would be as difficult as ascending to the Heavens.</p><p>Seeing this, Li Baxian quickly brandished his sword and followed. At the same time, he shouted, “Yuechan, stay here and take care of Junior Brother Ju Jia!”</p><p>When Ju Jia got injured by the Broken Arrow before, though he had thick skin and a strong body, as well as powerful recovery abilities as a Body-tempering Cultivator, the arrow still penetrated through his body. Moreover, he had been kneeling on the ground ever since, so it was unclear how severe his injuries were.</p><p>He and Lu Ye were enough to handle the task of chasing them down. If they could kill them, then the two of them should be able to do it. Otherwise, even having Feng Yuechan with them would not change the situation.</p><p>Feng Yuechan paused when she heard that, then she watched as Lu Ye and Li Baxian turned into streaks of light and chased them out of the Arcane Glade, deep into the Grand Wilds Peak.</p><p>Under the pack leader’s guidance, the group of Wolf Mutants followed Lu Ye, obviously to back him up, but the Wolf Mutants returned again after an hour.</p><p>Their inability to fly was an impediment. Even though they could run through the mountains and fields at great speed, it was still slower than flying with telekinetic techniques. After chasing for a while, they lost sight of Lu Ye and their targets, so the Wolf Mutants had no choice but to return.</p><p>Feng Yuechan had finished bandaging Ju Jia’s wounds by then. Ju Jia’s injuries looked terrifying, but they were not anything serious. It would only take a day or two of rest for him to recover.</p><p>Feng Yuechan didn’t know how Li Baxian and Lu Ye were doing, so she tried to send them a message, but as there was no response, she could only wait silently.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Ye and Li Baxian had already been chasing them for hundreds of kilometers, but Tan Sheng and Xia Liang never showed any signs of stopping. They continued fleeing desperately forward as blood constantly dripped from their bodies, which made Lu Ye more certain that the two of them were in a bad state.</p><p>Otherwise, there was no reason for two Ninth Order cultivators to appear so battered and exhausted.</p><p>Thinking back to the time in the Carnage Colosseum, Lu Ye was chased till he had nowhere to run, but in less than two months, the situation had completely reversed. Truly, fortune flows thirty years on the east side of the river and thirty years on the west side of the river in an ever-changing loop.</p><p>While fleeing, Tan Sheng roared, “Yi Ye, just stop now. There is no good in this for anyone if you continue!”</p><p>This place was deep within the Grand Wilds Peak, where many powerful Spirit Beasts lurked. Even on ordinary days, cultivators who entered would do so secretly, not daring to cause too much of a commotion for fear of alerting any of them.</p><p>The commotion caused by the group during their chase and escape was quite significant. If they truly alarmed some powerful Spirit Beasts, it would not only result in a bad outcome for Tan Sheng and Xia Liang but also for Lu Ye and Li Baxian.</p><p>Therefore, the best approach was for Lu Ye to stop and allow them to escape.</p><p>However, Lu Ye was unmoved despite Tan Sheng’s persuasion.</p><p>If they missed this rare opportunity, they would never be able to kill these two in the Cloud River Battlefield again in the future. Both of them were Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivators who could ascend to the Real Lake Realm at any time. Once they ascended, they would certainly have to leave the Cloud River Battlefield.</p><p>The bitter memories of being chased by them in the Carnage Colosseum was fresh in Lu Ye’s mind. Moreover, they had found the Arcane Glade, so if they didn’t eradicate them completely this time, the location of the Arcane Glade would definitely be exposed, which might bring trouble in the future.</p><p>Since Wei Que was already dead, as long as he could kill these two, they could at least stop the existence of the Arcane Glade from being exposed.</p><p>Lu Ye’s was resolute in his killing intent, so for could he be swayed by a few words?</p><p>Moreover, the more Tan Sheng said so, the more it revealed how dire their situation was. Otherwise, they would have simply stopped and fought.</p><p>“Yi Ye, must you insist on fighting to the death with us?” Tan Sheng shouted once again.</p><p>Lu Ye remained silent, but Li Baxian snorted instead, “If you have the ability, come and fight us. Let’s see if it’s you who dies or if it’s us martial brothers who perish!”</p><p>Tan Sheng almost ground his teeth down in bitterness at that. Both he and Xia Liang were Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivators. Though they didn’t dare claim to be invincible in the Cloud River Battlefield, they were still among the top powerhouses at the very least. When had they ever been chased to such a miserable point by two Cloud River Fourth or Fifth Order cultivators before?</p><p>There was probably no one who would believe such a thing even if rumors went out about their situation.</p><p>However, such a bizarre situation was happening to them right now, so how could they not feel angry and frustrated?</p><p>If it weren’t for their severe injuries, would Yi Ye and Li Baxian dare to act so arrogantly in front of them?</p><p>The injuries they sustained from the battle with the wolf pack were too severe, causing both of them to be unable to unleash even thirty percent of their usual strength. Now, they couldn’t even shake their enemies off their tails.</p><p>Not only that, their situation continued to worsen as time went on, and the speed of their telekinetic techniques also slowed down.</p><p>If this went on, it was only a matter of time before Yi Ye and Li Baxian caught up with them.</p><p>“Brother Xia!” Tan Sheng turned his head to Xia Liang next to him, where he noticed the powerful Blade Cultivator from the Raving Bladesmen looking pale-faced and his aura in disarray, but his eyes remained as sharp as a blade.</p><p>During the previous struggle with the wolf pack, Xia Liang had suffered more severe injuries than Tan Sheng since he exerted more strength than he did. As a result, the wolf pack focused more on Xia Liang, which placed most of the pressure on him.</p><p>Facing Tan Sheng’s inquiry, Xia Liang coldly uttered two words, “We’ll fight!”</p><p>Escaping was no longer an option. If they continued like this, their condition would only worsen, and when they were completely exhausted, they would likely no longer be in any condition to fight.</p><p>While they still had the strength to fight, perhaps there was a chance they could kill those two. After all, they were just Cloud River Fourth or Fifth Order cultivators.</p><p>Tan Sheng knew that this wasn’t the best strategy, but they had no better option. He nodded slightly. “In that case, fight it is!”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the two of them flew straight down, landing one after another in just a moment.</p><p>Given their current condition, it was not suitable for them to engage in aerial combat as it would consume even more energy. Therefore, fighting on the ground was the best choice.</p><p>After the two landed, Lu Ye and Li Baxian followed closely, stopping less than a few hundred meters away from them.</p><p>Sparks seemed to fly as the gazes of the four collided across the distance, and the atmosphere in the mountains suddenly became filled with solemnity and killing intent.</p><p>Li Baxian grabbed the wine gourd at his waist and took a casual sip before asking, “Little Junior Brother, which one will you choose?”</p><p>Lu Ye’s gaze locked onto Xia Liang, and he slowly stepped forward, walking towards the front.</p><p>Li Baxian nodded. “Then I’ll take the remaining one.” As he spoke, he opened his mouth and spat out more than ten Flying Swords that were all aiming straight for Tan Sheng.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
