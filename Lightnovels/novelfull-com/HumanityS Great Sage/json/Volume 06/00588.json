In just an instant, he positioned himself in front of the Fox Mutant, and threw a punch at Lu Ye.</p><p>Lu Ye leapt away, narrowly avoiding the attack while his shock escalated!</p><p>In just a brief moment, Ju Jia had actually fallen under the Fox Mutant’s control!</p><p>What kind of heaven-defying technique was this?</p><p>Lu Ye didn’t understand how the Fox Mutant controlled someone’s mind. He could only speculate that it was her innate talent, but according to the information he possessed, the Fox Mutant had to have direct contact with someone in order to achieve this.</p><p>When he feigned unconsciousness and was brought back to Fox Immortal Valley, the Fox Mutant had touched his forehead and with her hand, then used the Secret Technique.</p><p>Never did he imagine that the Fox Mutant could use this Secret Technique even without direct contact.</p><p>Moreover, Ju Jia had accompanied him deep into the Pool of Divine Purification and underwent the tempering of their Divine Souls there. Even though the benefits he received were not as great as his own, his Divine Soul was still much tougher than other cultivators of the same level. Even so, he was still enslaved with a single glance from the Fox Mutant. Her ability had far surpassed Lu Ye’s imagination.</p><p>His trusted ally suddenly stood against him, leaving Lu Ye at a loss.</p><p>But what puzzled Lu Ye even more was how the Fox Mutant could still survive after taking such a stab from him.</p><p>He had stabbed her directly through the heart, and at the same time, his blade was enhanced by Glyph: Burster, so there was no reason for the Fox Mutant to survive.</p><p>However, despite how weak her aura had become, like a flame in the wind, she was still alive!</p><p>After driving Lu Ye back with a punch, Ju Jia swiftly turned around, grabbed the Fox Mutant who was still coughing up blood from her mouth, and jumped up into the sky, heading towards the depths of the Grand Wilds Peak.</p><p>[Not good!]</p><p>If he allowed Ju Jia to take the Fox Mutant away, all the plans and preparations he made for today would be in vain.</p><p>Lu Ye had waited in Fox Immortal Valley for so long before he could finally seize this opportunity. If he missed it, there would be no other chance.</p><p>Furthermore, he had already been exposed today. If Ju Jia took the Fox Mutant away, he might never be able to find them again!</p><p>Just as Lu Ye was thinking this, a delicate figure suddenly appeared in front of Ju Jia. It was Yi Yi, who had been hiding nearby.</p><p>At this moment, Yi Yi rushed towards Ju Jia and blasted out several spell techniques from her hand. Ju Jia didn’t dodge or evade them, but forcibly took on the spells with his body, causing sparks to scatter in the air. With one arm holding the heavily wounded Fox Mutant and the other clenched into a fist, he launched a merciless punch at Yi Yi.</p><p>Lu Ye’s heart tightened as he watched.</p><p>But at that moment, the Nine Wards Scroll appeared in Yi Yi’s hand, swelling in the wind and transforming into a towering curtain that covered the sky, enveloping Ju Jia.</p><p>Caught off guard, Ju Jia’s first struck into the Ward Scroll, and as if he were hitting an invisible space, his entire arm was swallowed up into it.</p><p>Ju Jia tried to retreat, but Lu Ye had rushed over and delivered a powerful kick to his back, which made a dull sound as if he had kicked a piece of metal, but the force sent him straight into the Nine Wards Scroll.</p><p>In the picture, amidst the scene of a chaotic stone forest, two more figures suddenly appeared.</p><p>“Well done!” Lu Ye praised. Following closely behind Ju Jia, he dived into the Nine Wards Scroll.</p><p>Inside the Nine Wards Scroll, the gloomy sky resembled thick cotton that was pressing down on one’s chest, making it hard to breathe. Strange whirlpools slowly turned in the sky, and the entire world seemed to fill one with a sense of dread.</p><p>This was not a real world to begin with, just a space within the Nine Wards Scroll.</p><p>Ju Jia was still holding the Fox Mutant as he stood silently under a stone pillar, glaring fiercely at Lu Ye, who had come to pursue them. The expression on Ju Jia’s face felt distant to Lu Ye.</p><p>Fox Mutant continued to bleed with an unprecedented look of panic on her face. Compared to her own miserable situation, what shocked her the most was Lu Ye’s sudden betrayal.</p><p>She never imagined that one of her enslaved cultivators would come to betray her one day, and to cause her such immense pain.</p><p>They stood several tens of meters apart, with neither Ju Jia nor Lu Ye making a move.</p><p>Although Ju Jia’s cultivation level was on par with his, nobody could be more clear than Lu Ye just how strong and sturdy Ju Jia’s physique was.</p><p>If they were to fight it out in a life or death battle here, he could indeed defeat Ju Jia, but he would not come out of it in a good shape.</p><p>However, with Ju Jia currently under influence, unless he dealt with him, Lu Ye would not be able to harm the Fox Mutant in any way, which was truly a headache-inducing situation.</p><p>“Who are you really?!” Fox Mutant shouted through gritted teeth.</p><p>Lu Ye glanced at her calmly, his eyes still as if he were looking at a dead person.</p><p>After entering the Nine Wards Scroll, the Fox Mutant’s fate was sealed. What he needed to consider now was how to bypass Ju Jia and kill her.</p><p>“You were never affected by my Secret Technique, were you?” the Fox Mutant asked, finally understanding some of what happened at this moment.</p><p>Today’s encounter was definitely not a coincidence but a carefully planned scheme by Lu Ye. Taking advantage of the distraction after the battle with the Berserk Giant Ape in Fox Immortal Valley, Lu Ye struck without warning, catching her off guard.</p><p>Just then, Yi Yi’s voice was suddenly transmitted into Lu Ye’s ears. “Lu Ye, do you want me to send some Wolf Mutants in to support you?”</p><p>“No!” Lu Ye quickly refused.</p><p>If he didn’t know that the Fox Mutant had the ability to control the minds of others from a distance, then it would be fine, but now that he knew, he absolutely could not let anyone or any Spirit Beast enter the Nine Wards Scroll. Otherwise, they would not only be of no help but would also make the situation worse.</p><p>Even Ju Jia could not resist the Secret Technique, so much less the Wolf Mutants. If they were sent in, they would only become the Fox Mutant’s helpers.</p><p>So in this battle today, there was only him!</p><p>Other than Yi Yi, he couldn’t rely on any external forces.</p><p>“I’ll just have to play it by ear!” Lu Ye muttered under his breath and slightly arched his body with the Inviolable Saber held upright in front of him. He stared intently at Ju Jia, then assumed an attacking stance.</p><p>In the next instant, the dust stirred under his feet. With a boost from Glyph: Windwalk, his figure dashed forward like lightning. In the blink of an eye, he reached Ju Jia, and his flaming saber cleaved down fiercely at the Fox Mutant in Ju Jia’s arms.</p><p>Ju Jia raised his right arm, and a brilliant light emerged on it, forming a protective barrier.</p><p>The saber cut down on it, emitting a clang. The force of the impact threw Lu Ye back slightly, but there was only a slight ripple on the protective barrier on Ju Jia’s arm.</p><p>Then, the Inviolable Saber fell once again, merciless as ever as it aimed at the Fox Mutant.</p><p>The Fox Mutant’s pupils contracted. During Lu Ye’s time in Fox Immortal Valley, his role was always that of a Ward Cultivator. The Fox Mutant’s understanding of him was limited to his remarkable attainments in the Way of a Wards. This time, Lu Ye’s arrangement of the various Wards played a significant role in their successful slaying of the Berserk Giant Ape in Fox Immortal Valley.</p><p>But the Fox Mutant never could have expected that this Ward Cultivator that she relied on could actually unleash such power!</p><p>Lu Ye was only in the Fourth Order, yet his strength far surpassed those in the Sixth or Seventh Orders in the valley.</p><p>What surprised her even more was Ju Jia’s performance.</p><p>Enslaving Ju Jia was only a desperate move, but she never imagined that this burly man with the same cultivation level as Lu Ye that she had only seen for the first time would also display such outstanding abilities.</p><p>These two… Where did these monsters come from?</p><p>Had she unknowingly enslaved an extraordinary person?</p><p>Just as the Fox Mutant’s mind wavered, Lu Ye and Ju Jia had already clashed more than ten times. Each time, Lu Ye swung his saber with his unrestrained full strength, but every single strike was completely blocked by Ju Jia.</p><p>Despite knowing early on that Ju Jia had a powerful physique and formidable defense, it was only when he truly fought him that he could truly experience the terrifying strength of that defense.</p><p>Though Ju Jia remained uninjured, he was still left looking miserable under Lu Ye’s relentless onslaught. Firstly, he was defending passively, and secondly, he had to reserve some of his strength to protect the Fox Mutant in his arms.</p><p>Even if he were unhindered and could fight Lu Ye with all his might, he might not necessarily be a match for him, let alone in this current situation.</p><p>Under the relentless barrage, Ju Jia’s figure kept backing up, while Lu Ye was moving closer with each strike, the pressure emanating from him growing ever stronger.</p><p>The Fox Mutant could tell that the situation wasn’t optimistic and suddenly looked at Lu Ye, her beautiful eyes immediately turning into an abyss and the bizarre fluctuations of her power surging once again.</p><p>Even though she guessed that Lu Ye was unlikely to be affected by her Secret Technique, the Fox Mutant still couldn’t resist the urge to test it.</p><p>The strange power invaded Lu Ye’s mind, and a faint haze immediately rose over his talents.</p><p>The brilliance in the Fox Mutant’s eyes dimmed slightly. Sure enough… This guy indeed had absolute resistance against her Secret Technique, but she couldn’t understand how someone in the Fourth Order Cloud River Realm could resist it.</p><p>No matter how strong his mind was, there was no reason for him not to be affected by her Secret Technique.</p><p>Another strike descended, and as the saber fell, a flash of brilliance flashed through the Inviolable Saber. Glyph: Gravity Well was activated!</p><p>Ju Jia raised his arm to block the strike, and in an instant, his body stooped, feeling an immense force pressing down on him. He let out a furious roar as a surge of violent power erupted from his body, trying to resist the oppressive force.</p><p>However, in the next moment, Glyph: Gravity Well suddenly vanished without a trace.</p><p>Caught off guard by the sudden change, Ju Jia could not react in time, and a gap had appeared in the previously impregnable defense. Even his figure stumbled.</p><p>Lu Ye retracted his blade and stabbed it directly towards the Fox Mutant’s head.</p><p>Fear appeared on the Fox Mutant’s pale face, and her beautiful eyes reflected the fiery gleam of the blade that was rapidly enlarging in her field of vision.</p><p>However, this strike ultimately failed to take her life. At a critical moment, Ju Jia grabbed the Inviolable Saber, allowing the sharp blade to cut into his hand. Bleeding out, he still gritted his teeth and refused to let go.</p><p>Lu Ye’s eye twitched, and he leapt up, kicking out to create distance from Ju Jia with the rebounding force.</p><p>*Pu…* The Fox Mutant coughed up blood, her pale face losing all color.</p><p>Even though she had been protected by Ju Jia and not directly harmed by Lu Ye, the fierce clashes between Lu Ye and Ju Jia had been incredibly violent. Even with Ju Jia’s best efforts to protect her, she still received a considerable shock.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, such shocks would not have affected her much. However, she had already been injured by the Berserk Giant Ape before she was then ambushed by Lu Ye, and now in her heavily wounded state, the repeated impacts from their clashes made her extremely uncomfortable.</p><p>Ju Jia clearly noticed this as well and looked down at the Fox Mutant in his arms, his eyes filled with worry.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
