Lu Ye shouldn’t be a match for any of them, but after a gruesome fight, one of them was dead and the other was heavily injured. Lu Ye couldn’t help but feel in awe at receiving the Heavens’ favor.</p><p>He took out an empty water skin to keep the beast blood in, then quickly extracted the Mutant Cores of the two Spirit Beasts.</p><p>Both Mutant Cores were large in size. The Thunderhawk’s mutant core was covered in threads of thunder energy whilst the Venomous Python’s Mutant Core presented in an emerald sheen. One could tell at a glance that its toxicity was not low.</p><p>After all, this was where the essence of these Spirit Beasts’ cultivation was located, and they matched perfectly with their own attributes.</p><p>He could feed the Thunderhawk’s Mutant Core to Amber, whereas the Venomous Python’s Mutant Core could be kept away for Hua Ci, which she was sure to like.</p><p>Then, Lu Ye retrieved some other materials that he felt would be worth something, such as the Thunderhawk’s claws, beak, and wings. Then, he skinned the Venomous Python and put everything into his Storage Sphere before leaving in satisfaction.</p><p>The flesh of Spirit Beasts was very nutritious, and Body-tempering Cultivator would ingest large amounts of it practically every day. That was because that was the only way that they could strengthen their own vitality. So, no matter what, there was no shortage of demand for Spirit Beast meat.</p><p>What was more, snake meat was a favorite treat for both Lu Ye and Amber. Ever since trying it for the first time, he had been hooked on the flavor. Now that such a rare opportunity had come about, Lu Ye naturally wouldn’t miss it.</p><p>As he moved away, the noise gradually disappeared behind him. Lu Ye found a secluded place and set up a Ward before waiting in rest.</p><p>Time passed, and the figures of cultivators and Spirit Beasts would pass him by overhead from time to time, and it wasn’t until dawn that the chaos completely subsided.</p><p>Lu Ye sent out a message to Ju Jia, telling him to come and join up with him.</p><p>On top of the Spirit Peak, Ju Jia’s tall figure stood up.</p><p>Many giant wolves gathered around him in all directions, many of which were staring at him, especially the leader, whose fur was snow white all around its body and appeared stronger than the rest of its race. It was standing just ten meters away from Ju Jia, looking down at him with its head slightly lowered, its wolf eyes filled with puzzlement.</p><p>Many of the giant wolves had gotten injured during the bloody battle that went on through the night, and they were now silently licking their own wounds while some of the others dragged the corpses of other Spirit Beasts over to feast on with their companions, covering their maws with blood as they devoured the meat.</p><p>The wolf pack was very close-knit. No matter how many other Spirit Beasts arrived, they would all work together to repel them, and that was the main reason why they were able to dominate this Spirit Peak in these recent days.</p><p>At this moment, however, the person they regarded as a sacred figure not only came to life, but it seemed like he was going to leave. How could the wolves accept that?</p><p>They had been here for less than two months and had personally experienced the benefits that this sacred figure had brought to their pack.</p><p>As a mountain breeze blew past, Ju Jia had a helpless expression as he faced the wolves.</p><p>He had not realized how much excitement was going on around him all this while. After he was jolted by Lu Ye’s message last night, the chaos around him left him bewildered. Fortunately, however, he knew then that things were not good, so he didn’t dare to move recklessly either and just waited in place. With the protection of the wolf pack, none of the other Spirit Beasts or the other cultivators could even hope to get close to this Spirit Peak.</p><p>Now that he had received Lu Ye’s message, who was nearby, it was time to meet up with him.</p><p>However, the pack leader seemed unwilling to let him go. Even without direct communication, Ju Jia could sense what it was thinking.</p><p>They looked at each other for a long time before Ju Jia squeezed out in a sullen voice, “Lu Ye is looking for me!”</p><p>The pack leader cocked its head to the side, looking as if it did not understand him.</p><p>Even if its abilities were equivalent to the Ninth Order Cloud River Realm, and even if it gained some semblance of human intelligence, these Spirit Beasts resided deep inside the mountain forests, so how could they understand the language of humans?</p><p>Thus began Ju Jia’s mission. He walked forward and pushed the pack leader with his hands. “Don’t block the way.”</p><p>With a casual shove, he pushed the pack leader, which was even larger than him, a few steps back. Passing by the pack leader, Ju Jia walked straight ahead.</p><p>The giant wolves around, whether they were recuperating or feasting on meat, all rose to their feet, feeling at a loss as they watched the tall figure departing. The sacred figure of their pack was going to leave? How could this happen?</p><p>A wolf howl rang out, and the pack leader stepped forward to catch up with Ju Jia. It lowered its head and gently nudged his back, lifting him up. Ju Jia soared into the air, and as he descended, he landed on the pack leader’s back, all steady and secure.</p><p>Stopping the sacred figure from leaving seemed unfeasible. In that case, they would just follow him!</p><p>Understanding the pack leader’s intentions, Ju Jia didn’t refuse but pointed in a direction instead. “That way.”</p><p>The pack leader picked up its pace, maneuvering nimbly through the mountain forest.</p><p>Behind it, a large group of giant wolves followed in an impressive formation, causing the earth to shake as they passed.</p><p>Less than a dozen kilometers away, where Lu Ye was hiding. He had released Amber from the Spirit Beast Bag while Yi Yi was lurking nearby, vigilant.</p><p>After an incense stick of time, Lu Ye suddenly sensed something unusual. He quickly pressed his hand onto the ground, then his brows furrowed.</p><p>He could sense movement in the ground as if many Spirit Beasts were galloping about, and the magnitude of the sensations indicated that there were a great number of them.</p><p>Moreover, judging by the vibrations, they appeared to be getting closer. This was a dangerous place, and staying any longer wouldn’t be wise.</p><p>Right at that moment, a message came to his Battlefield Imprint. When Lu Ye checked it, he found it to be a transmission from Yi Yi.</p><p>“Lu Ye, Lu Ye! Ju Jia brought a lot of giant wolves with him!”</p><p>For a moment, Lu Ye could not process what was being said in the message. [What does she mean, Ju Jia brought a lot of giant wolves with him?]</p><p>As he was going to ask for an explanation, the sight of a snow white figure dashing over entered his field of vision. And, on the back of that figure was a second large figure.</p><p>Lu Ye was slightly dazed as he watched the tall figure. Amber, who was perched on his shoulder, widened its eyes and stared at the scene in astonishment.</p><p>After a while, the snow-white figure stopped about thirty meters away from Lu Ye, staring calmly at him with its wolf eyes as its soft fur swayed in the wind.</p><p>Behind the figure were more than a hundred giant wolves that were following it closely.</p><p>Lu Ye finally understood what Yi Yi’s message meant. Ju Jia really did bring many giant wolves with him!</p><p>What was going on here? Lu Ye was caught off guard for a moment. Ju Jia was only a Body-tempering Cultivator and he had never heard that he possessed beast-taming abilities, so how could he associate with so many giant wolves?</p><p>Moreover, from what he was seeing, it seemed like this entire pack of wolves was under his command. He couldn’t help but recall the events last night, and he did hear the successive wolf howls. Now that he thought about it, the howls must have come from this wolf pack. However, it was the strength of this wolf pack that surprised him even more.</p><p>The one that he suspected to be the leader, the one that Ju Jia rode, was undoubtedly comparable in strength to a Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivator. The rest of the wolves were also emitting a ferocious aura. A minority of them were lower than the Fourth or Fifth order, while many were in the Eighth or the Ninth Order.</p><p>It was simply hard to imagine just how powerful such a pack of wolves could be in battle.</p><p>After more than half a year of not seeing each other, Ju Jia seemed visibly delighted to be reunited with him again. Even his usually stiff face showed a hint of a smile. He leapt down from the back of the wolf and went over to Lu Ye in a large stride.</p><p>As he drew closer, his shadow cast over Lu Ye.</p><p>Lu Ye looked up at the tall figure and was surprised to find that Ju Jia had grown even taller again. His plain clothing could not hide his physique, and his exposed skin had a bronze-like luster as if it were forged from refined iron.</p><p>Ju Jia lifted his large hand and patted Lu Ye on the shoulder, squeezing him down a bit.</p><p>Lu Ye grinned, not saying a word, just expressing joy towards their long-awaited reunion.</p><p>Amber leapt from Lu Ye’s shoulder and landed on Ju Jia’s head, settling down on it with practiced ease.</p><p>In the midst of the wilderness, two figures stood facing each other, one tall and one short. Behind the towering figure stood more than a hundred giant snow-white wolves that were waiting silently, creating an inexplicably strange scene.</p><p>Lu Ye tilted his body to look past Ju Jia at the wolves, then he lowered his voice and asked, “What’s going on?”</p><p>For now, the wolves seemed to have been brought here by Ju Jia, and they had not shown any malice to neither him nor Ju Jia thus far. However, Lu Ye was still cautious. He had only been parted with him for half a year, so how had Ju Jia managed to subdue such a wolf pack?</p><p>“They followed me,” Ju Jia answered with a helpless expression.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Ju Jia shook his head, indicating that he did not know the answer.</p><p>He was simply waiting for Lu Ye on the Spirit Peak, then in the blink of an eye, he woke up to find himself surrounded by a large pack of wolves just a few days ago. Now that he wanted to leave, the wolf pack ended up following him. Even he himself could not figure out why the wolves were insistent on following him.</p><p>Seeing that he wasn’t going to get an answer out of him, Lu Ye gave up. “Then, come with me. I’ve already made arrangements with Fourth Senior Brother and Senior Sister Feng. Let’s go meet them now.”</p><p>“En,” Ju Jia agreed without objection.</p><p>Lu Ye summoned his Spirit Boat with a raised of his hand and called out to Yi Yi, who was lurking nearby, and she immediately revealed herself. After exchanging greetings with Ju Jia, Yi Yi leapt onto the Spirit Boat.</p><p>Ju Jia also stepped onto the Spirit Boat. However, just as they were about to leave, the snow-white figure charged forward like a gust of wind and rammed against the Spirit Boat, sending it tumbling in the air while Lu Ye and the others were forced to land in a pitiful fall.</p><p>Drawing his saber, Lu Ye watched the pack leader cautiously as it stood just a short distance away. Soon, however, he sheathed his blade. Though the pack leader had knocked over his Spirit Boat, it didn’t exhibit any strong hostility towards them. It seemed that it simply wanted to prevent them from leaving.</p><p>He wasn’t the target of its obstruction however, Ju Jia was! The pack leader seemed reluctant to see Ju Jia leave.</p><p>Based on last night’s events and the situation they were in now, Lu Ye formed a conjecture in his mind.</p><p>The anomaly brought about by Ju Jia’s cultivation attracted many Spirit Beasts to gather around him, indicating that the anomaly was of great benefit to them. If the wolf pack wanted Ju Jia to stay due to this, then everything would make sense.</p><p>After a brief contemplation, Lu Ye said, “Yi Yi, try to communicate with them and ask them what they want.”</p><p>Yi Yi nodded. “Yes.”</p><p>Yi Yi herself didn’t have the ability to communicate directly with the beasts, but it was possible with Amber’s assistance.</p><p>Amber jumped down from Ju Jia’s head and with a shake of its body, its Spirit Energy churned, and it transformed into its true form. With an imposing presence, it approached the pack leader.</p><p>New novel 𝓬hapters are published on freёwebnoѵel.com.</p><p>What happened next was a sight that Lu Ye found hard to comprehend. Amber and the pack leader exchanged roars and howls, communicating almost for as long as it took for an incense stick to burn. Only then did Amber turn around and walk back to them.</p><p>Standing by Lu Ye’s side, Yi Yi sensed Amber’s thoughts and understood. “They don’t want Ju Jia to leave. They want him to stay, and the pack leader even said that Ju Jia was their sacred figure.”</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
