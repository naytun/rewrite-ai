Apart from patrolling and maintaining the Wards with Xie Yunhan, Lu Ye had nothing else to do.</p><p>After the initial days where there was some work to do, his following time here became incredibly leisurely.</p><p>Almost every day, Lu Ye would contact Feng Yuechan to inform her about Li Baxian’s current situation and reassure her.</p><p>During these days, Lu Ye also gathered considerable information from Xie Yunhan.</p><p>There was a considerable number of cultivators in Fox Immortal Valley; more than eighty people. Of them, there were fifteen who were in the Ninth Order Cloud River Realm.</p><p>Such an immense force could rival the number of cultivators in one of the large Primus-level Arcane Glades. Lu Ye had indirectly asked Xie Yunhan about the Fox Mutant’s purpose for gathering so many cultivators under her. There was no way that she was simply gathering them for a simple child’s game of house.</p><p>However, Xie Yunhan did not dare to say much when it came to the Fox Mutant, only telling Lu Ye that he would come to understand everything in a few days.</p><p>Every day, a group of cultivators from the valley would go out to recruit new talents. That is to say, they would search for cultivators in all directions and have them charmed under the Fox Mutant’s influence before bringing them back to have her Divine Soul Secret Technique planted in them, becoming her tools.</p><p>However, since this place was located deep within the Grand Wilds Peak, there were rarely signs of cultivators active around the region, and so there had been no new additions to the valley as of late.</p><p>On this day, as Lu Ye returned from drinking with Xie Yunhan, he saw two figures moving and intertwining with each other, their flying swords cutting through the void.</p><p>Upon closer inspection, he realized that it was Li Baxian sparring and exchanging sword techniques with a woman.</p><p>The woman was the same woman surnamed Yu who had been guarding the Fox Mutant’s chambers. Her name seemed to be Yu Daiwei, and she was also a Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivator. On that day, she had mentioned that as they were both Sword Cultivators, she could spar with Lu Baxian when they had the time.</p><p>Lu Ye had been hanging around Xie Yunhan these days and had no idea when his Fourth Senior Brother had developed a relationship with this woman.</p><p>A Fifth Order Cloud River Realm cultivator and a Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivator. If they really did fight, Li Baxian would naturally be no match for her. However, the two of them were currently just sparring in sword techniques in a lively exchange that attracted the attention of many passing cultivators who stopped to watch and discuss it with each other.</p><p>The atmosphere in Fox Immortal Valley was harmonious, and the cultivators from the two factions in Jiu Zhou were like a big family due to the influence of the Divine Soul Secret Technique, so such technical exchanges were naturally allowed.</p><p>Lu Ye also went over to watch for a while, but he didn’t know much about sword techniques. Watching them, the only thing he got out of their spar was that their soaring swords were swift and beautiful.</p><p>Suddenly, a thought crossed his mind.</p><p>Though he cultivated blade techniques, no one had been able to guide him in that aspect. There was no one in the Crimson Blood Sect who cultivated blade techniques, and though he gained many insights from the Raving Bladesmen, they only imparted on him the basics.</p><p>Since Xia Liang came from the Raving Bladesmen, his blade techniques undoubtedly contained the essence of the Sect. Lu Ye had felt greatly pressured when he crossed blades with him before as Xia Liang’s blade strikes were extremely tricky, revealing the sharpness of his blade even through his heavy injuries.</p><p>If he were to ask Xia Liang to spar with him now… He shouldn’t refuse, right? Perhaps he could even ask him to impart some of his insights about blade techniques to him?</p><p>Under normal circumstances, this would never have been possible. However, now that he had fallen under the influence of the Fox Mutant’s Divine Soul Secret Technique, this might not be out of the question.</p><p>With this in mind, Lu Ye immediately headed towards Xia Liang’s residence, and it didn’t take long for him to arrive at a pavilion. He called out, “Cultivator Xia, are you there?”</p><p>In three breaths of his calling out, the window on the second floor opened, and Xia Liang’s face appeared. Four eyes met, and Xia Liang frowned, “What do you want?”</p><p>The only effect of the Divine Soul Secret Technique planted in each person by the Fox Mutant was to instill unwavering loyalty to her without destroying their original natures.</p><p>The animosity that existed between them would not change just because they entered Fox Immortal Valley together, nor would it change Xia Liang’s opinion of Lu Ye. However, due to the Fox Mutant’s command, Xia Liang would no longer take action against Lu Ye.</p><p>Lu Ye cupped his fist. “I’ve come to seek Cultivator Xia’s guidance in blade techniques!”</p><p>Xia Liang raised an eyebrow, looking extremely surprised. “You want to learn blade techniques from me?”</p><p>“Yes, I hope Cultivator Xia can impart your teachings.”</p><p>Xia Liang stared at him for a while before his furrowed brows relaxed, and a meaningful smile appeared on his face. “Very well!”</p><p>Leaping from the pavilion, he flew straight forwards while saying, “This place is not suitable. Follow me.”</p><p>So Lu Ye followed Xia Liang. From observing his aura, it seemed to him that he had mostly recovered from his previous injuries.</p><p>In a short while, they arrived at an open space. Xia Liang turned around to face Lu Ye, raised his blade, and exuded a powerful aura. “Come, let me see what you can do!”</p><p>Lu Ye cupped his fist again. “Please grant me your guidance!”</p><p>As he finished speaking, he kicked his feet off the ground. With the enhancement of Glyph: Windwalk, he charged towards Xia Liang like a bolt of lightning. As he rushed in front of him, his Inviolable Saber was unsheathed, and a fiery red blade light came crashing down.</p><p>Facing this fierce strike, Xia Liang merely raised his blade to meet it.</p><p>There was a loud boom, and Lu Ye felt a powerful force sweeping towards him from the front that caused his right hand, which was holding the saber to go numb, and even the web of his thumb tore.</p><p>However, Xia Liang stood unwavering and as he swung his blade down, Lu Ye’s figure was sent flying at once.</p><p>Their disparity in cultivation was too great, so even if Xia Liang let him make the first move, Lu Ye still suffered a great loss from the exchange.</p><p>Fortunately, Xia Liang did not harbor any killing intent towards him. Otherwise, he could easily leave Lu Ye severely injured or even dead just by following up with a few more strikes.</p><p>On that day, Lu Ye had pushed Xia Liang to the edge and almost managed to kill him, but that was because Xia Liang had already suffered heavy injuries. As a disciple of the Raving Bladesmen, he was ranked in the top ten of the Spirit Creek Battlefield’s Role of Supremacy. Xia Liang was exceptionally talented, and as a Ninth Order Cloud River Realm cultivator, he was beyond Lu Ye’s current ability to contend with.</p><p>Landing on the ground in a sorry state, Lu Ye’s body staggered back uncontrollably. Once he regained his footing, he launched another attack.</p><p>Although his training in the Rift of Illusions could strengthen his ability in killing his enemies, it couldn’t compare to the benefits of sparring with a traditional blade user like Xia Liang.</p><p>Each exchange and withdrawal gave Lu Ye new insights. The angles of Xia Liang’s strikes, the timing of his strikes, and the activation of Spiritual Power… Even though Xia Liang only intended to teach him a lesson, such an exchange was still greatly beneficial to Lu Ye.</p><p>Lu Ye became increasingly convinced that seeking guidance from Xia Liang was the right choice.</p><p>If he could have Xia Liang give him pointers in the cultivation of blade techniques, that would be even better.</p><p>However, even though Xia Liang had been affected by the Fox Mutant’s Divine Soul Secret Technique and would not kill Lu Ye, the resentment in his heart still remained. It was unrealistic to expect Xia Liang to guide Lu Ye in his cultivation of blade techniques. The only reason they were sparring now was because Xia Liang wanted an outlet to vent that resentment.</p><p>While they were sparring, Zhou Yuntian appeared at Xie Yunhan’s residence uninvited.</p><p>Xie Yunhan was the oldest member out of the entirety of Fox Immortal Valley, having spent twelve years there. Just as nobody could beat that record, he was also the oldest one here.</p><p>However, in terms of being the most valued by the Fox Mutant, Zhou Yuntian was undoubtedly the one. He could be regarded as the grand steward of the entire Fox Immortal Valley, handling both major and minor matters. The Fox Mutant rarely ever showed up, preferring to stay inside her own quarters at all times.</p><p>In the room, the two sat facing each other, enjoying their drinks while engaging in conversation.</p><p>Zhou Yuntian’s primary goal this visit to see Xie Yunhan was to inquire about Lu Ye’s situation. As they were the only two Ward Cultivators in Fox Immortal Valley, Zhou Yuntian naturally paid close attention to them.</p><p>“Brother Xie, how is Cultivator Lu’s proficiency in the Way of Wards?” After a few drinks, Zhou Yuntian stated the purpose of his visit.</p><p>“He’s a rare genius!” Xie Yunhan praised without reservation.</p><p>Zhou Yuntian was stunned. The valley had recruited a few Ward Cultivators before, but Xie Yunhan didn’t show much regard to any of them. Although Xie Yunhan’s cultivation level wasn’t particularly high, his proficiency in the Way of Wards was not low. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to maintain all the Wards in the entirety of Fox Immortal Valley.</p><p>So, when he heard such high praise of Lu Ye, Zhou Yuntian was taken aback.</p><p>“Brother Zhou, Lu Ye’s proficiency in the Way of Wards far surpasses this Xie’s. Even though I haven’t made much progress in cultivation over the years, I have invested a considerable amount of time in the Way of Wards. In the Cloud River Realm, there are few who can surpass me in this area unless they come from a prominent Ward cultivation Sect background, but Lu Ye’s proficiency in the Way of Wards is truly admirable. Let me put it this way, even if I were given ten more years, I still wouldn’t be able to surpass Lu Ye in the Way of Wards.”</p><p>After getting to know Lu Ye, Xie Yunhan had also sought guidance from him in the Way of Wards, and Lu Ye had not kept anything from him, allowing Xie Yunhan to benefit greatly.</p><p>Zhou Yuntian’s eyes brightened as he listened. He asked cautiously, “Brother Xie, that’s not just an exaggeration, is it? I know your proficiency in the Way of Wards, but is Cultivator Lu really as amazing as you say?”</p><p>Xie Yunhan shook his head. “You’re not a Ward Cultivator, so you don’t understand. However, I can assure you that I am not exaggerating. In fact, I think Lu Ye hasn’t fully demonstrated his abilities in this Way yet. He might be afraid of shocking me with his skills.”</p><p>“If that’s the case… Haven’t we picked up a real treasure?” Zhou Yuntian’s expression turned excited.</p><p>Lu Ye’s cultivation, which was only in the Fourth Order, was nothing extraordinary in Fox Immortal Valley. However, if his proficiency in the Way of Wards was as amazing as Xie Yunhan claimed, then he would be quite the precious find for the valley.</p><p>“Speaking of which, even if Brother Zhou didn’t come to see me today, I was planning to visit you.”</p><p>“Is Brother Xie suggesting…”</p><p>“The next time we set out, let Lu Ye be in charge of the Wards, and I will act as his assistant. We might finally have a chance of success then!”</p><p>“I need to report this to the mistress and let her decide. However, if that’s the case, then Brother Xie…”</p><p>Xie Yunhan raised his hand. “As long as it helps the mistress succeed, it doesn’t matter who takes the lead and who assists. I have been in Fox Immortal Valley for so many years, how could I not see that?”</p><p>“Of course, of course. Everything is for the mistress’s success in her mission.” Saying so, he quickly stood up. “This is an important matter, so I will go to see the mistress now and tell her the good news. I’m sure the mistress will be delighted.”</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
