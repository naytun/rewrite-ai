Now that the Spiritual Qi in Arcane Glade had completely stabilized, the cultivation environment was excellent. Combined with the consumption of Vital Spirit Pills, Lu Ye’s cultivation efficiency reached an all-time high.</p><p>Of course, even so, it couldn’t compare with the speed of cultivating with an Amulet.</p><p>For cultivators cultivating with Amulets would always be the fastest way to improve one’s cultivation.</p><p>After three days, all the Wolf Mutants received different Tattoos.</p><p>During these three days, Lu Ye also obtained more than a dozen Mutant Cores from the Wolf Mutants. They were all brought back from their hunting trips, and the quality of the Mutant Cores varied, but overall, they were pretty good.</p><p>After the last Wolf Mutant had its Tattoo done, the entire wolf pack suddenly gathered together. The tall figure of the pack leader stood out among the pack. As it howled to the sky, the wolf pack echoed along.</p><p>Then, the pack leader turned around and while leading its pack, charged out of Ameliorate Valley with great momentum.</p><p>Lu Ye was curious and wondered where the wolf pack was going.</p><p>Recently, though the wolf pack did go out to hunt, they had never all left before. At most, a group of Wolf Mutants was sent out while the majority stayed in the valley.</p><p>This was the first time they had all left like this.</p><p>Moreover, from the momentum of their departure, it felt like they were a large army setting out on an expedition.</p><p>[Could they be going to seek revenge from some Spirit Beast?] Lu Ye wondered to himself.</p><p>The overall strength of the wolf pack was indeed powerful, but that didn’t mean they were uncontested in the Grand Wilds Peak. They might have suffered losses under some enemies in the past, which is why they relied on Ju Jia’s cultivation to enhance the strength of their pack. Now, with Lu Ye’s Tattoos, their overall strength could not have increased too much, but twenty to thirty percent was still possible, giving them the confidence to seek revenge.</p><p>Of course, Lu Ye couldn’t be sure if that truly were the case.</p><p>By nightfall, the wolf pack still hadn’t returned.</p><p>Lu Ye roasted some snake meat and had a simple meal, then he got up and went to the Divine Opportunity Column, pressing his hand on it and connecting to the Vault of Providence.</p><p>Soon, he appeared in the small room dedicated to the commissioning of Spirit Artifact upgrades.</p><p>The agreed-upon time with the woman had arrived.</p><p>To his puzzlement, however, there were no signs of the woman even after he waited for more than two hours.</p><p>Lu Ye wasn’t worried that she would keep his Inviolable out of greed. They had already signed the Sacred Pact, and if she failed to deliver the Inviolable on time, she would undoubtedly suffer the punishment of the Heavens. Even if she was a Real Lake or even Divine Ocean Realm cultivator, she wouldn’t be able to withstand it.</p><p>So as long as she was alive, she would definitely deliver the Inviolable.</p><p>However, things would be troublesome if the opposite were true. The Inviolable had been with Lu Ye for several years and he had formed a bond with it. Even if he were to replace it with an identical saber, it would undoubtedly affect the output of his power.</p><p>[It can’t be that coincidental. Did she really die?]</p><p>Time passed little by little, and as the deadline approached, the space in front of Lu Ye suddenly distorted, and the woman’s figure appeared.</p><p>Lu Ye looked up and saw that her face was somewhat pale. There were even faint traces of dried blood at the corners of her mouth. It was clear that she had just fought with someone and was injured.</p><p>When she saw Lu Ye waiting here, the woman let out a long sigh of relief. She placed the Inviolable on the counter in front of her and continued using her old voice to deceive Lu Ye. “I have accomplished your request. Please take a look.”</p><p>Lu Ye picked up the Inviolable and casually weighed it in his hands. Indeed, it was twice as heavy as before, and it felt just right in his hand.</p><p>Upon drawing the saber, he found that the already dark blade appeared even deeper in color, but within the darkness was a sense of sharpness. His mind stirred as he examined the various enchantments on the blade.</p><p>There were indeed twenty-seven enchantments.</p><p>All the requirements were met. As for how much the Inviolable had increased in power, that would have to be tested in actual combat.</p><p>However, since the Inviolable was also upgraded from Low Grade to Middle Grade by the same person, there shouldn’t be any problems with this upgrade. Thanks to their previous cooperation, Lu Ye had some confidence in the woman’s craftsmanship.</p><p>“No problem.” Lu Ye nodded affirmatively. As soon as he finished speaking, the Sacred Pact took effect, and with a slight warmth on the back of his hand, the agreed-upon amount of Contribution Points were deducted.</p><p>The transaction was complete, and there was no need to linger any longer. Lu Ye wasn’t interested in knowing how she had been injured, nor did he need to inquire about it in order to avoid exposing some of his own secrets.</p><p>Just as he was about to leave, the woman suddenly called out to him. “Wait, young friend.”</p><p>Lu Ye looked up at her.</p><p>“You’re in the Cloud River Realm, aren’t you?”</p><p>“I am.” With the grade of the Inviolable evident, it was only natural that the other party would be able to guess such a thing so easily.</p><p>“Young friend should still be planning to upgrade this blade to Top Grade in the future, right?”</p><p>“Possibly.”</p><p>“In that case, why not take my imprint? If you have any needs in the future, you can contact me directly without having to go through any trouble.”</p><p>This proposal was somewhat unexpected to Lu Ye, but judging by her expression, it seemed that she still wanted to profit from him.</p><p>It was understandable. Anyway, he would still need to come here to commission someone if he wanted to further upgrade the saber in the future, and if he could entrust it to an acquaintance, it would save him some trouble.</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>The woman then raised her hand and brushed it against her Battlefield Imprint. A glimmer of light drifted towards Lu Ye, who raised his hand, and the light landed on his own Battlefield Imprint located on the back of his hand.</p><p>“What should I call you?” Lu Ye asked.</p><p>“Just call me Master Yu,” the woman replied. “But if you want to find this old woman, you’ll have to leave the Cloud River Battlefield first. You won’t be able to contact me while you’re inside.”</p><p>The woman’s cultivation level was undoubtedly above the Cloud River Realm, and her true body should be somewhere in Jiu Zhou.</p><p>“Understood.” Lu Ye nodded slightly. With a thought, his figure disappeared and he left the space.</p><p>The woman was left frowning. “He didn’t even tell me his name. What an impolite youngster.”</p><p>After muttering to herself, she quickly left as well. She was injured and needed to heal as soon as possible.</p><p>Inside the wooden cabin in the Arcane Glade, Lu Ye inspected the Inviolable. He infused his Spiritual Power into it, and compared to before, it seemed to flow more smoothly. Over the course of this long period, small traces were left on the blade as Lu Ye fought with the saber. No matter how sturdy the Inviolable Saber was, it was inevitable that it would show some signs of wear and tear.</p><p>However, after the upgrade, all these tiny marks had disappeared, and the entire saber seemed to have been reborn.</p><p>Setting aside the woman’s pretentious personality, her craftsmanship in the art of Spirit Artifact refinement was indeed impressive.</p><p>In fact, if Lu Ye wanted to, he could also cultivate the Way of Artification. With his foundation as a Glyphweaver, he should be able to progress twice as fast in that discipline.</p><p>However, there was only so much a single person could do. In addition to being a Glyphweaver, which was his main focus on cultivation, he also cultivated the Way of Wards and Way of Tattoos, so he had no more energy to spare.</p><p>He took out a seed of the Mystic Fruit from his Storage Sphere in preparation to enter the Rift of Illusions to test out his saber in actual combat.</p><p>As he immersed his mind into it, he quickly appeared in that unique small space, the surroundings of which he surveyed vigilantly at once.</p><p>Since the incident when he was slashed by an unknown person in this place, Lu Ye had always been cautious whenever he used the seed of the Mystic Fruit to enter the Rift of Illusions.</p><p>However, so much time had passed and he had not encountered that person again.</p><p>Firstly, neither of them entered the Rift of Illusions for training that frequently. After all, each entry into the Rift of Illusions consumed a certain amount of Contribution Points.</p><p>Secondly, this small space was only a transit point, and as long as they didn’t enter simultaneously, they wouldn’t meet each other.</p><p>This chapter is updat𝓮d by freēwebnovel.com.</p><p>It was just a great coincidence that he had encountered another person here that time.</p><p>After spending a hundred Contribution Points, Lu Ye pushed open the large door and stepped into the Rift of Illusions before standing there with blade in hand.</p><p>Mist rolled around him. Soon, a figure charged out from behind the curtain of mist. Before the other person arrived before him, telekinetic techniques had already been sent out in Lu Ye’s direction.</p><p>This time, the opponent he encountered in the Rift of Illusions was a cultivator, and judging from the momentum of their attack, they were also in the Fourth Order Cloud River Realm, just like Lu Ye.</p><p>The strength of the opponents in the Rift of Illusions was always linked to Lu Ye’s own strength. If he entered with a cultivation in the Fourth Order Cloud River Realm, then the opponent’s strength would also be in the Fourth Order. The difficulty would gradually increase until he could no longer resist them and was eventually expelled.</p><p>However, facing opponents at the same level was already a common occurrence for Lu Ye. He confronted the numerous beams of light that came at him, and the Inviolable ignited with flames, blocking all of the incoming attacks before charging directly at the enemy. As the blade flashed past, and the enemy’s figure disintegrated.</p><p>The mist surged, and this time, two figures charged out…</p><p>Brandishing his saber, a blade light cut through the air. Lu Ye’s figure moved agilely within the Rift of Illusions, the Inviolable burning with a dazzling flame as one enemy fell after another.</p><p>After being upgraded to High Grade, the Inviolable undoubtedly had much greater destructive power, but correspondingly, the consumption of Spiritual Power became more intense on him.</p><p>This was unavoidable.</p><p>This was also the reason why cultivators of different realms could use different grades of Spirit Artifacts.</p><p>If a cultivator in the Spirit Creek Realm were given a High Grade Spirit Artifact, even if they could activate it, they wouldn’t be able to sustain it for long before their Spiritual Power was completely drained. freēwēbnovel.com</p><p>With Lu Ye’s current cultivation, which was in the Fourth Order, he could barely handle the power drain of a High Grade Spirit Artifact. If he could raise his cultivation to the Fifth Order, it would be much easier to handle.</p><p>He had been considering whether to replace the flying weapons in his weapon holder with High Grade Spirit Artifacts, but after this test, he decided against it.</p><p>It was not that he couldn’t afford it, it just felt unnecessary.</p><p>The primary method of killing for a Combat Cultivator was close-quarters combat, whereas the Way of Telekinesis was just an embellishment, providing a means of long-range combat to avoid the awkward situation of being attacked from afar without being able to fight back.</p><p>However, compared to the telekinetic techniques of other Combat Cultivators, Lu Ye’s telekinetic techniques were undoubtedly more lethal since he could enhance them with Glyphs. Glyph: Windwalk made his telekinetic techniques faster, and Glyph: Sharp Edge made them more powerful, and this was something that most cultivators would struggle to compare with.</p><p>After an hour, Lu Ye was expelled from the Rift of Illusions. He felt a slight tingling sensation in his mind, which quickly disappeared. This was undoubtedly a benefit of having a powerful Divine Soul.</p><p>&lt;</p><p>&gt;</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
