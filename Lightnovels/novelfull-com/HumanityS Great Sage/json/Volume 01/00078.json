Instead, he became more and more excited. That was because he was accumulating experience with every failure he faced.</p><p>The hardest part about casting the Gathering Spirits Spiritual Pattern on a Spiritual Point was the surging of his Spiritual Power. The Spiritual Power flowing through the Circulation would wash the Gathering Spirits Spiritual Pattern away. Therefore, he needed to avoid the flood of his Spiritual Power if he wanted to cast the Gathering Spirits Spiritual Pattern on a Spiritual Point. There was no chance of success otherwise.</p><p>Unfortunately, this would create another problem. If the constructed Spiritual Pattern was located too far away from the Spiritual Point, then it would not have much of an effect. For example, if he constructed the Spiritual Pattern on his hand, the Spiritual Pattern would function to gather the Spiritual Qi. It was just that his body had difficulty in accepting Spiritual Qi from an external source, so he had no way of converting the Spiritual Qi into his own Spiritual Power.</p><p>It was necessary that he found the balancing point which would allow the Spiritual Pattern to function perfectly while also maintaining the balance of the Spiritual Pattern. Fortunately, the consumption of constructing the Gathering Spirits Spiritual Pattern was not high. That was something he already discovered when he first obtained the Spiritual Pattern.</p><p>He was still unsuccessful four hours later. Therefore, he decided to try changing the shape of the Spiritual Pattern. Under normal circumstances, a Spiritual Pattern would be displayed as a flat surface when constructed. It was impossible for a person to make changes to a Spiritual Pattern unless that person had extremely profound attainments in this field.</p><p>Although Lu Ye did not have the knowledge that came from researching Spiritual Patterns, a huge amount of information regarding the respective Spiritual Patterns had flooded his mind when he obtained these Spiritual Patterns. That knowledge had given him great insight into the mysteries of these Spiritual Patterns. When it came to the three Spiritual Patterns that he had mastered, he was perfectly capable of changing their forms. All he lacked was the practical experience of actually doing it.</p><p>After another round of numerous attempts, he finally formed a Gathering Spirits Spiritual Pattern approximately half a day later. This time around, this Spiritual Pattern was no longer dissipated by the flow of his Spiritual Power.</p><p>[I did it!] He looked ecstatic. Silently perceiving the state of his body, he could sense that the surrounding World Spiritual Qi was pouring into that Spiritual Point and being converted into his Spiritual Power under the influence of the Spiritual Pattern.</p><p>At this moment, the Gathering Spirits Spiritual Pattern had been transformed into the shape of a funnel. When he cast this Spiritual Pattern on his spiritual Point, the tip of the funnel would poke into his Spiritual Point on the smallest margin possible.</p><p>In other words, the Spiritual Qi gathered from the outside world would be injected into his Spiritual Point through this tiny funnel and directly converted through the flow of his Spiritual Power. There was no need for the Spiritual Qi to pass through his body. In this way, it didn‚Äôt matter whether his talent in cultivation was one leaf or sixty-four leaves, it would not affect the effect of the Gathering Spirits Spiritual Pattern.</p><p>[I‚Äôm such a genius!] He couldn‚Äôt resist praising himself in his heat.</p><p>Although he succeeded in casting the Gathering Spirits Spiritual Pattern on his Spiritual Point and also allowed his body to begin absorbing the World Spiritual Qi, the effects of the Gathering Spirits Spiritual Pattern were very small and limited due to the small size of the Spiritual Pattern. Nevertheless, it was only one Spiritual Point‚Ä¶</p><p>[Now that I have unlocked 29 Spiritual Points‚Ä¶ What would happen if I blessed all 29 Spiritual Points with the Gathering Spirits Spiritual Pattern?] He couldn‚Äôt help looking forward to the results. If his idea could be implemented, then his cultivation would not be limited to only consuming Spirit Pills in the future! He would also be able to absorb the World Spiritual Qi! Not only would it save a lot on cultivation resources, but it would also improve his cultivation efficiency at the same time.</p><p>As soon as this idea appeared in his head, he could not suppress his excitement and immediately began experimenting. The second time was much easier after his first successful attempt previously. It didn‚Äôt take him longer than an hour before he managed to cast a small funnel-like Spiritual Pattern on his second Spiritual Point, then his third Spiritual Point, followed by his fourth Spiritual Point‚Ä¶ He was gradually getting better with practice.</p><p>He began to notice a faint effect when he reached his tenth Spiritual Point. The effect became much more noticeable when he reached his twentieth Spiritual Point. By the time he finished casting the Gathering Spirits Spiritual Pattern on all 29 of his Spiritual Points, it was already night.</p><p>At this point, he could distinctly feel that the World Spiritual Qi in the surroundings was continuously pouring into his Spiritual Points. It was then converted into his strength with the rapid flow of his Spiritual Power.</p><p>The Gathering Spirits Spiritual Pattern could be maintained for a long time since it was constantly gathering the World Spiritual Qi to replenish itself. In principle, the Gathering Spirits Spiritual Patterns in his body would last forever as long as he himself did not take the initiative to disperse them. Needless to say, this was impossible to actually achieve in reality. The Spiritual Patterns could only be maintained since his condition was stable at the moment. On the contrary, the flow of his Spiritual Power would surge violently the moment he started fighting and that would easily destroy the Spiritual Patterns.</p><p>In the end, this was a deal with relatively no cost. Lu Ye would only need to reconstruct the Gathering Spirits Spiritual Patterns on his Spiritual Points at a suitable time. After that, the World Spiritual Qi would gather and pour into his body without him doing anything whatsoever. He could even focus on doing other tasks‚Ä¶</p><p>All that was left was to see how much these Spiritual Patterns would benefit him in a certain period of time. Thus, he quietly focused himself and sensed the changes in the Spiritual Power within his body in order to figure out the answer to this question.</p><p>Six hours later, he finally came to a conclusion. If he maintained the Spiritual Patterns on all of his 29 Spiritual Points for a day and a night, then the benefits he obtained were almost equivalent to consuming a Spirit Restoring Pill‚Ä¶</p><p>It was not a lot but not little either. It had to be said that this was only the effects coming from 29 Spiritual Points. There were as many as a total of 360 Spiritual Points in a cultivator‚Äôs body. If he could endow all 360 Spiritual Points with the Gathering Spirits one day, then the benefits he would gain would be monumental.</p><p>He currently had a lot of Spirit Restoring Pills in his possession. Not to mention that he also had the auxiliary cultivation technique Gluttonous Feast, as well as the support of the Gathering Spirits Spiritual Pattern. He was feeling extremely eager and couldn‚Äôt wait to find a place to retreat and cultivate until he reached the Ninth-Order Spirit Creek Realm‚Ä¶</p><p>Unfortunately, what made him feel extremely helpless was that he did not have a suitable cultivation technique on hand. The Golden Liberation Technique that he previously received from Manager Yang could only be used up to the Third-Order Spirit Creek Realm. ùóáùû∏ùë£‚ÑØùëôùëõùó≤xt.ùëêùëúùëÄ</p><p>He originally planned to wait until he arrived at the next city and see if he could buy a cultivation technique from the Divine Trade Association. For this reason, he had sold four pieces of Yuan Metal ore during his journey and saved more than 200 Spirit Stones. Who could have expected that he would temporarily be unable to escape from the Split Sky Gorge?</p><p>[This is a bit troubling‚Ä¶] After pondering over it for a while, Lu Ye lifted his hand, touched his Battlefield Imprint, and sent out a message.</p><p>Chu Tian was meditating and recovering his strength when a message arrived suddenly. He hurriedly checked the message and saw that it was from Lu Ye. Having learnt from his lesson during the day, he cautiously replied with a single sentence. ‚ÄòJunior Brother Yi Ye, can I help you?‚Äô</p><p>‚ÄòDo you have any Black Grade cultivation techniques? Sell me one.‚Äô</p><p>Chu Tian was very puzzled. ‚ÄòWhy do you need a Black Grade cultivation technique?‚Äô</p><p>Inside the tunnel, Lu Ye stared at Chu Tian‚Äôs message with a speechless expression. [Is this guy an idiot?] Even so, he patiently replied, ‚ÄòTo cultivate!‚Äô</p><p>Chu Tian couldn‚Äôt help scratching his head in bewilderment when he saw Lu Ye‚Äôs reply.</p><p>A short while later, a message was sent to Mystic Sect‚Äôs base. Wang Yang glanced at Xiao Zhu in surprise. ‚ÄúIs the information true?‚Äù</p><p>Xiao Zhu nodded. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a message from Chu Tian. It should be true.‚Äù</p><p>He seriously considered the matter for a moment and couldn‚Äôt help snorting with laughter. ‚ÄúThat truly is the style of those major Sects. The disciples who are sent out for training have to rely on themselves completely, so they don‚Äôt even receive any cultivation techniques. It looks like he was previously cultivating a Yellow Grade cultivation technique. Now that he has completed the Third-Order Spirit Creek Realm, he needs to switch to a new cultivation technique.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúChu Tian is waiting for a reply. How should I answer?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a set of cultivation techniques that can be found anywhere. Just give it to him. Also, ask Chu Tian to ask him about his Element.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù She nodded in response. [These disciples from the major Sects seem to be quite pitiful. Our Sect might only be in the Ninth Tier, but our Senior Brothers and Senior Sisters will help us during the early stages of our cultivation. We don‚Äôt have to suffer through so many hardships.]</p><p>‚ÄúBy the way, don‚Äôt just give it to him. The major Sects hate that the most. Sell it to him, but don‚Äôt charge him too many Spirit Stones. He is probably very poor.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI got it.‚Äù</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
