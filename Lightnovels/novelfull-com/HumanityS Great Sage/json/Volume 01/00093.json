Just then, he received a brief message from Cao Ye again. ‘We’re in danger. Come back quickly!’</p><p>When he saw Cao Ye’s message earlier and realised that those cultivators from Mystic Sect were launching an attack on the station of Nine Star Clan, he wasn’t anxious at all. That was because it wasn’t easy to invade a station. According to his own estimation, even if those from Mystic Sect had gone all out, the Grand Array around his station could last for one to two days, which would buy him enough time to kill Lu Ye before going back.</p><p>However, just a short time later, Cao Ye sent him such a message, which went to show that the situation in the station was truly terrible. Hurriedly, he headed back to the station, and at the same time, he sent a message to Cao Ye in order to find out what was going on. Nevertheless, just like a stone plunging into the ocean, he couldn’t get any reply.</p><p>…</p><p>Under the waterfall lake, Lu Ye was in a groggy state as almost all his Spiritual Power had been depleted. Blood kept spurting out of his wounds, and some pieces of his flesh floated around. Upon plunging into the water, he realised that there was someone else in there. The person seemed to be collecting something under the water. As their eyes met, both of them were shocked.</p><p>However, Lu Ye didn’t have the time to explain anything to him. Upon stabilising himself at the bottom of the lake, he immediately activated a Spiritual Pattern above his head. The next instant, a Golden Arc Slash broke through the water and reached them. The cultivator didn’t even groan in pain when he was cut to pieces, so it could be said that he had suffered from a disaster that was uncalled for. The Spiritual Pattern above Lu Ye’s head also broke apart upon impact. Fortunately, the rest of the Golden Arc didn’t reach him.</p><p>The attack soon stopped, but he didn’t dare to show up as he wasn’t certain about what Dong Shu Ye was doing. Enduring his exhaustion and pain, he kept moving forward under the water for several dozen breaths. It wasn’t until he was about to suffocate that he hurriedly stuck his head out on the surface. After taking a deep breath, he quickly submerged into the water again and moved forward with difficulty.</p><p>After doing this several times, he became extremely exhausted. Nevertheless, he felt fortunate that Dong Shu Ye didn’t launch an attack on him again. When he emerged on the surface again 15 minutes later, he felt a force striking him from behind as though something had hit him.</p><p>His back was already injured, and he was in a terrible state, which was why he almost passed out upon impact. Instinctively, he thought that Dong Shu Ye had reached him, so he unsheathed the sword from his waist and turned around to slash back at him. However, there was no one in sight. All he saw was a wooden slab that had been cut into halves. It was this wooden slab that had struck him. Looking around, he realised that Dong Shu Ye was nowhere to be found.</p><p>Holding the sword in his hand, he felt perplexed. [Where’s that guy? A Seventh-Order cultivator has come all the way here to hunt me down, and he pushed me over the edge. It’s not likely that he’d give up at this point.] Nevertheless, he couldn’t find Dong Shu Ye at all, so he could confirm that the older guy had really left.</p><p>Soon, a realisation dawned upon him. When he was under the waterfall lake earlier, a cultivator was killed by Dong Shu Ye. [Could that guy think that he had killed me?] It was highly possible. Moreover, those from Mystic Sect were raiding the station of Nine Star Clan, which was why Dong Shu Ye wasn’t in the mood to get into the water to make sure that Lu Ye was dead. After confirming that he had indeed killed a person, he hurriedly left the place.</p><p>[Is that the reason I’ve gotten out of the woods?] Upon that realisation, Lu Ye became at ease as his exhaustion and pain came over him, which caused his body to keep sinking. Hurriedly, he raised his hands and grabbed the wooden slab to make himself afloat with difficulty.</p><p>He felt extremely dizzy as if he might pass out at any moment. Nevertheless, he knew that if he became unconscious at this point, he would not be able to awaken again. This time, he was seriously injured. With his right hand trembling, he fished out a jade bottle from his Storage Bag. After lifting the lid, he poured everything into his mouth regardless of how many Healing Pills there were. Upon chewing them, he gulped them down.</p><p>He even intended to switch his cultivation technique to Gluttonous Feast to increase the speed at which the pills were absorbed. However, he didn’t have much Spiritual Power left as all his Spiritual Points were empty. His Golden Liberation Technique was about to stop running, and he didn’t have much energy left to use a different cultivation technique. Therefore, he could only do his best to tie his clothes to the wooden slab.</p><p>[Don’t drown… That would be laughable.] When the last thought sprang into his mind, his vision darkened as he lost his consciousness.</p><p>…</p><p>When he opened his eyes again, he realised that he was lying on his stomach on a bed. After a momentary daze, an indescribable pain came over him. What surprised him was that there was a person seated beside him. A pleasant scent permeated the air. From the corner of his eye, he could see that it was a curvy figure, so he reckoned that the person next to him was a woman.</p><p>Besides the pain, he also felt a numbing sensation on his back. Additionally, he could feel a slight fluctuation of Spiritual Power, and a green light kept flickering. Was he saved by someone? He recalled that, before he passed out, he had tied his clothes to the wooden slab. Therefore, he would supposedly flow with the water current afterwards. Now that he appeared in such a place, it was apparent that someone had saved him.</p><p>He didn’t utter a word as he wasn’t sure who his rescuer was. Secretly, he tried to check on himself. It was terrible as he was still severely injured, and his Spiritual Power hadn’t recovered. Besides a deep cut on his back, his chest and arms were all burned.</p><p>These injuries were fatal for the average person, but he was a cultivator now, so he was able to persevere for a longer time. Moreover, he had gulped down some Healing Pills before he passed out, which should help keep him alive. Nevertheless, he was still in a horrible state.</p><p>“Your breathing has changed,” a pleasant and soft voice was suddenly heard saying. “It’s expected that you’re vigilant of a stranger, but if I wanted to kill you, you would’ve lost your life by now.”</p><p>An embarrassed Lu Ye remained silent as he wasn’t sure what to say.</p><p>Just then, the woman extended her fair hand and said, “Although I’ve saved you, I still have to find out which side you’re from.”</p><p>After she finished speaking, a light blue glow radiated from the back of her hand. She had taken the initiative to reveal the side she was from, which made Lu Ye to be at ease. After he activated his remaining Spiritual Power, a light blue glow also appeared on the back of his hand.</p><p>“I’ve saved the right person, then,” she uttered gently.</p><p>Despite her soft voice, Lu Ye was certain that if he wasn’t willing to reveal the colour of his Battlefield Imprint earlier, or that the glow on the back of his hand was red, she would certainly kill him. In Spirit Creek Battlefield, coming from a different side was a valid reason to kill. There was no room for mercy and pity.</p><p>The numbing sensation on his back intensified, and the green light flickered more frequently. A moment later, the fluctuation of Spiritual Power on his back stopped, and following that, the woman applied something on his wounds, which pained him and caused him to be covered in sweat.</p><p>Then, she pasted something on the wounds on his back. Lu Ye couldn’t see it, but he reckoned that it was a plaster or something. After she was done with all that, she rose from the chair and said, “You’re seriously injured, and you’d better stay put so that your wounds are not irritated.”</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>She replied, “It was Ling Yu who discovered you and brought you back.” After she finished speaking, she shuffled out of the room.</p><p>It wasn’t until this moment that he saw the woman’s profile. Perhaps it was because she had helped him, but he felt that this woman was as beautiful as a fairy. Her chest was especially plump. With her hands placed on her belly, she walked in an elegant manner.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
