Compared to the time when he had just left Green Cloud Mountain, he was undoubtedly more calm and collected now. Also, he was already used to such a bumpy ride, so Amber running at full speed wouldn’t affect his cultivation session. Certainly, he was less efficient now than when he was able to cultivate in a serene environment. Fortunately, he had the help of Gathering Spirits.</p><p>All thirty of his Spiritual Points had been blessed with Gathering Spirits as they continuously attracted the World Spiritual Qi in the air. As the pill was being refined in Lu Ye’s stomach, and with Spiritual Qi streaming in, the thirtieth point he had just unlocked was slowly filled with Spiritual Power. He didn’t use Gluttonous Feast because it would require some time to switch to a different technique, which was unlike when he was taking a rest after becoming exhausted from the battle with Luo Ji. At that time, Luo Ji was well within his sight, so he could immediately find out and use a different technique should Luo Ji make a move.</p><p>However, it was impossible to do that when he was on the go as an accident might happen at any moment. Maybe in just ten breaths’ time when he had to use a different technique, he would come across danger. By keeping the Golden Liberation Technique running, he was better prepared to react to any turn of events. The only thing he had to sacrifice was the speed at which he cultivated, which was no big deal.</p><p>He made some calculations and realised the pills he had were enough to last him until he ascended to the Fourth-Order Spirit Creek Realm. Certainly, that was assuming that there was no additional consumption. If he got into a scuffle again, he would need to use more pills. Besides that, Amber also needed some pills every day. One hour ago, he had left Split Sky Gorge as Amber’s speed was truly incredible. Referring to the 10-point map and the instructions in the Battlefield Imprint, Lu Ye pointed out a direction for Amber and let it run.</p><p>While he was enjoying the ride, he suddenly frowned and took a look at the Battlefield Imprint. [Why has Chu Tian contacted me again?] However, after he was done with reading the message, his expression changed drastically, whereupon he landed a slap on the tiger’s back and yelled, “Amber, run! Someone is racing after us!”</p><p>Hearing that, Amber immediately hastened its pace, which almost caused Lu Ye to fall off its back. Yi Yi stuck out her head from the tiger’s back and asked in a grim voice, “Did Chu Tian from Mystic Sect send you a message? Who is coming after us? What’s the person’s cultivation?”</p><p>“A Seventh-Order Spirit Creek Realm Master called Dong Shu Ye,” Lu Ye replied.</p><p>When he was killing the disciples from Nine Star Clan in Split Sky Gorge, he hadn’t even come across a single Fifth-Order cultivator. He thought that he hadn’t seen any strong cultivators because he was in the outer circle of the battlefield. However, it wasn’t until he met the woman with double buns and the burly man from Nine Star Clan that he realised that it wasn’t the truth. Although he had no idea how powerful they were, they were definitely above the Fifth-Order. It was then he realised that it wasn’t that there were no cultivators above the Fifth-Order in the outer circle. The reason he hadn’t seen any one of them prior to that was that the two great forces had been tying each other down.</p><p>A Seventh-Order cultivator must be a mainstay in any great force. The fact that such a person was coming all the way to hunt him down suggested that those from Nine Star Clan were determined to get him killed. Presently, there was an extremely solemn expression on Lu Ye’s face. Although he couldn’t really defeat Luo Ji, he was confident that he could even deal with a Fifth-Order cultivator if he ever came across one. Nevertheless, if his opponent was a Seventh-Order cultivator, he would never be able to resist.</p><p>Upon realising the severity of the matter, Yi Yi urged Amber to run faster. Amber expended all its energy to run at the speed of lightning as the wind howled and the view around them moved backwards rapidly. Seeing a new message in his Battlefield Imprint, Lu Ye quickly read it.</p><p>‘Hang in there, Brother Yi Ye. Dong Shu Ye won’t stay at your place for too long.’</p><p>‘What do you mean?’ Lu Ye hurriedly asked.</p><p>At this moment, Chu Tian was walking alongside Wang Yang as those from Mystic Sect were about to launch a sneak attack on Nine Star Clan. He was in a dilemma as he wasn’t sure how to explain it to Lu Ye. In fact, they had made use of Lu Ye because they deliberately let word get out that Lu Ye was leaving Split Sky Gorge, which prompted Dong Shu Ye to hunt him down. However, Chu Tian couldn’t explicitly tell him what had happened as it would only irritate him. The Mountain Tiger came from a top great force. As long as he could survive, he would certainly make a name for himself in the future. Offending him at this point would do no good for Mystic Sect. 𝑵𝗈𝐯𝓮𝓵𝒏𝖾xt.𝑐𝗈𝑚</p><p>Just then, Wang Yang was heard saying, “Just tell him the truth as it is. Since we’ve done such a thing, we shouldn’t be afraid to let him know. If he’s clever enough, he’ll know what to do.”</p><p>Upon getting Wang Yang’s permission, Chu Tian pulled himself together and sent another message. ‘All of us are heading to Nine Star Clan’s station at this moment. As soon as Dong Shu Ye receives the news, he will immediately come back here. So, Brother Yi Ye, you must try your best to survive!’</p><p>Looking at the message, Lu Ye was somewhat doubtful. The mainstay of Nine Star Clan, Dong Shu Ye, had just left his place to hunt him down, but on the other hand, those from Mystic Sect went all out to launch an attack on their enemies’ station, which was too coincidental.</p><p>It was as though those from Mystic Sect had been waiting for this chance. Moreover, they had even invited him to join the celebratory banquet on the previous night. Lu Ye had no idea whether they would be able to occupy the Nine Star Clan’s station, but since they had decided to do so, they must have some confidence in achieving their goal.</p><p>When he was still in Split Sky Gorge, it was inconvenient for Dong Shu Ye to make a move because they were too close to the Mystic Sect’s station, which might prompt them to intervene. Therefore, if Dong Shu Ye wanted to kill Lu Ye, he had to wait for the latter to leave Split Sky Gorge first. However, only Chu Tian was aware that Lu Ye was leaving. How did Dong Shu Ye find out about it and race after him?</p><p>[Have they made use of me?] That was the only possibility Lu Ye could think of. After giving it a thought, he sent a message to Chu Tian. ‘We’re even now.’</p><p>Then, he decidedly blacklisted him. Although he was pretty sure that he had been used, he didn’t blame anyone. In fact, he was the one who had ignited the war in Split Sky Gorge. The fact that he had killed the Young Master of Nine Star Clan had caused the two great forces to clash with one another.</p><p>If Mystic Sect hadn’t interfered in this matter, given Nine Star Clan’s heritage, Lu Ye might not be able to counter them. At the very least, he had to deal with a large number of cultivators, some of whom were Fifth-Order cultivators. Mystic Sect’s intervention had spared Lu Ye the fate of facing the entire great force on his own. After the war commenced, he had saved quite some disciples from Mystic Sect, but he had never looted anything on the battlefield. He had only demanded some useful pills and stones from the disciples he had saved.</p><p>It could be said that Lu Ye and the disciples from Mystic Sect had been helping one another out. Therefore, even though those from Mystic Sect had taken advantage of him in the end, he wouldn’t blame them as he was the one who had caused the trouble.</p><p>His connection with Mystic Sect should stop here. Anyway, those from Mystic Sect had lent him a hand, and he had saved their disciples. He had also gotten an Earth Grade cultivation technique from them, which solved an urgent problem. Now that he had been used, he reckoned that they were even, and they should stop contacting one another.</p><p>Walking alongside those from Mystic Sect, Chu Tian sported a bitter expression and heaved a sigh.</p><p>“What did he say?” Wang Yang was heard saying.</p><p>Chu Tian replied honestly, “He said that we’re even now… and removed my brand from his Imprint.”</p><p>That made Chu Tian feel dejected. After all, Lu Ye was from a top great force, so the average person rarely had the chance to come into contact with him.</p><p>Wang Yang’s lips curved into a smile. “He’s a clever person. Interesting.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
