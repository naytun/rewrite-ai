Then, the tiger hadn’t shown any anomalies until this time.</p><p>After giving it a thought, Yi Yi replied, “I don’t think so.” Then, she turned her head. “Amber, can you use any spells?”</p><p>In response, Amber howled.</p><p>Yi Yi went on to say, “It said it can’t.”</p><p>The corner of Lu Ye’s mouth twitched as he still hadn’t figured out how Yi Yi was able to communicate with the tiger. It was amazing that she could understand the tiger through the noises it made. It was probably her unique capability as a Ghost Spirit. Lu Ye stopped asking as he was only curious about it upon recalling this matter. After he was done with having his meal, he started cultivating again while Amber had dozed off beside him. It remained silent throughout the night.</p><p>In the station of Mystic Sect, following Lu Ye’s demands, Chu Tian was collecting some pills and food from the other disciples. Because of that, word got out that the Mountain Tiger, Yi Ye, was leaving. Before the break of dawn, Chu Tian contacted Lu Ye and confirmed his location before heading over to meet him with two Junior Brothers. After the exchange, Lu Ye obtained lots of food and about 200 Spirit Restoring Pills.</p><p>At that moment, the sky was completely bright. After Lu Ye got onto the tiger’s back, Chu Tian cupped his fists and uttered, “Good bye. Please contact me when you’re free.”</p><p>After Lu Ye dipped his head, Amber charged forward and went further into Split Sky Gorge. Watching Lu Ye leave, Chu Tian suddenly became envious of him because Lu Ye was carefree as a rogue cultivator. However, he came from a top great force, which was why he had the confidence and heritage to survive. If Chu Tian were to do the same, he wouldn’t have lasted for a few months. After returning to the station with his Junior Brothers, he found out that Wang Yang was looking for him, so he hurriedly went over.</p><p>When he arrived at his destination, he realised that something was unusual. All the people in the station had gathered together. Besides their own disciples, even the rogue cultivators that relied on their Sect were also there. Presently, a few hundred people had assembled on a square. Wang Yang was standing there with a straight back, and he was holding the hilt of a sword as though he was waiting for something. The atmosphere around the place was sombre.</p><p>Chu Tian walked over and cupped his fists. “Senior Brother.”</p><p>“Has the Mountain Tiger left?” Wang Yang asked.</p><p>“Yes,” Chu Tian replied.</p><p>Wang Yang nodded slightly with a gratified expression on his face. “That’s great. Join them now.” He seemed to wish that Lu Ye could’ve left sooner.</p><p>“Yes!” Chu Tian got into the formation as he was puzzled by the current situation. However, Wang Yang must be going to do something important by gathering everyone together. Chu Tian had a speculation in mind, but in that case, there was going to be an epic battle on this day.</p><p>Time went by slowly. One hour later, Wang Yang, who had been standing there for a long time, suddenly arched his brow and shouted, “Both Mystic Sect and Nine Star Clan have been stationed here for 30 years. During this period of time, we’ve gotten into countless battles, and there have been deaths on both sides. The blood feud between us is basically unresolvable. Even though we’ve won the battle in Split Sky Gorge, we’ll never be able to live a peaceful life as long as Nine Star Clan is around. Therefore, I intend to invade Nine Star Clan’s station, and I hope that all of you will lend me a hand!”</p><p>Upon hearing that, all of them broke into commotion. It had only been one day since the war ended, so they were shocked to learn that Wang Yang intended to invade Nine Star Clan’s station. Mystic Sect had just won the battle, so they should be celebrating their victory instead of creating trouble again at this point. It wasn’t easy to raid a station, which was protected by a Grand Array. Without breaking the array first, they would never be able to enter the station. However, recalling what Wang Yang had been doing over the years, they realised that he must have come up with such a plan in advance.</p><p>Chu Tian was the first one to raise his arms and shout, “Senior Brother, I’m willing to go with you to strengthen Mystic Sect’s power!”</p><p>The others also roared in unison. “Senior Brother, we’re willing to go with you to strengthen Mystic Sect’s power!” 𝑵𝗈𝐯𝓮𝓵𝒏𝖾xt.𝑐𝗈𝑚</p><p>Standing at the front of these people, Wang Yang put on a smile. “That’s great.”</p><p>Then, he turned to look at Chu Tian. “Send a message to Mountain Tiger and inform him that Dong Shu Ye has gone over to hunt him down an hour ago.”</p><p>.</p><p>Upon hearing that, Chu Tian was astounded by the fact that Dong Shu Ye was so brazen. At the same time, he was surprised by Wang Yang’s ability to gather information. Dong Shu Ye was the strongest cultivator who was in charge of the Nine Star Clan’s station. With him around, the station was safe. However, if he wasn’t around, the defence around the station would weaken.</p><p>It seemed that the death of Nine Star Clan’s Young Master had greatly humiliated them. They could concede defeat in the war against Mystic Sect, but they were determined to kill Mountain Tiger. Otherwise, Dong Shu Ye wouldn’t have taken the risk to leave the station and hunt Lu Ye down. He must have left secretly lest those from Mystic Sect were given a chance to invade them. Despite that, Wang Yang had still found out about it. Apparently, they must have made some arrangements outside Nine Star Clan’s station. As soon as Dong Shu Ye left the place, Wang Yang would immediately receive the news.</p><p>Then, Chu Tian recalled that some of the disciples were not around during the celebratory banquet on the previous night. Nevertheless, how did Dong Shu Ye find out that Mountain Tiger had left? Chu Tian wasn’t a fool, so he immediately realised what had happened. Someone from Mystic Sect must have leaked the news.</p><p>It was no wonder that when he reported to Wang Yang regarding Mountain Tiger’s demands on the previous night, the latter told him to collect the items from other disciples. It was actually easier to get the items from the headquarters. When he was collecting the pills and food, many people asked him about the reason behind it. He didn’t intend to hide anything, so he told them that Lu Ye was going to leave. The disciples from Mystic Sect wouldn’t share any information with Nine Star Clan, so the person who had leaked the news must be one of those rogue cultivators who had been staying in their station.</p><p>While he was in his thoughts, Wang Yang suddenly stared at a particular cultivator and uttered, “Shi Jun, do you have anything to say?”</p><p>The rogue cultivator called Shi Jun had his forehead drenched in sweat. With an apprehensive expression, he replied, “N-No…”</p><p>However, Wang Yang only kept gaping at him.</p><p>Shi Jun became more anxious as he exclaimed, “Senior Brother Wang, please forgive me!”</p><p>“It seems that you really have nothing to say.”</p><p>Then, Wang Yang flicked at the sword by his side, whereupon the sword left the sheath with a swish and turned into a beam of light. The next instant, it reached Shi Jun and circled around his neck, after which his body became as hard as a stone. When the sword light returned to the sheath, Shi Jun’s head fell to the ground, and blood spurted out of his neck. Following that, the headless corpse collapsed to the ground. The turn of events caused all the rogue cultivators to be covered in cold sweat as they stared at Wang Yang in shock.</p><p>There was a cold expression on Wang Yang’s face when he explained, “Shi Jun had joined us as a rogue cultivator, but he was actually a mole from Nine Star Clan. I killed him on this day to serve as a warning, so I hope all of you will behave yourselves.”</p><p>All of them couldn’t believe what they had heard, but recalling Shi Jun’s last words, they realised that it was indeed the truth. The fact that Shi Jun had begged for mercy suggested that he was feeling guilty.</p><p>“Let’s go. We’ll destroy the Nine Star Clan now!” Wang Yang waved his hand.</p><p>A moment later, hundreds of cultivators from Mystic Sect streamed out of the place, leaving the empty station behind.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
