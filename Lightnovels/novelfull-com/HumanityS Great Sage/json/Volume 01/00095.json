A soothing scent wafted from her body.</p><p>Lu Ye replied, “I feel much better now.”</p><p>“I’ll have a look.” Hua Ci sat her fleshy backside on the bed and lifted his sleeves to examine the wounds on his arms. Following that, she unbuttoned his collar to take a glance at his chest before nodding. “Not bad.”</p><p>Then, she fished out something from her Storage Bag and put it on the bedside table before saying, “Take off your top.”</p><p>Lu Ye’s top was tattered and drenched in blood. Previously, he was too focused on healing his wounds, so he had forgotten to change into new clothes. Now, upon hearing what she had said, he obediently took off his top.</p><p>As Hua Ci got ready with the thing she had just taken out, she said, “Your arms and chest are severely burned, so I can’t dress them up yet. I’ll apply some herbs on them for the next few days.”</p><p>“Alright,” Lu Ye replied.</p><p>“Stretch out your hands,” Hua Ci uttered.</p><p>Lu Ye extended his hands, which revealed his arms that were covered in green herbal juice. It was supposed to have been applied to his arms on the previous day. At that time, he was still unconscious.</p><p>Then, Hua Ci used something to clean his arms before applying the same kind of green herbal juice again. After she was done with his arms, she went on to apply the juice on his chest. There was a cut on his back, which wasn’t handled in the same way. Lu Ye recalled that she had pasted a plaster on his back on the previous day, which made him feel itchy all day. When it was time to handle the wound on his back, she told him to turn around and said, “Bear with it.”</p><p>Before Lu Ye could reply to her, he heard a tearing sound coming from his back. She must have peeled off the plaster from the previous day. Instantly, he felt a sharp pain in his wound, which caused him to tremble and become drenched in cold sweat. This woman called Hua Ci was always soft in her tone, but she was ruthless whenever she made a move.</p><p>A green light started flickering again as a fluctuation of Spiritual Power was felt. An astonished Lu Ye turned his head and faintly saw something. Upon realising something, he asked, “Senior Sister, are you a medicine cultivator?”</p><p>Previously, Pang Da Hai from Righteous Sect had told him that cultivators were categorised into six major factions: body tempering cultivators who focused on training their bodies; combat cultivators who focused on close-quarters combat; spell cultivators who studied all kinds of spells; medicine cultivators who healed the wounded; ghost cultivators who could communicate with the supernatural beings; and external cultivators who studied making pills, drawing talisman papers, setting up arrays, and forging artifacts. Most cultivators were weak in the beginning, so they would focus on combat cultivation. With a weapon in their hand, they could better protect themselves when they were still weak. It was also easier for them to walk around Spirit Creek Battlefield.</p><p>However, during this period of time, cultivators could make some preparation according to their own attributes and preferences. When they became powerful enough, they could choose a faction to focus on.</p><p>The cultivators Lu Ye had seen in Split Sky Gorge were mostly combat cultivators. Only Luo Ji had established himself as a spell cultivator when he was only in the Second-Order. That was because he was from a top great force, so he had the kind of heritage and wealth most people lacked. Dong Shu Ye was also a spell cultivator, but he was already in the Seventh-Order.</p><p>Now, Lu Ye had come across another cultivator who had confirmed her faction, and she was a medicine cultivator. It was no wonder that she could heal him.</p><p>“Yes,” Hua Ci replied. “What’s wrong? Do you hate medicine cultivators?”</p><p>Lu Ye hurriedly said, “No. I only have grudges against some spell cultivators.” He secretly swore that whenever he bumped into a spell cultivator that he hated in the future, he would kill the person first.</p><p>With her mouth covered, Hua Ci giggled. “I can see that.” Lu Ye’s wounds were obviously caused by powerful spells. As a medicine cultivator whose job was to heal the injured, she could make a judgement by just looking at the wounds.</p><p>As she directed more Spiritual Power into his body, Lu Ye could feel that the pain on his back diminished. Eventually, his wounds only became itchy. After she stopped, she pasted a new plaster on his back.</p><p>Following that, she started dealing with the wounds on his chest and arms. It was then Lu Ye could clearly see that as her hands hovered above his wounds, her palms radiated a green glow. With the nourishment of her Wood attribute, his wounds slowly healed. This was indeed an amazing way to treat a patient.</p><p>She was an alluring lady with a curvy figure and a pleasant voice. Certainly, Lu Ye didn’t feel bored during the treatment.</p><p>A moment later, she stopped what she was doing and rose from the bed. “Alright. Today’s session is over.” Then, she extended her hand. “Ten Spirit Stones, please.”</p><p>A puzzled Lu Ye looked up at her. “Huh?”</p><p>A smiling Hua Ci said, “Every treatment costs five stones. You were knackered yesterday, so I didn’t tell you about it. Including the fee today, it’s ten stones in total.”</p><p>“You charge a fee?” Lu Ye was stunned.</p><p>She went on to say, “I have to buy you the herbs, and I need pills and stones to restore my Spiritual Power, so… I do charge a fee.”</p><p>At that, Lu Ye was rendered speechless.</p><p>“You’re a disciple from a top great force, so I believe that you won’t renege on your debt, right?” Her hand obstinately and firmly remained stretched out.</p><p>“Of course I won’t.” Lu Ye had no idea how she had figured out that he was a disciple from a top great force, but she had a valid point. They were not friends or relatives. Since she had spent time and energy treating him, he certainly had to pay a fee.</p><p>Coming across a medicine cultivator here had undoubtedly saved him a lot of time of recuperation. Taking that into consideration, he had actually gained some benefits.</p><p>“I don’t have Spirit Stones. Do you take Spirit Pills?” Lu Ye asked.</p><p>“Sure.” Hua Ci nodded.</p><p>Then, he fished out a bottle of ten pills and passed it to her.</p><p>“Thanks.” Upon taking the pills, Hua Ci became elated.</p><p>Lu Ye was so worried that she would say something like ‘Please come again’ the next moment.</p><p>“Take a rest, then,” she uttered. “I’ll come back tomorrow to treat your wounds again.”</p><p>Before she pushed the door open, she turned her head and said, “If you can make use of Healing Pills, you’ll recover more quickly.”</p><p>“Got it.” Lu Ye dipped his head. 𝐧𝔬𝑣𝑬𝓵𝓝𝑒xt.𝒸𝑜𝓂</p><p>For the next few days, Lu Ye remained bed ridden. In the morning, the young woman called Ling Yu would send him the extremely bitter herbal juice. In the evening, Hua Ci would come over to heal his wounds.</p><p>The young woman’s full name was Ruan Ling Yu. She was a pretty vivacious and talkative girl. After some chats with her, Lu Ye learned that this place was the ruins of a great force.</p><p>No one knew which great force it was. Several dozen years ago, this place was invaded and the entire great force was destroyed. Although a Divine Opportunity Column remained, it was no longer usable.</p><p>This made Lu Ye recall the time when the Sect Master sent him to Spirit Creek Battlefield from the middle of nowhere. That place seemed to be the ruins of a great force as well.</p><p>There were countless such ruins in both Jiu Zhou and Spirit Creek Battlefield. Whenever a new great force emerged, they would pick one of the ruins to be their base. That was because there was most likely a Divine Opportunity Column.</p><p>However, many ruins remained deserted, which then became the gathering places for rogue cultivators.</p><p>Although most of the buildings in these ruins were dilapidated, there were still many places that could fend off the rain. Moreover, most of them were strategically located, which was why homeless rogue cultivators loved staying in these places.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
