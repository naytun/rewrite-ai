He also understood why his fourth senior brother was able to control a hundred flying weapons at Heaven</p><p>-Grade Eighth-Order.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Ye also discovered that Li Baxian’s methods weren’t fully compatible with him. They required a certain degree of natural talent that he lacked.</p><p>That said, just because Li Baxian’s methods weren’t compatible with him didn’t mean that he couldn’t make use of any of them. One night of tutoring was enough to improve his Way of Telekinesis to a whole new level.</p><p>A sword light was currently flying over countless peaks. Li Baxian was flying in the direction of the sun with a Storage Bag in his hand.</p><p>It wasn’t his own Storage Bag. It was something Lu Ye had gifted to him prior to his departure.</p><p>Seeing no reason to reject his junior brother’s gift, he had accepted it without hesitation.</p><p>There was no Restriction Lock on the Storage Bag, so Li Baxin was able to open it like he was opening a mortal bag. He soon produced a bottle from it.</p><p>The bottle was tightly sealed and slapped with a label. Li Baxian’s composure faltered a little when he saw the three words on the label.</p><p>It was the Soul Cleansing Water.</p><p>Li Baxin’s pupils narrowed in shock. He was no newbie in cultivation, so of course he knew what the Soul Cleansing Water was. He even knew that it was the reason his second senior sister, Shui Yuan was able to ascend to Divine Ocean Realm.</p><p>He never thought he would receive a gift like this, however.</p><p>Just how much Soul Cleaning Water did his junior brother receive from the Lost City of Xianyuan?</p><p>Li Baxian uncorked the bottle and gave it a sniff. The bottle was half-full, and it gave off a unique scent that immediately refreshed Li Baxia’s mind. Even his perception felt a tad sharper.</p><p>If he were to translate it into drops, half a bottle of Soul Cleansing Water was worth a dozen or so droplets at least. It was a highly sought after treasure even by Divine Ocean Realm cultivators.</p><p>It was honestly a bit too much.</p><p>Lu Ye had exited the Lost City of Xianyuan with almost three and a half bottles of Soul Cleansing Water. The first bottle was missing a few drops because he had used them to save Ju Jia and Zhao Li’s life. He then gave the bottle to Shui Yuan.</p><p>For the second bottle, he had gifted half to Bai Qian and used up the rest in the Hundred Wards Tower.</p><p>The third bottle—the one with only half in it—was given to Yi Yi. Yi Yi was an apparition, so the Soul Cleansing Water was one of the best cultivation resources she could hope to get. It would allow her to increase the strength of her Divine Soul in tandem with her cultivation level.</p><p>The last bottle had been split into two halves. He gave half to Li Baxian and he kept the other half to himself in case he needed it for something.</p><p>With this, all the Soul Cleansing Water he had brought out of the Lost City of Xianyuan had been distributed accordingly.</p><p>Li Baxian shook his head, smiling. His junior brother had purposely kept the bottle in a Storage Bag because he was afraid that he would turn down the gift.</p><p>He put away the Soul Cleansing Water carefully before inspecting the Storage Bag again. To his surprise, it wasn’t the only gift his junior brother had in store for him.</p><p>He took it—no, them—out. His expression turned completely serious when he saw what they were.</p><p>It was a pair of ancient-looking wooden boxes. He knew them so well he could probably craft the boxes by hand if he knew woodwork.</p><p>It was because he checked its remaining stock nearly every time he entered the Vault of Providence. It was one thing if the stock count remained the same, but each time someone bought it, he could only stew in helplessness and frustration. Today, there were only eight of them left.</p><p>Or were there?</p><p>There weren’t many things that could throw Li Baxian off, and this was one of them. His hands started trembling slightly.</p><p>If this really was the treasure he had been eyeing this whole time, then he would not know how to even begin to repay his junior brother. The half a bottle of Soul Cleansing Water was precious, but they were incomparable to the two boxes he was holding. They were what he needed to cure the wound that had plagued him for over a decade.</p><p>He sucked in a deep breath and opened one of the boxes. He immediately saw the perfectly sealed Spirit Pill within the wooden box. He checked the other box and found the same thing.</p><p>The sword light stopped in its tracks. Right now, Li Baxian’s heart felt as full as his hands.</p><p>It was real. He really was holding the treasure of his dreams—the Point Restoration Pill.</p><p>As the name suggested, the Spirit Pill was used to repair broken Spiritual Points.</p><p>A broken Spiritual Point wasn’t an irreparable wound, but it might as well be considering the price one must pay to buy it. How many cultivators in the world could earn a hundred and fifty thousand Contribution Points?</p><p>That was why Dong Shuye had fallen into despair after losing Spiritual Points. It was because he knew he would never be able to repair them anymore.</p><p>Similarly, Li Baxian was stuck at the Spirit Creek Realm for over a decade after losing his Spiritual Point.</p><p>Was he incapable of ascending to the Cloud River Realm?</p><p>Of course not. Any cultivator could ascend to Cloud River Realm once they had converted into a Heaven-Grade cultivation technique and met the lowest requirement of two hundred and forty Spiritual Points.</p><p>However, ascending to the Cloud River Realm like this would greatly impact one’s future. They would essentially be crippling their own strength and potential.</p><p>That was why old school Spirit Creek Realm cultivators were quite common in the Inner Circle, but almost non-existent in the Core Circle. Practically everyone who operated within the Core Circle had converted to a Heaven-Grade cultivation technique, and those who had reached a certain age and the basic requirement at least would choose to ascend to the Cloud River Realm.</p><p>The Cultivation Jiu Zhou had done a worldwide survey before. It was concluded that a cultivator who ascended to the Cloud River Realm with less than three hundred Spiritual Points would only have a thirty percent chance to ascend to the True Lake Realm. Moreover, their chances of ascending to the Divine Ocean Realm was a big fat zero.</p><p>On the other hand, those who ascended to the Cloud River Realm with three hundred or more Spiritual Points would have a seventy percent chance to ascend to the True Lake Realm. Their chances to ascend to the Divine Ocean Realm were pretty good as well.</p><p>As for those who managed to ascend to the Cloud River Realm with a maximum of three hundred and sixty Spiritual Points, their chances of becoming a Divine Ocean Realm cultivator was as high as eighty percent if they didn’t perish midway!</p><p>Li Baxian had only lost a single Spiritual Point. He had unlocked the remaining three hundred and fifty nine Spiritual Points a long time ago. If he wanted to, he would be a Cloud River Realm cultivator already.</p><p>However, he remained as he was because he could not accept ascending to the next level as anything but his best.</p><p>Back in the day, he was heralded as one of Jiu Zhou’s best cultivators. He was a Heaven-Grade Eighth-Order cultivator who could control a hundred flying weapons and the second runner-up on the Scroll of Supremacy. Therefore, how could he accept ascending to the Cloud River Realm in his cripplied state and lowering his own potential?</p><p>He would rather stay at the Spirit Creek Realm and slowly accumulate the necessary amount of Contribution Points to purchase the Point Restoration Pill, and he did for over a decade. In fact, he wasn’t far away from a hundred and fifty thousand Contribution Points.</p><p>If there was one thing that he was worried about, it would be the Point Restoration Pills going out of stock before he could accumulate enough Contribution Points.</p><p>Today, the worry that had plagued him for years was gone like the wind. He didn’t have just one Point Restoration Pill. He had two!</p><p>This was a gift worth three hundred thousand Contribution Points. It was an astronomical number to say the least. With these two Point Restoration Pills, he had a one hundred percent chance of restoring his broken Spiritual Point and ascend to the Cloud River Realm in his best form. Even a decade of wasted time was but a trifle considering his extraordinary talent and cultivation speed.</p><p>It took a while for Li Baxian to regain his calm. Lu Ye’s gift was priceless beyond even his wildest imagination.</p><p>Be it the Soul Cleansing Water and the Point Restoration Pill, they were priceless treasures that a Spirit Creek Realm cultivator should never be able to obtain. And yet, Lu Ye did it.</p><p>After a thought, he tapped on his Battlefield Imprint and messaged, “Thank you, junior brother!”</p><p>Back at the headquarters, Lu Ye was in the middle of discussing the next step to develop the sect when he received the message from Li Baxian. He smiled but did not respond to it. Thanks were unnecessary between family members.</p><p>Suddenly, Shui Yuan asked, “I noticed that there were only six Pill Restoration Pills left in the Vault of Providence a while ago. Was it you?”</p><p>“Yeah. You mentioned that Brother Li’s Spiritual Point had been damaged for too long, and just one Point Restoration Pill might not be enough to repair it fully, right? That was why I bought two.”</p><p>Lu Ye had found it strange when he heard that Li Baxian would stay at the Spirit Creek Battlefield as a Heaven-Grade Eighth-Order cultivator for over a decade. He only learned about his fourth senior brother’s predicament after asking discreetly about it.</p><p>It wasn’t a secret anyway. Anyone could’ve told him what happened.</p><p>Later on, he brought this up to Shui Yuan during a casual conversation and was told that there existed a Spirit Pill in the Vault of Providence that could repair it. However, it was too expensive for any one cultivator to pay. If Li Baxian was still with the Crimson Blood Sect, then of course the sect would do everything in its power to help him. However, he was with the Devoted Ones right now, so the situation was complicated to say the least. Not only could he not receive any external help, his means of earning Contribution Points were extremely limited. As a result, Li Baxian was unable to accumulate the Contribution Points necessary to purchase a Point Restoration Pill even over a decade later.</p><p>Since then, Lu Ye had plotted to help his fourth senior brother.</p><p>During the Battle of Goldentip, it was Wei Yuan and Shui Yuan who bore the Judgment of the Heavens and saved his life. And it was Li Baxian who came all the way from the Core Circle to protect him.</p><p>As a Spirit Creek Realm cultivator, killing a cultivator much lower than your cultivation level would result in a loss of Contribution Points. However, Li Baxian hadn’t held back against his enemies in the slightest. Lu Ye even remembered his first senior sister, Wei Yuan warning Li Baxian to cool his horses and not deduct all of his Contribution Points by accident.</p><p>Lu Ye hadn’t known Shui Yuan or Li Baxian until then, but they still protected him at great cost to themselves just because he was a disciple of the Crimson Blood Sect.</p><p>That was the moment Lu Ye learned that he wasn’t alone, that someone would always have his back, and that he had a home in this big, wide Cultivation World.</p><p>One Point Restoration Pill might not be enough to heal Li Baxian completely because his Spiritual Point had been broken for too long. In that case, he purchased two!</p><p>So what if he spent three hundred Contribution Points to get them? It was nothing compared to his senior brother’s wellbeing.</p><p>This was why Lu Ye had been accumulating Contribution Points like a madman all this time. It was because the amount he needed to achieve his goal was enormous.</p><p>At first, his plan was to slowly take revenge on the sects who had wronged him one by one and slowly accumulate the amount he needed. However, his breakthrough in the Way of Wards and ward breaching provided him with a swift way to accumulate Contribution Points.</p><p>In a sense, he got very lucky.</p><p>“Thank you for your hard work,” Shui Yuan said while hiding her expression.</p><p>Just like Li Baxian, she often checked the remaining stock of Point Restoration Pills left in the Vault of Providence. She would not have noticed it so quickly otherwise.</p><p>“We are family.” Lu Ye shook his head before changing the subject. “So, what do you think about my plans, senior sister? There is no way we can rely on our current members if we wish to develop our sect further. Most of our disciples were independent cultivators, and none of their talents are particularly impressive. Their loyalty is unequaled, but the heart can only go so far. Not only do we need a constant influx of new blood, we need exceptional ones so that the sect does not lack Cloud River Realm and True Lake Realm cultivators in the future.”</p><p>“You are correct.” Shui Yuan nodded. “Just leave this to me. I will hold a recruitment ceremony in the near future. It’s been decades since we did one, so all nearby talents have been going to our neighbors. I suppose it’s time to change that.”</p><p>“I look forward to it, senior sister.”</p><p>While saying this, Lu Ye pulled out a couple of Storage Bags and handed them to Shui Yuan. “This is the loot I had obtained during my conquests. Please deal with it as you see fit. I’m sure you’ll be able to use it both for our sect’s development and our disciples’ cultivation.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
