Now that he knew that the other tattoos were fake and experienced his opponents their strength, there was no need to hold back any longer.</p><p>He crouched slightly and kept his saber pointed diagonally toward the ground. Then, he empowered himself with Windwalk and took off like a crack of thunder.</p><p>Sensing Lu Yes killing intent, the mutant cultivator hurriedly called out, I</p><p>Roar! Amber made its first move ever in this battle, but this time the tigers roar didnt affect the mutant cultivator nearly as much as it should have. He blanked out for only an instant before he recovered and finished his call for surrender.</p><p>Lu Ye dashed past the mutant cultivator and slashed his neck with an Inviolable that was empowered by two Sharp Edges. However, an invisible energy had already wrapped the mutant cultivator. It prevented the fatal attack from doing even the slightest bit of damage to the mutant cultivator.</p><p>It was the protection of the Heavens!</p><p>The mutant cultivator rubbed his neck in terror as his figure swiftly turned transparent. Soon, he was out of the battlefield.</p><p>He escaped? Yi Yi asked while showing herself.</p><p>Lu Ye nodded his head slightly.</p><p>In fact, he had already noticed this problem when he fought Zhuo Jianchen before. The stronger the ranker, the more resistant they were against Ambers roar, and the harder they were to kill.</p><p>In fact, Zhuo Jianchen had managed to call for surrender at the same time Lu Ye had beheaded him. The sword cultivator could have saved his own life if he was just a little faster.</p><p>The mutant cultivator was seventeen ranks above Zhuo Jianchen. Naturally, he was stronger and more resistant toward Ambers roar.</p><p>Should I help out during the next battle? Yi Yi asked.</p><p>Sure!</p><p>After challenging the Scroll of Supremacy for the past few days, Lu Ye now had a clear idea of his exact strength. He should not have too much trouble defeating his opponents, but killing them was probably going to be impossible very soon. That was why he decided to accept Yi Yis offer to help.</p><p>After they returned to the wooden building, Lu Ye took a short rest before issuing his next challenge.</p><p>At the same time, the Thousand Demon Ridge finally figured out how Lu Yi Ye was able to kill every ranker he had fought. It was because his Tamed Beasts roar could attack the Divine Soul. No wonder the rankers werent able to surrender before they were killed.</p><p>It wasnt until the former seventeenth ranker had escaped by the skin of his teeth that they finally gained the intel.</p><p>Thanks to the mutant cultivators intel, the Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators who ranked above him were finally able to relax. They were certain they werent inferior to the mutant cultivator. If he could survive Lu Yi Ye, then they could too.</p><p>What happened next stunned everyone, however. The sixteenth, fourteenth and eleventh Thousand Demon Ridge rankers had all been killed by Lu Yi Ye.</p><p>Practically everyone within this range belonged to a Tier-One sect. They also had an extremely high chance of entering the Divine Ocean Realm in the future. Now, that future had been cut short.</p><p>The sect elders of those rankers were all incredibly sad that their disciples were slain by Lu Yi Ye. The Thousand Demon Ridges hatred for him deepened even more.</p><p>They also did not understand why the seventeenth ranker had survived when the other three above him had died.</p><p>To date, no one knew that Yi Yi was teleported into the Scroll of Supremacys battlefield alongside Lu Ye because everyone who saw her had died. With Yi Yi acting as the knife in the back, none of these Thousand Demon Ridge rankers were able to survive the match even if they were strong enough to resist Ambers roar.</p><p>Now, Lu Yi Ye of the Crimson Blood Sect was sitting on the eleventh spot of the Scroll of Supremacy. He only needed to advance one more placement to enter the top ten.</p><p>In fact, there were multiple benchmarks in the Scroll of Supremacy. The fiftieth spot was a benchmark, the thirtieth spot was another benchmark, and the tenth spot was the final benchmark. The difference in strength between one cultivator above the benchmark and another who was below was massive.</p><p>If Lu Yi Ye really managed to enter the top ten, then it meant he was qualified to enter the strongest echelon of the Spirit Creek Realm.</p><p>The last Heaven Eight cultivator to enter the top ten was Li Baxian, but his situation was special. He was originally a Heaven Nine cultivator until his Spiritual Point was damaged, and his cultivation level dropped. If Lu Yi Ye managed to win his next match, then he would be the first true Heaven Eight cultivator to enter the strongest echelon of the Spirit Creek Realm!</p><p>Everyone knew that Lu Ye wasnt going to challenge the tenth ranker on the Scroll of Supremacy because they belonged to the Grand Sky Coalition. His next target was the ninth-placed Gui Yingzi!</p><p>Everyone was watching with bated breaths. Everyone wanted to know if a top ten ranker would be strong enough to stop Lu Yi Yes advance.</p><p>It was at this moment Lu Yi Ye defied everyones expectations by suddenly going AWOL for more than half a day straight. Gui Yingzi reported that he had not received a challenge request either.</p><p>While the Thousand Demon Ridge was glad to postpone the inevitable, it only gave rise to more worry.</p><p>It was clear that the eleventh spot would not be Lu Yi Yes final stop. The only reason he temporarily stopped advancing was because he was resting. He wanted to enter the next battle in the best possible condition.</p><p>Their guess was spot on. Lu Ye had barely rested since he restarted his climb, and the top ten rankers on the Scroll of Supremacy were literally the ten best cultivators in the entire Spirit Creek Battlefield. Naturally, he wasnt going to fight them in less-than-optimal condition. A cultivators performance wasnt just determined by their cultivation level, but also their status and their ability to improvise in the middle of combat.</p><p>At the courtyard, Hua Ci had once again cooked a tableful of strange dishes he had never even seen before. Still, Lu Ye did not hesitate to consume them all. Whatever strange plant or creature they were made from, they all tasted fantastic to his taste buds.</p><p>Of course, this was only possible because he possessed the Tree of Glyphs. Generally speaking, only someone with incredible detoxification abilities could enjoy Hua Cis food.</p><p>Lu Ye was leaning against his chair and letting out a satisfied burp when suddenly, he recalled something and looked at Hua Ci. Arent you going to challenge the Scroll of Supremacy?</p><p>He knew little about Hua Cis current strength or even the techniques she used, but she had more than proven her strength by making it all the way to the Myriad Poison Forest alone and killing Heavens know how many Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators on the way. Most people didnt even know what killed them before they died. If he had to choose between Hua Ci and the current number one of the Scroll of Supremacy as his final opponent, he would choose the current number one every time.</p><p>In other words, Hua Ci was qualified to challenge the Scroll of Supremacy.</p><p>Theres no hurry, Hua Ci replied, unconcerned, while putting away the dishes with Yi Yi. My cultivation level is still a little lacking. Ill think about it when Im Heaven Nine.</p><p>How many more Spiritual Points do you need? Lu Ye asked.</p><p>Twenty to thirty, give or take? Hua Ci shot him a smirk before leaving.</p><p>Lu Yes eyes twitched once. By now, he had noticed that Hua Cis cultivation was growing at an unbelievable rate since he came to the Myriad Poison Forest. His cultivation level used to be leagues ahead of hers, but now they were both Heaven Eight cultivators. Even better, she had somehow unlocked more Spiritual Points than him and surpassed him.</p><p>Sure, he hadnt spent much time cultivating as of late due to the Scroll of Supremacy, but objectively speaking, he did not think he could keep up with her even if he had devoted all of his time to cultivating.</p><p>[What on earth is her inheritance?]</p><p>After resting for a full day and entering peak form, Lu Ye connected his mind to the Scroll of Supremacy and issued the ninth ranker on the Scroll of Supremacy a challenge request.</p><p>His opponent accepted his challenge. A while later, the Heavens enveloped him, Yi Yi and Amber and teleported them to the battlefield.</p><p>The battlefield this time was over five kilometers in radius and filled with large trees and thick foliage. It was a forest.</p><p>This battlefield actually reminded Lu Ye of the Misty Mountains. It was perfect for concealing oneself.</p><p>Considering his opponent was named Gui Yingzi (Ghastly Shadow), Lu Ye knew that he was probably a ghost cultivator. That was why he wasnt surprised in the least when he saw the forest around him. ùò≠ùíæùí∑ùìáùò¶ùëéùëë.ùí∏‚Ñ¥ùìÇ</p><p>Yi Yi had already left to search for Gui Yingzi. Lu Ye threw a couple Spirit Pills into his mouth and grabbed a book from his Storage Bag after he found a clean place to sit</p><p>Time passed bit by bit. For the first time, Yi Yis efforts had not borne fruit. Despite scouring through the entire battlefield several times with a fine tooth comb, it was as if Gui Yingzi had vanished from the battlefield.</p><p>Lu Ye hadnt been attacked either. He had been cultivating and reading this whole time.</p><p>Lu Ye had fought some ghost cultivators in the previous battles, but they never waited too long before skulking to Lu Yes location and attempting to end his life in one strike. Naturally, none of them lived to see another day.</p><p>This ghost cultivator, on the other hand, was a little different from what he had come to expect. Not only did he hide himself so well that even Yi Yi couldnt find him, he had not approached Lu Ye recklessly.</p><p>Lu Ye was sure the ghost cultivator was observing him from nearby though. His senses were informing him that he was being watched.</p><p>Unfortunately, it was not enough to identify the ghost cultivators location.</p><p>On a tree over a hundred meters away from Lu Yes location, Gui Yingzi was clinging to a branch and watching Lu Ye silently like a ghost.</p><p>This was a battlefield, and yet Lu Yi Ye was reading a book like he was on a camping trip. It was obvious the combat cultivator was trying to bait him to get closer.</p><p>As the strongest ghost cultivator not just on the Scroll of Supremacy, but also the entire Spirit Creek Battlefield, Gui Yingzi wasnt so easily fooled.</p><p>A ghost cultivator could be many things, but an impatient ghost cultivator could never be an outstanding ghost cultivator. They must be able to wait until the moment the enemy truly revealed a chink in their armor before baring their fangs.</p><p>Time passed slowly. Countless cultivators were dying to know the outcome of this battle, but Lu Ye was reading a book and cultivating, while Gui Yingzi was waiting patiently for his opening to arrive. Not a single sound could be heard in the entire battlefield.</p><p>The sky slowly darkened over time. This discovery surprised Lu Ye.</p><p>He had never stayed on the Scroll of Supremacys battlefield for so long. That was why he didnt know that it had a day-night cycle.</p><p>This made him wonder if the rumors that the Scroll of Supremacys battlefields were actual places on Jiu Zhou had some truth to it after all. At the very least, it seemed like the time in this battlefield was identical to that of Jiu Zhou and the Spirit Creek Battlefield.</p><p>He rubbed his stomach. He was feeling a little hungry.</p><p>So, he put away his book and took out a few chunks of raw meat from his Storage Bag. He threw half of them to Amber and set the rest atop the bonfire.</p><p>The meat came from the Misty Mountains. Specifically, it belonged to the Spirit Beasts he killed during his time there.</p><p>This chapter is updated by https://ùëôùò™ùí∑ùìáùëíùëéùëë.ùò§ùëúùëö</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
