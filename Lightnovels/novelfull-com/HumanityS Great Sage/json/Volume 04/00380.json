Therefore, this was the only realistic way they had to check his condition.</p><p>Lu Yi Ye had accepted the challenge but forfeited every time his four-hour preparation time was up. This proved that his condition was poor, or considering his personality he would not have given up without putting up a fight.</p><p>Moreover, the battle of the Scroll of Supremacy did not always end in death. If one of the combatants felt like they were in danger of dying, they could just yell, I yield! and the Heavens would automatically take them away from the battlefield.</p><p>The fact that Lu Yi Ye did not even dare to show his face could only mean that he was afraid that the Thousand Demon Ridge would find out his real condition.</p><p>Their anxiety subsided greatly when they learned this. Now they truly believed that it was only a matter of time before Lu Yi Ye perished!</p><p>Another four hours passed in the blink of an eye, and Lu Ye slipped from the thirty-seventh spot to the forty-first.</p><p>The Thousand Demon Ridge wasnt done with him though. Yet another challenger had issued him a challenge request.</p><p>In the Myriad Poison Forest, Lu Ye was growing impatient with the constant interruption. Every time four hours had passed, someone would issue him a challenge and interrupt his recovery, cultivation and study all at the same time. While he could earn himself four hours of peace by accepting the challenge and leaving it to dry, it did not change the fact that he was being interrupted.</p><p>That was why Lu Ye declined the third challenge request straight up, causing his ranking to decline to the forty-sixth spot!</p><p>For the next incense stick, everyone who possessed the right to connect to the Heavens and check the Scroll of Supremacy watched as Lu Ye nosedived all the way from the forty-first spot all the way to the bottom. Finally, he vanished completely from the Scroll of Supremacy!</p><p>Three days ago, Lu Ye had made history by ascending to the thirty-third spot as a Heaven Seven cultivator. Three days later, the rising star had dropped out of the rank list almost just as quickly. It was the literal definition of a flash in the pan.</p><p>The Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators were satisfied that Lu Yi Ye had finally stopped poking their eyes with his existence in the Scroll of Supremacy.</p><p>Lu Ye was also satisfied that no one could interrupt him through the Scroll of Supremacy anymore.</p><p>He was going to catch a good rest when suddenly, he frowned and called out, Yi Yi!</p><p>Yi Yi was in the middle of barbecuing some raw meat. She turned toward him distractedly as she asked, What is it?</p><p>It was then she noticed that Lu Yes expression was off. He was staring in a certain direction and slowly rising to his feet. His Spiritual Power suddenly circulated at high speed as if he was preparing for combat. In fact, he was.</p><p>Yi Yi immediately sank into the underground while Amber leaped onto Lu Yes shoulder. The tiger looked like it was being useless, but in fact it was ready to respond to any danger.</p><p>Somehow, someone had made it all the way to their location. This was the last thing Lu Ye was expecting.</p><p>The Myriad Poison Forest had been fully surrounded by the Thousand Demon Ridge, so this mysterious stranger could only be their enemy. The fact that they made it this far showed just how strong they were. He wondered what rank they were on the Scroll of Supremacy.</p><p>Lu Yi Ye held the Inviolable with one hand and a ward flag with the other. He might not be able to unleash even half of his full power right now, but he had set up a number of wards in the area. No matter how strong the mysterious stranger was, they werent going to kill him this easily.</p><p>Creak, creak, creak</p><p>By now, the stranger was close enough that he could hear them crushing some tree branches beneath their feet. They were slowly passing through the thick, aquamarine fog and making their way toward the ward.</p><p>Despite imbuing his eyes with Insight, he was still unable to see through the poisonous fog and see the newcomers face. Judging from the vague outline, it was probably a woman.</p><p>A short while later, the stranger finally arrived at the edge of the ward and beamed at Lu Ye. If the strangers arrival had shocked him before, now he was completely flabbergasted.</p><p>Sister Hua Ci! Yi Yi exclaimed in disbelief as she emerged from the underground. The last person she had expected to see here was Hua Ci.</p><p>[No, wait, she must have come all the way to find us!] ùô°ùôûùì´ùôßùôöùì™ùíÖ.ùíÑùíêùì∂</p><p>Yi Yi was just about to jump into Hua Cis lap when Lu Ye abruptly caught her shoulder, causing her to look back in puzzlement.</p><p>Lu Ye squinted a little at the Hua Ci outside the ward and said, Im pretty sure our medicine cultivator does not have the ability to pass through the Thousand Demon Ridges encirclement and come all the way here. Who are you?</p><p>His words struck Yi Yi like a thunderbolt. She had been so overjoyed that she completely failed to realize it should be impossible for Hua Ci to make it here alone. Furious at the deception, she stared at Hua Ci and yelled, Who are you? How did you disguise yourself as Sister Hua Ci?</p><p>Hua Ci broke into a wry smile before shooting Lu Ye a somewhat aggrieved look. She then let out a sigh, rubbed her tummy and pretended to cry, Oh, you poor, poor child. Your dad doesnt want us anymore. What are we going to do?</p><p>YI Yis eyes widened like saucers. What does that mean?</p><p>Lu Ye was even more shocked than she was. He felt like he had taken a Lightning Invoking Talisman Paper to the face.</p><p>Initially, he was certain that the Hua Ci in front of him was fake. After she said this though, he wasnt quite sure anymore. No one except that woman would be so foul-mouthed in front of him.</p><p>He quickly recalled a way to verify this and sent Hua Ci a message through his Battlefield Imprint. The woman immediately responded, Daddy, your child and his mother have come to see you. Arent you happy?</p><p>Lu Yes eyes twitched uncontrollably as he waved his flag. A gap opened in the ward, and Hua Ci stepped in.</p><p>Lu Ye, Yi Yi was unaware of the message and so asked distrustfully, Is she really Sister Hua Ci?</p><p>She is.</p><p>Sister Hua Ci! Yi Yi immediately hopped, skipped and jumped over to Hua Ci. She was beyond happy to see her here.</p><p>Lu Ye had also sat down while looking Hua Ci up and down. He still felt like was dreaming because he did not think that Hua Ci would come all the way to find him, muchless succeed.</p><p>Also, her aura marked her as a Ninth-Order cultivator. This clearly did not line up with what he remembered of her cultivation speed.</p><p>After Yi Yi had finally calmed herself down, Lu Ye finally asked, How on earth did you get here?</p><p>With my own two feet, duh! Hua Ci replied matter-of-factly.</p><p>Did the Thousand Demon Ridge evacuate already?</p><p>No. I count at least thousands of people covering both the sky and the ground of the Myriad Poison Forest. There are many squads going in and out of the forest in search of you as well. Youre well and truly trapped, dear.</p><p>Then how did you walk in, dear?</p><p>Im a medicine cultivator. There was a search party who requested a medicine cultivator to join them, so I did.</p><p>Lu Ye was going to ask where that search party went when he saw her carrying at least thirty to forty Storage Bags on her waist. That was his answer.</p><p>Lu Ye was shocked yet again. What on earth had she received at Mount Ying? She was just a Ninth-Order medicine cultivator, and yet she had wiped out an entire squad of Core Circle cultivators single handedly! Judging from the amount of Storage Bags on her waist, the squad must have numbered at least twenty people.</p><p>That wasnt even his biggest question. How on earth was Hua Ci able to resist the poisonous fog? She might be an outstanding medicine cultivator, but there was only so much one could do against the deadly phenomenon. He could resist it because he had the Tree of Glyphs. More accurately, the Tree of Glyphs burned away the poison before it could do any real harm to his body.</p><p>It had to have something with her inheritance.</p><p>Suddenly, Hua Ci spoke up, Yi Yi, the meat is blackening.</p><p>Ahhh! Yi Yi hurriedly went back to the bonfire and flipped the meat around.</p><p>Hua Ci examined Lu Ye up and down while asking, Youre not poisoned?</p><p>The reason she came all the way despite the dangers was because she was afraid that Lu Ye would succumb to the poison. However, the guy looked poison-free despite his weakened condition. If anything, Yi Yi was the one who looked like she could use some poison removal.</p><p>Im immune to poison, Lu Ye replied before throwing the question back to her, How are you not poisoned?</p><p>What a coincidence! Im immune to poison as well. Hua Ci shot him a benevolent smile before walking up to Lu Ye and crouching beside him. She instructed, Give me your hand!</p><p>Lu Ye obeyed, and Hua Ci placed two fingers on his wrist. Although he looked like he was fine on the surface, there were countless poisons that were both deadly and undetectable. She would not be able to rest easily until she had checked his condition herself.</p><p>A moment later, she finally confirmed that Lu Ye wasnt poisoned.</p><p>Open your mouth.</p><p>Ah Lu Ye did as she said.</p><p>Stick out your tongue.</p><p>Enough! Lu Ye realized she was toying with him and did not obey her this time.</p><p>Hehe, that isnt your choice to make, Hua Ci said while grabbing his hand suddenly. It felt soft as silk and warm as sunlight. At the same time, he suddenly felt numb as if he had been stung by a venomous bee, though the feeling faded as quickly as it came. After that, Hua Ci immediately grabbed Lu Yes mouth in an attempt to force out his tongue.</p><p>Before she could even begin squeezing though, Lu Ye had responded by grabbing her own face!</p><p>[Hmm. I think I can get used to this.]</p><p>Hua Cis mouth turned into an O-shape, and not because Lu Ye was squeezing her. She blinked in confusion as they stared into each others eyes.</p><p>[This isnt right he shouldve been paralyzed the moment I touched him!]</p><p>What are you doing? Lu Ye asked in an unclear voice.</p><p>How are you Hua Ci did not know what to say.</p><p>Meanwhile, Yi Yi was watching the duo squeezing each others cheeks, puffing up their lips and staring into each others eyes soulfully. When she recalled what Hua Ci had said at the beginning, she stomped her foot and vanished into Ambers body.</p><p>[Im not watching this!]</p><p>On Lu Yes shoulder, Amber had covered its eyes with its paws as well</p><p>Did you just poison me? It was only now Lu Ye realized what Hua Ci had done to him. The Tree of Glyphs residing in his Source Spiritual Point had released a large puff of gray fog; a sign that the poison was being purged from his body.</p><p>How are you fine? Hua Ci just could not figure out why.</p><p>I told you Im immune to poison.</p><p>Impossible! Hua Ci clearly did not believe him. There was no such thing as immunity to all poison.</p><p>Can you release me now?</p><p>You first.</p><p>Okay.</p><p>Lu Ye let go of Hua Cis face, and Hua Ci Lu Yes. However, Hua Ci was still holding his hand tightly. At the same time, the gray fog expelling from the Three of Glyphs grew thicker.</p><p>This content is taken from ùò≠ùò™ùò£ùëüùò¶ùò¢ùíπ.ùò§ùëúùìÇ</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
