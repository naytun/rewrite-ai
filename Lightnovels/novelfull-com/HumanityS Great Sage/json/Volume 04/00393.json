Thats four thousand Contribution Points in total. You may not have that many Contribution Points, but Im sure you can gather that amount somehow.</p><p>While the most common way to obtain Contribution Points was to kill enemies and sell stuff to the Vault of Providence, it was normally quite difficult for a Spirit Creek Realm cultivator to accumulate that many Spiritual Points. Of course, a Legate or a prolegate would have the additional method of paying themselves a wage. ùëôùíæùí∑ùò≥ùëíùëéùò•.ùí∏‚Ñ¥ùìÇ</p><p>Four thousand Contribution Points was a lot for an Outer Circle or Inner Circle cultivator, but for some Core Circle cultivators, it wasnt an unachievable goal.</p><p>This was especially true for a strong and beautiful female cultivator like Bai Lan. She would be cared for no matter which sect she went to. Even if she personally could not accumulate the amount, someone else would do it for her.</p><p>Lu Ye hadnt demanded twenty Flames of the Earthen Spirits from Bai Lan without thinking. It was the number he had arrived at after careful consideration of her overall capabilities.</p><p>And why should I give you twenty Flames of the Earthen Spirits? Bai Lan retorted angrily.</p><p>This was the first time she encountered something like this in the challenge battle of the Scroll of Supremacy, and it was mind-boggling to say the least. She had heard of the Vanquisher of Sects infamy since a long time ago, but she never knew that he had a screw loose in his head as well. On second thought, that sounded about right. A normal person wouldnt have drawn the ire of the entire Thousand Demon Ridge.</p><p>This is a fight, so just fight me and cut the nonsense! Bai Lan declared.</p><p>As if on cue, Lu Ye started running toward her so fast that he left behind a series of afterimages.</p><p>She cast a series of spells at Lu Ye, but the man actually dodged all of them with unerring accuracy. Despite her best efforts, he was shortening the gap between them by the second.</p><p>Most spell cultivators in this situation would attempt to move away from Lu Ye and delay the inevitable as much as possible. While backing away, they would continuously harass the enemy until they were dead or forced back.</p><p>However, Bai Lan was the forty-eighth ranker on the Scroll of Supremacy. Her insight was far above that of most spell cultivators.</p><p>From the moment Lu Ye had made his move, she already knew that their speed didnt even belong in the same category. This Lu Yi Ye wasnt just fast in telekinesis, his own speed was just as shocking. Even if she retreated, it would take him at most a moment to catch up.</p><p>That was why she made the snap decision to switch out her current spell and made a spell seal. The second she did this, the back of her hand abruptly lit up.</p><p>It wasnt the light of the Battlefield Imprint though. It was the light of a Glyph! A Tattoo that had been engraved to the back of her hand by a Glyphweaver!</p><p>Master Glyphweavers like Lady Yun existed in both the Grand Sky Coalition and the Thousand Demon Ridge. It was just that Tattoos were generally too valuable to be wasted on a Spirit Creek Realm cultivator.</p><p>Forget the materials necessary to tattoo the Glyphs, the service charges of the Glyphweaver themselves were well above the ability of most Spirit Creek Realm cultivators to pay.</p><p>Take Lu Yes Wings for example. In terms of value, they were as valuable as a spell artifact.</p><p>Besides that, Tattoos could be categorized into Visible Tattoos and Hidden Tattoos; Temporary Tattoos or Permanent Tattoos. Each type consumed different resources.</p><p>Bai Lans Tattoo was obviously a Hidden Tattoo because it was invisible until she activated it. It afforded the opportunity to surprise her enemies.</p><p>Lu Ye wondered if it was temporary or permanent. If it was permanent, then the cost of the Glyph must be humongous.</p><p>The Glyph only appeared for an instant before turning invisible once more, but Lu Ye still managed to identify it before it disappeared. It looked very similar to one of the Glyphs he had acquired recently, Invoke Lightning.</p><p>He immediately figured out what his opponent was planning. Due to the clash between his Fire and Bai Lans Water Attribute Spiritual Power, the entire area was shrouded in mist right now. He would not be able to get out of the mist in time. Without hesitation, he channeled his Spiritual Power and covered his entire body in a layer of Protection.</p><p>Lightning struck where Lu Ye was standing. At that moment, the entire area was crawling with tendrils of lightning.</p><p>Lu Ye shuddered as the power of a top fifty ranker literally coursed around him. His Protection was weakening by the second even though he was doing everything he could to keep the Glyph going. It only lasted three breaths before shattering and exposing Lu Ye directly to the lightning. There were only a handful of Spirit Creek Realm cultivators who might survive such power.</p><p>That was when Bai Lan saw Lu Ye rushing out of the lightning-covered area with a face that was covered in black soot. He even spat out a puff of black smoke as he continued running toward Bai Lan.</p><p>Bai Lan was shocked to say the least, but she did not stop casting her spells. A lifelike, snarling water dragon emerged into existence and pounced straight toward Lu Ye. At the same time, the spell cultivator dashed to the back.</p><p>She had no choice. Even her greatest trump card had failed to stop Lu Yi Ye in his tracks. If she remained where she was, she might still win, but Lu Yi Ye was fast enough to take her down with him.</p><p>The flame-wreathed Inviolable swung down on the water dragon. His momentum stalled temporarily when his blade clashed against the spell technique, but a single Gravity Well was all it took to resume it and slice through the Water Dragon like it was nothing. After that, he appeared in front of Bai Lan in an instant and brought down his saber mercilessly.</p><p>Bai Lans expression turned fearful in an instant. She hurriedly touched the tear-like earring on her earlobe and summoned what looked like a shield.</p><p>Killing Bai Lan was never in the plans. After all, he was hoping that she would deliver him the Flames of Earthen Spirits he needed. When he saw the shield though, he did not hesitate to empower the Inviolable with two Sharp Edges.</p><p>The one strike sent Bai Lan sailing across the air like a sack of rice.</p><p>Her defense didnt break, and she wasnt hurt in any way. The earring was a High-Grade Spirit Artifact after all. Even if she wasnt strong enough to channel its full power, it was enough to keep her from dying.</p><p>However, the one strike had diminished much of its aura. Moreover, it couldnt prevent her from being blown away by the impact. Bai Lan was just climbing back to her feet when she felt a tremendous force hitting her again and throwing her to the distance. This time, the shield surrounding her looked almost invisible.</p><p>[It wont block the third strike!]</p><p>Bai Lan panicked. At first, she thought she couldnt lose with the High-Grade Spirit Artifact to protect her. Now, she realized she had underestimated the ruffian. His offensive power was above what she thought was possible for a Spirit Creek Realm cultivator, let alone a Heaven Eight cultivator. It just didnt make any sense whatsoever!</p><p>She thought she was dead, but Lu Ye did not give chase. He simply stood where he was and waited for her to climb back to her feet. She watched him with confusion, fear and trepidation.</p><p>You have one hour.</p><p>He said this before declaring, I surrender!</p><p>The man swiftly faded and disappeared into nothing.</p><p>Bai Lan was stupefied to say the least. She had been seconds away from calling her surrender, but it was the young man who had surrendered instead.</p><p>[What is he]</p><p>Bai Lan figured out the truth a second later. As Lu Ye promised, he was going to challenge her an hour later!</p><p>[Damn that ruffian!]</p><p>Meanwhile, Bai Lans lover was still waiting anxiously on the rock beside the cliff. Although his junior sister was protected by a High-Grade Spirit Artifact, it was impossible to ignore Lu Yi Yes string of achievements. Looking at the Scroll of Supremacy alone, every Thousand Demon Ridge cultivator he had challenged until now had perished in combat. His junior sister was the love of his life; how could he not be worried for her safety?</p><p>It was at this moment the space in front of him distorted. Then, his junior sister appeared before him once more.</p><p>His eyes widened as he looked back and forth between his junior sister and the Scroll of Supremacy. She was still ranked forty-eighth, and Lu Yi Ye fiftieth. It could only mean one thing.</p><p>You won? The man exclaimed in pleasant surprise.</p><p>Contrary to her senior brothers delight, Bai Lan was white as a sheet. When she recalled that she had to face down that aggressive ruffian again an hour later, her lips immediately quivered. Senior brother</p><p>The man blanched and asked nervously, Whats wrong, junior sister? Were you hurt anywhere?</p><p>Woooooo Bai Lan pounced into his arms and cried like a baby.</p><p>The man grew even more anxious. Where are you hurt? Just tell me already.</p><p>Bai Lan just kept crying and shaking her head.</p><p>The mans face turned green as he put two and two together. His junior sister wasnt hurt, but she was crying like she had been violated</p><p>[Could it be?]</p><p>[Lu Yi Ye, you motherfucker! I swear Ill kill you if its the last thing I do!]</p><p>A long time later, when Bai Lan finally calmed down enough to explain what really happened, the man relaxed. He was glad it wasnt what he thought had happened.</p><p>That bastard wants you to give him twenty Flame of Earthen Spirits?</p><p>Mm.</p><p>And youre certain hes going to challenge you in an hour?</p><p>He definitely will. Hes the one who surrendered the fight of his own accord.</p><p>Bai Lan still felt chilled every time she recalled the way her hair stood on end when he rushed her with his saber. She had fought countless combat cultivators in the past, but no one had ever dealt her such a level of trauma before. Although his flame-wreathed saber hadnt hurt a hair on her body, her heart had really been shattered to pieces.</p><p>If possible, she never wanted to fight Lu Yi Ye or anyone like him anymore. The sensation that her life wasnt in her hands was horrible to say the least.</p><p>One thing was certain, she wouldve died if it wasnt for the High-Grade Spiritual Artifact her master had given her.</p><p>Thats simple. All you need to do is to reject the challenge when he issues the challenge request. Its not like you must accept it.</p><p>Bai Lan sniffed and thought for a moment. She realized then that her senior brother was right. It wasnt like she must accept the fight. Plus, once she lost her ranking and dropped beneath him, he would not be able to issue another challenge request!</p><p>The bastard thought he could swindle her into giving up twenty Flame of the Earthen Spirits? Fuck him!</p><p>You are so smart, senior brother! Bai Lan finally broke into a smile and wiped away her tears. She felt so much better knowing that Lu Yi Ye couldnt threaten her anymore.</p><p>Back in Myriad Poison Forest, Lu Ye was consuming his Spirit Pills and cultivating as usual</p><p>or so he would like to say, if not for the fact that Yi Yi and Hua Ci were sitting opposite him and staring at him with emotionless eyes.</p><p>If the two of you have something to say, then say it.</p><p>Lu Ye was feeling uncomfortable to say the least.</p><p>Hua Ci started in a mocking tone, I never wouldve guessed that the Vanquisher of Sects is a protector of womankind. Dont you agree, Yi Yi?</p><p>Yi Yi corrected her, He doesnt protect all women, Sister Hua Ci, only those who are big enough to catch his attention.</p><p>Really? How big are we talking about here?</p><p>At least bigger than you, Sister Hua Ci.</p><p>Hua Ci mulled it over for a moment before commenting, Isnt that tiring?</p><p>I wouldnt know. Yi Yi shrugged since she had never experienced that kind of burden. Are you tired of living with them, Hua Ci?</p><p>Hua Ci smiled kindly. Im doing okay.</p><p>Enough!</p><p>Lu Ye grew agitated as the two girls slowly strayed off topic. Am I that type of person in your eyes?</p><p>The two girls thought seriously for a moment. Then, they nodded in unison.</p><p>Yi Yi said, Since the day we departed Green Cloud Mountain, I already noticed that you love reasoning with female cultivators with big boobs. The bigger the boobs, the bigger your tolerance.</p><p>Hua Ci also said, Remember the first time we met? You were wrapped like a zongzi that day, but your eyes were anything but restrained.</p><p>I cant believe youve misunderstood me all this time, Lu Ye complained in distress.</p><p>This chapter is updated by ùò≠ùëñùò£ùìá‚ÑØùò¢ùíπ.ùò§‚Ñ¥ùòÆ</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
