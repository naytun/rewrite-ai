It wasnt until they reached the Cloud River Realm could they fly without one.</p><p>Flying with or without a flying Spirit Artifact was quite different. The former let the flying Spirit Artifact do most of the heavy lifting, while the latter was flying without any aid.</p><p>Lu Ye was technically relying on Soar to fly, so it wasnt true unaided flight. That said, the experience was more or less the same.</p><p>Of course, this did not mean that a cultivator no longer had any use for flying Spirit Artifacts after reaching the Cloud River Realm. After all, flying using a flying Spirit Artifact cost less Spiritual Power in general, not to mention that some had recesses where the cultivator could deposit Spirit Stones to power the flying Spirit Artifact.</p><p>This was especially true for large flying Spirit Artifacts. They usually consumed more Spiritual Power than one or even an entire group of cultivators could provide. That was why it was necessary to install wards and Spirit Stones in them.</p><p>Lu Yes mood was vastly improved after he obtained Soar. Add to the fact that he had fought countless battles for the past couple days, Lu Ye decided to take the entire day off and just rest.</p><p>Lu Yes rest day was a rest day for most Spirit Creek Realm cultivators as well. The Scroll of Supremacy didnt change much, and the Spirit Creek Battlefield itself was unusually peaceful today.</p><p>When did one guy come to control an entire battlefield? The cultivators of Thousand Demon Ridge realized sorrowfully that the Spirit Creek Battlefield was actually quite peaceful when the Vanquisher of Sects wasnt causing trouble.</p><p>Too bad for them, the peace would only last a single day. The next morning, Lu Ye began climbing the Scroll of Supremacy once more, and this time his ascent was faster than ever before. In fact, he was shooting up the ranks every few breaths or so. This was because every Thousand Demon Ridge cultivator he had challenged had rejected his challenge request.</p><p>It might be shameful, but living in shame was still better than dying. Not counting the ones Lu Ye had killed before yesterdays mission, the bastard had killed at least a hundred Heaven Nine cultivators. The bottom fifty rankers simply werent confident that they could survive a battle against Lu Ye, much less defeat him.</p><p>Previously, Lu Ye had targeted only cultivators from the Thousand Demon Ridge. Unfortunately, that was no longer possible since nearly everyone between the fiftieth spot to the eightieth spot belonged to the Grand Sky Coalition as a consequence of his decision. Once he had climbed past the eightieth spot, he had no choice but to challenge some Grand Sky Coalition cultivators.</p><p>Thankfully, his allies understood his situation perfectly and did not blame him for anything. In just an hour, Lu Ye had returned to the top fifty once more. No one had ever climbed the Scroll of Supremacy this quickly.</p><p>Now that he was back, he had plenty of targets to choose from. As with before, he challenged each and every Thousand Demon Ridge cultivator above his rank.</p><p>Despite Lu Yes astounding achievement, it had to be said that none of the upper fifty rankers had rejected Lu Yes challenge request. They had their pride and the strength to defend it!</p><p>There were millions and millions of Spirit Creek Realm cultivators in the entire Spirit Creek Battlefield, and these people were able to surpass them all and enter the top fifty. Naturally, they were incredibly powerful.</p><p>Lu Ye did not attack these rankers like he had attacked Bai Lan because one, he did not need more Flames of Earthen Spirits for now; two, he had accumulated plenty Contribution Points to buy them himself thanks to the Thousand Demon Ridges insane attack yesterday; and three, it would waste too much time.</p><p>It had been ten days since he began challenging the Scroll of Supremacy. He needed to reach his highest rank as soon as possible so that he could obtain the best rewards.</p><p>If he tried to repeat what he did to Bai Lan, he was bound to lose more than he gained even if he was successful. And it wasnt likely to work a second time. With the right manipulation, anyone could cost him several days at least.</p><p>Right now, his only goal was to climb the Scroll of Supremacy!</p><p>Since he was the challenger, the right to choose the terrain went to his opponents. Even so, they were still unable to survive Lu Yi Ye.</p><p>After Lu Ye had challenged three upper fifty rankers and killed them all, they finally realized that the young man was even more formidable than they thought.</p><p>At first, the upper fifty rankers thought that the reason Lu Ye was able to kill the bottom fifty rankers before they could even cry, I surrender! was because they were too weak. However, that logic could not possibly apply to an upper fifty ranker.</p><p>This meant that the reason his opponents hadnt surrendered was not because they didnt want to, but because they couldnt. Lu Yi Ye was probably using some sort of strange method to stop his opponents from being able to surrender.</p><p>If surrender was on the table, then the Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators did not mind accepting Lu Yi Yes challenge. But if death was the only outcome of defeat, then they had to seriously think things through before accepting it.</p><p>Unfortunately, they never found out what this method was even after all the sacrifices they had made. In fact, only one person had ever encountered Lu Yi Ye in the challenge battle and survived, and she was Bai Lan of the Rainmaker Sect.</p><p>Naturally, a lot of cultivators had sought out Bai Lan in an attempt to find out exactly what she did to escape Lu Yi Yes wrath, but unfortunately the woman herself could not give an answer. Not only was she overwhelmed by Lu Yi Ye from the start until the end, even her High-Grade Spirit Artifact had proven to be insufficient against his power.</p><p>However, her confession regarding the one-sidedness of the battle only convinced her allies that Bai Lan had every opportunity to surrender. But for some reason, Lu Yi Ye had not used the unknown method he had used on every Thousand Demon Ridge cultivator he had slain so far on her. Heck, he had even surrendered the battle of his own accord!</p><p>It was such an odd battle that the Thousand Demon Ridge could not help but wonder if Lu Yi Ye was one of those protectors of womenfolk or something. Otherwise, why would he show Bai Lan special treatment?</p><p>However, the theory didnt really stand to reason either. There were a good number of beautiful Thousand Demon Ridge female cultivators on the Scroll of Supremacy, and yet Lu Yi Ye had slain them all without mercy. So why was Bai Lan able to live?</p><p>Now that they thought about it, the one thing Bai Lan had that none of the other female rankers had, was an awe-inspiring bust</p><p>At that moment, countless people believed that they figured out the truth</p><p>On a related note, Bai Lan had begun her climb on the same day Lu Yi Ye had begun his climb. However, their speeds were night and day. The young man had ascended to the fiftieth spot without fighting a single battle since everyone he challenged had rejected his challenge request outright. Bai Lan, on the other hand, wasnt nearly as intimidating. Naturally, her speed left much to be desired.</p><p>That said, she was the former forty-eighth ranker. If she gave it her all, her final rank should not be too far below her original rank.</p><p>In the wooden building, after slaying three top fifty rankers in a row, Lu Ye discovered that his next few opponents had unanimously rejected his challenge request yet again. As a result, he shot all the way to the thirty-sixth spot.</p><p>His next challenger was the thirty-fourth ranker named Zhuo Jianchen. The name looked familiar for some reason, and he immediately knew why after checking his sect. It was none other than Bai Lans senior brother, the man who declared he would be waiting for his challenge a few days ago.</p><p>He issued the challenge request, and as expected, the guy had accepted it in almost no time. Lu Ye began waiting patiently for the upcoming battle.</p><p>In the Rainmaker Sects Outpost, Bai Lan stared at a brooding Zhuo Jianchen and asked, Did Lu Yi Ye challenge you, senior brother?</p><p>Yes.</p><p>Did you</p><p>I accepted it!</p><p>I dont think you should go, senior brother.</p><p>Zhuo Jianchen abruptly looked at her. And why shouldnt I? What are you afraid of? 𝓵𝓲𝙗𝓻𝓮𝓪𝙙.𝒄𝓸𝒎</p><p>Bai Lan was confused. Excuse me? Her senior brother was acting strange today. Normally, he was the perfect image of a refined and cultivated gentleman. But now, his expression was so dark he almost couldnt recognize his face.</p><p>Let me ask you a question, junior sister. Why did Lu Yi Ye let you off? Zhuo Jianchen forced down the displeasure in his heart and asked solemnly.</p><p>But he didnt let me off The bastard had blackmailed her into giving him twenty Flames of Earthen Spirits, which was worth a whopping four thousand Contribution Points! 𝙡𝒊𝒃𝓻𝒆𝒂𝓭.𝙘𝓸𝓶</p><p>Zhuo Jianchen pressed, Every fellow cultivator he has challenged has died except you. Is it really just because of the twenty Flame of Earthen Spirits?</p><p>At this point, even Bai Lan noticed what her senior brother was implying. She asked in astonishment, What are you trying to say, senior brother?</p><p>Im not trying to say anything. But I have heard some things.</p><p>That would be an understatement. The rumors were literally flying all over the Thousand Demon Ridge and Grand Sky Coalition right now. At first, Zhuo Jianchen didnt think much of it either, but the rumors had gradually seeped into his mind and poisoned him with fear and suspicion.</p><p>The dark emotions only got worse when he recalled how his junior sister had acted after returning from her fight. She had looked white as a sheet as if she had suffered a terrible humiliation.</p><p>As if that wasnt bad enough, it felt like his junior brothers and junior sisters were looking at him in a different light these days. That he hadnt exploded yet was a testament to his fortitude.</p><p>Bai Lan turned as pale as death in an instant. She had heard the rumors as well, but how could her senior brother believe them?</p><p>You have to believe me, senior</p><p>I dont know if I can believe you, is the crux of the problem here! Zhuo Jianchen interrupted her. That is why Im going to question the bastard myself.</p><p>You cant go, senior brother! Everyone hes challenged so far was killed! Bai Lan pleaded worriedly. However, the more she acted like this, the worse the thorn in his heart became, and the greater his desire to meet Lu Yi Ye face to face.</p><p>This would plague him for life if he did not find out the truth once and for all.</p><p>Enough! Im going to prepare for this battle. Leave me, Zhuo Jianchen said before turning his back on Bai Lan. The door shut behind him before the girl could go after him.</p><p>For a moment, Bai Lan simply stared at the door with listless eyes. She just could not understand how things had turned out this way.</p><p>[Lu Yi Ye its all that guys fault!]</p><p>Bai Lan gritted her teeth as she imagined tearing that bastard to pieces in her mind. However, the mere thought of his face caused her to shiver suddenly.</p><p>She slapped the door again and again while yelling, Please listen to me, senior brother!</p><p>He never responded.</p><p>The scenery before Zhuo Jianchen began changing after he selected the terrain.</p><p>A moment later, Lu Ye and Zhuo Jianchen appeared in a moderate-sized battlefield at the same time. As usual, Yi Yi slipped into the underground to search for the enemy, and Amber lay perfectly still on Lu Yes shoulder like he was no more than an ornament.</p><p>However, before Lu Ye even had the time to examine his surroundings, he abruptly heard a shout from the distant space in front of him, Show your face, Lu Yi Ye!</p><p>He looked forward and saw a man and a sword in the sky. The man was standing on the sword and soaring through the sky at high speed. He was also surrounded by many other swords; most likely his flying weapons. This Zhuo Jianchen was most likely a sword cultivator!</p><p>For some reason though, the guy looked like he was full of rage. Lu Ye suspected that it was probably because he blackmailed his junior sister into giving him twenty Flame of Earthen Spirits.</p><p>Many upper fifty rankers had rejected his challenge request because they werent sure they could survive a fight against him, and yet this man had decided to break the convention not just because he was confident in his skill, but probably because he was a stubborn idiot as well.</p><p>Lu Ye loved stubborn idiots!</p><p>This chapter is updated by 𝘭𝑖𝒷𝓇𝘦𝘢𝒹.𝑐𝘰𝘮</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
