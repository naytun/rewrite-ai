The screams sounded like they would never end.</p><p>Blood, flesh and bones trailed after Lu Ye wherever he went. Dots of red light also chased after him like fireflies. Each dot represented the death of a cultivator, so thirty dots equaled thirty kills in total. Even more were injured by his unstoppable assault. They vanished after they made contact with Lu Yes Battlefield Imprint.</p><p>It was literally raining bodies in the Myriad Poison Forest right now. Countless people, dead or alive, were falling into the poisonous, aquamarine-colored fog.</p><p>Thirty dead was hardly an insignificant loss, but considering that the Thousand Demon Ridge force he was contending against easily numbered over a thousand people, it wasnt that much.</p><p>It was at this moment he heard the ringing of swords. The sword cultivators had finally caught up to him.</p><p>Swords wreathed in dazzling Sword Lights sailed toward him at high speed. They were nimbler and deadlier than any other flying weapon he had encountered until now. His hair stood on end before the attacks even got close to him. ùò≠ùëñùò£ùëüùò¶ùí∂ùò•.ùò§ùëúùòÆ</p><p>It should be obvious, but a sword could travel much faster than a cultivator could fly. They were in front of him almost immediately after the sword cultivators had launched them.</p><p>Without hesitation, Lu Ye plunged into the seemingly borderless fog of poison beneath him and vanished.</p><p>The sword cultivators did not let up on their attack, but soon they discovered that their flying swords had become much slower after they entered the poisonous fog. Not only was their connection to their flying weapons deteriorating, the swords Spiritual Power was decreasing rapidly as well.</p><p>As it turned out, the fog was as corrosive as it was poisonous. It greatly limited their ability to control their Spirit Artifacts.</p><p>The sword cultivators all wore grim expressions on their faces. This was bad. They could be many times stronger and more numerous than they were now, but so long as they continued to fight above the Myriad Poison Forest, the initiative would always be in Lu Yes hands.</p><p>Technically speaking, they could chase Lu Yi Ye into the poisonous fog. However, they were well aware that doing so would only fast-forward their demise.</p><p>Several hundred meters away, Lu Ye abruptly flew out of the poisonous fog and charged toward an unsuspecting group of Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators. The group wasnt particularly strong, and they were busy trying to locate Lu Ye through the fog.</p><p>Although they scattered immediately after Lu Ye showed himself, some of them just werent fast enough to escape the man. A couple more bodies instantly fell toward the fog while screaming the entire way.</p><p>The dozens of sword cultivators immediately made the decision to split into two groups. One would hover just above the poisonous fog and prevent Lu Ye from diving back into it, and the other would keep chasing after Lu Ye.</p><p>This way, Lu Ye would not be able to escape back into the poisonous fog without engaging them first.</p><p>Naturally, Lu Ye wasnt going to clash against the sword cultivators. He picked a random direction and charged full speed ahead. ùìµùì≤ùì´ùôßùìÆùôñùôô.ùíÑùì∏ùô¢</p><p>All around Lu Ye, Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators attempted to intercept him and stop him in his tracks. However, all they managed to do was to repeat the same mistake as before. The stronger ones were at the forefront of the group, and the weaker ones lagged further and further behind. Eventually, Lu Ye did a massive U-turn and rushed straight toward the cultivators at the tail end of the group.</p><p>The unfortunate cultivators turned green in the face when they realized this. That surprise maneuver from earlier had already cost them dozens of lives. This one was probably going to turn out more or less the same way.</p><p>Although the sword cultivators were trying to keep up with Lu Ye as best they could, the unfortunate fact was that they couldnt keep up with Lu Ye with Windwalk active. The best they could hope for was to not be completely left in the dust.</p><p>By now, the main forces formation was in complete disarray. The weak cultivators Lu Ye was targeting werent just going to stay still and let him kill them like helpless chicks, so most of them scattered in every direction, and the rest grouped up and summoned their defensive Spirit Artifacts, hoping that that would be enough to dissuade Lu Ye.</p><p>Lu Ye blurred past them in the blink of an eye. Fire Phoenix spells engulfed the group while his nine flying weapons cut through them.</p><p>Not a single person in the group was able to withstand his attacks. Not even a body-tempering cultivator with a Shield Spirit Artifact was able to block a strike that was empowered with two Sharp Edges, not to mention the Fire Phoenix spells.</p><p>The scene suddenly turned comedic. From a third persons perspective, it looked like Lu Ye was leading his pursuers on a wild gooses chase while cutting them bit by bit. Unfortunately, neither his pursuers nor the unfortunate bastards he had designated as prey were able to do anything to stop this. The bodies just wouldnt stop raining.</p><p>It wasnt until more Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators joined in on the pursuit that they finally put an end to Lu Yes mad maneuvers.</p><p>At least several thousand cultivators had surrounded the entire Myriad Poison Forest, and the one Lu Ye was facing was only one thousand or so people strong. The forest was pretty massive. It took them some time to fly all the way to Lu Yes location.</p><p>Several thousand cultivators surged toward Lu Ye. Even more Spirit Artifacts and flying weapons filled the sky. It reminded Lu Ye of the Mutant Wasp swarm that had hunted him like a rat two months ago.</p><p>Lu Ye had already escaped in the opposite direction, of course. The reason he was able to do what he did was because he was only dealing with a thousand or so pursuers. Now that their number had grown to thousands, of course his tactics wouldnt work anymore.</p><p>Plus, he had used up a lot of Spiritual Power even though the fight was short. This was especially true for the Glyph: Windwalk. At least sixty percent of his used Spiritual Power had been fed into the Glyph.</p><p>Currently, Lu Ye was dissatisfied with his control over his flying Spirit Artifact. While he wasnt expecting to get to Ju Jias levelthe body-tempering cultivator could probably thread a needle with his flying Spirit Artifacthe at least wanted to get to the point where fighting in the air felt perfectly natural to him. As of now, he still felt like he was limited in some ways.</p><p>Then again, perhaps he felt this way because he was comparing himself to Ju Jia. His level of control was already outstanding compared to most cultivators.</p><p>He was still being pursued by an ungodly number of Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators. The sword cultivators especially clung to him like the maggot to bones.</p><p>Lu Ye had Windwalk, and the sword cultivators had their own secret arts. While they didnt last long as a matter of course, at least they didnt need to worry about being left in the dust for now.</p><p>This experience was terribly humiliating for the Thousand Demon Ridge to say the least. After waiting for over two months for Lu Yi Ye to show himself, they had been led around like a cat chasing after its toy. Not even the sword cultivators were able to do much to improve their situation.</p><p>Lu Yi Ye had successfully broken out of their encirclement with nary a scratch. But they? This pursuit had cost them over a hundred people already!</p><p>For a time, they could not stop cursing Lu Yi Ye for his cowardice and scorning him for picking off their weak and avoiding their strong.</p><p>The bigger emotion that dominated their heart was fear, however. It had only been two or so months, and the bastard was Heaven Eight already. How much longer would it take for him to reach Heaven Nine?</p><p>At the Heaven-Grade Eighth-Order Realm, Lu Yi Ye was undoubtedly far stronger than the man they had hunted at the Misty Mountains. Moreover, most of the casualties he had inflicted were caused by his wards and other indirect methods such as the Mutant Wasps.</p><p>However, he wasnt doing any of that right now. He was fighting them directly via his own strength and skill.</p><p>Sure, he targeted their weaklings and only their weaklings, but the fact that he was able to stay ahead of the hammer itself was a testament to his strength, was it not?</p><p>For the past two months, after the Thousand Demon Ridge had mobilized thousands of Spirit Creek Realm cultivators to trap him within the Myriad Poison Forest, there wasnt a single person who didnt wish to know what his ultimate fate would be.</p><p>Naturally, countless people were speechless when todays news finally made it to Jiu Zhou.</p><p>It was said that Lu Ye had single handedly broken out of the Thousand Demon Ridges encirclement. Although they were still chasing after him right now, the fact that he managed to leave Myriad Poison Forest at all meant that Thousand Demon Ridges two-month long encirclement had ended in failure.</p><p>Starting today, the chances that the Thousand Demon Ridge would get another shot like this was incredibly slim. The Heavens themselves would have to conspire against Lu Yi Ye to bring him to heel!</p><p>At least the Thousand Demon Ridge was beyond feeling embarrassment already. What was one more when they had already lost their face to Lu Yi Ye repeatedly in the past?</p><p>As the saying went, the difference between a hundred ticks and ten ticks was just the numberit was uncomfortable either way.</p><p>The pursuit was still ongoing, but most people could not keep up with Lu Yi Ye anymore. Although a small group of peopleespecially the sword cultivatorswere still giving chase, the bastard was slowly but surely pulling away from them.</p><p>Two hours later, even the sword cultivators had lost track of Lu Ye completely.</p><p>The defeat was difficult to swallow, but even the sword cultivators had to admit that Lu Ye was faster than them in terms of telekinetic speed!</p><p>The bastard was just too fast! His speed made no sense whatsoever!</p><p>Once again, the entire Thousand Demon Ridge was searching for Lu Ye. Although they had lost his trail, the operation to kill him was far from over.</p><p>It was the wishes of the higher-ups as well!</p><p>The Real Lake Realm and Divine Ocean Realm cultivators recognized the threat that Lu Ye represented even better than the Spirit Creek Realm cultivators. Once upon a time, the Crimson Blood Sect had produced Feng Wujiang. They did not wish to see the same thing happening all over again!</p><p>At the beginning, Qin Zheng of the Thousand Feather Sect had created the Yi Ye Elimination Front with the explicit goal of killing Lu Yi Ye. However, it was disbanded after the failure at Misty Mountains because it was just a temporary organization that had been haphazardly put together to maintain morale.</p><p>Today, the organization had resurfaced as an official organization. In just half a day, the current champion of the Scroll of Supremacy, Shi Guang of the Way Profound Sect, had announced that hundreds of Core Circle sects would be joining the Yi Ye Elimination Front. Almost every Thousand Demon Ridge cultivator on the Scroll of Supremacy would be joining as well. Their goal was to eliminate Lu Yi Ye before he ascended to Heaven Nine!</p><p>On one hand, the higher-ups had given them the order to eliminate Lu Yi Ye at all costs. On the other, the Spirit Creek Realm cultivators literally did not dare to allow Lu Ye to live even a second longer.</p><p>The bastard was already nigh unmanageable as a Heaven Eight cultivator. He would literally be invincible if they allowed him to ascend to Heaven Nine!</p><p>The Yi Ye Elimination Front waited patiently while countless people were searching all over the Core Circle for Lu Ye. Even the most cultivation-obsessed cultivator had temporarily paused their cultivation so that they could join in on the hunt at first notice.</p><p>Over five hundred kilometers away from the Myriad Poison Forest, at a Divine Trade Bazaar.</p><p>While there were plenty of bazaars made up of independent cultivators in the Outer Circle, the same could not be said for the Inner Circle or the Core Circle. It was because most of the bazaars in these Circles were built and managed by the Divine Trade Association.</p><p>Visit ùìµùì≤ùì´ùôßùìÆùôñùôô.ùíÑùì∏ùô¢ for the best novel reading experience</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
