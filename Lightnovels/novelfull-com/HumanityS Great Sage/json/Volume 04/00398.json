They were about a hundred meters away from one another.</p><p>Although his climb up the Scroll of Supremacy had been incredibly smooth-sailing, he had never underestimated his opponent, and he wasnt about to start with a sword cultivator. The fact that he was ranked thirty-second meant that he was pretty strong.</p><p>The moment their eyes met, Zhuo Jianchen asked furiously, I have a question for you, Lu Yi Ye! Did you do anything untoward against my junior sister? ùìµùì≤ùì´ùíìùìÆùôñùì≠.ùíÑùô§ùì∂</p><p>Lu Ye mulled over the question for a moment. He had hounded the girl from the forty-eighth spot all the way to the ninety-seventh spot. In the end, he had even blackmailed her into paying him four thousand Contribution Points worth of Flames of Earthen Spirits. He supposed that he had gone a tad overboard, but then again, the woman should be thankful he didnt kill her in the first place. She wouldve been long dead if he wasnt in a hurry to get some Flames of Earthen Spirits. What was some loss of wealth and rank compared to ones life?</p><p>In any case, he had bullied the junior sister, so the senior brother decided to take revenge for her. It was understandable.</p><p>Zhuo Jianchen could not read Lu Yes mind, so his silence only caused the sword cultivators dark emotions to swell to unimaginable proportions. While turning green in the face, he uttered, You have nothing to say, is it? Very well then! Die!</p><p>The seven swords of different length floating next to Zhuo Jianchen immediately sailed toward Lu Ye. They closed the distance in the blink of an eye.</p><p>A sword cultivators flying swords were notoriously swift and deadly. It was the main reason they were able to kill those above their cultivation level.</p><p>Lu Yes understanding of sword cultivators was actually pretty lacking compared to other factions, but he knew Zhuo Jianchen was no small fry from the fact that he could command seven flying weapons. His mind must be incredibly powerful, though he was still nowhere close to Yu Lianzhous level.</p><p>From what he heard, Yu Lianzhou could control twenty flying weapons at the same time, which was nearly three times more than Zhuo Jianchen. If he were to compare him to Li Baxian, then they didnt even belong in the same league. The amount of swords Li Baxian could control at the Spirit Creek Realm was an unbreakable world record not just because he was uniquely talented in this regard, but also because he had lingered at the Spirit Creek Realm for too long.</p><p>During the decade he was stuck at the Heaven-Grade Eighth-Order Realm, the only thing he could do besides guarding the Devoted Ones Outpost was to improve his mind. That was why he became capable of controlling a hundred flying weapons, and why his foundation as a Cloud River Realm cultivator far exceeded most other Cloud River Realm cultivators.</p><p>Lu Ye wasnt idle when the seven swords flew toward him. His own flying weapons shot forward to meet the enemy weapons in combat. For a time, the duo simply stood where they were while their flying weapons clashed against one another and sent sparks flying.</p><p>Lu Ye was pretty confident in his telekinesis skills because he had a powerful Divine Soul, which in turn meant that he had a powerful mind. A powerful mind was greatly beneficial to ones control over their Spirit Artifacts and Spiritual Power.</p><p>He did not think there was anyone in the Spirit Creek Battlefield whose Divine Soul was stronger than his, and while he dared not claim to be the current champion of the Way of Telekinesis, he was certain that Zhuo Jianchen was not it either.</p><p>The flying weapons clashed again and again in between the two cultivators. It was almost as if the Spirit Artifacts were alive as they attempted to hunt each other down.</p><p>Unfortunately for Zhuo Jianchen, it took only a moment for his flying swords to fall into a complete disadvantage. The reason for this was one, Lu Ye had more flying weapons than him, and two, he could imbue them with various Glyphs. It was a unique advantage Zhou Jianchen could not hope to match.</p><p>It was clear Zhuo Jianchen realized that he couldnt win via telekinesis either. Once his flying swords were driven back to his side, he abruptly channeled his Spiritual Power and summoned them back to him, to spin around him like a top. Then, he launched them at Lu Yes flying weapons once more.</p><p>This time, it was Lu Yes flying weapons that were sent flying. Lu Ye immediately recognized the attack as a sword field. His knowledge of sword cultivators might be lacking, but that of sword fields wasnt.</p><p>Generally speaking, it took three ordinary cultivators, at least, to form any sort of field. However, a powerful sword cultivator could form a sword field single handedly because they could control multiple flying swords at once.</p><p>A sword field made of seven swords could not be underestimated. They knocked Lu Yes flying weapons away as forcefully as thunder and reached him in the blink of an eye.</p><p>It was too late to bring back his flying weapons, so Lu Ye unsheathed the Inviolable and swung at the deadly swords in front of him.</p><p>Beneath the ground, Yi Yi was watching Lu Ye being pushed back uncontrollably by the sword field. Worse still, Zhuo Jianchen was preparing behind the sword field and becoming one with his swords. He charged Lu Ye the moment he was ready!</p><p><b>Yi Yi remained calm, however, and did not try to help Lu Ye.</b></p><p>To Lu Ye, the Scroll of Supremacy was just another method to temper himself. His fourth senior brothers advice to rush to the highest possible rank in the shortest amount possible only fired him up more. After all, there was no faster way to grow ones strength besides fighting all sorts of enemies in a battle to the death.</p><p>Unfortunately, every enemy he had encountered so far was so weak he couldnt get anything out of the experience. That was until they encountered this sword cultivator today. Naturally, Yi Yi wasnt going to spoil his fun.</p><p>While Lu Ye was holding off the sword field, he manipulated his nine flying weapons to attack Zhuo Jianchen. The sword cultivator immediately sensed the killing intents and acted to block the attack with his sword. He was successful, but he was shocked to discover that his wrist was turning numb from the successive impacts. How was it possible for a combat cultivators telekinesis strength and speed to be so powerful?</p><p>The loss of concentration caused a flaw to appear in the sword field. Lu Ye immediately thrust his saber into the flaw and launched a jet of Spiritual Power. The attack instantly blew apart the sword field and caused the swords to fall toward the ground like meteors.</p><p>Lu Ye took a moment to collect himself. Then, he pounced on Zhuo Jianchen like a tiger.</p><p>The saber clashed shrilly against the sword before the two men were pushed away from each other. For a time, they simply stared at each other with less than three meters separating them. One of them looked like he would swallow his opponent piece by piece, while the other was as cool as ice.</p><p>Im going to kill you! Zhuo Jianchen uttered through gritted teeth.</p><p>At first, he was quite worried for his life as everyone who accepted Lu Yes challenge had died without even being able to surrender. Now that he had fought the man, he discovered that everyone had overestimated Lu Yi Ye. It was true that he was stronghe couldnt have climbed to this rank and challenged him otherwisebut that was all.</p><p>He even thought he could win if he tried a little harder. If he did, he would bring unparalleled honor to both the Thousand Demon Ridge and his sect!</p><p>Zhuo Jianchen let out an angry yell and shot blossoms of sword energy at Lu Ye. However, a single slash was all it took to scatter them all.</p><p>Zhuo Jianchen felt a sudden chill around his chest area and instinctively floated a few steps away from Lu Yi Ye. He shot the young man an incredulous look before looking down at his chest.</p><p>It had to be a hallucination. Somehow, the young man had cut his chest deep enough to unfold the flesh. Even worse, it was so fast that he, a sword cultivator, couldnt react to it.</p><p>You Zhuo Jianchen suddenly wondered if he was dreaming. A moment ago, he thought that his opponent was beatable. Now, he was considering a possibility he hadnt until now.</p><p>Had Lu Yi Ye been hiding his strength this whole time?</p><p>He hadnt considered this sooner because he did not think it was possible for anyone to hide their strength while challenging the Scroll of Supremacy.</p><p>He didnt manage to continue his though process because Lu Ye was already right in front of him. He was forced to raise his sword to block a downward swing.</p><p>An unimaginable force struck him like the hammer of the Heavens. Both him and his flying Spirit Artifacts instantly shot toward the ground like a meteor.</p><p>Boom! Dust flew everywhere as Zhuo Jianchen hit the ground. As he forced himself to stand up, blood bubbled around the edges of his lips, and his bones felt like they could fall apart at any moment. His eyes were full of disbelief, and he couldnt figure out how Lu Yi Ye had managed to crush him so utterly just now. The sudden, explosive force the young man had displayed was nothing like he had ever heard, much less felt.</p><p>His flying Spirit Artifact was lying next to his feet, but it was basically broken after that impact. Flying Spirit Artifacts were generally quite fragile.</p><p>He staggered a few steps before looking up into the sky. However, Lu Ye was nowhere to be seen. He was just watching his surroundings when suddenly, he heard footsteps coming from the side. He turned around and saw Lu Ye walking slowly toward him.</p><p>Somehow, he felt even more pressure than ever before, so much so that his breathing was starting to feel constricted.</p><p>Zhuo Jianchen pointed his sword at Lu Ye and yelled, Why didnt you go all out from the start!?</p><p>He had realized far too late that Lu Yi Ye hadnt brought out his full strength. That was why he thought for a moment it was possible to win.</p><p>[What the fuck is this? Its not enough that he humiliated my junior sister, he must humiliate me as well to satisfy his perverted desires?]</p><p>Lu Ye was going to ignore Zhuo Jianchens question, but in the end he said, I wanted to check out how strong a ranker between the thirtieth to the fortieth place is.</p><p>After the first three upper fifty rankers he killed, everyone he challenged afterward had rejected his challenge request immediately. As a result, he knew nothing about the strength of the rankers in this range.</p><p>Since Zhuo Jianchen was kind enough to accept his challenge, of course he wasnt going to kill him that quickly.</p><p>And?</p><p>Its a bit disappointing.</p><p>Zhuo Jianchens eyes twitched uncontrollably at the careless yet scathing comment. He was about to say more when he saw Lu Ye charging toward him again, Spiritual Power rising.</p><p>I</p><p>Roar!</p><p>Zhuo Jianchen only managed to say one word before he felt like his head was struck by a hammer. For an instant, he couldnt tell where he was or what he was doing.</p><p>That said, he was a sword cultivator, one who could control seven flying weapons at once no less. At the very least, his mind was tougher than the generic Spirit Creek Realm cultivator.</p><p>That was why he was able to finish his declaration the moment he regained his consciousness, surrender!</p><p>Unfortunately, it was too late. Lu Ye was already standing behind him and sheathing his sword.</p><p>Zhuo Jianchen exhaled slightly and looked at the clouds above him. He then murmured, So this is how!</p><p>This was how Lu Yi Ye had prevented his allies from being able to surrender</p><p>He did finish his sentence, but in the end, it was just a little too late.</p><p>The thirty-fourth name on the Scroll of Supremacy shuddered a little. Then, it crumbled and was replaced by Lu Yi Ye of the Crimson Blood Sect.</p><p>This content is taken from ùìÅùëñùëèùëüùò¶ùí∂ùò•.ùí∏ùò∞ùëö</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
