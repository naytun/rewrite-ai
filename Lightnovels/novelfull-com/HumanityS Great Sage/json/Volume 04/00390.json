It was because they would only be giving their enemies the opportunity to take advantage of them.</p><p>When Lu Ye tried to challenge the ninety-ninth ranker though, he received a surprising response. As it turned out, the guy was currently being challenged</p><p>It should not need to be said, but a ranker could not accept two challenges at the same time. Even if Lu Ye must challenge the guy, he must wait until they were finished with their latest battle.</p><p>So, he set his sights on the ninety-eighth rankeronly to discover that they were currently being challenged as well.</p><p>Now that he thought about it, the last three spots on the Scroll of Supremacy must be in a state of constant turmoil. In fact, those who didnt have the strength to climb up the ranks would probably be removed very quickly even if they somehow got on the rank list by chance.</p><p>Lu Ye was about to resign himself to a long wait when the name of the one hundredth ranker suddenly distorted and disappeared. The next moment, a new name appeared on the list.</p><p>It meant that the previous one hundredth ranker had been defeated and replaced by a new ranker!</p><p>Lu Ye hurriedly checked the affiliation of the new ranker and confirmed that they were from the Thousand Demon Ridge. He immediately issued them a challenge request. This time, he didnt receive an automated response saying that the ranker was currently being challenged.</p><p>It didnt take long before the challenge request was accepted. They had to accept. Lu Ye would replace them if they rejected the challenge request or ignored it for too long.</p><p>The battle didnt begin immediately because the ranker had just finished a battle and ascended the Scroll of Supremacy. Of course they were going to take a moment to recover their strength.</p><p>While waiting, Lu Ye continued to consume Spirit Pills and feed the Tree of Glyphs the Flame of Earthen Spirits. At the same time, he spared some concentration to research the Scroll of Supremacy.</p><p>Most of his understanding of the Scroll of Supremacy consisted of hearsay. Although he had ascended to the thirty-third spot for a time, the Thousand Demon Ridge had come together to flush him out of the rank list in just three days. He had never even fought a challenge battle before. That was why he couldnt claim to know the Scroll of Supremacy very well at all.</p><p>Four hours passed in the blink of an eye. The moment he felt a response in his Battlefield Imprint, Lu Ye immediately paused what he was doing and got ready for battle.</p><p>He felt the power of the Heavens descending from the sky before enveloping his entire person. The next second, the space around him began to distort, and his vision was filled by a blinding white light.</p><p>When the white light faded, he saw a young man in his twenties standing a short distance opposite him. It was most likely the Thousand Demon Ridge ranker he was challenging.</p><p>Gao~ ùô°ùôûùôóùíìùôöùì™ùôô.ùíÑùì∏ùì∂</p><p>Huh?</p><p>Lu Ye turned toward the noise and discovered that Amber and Yi Yi were standing right next to him and examining their surroundings curiously. Amber was sleeping, and Yi Yi was cultivating a while ago. Somehow, they had both been dragged into this battlefield.</p><p>Where are we, Lu Ye? Yi Yi asked.</p><p>Ill tell you later.</p><p>Lu Ye turned back to his opponent. Right now, the Thousand Demon Ridge cultivator was busy picking up his jaw from the floor. This was supposed to be a one-versus-one battle, right? So why was he facing down two cultivators and a Tamed Beast?</p><p>He could understand why the tiger was present in the battle. Some of the rankers on the Scroll of Supremacy were Beast Tamers, and they often brought more than one Tamed Beast with them. But what about the girl? This was just ridiculous!</p><p>He was just about to ask Lu Ye what the hell was going on when suddenly, he discovered that the man looked highly familiar. Then, he realized that he was none other than the sonuvabitch his entire faction had been searching for to no avail!</p><p>Last time, the Yi Ye Elimination Front had lost track of him despite turning the location where he was last discovered upside down. Who wouldve thought that the bastard would challenge the Scroll of Supremacy just two days later?</p><p>Lu Yi Ye! The Thousand Demon Ridge cultivator growled. He wasnt sure whether to laugh or cry at his luck.</p><p>To the Thousand Demon Ridge, Lu Yi Ye represented an opportunity to obtain an unimaginable amount of wealth. If he could kill him here, the bounty would go to him and him alone.</p><p>However, Lu Yi Ye was also beyond formidable. He might have been strong enough to barely make it on the Scroll of Supremacy, he wasnt confident that he could defeat the young man at all.</p><p>The Thousand Demon Ridge cultivator had just finished crying out Lu Yes name when the combat cultivator rushed toward him. He swore. He had purposely chosen a battle arenaa small area with no obstacles and a radius of only tens of metersduring the battlefield selection phase because he was a combat cultivator himself. It would maximize his advantage and, depending on his opponents faction and fighting style, minimize the enemys.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lu Ye was a combat cultivator just like him. His chosen battlefield benefited both of them.</p><p>Since Lu Ye had applied Windwalk to himself, he moved so fast that he almost left a blur behind his trail. The distance between himself and his opponent was rapidly shrinking.</p><p>[His speed is crazy!] The Thousand Demon Ridge cultivator thought to himself in fear as he summoned his own Spirit Artifact. Although he did not think that he was a match for Lu Yi Ye, he was a cultivator who managed to ascend the Scroll of Supremacy. He could not possibly surrender without a fight.</p><p>Whistling sounds pierced the eardrums while Lu Ye was charging. His nine flying weapons were flying toward his opponent in a straight line.</p><p>The Thousand Demon Ridge cultivator had heard of Lu Yes prowess with flying weapons ages ago. He immediately slapped a Golden Body Talisman Paper on himself and channeled all of his Spiritual Power to protect himself.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>It was at this moment the tiger let out a mighty roar. Visible shockwaves swept across the Thousand Demon Ridge cultivator and made him feel as if someone had smashed his head with a hammer. Not only was he seeing stars and hurting like a bitch, the roar had dispersed his Spiritual Power in an instant.</p><p>He was shocked to say the least. He never knew that Lu Yi Yes white tiger possessed such power.</p><p>He had just recollected himself when he saw a wide range of spells flying toward him from the flank. It was the girl who had somehow entered the battlefield with Lu Yi Ye. Not only was she casting spells at a prodigious speed, the spells themselves were incredibly varied and numerous.</p><p>Despite the Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators best efforts, he was unable to dodge all of the spells. The golden light shrouding his body faded at a visible rate.</p><p>A sense of impending doom struck the combat cultivator, and he tried to yell, I surren</p><p>He never managed to finish the last syllable. The flying weapons pierced through his Golden Body Talisman Paper, his protective Spiritual Power, and even his armor like they were paper. The powerful impacts knocked him backward again and again until finally, Lu Ye reached him and unsheathed the Inviolable. His head flew, and his headless corpse spewed blood like a fountain and dyed the floor red.</p><p>Several meters away, Lu Ye shook off the blood on his saber before returning it to his sheath. He then shook his head in disappointment and thought to himself: [Too weak!]</p><p>He had killed many Heaven Nine cultivators since he became a Heaven Seven cultivator and entered the Core Circle. However, this was the first time he slew a Scroll of Supremacy ranker in direct combat. Unfortunately, it was a most unsatisfactory fight.</p><p>Sure, Amber and Yi Yi had interfered with the battle, but the level of skill his opponent had displayed still disappointed him greatly.</p><p>Now that he thought about it, he had not fought anyone in single combat since he came to the Core Circle. The Scroll of Supremacy was giving him the chance to enjoy a form of combat he sorely missed, and to measure himself against its champions. Of course, he was also going to obey his fourth senior brothers instruction and hit the highest rank he could reach in the shortest amount of time possible!</p><p>After Yi Yi had picked up the dead mans Storage Bag and Spirit Artifact, she suddenly exclaimed in realization, Lu Ye Lu Ye, this is the challenge battle of the Scroll of Supremacy, isnt it?</p><p>It took her some time, but she finally realized where they were.</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Honestly, Lu Ye didnt think Yi Yi and Amber would be teleported into the battlefield with him. Then again, Amber was his Tamed Beast, and the Heavens accepted the participation of Tamed Beasts in the Scroll of Supremacy. As Yi Yi was Ambers Ghost Spirit, she too was dragged into the battlefield.</p><p>This gave him a massive advantage over his opponents to say the least.</p><p>Time to go home, Lu Ye beckoned.</p><p>The Heavens power enveloped him, and the next thing he knew, he was back in their wooden building once more.</p><p>After they had returned, Yi Yi floated out of the window and sat down in front of Lu Ye. Amber leaped onto his legs and waited patiently for Lu Ye to make his next move. They both knew that Lu Ye would not be satisfied with just one battle and were ready to give it their all.</p><p>And so Lu Ye activated his Battlefield Imprint, connected with the Scroll of Supremacy, and tried to challenge the ninety-ninth ranker on the list once more. Unfortunately, the ranker was still in the middle of a challenge. So, he selected the ninety-eighth ranker and tried again.</p><p>To his surprise, he succeeded. Even more surprising was the fact that his opponent hadnt left him to dry for too long. Just an hour later, he felt the Heavens teleporting him to a new battlefield.</p><p>His second battlefield looked almost the same as the first. It was also a small area with a radius of only tens of meters.</p><p>Generally speaking, only a combat cultivator or a body-tempering cultivator would pick a battlefield like this. Ghost cultivators, spell cultivators and everyone else wouldve picked a wider terrain.</p><p>When the white light faded, Lu Ye immediately saw a brawny cultivator opposite him. He was most likely a body-tempering cultivator.</p><p>The body-tempering cultivator was currently wearing a frown on his face. It was because he thought he saw a white figure entering the ground behind Lu Ye. However, he wasnt sure if it was actually a person, or if he was just seeing things because white light always filled ones vision when the Heavens teleported the combatants into the Scroll of Supremacys exclusive battlefield.</p><p>The white figure was Yi Yi of course. She had slipped into the underground and concealed her presence so that the body-tempering cultivator would not realize that this was really a two versus onethree if you counted Amberand get unnecessarily nervous.</p><p>And of course, she would be able to ambush him better if he didnt know she was there.</p><p>The body-tempering cultivator had already channeled his Spiritual Power and vitality. He was carrying a large shield on his left arm and wielding a spiked hammer on his right. The head of the hammer was covered in sharp reverse spikes. Not even Lu Ye would want to get hit by a weapon like this.</p><p>The body-tempering cultivator raised the shield in front of himself and hit it once with his hammer. As if the action wasnt provoking enough, he said, Come at me, you little</p><p>He suddenly stared at Lu Yes face and exclaimed in shock, The Vanquisher of Sects?</p><p>Lu Ye was already charging toward the body-tempering cultivator. As usual, he had empowered himself with Windwalk and was moving so fast that he was a blur.</p><p>The body-tempering cultivator blanched as the distance between them shortened. It hadnt been easy defeating his previous opponent and making it on the Scroll of Supremacy. He wasnt expecting to be challenged by the walking calamity at all. It was highly unlikely he was going to be able to preserve his spot.</p><p>New novel chapters are published on ùíçùíäùôóùìªùíÜùì™ùôô.ùôòùô§ùô¢</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
