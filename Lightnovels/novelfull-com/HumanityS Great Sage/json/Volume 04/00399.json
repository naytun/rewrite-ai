It was thought it was because his opponents were so weak that they didnt even have the chance to surrender.</p><p>But what about now?</p><p>Zhuo Jianchen was the thirty-fourth ranker. He couldnt possibly be so weak that he didnt even have the chance to surrender, could he? Not to mention that he was a sword cultivator.</p><p>There was no chance he had chosen to fight Lu Yi Ye to the death either. No one was that stupid.</p><p>In any case, countless people were watching Lu Yi Yes progress and wondering where his limits lay. The top twenty? Top ten? Maybe even the champion?</p><p>Meanwhile, the Thousand Demon Ridge cultivators sitting above Lu Ye on the Scroll of Supremacy were feeling more pressured than ever before.</p><p>After killing Zhou Jianchen, Lu Yi Ye of the Crimson Blood Sect once again shot through the rankings at meteoric speed. In less than half a tea time, he had gone from the thirty-fourth place to the twentieth place!</p><p>Every Thousand Demon Ridge ranker within this range had rejected Lu Yes challenge request. They did not think they were overwhelmingly stronger than Zhuo Jianchen, and the sword cultivator had still been slain without being able to surrender. With so many unknown factors in play, it was only natural that they werent going to risk their lives.</p><p>But of course, Lu Yes journey up the Scroll of Supremacy wasnt going to be smooth-sailing the whole way. The size of a rankers confidence was proportional to their rank, and most of them firmly believed that they could do what the others couldnt do.</p><p>That was why the seventeenth ranker did not hesitate to accept Lu Yes challenge. In fact, they didnt even keep Lu Ye waiting for long. Ten breaths after Lu Ye sent out the challenge request, both combatants were teleported to the battlefield.</p><p>This proved that the seventeenth ranker had been preparing themselves for this battle for a while. They were just waiting for Lu Ye to challenge them.</p><p>The battlefield turned out to be Lu Yes favorite. It was small enough that he did not need to waste time searching for his opponent, and it was pretty suitable for close quarters combat.</p><p>Lu Ye looked up and saw a tall, muscular man with bronze-colored skin. His vitality was as powerful as his physique might suggest.</p><p>He had no doubt that his opponent was a body-tempering cultivator.</p><p>What caught Lu Yes attention was the man had a pair of long, curled horns growing out of the edges of his forehead. Not only that, his upper body was bare, and he had colorful tattoos on his chest, waist and arms.</p><p>[Are those visible Tattoos?]</p><p>There were millions and millions of cultivators in Jiu Zhou, and everyone possessed their own distinct personality. Some people were shy and reserved, and some were passionate and exuberant. This body-tempering cultivator, for example, was probably a show-off.</p><p>The fact that the guy had multiple visible Tattoos on his body alone was proof that he wasnt someone to be messed with. A weaker cultivator wouldve felt massive pressure at the sight of these visible Tattoos alone. After all, it was impossible to tell what amazing powers they might possess until the enemy had revealed them. 𝓵𝙞𝓫𝒓𝙚𝓪𝓭.𝒄𝓸𝓶</p><p>Lu Ye looked at the two curled horns on his opponents forehead again. Assuming he wasnt mistaken, his opponent was probably a mutant cultivator!</p><p>Most mutant cultivators possessed great vitality and were naturally suited to become body-tempering cultivators. This guy in particular was even wearing a pair of vambraces and spiked gloves. They were clearly high quality Spirit Artifacts as well.</p><p>This was the first time Lu Ye encountered a body-tempering cultivator who did not wield a Shield Spirit Artifact. That was how he knew his opponent must be incredibly resilient.</p><p>There were multiple types of body-tempering cultivators, and the mutant cultivator in front of him was the aggressive type. Their damage output might not rival that of a combat cultivator, but their tough defense more than made up for that weakness.</p><p>Are you Lu Yi Ye, meh? The mutant cultivator cried from a distance.</p><p>Lu Yes response was to eject his flying weapons and send them flying toward the mutant cultivator. When the first one reached the mutant cultivator, he only needed to swing his hand once to send it flying. However, the second, third, fourth and more were right behind it</p><p>Metallic clanks resounded in the battlefield as the mutant cultivator repeatedly knocked the flying weapons away with his Vambrace Spirit Artifact. A while later, he got annoyed and taunted, Come over yourself if you dare!</p><p>Lu Ye simply ignored the mutant cultivator and continued harrying the mutant cultivator with his flying weapons. From time to time, he would even imbue them with a Glyph to catch his enemy off guard.</p><p>And it did. The mutant cultivator grew visibly angry and attempted to break through the storm of metal. However, Lu Ye was able to drive him back each time.</p><p>One thing Lu Ye had to give the mutant cultivator credit for was that he was surprisingly nimble for his size. He hadnt been able to injure him once even though he was attacking with nine flying weapons.</p><p>Not only that, Lu Ye realized that the mutant cultivator was only pretending to be angry. He was wearing an expression that suggested that he was out of his mind with anger, but in reality his eyes were calm and steady.</p><p>Wayaya! Im so angry, meh! Im gonna kill you!</p><p>Some time later, the mutant cultivator let out an angry roar. Then, the tattoo in front of his chest abruptly shone and summoned what looked like a blood red beast that Lu Ye could not recognize. It let out a mighty roar that shook the eardrums and blew all nine of Lu Yes flying weapons away.</p><p>The mutant cultivator immediately used this opportunity to barrel down on Lu Ye like a mountain. He was able to close the gap and bring down his fist.</p><p>Lu Ye nimbly leaped into the air to dodge the attack. While he was above the mutant cultivators head, he unsheathed the Inviolable and slashed at the back of his opponents neck. 𝒍𝒊𝙗𝓻𝒆𝓪𝙙.𝙘𝙤𝙢</p><p>However, the mutant cultivator once again displayed an uncanny level of agility by turning around faster than Lu Ye thought was possible and punching toward the Inviolable. At the same time, he aimed his free hand at Lu Ye and conjured what looked like a round disc at the center of his palm. It was a spell!</p><p>Who wouldve thought that this brawny, outwardly rash body-tempering cultivator would be a spell cultivator as well? Judging from his casting speed, his talent in spell cultivation was pretty high, too.</p><p>A look of triumph flashed across the mutant cultivators face. On the surface, he had made a rash attack and exposed his weak spot to his enemy. In reality, he was just baiting Lu Ye into his trap. He had killed many Grand Sky Coalition rankers this way.</p><p>Twang! The Inviolable slammed into the mans metal-clad fist. The mutant cultivator immediately tensed because he felt as if he was punching a mountain, not a saber. His knees buckled, and his knees nearly hit the ground.</p><p>At the same time, Lu Ye was sailing across the air as well. The punch had been astoundingly powerful.</p><p>The mutant cultivator immediately crouched to adjust his center of gravity before firing the spell he had been channeling at Lu Ye, striking him squarely in the chest. It was a spell that contained both Spiritual Power and vitality.</p><p>The attack pushed Lu Ye further towards the edge of the battlefield before he finally landed on his feet.</p><p>After the unnatural force pressing down on his shoulders had disappeared, the mutant cultivator rose to his feet and looked at Lu Ye. His eyes twitched when he realized that the young man who was just catching himself looked perfectly unharmed.</p><p>He had heard for a long time that Lu Yi Ye of the Crimson Blood Sect used a defensive Glyph to protect himself from hard hits. Now, he had finally witnessed it with his own eyes.</p><p>His spell had definitely struck Lu Ye, but he clearly saw a Glyph barrier appearing out of nowhere and blocking it at the last moment. As a result, all his surprise attack had gotten him was a disheveled appearance.</p><p>There was around a hundred meters of distance between the two. The mutant cultivator grinned at Lu Ye before saying, As a body-tempering cultivator, its only right that I know a handful of spells, meh?</p><p>Lu Ye nodded silently before dipping his head and walking toward the mutant cultivator. A second later, he abruptly blurred and left a series of afterimages behind him.</p><p>The mutant cultivator blanched instantly. At the Spirit Creek Realm level, this was the first time he saw anyone who could move so quickly!</p><p>He hurriedly focused his eyes and attempted to identify Lu Yes direction, but the combat cultivator was already swinging his saber at him. He hurriedly raised his arms to block the attack only to realize that he had been tricked. His senses told him that there was a terrific burst of Spiritual Power aimed straight at his back.</p><p>He hastily turned around and swung his arm.</p><p>Kwang! The Inviolable slammed against the vambrace caused sparks to fly. Once again, he felt as if a mountain had struck him. The mutant cultivator forced himself to remain steady, but a blast of heat struck him before he could catch himself completely. He saw what looked like a Fire Phoenix straight out of the myths flying straight toward him. The heat was unbearable even from a distance.</p><p>[Oh yeah! Lu Yi Ye is an expert in spell-casting as well!]</p><p>Not only that, his casting speed and strength were clearly a cut above his.</p><p>The fiery spell enveloped the mutant cultivator. However, a terrific burst of vitality tore the Fire Phoenix to shreds and revealed his muscular body.</p><p>Before he could glimpse his surroundings though, Lu Yi Yes saber was flying toward him yet again. He just barely managed to block it before the Fire Phoenix engulfed it once more.</p><p>Saber, spell, saber, spell, saber, spell</p><p>It was as if it would never end.</p><p>From a third persons perspective, the mutant cultivator was going up and down and up and down again like he was doing squat exercises in the middle of combat. He wanted to escape Lu Yes seemingly endless saber-and-spell attack, but of course the combat cultivator wasnt going to allow him to do so.</p><p>The mutant cultivator was obviously frustrated. His body was strong, but there was only so much it could endure against an unreasonable opponent like Lu Yi Ye. At the same time, he chided himself for showing off his spells when he couldve just stuck to more conventional, body-tempering cultivator-like tactics. As a consequence of pissing off the combat cultivator, death was now breathing down his neck!</p><p>Suddenly, he heard a shatter that turned his blood into ice. It was his vambraces shattering after receiving Heavens know how many strikes from Lu Yi Ye! He hurriedly activated the Tattoo on his chest and let out a mighty roar that blew away his enemys attacks. He then seized the opportunity to put some distance between himself and Lu Ye while panting heavily.</p><p>The duo were now thirty meters apart. There wasnt a single hair to be found on the mutant cultivators skin not because he was hairless to begin with, but because the Fire Phoenixes had burned it all.</p><p>Lu Yes gaze darted between the mutant cultivators abdomen and his arms something about the Tattoos didnt feel right</p><p>What are you looking at? Yeah, theyre normal tattoos. So what? I like having tattoos, okay? The mutant cultivator erupted in embarrassment and anger.</p><p>As it turned out, the only tattoo on the mutant cultivators body that was a Tattoo-type Glyph was the one on his chest. The rest were just normal tattoos. Of course, they looked no different from a visible Tattoo, so revealing them was one way to put pressure on his opponents.</p><p>This chapter is updated by 𝘭𝑖𝘣𝓇ℯ𝘢𝒹.𝘤ℴ𝘮</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
