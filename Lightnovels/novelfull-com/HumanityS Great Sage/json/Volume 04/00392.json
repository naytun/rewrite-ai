If he knew this would happen, he wouldve spent all of his Contribution Points when he was visiting the Divine Trade Association a few days ago.</p><p>His annoyance lasted until he checked his Battlefield Imprint and noted that he had a little over two thousand five hundred Contribution Points left. It was enough to purchase ten Flames of Earthen Spirits, but not enough to unlock the special Glyph. He could sell all the loot he had obtained for the past few days, but they werent worth a lot of Contribution Points.</p><p>[Where am I going to get the Flame of Earthen Spirits I need?] He thought to himself with a frown.</p><p>At the same time, in the Outpost of a Tier-Two sect, a pair of Thousand Demon Ridge Heaven Nine cultivators were sitting side by side on a giant rock next to a cliff. The man was handsome and dignified, while the woman possessed the face of an angel and the body of a demon. Right now, the woman was currently nestled in the mans arms.</p><p>Not only were they the Legate and prolegate of their Outpost, they were also rankers on the Scroll of Supremacy. The woman, Bai Lan, was the forty-eighth ranker on the Scroll of Supremacy. She wore a loose robe with wide sleeves that marked her as a spell cultivator. Combat cultivators, body-tempering cultivators and ghost cultivators generally wore tight-fitting clothes so they wouldnt be bogged down when fighting against an enemy.</p><p>However, her assets were so that even the generous amount of fabric was unable to conceal them completely.</p><p>Bai Lan said sweetly while holding the mans hand, Do not worry about me, senior brother. I will choose a terrain that best fits my abilities. No matter how powerful that Lu Yi Ye is, he cannot possibly kill me in one strike, can he? If he is stronger than expected, then Ill just surrender the fight.</p><p>The woman was unaware of this, but most of the rankers Lu Ye slew had thought the exact same thing when they accepted Lu Yes challenge. [Im a Heaven Nine,] they had thought to themselves, [even if I am no match for him, surely he cant kill me before I forfeit the match?] ùìÅùò™ùëèùëü‚ÑØùí∂ùëë.ùëê‚Ñ¥ùòÆ</p><p>They were wrong.</p><p>Are you sure that its Lu Yi Ye that challenged you? The man asked worriedly.</p><p>Bai Lan giggled behind her palm. He has been challenging the Scroll of Supremacy non-stop for the past few days, and he hasnt skipped a single Thousand Demon Ridge cultivator above his spot. Today, he sits at the fiftieth spot, and the forty-ninth ranker is a Grand Sky Coalition. Who else would challenge me if not him?</p><p>That ruffian perhaps you should just forfeit the challenge, junior sister</p><p>If I forfeit his challenge, it will be the sect who loses face. In the future, how will our junior brothers and junior sisters be able to hold their heads high in the Core Circle?</p><p>A Scroll of Supremacy elite who did not even have the courage to accept the enemys challenge would only be known as a laughing stock no matter how powerful they were. This was before mentioning that Lu Yes climb was watched by many Divine Ocean Realm cultivators as well. They all thought that this was an opportunity to kill the young man.</p><p>While Lu Ye had hidden himself so well that no one could find him on the Spirit Creek Battlefield, this wasnt a problem if someone on the Scroll of Supremacy could kill him during the challenge battles.</p><p>The bottom fifty rankers had proven to be incapable of doing the job, but that was fine. They still had the top fifty rankers!</p><p>If even the top fifty rankers proved to be lacking, there were still the top ten rankers to seal the deal!</p><p>No matter how strong Lu Yi Ye was, he could not possibly make it to the peak as a Heaven Eight cultivator, could he? Someone had to be capable of killing him!</p><p>But</p><p>The man wanted to say more, but Bai Lan had already pressed a finger to his lips. Enough. You really dont have to worry about me. A few days ago, my master gave me a High-Grade Spiritual Artifact with excellent defensive capabilities. Although I am not able to unleash its full power at my current cultivation level, I will not be in danger no matter what happens.</p><p>The guy looked at the single, tear-shaped earring hanging on her ear. He exclaimed in realization, So, thats the Spiritual Artifact Second Elder gave you.</p><p>Bai Lans lips curled into a teasing smile. Duh? Did you think it was someone elses gift?</p><p>The man let out an awkward chuckle, and Bai Lan immediately tickled him. How dare you question my loyalty, senior brother!</p><p>The man hurriedly begged for mercy.</p><p>Four hours came and went in the blink of an eye. Bai Lan vanished under her lovers worried gaze.</p><p>The battlefield was a beautiful garden about eight to ten kilometers in radius. It was filled with vegetation and the fresh scent of flowers.</p><p>As usual, Yi Yi dove underground as soon as she was able, and Lu Ye examined his surroundings after his vision had recovered. He did not see anyone.</p><p>Judging from the name on the Scroll of Supremacy, his opponent should be a woman. Considering how large the battlefield was, he could safely assume that she wasnt a body-tempering cultivator or a combat cultivator. As for the likelihood that she might be a medicine cultivator that was just impossible.</p><p>There were a handful of medicine cultivators among the bottom fifty rankersthey all had cultivated another cultivation factionbut that was not the case in the top fifty.</p><p>A cultivators focus was limited after all. Even if they were extraordinarily talented, their secondary Way was usually inferior to their primary.</p><p>[So, is it a spell cultivator or a ghost cultivator?]</p><p>Lu Ye had fought around twenty to thirty battles for the past couple days, and he had basically fought them all besides medicine cultivators. He even encountered a handful of cultivators that did not conform to the Six Factions.</p><p>For most combat cultivators, body-tempering cultivators were the bane of their existence. However, Lu Ye was no ordinary combat cultivator. Not only was his physique on par or better than most Spirit Creek Realm body-tempering cultivators, he could usually end a fight against his supposed bane in just two or three exchanges.</p><p>As for ghost cultivators, whose frailty was a match for spell cultivators lets just say that anyone who dared to get close to Lu Ye had been treated to the most frightening staredown of their lives before they were sent to the afterlife!</p><p>Of all the cultivation factions, ghost cultivators were Lu Yes favorite bar none. They would walk right up to him like lambs to the slaughter because they thought he couldnt see them. Ghost cultivators were easily the easiest prey of all the cultivators he had fought.</p><p>His second favorite prey were spell cultivators. As long as their defenses were broken, it took only a single hit to kill them.</p><p>As usual, Lu Ye left the matter of searching the enemy to Yi Yi. While waiting, he tossed a couple of Spirit Pills into his mouth and crunched them slowly.</p><p>Ever since he started cultivating, he had eaten enough Spirit Pills to shit a mountain of them. He was just as done in regards to their taste. If he ever got the chance to meet a pill maker, he was going to ask, no, beg them to make it apple-flavored or orange-flavored. Heck, he would even settle for banana-flavored Spirit Pills</p><p>He ate at least dozens of Spirit Pills every single day to cultivate his Spiritual Power. These days, he found it harder to swallow the damn pills than to fight a life-and-death battle.</p><p>Lu Yes mind was wondering when Yi Yi finally informed him that she had found the female cultivator. However, she was constantly changing positions to avoid being ambushed by Lu Ye.</p><p>Lu Ye, Lu Ye, shes huge! Yi Yi sent him a weird message.</p><p>Excuse me?</p><p>Shes even bigger than Sister Hua Ci.</p><p>You mean her age?</p><p>No! You know what I mean.</p><p>Kids should not be thinking such things.</p><p>You better not show her mercy.</p><p>Meanwhile, Bai Lan was watching her surroundings warily while on the move. She didnt dare to ride on her flying Spirit Artifact because everyone knew that Lu Yes telekinesis skill was unrivaled in the entire Spirit Creek Battlefield at this point. The guy was even faster than sword cultivators. She would only be committing suicide if she, a spell cultivator, dared to challenge him to an aerial battle.</p><p>She kept swiveling her head from side to side while dashing from place to place. As a spell cultivator, the only chance she might defeat Lu Ye was to stay out of his range. Given enough distance, Lu Yi Ye could be the god of combat cultivators, and he would still be blasted to pieces by her spells.</p><p>Suddenly, she came to a stop. It was because she saw a man directly on her path. It was almost as if he had been waiting for her to show up.</p><p>Of course, he was Lu Yi Ye.</p><p>Bai Lans reaction was immediate and swift. Without hesitation, she cast a spell that caused ripples to appear across the space in front of her before it transformed into a fog. Then three fearsome beasts composed of pure Spiritual Power emerged from within the fog and pounced toward Lu Ye from three different directions.</p><p>She raised a finger next and summoned a massive disc made of Spiritual Power above her head. Symbols could be seen spinning within the disc as arrows made of water rained down on Lu Ye.</p><p>Lu Ye raised a curious eyebrow. [Now were talking. I shouldve known that the top fifty rankers would be a cut above the bottom fifties. Her spell casting speed and strength are the strongest Ive seen yet.]</p><p>Of the five Attributes, Water Attribute spell techniques were generally weaker in terms of power. However, the water spells Bai Lan was casting did not have such a problem. They were just as powerful as an identical spell with a different Attribute.</p><p>Lu Yes Weapon Holder shook slightly as nine flying weapons cut across the air. He split them into three groups of three to handle the three beasts. At the same time, he unsheathed the Inviolable, channeled his Spiritual Power, and parried all the water arrows flying his way with unerring accuracy.</p><p>Fire and Water Attribute Spiritual Power clashed against one another. It wasnt long before the space between them was covered in mist.</p><p>Bai Lan was watching Lu Ye like a hawk. Her expression was flat, but she was shocked on the inside. She already knew that Lu Yi Yes mind was powerful, but to control nine flying weapons like his own fingers and even parry her water arrows perfectly? That was beyond what she thought was possible at the Spirit Creek Realm level.</p><p>Not only did her attacks fail to pressure her opponent, he was saying with his actions that they werent even enough to force him to adopt evasive maneuvers.</p><p>At that moment, Bai Lan was jealous of Lu Ye. Every spell cultivator wanted to have a strong mind because it meant that their control would improve, and their spells would grow stronger. They would even undergo special training to strengthen their mind.</p><p>Lu Yi Ye was a combat cultivator, but for some reason his mind was far, far stronger than a spell cultivators. How could she not be jealous of him?</p><p>The round disc above her head slowly vanished, and water arrows stopped flying toward Lu Ye. As he withdrew his saber, he suddenly frowned and summoned all nine of his flying weapons back to his Weapon Holder.</p><p>A quick check revealed to him that his connection with his nine flying weapons had diminished considerably. This meant that the three beasts made of Water Attribute Spiritual Power werent just an offensive spell. Tey possessed corrosive qualities as well.</p><p>To do this without him realizing it until the last moment it was probably Bai Lans unique ability.</p><p>Anyone who tried to attack her with flying weapons would find themselves at a severe disadvantage. Her ability corroded the weapons and weakened their power over time.</p><p>Bai Lan was about to cast another spell when suddenly, Lu Ye raised a hand to stop her. Wait.</p><p>Bai Lan watched him warily while asking, What?</p><p>Lu Ye rarely spoke with his enemies during battle, but for the unignited leaves in Tree of Glyphs, he was willing to break his silence.</p><p>I want twenty Flames of Earthen Spirits.</p><p>Excuse me? Bai Lan was completely confused. This was the challenge battle of the Scroll of Supremacy; a duel that usually ended with the death or surrender or the loser. So why was Lu Yi Ye asking her to give him, what was it called again, Flames of Earthen Spirits?</p><p>[Did he hit himself in the head or something?]</p><p>Its sold in the Vault of Providence for two hundred Contribution Points a piece. I want twenty!</p><p>She instinctively calculated the total cost, Thats four thousand Contribution Points?</p><p>Then, she shook her head in frustration.
