At most, they were able to create just one clone that had the power to inflict doubt on people about heaven and earth. Otherwise, this supreme art imparted from Primogenitor Daode was rendered useless. Nobody imagined that Chong He, who was not outstanding in the Dharmakaya of Pure Sun Sect’s history, would have success. Furthermore, he had set the Immortal-slaying Sword Formation by himself, preventing the sneak attack that was intended by Han Guang and Tai Li!</p><p>For a while, cyan, red, white and black lights of the sword mingled and all things in the array disappeared completely, becoming a frightening power of destruction. Earth Fire and Geomancy seemed to be recultivated. Suddenly, Han Guang and Tai Li were caught between a rock and a hard place.</p><p>While Tai Li was making a raid on Chong He, ‘Prime Asuras’ Meng Nan leaped into midair without blinking and snatched the Withering Bodhi Tree!</p><p>The three powers of the West Regions were Turf Lords, which meant that they knew about the appearance of the demonic cult. However, they had a tacit agreement: the Monster King wouldn’t stop them from looting the Buddha’s Palm Primary Instruction, and they wouldn’t disturb the Monster King’s affairs. So that was why Tai Li could leave without worrying about being chased by Prime Asuras who joined hands with Chong He!</p><p>If it weren’t for the fact that Chong He had taken precautions early, he’d be dead or at least badly hurt!</p><p>For that reason, Meng Nan turned a blind eye to the White-tiger Monster King and One-legged Ox Monster King. There was not the slightest hint of the animosity between men and monsters.</p><p>He attacked with the combination of the sword, the fire bead, the black lotus, and the long spear. His six arms were attacking with the different weapons in a round robin manner, striking the contemporary Bliss Bodhisattva and Shui Yue Nunnery.</p><p>The flames lit up the sky, drying up the boundless Fish Sea and the Ninth Order Lotus Pad shook. The black lotus bloomed and blocked the suction of the Yuan Magnetic palm. The sword and the long spear each attacked one side, suppressing “Guanyin Willow Branch” and “Scarf of the Bodhisattva’s Bliss”. With his own strength, he restrained two masters who held divine weapons.</p><p>Yet the monster with four feet, three arms, and half a monkey’s face shook its head, suddenly jumping on the Withering Bodhi Tree!</p><p>At this moment, it seemed that nobody could stop it!</p><p>He Qi turned into an invisible sword as he fought the One-legged Ox Monster King. Suddenly, he noticed that the opponent intended to retreat. Meanwhile, he also sensed that Buddha’s Palm Primary Instruction was going to fall into the monster’s hands. He intended to use his sword to stop the Nine Heavens, but he noticed that the One-legged Ox Monster King was moving toward Chong He, so he decided to join the siege.</p><p>In the Monster King’s mind, “The Buddha’s Palm” was useless. If it weren’t for the fact that he wanted to weaken the Human tribe, he wouldn’t even bother getting involved!</p><p>He Qi ‘s emotions swayed slightly but quickly calmed down, then the formless and soundless sword spread.</p><p>Suddenly, there was an uninterrupted popping sound around One-legged Ox Monster King. His Purple Thunder protection was suddenly riddled with countless holes. Had the Thunder Light not blocked most of the power and if Monster King didn’t have a strong body, he would’ve become a sieve.</p><p>The worst thing was that he had no clue where the sword Qi had come from!</p><p>He Qi had used up all his tricks. He had expended all of his strength not for the attainment of the Buddha’s Palm but to deal with the demonic cult.</p><p>In his opinion, the Buddha’s Palm was indeed valuable and could be imparted to future generations, however, it could only be used as a reference. Eastsea Sword Village didn’t lack impartation. It was great if he attained it, but not at any cost.</p><p>If Chong He fell, unless he immediately left with Cui Qinghe gave up the Buddha’s Palm Primary Instruction, they would definitely be targeted by Monster King and Han Guang. Even if they didn’t end up like Chong He, a hefty price would have been paid.</p><p>However, seeing as they were willing to give up the Primary Instruction, why not lend Chong He a hand?</p><p>The three of them had a tacit understanding, which was why they could come to a decision so quickly!</p><p>The One-legged Ox Monster King roared with pain. Many streaks of Thunder Light struck down fiercely as he waved the thunder hammer. Silver, white, cyan and purple energy amalgamated, turning into a fantastic but also frightening power that smashed the surroundings into dust. The ground disappeared, leaving a hole of at least a few hundred feet. The dark flow of energy from underground had totally dried up, not leaving the Sword Qi any opportunity!</p><p>As for the fierce battle, the man with white hair hired by the Snow Mountain Sect tacitly stopped fighting with the White-tiger Monster King. One, under control, decided to help Meng Nan completely beat back Bliss Bodhisattva and Shui Yue Nunnery Abbess. The other decided to join the siege on Chong He.</p><p>Chong He seemed to be stuck between a rock and a hard place.</p><p>True Fire erupted as Cui Qinghe and Glaring Vajra fought. The purple sun hung in the sky and melted the Golden Body. Their sword art made all the attacking saber radiance die down and firmly suppressed the array transformation from the Dharmakaya Buddha’s relics and prospective Dharmakaya.</p><p>However, he still had to take the large formation into account, not to mention the divine weapons that the Glaring Vajra had at his disposal. So Cui Qinghe had to exert a little strength and invoke purple clouds in an attempt to resist the White-tiger Monster King.</p><p>White-tiger Monster King snorted and strands of Sword Qi by the thousands amalgamated and pierced the purple clouds.</p><p>At this moment, a humble Old Taoist with grey hair appeared, holding a glistening long saber in his hand!</p><p>As the long saber sliced through the air, all colors faded and all things, including Sword Qi, solidified, leaving only the colors black and white, and dead silence.</p><p>The Xuan Tian Sect leader remained silent. He was second place in The Terrestrial Rankings!</p><p>Time Blade, a Peerless Godly Weapon!</p><p>The White-tiger Monster King was aware that he was trapped in a dire situation. His thoughts and actions had slowed and his lifespan had passed. If it weren’t for the fact that Fang Bai was strong, he would have long been killed by the instant aging saber radiance.</p><p>A golden aura surrounded the Tiger’s body, and the Five Elements were all messed up. Then erupted the killing sense which blocked the saber radiance.</p><p>In such a short span of time, the Monster King was forced to only protect himself!</p><p>The power of Peerless Godly Weapons was really frightening; no wonder Shou Jing dared to against Han Guang!</p><p>A four-legged and three-armed monster flew to the Withering Bodhi Tree and found it difficult to catch it by Dharma and Logos of Heaven and Earth power. It could only depend on unalloyed body and Buddhism skill, so he extended one arm and grasped.</p><p>Suddenly, the void behind him formed a transparent figure. A pure white hand appeared and lotus flowers fell. Everything became still as if they were in their mothers’ arms, but there was actually nothing. Like the beginning of everything in which purity was apparent and ethereal sounds echoed,</p><p>“Ajati Matriarch, Vacuum Hometown!”</p><p>“The Dharma King Dushi” of Luo Denomination is coming!</p><p>He suddenly launched a sneak attack on the back of the monster’s head with his finger.</p><p>The four-legged and three-armed monster paused, then its muscles shrunk, and then somehow its black scales dried up. Then strands of blood-like light flowed into Dharma King Dushi’s body along his fingers.</p><p>Meanwhile, his other hand grasped the Withering Bodhi Tree.</p><p>After the Snow Mountain Sect saw the situation, he quickly instructed the weird man with white hair and shaded face to punch Dharma King Dushi !</p><p>Thud!</p><p>Black spots as big as a needle tip started floating around. Dharma King Dushi was engulfed by an infinite power that was pulling and tearing, forcing him to be on the defensive.</p><p>Seeing its chance, the black monster with the half monkey face screamed. Its head exploded as it fled from the Ajati Finger.</p><p>Flesh and blood pulsated in its neck. Then suddenly another head popped out – one that was still ferocious like the original, but its breath was weakened.</p><p>Although He Qi and Shou Jing had managed to hold down the two Monster Kings so that Chong He would not fall in the siege, they still thought Chong He’s situation was far from desirable. He fought with two enemies, powerful though his Conjuration of the Taoist Trinity tricks were, it was hard for him to end the battle. After all, Taoist Shou Jing was a Half-step to Dharmakaya. His Blade of Timeshadow was not made for long battles, and without help from his sect, he would not be able to suppress the White-tiger Monster King for long. Eventually, the three Dharmakayas would be able to flank him and attack both internal and external sides. Chong He would be in a dire situation.</p><p>However, Han Guang who was within the Immortal-slaying Sword Formation didn’t feel the same way.</p><p>As a hero of the age, there were only a few thoughts that he was concerned with:</p><p>“Chong He was prepared. He must have had doubts about me.”</p><p>“It’s too much of a coincidence that Kong Wen escaped just now. That means it must be connected to Chong He somehow!”</p><p>“Since Chong He didn’t do it, who could it be? The one from Lanke Temple or Lu Da?”</p><p>“Now that Kong Wen has been rescued, they must be on their way to come and kill the monsters…”</p><p>“If I don’t go now, I won’t have the chance to leave again!”</p><p>Moments later, Han Guang came to the decision that he had to get out of there at any cost. As for the Primary Instruction, he had a backup plan anyway!</p><p>At this time, “Tai Li showed the real and gorgeous Five Elements Peacock, Divine Five-colored Palm changed into energy and rotated, destroying the balance of the Five Elements and displaying the secrets of matter. If this were any other Formation, it would have been easily broken by its tail. However, the Immortal-slaying Sword Formation confounded Tai Li because the four Sword Qi – cyan, white, red and black – did not belong to the Five Elements. It looked like the Feng Shui symbol of Earth Fire. It was as though it was destroying and recreating another world at the same time!</p><p>What was more terrible was that they could annihilate anything, erupting unthinkable power that could collapse the heavens and even freeze time. The Divine Five-colored Palm hit but only broke up parts of them.</p><p>Comparatively speaking, Tai Li preferred Master Lu as his opponent.</p><p>For every strand of Sword Qi that fell, a beautiful feather also fell in the colorful lights. If this went on, it would be killed on the spot.</p><p>Han Guang ‘s right arm became dark and six fingers grew out, as if they illustrated the different meanings of destruction.</p><p>The divine weapon, “the Diabolic Monarch”, of the Destruction Sect – destroying heaven and earth, the immortals and the common people, destroying all things on earth!</p><p>It didn’t matter whether it was the vanishing of the Vital Qi sea, the destruction of the natural environment, or the endless momentum that burst out, it seemed that they were so delicate under the four streams of green, red, white, and black Sword Qi.</p><p>Even when facing two enemies by himself, Chong He still had the upper hand!</p><p>…</p><p>At the back mountain of the Shaolin Temple, a sign with the words “Righteousness and benevolence are off-limits” could be seen, as though spreading the meaningful Zen Philosophies.</p><p>“We are going to the West Regions to help Immortal Chonghe tackle the demonic cult and Han Guang. What about you ?” Master Lu asked as he looked at Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi thought for a few moments and said, “If the seniors are going to the West Regions, then just leave me outside of the Dharmakaya battleground.”</p><p>He wanted to keep his promise to Immortal Yunhe. He had vowed to let Yunhe go if he could get the steal. In case he couldn’t, though, then at least he was far enough not to be involved in the mess.</p><p>The two high-level Dharmakaya masters nodded in agreement and took Meng Qi toward the West Regions.</p><p>Emerging from the darkness of the void, Meng Qi’s eyes lit up when he realized that he had landed in the Gobi Desert of Immensity Sea.</p><p>“There are Elder Buddhist Monks close by, if you get into trouble, you can seek their help…” Kong Wen’s voice echoed in Meng Qi’s ears but he was already far away.</p><p><em>“Elder Buddhist Monks?”</em> Meng Qi frowned as Kong Wen reminded him. He decided to turn himself into a rat and then carefully ran toward the rocks.</p><p>As he got close, Meng Qi felt a sense of fright because there were indeed Elder Buddhist Monks, at least nine of them. In the formation made by the Monks, “Former Crown Prince” Zhao Qian, was seated in the middle!</p><p>The words”Buddhist Emperor” suddenly popped into Meng Qi’s head.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
