He wore a deep blue Taoist coat and had an average mouth and nose, but he liked to squint his eyes until they became a thin line. He also had an unspeakable aura of charm…” Gatekeeper said as he started recalling.</p><p>Meng Qi asked several more times to ensure that Gatekeeper didn’t miss anything. He looked at the “chain” that “broke” because of the opening of the door and said, “I won’t make your life difficult since you have a deal with Ice Fairy. You may leave now.”</p><p>This was instructed by Ye Yuqi.</p><p>When he saw that Gatekeeper looked surprised and delighted, Meng Qi added, “I’m not sure about whatever you did before and that doesn’t concern me since your enemies will naturally look for you. But since I’ve saved you today, I’ll personally eliminate you if you commit great evil in the future.”</p><p>“Thanks for your advice, senior.” Although Meng Qi’s breath became normal, the shock still lingered in the air and Gatekeeper still believed him to be a senior and a master.</p><p>The feeling of one’s breath pressuring and shattering the void could not be false!</p><p>With chains and a relieved mind, he sped towards the forked road and disappeared in the split of a second. He seemed extremely impatient.</p><p>“What were you surprised about?” Ye Yuqi walked out of the painted door, wearing a light purple dress.</p><p>Meng Qi did not conceal his secret. “I had found a set of artistic treasures in Dongyang Villa, left behind by Dongyang God. The words on it are ‘who am I, I am who’.”</p><p>Ruan Yaoguang and others had all witnessed the incident, thus Meng Qi couldn’t possibly hide the event.</p><p>“In the era of the holy emperor, Dongyang God wasn’t outstanding…” Ye Yuqi didn’t continue; in her point of view, even if some mysterious spell could allow big powers to survive until now, it wouldn’t be something that Dongyang God could handle.</p><p>“That’s why it’s strange.” Meng Qi mused and asked, “Fairy Ye, have you seen any Taoist like him?”</p><p>Ye Yuqi pondered for a while before shaking her head. “I have never seen him.”</p><p>There was no clue about this mystery at the moment. Meng Qi turned his head, and stepped back into the painted door, deciding to take all the Asoka Blossoms on the hill with him.</p><p>He had not dared to take too many Asoka Blossoms previously, as he was afraid that he might break any forgotten seals and cause destruction.</p><p>Ye Yuqi did not mention much about the Devil-rinsing Flag. Standing alongside Meng Qi, she said abruptly, “If there are no clues about the evil intentions of Zhenwu, we can all help you.”</p><p>Since it concerned the Five Ancient Emperors and Nine Primogenitors of Taoism, Ye Yuqi viewed the issue seriously. It might be true that nothing could be gained from eliminating the evil intentions, but the developments after that would be worth looking forward to.</p><p>“If I can’t successfully resolve any issue for this matter, I won’t hesitate to ask for help.” Meng Qi believed that this chain mission could be full of danger in the end and that he should release his goodwill ahead of time.</p><p>Meng Qi walked around in the stone room full of red mist once more but did not discover anything else. He recalled all that had happened before and suddenly frowned. “Fairy Ye, I still believe that this matter is strange. If Netherworld had escaped, why didn’t he take the Devil-rinsing Flag away? Even though this object is almost destroyed and is useless now, such an act can disrupt his enemy Zhenwu’s plan, and will be beneficial to him.”</p><p>Ye Yuqi was silent for a moment. “The tortoise shell inscription beside the Devil-rinsing Flag never talked about suppressing the Netherworld. The flag was inserted there, waiting for someone to take it away.”</p><p>After the Devil-rinsing Flag was taken away, the tortoise shell had deteriorated into powder.</p><p><em>This matter is truly mysterious, unless…</em> Meng Qi had a few guesses, but he had no proof, and could only suppress his ideas first. He walked towards the stone room, reminiscing about what had happened, thinking about his weaknesses and mistakes, so as to reflect on and correct them.</p><p>Honestly, if he had not joined in the elimination of Yang Zhenchan, he would not have met Slayer Yaksh and Merciless Tyrant, and would not have discovered their exploration. And if he didn’t join them, they would have taken much longer to find the living door. When Jiang Zhiwei had arrived, they would have found the node of the array easily, as the earthquake in Bomi had made it obvious, thus the living door would be easily discovered. Then, Old Zhong and Emperor of the Netherworld would not be provoked, and the Royal Advisor wouldn’t be awakened.</p><p>That was to say, if he did the mission in Carefree Valley normally, his biggest danger would be encountering a sneak-attack by the old monster when looking for the node of the array, being attacked by ancient spirits after entering the living door, and being infiltrated by the cold moist energy of the Royal Advisor, becoming a part of him.</p><p>If they were well prepared and were careful, then the mission shouldn’t be difficult.</p><p>…</p><p>After taking away the Asoka Blossoms, Meng Qi and Ye Yuqi returned from the entrance of The Immortals near Quicksand Town.</p><p>The two changed their clothes discretely, each wearing a mask. Progenitor Doumu then opened the entrance directly, as she no longer needed to inform those inside using an Immortal-traveling Charm.</p><p>“When you change your accessory later, you’ll officially become a member. You can use your accessory to enter any of the nine entrances.” Ye Yuqi, who had transformed into Progenitor Doumu, said lightly.</p><p><em>Official member…</em> Meng Qi first thought of the benefits!</p><p>“Progenitor, can I obtain the Exterior chapter for the Heavenly Golden Scripture and one or two Dharmakaya ultimate moves now?” His eyes shone and were full of energy.</p><p>The exterior chapter of “Heavenly Golden Scripture” included all the moves of the Exterior, such as Sky-turning Three Palms, Four Secrets of Wuji, Yin and Yang change, The Beginning Finger, and finally, the most important Dharmakaya movements.</p><p>Ye Yuqi nodded her head and said, “Naturally so, you can obtain the exterior chapter and all the movements later. Due to your potential and possible contributions to the organization, you don’t need to wait for the completion of the first official member mission to obtain the Dharmakaya ultimate ticks and can choose one or two now.”</p><p>Meng Qi fell in front of Azure Palace, full of joy. He then continued after some hesitation, “Progenitor, can I choose just one Dharmakaya ultimate trick from ‘Heavenly Golden Scripture’?”</p><p>“You’re giving up voluntarily?” Progenitor Doumu was slightly confused.</p><p>No matter how one looked at “Killing Blade” Su Meng, he did not seem like such a person.</p><p>Meng Qi shook his head immediately, “No no, I just want to exchange for the Dharmakaya ultimate skill of ‘Eight Nine Mysteries’.”</p><p>That was his main cultivation method!</p><p>Progenitor Doumu shook her head slightly, “I’m afraid that’s not possible. Except for those Dharmakaya movements under your name, others require you to exchange using Dharmakaya level objects, or as rewards for your service, or when you accomplish special tasks.”</p><p>“Special tasks?” Meng Qi asked in confusion.</p><p>Progenitor Doumu looked at him and asked, “Have you exchanged any Dharmakaya movements, cultivation methods, or divine weapons with Dominator of Samsara before?”</p><p>Meng Qi vaguely felt that Dominator of Samara was going to be a profiteer again, and replied frankly, “No…”</p><p>He had only completed his realization prowess…</p><p>Progenitor Doumu’s tone was as calm as usual. “After becoming Dharmakaya, if you want to exchange anything with Dominator of Samsara, you’ll need Karma points on top of completing a special task. The higher the value of the object, the more difficult the task. There was one divine weapon which had the most difficult special task, and we call it Solitary Death Task within The Immortals. Nobody has completed it except for Primogenitor Lingbao, and they all withdrew halfway, losing 20% of their Karma points.”</p><p>“Special tasks for Dharmakaya movements are not so difficult. The more incomplete the movements are, or the higher the side effects, the easier the task.”</p><p>“The Immortals are somewhat bounded by Dominator of Samsara, and the Dharmakaya cultivation methods and movements were as such too. Although the tasks were not that difficult, you still have no hope completing them at present, and should only consider it after crossing the first level of the Celestial Ladder, or after making a great contribution and requesting it as your reward. You can also exchange for it using Dharmakaya level objects.”</p><p><em>Dharmakaya level objects…</em> Except for the Buddha’s Palm, Meng Qi only owned the Five Thunder Bombardment of Sky. Dominator of Samsara himself had given it to him and it couldn’t be exchanged.</p><p>Actually, even if it was exchangeable, Meng Qi couldn’t exchange it. This is because the move can only be inherited through impartation by Gist of Trueness. Meng Qi had only understood its preliminary effects, and couldn’t leave behind a complete Gist of Trueness before he fully mastered it.</p><p><em>Maybe the mysterious and unsolvable last move of Ananda Oath-breaking Bladesmanship, “Karma Fruit”can be upgraded to the Dharmakaya level after completion…</em> Meng Qi had found a lot of trouble for himself because of this karma, but he was still some distance away from finishing this unsolvable move.</p><p>Meng Qi always had a good state of mind. He calmed his emotions and said nothing more. Following Progenitor Doumu into the Azure Palace, he returned his original accessory to her.</p><p>After waiting for a while, Progenitor Doumu came out of the back hall. The accessory had changed its appearance. It was now thumb-sized, jade green, and filled with ancient scripts. It looked like a water droplet, and within the water droplet, there was an inlaid gem. The gem was slightly bigger than a rice grain, appearing dark and chaotic.</p><p>“This is your symbol, ‘Eye of Beginning’, which can be used to open any entrance of the Immortals. It also hides a trace of chaotic Qi within, which can aid your comprehension,” Progenitor Duomu said with a moderate voice.</p><p>Meng Qi placed it in his Space Ring immediately, silently praising the Immortals. They had probably spent several days making this accessory. It seemed like the Immortals were fully confident that he would become an official member.</p><p>Looking at the symbol of Progenitor Doumu, the ring “Mother of Stars”, Meng Qi followed her toward where he had received his cultivation method before.</p><p>“By the way, when you are wearing the Heavenly Primogenitor mask, you need not treat me as your senior…” Progenitor Doumu abruptly said, sounding awkward. “That would make it easier for the reserve members and affiliated teams to figure out your identity.”</p><p>Meng Qi was happy to agree as he found it awkward to treat Progenitor Doumu, who looked only 27 or 28, as a senior too.</p><p>Yellow light covered the sky, and Sword Qi was restrained. After Meng Qi and Progenitor Doumu stepped into the hall, they walked straight to the cabinet where the jade bamboo script of “Heavenly Golden Scripture” laid.</p><p>“The Immortals only have three of the ‘Nine Primeval Seals’, namely the Skythrowing Palm, Wu-Ji Seal and Yin-Yang Seal, as well as Noble Grace Fist and Tri-gem Wish Fist of the Fist Art of Five Beginnings and Five Morals. Which two moves would you like to choose?” Progenitor Doumu asked as she stood in front of the cabinet.</p><p>The “Tri-gem Wish Fist” which Meng Qi previously learned was a movement of the Exterior realm and was derived from the “Tri-gem Wish Fist” of the Dharmakaya realm. Since the cultivation methods were similar, an upgrade of this move was possible, thus it was also named “Tri-gem Wish Fist”.</p><p>Meng Qi didn’t hesitate about the first choice, and said directly, “Progenitor, I choose ‘Yin-Yang Seal’!”</p><p>His sword strikes involved Yin and Yang, The Big Bang Technique involved Yin and Yang, and his self-made “Trio Combination of Yin and Yang, which is Yin and which is Yang? ” involved Yin and Yang as well. In the case where he had neither of the three seals, First Dao, Open Sky and Infiniteness, choosing “Yin-Yang Seal” would be the best for self-improvement, even though “Skythrowing Palm” was more powerful.</p><p>Combining himself with the meaning of the origin opened up the new route to Eight Nine Mysteries. After obtaining the Exterior chapter for “Heavenly Golden Scripture” and Yin-Yang Seal, this was the beginning of his cultivation in the Exterior realm, and he was no longer just stabilizing realms and practicing moves!</p><p>“Let’s choose Tri-gem Wish Fist next. It is the top five strongest move of Fist Art of Five Beginnings and Five Morals. Since you’ve practiced it before, it allows for continuity as well,” Progenitor Doumu suggested.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded, now considering to exchange Qi of the five morals from other sources.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
