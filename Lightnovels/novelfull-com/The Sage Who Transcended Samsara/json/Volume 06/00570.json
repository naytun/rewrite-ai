It allows all the changes within your body to collapse and merge with the Chaotic Hole within a short period of time, thereby converging all your strength and the Force of Heaven and Earth into one point. When your practice of this style has reached a high realm, this point can ‘suppress’ the void and create a true Chaotic Hole. With a lift of your hand, you’ll be able to exterminate entire stars.”</p><p><em>“Isn’t he talking about black holes…?”</em> Sweat began to bead up on Meng Qi’s forehead. If he combined this style with the use of terrifyingly heavy weapons, he would be able to create a force so destructive that just the thought of it would frighten people. It was no wonder that Great Sage wanted the Golden-banded Staff. It was also no wonder that one of the styles of Virtual Purity Sabersmanship, as well as Heaven-equalling and Ocean-stirring Staff Art, emphasized the concentration of power!</p><p>He imagined scenes of Lord of Purity and Magic and Great Sage Equal to Heaven using this skill; lost in reverie. It was only when he began to return to his senses that the Primogenitor continued. “The third style is a Dharmakaya supreme art that brings you closer to Heavenly Knowing. It is dubbed ‘the Bodhi’s Stare’. If you practice it to the consummate stage, you’ll be able to see through all illusions, understand the changes in Dharma, and resist Vital Spirit techniques. Moreover, it’ll give you the ability to open a Vertical Eye, radiate rays of light as thin as a strand of hair, and set your opponent’s Vital Spirit. However, this supreme art is incredibly difficult to practice. Based on the records that I’ve obtained, it’s a challenge to even get started unless you have a strong Buddha-nature.”</p><p>“Of course, the teachings of Buddhism tell us that each and every one of us has the heart of Bodhi and is capable of learning ‘the Bodhi’s stare’. It’s just that the trifles of worldly affairs prevent us from opening our ‘eyes’. One can also use elixirs or other external help to assist in opening the ‘eye’ after encountering many challenges, however, one would’ve taken a shortcut by doing so. The outcome will lack the efficacy of the supreme art. In the end, this method will leave the body with concealed dangers.”</p><p>Meng Qi was frowning under his mask after hearing Primogenitor Lingbao’s explanation. <em>“Which style should I choose?”</em></p><p>He was majoring in the Eight Nine Mysteries. The closer he came into contact with contents related to the Dharmakaya, the more effective his practice in the Exterior skills and styles would be. He was, after all, merging his main study of Eight Nine Mysteries with Heavenly Golden Scripture and going off the beaten path, away from his predecessors. He would need to study them properly so as not to make a mistake.</p><p>Considering his initial purpose, it was the most appropriate choice to directly evolve “Living Propagation” – the ability of Eight Nine Mysteries to turn one’s physical body into a saintly one.</p><p>Moreover, he was also equipped with Dharmakaya-level movements like Tri-gem Wish Fist and Five Thunder Bombardment of Sky. Furthermore, he still had the technique that was most compatible with his Dharma Form of the Interior and was presently used for Dhamarkaya techniques, “The Big Bang Technique”. He had no shortage of offensive tricks; he had no immediate use for “the Chaos Vortex”. He had not even learned the basics of “Yin-Yang Seal” and “I, the Unique and Righteous”, so he had no idea about their specific uses. He only knew that they could be used for offense.</p><p>“The Bodhi’s Stare” would be a very powerful aid, especially in future tasks in the Apotheosized World and the World of Journey to the West. Those worlds had numerous masters capable of transformations or secret techniques that target one’s Vital Spirit. Unfortunately, practicing this style would be too arduous a process and he was not sure if he could do it. Right now, he did not want to waste any opportunities.</p><p>He pondered over his choices for a moment before finally deciding to take a pragmatic approach. “Primogenitor, I choose the ‘Living Propagation’,” he said.</p><p>The advantage of being able to improve the ability of his physical body to recover had become more and more apparent to him.</p><p>Without comment, Primogenitor Lingbao retrieved the sealed jade bamboo script and handed it to Meng Qi so he could comprehend the Gist of Trueness impartation.</p><p>His spiritual mind stretch forward and entered the bamboo script. He felt his Vital Spirit and Kung Fu will merging before permeating his entire body. Thus, his eyes were “staring” at his shoulder, his shoulder “staring” at his mouth, and his mouth “staring” his chest. Each Aperture acupoint and every inch of his flesh was stimulated – they all harbored Meng Qi’s spirituality!</p><p>Meng Qi felt intoxicated by the strange yet wondrous change in his body. He allowed a long time to pass before he finally interrupted his contemplation. His eyes were burning with vigor when he opened them, looking rather thoughtful.</p><p>He did not know that his body held so many secrets. If he practiced it to its limits, developing every Aperture acupoint and every inch of his flesh into a universe and a world of its own would not remain a mere dream.</p><p>“You’ve gained quite the reputation after comprehending the Primary Instruction of Buddha’s Palm. You’re likely to draw someone’s wrath. It would be wise for you to keep a low profile and concentrate on your cultivation for the time being.” Primogenitor Lingbao advised him.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded. “That was my intention.”</p><p>His plan was to cultivate in a quiet place for two months before heading to River East to meet his subsidiary team. He then intended to sell the Immortality Elixir of East Pole and prepare himself to reach the Third Heaven of the Exterior before the start of the missions of the Apotheosized World.</p><p>Primogenitor Lingbao paused for a moment before continuing speaking. “Whatever the case, the Immortals have a subsidiary world. Even though the timeline is consistent with the main world, the vigorous Vital Qi of heaven and earth will ease your cultivation and shield you from external interference.”</p><p>“We happen to have a suitable task at the moment. You may enter the subsidiary world if you choose to accept it. You can just complete the task while you’re cultivating.”</p><p><em>“Is this the first task after becoming an official member that Primogenitor had previously mentioned?”</em> This did not surprise Meng Qi but he was nevertheless full of doubts. “Primogenitor, do you mean that I must accept the task first if I wanted to enter the subsidiary world?”</p><p><em>“Isn’t it a subsidiary world of the Immortals?”</em></p><p>Primogenitor Lingbao nodded. “That’s a restriction that the Six Realms have imposed. You must accept relevant tasks before you’re allowed through the entrance. However, there’s a certain connection between Azure Palace and the subsidiary world that allows the exchange of news and assignment of tasks. This, you don’t have to worry about.”</p><p><em>“The capitalist restrictions of the Six Realms sure are everywhere…”</em> Meng Qi mocked in his mind, but the Primogenitor’s answer had expelled his doubts. “Primogenitor, would the subsidiary world be dangerous considering the ease of cultivation there?” he asked casually.</p><p>Primogenitor Lingbao was momentarily silent. “It’s not dangerous at the moment. Your current strength is more than enough for you to protect yourself.”</p><p>“The contradictory condition puzzled me as well in the beginning, but I was never able to find an answer, so I accepted the subsidiary world as it was. If not for the fact that the subsidiary world could not be changed due to its connection to the Azure Palace, I would’ve long changed it.”</p><p><em>“I see…”</em> Meng Qi gave a gentle nod and put it in the back of his mind. If it was a mystery that not even the Primogenitor could solve, then there was no use for him to worry about it. Either way, he would only stay there to cultivate and complete the task while he was at it.</p><p>Naturally, though he said he would not worry about it, speculations were already running wild in his mind. Considering that the subsidiary world had long been connected to the Azure Palace, could it be related to the Apotheosized World?</p><p>“Primogenitor, what is my task?” Meng Qi asked, suppressing his thoughts.</p><p>“There’s a vast body of water named the ‘Blight of the Immortals’ in the subsidiary world. It is filled with fog and lightning all year long. It resembles a place to execute divine punishment, so much so that there’s even a crevice that leads to an uncertain location. Not even experts of the Exterior dare to fly into that crevice,” said Primogenitor Lingbao.</p><p>“With my help, the dynasty in that world eventually established a safe waterway that weaves through the Blight of the Immortals. Their excavation team found a large new land that is filled with rich resources and many monsters. The land has drawn the desire of the royal family, aristocratic families, and sects. Over the years, citizens dispossessed of their lands and criminal fugitives have been sent there. The dynasty then established five emigrant provinces and appointed five provincial governors.”</p><p>“The Emperor, who lives outside the land, suffered from a weak reign. The waterway can only be used for three months out of the year, gradually giving birth in the five provincial governors the desire for self-reliance. The governors conspired with many suppressed evil sects and indigenous people. They also gained the support of quite a few aristocratic families and righteous sects in secret. The royal family eventually noticed that something was wrong and sent two powerful imperial envoys, one after the other, with the intention of replacing the governors in the name of righteousness. However, both envoys died within the Blight of the Immortals without even setting foot on the emigrant provinces. The five provincial governors washed their hands clean of any blame.”</p><p>“The helpless imperial family has turned to the Immortals of the Azure Palace to escort the third imperial envoy to safety.”</p><p>“The rewards for this task will belong to you alone.”</p><p>Based on the Primogenitor’s description of the strengths of the characters involved, the task did not seem particularly difficult. Meng Qi listened quietly and indicated that he had no objections. He had but one question. <em>“I’ll definitely be making my appearance there as Heavenly Primogenitor… but it sounds so weird to hear myself called Heavenly Primogenitor of Azure Palace…”</em></p><p>Seeing as they were done, Primogenitor Lingbao indicated that Meng Qi may leave and head to the Immortal-tracking Alley himself to accept the task.</p><p>Meng Qi was about to take a step when he recalled something. “Primogenitor, is the one from Lanke Temple one of the Bodhisattvas of the Bhaisajyaguru Buddhas?”</p><p>“Correct. Her master had once listened to Candraprabha Bodhisattva expound the Teachings of Buddhism in the yesteryears.” Primogenitor Lingbao, being one of the oldest Dharmakayas, knew a considerable amount of secret details of history.</p><p>Candraprabha Bodhisattva, a Maha Bodhisatva, was one of the close attendants of Bhaisajyaguru Buddha.</p><p>Meng Qi was stunned. “Candraprabha Bodhisattva? Just how long has the one from Lanke Temple been alive?”</p><p>The last time that Candraprabha Bodhisattva had entered the historical records was before the chaos of Demonic Buddha.</p><p>Primogenitor Lingbao smiled. “Don’t you know cultivating Sambhogakaya is an alternative method to extend your lifespan? Their lifespans are typically far longer than their peers. If they’re able to cultivate their Sambhogakaya to a consummate level, they’ll transform into a part of heaven and earth, or one of the Great Buddha Paths. They’ll be immortals, never to be extinguished by the world.”</p><p>“Candraprabha Bodhisattva was extinguished before the chaos of Demonic Buddha, but the master of the one from Lanke Temple was only extinguished after living for more than one thousand years. The Sambhogakaya Pure Land of Lanke Temple inherited a small portion of his pure land. The ancient books and records of the temple were naturally also passed down from generation to generation.”</p><p>“Doesn’t this mean that the one from Lanke Temple has also lived for more than a thousand years?” Meng Qi asked, surprised. “If the cultivators of Sambhogakaya can live that long, wouldn’t this method be much better than the way of Kung Fu?”</p><p>Candraprabha Bodhisattva was able to live long enough to reach the chaos of Demonic Buddha. What would that mean for the lifespan of Bhaisajyaguru Buddha?</p><p>Primogenitor Lingbao shook his head. “The cultivation of Sambhogakaya is incredibly restrictive. Your body, mind, and conduct must strictly follow the source of all reciprocation – the rule of heaven and earth – or its Dharma and Logos. You must never violate the Grand Wishes in any way or you’ll fall in an instant and your Sambhogakaya cultivation will be tarnished. It’s not a method that we free and unfettered people would choose.”</p><p><em>“No wonder he restrained himself from snatching the Primary Instruction of Buddha’s Palm… No wonder the Dharmakayas showed no doubt in his promise…”</em> Realization dawned on Meng Qi.</p><p>After he had clarified the matter that had been lingering in his mind, Meng Qi left the Azure Palace and flew to the Immortal-tracking Alley. He arrived at the jade pillar in the center of the alley and had the Blood of the One-legged Ox and peacock feathers appraised.</p><p>Once it was confirmed that they indeed belonged to Monster King, he followed his plan to use the 11 drops of Blood of the One-legged Ox to enhance his saber, Heaven Inflicted Pain. He used the peacock feathers to enhance the Qingyuan Taoist Robes.</p><p>With the expense of 300 Karma points, his saber became heavier than ever. In fact, it weighed several times more than it did in the past, just right for Meng Qi’s hold. The lightning remained dyed in purple but even more powerful than before. Even though his saber had yet to reach the status of a Top Grade material, it was not far behind!</p><p>“Heaven Inflicted Pain, a Precious Weapon of the Mid Grade level, with a blade made out of Sky Thunder Gold and a handle carved out of Thunder Wood. The weapon is infused with the powers of Beryl Stone of Thunder of the Ancient Thunderous Pool, a Seal of Thunder, and 11 drops of One-legged Ox Monster King… It is exceptionally heavy, weighing more than 500kg… It has definite control over various kinds of lighting. The weapon is worth 5,900 Karma points.”</p><p><em>“It has definite control over various kinds of lighting?”</em> Meng Qi looked at the saber that was swirling with purple lightning, pleasantly surprised. He was getting used to its weight in his hand.</p><p>Due to the innate inferiority of the Qingyuan Taoist Robes, Meng Qi had to spend a whopping 2,000 Karma points to upgrade it to a Precious Weapon of the Mid Grade level. Aside from added abilities to fit the wearer’s size and change as the wearer pleased, the defensive ability of the robes had also improved a great deal. Specifically, the robes could now greatly weaken the force of the Five Elements.</p><p>The robes were now worth 5,800 Karma points. Had the Peacock Demon King’s feathers not been partially damaged, he was confident it could have been upgraded into a Precious Weapon of the Top Grade level. The same was true for his saber!</p><p>His sword, Flowing Fire, now looked even more like a red jade after killing Howling Lunar Hound. Its scorching heat was hidden in the depths of the blade. It was now worth nearly 7,000 Karma points.</p><p>When he was done with the appraisal and upgrade of his weapons, Meng Qi turned his robes black and wore the mask of Heavenly Primogenitor. He then found the tenth entrance of the Azure Heaven and stepped into the layer of light.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
