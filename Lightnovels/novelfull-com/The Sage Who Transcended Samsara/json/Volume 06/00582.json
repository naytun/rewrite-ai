The mysterious masked stranger was similarly clad in grey, blending with the congregation of guests. Not even his height and girth could be seen through the wide robes that he wore. None knew who he was, save for Meng Qi and Yan Wuwo. He was one of the Tai Shang Elders of the Ji Clan of the Central Province, Ji Feihong. The Elder was also in the Terrestrial Rankings, wielding powerful strength of his own. When he arrived on the boat, the hosts did not fail to notice that his body had shown signs of faltering health.</p><p>Martial practitioners of the Exterior enjoyed robust health well into old age. Their powers would never dwindle and their bodies would never display signs of decline despite their age unless Death had reached their door. Since his well-being had shown signs of diminishing, it meant that Death was already waiting to claim Ji Feihong’s life.</p><p><em>“That would explain why he is so willing to part with an Exquisite Precious Weapon!”</em> Yan Wuwo sighed to himself.</p><p>Precious Weapons of the exquisite class were the most superb of all Precious Weapons. Those who wielded them would be like warriors with powers of the Half-step to the Dharmakaya amongst common warriors with powers of the Exterior. The Precious Weapons of such rarity and aptitude would bend their will to no common practitioners or warriors of the Exterior. Amongst the most dominant of Precious Weapons of such exquisiteness, some might even bear the power and attributes of Divine Weapons, and in very rare cases, awareness of their own. Yan Wuwo was inclined to believe that the Moon-falling Stick was not a Precious Weapon forged by Ji Feihong’s own hands, but a bounty that he had chanced upon in one of his adventures abroad.</p><p>Even Yan Wuwo would hardly be able to suppress the desire for such an item of immense rarity and value if he did not have the Dominator of the Six Samsara to look to for his needs. The Dominator only required Karma points and his cupboard would never be bare.</p><p>Looks of derision were thrown toward Ji Feihong after his desperate bid. They remained still. What did one have to fear but the inability to procure any elixir or draught to extend life when Death beckoned?</p><p>Meng Qi’s heart pounded but he kept calm. He was certain that better offers would come. Nothing would be more valuable to these decrepit elders than their lives which have at most three decades, or at least a few months left!</p><p>As expected, the sickly and hollow voice of the Oracle of the Covenant boomed once again. “The same 14 exotic minerals and produce I have offered before and the Precious Weapon of high grade, the Shadow Sword. But I shall also offer a magical artifact of the Ninth Heaven, the Mirror of Turbulence.”</p><p><em>“An artifact of the Ninth Heaven! The old man has such wealth!”</em></p><p>Meng Qi felt that he would not be able to suppress the emotions swelling in him had he not seen the greatness of a Divine Weapon with his own eyes. He reckoned the bid for the Immortality Elixir had reached its peak. The items offered by the old Oracle would reach 30,000 Karma points by modest estimation, assuming that the value of the items was not assessed by the unscrupulous Dominator!</p><p>Meng Qi’s mind spun with awe and amazement. He had enjoyed numerous bounties and fortuitous returns in his past adventures but nothing he had ever done had yielded him such a great amount! Thirty thousand Karma points! A few more endeavors like this and he would have enough points to restore the Devil-rinsing Flag! He would gain possession of a Divine Weapon without having to complete the arduous tasks to earn one!</p><p>The euphoria passed as swiftly as it came. He knew well that fortunes like this came only once in a lifetime. The present situation and the extreme scarcity of the Immortality Elixirs of East Pole had convinced the guests that there were only two such elixirs in existence so they eagerly bid for it with reckless abandon! The emergence of more elixirs in the future would cause suspicion that a steady source for the Elixir had been found, causing the prices to plummet.</p><p>Then again, the dwindling life of the seniors and the rareness of the elixirs and concoctions, coupled with the fact that only the first consumption of such elixirs would yield maximum potency, ensured high demand for Immortality Elixirs in the future. But the returns of future trade would hardly be as rewarding as before. A single elixir might only yield a profit of a few thousands of Karma points. An increase in volume will drive prices lower and would carry the risk of exposure.</p><p>The Oracle’s counterbid threw the entire cabin into another tense silence. His offer had gone over their limit. Even if some of the guests could make much better offers, should they go that far?</p><p>Many other items had yet to be presented, including the Fortune’s Endurance Elixirs, the Meridian Treasured Powder and other concoctions of similar nature and effect. One or two such items would also ensure promising outcomes despite their marginal effect compared to the Immortality Elixir of East Pole!</p><p>It was understandable that one would hesitate and reconsider when faced with more than one option, hoping not to pay too great a price.</p><p>Meng Qi had foreseen this. The fact that only two Immortality Elixirs of East Pole were available for bidding had raised the possibility that violence would ensue in everyone’s hope to gain possession. The lone strength of Yan Wuwo would hardly be enough to counter the collective strength of the guests. Thus Meng Qi would have to ensure that sufficient wares would be available so that every guest would not leave with empty hands. Otherwise, he would have to enlist the help of another guard – one who wielded the powers of the Dharmakaya.</p><p>Considering Primogenitor Lingbao’s busyness and the rewards that Meng Qi would have to give him for his help, the mere profit from the sale of the Immortality Elixirs was hardly worth him being indebted to the Primogenitor.</p><p>Heaven knows how many in the world would hope to obtain a favor of one at the level of the Dharmakaya!</p><p>Immortal Chonghe, the “Primogenitor Lingbao”, could hardly be summoned on affairs outside the interest of The Immortals, lest Meng Qi squander the favor that he had earned by revealing the Heaven Sovereign’s schemes to Immortal Chonghe. Meng Qi’s opportune warning had helped the leader of The Immortals to escape from the woe that would have cost him his life, allowing him instead to exploit the opening and turn the tables on his foe… Meng Qi recovered from his momentary reflection and apathetically said, “Are there any bids higher than this? The sale shall go to this guest if we do not receive any more bids on the third count.”</p><p>There was nothing but the loud and heavy breaths of the Oracle in the awkward silence that followed, adding tension to the already stressful mood.</p><p>“One…”</p><p>Silence and still more silence.</p><p>“Two…”</p><p>Every breath seemed like an eternity. The sight of Meng Qi raising the apothecary jade vase that held the Immortality Elixir took the old Oracle’s breath away. He anxiously awaited the third count. He would directly consume the elixir like the elder of the Zhang Clan, but, unlike him, the Oracle would try not to reveal his identity!</p><p>“Wait.” A voice shattered the silence.</p><p>The Oracle of the Covenant could barely contain his rage and malice as he turned to look at the one who had spoken.</p><p>Like everyone around him, the stranger was in grey robes and a wooden mask. He intentionally shielded his breath from detection and tried to conceal his physique. Without even a glance at the Oracle, the stranger presented his bid. “The Flaming Herb… 13 exotic minerals and produce, in addition to a Precious Weapon of high grade, the Soul-killing Venomous Needle.”</p><p>He paused briefly.</p><p>His current offer was not on par with the bid that the Oracle had offered earlier. Thus, everyone expected that the next item that he would add to the offer would surely hold tremendous value.</p><p>“An artifact formed by the very auras of Nature. An artifact of the exquisite class, the Oceanic Dominion Pearl!” The stranger fell into silence as if he had regretted his brashness.</p><p><em>“The Oceanic Dominion Pearl?”</em> Meng Qi simply could not believe his ears! <em>“The Oceanic Dominion Pearl of the Apotheosized World? The Pearl which was once in the possession of Zhao Gongming, the Lord Xuantan?”</em></p><p><em>“Surely this is one of the Peerless Godly Weapons?”</em></p><p>Yan Wuwo, the “Immortal Taiyi” of The Immortals, was also familiar with the Apotheosized World. He was visibly shaken as his aura fluctuated mildly.</p><p>The bidder feared that some guests might not understand the value of the item that he had offered so he explained in a raspy voice. “This is an artifact that has survived the depths of the East Sea for tens of thousands of years. The Pearl holds within the aura of Chaos. Due to its massive weight, it can calm even the most ferocious waves of the sea, thus its name: the Oceanic Dominion Pearl. It can be used as one of the main ingredients for the forging of Divine Weapons, or it could be used as a secret artifact. By throwing it at the enemy, blinding rays of light of five different shades would emerge to confound the enemy. Its weight would also be enough to kill.”</p><p>“However, due to its immature state, the Pearl would only be able to function a few times as a secret artifact before its powers and effects are spent.”</p><p>He was unable to say the number of times that the Pearl could still be used because he had never used it before.</p><p>It was not only a main ingredient of Divine Weapons, it was also a magical artifact equivalent to an Exquisite Precious weapon; everyone could see how valuable it was. The Oracle of the Covenant’s offer would not be able to compete with it! Many of the guests who had been uncertain if they should also bid finally put the notion to rest. The price that was offered was impossible to counter, so the others laid their minds on the other wares that were yet to be presented.</p><p>Meng Qi was immensely pleased with the bid. Raw strength was one of the greatest advantages of the Eight Nine Mysteries discipline that he had mastered. The disciplines of Virtual Purity Sabersmanship, Heaven-equalling and Ocean-stirring Staff Art or even Vairocana Swordplay all had strokes and stances that embodied the facets of sheer power, chiefly the disciplines of the Heaven-equalling and Ocean-stirring Staff. And by a stroke of fortuitous luck, the Pearl of Oceanic Dominion was something that would help Meng Qi meditation on the very aspect of this element. He would also be able to use the Pearl for the enhancement or forging of his own Precious Weapons one day. For now, the Pearl could be used for an artifact that he could still use at least twice or thrice!</p><p>“Are there any more bids?” Meng Qi called out once more as he tried to suppress his emotions.</p><p>“Three…”</p><p>The Oracle drew a shaky breath. He turned and shot a scathing look toward the stranger who had outbid him.</p><p>“Two…”</p><p>The Oracle took a light breath, the apparent frailty of his health surfacing once again.</p><p>The Patriarch of the Zhang Clan, Zhang Duan, witnessed the entire scene as the elixir was taking effect. A warm sensation rose within him, invigorating his flesh and blood as well as his Vital Spirit. He could not help but feel poignant. He would not have been able to acquire the Immortality Elixir if not for the grace that was shown to him. Without the Immortality Elixir, he would have had to rely on lesser elixirs and concoctions.</p><p><em>“But from whence had such grace sprung from?”</em></p><p>“One! Deal!” Meng Qi roared loudly. He was glad that no incident had arisen.</p><p>The stranger stepped forward, stopping before the platform. He produced the thirteen exotic minerals and produce that gleamed radiantly. Then, he presented a small needle that glistened with a sparkling blue shade.</p><p>Finally, he took out a little black box from his Space Ring. As soon as the box appeared in his hand, the air around them screeched and crackled as if the air hovered in fear of what was held within.</p><p>Even with the strength of a grandmaster, the stranger’s feet sank a full inch into the timber of the deck. With great difficulty, he presented the box to the host.</p><p>Meng Qi glanced at Yan Wuwo, who in turn channeled some of his strength to Meng Qi. With both of his hands, Meng Qi received the box from the stranger. To his surprise, it was so heavy, he felt as if it would flatten him. The sudden weight in his hands made them tremble, almost causing him to drop it.</p><p><em>The box easily weights around five to six thousand jin… Even the aura of Chaos that seeped from the Pearl has stymied my ability to summon and wield the Force of Heaven and Earth…</em> Meng Qi reflected as he opened the box.</p><p>The lid of the box swung open, revealing a pearl the size of a thumb. The pearl vaguely radiated a supple blush of many colors with a soft, ethereal glimmer to it. Various visions seemed to play out in its faint glimmer as if a realm of its own.</p><p>With no time to withdraw them into his sleeves, the stranger’s hands were caught in the illumination of the pearl, undoing the secret technique he had used to conceal their appearance. Fleetingly, Meng Qi saw that the stranger’s hands had a missing finger! At the stub of the severed finger was a shade of shimmering blue.</p><p>The stranger swiftly pulled his hands back into his sleeves. Meng Qi paid no heed to his discovery, but a curious head in the crowd tilted to catch a glimpse of the Pearl.</p><p>It is indeed an artifact that closely resembles the true Oceanic Dominion Pearl, but it is not yet fully formed… Meng Qi thought quietly after he had studied the prize. He stowed away the Pearl and presented the Immortality Elixir of East Pole to the stranger with nine fingers.</p><p>Like the Patriarch of the Zhang Clan before him, the man with nine fingers immediately consumed the elixir, but he tried his best not to reveal his appearance by keeping his mask on.</p><p>The auction then continued with the sale of other lesser elixirs for longevity such as the Fortune’s Endurance Elixir. With enough wares, every single guest was able to buy something. This prevented dissatisfaction and resentment that could have escalated into mayhem.</p><p>At the conclusion of the auction, the guests quickly took their leave. No one wanted to risk being exposed and they had no appetite for small talk.</p><p>Within moments, there was no one left but Meng Qi and Yan Wuwo.</p><p>“Let us retreat first. I will take my share of the rewards later.” Yan Wuwo spoke to Meng Qi telepathically.</p><p>Even as a fellow member of The Immortals, Meng Qi tried to be responsible and fair when compensating his associates and allies.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded and turned to leave. Yan Wuwo suddenly stopped him. “The Third Master of the Ruan Clan spoke to me via telepathy earlier. He asked me who the stranger was who had bought the second Immortality Elixir.”</p><p>“The Third Master of the Ruan Clan?” Meng Qi was puzzled by the Ruan Clan’s interest in the Immortality Elixir. <em>“The Ruan Clan should not be short on supply of the Immortality Elixir!”</em></p><p>“Yes, and there was something peculiar in the manner in which he asked about it,” said Yan Wuwo.</p><p>Meng Meng Qi’s brows rose curiously. “Do you know the man with nine fingers who bought the second Immortality Elixir, Senior?”</p><p>The identities of the guests were known only to Meng Qi and Yan Wuwo. They had traded with the Dominator of the Six Samsara for masks and large robes that can only be used once so the guests could disguise themselves. About 4,000 Karma points were spent for the raiments, which he would deduct from the sales of the items from the Plenitude Sect. In retrospect, Yan Wuwo had not informed Meng Qi of the identity of the man with nine fingers, and the man himself had been disguised when he arrived!</p><p>“The invitation that he held was the one that we delivered to the Three-fairy Isle of the East Seas, but he is not a warrior of the Exterior of the Three-fairy Isle. I believed they had an arrangement of their own, so I did not question his appearance earlier.” Yan Wuwo calmly explained.</p><p><em>“That means Yan Wuwo himself is unaware of the identity of the man!”</em></p><p>Understanding that perils would mount the longer they stay, Meng Qi and Yan Wuwo exchanged a few more words before leaving in different directions.</p><p>They had nearly vanished into the horizon when the sea below the boat that they had just left churned and bubbled. A black figure rose from its depths, frail and crooked. The Oracle of the Covenant of the Luo Denomination!</p><p>With cold eyes, he looked in the direction that Meng Qi had gone.</p><p>“The elixirs of longevity are valuable, but it is more important to discover the source of these concoctions!”</p><p><em>“Let’s see where you can escape to when I have my secret techniques to trace you!”</em></p><p>He cast a cloaking enchantment on himself and then took to the air as he followed Meng Qi.</p><p>Not far away, there was a number of strangers who harbored similar intentions.</p><p>The Oracle had flown for a while when a sudden shock seized him. A confused and disbelieving Oracle stammered to himself.</p><p>“Vanished?”</p><p>“He vanished!”</p><p>The host of the auction was able to vanish without a trace despite his secret technique!</p><p><em>“How is this possible!?”</em></p><p>…</p><p>Verdant mounds of earth and small grassy dunes filled his view. A little path wound into the distance not far from the frontage of an ancient temple.</p><p>Meng Qi put his palms together and smiled. “Bodhisattva, I am here to meditate on the Primary Instruction of the Buddha’s Palm once again!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
