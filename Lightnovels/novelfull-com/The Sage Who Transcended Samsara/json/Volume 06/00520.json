She removed the Gist of Trueness of the Dharmakaya techniques of the dsicipline before handing the script over to Meng Qi.</p><p>Without the need to place the bamboo script on his forehead, Meng Qi’s spiritual sight projected outwards and studied the contents of the script he held.</p><p><em>BOOM!</em></p><p>His Vital Spirit sat high in a mysterious space of nothingness. Time and space intertwined as one, achieving substance and yet ethereality at the same time.</p><p>His “Vital Spirit” opened its eyes. Formless and ethereal, it was formed in shape but yet incorporeal. Chaos broke free, dividing into Yin and Yang like the creation of matter!</p><p>They were fantastic in their transformation and were immensely fast as well. Meng Qi could only grasp a little of its mystery. He had to obtain the Dharmakaya chapter of “Heavenly Golden Scripture” to fully find realization!</p><p>However, Meng Qi still had “Yin-Yang Seal”, which could divide Yin and Yang, transforming them into the origin. The process of transformation was thorough, elaborating the Dharma and Logos amongst the worlds, which allowed Meng Qi to be immersed in the realization.</p><p>The “Vital Spirit” stretched out its hand and mixed with the Dharma and Logos of Heaven and Earth. With the indescribable printings in its midst, it became chaotic, faint and dark.</p><p>The printings changed to become two hands playing back and forth. Yin and Yang were born and were interchanging in inexplicable ways, which made one unable to judge the Yin and Yang nature of the hands, resulting in it being impossible to protect against this move.</p><p>As the printings were pushed out, the chaos in front broke down, and clarity was separated from chaos. Various Yin and Yang principles were expounded!</p><p>After a lot of time had passed, Meng Qi slowly opened his eyes. One of his eyes was white and bright, with a pure black pupil. The other eye was dark, with a pure white pupil. They seem like two inverse “Yin and Yang Fish”.</p><p>He closed his eyes again, and they returned to their original state when he reopened them.</p><p>Yin-Yang Seal was indeed one of the “Nine Primeval Seals”. It encompassed the principles of the universe and hid the root of the ultimate Tao. Meng Qi could only have a superficial understanding of it.</p><p>Even that superficial understanding was only possible because he had created his own move, “Trio Combination of Yin and Yang, which is Yin and which is Yang?”, and had learnt the sword move “Yin-Yang Reversal” as well as “The Big Bang Technique”, which was a “Inner World movement” that can be cultivated to be more powerful. Such techniques made use of the discoveries and realizations of Yin and Yang, which resulted in Meng Qi having a superficial realization of “Yin-Yang Seal”.</p><p>The Exterior chapter of “Heavenly Golden Scripture” had many Dharma and Logos, as well as cultivation methods, and one was required to study it calmly and thoroughly for understanding and realization. It allowed Meng Qi to completely understand that after the combination of inner and outer world and the appearance of inner power in the outer world, Kung Fu and training of Qi would be completely different. He could then completely externalize his inner world and create many spell-like abilities, such as calling for wind, rain, or even lightning.</p><p>As for “Tri-gem Wish Fist”, Meng Qi had already understood the Exterior chapter. Now that he had deepened his realization, he needed to choose any of the three virtues of the five virtues for training.</p><p><em>I’m not sure if there was an option to exchange for the Qi of the five virtues at the Dominator of Samsara…</em> Meng Qi’s thoughts diverged.</p><p>Progenitor Doumu seemed to be able to sense his thoughts, and said softly, “The Qi of the five virtues were that of accomplishment, morality, blessing, virtue and darkness. They were obtained through doing actions that allowed for corresponding rewards from Heaven and Earth. There may be defects if one uses the Qi that others have obtained to train for one’s own techniques.”</p><p>“Which is to say that it would be better to collect it yourself…” Meng Qi nodded gently and asked, “Heaven and Earth is merciless, how can we expect for rewards from it?”</p><p>Heaven and Earth was not a true creature, so how could it hand out rewards?</p><p>Progenitor Doumu had a piece of jade bamboo script in her hand, “Everything in this world is mutually interdependent and affects each other. Big Tao Dharma and Logos, and the law of heaven and earth acts so too. They are like a dead volcano. If you attack the center with the full strength of one palm, it will erupt again. This eruption will be the reward for your attack.”</p><p>“Er, it’s like if I punch the wall once, the wall will return to me the force of one punch?” Meng Qi recalled the knowledge that he had learned in his previous life.</p><p>Seeing that Meng Qi had understood, Doumu continued, “Your effect on the Big Tao Dharma and Logos, and the law of the heavens and the earth’s movements will be retributed accordingly. The average man has little power, and his effect is thus limited, which made the ‘returns’ especially weak and imperceptible.”</p><p>“I see.” Meng Qi completely understood.</p><p>Progenitor Doumu looked at him again, “As one’s actions tend toward some kind of Big Tao Dharma and Logos or the laws of heaven and earth movements, the ‘returns’ that one obtains will be bigger, and can make one stronger. If one can completely imitate the same actions, one would become the Big Tao Dharma and Logos, or the laws of movements itself, and can completely immerse into Heaven and Earth, controlling part of them, becoming a special type of Dharmakaya. The Accomplishment Virtue Body and Blessing Virtue Body from Taoism are all examples of such. Erm, you were from Buddhism, you should know about ‘Sacrificing Body’ right? This is the Dharma Access to training ‘Sacrificing Body’.”</p><p>“Indeed, she is the leader of a giant sect, an experienced Samsara member; she had such great knowledge…” Meng Qi shook his head, as he could only be considered half a monk.</p><p>The expression of Domou remained a mystery under her mask. “The monk makes a wish in front of the Buddha. Fulfilling the wish would be to tend towards some kind of Big Tao Dharma and Logos, obtaining ‘returns’. But one cannot be too overbearing with such wishes. If one cannot complete the wish, having a big wish would be lying arrogantly, and no return can be obtained. If the wish is too strong, the return may be more than what one can endure, and it will transform into a disaster, with no hope of progressing further.”</p><p>“Before ancient times, Amitabha had forty-eight wishes, and had returns by the Big Tao, which allowed him to break through, to consummate and to give his body to the pure land, also known as the Western Blissed Land.”</p><p>“As long as one sincerely worships Buddha, one would return to the blissful world after death. Isn’t that becoming part of Heaven and Earth?”</p><p>Meng Qi was stunned, as he had remembered novels which he had read before. <em>Wasn’t this becoming Tao by making big wishes?</em></p><p>Suddenly, Meng Qi remembered a person and an event, “Progenitor, I had seen the current successor of Lanke Temple, Hong Neng, at Immensity Sea before. He was fulfilling wishes and building temples to shelter travelers of Immensity Sea from sandstorms. Could, could he be training in ‘Sacrificing Body’?”</p><p>Progenitor Doumu nodded gently, “Yes, Lanke Temple is one of the few Buddhism sects that trains for ‘Sacrificing Body’. Although I had never been there before, I can be sure that it has a Bodhisattva or Buddha present. No, I should say that Lanke Temple has become the pure land that they had sacrificed to, becoming part of Heaven and Earth.”</p><p>“The laws of Heaven and Earth’s movements and the Big Tao Dharma and Logos exists everywhere and is the basis for the expression of our inner power and cultivation. But can we feel them directly?”</p><p>Meng Qi mused, “I can feel their existence via their external appearance, but I cannot directly sense them.”</p><p>“Thus, Lanke Temple, which became part of Dharma and Logos of Heaven and Earth, could be omnipresent. It is just around the corner for those fate favor, yet universes away for others. If one is not a Dharmakaya, one can only hope that they allow you to enter voluntarily.” Master Lu was from Huamei Heights, and thus the secret of Lanke Temple was nothing to Progenitor Doumu.</p><p>Meng Qi blew out air lightly. He felt the fantastic nature of everything and the mysteries that fascinated people were everywhere, enticing people to explore further.</p><p>After Zhiwei’s arrival, they could go and find Hong Neng together. Even though he did not train “Sacrificing Body”, one could find realization from others’ cultivation methods as well, and he may even be able to enter Lanke Temple… He was having such thoughts and didn’t notice Progenitor Doumu handing him the jade bamboo script.</p><p>“This is?” Meng Qi asked in confusion.</p><p>Doumu replied calmly, “The superficial movement routes of all the techniques of The Immortals.”</p><p>“Your cultivation method is Eight Nine Mysteries, which is the route of the indestructible Tao, encompassing change. Seeing more, learning more and imitating more can help you improve, and can help you pretend to be other members at critical moments. It can be of great importance.”</p><p>Sensing the numerous complicated techniques in the jade bamboo script, Meng Qi took in a deep breath and had more sincerity about joining “The Immortals”. If he didn’t obtain these techniques here, he had to spend considerable effort looking for them himself so as to satisfy the different Aperture acupoints’ needs for different universes and different techniques, thus accommodating changes and keeping the body immortal.</p><p>It was of no wonder that almost no Samsara traveler chose the Eight Nine Mysteries. Although the defense was strong during the enlightenment period, and it specialized in deceiving, disguising and imitating, it had no real moves for attacking. Training in the Exterior realm will require a huge amount of resources to support it as well. If he had not joined The Immortals, he would have to work tens, hundreds, or even several thousand times harder, and the cultivation speed would be extremely slow, resulting in him dying from Samsara missions or by finishing his lifespan.</p><p>Meng Qi solemnly bowed and thanked “The Immortals”.</p><p>Progenitor Doumu gave him a deep look, “They may give you an official member mission after a few days.”</p><p>“What mission?” Meng Qi asked cautiously.</p><p>Progenitor Doumu pointed at Azure Palace, “Azure Heaven has more than nine entrances. There is one more in the depth of Azure Palace, leading to another world. In that world, Azure Palace is a symbol of strength and mystery.”</p><p>“The forces in that world we support have encountered a few problems, and we are unsure if they can resolve it by themselves. Anyways, if we need manpower, we will inform you.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded and agreed. He bid farewell to Progenitor Doumu and flew towards Immortal-tracking Alley. He had many objects which required Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms to examine and had many objects to exchange for Karma points.</p><p>At the central jade pillar of Immortal-tracking Alley, Meng Qi saw “Bluecloud Progenitor” Qu Jiuniang. She slurped, “‘Primogenitor’ is truly extraordinary, have you had any loot?”</p><p>She was referring to the killing of Ze Luoju by Meng Qi. Everyone from Immensity Sea knew the “richness” of Ze Luoju!</p><p>Meng Qi wore the “Heavenly Primogenitor” mask. He smiled lightly and took out Ze Luoju’s evil blade, many exotic minerals and products, as well as hundreds of Asoka Blossoms.</p><p>“So, so many…” Bluecloud Progenitor’s voice was full of shock. She was surprised and envious, and stared intensely at the floating objects in front of Meng Qi, unable to move her gaze away. “I, I would have assassinated Ze Luoju…”</p><p>She was weaker than Ze Luoju before her breakthrough. If not for Meng Qi striking at the most unexpected time and location, he might not have succeeded given Ze Luoju’s caution and vigilance.</p><p>As Bluecloud Progenitor was staring at the objects, Meng Qi put in the Devil-rinsing Flag and the hand bone from Old Zhong discretely for evaluation.</p><p>“Devil-rinsing Flag, divine weapon (broken), an object of Black Emperor Zhenwu, made from the origin mystic water created from his birth. It can command mist and protect one from evil. As it is severely broken, it can only use the power of the Exterior standard for three years. If prompted, it can use 50% of full power twice.”</p><p>“At present, it is worth 12,000 Karma points. To repair it to its original state, you need 70,000 Karma points.”</p><p>“Take note, if the user hasn’t crossed the first layer of Celestial Ladder, he cannot prompt the weapon.”</p><p>…</p><p>“The Netherworld’s hand bone, an object of divine weapon level. It was the Nine Serenities Evil Avatar – the Netherworld’s hand bone – but had lost its original power due to some strange reason, making it unable to show its miraculous strength. The current value is unknown.”</p><p>“To uncover the strange reason, 8,000 Karma points are needed.”</p><p>It was really the hand bone of “the Netherworld”… Meng Qi frowned.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
