The wind blew from time to time, carrying even more sand.</p><p>In the middle of a few weathered rocks, sand and gravel erupted upwards like a fountain and condensed into human figures. Meng Qi, Zhou Qiushan, and Flying Yaksha then appeared.</p><p>“Leader Yan, do you have any methods to temporarily crush the heart and soul of Blessing-endowed Heavenly Official?” Meng Qi directed asked without any hesitation.</p><p>If he had to do it himself, he would have to use the Nine-eyed Samsara Bead; however, since there was a helper present, he had no reason to use them.</p><p>Yan Wuwo was an experienced Samsara traveler, a grandmaster that was in the top 30 on the Terrestrial Rankings, the leader of a famous sect in River East. How could he not have similar treasures?</p><p>“Erm.” Yan Wuwo didn’t answer directly but instead walked straight toward Zhou Qiushan. Two white and sharp fangs appeared in his mouth as he bit Zhou Qiushan’s neck.</p><p>This made Meng Qi’s eyelids jump. Does practicing Zombie Fist really transform you into a Zombie?</p><p>Zhou Qiushan woke up dazed, his expressions rapidly changing. Eventually, he showed an expression of immense fear that was different to his mature self, which made even Meng Qi’s hair stand on ends.</p><p>His face was distorted as though he was trapped in an inescapable nightmare. Yan Wuwo pulled out his fangs, which were still white and clean without a single trace of blood.</p><p>“Within half an hour.” Yan Wuwo said.</p><p>Meng Qi carefully removed Zhou Qiushan’s Space Ring to allow Yan Wuwo to seal it, as he had learned his lesson from the Old Zhong incident. Then, his mid-brows tore open, and a dark and deep verticle eye emerged from it.</p><p>It was Supernatural Power of Shaking Heaven and Hitting Earth, a type of spiritual attack from Eight Nine Mysteries.</p><p>The surrounding gravel and rocks disappeared as everything sank into darkness. In the darkness, many golden spots laid on a waveless ocean.</p><p>As the golden spots jumped up, Zhou Qiushan started recalling everything about Bluecloud Progenitor or Qu Jiuniang.</p><p>Despite being clothed in a black dress and charming like a blooming flower, Jiuniang had a terrible temperament that was cold and unwelcoming. She always mistreated her clients and had extremely expensive food…</p><p>Stepping into Tan Han, he went into a normal-looking house. As he pushed the door open, he could see a listless Jiuniang seating cross-legged on the bed, leaning against the yellow-brown wall…</p><p>Another man sat opposite her and he wore a purple robe with a mask covering his face. It was Crape Myrtle Star!</p><p>The door opened again, and another man who was maskless entered.</p><p>However, before Meng Qi could see the man clearly, the image crumbled into pieces and dissipated into light spots. Black flames came out of Zhou Qiushan’s body and engulfed him immediately, burning him to ashes.</p><p>Meng Qi was too shocked to care about Zhou Qiushan’s death, and blurted out.</p><p>“Jiuniang is in Tan Han!”</p><p><em>Wasn’t she in the canal between Fish Sea and Tan Han?</em></p><p><em>Who was the real Jiuniang?</em></p><p>“They transferred her to the canal from Tan Han?” Yan Wuwo had not considered such a possibility and finally said after hesitating for a long time.</p><p>“Impossible,” Meng Qi said quietly. “Zhou Qiushan went to Tan Han this morning before he reached the place where the Buddha Aura was surging. We had just explored the canal then.”</p><p>They spent half a day looking for Zhou Qiushan, and it had already become evening. The sunset turned the gravel blood-red, and the desert looked immensely beautiful under the shower of sunshine.</p><p><em>“f Jiuniang was really in Tan Han, who was in that canal?</em></p><p>Cold sweat appeared on Meng Qi’s forehead as he realized seemed to have escaped a catastrophe.</p><p>He paused before continuing, “This matter definitely concerns the Myths, and the trap laying in the canal will be more dangerous than what we imagined. Thus, even if Zhou Qiushan saw Jiuniang yesterday and we cannot eliminate the possibility of them transferring her to the canal, I still suggest investigating Tan Han first. Only Crape Myrtle Star should be there. Of course, there would be other members of the Myths nearby.”</p><p>Yan Wuwo’s expression changed after hearing this, and said, “The Myths must have realized that Zhou Qiushan is missing now. There must be a change in their plans now, thus we need to rush to Tan Han immediately.”</p><p>He wanted Primogenitor Lingbao to strike initially to eliminate Crape Myrtle Star, the third most powerful member of the Myths, but he was too cautious just now and didn’t kill Qian Kai and The Gatekeeper Lu Jiang. They should be spreading the news to Tan Han now, and their investigation would be fruitless if they were too late!</p><p>Meng Qi immediately realized this and did not hesitate. He didn’t even stop to check the items in Zhou Qiushan’s space ring before keeping it, allowing Yan Wuwo to pull him underground at once.</p><p>Gobi Desert of the Immensity Sea was a place most suitable for Earth Escape. After a while, some gravel from Tan Han moved, signaling their arrival.</p><p>Like Fish Sea, the peasants and those beginners who had just enlightened their Apertures had been evacuated to another Oasis. There were only a few experts of the Exterior on the streets looking for treasure, making the place look desolate.</p><p>They were opposite the house in Zhou Qiushan’s memory. Meng Qi and Yan Wuwo pretend to just pass by the place and realized that the defenses there looked slack, but it was actually heavily guarded. They had utilized the Qi of Heaven and Earth to hide the breaths of many.</p><p>No wonder the soul lamp couldn’t point here!</p><p>As they passed by the house, Meng Qi volunteered, “Leader Yan, I shall go in to investigate her presence first.”</p><p>“Sure.” Yan Wuwo nodded.</p><p>Meng Qi transformed into a gerbil once more and entered the house, pretending to steal food.</p><p>He found the original rat hole, from where a terrible stench entered his nostrils. He almost fainted but still endured as he carefully approached the target courtyard.</p><p>After running along the rat hole for a while, Meng Qi suddenly stopped as a breath that was extremely inward-looking but life-threatening filled the air, as if the leader of all-stars were present.</p><p>A normal gerbil would immediately turn around and run away after feeling this breath.</p><p>Thus, Meng Qi did the same.</p><p>Meng Qi ran away out of the house and returned back to Yan Wuwo before transforming back into human form. He then said, “It was indeed Crape Mrytle Star, but he was very cautious and was scared of exposing himself, thus choosing not to envelop the whole Tan Han with his spiritual energy. However, the whole courtyard he was staying at has his breath, blocking the interior from the outside world as well as scaring any living organism, thus preventing anything from entering.”</p><p>“Since Crape Myrtle Star is so cautious, there is a high possibility that Jiuniang is imprisoned inside,” Yan Wuwo said as he nodded. “We should find a chance to ambush him. Even if Jiuniang is not inside, if we can capture a high-level Myths Official, we can still exchange for Jiuniang later.”</p><p>“What if she is inside? Facing an ambush, Crape Myrtle Star may just kill her.” Since he was unsure about the situation inside, Meng Qi was a little hesitant.</p><p>Yan Wuwo finally had a rare smile on his face as he explained, “That depends on you.”</p><p>“On me?” Meng Qi was confused, but immediately understood what he meant after that. “Leader Yan, you mean I should become Zhou Qiushan and go in through the front gate. As long as Crape Myrtle Star doesn’t realize, I will cooperate with you to save Jiuniang.”</p><p>“If Jiuniang is not present, utilize the spells to deal with Crape Myrtle Star or other members of the Myths. If Jiuniang is inside, I will protect her using it?”</p><p>If a grandmaster was present and cautious, Meng Qi’s transformation ability might still not be able to fool them. But Zhou Qiushan was a member of the Myths, and it made logical sense for him to arrive here. As long as he did not make any mistake, Crape Myrtle Star should not suspect him.</p><p>“Yes.” Yan Wuwo started at Meng Qi and continued, “The Eight Nine Mysteries is mysterious and unpredictable, which is why Primogenitor tasked you with the mission of helping me.”</p><p>Time was precious. If the message of Zhou Qiushan arrived, Crape Myrtle Star would kill “Zhou Qiushan” and Qu Jiuniang immediately. Thus, Meng Qi didn’t hesitate and transformed into Zhou Qiushan immediately. He wore an official’s robe and had a black mole under his right eyebrows. Be it the breath or the sense of prosperity and virtue, he seemed exactly like Zhou Qiushan. Furthermore, he had Zhou Qiushan’s space ring on his finger.</p><p>The only problem was that Meng Qi didn’t know the skill of Zhou Qiushan and thus had to conceal his genuine Qi, pretending to arrive discretely.</p><p>He touched the array map that Primogenitor Lingbao lent him, and felt heartache. It loooked like he had to use it regardless.</p><p>“Primogenitor sacrificed much for this…” He blurted out.</p><p>Yan Wuwo explained flatly, like a real zombie, “The treasures and Karma points members used are all owned by the organization, and they are not Primogenitor’s possessions. Thus, in the rescue missions, all used objects will be compensated with Karma points. After all, some members have deep friendships while others were only acquaintances. If I asked you to save me by using all of your treasures, would you not feel heartache or hesitation?”</p><p><em>Of course not! Saving a big shot like you would mean much higher gains than the treasures I have.</em> Meng Qi thought silently. But he agreed with this rule of the Immortals as it would protect the personal interest of all its members, or they would not be able to endure such missions after a few times. Everyone would become selfish and cold, and the organization would die off!</p><p>After taking a deep breath, Meng Qi went to the entrance of Tan Han and flew into the city. He then “carefully” and “stealthily” went to the courtyard housing Crape Myrtle Star.</p><p>Using the memory of Zhou Qiushan, Meng Qi knocked on the door using three long and four short knocks.</p><p>The door opened abruptly, and a slit appeared. Meng Qi hurried in and shut the door before running to Crape Myrtle Star’s room.</p><p>As he pushed the door of the room open, he saw Crape Myrtle Star sitting cross-legged on the bed, wearing a mask and his emperor robe, while concealing his breath. Opposite him, there was a heatable sleeping platform, where the pale and weak-spirited Qu Jiuniang sat. She seemed to have been greatly injured.</p><p><em>Jiuniang is indeed here!</em></p><p><em>The “Jiuniang” in he canal is fake?</em></p><p><em>Or is this fake?</em></p><p>Meng Qi pressed onto the Array Map and the Reincarnation Talisman stealthily, and said with a slightly nervous tone, “Master, Qian Kai went missing! Someone might have taken him away!”</p><p>Crape Myrtle Star was going to ask why “Zhou Qiushan” had come, but changed his question after hearing that. “Where did he go missing?”</p><p>Just after he spoke, he saw “Zhou Qiushan” pounce on Qu Jiuniang whilst throwing an array map at him.</p><p>Green, red, black and white sword lights surged up to the sky, and the void collapsed. Everything was destroyed, including the colors, and everything turned black and white. Even black and white seemed to contract inwards, leaving only chaos behind. It was like a congealed chicken!</p><p>The frightening Sword Qi blocked Crape Myrtle Star from attacking Meng Qi and stopped the spell that he subconsciously used.</p><p>His index finger shone as if all the stars had conglomerated there, and explosive energies condensed at the fingertip!</p><p>Silently, half of the chaotic array map had dissipated, and slight scars appeared on the right index finger of Crape Myrtle Star.</p><p>Sensing movement, half of the roof collapsed, and a fist hit downwards. It had nine strong and majestic Fiery-Red Dragons surrounding it. Their heat was burning inwards, and the power was condensed. Everything within a mile had been burnt to ashes!</p><p>With a snort, Crape Myrtle Star opened all 365 Aperture acupoints in his body, and zodiacs flew out of them, shaking the void and the heat, punching out!</p><p>The endless starlight and fire waves engulfed the surroundings, completely destroying the array map. Meng Qi had grabbed onto Qu Jiuniang long ago and had escaped with the help of Flowing Fire and some of the less dangerous flames that Yan Wuwo purposely left behind.</p><p>In a minute, Meng Qi had jumped in and out of flames and escaped out of Tan Han.</p><p>After a while, Yan Wuwo caught up and they met. He then removed Qu Jiuniang’s seal, while Meng Qi was on guard for any tricks.</p><p>As the sea was lifted, Qu Jiuniang’s eyes glazed at the ground blankly, as if her heart was dead. She said quietly,</p><p>“My space ring…”</p><p><em>Whew, this is the real one…</em> Meng Qi wiped his cold sweat off.</p><p>……</p><p>At the canal, the red-faced man walked back and forth continually.</p><p>Suddenly, the Qu Jiuniang next to him stood up by herself. Her breath and body shape changed and became a tall man. He was wearing an imperial robe and a flat crown, with a solemn mask on his face.</p><p>The Heaven Sovereign mask!</p><p>“Lingbao wouldn’t come…” He whispered to the void in front, at no one in particular.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
