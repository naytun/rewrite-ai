The tranquil ancient temple, hidden deep in the woods, stood stark against the storm of sand and granule. Yet it seemed like an oasis that merged harmoniously with Immensity Sea as if Lanke Temple had been here since the beginning of time.</p><p>A compassionate voice came drifting from within the temple, “Young Donor Su, you’re free to realize it now.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded but a doubt soon crept into his mind. “Bodhisattva, how can I find Lanke Temple if I wish to realize it again in the future?”</p><p><em>“Don’t tell me I have to find you via Shui Yue Nunnery or Shaolin Temple each time…”</em></p><p>The man from Lanke Temple seemed to be harboring a smile and said serenely, “I’ve remembered you, Young Donor Su. If you sincerely chant ‘Namo Candramurni Prabharaja Bodhisattva’ in your heart three times, you’ll be able to see Lanke Temple as long as you’re still in this world. The same goes for all the other donors as well.”</p><p>“Namo Candramurni Prabharaja Bodhisattva? I’ve never heard of it. Seems like it’s a Bodhisattva Buddhist Realm that has only been claimed in the past millennium…” The name of the incantation was the first thing that caught his attention and the rest of the sentence equally stunned him.</p><p><em>“This is a way to escape and hide inside Lanke Temple!”</em></p><p>With the ability of Lanke Temple to teleport anywhere and everywhere, he would have access to a door of convenience with just a sincere chant of Bodhisattva’s name. He could enter the temple and linger around to comprehend the Withering Bodhi Tree. This did not seem like much but upon a second thought, he found it to be a profound discovery.</p><p>Disregarding the fact that he might not be able to chant sincerely while being engaged in a fierce battle, it was entirely possible for him to hide inside Lanke Temple if he could not get rid of his pursuers.</p><p>This was, essentially, a ‘life-preserving incantation’! It offers the same benefits as the Reincarnation Charm!</p><p>The only problem was that the use of the incantation was limited to this world alone.</p><p>This came as a pleasant surprise to Meng Qi. Who would not be happy if they receive another ‘life-preserving incantation’?</p><p>Earlier, he had been lamenting to himself that he had made a mistake by not immediately using the Reincarnation Charm after snatching the Withering Bodhi Tree. If he had done that, he would have at least obtained its impartation once.</p><p>Of course, that choice also had concealed dangers. For example, there seemed to be some connection between the former Crown Prince, Zhao Qian and the Myths. If he found out the secrets of the Reincarnation Charm from the latter, Meng Qi would be endangered because Chong He and Immortal Yunhe would not know where he was and would not be able to rescue him. The rest could only stay around to guard his ‘corpse’. These were all factors that he had taken into consideration earlier, ultimately prompting him to forgo the decision to use the Reincarnation Charm. Later on, Yunhe’s escape was proven to be successful and he seemed to have gotten rid of his pursuers as well. That was why he chose not to use it.</p><p>More importantly, he was uncertain whether Candramurni Bodhisattva was intervening because of fate or because he wanted to deliberately ‘mislead’ Yunhe’s escape route and force them to run straight into the temple. If the latter was true, he would not have been able to use the Reincarnation Charm from the very beginning!</p><p>Even though he had lost the opportunity to obtain the impartation, the option to comprehend it whenever he wished was not too bad either. Furthermore, the ‘life-preserving incantation’ was enough to make up for his loss.</p><p>He calmed down and sat cross-legged on the ground in front of Zhen Hui, Hong Neng and the other Dharmakayas. His eyes, half-closed as his spirit, gradually reached for the Withering Bodhi Tree in his hand. He did not attempt to deepen their connection to the tree and was merely slowly stimulating it.</p><p>This was a Dharma Access of perception rather than acquisition. Meng Qi dared not to demonstrate his narrow-mindedness in the pure land of a genuine Bodhisattva. Even if the Bodhisattva did not kill him, getting the punishment of listening to the Buddhist scriptures in Lanke Temple for 10 years and the like would undoubtedly be unavoidable.</p><p>The Withering Bodhi Tree began to sway gently following the stimulation as if trying to shelter the monks under its branches from wind and rain. One side of the tree was fresh and green; full of vitality. The other was withered and yellow; shrinking deep into itself.</p><p>Meng Qi had the sudden feeling that he was turned into a monk under the tree but the sensation faded instantly. Before he knew it, he was now a member of the group listening to a talk.</p><p>The monk under the tree had a large plump face and a head of hair that resembled that of Buddha. His expression flitted between anguish, compassion, solemnness and sereneness. From time to time, his body would transform into a six-foot body, seated on the ground in the open air. The images changed, over and over again.</p><p>“All that has a form is illusive and unreal… When you see that all forms are illusive and unreal, you will then begin to perceive your true Buddhist nature…”</p><p>His voice was not loud, yet it carried an unmistakable grandeur as it resounded clearly in Meng Qi’s ears.</p><p>Meng Qi felt as if he could understand the monk’s words, yet comprehension seemed to slip out of his grasp at the same time. He sank into fascination as he listened. He then saw a golden udumbara flower gently floating down from midair as wells of spring water mushrooming all over the ground and numerous lotus flowers bloomed.</p><p>A golden Buddharupa materialized out of thin air behind the monk, accompanied with Amitabha, Bodhi, lit lamps and the relinquishing of one’s body – the Homage of the Buddhas!</p><p>Maitreya, Guanyin Bodhisattva and Maha Bodhisattva were also present. From their mouths came the quiet sound of chanting.</p><p>“Just as I’ve heard!”</p><p>The surroundings of the Withering Bodhi Tree evolved into a bright and radiant world and materialized the vast, boundless sea of bitterness. Brilliant rays of light radiated from behind the head of the monk under the tree, illuminating the deep and dark waters of the ‘sea’. A speck of light coming from an infinitely distant place was reverberating.</p><p>The monk interpreted an endless amount of scriptures. The udumbara flower floating gently down morphed into a large script of neither Sanskrit nor seal script language. Its nature was fair and straightforward, so much so that it even demonstrated the Swastikas Seal.</p><p>These golden scripts danced around Meng Qi in an endless chain, occasionally drifting in and out of him.</p><p>Meng Qi was immersed in the ambiance of the Big Golden Buddha. He pointed a finger at the sky and placed the other palm on the ground. In his solemnness was a boundless feeling of Zen Philosophies. His mouth was moving, producing a magnificent and transcendent voice.</p><p>“I’m the only one between heaven and earth.”</p><p>The monk under the tree abruptly stood up and took seven steps. He then pointed his finger at the sky and touched the ground with his other hand. The portrait of Buddha was solemn and dignified.</p><p>“I’m the only one between heaven and earth.”</p><p>With a boom, the Big Golden Buddha in Meng Qi’s mind seemed to have caused the emergence of tens of thousands of scripts and precepts. Zen sounds resounded ceaselessly, sending tremors through his Vital Spirit. The Holy Inscriptions on his hands changed so constantly that it was difficult to see them. However, they ultimately returned to their original appearance, whereby one hand was pointing at the sky and both feet were firmly planted on the ground. Only “I” remained in the three realms!</p><p>Suddenly, Meng Qi felt a piercing pain in his Vital Spirit. He had unexpectedly reached the limits of his endurance. The Big Golden Buddha, the monk under the tree, and the Buddha Homage had disappeared. Only the Withering Bodhi Tree remained before his eyes.</p><p><em>“Looks like I won’t be able to complete this realization at once. I’d have to grow and comprehend this slowly. It’s already good enough that I managed to realize a little of it…”</em> Meng Qi secretly lamented.</p><p>It was a commendable enough achievement to be able to comprehend even a little of ‘I, the Unique and Righteous’. The same had happened to Jiang Zhiwei when she was learning her Anatta Sword.</p><p>“The only thing I’m worried about is that I’ll need a year or two to learn enough to imitate it…” When Meng Qi lifted his hand to rub his temples, he realized he was the center of attention for the Dharmakayas. Zhen Hui was the only confused face around.</p><p>“What’s wrong, Junior Brother?” Meng Qi asked, soundlessly relaying his voice to Zhen Hui.</p><p>There was no way he could pose this question openly even if others could eavesdrop on their conversation.</p><p>Zhen Hui shook his head with a confused expression. “What do you mean what’s wrong?”</p><p>“Why is everyone looking at me?” Meng Qi asked, puzzled.</p><p>“You’re the only one who was realizing, Senior Brother. Everyone will of course be staring at you,” Zhen Hui answered matter-of-factly.</p><p>Meng Qi was momentarily speechless, feeling a familiar lethargy when it came to conversing with his Junior Brother.</p><p>“Have all of you donors come to an agreement about the order of realization?” Candramurni Prabharaja Bodhisattva of Lanke Temple asked in an unchanging voice.</p><p>Chong He, with his snow-white hair, grinned. “They’ve agreed to let me be the second by virtue of my seniority.”</p><p><em>“So they’re going by age… If they’re going to decide the order based on strength, I’m afraid it’ll be difficult to determine a victor among some of them…”</em> Meng Qi could not help himself from nodding.</p><p>Chong He flew inside Lanke Temple and sat cross-legged in front of Withering Bodhisattva, thus, triggering the swaying of the leaves.</p><p>He opened his eyes after about half an hour and his pupils started swimming with contemplative meaning. No one knew what he had managed to realize or whether what he had learned would be of any help to solve his current troubles.</p><p>Chong He said little and exchanged the spot with Kong Wen where he soundlessly relayed his voice to Master Lu, ‘explaining’ everything that had happened including how Meng Qi was the first to find him. However, due to his desire to obtain Buddha’s Palm as well as the contradiction between Buddhism and Taoism, it was inconvenient for him to make his move openly. Thus, he sent Meng Qi to Huamei Heights of North Zhou Dynasty.</p><p>This allowed Meng Qi, who was in the West Regions, to have a reasonable explanation in making an abrupt appearance at Huamei Heights.</p><p>Master Lu and Chong He had collaborated countless times and shared a deeply personal friendship. Neither of them cared about the details of the event. Thus, Master Lu gave a gentle nod and asked no further.</p><p>Kong Wen spent an entire hour before finally getting up. When he saw Meng Qi, he looked bewildered.</p><p>“The abbot took a little longer than you did, Senior Brother!” Zhen Hui commented as if he had discovered something impressive.</p><p>Meng Qi frowned. “Did I take a long time?”</p><p>“You took much more time than Senior Chong He,” Zhen Hui answered honestly.</p><p>“Is there any phenomenon?” Meng Qi asked.</p><p>His Junior Brother shook his head, indicating that such an outcome had somewhat disappointed him.</p><p><em>“So the Dharmakayas are staring at me because I took such a long time…”</em> Meng Qi was relieved. He had obtained the first style, while the abbot had obtained the third. <em>“Is that why he took so long?”</em></p><p><em>“If that’s the case, this can be considered a blessing in disguise for Abbot Kong Wen!”</em></p><p>Everyone present gradually flew inside the pure land to comprehend the tree, though they did not follow a strict order of age. The Dharmakayas were the first ones to go, while the rest brought up the rear. The Buddhism followers took a comparatively long time. Those from Jin Gang Temple who possessed the fifth style took even longer, second only to Kong Wen. This turn of events successfully clouded the uniqueness of Meng Qi’s realization.</p><p>However, there were always exceptions. Master Lu floated in midair the entire time, carefully watching everyone as they comprehended the tree. There was not even the slightest hint of greed in his eyes; they were simply pure and crystal clear. When someone asked him if he would like to have a go at it, he smiled and shook his head. He gave no explanation, simply showing his resolute and firm attitude.</p><p>“Since you’ve come across it, naturally it means you’re fated with it. Hong Neng and Zhen Hui, why don’t you two comprehend it as well?” Since the Withering Bodhi Tree did not fall squarely in his hands, Meng Qi was able to generously invite his Junior Brother and his life savior, Hong Neng.</p><p>The masters and experts were so busy processing what they had just learned that they did not have the time to care if the juniors were taking liberties. Candramurni Bodhisattva of Lanke Temple said nothing, so it was taken as a silent consent. Zhen Hui had always been a pure and guileless person, even appearing somewhat slow. He smiled as he went up to the Withering Bodhi Tree and began realizing with a sincere heart.</p><p>This incident had given Meng Qi a firmer grasp of the stance of Lanke Temple. It seemed that the temple would allow it if he brought others to come and comprehend it in the future. He was, after all, the owner and Lanke Temple was only the trustee.</p><p>The Withering Bodhi Tree began swaying once again, continuing for close to an hour. It was merely a little shorter than the time Kong Wen took. Meng Qi stared at his Junior Brother with some astonishment.</p><p>Though he was not surprised that his Junior Brother, who had cultivated such a deep understanding of Flower-pinching Finger at a great speed, was able to comprehend the third style of Buddha’s Palm to such a degree. He still should not be exceeding the time taken by the grandmasters from Jin Gang Temple!</p><p>He himself was no longer a part of Buddhism and his heart was not as pure as his Junior Brother’s. There was no need for comparison between them.</p><p>The swaying of the Withering Bodhi Tree came to an end but Zhen Hui remained seated with his eyes closed, a smile playing at his lips. His showcasing of Zen Philosophies was evident.</p><p>When Meng Qi saw Abbot Kong Wen falling beside Zhen Hui, he asked, “What’s wrong with Junior Brother?”</p><p>Kong Wen chuckled. “He has fallen asleep.”</p><p><em>“Fallen… fallen asleep…”</em> The corner of Meng Qi’s mouth twitched.</p><p>Kong Wen held Zhen Hui up all the while, smiling at Meng Qi. “I’m afraid he’ll remain asleep for half of or an entire year. He has obtained too great an in-depth of a harvest, startling his Vital Spirit into submerging him in deep sleep.”</p><p><em>“Doesn’t he know how to interrupt the realization by himself?”</em> Kong Wen’s answer relieved Meng Qi but he could not help mocking his Junior Brother in his mind. However, on a second thought, it would even stranger if Zhen Hui had interrupted it midway, considering his character.</p><p>When Hong Neng was also done with his comprehension, Candramurni Bodhisattva of Lanke Temple said in an ever calm and serene voice, “I’ve made a great wish and promised not to attain or meet Buddha. The Withering Bodhi Tree will be placed in front of the temple gates. You’re all free to come and comprehend it from time to time.”</p><p>With that, everyone began biding each other farewell and taking their leave. The only ones left were Kong Wen and Immortal Yunhe.</p><p>“Young Donor Su, I’ve once promised…” Kong Wen turned to look at Meng Qi, all while still carrying Zhen Hui. He intended to honor the promise he had made Meng Qi earlier.</p><p>Meng Qi instantly waved his hands, saying, “Save your words, Abbot. I have but one wish. I only wish to make up for my mistake and obtain permission for the divine monk, Master Xuan Bei, to enter the upper levels of the stupa to comprehend.”</p><p>Kong Wen laughed compassionately, “Won’t you hear how I intend to repay you? Perhaps it’ll be much more valuable than your request.”</p><p>Meng Qi turned around, shaking his head. “That’s not necessary. I’m worried I’ll be tempted after finding out about it.”</p><p>Meng Qi felt a deep sense of relief upon thinking that he could finally repay his Master for all the things the latter had done for him. He felt his Vital Spirit becoming lively and energetic.</p><p>He burst out into laughter, feeling more carefree than ever. He then took flight and left.</p><p>Being a true man in the Jianghu, one must always repay his debts whether of revenge or of gratitude!</p><p>Kong Wen sighed as he watched Meng Qi’s disappearing figure, feeling deeply gratified. “How rare and precious that he could defy his greed at such a young age…”</p><p>…</p><p>Before Lanke Temple disappeared into thin air, there was a heavy rainstorm that turned the Bogda Shan mountain range of Fish Sea into a massive lake. Its size was comparable to that of Hahler. With the flow of nearby undercurrents through the lake, plants began germinating and growing. The place soon became a great oasis, full of vitality.</p><p>Meng Qi was submerged in the water. His eyes were bright as he looked around, shouting, “Immortal Yunhe, hurry up and demonstrate your might! We can’t let anyone do it before you!”</p><p>He made a detour to the vicinity of the Fish Sea on his way back to the lair of the Immortals. This place was the battleground of the Dharmakayas; there was no telling whether there would be treasures like Monster King’s blood or the bodies of the Dharmakayas left behind. These were all excellent materials for forging Precious Weapons.</p><p>The Dharmakayas might find these materials to be beneath them, but their juniors would definitely be interested in obtaining them. There was no time to lose, even if Meng Qi had to resort to asking the fake old grandpa Immortal Yunhe for help!</p><p><em>“I’m just that greedy of a person!”</em></p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
