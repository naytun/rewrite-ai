Its contents were so cluttered and stuffed that Meng Qi could only remove one item at a time.</p><p>A lotus first appeared on his palms from the innards of the Space Ring. Its seven-layered petals exuded a refreshingly invigorating fragrance that would enliven all that breathed in its lovely scent.</p><p>“It is a magical artifact that defends its wielder against assaults on the Vital Spirit. It should be at least on the level of the Fourth-fold Heaven,” said Jiang Zhiwei who instantly recognized the item. She had once seen an item with similar properties during a look into the vaults of her order, the Sword Washing Pavilion.</p><p>“A useful item then,” replied Meng Qi with delight.</p><p>His present mastery of the Eight Nine Mysteries technique was still lacking, especially against Generals Heng and Ha and other foes of the Apotheosized realm. The secret artifact would greatly reinforce his defenses in the course of the mission, increasing his survivability.</p><p>Along with the White Lotus Seat of the Seventh Order, from the Space Ring came a chunk of Suiyue Metal of Taiyin and three other pieces of exotic minerals. The items seemed to have been used by the Howling Lunar Hound in the process of his training and cultivation of his powers. Finding no use for them, Meng Qi could only trade them for other items or Karma points.</p><p>Meng Qi stuck his hand into the Space Ring, from whence he drew out seven to eight flowers of the most bizarre appearance, all of which were distinguishable from their different colors; however, Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei noticed the flowers instantly.</p><p>“The ingredients for brewing the Immortality Elixir of the East Pole!” Meng Qi exclaimed with a faint glee.</p><p>For quite some time, Meng Qi had been in possession of the formula for brewing the Immortality Elixir and its main ingredient: the Qinghua Fruit. Yet the relatively costly price of attaining the rest of the ingredients added with the present fact that he and his company had yet to experience an immediate need for such elixirs of longevity, Meng Qi has long set aside his plans for brewing the elixir himself. With most of the ingredients presently amassed, he could trade for the rest with a relatively menial cost of Karma points. It should not be long for him to acquire one of the rarest elixirs of longevity with the help of Pao-P’u-Zu of The Immortals or the Dominator himself!</p><p>Most warriors of the Exterior Scenery enjoyed lives up to twice or thrice of sixty years, and the Immortality Elixir of the East Pole could further lengthen the life of one for an additional sixty years. Its truly attractive allure, especially for warriors of the elder generations who were at the twilight of their health, could indeed be priceless beyond measure!</p><p>Many rewards and much profit would have been in store even if Meng Qi had not the aspirations of consuming one for his own!</p><p>Awashed by surprise and contentment, Meng Qi rummaged through the rest of the contents and calculated the amount of cost that he would require to trade for the items he would need for his training and cultivation. He would only have to complete the dealings between him and the Plenitude Sect and the Darkness Palace and he would have sufficient resources at his disposal. He would even have additional exotic minerals for spare if the items could be acquired through other means besides the notoriously unscrupulous Dominator of the Six Samsara Realms.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei watched Meng Qi stowing the magical herbs away, amused at his elation. She and her teacher’s youth had absolved them of any need for any elixirs of longevity such as the Immortality Elixir.</p><p>“Hey…” Meng Qi’s face changed after noticing something within the Space Ring.</p><p>Chunks and lumps of flesh as well as torn pieces from corpses littered the inside of the Space Ring. Mortal aura emanated still from the pieces of human flesh. Lingering strength and powers of the formerly living endured still in every drop of blood, every inch of skin and every shred of sinews of the grotesque human parts.</p><p>“Warriors of the Exterior Scenery!”</p><p>“Humans!”</p><p>Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei uttered in unison with grievous shock.</p><p><em>Many a great human warrior of the Exterior Scenery had fallen by the hands of the Howling Lunar Hound, and yet he carried their corpses at all times?</em></p><p>Jiang Zhiwei lightly breathed in the wafting odor of the chunks of flesh. “There are scents of demons on the flesh,” she said as she grimaced with sorrow and disgust. “These are fodder for demons or predators.”</p><p>“Ah, yes. The Thunder God from the Ninth Heaven was in league with a demon hound,” Meng Qi said as his mood took a plummeting fall, his hatred and contempt for the race of demons and monsters rising.</p><p>His insides grew cold with a sudden dread of déjà vu; he had once encountered a similar sight during his journey to the stronghold of The Immortals guild. He had witnessed the deathly and terrifying sight of corpses of Exterior warriors lying around, left to decay and rot in chunks of torn bits!</p><p><em>“Was that also the act of demons and monsters?”</em></p><p>“The emergence of the formula of the Buddha’s Palm has attracted numerous Exterior warriors who are vying for its possession. The demons of the Heavenly Sea Source might have pounced on such an abundance of lambs for slaughter,” deduced Jiang Zhiwei sombrely.</p><p>The demon hound, on the other hand, would most likely be a member of The Myths.</p><p>There was only a half that remained of the naked corpse; it was dismembered for its admission into the Space Ring. The eerily misshapen parts inhibited Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei from discerning the identity of the dead person.</p><p>Meng Qi could not bear the idea of allowing the dead to be further defiled by monsters and demons. Flames erupted from his left hand as he set the corpse alight, allowing it to burn and be consumed by the flames to give it peace.</p><p>Meng Qi collected his items and was preparing to take his leave from his companion when a sudden, foreboding feeling of dismay struck him.</p><p>“No, wait!”</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Jiang Zhiwei asked, perplexed.</p><p>“No healing elixirs or draughts were found to be in the possession of the demon hound,” Meng Qi said, pointing at his Space Ring. “Save a Fruit of Deliverance for someone.”</p><p>The Fruit of Deliverance was an ingredient for a number of healing medicines and brews, yet, its direct ingestion would only yield a moderate effect to its user. With sufficient exotic resources and ingredients, the demon hound should have adequate elixirs and medicines with him, especially if he was indeed a member of The Myths!</p><p>He looked again at the copper staff which he stowed away earlier. It was formerly wielded by the demon hound despite its crude furnishings and craft.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei caught the gist of Meng Qi’s words in an instant. They were, for all intents and purposes, experienced Samsara travelers in their own right. “You are right,” she muttered. “There is more than meets the eye about the demon hound’s connection to the Myths.”</p><p>Their debate ensued for some time before they took their leave. Jiang Zhiwei returned to meet with the elders of her order, where they would return to their lair. Meng Qi would seek out Qu Jiuniang at the agreed site of their meeting.</p><p>…</p><p>Brown sand and black gravels flew through the air, buffeted by the strong winds that pounded mercilessly on the weather-worn rocks. Its brutal winds masked the presence of a lone man flying by in the air.</p><p>Qu Jiuniang had been waiting when Meng Qi arrived at the site of their choosing, clothed in robes of obsidian shade that accentuated her fair complexion and beautiful skin.</p><p>She paced back and forth with an impatient anxiousness that rang in the wake of her footsteps. A patch of pink burned on her cheeks in anticipation of their upcoming endeavor.</p><p>In an abrupt turn, she spun to face Meng Qi when she sensed him approaching. “I have yet to locate the whereabouts of the perverted monks of Merriment Temple,” she remarked with restless anxiety. “Only warriors of the Exterior Scenery swarmed across the northern mountain ranges near Tan Han and Fish Sea.”</p><p>The intelligence network that she and Drunk Xie had established across the Western Regions had relied chiefly on agents below the levels of the Exterior Scenery. Their most recent predicament that culminated in the dismantling of their network had rendered them senseless like the blind and the deaf!</p><p>Meng Qi shooked his head lightly. “No matter,” he said patiently. “I wish to speak to Primogenitor; there are more pressing issues to discuss.”</p><p>“No matter…” answered Qu Jiuniang at a loss. Meng Qi’s remark had taken her back with a slight disappointment.</p><p>Still, Qu Jiuniang could feel the urgency that has compelled Meng Qi to make such a request. “Something important?” she asked with a different but solemn tone.</p><p>“It’s of the gravest importance,” Meng Qi replied with a nod.</p><p>Qu Jiuniang regained her composure after being deflated of her fervent eagerness. “Very well,” she said. “Let’s return to Azure Heaven. If he’s not there, we shall burn the talisman that he had left and hastily summon him.”</p><p>“Very good,” Meng Qi answered. He was worried that they would have to comb through fen and forest to seek the whereabouts of Primogenitor Lingbao. The Immortals hardly lacked resources and methods as an experienced band of warriors and masters of the martial arts.</p><p>They entered the dimension of Azure Heaven and the booming voice of the Dominator of the Six Samsara Realms resounded in Meng Qi’s ears.</p><p>“Detection of the Plenitude Gate confirmed. The effect and use of the item shall be sealed until your departure from this realm for secrecy.”</p><p><em>“This…”</em> Meng Qi grimaced with a frown. <em>“The Dominator of the Six Samsara Realms is meticulous indeed!”</em></p><p>Upon their entry, they had found that Primogenitor Lingbao was indeed absent. Qu Jiuniang immediately went to retrieve a talisman to summon their leader while Meng Qi ventured into the Immortal-tracking Alley to identify the loots of his duels with the Thunder God of the Ninth Heaven, the Howling Lunar Hound, and the Blessing-endowed Heavenly Official.</p><p>He first circled the entirety of the Immortal-tracking Alley and found the notice that he had requested Qu Jiuniang to leave on the items and exotic minerals that he had left for trade with the rest of the members of The Myths <em>. “Qu Jiuniang might have a perpetual hunger for wealth, but she is hardly a brazen fool that could not withstand temptation,”</em> Meng Qi thought with an approving nod.</p><p>He drifted to the center of the alley where the jade column stood. He produced the spoils of his adventures and allowed the Dominator to identify them.</p><p>“The Purple Lightning Blade, a Precious Weapon of the mid-grade worth 4,700 Karma points. It can be exchanged for 2,500 Karma points.”</p><p>“The Golden Stick, a Precious Weapon of a modest grade. The crude handiwork in the crafting of the weapon has reduced its distinction. The weapon is worth 2,800 Karma points, which is exchangeable for 1,500 Karma points.”</p><p>“The Blackwater Thunder, a magical artifact of the Exterior Scenery (the Fifth-fold Heaven). The activation of the artifact corrupts a target with decaying disintegration upon contact and summons a chain of lightning that strikes repeatedly at the target until no flesh or soul is left. The artifact is worth 5,000 Karma points and exchangeable for 2,800 Karma points.”</p><p>“The White Lotus Seat of the Seventh Order, a magical artifact of the Exterior Scenery (the Fifth-fold Heaven). The sacred lotus reveals to its wielder all forms of deception and corruption, protecting the Vital Spirit of its wielder from spiritual and mental assaults. The artifact is valued at 5,200 Karma points and exchangeable for 3,000 Karma points.”</p><p>“The Bhaisajyaguru Relieve Pill, an elixir of healing properties which also reinvigorates the Vital Spirit of its user. Consumption of the elixir heals most injuries in an hour. The elixir is valued at 4,000 Karma points and is exchangeable for 3,000 Karma points.”</p><p>“The Pearl of the Fortune Purple Qi, a magical artifact of the Exterior Scenery (the Second-fold Heaven). The artifact enhances the fortune of its wielder and concentrates the culmination of the aura of fortuitous destiny. The artifact is valued at 2,400 Karma points and is exchangeable for 1,300 Karma points.”</p><p>“The Fortune Heavenly Blade, a Precious Weapon of a modest grade. The blade increases and realizes the fortune of its wielder, allowing itself to be wielded freely by its master. The weapon is valued at 2,600 Karma points and is exchangeable for 1,500 Karma points.”</p><p>Meng Qi finally identified all of his loot apart from the exotic minerals and magical herbs that he kept. His acquiring of the Bhaisaajyaguru Relieve Pill and the two artifacts that belonged to ‘Blessing-endowed Heavenly Official’ Zhou Qiushan was a fortuitous bounty to him indeed!</p><p>The healing potency of the Bhaisajyaguru Relieve Pill dwarfed the Serenity Darkness Pill by a great stretch, a huge addition that might even save lives. The Pearl of Fortune Purple Qi and the Fortune Heavenly Blade are both items that affect the fate and fortune of its wielder, and the properties of both items would surely help since the element of fortune was the very thing that Meng Qi lacked in the cultivation of the discipline of the Tri-gem Wish Fist.</p><p>Additionally, the items themselves could be very valuable to him. The bestowing of fortuitous good blessing would turn the tables for him in times of dire need!</p><p>Meng Qi was wondering which item he should keep when Qu Jiuniang called out,</p><p>“The Master Primogenitor has returned.”</p><p>Meng Qi swept everything into his away hastily, as he could consider the decision another time.</p><p>Meng Qi returned to the Azure Palace where the masked Primogenitor Lingbao awaited and flatly asked, “What is it?”</p><p>Meng Qi glanced at Qu Jiuniang. “Master Primogenitor,” Meng Qi spoke to him telepathically. “Inside please.”</p><p>They entered the sealed room of the Azure Palace and the Primogenitor asked no questions, only looking at Meng Qi and preparing to listen to his reports.</p><p>Whereas Meng Qi had prepared himself for his report to the leader of his order. “Master Primogenitor, I have reasons to believe that the present Abbot Kong Wen of Shaolin Temple is an imposter. He is possibly ‘Evil Master’ Han Guang and perhaps Heaven Sovereign of the Myths in disguise.”</p><p>Primogenitor Lingbao had walked the face of the Earth for no less than two to three hundred years. Through steel and fire, he had endured and witnessed countless trials and tribulations. He made not a single cry of shock nor surprise, save for a still silence that seemed to have frozen everything in the sealed room.</p><p>Moments passed in silence while the Primogenitor mulled over Meng Qi’s revelation. At length, he spoke, “If Master Han Guang is indeed Heaven Sovereign of the Myths, it might not be impossible at all… There have been peculiarities that have been observed about Kong Wen.”</p><p>Meng Qi took a deep breath and fell into an elaborate tale of the truth and presently confined Kong Wen, omitting only the facts of the site of his confinement.</p><p>“I see… You have stumbled upon the presently held Comrade Kong Wen…” muttered Primogenitor Lingbao.</p><p>The Primogenitor avoided from mentioning the facts that Meng Qi had omitted. He tapped on the table as he continued mulling over Meng Qi’s tale, “If we are to assume that it is indeed the true Kong Wen who is presently held… The mysterious Dharmakaya…”</p><p>His fingers halted, pausing as all movements stopped. “I know who is it now,” he said, sighing heavily.</p><p>“Who was it?” Meng Qi asked eagerly.</p><p><em>“Master Primogenitor had deduced his identity!”</em></p><p>“I have felt a certain familiarity with Qu Jiuniang’s description of the stroke that had been felled upon her during her abduction. If I think about it, it should be the Divine Five-colored Palm, the signature technique of Tai Li,” said the Primogenitor.</p><p>“Tai Li? Peacock Demon King?” Meng Qi confirmed with shock.</p><p><em>‘Tai Li, the Monster King who had achieved the True Form of the Five Elements Peacock?’</em></p><p>“I have once had the opportunity to be on the receiving end of the Divine Five-colored Palm during one of my clashes with him. I did not expect that he is now in league with Master Han Guang,” remarked the Primogenitor.</p><p>Instantly, Meng Qi recalled his memory of Zhen Guan, who had turned into a monster, and the monsters sealed beneath the Stupa Tower at the back mountain of the Shaolin Temple. Everything seemed to make sense now!</p><p>……..</p><p>A man stood upright with his hands crossed behind his back. Tall and proud was the poise of the man who has five shades of colors on his hair.</p><p>His back was faced towards his guest. “The lapses of you and your minions have allowed the recovery of Qu Jiuniang,” he said with a lazy smile. “If they have half a brain, the Immortals would have already guessed my identity through the Divine Five-colored Palm technique.”</p><p>“Therefore, we’ll need a change of plans. We’ll reverse all hidden and exposed elements.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
