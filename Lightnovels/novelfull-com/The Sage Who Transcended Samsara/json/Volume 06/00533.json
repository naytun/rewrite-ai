It was as if she was a doll that had just learned how to talk and was still making loads of hilarious mistakes.</p><p>He stared into Jiang Zhiwei’s eyes and said, “Master, although the mechanical treasures are strong, their tricks are however singular, and are limited in ways of usage. This is a clear weakness and it would be pointless even for us to…”</p><p>The doll-like priestess had no emotions shown on her face, and continued mechanically, “Out of the 36 mechanical treasures, there is the Crimson Dragon which specialises in Attack, Rain God which can trigger the natural forces, strange and mysterious ones like The Useless, those good in calculations such as Dragon Horse, and so on. They are all diverse and I believe they can meet your needs.”</p><p><em>Strange and mysterious? Good at calculations? Could they be good at making curses too?</em> Meng Qi tried his best to suppress his rising excitement.</p><p>In these aspects, Meng Qi had just started learning and was far behind his rivals such as the likes of Gu Xiaosang. Even if the Jade Virtual Divination of Heavenly Golden Scripture gave him a huge boost, he still had a weak foundation that needed to be compensated using hard work for a long time. So why not rely on the help of the respective mechanical treasures instead?</p><p>Even if it became useless in the future, he could still sell them or exchange for Karma points!</p><p>Before Meng Qi could open his mouth, Jiang Zhiwei said with a frown, “Looking purely at their value, a ten thousand years old piece of Qinghua Spiritual Wood is worth even less than a mid-tier Precious Weapon. But after the reign of the Demonic Buddha, such wood rarely appears in the market. A senior of my sect has spent ten years in the Eastern Sea looking for one to craft his Wooden Astral Sword.”</p><p>“Since it is so rare, we can’t promise you anything except that we will try our best.”</p><p>Hearing that, the doll-like priestess added on, “If the cost of finding a piece of thousand years old Qinghua Spiritual Wood is more than that of two mechanical treasures, we will make up for the amount.”</p><p><em>Wow, I didn’t realize that Zhiwei is so good at bargaining…</em> Meng Qi had a new and different view of the girl.</p><p>For others, finding Qinghua Spiritual Wood wouldn’t be an easy task. But Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei had Dominator of Samsara of six realms as their backing. They could simply exchange for the object when faced with difficulty. Anyways, the priestess had promised that they wouldn’t make a loss out of this offer!</p><p>In summary, they would try acquiring the object via Six Fan School, Sword Washing Pavilion, and other channels, as well as “claiming” it from the Immortals, before considering the Dominator.</p><p>After finalizing details of the cooperation, the two left Mo Camp and hurried towards the Plenitude Sect.</p><p>…</p><p>White clouds surrounded the mountain peaks as cranes fluttered about. Endangered beasts roamed and strange flowers blossomed everywhere, providing it with a sense of the mystic. Other than the Azure Palace, this was the place that Meng Qi deemed the most suitable for fairies to live in.</p><p>As they entered the hall, they saw Immortal Yunhe. He had pure white hair but a childlike face that was red with vitality. With his back straightened, he didn’t seem old at all. Two young Taoists around twenty years of age stood next to him. The male Taoist was tall and thin, with distinctive facial features and thick brows. He wore a thin cloak that covered his entire body. The female Taoist was pretty and adorable and had skin as smooth and as white as white tiles.</p><p>“Young friends, I have waited for long.” Immortal Yunhe smiled. He didn’t have any feelings of seniority and seemed a lot more mundane compared to when they last met.</p><p><em>Did he purposely shock us with his breath last time?</em> Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei thought as they bowed.</p><p>Immortal Yunhe pointed at the two Taoists and explained, “They are my most outstanding disciples of this generation, having harnessed the power of Heaven and Earth and created True Charms at mere twenty years old. Erm, it is hard to compare accurately with all of you as we are on different paths of cultivation. Anyways, they are not as powerful as the Exterior masters yet. His Taoist name is Ming Xu and hers is Ming Guang. They will follow the two of you this time to see the world, as well as to send some letters to River East.”</p><p>Ming Xu and Ming Guang cupped their hands and bowed, curiosity alight in their eyes.</p><p>Out of the Grotto and behind the door of the Plenitude Sect laid a world that they had never experienced before. It was truly mysterious and attractive!</p><p>The same was true for impartation of Ancient Qi Cultivists!</p><p>As they were talking, Immortal Yunhe took out a bunch of items. Holding on to a list, he said, “The list includes all the exotic minerals and produce, self-made charms, elixirs and other items that our sect provides. Please take care.”</p><p>There were not many items as it was, after all, their first cooperation. Even though Immortal Yunhe had shocked Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei using the God Charm, he was still concerned about their powerful seniors outside embezzling the goods. Thus, he preferred to take it slowly and form a solid relationship through early cooperations first.</p><p>The items were mainly charms and elixirs, with many life-prolonging objects that were highly sought after by Exterior Masters. Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei verified the list carefully and placed the objects into their Space Rings respectively.</p><p>After all that, Immortal Yunhe took out two jade boxes. “A little gift from the sect, my dear friends.”</p><p>Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei received the boxes and opened them. Two dark yellow charms with scripts written all over it laid inside each. There was no breath exposed, making it mysterious in nature.</p><p>“These are Protective Dark Yellow Charms, which can prevent disaster once. It is equivalent to the level of fifth or sixth fold Heaven in the Exterior,” Immortal Yunho said after some hesitation. He then smiled at the two and continued, “If our cooperation is successful, I would write charms for you both personally.”</p><p><em>Such bribery… But I can’t refuse it!</em> Meng Qi said firmly, “Please do not be worried, I will go through fire and water, in order to complete the task at all costs!”</p><p>Immortal Yunhe used his rainbow glow to send Meng Qi, Jiang Zhiwei, and the two disciples to Mount Firemist, where Meng Qi used his seal to remove the cover of The Plenitude Gate.</p><p><em>Familiar door but unfamiliar breath…</em> Immortal Yunho sighed as he was lost in his train of thoughts.</p><p><em>Indeed, it wasn’t the outside world that was dangerous. The danger lies right behind the door!</em></p><p>……</p><p>It was still a sealed room. There was nothing outside the Plenitude Gate.</p><p>Ming Xu and Ming Guang stepped out of the door and glanced around excitedly, much like two newborn birds seeing the world for the first time.</p><p>Meng Qi closed the door, barely squeezing it into his space ring. He then called out for the two Taoist to leave the sealed room silently with Jiang Zhiwei.</p><p>The streets were crowded with people, many of which dressed up as desert ramps. They were selling all types of specialties of Immensity Sea, and precious stones of all colors were present. Ming Xu and Ming Guang couldn’t take their eyes off these exciting new items.</p><p>But Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei stared at each other, sharing the same suspicion.</p><p>The atmosphere of Fish Sea didn’t seem right!</p><p>The whole Fish Sea was like the sea surface before a thunderstorm. It seemed calm but had its anger suppressed. Experts of the Exterior flew over the city from time to time. Some had dirks attached to their belt, with ice crystals or snowflakes attached to the back of their hand, while some wore frocks different from that of the Central Plains.</p><p>“So many Divine Masters here…” Ming Xu and Ming Guang looked up at the sky, gaping in shock.</p><p>What exactly happened?</p><p>Under caution, Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei did choose not to leave but instead moved to the short mud house nearby called Old Cao’s Restaurant. Here they found Drunk Xie with his hair disheveled and tangled.</p><p>Drunk Xie remained unkempt and intoxicated, but Meng Qi knew that he was definitely a regular member of the Immortals. Thus, he threw out a precious stone and directly asked, “What month is it now? What happened to the Fish Sea?”</p><p>Drunk Xie used his face to wipe against the tabletop, completely wasting his handsome appearance. He then stood up shakily and answered, “March of the Spring of the Year of the New Emperor of Great Jin Dynasty.”</p><p><em>Which is to say that the time velocity inside the cave and outside the cave is relatively similar…</em> Meng Qi first confirmed this.</p><p>Drunk Xie then looked around and took another sip of wine. “As for the matter at the Fish Sea, anyone on the street could have told you.”</p><p>He then explained slowly, “Two months ago, Book of Luo from the Wang family of River East suddenly shone so bright that it could be seen from hundreds of miles away. Furthermore, from Fish Sea to Tan Han, Buddha’s light kept appearing inexplicably.”</p><p>“After half a month of calculation, the Master of the Wang family, Ledgerkeeper of Lives Wang Siyuan, and many other experts of the Exterior finally confirmed the reason.”</p><p>“Within half a year, Primary Instruction of The Buddha’s Palm will appear at the Fish Sea and Tan Han region.”</p><p>“Primary Instruction of The Buddha’s Palm?!” Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei looked at each other, finding it difficult to believe what they heard.</p><p>This was not due to shock, as Meng Qi had already obtained the first move himself. Still, they were surprised by the sudden news.</p><p>“Why would everyone know about it?” It would be inaccurate to say that Meng Qi was not greedy about the Primary Instruction, but he was more curious about how the matter came out to the general public.</p><p>Drunk Xie burped and explained, “Who knew what the Wang Family was thinking? They publicized their findings immediately. As many Exterior experts came this way, the speed of news transmission naturally increased.”</p><p>Hearing Drunk Xie’s explanation, four words appeared in Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei’s mind.</p><p>“The battle of Dharmas!”</p><p>Drunk Xie laid down as he spoke, seemingly having guessed what the two were thinking about. “No Dharmakaya had arrived yet. You can’t always believe in what the Wang family says, can you?”</p><p>“Exterior masters from all the influential forces were probing for the truth, like the Snow Mountain Sect, Jin Gang Temple, Merriment Temple and Ashura Temple. When the Palm appears, hehe…”</p><p>Ming Guang and Ming Xu couldn’t comprehend the situation and could only follow the solemn Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei into the streets.</p><p>“I’m not going after the Primary Instruction.” Meng Qi spoke suddenly, severing all greed in his heart.</p><p>“Since the matter is well known to everyone, it will eventually become a battle between the Dharmakayas. What can I depend on if I fight with them? My luck? Or my character?”</p><p>One must have self-awareness.</p><p>“Me too.” Jiang Zhiwei didn’t hesitate.</p><p>Meng Qi continued, “I decide to send the two Taoists to Jade Gate Pass first, and return with a new face. The Myths will definitely be involved in this matter and I can settle my grudge with the Thunder God From the Ninth Heaven then.”</p><p>“The Immortals will definitely be here too. If I could aid them in obtaining the Primary Instructions, I could find realization myself as well.”</p><p>“Many experts of the Exterior realm are present here. How do we leave?” After Jiang Zhiwei entered the Exterior realm, she had not truly entered a battle except for Singular Missions. There was a fire burning in her eyes.</p><p>As they were talking, the four entered a bustling street, where a lot more from the Central Plains were present. In front of them came four small sedan chairs.</p><p>As he passed the green sedan chair, Meng Qi suddenly shivered. He felt his surroundings collapse into a void, as an invisible karma line connected himself with the person in the sedan chair.</p><p>“Bad Karma?”</p><p>Run!</p><p>If not for the fact that his whole-body was imbued with Karma Fruit, and that he had cultivated the force of Karma, Meng Qi couldn’t have realized this. He could only feel the two thoughts popping out of his head when a strong breath encompassed his body, locking his movements, making it impossible even to transform!</p><p>The sedan chair stopped and the curtain was lifted. A slender and delicate white boot stepped out, then the elegant and plain white dress emerged.</p><p>“Such beauty…” Even though they had seen the gorgeous Jiang Zhiwei, Ming Xu and Ming Guang were still stunned by the looks of this woman, as if they had just seen a fairy descending from heaven.</p><p>The woman was as elegant as a fairy, with an ethereal temperament and a spotless white body, causing all those around to feel insecure about their looks.</p><p>“I searched high and low for you, but you were just around the corner. Fate made us meet at Fish Sea, and for such fate, we should all manifest ourselves.” the woman said lightly, as all around seemed to fade away, with dust flying away from her.</p><p>Meng Qi held his sword with his right hand and straightened his back. He squinted, having guessed the identity of the woman.</p><p>Mystic Fairy of this generation!</p><p>But it was unknown if it was herself or a Nirmanakaya!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
