Therefore, he was not surprised at the result nor did he become too emotional. Despite the shock, he was mainly puzzled.</p><p>After the Netherworld got out of the trap, and he died somewhere because his lifespan was over or possibly another reason. Did a Life-changing Sect disciple find his corpse?</p><p>Did the Life-changing Sect inherit his orthodoxy?</p><p>The big power’s skeletal hand was very valuable. The Overlord had refined a peerless machete using the Thunder God body and the ancient pool of thunder. Even though the Netherworld was second to the Thunder God, and although there was only a skeletal hand without the ancient pool of thunder, one could refine a divine weapon with the skeletal hand. But after Old Zhong stole it, why did the Life-changing Sect still send a group of an enlightened Disciple and an Exterior Zombie?</p><p>It could be interpreted as the human resource distribution. But after Old Zhong had escaped, why didn’t the Life-changing Sect disciples report it? Did the Dongyang Villa lack capable masters at the moment?</p><p>Did the Life-changing Sect disciples not know it was the Netherworld’s skeletal hand? Or did they consider it valuable for some reason but not take it too seriously?</p><p>What Meng Qi could not figure out at all was the disappearance of the skeletal hand’s strength. Moreover, 8,000 Karma points was far too much for him to pay.</p><p>For an instant, a few ideas flashed through his mind. For example, he could sell the Devil-rinsing Flag to Primogenitor Lingbao or to the organization The Immortals. The Immortals organization would try every means to pool enough Karma points to restore it, and every member paid a certain price when using it. In that case, Meng Qi could gain a lot of Karma points, and The Immortals organization could avoid certain tasks. Additionally, Meng Qi could borrow the flag when he had to get rid of the Zhenwu’s evil spirits or had a Death Task.</p><p>Of course, there was a drawback. Since he could not carry it around, Meng Qi would not be able to utilize it if emergencies happened.</p><p>Or, he could share the Netherworld’s skeletal hand with The Immortals organization. A few members collaborated to solve the puzzle and shared the future outcomes. If they should refine a divine weapon, they would use it in turn.</p><p>Thoughts flashed in his mind quickly. Meng Qi mentally asked Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms if his ideas were feasible.</p><p>Having seen so many of his profiting actions, Meng Qi tended to see him as a highly intelligent creature, rather than a mechanical program. Meng Qi wouldn’t want to take a advantage, he would always ask first.</p><p>The nonchalant voice of the Dominator of Samsara in the Six Realms rang inside Meng Qi’s mind.</p><p>“Trading or borrowing a Dharmakaya item requires following the basic rules of the task even among different groups.</p><p>“If both Samsara travelers and non-Samsara travelers are implicated, the rule is no longer applicable. After a few rounds of handing over, when the item again falls into the hand of another Samsara traveler, it’ll be judged as a direct trade based on the traveler’s intention.</p><p>“The value of the Netherworld’s skeletal hand is unclear now. It can be shared among, at most, five random people. Who will be considered a temporary team.”</p><p>Meng Qi felt lucky that he asked. If he borrowed the Devil-rinsing Flag and had a specific task, to get rid of the Zhenwu’s evil spirits, it would be difficult to do so.</p><p>The restrictions were beneficial in some ways. At least if he was ambushed by The Myths members, he wouldn’t be killed defenselessly only because they had borrowed some divine or Dharmakaya weapons from the Heaven Sovereign or another senior teammate.</p><p>Meng Qi would drop the Devil-rinsing Flag thing for now. As one of the top ancient big powers, Zhenwu’s evil spirits probably could only be killed by a particular item. Even he could acquire another divine weapon in the future; the weapon might not equal the Devil-rinsing Flag. After further thinking, he left his mental mark and breath on the flag and stored it in the Space Ring.</p><p>As for the Netherworld’s skeletal hand, he would rather share it with his teammates than The Immortals members. After the apotheosis mission, it wouldn’t be difficult for five people to raise 8,000 Karma points.</p><p>After storing the skeletal hand and collecting his thoughts, Meng Qi evaluated the two secret treasures he got from Ze Luoju as well. He wanted to know their functions and make a decision on if he should sell them or keep them.</p><p>The Devil-summoning Stone, Exterior level secret treasure (Mid Grade). It can release fatal evil ghosts at the ordinary Exterior Four-fold Heaven. If the owner lacks strength and the evil ghosts do not disappear after the enemy is killed, the treasure will countercharge. It’s worth 3,500 Karma points and can be exchanged for 2,000 Karma points.</p><p>The Nine Zen Beads, an Exterior secret treasure (Low Grade). It was refined out of a pagoda tree demon in front of a one-thousand-year-old temple. Since it died under a thunder calamity, it’s only at the Third Heaven of the Exterior level. Nine beads represent nine zen thoughts, and only one remains available, which is the ‘Protective Glazing Light’ bead. The bead is worth 2,000 Karma points and can be exchanged for 1,200 Karma points.”</p><p>Meng Qi hesitated. The Devil-summoning Stone was a Peerless Master Pro level secret treasure that he lacked, but the countercharging feature was just disgusting. It was tasteless but it would be too wasteful to discard it. He could keep the Nine Zen Beads and when at a critical moment; he could use it to ward off some of the power. In that way, his Eight Nine Mysteries would probably stop a death calamity.</p><p>“Why are you looking at me?” ‘Bluecloud Progenitor’ Qu Jiuniang was observing the exotic minerals and produce and Asoka Blossoms in front of Minghe. Suddenly, she felt a gaze from someone else. A keen gaze like her own present one.</p><p>Meng Qi was masked as Heavenly Primogenitor and could not show his sunny smile. He could only laugh. “Bluecloud Progenitor, I want to give you something.”</p><p>A dark green stone lay in his palm—a face appeared on the stone, vicious, hideous and twisted.</p><p>“You even got a secret treasure!” Bluecloud Progenitor said with bitter hatred. She regretted that she hadn’t gathered Drunk Xie and others to assassinate Ze Luoju earlier. Why should she fear the Crying Elder’s vengeance?</p><p>After grieving, she quickly pulled herself together to request an evaluation. After which she spoke in a very professional manner, “It countercharges and isn’t that valuable. I’ll give you 2,200 at most.”</p><p><em>“Why don’t you just rob me?”</em> Meng Qi thought to himself. He shook his head. “You have passed the First Celestial Ladder, why do you fear the evil ghosts countercharge? You can have this for 3,200 Karma points.”</p><p>“Exactly, since I’ve passed the First Celestial Ladder, this kind of secret treasure doesn’t mean much to me. I can save more Karma points for a better one. I’ll give you 2,400 Karma points, final price.”</p><p>Meng Qi laughed. “There are evil ghosts trapped inside, you can use them as capable helpers right now. They can fight, detect, possess, and curse. How can an ordinary attacking or defensive secret treasure compare with that? I’ll have 3,000 Karma points at least.”</p><p>“But it’s disposable. I’ll be kind and offer you 2,600 Karma points.” Qu Jiuniang replied in a scornful tone.</p><p>“Well, forget it. Anything less than 2,800 Karma points and I might as well take the risk and use it myself.” Meng Qi drew back his hand.</p><p>Qu Jiuniang stepped forward. “Alright, let’s settle at 2,800 Karma points.”</p><p>Meng Qi grinned and finished the deal.</p><p>Then, he put Ze Luoju’s long saber, a few nearly new exotic minerals and produce, and a bunch of the Asoka Blossoms into the central jade column.</p><p>Wraith-binding Demonic Saber, Precious Weapon (Low Grade). It’s an evil spirit-trapping saber that’s made out of the Netherworld Iron and other materials. It was originally Mid Grade but it had been struck by the Grand Sun true flame and the divine punishment Green Thunder. This caused it’s degradation and can be recovered by 100 more premium spirits, or 1,200 Karma points. It’s now worth 2,300 Karma points and can be exchanged for 1,500 Karma points.</p><p>The Essence of the Golden Sand an exotic mineral and produce. It can be used to refine the Golden Sand type Divine Skill or similar Precious Weapons. It’s worth 1,400 Karma points and can be exchanged for 800 Karma points.</p><p>…</p><p>A half-made Space Strip at the Refined Weapon level item (Exquisite). It can only shrink things. It’s worth 800 Karma points and can be exchanged for 80 Karma points.</p><p>The Asoka Blossom, watered by the rare Nether Water. It can be used to refine the carefree elixir. An Exterior can drink it and forget his former reincarnation.</p><p>However being suppressed by the Devil-rinsing red mist, it’ll wither with the time passing. It can’t be preserved for long, thus not enough for refining the carefree elixir. It’s merely a Refined Weapon level article. One is worth 900 Karma points and can be exchanged for 90 Karma points. There are 59 in total.</p><p>Meng Qi was stunned, what would it have been like if he had earned Asoka Blossoms before becoming an Exterior…</p><p>He suddenly turned to Qu Jiuniang. “Bluecloud Progenitor, can I sell Refined Weapon level articles to groups that want to enlighten the Apertures.”</p><p>Bluecloud Progenitor said in a tone that indicated that she had been there and done that. “Even if you sell it to them at 500 Karma points, you’ll only get 50 Karma points in the end. The Six Realms will take all the Karma points!”</p><p><em>“Well, one should not be too greedy…”</em> Meng Qi exchanged all of these things. Adding the Karma points the Devil-summoning Stone was exchanged for, and his remaining Karma points, he had 12,645 Karma points in total.</p><p>Looking at the whole bunch of Karma points Meng Qi was getting, Qu Jiuniang felt sad and almost wanted to snatch them all. Even someone as capable as she had not earned more than 10,000 Karma points at a time!</p><p><em>“What else to exchange…”</em> Meng Qi reached out his hand to the Space Ring as he thought about another item.</p><p>“What… what else?” Qu Jiuniang was stumbling over her words.</p><p>What he took out were the brass keys of Ze Luoju and An Guoxie and the strange token that was made neither from gold, stone, wood, nor silk.</p><p>A warehouse key, the specific address requires 200 Karma points.</p><p>A courtyard key, the specific address requires 200 Karma points.</p><p>…</p><p>Other than the key that was the same with Ze Luoju’s, all of An Guoxie’s keys bore the same evaluation results. Meng Qi thought for a moment and did not ask the specific address, because there might be items like Refined Weapons in An Guoxie’s collections, or there might not be such items. He was not a gambling person and it was unnecessary to spend the Karma points. Because of this, he had never tried before as well.</p><p>A secret courtyard key, the specific address requires 500 Karma points.</p><p>An opening token to some item, more detailed information requires 1,000 Karma points.</p><p>Meng Qi counted and there were 1,500 Karma points in total. He thought that the item might be more valuable than this. Due to this, he considered further for another moment and then turned to Qu Jiuniang again smiling. “Bluecloud Progenitor, these keys are from An Guoxie. Every key opens one of his treasure-hiding spots. He’s been a well-known Lone Robber in the Immensity Sea and must have had many treasures. Though it doesn’t fit with your realm, you may possibly gain a lot of Karma points. Any interest in taking a trip?”</p><p>Bluecloud Progenitor hesitated for a moment. “I’ll give you 800 Karma points, no more.”</p><p>“Deal.” Meng Qi decisively accepted.</p><p>Qu Jiuniang regretted as she realized she could’ve offered 600 Karma points instead!</p><p>With Qu Jiuniang offering the most of the Karma points, Meng Qi chose to redeem the following item.</p><p>The opening token to…</p><p>… the Plenitude Gate in the Guangling Street of the Fish Sea.</p><p><em>“The Plenitude Gate? What a high-end, elegant and classy name!”</em> Meng Qi was stunned.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
