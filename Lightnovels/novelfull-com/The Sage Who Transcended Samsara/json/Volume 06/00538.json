He looked toward the west and lamented, saying, “Amitabha. There’s another beam of Buddha Aura in Tan Han. The impartation of Siddhartha Gautama must not be allowed to fall into the hands of evil. I have no choice but to immerse myself in worldly affairs.”</p><p>There was a faint golden glow to his face as he exuded a variety of understated breaths. Looking around as if nothing was out of ordinary, he said, “Wu Si, please invite Junior Brother Kong Hui to enter the stupa in the back mountain and guard Blade of Ananda.”</p><p>Though he had ordered for Kong Hui to guard the blade, it was in fact to have the latter, who oversaw the Sutras Depository, to take control of the divine weapon and suppress the sect.</p><p>Wu Si was the President of Bodhi Yard. With all his hair and beard falling off, he resembled a dead tree. “Master, the Primary Instruction of Buddha’s Palm is of great importance and must be treated as such. I implore you to take up the divine weapon lest we give Prime Asuras any opportunities.”</p><p>Kong Wen shook his head with a smile. “It’s my fate if it doesn’t fall into my hands and I accept it. I won’t allow the sect to fall into danger for this. The intentions of the Wang family are hard to decipher. We must be careful.”</p><p>During their conversation, he appeared to exude quite the confidence of winning the upcoming battle over the Primary Instruction of Buddha’s Palm. He was indeed worthy of his third rank on the Celestial Rankings and reputation as a strong master who had once sealed or killed a Dharmakaya!</p><p>“Amitabha. I accept your will, Master.” Wu Si did not try to persuade Kong Wen any longer seeing that he had made up his mind.</p><p>In a quiet voice, Kong Wen added, “It’s pointless to have too many people involved in this matter. Junior Brother Kong Jian and Nephew Wu Jing, please join me on this journey.”</p><p>He had only named two people but that was about 20 percent of the high-level combat power of Shaolin Temple!</p><p>Putting aside a Dharmakaya like Kong Wen, Shaolin Temple could be ranked within the top three of the world’s top forces in terms of the numbers of grandmasters they had. Outsiders estimated that they had at least seven!</p><p>The common people were only familiar with six out of the seven grandmasters of Shaolin Temple: Kang Hui of the Sutras Depository; Kong Jian, President of Dharma Yard; Wu Si, President of Bodhi Yard; Wu Jing, President of Commandment Yard; Wu Wang, an Elder of Dharma Yard; Xuan Bei, an elder of Bodhi Yard. They suspected the final one to be a senior monk who had isolated himself in Stark Mediation, Kong Zi.</p><p>Kong Jian, on the other hand, was at the peak of the Exterior realm, while Wu Jing had achieved the N-fold Heaven and was superior to ordinary grandmasters. Kong Wen was evidently going for quality over quantity!</p><p>“Amitabha. Uncle Master Wu Jing is the President of the Commandment Yard, responsible for the tranquilness of our temple, thus it is his duty to stay in the temple. Please allow me to accompany you.” Xuan Bei stood up.</p><p>He took the initiative to ask as he, like Kong Wen, was a disciple who had received direct impartation.</p><p>His logic was sound. It was obvious that Wu Jing, being the President of the Commandment Yard, should stay in the temple unless there really was no one else that could be dispatched.</p><p>Kong Wen made a little wave with his hand. “You didn’t achieve Hidden Latch of No Regrets and have an unsteady foundation. You need to go into retreat for some more time and look for the crucial point of the rebirth of nirvana. Don’t you worry about assisting Junior Brother Kong Hui to help me. Besides, the other Presidents and Elders are no match for Nephew Wu Jing anyway. Hehe. Commandments lie in the heart, not in the person. Whether or not there is a President matters little.”</p><p>He rejected Xuan Bei succinctly, leaving the latter with no choice but to accept it.</p><p>“There’s still some time before the birth of Buddha’s Palm. Let’s make our journey over a slow one and alter our strategies based on what we observe. That way, we won’t be dancing on someone else’s palm.”</p><p>…</p><p>Inside a deeply sinister tomb that reeked of death.</p><p>There was a man, surrounded by swirling bloody-yellow fog of death, standing deferentially in front of an enormous bier.</p><p>The bier was nearly two-feet long and one-feet wide. It was of a deep black hue and appeared incredibly solemn. On its surface were carvings of the Netherworld as well as the Nine Serenities.</p><p>There were old and mottled lamps emitting green light placed at the two ends of the bier, its green and sultry light like that of beans.</p><p>“Lord, the target has made his move,” the man shrouded in the bloody-yellow fog of death said respectfully.</p><p>From the bier came an indifferent and dull yet dignified voice. “Follow the plan.”</p><p>Underlying his voice seemed to be the sound of running water.</p><p>…</p><p>What appeared to be faint exhaustion seemed to dance between Amour Monk’s brows, arousing both curiosity and pity in those who looked at him. It gave him quite the distinct charm.</p><p>His gaze swept past Jiang Zhiwei’s grip on her sword. In his exhaustion, he smiled sincerely and said, “Your hand is fair and powerful; strong despite its delicateness. Observing one’s hands is akin to observing the person itself, and Lady, you’re no different. Why don’t you join me in indulging in the joys of the world and meditates in the realm of bliss in order to comprehend the supreme way of Buddhism?”</p><p>His quiet, low voice was full of magnetism. He continued to speak, drawing those who were listening into a hot spring that brought endless comfort and relaxation. Jiang Zhiwei found that even her thoughts had become somewhat murky.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei was not exempted from such feelings but she instantly regained consciousness. Compared to Mystic Fairy’s Mundane World Immortal Realm, his was still far too weak!</p><p>When Amour Monk saw the blank expression on Jiang Zhiwei’s face as she stayed suspended in the air, he thought that he had succeeded in luring her with his divine dhyana voice. His smile widened and he flew over to her, saying, “Men and women are differentiated by their own innate talents…”</p><p>Xue Lengzhao was frozen after seeing Amour Monk, as if she was caught under a petrification spell. She shuddered violently as all strength left her, not even giving her the chance to walk away. Suddenly, she heard his demonic voice and saw Jiang Zhiwei looking stunned. She could not stop herself from opening her mouth and tried to wake Jiang Zhiwei but Armor Monk seemed to have predicted this and shot her a glance.</p><p>His gaze was indifferent and the corner of his mouth was raised into a faint smile. Xue Lengzhao instantly lost the strength to talk. It was like he was her ruler, the ruler of her pain and joy, that she could not and did not want to fight against.</p><p>It was a deep and piercing trauma that she could not walk out of no matter how hard she tried!</p><p>Suddenly, a burst of sword light lit up their surroundings. The sky turned completely dusky as if all the light in this world was being drawn to the sword light. There was nothing but the sword light in heaven and earth; without it, there was no world at all.</p><p>Even as ordinary Sword Qi crisscrossed in the air, no one could sense the abnormality in the Sword Qi all around!</p><p>There was only pureness and brilliance in the sword light. Before the sword even reached, its intention had already arrived in his face.</p><p>Amour Monk felt a piercing pain between his brows that sent his Vital Spirit into a frightful fit. Even the act of raising his hand became slow and sluggish. He could only watch the sword light charge at him without being able to do anything.</p><p><em>“I’ve fallen into her trap!”</em></p><p><em>“Anatta Sword!”</em></p><p>No longer in the position to worry about anything else, he opened all the Aperture acupoints in his body. A glaze-like light dotted with specks of pink emerged and behind him stood a malevolent-looking golden Buddha statue.</p><p>The statue, with its open hands wrapped around a woman, was so vivid that it was close to being tangible.</p><p>The woman, with skin so translucent that was even better than snow, was naked from head to toe. Her voluptuous figure was punctuated by curves. She was so beautiful that the mere sight of her was enough to send one’s blood boiling; however, she was like a constantly changing mirage as she sat upon the Buddha’s lap, her body facing the Buddha in a copulating position.</p><p>Only women of sufficient class, as well as those who Amour Monk had not sucked dry, would be able to see her so vividly. From this, he would interweave with the Dharmas and Logos and crossed the second step of the Celestial Ladder.</p><p>The Buddha statue instantly opened its clear eyes upon its appearance and changed its copulation position with the woman, its two hands folded behind the woman’s back.</p><p>Bliss and lust were for and reduced into nothingness; all the copulation was nothingness itself!</p><p>Amour Monk raised both his palms, put them together, and thrust them forward.</p><p>Everything in the world was but an empty illusion. Just as the pure sword light disappeared, Amour Monk pinched Jiang Zhiwei’s sword right between his palms.</p><p>Sizzle, sizzle, sizzle. The sword light surged, leaving sword marks all over the palms of the Buddha statue. Amour Monk threw his sword, allowing him to avoid Jiang Zhiwei’s follow-up attacks.</p><p>Though his realm was superior, he was still at a disadvantage against Jiang Zhiwei’s Anatta Sword, which had been storing power for a long time.</p><p><em>“It’s her!”</em></p><p><em>“Fairy of the Extinctive Sword!”</em></p><p>Amour Monk’s fury turned into a fiery lust that ignited joyful genuine Qi as he recalled the rumors that claimed that the Fairy was beautiful beyond comparison and incredibly strong.</p><p>The others were not lucky enough to gain this ‘harvest’ like he did and left for the location of the Buddha Aura. It would be some time before they would return. There were no masters left in this place to stop him!</p><p>Su Wuming was indeed fearsome but he had nothing to fear. After all, the strong forces of Snow Mountain Sect hunted him all year around. He was not a Dharmakaya who could partition the sky to pass through the void. What was there for Amour Monk to fear?</p><p>If thing really went awry after he succeeded, he could just hide in Immensity Sea or God-burying Sea. There was no way Su Wuming could perpetually wait for him at both places until the end of time.</p><p>This was the difference in the way those who walked the Nine Evil Paths and aristocratic families, as well as the imperial court, acted. They were even more audacious in flouting the rules of the world – even more unscrupulous and unbridled!</p><p>However, it was evident that the fiery desire had clouded Amour Monk’s mind. Otherwise, his Abbotship of Merriment Temple would never deliberately provoke those who had the potential to achieve Dharmakayas like Su Wuming!</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei did not manage to succeed in her sword strike and made another fierce attack without hesitation. Her sword light rose high above to unleash Hitting the Sea. The swordwill took up all the space in all four directions and the airflow separated. Her attack seemed impossible to resist!</p><p>The golden Buddha statue behind Amour Monk changed its posture once again and slammed its palm on Amour Monk’s back, triggering him to thrust his right hand.</p><p>This dull, unremarkable palm incited no changes in their surroundings. The only difference was that genuine Qi had morphed into the same golden hand as the palm in front of it. But, while the Qi was changing like a swimming fish, it harbored a certain indescribable strangeness. In the time that it took to inhale, it penetrated Jiang Zhiwei’s sword momentum and slammed on her chest.</p><p>It was a palm capable of penetrating everything!</p><p>The famous supreme art of Merriment Temple!</p><p>Amour Monk was even more delighted to see that he had succeeded in just one strike. The momentum of his palm transformed endlessly in a fascinating pattern, leaving no space for Jiang Zhiwei to defend herself nor bring him down with her.</p><p>Suddenly, Jiang Zhiwei’s sword light diffracted and inexplicably traveled downward, as if cutting off something.</p><p>The palm that carried a heavy momentum disappeared, all its changes disappeared to reveal a golden hand. The hand, ordinary and devoid of any gaudiness, continued to thrust forward; however, Jiang Zhiwei’s sword naturally blocked it.</p><p>Clang! The force sent Jiang Zhiwei and Amour Monk flying at the same time.</p><p><em>“How can she block my palm that easily?”</em> Amour Monk was deeply shocked. Then a lightbulb went off in his head as he recalled something else.</p><p><em>“Cessation of Future, one of the nine major killing techniques of Swordplay Sutra of Supremacy!”</em></p><p>Cutting Tao And Seeking True-self – the inexistence of oneself, others, future, past, and present. The nine major killing techniques were derived from this!</p><p>The use of this sword technique instantly put an end to all different changes in Amour Monk’s palm, robbing it of its future!</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei had used what was meant for an offense as a way to defend herself, yet had done so brilliantly and appropriately.</p><p>“How did she manage to master the second style of a Dharmakaya sword technique when she has only just recently broken through to the Exterior realm?” It was only now that Amour Monk was given a taste of just how talented Jiang Zhiwei truly was in sword arts, yet when he thought of dominating such a remarkable lady, his fiery lust burned even fiercer.</p><p><em>“It’s fine even if you halt all changes of my palm and rob it of its future! I’ll just meet you head-on with my strength and suppress you with my superior realm!”</em></p><p>The golden Buddha statue behind him began muttering a string of low-pitched words. Lotus flowers began blossoming in the air out of nowhere. Amour Monk lifted his right palm and once again sent it flying at Jiang Zhiwei. This time, there were not many changes in the palm but its strength was so powerful that it felt as if the void around them was shaking.</p><p>Strength of Merry Buddha’s Original Vows!</p><p>Clang! Jiang Zhiwei once again used Cessation of Future to parry his palm but the force had evidently injured her internal organs. Blood was oozing out of her nose and mouth.</p><p>…</p><p>Having nailed down all the details with Immortal Yunhe, Meng Qi estimated the time he had spent here and walked to the front of the gate. When he pushed the door, he realized that it was not budging at all.</p><p>This was the time that they had both agreed for Jiang Zhiwei to take out the Plenitude Gate out of the Space Ring!</p><p><em>“Did an unforeseen event occur outside?”</em></p><p>Meng Qi’s heart stirred. He glanced at Immortal Yunhe and opened all the Aperture acupoints in his body. His Golden Crow started moving and the stars, Grand Sun, as well as the rest of the illusory elements materialized from within him before returning to the Celestial. The Celestial returned to the past, solidifying into the Chaos.</p><p>Naturally, he had used the identity of Su Meng in his meeting with Immortal Yunhe!</p><p>…</p><p>Clang, clang, clang!</p><p>The sound of the palm colliding with the sword resounded through the air, the force throwing Jiang Zhiwei flying backward again and again. Blood was oozing out of her Seven Apertures. She struggled incredibly against the strength of Amour Monk’s Dharma Form and his palm that had little support of Dharmas and Logos.</p><p>Impatient to get his hands on Jiang Zhiwei as well as worried that the Peerless Master Pros of Sword Washing Pavilion would return, Amour Monk relayed his voice soundlessly to Xue Lengzhao. “My dear Zhao, what are you doing? Won’t you come and give me a hand?”</p><p>Xue Lengzhao shuddered and subconsciously shook her head before pointing her sword at him.</p><p>While Amour Monk was using Strength of Merry Buddha’s Original Vows to bombard Jiang Zhiwei, he unleashed his mental energy to sweep past Xue Lengzhao.</p><p>Xue Lengzhao instantly felt her entire body go limp and numb and her brain scrambled. Looking into the monotonous, apathetic eyes of Amour Monk, she lost all will to resist him. The memories flashed in her mind, all the joys and pains of the past. She turned around and was about to strike Jiang Zhiwei.</p><p>Seeing this turn of events, Jiang Zhiwei no longer tried to force herself to finish the battle on her own. She withdrew an item from her Space Ring and threw it in Amour Monk’s face.</p><p>“I’m right! She does have a secret treasure!” Amour Monk had been on alert for a long time. His Buddha’s Meditation Chant became increasingly lascivious as specks of light swirled around them. His arm bulged to become incredibly thick and coarse and swatted the item away with a monstrous and unyielding force!</p><p>The item was rectangular-shaped and engraved with many different patterns. <em>“I-It’s a gate?”</em></p><p>Even though he was a well-informed person, he had never seen anyone use a gate as a secret treasure!</p><p><em>“Is it used for defensive purposes?”</em></p><p>Thump! The palm of the golden Buddha statue alongside with that of Amour Monk slammed into the gate.</p><p>The doors opened with a creak. Amour Monk’s palm felt nothingness before the gate disappeared without a trace!</p><p>Just then, rays of sword radiance broke the darkness and cleaved through the Chaos. It shattered everything and brought about the birth of heaven and earth!</p><p><em>“What a terrifying blade!”</em></p><p>Just as he was waiting to operate the Dharma Form of Merry Buddha, he realized that was weighed down by what seemed like shackles. He found himself incapable of moving at all.</p><p><em>“How could this be?”</em></p><p><em>“Impossible!”</em></p><p>The saber radiance spilled on Amour Monk’s body, shrouding him from head to toe. There was no way for him to resist the layers of gleaming light. His rounded eyes were wide open as he struggled to believe that there could be such a turn in events!</p><p>Thud! Two pieces of a corpse, gushing with blood, fell to the ground.</p><p>Xue Lengzhao remained rooted in where she was standing, stunned as she stared at the body of Amour Monk, which had been cleaved in half. Everything felt like a dream.</p><p>This was the evil spirit that had made it impossible for her to rid of its influence and made her feel like she did not want to. Did he die just like that?</p><p>Did the terrifying evil spirit that had thrown her in the abyss of trauma and nightmares die just like that?</p><p><em>“It’s a painful death, not at all brilliant…”</em></p><p>She lifted her head and saw a saber entwined with green Thunder Lights. The specks of blood that tainted its blade instantly turned charred and scattered.</p><p>When she looked up even further up, she saw a handsome, masculine young man still fixed in his position. Rubbing his chin, he looked at the corpse underneath with unclosed eyes in confusion and spoke the woman next to him.</p><p>“Who was this monk? He seemed pretty strong.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
