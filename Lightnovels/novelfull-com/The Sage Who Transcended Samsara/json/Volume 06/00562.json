They wore red robes, and upon their heads were Buddhist tiaras. Their raiments denoted their identities as the Dharma Kings of Jin Gang Temple.</p><p>High above the air, they floated over the immense vista of the Fish Sea of Lake Bosten. There was a certain subtlety to the position in which they stood, akin to vital parts of a magical barrier or formation. The remaining six Lamas encircled them, contributing to the formation as well.</p><p>The three Dharma Kings clasped their palms together, chanting in unison.</p><p>“Thus have I heard, where the Buddha endures…”</p><p>Their chants were very fast, thus it did not take long for them to finish the long verses of the Diamond Sutra. Together, they spoke.</p><p>“Everything has law and order, everything is immaterial like fleeting illusions and dreams. Peaceful as the morning dew and rapid like a lightning flash, the nothingness of both should be interpreted thus.”</p><p>The six Lamas circling around followed them, chanting loudly.</p><p>“Everything has law and order, everything is immaterial like fleeting illusions and dreams. Peaceful as the morning dew and rapid like a lightning flash, the nothingness of both should be interpreted thus.”</p><p>A faint gold glaze radiantly glowed. Blossoms of golden lotuses took from above the townscape of the Fish Sea. From somewhere unknown, sacred Buddhist relics appeared amongst the three Dharma Kings, gleaming with piercing golden rays. The rays stretched far and wide around, casting an absolute and strong aura that seemed to sever all misery, destroy all that is foul and evil, and eliminate all Karmic influences, delivering one from the trials and tribulations of mortality.</p><p>“Everything has its law and order, everything is immaterial like fleeting illusions and dreams. Peaceful as the morning dew and rapid like a lightning flash, the nothingness of both should be interpreted thus.”</p><p>The chants continued to ring in the skies of the Fish Sea, penetrating all corners and crevices of the coastal town.</p><p>All around the Bogda Shan mountain range and the Fish Sea of Lake Bosten, the holy illumination of Buddha aura shone brightly as one like the Twelve Signs of Correlation. The glimmering illumination of the aura enveloped the entire area within thousands of li.</p><p>In the confinement of the Buddha aura, there were still those who had yet to leave the areas prior to the arrival of Meng Nan, the Prime Asura – due to their greed for wealth and artifacts – found themselves unable to move like insects encased by amber. The energy of their bodies slowly seeped out of them and fused with the glimmering luminescence of the Buddha aura and channeled across the Fish Sea to the golden Buddhist relics!</p><p>None of the warriors of the Exterior who had been restrained could break free of the restraints, save for those with the power of a Grandmaster and those under protective spells and conjurations. The rest could only watch in horror as their energy was drained!</p><p>Nobody had thought that the Diamond Sutra had such mysterious relations with the Twelve Signs of Correlation, allowing the Dharma Kings to lay out such a potent magical barrier when the chaos caused by members of the Ashura Temple had demanded most of their attention!</p><p>The sparkling glaze of the Buddha aura began to concentrate around the Buddhist relics, bending and distorting oddly, before turning into a towering Vajra. Robes were bound around his waist and his body gleamed gold. His bare torso and intimidating appearance struck fear into everyone who saw him. A terrifying and aggressive demeanor threatened to destroy everything that dared defy him!</p><p>Flecks of gold fell from the skies around him. He stood on top of a golden lotus with great majesty and bearing. The Vajra flicked his wrist and beckoned for his weapon, a dark golden Buddhist Commandment Blade flew into his grasp. The colossal Vajra stepped forth and the earth tremored.</p><p>“Everything has its law and order, everything is immaterial like fleeting illusions and dreams. Peaceful as the morning dew and rapid like a lightning flash, the nothingness of both should be interpreted thus.”</p><p>The waters of the Fish Sea of Lake Bosten began to split into two walls of water, leaving a dry channel in between, revealing the lakebed!</p><p>…</p><p>Deep in the snowy mountains, two Grandmasters of the Snow Mountain Sect stepped before the nine great tombs, snowflakes getting caught on the back of their hands as they walked through the thick snow.</p><p>They bowed reverently before the tombs. One of them held an ancient talisman, while the other held an artifact that partly resembled a banner and a staff.</p><p>The talisman glowed brilliantly before a column of light shot upwards into the sky. The mysterious banner-like artifact ruffled lightly in the mountain breeze, a dark and sinister glow emanating from it.</p><p>The two Grandmasters bowed once more, chanting as their backs bent forward.</p><p>At that very instant, the white marble door of one of the tombs swung open! A huge breath – powerful and terrifying – surged out like a raging river through the threshold of the opened tomb with a great rush of flowing air that screeched wildly. From the depths of the tomb emerged a man whose long white hair covered his visage!</p><p>There were no signs of living breath on him; there was only the deathly aura that enveloped the entire area of the mountain with an eerie silence. With a light leap, he dragged the two Grandmasters with him and tore through the fabric of space, appearing thousands and thousands of li away in the sky, over the townscape of the Fish Sea. His back faced the golden Vajra and he began to assume a pose as if they would be fighting alongside each other!</p><p>“Frightening…” Xue Lengzhao murmured, having been brought back to the vicinity of the stronghold of her order. “And that golden Vajra… I see why Teacher always warned me against sudden twists and turns…”</p><p>The scenery of the regions surrounding the Fish Sea had only flashed before their eyes when they tore through space earlier.</p><p>…</p><p>At the westernmost edges of the sanctuary of the Snow Mountain Sect, black gas rolled from an abyssal crevice. A deathly aura, strong and vast, radiated from the depths of the endless darkness within.</p><p>On the southeastern side of the crevice sat a temple that sprawled over a large area. Unlike most conventional Buddhist temples, this one was painted black and blood-red, with human bones and torn pieces of human corpses adorning the eaves and all corners of the temple. Horrifying sights of gory carnage abounded on the temple, and over its eaves, at the door, there was a plaque that had three words. Words full of malice, hatred, and anger.</p><p>“The Ashura Temple”</p><p>Luo Hou, the “Asura King”, stepped toward the Abyss Sea of Infinity with a box made of black jade in his huge hands. Chanting sutra verses of the evilest and foulest intentions, he dropped the box into the darkness of the abyss.</p><p>Black gas billowed and rolled angrily like the steam of a boiling cauldron.</p><p>Suddenly, the fumes broke apart. From the churning steam, rising out of the dark depths, a huge monster quickly clambered up the walls of the crevice. Half of its face was that of an ape while the other half was that of a dried skull. There were wings of feathers on its back, but both wings were broken and badly misshapen.</p><p>With three arms and four feet, the aura of evil, decadence, and malice of the grotesque monster caused even Luo Hou, the Asura King, to shudder. He staggered backward a few steps, holding his breath as he beheld the monstrosity that he had summoned. Everything around him seemed dark in the presence of the horror as if he had descended into the Abyss Sea itself.</p><p>The monster regarded Luo Hou coldly, its blood-red eyes filled with hate and malevolence. Then it gazed into the air and determined a direction before its legs stretched wide as it bent. In the blink of an eye, it disappeared, traveling thousands of miles in an instant, reaching the side of Meng Nan, the Prime Asura, in seconds.</p><p>By then, Meng Nan had already conjured his Dharmic Form: the form of an Asura with three heads and six arms. His eyes flared with anger and black fumes of rage spewed from his mouth. Nothing but anger could be felt from the dark-greenish manifestation of Fury that wore a black sash on its waist.</p><p>Swords, sabers, a lotus of obsidian black, a pearl flaming with dark fire, and a long, blood-red spear were wielded by the six hands of the Ashura form. Its presence alone was enough to paint the sands of the vast desert of Lake Baikal and Gobi crimson red!</p><p>…</p><p>Deep in the Immensity Sea desert of Gobi and Lake Baikal, there remained one warrior of the East Sea – one stricken by greed. A palm struck down at him with a terrifying aura that bore shades of five different colors in its wake. Green, yellow, red, white, and black were the last things that he saw as the powers of his artifact were exhausted and his powers spent. Nothing but darkness followed and he was dead.</p><p>Tai Li took hold of his prey and dismissed him unceremoniously by throwing him over his back, tossing him to the demons trailing behind. Tai Li spoke to his minions coldly. “There shall be more to come. Feast on this first to quench your hunger.”</p><p>He had barely finished when he turned his head and looked far away, in the direction of the Fish Sea of Lake Bosten. With a slight smirk, he said, “It is earlier than expected.”</p><p>His torso and body grew and swelled. In a flash, he turned into an enormous peacock with vividly-colored feathers. Five heavy-looking feathers of different colors hung from his tail: green, yellow, red, white, and black.</p><p>“Go into the Heavenly Sea Source. Keep away from all the turmoil,” said Tai Li. The Monster King reared its head and released a shrill cry into the air, summoning the rest of the Monster Kings that awaited its call. It flapped its huge wings and took to the air, flying in the direction of the Fish Sea.</p><p>Somewhere close by, a great white tiger leaped into the sky – quicker than the Peacock Demon King by a fraction of a second! Winds and shimmering flecks of its golden aura rolled in its wake, flying off into the sky.</p><p>At the southeastern edge of the Fish Sea of Lake Bosten, dark clouds gathered and winds began to whistle wildly. Flashes of lightning flickered from the billowing plumes of gloomy clouds while thunders groaned and rumbled angrily. From the midst of the impending storm, a Zodiac Ox emerged, riding on top of dragons of lightning bolts!</p><p>The Three Great Monster Kings of the demon race have come to wreak havoc!</p><p>…</p><p>Taoist Chong He delivered Qu Jiuniang and Yan Wuwo from the area bathed with the glaze of the Buddha’s aura. Gliding on the plumes of peaceful clouds, he flew towards the Fish Sea in his customary Taoist raiments.</p><p>Somewhere far away, a man of proud bearing stood alone in the skies. A long beard hung from his face, his aura circling around him in the form of purple fumes. This was none other than Cui Qinghe, the “Noble Purple Spirit”. Quietly he floated in midair, his Dharmic Form not yet conjured.</p><p>On the other side, not far from him,sat an old man amongst the clouds. The undulating strata of his unsteady aura wavering into nothingness and into prominence not unlike himself, substantial and immaterial at the same time. He Qi, the Sword Manic. He shared features similar to his grandson, He Jiu, save for his concealed proud demeanor and his white hair. No wrinkles were noticed upon his face despite his ripe age.</p><p>As if a stranger to the two that awaited him, Taoist Chong He nodded slightly to them both, and returned his attention to the Glaring Vajra who was trying to cripple the magical barrier and the white-haired man that emanated nothing but Death.</p><p>The Taoist had noticed the Prime Asura and the misshapen monster with four legs and three arms beside him, showing no signs of surprise as if he had long expected its presence.</p><p>Just then, the Three Great Monster Kings made their arrival, staring at him from across the other edge of Lake Bosten.</p><p>“Amitabha, Master Chong He. We should unite and repel the Monster Kings before we debate further on the affair of the Primary Instruction of The Buddha’s Palm,” said a voice that rang into his ears from afar. It was the voice of Abbot Kong Wen.</p><p>The Abbot of the Shaolin Temple flew toward them from afar. In his hands, he held a Buddhist staff with nine tin rings. His beard and white-flowing brows fluttered in the winds, adding to his already serene and calm demeanor.</p><p>A smile broke from the rosy cheeks of Taoist Chong He. “As always, you have great benevolence and kindness, Comrade Kong Wen, always seeking the interests of all mortals rather than the earthly wealth and gains.”</p><p>Every player in this intricate game of death and greed had deigned to be late to make their entry onto the board. Despite The Buddha’s Palm’s Primary Instruction yet unseen, the table of the contest hanged from a thread. The skirmishes were bound to erupt.</p><p>The great battle of Dharmakaya warriors was afoot!</p><p>…</p><p>Pulling Meng Qi along with him, Master Lu tore through space and dimensions. At length, they arrived in front of Mount Liantai.</p><p>“I have always shared a close friendship with the divine monk Kong Hui. I might be able to speak to him to ask him to join us in saving Master Kong Wen who is being held,” said Master Lu, his sights set upon the roofs and eaves of the temples of the Shaolin order afar.</p><p>Meng Qi spoke with a frown, “Senior, if I may… This is a matter of the gravest importance. I would implore that we mount the rescue without alerting anyone else. I know that the divine monk Kong Hui has an incurable ailment that pains him at noon every day. That might offer us an opening to infiltrate the grounds.”</p><p>Master Lu nodded gently as he listened to Meng Qi’s suggestion. “Very well. So be it.”</p><p>The pair waited until noon. With a blow from his sword, the Sword Qi pierced through the barriers impeding entry into the grounds of the temple. Together with Meng Qi, Master Lu reached the large crimson rock on the rear mountain.</p><p>Meng Qi led the way through the grounds, being more familiar with the routes through the temple. At a fork in the path, Master Lu heaved a light breath and pointed forward. The senior monk in a red cassock who was in charge of watching the grounds fell into a deep slumber even before he noticed the intruders.</p><p><em>“Very strong indeed…”</em> Meng Qi thought with great bewilderment.</p><p>The engraving “Righteousness and benevolence are off-limits” had not changed, still glistening with colored glaze. Before them, the door remained tightly sealed from entry.</p><p>Master Lu stood before the stone door. His breathing was erratic and his eyes were half-closed, his body wavering between soundness and nothingness.</p><p>Moments passed silently until he opened his eyes. “I have found it,” he said quietly.</p><p>Meng Qi drew his sword. Only a vast space of white filled his sight, blinding him with its radiance. He noticed a tear in the expanse before him where gloom and the glimmer of stars coexisted.</p><p>It took moments before he could regain his sight and he found himself once again before the stone door. The words “Righteousness and benevolence are off-limits” no longer had its former luster of dharmic aura.</p><p>Without a word, Master Lu entered the dimension of the pure lands with Meng Qi. They passed through various barriers and reached the sixth floor, passing through the barriers that had previously impeded Meng Qi with the ease of walking through air.</p><p><em>“This is just too easy…”</em> Meng Qi shuddered, imagining himself wiping away cold sweat from his heart.</p><p>“Amitabha, I am sorry to have troubled you Comrade Lu,” said Kong Wen, his voice ringing from within the barrier.</p><p>“It is only right for us to help each other, my friend,” said Master Lu calmly.</p><p>The unsheathed sword in his hand glimmered and radiated bright gold. With a simple stroke, he stabbed at the barrier.</p><p><em>Crack!</em></p><p>Meng Qi did not even see the sword light of the stroke. He only heard the loud crack that thundered in the dark. Still, he felt that many elements, unseen and hidden, crumbled in the swift blow of Master Lu. The barriers of the Fruits of Karma and the Mortal Dust Fall, the six artifacts that held the eye of the magical barriers and the three talismans that Han Guang had left to restrain Abbot Kong Wen broke crisply. The loud noise of their destruction broke the silence.</p><p><em>“Simple, direct and outwardly devastating…”</em> These were the words that flashed through Meng Qi’s mind!</p><p>Nevertheless, the seemingly simple effort on Master Lu’s part in undoing the magical restraints of the barrier did not mean that his powers dwarfed that of Abbot Kong Wen. Dismantling the magical barriers from the inside and from the outside were two completely different matters, coupled with the fact that Master Kong Wen had been weakening the powers of the barrier from inside throughout the years of his confinement.</p><p>Then again, it appeared that Master Lu had not even used his full power in dismantling the barriers! This unsettled Meng Qi.</p><p>“Amitabha, my sincerest thanks, Comrade Lu,” said Abbot Kong Wen, emerging with his long white brows hanging from his forehead.</p><p>“He is the true Abbot Kong Wen,” said Master Lu to Meng Qi via telepathy.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
