It shielded the insides of the carriage from the prying eyes outside. Images of deities drifted freely with grace on the curtain, suggesting an air of ethereality and remoteness.</p><p>The jet-black automaton drawing the carriage screeched and squealed incessantly as it galloped up the slopes of the mountains with ease. It was as if it was treading on level ground.</p><p>With their most strenuous effort, the martial artists kept their pace with the speed of the carriage relentlessly moving forward. Despite their struggles, they were unable to steal any glimpses of Meng Qi nor Jiang Zhiwei in the cabin.</p><p>The carriage pushed forward into the pits of the mountain, steadfast in its drudging toil as if being stalked by some unseen pursuer behind. The journey continued ceaselessly for several days until the carriage reached a barren wildernesses. The howling of beasts in the distance sounded now and continually, a terror in the which would have made one’s heart race wildly.</p><p>“Where do Master Su and Lady Jiang intent to go?” Pain ran through their legs as the martial artists toiled with fatigue and soreness to follow the trail of the carriage. Doubt began to creep into their dismayed hearts.</p><p>“They have embarked on such a sudden excursion right after the visit by Immortal Yunhe of the Plenitude Sect,” the black-robed man with a knife scar on his forehead scowled as he panted for breath. “They have traveled far into desolate wastelands, traveling only on the deserted and difficult terrain. Are they mounting an escape? Have their negotiations with the Plenitude Sect have gone sour?”</p><p>The more he reflected upon it, it seemed that his speculations were not far from the truth.</p><p>“Master… Master Su had offended Principal Zhu earlier. The Darkness Palace had insisted that they were recruiting them, to salvage whatever honor, it seems…” said the dainty woman.</p><p>Her voice trailed off into silence as the companions shared a look amongst themselves. <em>“The two mysterious strangers might not have anywhere else to flee from the wrath of the two most powerful factions in the land! Not when the Darkness Palace might be seeking to exact retribution and the bungled negotiations with the Plenitude Sect!”</em></p><p>Master Su and Lady Jiang might only be a cut above the strength of a common Principal. Yet, they were not be able to stand against the might of the Principal Elders and Immortals of both orders. The latter were rumored to have defeated common Principals with ease!</p><p>“Should… should we still follow then?”, the man with a squared-jaw asked hesitantly.</p><p><em>“Not even the accession of potent martial disciplines would deliver them from the furious vengeance of the two greatest factions in the land! They will live a worse life than before, fearing each and every moment of their lives like skittish rodents!”</em></p><p>“These are baseless speculations on our part,” interjected the female leader with stout features. “Would Master Su and Lady Jiang need to escape in a horse carriage? They could have just taken to the skies easily if they were fleeing!”</p><p>“There might not have been anyone in the carriage after all! We’ve been tricked to follow behind them as a diversion for any pursuers behind!” exclaimed the man with a knife scar, his gaze fixed upon the carriage hell-bent on continuing its journey ahead. A sudden impulse had almost compelled him to catch up with the carriage and steal a glance inside, but he was fearful of a fatal reproach by its occupants within.</p><p>“Indeed! Never have they answered our pleas. Our beggings have fallen on deaf ears as if they had no intent to impart any teachings of martial disciplines to us! It would be folly for us to continue trailing behind!” Grim weariness and doubt had driven the dainty woman to slacken her pace.</p><p>The rigors of the cruel world left many in great distress despite several desperate pleas for help.</p><p>The female leader looked at her companions. Her expression turned grim and somber as she spoke quietly, “I have failed in my learnings of the skills of automation, I have not the gifts and talents in learning to conjure talismans and charms. I have studied martial disciplines and have focused on the skills of the sword, only to be admonished that the path of the warrior is but a grueling and laborious endeavor. Only a few days before, I have lost all hope, like all the warriors around and before us. All of whom had traversed the Jianghu with swelling ambition only to be pummeled into despair and sorrow, relenting only to be a chaperone to defend residences like a common guard. Or I could be waiting for a husband of a similar and lamentable fate, hoping that our offsprings could fare better than us.”</p><p>“But when Master Su flicked off the Sword Ball with a snap of his fingers, he opened a whole new world to me. A world where we could attune ourselves with Nature, with Heaven and Earth. Our heads no longer drooped with anguish and despondency before architects of automation and conjurers of talismans and charms. With mere gestures, we could unleash wonders and amazing feats like deities and immortals.”</p><p>“For twenty and three winters, I, Fang Huayin have endured. For twenty and three winters, I have lingered with a forlorn melancholy. But no more. No longer shall I tread with grim despair. There is no telling how hard the road ahead might be. There is no telling how small the hope that might await me from a great distance. But, no matter how bleak a future that is in store, I will not give up. I will tread the path of pursuing the hope for greatness in my study of martial disciplines, Heaven forbid the pain of death that might await me!”</p><p>With ardent fervor, she spoke as her companions beheld her break of silence with awe. “Wang Dong, Mo Yan, Lu Fengming, Wan Yu,” Fang Huayin addressed her companions, “I shall not begrudge you if you are hesitant to continue in following my lead. But I shall persist, until the day Master Su and Lady Jiang would accept me.”</p><p>Mo Yan, the dainty woman pondered in silence. She first spoke, “We have knelt for an entire night. Still, Master Su had given us no response. I do not want to prolong my efforts in a vain quest.”</p><p>“For days they have traveled. It looks as if they are fleeing from something. They are escaping. It would be nothing short of dangerous and perilous to continue behind them. Why should we endanger ourselves when there might be hope elsewhere?” asserted Wang Dong, with a knife scar on his forehead.</p><p>Lu Fengming, who had a squared jaw avoided Fang Huayin’s gaze. His eyes flashed with doubt as he spoke, “I… I have the same thoughts as well.”</p><p>“And what of you?” Fang Huayin turned to Wan Yu.</p><p>A foreboding dread grew within her. A fear that she had chosen a path where only loneliness, rejection and shame loomed ahead.</p><p>Desolation, hesitation, and unease seeped slowly into her.</p><p>The white-hair young man, Wan Yu had been quiet since their debate. He looked far ahead, at the view of the brown carriage departing out of view. Softly he spoke, “I have never decided to leave, not since I saw Master Su had displayed the mystics of his powers and strength. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I shall continue, even if it costs my life. I would not live my later days regretting my decision today.”</p><p>Wang Dong and the other three of the company beheld Fang Huayin and Wan Yu morosely. Wearily, they clasped their hands and bowed their heads in respect, “We shall hope that your wish comes true.”</p><p>Without a further word, they turned on their heels and left, their departing backs drifting out of view into the lush bushes and thickets of the wild.</p><p>Fang Huayin turned to Wan Yu. “Let us push on, lest we lose the trail of the carriage,” she said quietly.</p><p>With a smaller group, the pair managed to gain a better headway in their pursuit of the carriage, following closely behind the carriage which was draped by a black curtain. Oddly enough, the carriage seemed to have lessened its pace.</p><p>A few more days passed quietly. Still, the automaton carriage continued its unfaltering climb over the ridges and hills of the rocky terrain. Despite persevering through the strenuous tribulations, soreness and fatigue continuously stabbed and stung at Fang Huayin’s and Wan Yu’s battered selves.</p><p>The carriage slowed to a halt. Seeing their chance, Fang Huayin and Wan Yu rushed to consume their dry rations and refreshed themselves with water hastily.</p><p>All of a sudden, a band of horsemen broke from the thick of the woods. Masked and armed with shiny swords and sabers, the marauding horsemen galloped menacingly as they aimed for the carriage.</p><p>The leader of the bandits set his sights upon the brownish-yellow carriage. He swallowed hard at the sight of the carriage, the posh and upscale-looking automaton beast drawing the carriage, and the embroidered illustration of immortals and deities on the black drapes hanging at the front of the carriage. Thoughts and imaginations of wealth and riches clouded his mind.</p><p><em>“Nothing moved from the other side of the curtains, it seemed to be empty, “</em> thought the leader, <em>“We would just have to kill the man and woman escorting the carriage and there shall not be any need to incur the wrath of any invincible architects of the Darkness Palace!”</em></p><p>“Let’s go, brothers!” cried the leader, brandishing his saber.</p><p>Rapid <em>clop-clop, clop-clop</em> of galloping horses sped forth. The horsemen closed in on both Fang Huayin and Wan Yu.</p><p>Feeling amused and ludicrous, Fang Huayin and Wan Yu could not help but thought, <em>you lot are courting death? The horsemen could barely summon enough strength to defeat both Fang Huayin and Wan Yu. Yet they dare to trespass before both Master Su and Lady Jiang?</em></p><p>The galloping of the horses drew closer, fueled by hunger and greed for wealth. Nothing moved from the other side of the curtains. Everything was silent and calm within. A dreadful fear began to slither into Fang Huayin and Wan Yu who were trailing behind the carriage: <em>is the carriage really empty?</em></p><p><em>“Yet, holding the carriage to recurring pauses and driving the carriage again seemed hardly difficult for a man like Master Su even if he is not in the carriage…”</em></p><p><em>“The carriage might have been empty after all!”</em></p><p><em>“Should we leave the carriage to the marauders?”</em> thought the pair, taking into account of their weary bodies and the sheer number of the onrushing bandits. Thoughts of a speedy retreat began to kindle in their minds.</p><p>The embers of her thoughts glowed brightly in red, urging her to flee. Instead, she gritted her teeth. She cursed herself for the indication of weakness. <em>“I have promised myself to persevere no matter the odds! How would I face Master Su and Lady Jiang if I fail to defend a mere horse carriage?”</em></p><p>A puff of dust lifted into the wind as she stomped hard and landed outside of the group of the attacking horsemen, freeing her from the surrounding circle of the bandits closing in on them. She dove to the ground and leaped into the air, slashing at the horses before attacking the riders.</p><p>Boldly, Wan Yu followed tightly behind, delivering blows as best he could by matching her attacks.</p><p>Still, fatigue took its toll on them, wearing them down as their movements slowed and turned sluggish. The bandits would never have proved to be a challenge should Fang Huayin and Wan Yu were in their best condition.</p><p>The bandits returned blows after blows at them. Fang Huayin sidestepped around, barely avoiding the blows of the blades that tried to sink their fangs into her as she leaped to safety. Still, the merciless exhaustion that she has endured for the entire journey overwhelmed her. Her legs gave way painfully in such grave a moment, Fang Huayin collapsed on to a knee.</p><p>Blankly she beheld the cold glint of blades boring down on her, the overture of her impending doom.</p><p><em>“Am I to perish here…”</em></p><p><em>“Is this the end of the pursuit of my path…”</em></p><p><em>“No! I yield not to Fate!”</em></p><p>She summoned up the strength and courage as her emotions flared. She dove and rolled on the ground the best she could as her life depended on it, avoiding the blows that her foes slashed at her.</p><p>Suddenly, a soft but warm voice of a man shook her mind,</p><p><em>Lift your blade, thrust it upwards,</em> said the voice</p><p><em>“Master Su?”</em> Fang Huayin shuddered at the realization of the person who spoke through her mind. With absolute and unfaltering faith, she did as she was bidden to, piercing upwards with her sword. Her leap of faith delivered its reward; her sword struck true, striking at the side of a saber.</p><p>The saber was deflected by her blow, its blade knocking off two other blades strokes which were aimed at her.</p><p>All it took was a mere stroke, decisive and true, to completely turn the tables around!</p><p>Adrenaline and surprise rushed like a torrential wave through Fang Huayin. Fueled by her renewed strength and will, she sprang to her feet, brandishing her sword as she claimed the initiative of the battle.</p><p>The status quo seemed to have been toppled with such ease! The bandits had been brimming with confidence when they thought they have the advantage of numbers on their side. Never have they expected that the male and female warriors have drifted amongst them like apparitions, avoiding their blows and retaliation. Yet each and every stroke of their blows bit true and deep, claiming the lives of theirs each time their blades bared their fangs!</p><p>It did not take long for Fang Huayin and Wan Yu to make short work of the bandits. Only a herd of horses remained idling about by the edges of the woods not long after.</p><p>Soon the carriage continued on its endless journey. In its wake, one of the bandits, one whose life was draining slowly out of him, watched the carriage leave. With a blurred vision, he saw the carriage passing him by, the black curtains remained still, not a movement more. An ambiance of unspeakable mystery and enigma seemed to linger around the carriage. The two, the male and female who have wrought such trampling defeat on to them, were now seated at the driver’s seat, driving the automaton horse forward.</p><p>The carriage galloped lazily away, disappearing from his sight.</p><p>…</p><p>The band of warriors of the Jianghu were in hused conversations in the inn’s common room.</p><p>“Haven’t you heard? Word is that a mysterious carriage was travelling around, draped with a black curtain on its front. People were saying that the carriage was moving towards the Darkness Palace. Two warriors sat at the front of the carriage, both of whom had defeated the Five Ghosts of Jing River and the Dangshan Seven! None of the practitioners of talismans and charms and the architects of automation could have done this?” exclaimed the interested and the curious men as the rumors spread like a pandemic.</p><p>“Has there ever been any warrior who possessed such invincibility? Who was riding in the carriage? Could it have been a practitioner of the Plenitude Sect or an architect from the Darkness Palace?” All who heard of the tale could not help but feel amazed by the unbelievable myth.</p><p>“Impossible. The Five Ghosts of Jing River would never dare lay their hands on the carriage if disciples of the Plenitude Sect or the Darkness Palace rode within. The carriage is empty, from what I am told. A secret lies within! A great and powerful secret!”</p><p>“No. Somebody is definitely in the carriage! But not a practitioner from the Plenitude Sect, not an automaton architect as well…”</p><p>Conflicting tales that differed from one another abounded the streets and alleys. Members of the Jianghu would hide on trees or creep behind rocks and boulders in empty paths and roads, trying to steal a glance at the mysterious carriage that was rumored to be passing by.</p><p>No one would know how long time has passed them by. Idly they waited until the gentle clop-clop of hoofs could be heard from afar. From their hiding lairs, they saw at the distant horizon a carriage looming near. At the front of the carriage hung a black cloak that shielded the innards of the carriage from outside. No movements were observed of within the cabin, so secretive and mysterious was the carriage that approached.</p><p>At the front of the carriage, sat a man and a woman. Their eyes were half-closed as if deep in trance, or meditation.</p><p>Suddenly, two shadows lunged and halted the carriage. The flash of a sword, a glint of dark green, shone dangerously. The sword tore through the air and struck at the female riding at the front of the carriage.</p><p>A black automaton figure, clutching in his hands a long halberd, trampled furiously towards the carriage.</p><p>“Somebody has attacked the carriage!”</p><p>“Remarkable! Disciples from the Darkness Palace and the Plenitude Sect really do differ in power!”</p><p>“The secrets of the carriage shall be unveiled at long last!”</p><p>A flurry of thoughts flashed through the minds of everyone witnessing the coming of the fabled carriage. Suddenly, much to their amazement, the male driver of the carriage leaped from his seat. In a few steps, he reached the black automaton. In the blink of an eye, he narrowly dove and avoided the swing of the automaton’s halberd. A glimmer of steel shimmered coldly and the man had rolled to the back of the automaton.</p><p>The automaton screeched to a sliding stop before it truly halted. Its body crumbled into pieces, tumbling on to the ground in countless bits and pieces.</p><p>The cold glimmer of the male driver’s sword gleamed once more. The architect of the fallen automaton dropped to his knees, clawing at his throat as blood poured out uncontrollably.</p><p>A dark green sword hacked forth. The female driver leaped up into the air to meet the incoming blow of the flying sword.</p><p><em>Clang!</em> The clangs of steel rang through the air. The assailant, the master of the dark-green, flying sword had failed to exploit his early offense.</p><p><em>Clang! Clang! Clang!</em> Blades of steel and metal gnawed furiously as they clashed. A series of blows were exchanged until a shriek of pain tore through the air a short distance away. To the ground another man fell, clothed in black. Streams of blood trickled from his nose, his eyes, his ears and his mouth as the assailant collapsed lifelessly to the ground.</p><p><em>Each of her strokes struck a connection between the flying sword and its master?</em> Fear and amazement took hold of everyone witnessing the unbelievable turn of events that unfolded before the contracted pupils of their eyes.</p><p>Calmly, the man returned to his seat in the front of the carriage. The carriage continued on its journey, trotting slowly past the two corpses that lay sprawling on the ground. Still, nothing came from behind the black curtain.</p><p>The members of the Jianghu who had been watching froze in their movements. They held the image of the carriage that was moving further away from them slowly as all voices have escaped them. From afar, they stared at the carriage withdrawing from sight. Gold, black and white sparkles seemed to encircle the carriage, revolving around the horse-drawn conveyance as if it was a heavenly chariot of a deity that had stepped foot upon the lands of the common!</p><p>…</p><p>In a mountain estate owned by a wealthy and powerful member of the Jianghu, multitudes of warriors from all corners of the land congregated for a common purpose.</p><p>“A deity rides in the carriage!”</p><p>“No, there are rare artifacts within! Artifacts that imbue one with great powers, allowing one to harness the powers of gods and deities!”</p><p>“I have not any concern for immortals or artifacts! If only I have the skills of the carriage drivers! I shall not be any lesser compared to the practitioners of the Plenitude Sect nor will I pale in comparison to the architects of the Darkness Palace!”</p><p>Wang Dong and his two other companions sulked with displeasure and silence amidst the cacophony of the squabbling debate.</p><p>“The present whereabouts of the carriage remains our utmost concern!”</p><p>A little boy, the ten-year-old son of the master of the estate, watched curiously as his elders and seniors bickering on about the carriage. It was most peculiar and bizarre. He gazed upon them with great interest, witnessing the agitated and excited exchange of words that deposed the inexplicable charisma of its wondrous journey.</p><p>His hands rose curiously, trying to touch the sparkles of black and white twinkles that floated before him.</p><p>“What is this?” he asked, his eyes gleamed with interest.</p><p>Despite the meekness of his youthful voice, his words pierce through the din of the heated debate with a chilling clarity. Everyone turned to him and noticed the sparkles of black and white that floated around.</p><p>“The carriage!”</p><p>“The mysterious carriage is here!”</p><p>The very same thought flashed through the minds of everyone present. Noises of running footsteps rang through the halls and aisles of the estate. Everyone was rushing to the entrance.</p><p>The great doors of the estate swung open. In the gloom of night, they saw a carriage approaching. A black drape hung at the front of the brownish-yellow carriage.</p><p>At the front of the carriage sat a man and a woman. Mystifying twinkles of gold, white and black glittered in the backdrop of darkness around the carriage like the advent of sacred beings. Images of deities and immortals decorated the black curtain that hung at the front of the carriage. All was still and silent within.</p><p><em>It was none other than the fabled carriage of enigma!</em></p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
