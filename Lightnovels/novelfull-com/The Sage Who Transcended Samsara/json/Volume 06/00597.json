The inside used to connect and combine with the outside, and the external world used to turn into his own imagery. All this had been completely shattered to pieces.</p><p>In his senses, he saw an arrow made out of condensed golden lights pierce through the sea of Vital Qi, through layers and layers of the void, and light up the boundless darkness. It moved very fast and imposed such a constriction on Meng Qi’s senses. It looked formidable like a Dharma and Logos of heaven and earth. Meng Qi felt like he could not resist or dodge it!</p><p>“What a terrifying arrow!”</p><p>Meng Qi was haunted by that terrible feeling. He could not raise his killing desire or his spirit. His hand that was holding the blade was trembling!</p><p><em>“Is this what a grandmaster using a Top Grade or even Exquisite Precious Weapon can do to me?”</em> he thought.</p><p><em>“I’m the one who has seen more than one Dharmakaya!”</em> Meng Qi ground his teeth and knew that the situation was bad. He called “the Primeval” to sit inside him. The Primeval neither worried nor feared. He calmed Meng Qi’s anxious state of mind with Kung Fu will and temporarily stopped the fear in his heart.</p><p>In this way, his killing desire was raised and his heart was stabilized. Meng Qi positioned himself in fighting mode immediately. However, the arrow went so fast that he could not manage to dodge it.</p><p>At this critical moment, there was a strange fragrance floating in the air. 10,000 golden lotus flowers appeared, and each blossom sent out millions of rays. The rays were as thick as soil and as boundless as the earth.</p><p>It was the Yuxu Apricot Flag. Because of Tian Kuo’s warning, Qi Zhengyan had prepared the Yuxu Apricot Flag earlier. Now he was unfolding the Kunlun secret treasure in the wind to ward off the Golden Light Arrow.</p><p>“Pfft!”</p><p>The Golden Light Arrows shot down all the Golden Lotuses and did not slow down. Due to the fact that it was low in class, the Yuxu Apricot Flag Replicate could only weaken the attack of the arrows. It failed to stop the arrows or slow them down. Having such speed seemed to be a feature of these arrows. The feature seemed to come from internal, rather than borrowed, Dharma and Logos. If Meng Qi wanted to stop the arrows, he could only destroy or contain its Dharma and Logos.</p><p><em>“What a terrifying arrow!”</em></p><p>Meng Qi exclaimed again, but his attitude had changed. Now he was really in awe of the power and magic of these arrows.</p><p>Meng Qi failed to avoid it or strike back; he was only able to expand his body to 20 feet tall. His Dharma and Logos connected, and then he looked serious. The arrows had to adjust their angles to reach the space between Meng Qi’s eyebrows.</p><p>They were guided arrows and they went directly to the mid-brows of the grand Minister over the Masses.</p><p>However, in this way, the arrows had to travel farther, leaving Meng Qi a little time to react. He tilted his head and raised his left arm to cover his face.</p><p>“Poof!” A Golden Light Arrow pierced his left arm. It inserted itself deep and then shone brightly. And finally, it exploded tremendously!</p><p>“Thud!”</p><p>“Boom!”</p><p>“Kaboom!”</p><p>As the golden lights shone, flesh and blood flew out in all directions. The grand Minister over the Masses was surrounded by glistening, pale golden lights. Qi Zhengyan was struck upside down and was knocked away by the force of the attack.</p><p>His entire left arm was blown off, and the Flowing Fire rose up very high. Half of his face was dented in and blood dripped down his face.</p><p><em>“If not for the Eight Nine Mysteries and the Yuxu Apricot Flag, I might’ve been crippled or even killed!</em></p><p><em>“Damn it!”</em> Meng Qi cursed furiously.</p><p>Still, the preacher of thought of the School of Mo had sense and knew that his enemy was a grandmaster with formidable Precious Weapons. He was not reckless, so he decided to run.</p><p>The mastermind who had been in the royal court drew his bow again. Now he had to be fast in order to win!</p><p>At the same time, experts of the Exterior who had been hiding beside the palace all flew out. The plan had gone wrong, so now they had to hunt the enemies down. There were the former Minister of Justice Tian Heng, the former Minister over the Masses Wang Dan, the current Minister of Works Gongyang Zeng, and Elders and disciples from their families. They really were a big family that had united to conquer!</p><p>Originally, they thought that once the assassination of the King of Chen failed, they would have no other way out. Thus, they sent the most capable masters to disable the King of Chen. That way, as long as they can cripple the King of Chen, even if the king was not dead, they had other means to deal with him. However, it went more smoothly than they had expected. The Golden Light Cave grandmaster had both exceptional strength and amazing secret treasures. Even the counterattack by the King of Chen was easily stopped with a few more secret treasures.</p><p>In the end, they did not run away after the assassination attempt. Instead, they stayed there and tried to frame Meng Qi by making him appear to be the murderer. They wanted to end this once and for all.</p><p>However, Tian Kuo somehow learned about their plan. He sneaked into the guarding team behind his father’s back. Apart from Tian Heng and Tian Jian, not a single soul from the three families knew about his worship of Su Mo. He had even secretly become a follower of the School of Mo.</p><p>The grandmaster from the Golden Light Cave exerted great strength with his right hand and managed to draw the bow. Behind his back, there were red clouds emitting millions of golden rays.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>Suddenly, a bell that could shake one’s Vital Spirit and separate their soul resounded. Those experts of the Exterior all felt dizzy and almost failed to contain themselves, while the target of the ringing, the grandmaster of the Golden Light Cave, sensed a buzz in his head. His hands became feeble, and the bowstring bounced back aimlessly.</p><p>It was the Soul-Ripping Bell!</p><p>The secret treasure was owned by Jiang Zhiwei to intimidate those who collected Transit Dues. After all, the grand Minister over the Masses needed a secret weapon to guard Shangying. Now it was the time to use it.</p><p>The golden rays became sharp arrows that pierced through rooftops and layers of clouds and headed into the dark green sky, aiming for the sun!</p><p>“Crack!” The little black bell held by Jiang Zhiwei broke into pieces.</p><p><em>“An opportunity!”</em> The grand Minister over the Masses was encouraged.</p><p>He turned around at once and the illusionary imagery of his Aperture acupoints shrank. The Immortal Primogenitor Form emerged behind his back, dark and obscure.</p><p>Then, he lifted up his remaining arm and slashed hard with his blade. The saber radiance spread as if it was creating heaven and earth!</p><p>The darkness split, the palace wall cracked, White Jade Square was torn, and the royal court was divided. In the land between Meng Qi and the attacker of the Exterior, everything was divided, even the ground had cracks!</p><p>“Poof!” With the buzzing sound, the Exterior who was in a trance suddenly snapped out of it. He could see the blood dripping down from his throat to his hip. Finally, he saw his right eye through his left eye!</p><p><em>“I can see my right eye through my left eye?”</em> It turned out that he had been sliced in two and then collapsed to the ground.</p><p>The saber radiance advanced to the chamber of the King of Chen and to the front of the Golden Light Cave grandmaster.</p><p>The grandmaster had just returned to his senses and directly pushed the saber radiance with his left hand. Immediately, the brilliant red clouds faded as did the saber radiance.</p><p>At the same moment, Meng Qi grew a pair of arms to catch the Flowing Fire, which he used to enter the Fire Elemental Conveyance and disappear. Simultaneously, Jiang Zhiwei got away with Ruan Yushu and Zhao Heng escaped as well.</p><p>They divided into three groups so they would not be conspicuous.</p><p>Moreover, they had discussed their reunion. Originally, they had come up with ways to run away and reunite, lest the aristocrat resort to internal wars to make the King of Chen compromise. It turned out that the plan took effect at the end of the peaceful month when the reform was about to succeed.</p><p>The grandmaster from the Golden Light Cave sensed the nearby places, searching for Meng Qi. He took a few deep breaths and projected in his heart the nearby scenes, streets, people, and houses in detail.</p><p>He acted like the supreme god who saw through light and darkness.</p><p>Unfortunately, he could not detect Meng Qi and his companions.</p><p>Somehow, the Golden Light Cave grandmaster had expected this. Su Mo and his companions were either Exterior experts or perfect Half-step masters. They had achieved the level of Oneness of Heaven and Men. Thus, they would blend their breaths into heaven and earth to hide, which he was not able to discover.</p><p>“Let’s get them!</p><p>“Close the Shangying border and search every house.</p><p>“Give me some men to hunt them down.</p><p>“We must catch them!”</p><p>The Golden Light Cave grandmaster became fully alert again as he opened his eyes to give orders.</p><p>Tian Heng and Gongyang Zeng found the orders strange. Compared with the King of Chen, the Golden Light Cave grandmaster sounded more concerned about Su Mo. <em>“Did he come to capture or kill them instead of helping us?”</em></p><p><em>“What exactly do the Golden Light Cave immortals want?”</em></p><p>…</p><p>Meanwhile, Meng Qi looked terrible because he had lost one of his arms and his face was dented in. Fortunately, however, although he had been severely injured, he did not lose the power to fight.</p><p>Since he had jumped in the Fire Elemental Conveyance a few times, he was now feeling exhausted and withdrew from it. Then, he connected his breath with that of heaven and earth to blend in, hiding. At the same time, he sat down cross-legged to recover from the injuries.</p><p>The Yuxu Apricot Flag that Qi Zhengyan used had a higher realm than he did and at the same time was energy-consuming. Thus, Qi Zhengyan was feeling kind of feeble and hurried to harmonize Qi-circulation as well.</p><p>Having stopped the injuries from getting worse, Meng Qi took out a Bhaisajyaguru Relieve Pill. He swallowed it and felt a cold feeling down his throat into his stomach.</p><p>While Qi Zhengyan had already recovered, he started to look around at the surroundings, only to find out that they were in someone’s kitchen. A fire was crackling in the stove, steaming the soup in the pot.</p><p><em>“Judging from the furnishing, it’s a bachelor’s house at most…”</em> Qi Zhengyan felt a bit relieved because at least it was not an aristocrat’s manor.</p><p>All of a sudden, he felt that Meng Qi’s breath had become abnormal, thus he turned back quickly and looked at the leader with concern.</p><p>He could not take his eyes off him upon seeing his leader growing his broken arm again, with the flesh and blood expanding and the muscles bulging.</p><p>“Poof!” A white, powerful arm grew out of the flesh and blood, glowing with pale golden light!</p><p><em>“This is also possible…”</em> Qi Zhengyan was in a daze.</p><p>Soon after this, he heard footsteps outside the kitchen, which sounded as strong as someone who was in the Half-step Exterior Scenery.</p><p>Just as the one who held the Yuxu Apricot Flag was about to attack or hide, he stopped. Outside the house, a breath of the Exterior approached, and the owner of that breath shouted, “Is there anything suspicious in your house?”</p><p><em>“Oh, no!</em></p><p><em>“Bad luck!”</em> he thought.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan squinted his eyes slightly.</p><p>With a creak, the door to the kitchen opened; behind it was a middle-aged man.</p><p>The air was frozen for a moment. The homeowner glanced at the duo and answered loudly, “Everything’s as usual.”</p><p><em>“Everything’s as usual?”</em> Qi Zhengyan failed to understand this and had to frown.</p><p>It turned out that the experts of the Exterior did not have the time to search every house door to door. They would only hover in the sky, monitoring, and send the soldier guards to search. Thus, they would not approach but only hover in the air.</p><p>The man closed the door and bowed as a courtesy, greeting them.</p><p>“Juzi.”</p><p><em>“He’s a follower of the School of Mo. Junior Brother Meng has planned the route!”</em> Qi Zhengyan realized.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
