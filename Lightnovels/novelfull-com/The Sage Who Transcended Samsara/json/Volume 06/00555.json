Being someone who knew a fair amount about Ananda’s Secret Scroll, a sudden thought came to him.</p><p><em>“Could this strand of karma contain the battle between Ananda and Monster Saint?”</em></p><p>Being ‘Fire Emperor’ Feng Xi of the Five Ancient Emperors and the perpetrator of the chaos of the world, Monster Saint was more than qualified whether in terms of his realm or strength to leave behind such a strange, mysterious strand of karma!</p><p><em>“Can I only get the object at the eye of the formation after shouldering Monster Saint’s karma?”</em> Meng Qi could not help shivering.</p><p>However, once he calmed down enough to make observations, he realized that he was not completely helpless.</p><p>He definitely would not dare to resist head-on if he witnessed such a strand of karma as soon as he arrived at the eye of the formation; however, under the circumstances where he could draw no comparison, he could only sense danger from the strand of karma and not the level of danger.</p><p>Having witnessed the scene of ‘Evil Master’ Han Guang killing Abbot Kong Wen as well as the scene of Ananda killing Divination Saint, however, Meng Qi now had the foundation to form his judgment.</p><p>“This is much riskier than the strand of karma of Ananda killing Divination Saint, and slightly more dangerous than the one of Evil Master killing Abbot Kong Wen. It’s still less terrifying than the other options. I’ll still consider it within the limits of my endurance…” Meng Qi made his speculations cautiously, not daring to advance prematurely.</p><p>Even though he could not explain why the strand of karma left behind by terribly powerful Monster Saint would be safer than most, he could confidently make his judgment thanks to his previous experience.</p><p>Meng Qi breathed a sigh of relief, calming his inner fears, anxiety, and uneasiness. He once again analyzed his judgment, from the beginning to the end.</p><p>When he determined that there were no mistakes, he expelled various emotions from his heart and prepared himself for the interruption of the Samsara. Wielding Heaven Inflicted Pain, he took the initiative to touch the fiery-red strand of karma.</p><p>The world around him changed soundlessly – everything seemed to have melted. All the Dharma and Logos were supporting a bud of fervent flame.</p><p>Inside the splendid and vibrant magenta glow of fire was a tall, slender woman dressed in a maroon empress’s gown. Her facial features were the most perfect that Meng Qi had ever seen in his life, so beautiful that it was difficult to put them into words. No matter one’s preference, it would seem that one would definitely satisfy one’s dreams in her.</p><p>The woman carried herself regally and, though her eyes were cold, she had a fiery charm. In her hands was a maroon spear.</p><p><em>“This is undoubtedly the charm of Monster Saint…”</em> Meng Qi found that he had once again transformed into the monk dressed in a white frock. He held a string of prayer beads in his left hand and a Buddhist Commandment Blade in his right.</p><p>Monster Saint took a step forward and pointed her maroon spear at Meng Qi at a slant. In a cold voice, she cried,</p><p>“Why aren’t you wielding your blade?”</p><p>“I can’t bring myself to wield it,” replied Ananda in his white frock, raising his left hand. It was the carved inscription of the strand of karma, not Meng Qi, that answered.</p><p>Meng Qi was unable to empathize with Ananda’s feelings at this moment. He could only watch helplessly as Monster Saint took another step forward and said, her voice underlying with bitter hatred,</p><p>“Then how did you manage to wield it last time?”</p><p>Ananda had no reply. He began chanting the sutras and all around him golden lotuses bloomed. The deluge of heavenly flowers were all dipped in colored glaze.</p><p>Monster Saint did not try to speak any further. She shook her hand, sending her spear flying like a dragon emerging from the sea. It pierced Meng Qi on the forehead. The magenta flames condensed and took the form of a phoenix that ignited the whole world. The Dharma and Logos melted, thoroughly exhausting all living things.</p><p>Ananda seemed to have given up all thoughts of resistance and allowed the spear to freely pierce his forehead.</p><p>The pain stabbed right into Meng Qi’s heart. He felt that every inch of his flesh melted and his Vital Spirit ravaged by the flames. The pain from such sensations was unspeakably extreme.</p><p>To use the pain of having a heated soldering iron burning one’s skin as a yardstick, the pain that Meng Qi was currently suffering was hundreds of thousands of times worse. It hurt so badly that the pain kept him from fainting. His self-protection instinct against pain that had exceeded his limit was no longer effective.</p><p>Flames laced every breath that he inhaled and exhaled. Meng Qi watched as his skin and flesh melted, even turning into liquid as the color of fire. His vision was engulfed in magenta.</p><p>His Interior scenery was collapsing and its connection the Dharma and Logos was melting; however, the flames did not extinguish the portrait of Primeval that held the down the fort in the center. Everything turned increasingly blurred and when it couldn’t bear it anymore, Meng Qi’s Vital Spirit would also die!</p><p>Meng Qi heard Monster Saint’s voice amid all the haziness, sounding rather surprised.</p><p>“Humph! Secular Samsara Way!”</p><p>His Vital Spirit began showing signs of being burned until there was practically nothing left, and Meng Qi felt that he could persevere no longer. Just as he planned to give up and return, in his bleariness he saw Monster Saint pulling the spear out of his forehead. She said coldly,</p><p>“If reluctance persists in your heart, you’ll always fall prey to oblivion. Even if you come to comprehend countless Ways, you’ll be hard-pressed to discover their true essence.”</p><p>“I’ll kill you each and every time you reincarnate; I’ll continue until your imprint completely dissipates!”</p><p>The red silhouette was haughty and distant as the flames began to subside, ushering in coolness. Meng Qi had managed to endure the ordeal until the very end.</p><p>The power of Monster Saint’s flames was much weaker than he had expected, perhaps due to her death and the erosion of Time Sword over the years. That was why the danger level of this particular strand of karma was considered low.</p><p>His vision returned to normal. The strange scarlet red strand of karma began dissipating, gradually revealing the figure in the eye of the formation.</p><p>Meng Qi held his breath and waited with rapt attention, feeling somewhat nervous. His mind ran wild with thoughts of Monster Saint’s words earlier.</p><p>“Imprint?”</p><p>The scarlet red hue turned increasingly faint, exposing more and more of the figure sitting cross-legged inside. Meng Qi could not help quickening his pace. What would be waiting for him there?</p><p>Would he really be able to learn Fruits of Karma?</p><p>…</p><p>“This is the Fruits of Karma Formation; its danger couldn’t be determined based on the previous four formations,” Wang Siyuan said, giving Duan Rui a reminder. “Take care not to touch any of the strings of stars. They might be harboring the will of certain big powers. Even the slightest hint of karma weighing on you is enough to damn you for an eternity.”</p><p>Duan Rui widened his eyes at the twinkling strands of karma drifting through the darkness and subconsciously asked, “Who in this world can still be considered a big power?”</p><p>“Since the ancient and medieval times, these karma strands are partially Ananda’s legacy and partially the manifestations of those who have ever stepped into this formation throughout the generations. None of these strings of stars is something that you can shoulder,” Wang Siyuan said flatly.</p><p>“Those who had entered this formation throughout the generations?” a surprised Duan Rui said. He thought that this was a secret place that only a few had ever visited.</p><p>Wang Siyuan said, amid coughing, “Before Demonic Buddha began wreaking havoc in the world, this place wasn’t a secret among certain high-ranking people but no one had ever made it to the peak of the mountain. However, one of my family ancestors once visited the place.”</p><p>“This place mysteriously disappeared after the mess that Demonic Buddha had created. It didn’t reappear until Dharma accidentally passed through the six of the mountain peaks and obtained a style of Buddha’s Palm.”</p><p>“B-But the big powers of the ancient and medieval times have long died. What does this have to do with them?” This was what confused Duan Rui.</p><p>Wang Siyuan looked at him with a faint smile. “Once the big powers encountered truth and virtue, they began adopting the Way and reason. They would leave an imprint in between heaven and earth. Even if they die, the imprint they leave behind will only completely disappear after an incredibly long time. Once you get infected by the strands of karma, you’ll have to bear the force that the imprint brings.”</p><p>Duan Rui felt his eyes widen in shock as his mind began deducing many things from Wang Siyuan’s explanation. “In other words, the older the imprints are, the countercharge force would be weaker? That karmas from the medieval times are more dangerous than those from the ancient times?”</p><p>“That’s not necessarily true. When you reach the level of Nine Primogenitors of Taoism and Five Ancient Emperors, the imprint you leave behind is practically immortal. That’s unless you abandon it yourself and refine it into something else.” Wang Siyuan merely gave a brief explanation. He stared at the tortoise script and it pulled them into the Fruits of Karma Formation.</p><p>…</p><p>In a secret location somewhere, the Black-golden Phoenix-feathered Spear that exuded neither breath nor might suddenly emitted a soft chant. Subsequently, the birds of the world cried simultaneously in response.</p><p>“There are signs of Monster Saint’s spear awakening!” a pleasantly surprised voice blurted out.</p><p>…</p><p>Meng Qi was now standing right before the eye of the formation. He stared at the scarlet strand of karma morphing into a flying light that slowly collapsed.</p><p>The flying light was like a large door that gradually opened to reveal what was inside.</p><p>Meng Qi was the type to feel calmer the more dangerous his situation was. His feelings of nervousness and uneasiness miraculously disappeared at this very minute as he focused on the figure seated cross-legged.</p><p>Whatever it was, what must come will come!</p><p>The problem would not be solved by avoiding it. Only by facing it would there be hope of defeating it!</p><p>Pop! The scarlet strand of karma disappeared entirely amid the illusory quiet noise. The figure sitting cross-legged in the eye of the formation finally emerged in front of Meng Qi.</p><p>The ‘figure’ was a woodcarving of a white-robed monk. The monk had handsome features marred by melancholy as if troubled over the sea of suffering in the world of mortals.</p><p>It was Ananda!</p><p>This was the first time Meng Qi had seen the true face of Ananda. Ananda, who had been shrouded in the fog, had finally ‘appeared’!</p><p>However, his appearance did not surprise Meng Qi. Instead, Meng Qi’s mind began buzzing and turbulent waves of emotions washed over him, causing him to struggle to shoulder on.</p><p>Ananda’s facial features were evidently different from his own yet when Meng Qi looked at Ananda, he felt as if he was looking at himself.</p><p><em>“He’s me?”</em></p><p><em>“I’m him?”</em></p><p>Meng Qi’s greatest fear and worry had turned into reality!</p><p>Had the ancient ‘evil ghost’ truly possessed him?</p><p>The different karmas, like the forces governing one’s life or fate itself, arrived, as if trying to weigh down on Meng Qi’s body. Yet, for some reason, they stopped in the vicinity of the woodcarving.</p><p>He did not know when it started happening but a change had taken place in the woodcarving. The left half of the body was exuding a distant feeling of vicissitudes of life. It was genuine and unique, as if incapable of change. The right half, on the other hand, was bleary and indistinct as if it was made out of the condensation of countless stars. Its continuous and unending changes made it difficult to be grasped.</p><p>At that moment, a sentence surface in Meng Qi’s mind.</p><p>“The past is unchanging; the future is indefinite!”</p><p>Buzz! Meng Qi’s mind shook. He seemed to have found answers to his various questions about Fruits of Karma at this moment.</p><p>Before this, he never quite understood why his enemies would die after their karma ‘clung’ onto him. It seemed as if they had lost the reason for their birth, thus losing the ‘fruit’ of their existence. But didn’t this mean that Meng Qi was changing the past? How could the true reality disappear just like that? This was truly unbelievable!</p><p>However, having witnessed the changes in this woodcarving, realization suddenly dawned on him.</p><p>The past could not be altered, but the future contained numerous possibilities. There were a lot of complex antecedents that could influence the future. There was no way for him to accurately grasp it before the future turned into the present.</p><p>Fruits of Karma was capable of temporarily taking away one’s karma, creating an illusion where the karma did not exist or distorting and magnifying a certain karma. Consequently, this simplified the factors that would influence the future and ensure the outcome was unique. In other words, it was capable of delivering a thorough death.</p><p>This was what Fruits of Karma was, the true Fruits of Karma!</p><p>Gloom fell upon Meng Qi, starkly outlining the twinkling strings of stars. He loosened then tightened, over and over, his hold on his saber. He no longer experienced any difficulty in thrusting his saber!</p><p>Having spent so many years cultivating bitterly, he finally managed to master the first part of the true Fruits of Karma!</p><p>Clang! His saber emitted a quiet cry as it traveled in a splendid trajectory and poked at the ‘fate’.</p><p>The woodcarving suddenly shattered into pieces, causing all the strands of karma to go out of control. They interweaved with one another, condensing and collapsing as a whole, before exploding without a sound.</p><p>The fifth floor restored its calm, revealing the mountain peak. Meng Qi remained standing in the same place and said quietly to himself,</p><p>“Whatever the antecedent is, I’m no one but myself!</p><p>“Since you’ve already ‘died’, then go on your way!”</p><p>…</p><p>Wang Siyuan, Duan Rui, and the rest were carefully moving forward when the strands of karma turned frantic and impassioned. They flew toward the center and condensed into a gleaming ball of light.</p><p>The ball of light collapsed within itself before suddenly exploding, destroying the object in the eye of the formation.</p><p>Everything turned calm and tranquil as if it was an ordinary mountain peak. Wang Siyuan’s expression shifted ever so slightly as he clenched his left hand, as if half of his purpose on this trip had inexplicably failed!</p><p>…</p><p>Meng Qi put aside his emotions and began to observe the sixth floor, considering if he should continue to go up.</p><p>Now that he had succeeded in mastering the first part of Fruits of Karma, he had lost all appetite for risk.</p><p><em>“I need to study the details of karma in Heavenly Golden Scripture further when I return. It’s best if I can obtain the relevant chapter of Seed of All Karma cultivation before achieving Dharmakaya, and then merge it with Fruits of Karma to create a karma bladesmanship that belongs solely to me. It’ll be a completely separate entity from Ananda’s creation!”</em> Meng Qi secretly considered his future plans.</p><p>If he depended solely on Fruits of Karma, he might just fall squarely into Ananda’s trap!</p><p>Since the cultivation of Fruits of Karma belonged to the Dharmakaya realm, Meng Qi did not dare to think that he would instantly master it. Thus, he decided to comprehend it and merge it with something else to create a new bladesmanship.</p><p>If Meng Qi were to be honest, he was still doubtful about him being Ananda. When he used Supernatural Power of Shaking Heaven and Hitting Earth in the past, he never even saw a sliver of Ananda’s shadow. Furthermore, he was a time traveler and born in the era of science and technology. There seemed to be little connection between him and Ananda.</p><p>“Could Su Ziyuan be the reincarnation of Ananda, but his body was taken over by me?” Meng Qi mumbled to himself in confusion. He found that the formation on the sixth floor was a superposition of the five previous formations. Furthermore, the eye of the formation was evidently unbroken, making it particularly dangerous.</p><p>Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly saw a mass of black gas swirling on the edges of the six floor. The black gas was connected to the formation and it entrapped a figure.</p><p>“Who is it?” Meng Qi was shocked.</p><p>To think that someone was trapped here!</p><p><em>“Could it be ‘Evil Master’ Han Guang who intruded earlier?”</em></p><p>Staring at Immensity Sea and Gobi Desert, Kong Wen uttered Buddha’s name quietly and said, “Junior Brother Kong Jian, Nephew Wu Jing, the Buddha Aura incident and the Twelves Signs of Correlation seem to be related. Please go on your separate ways to confirm this.”</p><p>He handed them both handwritten letters. Kong Jian and Wu Jing then instantly left to do his bidding.</p><p>Kong Wen, with his feet on a golden lotus, went in one of the directions. He had been flying for some time when the weather suddenly changed and the sky took on a bloody-yellow hue and a deathly stillness.</p><p>Underneath was a prominent similarly-colored winding river zigzagging through the land, threading together the voids and linking sinister and terrifying places. There was a prison of flames where evil ghosts were scrambling over a bite of food, and there was livestock self-mutilating. It was as if one would fall into deprivation if one came into contact with even a single drop of the bloody-yellow river water.</p><p>A sole human stood among the heaven, earth, and people. The human was warped and distorted like he was a follower of Shadow or a Mountain-morphing White Bone follower.</p><p>“Kong Wen, your lifespan comes to its end today!” a majestic voice cried.</p><p>Kong Wen’s expression changed a little.</p><p>“Life-changing Sect? Three Paths Formation?”</p><p>The sixth floor was filled with many great mysteries. Meng Qi knew he needed to investigate it further and pondered over it. He then slowly approached the formation, and asked loudly,</p><p>“May I inquire your identity, senior? Why are you trapped here?”</p><p>The figure trapped inside the formation of the sixth floor sighed.</p><p>“Amitabha. I’m Kong Wen.”</p><p>Inside the sinister, deathly still tomb, the Clan Leader lying inside the dark bier and the man shrouded in a bloody-yellow fog of death were awaiting for the outcome.</p><p>There was a row of lamp souls placed on the desk before them, the fire inside them burning quietly.</p><p>“Clan Leader, rest assured…” the man shrouded in fog whispered.</p><p>Before he could finish his words, a gust of wind suddenly swept them and extinguished three soul lamps at the same time!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
