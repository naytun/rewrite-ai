The meeting was meant for the members to tighten their friendship and deepen their sense of belongingness to the Immortals. In such meetings, the identities of the members were not a secret. This would be Meng Qi’s first meeting as he was just recently initiated. He was unaware of the identities of the other members besides ‘Progenitor Doumu’ Ye Yuqi, ‘Bluecloud Progenitor’ Qu Jiuniang, and ‘Primogenitor Guangcheng’ Yuan Lihuo. Perhaps he knew of their true identities but not their corresponding nicknames like Drunk Xie and Ren Pingsheng. Thus, he was excitedly making speculations of Primogenitor Lingbao’s true identity.</p><p><em>“There are only a handful of powerful warriors in the Celestial Rankings, so who would it be?”</em></p><p>The Primogenitor belonged to one of the earliest groups of Samsara travelers. Thus, he was safely assumed to possess great seniority.</p><p>The Primogenitor took off his mask, revealing no reaction to Meng Qi’s flurry of thoughts, and revealed a pair of white eyebrows and baby-smooth skin.</p><p>Like a wise, yet common Taoist, his benevolent features and gaze obscured a hidden strength. He was utterly mysterious.</p><p>“My name is Chong He.” Primogenitor Lingbao introduced himself with just placidness it was as if his name held no notable reputation.</p><p><em>“It really is him…”</em> Meng Qi was not as calm as he thought he would despite having long suspected Primogenitor Lingbao’s identity. Being the oldest living Dharmakaya master, ‘Immortal Chuyang’ Taoist Chonghe was a name that no one in this world would be ignorant of. Several times when chaos engulfed the world, he was the one who pacified the crises. For example, he had joined forces with Master Lu to fend off the grassland invaders. He had also forced Monster King into retreat several times. His final great achievement was defending Cloudsky Mountain against the assault of Peacock Demon King and two other prime demons with Master Lu until reinforcements arrived.</p><p>Thus, he was a highly respected person who had gained the reverence of the world.</p><p>More importantly, he was a genuine Dharmakaya. This allowed Meng Qi, who had felt uneasy ever since witnessing the might of Heaven Sovereign of the Myths, to finally relax.</p><p>There was a slight change in Primogenitor Lingbao’s breath, his Yang. He turned mild and gentle without even the slightest hint of nefariousness. He gave off no feelings of deterrence and fright at all. However, from the concealed changes in the Dharma and Logos in all directions, his Dharmakaya momentum was blatantly obvious.</p><p>Primogenitor Lingbao put on his mask again once Meng Qi nodded at him in acknowledgment. He then gestured for Immortal Taiyi to introduce himself.</p><p>For some reason, Meng Qi suddenly recalled the words of his sworn older brother, Gao Lan. “Chong He remains a useless old man who had yet to make a breakthrough. He’s nearing the end of his lifespan and waiting to enter his grave.”</p><p><em>“Immortal Chonghe has the Dominator of Six Samsara and Azure Palace backing him up. He’s collecting Buddha’s Palm to boot. It looks like Big Brother’s prediction would turn out to be false…”</em></p><p>The key point was that there was no shortage of elixirs up for exchange in Samsara. The changes that swept through the world had resulted in the efficacy of elixirs greatly diminishing. For example, a user of the Immortality Elixir of East Pole would only see their lifespan extend by 60 years instead of the previous 1,000 years. Furthermore, one had to undertake special missions to obtain Dharmakaya-level elixirs. The advantage, however, was that there was a wide variety of similar elixirs. Even if one did not exchange for elixirs or the same elixir, it would lose its efficacy upon second consumption. One could consume it repeatedly in different Samsara worlds. Through such accumulation, a tiny bit at a time, it would not be a problem to extend one’s life for several hundred years. It was not a stretch to make a breakthrough that way!</p><p>Immortal Taiyi removed his mask, revealing an expressionless face with a hidden touch of golden steeliness. There was no beard under his chin. His skin was an ashy grey hue that was glowing with a deep red underneath. His eyes were set apart further than that of most people. It was a face that had left a deep impression in Meng Qi and his head whirled to put a name to the face.</p><p>“Yan Wuwo.” Immortal Taiyi’s self-introduction was a concise one without emotion.</p><p><em>“Yan Wuwo? ‘Flying Yaksha’ Yan Wuwo? The leader of Zombie Fist Sect in the regions to the left of Yangtze River, Yan Wuwo? A famed master ranked in the top 30 of the Terrestrial Rankings!”</em></p><p><em>“Though he’s not in the Half-step to Dharmakaya realm, it’s impressive enough that he managed to squeeze into the top 30 filled with so many big shots in the peak of Exterior realm!”</em></p><p>However, what sent Meng Qi’s mind spinning was not this. “Senior, you’ve once fought a great battle against Doumu?” he blurted out in confusion.</p><p>“It’s just a show we put on for the benefit of others. The particular mission required us to join forces but, out of worry that we might leave clues behind, we decided to split up and get into a fight. Otherwise, who could we mollify if Dharmakaya are no-shows?”</p><p>The way he spoke showed absolute confidence in his strength.</p><p>This was in line with Meng Qi’s perception of him as a mighty, proud person who was prone to covering up his mistakes.</p><p><em>“Is his Dharma form Drought Demon, Red Dragon, or Nine Dragons of Divine Fire? Or is he like Doumu, who uses one form as a foundation that is compatible with the rest, without overlapping with its predecessors…?”</em> Meng Qi’s mind began spinning with inexplicable ideas.</p><p>Yan Wuwo said little and fastened the mask of Immortal Taiyi over his face again. Meng Qi suspected that he was the strongest person in the Immortals, with the exception of Primogenitor Lingbao and Progenitor Doumu.</p><p>Matriarch Lishan also followed suit in removing her mask and wig, revealing an elegant, beautiful face with a smooth, bald head.</p><p><em>“Nun?”</em> Surprise found Meng Qi first, though he soon found the revelation to be somewhat funny. He could not find in himself to laugh when he realized a phony monk like him had joined the Immortals as well.</p><p>“Avalokitesvara. I’m Mingfa of Shui Yue Nunnery,” Matriarch Lishan said, putting her palms together.</p><p><em>“Abbess Mingfa?”</em> This person before him was no stranger even if he was unfamiliar with the masters of North Zhou Dynasty. She’s the Aunt Master to the current Abbess of Shui Yue Nunnery and the Junior Sister to the previous Abbess, who had passed away after failing to achieve Dharmakaya. She was in the realm of Eight-fold Heaven of the Exterior and the 89th master on the Terrestrial Rankings with the nickname of 1,000-handed Bodhisattva.</p><p>Primogenitor Nanhua took off his mask as well. He had a handsome face that exuded elegance. His smile was as pure as a child’s despite looking like he was in his forties. He gave others a feeling of carefreeness. “Cui Qingliu of Cui family,” he said, grinning.</p><p>Yet another grandmaster in their ranks!</p><p>Cui Qingliu was a famed figure in the same generation as Cui Jiaqing, his strength second only to Cui Qinghe and Cui Qingyu. He was nicknamed Maniac of River East. He managed to force his way into the top 120 of the Terrestrial Rankings with his realm of Seven-fold Heaven of the Exterior, surpassing many masters in the Eight-fold Heaven realm.</p><p>Like the rest, Longevity Immortal Venerable also removed his mask to reveal a cold, handsome face that was striking enough to compel observers to ignore his appearance and age.</p><p>Upon closer look, Meng Qi noticed that he had straight, sword-like eyebrows and a tall nose. His looks could not be described as outstanding or ugly either. When it came to his age, that was anyone’s guess.</p><p>“He Xiu of Eastsea Sword Village,” Longevity Immortal Venerable said, introducing himself emotionlessly.</p><p><em>“The senior of ‘Soul Usurper’ He Jiu and a master in the Seven-fold Heaven of the Exterior realm. 148th on the Terrestrial Rankings…”</em> Relevant information crossed Meng Qi’s mind.</p><p>When he looked at He Xiu, Cui Mingliu, Mingfa, Yan Wuwo, and Taoist Chonghe, a stray through emerged in his head: <em>“Our comrades are scattered all over the world.”</em></p><p>He watched as they put on their masks and resumed their guises as mysterious, lofty Immortals and then removed his own. “Su Meng,” he said.</p><p>His true identity was an open secret among the Immortals. Thus, everyone nodded and indicated for him to skip the self-introduction.</p><p>Meng Qi secured the mask over his face and said frantically, “Primogenitor, Drunk Xie and Qu Jiuniang are in trouble!”</p><p>Primogenitor Lingbao nodded. “I’m aware. It was Xi of the Myths who ambushed and severely injured Chun Yangzi, who had barely escaped and hid in a secret location in the Immensity Sea. Unable to make it back due to a blockade by Snow Mountain Sect, Jin Gang Temple, and Ashura Temple, he could only relay the message to me.”</p><p>“It seemed that the Myths had long suspected his identity but had been lying in the wait.”</p><p>Meng Qi had secretly made his own decision not to try and contact Drunk Xie in Fish Sea or investigate Old Cao’s Restaurant. That would make him an easy target of suspicion for the Myths.</p><p>However, to think that the lazy drunkard Drunk Xie would turn out to be Chun Yangzi! What a waste of his nickname!</p><p>He deliberately prevented himself from thinking about a certain incident about a monster chasing Heavenly Primogenitor down eight whole streets when he first stepped into the Exterior realm.</p><p>“Speaking of true identities, this junior found out that Zhou Qiushan of Zhou family in River East is Blessing-endowed Heavenly Official. He has a close friendship with Slivery-badge Arrester Qian Kai. Furthermore, he’s showing signs of trying to recruit ‘Hermit Yusheng’ Lu Jiang…” Meng Qi said without trying to conceal this matter.</p><p>Yan Wuwo and the rest glanced at his Heavenly Primogenitor mask and said simultaneously, “You don’t have to address yourself as a junior.”</p><p>Primogenitor Lingbao nodded with a chuckle. “This situation is very useful to us.”</p><p>He continued, after a short pause, “Bluecloud Progenitor is currently missing but her attacker doesn’t seem to be someone from the Myths. When trying to determine her location using the soul lamp, we note that her soul lamp is still burning. That means she’s still alive.”</p><p>Meng Qi instantly notified him about Life-changing Sect hiding under Quicksand Town.</p><p>“You’re more well-informed than we are,” ‘Primogenitor Nanhua’ Cui Qingliu, commented. He could not help chuckling, looking rather rueful.</p><p><em>“It’s not like I want to be! I just happen to come across it! Is the sign of shouldering the fate of the Seed of All Karma?”</em> Meng Qi’s mind was a jumbled mess.</p><p>“The attacker doesn’t seem to be someone from Life-changing Sect either.” Primogenitor Lingbao said, having evidently obtained certain clues. Then, he added doubtfully, “What exactly is Life-changing Sect planning to do? They even took out Netherworld’s bones…”</p><p>He did not ponder on this issue for long and looked at Immortal Taiyi and the rest. “What news do you all have?”</p><p>‘Immortal Taiyi’ Yan Wuwo, replied, “I’ve come here directly without entering Immensity Sea. But it’s true that the Wang family is acting strangely. They didn’t dispatch any Exterior experts to the West Regions but they did so qutie frankly without concealing the matter. Everything appeared very normal.”</p><p>Since they were both in River East, he had a good understanding of the affairs of the Wang family.</p><p>‘Primogenitor Nanhua’ Cui Qingliu laughed. “My brother had arrived in the vicinity of Jade Gate Pass. That was why I was able to enter Immensity Sea.”</p><p><em>“‘Noble Purple Spirit’ Cui Qinghe, 5th on the Terrestrial rankings, has come as well? This is such an impactful piece of news!”</em> Right then, Meng Qi was keenly aware of the benefits of being well-informed.</p><p>“Uncle is sipping tea in Evil Ridge,” commented ‘Longevity Immortal Venerable’ He Xiu.</p><p>His uncle was naturally the other Dharmakaya master who claimed Formless Sword Qi of ‘Sword Maniac’ He Qi with his genuine body. He was eighth on the Celestial Rankings.</p><p><em>“In addition to Chong He, Meng Nan, Kong Wen, and the mysterious Heaven Sovereign who might be here, his arrival truly made this a gathering of Dharmakayas!”</em> Meng Qi inwardly sighed with emotion.</p><p>‘Matriarch Lishan’ Abbess Mingfa said quietly, “I met Brother Shou Jing in the vicinity of Cloudsky Mountain. He seems to be interested in Heaven Sovereign of the Myths.”</p><p><em>“Shou Jing, 2nd on the Terrestrial Rankings, in the Half-step to Dharmakaya realm! The leader of Xuan Tian Sect!”</em></p><p>Primogenitor Lingbao’s tone turned solemn. “Taoist Shou Jing? If he’s interested in Heavenly Sovereign, he’ll definitely carry his Blade of Timeshadow… This might be a trip by the Myths to entrap him. To Heaven Sovereign, how can Blade of Timeshadow compare to Buddha’s Palm?”</p><p>Blade of Timeshadow was a Peerless Godly Weapon. Ordinary Godly Weapons were no match for it at all.</p><p>Following a moment of silence, Primogenitor Lingbao said, “I need to meet Shou Jing and convince him not to make reckless moves and secretly cooperate with us, lest we give the Myths any advantage to exploit.”</p><p>This was, naturally, to be done in accordance with the highly-revered Senior Chong He.</p><p>“I’ll show you the way,” Abbess Mingfa said, placing her palms together.</p><p>Primogenitor Lingbao turned to look at ‘Primogenitor Nanhua’ Cui Qingliu and ‘Longevity Immortal Venerable’ He Xiu.</p><p>“Please pass on the message that Chong He wants to cooperate with them to obtain the Primary Instruction of Buddha’s Palm. Once it’s done, I and the member of the Immortals undertaking this task will comprehend it at once. We’ll let the two of them decide who should keep the accompanying Buddha treasure. If Buddha’s Palm can only be comprehended once, I implore that they join me in compensating the member undertaking this task…”</p><p>He went over the specific details, though further discussion would be required.</p><p>Meng Qi was stunned. Was Primogenitor Lingbao trying to unite Sword Manic and Noble Purple Spirit?</p><p><em>“If the three Dharmakaya covertly team up, Buddha’s Palm is as good as theirs!”</em></p><p><em>“It’s really nice to have members in there…”</em> Meng Qi quietly sighed. He then heard Cui Qingliu said with a grin, “Rest assured, Primogenitor.”</p><p>“Honestly, I was struggling before this. If the will of the Immortals and Cui family contradicts each other, I can only consider the interests of my family.”</p><p>The Immortals imposed few restrictions on its members. Furthermore, for members who were capable of becoming grandmasters, their sense of belonging to their families and sects were inevitably strong. They would not become traitors.</p><p>He Xiu nodded as well, showing his acceptance of the task.</p><p>Primogenitor Lingbao glanced at Yan Wuwo and Meng Qi and sighed. “This mission is a dangerous one. All the families and sects had imposed restrictions on Exterior experts. Furthermore, the purge in Fish Sea makes it impossible for you two to disguise as ordinary citizens. You can only use your true identities, which is why many of our friends cannot make it. We’re clearly shorthanded, so I’ll have to ask you two work a little harder in our stead.”</p><p>‘Progenitor Doumu’ Ye Yuqi was an example of member who could not come.</p><p>Meng Qi and Yan Wuwo exchanged salutes and indicated for Primogenitor Lingbao to assign them their tasks.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
