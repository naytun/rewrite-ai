Outside, thunder rumbled and the winds howled suddenly, shielding the whispers of their debate from prying ears.</p><p>“Yes, that way we can learn more about what is going on around here instead of running through the maze of their deception as if we are mules being led by a carrot before us. We should just take hold of one of them and interrogate him for answers,” said Meng Qi behind the mask of the Heavenly Primogenitor. He spoke as if they were talking about trivial issues such as their schedule instead of something of such magnitude.</p><p>“But, would this not stir the rest of the provincial governors?” Zhang Yuquan said with a hesitant frown. “This might give them an excuse to unite and incite a revolt…”</p><p>This transgression was a burden he could not bear.</p><p>“It has almost been a day since we arrived at Xinhai City yet we have not heard of any news that the provincial governors would be conducting investigations into the shipwrecks of the previous voyages from the mainland. They are all birds of a feather. It would hardly matter whether we sit still or spring into action. Do you believe that these treacherous thieves do not have any preparations for revolt when they already have the means and motives to deter the coming of any inspection parties from the mainland and annihilate the accompanying fleet?” Meng Qi’s unnerving stillness as he spoke struck a cold fear into Zhang Yuquan. Meng Qi continued. “The sea route will be severed in just one more month. If indeed the treachery of a revolt is afoot, would you rather have the revolt flare up before or after the sea routes are severed?”</p><p>“Before, of course, Master Primogenitor.” Zhang Yuquan replied hastily.</p><p><em>Of course! If we lose this window of opportunity, then this Immortal of the Azure Palace and I would have to face the horde of rebels alone for nine months before the sea routes reopen!</em></p><p><em>Furthermore, the Heavenly Primogenitor will be escorting the five provincial governors back to the mainland, leaving me here alone with only two Exterior members of the imperial family! I shall be exposed to dangers that might await in unknown territory!</em></p><p><em>If the revolt rises up before the sea routes are closed, I can summon two more legions of reinforcements for better security!</em></p><p>Having gained a clearer understanding, Zhang Yuquan’s face turned grave. With a low voice he said, “Master Primogenitor, this is nevertheless a most delicate and perilous situation. There could be other powerful forces that Fang Butong has enlisted in this treasonous act of his. Are you certain of success?”</p><p>“As far as the five provincial governors are concerned, the annihilation of the entire fleet of the imperial envoy at sea was their best course of action. The alleged shipwrecks would cause families and sects to convince and dissuade the Emperor from sending a stronger fleet of ships and armed forces. The delay would culminate in the closing of the sea routes, thereby cutting off the continent from the mainland. Thus, we can assume that to ensure success, the minions that they sent forth to destroy the fleet at sea were some of their best, if not the best,” Meng Qi deduced calmly, exuding utmost confidence.</p><p>At the same time, Meng Qi thought to himself, <em>“What a pity, despite his power and level of the Exterior, this envoy lacks the will and bearing that befits his position and his powers…”</em></p><p>Zhang Yuquan had achieved the cultivation of his powers via conventional training and meditation. Despite not attaining his powers and levels of strength through the consumption of enhancements and elixirs, still, the robust and rich Vital Qi that permeated this realm may have spared the warriors and practitioners of martial disciplines here from the rigors of hard work as well as from mental and physical challenges. It deprived them of the clout and fortitude that Meng Qi had developed.</p><p>“Indeed.” Zhang Yuquan nodded his head. “But what if Fang Butong has no objections and would later turn out to be innocent?”</p><p>He had instinctively overlooked the Immortal’s somewhat boorish address of the Emperor.</p><p>“If he is innocent, then he would remain what he is: a true son of the Empire and a loyal servant to the Imperial Court. Hearty apologies would surely be able to assuage him.” Meng Qi felt that his restraint was really good, realizing newfound patience for the indecisiveness of the envoy.</p><p>With the boldly endorsed assurances of the “Heavenly Primogenitor” from the Azure Palace, Zhang Yuquan finally came to a decision. He walked back and forth, shaking off what was left of his indecision before he swung the doors open and called for a steward. “Summon Governor Fang. Tell him that I wish to discuss the public affairs of the province.”</p><p>…</p><p>The sun had already retired into the arms of the mountains when Governor Fang Butong finally made an appearance. The moon had begun to rear its head over the lapping waters of the ocean, casting a shimmering glow that exuded peace and tranquility to the coast.</p><p>Yet Fang Butong had not come alone. A balding man of ripe age dressed in the garb of a warden was at his side. The few strands of white hair that remained on the man’s head and the gnarled wrinkles and creases of his face gave him the chill of a corpse from an ancient grave. Nothing about him seemed alive, save for his deep, burning gaze that seemed to bore into whomever he set his eyes on!</p><p>“This is?” Zhang Yuquan rose from the seat of honor and received his guests at the door.</p><p>The envoy had only set up a few seats after the banquet and had tea prepared for a private discussion.</p><p>Fang Butong threw a quick glance at the still and unmoving figure of the “Heavenly Primogenitor” before looking down and laughed. “We are but interlopers to the locals of the land. The natives, the people of the Andong tribe, are like the ravenous wolves of the wilderness. Without the blessing and the protection accorded by the Immortal Taiyi and other immortals of the Azure Palace, the host of the Imperial Court could not have decimated the Prayer Altar of the Andong Tribe and routed what was left of them. We would not have been able to establish the Qiao Provinces here. Still, despite the peace that has endured since then, there have been a number of attempts on my life.”</p><p>“As a warrior of the Exterior, I am hardly unnerved by the insidious assassination attempts, but there were times when even the best of my skills faltered in the face of these sudden ambushes. My men could only plead incompetence before the cunning and malevolence of such barbarians. I was fortunate to have Master Chen Wendeng with me. His mastery and skillfulness in the art of war have initiated a number of reforms in the security protocols of my administration as well as hidden dealings and affairs that have decreased the threats to our safety here.</p><p>“Now that I am about to be summoned back to the Court of His Majesty, Master Chen here wishes to remain in the locale of Xinhai City, thus his presence here is to meet with you, Your Excellency.”</p><p><em>A true master of martial disciplines…</em> As a full-fledged practitioner of the martial arts who has attained the level of the Exterior, Zhang Yuquan could sense that the stranger before him was suppressing his breath in order to hide the true extent of his powers. He was certain that the stranger was also of the Exterior.</p><p><em>Do we still have to proceed with the plan?</em> Doubt crept into Zhang Yuquan’s heart once more. He glanced at Meng Qi. The “Heavenly Primogenitor” sat calmly in his seat; steady and adamant was his gaze, showing no sign of retreat.</p><p><em>With such ease, the Heavenly Primogenitor eliminated the two rebels of the Exterior who attacked the fleet earlier. What is there for me to be afraid of?</em> Zhang Yuquan convinced himself to remain calm. He smiled in response to the request of his guests and ushered them to their seats.</p><p>They exchanged a few words. Slowly, Zhang Yuquan steered the subject of their discussion into the affairs of the Qiao Province, talking about the affairs of the citizens and the scourge of the Andong Tribe as well as other domestic issues. Zhang Yuquan spoke and conferred with Fang Butong with a mask of sincerity, trying his best to quell any doubt and suspicions that his guests may have harbored.</p><p>Fang Butong wore an expression of genuine candor, exchanging deep views with the envoy in their discussion.</p><p>The talks were progressing amicably when Meng Qi suddenly broke his silence. “Governor Fang, I have a question that I wish you can provide an answer to.”</p><p>A sudden stab of cold struck deep into Fang Butong’s heart, deeply unsettling him. He bowed his head reverently with his hands clasped, “I am at your service, Master Primogenitor.”</p><p>Nothing but the stern masked face filled his sight. The strict features of the fabled deity with the mask reminded him of the sacred statue of the deities in the Taoist monasteries.</p><p>Meng Qi kept his arms folded, his hands concealed within the large sleeves of his robes. With a roaring voice, Meng Qi bellowed, “How dare you! Governor Fang!”</p><p>“HOW DARE YOU!”</p><p>The sudden spike in the tone of Meng Qi’s words rumbled in the chamber like the crack of a thunderclap. The words boomed into Fang Butong’s ears, causing him and his accomplice, Chen Wendeng, to shudder.</p><p><em>How dare I?</em></p><p><em>He knows!</em></p><p>Fang Butong’s ears were ringing and he felt nauseated, unable to think clearly as if his mind had been thrashed and rocked by rolling waves of destruction! He could only look blindly at the Heavenly Primogenitor who had risen to his feet and stepped closer to him. The Heavenly Primogenitor’s body began to swell and enlarge, interweaving with the Dharma and Logos of Nature. With a gargantuan size, the Deity loomed over all of them, his girth filling the entire room. Only the Deity remained in his vision, nothing more!</p><p>The stern face behind the mask looked down at him. The air and fabric of space trembled as he summoned and channeled power from the pool of energies of the Dharma and Logos of Nature. Everyone present could only behold the greatness of his sanctity which was augmented by the quivering ambiance enveloping his body. His right fist rose up and then smote mercilessly at Fang Butong.</p><p>Fang Butong was just regaining his senses when he saw the gigantic fist with the shape of a Ruyi Sceptre striking down at him. A faint glow of gold coated the gigantic fist. The destructive blow dispelled strands of fumes and tore even the substance of time and space, allowing him no room for escape!</p><p><em>OH NO!</em> Fang Butong cursed with gritted teeth as dread swept down on him. His powers channeled instinctively and the gossamer silhouette of a gigantic tree appeared at his back. Its branches extended far and wide with lush leaves filling the eaves. Its strong roots bore deep into the ground. Life pulsed vigorously in the bark and the trunk of the tree, its powers hinting at a strength of the First Celestial Ladder.</p><p>He raised his hands to defend himself from the impending assault, and the bark and branches of the tree extended over his shoulders as if to reinforce his defenses. Suddenly, the tree groaned in panic and retreated back into his body in a flash. It was as if it had laid eyes on something that had scared the wits out of it.</p><p><em>What happened?!</em></p><p>Fang Butong began to panic. The crumbling of his Dharmic Form indicated that he had lost his attunement to the Dharma and Logos of Nature. He could only channel a sprinkling of the energies of the Wood Element and summon a shield of densely-intertwined twigs and branches to defend himself.</p><p><em>Pfft!</em></p><p>Golden sparks encircled Meng Qi’ fist and turned into the shape of lotus flowers that shimmered in the fumes dispelled by the strong blow. The gigantic fists passed through the dense branches as if they were made of air and struck squarely on Fang Butong’s forehead.</p><p>Yet, just when the blow was inches from hitting Fang Butong, Meng Qi opened his fist and spread his fingers like a claw! He grabbed Fang Butong’s head and channeled his powers, funneling his energies into Fang Butong’s body, incapacitating him.</p><p>The Immortal-sealing Technique!</p><p><em>Bang!</em></p><p>On the other side, Zhang Yuquan had tried to keep Chen Wendeng occupied but was instead soundly trounced by the latter. He was thrown to the wall after receiving a blow from Chen Wendeng and had suffered a huge wound on his chest. Crimson-golden flames sizzled as it burned the exposed flesh and blood. His wounds were so awful that one more move could seriously injure, if not kill him.</p><p>Behind the nearly bald head of Chen Wendeng hung the large orb of a burning sun that blazed and shone angrily with its scorching heat and blinding rays. Unlike the blazing sun that hung in the sky, the sun that hung behind him burned intensely with bloody red malice.</p><p>Chairs, tables, cups, and utensils all burned without catching fire – instantly reduced into ashes by the blazing orb that burned hungrily behind Chen Wendeng’s head. Even the ground under their feet became soft, seemingly about to melt.</p><p>Tears and cracks of the void appeared around him. Chants and prayers could be heard from within, mixed with the aura of blood sacrifice. The sinister auras were absorbed by the Grand Sun of Chen Wendeng’s conjuration, convulsing wildly as it ingested the insidious energies.</p><p><em>The Witch Doctor of the Grand Sun!</em></p><p><em>Chen Wendeng is the Witch Doctor of the Andong Tribe that worships the Sun God!</em></p><p><em>Fang Butong and the revolting governors have colluded with the Andong Tribe!</em></p><p>A flurry of thoughts flashed through Zhang Yuquan’s mind, leaving him speechless and paralyzed until the figure of the Heavenly Primogenitor stood over him.</p><p>Chen Wendeng did not speak. The battle between Meng Qi and Fang Butong had told him enough: the purported Deity was not as powerful and invincible as they had thought. He had only defeated Fang Butong through the use of unconventional means! Chen Wendeng was supremely confident that he would be able to defeat Meng Qi as long as he was careful and prepared!</p><p>The blood-red Grand Sun flew from behind Chen Wendeng and circled around Meng Qi. Flames burst forth from the orb, obliterating the roof of the chamber as a huge column of fire shot up into the sky. Everything around Meng Qi was melted. Only molten clumps, burning embers, and cinder were left, enveloped in a bright glazed radiance of orange. Chen Wendeng’s mastery had concentrated the conflagration at this point even though the sounds of turmoil and alarm had already been heard for miles.</p><p>Chen Wendeng walked effortlessly through the flames, only to see that the Heavenly Primogenitor was still standing! Tall and proud he stood amidst the hell of fire around him, his robes fluttering in the turbulent winds undamaged despite the heat!</p><p>“Your robes are very good indeed!” Chen Wendeng roared. His muscles swelled and grew as he punched rapidly. No one could tell how many blows he delivered in an instant, but a multitude of blows flashing with flames rained down on Meng Qi like a hailstorm of asteroids!</p><p><em>The Searing-sun Fist!</em></p><p><em>Bang! Bang! Bang!</em> The hail of fiery fists fell upon the ground, cracking the earth with tremendous force and sweltering heat!</p><p>On the other side, the incapacitated Fang Butong called out with a muffled but discernible voice.</p><p>“Have mercy, Master! I am a spirit of Kunlun!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
