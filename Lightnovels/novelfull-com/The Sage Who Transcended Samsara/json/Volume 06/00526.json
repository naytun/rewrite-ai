Its Nth Order was evident for everyone to see.</p><p><em>“There’s no undulation of Taoism…”</em> The thought suddenly occurred to the Taoist nun, who took a sharp breath.</p><p>His right hand was bursting with such vitality that it was evidently not a mechanism. Chang Huan held his breath.</p><p>They met each other’s eyes and understood the idea written in them. The green-robed young man with an amiable smile had relied on his physical strength alone to flick the fierce, decently-ranked flying sword. There was no hint of injury on his fingers as if the heavy sword had been the lightest thing ever. He made it seem as though the heavy sword was truly that light!</p><p><em>“Could he still be considered human?”</em></p><p>The master, who had previously seemed so noble in the eyes of the two ordinary folks, wore a blank expression appearing stunned. He looked as if he was staring down a wild beast wrapped in human skin!</p><p>How could the human tribe have gained the strength to contend with flying swords without relying on external objects or Taoism? No, they had merely used one finger alone to shatter the ray of light!</p><p>The passengers looked at Meng Qi, who was smiling, and Jiang Zhiwei, who was suppressing hers, before turning to the scarlet sword ball lying miserably on the ground. They felt as if they had been dropped right in the middle of a fairy tale.</p><p>Meng Qi patted the lapel of his robe and said with a smile, “Lord Chang, please keep the sword ball. A vicious item like this has to be properly sealed.”</p><p>He thought that the best plan was to follow Xie Xuan and enter Yongzhou City discreetly, then find the underground powers. He could then fake an identity and blend with the locals to clarify the situation. He would also resell the items specific to the region and start bringing in rare items into the county, slowly gaining a foothold in this place and making enough of a profit to buy exotic minerals and produce. There was no need to ‘rob’ like the impatient Ze Luoju and so incur the wrath of the influential in this world. That would just be just a pure waste of an opportunity.</p><p>This was a sophisticated way to scheme, but Meng Qi had not expected the murderous aura that was plaguing the young man with the sword scabbard as being due to the flying sword. If he had not acted, Xie Xuan would have died on the spot. In the end, he had decided to flick the flying sword and test the waters!</p><p><em>“How can I trouble Zhiwei to do something this conspicuous?”</em></p><p><em>“That’s just how considerate I am!”</em></p><p>His smile and serene words shattered the frozen atmosphere. The Taoist nun from the Soaring Spark Sect instantly put away the overweening, vicious sword ball and resealed it.</p><p>The others seemed as if they were jolted awake from a dream. Yet the more awake they were, the more unbelievable they had found the scene earlier. They could not help wondering:</p><p><em>“Could he still be considered human?”</em></p><p>Chang Huan’s expression faded and he lifted his hands in a salute. “How do I address you, my friend? I’m Chang Huan of Yongzhou.”</p><p>His left hand appeared to have luster in it as if it was a wood carving.</p><p>“I’m Su Meng and this is my cousin, Jiang Zhiwei. We’re South Sea islanders but our ancestors have ties to Yongzhou. Several years ago, I happened to receive the impartation of ancient Qi Practitioners and turn it into my life-long training. Out of my admiration of the bustling Middle Kingdom, the mystical Darkness Palace, and the free and unfettered immortal sects, I’ve come here to seek honor and riches,” Meng Qi said.</p><p>“Ancient Qi Practitioners?”</p><p>“Impartation of Qi Practitioners!”</p><p>Cries of exclamation rang out one after another as shock swept all the passengers. Most of them had just learned about Qi Practitioners from Ouyang Zheng’s explanation earlier yet they had now encountered one in the flesh!</p><p>Was this a symbol of a martial artist achieving the Heaven-connecting realm?</p><p>No wonder he could fight the flying sword with his physical body alone!</p><p>Though they were stunned, they were suspicious as well. The swordsmen sitting at the back of the compartment appeared particularly thrilled. Yet, in their delight and excitement there was also hesitation and doubt.</p><p>The group consisted of three men and one woman all in their twenties. They were spirited, ordinary-looking folks who appeared to have suffered hardships in their lives.</p><p><em>“Qi Practitioners? Could they really be ancient Qi Practitioners?”</em></p><p>They had just felt disappointment over the loss of the impartation of Qi Practitioners creating havoc on earth, yet things had suddenly taken a turn for the better!</p><p>Chang Huan and the Taoist nun from the Soaring Spark Sect clearly had some knowledge of the ancient Qi Practitioners, so it was not an odd thing for there to be someone to inherit a long-lost impartation. From his words, Meng Qi seemed to be a talent who was looking for a worthy patron among the great powers here. Not one of those lunatics who attempts to overthrow Darkness Palace and the Divine Sect for the sake of gaining some adventure.</p><p>Which family would not want him as a Guardian after the strength he had displayed from flicking the flying sword?</p><p>The astonishment faded from Chang Huan’s expression. “So, you’ve received the impartation of ancient Qi Practitioners. It’s no wonder your physical body is powerful enough to contend with a flying sword. Since Yongzhou isn’t far from here, may I have the honor of having you as my guest?”</p><p>“That’s my intention,” Meng Qi said, chuckling.</p><p>Xie Xuan and Ouyang Zheng had remained in a perpetual state of shock as they stared at the handsome, confident-looking young man. They only just snapped out of it.</p><p>No wonder he dared to call himself the nemesis of evil spirits!</p><p>Not even a flying sword could touch a hair on his head!</p><p>Ouyang Zheng seemed to be grappling with embarrassed anger. The scene of the fair and powerful hand flicking the flying sword appeared to have left a deep impression on him. He felt that it was only right for a true man to display his skills!</p><p>The Qi Practitioners of the ancient times truly deserved their reputation!</p><p>For a moment, he felt a thrill run through him.</p><p>Like him, Xie Xuan felt Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei to be intermediaries between humans and immortals.</p><p>Chang Huan fished an object out of his pouch. The object transformed into a tortoise-shaped mechanism with a creak and he sat on the back of its shell, indicating Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei to follow suit. He started an idle chatter with them and purposefully mentioned the isles of the South Sea.</p><p>The other martial artists behind them did not dare to approach because of him and the Taoist nun. They could only watch and listen from a distance, their expressions darting between excitement and worry.</p><p>Meng Qi spoke frankly, describing the island he was from as being deep into the South Sea. The words just came naturally to him as he spoke about it all, of the ocean, the view, and all strange creatures there. Jiang Zhiwei could not help from feeling dragged in as she listened.</p><p><em>“Since when did the little monk go out to sea?”</em></p><p><em>“You just need to have watched sci-fi movies, to have heard of the mystical rumors of River East, as well as possessing a rich imagination…”</em> Meng Qi continued to chat, all the while suppressing a smile as he slowly dispelled the doubts of Chang Huan and the Taoist nun.</p><p>When it came to the names of genuine locations in the South Sea, he merely relied on the information he had fished out of Xie Xuan and Ouyang Zheng. His descriptions were a mixture of truth and fabrications, yet full of persuasion.</p><p>Their chat was a delightful one. Before anyone knew it, they had already reached Yongzhou. Chang Huan invited Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei to stay in the Courier Hostel and said he would go and invite the Principal of Benzhou. Ouyang Zheng also left for the local Plentinude Sect temple in haste.</p><p>After watching Xie Xuan leave to report at the branch of Darkness Palace in Yongzhou City, Meng Qi stuffed the object in Jiang Zhiwei’s hands.</p><p>“Samsara talisman?” Surprised colored her sharp, introverted pair of eyes as she looked at him.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded gently. “We can only test the waters with the change in the situation. The higher-ups of Plentitude Sect and Darkness Palace might know some backstory to the Plentinude Gate. I fear it’ll spell trouble for us, so this is our protective measure.”</p><p>“Heh, I can escape since I can alter my appearance. I’ll lend you my Samsara talisman. You mustn’t forget to return it in the future.”</p><p>He had only tacked on his final sentence because he knew there was a chance that Jiang Zhiwei, with her soft-heartedness despite her cool exterior, would not accept the talisman and leave him behind to escape.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei, as expected, was reminded of the past and burst out in quiet laughter. “As a high interest loan?”</p><p>Their moods become soft with the past events replaying vividly in their minds. Meng Qi said with a smile, “The sword cases here are rather arcane. Our Precious Weapons of the Nth order have spiritual natures that are eager to protect their owners. The sword ball earlier had merely approached the weapons, but its viciousness is apparent.”</p><p>“Perhaps there’s also blood sacrifice involved in the handing over one’s life to the sword case. Ordinary sword balls should not be behaving this way…” Jiang Zhiwei said, appearing deep in thought. Her expression turned serious as she added, “I’m obviously older than you. Why am I your younger cousin? I should be your elder cousin!”</p><p>Meng Qi gave a dry laugh and said perfunctorily, “I’m older spiritually…”</p><p>“What do you mean you’re older spiritually?”</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the Courier Hostel, several martial artists equipped with sabers and swords stared at the entrance longingly. They hesitated due to the soldiers and human automatons on guard. They had followed Meng Qi and the rest after getting off the carriage.</p><p>Their character would have dictated that they shamelessly enter the hostel to pay Meng Qi a visit or even surrounding the place, so they could gain the impartation of Qi Practitioners. However, the hostel was unusually heavily-guarded at this time. If they made a hasty entry, they might be instantly thrown out.</p><p>“Should we secretly sneak in?” a dark-robed man quietly asked. He had a scar on his forehead.</p><p>Their leader was a woman with decent features but a rather boorish manner. “What will we do if they discover us? If we have Darkness Palace and Divine Sect on our tails, we can only flee to the South Sea.”</p><p>“What’s there to fear? If we miss this opportunity today, who knows if Mister Su and the others will be under patronage in the capital? When word spreads and countless talented martial artists follow suit, what ground do we have to stand on?” a square-jawed young man asked.</p><p>“Exactly!” the man with the scar said. “I’ve had enough of the automaton architects of Darkness Palace and Practitioners of Divine Sect looking down on us! I’m sick of never amounting to anything in my entire life, to run around just to survive!</p><p>“But we still don’t know if Mister Su is really an ancient Qi practitioner…” a petite girl said.</p><p>“Darkness Palace and Divine Sect will definitely clarify the matter. Let’s just wait. Once they’ve confirmed it, we’ll give it a try no matter how dangerous it is!” said a young man with a head of grey hair, appearing comparatively calm.</p><p>“That’s decided then.” The woman who was evidently the leader took a deep breath and suppressed her turbulent emotions.</p><p>…</p><p>In the depths of Darkness Palace, Yongzhou County.</p><p>Chang Huan stood in front of a grey-haired old man.</p><p>The old man was dressed in the robe of Darkness Palace, his breath like a candle in the wind yet it was also oddly brimming with vitality. He exuded danger from every part of him. He was pacing with his hands behind his back, listening to Chang Huan recount his story.</p><p>“Principal, their backgrounds aren’t quite clear. It’s definitely suspicious for them to claim to have the impartation of ancient Qi Practitioners,” Chang Huan said in conclusion.</p><p>The Principal paused in his footsteps and said emotionlessly, “Didn’t Divine Sect of today, except Plentinude Sect, and the remaining two large and other smaller schools suddenly obtain some sect’s impartation and establish their sects? If he’s truly a Qi practitioner, why should we care how he obtains the impartation as long as he joins our Darkness Palace and doesn’t keep it to himself?”</p><p>“What’s crucial right now is confirming their identities as Qi Practitioners as well as strengths. Otherwise, we might just make a fool of ourselves after reporting it.”</p><p>“Principal, I fear that I’m not strong enough to probe them,” Chang Huan said awkwardly.</p><p>“I got it.” The Principal nodded and walked out of the door, hands still behind his back.</p><p>When he reached the side of the door, light and shadow shifted, revealing a huge monster in front of him. It was larger than ten feet, with golden yellow scales lining his back. Divine Sun Stones were its eyes; the essence of Chinese Astrology Jin were its claws. It was a fearsome mechanical dragon!</p><p>Chang Huan found it hard to conceal his envy when he saw the mechanical dragon. One could only obtain the god-like impartation of 36 Secret Devices of Darkness Palace after becoming a Principal!</p><p>The Principal set foot on the golden mechanical dragon and sat in the hollow of its back. Chang Huan hurried to follow suit, climbing onto the back of the dragon.</p><p>The dragon soared high up into the air, penetrating through the clouds and mist as it flew toward the Courier Hostel.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the Courier Hostel, Divine Master Guo who was responsible for defending the city walls wore an expressionless face as he listened to Ouyang Zheng’s report.</p><p>“You said you first met them at the foot of Mount Firemist?” he asked, reiterating.</p><p>Ouyang Zheng could not understand why but replied confidently nevertheless, “Yes.”</p><p>Mount Firemist was right at the coastal area of the South Sea.</p><p>Divine Master Guo nodded. “Leader has personally commanded us to pay attention to any usual activity in the vicinity of Mount Firemist. This can be considered as one. This is your solo contribution. I’ll report this to the higher-ups.”</p><p>Doubt quickly overshadowed the delight that the news brought Ouyang Zheng. “Divine Master, they seem to be interested in seeking refuge with either Darkness Palace or Divine Sect. Do we take them in?”</p><p>“I wonder how much impartation from the Qi Practitioners have they received…” Divine Master Guo who was dressed in a dark blue robe muttered to himself. “I’ll first report this to the Leader and then probe those two. We can’t surrender any advantage to Darkness Palace.”</p><p>As he spoke he fashioned the fingers on his hand into a particular position, leading the clouds under his feet to gather and lift him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
