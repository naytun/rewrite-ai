Where I’m located, there has just been the case of Taishang manifestation spreading the Dao De Jing. Powerful characters are everywhere and there are also many strong forces. They should be taken into consideration…”</p><p>“The Immortal Demon Fairy of Aparagodaniya is secretive and overbearing, controlling many demon kings and deities, and should be regarded as a top force. The Omnipotent Emperor of Beiju State has strong followers and is very close to the Legendary realm. He has gathered many powerful characters and hence also has the making of a top force. Also, King Fuhai and King Fanhai are descendents of an ancient great sage. Not only do they have hope of challenging the Legendary realm, they are in control of the marine family, could they be considered?” someone nicknamed Donghai Dragon King expressed his views, intentionally pointing out two unqualified demon deities, King Fuhai and King Fanhai, hoping to cause the dissatisfaction of top forces who would feel ashamed of being placed in the same category as them and hence destroy them.</p><p>After studying the Myriad World Talisman intensively for a long time, the old Dragon King finally knew how to surf the internet…</p><p>As for the doings of the heavenly lord from the Jade Mirage Palace, he didn’t find it strange. Influential and powerful characters paid great attention to karma. His behavior might seem strange but could be a compensation.</p><p>Unfortunately, the discussion turned into a fierce battle once it started, such that his and Childe Yu’s comments were quickly buried and did not manage to cause any ripples.</p><p>…</p><p>At Kunlun Mountain Jade Mirage Palace, when Meng Qi stepped into the room, Daqinggen was facing the window with cold wind blowing on him, staring into space and looking as though he had lost interest in life. The room was filled with all sorts of strange items, such that one had almost no space to walk.</p><p>“Aren’t you just a plant, why did you buy these for?” Meng Qi couldn’t help but admonish, twitching the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Daqinggen said in a faintly discernible tone, “I’m thinking of this profound question right now…”</p><p>Suddenly, it shouted, “The Myriad World Mall is toxic! It’s toxic!”</p><p>Sounding agitated and all psyched up, Daqinggen’s branches which had obviously reduced in number danced around as it complained about the Myriad World Mall filled with temptations.</p><p>A short while later, he collected himself a little and realized in front of him was his own master and started to panic, “Master, you, you’re back so fast? I, I’ll go tidy up first.”</p><p>Meng Qi pondered for a while and said, “Since you hate the Myriad World Mall so much, how about sealing the related functions of your Myriad World Talisman?”</p><p>Daqinggen’s expression changed a few times before he said clenching his teeth, “Sure!”</p><p>“Thank you for helping, master!”</p><p>Meng Qi casually waved, sealing the shopping function of the Myriad World Talisman before taking out an item that originated from the Afflatus King’s treasury and gave a portion of it to Daqinggen, “You’ve fulfilled your duties quite well in charge of Jade Mirage Express during this period and did not abuse the authority given to you by the Myriad World Knowledge Ball. This is your reward.”</p><p>Daqinggen’s eyes burst with colors and he knelt down suddenly, grabbing Meng Qi’s thigh, “Master, I’m overwhelmed by your kindness! I won’t hesitate to do anything for you in the future!”</p><p>Meng Qi pulled his leg away without any expression on his face, gave some instructions before walking into the Jade Mirage Palace.</p><p>Daqinggen was already in high spirits and humming a song. It raised its branch in a candid manner and took out the Myriad World Talisman.</p><p>Suddenly, the branch froze right there. Daqinggen’s expression changed again before its branches flew around wildly, slapping itself while it mumbled, “You and your foul mouth! Why did you get the Myriad World Mall sealed!”</p><p>It paced back and forth anxiously before an idea suddenly struck him and he opened his address book. “My disciple, quick! Help me buy something!”</p><p>…</p><p>The lotuses bloomed once again, filling the entire pond with freshness and fragrance. Meng Qi stopped beside the pond and observed quietly for a long time before letting out a sigh and returned to the meditation room, sitting on the low bed.</p><p>Before returning to the Jade Mirage Palace, he had gone back to the west again to search for the last Sea Calming Pearl but to no avail, because the clue came to a sudden stop at a place suspected to be a gap of the netherworld.</p><p>The Sea Calming Pearl might be hidden in a secluded place in the netherworld.</p><p>Forming a mudra sign with his hands that was each holding half of the Haotian Mirror fragment, Meng Qi shut his eyes. His surroundings immediately turned into darkness – the kind that had layers of universe hidden in it.</p><p>His consciousness fell into the Haotian Mirror fragment, wandering in the boundless void.</p><p>This was the road that one must pass to reach the Legendary realm.</p><p>From a celestial to Legendary realm was another gateway of improving oneself whereby the difficulty was much higher than from Exterior realm to Dharmakaya, and one would be able to overlook the real world. Two requirements had to be met in order to have a breakthrough. One was to upgrade oneself so as to complete the soul and sense the additional self, communicate with and include them in order to build links. After the number of the connected additional self reached the limit of qualitative change, one would be considered as having met the precondition. Second was to have a clear understanding of the established self and I am who I am, otherwise there would be chaos when the additional self returned to the body.</p><p>Both were very difficult for a celestial being, as could be seen by the contrast between the abundance of celestial officials and the number of Legendary characters. Most celestial beings were unable to improve their level further and also did not possess treasures like the Haotian Mirror, hence unable to send their additional self and did not even know how to go about attaining the Legendary realm. A small number of them were unable to see their true selves or understand I am who I am, hence dared not let the number of the additional self accumulate in case it backfired. Only a rare few celestial beings were able to fulfill these two requirements and enter Legendary realm, taking up the challenge and completing the change before becoming a unique mighty character of the various worlds.</p><p>After the incident regarding Meng Xiaoqi (fake Meng Qi) on Earth, Meng Qi vaguely reached the entry barrier of seeing his true self and understanding I am who I am. As for the number of the additional self, he had cut away the past and did not have an additional self by normal definition, hence could only use his self-created stamp or collect the projection of Yuanshi to complete it.</p><p>I shall not be too anxious in collecting the projection of Yuanshi for now, I shall create a few additional self imprints first to reach a balance. Meng Qi had his own way of thinking, searching for a balance instead of letting himself become another Heavenly Lord Yuanshi. However, my additional self imprint has to be near the projection of the devil Buddha in that universe in order to be imprinted between heaven and earth, but I do not know all the projections of the Devil Buddhas in different universes, so I have to attempt bit by bit, which is really troublesome.</p><p>Something suddenly struck Meng Qi when he thought of this, because he also knew an exact projection of the Devil Buddha!</p><p>Master Yuanmeng who let him get the second Little Jade Buddha, Master Yuanmeng of the World of the God of Twelve Forms!</p><p>I shall not bother about other things for now. What’s most important now is to transform this projection into an additional self imprint. Meng Qi opened his eyes, his hand holding a Myriad World Talisman.</p><p>That world is too fragile to him now and he couldn’t go there directly. Luckily the Great Illusion Skill had helped him many times and had much karma.</p><p>With a gentle flick of his right hand, the Myriad World Talisman fell silently and disappeared into the void before him.</p><p>…</p><p>In a quiet thatched cottage, Duan Xiangfei looked lean and elegant, but his brows and beard were white, looking weighed down with age.</p><p>Watching the middle-aged-looking Duan Mingcheng in front of him, he sighed and said, “Although I got to know about the mystery of the Nine Apertures of Heaven from Master Zhending, my body had already declined then and was unable to get the treasure with just the method alone. It seems like I lack the power to become an immortal. Now that my time is almost up, I can only pin my hopes on you and my grandchildren.”</p><p>Hearing his father’s heartfelt words, Duan Mingcheng was suddenly overcome by sadness. In his eyes, his father was a great guru of the world, a very wise man who had won countless powerful enemies and completed countless plans. But such a character still lost to time in the end.</p><p>Was his father giving his last words before his death?</p><p>Duan Mingcheng was about to speak when a light flashed across his eyes. He saw a thin silver object descending from the sky, hitting Duan Xiangfei’s head straight away.</p><p>“A hidden weapon!” Duan Mingcheng blurted out.</p><p>Seeing stars, Duan Xiangfei stretched his hand and caught the metal sheet before seeing layers of illusion before his eyes. He actually saw a beautiful and spiritual mountain with a temple named Jade Mirage Palace on top of it.</p><p>Inside the Jade Mirage Palace, a man in a Taoist robe was sitting on a low bed. He had handsome features and graying temples. Around him was a vast starry sky, as though he was the ruler of the world.</p><p>Feeling a sense of familiarity, Duan Xiangfei suddenly recalled the person he could never forget. It’s him!</p><p>His thought has just sprung up when he saw the man in Taoist robe open his eyes. His eyes were deep with chaotic light as he looked at him across infinite space and galaxies!</p><p>Duan Mingcheng was on alert, searching for the assassin, only realizing after a long time that his father was in a daze. He quickly whispered a few words to him.</p><p>Duan Xiangfei came out of his trance, stroke his beard and got up smilingly, “Mingcheng, accompany me to Changhua Temple.”</p><p>He was brimming with energy and gone was his decadence.</p><p>Seeing his father who was waiting for death full of vitality now, Duan Mingcheng blurted in shock, “Father, why do you suddenly have the fighting spirit again?”</p><p>Duan Xiangfei laughed, “I suddenly felt that I can still be saved.”</p><p>Taking big steps in his flowy robe, he went straight to Changhua Temple.</p><p>Duan Mingcheng was clearly confused, catching up only after staring blankly for a moment.</p><p>…</p><p>No words were exchanged along the way. After they reached Changhua Temple, Duan Xiangfei placed his hands behind his back and said slowly, “Mingcheng, do you know the reason why I came here?”</p><p>“To pay homage to Master Zhending?” Duan Mingcheng guessed hesitantly.</p><p>“No.” Duan Xiangfei chuckled, “I’ve figured out one thing.”</p><p>“What is it?” Duan Mingcheng asked ignorantly.</p><p>They were standing at the door, crowded with people and many pilgrims.</p><p>Duan Xiangfei slowly stepped forward, “I’ve figured out why Master Zhending returned and came to Changhua Temple after gaining immortality.”</p><p>Master Zhending? Many pilgrims and monks stopped to listen – this was the most renowned character in the past few decades.</p><p>“Isn’t it a Buddhism secret?” Duan Mingcheng was still puzzled.</p><p>Duan Xiangfei said smilingly, “No, he had to come, and had no other choice. He could only truly understand his established self and attain a higher level after coming here.”</p><p>Many pairs of ears erected.</p><p>“Father, could you explain further?” Duan Mingcheng frowned.</p><p>Duan Xiangfei stepped over the sill and lamented, “Because he was Master Yuanmeng’s reincarnation!”</p><p>His shocking words had the monks and pilgrims stare blankly at one another.</p><p>Before Duan Mingcheng could ask further, Duan Xiangfei continued, “There is no other explanation why Master Zhending was so well-versed in martial arts and Buddhism at such a young age.”</p><p>“There is no other explanation why the Little Jade Buddha given to me by Master Yuanmeng ended up in the hands of Master Zhending.”</p><p>“There is no other explanation for Master Yuanmeng’s last words, ‘Where is the Spirited Mountain’.”</p><p>“Where is the Spirited Mountain, of course it’s in the heart, in one’s self!”</p><p>The series of words made Duan Mingcheng feel a chill down his spine. After thinking carefully, he felt that this was truly possible – using his father’s hand to enlighten one’s own reincarnation showed true implication of Buddhism!</p><p>After finding the Spirited Mountain, one would naturally see Buddha!</p><p>Who is Buddha? Buddha is one’s self!</p><p>Such powerful words made the monks come to a realization, silently agreeing to Duan Xiangfei’s judgement.</p><p>Duan Xiangfei looked at the situation around him and smiled, “Mingcheng, spread what I said just now and donate a golden-bodied statue of Master Yuanmeng to Changhua Temple.”</p><p>“Yes,” Duan Mingcheng dared not defy and quickly got down to it.</p><p>Looking at his back view, Duan Xiangfei let out a low laugh and mumbled to the air in front of him, “Satisfied?”</p><p>Right after saying this, he heard a loud jingle, “Your Primitive Emperor Coins have been received!”</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the Jade Mirage Palace, Daqinggen suddenly came and reported to Meng Qi, “Master, the abbess of Shuiyue Nunnery seeks an audience with you.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
