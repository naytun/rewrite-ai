This is being greedy, the Heavenly Lord would not like it.”</p><p>No one would adore someone who did not know when to move on or back off!</p><p>Wu Ju was shocked, then put his thumb up and complimented, “Brother Gan, little brother admires you for being able to triumph over greed. However, I’ll teach you this tactical formation, in case you need it in the future.”</p><p>“I appreciate such kind act,” Gan Ruoxu thanked him.</p><p>Wu Ju took out a paper and a pencil, sketched the tactical formation, wrote down the seal script, and explained the annotations. He was doing his best to teach Gan Ruoxu.</p><p>As Gan Ruoxu was listening, he was stunned because the seal script was very familiar with the restrictive spell symbol beneath the Premier Priest in his meditation!</p><p>Could it be that Heavenly Lord intended to give me treasure? His heart was overflowing with joy.</p><p>As Wu Ju was getting deep into the explanation, Gan Ruoxu was more certain and made up his mind that once he arrived at the National Guard Temple of the capital city, he would immediately start the tactical formation.</p><p>As he was contemplating, Sun Gan walked in. He said with a serious tone, “Leader Gan, that assassin was a patrol inspector of the Yellow Turbanism from Taiping Nation, the archenemy of our National Guard Temple. He ploughed around for information after coincidentally watching you obtain the blessing from the Heavenly Lord on that day, hence, purposely came here to assassinate you.”</p><p>Yellow Turbanism? Gan Ruoxu nodded lightly, he was not unfamiliar with this name.</p><p>Afters years and years of propaganda by the Blessed Nation, Yellow Turbanism was being seen as Heretic Evil Demons by the public. Back then, they were under the branch of Taiping Spur with the National Guard Temple. Although Yellow Sky replaced Ether, the people of Yellow Sky respected and admired the Earth Goddess of Yellow Sky, which was also known as High Heaven. On the other hand, the Yellow Sky of the Yellow Turbanism admired Central Yellow Taiyi, which was also the Eastern Emperor Taiyi, thus, they became their archenemy.</p><p>“I think that we cannot delay our trip anymore, we should just cross the river without the team. We shall continue our departure without rest to reach Master Jing, and I will protect the leader,” Sun Gan provided a suggestion.</p><p>Gan Ruoxu did not dare to take the risk with his life. He glanced at Wu Ju, nodded to indicate that he agreed with Sun Gan.</p><p>…</p><p>After days and nights of traveling without any troubles on their way, Sun Gan finally managed to send Gan Ruoxu to the National Guard Temple located in the east of the capital city.</p><p>There were pine trees and cypresses that were green all year round, and cranes dancing in the breeze like the Land of Cockaigne. A middle-aged Taoist that had a wooden hairpin in his hair was standing straight at the doorway waiting for them.</p><p>He had cool and bright features, with outstanding elegance. He was the temple master of the National Guard Temple, Xu Jingxu. He connected with fourth-ranked South Star Hall in the Chart of Deities Achievement Ranking.</p><p>Behind Xu Jingxu was a smart-looking girl. She was his niece, and also the disciple who would be his direct descendant. She was Xu Feixiang, who connected with Fairy Chang Er last year.</p><p>“As someone whom the Three Pristine Patriarchs showed themselves to and earned the blessing of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi, I’m very honored to have you at my temple here.” Seeing Gan Ruoxu, Xu Jingxu spoke with a smile, “It is true that the younger generation will surpass the older.”</p><p>Facing someone who had practiced for so many years, Gan Ruoxu dared not show the slightest of inadvertence. He bowed, “Greetings, Master Xu.”</p><p>Xu Jingxu nodded slightly, and turned to Sun Gan, “Thank you for your hard work, Chief Sun. Please take some rest, you will be rewarded in the temple.”</p><p>“Master, you are exaggerating. I’m just performing my responsibility, why do I need any reward?” Sun Gan responded modestly, as he entered the National Guard Temple before others.</p><p>Once there were no more outsiders, Xu Jingxu smiled, “Please follow me to the Three Pristines Temple, Gan. After worshiping Three Pristine Patriarchs and the previous patriarchs, you will be considered as a part of the National Guard Temple.”</p><p>On their way, Xu Feixiang was smiling winsomely while talking about issues and legends in the temple, helping to calm Gan Ruoxu who was slightly nervous and made him feel more comfortable.</p><p>Once they stepped into the Three Pristines Temple, Gan Ruoxu’s sight was fixated at the top statue of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi that stood between the statues of Lord Ling Bao and Lord Dao De. It was different from the previous statue, its handsome features, hair that was slightly grayish, deep eyes filled with vicissitudes… it looked exactly the same as the one he saw in his connection, the only difference was that the green robe was too simple yet elegant, it seemed not suitable for occasions of worshipping. God Master was still wearing its attire which was primitively simple but solemn.</p><p>As soon as Gan Ruoxu made eye contact with the statue of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi, he suddenly felt like teleporting from the temple to the starry sky. The green smoke that was spiralling up made everything appear to be blurry, deep, and serene; it was like the boundary between the mortals and the immortals.</p><p>Gan Ruoxu’s expression became solemn unconsciously. Gan Ruoxu had completed the introduction ceremony under the guidance of Xu Jingxu in front of all the elders. Then according to Xu Jingxu’s order, he isolated himself in the Three Pristines Temple and started connecting with Heavenly Lord Yuanshi, polishing his direct knowledge, and increased his strength as soon as possible.</p><p>Dazzlingly, as if losing the concept of time, Gan Ruoxu could only feel that the Premier Priest in his mind was getting closer and closer to the first time he connected with the Premier Priest, that sometimes, it would turn into the image of a Green Robed Priest.</p><p>Knock, knock, knock!</p><p>Suddenly, the sound of knocking resounded in Gan Ruoxu’s ears, he thought for a second, then asked with a clear voice, “Who is it?”</p><p>“Brother Gan, have you finished your isolated practice?” Wu Ju’s surprise voice traveled from the crack between the doors.</p><p>Gan Ruoxu smiled, “Yes, I just finished. When did you arrive?”</p><p>He stretched his arm, his palm turned dark and the door opened by itself without the movement of wind.</p><p>“It’s been almost half a month already. I would knock on the door every few days to see if Brother Gan was done with the isolated practice. No, I should call you Senior Brother instead,” Wu Ju revealed a fatigued smile.</p><p>“Senior Brother?” Gan Ruoxu was dumbfounded.</p><p>Wu Ju tagged along behind Xu Feixiang who smiled brightly, “According to the rules of the National Guard Temple, the order of disciples is arranged according to the ascending order of entering the temple, but Senior Brother is an exception. This is the title of the disciple who will take over the National Guard Temple in the future.”</p><p>“Congratulations, Big Senior Brother! Congratulations, Senior Brother!” Wu Ju added.</p><p>At that moment, Gan Ruoxu directed his gaze to the door outside as he heard an arrogant tone saying, “We’re here to visit Senior Brother!”</p><p>Behind Wu Ju and Xu Feixiang was a gang of disciples of the National Guard Temple. The one who led them was wearing a black Taoist robe. He tied his hair high up with his facial features visibly showed immaturity as he brimmed with arrogance.</p><p>“Brother Lin…” Wu Ju greeted softly, and quickly turned his head to make eye contact with Gan Ruoxu. Xu Feixiang then spoke, “This is Brother Lin, Lin Fengxiao that connected with the Great Emperor Zhenwu.”</p><p>The favorite of the Black Emperor? The previous Senior Brother? Gan Ruoxu suddenly caught on to something. He initially wanted to stand up to greet him, but after seeing his expression, the teenager decided to remain in his position, facing the statue of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi with his back.</p><p>Lin Fengxiao did not enter the temple. He stood at the gateway and coldly said, “It’s very admirable for Senior Brother to be able to obtain favor of the Three Pristines of Daode Tianzun. I, as a younger brother am quite curious about the strength of God Master’s direct knowledge, so I would like to request for you to demonstrate to us.”</p><p>Wu Ju immediately stopped him, “Senior Brother’s direct knowledge is very deadly, since we’re like brothers to each other, let’s not harm each other.”</p><p>He was inherently timid, he dared not cause any trouble.</p><p>“Why not, I’ll die with no regrets if I can see it with my own eyes,” Lin Fengxiao’s glance was burning, staring directly at Gan Ruoxu.</p><p>Gan Ruoxu was merely a sixteen-year-old teenager. He smiled and answered, “Please, Brother Lin.”</p><p>The juniors from the National Guard Temple following Lin Fengxiao spread out immediately, and looked with anticipation at the hall. They were well-versed with the strength of the Art of Blackwater and the gifted ability of Brother Lin so they were quite confident in him. Although they were confident, they still felt uneasy as he was facing directly with the favorite of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi.</p><p>As Lin Fengxiao took a step forward, a shadow suddenly appeared behind him. It was the snake and the tortoise from an ancient legend, the snake wrapped around the tortoise, surrounded by black water, and above it stood a blurry statue of the majestic Great Emperor Zhenwu.</p><p>Fizz! Black water appeared out of thin air in the Three Pristines Temple, drop by drop, just like the ocean. The Yin fluids seeped into the temple. Unexpectedly, Gan Ruoxu was not able to change the Yin and Yang, reversing the life and death.</p><p>So powerful!</p><p>This thought sparked in Gan Ruoxu’s mind. He desperately tried to connect with Heavenly Lord Yuanshi.</p><p>Lin Fengxiao raised his hand, and the snake spurted out black liquid like an arrow toward Gan Ruoxu. Gan Ruoxu was still sitting with his legs crossed, without any movement, as if he was completely stunned.</p><p>“Brother Gan!” Wu Ju shouted in shock.</p><p>Right at that moment, he saw a silhouette appear behind Gan Ruoxu. It had a green robe, handsome features, grayish hair, and deep eyes eyes filled with vicissitudes, it looked the same as the statue of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi!</p><p>Heavenly Lord Yuanshi!</p><p>Heavenly Lord Yuanshi!</p><p>The disciples of the national guard temple bowed, one by one.</p><p>Gan Ruoxu closed his eyes, raised his right hand, and the green-robed priest with the image of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi behind him raised his right hand, too, even the statue of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi at the most bottom row also started to shake. The Three Pristines Temple suddenly became deep and black, just like before heaven and earth was opened up. The massive amount of black water disappeared, and the black fluid that penetrated through Gan Ruoxu did not have any reaction.</p><p>Everything had gone back to normal. Lin Fengxiao was standing at the doorway, his expression changed. After some time, he gnashed his teeth,</p><p>“Thanks for Senior Brother’s teaching.”</p><p>He turned and walked away once he was done speaking.</p><p>“Senior Brother, you’re getting better and better!” Wu Ju cheered with his thumb up.</p><p>Gan Ruoxu stood up and smiled, “It’s all thanks to the God Master. Now we can try the tactical formation.”</p><p>“What tactical formation?” Xu Feixiang asked curiously.</p><p>“A tactical formation that opens the gateway and allows one to receive blessings,” Gan Ruoxu explained.</p><p>Wu Ju quickly replied, “Sure, sure, sure!”</p><p>He wondered what would the bestowed item of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi would be.</p><p>…</p><p>Xu Feixiang and Wu Ju, two experts arranged the tactical formation under the cover of late night.</p><p>Gan Ruoxu completed the praying fire sacrificial ceremony, then stood by the side of the tactical formation. He began to think about the face of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi as he recited softly,</p><p>“O Great and Divine Heavenly Lord Yuanshi…”</p><p>Rays of white light began to shine, and the tactical formation turned into a starry sky. Then a star struck through the silent sky, and landed in the middle.</p><p>Gan Ruoxu looked at it. It was an ancient stone tablet, written with seven huge words, ‘Kill’, on it. Other than that, nothing seemed extraordinary.</p><p>“What treasure is this?” Wu Ju asked as he came close.</p><p>Gan Ruoxu shook his head in confusion. He picked up the stone tablet, but once the stone tablet came in contact with him, it went through his body, in between his brows.</p><p>“Looks like I have to examine it,” Gan Ruoxu was contemplating.</p><p>It must be extraordinary if it was gifted by the God Master!</p><p>Seeing that Gan Ruoxu was able to gain a treasure, Xu Feixiang was lively and asked happily, “Can I try, too?”</p><p>Although there was some similar tactical formations in the temple, the master always said she was not good enough to use it, so he forbade her from using it.</p><p>“Sure,” Wu Ju and Gan Ruoxu were curious of what kind of treasure she would be getting as well.</p><p>Xu Feixiang stood in front of the tactical formation, and began to think about Fairy Chang Er. Slowly but surely, the temple became a starry sky. A bright, round moon began to rise up, its glow shone around the temple.</p><p>The light was changing, the silver moon began to fall, a silhouette began to appear, it appeared to be cool, and was carrying a Guqin.</p><p>Xu Feixiang, Wu Ju and Gan Ruoxu could not close their jaws, there was only one thought in their mind,</p><p>Fairy Chang Er does not gift any treasure; she comes directly to the mortal realm!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
