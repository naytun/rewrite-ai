Was it because they were not wise enough, or was it the difference in temperament that caused the Primitive Emperor’s regret and despair?</p><p>Although there was still a sense of confusion and uneasiness, they were facing one of the most respected mighty people among the realms, so they decided not to ask about it and waited anxiously.</p><p>Moments later, they noticed that the Primitive Emperor folded his arms at the back, took two strides and said calmly, “You two have flown up to Heaven from the lower realm and coincidentally come to my Kunlun Mountain, I would consider this as fate.”</p><p>Flew up to Heaven from the lower realm? These few words were like bolts of thunder, blasting inside the hearts of Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu until they could hear it ringing in their minds. The secret that they were both trying hard to keep suddenly seemed insignificant.</p><p>But on second thought, he was the king among all of the Primitive Fairies and possessed vast direct knowledge and unlimited celestial power, how could he have not known the abnormal events happening in Kunlun Mountain?</p><p>It would be more unusual if he did not know that the both of them came from the lower realm!</p><p>Just as both of them were settling down their emotions, they saw billions of light rays shining in Primitive Emperor Su Meng’s hand. They were golden yellow in color, congealing into a golden lotus. The golden lotus then collapsed and shrunk into a golden book. The material felt light but it was not an illusion, it was indeed real.</p><p>Creation From Void? Creation From Void! Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu’s eyes were uncontrollably wide open. With the help of the Myriad World Talisman, they naturally understood some extraordinary abilities.</p><p>Creation From Void was one of them!</p><p>According to records in traditional books, in order to use the Creation From Void which violates the Principle of Nature and common logic, even the Legendary level of control could only hit the basics. More importantly, the comprehension of creation exceeded Dharma and was more toward Da Dao. That was also one of the reasons why the realm where the Great Medium resided was known as the Creation Realm.</p><p>Had the Primitive Emperor Su Meng overcome the last obstacle in the Sea of Sufferings?</p><p>Meng Qi smiled faintly and said, “There are still some differences between changing a substance and the actual Creation From Void.”</p><p>As he spoke, he threw the golden book over, “These are the Orifices-Point Activation Stage Section and Exterior Section of the Premier Golden Stamp and the Arts of Eight-Nine. You may decide which study to practice. If you have any questions, use the Myriad World Talisman to find this number and join a martial arts social group called Jade Mirage Followers, just tell them your name.”</p><p>Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu’s faces were glowing, and as they were about to kneel down and worship, Meng Qi waved his hand and said, “For the time being, only your names are recorded in Jade Mirage, and just call me Teacher. You’ve just entered the Real World, so go traveling and exploring. Come back after three years to take the examination, and see whether you can officially be listed on the Sect Wall.”</p><p>Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu were not at all disappointed, instead, they were joyous and excited. It was not easy to enter the sacred land of Taoism and the Fairy Cave. Of course, they needed to write down their names, explore, and take the examination!</p><p>“Thank you, Teacher Immortal!” both of them bowed together in sync.</p><p>Meng Qi looked deeply at them and flicked his finger. A ball of blurry light flew out and broke into two pieces, each burrowing in between Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu’s eyebrows. Then, words and pictures blasted out of nowhere, and it appeared to be a secret scripture.</p><p>“This is a Spiritual Spell that I have gotten by meditating to understand from the Trailokyavijaya Divinity at the Buddhist Society. It can cultivate spiritual sense that reflects on yourself and also others. Once your practice deepens, you should be together to activate the Qi Ji. You will also be able to recall memories from past Samsara, as a foundation to comprehend who am I, I am who,” Meng Qi’s voice sounded ethereal.</p><p>Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu were vibrating because of the improved Biantian Jidi Conjuration. They were so caught up with it that they found it inextricable. When they were finally awake, everything outside the window was gone, not a deity was found. It was no different from the loneliness as before.</p><p>If it was not for the golden book in their hands, and their minds filled with spells, both of them would suspect that it was all just a dream.</p><p>But the entire situation was more unbelievable than a dream!</p><p>The most they could dream about was finally finding the Jade Palace deep inside Kunlun Mountain and having celestial fate. How would they dare to have wished for the Primitive Emperor, Immortal Su himself to come and meet them?</p><p>The one and only among the many realms, the mightiest person in the Legendary Realm who was known as the king of all fairies had arrived!</p><p>As he took a deep breath, Yu Banshan turned toward the direction of Kunlun Mountain and bowed earnestly, “Thank you, Teacher Immortal, I will never dishonor the name of Jade Mirage.”</p><p>After Qi Jinxiu went along with the worship, she caressed the golden book as she tried to recall the Spiritual Spell. She could not help but smile and said, “We were always told that the act of kindness across nine lives can lead to a joyous and prosperous life. Banshan, imagine how many lives of kindness we must’ve done in the past to possess such great celestial fate.”</p><p>Yu Banshan smiled and nodded, “Let’s hope that we don’t waste this celestial fate.”</p><p>Both of them were so filled with excitement that they got restless. Continuously, they kept reminiscing the past and dreaming about the future. Half a day had already passed when they finally calmed down. They opened the golden book and browsed through the Premier Golden Stamp and the Arts of Eight-Nine.</p><p>“Banshan, you’ve just started on the exterior, it seems like you need the materials from Heaven and treasures from Earth to practice…” Qi Jinxiu furrowed her brows as she looked at the exterior sections of the two arts.</p><p>They were dumbfounded by the materials from Heaven and treasures from Earth needed for the Arts of Eight-Nine. Without the support of a sect or having a huge fortune, they could only collect them little by little. Who knows when they could finally complete the Two Levels of Heaven practice at the beginning of the exterior section. The Premier Golden Stamp, however, was alright. Although different materials from Heaven and treasures from Earth were required for different practices, the Arts of Eight Nine was comparatively harder.</p><p>Yu Banshan said in a low voice, “I wonder if these materials from Heaven and treasures from Earth would be easy or hard to find…”</p><p>Qi Jinxiu’s eyes sparkled as she chuckled, “Banshan, I think I saw it through the Myriad World Access, I remember there is something like a mall there.”</p><p>As she was talking, she took out the Myriad World Talisman.</p><p>Once they entered the mall, Qi Jinxiu was astonished by the various and uncommon array of goods. Despite the fact that they spent a huge amount of time browsing through and comparing the products, they felt satisfied, as if they had made a major breakthrough.</p><p>“The materials from Heaven and treasures from Earth are limited, and based on the belongings that we have currently, I don’t think we can afford any of them…” Qi Jinxiu finally let out a sigh.</p><p>Yu Banshan was already done browsing. He shook his head and smiled, “Everything is a challenge, the process of gathering the materials from Heaven and treasures from Earth can also be a type of training. This is the real reason why the Teacher Immortal asked us to travel for three years. Of course, I still prefer the Premier Golden Stamp.”</p><p>“The Orifices-Point Activation Stage skills of the Arts of Eight-Nine are limited, I’ll choose the Premier Golden Stamp as well,” said Qi Jinxiu as she nodded.</p><p>Seeing that his wife had decided, Yu Banshan smiled and said, “Once our possessions are traded in for Primitive Emperor Coins, it would be just enough to buy the elixirs and weapons needed for your practice. We should settle yours first.”</p><p>Seeing that Yu Banshan had already made up his mind, Qi Jinxiu did not refuse. Both of them finished their shopping swiftly and proudly selected Jade Mirage Express as an act of support toward their own sect’s industries.</p><p>It’s just so expensive… Qi Jinxiu said to herself.</p><p>Right at this moment, a light ray flashed, and a little green bottle labeled with the name of the elixir they had bought appeared on the table right in front of them.</p><p>“That was fast…” both of them were dumbfounded.</p><p>Communication speed was already fast, but product delivery, too?</p><p>No wonder the Jade Mirage Express was so expensive!</p><p>Both of them were shocked and excited at the same time, since the powerful Jade Palace was their Master Sect now!</p><p>After a while, Qi Jinxiu kept away the elixir bottle and muttered, “Banshan, where are we going next?”</p><p>Yu Banshan gave it a thought and blurted, “Changle City of the Great Zhou Dynasty isn’t too far away from here, and it is the capital of the world, how can we miss it?”</p><p>…</p><p>Their journey was smooth, and they went on and on until they arrived at the Great Zhou Kingdom, the city of Changle.</p><p>Before entering the city, they were astounded by the tall buildings and the crowds of people jostling around. Even more shockingly, the left side of the city stood a thousand feet tall altar. It was divided into nine floors, carved with various stars and different kinds of celestial beings. It was utterly attractive and eye-catching.</p><p>The sacrificial altar was surrounded by five other smaller altars which were red, green, yellow, white, and black, as if they were embraced together. It looked magnificent. Besides, lights can be seen exiting and entering repeatedly, like it was building and refining something.</p><p>“This is…” Qi Jinxiu had never seen such celestial buildings before, she was, for a moment, lost for words.</p><p>A stranger beside them overheard her and with the Changle dialect, spoke to them proudly, “This is the Heaven Conferring Platform!”</p><p>“Heaven Conferring Platform?” Yu Banshan had heard about it before from the Myriad World Access.</p><p>The stranger laughed, “Yes! The heavenly-conferred platform by humanity!”</p><p>“The Son of Heaven used the emperor’s ancient studies as reference, according to it, this building is built and refined by the people of the Legendary Realm and the immortals. The surrounding five smaller altars represent the Five Wisdom Emperors to pay tribute to humanity. Once the building is completed, all of the Celestial Officials and Celestial Deities will be conferred a title by the Emperor, by grading and by strength. The level of sacrificial ceremony to be held will be solely depending on the choice of the Great Zhou Dynasty.”</p><p>“If you wish to receive deification after death, to become one of the celestial beings and to possess the power to control Heaven and Earth, you have to pledge your loyalty to the Great Zhou Dynasty and follow the emperor!”</p><p>He said ever so proudly, but Yu Banshan was overwhelmed by his words. The introduction from the Myriad World Access was rather vague, so he did not understand much of it. Now that he had heard the details, he was indeed shocked.</p><p>Conquering the world using humanity and conferring titles to the Celestial Officials sounded really beneficial, but the people would just watch the current emperor achieve this task?</p><p>Even if the Heavenly Court dropped from the sky today, will the Buddhists, the Luo and Demonic Sects allow the Great Zhou Dynasty to conquer the world using humanity?</p><p>Somehow, Yu Banshan had a bad feeling about this matter.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
