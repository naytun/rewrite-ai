It fiercely broke the ocean of flame and tore the void apart before it hit accurately on the Golden Light, almost flesh-colored, huge palm of the Buddha.</p><p>A loud bang resonated across the atmosphere.</p><p>The Golden Light, that was concealing Spirited Mountain, was shattered into bits. It was immediately swept away by the disrupted void and turned into ashes, leaving completely no remnants. The Buddha’s Palm that vanquished Glow, Phoenix Demonic Deity, and the others, had now vanished into thin air.</p><p>Glow, who tried to stand up with all his strength, was dumbfounded. Then, astonishment, surprise, and excitement were displayed on his face. While his eyes were misted with tears, he said,</p><p>“The Great Sage Equaling Heaven?”</p><p>The Great Sage Equaling Heaven, who had been a legend for many years for the demon race, had returned!</p><p>He did not fall into Spirited Mountain!</p><p>At this very moment, all the ego and pride of Glow disappeared. It was as though he had turned back time to become the innocent and young little phoenix, listening attentively to the elders as they narrated the legacy of the Great Sage Equaling Heaven. He used to imagine the charisma of the demon race’s greatest hero and felt sorry for him to have fallen into Spirited Mountain in order to save the remaining great sages.</p><p>Today, he saw the return of the Golden Cudgel’s owner and witnessed the huge furry arm of the golden monkey. As he listened to the loud cry from Lao Sun, Glow felt as though he had become part of the legendary tale and fulfilled his childhood dream.</p><p>He was his senior and someone he adored immensely!</p><p>How could he possibly be arrogant in front of the Great Sage Equaling Heaven?</p><p>“The Great Sage Equaling Heaven!” the egoistic Taili looked unusually excited, too. Ever since the Battle of Spirited Mountain, the name of the Great Sage Equaling Heaven had become well known to every tribe of the demon race. As newer generations emerged among the demon race, he became a role model and inspiring idol for the budding elite members. His status was what they yearned for.</p><p>His initial intention was to rescue the remaining great sages. No one had expected the strongest man to have survived and further live on his legacy!</p><p>The five colors, namely red, green, yellow, white, and black, rotated. The colors rippled before it was wiped off, indicating Taili’s emotions.</p><p>Qingqiu the Little Fox, Raka the Kirin Demonic Deity, and No Thoughts the Great Roc Demonic Deity showed similar reactions. Regardless of how rebellious the Great Sage Equaling Heaven used to be, he was as merciless as the other members of the demon race. To have sacrificed and rescued the other great sages of the demon race, his biography had been glorified and turned into a legend. He was the most renowned demon of all time!</p><p>Meng Qi’s facial expression changed. He, who was supposed to be involved in the battle using the Nether Skeleton, the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade, and his martial arts skills, now seemed to be lost, to the extent that his face could be an emoji for the communication tool of the Myriad World Access.</p><p>Fuck, where did the Great Sage Equaling Heaven come from?</p><p>He was constantly curious about the whereabouts of the Great Sage Equaling Heaven every time he visited the Spirited Mountain. Has he turn into ashes? Has he been rescued? Who rescued him? Why did he leave only his Golden Cudgel behind and never appear again? Now, the Great Sage Equaling Heaven reappeared unexpectedly after the escape of the monster at the back of Spirited Mountain.</p><p>This entire scene felt like a chess game of two players.</p><p>Of course, he was not the player. Along the Pilgrimage to the West, one of the players had to be Lord Dao De!</p><p>The Golden Emperor had probably foreseen this when he ordered Sha Wujing to carry the mysterious corpse out of the Thousand Buddha Formation. Otherwise, after constantly being active for a long time, why would he choose this specific timing after Spirited Mountain had fallen for a long time?</p><p>He was obviously afraid that the monster from the back of the mountain would absorb the mysterious corpse.</p><p>Maybe he was trying to propel the progress and hoped to create the current scenario when he finally allowed the Luo Sect to reveal the method of entering the Spirited Mountain to the demon race.</p><p>As he was immersed in his thoughts, a ray of extremely pure and flawless light beamed across the sky. It did not end there. Ray after ray it gleamed as a horrifying and boundless aura that seemed to be the greatest of the Three Realms unfurled rapidly. It was at least tens of thousands of times more powerful than the Buddha Giant Palm.</p><p>This was definitely more than the legendary realm. It was at least from the Creation Realm.</p><p>Indeed, it was the monster from the back of Spirited Mountain… Meng Qi’s hypothesis had finally been verified.</p><p>The monsters were considerably smart and cunning. They merely applied a fair amount of power that was sufficient to defeat their opponent when they were fighting against enemies like him who had not achieved legendary status. He blocked the attack with the aid from the Nether Skeleton. But, now he could not be bothered by anything else as he faced the most renowned demon ever. He had to fully unfold his power.</p><p>He did not unleash his power in the beginning and finish the battle quickly as he might have some unknown concerns. For instance, he was worried about triggering a change of Spirited Mountain, he was afraid of interference, he feared his compromised condition after being sealed for years. Despite having absorbed the slough of the Golden Body of the Thousand Buddha Formation, he might still carry some latent illness. His power might attack himself or reflux the moment he released all his power.</p><p>A ball of light seemed to have appeared in the middle of the sky. It was the purest light that cleansed all living things in the world. It was a light that could not accommodate anything at all. Meng Qi felt like his whole body was set on fire and was burning fierily, almost turning into a part of the light, leaving nothing behind.</p><p>Other than that, he could neither stare at it with his bare eyes nor was it visible anymore.</p><p>Meng Qi gasped gently. His Divine Sense sprawled into the Invincible Blade, as the purple electricity was emitted. Every bolt of the purple electricity was so fierce as it penetrated the faint world and connected the Power of Basics and Da Dao before it turned into the Thunder Giant Eye. Finally, it looked through the tranquil ball of light and saw the monster within, the monster who consumed almost every golden corpse in the Thousand Buddhas Formation.</p><p>It appeared like the unyielding Buddha. Its body was not in the glaze-like state of Golden Light, dark gold, or green. Instead, it seemed to be a product of pure white. With completely no impurity, it was beaming as it penetrated the layers of the dark and deep universe.</p><p>Upon seeing the scene, Meng Qi was struck by familiarity. Meng Qi felt familiar. He recognized the twinkling constellation in the Dao Yi Glaze Lamp, the symbol of the Principles of Karma.</p><p>This was the karma link that connected the Fallen God of the Old Universe!</p><p>It was sending the signal of dark blood, intending to taint this Supreme Buddha.</p><p>The Devil Buddha was actually making a plan to defeat this monster from the back of the mountain when he dragged the God of the Old Universe along as he fell! Meng Qi was hit by a realization. At the same moment, many virtual shadows appeared around the pure Buddha, including the Wisdom King of Garuda, Manjushri who wore the Five Wisdom Buns, along with other Buddha, Bodhisattva, and Arhat. They seemed to be forming a Thousand Buddha Formation!</p><p>The idea flashed across his mind only within a fraction of a second. When the ball of limitless light appeared, the sky and the ocean of flame rolled up and turned into a burning red cloak that was fluttering in the wind. Then, a golden ferocious monkey appeared. The monkey was wearing a Purple Golden Crown with Phoenix Wings on his head. Golden Locked Armor on his body and Cloud-Stepping Boots on his feet. He looked through the most tranquil and purest light ball as he raised his Golden Cudgel and unveiled his Celestial Body. As his feet stepped on the land far away from Spirited Mountain and his head sheltered by the great sky, he carried a fierce and ruthless aura and horrifying charisma, to the extent that the void broke apart on its own. Each of the crevices led to different universes and worlds and many shadows returned.</p><p>It was the Great Sage Equaling Heaven!</p><p>When the huge golden monkey lifted the Golden Cudgel, the virtual shadows around the Supreme Buddha transformed abruptly. Manjushri’s voice resonated, “A, Ra, Pa, Ca, Na.”</p><p>He raised one of his hands and held his thumb and middle fingers together. All the spectators smiled.</p><p>Buddha’s Palm, the Smile of Flower-Picking.</p><p>Other than him, the remaining Golden Bodies of Buddha and Bodhisattva presented their respective Buddha’s Palm. The Best in the World touched the sky and earth, the Pure Land in the Palm accomodated many buddhist countries, the Nirvana Purification that created the Nirvana Seal. All of the nine Buddha’s Palm unveiled themselves.</p><p>Tens of thousands of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas worked together. Uncountable blows of Buddha’s Palm merged into one. All nine in one!</p><p>The Supreme Buddha that held the utmost purity eventually opened his arms, as though he was embracing heaven and earth. Unbounded lights erupted as the power of the nine-in-one Buddha’s Palms combined wholly in one.</p><p>When the Buddha’s Palms assembled, a new era was born!</p><p>The flare condensed into a huge palm, apparently it had opened up space and time. New living things were born and a new era was formed. Together, they stormed toward the golden fierce monkey.</p><p>There would be light whenever light was demanded. One would fall into the dust whenever one was required to fall into dust.</p><p>The Great Sage Equaling Heaven swayed his Golden Cudgel, too. Every acupuncture point of his body turned into a real universe and shrunk into the cudgel along with the accumulated emotions over the years.</p><p>Hatred, agony, and grudge turned into this blow.</p><p>The Godly Fiery Cloak waved along the wind while the Illusory River surfaced behind him and joined them as well. The Golden Cudgel struck accurately against the nine-in-one Buddha’s Palms.</p><p>Indeed, at this moment, all things returned to the void!</p><p>“Take another blow from Lao Sun!”</p><p>The sky was dark. Just like the void, there was no space and seemed to have no time as well. Meng Qi could no longer spectate the battle. He heard a rustle as half of Spirited Mountain collapsed before it fell off layer after layer. The four elements swept across the atmosphere before it was quickly consumed by the dark. Flowers of lights bloomed like the most beautiful oracle. Bolts and thunder glared out of the sky and brightened up the nearly-destructed Spirited Mountain. They were all embracing heaven and earth. The heaven and earth was annihilated just after it was created. Subsequently, the flowers withered and the thunder quieted.</p><p>The terrifying and traumatic aftershock stayed. The almost legendary attack greatly shocked Taili, Glow, Raka, and No Thoughts, turning their faces pale. They had smelled the scent of death.</p><p>Even if they joined hands during their best time, they would not be able to defend themselves from this aftershock!</p><p>Qingqiu trembled inconspicuously. Abruptly, she raised the Spear of Mythical Creatures. She appeared to be mumbling with an inaudible voice, intending to further activate the Spear of Mythical Creatures in order to survive this crisis. Perturbed, her gaze wavered as she had never encountered a similar situation before.</p><p>Amidst anxiety and despair, they saw bolts and thunder that were indescribably almighty. It could rule the Sacred Mountain and manipulate the Self-Created World. It was the thunder from the limitless Heavens and Myriad Worlds.</p><p>The thunder became one, conjoining with the bright purple light that shone unexpectedly and hacked the aftershock in the middle of the air. The frightening aura caused the demon fairies to shiver, as though they were facing the great sage!</p><p>The light of blade cut along the fascinating orbit. With the support from the power of the Myriad World, it silently slashed the heaven and earth that had been wretched and banished.</p><p>Light lotus, thunderbolts, and annihilation broke apart.The fierceness was peerless. Instantly, its ferocity turned into softness, turning from hard to soft. Rules appeared at the surroundings, the sun rose and the moon set, some flowers blossomed and some wilted. All of this turned into a Myriad World, acting like a haven that did not swerve at all in spite of the catastrophe at Spirited Mountain.</p><p>When the heaven and earth are gone, I will continue to survive!</p><p>Meng Qi’s green robe was wavering in the wind. He tightly held the Invincible Blade in his right hand. Like a mountain that was supporting the sky, he did not retreat, leaving his imprint in the eyes of the demon fairies like Glow and Raka.</p><p>“Peerless Heavenly Weapon of the Legendary Realm!”</p><p>“He owns a Peerless Heavenly Weapon!”</p><p>“And he has been awakened to the Legendary level!”</p><p>Shocked, the demon fairies softly mumbled. They had never expected that Su Meng, the leader of Jade Mirage, would have a hidden card that was able to sweep through the current Heavens and Myriad World. It would be ridiculous for them to form a team with him.</p><p>After absorbing Ananda Kindness, the Invincible Blade barely subdued the Seal of the Devil Buddha and was finally able to show its legendary power!</p><p>This blade contained the ultimate fierceness.</p><p>The Spear of Mythical Creatures released a faint ring as it sensed the aura of the Invincible Blade. Rays of many colors were emitted and the atmosphere was brightened up by different colors. It looked like it was going to proceed further, but it settled down at last.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
