He was shocked not only about Meng Qi’s appearance but also alarmed at the unfathomability of the other party’s realm.</p><p>It’s only been a few years and he actually had the feel of the Legendary realm!</p><p>“Taili?” the Phoenix demonic deity Glow looked over and was puzzled to see Taili out of sorts. Did he discover something wrong?</p><p>Taili retrieved his gaze and looked deeply at the Demonic Sage’s successor Qingqiu before saying in a low and slow voice, “We’ve not met for years and you have all reached such a level.”</p><p>He had actually expected the realms of these three demonic deities but was just using this now to mask his behavior.</p><p>“Communicating additional self is all about patience in the end. As long as there is enough time, we would be able to accumulate enough, and what we have most is time,” the Great Roc Demonic Deity No Thoughts laughed, looking humble but was actually full of arrogance.</p><p>The most difficult part of communicating additional self was the early stage. Many celestial beings stumbled by the phase whereby they had to cultivate the soul to improve the consciousness until it was able to sense the illusory links in order to find the additional self in the vast world. Most of them couldn’t pass this and could only hope to get a hold of celestial medicines such as the Godly Taiyi Elixir to sense a small bit of additional self. Then, they had to withstand the erosion of the spirit by its experience, character, and feelings. Their memories would be disrupted if they weren’t careful and could easily go off the path. The spiritual requirements were even greater than the Mysterious Fairy dealing with Nirmanakaya.</p><p>After getting used to it all and gaining experience, the remaining would just be accumulating the numbers which depended on whether time was sufficient.</p><p>Glow slightly nodded, “The important thing is to comprehend I am who I am.”</p><p>The three demonic deities had already accumulated the number of additional self to the stage of near material change. Once they comprehend I am who I am, they would be able to enter the Legendary realm.</p><p>Could being in the heavens derived from the Sea Calming Pearl and sensing additional self be simpler, like having taken the Godly Taiyi Elixir? Meng Qi smiled as he listened with other thoughts running in his mind.</p><p>The nature of the heavens derived from the Sea Calming Pearl was just slightly lower than the Nine Levels of Heaven, but well above all realms. They had legendary characteristics, hence it seemed natural that they helped in sensing the additional self. Of course, in the real world, the world of gods, and the west, due to the intentional isolation by the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi and Lord Daode, the heavens derived from the Sea Calming Pearl couldn’t cover all directions and be everywhere like the Nine Levels of Heaven but could only be restricted to one place. It was only until the seal of the Demon King’s palace was removed that they could have contact with another and considered involved in the Final Trial.</p><p>The Heart Saint and the other well-known figures among the ancient sages seemed to have comprehended I am who I am prior to sensing the additional self?</p><p>As Meng Qi was pondering, the Little Fox Qingqiu saw the four demonic deities had all arrived and cautioned, “Spirited Mountain has been ruined by Ananda with the Reverse Thousand Buddha Formation. It’s now like the netherworld with danger everywhere, everyone please be careful.”</p><p>She had entered Spirited Mountain once to complete a samsara mission, but she had only wandered at the outer ring and didn’t go deep inside. After pondering for a while, she speculated according to what the Demonic Sage had left behind and said, “It’s very likely to come across bodies of obsessiveness that are of legendary status or even creation realm inside, such as Maha Kasyapa, Manjushri, and Samantabhadra, Acala and the Shining Jin’gang, Akshobhya Buddha, and Ratna-sambhava, ancient Buddhas like Sikhin and Kakusandha, and the fallen sages.”</p><p>“Since thousands of buddhas fell together, it is normal to have bodies of legendary or even creation realm. But without anyone controlling, they couldn’t be compared to when they were at their peak with just a little bit of obsessiveness and definitely wouldn’t reach the legendary level, so what do we have to fear?” the Kirin Demonic Deity Raka said calmly.</p><p>The Heaven of Demon had been around for a very long time and was no stranger to the what happened at Spirited Mountain. They also had words left behind by the Demonic Sage.</p><p>Glow was also the same as she said with indifference, “Unless they come alive again or get reincarnated, we just have to be careful of the legendary or creation characteristics of such bodies so as not to be affected by the tactics such as reflecting the outside world.”</p><p>As powerful demonic deities who were just a step away from Legendary realm, they were not afraid of the bodies, each showing understanding and familiarity and subtly competing for the leader position.</p><p>Meng Qi who had entered Spirited Mountain and faced the bodies of Maha Kasyapa and Manjushri was amused as he listened on, wanting to see how they act smart while he watched quietly.</p><p>I guess you guys are lucky. If the Devil Buddha’s claws hadn’t been broken by me and could still emit some strength, how could the bodies of the buddhas, bodhisattvas, and arhats be so easy to deal with under his control?</p><p>Even he had to forsake the Corpse of Nether to bypass Maha Kasyapa!</p><p>Now Spirited Mountain had characteristics of the netherworld which multiplied the spirits and bodies. He hadn’t been able to see the unusualness of this the previous time because of the Devil Buddha’s control. He might get to experience more of it this time round.</p><p>Seeing Raka, Glow, and the other demonic deities full of confidence and disregarding the bodies, Qingqiu gave it a thought before saying, “A place that led to the fall of thousands of buddhas at the same time definitely still have dangerous areas remaining even though years have passed. We still have to be careful.”</p><p>The four demonic deities showed no objection toward this statement. No matter how arrogant they were, they didn’t dare to belittle Spirited Mountain that trapped many Great Sages.</p><p>Finally, Qingqiu emphasized, “An extremely terrifying devil is being suppressed at the peak of Spirited Mountain. He definitely cannot be rivaled against the strength of the bodies. When we get the Golden Cudgel and save the remaining Great Sages, we must not affect the seal at the other side.”</p><p>Hearing Qingqiu’s solemn tone, Glow and No Thoughts looked at each other frowning and said, “Which devil is it?”</p><p>“Ananda who has fallen into devilism,” Taili said in a low voice.</p><p>“Ananda who has fallen into devilism?” Glow’s expression changed, showing shock, fear, and anger. The hatred of the Demonic Sage was engraved in her blood.</p><p>No Thoughts and Raka’s expressions turned solemn. The Ananda who almost destroyed the demonic clan was actually still alive and suppressed at the Spirited Mountain!</p><p>He had already reached the level of Creation realm during ancient times. If he was released, it would be a great calamity to the demonic race!</p><p>At this moment, Qingqiu added, “After Ananda fell into devilism, he had already attained Nirvana and was suppressed at Spirited Mountain by Gautama Buddha.”</p><p>What? The shocking news made the faces of the three demonic deities lose color. Ananda actually went through the sea of sufferings and became Spirited Mountain, and Gautama Buddha who disappeared after attaining the Fruit of Dao actually suppressed him personally?</p><p>Meng Qi who appeared calm saw the Little Fox Qingqiu curl her lips slightly upward, showing a contented smile. Inside him, he admired her little tactics.</p><p>Don’t the three of you have your eyes on above your heads? Don’t you think very highly of yourselves? Don’t you all want to have control over the Demonic Divine Spear?</p><p>The news of the Devil Buddha Ananda shall shake you and weaken your overbearingness!</p><p>After a simple introduction, the atmosphere inside the Demonic King’s palace changed quietly. The three demonic deities were highly alert and stopped fighting and coveting the Demonic Divine Spear. They carefully discussed about the trip to Spirited Mountain and how to obtain the Golden Cudgel.</p><p>Actually, you don’t have to worry about the Devil Buddha. The fact that I’m standing here means that he can’t even protect himself… Meng Qi said silently as he listened to them smilingly and discovered that they had actually obtained the method to make the Golden Cudgel extremely tiny.</p><p>After finishing their discussion, Qingqiu and Taili who had gotten the leader position led the three demonic deities and Meng Qi through the Demonic King’s palace and arrived at the southern sea of the west. They flew to Aparagodaniya and headed to where Spirited Mountain was originally located.</p><p>On the way, the three demonic deities each had their own thinking and didn’t care about Meng Qi, a normal human race celestial being.</p><p>After arriving at the ruined temple where Meng Qi had gotten the horizontal inscribed board Temple of Thunder Sounds, the Little Fox looked at the sky as she waited for the time and the change in the position of the stars.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, she suddenly stretched out her hands with nine fiery red fox tails floating behind her and displayed changing Buddhism signs with her hands, emitting a deep zen sound.</p><p>“Spirited Mountain is where my heart is!” she opened her mouth and out came thunder-like words.</p><p>Where to find Spirited Mountain? Spirited Mountain is in your heart!</p><p>As the light of Buddha shone, a blurry and illusory gate appeared in front of them, revolving with glaze and taking in the demonic deities and Meng Qi, and he saw the familiar world of Spirited Mountain once again.</p><p>After travelling dozens of miles with one step, the vast Cloud Canyon appeared in front of them. With strong eye power, the demonic deities had already seen through what was in front of them and saw the majestic sky-supporting Golden Cudgel. They also saw green lotuses falling and thunder glimmering in this different universe.</p><p>As they marveled at the scene, Meng Qi saw the eight-mile wide Cloud Canyon and a strange thought came to his mind.</p><p>Since the Golden Emperor said that there’s something not right about Tripitaka, then where did his flesh body flow to along with the river?</p><p>Can it still be recovered?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
