His face was pale with a deep aura of death will, his eyes were filled with gloomy colors, looking like the Ghost Emperor from the Nine Levels of Underground. He fit perfectly into a harmonious whole with the surrounding black gas. He was no longer rejected, but felt like being clustered instead.</p><p>“You!” One of Liang Luo’s heads was stunned while the other one said in a deep voice, “So this is your adept transformation skill?”</p><p>He could actually transform into a creature of the Nine Levels of Underground and gain support from this realm!</p><p>As an Evil Demon who was well known for his intellectual sobriety, Liang Luo once divided its divine sense, possessed the low-level Evil Demon who could climb out of the Endless Sea through the sealed gap and collected the information about all the Dharmakaya in the Real World. However, it had never experienced it personally and only faced with a word or two from the news, it was difficult to delve into the specific situation. For example, the description of Su Meng, the Primitive Emperor was: at the beginning, he was practicing the art of changing his mortal body into sage, which was suspected to be the Golden Bell Shield; then he switched to practice the Premier Nine Seals that was to be passed down in a direct line of Jade Palace, he was adept at transformation skills and mastered multiple arts.</p><p>Who could tell from this statement that his adept transformation skill was not an illusion, but a genuine change of the body structure and becoming a real Evil Ghost?</p><p>Liang Luo only knew of one similar art, which was the Arts of Eight-Nine that the mighty people from the Nine Levels of Underground talked about!</p><p>Both of them had the same advantage in terms of geographical location. Liang Luo was shocked and amazed, it was instantly full of fear and wanted to retreat. However, this was only the idea of one of the heads, the other was sneering.</p><p>“How many seals of your Premier Nine Seals can still be used after becoming an Evil Ghost? How many decapitations can be performed by the Tyrant’s Six Decapitations? What’s the point of having the realm once you lose the Peerless Art which you are adept and depending upon? Moreover, we are of the same level. The direct knowledge and art that I inscribed in my blood are in line with the current environment and my body, how can you contend against me without any martial arts?”</p><p>Each head of Liang Luo had its own real spirit, character, and ideas. They always had a difference of opinion, engaged in a brawl, and thus affecting their action. This was simply the ultimate form of dissociative identity disorder patients, the embodiment of chaos of the Nine Levels of Underground.</p><p>The two heads went on different ways again at this critical moment!</p><p>However rational and sober they were, they were Evil Demons after all. They were still restricted by Da Dao and constrained by the Nine Levels of Underground, so they would have more or less some spiritual and psychological problems. Back then, Qi Zhengyan wanted to break his fate by spurring on Evil Demons, break free of the attributes imposed by heaven and earth, and achieve the true sense of physical and mental liberation. Hei Jia Devil Sage was impressed by him, and hence decided to follow him whole-heartedly.</p><p>Fortunately, the head which was thinking of retreating was not very determined after the other head insisted to stay. Liang Luo stood up on the Dark Lotus Platform, clenched his right hand into a fist and raised it to the side of the body. It spoke in a deep voice, “I’ll show you what is meant by near-legendary state, what is meant by the union of realm of Direct Knowledge!”</p><p>Its voice echoed in the dark, the black gas was rolling violently with static sounds, seemingly extending into another universe, time, and space. Liang Luo created some different scenes around its body. There were Godly Regions of Death that were blooming with the Equinox Flower, a Slumbering Place with everlasting silence, a Pitch-Black Sea which was full of roaring of demonic creatures, and the ruined and grayish-white City of Trial… the scenes were all covered with dim light. Endless power turned into dark stars and orbited around Liang Luo.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The void around was trembling and curling up, the broad and boundless power were comparable to a supergalaxy cluster, pulling the vast ocean as if it was going to blow up the place.</p><p>The Nine Levels of Underground were different than the Celestial World. It would actively corrode the Myriad World, Universal Fragments, all universes and form a corresponding region. The Celestial Level Evil Demons in the Nine Levels of Underground could use this feature to interconnect with Myriad World even if they did not communicate with their reflected self. They would borrow the corresponding strength and produce near-legendary strength. When the Evil Demon itself was near-legendary, it would obtain the standard legendary combat capability. This was the reason why the Nine Levels of Underground in ancient times were able to be on par with the Heavenly Court even with a small amount of mighty people.</p><p>Slumber, sleep, death, passing on… all the dark stars with such attributes quickly gathered around Liang Luo’s right fists, making it as huge as a monster stretching over galaxies. Meng Qi did not have a chance to stop it at all.</p><p>“One head controls death, one head rules slumber, and death is similar to sleep. Come receive my Eternal Sleep Treasure Wheel!”</p><p>The stars merged into a point, Liang Luo threw out his right fist abruptly, the fist was giving out rays of dim light. The dim light was peaceful but lacking vitality. The light enclosed the fist, forming a huge treasure wheel and expanded at the speed of light.</p><p>The vast night sky-like Eternal Sleep Treasure Wheel filled up the sea in an instance. Everything was hypnotized and buried in darkness. The external world was shaking, stirring strong winds in the Antarctic Desert and God Burial Desert. There were sandstorms everywhere, it was as though the end of the world had come.</p><p>In the face of the Eternal Sleeping Treasure Wheel that was composed of the outburst of dim light, Meng Qi looked calm, with a deadly temperament. He extended all the five fingers and opened his right hand, his palm was pitch-black with a dark abyss, like a passage to another universe. An image that was similar to the Creation Brahma flashed through constantly in his hand!</p><p>Puff!</p><p>All the dim lights were absorbed into the rolling Eternal Sleep Treasure Wheel once the mass of dark abyss appeared, and then there was no sign of activities.</p><p>Death and eternal sleep would eventually end in chaos.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Liang Luo’s huge right fist was caught by Meng Qi’s palm, its whole body was wriggling like it was going to crumble directly. It kept struggling, constantly initiating the explosion of dark stars, just then he could barely escape from Meng Qi. The expression of both the heads were full of fear.</p><p>It was aware of the status of the Wu’Ji Seal, but he had never seen this divine skill before and could not have imagined that it was so frightful!</p><p>Wu Ji embodied everything, it was breeding all things, and the Nine Levels of Underground was one of them. Being in the Endless Sea and changing into an evil ghost did not affect Meng Qi in exerting the Wu’Ji Seal at all. Besides, by taking advantage of the favorable location, he could directly utilize the Wu’Ji Seal that required the joint attack of swords to work. The Premier Reflection could be immensely felt.</p><p>The only problem was that Nine Levels of Underground could only link up the depraved, filthy, destructive killing, and other natures of similar power. This part of the Premier Reflection was the malevolent and chaotic negative part, for example, the frantic universe incarnation of the blind fool person in the old universe.</p><p>“I’m really a Primitive Devil in the Nine Levels of Underground, and in Endless Sea…” Meng Qi snickered. He never expected that a random nickname that he chose back then could actually be verified one day.</p><p>In the face of Liang Luo’s consecutive retreating, he stood on the void and shouted, “It’s your turn!”</p><p>“Take my punch!”</p><p>His voice was echoing around the sea, and three figures appeared behind him. The Golden Body Buddha, the Sword Power Tao, and the Indestructible Body threw a punch at the same time. Their punches emerged into one with Meng Qi’s own fist.</p><p>There was black gas all around, numerous universes appeared one by one. Some were in solidified ice, some were in the most chaotic and peaceful state of dead silence, some were experiencing destruction everywhere while some were devoured by a black hole. All the scenes that could be presented at the limit of the universe appeared.</p><p>The Fairy Slaying Sword Formation, the end of multiple dimensions!</p><p>The snow white fist struck, the rolling bubbles in the sea returned to silence. The violent shaking of the earth stopped, the sandstorm and strong wind disappeared, the void inside the black gas collapsed, the time jumbled, causing extreme chaos with fluctuating speed.</p><p>“The Fairy Slaying Sword Formation!” both the heads of Liang Luo gave a panicked roar.</p><p>This was the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation!</p><p>He could actually perform the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation with his own efforts, and connected it with the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation in the Myriad World!</p><p>Puff! Numerous arms grew out of his body surface, each arm was holding a black star and gathered in front of him like Avalokitesvara, merging into a Death Star Chart!</p><p>Snap!</p><p>The star chart instantly collapsed when it was hit by the snow white fist. It shattered from both the aspects of time and space, did not play a role in obstructing!</p><p>“Take my punch!”</p><p>Bang! Meng Qi’s fist hit one of the heads of Liang Luo. The head burst into blood rain, spreading chaos and destruction. The other head stared blankly when its own demonic body lost control.</p><p>Its vision was in confusion. It looked at the pale, gloomy face and the indestructible fist in front of it, as if it was looking at the end approaching.</p><p>…</p><p>The scene in front of Fei Zhengtao was shaking constantly. It was because Xiao Qian’s Myriad World Talisman was affected by the dissipation of power and lost its stability.</p><p>He was anxious and eager to know about the war situation in the Endless Sea, but he could only feel the earthquake and sandstorm.</p><p>It was the same for the rest of the audience.</p><p>Right at the moment, their vision froze as they saw a blood-colored fountain flow out from the Endless Sea, sprinkling throughout the desert like the Heavenly River hanging upside down.</p><p>Then, an arm flew out, a thigh and a head flew out one after another, banging and falling on the floor. Each part of them was like a mountain, causing a violent shock.</p><p>Xiao Qian shivered at the sight of the ferocious face and frightful aura. Fei Zhengtao and the other audience members were clearly aware of the strength and terror of the Evil Demon.</p><p>Yet, the Evil Demon was broken apart by the Primitive Emperor and turned into such form within a breath of time!</p><p>A thought flashed through their minds.</p><p>In this present world, the Primitive Emperor is the greatest!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
