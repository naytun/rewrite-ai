Frankly speaking, after confirming that the Demon King’s intention was for him to achieve the Legendary realm as quickly as possible, he didn’t think there was any danger entering the Demon King Palace, so agreeing to Vertical Wing wasn’t really a big deal.</p><p>But they were merely old acquaintances and didn’t have much friendship, hence the focus on karma was ranked top.</p><p>“I’ve made a calculation with my fingers. It’s not advisable for me to enter again today,” Meng Qi said with a straight face.</p><p>Vertical Wing let go of the robe and said blankly, “When did you do that?”</p><p>Before he could continue, Meng Qi said said firmly, “In my heart!”</p><p>“Contact me again after you’ve met the Demon Sage successor, Little Fox, and tell her I’m looking for her. I’ll accompany you to explore the Demon King Palace then.”</p><p>“Tsk, you’re really scheming. I already knew you were a somebody back then. All right, I’ll contact you after meeting the Little Fox. Erm, how to contact you?” Vertical Wing flapped his wings.</p><p>Meng Qi took out a Myriad World Talisman and gave a few pointers on how to use it, “… you’ll be able to contact me as long as it’s not in the Demon King Palace.”</p><p>At this point, his expression turned solemn, “If I see you harming any humans in the future, I’ll definitely eliminate you!”</p><p>Vertical Wing stammered, “I, I’ll be vegetarian, alright? What about fish? What about beef…”</p><p>He asked continuously, but Meng Qi had already expected it, turning and entering the spring right away and returned to Donghai.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside Kunlun Mountain Jade Mirage Palace, Meng Qi had just sat down and taken out the Haotian Mirror fragment. He was going to sense the stamp of the Ananda additional self with the characteristics of the Tyrant’s God of Thunder’s additional self in order to shorten the time of himself leaving behind the additional self imprint.</p><p>At this moment, the Myriad World Talisman suddenly rang – it was Vertical Wing’s call request.</p><p>“You’ve met the Little Fox so quickly?” Meng Qi asked casually.</p><p>Vertical Wing sounded excited, “Not yet, I just felt that the Myriad Word is very interesting. The forums, live broadcast, and the Myriad World Mall are all very fun, they’re really suitable for celestial beasts like me who are good at communication. I’ve just replied to all the posts in every forum and got banned for spamming. Could you help me remove the ban and also tell me how to get Primitive Emperor Coins, I’ve taken a fancy to many things…”</p><p>He rattled on like a chatterbox and Meng Qi was stupefied, wanting to slap himself again. Why did he give this fellow the Myriad World Talisman and the way to contact him? Wasn’t he asking to be bothered?</p><p>After getting in touch with the Little Fox, he would block this fellow right away!</p><p>“Stop, I’ll get a professional to help you,” Meng Qi interrupted Vertical Wing and straight away connected the call between himself and Vertical Wing to the Myriad World Talisman of his doorkeeper, Daqinggen.</p><p>“Daqinggen, in the future, help me answer calls from Vertical Wing, the descendant of the Great Roc. Transfer to me only if there is any substantive news or useful clues on the Demonic Sage successor, Little Fox,” he instructed.</p><p>Daqinggen immediately stood upright, “Yes, master!”</p><p>Descendant of the Great Roc? A treasure from head to toe! With this thought, his tone subconsciously became amicable, “Hello, Vertical Wing? I’m your grand uncle, I was friends with the Demon Master back then!”</p><p>Meng Qi heaved a sigh of relief before weakening his consciousness and calming his mind. A bright light appeared in his soul and fell into the Dao Yi Glaze Lamp, revolving black and white lights and burning characteristics of the God of Thunder’s additional self.</p><p>Light rays of the Dao Yi Glaze Lamp scattered and shone on the Haotian Mirror fragment, looking dark and magical.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, Meng Qi was slightly taken by surprise.</p><p>…</p><p>A kerosene lamp was placed on the table, exuding a brilliance that surpassed a candle and an oil lamp. The only annoying thing was the smell of burning. Of course, there were guys with strange habits who especially liked this smell, and Gu Liang was one of them.</p><p>Leaning on the bed and taking in a deep breath of the burning smell of kerosene, he cast his gaze on the dark blue police uniform on the chair. In another three days, which was next Monday, he would be freed of his trainee identity and become a formal police officer of the Far East Police Department, which was also known as the New Scotland Yard.</p><p>Which department would I be assigned to? Hopefully it’s the Criminal Investigation Division or the Organized Crime Investigation Division… Gu Liang thought about the future, feeling both excited and perturbed.</p><p>No matter what, his salary would double after officially becoming a policeman, hitting thirty silver dollars, and he wouldn’t have to live so shabbily anymore.</p><p>It really wasn’t easy living alone in the most prosperous city in the Far East region!</p><p>Gu Liang ended his fantasy, picked up the book beside him, and started flipping. It was a book named World Fantasy Records compiled by the West Land’s spiritual society, and was especially appealing to him who liked ghost stories and thrillers, in particular this type that was nonsensical in a serious way.</p><p>“In the spiritual world, there are seven recognised great demon gods,” the starting statement already excited Gu Liang. This was the first time he heard something like that.</p><p>“The Core of Chaos, the most ancient demon god – the original sin of everything, the source of depravation, the leader of all devils…”</p><p>“Door of All Doors, Evil Wise Man, Master of Time and Space – these are all names of the same demon god. He appeared much later, not more than thirty years the latest, but possesses the most bewildering force, the craziest knowledge and countless doors that connect to all demonic and external territories…”</p><p>“Mother God of Darkness, creator of all things, mother of all demons and demon kings…”</p><p>“Great Demon of Fear, the most ancient and strongest emotion of living things is fear…”</p><p>The Universal Being, the world-destroying demon god that returns all things to chaos…”</p><p>“Faceless Pharaoh, the demon god that emerged from the black mainland, the only insane evilness that became a demon god with a human body, the main culprit who caused the death of all living things of the black mainland and its civilization to remain in the original barbaric state…”</p><p>“The Fallen God, once the protector of the human race and creator of civilization, a mighty god for thousands of years. He fell from his throne, got contaminated with evilness and became the craziest blood-sucking demon god. The reason for him falling was unknown, but is suspected to be linked to the three hundred years of lost history of the Far East mainland…”</p><p>Just the introduction of the seven great demon gods alone was enough to make Gu Liang feel thrilled and excited, while the description of the Fallen God made him sigh with emotions.</p><p>Yes, because of the retrogression of civilization of the Far East mainland, history was dark and obscure. There wasn’t much inheritance other than writings and a small number of books, that was why it became a huge region of the West Land and civilization was completely shrouded. Even the Far East Police Department had to be named New Scotland Yard to show that it was related to the West Land Scotland Yard.</p><p>There were no sacrificial gods, and not even legends of demons and evil spirits among the common people. The blank space in this area was easily taken by the West Land’s spiritual society and churches, and also filled up by legends like the seven great demon gods.</p><p>As a Far Easterner, Gu Liang always sighed with emotions when he thought about the history.</p><p>He read the book quietly and slept when it was time to. The next day, Gu Liang wore the dark blue police uniform with an armband that had only a sword symbol, his name and trainee number. Holding a baton, he walked out of the room, walked downstairs and arrived at the main street.</p><p>On the street, the morning fog was thin and people were walking to and fro. There were four-wheeled and two-wheeled horse carriages as well as human-driven rickshaws. Novel bicycles could sometimes be seen, and above the center of the road were rows of wires.</p><p>After waiting for a while, Gu Liang saw the trolley bus coming from far away. He adjusted his collar of his coat and was about to squeeze up when a fat man wearing the same police uniform walked down.</p><p>“Good morning, Sheriff Huang,” Gu Liang subconsciously stood straight and gave a salute.</p><p>Sheriff Huang Yuanbo took a glance at Gu Liang, “Good timing, you don’t have to go to the New Scotland Yard anymore. There’s a murder case nearby, follow me there to widen your knowledge, the others will come shortly.”</p><p>Gu Liang was excited but also very nervous, because the crime scene must have a dead body!</p><p>As expected, Gu Liang saw a charred body after arriving at the crime scene at Sanchuan Hotel and he almost vomited when the smell got into his nose.</p><p>Sheriff Huang Yuanbo instructed Gu Liang not to touch anything as he put on white gloves to inspect the body and the items at the scene.</p><p>Gu Liang’s eyes shifted from the dead body to the side and discovered an opened box with exquisite and beautiful pocket watches inside.</p><p>“A watch merchant?” he speculated the victim’s identity.</p><p>“Very rich…” the sheriff added, because he had opened the briefcase beside the body and inside it were shiny gold bars.</p><p>Swallowing hard, the sheriff took a glance at Gu Liang and suddenly regretted. He wouldn’t have called him along if he had known about this.</p><p>He would have enough time to tamper with the items before the others arrived!</p><p>He calmed himself down before examining the body carefully and said doubtfully, “Why does it look like he was struck by lightning?”</p><p>“There wasn’t any lightning the last few days…” Gu Liang blurted out subconsciously.</p><p>“That’s why it’s strange. There are marks of being struck by lightning on his body.” the sheriff saw one of the dead body’s hands tightly clenched. He opened it and saw a thin silver metal piece with strange patterns and buttons inside, showing a strange sense of beauty!</p><p>“Is this a clue?” Gu Liang cast his gaze over.</p><p>There wasn’t any lightning, but this watch merchant was struck to death by lightning?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
