Now, with clouds all around, their location was unknown. Looking at the mountain of spiritual beauty not far away, Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu were full of frustration, despair, and disappointment.</p><p>That night, under the dim moonlight and huge stars, the Taoist temple looked ordinary with a spiritual monster guarding the door. A green-robed priest was sitting alone and admiring the lotuses. Everything was so ordinary, like a scene that was visible everywhere in the Celestial World, who knew that it was actually a rare celestial fate!</p><p>Meeting celestial beings in the wild mountains and achieving success thereafter – there were countless such stories being passed down from generation to generation. But with the world this big, how many people could have real celestial fate, moreover with a Legendary supreme who was in the upper ranks of the celestial list and high above all celestial beings?</p><p>But the two of them missed their celestial fate just like that…</p><p>As thoughts ran through his mind, Yu Banshan took in a deep breath and said in a deep voice, “Jinxiu, don’t be disappointed, you and I have just entered the Celestial World, and it is understandable that we do not recognize the celestial lord. We would be looked down upon if we give up just like this. Let’s figure out the situation first before going to Kunlun Mountain again to find the Jade Mirage Palace deep in the clouds.”</p><p>Qi Jinxiu was stunned for a while hearing him, but immediately nodded hard, “All right!”</p><p>Only a determined Yu Banshan who didn’t give up easily was her soulmate and partner!</p><p>She cast her gaze out of the window, looking once again at the spiritual mountain peak covered by clouds.</p><p>Could they find back the celestial fate that they had missed?</p><p>At this moment, the dishes were served. After filling their stomachs, Yu Banshan pondered and said, “We keep hearing about the Myriad World Talisman today, it seems to be an important thing in the Celestial World, and it is not difficult to obtain. To understand the general situation of the Celestial World, first we have to depend on our own seeing and hearing, next we probably have to rely on it.”</p><p>As they had just arrived, they didn’t dare to behave abnormally. But there were a lot of things that they couldn’t ask through normal inquiries, which was not very convenient.</p><p>“But where can we get the Myriad World Talisman?” Qi Jinxiu’s eyes looked out of the side window and casually at the street downstairs. Without any effort, she noticed a shop because of its striking signboard, “Myriad World Talisman Store.”</p><p>“Wanjie Licensing franchise.”</p><p>This… Qi Jinxiu’s mouth was half-open, like she had fallen into a dream.</p><p>This is really easy to find!</p><p>It can be seen everywhere!</p><p>To think she was still worrying about where to get it!</p><p>After a short while, the two finished their lunch and left the restaurant. They went straight into the shop and saw a variety of palm-sized sheets – some had a metallic texture, some were gold, some were engraved with flowers and so on.</p><p>“It’s the strange thing those people in the restaurant were holding… so this is the Myriad World Talisman…” Yu Banshan nodded in silence when he suddenly realized.</p><p>Qi Jinxiu looked around, feeling overwhelmed. After getting used to it, she actually felt that some of the Myriad World Talismans were quite beautiful, making people want to collect them.</p><p>Yu Banshan chose to observe instead of asking directly. He noticed that the Myriad World Talismans were divided into different levels with different prices, ranging from a few taels of silver to hundreds of thousands.</p><p>“It seems that their powers are different.” Yu Banshan sent a message to Qi Jinxiu, “But I don’t know if there are any other requirements if we want to buy these kinds of magical items.”</p><p>Qi Jinxiu thought for a moment and said, “Let me try to find out first.”</p><p>She called for the shop assistant and pretended to ask about the detailed differences. With her many years of experience in the pugilistic world, she roughly figured out the requirements for the different levels of Myriad World Talismans.</p><p>“Banshan, we do not have the identities in the Celestial World, and we cannot get a complete Myriad World Talisman without household registration. We can only choose the cheapest two, which only have the functions of remote communication, martial arts exchange and buying and selling goods, and they are easily damaged,” Qi Jinxiu sent a message to Yu Banshan.</p><p>Yu Banshan nodded and said, “That’s enough for us for the time being.”</p><p>Speaking of this, he sighed, “People could talk directly even if they were far apart, as though mountains and rivers had become miniatures in the palm. Such a magical item would be extremely precious in our original world. But in the Celestial World, everyone has it and it can be obtained everywhere!”</p><p>The more he understood the Celestial World, the more he was amazed and shocked, as it had far exceeded his previous imaginations about the Celestial World. Everywhere had things that were unheard of and everything had never been seen before. Magical powers and treasures that could cause bloodshed were actually so worthless!</p><p>The two took out most of their money and bought two Myriad World Talismans before finding an inn to stay. They closed the doors and windows, got together, and activated one each.</p><p>Light and shadow moved as a water curtain-like image appeared in front of Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu, and a pleasant sound was heard.</p><p>There were two options on the image – one was to project outside and the other was to appear in the eyes. Yu Banshan chose the first one without any hesitation, and he saw the scene change – with cloud at the bottom, a mountain peak appeared, looking a bit like the Kunlun Mountain he had seen earlier.</p><p>Lines of text appeared:</p><p>“Welcome to the Myriad World Talisman, a novice can choose the following guide, the others can skip it.”</p><p>“Novice options: introduction of the Myriad World Talisman; how to get current general knowledge; how to use the Myriad World Mall…”</p><p>Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu look at each other, their eyes filled with astonishment. The Myriad World Talisman was actually so intelligent, and also quite friendly.</p><p>After thinking about it, they both pointed at the Introduction of the Myriad World Talisman.</p><p>“This product is based on the Myriad World Knowledge Ball made by the Celestial Lord Primitive Emperor of Kunlun Mountain. It can communicate with the real world and its underlying universe. As long as both parties hold the Myriad World Talisman and know each other’s number, they can communicate smoothly like face to face even if they are not in the same world…”</p><p>“This product comes with the Myriad World access, where you can have an exchange of martial arts, discuss various issues, obtain practice materials, buy and sell the required items…”</p><p>The series of introductions made Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu a little stunned. The celestial treasures that they knew of were just so-so, or even far behind. For example, they had fantasized the Celestial World using the flying swords to pass the letters, such that people could communicate frequently even when they were tens of thousands of miles apart. Who knows that the Myriad World Talisman could make those far away seem right in front and communicate directly!</p><p>And such a celestial treasure was unbelievably cheap!</p><p>And all these were created by is the Celestial Lord Primitive Emperor of Kunlun Mountain, the green-robed priest they saw in the night!</p><p>After being silent for a while, Qi Jinxiu exited from the introduction and chose the second item on the novice guide, hoping to learn how to get current general knowledge. Then, she saw a lot of content on the screen, such as Introduction to the Six Sacred Lands, Introduction to the high-ranking experts on the Celestial List, Teaching Video on the Star Sparks Art, etc. It can be seen from the text next to them that they were respectively connected to different places, and would proceed as needed according to the clicks. This had really overturned the two’s imagination of the Myriad World Talisman.</p><p>Without a doubt, Yu Banshan first selected the introduction to the six sacred places, and many words appeared:</p><p>“Sacred Land of Taoism: Kunlun Mountain Jade Mirage Palace, sect master Primitive Emperor Su Meng, has self-attained Legendary realm, the only one in the various worlds and the first in the current era. He is the direct inheritant of the ancient Jade Mirage, practices the Premier Golden Stamp, there are rumors that he is the reincarnation of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi. There are two disciples under him, one is a Heavenly Guardian King…”</p><p>The first person in the current, reincarnation of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi? Through the introduction of the Star Sparks Art, both Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu knew how powerful and prestigious a Legendary supreme was, and also understood the status of the Primitive Emperor among the celestial beings, but they did not expect him to have such an influential background, and seemingly the reincarnation of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi!</p><p>In their original world, Heavenly Lord Yuanshi was the creation god, the Heavenly Lord of Taoism, and was above all deities, which would be a powerful character of the Nirvana realm using the description of the Star Sparks Art. And the Primitive Emperor was actually his reincarnation?</p><p>In the midst of shock, Qi Jinxiu suddenly thought of something. She had previously gone to a Taoist hall to pay respect and offer incense, and noticed that the statue of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi had obvious changes. It was said that many Taoist priests had dreamed of the current look of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi, hence they all did a facelift.</p><p>Contrasting them now, the green-robed priest whom they saw last night really looked a little similar!</p><p>Is it really Heavenly Lord Yuanshi?</p><p>Feeling shocked, she quickly told Yu Banshan this matter, bringing him the same shock and astonishment.</p><p>After a long time, Yu Banshan said, “We shall enter the mountain later, hope we still have the celestial fate to see the Jade Mirage Palace.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Qi Jinxiu also did not want to give up the celestial fate.</p><p>The words in front of them continued to emerge:</p><p>“The two sacred lands of Buddhism: the Eastern Pure Land of the Azure Stones and the Buddhist Kingdom on earth. The former is guarded by the Moonlight Bodhisattva who seemed to be of Creation, or at least Legendary realm. The latter leader is rumored to be the Forthcoming Maitreya whose realm attainment is unknown.”</p><p>“The sacred land of orthodoxy: the Luo Sect’s Void Hometown, where there is already three awakened Legendary supremes…”</p><p>“The sacred place of the Demonic race: the enchanting Demon King Palace, it is said that many ancient saints returned in ancient times, and now there are more than two…”</p><p>“The sacred land of Humanity: Changle of the Great Zhou Dynasty, the current Emperor Gao Lan has two Legendary characters under him, currently building the Heaven Conferring Platform. If successful, he would be able to rule the world with humanity and directly confer humans as gods, controlling heaven and earth.”</p><p>Having obtained the various general knowledge, Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu had a rough grasp of the Celestial World, understanding that they claimed to be the real world, and that Kunlun Mountain Jade Mirage Palace was a powerful force in the world. It was a pity that they didn’t know they had entered a treasure land.</p><p>At this point, the sky was getting darker. Yu Banshan gave it a thought and said, “Jinxiu, let’s enter Kunlun Mountain now.”</p><p>They had no time to lose!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
