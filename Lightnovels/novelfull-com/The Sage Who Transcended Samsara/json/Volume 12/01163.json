Because of his wide knowledge and good memory, he was well-versed in matters of the pugilistic world and martial art knowledge, seeming like a knowledgeable and powerful expert.</p><p>There were reprints of two volumes of ancient classics on the desk as he was leisurely browsing through the forum. For Wu Yanping to be respected in the forum, he had done a lot of homework in private and also spent a lot of effort.</p><p>“After opening up four acupoints, I’ll go traveling…” his thoughts flowed as he thought about the life that was about to change.</p><p>Suddenly, he noticed that the study room was inexplicably brighter and instinctively looked out of the window.</p><p>All of a sudden, his gaze froze. He saw layers of dense mist in the air, looking like nine different layers of heaven and earth. Other than the top most that was blurry and couldn’t be seen clearly, every layer was full of ruins where collapsed pavilions and halls could be seen, giving a sense of otherworldliness.</p><p>“This is…” Wu Yanping had completely forgotten that he was still debating in the forum, feeling that the scene in front of him was like deja vu.</p><p>I must have heard of it before somewhere!</p><p>With a sweep of his eye gaze, he saw the classics on the desk. His heart suddenly violently, and he had already understood where the familiarity came from!</p><p>Two years ago, he had read a book that recorded the general knowledge of ancient legends. It described various kinds of related visions, one of which completely matched what was outside.</p><p>It was called Celestial World Crossing the Horizon!</p><p>This was an inevitable vision of the Legendary realm. Because achieving the Legendary realm was an enhancement of essence, turning into a high-level state like the Nine Levels of Heaven, the internal functional activities would bring about the appearance of the celestial world. If it was a demon or an evil spirit, the Netherworld would appear instead.</p><p>“Someone, someone has self-attained the Legendary realm?” Wu Yanping stood up suddenly with his eyes wide open and rushed to the window, staring at the distinct vision in the sky.</p><p>It’s really the Celestial World Crossing the Horizon!</p><p>Since the Tyrant of the Middle Ages, after tens of thousands of years, there was finally a powerful character who self-attained the Legendary realm!</p><p>A Legendary character was the only one in the various worlds, and was a supreme figure. Even during ancient times, there were not many of them. Now, who was the one who broke the restrictions of heaven and earth to become the Legendary supreme worshipped by the various worlds?</p><p>Not bothered about other things, Wu Yanping subconsciously picked up the Myriad World Talisman, keyed frantically and sent a post:</p><p>“Quick take a look outside, the Legendary vision!”</p><p>He had already developed the habit of sending a post first whenever he saw something major.</p><p>Once the post was made, Wu Yanping looked at the misty celestial world and his finally had other thoughts, “I wonder what other visions will appear?”</p><p>According to what was recorded on that classic, there were three kinds of visions for a self-attained Legendary character. First was the Celestial World Crossing the Horizon or the appearance of the Netherworld, indicating that the powerful character had reached the requirements of Legendary realm and was in the midst of breaking through, but might not necessarily succeed. Second was the vision when pushing open the Door of the Legendary Realm after going through the test. The visions would differ according to the martial arts and nature of each person, and the number of which was the most - there were Flying Snow of Three Realms, Dancing Silver Snakes, Nine Suns As One, Virtues of Life, etc. If a vision of the second type appeared, it meant that the breakthrough was successful and there would soon be a new Legendary Supreme.</p><p>The classic specifically stated that some of the second type visions were extremely rare, which showed the power and speciality of the breaker or his deep accumulation, such as Thousand Buddha Leading, Withering and Flourishing Bodhi, Changing Heaven and Sun, Purple Aura from the East, Golden Lights for a Million Years, Stars of Fire, etc., and they could usually get to the level of Heavenly Lord in the future.</p><p>When the transformation was completed and they attained the Legendary realm, there would be a third type of vision, which also varied from person to person, but there were only a few kinds, like the common All Worlds Worshipping, the outstanding Stars Holding the Moon, and the once strongest Shining Stars Forming a Sea.</p><p>Wu Yanping was eager to see what visions the first self-attained Legendary character in tens of thousands of years could achieve.</p><p>“It is said that the Tyrant of the Middle Ages achieved the three visions of the Celestial World Crossing the Horizon, Changing Heaven and Sun, and Shining Stars Forming a Sea… he thought with infatuation.</p><p>…</p><p>Han Guang stood in the Demon cave, his eyes penetrated the obstacles and saw the vision that covered the entire real world.</p><p>The more emotions he had, the more he outlined a smile on his face, muttering indifferently, “Who beat me to it and self-attained Legendary realm this fast?”</p><p>“It’s him?”</p><p>He gazed toward the north, there was Kunlun Mountain Jade Mirage Palace!</p><p>…</p><p>On the Island of Three Clouds, the mist that had been around for tens of thousands of years suddenly disappeared, revealing the tall mountain peak, the exquisite palace and the dark lotus ponds, etc. Bi Jingxuan stood at the edge of the pool, slightly raised her head, looking at the vision in the sky and muttered, “Celestial World Crossing the Horizon?”</p><p>“He deciphered all forms seen are unreal and perceived Tathagata this fast?”</p><p>Her tone was a little stunned and shocked, seeming like she hadn’t expected to see the Legendary vision in less than a month.</p><p>…</p><p>In the depths of the Southern Wasteland.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan walked out of the school, his dressing no different from an ordinary teacher. His usual expressionless face showed a hint of gratification as he looked at the vision in the sky.</p><p>“How long has it only been?” the black-armored demonic sage behind him was quite shocked.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan said indifferently, “He has practiced the Eight Nine Mysteries for many years, and the accumulation of experiencing all forms seen are unreal has long been deep. Once he was able to let go and see the path, he would naturally succeed.”</p><p>“The Eight Nine Mysteries…” the black-armored demonic sage muttered the name of the martial art.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the Xijian Pavilion, Jiang Zhiwei walked out of her residence. She looked at the vision, walked to the edge of the sea of clouds, and a faint smile appeared on her face.</p><p>Inside a quiet room, Su Wuming who was spiritually-traveling the various worlds and deciphering I am who I am also opened his eyes, which were deep like a lake without any ripples.</p><p>In Huamei Heights, Mister Lu Da put down the flower buds in his hands and closed his eyes, using his heart to feel the uniqueness of the Celestial World and the Legendary realm, confirming himself.</p><p>“Is it him?” the same question flashed across their minds.</p><p>In the real world, everyone raised their heads in anticipation and shock, feeling like they had witnessed history.</p><p>…</p><p>As hundreds of millions of lights emitted, golden lotuses on the other side formed a platform, supporting Meng Qi whose hands were displaying the Wuji Seal through the layers of obstacles, flying high up into the sky.</p><p>At this moment, heaven and earth suddenly changed and the sky turned gloomy. Thunder, fire, chaotic holes, and other Heavenly Tribulations appeared simultaneously, showing five colors and four elements, and turned into a heavy stone door, blocking on top of Meng Qi. Just its horror alone could tear a Dharmakaya apart.</p><p>This was the Heavenly Tribulation test that had manifested as the Door of the Legendary Realm. The door was closed and couldn’t be pushed open. There were sparks of fire falling as well as bolts of thunder.</p><p>Meng Qi’s expression remained unchanged, smiling. The Wuji seal in his hand suddenly rose. A bit of the deepest and darkest darkness emerged, turning into chaos and rising forcefully upward.</p><p>Having returned to his nature and seeing the beginning of Yuanshi, the Wuji Seal formed naturally without the need to put in any effort!</p><p>The shape of chaos was difficult to describe. It was neither fast nor slow, following Meng Qi’s shadow upward, swallowed the sparks, eliminated the lights, and returning all the fallen Heavenly Tribulations to their beginning.</p><p>In a flash, chaos hit right on the Door of the Legendary Realm.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Door of the Legendary Realm shook violently and then slammed open in front of Meng Qi who was on his way to success, like a small fishing boat in a stormy sea!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the real world, the Celestial World disappeared, and an illusory door filled with Taoist engravings appeared in the air. It slowly cracked open, revealing the chaotic world behind and spilling out pieces of dreamy golden stones. Each piece contained the charm of nature and the truth of heaven and earth. If a martial arts practitioner could appreciate just a small part of it, he would definitely benefit greatly.</p><p>“The Door of the Great Path! The vision is the Door of the Great Path!” Wu Yanping almost jumped up. This vision was extremely rare. In ancient times, it was said that there was only one person who could achieve this vision, but nobody knew who it was.</p><p>He held the Myriad World Talisman and hesitated, but still quickly sent a post, pointing out that the vision was the Door of the Great Path. Then, he jumped out of the window, looked up and spread his hands, receiving the falling golden stones from the Door of the Great Path.</p><p>This vision was a blessing to all beings!</p><p>…</p><p>Bi Jingxuan stretched out her right hand and caught a piece of golden stone. She could sense all the different kinds of mystery.</p><p>Her eyes moved slightly before she let out a sigh, “The Door of the Great Path, Jade Mirage Yang Jian…”</p><p>In ancient times, not taking into account those who were born into the Legendary realm, there was only one person who could attain the vision of the Door of the Great Path – the Immortal Qingyuan, Yang Jian!</p><p>Even the emperor did not attain this vision, but the unique double vision of Stars of Fire and Saintly Nourishment.</p><p>…</p><p>“It’s really him,” Han Guang snorted in a complicated tone.</p><p>“It’s really him,” Mister Lu Da, Jiang Zhiwei, and Taili The Peacock, etc., also more or less affirmed the identity of the self-attained Legendary character.</p><p>It’s nothing more than the two words, Jade Mirage!</p><p>Some people were grateful and surprised, some were happy and surprised while some others were shocked.</p><p>How long has it been, and he has already deciphered the difficulty?</p><p>It’s only been a few years and he has attained the level of the only one in the world in such an imposing manner!</p><p>…</p><p>Once he went through the Door of the Legendary Realm, Meng Qi felt his nature changing, and so were his real spirit and flesh body, reorganizing quickly and , returning to his Dharmakaya body before continuing to improve. The memories of martial arts, etc., deep inside his heart appeared without any damage.</p><p>More importantly, what he saw was no longer the same. His perspective had changed inexplicably, like he was looking down at the real world and the various universes from an infinite altitude. Their every point overlapped together, and to him, there was no more distance and he was everywhere!</p><p>His consciousness spread and linked to some of the universes that he could currently not see. The previous additional self image rapidly expanded, absorbing the sea of energy. Inside the rest of the world, projection imprints were formed naturally.</p><p>Correspondingly, in the real world, the sky suddenly darkened and then started showing some stars, more than ever before. It was like a gathering of stars from the various worlds, forming a sea of brilliant lights, looking dreamy and mysterious.</p><p>“Shining Stars Forming a Sea, the present strongest,” Wu Yanping woke up from feeling the golden stones, and could not help but gasp.</p><p>For Dharmakaya experts, they were able to foresee this vision and hence only lament.</p><p>Inside the Eastern Pure Land of Azure Stones, the body of Meng Qi, who was sitting opposite the Moonlight Bodhisattva, was constantly reorganizing. His acupoints turned into universes, his interiors showed the various heavens, his real spirit returned to his nature, his nature went back to the beginning which belonged to chaos, and Yuanshi was sitting in the middle.</p><p>Splendid colors flew out in succession, the multiverse expanded, seemingly getting closer to reality, but was still a little far off and appeared illusory.</p><p>Creak!</p><p>The multiverse, which had yet to fully grow put pressure on the Eastern Pure Land of Azure Stones, causing it to shake slightly. Splendid colors gathered outside to form layers of universes in the sky. At where the universes were, were the illusory Netherworld and Celestial World. Imaginary and illusory, they seemed to be another world.</p><p>“Namo Medicine Buddha,” seeing this, the Moonlight Bodhisattva’s chanted as her expression changed slightly.</p><p>“The fourth, the fourth vision?” Wu Yanping opened his mouth, unable to believe his eyes.</p><p>None of the classics have ever mentioned that there will be a fourth vision!</p><p>What vision is this?</p><p>He felt that his cognition wasn’t sufficient.</p><p>Even Mister Lu Da, Su Wuming, Jiang Zhiwei, and so on were quite surprised, not knowing what this vision was. Only Han Guang, Qi Zhengyan, Master Wang, and Liu Luo in Plain Girl Fairyland nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>…</p><p>In the depths of the real world, there was a star that looked ordinary. But if you got close to it, you would realize that it was just a mountain, one as big as a star.</p><p>Two men in Taoist attire stood on the top of the mountain, looking at the inexplicable vision in the sky and blurted out, “Two Worlds Exist Simultaneously!”</p><p>“This is a vision of Nirvana!”</p><p>The mighty character who self-attained the Legendary realm actually achieved the Nirvana vision of Two Worlds Exist Simultaneously!</p><p>How could this be?</p><p>“It is said that if someone from our sect achieved the real form of Yuanshi, this vision will appear when he attained the Legendary realm…” one of them frowned as he pondered.</p><p>The other one was stunned, “But who can achieve the true form of Yuanshi?”</p><p>“No matter what, the first self-attained Legendary character of the current era has appeared. According to the Heavenly Lord’s instructions, we have to wake him up in advance,” the Taoist-attired man who spoke first said solemnly.</p><p>They quickly walked down the peak and went deep into the mountains.</p><p>And this star-sized mountain was named Nine Immortal Mountain!</p><p>…</p><p>Bi Jingxuan stood at the edge of the pool, and was stunned when she saw three chaotic lotuses accelerating their growth.</p><p>In every hidden part of the real world and in the depths of the stars, many internal functions changed because of the emergence of the first Legendary character of the current era, and many ancient gods and celestial beings were about to return.</p><p>They all sighed emotionally with the same words in their sleep, “Two Worlds Exist Simultaneously, Primitive Emperor Su Meng!”</p><p>…</p><p>In the darkness without the Wanderer Lamp, the The Last Ship could not reach the border. Shaoxuan and Xi’e settled themselves down and communicated with the Invincible Blade, looking for a way to get out of this strange enchanted boundary of the Celestial Lamp Ambassador.</p><p>From an infinite altitude, the pair of indifferent eyes looked down quietly.</p><p>At this moment, the purple long blade in the hands of Shaoxuan suddenly burst into light, broke away from his control and flew up on its own into the sky.</p><p>Following it with their eyes, Shaoxuan and Xi’e saw a huge palm in the</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
