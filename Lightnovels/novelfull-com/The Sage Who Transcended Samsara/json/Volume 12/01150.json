Shouldn’t we just convert to the Luo Sect already?”</p><p>The person who posted this was nicknamed ‘Unnamed Insider,’ he said with a sad and doubtful tone, “In the last six months, the demon race repeatedly attacked the west. At first, there were Heavenly Sword and Mister Luda who lent a helping hand, but were both attacked by an inexplicable aura that struck through the air, making them retreat due to injury. This time, there was not even a Righteous Dharmakaya to come forward, neither the current emperor nor that person from Kunlun Mountain Jade Palace appeared.”</p><p>“We have long known these circumstances and under the pressure of the Demon Race, it is not difficult to guess that this time the enemy is most likely the Great Sage of the demon race of either ancient remnants or from a current breakthrough. In short, the origin is not important, what is important is that we have to face the Legendary Great Sage. The terrifying thing is that initially, the Legendary Great Sage may have sustained hidden injuries and thus did not directly attack, but merely directed an aura infestation. However, the fact that the top ranks of the Heavenly List supremes are now afraid to help is enough to indicate that he has recovered completely to return and is lurking in the Demon Race army. Hence, the West remained silent and no Dharmakaya appeared, until the Luo Sect Oracle came.”</p><p>“I believe everyone understands the wide gap between Celestial Beings and the Legends from parts of the ancient classics that have been passed down to the present. As the only one in all worlds, the essence of metamorphosis is not a joke, no matter how many Celestial Beings there are, without the correspondence of the Peerless Heavenly Weapon and great formations, the Legend is completely untouchable.”</p><p>“Under these circumstances, it is meaningless to rank the Heavenly List. Before the Legendary Great Sage, those we deem as supremes were just mere ants and moths, what is the use of distinguishing between the first and the second ranked?”</p><p>“And the only one able to resist the Great Sage of the demon race, I believe everyone has seen, is the Luo Sect Oracle who is also a mighty person of the Legendary Realm!”</p><p>“With terrans as their foundation, the Luo Sect gives a peaceful final home to many lives and is an enemy with the imperial court, so what harm is it to us? Once we believe in the Ajati Matriarch, not only do we get the protection of the Legendary Oracle against harm from the demon race, we also achieve eternal life after death and are able to achieve bliss in the Void Hometown. Faith is the only sacrifice made, unaffecting family relations, the harmony of wives and children, as well as social relationships and friendships, just like believing in the Earth Goddess of High Heaven.”</p><p>There were very few replies to this post, of which included replies saying that the original poster should eat well and drink well as the yamen had already set out to arrest evil cult members. Other replies included pretentious laughs saying that the post would soon be deleted. On the surface, it looked hilarious and aided a cheerful atmosphere, but since the matter was with regards to the West, it seemed exceptionally unusual and ironic.</p><p>In contrast, the post was viewed by a wide audience and silently, some changes were already brewing.</p><p>In less than a quarter of an hour, the replies’ prediction was affirmed and the post was tragically deleted without a trace. However, the long silence of major forums on the myriad world access suddenly became active again, full of posts with headings like ‘Personal experience of the demon race invasion’ or ‘My sleepless day in the West” that described the situation at the time, including arguments about various details. As such, the issue could be seen almost everywhere.</p><p>There were those who frighteningly recalled, “At the time before the demon race arrived, everyone in the entire city was inexplicably afraid where the weak lay limp on the ground and the strong were fearful with trepidation. Even Dharmakayas of Half-Step were said to have kept silent out of fear and had difficulty in running their own Mana. They could only wait for death.”</p><p>“Since when did this even happen? Scared to death before the demon race appeared? Don’t blame the demon race for your own timidness!” some would retort.</p><p>While some people reasoned, “The inexperienced make such a big deal out of this, this is the horror of a Legendary being! Without even appearing and with just unconcealed bad intention toward their target, they are able to cause similar effects. It is just like before the coming of a major disaster when people with a keen sensory will have a bad feeling, such as a heavy heart. This is an instinctive premonition and the malice of the bad intention of mighty people of the Legendary Realm are able to amplify this by a hundred times or even a thousand times!”</p><p>It was better when the issue was not in debate, but once the debate started, the tyrannical terror of the mighty people of the Legendary Realm became more far-fetched, filling people with fear, causing the whole myriad world access to be filled with an atmosphere that could only be described as the calm before the storm.</p><p>Great Zhou, Changle, yamen headquarters.</p><p>All the Condors and corresponding Golden-Stamped Detectives gathered in front of the chief of detectives, Sima Shi with solemn expressions in the midst of a silent atmosphere.</p><p>“The Luo Sect demons are taking advantage of the opportunity to mess with the hearts of the people, what say you all on how to deal with this issue?” Sima Shi kneaded his temples. After acquiring the status of a Dharmakaya, he had been quite high-spirited but in the last six months, honestly speaking from his heart, he seemed to have aged several years worrying over this issue.</p><p>A Golden-Stamped Detective said heavily, “Controversial title, restrict discussion about the West, restrict discussion about the abilities of the Legendary being, restrict any mention the Luo Sect and the demon race!”</p><p>“Yes, press down this matter as soon as possible to prevent the spread of panic,” the veteran Flying Dragon Condor Zhao Mingche agreed.</p><p>“With the people in panic, this matter cannot be contained for long. Since the matter has already broken out, I’m afraid the idea of keeping it down is useless unless the mouths of the people can be shut and all users of the Myriad World Talisman are sealed off. Otherwise, they may just use codes to communicate in secret language just like when someone talks about His Majesty behind his back, no one will directly mention the current emperor or the emperor of the Present World but will instead replace the term with Twelfth Eldest and Vairocana. Where these terms will evolve with the times and change often, are you all even able to seal it off?” a newly promoted Condor immediately retorted. He was quite young and seemed to be part of the generation that had grown up with the myriad world access.</p><p>Ten years was enough for those who were somewhat talented to step up as a newcomer to the Exterior Realm to become a guru.</p><p>“Twelfth Eldest? Vairocana?” Condor Gao Gong asked. He was quite old and had a very high seniority in Changle Gaozhi, but his use of the Myriad World Talisman was limited only to calling communications and thus he did not really understand terms used on the forum.</p><p>Sima Shi pressed his temples as he smiled slightly, “His Majesty is the twelfth Emperor of the Great Zhou Dynasty, so he is called the Twelfth Eldest. On the other hand, Vairocana came from a certain strange book sold in the Myriad World Mall, which mentioned a double star system composed of Vairocana and Chaotic Hole. So His Majesty who has the title of the glorious double stars of the era is also known as Vairocana whereas correspondingly, the Devil Master Han Guang is known as the Chaotic Hole.”</p><p>As the chief of detectives of the yamen, he was no stranger to the situations on the myriad world access as it was a requirement of his duty.</p><p>“Oh, that’s what it is.” Gao Gong did not say much but frowned and said, “In this case, it is indeed not easy to seal off the matter, but once this matter spreads and ferments, then the foundation of the Great Zhou Dynasty will be shaken!”</p><p>The people’s belief will be lost as well!</p><p>“If we had known earlier, we should have stopped the Myriad World Knowledge Ball service in the West after Mister Luda and the Heavenly Sword were hurt when the demon race intruded into the West and not allow fear to pervade the whole of the myriad world access!” the original proposer of the controversial title ban Golden-Stamped Detective wringed his hand and sighed.</p><p>Sima Shi let go of his temples and waved his right hand, “The myriad world access is still a novelty and mistakes are inevitable as we are inexperienced with it. At the time itself, I did not expect the panic to spread at such a rate. More importantly, the decision to seal off the entire Myriad World Knowledge Ball service in the West is not up to the yamen to decide, even His Majesty is unable to decide upon it. The only way is for me to personally visit the Kunlun Mountain Jade Palace to see the Primitive Emperor.”</p><p>Afterwards, he stood up with his hands behind his back, pacing back and forth while he was thinking and said, “Since matters have come to this point, we can only make up for it as much as possible. Firstly, people must be sent to make contact with the Luo Sect and find out their intentions to see if they can be allied. It is fine even if we lose out a little, as long as such an alliance can be maintained to obtain more time for His Majesty. Secondly, the discussions in the myriad world access must be controlled where only posts that purposefully create fear and panic are deleted. Let our people post more arguments to direct focus on the idea that there are mighty people of the Legendary Realm that survived within the Terran race and that they will return to help the Emperor…”</p><p>Sima Shi had long since discussed such plans under similar situations with the few Golden-Stamped Detectives familiar with the myriad world access. Now that all plans were voiced out, the confidence in which it was said, greatly alleviated the internal fear of the yamen.</p><p>After making the arrangements, a Condor could not help but ask, “Chief of detectives, what was His Majesty’s reaction to the matter of the West? What about the one in Kunlun Mountain?”</p><p>The Emperor and the Primitive Emperor had rarely appeared for many years and where this demon race matter did not even alarm them, there was not a single person who did not want to know about their recent situation and their thoughts on the matter.</p><p>Sima Shi mused for a bit and said, “His Majesty has melded with the Myriad World successfully and has absorbed a lot of the reflected self to open up a lot of Humane Lands. Hence, even with the unrest in the West, there was no reduction in the Forces of Living Beings which increased day by day instead. However, even since the ancient mythological era, there is a limit to the mighty people of the Legendary Realm, so it is difficult to say when His Majesty will be able to break through.”</p><p>“As for the one in the Jade Palace, there was praise of him being the strongest Celestial Being of all past generations a few years ago. Now that more than three years have passed and even though the possibility of improving is not small, but the boundary difficulties of a Legend is not so easy to overcome. Seeing that he did not step in during the attacks from the demon race, it seems that he may still be missing the last key step.”</p><p>Without understanding I am who I am, the absorption of however much reflected self would still not fully complete the qualitative change in evolution.</p><p>Listening to the words of Sima Shi, the Golden-Stamped Detectives fell into silence. Heavenly Sword Su Wuming was also said to have missed the last step, why was it so difficult to produce a new Legend in the Terran race?</p><p>At this moment, they felt a vibration from the depths of the palace and with a blurring of sight before their eyes, they saw Gao Lan clad in a yellow emperor’s robe, his lips thin and cool, radiating an incomparable handsome beauty.</p><p>“Your Majesty!” Sima Shi and the others were surprised but then immediately bowed down with inexplicable expectation in their hearts. Had His Majesty broken through the Legendary bottleneck?</p><p>Gao Lan nodded slightly with both hands behind his back and said, “The world is unpredictable. If I was given another ten years of time, until all the mighty people of the Legendary Realm returned and all the stars aligned, breakthrough would not be unachievable, but what I can think of, how can the important men not think of, too? So Ajati Matriarch with her wonderful grace, firstly allowed Oracle Juan Lian to make an early return, and now that the rest of the Oracles are awakening, the demon race will likewise not be willing to fall behind. Hence, they released the remnants of the Great Sage in advance.”</p><p>He had kept constant communications with Meng Qi, and with the Emperor’s Sword sense for enemies, he had a clear understanding of the current situation.</p><p>Sima Shi and the others listened until they ended up looking at each other in dismay, not expecting that there was more than one mighty person of the Legendary Realm within the demon race and the Luo Sect!</p><p>Gao Lan said steadily, “How can there be any smooth sailing waters for the matters of the world? How can there be constant developments that always suit one’s heart? I have long since prepared for this, that is why I came out of meditation earlier.”</p><p>He stretched both his hands out in front of him and as a long light golden sword and a Golden Book with pages glimmering with light appeared in his hands, he raised his head proudly to shout.</p><p>“Where are the descendants of the emperor!”</p><p>The long sword dazzled with golden rays as it shot into the sky, through the clouds and reaching into the depths of space, to reach a huge planet.</p><p>The descendants of the emperor were supposed to be destroyed in the Chaos of the Devil Buddha, but with Gao Lan’s hint, they had escaped and moved away to the depths of the Real World, continuing their heritage for tens of thousands of years to produce generations of strong beings that guarded the secrets left by the emperor. They had not interfered with the Real World and with the accumulation they had now, they would become more terrifying once the worldly restrictions were released.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
