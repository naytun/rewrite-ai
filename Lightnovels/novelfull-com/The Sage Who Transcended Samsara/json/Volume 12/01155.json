He had just taken a few steps when suddenly he paused and scratched his head. Turning back, he gave an awkward smile, “Erm, well, Primeval Deity, do you think you can lend me some money? My money is all locked and I can’t take them out without my power…”</p><p>I can’t possibly swim back to the mainland from the island?</p><p>Without martial arts and power, everything seemed to be inconvenient. Even the Myriad World Talisman couldn’t be taken out, so was temporarily uncontactable!</p><p>Bi Jingxuan was silent for a moment before finally throwing out a bag of golden leaves. It was bulging shining in between the gaps, and obviously worth a lot.</p><p>Meng Qi took the bag of golden leaves and forced a laughed before thanking again, “I will return it immediately after returning to Jade Mirage Palace.”</p><p>This trip to the Island of Three Clouds was really too embarrassing and awkward. Luckily he had always been thick-skinned and could still act as if nothing happened.</p><p>Bi Jingxuan still remained silent.</p><p>Meng Qi packed the golden leaves properly in the bag, turned and left. In front of him were waves hitting the shore, and behind him and on both sides were the cliffs standing tall. Strength comes from having no desires. In short, he came by walking on the waves and did not deliberately arrive from the port. He was currently in an area of the Island of Three Clouds that had neither man nor ships, and it seemed that he couldn’t get out other than by swimming.</p><p>“Haha,” back-facing the clouds, he forced a laugh before turning and scratching his head. “Deity, could you send me to the port on the way? I will never forget your great kindness.”</p><p>If he still had martial arts, he could easily solve this problem by stepping on the auspicious cloud. Even if he was only left with basic powers, flipping over the mountains was still a simple feat.</p><p>Unfortunately, inside the Yellow River Formation and under the Primeval Dipper, his power no longer existed and the true Yuan is difficult to protect. Not only was his Dharmakaya body back to a normal body, even his opened acupoints were completely closed and his dantian was empty. He could only be regarded as an ordinary person who was strong and healthy.</p><p>Bi Jingxuan was still silent. Suddenly, there was a gust of wind blowing, accompanied by white clouds. With a gentle twist, Meng Qi’s body was in the air.</p><p>His vision turned blurry all of a sudden, and he was already at the port of the Island of Three Clouds, where there was a huge number of tower ships. The sounds of greetings, selling, bargaining, and chattering went into his ears undistinguished. It was a series of clamor but without the feeling of clarity and subtleness.</p><p>After the acupoints on his ears were closed, it was difficult for him to distinguish so many sounds.</p><p>Not bothering to lament, Meng Qi’s eyes looked around for a passenger ship that he could board, eagerly wanting to leave the Island of Three Clouds and forget the embarrassing memory earlier on.</p><p>Darn, why did I forget to ask Bi Jingxuan to send me nearer to the long distance transfer, this bag of gold leaves should be enough to return to the vicinity of Donghai Sword Village… at this moment, he silently scolded himself. Having lost his martial arts and being faced with embarrassment, he wasn’t able to act normally, appearing flustered and failed to make the best choice. So how could he still find Bi Jingxuan to help now?</p><p>Was it true that his complete state of mind and pure spirit that were obtained after all the hardships and obstacles were so illusory and totally based on martial arts?</p><p>What about the realization between life and death? What about the generosity that rose to the challenge? The quiet and calm patience?</p><p>As these thoughts emerged, Meng Qi’s mind gradually regained its calmness, no longer feeling lost.</p><p>Even without martial arts, how could the years of experience and training be for nothing?</p><p>If being without martial arts made him become a panicky greenhorn, he would have lived all these years for nothing!</p><p>As thoughts slowly went through his mind, Meng Qi gazed afar with his hands behind his back, walking leisurely even though he was amidst pedestrians walking in both directions.</p><p>Forget it, I’ll just take it as a toughening experience, a journey in search of true self.</p><p>After a while, he resumed his calm observation and analysis. He found a tower ship that was about to set off and became its last passenger. Without having to wait long, the whistle blew. Blue waves lined up at both sides as the ship started sailing slowly.</p><p>Standing on the deck and watching the seagulls being scared away, Meng Qi started thinking about what to do next.</p><p>At this moment, there was a sigh in his ear, “The machine-operated ship from the Palace of Mohism is really powerful, it’s not only fast but also very strong It’s just been a few years and it has already begun to replace sailboats.”</p><p>Looking sideways, Meng Qi saw that it was a man in his early thirties. He was dressed up in an ordinary manner and was full of energy. His every move showed no signs of him being powerful.</p><p>“Yeah, who would have thought of what it would be like today more than a decade ago,” Meng Qi smiled and replied casually, having a rich experience of chatting with people on the train.</p><p>The man nodded hard, “Exactly. More than a decade ago, I wouldn’t even dream of something that could be used to contact a stranger thousands of miles away, that I could know about the world without going out of my house, and that the world is so interesting. What is so great about Bai Xiaosheng? Everyone is Bai Xiaosheng!”</p><p>Many people joined in the discussion and talked about the changes they felt in the past few years. A small portion was brought by the Palace of Mohism most were caused by the Myriad World Talisman. Meng Qi secretly felt smug listening to them and couldn’t help but change his posture, but he suddenly slipped and was about to fall when the man next to him supported him.</p><p>“The deck has just been cleaned, you have to be careful,” the man warned with a smile.</p><p>Meng Qi’s lips moved, wanting to laugh but couldn’t, feeling emotional. He had noticed that the deck was wet and slippery, but he hadn’t bothered about such trivial things all these years. He was able to stabilize himself and put up a fight even with his eyes closed for this level of slipperiness. Unfortunately, this was no longer the case. Other than knowledge, he knew no martial arts at all, so he had to be vigilant even about the trivial things that he did not care about in the past.</p><p>Therefore, not only could he not rely on martial arts anymore, his past experience also couldn’t be totally copied.</p><p>“Thank you, I was too engrossed listening and didn’t pay attention to what’s under my feet.” Meng Qi cupped his hands together as greeting, “May I ask for your name?”</p><p>No one really bothered much about him almost slipping. The man smiled and said, “My name is Huang Chang, native of the Island of Three Clouds. I’m neither successful in learning martial arts nor doing business, and have been unaccomplished for more than a decade…”</p><p>Hearing him say so, everyone else knew there was more coming up, so they all turned around and waited for the real story.</p><p>Huang Chang continued, “I had thought that I would be like that for the rest of my life, but who knows there is the Primitive Emperor in the world and also the Myriad World Talisman which have broadened my horizons and made me discover many opportunities.”</p><p>“I was actually quite lucky. As I had studied in a private school before, I can read. Otherwise, even if I got hold of the Myriad World Talisman, I would just use it as a communication item and unable to bring into play its real use like most people. Recently, I found out in the forum that the Palace of Mohism has the idea of opening up the deserted island in the Southern Sea but lacked manpower. I thought that this was an opportunity, so I sold my ancestral home and am preparing to go there to fight for some wealth.”</p><p>The people around him nodded and agreed in succession. One of them even felt the same way, “In the past, traveling to the various islands and selling goods were subjected to checkpoints, rents and shipping expenses. Now the Myriad World Mall is convenient and has little burden. There are many buyers and the amount earned in one year is more than earned in a decade in the past, just that express delivery is quite expensive, but fortunately there’s no need to include shipping for far distances.”</p><p>Having said that, he said sincerely with a hand on his chest, “Praise the Primitive Emperor.”</p><p>“I have even built a worship hall for the Primitive Emperor at home, but the Primitive Emperor is indeed a real immortal, the top powerful character in the world. He once went deep into the netherworld and killed the evil god, his power is incredible and it is right and natural to worship him…”</p><p>They started talking about the Primitive Emperor, making Meng Qi who was listening at the side feel very complicated, as though he was listening to the stories of others. Him in the story was awe-inspiring, kind, serious, compassionate, and admired by the world, but the real him was just an ordinary person in front of them who almost slipped on the deck.</p><p>Even if he admitted that he was the Primitive Emperor, they wouldn’t believe it.</p><p>The strong contrast and inexplicable feelings made Meng Qi let out a sigh. Using fatigue as an excuse, he walked toward the cabin, instinctively sizing up the surrounding passengers and classifying them.</p><p>Some of them were merchants and some were powerful people of the pugilistic world. There was a black-robed man who required some attention, his eyes were closed like a blind man, but he walked without any hindrance as though he could see with his heart and was practising some sort of eye magic skill.</p><p>After walking past him, two small figures suddenly appeared in front of Meng Qi. Because the deck was too slippery, they fell beside him.</p><p>They were a pair of twins, a boy and a girl, about six or seven years old. Fair and cute-looking, their lips were flatly pressed, looking like they were about to cry.</p><p>Meng Qi squatted and held them up, patted the dust on their hands and said, “Don’t run around, the floor is slippery, where are the adults in your family?”</p><p>“Mom didn’t want to tell us stories, so we ran out,” the little boy said miserably.</p><p>The little girl handed him a book and blinked her big eyes, “Uncle, tell us a story.”</p><p>Reminded of his childhood when he begged his parents to tell him stories, Meng Qi felt happy and took the book, planning to do a good deed. He looked over intensely, only to see the title of the book was The Primitive Emperor Battles Against the Transformers.</p><p>…</p><p>What the heck… what book is this? Why didn’t I know about such a story book? Meng Qi’s mouth twitched. Although the Myriad World Talisman that got to the Transformers’ universe had made many people in the Myriad World know more or less about this magical life form, but someone who could write The Primitive Emperor Battles Against the Transformers must have extraordinary brains…</p><p>After a while, Meng Qi put down the book and smiled, “I’ve finished the latter part of the story.”</p><p>“Uncle, uncle, can you tell us another one?” the twins begged in unison.</p><p>Meng Qi thought for a while and said in a serious tone, “Then let me tell a real story, it is my personal experience.”</p><p>“In a place called the Three Mountains and Four Waters, there was a meteorite that fell from the sky…”</p><p>…</p><p>“I stabbed with a sword, hitting somewhere on the shaft, causing the monk to stumble forward. Then I moved sideways and used my sword to end his life, the guy behind him did even have the chance to give pointers…”</p><p>The twins applauded, “Uncle, you’re really amazing!”</p><p>At this moment, the little girl stared blankly for a while and then pouted, “Uncle you’re bad, mom said that you’re lying and you do not have such abilities. You must have used the deeds of others and adapt them to your own to brag.”</p><p>This is really my own experience… Meng Qi broke into laughter. He suddenly recalled when Xuanxin bragged about himself stopping the Ice Fairy from fighting with the Flying Yaksha, he was also exposed and ridiculed by him. There is indeed karma and reincarnation in the world.</p><p>Remembering this, he couldn’t help but laugh again, until his tears almost flowed out.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
