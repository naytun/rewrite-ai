Without anyone noticing, the shadow of a man with a yellow robe and tassels that covered his face appeared. He stared at Sha Wujing quietly. Despite Sha Wujing being a legend and experiencing the Pilgrimage to the West, he still trembled with fear. The scepter in his hand turned into a real dragon accompanied with the sound of copper rings intertwining, and it isolated out a world with its own heaven and earth.</p><p>At this moment, the figure of the emperor suddenly stepped forward, and the glimmer which was shining from his eyes passed through the tassels.</p><p>Before Sha Wujing had the time to think, his Divine Sense became vague, and his body, together with the scepter, were inexplicably compressed. He turned into a thin layer of paper, as if he was an actualized drawing. The similar drawings were stacked, and there were projections of him from different universes, linked to each other just like a comic strip.</p><p>The comic strip was collapsing, and the figures of the paper men huddled together into a group of words before flashing toward the emperor who was old and mysterious. It finally fell into his palm and merged into a common book.</p><p>The cover of the book was written with its title consisting of azure-like gold characters:</p><p>“The biography of Sha Wujing!”</p><p>In just a few moments, a legendary mighty person had became a book which recorded the projection of his life!</p><p>The precinct of the ancient Fusang trees was really strange and shocking!</p><p>Suddenly, radiance emitted from the book. Without any wind, the pages moved on its own, flipping to the Spirited Mountain part. The words mysterious corpse were highlighted, floating above the book and blooming in infinite light. It shone directly onto the eyes of the emperor’s figure.</p><p>The emperor with tassels covering his face raised his left hand to cover his eyes. He yelled in an illusory pain and stepped back in a rush, crashing and collapsing as if an imaginary bubble had been popped.</p><p>The book rolled to the ground and swelled under the shining of boundless light, and the words flew out and merged into figures of paper men. The paper men became bigger just like balloons being blown, until it finally displayed Sha Wujing and his countless reflected selves.</p><p>The reflected selves returned to their respective Myriad Worlds. Sha Wujing touched the pouch on his waist and said with appreciation,</p><p>“Thank goodness for mom’s great foresight.”</p><p>It was terrifying when he had to battle with this kind of strange enemy who couldn’t be accurately evaluated by grades. Even if he cooperated with Zhang Deng, he might also turn into a book without the pre-guiding and long term preparation from his mother. Moreover, perhaps he would be passed to children, be read and told by them, and finally torn into pieces with no trace left behind.</p><p>His pale and colorless eyes looked at the top of the ancient Fusang tree which was where the emperor with tassels was standing a while ago. The mulberry leaves surrounded a fruit. It looked slightly transparent, and its color was dark. It reflected the things around just like a strangely designed mirror.</p><p>Sha Wujing gently sucked in a breath and solemnly recited,</p><p>“Ajati Matriarch, the Void Hometown.”</p><p>The blossoming white lotus emerged and surrounded his right hand. He then directed his right hand to that fruit in order to pick it up.</p><p>Once he succeeded, he immediately destroyed that green grave and the accumulated white flowers left by the previous holy maiden. He erased all her preparations, and then returned to the Void Hometown with the fastest speed.</p><p>This fruit was of great importance. Once it appears, there would be many people who would aim for it!</p><p>…</p><p>In front the ancient Fusang tree, there were colors of red, green, black, and white making noises similar to that of boiling water. The Celestial Lamp Ambassador had a real battle with Shaoxuan and Xi’e. They no longer held back, causing the nearby void to collapse and the rules of heaven and earth to turn into chaos. The four elements plagued everything along with it, leading to a scene as if heaven and earth had experienced its first great damage.</p><p>The Last Ship was surrounded with the yellow scent, infiltrating with the water of Holy Virtue. It avoided the four elements while attempting to overcome the damage as it sailed toward the Celestial Lamp Ambassador amidst the aforementioned colors.</p><p>While Xi’e tried her best to control the Last Ship, Shaoxuan combined his direct knowledge and martial arts skills with the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade. It shot out its strength and power, making the Wanderer Lamp flicker and the right hand of the Celestial Lamp Ambassador to be scorched and trembling slightly.</p><p>He was strong enough and had laid out the Ten Directions of the Wanderer’s Azure World. When facing the Last Ship and the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade, together with two legendary mighty people with a similar level, the Celestial Lamp Ambassador felt like he was unable to cope with them and he was being forced to come forward step by step.</p><p>It seemed the Last Ship was coming towards him, almost arriving at the ancient Fusang tree. The Celestial Lamp Ambassador’s expression remained unchanged, but his eyes were more dignified. He raised his right hand’s sleeves and it changed the heaven and earth, the World in the Sleeve!</p><p>Heaven and earth were dark, and the four elements disappeared. The Last Ship flew into the sleeve of the Celestial Lamp Ambassador.</p><p>He immediately sat cross-legged, placing the Wanderer Lamp in his right hand. The light converged and condensed into numerous glazed crystals, completely covering the sleeves.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The sleeves swayed, one expanded and another shrunk.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The thunder echoed, and the sleeves expanded rapidly.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The thunder resonated together with the explosion while the purple electricity and giant ship flew together, breaking through the sleeve, crushing the lights and glaze.</p><p>At this moment, there was an infinite and boundless light shining downwards from above the ancient Fusang tree.</p><p>Seeing that Shaoxuan and Xi’e had escaped from the trouble and arrived at the ancient Fusang tree, the Celestial Lamp Ambassador had a slight change in expression. He suddenly sighed and spit out a white wave which directly blew out the Wanderer Lamp!</p><p>When the lights went out, the Three Realms were dim. Shao Xuan and Xi’e felt that they were in a boundless darkness. They couldn’t distinguish the direction, for even if they were riding on the Last Ship they still couldn’t find their way.</p><p>The ancient Fusang tree was just in front, but they could no longer see it. At the infinity peak, the Celestial Lamp Ambassador’s eyes which were filled with indifference and looked down on them quietly!</p><p>…</p><p>“I am Yuanshi!”</p><p>Meng Qi was shocked, and the self-perception that did not disappear almost collapsed.</p><p>He had always had great fear in his heart as he was afraid to fall into the trap of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi after getting rid of the Devil Buddha. When he created and absorbed the projection of the reflected self, he always balanced the two sides and found a way out.</p><p>At this moment, in his congenital nature, he actually met a mysterious Taoist who claimed to be Yuanshi!</p><p>Could it be that the real intention has been revealed?</p><p>Could it be that the oldest and most powerful Nirvana Realm Individual had always been hidden in his nature?</p><p>Meng Qi’s experience, memory, and cognitive fragments were spinning fast, forming numerous modes of thinking, constantly deriving and sparking with wisdom.</p><p>Upon achieving Legendary status and seeing the self, it was actually fairly normal to see some of the big characters in the congenital nature. Many of the legendary parts of the ancient books that remained to this day did record similar phenomena.</p><p>Among them, the most common figure was Lord Ling Bao. He was the symbol of having, from having to nothing, it included the end of heaven and earth, so it was also the Creation Aura of all things and the origin of the congenital nature. After cutting myself to see me and returning to the cogenitial, seeing the figure was an expected occurrence.</p><p>Secondly, it was the figure of Lord Dao De. The cogenitial I came directly from the Da Dao and was the closest to the Da Dao. Meanwhile, Lord Dao De was the incarnation of Da Dao, which was the order of the existence of the Myriad World and was coincidentally corresponding to the closest to Da Dao. There was a lot of the ancient mighty people who saw him when they broke through to the Legendary realm in the congenital nature.</p><p>It was followed by the Buddism Maha Bodhisattva and the Great Luohan. When achieving the Buddha attainment, they would see the Buddha Golden Body, but the appearance of the statue was their own appearance.</p><p>But for one to be able to see the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi’s figure when achieving the Legendary realm was something no one had ever heard of!</p><p>Was the oldest Nirvana Realm Individual coming out from behind the scenes and going to the front of the stage?</p><p>The danger was emerging. Based on his instinct, Meng Qi withdrew from this situation. During the past, he would follow his accurate hunch and not hesitate to complete his actions.</p><p>However, after experiencing the abandonment of the strength of martial arts, he has already realized that his hunch could not be relied upon. Even if they have been shown to be correct again and again, and they have helped him to avoid death, but he couldn’t fully believe and rely on them as they were likely to go wrong.</p><p>Looking around, Meng Qi did not recklessly withdraw as he immediately realized that something was wrong.</p><p>Based on his current capability, it was difficult to escape if the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi took action.</p><p>In this case, why not face him directly and figure out the whole story!</p><p>Exploring with his cognitive abilities, Meng Qi found that the ancient Taoist was extremely illusory, and had a sense of established self!</p><p>Established self?</p><p>There were lightning and thunder appearing in Meng Qi’s mind. With a boom, it illuminated the darkness and he realized the reason.</p><p>He owned the characteristics of Nirvana Realm, so of course he was different from other Legendaries.</p><p>If every congenital nature backtracked upon on time, experienced the replacement of three souls and returned to the beginning, they would come from the beginning of everything and thus be able to see Yuanshi.</p><p>As the saying goes, as long as the heart can see Buddha, then everyone is Yuanshi!</p><p>If he couldn’t cut himself to see himself, and just made a wrong decision based on experience, cognition, and instinct, the moment he drops out, he would never be able to achieve Legendary status in the next few decades!</p><p>He looked at the Premier Taoist and burst into laughter,</p><p>“It’s me!”</p><p>The Premier Taoist laughed as well,</p><p>“It’s you!”</p><p>He stepped forward and the figure disappeared. Now, Meng Qi was seated on the place where the Premier Taoist was earlier!</p><p>He felt his whole body become clear instantly and could sense the resonance from the infinity peak.</p><p>At the beginning, the creatures were legend. They lived at the infinity peak and projected the world. It then changed and the projection became reflected self while the original self would lower the origin. Now, the clear resonance were exactly where it should be.</p><p>The characteristics were coming forward with their perfectly matched origins. The lines of karma were highlighted, connecting the reflected self projections, and they transformed with qualitative change, forming a golden Nirvana Realm lotus that bloomed with excessively bright light.</p><p>The golden lotus platform bringing Meng Qi’s reflected self passed through layers of obstacles and flew toward the infinity peak.</p><p>Meng Qi formed a Wu’Ji Seal with both his hands. With a smile, he spoke in a low voice,</p><p>“Passing through the mountains barefoot, without asking for help from deities or Buddha.”</p><p>“Only upon seeing Yuanshi at the end of the path did I finally know I am myself!”</p><p>The sound echoed, and the void shook. The Moonlight Bodhisattva watched as Meng Qi’s body emitted colorful lights and fell into the Real World.</p><p>Above the air of the Real World, the mist emerged by layers. It was broken and silent, and the highest place was blurry and difficult to see.</p><p>“Celestial world crossing the horizon?” In a secret place, Devil Master Han Guang suddenly stood up and looked out, “This is a phenomenon of legendary realm self-achievement!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
