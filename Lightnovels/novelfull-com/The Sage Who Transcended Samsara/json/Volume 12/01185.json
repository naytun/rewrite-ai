When the Bull Demon King was flustered by Nezha as if he was back in the times of the Pilgrimage to the West, he realized that he needed to try his best and use all means and direct knowledge. If not, he would return in defeat and would even get caught again.</p><p>Normally, when facing a situation where the enemy could be ubiquitous while you could not, the best solution would be to divide it into two realms, building your own heaven and earth. Replace the Heavenly Will with your own will to create a small universe which you can move freely inside. Use this as a battlefield to offset the disadvantages or to affect the opponent just like how the Luo Sect’s Big Four Oracles relied on the projection force from the Lifeless Heaven and Void Hometown to recreate a realm in order to avoid Meng Qi from escaping with his ubiquitous skill. It was also like how Maitreya descended and struck after having the Heaven Conferring Platform and Changle separated.</p><p>Of course, this was to prevent the aftermath from raging. Thus, preventing the Real World from suffering severe damages and himself from suffering the horrible backlash. Just like the presence of the beautiful picture of mountains and rivers, if it is destroyed, the terrain of Great Zhou would be destroyed as well, and the Real World’s core area would be destroyed if the terrain of Great Zhou is destroyed. Destroying the Real World’s core area would be to destroy the hub of the Heavens and Myriad World. This would surely trigger terrifying counterattacks from multi universes which no one would be able to handle except the Nirvana Legends and those Evil Demons who managed to please the Nine Levels of Underground.</p><p>During a fight, those who had achieved the Legendary Realm and the Creation Realm would either control their forces with extreme precision to bring out the most effective strike, and the collisions would cancel each other out. Thus the aftermath would just be a series of furious storms which would not bring any serious damage. If not, they would fight seriously with no room for control. At this point, only destroying cities, slaughtering the Terran race, moving mountains and draining seas and changing the phenomena would not be enough. Now, there were many stars that were shining like the bright moon hanging high in the sky. It was the predecessors of the fragments of the Real World. Thus, the result could be easily figured out!</p><p>The mighty people of the Great Medium would be relatively cautious since the damage caused by the aftermath was uncontrollable. They would use the Universe of the Internal Realm as a foundation to create a battlefield with self-contained boundaries to pin down each other. It was not only a battle of their direct knowledge and martial arts but also a battle of the greatness of their Interior Realm, strength of realm and nature restrictions.</p><p>This was the normal circumstance. It was also what the Bull Demon King was trying to accomplish. Unfortunately, he was in the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation, so how could he simply replace the Heavenly Will with his own will and rebuild another realm? To do so would be to look down on the Ancient Top Killing Formation, even though it was incomplete!</p><p>Thus, the Bull Demon King was completely in passive defense whereby he could not do anything toward Nezha. The aftermath of the battle was balanced out by the overlapping sword power from the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation and it hence did not cause any damage to the Real World.</p><p>He used his Divine Sense to sense the surroundings. He was aware that Shaoxuan and Xi’e were itching to try. They were about to attack with their ubiquitous skills. He could still bear it, but what about his brothers?</p><p>The Roc Demon King and Dragon Demon King had just been reinstated to their Legendary Peak. They were already in a precarious situation under the suppression of the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation and Nezha’s attacks from all around. Coupled with the attacks from Shaoxuan and Xi’e who were not affected by the Sword Formation as they had the decrees with them, it was possible that they were going to die here today.</p><p>This can’t be it!</p><p>The Bull Demon King let out an oppressive snort. He could no longer care about his own situation. It was time to show his final skill.</p><p>This skill was extremely energy consuming to him right now. Thus, it could only be maintained for a short while. Originally, he intended to use it at the critical moment. However, he was in distress right at the beginning.</p><p>The Bull Demon King let out a furious roar when he encountered Nezha’s Fire-Tipped Spear, Red Armillary Sash, and other treasures.</p><p>The roar shook the surroundings. It even dissipated the sword power, causing Nezha’s attack to slow down for a moment.</p><p>It was at this moment when the Bull Demon King rushed toward the ground. A light brightened up and a white giant bull that stepped on the Nine Levels of Underground appeared with horns that pierced through the sky. Every inch of its flesh were releasing a vast expanse of colorful clouds. In fact, countless Magic Clouds and rays represented different figures respectively. There was a bull-looking god that was in charge of fairness and a terrifying demonic bull who crashed on Fairy Mountain. The most eye-catching one was the illusionary white sacred bull which was at the top with a three-eyed and four-handed illusionary God of Destruction sitting on its back. On top of that, the vertex of the God of Destruction looked like a God Master.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>There were different figures. Some spat out their bezoars, some lowered their heads and showed their long horns while some opened their third eye. Suddenly, it broke down and disintegrated the sword power nearby. Brilliant radiance spread, forcibly opening up a small universe. The stars moved and offset the subsequent sword power invasion, helping the Roc Demon King, the Dragon Demon King, and others to return to normal. Thus, they could be ubiquitous.</p><p>He stared with his bull’s eyes and saw that Nezha stopped just right outside the universe. He did not fall into it. As expected, the Bull Demon King rushed forward together with his vast universe!</p><p>Rush over to him and knock him down. The State of the West is just ahead!</p><p>At that time, to eliminate the Forces of Living Beings by means of taking over or slaughtering were up to him!</p><p>Nezha let out a derisive laugh. Immediately, the surroundings were covered in Green Lotus which bloomed and flew one after another into the precinct of the Bull Demon King, replacing the stars.</p><p>…</p><p>The shoulder of Maitreya had been ripped off. His Golden Body was obviously damaged. In fact, in between the smudges of azure stones, the recovery process was extremely slow. It showed that the bite from the Celestial Hound was extraordinary.</p><p>He maintained a kind smile and started to cast the moniker in a low voice again.</p><p>“Namo Amitābha.”</p><p>Hundreds of millions of beams of light shone from his head and a clean, ethereal White Lotus appeared in between. The white lotus petals unfolded, revealing a Golden Body Joss who sat in the middle. It had twenty heads and sixteen arms, wearing a necklace of pearls and jades with stars as a foundation. It was so bright and quiet. Holding the sword and cymbal lamps, it was the Future Star Gautama Buddha Golden Body that was the combination of both the roads of the Buddha Golden Body and the Bodhi Golden Body by Maitreya.</p><p>Previously it was the Sambhogakaya, now it was the Dharmakaya!</p><p>The Dharmakaya appeared and opened its mouth, releasing three Buddhist relics.</p><p>The Buddhist relics were crystal clear. It contained White Lotus and was surrounded with Buddha’s grace. One of it was ancient and had experienced the vicissitudes of life. It seemed difficult to change and was filled with traces of years. Another one was placed in the center, releasing limitless light to save the sentimental beings. The third one was flashing with the sparkles of stars, so illusionary and obscure. It had the subtle aura of Buddha as if everything was void and the zen of entering the Nirvana realm. They seemed to symbolize the past, present, and future, which was the crystallization that Maitreya explored in the Nirvana Realm.</p><p>He had outshined the Bull Demon King and Nezha with just this.</p><p>Three Buddhist relics appeared and immediately, the hurricane across myriad miles had been set still. The black and white four-colored sword power was also set still. The sky was cleared up and the pure land expanded. Jiangdong and everywhere towards the South were all Buddhist nations. There was no longer limitations. Thus, Fahualin and Damiaoxiang together with the other Bodhisattva Arhat could perform their true strength within the range. They could also move freely.</p><p>Compared to the Bull Demon King, Maitreya’s strategy was definitely a light work. He had no trace of worldliness.</p><p>Meanwhile, Nezha and the Bull Demon King had gotten into a fierce battle. Their own universe was blending together, offsetting each other. They were isolated by the sword formation and thus were not distracted by Jiangdong. The Celestial Hound could only fall back from the Buddhist nations and hide again, waiting for the next chance to attack.</p><p>Maitreya was seriously wounded after being bitten by it. He could only seek for an outbreak, striving to take over several states as soon as possible in order to weaken the beautiful picture of mountains and rivers and strengthen the Buddhist nations. Then, he would defend and wait for the recovery of his injury and the power of the Buddhism relics before he proceeded.</p><p>Meng Qi who was controlling the situation at the Heart of Formation saw it and knew that the battle had reached its critical moment. Without the maneuvering of Nezha, he had needed to reassign.</p><p>He sat there, seemingly sitting there steadily and calm. The truth was that he sat there to maintain the suppression of the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation. He was also bound by the cardinal point. Hence, it was hard to be ubiquitous and attacked directly.</p><p>It was not easy to control the Ancient Top Killing Formation.</p><p>Thus, Meng Qi could only attack from a distance with the help of the sword formation. In fact, the sword formation was incomplete. It relied mainly on the tyranny of the Four Fairy-Slaying Swords to complete the suppression. There were less changes and the attacks were weak.</p><p>As he was thinking, he made a voice transition to Shaoxuan and Xi’e.</p><p>“Seniors, please use your ubiquitous technique to stop the Luo Sect Oracles. On the demon race side, attack the Roc Demon King and Dragon Demon King fiercely once they come out from the Bull Demon King’s universe. However, do beware of the Spear of Mythical Creatures as it might have achieved Legendary and could use the Principle of Five Virtues to reduce the influence of the sword formation.”</p><p>“Alright,” Nezha had stolen the enemy from Shaoxuan and Xi’e. Hence, both of them had nothing to do. Hearing this, they immediately rushed to the State of the West and took care of both sides.</p><p>Under the entanglement of Jiang Zhiwei and Lu Wuming and also the attack of the Invincible Blade and the Great Wisdom Sword, the Luo Sect’s Three Oracles made slow progress. However, their slow movements were strange, as if they were planning something.</p><p>Meng Qi was quite reassured with Jiang Zhiwei and the others. In the future, he would be killed by the fixed light dominantly. Mostly because he did not take the risk to search for the legendary road and had never stepped into Spirited Mountain to receive the Ananda Kindness so that the Invincible Blade could achieve the Legendary level. The huge gap was indeed difficult to cross.</p><p>Once the Invincible Blade had awakened to the Legendary level, he had the confidence to save his life under the mighty people who had awakened in advance. At Spirited Mountain, his aura could directly collide with the aura of the Bull Demon King, the Roc Demon King, and others, unaffected a single bit.</p><p>Although they just got out of trouble and were relatively weak, the Bull Demon King, the Roc Demon King, and the Dragon Demon King were Great Mediums of the Creation Realm. Even when they were at their worst, they were no worse than the Celestial Ceremony Ambassador who had awakened in advance. For now, Zhiwei could not be compared to the previous him. However, the Big Three Oracles were also suppressed by the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation. Since she has the Invincible Blade, she would not need to be afraid of the overwhelming great force. Her attacks could also threaten the opponent.</p><p>Most importantly, since Jiang Zhiwei could be ubiquitous while the Big Three Oracles could not, they would not be able to beat her. The powerful force would be of no use if it misses its target. Even if they wanted to attack in a wide scope, the range was limited. Besides, Jiang Zhiwei could return to Changle at anytime!</p><p>She could be everywhere, hiding at the end of the earth. However, were the Celestial Ceremony Ambassadors brave enough to ignore the attack from the Invincible Blade?</p><p>Face-to-face confrontation could not be done, but guerrilla attacks and harassment were definitely not a problem!</p><p>Besides, Jiang Zhiwei had lots of projections and was fighting at her home field unlike the Celestial Ceremony Ambassador who was afraid of being careless and thus ended up encountering serial attacks. The projections appeared and vanished. Even if she overlooked and got attacked by the mighty people, she could rebirth and came back again without any life-threatening danger. This was the main reason why Meng Qi let her come along.</p><p>Even if the gap was huge, as long as the conditions were beneficial, it could fill a lot.</p><p>There’s nothing absolute in this world?</p><p>The only absolute thing is that nothing is absolute!</p><p>With the help of Shaoxuan and Xi’e, Meng Qi was reassured with the situation in the State of the West. On Maitreya’s side, the Celestial Hound could not do much as it was alone.</p><p>Meng Qi took a breath. Once again a shadow stepped out of the Premier Auspicious Cloud on the crown of his head. Looking majestic, it was the Incarnation of Eight-Nine.</p><p>He took a step out of the Heaven Conferring Platform and appeared outside of the Buddhist nations. He stepped into the void and looked down at Maitreya.</p><p>This was the ace that Meng Qi used to confront him!</p><p>As for the incarnation of the sword skill, Meng Qi did not take any rash actions. In the situation where he put all his concentration in controlling the sword formation, he needed to save room to maneuver in order to avoid any accidents, such as the Demonic Ancestor of Water.</p><p>It was almost time to determine the winner. He just needed to hold on till Brother Doubi comes back with helpers!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
