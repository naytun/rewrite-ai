There was no issue with this at all, and it wouldn’t make people think too much about it. But comparing with the remains of the Earth God being the Seal of Samsara, the Celestial Ruler’s body being turned into the Time Blade, and the Demonic Sage himself being refined into the phoenix-winged spear, the issue was obvious.</p><p>Where were the remains of the emperor? The remains of an influential Nirvana character!</p><p>The Emperor’s Sword was a celestial sword that grew step by step with the emperor, and had nothing to do with the remains. The foundation of the emperor’s descendants was the Last Ship, which did not involve the Nirvana real body.</p><p>And how could such an important matter not be accounted for? Why did the Divine Emperor Kai not leave behind any doubts? Why have the emperor’s descendants not mentioned about this matter having guarded it till today?</p><p>The remains of the emperor seemed to be at the blind spot of all attention, and were strangely forgotten!</p><p>It was only until now when Gao Lan mentioned it, that Han Guang seemed to have an invisible fog unveiled from his memory and thinking, and acknowledge this issue.</p><p>It seems that a pair of invisible hands had deliberately covered up this matter, and it wasn’t just a simple eradication of the incident, but with a bit of tampering so that the deities and Buddhas would all overlook this important point. And this invisible hand should be the person behind Gao Lan… Han Guang’s mind was full of thoughts, combining some of the hidden secrets that he knew and speculating on this matter. The expression on his face didn’t change a bit, and was still smiling in a leisurely manner as he said, “Seems like I’ll be able to see for myself the remains of an influential Nirvana character today.”</p><p>This is not something that happens everyday!</p><p>Influential Nirvana characters were the real controllers of the various heavens and realms, and there had always been only a few of them. Even from the beginning of the Yuanshi opening up the heaven, and after the accumulation era after era, the current Nirvana characters could be easily counted. Their passing really happened only two or three times in one era, and such an incident never happened even in many eras.</p><p>The current era was considered as the Final Trial, hence the Earth God, the Demonic Lord, the Celestial Ruler, the Demonic Sage, and the emperor passed on in succession.</p><p>The Archean Era was too far away, and the remains of the Earth God, the Celestial Ruler, and the Demonic Sage had already become heavenly weapons while the Demon Lord’s body was not complete and difficult to find. Hence, it was only today that he could see the remains of an influential Nirvana character!</p><p>Gao Lan retrieved his deep and sharp eye gaze and looked at Yuan Hong, the Bull Demon King and the other powerful characters who were forcing their way out of the sword formation but who were also in great danger. His right hand slowly drew out the Emperor’s Sword.</p><p>Its body was pale golden, with the sun, the moon and the stars engraved on the front and deities, demons and Buddhas on the back. On the hilt were farms and fisheries, writing prototypes, and the kaleidoscope of human race.</p><p>The faint glow erupted as the Emperor’s Sword became transparent, showing the brilliance of its own humanity.</p><p>Shining brilliantly like a wave, it slowly held out a strong and tall body.</p><p>It wasn’t tens of thousands of feet tall nor was it a celestial body that touched the sky, but strong and tall like a normal human.</p><p>The body was wearing a black robe, the hair was tied up casually, and there was no imperial decoration. But just him sitting there quietly already had a subduing disposition of a ruler. His eyes opened, showing double pupils. He looked like he was awake, but it was a dead silence inside.</p><p>The remains of the emperor have been hidden inside the Emperor’s Sword all along? Just as this thought came to Han Guang’s mind, he heard a cracking noise coming from the real world, like there was another realm forcing itself into this place, making it difficult for it to accommodate and shook continuously.</p><p>The Nine Levels of Heaven came into view, and the levels of ghost territories and demonic realms appeared. The projections of the Celestial World and the Netherworld appeared at the same time, as if they were resisting the remains of a Nirvana character entering the real world.</p><p>In front of Han Guang, the body of the emperor that he saw suddenly went missing. He only saw the sea of suffering with undulating waves, with the universes of the various realms floating in it. And at the core of the sea of sufferings was the real world created by humanity. It drifted upward, wanting to take the various realms, the human race, and the living beings of wisdom away from the sea of sufferings.</p><p>At this place, there was no Netherworld, nor was there the high and mighty Nine Levels of Heaven. They seemed to have integrated into the paradise of humanity, and were no longer separated from each other.</p><p>This was the way of the emperor, this was his heaven and earth!</p><p>The light was shining, and the end of the sea of sufferings were happenings of the past, the emperor casting the sword, hacking through difficulties, the fire of the stars, fighting the bloody battle, going through the sufferings, and finally ending of the chaos by the demons. And at the depths of the sea of sufferings, the water rippled, producing one bubble after another, each containing a future in it.</p><p>As for the real world created by humanity, it wasn’t just deadly stillness, but also filled with traces of destruction. The past was like an illusory shadow, with only an imprint being left behind, and no longer felt real. The bubbles of the future were shattered the moment they emerged, unable to show all kinds of uncertainties.</p><p>Han Guang almost got lost here, and finally managed to control his real spirit. He closed his eyes, and his mind already had some sort of understanding, “The emperor died an unnatural death…”</p><p>Gao Lan didn’t say anything about it. Facing the remains of the emperor, he took a deep bow before placing the Emperor’s Sword into the hands of the remains, using his own control and the spirituality of the sword to move the body.</p><p>A pale golden color flashed across, and the emperor’s remains stepped into the Celestial Slaying Sword Formation.</p><p>…</p><p>The Demonic Monarch was a powerful character who was still around since Archean times, and his demonic martial arts were also known for their strangeness and unpredictability. His demonic body squirmed continuously, scattering and gathering a black fog at times and a dot at others, escaping the billions of fallen sword auras of the Celestial Slaying Sword Formation.</p><p>With a press of his right hand, the front collapsed and the sword aura caved in. The Demonic Monarch jumped over and was about to rush to the sky and convey out of the sword formation.</p><p>At this moment, his vision went blurry. He saw a familiar figure - his face was pale golden, his eyes had double pupils, and his majesty was unyielding.</p><p>The emperor! The Demonic Monarch was stunned, like he was hit by the counterforce of the multiverse, and was almost shrouded by the four colored sword beams hit down by Meng Qi.</p><p>When the demons created chaos in the world, the Demonic Monarch was a rare talent who transformed the skills of the bloodline of demons and deities into skills that everyone could cultivate. He had been the gods’ favored one since primitive diabolism, and would definitely reach the peak. Unfortunately, he met the Demon Sage, and then the emperor, and was defeated several times. If not for the completely awakened Devil’s Claws, he would have long been the blood on the Emperor’s Sword.</p><p>After knowing that the emperor had passed on, he felt extremely relieved.</p><p>But at this very moment, the emperor actually appeared in front of him!</p><p>As the thought rushed up in his mind and he examined immediately, the Demonic Monarch did not let the nearly and almost appear. He jumped into the sky in a flash, and at the same time understood clearly that these were the remains of the emperor!</p><p>That’s right, the remains of the emperor!</p><p>Suppressing his shock and doubt, the Demonic Monarch continued to dodge the killing of the sword formation, but the figure of the emperor existed in his eyes throughout, unable to be rid of it.</p><p>Then, he saw the emperor stretch out his left hand, covering the sword beam, and the inside of his double pupils reflected his figure.</p><p>The whole process of the Demonic Monarch dodging the attack of the sword aura in the beginning and him stepping into the sky now was being played quickly and continuously like a recorded image!</p><p>Bad!</p><p>The Demonic Monarch had exchanged blows with the emperor numerous times and was no stranger to the emperor’s power and means. Seeing this momentum, he already felt fatal danger was coming.</p><p>The emperor stretched out his left hand and inserted the play process. During the dodge a few moments ago, the hand blocked just right in front of the Demonic Monarch.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The Demonic Monarch’s past figure hit the left hand and knocked it away, but also caused a fleeting stagnation to itself.</p><p>It was during this stagnation that the four sword auras hit down by Meng Qi shrouded the Demonic Monarch, resulting in the killing and ending his arrival.</p><p>The Demonic Monarch who felt the deadly danger froze in the air, and his demonic body broke down bit by bit. A few moments ago, he was already dead.</p><p>His Demon Body of Six Annihilations, which wasn’t easy to cultivate, instantly fell apart. The four colored sword auras flowed with the link and struck at the Palace of Frost, the deep demonic cave, and the various universes.</p><p>Five ancient bronze coffins opened, contracting and expanding the heart continuously. The bloody body that was killed and the skull with white hair and a black beard appeared, displaying magical power to block the approaching sword auras, and then broke the link!</p><p>The Demonic Monarch was forced to awaken all his bodies, and the damage was huge!</p><p>Meng Qi who was controlling the sword formation retrieved his eye gaze and looked at the figure of the emperor. Thoughts ran through his mind a thousand times.</p><p>The image of the emperor has been passed down from generation to generation, and hasn’t changed much. Moreover, he was holding the Emperor’s Sword. How can he not recognize?</p><p>These are the remains of an influential Nirvana character?</p><p>…</p><p>The Smile of Flower-Picking, The Best in the World, Divine Intervention - the shadows of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas around the Supreme Buddha displayed different strikes of the Buddha’s Palm, merging them into one.</p><p>He spread out his hands, embraced heaven and earth, and made a century-creating blow.</p><p>Endless light burst, running through time and space, creating living beings, establishing a new era and neutralizing hundreds of billions of sword auras as it dashed into the sky and attacked the sword formation.</p><p>At this moment, he saw a figure with double pupiled eyes and also saw the previous process reenacting!</p><p>The Emperor’s Sword had struck just a few moments ago, exactly blocking the Buddha’s Palm displayed simultaneously by the shadows of the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas around the Supreme Buddha.</p><p>The Buddha’s Palm was not complete and the century-creating blow suddenly lost its ability to open the current closed time and space, and couldn’t neutralize the sword auras.</p><p>Red, green, black, and white fell, time and space were chaotic, substances existed no more, and energies surged, pulling the Supreme Buddha into the uncontainable chaos!</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The deep roar of the Supreme Buddha was swallowed up by the sword auras.</p><p>…</p><p>The Bull Demon King showed his celestial body that touched the sky and held the Demon Divine Spear in both hands, wanting to temporarily resist the sword auras and get out of the formation. But how would Nezha let him do as he wished? Shadows of spear came from all directions, all out to stop him.</p><p>The remains of the emperor also arrived here at this moment, locking his double pupils on the Bull Demon King.</p><p>The demonic race was in jeopardy.</p><p>At this moment, the Celestial Slaying Sword Formation suddenly shook, and a gold cudgel that supported the real world forced its way into it!</p><p>The Great Sage Equaling Heaven has struck!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
