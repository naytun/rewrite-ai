But no matter how he let his thoughts run wild, he had never got close to this.</p><p>Things actually developed this way, meeting the Tyrant out of the blue!</p><p>He had once thought that he would never meet this strongest celestial being of the Middle Ages again unless he achieved Nirvana and backtrack to the past, to think he actually met him again here!</p><p>Vertical Wing’s description of the Demon King Palace spontaneously flashed across his mind: the most important thing to the Demon King. It houses time, void and spirit, connecting the past and the present seemed to be one of its capabilities.</p><p>With this thought, Meng Qi suddenly felt that things had been prearranged. It seemed destined that he would meet the Tyrant who had yet to attain the Legendary realm here.</p><p>The Tyrant was the God of Thunder’s fish. He got rid of Ananda’s control, swallowed the God of Thunder’s additional self and self-attained the Legendary realm. Although he was now still a step away from Legendary, he must have already communicated with many God of Thunder’s additional self and they could be close the division of quantitative and qualitative changes. Although the Ananda additional self and the God of Thunder’s additional self had completely different characteristics and couldn’t be recognized straight away, they definitely have similarities in their origins. With the God of Thunder’s additional self as reference, he should at least be able to yield twice the result with half the effort even if he couldn’t improve by leaps and bounds like the Ananda additional self?</p><p>When he was desperately trying to get information on Ananda additional self, he met with the Tyrant who traveled through time. If this wasn’t destined, then what was it?</p><p>The Demon King still has good intentions at least from what I see now… thoughts ran fast in his mind and Meng Qi had already come to a decision. Showing no signs of weakness, he and the Tyrant looked at each other in the eye. One showed purple thunder, tyranny, and arrogance, while the other pair of eyes were deep and chaotic, containing all things. As their internal energies knocked against each other, purple thunder fell and struck the front of the Demon King Palace until it became dark, and the terrified Vertical Wing hid behind Meng Qi.</p><p>Since we meet, let’s battle to our hearts’ content!</p><p>He had once lamented that he was indeed inferior to the Tyrant when he was still an earth deity. But after becoming a celestial being, how would the situation be like exchanging blows with him? Who would win and who would lose? He felt that it was a pity that he couldn’t meet with an ancient character, and today he got to fulfill his wish!</p><p>Fight on! Comprehend the God of Thunder’s additional self of the Tyrant’s during the battle!</p><p>With their current relationship, it wasn’t possible for them to discuss this calmly. Moreover, he also didn’t want to reveal too many things and let the Tyrant discover anything that would change history and destroy himself!</p><p>Whizz, thunder and lightning struck and fell like rain. The Tyrant’s defined face showed a faint smile, “It’s you, no wonder I was prompted by a sudden impulse to check out the sea’s eye.”</p><p>“To think I can fulfill this wish before achieving the Legendary realm.”</p><p>The previous time when he got conned by Xiaomeng was one of the rare occasions where he got ripped off, and it had been on his mind all the while. Now that he saw him, he wasn’t shocked but happy instead.</p><p>At this point, he nodded slightly and stretched his brows. His fighting spirit suddenly escalated and he said jubilantly, “And you’ve leveled up to a celestial being, not bad, not bad at all!”</p><p>This way, he would be satisfied winning the other party!</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and stretched out his right hand,</p><p>“A chance encounter is better than an arranged meeting. Tyrant, please!”</p><p>He initiated a battle without flinching.</p><p>“Sure, wonderful!” the Tyrant nodded and laughed.</p><p>This type of opponent was just to his liking. With these words, all past vengeances were erased!</p><p>He placed his right hand on the handle of the blade, pressing the remaining flowers and plants with his imposing manner. Vertical Wing clenched his teeth in fear and could only stammer, “Who, who are you, how, how did you come, come out from the Demon King Palace, let, let me tell you…”</p><p>Meng Qi’s momentum was vast and boundless like the starry sky, unaffected by the Tyrant’s imposing manner. He said with a smile, “How about continuing after inside the Demon King Palace? Thousands of living things might be harmed if we battle outside.”</p><p>Both of them were outstanding characters among the celestial beings, or even one of the top few. If they crossed hands and reached the climax, the galaxy could be destroyed if it took place in the starry sky. If it took place in the real world, the mysterious space in the sea’s eye could be destroyed and the dragon heritage at the bottom of the sea could be broken, causing a tsunami that would bring disaster to the nearby areas. As the Demon King Palace was a supreme treasure of extremely high quality, their attacks might not even be able to touch it, hence it was most suitable as a battlefield.</p><p>Since Meng Qi was challenging him with his head up, how would the arrogant Tyrant mind this request. He said indifferently, “Sure. Actually at our current level, we could fight in the vast sky or even compete inside a small mustard seed. The battlefield is not important.”</p><p>The smallest may hold the largest. Even a fine dust could be used as a place for them to cross hands. This was the behavior of a celestial being.</p><p>After saying this, the Tyrant calmly turned and walked into the Demon King Palace with the blade handle in his right hand, not worried that the other party might sneak an attack.</p><p>Using this chance, Meng Qi stepped forward, concentrating his momentum and flew to the top, stepping into the Demon King Palace following behind.</p><p>The Demon King Palace had countless doors. After ancient times, only the main door was sealed, storing treasures and waiting for destined people. Others could be entered with the Demon King’s token in order to get the inheritance and cultivate the demon body. Now that the main door had been opened, the other doors were naturally no exception. After going through it, facing them was an empty hall whose sides couldn’t be seen, as though it had been opened up especially for their battle.</p><p>Vertical Wing stood trembling outside, mumbling and looking a the main door the Tyrant was directly facing while Meng Qi was back-facing him. The few hundred feet between them were filled with dark clouds and purple thunder, looking magnificent.</p><p>With a creak, the main door closed without any wind, and he couldn’t see the duel between the two strongest celestial beings in history anymore.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Tyrant slowly drew out the Invincible Blade and posed a starting stance. The black body of the blade was concentrated with purple thunder, looking translucent, splendid and overbearing.</p><p>He looked at Meng Qi and spoke in a low voice, feeling a little puzzled, “Where’s your sword?”</p><p>“I forgot to bring it,” Meng Qi silently cursed the Invincible Blade before smiling and stretching out both hands calmly. His hands were as white as jade, covered with a layer of deep fluorescent light. Long and strong, they looked as though they could create a world and also destroy the three realms.</p><p>This was a pair of ancient immortal palms!</p><p>No longer puzzled, the Tyrant said in a deep voice, “I’m going to strike!”</p><p>His intention was to get Meng Qi to strike first, but the priest in front of him didn’t do so.</p><p>As such, he shook his blade and silhouettes of the Tyrant appeared behind him one by one before attacking with the blade simultaneously, forming a majestic purple light dividing the sky.</p><p>Once the blade struck, celestial beings should stay clear!</p><p>The entire hall seemed to be shrunk by the blade, almost turning into a cage. The Principle of Karma in Meng Qi’s eyes observed the silhouettes behind the Tyrant as the acupoints on his body opened up, adding layers upon layers of strength on his body. His hands crossed like a flying bird, slowly pressing toward the sky-diving purple light from both sides.</p><p>The pair of white hands changed continuously, transforming into a Great Roc, blocking in front of the purple light no matter how it flickered.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The purple light struck at where Meng Qi’s hands crossed. Palm golden light flowed around his strong and long palms that looked like a heavenly weapon. Golden lotuses rose one by one from the intersection of the palms and the blade, continuously growing again after being crushed while blocking the blade.</p><p>The erupting light and air attacked the surroundings, breaking the cage and causing darkness to rise. Caves appeared and got destroyed continuously and part of the main hall was expanded into a vast universe!</p><p>At this moment, the Tyrant saw Meng Qi suddenly expand and transform into a towering celestial being, stuffing the main hall. The top of his head was covered by auspicious clouds while rays of dim light formed a water curtain. The majestic air made the main hall look like a back-flowing galaxy, making him tremble from within and pause for a moment.</p><p>Meng Qi knew that the Tyrant was arrogant and thought very highly of himself, so his strike was definitely just for testing and not a display of his full strength. Therefore, he decided to act in the opposite direction, using the Celestial Body right away since he was without the Invincible Blade and put in his best efforts to take control!</p><p>His eyes were indifferent as he took in the Tyrant’s silhouettes. His right hand sprung up with the momentum as his five fingers opened up, hitting downward fiercely in a world-enveloping manner.</p><p>“Take this!”</p><p>Along with the faintly discernible voice, the Flip Heaven Seal appeared!</p><p>The palm was like a huge seal that was extremely heavy, making the void space of the main hall curl into a transparent ball, enveloping the Tyrant. Before the palm was darkness where void spaces were continuously destroyed and even time seemed to be slowed down, looking as though the world was turning upside down.</p><p>The Tyrant was elated instead of shocked, his fighting spirit escalated. The purple thunder blade in his hand struck silently, forming a line that opened up a gap in the shattered void with delayed time. The cage was struck opened, and a peaceful world was displayed beside him.</p><p>The world exists no more, only I exist.</p><p>At this moment, the towering celestial being in front of him disappeared. With a Cloud Crown on his head, Meng Qi appeared in a flash behind him. The acupoints all over his body were bursting with strength, gathering on his right hand with a twist of his back.</p><p>Clenching his right hand into a fist that also looked like an ancient seal, Meng Qi hammered downward from a height!</p><p>With this fist, heaven and earth cracked, and the world around the Tyrant was broken. Dust rose in the surroundings and covered the light, making it like doomsday.</p><p>The Tyrant finally showed a trace of grimness in his eyes. His hair suddenly loosened up, a black armor appeared on the surface of his body and his body suddenly expanded – he had to show his true form.</p><p>Overbearing power substantiated and filled the main hall, weakening Meng Qi and strengthening the Tyrant, as though replacing all rules and principles in this place!</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>The Tyrant roared. The handle of the blade flew out in a swift movement, gathering the silhouettes and absorbing the overbearing power before hitting toward Meng Qi’s fist.</p><p>Before the handle came, the overbearing power caused the fist to slow down a little and it didn’t avoid it in time.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The handle was hit by the fist and shortened by an inch. Meng Qi’s feet were off the ground and almost flew off. Destructive air filled the hall, causing the doors and pillars to shake.</p><p>Evenly matched, the Tyrant also flew off, but stopped strangely halfway, like a knife in a sheath.</p><p>Right after this, with the recoil of the force, he advanced instead of retreating. Like a fierce knife coming out of its sheath, he attacked Meng Qi in such an aggressive manner that he couldn’t escape.</p><p>Meng Qi did not panic but stretch out his right hand with his four fingers together and separated from the thumb, as though forming a mouth.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The hand seemed to transform into a candle dragon, blowing out sharp air from the mouth and slowing down the Tyrant’s blade.</p><p>With this delay, Meng Qi moved the five fingers of his left hand, messing up the four divisions before turning his hand over in a flowy manner, looking truly like a celestial character.</p><p>Splendid! Seeing this, the Tyrant couldn’t help but say this in mind.</p><p>After falling into a passive position since the battle started, he never got to take control despite using all his skills. This was a situation he had never seen after gaining success in his blademanship!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
