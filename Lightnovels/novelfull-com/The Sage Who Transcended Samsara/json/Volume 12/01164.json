Flowing and surging along with the palm, it outlined a figure high up in the sky and helped him put on a black robe as well as the crown of a Heavenly Lord. In the darkness, Yuanshi arrived.</p><p>“Su Meng!”</p><p>“Primitive Emperor!”</p><p>Shaoxuan and Qixin were each struck by a thought, and they had already recognized this figure - Kunlun Mountain Jade Mirage Palace, Primitive Emperor Su Meng!</p><p>He actually self-attained the Legendary Realm not long after lending the Invincible Blade to them?</p><p>The Heavenly Lord lifted the blade, and his body suddenly expanded. His black robe separated into pieces, turning into an armor that covered his body, looking powerful and mighty.</p><p>“Lamp Ambassador!”</p><p>Meng Qi let out a roar. Purple lightning and the blade beam formed a line, splitting up the darkness around. Clear air rose, turbid gas fell, and the four elements stagnated. The world opened up, showing the slightly pale face of the Celestial Lamp Ambassador.</p><p>“Lamp Ambassador!”</p><p>Raising the blade again, Meng Qi who was in black armor roared once more. Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple thunder appeared and merged into one, turning into a strong blade ray and striking directly at the Celestial Lamp Ambassador with great momentum and without any reservation.</p><p>The Celestial Lamp Ambassador looked solemn as deep swirl-like universes appeared around his body. Inside every swirl was a figure, each displaying a mudra sign and turning into a galaxy, gathering together to form a dazzling round mirror in the palm before moving toward the powerful blade beam.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Faster than light, the sound sent the ancient Fusang tree shaking.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The blade beam hit the round mirror on the palm of the Celestial Lamp Ambassador, emitting colorful dancing lights.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>The round mirror showed deep cracks and immediately broke into pieces. The Celestial Lamp Ambassador’s body was sent flying before hitting the tree trunk. His breathing was like a flickering candle in the wind that might be extinguished any time.</p><p>Knowing that things weren’t going well, the Celestial Lamp Ambassador activated his life-saving prowess, moving even inside the boundary of the ancient Fusang tree and appeared on its side, dodging the approaching blade beam. Then, he saw the black-armored Meng Qi go straight to the top of the ancient tree with one step like a surging torrent without even taking a glance at himself nor even sensing him once!</p><p>In Meng Qi’s eyes, he was like an ant that wasn’t worthy of his attention at all, turning a blind eye to him after hacking his way through!</p><p>“If I hadn’t resisted Shaoxuan and Xi’e earlier on to the point of exhausting my strength, even blowing out the Wanderer Lamp, in addition to awakening in advance such that my strength is no longer at its peak, why would I end up like this!” the Celestial Lamp Ambassador thought with annoyance.</p><p>However, his rationality told him that he would surely die if he chased Meng Qi and obstructed him.</p><p>At the top of the ancient Fusang tree, Sha Wujing almost exhausted his mind and strength before finally putting the dark and eccentric fruit into the custom-made green jade box, added a few layers of seal, and engraved several Taoist markings.</p><p>He turned his head and cast his gaze at the Tomb of my husband, Meng Qi, and the piled up white flowers. With his left hand raised, he could completely turn them into ashes with just a swing of his arm.</p><p>Just then, there was a sudden roar in his ear:</p><p>“Sha!”</p><p>“Wu!”</p><p>“Jing!”</p><p>The three roars were sent from far and near, but merged into one because of the extremely fast speed. When they shook the clouds, echoing in Sha Wujing’s mind and making him tremble, the figure in mighty black armor had already landed through space, with the aid of the words, ‘Tomb of my husband, Meng Qi.’</p><p>“Sha Wujing!”</p><p>As his roars echoed, Meng Qi moved his right hand downward. Purple lightning burst and turned into a huge shiny hand covering the clouds. As his five fingers opened, heaven and earth turned upside down!</p><p>Sha Wujing’s face changed color. Swinging the scepter around his body, countless figures appeared around him, each displaying their power and creating an enchanted boundary.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As the purple lightning palm pressed down, heaven and earth tilted, and the enchanted boundary was straightaway broken. Sha Wujing was hit and got stuck in the trunk of the ancient tree. His scepter fell and the jade box rolled out.</p><p>The Primitive Emperor’s power has actually reached this level!</p><p>Meng Qi raised his left hand, took and kept the jade box. He took a glance at Sha Wujing and said with indifference, “I’ll spare your life this time.”</p><p>He was fairly kind to him the previous time.</p><p>After that, he stopped looking at Sha Wujing. In his dark armor, he turned to look at the Tomb of my husband, Meng Qi.</p><p>Sha Wujing was stunned, and struggled to get out. Looking a little dejected, he picked up the scepter, dragging it as he moved down along the tree trunk and muttered, “I still can’t handle this alone after all?”</p><p>There’s a grave covered with white flowers in Green Hill to pay respect to every year… Meng Qi closed his eyes and recalled the jokeful agreement of himself and Xiaosang in Bayan Valley.</p><p>It was a pity that the Tomb of my husband, Meng Qi failed to bury him, her preparation did not come in handy.</p><p>The grave was around, but he was also around.</p><p>As for why Gu Xiaosang knew his original name, he could only guess for now that she had had a certain level of cooperation with the Devil Buddha back then, or that she knew about the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi who was separated from the Golden Emperor.</p><p>Gently taking in a breath, Meng Qi was full of anticipation. He stretched out his right hand and with a gentle swing opened the tomb, revealing the dark pool inside where there was a chaotic green lotus seed.</p><p>Just as a smile appeared on Meng Qi’s face, the green lotus seed suddenly decayed, as if it never had a life, turning into dust along with the wind.</p><p>“A smokescreen again…” although Meng Qi clearly understood that it was useless to feel disappointed, he still couldn’t help but feel disappointed and depressed.</p><p>This could have been Xiaosang’s backup plan, but was still abandoned by her eventually.</p><p>Quietly standing in front of his own grave, Meng Qi once again felt the loneliness that he had previously experienced.</p><p>I have attained the Legendary realm, but you have yet to return.</p><p>The grave is covered with flowers, but where is she.</p><p>…</p><p>After putting away the jade box and thanking Shaoxuan and Xi’e, Meng Qi left the boundary of the ancient Fusang tree, returning to Kunlun Mountain Jade Mirage Palace with one step. Daqinggen was already in front of the door, waiting for his return.</p><p>“Master, congratulations on self-attaining the Legendary realm, the only one in the world!” Daqinggen shouted loudly, full of awe and flattery.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded and said, “You may take your leave.”</p><p>He walked around the wall, crossed the courtyard, and returned to the main hall where he saw the statue of the Heavenly Lord standing quietly and seemed to remain the same for eternity.</p><p>Letting out a gentle sigh, Meng Qi walked out of the side door and arrived at the lotus pond that was dark and chaotic deep within. The surrounding flowers were already blooming and emitting fragrance, but the two green lotus seeds remained unchanged.</p><p>There are ups and downs in life, but this scene could be seen year after year, and the lotuses would still bloom in summer.</p><p>Casually sitting down, Meng Qi seemed to have fallen into silence, that he had even forgotten for the time being to examine the things that the Golden Emperor wanted in the jade box.</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly felt that his legendary body appeared to be throbbing. Some kind of link hidden in the depths of time suddenly emerged, affecting the chaotic green lotus seed he used in his resurrection.</p><p>“This is…” after Meng Qi leveled up to the Legendary realm, he already encountered such a thing before he could examine himself to eliminate the hidden dangers. But a thought struck him and he decided not to stop it but just wait calmly for changes.</p><p>The green lotus seed started growing at a crazy speed, budding in a very short amount of time, nurturing natural virtue.</p><p>The lotus petals bloomed slowly, looking fresh and with a hint of spiritual light inside, capturing the natural virtue and the surrounding darkness and chaos, outlining a shadow in a white dress. With a mystical and elegant disposition and exquisite facial features, the corner of her mouth seemed to be smiling. It was so familiar but also strange.</p><p>“Xiaosang…” Meng Qi muttered, feeling what he saw before him was like a dream or an illusion, and didn’t seem real.</p><p>It’s really Flowers Serve The Truth?</p><p>Xiaosang is resurrected so simply and easily?</p><p>A thought flashed across his mind and memories reappeared. After examining them one by one, he came to a realization and showed a confident smile.</p><p>It’s really Flowers Serve The Truth.</p><p>Among the lotus flowers, there was a figure in a white dress slightly tilting her head and smiling, “Hubby, you are not surprised at all?”</p><p>Although time had passed, her tone hadn’t changed, like memories come true.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled slightly, “At the Legendary level, I’m able to examine the past with different modes of thinking without the interference of emotional experience. When I saw the green lotus blooming, I already understood the whole story. The Present Life Fruit that you and I consumed one each was your real backup plan and what you relied on to resurrect. It definitely did not just have the effect of awakening each other when we meet.”</p><p>“You left the lotus seed in Bayan Valley and also took a look at the chaotic green lotus in the Jade Mirage Palace, which was a signal for me to get a green lotus seed. Because when I return with the aid of the Present Life Fruit, I would need a chaotic green lotus seed to recreate my body, and I could also obtain the natural virtue and get close to Legendary realm.”</p><p>“As for why the power the Present Life Fruit was able to be hidden from the Golden Emperor, I guess it is a secret and not many Nirvana characters knew about it. You received advice from one of them and got to know about it, hence used it in your planning.”</p><p>The figure in the white dress was Gu Xiaosang, she had really come back to life, and was smiling, “You’re observant, hubby. After consuming the Present Life Fruit, you and I are really destined to be together for three lives. After the double cultivation, you and I will exist together. With this, a little spiritual aura could be nurtured in your real spirit and you wouldn’t be able to detect it at all. Once you self-attained the Legendary realm and affected the internal functional activities, the spiritual aura would be moistened by the heavens when you break through and start to recover after experiencing a high level state. Then, with the help of the chaotic green lotus seed, it would be able to recreate a body of natural virtue.”</p><p>“To escape from the hands of a Nirvana character like the Golden Emperor, an exquisite interlocking plan definitely wouldn’t work. Once there was anything wrong, it would be found out immediately, and there were only three key points in my plan: you who had the attention of many influential characters and whom the Golden Emperor couldn’t search directly; each consume the Present Life Fruit and double cultivate; hint to you to get the the chaotic green lotus seed.”</p><p>“As long as these three steps were completed, it would be just a smokescreen and patient waiting. The simpler the more effective.”</p><p>Meng Qi quietly listened to Gu Xiaosang’s narration. His face was full of smiles and didn’t show any anger of being used during the double cultivation. It seemed that he had already learned about this matter, and didn’t mind because he was already well-prepared.</p><p>After Gu Xiaosang finished narrating, she still had a faint smile on her face as she moved her forehead slightly and said, “Hubby, you’re not angry?”</p><p>She deliberately asked this question, seemingly wanting to see a change in emotions in the usually composed Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi said in a relaxed manner, “It is only admirable putting in thoughts and efforts in order to live. Moreover, you have not done me any harm. I always have something to gain and also the fate to be husband and wife with you.”</p><p>After reviewing the thoughts and past experiences as well as eliminating embellishments and emotions, many things showed their original appearance.</p><p>This was how the Legendary realm leveled up the state of mind.</p><p>“And I am afraid you had no choice but to consume the Present Life Fruit and double cultivate with me,” Meng Qi said with a smile.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s eyelashes moved slightly, and she said with a smile, “How did you know about it, hubby?”</p><p>“After entering the Nine Levels of Heaven, you have long anticipated the arrival of Han Guang, and even guessed that he would invite Taili as a helper, and you planned to use this to get rid of the Wizard King of this World. Why get rid of the Wizard King of this World? Because he was a watcher, you didn’t want him to see that you had gotten two Present Life Fruits, as consuming two of them at the same time could get rid of the link straightaway.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled with confidence, “It takes a long time for Present Life Fruit to show its effectiveness. If the Wizard King of this World knew about the matter and asked the Ajati Matriarch for advice, you would be in trouble.”</p><p>“Initially everything was very smooth, but the helper invited by Han Guang was Gao Lan, the one with the Emperor’s Sword, so things were no longer under your control, and you couldn’t get rid of the Wizard King of this World. Because of this, after getting the two Present Life Fruits, you started to think about an alternative plan: consuming one each with me so that we could wake each other, and this was obviously within the tolerable limits of the Golden Emperor.”</p><p>“You are really good at understanding the minds of others, hubby,” Gu Xiaosang said smilingly, indirectly admitting it.</p><p>Meng Qi did not mind at all and was still in a relaxed mood, “I just want to know, when you refused the cooperation request of the Devil Buddha, how much of it was because you were confident of succeeding and didn’t need his help, how much of it was because you didn’t want to ask an evil character for a favor, and how much of it was because we were in the same boat?”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang pressed her lips together and smiled, “Make a guess?”</p><p>Meng Qi was about to speak when Gu Xiaosang shifted her gaze and stared at his face, “There is one thing that I need to let you know.”</p><p>“What is it?” Meng Qi confidently asked.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang forced an awkward smile, “The essence of my spirit was being nourished inside your real spirit and bred from you, I’m afraid I have to call you…”</p><p>Having said that, she lowered her forehead and shifted her eyes, her cheeks red with shyness as she shouted, “Father!”</p><p>Father! Meng Qi’s jaw dropped, losing the composure of a Legendary supreme.</p><p>At this moment, the stars high up in the sky moved as many mighty characters began to return. Rays of bright light fell, shining on Gu Xiaosang and making her look dreamy and illusory.</p><p>The eastern wind seemed to have blown away the thousand trees in full bloom, like blowing the stars in the sky into a meteor.</p><p>I have been looking for her in the crowd for thousands of times. When I turned back, I found that she was just there by the dim lights!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
