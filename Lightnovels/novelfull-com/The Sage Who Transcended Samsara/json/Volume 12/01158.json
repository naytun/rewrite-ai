He obtained two pieces of news having entered the Jade Palace and looked at the Green Lotus Seed of Chaos. First, she made preparations so it was not easy to be completely fallen. Second, since her preparation was related to the Green Lotus Seed of Chaos, its specific whereabouts were yet to be discovered. Later on, he tried to think of every possible approach, but in the end, he still could not find any clues, leaving nowhere to share his sorrow for the pain caused by the death of his love.</p><p>The Luo Sect found clues with the directions pointed out by the Golden Emperor?</p><p>The clues are within the Ancient Fusang Realm which disappeared?</p><p>The Green Lotus Seed of Chaos which is Xiaosang’s reincarnation is hidden near the ancient Fusang tree?</p><p>Is this related to Eastern Emperor Taiyi who fell in the Archaeozoic era?</p><p>Doubts, desperation, impulses, and expectations pounded within Meng Qi and formed a complicated and indescribable feeling. Ignoring the astonished gazes from the crowd surrounding him, he wanted to rush to the Ancient Fusang Realm located in the Cloud Realm of No Thoughts to obtain the preparation left by Xiaosang before the Luo Sect could.</p><p>However, he had no Taoist power within himself. Since the Interior Realm had not recovered and his nine orifices were closed, he was just like another ordinary layman. How could he rush to the Ancient Fusang Realm and advance before the Luo Sect?</p><p>Frustration, vexation, and a feeling of incompetence emerged in him. However, Meng Qi’s experience for the past few days enlightened him suddenly, and he started to think from another perspective.</p><p>“Even if my abilities in martial arts weren’t cut off, that doesn’t prove anything. By awakening a Legendary Invincible Blade, I can only protect my own safety. I can’t stop any real mighty people!”</p><p>“The difference between Legendary and Celestial is too great and it can’t be made up by the sagacity of a Peerless Heavenly Weapon. An Invincible Blade can only protect me from the mighty people and this is already stronger than most in the universe. My feeling of incompetence has nothing to do with me giving up on martial arts.”</p><p>With the collision between his intense emotional changes and the contradiction of his experience in the past, he comprehended and reconstructed a new way of thinking without adding in any emotional cognitions to avoid his thoughts to be controlled by impulses and his previous habits in thinking.</p><p>Is this the other aspect of the actual self, one of the forms?</p><p>However, even so, Meng Qi realized that he never really thought of retreating or sitting on his hands for this matter.</p><p>“My incompetence is in terms of my martial arts, not my own self…” he sighed with emotions and took out the Myriad World Talisman given by Huang Chang. He logged into virtual Heaven and Earth and found the Customer Service Number of the Jade Mirage Express.</p><p>Yes, the Customer Service Number of the Jade Mirage Express!</p><p>True that he could not remember his old friend’s talisman numbers, but he could still make a detour.</p><p>Then, he chose customer service.</p><p>In the Jade Palace at Kunlun Mountain, Daqinggen’s twigs swayed like uncountable limbs. As he was playing a game with an apprentice, the noise of ringing spread across the atmosphere all of a sudden.</p><p>He turned over and muttered in confusion, “A customer request from the Jade Mirage Express?”</p><p>There were rarely calls from the Jade Mirage Express’s customer hotline as their service was spontaneous without any mistakes. Also, their charges were high with no discounts so there was nothing that required customer service.</p><p>“Should I pretend to be busy?” he hesitated and gazed into the Jade Palace. He wondered where Teacher Su went and when he would return.</p><p>As the caller was persistent and not giving up, Daqinggen finally pressed on the button with one of his twigs after some considerations.</p><p>“Hello, this is the Myriad World Customer Service Center of Jade Mirage Express… ” he said with a high-pitched voice. However, before he could finish his sentence, he was stopped by a voice that was distant yet somehow familiar, “Is this Daqinggen? Su Meng here.”</p><p>“Teacher Su? That’s impossible!” Daqinggen chuckled. His voice and manner felt different, how could he be Teacher Su? Moreover, he could just teleport anywhere as he liked by using karma link, why would he need Jade Mirage Express?</p><p>I have been the prankster all this time. How can anyone pull a prank on me?</p><p>He waited for the call to end, but the caller replied swiftly and clearly,</p><p>“Daqinggen has been curious about the unification between men and women so he tried to look for martial arts interactions with the Plain Girl Sect multiple times, but all he obtained was rubbish… he was also obsessed with shopping at the Myriad World Mall. He spent without limits so he had to cut off his own limbs to beg for survival… also, he was obsessed with games, he was greedy and he liked to boast around. He could throw away his dignity for a few Primitive Emperor Coins. What do you think? Should I let you continue as a concierge?”</p><p>Daqinggen’s whole body became greenish and juice beads were seeping through like sweat upon hearing those words. He dropped to his knees with a thump and he exclaimed loudly, “Forgive me, Teacher Su! I must have been blind and deaf for not recognizing you! Everything, everything you said was just my hobbies, I will not allow them to affect my job as a concierge. Please don’t worry, just tell me what I should change. I’m even willing to sacrifice my life…”</p><p>Listening to his sincere oath, Meng Qi said with a deep voice, “I’ll put this aside for now as you did provide labor even though you didn’t contribute much. Now, pass this call to Gao Lan, the Emperor of the Great Zhou Dynasty.”</p><p>“Yes, I’ll do it right away!” without thinking any further, Daqinggen activated his part of the authority on the Myriad World Knowledge Ball to pass the call to the deeper parts of the Palace of Great Zhou.</p><p>He was in a cold sweat when he finished his task. He said fearfully,</p><p>“Teacher Su does spot checks now…”</p><p>“I’m lucky that I have good qualifications and I’m experienced in this palace…”</p><p>He sighed as he muttered with terms from his world of greens.</p><p>On the other hand, unlike Daqinggen, Gao Lan was certain of Meng Qi’s identity from just a few sentences. He said with solemnity, “Brother, you must have something urgent since you’re contacting me in such a hurry.”</p><p>“The Luo Sect found the clues left by Xiaosang which were pointing toward the ancient Fusang tree so they are trying to open that precinct. I know that my request might be over-the-top but I can only turn to you. I hope that you can let the Emperor’s Descendants, the two Legendary mighty people to provide help to seize Xiaosang’s belongings,” since it was a serious matter to deal with the Legendary mighty people, Meng Qi had to be polite even though they were close to each other.</p><p>Gao Lan sighed after he heard Meng Qi’s request, “Love once begun, will never end.”</p><p>Bro, this is not the time for you to act like a sentiment saint… Meng Qi’s eyes twitched.</p><p>After letting out a sigh, Gao Lan said with a faint tone, “I had regrets so I wouldn’t want you to follow my footsteps. I’ll ask both Shaoxuan and Xi’e to help you. However, what you said is not related to them after all. If things escalated quickly and their lives are threatened, they will certainly not die for your cause. They will not listen to me even if I order them to.”</p><p>“That’s all I ask,” Meng Qi answered calmly. He knew that Shaoxuan and Xi’e, the two Legendary Emperor’s Descendants could only help him to a certain extent, so he was not surprised.</p><p>After the conversation ended, Meng Qi realized that he was surrounded by blank stares. He could not isolate his voice as he did not have his powers anymore. Although he tried to lower his volume, it was unavoidable for his voice to be transmitted to the martial artists with sharp hearing.</p><p>They were looking at himself as if he was a madman, a madman who was treating his imagination as reality. He was talking about a serious matter in the Real World and he is now acting like he’s the Primitive Emperor, a highly important person in many realms!</p><p>Without further thoughts, Meng Qi muttered the Moonlight Bodhisattva’s epithet silently and said, “Bodhisattva, I would like to enter the Vaiduryanirbhasa to check out the ancient Fusang tree.”</p><p>He disappeared from everyone’s sight immediately after he finished the sentence. A pair of twins cheered,</p><p>“Beautiful moonlight!”</p><p>“The man was taken away by the moonlight!”</p><p>…</p><p>Light and shadow flickered, and a pure land with greenery appeared in front of Meng Qi’s eyes. It stretched across hundreds and billions of distance and covered the Buddhist country without borders. It looked clean and complete. This was indeed the Vaiduryanirbhasa he was familiar with.</p><p>The towering Bodhi tree was withering but glorious and deep with a sense of Buddhism. The Moonlight Bodhisattva was sitting underneath the withering tree with an expression as clear as the moon. His numerous shadows were overlapping with each other from all sides, “I thought that you requested to go to the ancient Fusang tree?”</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said without rush, “I did have that thought and it was a strong thought. However, I asked myself, what can I do when I get there? Can I help in any way? Will I be pulling one’s leg? I chose to come here after I answered the questions. I am used to the ripples in my emotions. I should hold back my desire to head there at such timing.”</p><p>The Moonlight Bodhisattva waved with his right arm and the Eight Treasures Pond of Merits and Virtues appeared between them. It showed the ancient Fusang tree in the Cloud Realm of No Thoughts.</p><p>Cracks were obvious from the illusionary sense surrounding the tree. Fairy mountains and islands surrounded by mist could be seen from the cracks.</p><p>Meng Qi sat with his legs crossed. He had his usual expression with a smile as if what happened near the tree was none of his business.</p><p>“Mister, aren’t you worried, anticipated, or frustrated?” the voice of Moonlight Buddha echoed in his ears.</p><p>Meng Qi said with a smile, “Will these emotions help?”</p><p>“No,” the Moonlight Buddha smiled and shook his head.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded and said, “So, even if they are there, I will not be controlled or affected by them which will divert me to have a wrong way of thinking and cause me to make an incorrect decision.”</p><p>“Since you say so, what’s the point of you checking on the ancient Fusang tree?” the Moonlight Buddha felt like he was sharing about the theory of zen.</p><p>“Since there will be no difference, why not?” Meng Qi looked at the Eight Treasures Pond of Merits and Virtues and saw that Shaoxuan and Xi’e who were wearing old and plain clothing teleported to the cracks by ubiquitous technique. Xi’e was holding the minimized Last Ship whilst Shaoxuan was empty-handed.</p><p>As he observed everything, he reached toward the Pond of Merits and Virtues. A purple figure emerged from his palm and fell into the water. It penetrated through the intervals and formed into a purple thunder in the sky before it flew to Shaoxuan’s arms.</p><p>Rumble! The long sword looked powerful!</p><p>Shaoxuan held the Peerless Heavenly Weapon and weighed it in his hands. He gave his regards with a smile, and stepped into the crack, followed by Xi’e.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
