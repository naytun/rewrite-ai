Without it, he would just be a rootless duckweed, unable to do anything he wanted. Just thinking about it alone made him feel what it really meant to be powerless!</p><p>Seeing Meng Qi’s rare change in face color, Qi Zhengyan’s expression became more serious, and his tone was even flatter, “If not for the fact that we trust each other, and if this suggestion was made by someone else, would you think that this is a conspiracy - just a few words could fool the world’s strongest celestial being to self-destruct his martial arts, easily killing him?”</p><p>“Isn’t the strong resistance and struggle in your heart proof of your dependence on martial arts?”</p><p>“How many years did you use to live without martial arts?”</p><p>“Without martial arts, you wouldn’t be you?”</p><p>These words entered Meng Qi’s ears, and thoughts ran wild in his mind, confronting and refuting each other. He appeared to be shaken, but just couldn’t make up his mind.</p><p>That’s right, to this day, he really relied too much on martial arts, and it was hard to imagine how life without martial arts would be. If he couldn’t clear this layer of fog covering his real spirit, how could he see his actual self?</p><p>What kind of joke was this? His ability that is cultivated bit by bit was the most realistic, how could he forsake it for illusory hope? Without martial arts, how was he going to face all the issues in future?</p><p>If he didn’t cut himself to see himself as soon as possible to comprehend I am who I am, in the current situation where the Legendary characters were beginning to return in advance, it seemed that there wasn’t not much difference between a celestial being and a mortal. Why not take the plunge?</p><p>However, even if he didn’t give up martial arts, he might be able to find an opportunity to break through in the next few years by relying on improving himself with time? With the protection of the Moonlight Bodhisattva, the goodwill of the Qing Emperor, there shouldn’t be any problem holding on for a few years. Why should he try this dangerous and unguaranteed approach?</p><p>After explaining so much, wasn’t it just because he couldn’t let go of martial arts, and had already become a slave to martial arts?</p><p>Without martial arts, he would already have been a slave to others!</p><p>…</p><p>Having to answer this question concerning his future and life in such a short period of time, even Meng Qi who was always good at making decisions and fighting with his life was in a state of hesitation and struggle. His lips moved, and for a few times wanted to speak but couldn’t say anything.</p><p>Cut off the external I, only then can I see the real I?</p><p>Qi Zhengyan’s expression returned to normal and said slowly, “Think about it yourself, only you can make a decision for this kind of thing.”</p><p>After that, he left without turning back, stepping into the Southern Wasteland. Stars of fire gathered, as if forming a red torrent.</p><p>Meng Qi looked blankly at his back view, suddenly letting out a long sigh as his mind was full of thoughts. If this method could be as clear cutting the past and the future, and a considerable chance of succeeding as long as he followed the plan, he would have already tried. But Senior Qi had made it clear that even if he forsook martial arts, he might not be able to completely cut himself to see himself. This would be a waste of effort and he would have also lost his greatest reliance and become a useless person. This path was indiscernible, unpredictable and full of variables. How could he make up his mind?</p><p>Starting from the Legendary realm, the path was indescribable, and the journey was naturally indiscernible and unpredictable.</p><p>With his heart full of thoughts, he walked aimlessly and unknowingly arrived outside the city of Guangling. The tides of the rivers gushed against the dark color of dusk. This seemed to have not changed for thousands of years.</p><p>This was the place where he saw Xiaosang for the last time.</p><p>She struggled, and she lost… Meng Qi closed his eyes, the past was clear and vivid before his eyes. Gu Xiaosang’s expression and tonality were so real that he felt that it had just happened.</p><p>His eyes opened, looking deep. Through the dusk and fog, Meng Qi saw tower ships parked on the riverside port,. Their lights were tiny, looking like stars.</p><p>The scenery was the same year after year, but the people had changed.</p><p>Splash, the river flowed the same as before. As Meng Qi walked closer, scenes of what happened at the time appeared in his mind.</p><p>Judging from all the clues currently available, Xiaosang never gave up. Even if she was forced to choose to die in my hand, she still left behind a backup plan, waiting for the opportunity to make a comeback.</p><p>She was such a person – far-sighted, unpredictable, and never giving up.</p><p>A demoness should behave like a demoness, the kind of demoness whom you thought was dead and had no possibility of being resurrected, but yet saw her returning in a plain white dress where the lights were dim.</p><p>“Xiaosang left behind a backup and seemed to pin the hope of resurrection on me. Why did she believe that I could do it?”</p><p>“Was there no other way to do it, or was it an anticipation mixed with subtle feelings?”</p><p>“Was she confident of my future, or trusted the ability and resilience I can achieve?”</p><p>Meng Qi’s thoughts ran wild before finally returning to the martial arts issue, and was lost in thought for a long while.</p><p>The moon rose gradually as moonlight fell. In the silence, his green robe flowed and his back view was bleak as he crossed the river and headed north.</p><p>It was another night of lost traveling. When the sun rose, Meng Qi found himself on the bank of a vast lake, which was also a familiar place and a memory engraved in his heart.</p><p>It was once the Bayan Valley, now the Bayan Lake.</p><p>After doing nothing for a few months, hunting patiently, he finally reached the place where the Wolf King was killed.</p><p>Sitting face to face on the lake, you with the white lotus, me with the oil lamp, the place where the words unexpectedly came true.</p><p>The water was sparkling, bathing in the morning glow. There were fishing boats and also magnificent-looking tower ships on the shore.</p><p>Meng Qi breathed in the breeze on the lake, recalling things that happened in the past. There were a few tourists walking nearby.</p><p>“This is Bayan Valley?”</p><p>“Yes, the Bayan Valley where the Invincible Blade killed the Wolf King. This place witnessed his first appearance on the Man List and also him becoming the Primitive Emperor from the Invincible Blade.”</p><p>“After that, the Primitive Emperor still had a big battle here, changing the Bayan Valley into Bayan Lake?”</p><p>“Yes, at that time, he manifested as an evil celestial demon, went deep into the enemy’s den and fought with several great gurus here. He even suffered from ambush but was spared due to karma, and finally won a big victory.”</p><p>“This is really a place full of predecessors’ feats. Take a photo for me, I want to keep it as a memento.”</p><p>“Weren’t you feeling uneasy all the time? Why are you feeling so relaxed now?”</p><p>“Heh heh, the Primitive Emperor has the help of the descendants, and it is said that there are many Legendary supremes so they are not at all afraid of the demonic race and the Luo Sect, so why should we worry unnecessarily? Hurry up, take a photo of me with the Bayan Valley. There was the Invincible Blade in the past, today there is the renowned sword!”</p><p>Listening to their words, Meng Qi could not help but smile. This was himself in the eyes of others?</p><p>The focus of the Bayan Valley in his memories was completely different from what they said.</p><p>They only cared about his abilities and achievements. But for him, other than these, there was also a strange girl in white with red cheeks…</p><p>Because this is my experience.</p><p>Because it is unforgettable.</p><p>Suddenly feeling relaxed, Meng Qi held a smile in his mouth and slowly left the Bayan Valley, looking like an idle tourist. Having traveled all over the country, he returned to where his memories were one after another, pursuing his established self.</p><p>Traveling alone for tens of thousands of miles and notifying Shaolin relied on his abilities. What was sensation were his battle records, what was unforgettable was facing death with equanimity, what was righteous and indignant were his emotions.</p><p>Hastening his journey throughout the night and carrying the injured relied on abilities. What he gained were benefits, what went to his heart was the pleasure of settling kindness and enmity.</p><p>In Shaolin Temple, his ability was low. People that were unforgettable to him were his master and his little junior…</p><p>Removing the outside bit by bit and seeing the heart, Meng Qi gradually became quiet, like the bright moon hanging in the night sky.</p><p>Without martial arts, what would I be like?</p><p>Stopping at the edge of the cliff, watching the blue seawater, hitting the mountain wall and stirring up white foam, Meng Qi suddenly exhaled, and had made a decision in his mind.</p><p>It was only until now that he seemed to understand what his master Xuanbei always said about letting go, and the so-called breaking me.</p><p>I’ll give it a try, then!</p><p>Without martial arts, would I really not be me?</p><p>He took a step forward and onto the ocean, walking on the waves as he moved forward. At dawn, he arrived at a celestial island covered with clouds, and said in a clear voice, “Su Meng from Jade Mirage seeks an audience with the Primeval Deity.”</p><p>After a short pause, the voice of the Primeval Deity Bi Jingxuan came from the depths of the clouds, “What did you come here for, Master Su?”</p><p>Meng Qi cupped his fists together as greeting and said, “There is one thing I would like to ask for your help. I will definitely repay your kindness in future as long as I’m alive.”</p><p>“What is it?” Bi Jingxuan neither agreed nor disagreed.</p><p>“Please use the Primeval Dipper to remove half of my cultivation,” Meng Qi said with a serious expression.</p><p>“Are you crazy?” Bi Jingxuan blurted and then turned silent right after like she had guessed something. After a long while, she said, “Do you really want to do this?”</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said, “If I don’t cut myself off, how do I see me?”</p><p>“There are always all kinds of danger on the journey of martial arts. Even if you don’t face this, you still have to face other things.”</p><p>Bi Jingxuan did not speak again. The Primeval Dipper flew out from the depths of the clouds as golden light fell, forming a yellow river. With a turn and a wave, it was set on top of Meng Qi’s head.</p><p>Meng Qi did not use the Supreme Endless Premier to resist as he felt his own power being cut off quickly, and his Dharmakaya body that he had practised hard for gradually fading away the rules of integration and became a flesh body again. Things that were familiar, things that he relied on, and his martial arts that almost became his hands and feet all disappeared, leaving only the Principles of Karma with him. But how could he use it without any power?</p><p>What kind of experience would it be without martial arts?</p><p>Empty, inexplicable fear, no sense of security.</p><p>The Primeval Dipper flew back and the corner of Meng Qi’s mouth suddenly twitched. It was really not a good experience without martial arts.</p><p>It is simply embarrassing!</p><p>His robe was created by his power and the rest of the things were in the Invincible Blade. Now that he had no more power, he couldn’t take out the clothes nor maintain them on his body.</p><p>As such, there was a flasher on the Island of Three Clouds.</p><p>Bi Jingxuan also did not seem to have expected this situation. After a while, she threw out a set of clothing for ordinary male disciples.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
