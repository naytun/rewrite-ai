He couldn’t tell if he was more surprised or delighted, but he was definitely alarmed.</p><p>Who is this Primitive Emperor? He is the first supreme to have  achieved Legendary status since the Middle Ages, the Descendent of  Premier and the Teacher of Jade Palace, one who coerces the universe and  is honored among celestials!</p><p>Not even the Wang family from Jiangdong today could ever dream of  catching up with a mighty person like him, let alone an ordinary family  like us from an unremarkable place!</p><p>The gap in power between us is like a mortal without martial skills in the past against celestial beings!</p><p>Hence, what does the Sun family have that could initiate a request from the Primitive Emperor for our presence?</p><p>I would be overwhelmed, eagerly traveling day and night to pay a  visit to Jade Palace in Kunlun Mountain, even if only a decree was sent  to me. It need not be from the Primitive Emperor himself. However, it is  only a wild wish that I dare not even ask for in my dreams. Who knew  that the Primitive Emperor himself would arrive at our doorstep today?</p><p>It was too good to be true that it felt like an illusion. Master Sun was doubtful.</p><p>I cannot possibly just believe he is who he claims himself to be.</p><p>Our family friend, the Song family, was once scammed by a fake Taoist and lost a fortune. Am I facing a similar situation now?</p><p>As thoughts swirled in his mind, the usual complacency of Master Sun  faded. He looked forward to the visit, but at the same time, he was  apprehensive.</p><p>The servant came crashing into the room, ignored the look of  consternation from the midwife and the rest and panted, “The man looks  exactly like the few disclosed images of the Primitive Emperor in the  myriad world access. Others couldn’t possibly impersonate this…”</p><p>He grew dubious as he spoke. It is said that Baize demons and  macaques are good at changing forms, and there are many secret arts to  deceive in the demonic sect. Moreover, his martial skills and eye  judgement can only see through low level disguises. Higher levels could  slip by him unnoticed. Now, he couldn’t convince himself that the man  outside the door was indeed the mighty person of the Legendary realm,  Primitive Emperor, Lord of Immortal.</p><p>Floored, he came up with explanations and excuses, stuttering, “Who  in the world dares to disguise himself as the Primitive Emperor? Aren’t  they afraid of being struck by lightning from heaven? There are  lightning punishments of different levels for selling counterfeit items  in the Myriad World Mall, let alone disguising himself as the owner of  the Myriad World Knowledge Ball.”</p><p>“You have a point…” With the cries of the baby in his ear, Master Sun  nodded lightly, but then furrowed his brow soon after, saying, “But the  Primitive Emperor won’t have time for insignificant people like us! Why  don’t you go make a thread in the myriad world access and post for  help?”</p><p>“Yes, Old Master!” the servant hurriedly fished out his Myriad World  Talisman and went into the Jianghu Teahouse forum he normally mingled  with. He drafted the content quickly and exaggerated it to attract  attention:</p><p>“There’s a person outside my home claiming to be the Primitive  Emperor, Lord of Immortal from the Jade Palace of Kunlun Mountain. He  said I was born with the potential to be a celestial and wants to accept  me as his disciple. I’m in a panic as I’m uncertain whether he is the  person he claims to be. Everyone, please help me to verify this. I’ll be  waiting online. It’s very urgent!”</p><p>Just when he was about to attach the image taken by tactical  formation of the Taoist outside the door, he heard his old master’s soft  yell.</p><p>“Hold on!”</p><p>Alarmed, his hand jerked and the post was uploaded. It went public just like that…</p><p>“Old Master?” he questioningly stared at his master, puzzled.</p><p>Oblivious, Master Sun, who regained the demeanor of being the head of  household, pondered and sensibly said, “What if he really is the  Primitive Emperor? Will he be offended that we don’t trust his words and  even posted a query to verify him? If that’s the case, we might put  ourselves in a tough situation!”</p><p>He nodded and continued, “It’s better to believe than to doubt under  such circumstances. We’ll open the gates and welcome him with our  highest regards. As long as he doesn’t ask for riches, we’ll regard him  as the genuine Primitive Emperor. Even if he is proved to be a fake  later on, we’ll only be slightly humiliated. It’s way better than to  anger the Primitive Emperor, right?”</p><p>The lesser of the two evils!</p><p>But I’ve already posted it… mouth agape, the servant didn’t dare to  tell the truth. A chilly breeze blew and he shuddered, hiding his  actions, “Yes, Old Master!”</p><p>I’ll delete that post once I get the chance!</p><p>However, he was immediately assigned to greet the Primitive Emperor. It got busy and chaotic.</p><p>Wearing a green robe, Meng Qi stood outside the doors of the Sun  family with his hands folded behind him. His face was impassive, staring  off into space as if pondering something. He waited patiently.</p><p>Several moments later, the main gates of the Sun family home opened.  It was followed by a parade of elders led by the master. Behind them, a  red carpet was spread out on the floor, leading straight to the main  hall.</p><p>Upon seeing Meng Qi, Master Sun fell to his knees and kowtowed thrice with great respect and fear.</p><p>“Lord Su of Immortal. Commoner Sun Jiaolong at your service!”</p><p>The elders, children, and grandchildren kowtowed after him, but they were not qualified to report their names.</p><p>Meng Qi waved his right hand and smiled, “There is no need for Master  Sun to prepare such a grand welcome. I happened to be watching the  celestial events and have sensed that I have a fate with the child your  wife has given birth to, so I decided to pay a visit.”</p><p>My child has a fate with the Primitive Emperor? Master Sun was  intoxicated. Astounded and with great joy, he hastily ordered, “Quick,  get my son so that Lord Su can take a look at him!”</p><p>At his words, a maid with extraordinary martial skills sprinted nimbly into the inner court and brought out the young master.</p><p>Standing up to receive his baby, Master Sun looked at Meng Qi  eagerly, asking, “Lord Su, is it true that my son has a fate with you?”</p><p>As though he had sensed something, the wailing baby suddenly quieted down. His instant giggles left everyone amazed.</p><p>Meng Qi walked toward Master Sun and lowered his head to look at the  baby. While teasing the baby, he took out a token carved with the words  Disciple of Jade Palace. Smiling, he said, “Master Sun, are you willing  to let me take this child as my disciple?”</p><p>“Y-yes! Of course! It’s what I yearn for!” Master Sun replied  hurriedly. He didn’t care whether it was the true Primitive Emperor  anymore, as once the celestial fate is lost, it will not return again.</p><p>Nodding slightly, Meng Qi stuffed the token into the swaddling  clothes of the baby, “He will do great things with martial arts and will  live a carefree life of optimism and enmity. Therefore, I christen Wu  as his name.”</p><p>There was nothing special about the words, but the Illusory River  appeared right in front of Master Sun’s eyes, and he felt the  alternation of destiny. He was amazed and thought to himself, Spells  enforce at his command. Is this the power of a mighty person?</p><p>Meng Qi caressed the baby’s forehead before retracting his right  hand. With a slight nod, he said, “Send him to the Jade Palace in Kunlun  Mountain with the token when he is 10 years old.”</p><p>He turned around as magic clouds solidified at his feet. No one knew where he was headed as he disappeared into the skies.</p><p>He didn’t ask for money and even asked for my child to be sent to the  Jade Palace in Kunlun Mountain. He is the true Primitive Emperor! Sun  Jiaolong’s emotions exploded and blossomed into a mixture of excitement,  sentimental, and joy.</p><p>My son will lead the Sun family to prosperity!</p><p>The rest of the family members were completely shaken, but most were  also honored. It was exceptionally silent for quite some time until  Master Sun shouted, “We should build a temple for the Primitive  Emperor!”</p><p>After announcing his decision, he knit his brows, “We should keep a  secret about the Primitive Emperor’s visit and not tell others yet. They  will eventually know about this after my son has gone to the Jade  Palace to practice martial arts.”</p><p>He was unsure if the Primitive Emperor of Immortal would be pleased  if they publicized the matter. It was best to keep a low profile as  there would be countless chances to boast in the future.</p><p>At his side, the servant turned pale. He snuck out of the main gates and took out his Myriad World Talisman to delete the post.</p><p>Upon opening, he heard a continuous string of notification alerts. In  just a short period of time, there were already thousands of replies.</p><p>“The thread starter is such a joker!”</p><p>“Help, help! A majestic man with a dignified appearance knocked on my  door just now, claiming to be the son of heaven of the Great Zhou  Dynasty. He said I have the demeanor of a tyrant and wants to make me  heir to the throne. Help me to identify whether he is real!”</p><p>“Guys, daydreaming is bad for your health. I have to go, the  government hall has decided to appoint me as the prime minister, and I  have to pack my belongings to Changle City…”</p><p>A tossed stone raises a thousand ripples. The servant didn’t expect  his post to draw such entertaining discussions. He wiped the sheen of  cold sweat from his forehead, relieved that no one believed him, and  deleted the post.</p><p>Since then, similar posts appeared and became a long-lasting entertainment.</p><p>…</p><p>At the foot of Kunlun Mountain was a prosperous city.</p><p>Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu tried practicing the Star Sparks Art. They could clearly feel the enigma of it.</p><p>“It is indeed a divine skill that can position one in the celestial  group. If we had it earlier, we wouldn’t have to waste so much time.” Yu  Banshan sighed, “The celestial world is indeed an unusual place.”</p><p>Qi Jinxiu was also exuberant. A divine skill like this only costs several pieces of silver!</p><p>As her gaze drifted around casually, she suddenly saw a man standing  outside the window wearing a green robe with his hands folded behind  him, his temperament unearthly and he looked melancholy.</p><p>“The-the Primitive Emperor!” words shot out of Qi Jinxiu’s mouth in a rush.</p><p>The Legend of this era is just a feet away!</p><p>Yu Banshan, who glanced over dumbfoundedly and saw the familiar figure as well, stammered, “Lord, Lord Su…”</p><p>The Jade Palace was located so deep that even the clouds would not  know about its whereabouts, but the Teacher, Lord Su had appeared  outside the door!</p><p>Looking at them, Meng Qi could not find any trace of Zhang Yuanshan  and Fu Zhenzhen. They had gone through reincarnation twice, their souls  replaced and detached from the Real World, and were already two brand  new persons.</p><p>Even if he awakened the memories of their previous lives before  reincarnation, they would only understand the back story, they would  remain completely detached and different from their former selves.</p><p>I’m always against resurrection by taking over another body, even if  its a fish or so on. How can I be so hard-hearted to erase Yu Banshan  and Qi Jinxiu’s memories and personalities?</p><p>That’s also why I didn’t meet Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu, even though I  had brought them to Kunlun Mountain. I didn’t even let them come close  during the second time.</p><p>The dead is dead, except if one achieves the Nirvana Realm.</p><p>Meng Qi shut his eyes for a moment and asked with uncertainty, “Who are you?”</p><p>What a strange question… Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu were taken aback but replied earnestly.</p><p>“Your junior, Yu Banshan.”</p><p>“Your junior, Qi Jinxiu.”</p><p>“Yu Banshan, Qi Jinxiu…” Meng Qi recited the two names and heaved a long sigh.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
