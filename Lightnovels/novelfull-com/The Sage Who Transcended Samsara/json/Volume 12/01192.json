The Dipankara Buddha was no exception. Facing these two beams of white light, the ancient lamp in his hand suddenly shrunk.</p><p>In an instant, the flammule-like big sun was disconnected from the boundless pure land, having no more karma link, and was held alone by the Immortal Flying Blade. As the treasure turned, the big sun turned into raining lights and disappeared.</p><p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, the emperor’s double pupils once again showed Maitreya’s figure, and the experiences of his past ten moments. Meng Qi was above the Thousand Buddha Formation, his right hand holding a clear Invincible Blade concentrated with purple lightning, as though forming a universe made up of pure thunderbolts. In his left hand was a blurry long sword with clear light flashing, seeming like sparks of wisdom, forming numerous round mirrors that clearly reflected the changes of the glaze enchanted boundary, making it seem like there was no secrets!</p><p>The remains of the emperor struck with the sword and once again interfered with the Damiaoxiang a few moments ago, causing chaos in the Thousand Buddha Formation.</p><p>Meng Qi used both the blade and the sword together, one of real power and one of illusory wisdom, forming yin and yang, and intertwined into a Taiji scroll. The scroll turned upside down and black and white collapse, as it displayed chaos that was a little inclusive and transformative of all things back to their original.</p><p>Chaos swallowing the universe!</p><p>Although it wasn’t his real self and there was no Wu’Ji Seal, Meng Qi preemptively simulated the dark chaos with the power of the blade and the sword!</p><p>Chaos fell, and the chaotic Thousand Buddha Formation immediately disappeared into it. Shadows of the golden-bodied Buddhas, the swastikas, and the glaze boundaries were swallowed by darkness, leaving no trace behind.</p><p>Beside Meng Qi, the four celestial swords shook, shooting down hundreds of thousands of four colored sword auras that followed the chaos to struck majestically at Maitreya, wanting to destroy this future Buddha in Jiangdong!</p><p>Seeing this situation, Maitreya sighed again and seemed to be chanting in a low voice, “Namo Amitabha.”</p><p>The sighs reverberated, and inside of the three relics were erratic. The relic that contained all kinds of possibilities flew out and a flammule surged, turning into a white lotus that transformed into a future Star Buddha. The face was the same as Maitreya, but without any smile, and the eyes were filled with resolute!</p><p>After hundreds of millions of calamities and falling into the sea of sufferings, the Buddha’s heart remained unchanged.</p><p>To not redeem the sentient beings, not save the end of the world, and not ask for the future!</p><p>The future Star Buddha suddenly burst into flames, and the future relic became completely illusory, illuminating the three realms, and created white lotuses. Many futures might disappear along with it, whether it was the future in which the chaos of blade and sword broke the Thousand Buddha Formation of Wanfo Dafa, or the future in which the Celestial Slaying Sword Formation swallowed Maitreya. They might all disappear!</p><p>Ruling out all kinds of possibilities, there was only one thing that was certain - the shattered future relic gave Maitreya the opportunity to get out of the sword formation.</p><p>The Maitreya threw out the Human Sack and captured Damiaoxiang and other Bodhisattvas and Arhats of his own pure land into it. The surrounding white lotuses were blooming and withered one after another, and his Dharmakaya body and Sambhogakaya body reached Nirvana. Outside the sword formation, a white lotus could be seen blooming slowly, and Maitreya was seated high above it.</p><p>The little red gourd emitted light and an object came into view. When it was about to shoot out two white lights, the Dipankara Buddha sitting in the middle of the boundless pure land flicked a finger and shot out a Sea Calming Pearl containing the various heavens of Buddhism, immediately hitting the red gourd and flipping it open.</p><p>Maitreya sighed once again, and his golden body jumped and entered the pure land of the Dipankara Buddha.</p><p>The future relic was one of the three fruits of his exploration of the path of Nirvana, which took more than a million years. Once broken, related memories and experiences would disappear along with it, and he would have to do everything step by step again!</p><p>After practicing hard for so many years, all his cultivation would turn to naught.</p><p>…</p><p>Red silk fabric danced in the sky, the Qiankun Loop fell, the Wind Fire Wheels gave out real fire that burned in the sky, the fire spear was everywhere, such that the Bull Demon King was unable to find an opportunity to get out of the sword formation.</p><p>The remains of the emperor could still manifest here and started to target the Bull Demon King again.</p><p>The sword formation controlled by Meng Qi did not make any concession. The four colored sword auras maneuvered, occasionally hitting the Bull Demon King and left wounds that were difficult to recover on his armor and body. Also, they quickly interlaced was about to form chaos to spread over and swallow the Bull Demon King.</p><p>If that happened, no matter how outstanding the Bull Demon King was during his Journey to the West, his current realm wasn’t sufficient and he had to face the music here.</p><p>At this moment, a violent roar came from the sky, “Get out of my way!”</p><p>The Golden Cudgel was held up and struck next to the Flip Heaven Seal, hitting it away and bringing about aftermath of continuous explosion which was eliminated by the sword formation.</p><p>Amidst the light waves, a golden Buddha hand popped in, solemn and magnificent, lingering with a little flammule. It grabbed the Bull Demon King right away, and used the back of the hand to counter Nezha’s spear and hoop, resulting in numerous sparks. Under the attack of billions of sword auras, it forced itself out of the sword formation.</p><p>The Victorious Fighting Buddha had arrived!</p><p>Facing the full-powered Sun Wukong, the Flip Heaven Seal was just a heavenly weapon no matter how strong it was. Guangcheng Tianzun had only arrived with a trace of his energy, and his joint forces with Nezha and the remains of the emperor wouldn’t be able to stop him.</p><p>He had nothing fancy, no magic weapon, but just pure power.</p><p>…</p><p>Yuan Hong’s entire body was shining with pale golden light as he used his indestructible body to resist the murderous sword aura hit down by the Celestial Sword Formation.</p><p>Clang, bang, around him were countless splendors created by the sword beams, bursting hundreds of millions of sparks. He transformed from time to time, hiding whenever there was an opportunity.</p><p>Moving all the way up, Yuan Hong exhausted all his means and transformations. Even his indestructible body had many wounds, and he finally reached the border of the sword formation.</p><p>As he jumped up, infinite sword auras immediately enveloped him. The killing intent suddenly smashed his head, leaving numerous wounds that shattered the interior realm on his pale golden shiny body.</p><p>However, Yuan Hong’s body did not stop, seizing the opportunity to dash out of the sword formation. At his neck was a clear aura, and a white lotus grew inside the clear aura. The white lotus opened and closed, and there was another skull.</p><p>Finally managing to escape, Yuan Hong clenched his teeth. If not for the fact that he hadn’t recovered from the injuries inflicted by the Qing Emperor, he wouldn’t be in such a sorry state!</p><p>At this moment, a red gourd jumped out from the void in front of him. A light beam shot out from inside and an object with eyes inside the light beam came into view. Two white lights shot out from the object’s eyes, falling at the top of Yuan Hong’s head.</p><p>Yuan Hong had a premonition of danger but lacked the ability to take action. Unable to dodge due to his serious injuries, he was head, his body and his transformations were held.</p><p>Horrified, he heard Lu Ya’s voice in his ear, “Fellow practitioner, show your true form!”</p><p>As thoughts ran in Yuan Hong’s mind, Lu Ya shouted again, “Fellow practitioner, show your true form!”</p><p>Thereafter, Yuan Hong shook his body and turned into a white-haired ape monkey, watching helplessly at the red gourd putting a seal spell on himself.</p><p>After settling it, the little red gourd shook and Lu Ya’s voice came out from it, “Practitioner Yuan Hong, you shall continue guarding Golden Turtle Island. No one is allowed to go near the Qingping Sword.”</p><p>Yuan Hong bared his teeth and said respectfully, “I will obey your command.”</p><p>Lu Ya instructed satisfactorily before the little red gourd jumped and got out of the real world again.</p><p>This time, he had only made one request. Lead Yuan Hong here, injure him, and then handed him over to himself.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the Palace of Frost, the ancient bronze coffin was no longer closed. The Seven-Orifice Devil’s Heart that continually shrunk and swelled, emitting illusory rays and negative emotions, was forced to be awakened in advance.</p><p>After a few moments, the surrounding void moved. A red and bloody demonic body stepped out. It was filled with a murderous air, and had neither a heart, a skull, nor four limbs.</p><p>The Seven-Orifice Devil’s Heart jumped into the demonic body and returned to the position of the heart, connecting the internal organs and the acupoints of the entire body.</p><p>Followed this, a Great Asura full of killing intent came, tearing through the void. Its entire body was covered in black flames, burning many universes, bringing them endless pain.</p><p>The Asura body suddenly manifested itself as a powerful but dark pair of legs, which was combined with the previous demonic body.</p><p>Then, a body of evil god with the blood brown Nether around it came. Its bottom was black with white revolving, and it was neither dead nor alive.</p><p>The body turned into a left hand and merged into the demonic body, leaving it short of only a head and a right hand.</p><p>Surrounded by black lightning, a skull suddenly appeared, The face showed old emotions, the hair was all white, the beard was all black, and the eyes were deeply evil.</p><p>The moment the skull fell on the neck, the various realms and worlds seemed to give out a cry. Muffled thunder exploded one after another, and the Netherworld rejoiced again, having witnessed the return of the Supreme Devil Body.</p><p>The Supreme Demonic Monarch had reappeared in the world!</p><p>However, his right hand was still incomplete, and could not be compensated by flesh or blood. The Demonic Body of Six Annihilations must be re-cultivated.</p><p>At this moment, the Supreme Devil Body couldn’t be complete.</p><p>The one-armed Demonic Monarch looked at the Southern Wasteland and after a short ponder, stepped into the Western Region and into the border of the God Burial Desert.</p><p>Here, the endless sea quietly breathed of demonic air.</p><p>His expression didn’t change as he went forward into the sea, and quickly sank.</p><p>He wanted to use the opportunity of Great Zhou’s unfinished battle to break the enchanted boundary restored by the Sea Calming Pearl and the power of all beings to release the Netherworld, mess up the situation, and attack the Southern Wasteland!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
