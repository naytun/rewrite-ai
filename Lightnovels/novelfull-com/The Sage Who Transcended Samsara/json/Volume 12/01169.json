He quit the game to achieve the Yidao Real  Body. Ever since then, Meng Qi had not encountered the Hell of Dreams  again. Despite having the will, he could not find it at all. Moreover,  the alleged King Yama was positioned at the very top of the Real Spirit  Map and had the power of a Legend at his home field. The old Meng Qi was  no match for him. So, he had temporarily disregard the issue of Luo  Shengyi to await the right timing.</p><p>Now he had entered the Legendary Realm in the most perfect manner to  achieve uniqueness. He was better than some of the mighty people who  returned earlier but did not have the best of their strengths. He also  owned the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade and manipulated the Nether Skeleton.  He was confident to wrestle with the experienced Legendary King Yama.  Even if he could not defeat King Yama as King Yama was supported by the  Underworld, Meng Qi could still manage to create commotion in Hell.</p><p>How much is King Yama willing to lose to stop the reincarnation of an insignificant person like Luo Shengyi?</p><p>As long as I persevere, it should not be too difficult to handle.</p><p>A glaze lamp appeared deep within Meng Qi’s eyes. The light of black  and white was constantly rotating around it. Compared to the past, they  seemed to be able to shine into the vast Universe, light up the entire  Heavens and Myriad World. They were close to grasping the Principles of  Karma.</p><p>The karma light shone on the Nether Skeleton, releasing a yellow mist  that wafted in the air and formed multiple unspecific lines. The  threads were exposed and stretched. Together, they unearthed the past  and formed many complicated and tortuous stories.</p><p>Among the powerful forces who wished to build the Underworld, the  presence of the Long River of Nether that symbolizes death and demise,  was integral. To achieve the goal, it could either create a simulation  or import the stream of the Nine Nether Real River. As it was slowly  brought to perfection, it gradually got closer to the Nine Levels of  Underground and the celestial world, then eventually merged as one with  the true Nether and achieved fulfillment. Therefore, one could sense the  Dream of Hell with the help of the Nether Skeleton!</p><p>The Principles of Karma rotated and recalled the link Meng Qi  obtained back then. He inspected the numerous karma threads that traced  to the Nether Skeleton. It was as though Meng Qi was completely consumed  by the chaotic dimness, he appeared to be carrying the aura of a God  Master. Gu Xiaosang gave a soft chuckle before she returned to being  silent. It seemed like she was looking at the new born body to  comprehend the Congenital Virtue. She then resumed to focus on  practicing.</p><p>After a long while, the Invincible Blade beside Meng Qi quaked and  let out a faint buzz. The several karma threads on the Nether Skeleton  soared up abruptly. They shone brilliantly with stained yellow blood and  connected the void.</p><p>I found it! A three-feet long bolt shot out of his eye as he extended his right hand.</p><p>…</p><p>Amid the undefined chaos that bore all things, a bloody brown long  river, where countless water demons and damned souls perished, ran  through the misty heaven and earth. There were magnificent lofty stone  bridges built over the river. Beautiful and fragrant flowers bloomed  along the river bank, helping one to forget about all the worries. Six  Bridges of Reincarnation were hidden deep within and pitch dark  basilicas built across the land. They were used to communicate with the  Myriad World and the universe, Yin soldiers and grim reapers walked  around in a busy but orderly manner. The land appeared peaceful and  quiet, as though the entire place was dead. Together with the occasional  agonized wails, the fright for death was amplified.</p><p>Just then, the ghastly Hell of Dream blacked out into complete  darkness. A pure white palm that was coated with a brilliant splendor  reached down from above. Its fingers were spread open, attempting to  encase the entire Underworld. The hand seemed to be capable of  annihilating heaven and earth. The grand basilicas, at this moment,  appeared like tiny chicks under the gigantic hand, ready to crumble down  before the palm could even attack.</p><p>“Su Meng!”</p><p>An enraged yell echoed across Yama Palace. The extremely frightened  and timid Yin soldiers and grim reapers were stunned and dumbfounded. An  aura penetrated the clouds and shot upward, turning into many black  grand suns that were majestic yet eerie and solemn.</p><p>They were scattered throughout the sky and formed a black galaxy, creating a star chart that beautifully described the universe.</p><p>The star chart rotated and turned into an enormous, robust fist.  Coupled by the sense of death that pervaded the Hell of Dream, the fist  charged at the palm that overturned the place!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The enormous hand with the aura of a God Master struck the fist,  creating a muffled thud. The black grand suns broke down and the black  galaxy dismantled, tearing apart the star chart mercilessly. Heaven  collapsed and earth sank unstoppably. Before the catastrophe destroyed  the grand basilicas and Bridges of Reincarnation, it was appeased by the  remaining Nine Hall Ghost Emperors.</p><p>Back then, with the help of the Fan Tian Seal, Heavenly Lord  Guangcheng was peerless in the Archaeozoic Era and ancient times as he  defeated innumerable Legends in the Creation Realm. Today, the attack  had almost revived the repute!</p><p>Within the great hall, the screen behind Yama and the tiles abruptly  exploded and broke into bits. Seemingly, the size of the giant body of  the Ghost Emperor was reduced within a fraction of a second.</p><p>He could barely achieve a stalemate even though he had home field  advantage and the accumulated power of a Legend throughout the years.</p><p>Numerous virtual shadows of Hell emerged and surrounded him. The expansive power was summoned and assembled in his right hand.</p><p>“Su Meng!”</p><p>He roared in rage again, brandishing his right hand that was clenched  into a fist. Black suns reappeared inside the hall and assembled into  the giant star chart and a great palm once again.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>As he hurled his fist, the Yin soldiers, grim reapers, wronged souls,  and evil spirits cried in agony synchronously as if they recalled the  fear and discontentment they had before their deaths.</p><p>The flowers of the Nirvana Realm withered, the stream of the yellow  blood river slowed down and the long bridge that led to Samsara squeaked  as it united its utmost power into the star chart giant palm.</p><p>There was an end for every beginning. All living things were destined  to die from the moment they were born. Although the Heavens and the  Myriad World seemed to be deathless, they would eventually meet an end.</p><p>The blow of the fist marked the end of everything!</p><p>The great fist created by the pitch dark star chart attacked the sky, aiming at the giant hand that was approaching the ground.</p><p>Pitch darkness was dispersed from Meng Qi’s pure palm, separating the  Yin and Yang and overturning life and death. As though it was bearing  the confidence of the Heavens and the secret of immortality, it  unexpectedly turned into a perfect match with the Hell of Dream.</p><p>A loud bang resonated!</p><p>As the fist and palm collided, Yang surfaced at the end of Yin. The  grim reapers and wronged souls were shocked to notice their lively aura  and forming of their almost mortal body.</p><p>Another loud bang resonated!</p><p>Yama’s body was shaken by the quake as the eerie atmosphere  intensified and anguished cries constantly echoed across the atmosphere.</p><p>He witnessed as Meng Qi extended his palm downward. The blood brown  long river that pierced through the Hell of Dream quivered abruptly as  though it had come alive, like a creature that resembled the real dragon  or enormous snake. It was about to escape, shred it’s skin and remove  it’s bones to return to the origin.</p><p>The thunder rumbled!</p><p>The entire Hell of Dream quaked violently as the blood brown long  river was plucked and bent into an arch. It was surprisingly defenseless  as the water ghosts and wronged souls that was hiding within screeched  gratingly and began to vanish into thin air.</p><p>As he watched the blood brown long river soar into the sky, Yama reached out his hand to stop it without hesitation.</p><p>Losing the self-created Nether River will wound Hell seriously and who knows how long it will take to heal!</p><p>So, must I alert the Great Emperor?</p><p>With thoughts bobbing up and down in his mind, he bellowed as he was tugging the blood brown long river from Meng Qi.</p><p>“What exactly do you want, Su Meng?”</p><p>He had weakened his attitude. If the Great Emperor was alerted to  bestow power because of petty matters, causing his hibernation to be  disturbed, Yama would definitely be punished. But, if the Great Emperor  was not awakened and only bestowed minimal power, he might not be able  to defend himself from a fearless true Legendary, just like the time  when the Wang family from Jiangdong was involved.</p><p>The giant pure white hand paused its movement and the blood brown  long river halted in the sky. Meng Qi’s voice resonated from a place far  away.</p><p>“Allow Luo Shengyi to reincarnate.”</p><p>That’s it? Yama almost cursed. Can’t you discuss with me after you  have attained Legendary status? I can’t possibly fight you because of  this petty issue, can I?</p><p>How can you launch a direct attack!</p><p>You’re totally presumptuous and arrogant!</p><p>Although he was condemning Meng Qi, he understood that Meng Qi was  taking the chance to execute his revenge. I can still protect Hell, but I  may not be able to stop Su Meng from robbing the evidently oppressed  blood brown long river.</p><p>Will I risk Hell with a great loss for petty matters like this?</p><p>As he went through his thoughts and filtered his emotions, Yama  dwelled in his thoughts as he grunted in a low voice and waved his hand.  It was as though he threw the Luo Shengyi who was in the Ghost Dungeon  over the Bridge of Humanity and into the corresponding Dim Swirlpool. A  glimmering star beamed from the sky and wrapped up Luo Shengyi’s souls  and spirits.</p><p>“Do you still want to know about the news of Zhang Yuanshan’s and Fu  Zhenzhen’s reincarnation?” after everything was completed, Yama asked.</p><p>Su Meng has gained great power. Before the Great Emperor returns,  it’s better for me to not not offend him. The wiser choice is to work  with him, disregarding my hatred and ill feelings toward him.</p><p>Meng Qi’s reply echoed from far away as though it came from way beyond the sky. He put on a grin as he spoke.</p><p>“Yama doesn’t have to worry about this anymore. I obtained some clues after the advancement of the Principles of Karma.”</p><p>As he spoke, the blood brown long river slowly fell back to its own place.</p><p>After that, everything returned to silence. No one was speaking. The stream continued to flow as it slowly sunk in.</p><p>Yama stood at the center of the hall, staring into the blank sky for a very long time.</p><p>…</p><p>At the ancestral house of the Sun family from Jiangdong, the master  was pacing back and forth, waiting for his wife to deliver the baby. The  screen could only block his view but not his emotions.</p><p>It was noon but the sky was dark, as if it was going to rain heavily. The atmosphere was extremely depressing.</p><p>Thunder rumbled!</p><p>A stream of lightning flashed across the sky, chasing away the darkness for a brief moment.</p><p>The baby’s cry broke the silence. The midwife excited the room with a baby in her arms and a broad smile on her face.</p><p>“Congratulations, old master! You have a descendant to bear your legacy!”</p><p>The master received the infant and studied the baby closely. The baby  had soft and tender skin, appearing to be very adorable. He could not  help but chuckle.</p><p>Just then, his servant rushed into the room, looking shocked and frightened.</p><p>“Master, master, something big is happening! Su Meng, the Primitive Emperor, wishes to meet you!”</p><p>Su Meng, the Primitive Emperor? Su Meng, the Primitive Emperor from  the Jade Palace of Kunlun Mountain? The master was as shocked at the  news as his servant was.</p><p>A Legendary mighty person is here to meet me?</p><p>What is happening?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
