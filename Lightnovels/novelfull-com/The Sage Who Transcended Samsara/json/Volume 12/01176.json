It grew longer with the wind, quickly filling the sky. The pattern on it was simple, and it didn’t have the power to connect the various worlds, hence couldn’t borrow strength from the various universes, but it pressured the Celestial Vase Ambassador to use the world isolated by the projection of Lifeless Heaven and the Void Hometown to collapse rapidly.</p><p>Faced with the greenish-gray ancient seal, Meng Qi seemed to have witnessed a portion of the real world falling from the sky, a weight that exceeded logic and oppression that exceeded the concept of illusion and realism. It was enough to turn heaven and earth upside down - flip the various heavens and bury the netherworld!</p><p>Flip Heaven Seal!</p><p>These three words spontaneously came appeared in Meng Qi’s mind. Heavenly Lord Guangcheng’s Flip Heaven Seal!</p><p>The Flip Heaven Seal that displayed mighty power as a non-Peerless Heavenly Weapon during the War of Deification!</p><p>Pah!</p><p>The Flip Heaven Seal fell, bringing along the shattered world as it hit the dark swirl that was emitting clear light.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The ancient patterns of the Flip Heaven Seal emerged and surrounded its body, while its body carried the vicissitudes of the last era, showing a translucent state. The inside was like a myriad of fragments flying, and every piece was shaped like a real world, hitting the approaching hand back to dust, tearing the swirl apart and breaking down the clear light such that there was no more majestic presence emerging!</p><p>“The material of the Flip Heaven Seal is many fragments of the real world of the last era during ancient times. It contains part of Celestial Sky-Supporting Mountain. When the era was destroyed, Heavenly Lord Yuanshi specially collected it and gave it to Heavenly Lord Guangcheng. Because it was too difficult to make, it wasn’t able to be a real magic weapon and could only rely on its own weight and specificity harm its enemy. But just this alone was already comparable to most peerless items,” Gu Xiaosang’s explanation rang in Meng Qi’s ears. Her tone was relaxed and she was slightly smiling without showing panic. It seemed like she knew the Luo Sect’s arrangement at her fingertips, had full confidence in Meng Qi, and had speculations about the changes.</p><p>So the Flip Heaven Seal wasn’t a Peerless Heavenly Weapon because its material was too strong, so such Heavenly Lord Guangcheng could not completely refine it.</p><p>Many fragments of the real world of the last era…</p><p>Coming to a sudden realization, Meng Qi gave up the preparation of activating the Wu’Ji Seal to its fullest and also the idea of recalling the Sea Calming Pearl to block the Celestial Creation Ambassador of the Luo Sect.</p><p>Heavenly Lord Guangcheng had awakened?</p><p>It seems that there’s a reason why Xiaosang chose to resurrect at the point of me attaining the Legendary realm…</p><p>After smashing the swirl and breaking the clear light, the Flip Heaven Seal flew up and immediately going to fall again, hitting at the four Celestial Ambassadors of Ceremony, Lamp, Vase, and Curtain Folding without any hesitation or mercy!</p><p>Seeing the Flip Heaven Seal approaching in a determined and murderous manner, wanting to crush himself and the other celestial ambassadors, the Celestial Ceremony Ambassador blurted out, “Guangchengzi, how dare you try to kill us?”</p><p>“You’re bullying the weak!”</p><p>His Celestial Creation Ambassador only tried to seize Su Meng without any killing intention, but this Guangchengzi was this unreasonable, trying to kill the four of them!</p><p>The Flip Heaven Seal paused for a while, giving off a bantering yet resolute voice:</p><p>“After the World of Deification, who doesn’t know that the Jade Mirage Palace is best at protecting our own people, seeking revenge for the smallest grievance, and bullying the weak!”</p><p>This… Meng Qi felt at a loss for words.</p><p>As the voice was being heard, the Flip Heaven Seal came crashing down, determined to kill!</p><p>The Wanderer Lamp lit up again, the vase overturned, the scepter flew, and the white lotuses formed a boundary. The four Celestial Ambassadors had used all powers but were smashed by the falling Flip Heaven Seal with its unstoppable momentum!</p><p>The power of the Heavenly Lord could be seen from here!</p><p>Just as Sha Wujing was being pressed down such that he could barely move but watch helplessly at the approaching Flip Heaven Seal, a golden cudgel suddenly appeared from the void in front of him, hitting the side of the Flip Heaven Seal and putting it to a stop.</p><p>At this very moment, a golden-haired giant hand appeared and grabbed Sha Wujing, dragging him out of the area covered by the Flip Heaven Seal.</p><p>“Senior!” Sha Wujing’s surprised voice echoed as he disappeared.</p><p>Grabbing this opportunity, the other three celestial ambassadors conveyed out of the isolated world and escaped.</p><p>As for Meng Qi, he was stunned by the words of Heavenly Lord Guangcheng. Also, he didn’t wish to anger the Ajati Matriarch for now, hence he didn’t stop them.</p><p>…</p><p>The beautiful picture of the mountains and river fell, and Gao Lan and the Heaven Conferring Platform had no more loopholes. The picture scroll had to be broken in order to take away or destroy the sacrificial altar.</p><p>And breaking the picture scroll was equivalent to directly fighting against the core of the real world and the territory of the twenty-seven states. Not to mention whether a Legendary or Creation realm character could completely break the foundation of this region, just the terrifying counter-force was enough to stop the supremes and powerful characters from doing anything rash.</p><p>More importantly, the collapse of the core of the real world brought about as a result was very likely to cause a chain reaction, causing the appearance of the end of an era that had not come during the fall of the Heavenly Court, and no one would have any more chance.</p><p>As all kinds of thoughts flashed through his mind, the Roc Demon King looked coldly at the majestic Heaven Conferring Platform and Gao Lan before giving a cold snort, “Is this the last reliance?”</p><p>“The picture of mountains and rivers isn’t unbreakable. As long as one state has taken over and the ruling is dispersed, the corresponding mountain and river would also disappear. After attacking Changle, you will have nothing else to rely on!”</p><p>Spreading his wings, he turned to look at the few demonic sages hiding in the dark and said in a deep voice, “Return to your own race, gather powerful experts, attack Zhou, and establish the Heavenly Court of the demonic race!”</p><p>The picture of mountains and rivers of the Heaven Conferring Platform relied on the authority of the emperor and corresponded to the various states of the territory. Once the jurisdiction did not belong to the Great Zhou Dynasty, it wouldn’t be able to resonate and connect completely. If there was only Changle left in the end, the picture of mountains and rivers could be easily broken!</p><p>Maitreya retrieved his palm and the Human Sack, and said smilingly, “Mister Gao, the Buddhist Kingdom will also be appearing on earth.”</p><p>With this, he and the two great Bodhisattvas, Fahualin and Damiaoxiang disappeared. The White Lotus Buddhist Kingdom that have been preparing for many years was about to stage an uprising!</p><p>At this moment, Shaoxuan and Xi’e seemed to be able to see war all around the Great Zhou, and smoke was everywhere.</p><p>If the two left the area of the Heaven Conferring Platform, they could just stop two or three demonic race sages, or maybe Fahualin and Damiaoxiang. But how were they able to stop strong enemies the level of Maitreya and the Roc Demon King?</p><p>…</p><p>The power from the Lifeless Heaven and Void Hometown disappeared, and Kunlun Mountain regained its quietness and tranquility. The frightened Daqinggen looked at the ancient seal in the sky and said in tears, “Master Guangcheng, I’ve finally waited for your return!”</p><p>The feeling was real and seemed to have no pretense.</p><p>Meng Qi looked up into the sky, and conveyed immediately to the real Jade Mirage Palace with ancient wells in front of it.</p><p>Passing through the darkness and numerous halls, he arrived at the Jade Pure Palace. Before he could step in, he saw the yellow door open, and the Flip Heaven Seal flew in.</p><p>After adjusting his clothes, Meng Qi walked into the main hall and saw prayer mats laid on the ground. On the front left sat a Taoist priest with a pale golden face and five long beards His hair and beard were all black, looking like a middle-aged man and showing an extraordinary disposition with the Flip Heaven Seal in his hands.</p><p>Meng Qi took a bow and said, “My greetings to you, Heavenly Lord.”</p><p>When he was adjusting his clothes earlier on, he had thought about how to address him, and which generation of Jade Mirage disciple was he himself considered to be?</p><p>If it was about the Principles of Karma, he was the most direct disciple of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi Tianzun, hence should be the second generation. But he also addressed the descendant of Jiang Ziya, Xiaobai, as his master’s junior, and Immortal Qingyuan Yang Jian had to call him senior. It was really difficult to judge his position, and he didn’t know how to address Guangchengzi.</p><p>And at this time, Gu Xiaosang seemed to be in hiding and gave no advice.</p><p>After thinking it through, Meng Qi decided to address him as Heavenly Lord, a title that did not involve seniority.</p><p>Guangchengzi was a true blue Heavenly Lord of Taoism, and there weren’t many with this title!</p><p>Even though one would be qualified to be called a Heavenly Lord after entering the Creation realm, but with Yuanshi, Daode, and Lingbao at the top, how would an ordinary Creation realm character dare to self proclaim this title?</p><p>Only those who had made great achievements or have great potential among the Creation characters, and had certain hope of achieving Nirvana could be considered as true Heavenly Lords of Taoism.</p><p>And Guangchengzi was one of them!</p><p>Guangchengzi also seemed to not know how ascertain Meng Qi’s seniority, hence he did not say much but pointed to one of the prayer mats, and smiled slightly, “Have a seat.”</p><p>Meng Qi walked over and sat down cross-legged. With a smile, he said “I didn’t expect you to have awakened so fast, Heavenly Lord.”</p><p>“I was already prepared before going into deep sleep. Moreover, I had only given out a little strength and arrived with the help of the Flip Heaven Seal. Hence, it is still not considered as my original body yet,” Guangchengzi said with a warm attitude before giving advice. “The Ajati Matriarch has quite a bit of connections with Jade Mirage, but is also an influential Nirvana character. It’s best not to fall out unless there’s no other choice.”</p><p>Meng Qi was a little stunned listening to him. Who was the one who was murderous and all out to kill just now?</p><p>Seeing him go blank, Guangchengzi snorted, “With the return of the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, would there be no one to save the Celestial Curtain Folding Ambassador?”</p><p>“This would not only amplify Jade Mirage’s protection of our own people and brazenness so that others would dare to deal with us anymore, but also not fall out with the Ajati Matriarch. It can be considered as having the best of both worlds.”</p><p>Fuck! Guangchengzi is so scheming… and he could say brazenness with such righteousness that even I cannot match! Meng Qi was a little speechless.</p><p>Before he could talk, he saw Guangchengzi look out of the hall, his expression slightly changed as he sighed, “After going through the trial and returning here, I wonder how many of my seniors and juniors are left…”</p><p>Meng Qi looked outside the door, and a thought suddenly struck him:</p><p>How many more are there who rushed over hearing the bell?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
