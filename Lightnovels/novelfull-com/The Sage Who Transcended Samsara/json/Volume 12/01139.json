Deep and quiet, it was like the vast starry sky, in addition to being obscure and mysterious as it changed constantly.</p><p>Using these changes, Meng Qi either created and threw out the Myriad World Talisman or split his consciousness to go through space. He did not enter himself as he had to control the formation of thousands of additional self imprints. If he had to enter the universe one by one, he wouldn’t be able to complete the accumulation of quantitative change to qualitative change in even five thousand years, let alone five to ten years.</p><p>As time went by, the quiet room remained dark throughout in eternal silence. One by one, the silhouettes of the additional self slowly formed and returned. There were projection images of the universe of the transformers that replaced and also assimilated the legendary additional selves of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi. There were also nameless sage warriors in front of the huge stone Buddha that formed the balance between Yuanshi and the Devil Buddha. But the number of these additional self imprints were still relatively small and far from being qualitatively altered. Meng Qi continued to spiritually travel to various worlds, playing different roles, displaying the Myriad World Talisman, creating the legendary adventures again and again.</p><p>Autumn had gone by and it was winter. One day, Daqinggen came to the quiet room and reported, “Master, Vertical Wing has sent a message saying that he has already contacted Little Fox, the Demonic Sage’s successor.”</p><p>Meng Qi slowly opened his eyes, inside them were illusory silhouettes that were either sphere agglomerates of red and black light or Brahmas sitting on a lotus platform. They overlapped one another, looking mythical and extraordinary. “What did the Demonic Sage’s successor say?”</p><p>His voice was low and indiscernible, as though it was from another universe. Daqinggen couldn’t help but become weak, like he was facing a primeval grand lord. Trembling, he said, “The Demonic Sage’s successor said that she would come to the Jade Mirage Palace to pay a visit.”</p><p>“Alright.” The mythical feeling in Meng Qi’s eyes disappeared and he let out a smile, “Seems like you’re doing well recently, your cooperation with Vertical Wing is quite good.”</p><p>Daqinggen laughed, “You’ve flattered me. I had only wanted to rip him off, but he ended up being very suitable as an anchor. Countless people watch him perform and speak, sigh, why are people these days so boring?”</p><p>He criticized the boring human beings as a plant, but the content in his tone could not be hidden.</p><p>Meng Qi didn’t say much more but nodded his head lightly, “Do give more pointers to Fei Zhengtao, he’s under the Jade Mirage Sect after all.”</p><p>“Don’t worry, master. He’s my direct disciple!” Daqinggen hit his chest with his branch as he gave his promise.</p><p>He still needed his disciple’s guidance to clear the levels in his game!</p><p>When there were more people who liked playing games, he would get his disciple to do a live broadcast of playing games and use this to make money!</p><p>…</p><p>At the foot of Kunlun Mountain, the place had gradually developed into a sizeable city due to the existence of the Jade Mirage Palace and the Primitive Emperor. There were some who hoped to get a feel of celestial air, some who wished to get the bits and pieces that flowed out from the Primitive Emperor’s fingers, some who were waiting for the opportunity when the Jade Mirage Palace recruited disciples. There were also people who cultivated fields of exotic plants so that they could give them names like Kunlun Mountain Lingzhi and Jade Mirage Palace Ginseng, etc., when they sell them in the city. They would look like celestial goods and could fetch a good price!</p><p>On this day, a normal-looking horse carriage entered the city. Its door and windows were covered by a strange white veil, making it difficult for others to see what was inside.</p><p>The inside of the carriage was covered with thick carpet and had gorgeous furnishings. A man and a woman were sitting in it. The woman was wearing a fiery red dress, her lips slightly pouting, as though she was born this way with natural lure. In contrast, her eyes were clean and clear, and the two intertwined with extraordinary charm. Together with a pretty face, she was like a nine-tailed fox in legends. As for the man, he was white-haired and had a scholarly disposition. His dressing was like that of a servant, and he was serving the young lady with his heart and soul.</p><p>Through the white veil, the young lady saw experts on iron birds approaching and also the hundred-foot tall Tower of Reaching the Stars. It was said that many people could live in it and that it could accommodate many shops. The pedestrians were in a hurry, but their expressions were all filled with hope, making the entire city feel vibrant.</p><p>“Uncle Wen, when we entered the human kingdom the previous time, it was still an unchanged scene. But now, it is totally different, with a dramatic change,” the young lady was the Demonic Sage’s successor, the Queen Mother of the West in legends, and the young mistress of the Green Hill’s fox clan.</p><p>Uncle Wen laughed, “It’s very consistent with the record of the Middle Ages. The Palace of Mohism is good at doing these things, but they are all emphasized on exquisiteness and focused on enjoyment and convenience. It would be enviable during peacetime. But now that the calamity is coming, the mighty people will be waking up and such prosperity is just an illusion. The celestial path and martial arts practice is the correct principle.”</p><p>“That is true, but most people wouldn’t be able to live that many years even without the calamity. They will turn into ashes one day, so they just enjoy while they can.” the Little Fox said sentimentally, lamenting at the shortness of life and the rareness of eternity.</p><p>“That’s why we should practice hard to increase our life, otherwise many life-extending items would be of no use,” Uncle Wen’s viewpoint remained unchanged.</p><p>The horse carriage slowly passed through the street and went past many platforms for martial contest. They were laid with magical powers and many people of the pugilistic world were exchanging blows and learning from one another. It was lively and bustling with noise.</p><p>The Little Fox smiled, “Uncle Wen, what about this?”</p><p>“When living things gather together, it is inevitable for them to fight for fame. After the formation of the Myriad World, the links between the human race strengthened and such practice became more dominant, resulting in martial arts meetings everywhere with people fighting for ranking. Even if they failed, they could still show their faces in the live broadcast to increase their fame. Moreover, conflicts are unavoidable in forums and martial arts exchange groups, hence there are always fights arranged at different places, resulting in an increase in such platforms for martial arts contests.”</p><p>She seemed to be no stranger to the Myriad World, and might had been trolling long term using a sock puppet.</p><p>Uncle Wen’s face looked a little serious, “The improvement in martial arts practice is indeed worthy of our attention.”</p><p>The horse carriage passed through the street and headed for another city gate where the foot of Kunlun Mountain was.</p><p>At this moment, the Little Fox saw two men arguing by the roadside.</p><p>“Brother Miao, how could you give up a bright future and do such illusory things?” The man in swordsmen attire shouted.</p><p>The man addressed as Brother Miao who was dressed like a Confucian scholar said agitatedly, “Brother Wu, you don’t understand the meaning of this and its great value.”</p><p>“I really don’t!” Brother Wu shook his head, “Didn’t you just buy a manual on virtual reality from the city and then become as though you’re possessed by a demon. You’ve become slack in your practice and even forgone the opportunity to get into a powerhouse. You have destroyed a bright future that was easily obtainable!”</p><p>Brother Miao signaled Brother Wu to calm down, “Think about it, if I could build a virtual reality platform for martial contests based on the Myriad World, wouldn’t practitioners from all over the world be able to learn from one another directly? And there’s no need to be afraid of death. Virtual demons and monsters could also be created and through their battles, data, and experience could be accumulated. And if we meet them in the future, it would be easy to fight them!”</p><p>“Is this not important to a martial arts practitioner?”</p><p>“This would enable most practitioners to quickly improve their real combat experience!”</p><p>Brother Wu was also an expert with extraordinary swordsmanship. He understood the meaning of this matter after listening, but still said in a deep voice, “What about yourself? This thing may take years to complete, are you going to neglect your martial arts practice because of this?”</p><p>“Firstly, I will try to join the Palace of Mohism. Secondly…” Brother Miao paused, “Everyone has their own pursuits. Not everyone is as devout in martial arts. Maybe I wouldn’t be extraordinary because of it and I can’t live a few hundred years, but everyone will die one day. I just want to live this life to the fullest, like a meteor across the sky. Even if it is just a fleeting moment, it is still a moment that illuminates the night.”</p><p>Brother Wu looked at the Brother Miao in front of him, as though he had just known him today.</p><p>The Little Fox inside the carriage rubbed her cheek while the face of Uncle Wu beside her turned solemn, “Using virtual reality to increase martial arts experience? We have to pay attention to this person!”</p><p>“With the Myriad World, the human race has really changed dramatically!”</p><p>He also let out a sigh like the Little Fox.</p><p>The carriage left the city and traveled along the mountain road before arriving at a small Taoist temple in the clouds. Before the two demons got off, they already saw a green plant waiting at the door and said smilingly, “Master has instructed me to welcome you.”</p><p>The Little Fox hid her young and ignorant attitude and changed to an indifferent expression before saying coldly, “Thank you.”</p><p>They followed Daqinggen into the Jade Mirage Palace. After bypassing the wall and passing through the courtyard, they arrived at the main hall and saw a statue of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi standing inside. It was magnificent, sacred and solemn. Below the Yuanshi statue was a green-robed priest sitting cross-legged. The starry sky was hidden all around him, dark and illusory. He was as solemn and deep as a celestial statue.</p><p>He has actually attained such a level… the Little Fox looked down and bowed, “My respect to you, Primitive Emperor.”</p><p>Uncle Wen almost lost himself and quickly followed with a bow.</p><p>Meng Qi slowly opened his mouth, “You should know what I want.”</p><p>The Little Fox nodded and said, “We do have a lot of information on Ananda’s additional self, but we need some help from you.”</p><p>“What kind of help?” Meng Qi cast his gaze on her face.</p><p>After a moment of silence, the Little Fox hesitated no more and said directly, “Go to Spirited Mountain together and save the remaining Great Sages!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
