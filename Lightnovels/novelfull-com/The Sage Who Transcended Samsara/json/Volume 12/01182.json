Someone will attack from far to disrupt him?</p><p>Shaoxuan and Xi’e felt like they saw a bizarre and absurd story. To them, although Maitreya has not reached the supreme stage as stated in the legends, but since he was able to appear while regaining the strength and power of Ancient Great Mediums, it could be said that Maitreya was a far more dangerous existence than the Bull Demon King who had regained the Creation Realm. Maitreya has totally exceeded the Bull Demon King in the aspects of experience, skill, or even Heavenly and Magic Weapons. Furthermore, he destroyed all types of illusions, and his way of cultivation was above the Bull Demon King’s. Otherwise, Gautama Buddha and Amitabha would not have appointed him as the future leader of the Buddhist Society. With the status of Maha Bodhisattva, he was commonly known as the East Gautama Buddha.</p><p>Even the Bull Demon King was nothing like Maitreya, not to mention the Dragon Demon King and Roc Demon King, who were the remnants of the Great Sages sealed in Spirited Mountain years ago.</p><p>Although the demon race had the advantage of numbers, they should not ignore the tremendous strength of the Maitreyas. There were some legends such as Fahualin and Damiao within the Buddhist Nation, aside from numerous Bodhisattvas and Luohans that had the ability to form the Thousand Buddha Formation and enchantments.</p><p>The Primitive Emperor needed to be in the center to show consideration on both sides. As he continuously launched the power of the four Fairy-Slaying Swords, he was unable to focus his power in the battle against the Bull Demon King. Before His Majesty arrives, what should he do to control and slow down Maitreya?</p><p>Many doubts emerged from the hearts of Shaoxuan and Xi’e. However, when they looked up at the Heaven Conferring Platform, Meng Qi seemed calm and relaxed. After ruminating many times over the matter, they chose to trust and accept.</p><p>“We will depart to the western region immediately!” both of them declared in unison.</p><p>“Very well!” the expression of Meng Qi turned solemn. In a deep voice, he said, “Please accept the decree, my seniors!”</p><p>With Meng Qi’s finger stretched out, the four Fairy-Slaying Swords released their power of swords from the eye of the formation, forming several pieces of chaotic colored decrees. Two of the decrees flew out, and fell toward the direction of Shaoxuan and Xi’e.</p><p>Solemnly, Shaoxuan and Xi’e responded, “We accept the Symbol of the Primitive Emperor!”</p><p>Whoever was equipped with the decrees would not be disrupted by the sword formation, and will be equal to half of its master. They would effectively be everywhere within the formation. They could continuously intimidate or disrupt the demon race from dispersing their forces, forcing them not to attack abruptly. Moreover, it was necessary for the demon race to build up their tactical formation at the central city of their region, which enabled them to return if the region was invaded. Or else, the areas they conquered would be recovered by enemies after attacking the next area.</p><p>Also, it would take an extremely long time for the tactical formation to be constructed.</p><p>Bringing the Last Ship along with the decrees, the two mighty Terrans stepped out from the Heaven Conferring Platform and directly appeared on the Western Fairy-Slaying Gateway!</p><p>At the same time, Meng Qi, being the cardinal of the sword formation, delivered the Symbol of the Primitive Emperor to Mister Lu Da, Su Wuming, and Jiang Zhiwei. He allowed the Dharmakaya that were below celestial transcendents to rest. Because even if they were equipped with the power of the sword formation, or aided by legendary weapons, the mighty people of the Legendary realm were still too much for them.</p><p>As for Jiang Zhiwei, Su Wuming, and Mister Lu Da, if the legendary Invincible Blade did not awaken in them, they would not have obtained the Time Blade. In that case, even when the mighty people were partially restricted by the Fairy-Slaying Sword Formation, the three would be no match for any of them.</p><p>This was the difference between a Legendary and a Celestial Being, a huge difference that was nearly impossible to close. As the strongest Celestial Transcendent in the past, during that time, although he held the legendary Invincible Blade, he only managed to keep his own life safe.</p><p>During the Middle Ages, if it wasn’t because of the awakening of the Ancient Book in the Legendary realm, no matter how the Earlier Saints approached the Legendary threshold, have extraordinary talents, or even by outnumbering its owners, they were no match for the Overlord Blade.</p><p>But for now, all the kingdoms were united, and everything changed.</p><p>…</p><p>Above the vast desert, the sky and land joined as one by the power of the Fairy-Slaying Sword, then the powers of the swords interlaced with one another, materializing into a green gate.</p><p>Unfortunately, the cardinal of the sword formation was connected with the Heaven Conferring Platform. Since the region was protected by mountains and rivers, the only strategy was just to attack steadily. The Bull Demon King moved, returning to the front of the ranks of the demons, and he foamed.</p><p>The Little Fox Qingqiu, caressing the shaft of the Demon Divine Spear, said in a deep voice, “That’s the only choice we have.”</p><p>The Roc Demon King and Dragon Demon King were not fazed. Instead, this had ignited their will to battle. Their desire was to let the Terrans understand that tricks and deceits were useless against them. The capability would prevail all of the conspiracies and the restriction of the tactical formations.</p><p>Let me lead the battle! The Bull Demon King growled and took his step. With a step, he strode into the Fairy-Slaying Gateway.</p><p>The Green Celestial Sword vibrated slightly, rays of sword beams fell all around. The pace seemed to have slowed down, as if the universe was submerged in a swamp.</p><p>The Bull Demon King held an iron rod at his back. Hot vapor arose from his head, forming a horn-shaped tower. With his head up, he howled and locked off the sword power, leaving some inconspicuous marks on his body.</p><p>Since the Bull Demon King had blocked the sword power, the Dragon Demon King, the Roc Demon King, and Qingqiu the Fox entered the Fairy-Slaying Gateway one after another. Then, they saw that there was a large ship in front of them. At each side of the bow was Shaoxuan and Xi’e, respectively.</p><p>Hahaha! The Bull Demon King laughed sardonically. He pointed the Iron Rod toward the Terrans and said, “Are there only two of you? You think this can stop me?”</p><p>In the primordial era, the Bull Demon King was an overlord that ruled over all demons in the universe. Even the mighty Sun Wukong would acknowledge him as elder brother. Moreover, in order to arrest him, how great were the forces sent by the Heavenly Court? And how many heads of his did the great gods from the Three Sea Worlds cut off?</p><p>Although he was now considered defeated, and was being restricted by the Sword Formation, only two Legendary figures with limited ability would not be enough to stop him!</p><p>In between his laughter, the Bull Demon King leaped, moving swiftly.</p><p>Just then, a thought emerged in the Bull Demon King’s mind and he glanced to the side. In his vicinity there was a good-looking young person who looked familiar. He had Flaming Wheels under his feet and a Fire-tipped Spear on his back. He smiled brilliantly, and exclaimed, “Long time no see!”</p><p>…</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei kept the Invincible Blade in her acupuncture points. She captured the blade’s spirit and focused it into a sword beam. After that, she rested above the State of the South. Nobody could halt her at that moment.</p><p>With the Myriad World Talisman tied at her wrist, images entered her eyes, and voices went into her ears.</p><p>The constables and secret agents of Yamen, which were in different states of the South, have initiated their action. Silently, they viewed and checked their surroundings, kept the crucial regions in their sight while perceiving the situation of other areas by discussing among themselves.</p><p>Then, they reported to Jiang Zhiwei.</p><p>“There was nothing strange at Ning Wu.”</p><p>“Same in Jiu Luo.”</p><p>…</p><p>Patiently, Jiang Zhiwei waited for the latest updates. Finally, there was news.</p><p>The Luo Sect was making trouble at Zhou Cheng, they were working with the insiders!</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei disappeared, and arrived at Zhou Cheng.</p><p>…</p><p>Mister Lu Da and Su Wuming climbed up Jade Emperor Mountain. They met with the leader of the Xuantian Sect, he was at the brink of becoming a Dharmakaya.</p><p>“Dear seniors, the Xuantian Sect was always concerned about the matters of righteousness, and was willing to lend a helping hand whenever needed. However, now, the Time Blade has only awakened to the stage of Celestial Transcendent, perhaps it might be futile in the battle,” the sect leader said with a rueful smile.</p><p>Indeed, even the Xuantian Sect could not be certain of the Time Blade since it has always been extremely mysterious.</p><p>Is the Time Blade still at the rank of a Celestial Transcendent? Mister Lu Da and Su Wuming looked at each other.</p><p>…</p><p>Maitreya returned to the congregation of Bodhisattva and Buddha, and the white stage beneath him broadened abruptly, shrouding the Azure stones. He flew into Jiangdong, near the state capital. His followers, regardless of where they were, sensed the excitement. All of them recited the honour of Maitreya, their future Gautama Buddha.</p><p>All of a sudden, their chants were reverberating from all around, Namo Savior Maitreya!</p><p>As their chants echoed, Maitreya answered with his appearance. The azure stones fell before many of the believers, turning into golden Buddha statues with amiable smiles.</p><p>The enchantment was constructed, the restricted spell around the cities faded one by one while the vitality of all living things in the area fell tremendously.</p><p>Above the splendid mountains, the Donghai region diminished gradually, and finally disappeared!</p><p>In front of Maitreya, the four-colored sword beams appeared.</p><p>At the same time, an auspicious cloud popped up from the top of Meng Qi’s head. It transformed into a good looking monk. The monk recited the honor of the Moonlight Bodhisattva softly, and immediately entered into the Eastern Pure Land of Azure Stones.</p><p>Meng Qi laid an eye on the Moonlight Bodhisattva, and he went straight to the point, “Honored Bodhisattva, may I know where Bhaisajyaguru is?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
