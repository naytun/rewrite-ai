There were only a few who could barely withstand, and all the prosperity and future would be cut off.</p><p>Even a mighty person who had just entered the Legendary realm could do it, let alone the Great Sages who dominated during ancient times?</p><p>Why did he take the risk to obtain information and made every effort to create the additional self imprints? It was to self-attain the Legendary realm before the Legendary mighty people returned, so as to protect the important people and things. If he let the Great Sages escape in advance, wouldn’t the order be reversed and his method and goal would be contradicting?</p><p>But thinking about it from another angle, Meng Qi already felt his heart heavy. Wasn’t the unspoken meaning of the Demonic Sage’s successor putting up this request the fact that they had reached an agreement with the Luo Sect, paid a price, accepted some restrictions and gotten the way to enter Spirited Mountain?</p><p>Without him, they could still find other experts to work with!</p><p>Everything had been prepared for entering the Spirited Mountain to save the Great Sages and finding him was only icing on the cake. Whether he rejected or not seemed irrelevant?</p><p>Meng Qi’s expression remained unchanged, maintaining the shrewdness of the head of Kunlun Mountain Jade Mirage Palace and the imposing manner of a celestial being, as he said with indifference, “Enter Spirited Mountain? You’ve gotten what you wanted from the Luo Sect?”</p><p>The Demonic Sage’s successor lightly nodded and said with slight arrogance, “Yes.”</p><p>Her reply was simple and concise without any explanation, obviously not wanting outsiders to know the price the demonic race had paid for it.</p><p>“The demonic race is scattered all over the world. After hiding your talents for years, you have dealings with one another after the Demon King’s palace opened its door. You have a large pool of talents now, why do you need my help?” Meng Qi sat on a low bed, his voice like a floating cloud.</p><p>Without moving her eyes, the Little Fox said calmly, “Other demons may not know, but I’m fully aware that you are at the top in today’s world. Danger is everywhere in Spirited Mountain, our success rate would increase by at least thirty percent with your help. It’s worth taking this risk to save the Great Sages.”</p><p>She seemed to know that it was a tie between the Primitive Emperor and the Tyrant in the battle of the strongest celestial being in the palace of the Demonic King. He was indeed at the top in today’s world!</p><p>“Aren’t you afraid that I might make trouble and ruin saving the Great Sages?” Meng Qi asked without hesitation, his surroundings floating with darkness like descending auspicious clouds.</p><p>The Little Fox pressed her lips into a charming smile, “I believe you would make a correct judgement at a critical juncture.”</p><p>Hmm, does this mean that Spirited Mountain would surely change my initial thoughts? Or believe that my ruining is of no avail? Meng Qi was quite puzzled, thoughts ran through his mind.</p><p>The demonic race and the Luo Sect had already come to an agreement and had to take action. If he participated, he could still act accordingly and ruin things or figure out how the Luo Sect could benefit. If he rejected, he could only wait for news and wouldn’t be able to control whether the news was good or bad.</p><p>There was no need to say anymore on what he should do.</p><p>With both his hands displaying a mudra sign and placed on his knees, Meng Qi said indifferently, “Alright, I shall follow you to Spirited Mountain to have a look.”</p><p>Who knows, he might even be able to find the Nether Skeleton again and use it as material for future heavenly weapon creation or the core of the Jade Mirage Palace’s mountain-guarding formation.</p><p>“Thank you very much, Primitive Emperor,” the Little Fox toned down her smile and gave a reserved bow.</p><p>“How should I address you?” Meng Qi asked casually.</p><p>The Little Fox slightly curled up the corner of her mouth and showed her dimples, “I’ve stopped using my previous name. After becoming the head of the fox clan of Green Hill, I’m known as Qingqiu.”</p><p>“Head of the fox clan of Green Hill?” Meng Qi regurgitated, another nine-tailed fox spontaneously came to his mind – one whose abilities were above Qingqiu and of the celestial level.</p><p>Did Su Daji return to the future, or is she facing the Buddha statue in the pure land in the east or even already passed on?</p><p>Inside the quiet room, the oil lamp swayed and illuminated the silhouette of the Little Fox like a dream. But Meng Qi sighed to himself, the success rate would increase by at least thirty percent with my help?</p><p>You’re really too innocent and naive, don’t you know that I’m an expert in causing trouble and accidents?</p><p>With my participation, this trip is guaranteed to be full of changes, twists and turns, and unpredictable results…</p><p>…</p><p>On the arranged date, Meng Qi wiped off the accumulated dust and arrived at Donghai in a green robe. His gray temples remained and his disposition was like an ancient well with no ripples.</p><p>After passing through the eye of the sea and arriving at the Demonic King’s palace, he saw the Little Fox Qingqiu waiting outside with her hands behind her back. Her dress was now white instead of red, like an unearthly spirit with slight honor and disdain in ruling the world.</p><p>“Master Su, you will meet powerful demonic deities from the Heaven of No Return, the Heaven of Illusion, and the Heaven of Demons who have never stepped into the real world before. As long as you follow me, stay quiet, and not show your powers, they will not take notice,” Qingqiu said as she led Meng Qi into the Demonic King’s palace.</p><p>After reaching a cooperation, she changed her address from Primitive Emperor to Master Su.</p><p>The Heaven of No Return, the Heaven of Illusion, the Heaven of Demons? That is to say, when the heavens collapsed and the Sea Calming Pearl fell, the demonic race had gotten at least three of them? Meng Qi pondered as he followed. His dark green robe made him look like an elder who had experienced the washing of time, one who looked ordinary but was actually unpredictable.</p><p>The Demonic King’s palace was in a semi-sealed state before the main gate opened. The demonic race was unable to enter the main hall to get the treasures or come and go between the various realms through the Demonic King’s palace. They could only enter to get the corresponding sage’s inheritance or hide from disaster. It was only after Taili and Qingqiu came to the world of gods with the help of the Master of Six Dao of Samsara and opened the main gate that the Demonic Sage’s palace recovered its basic abilities of time, void and spirit that it could connect with the various realms.</p><p>Taili and the others then gradually contacted the demonic race in the west and those hiding in the various heavens. They all had different standpoints and refused to give in to another, which was the main reason why they didn’t create a disturbance in the real world.</p><p>Of course, after the Demonic King’s palace recovered, linking the past and the future and the powers of the various worlds, Qingqiu and Taili didn’t return to the Middle Ages like what they had hoped for. This was because they had no control over the Demonic King’s palace and had to depend on the other party’s mood. Similarly, even if different demonic races of the Middle Ages and current era entered the Demonic King’s palace together, it all depended on the thinking of the Demonic King’s palace whether they would meet. They might have their silhouettes overlapping one another and not able to detect the existence of the other party!</p><p>Powerful demon deities? How powerful could they be? With his hands behind his back, Meng Qi slowly walked forward as he followed Qingqiu into the first hall.</p><p>The scene here was completely different from the scene when he fought against the Tyrant. There were more than a dozen doors on the four sides of the main hall, and also rows of lights. Every candle was made to look like a hand mending the sky, emitting an ancient and obscure air.</p><p>At this moment, a creaking sound came from the other side of the main hall. A burning and awe-inspiring air blew over.</p><p>Meng Qi stood in a composed manner with his hands behind him as he looked over, following the Little Fox. A tall purple-red silhouette walked out from the side door, her neck long and beautiful like a swan. Her disposition was vibrant, with a sense of holiness and also a burning intent. Different parts of her body seem to be made up of different stars.</p><p>“The Heaven of Illusion’s powerful demon deity, Glow, descendant of the Phoenix, five virtues on her body and only a step away from the Legendary realm. Even a proud peacock like Taili admitted to being much inferior than her,” Qingqiu sent a message to Meng Qi to help him introduce them.</p><p>Five virtues on her body, nine fires burning? Meng Qi nodded lightly and toned down his manner as he looked at Glow.</p><p>Graceful and poised, Glow’s gaze swept past Meng Qi and landed on Qingqiu’s face. Her voice was like the most beautiful celestial music, “You’ve gotten a human to help?”</p><p>“There can be traitors in the demonic race, so can there be trustworthy people in the human race,” Qingqiu replied calmly.</p><p>Glow stopped paying attention to Meng Qi and smiled at Qingqiu, “Spirited Mountain is extremely dangerous. Even if you have the Demon Divine Spear, you are just at the level of a novice demonic deity, why do you want to take the risk?”</p><p>Meng Qi came to a sudden realization hearing this. As a phoenix descendant, it was obvious that Glow looked down on Qingqiu and wanted to fight for the position of the Demonic Sage’s successor.</p><p>He watched this scene with a smile, like he was an onlooker. Glow did not care about his existence as she didn’t know about the Primitive Emperor Su Meng. She only treated him as a human race celestial being with powers that were considered not too bad.</p><p>Qingqiu held her chin slightly up, “There’s no need for you to worry. Destiny determines whether I’ll be dead or alive at Spirited Mountain. If I die there, the Demon Divine Spear will have another owner.”</p><p>Right after she finished, another door opened. A medium-sized male demonic deity with overbearing holiness stepped in.</p><p>This demon was wearing gold armor and a phoenix-winged crown and had pale yellow hair. His features were flawless and he had an imposing manner like he was a dictator.</p><p>“The Heaven of Demon’s powerful demon deity, Raka, descendant of Kirin, a celestial beast, overbearing and not inferior to Glow,” Qingqiu introduced silently.</p><p>Raka swept his gaze and went past Meng Qi whom he didn’t care about. He only nodded slightly at Qingqiu and Glow as a form of greeting before walking to the side, looking extremely solitary.</p><p>There was another creak and a mighty nine-foot tall demonic deity walked in. He was wearing a black long robe, his skin was dark, his mouth was big, and his body was full of explosive power.</p><p>“This is the Heaven of No Return’s powerful demon deity, No Thoughts, he’s not a descendant of the Great Roc, having only a weak trace in his blood, but he finally gotten the real body of the Great Roc with his hard work and encounters. He can swallow everything and has terrifying strength,” Qingqiu had some hidden fear for No Thoughts.</p><p>No Thoughts slowly stepped in and gave a bright smile as he looked at Glow, Qingqiu, and the other demons, “Everyone’s early huh, let me get things straight first, after entering Spirited Mountain, the Golden Cudgel is mine!”</p><p>Tsk, he’s really impolite towards the Demon Sage’s successor… Meng Qi, who was ignored, watched on with interest.</p><p>Right at this moment, the five-colored hair peacock demon deity Taili came out from the back of the hall. Red, green, yellow, white, and black lights shook lightly behind him, his power had obviously leveled up and was equivalent to a human race celestial being.</p><p>His eyes swept across the various demons as he showed his arrogance. Although his power and level were lacking, but with the Holy Light of Five Colors, he wasn’t afraid of the kirin demonic deity Raka or the Great Roc demonic deity No Thoughts but just wary of the phoenix demonic deity Glow.</p><p>Then, he saw Meng Qi. He was first shocked, and when their visions touched, he suddenly stopped. He felt that the other party’s eyes were really like that of chaos, and his mind was almost unable to pull out of it!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
