The dry bodhi swayed behind gently as hundreds of millions of the Vaiduryanirbhasa which survived many incidents quaked slightly. His voice was solemn yet magnificent,</p><p>“In the future.”</p><p>In the future? Meng Qi thought of many answers but none of them were related with that. This was completely unexpected.</p><p>At the same time, he knew that the Time Blade had not awakened to the Legendary level. His deity was slightly confused but he could not think much. He intended to run the Principles of Karma before borrowing the treasure from his senior brothers and giving them to Mister Lu Da and Su Wuming.</p><p>…</p><p>“The Time Blade has only reached the Transcendent level. I think it’s time to find another legendary item…” Mister Lu Da was focused on thinking where could he borrow a heavenly weapon which was comparable to the great power.</p><p>Buddy Su went all in with his skills. The Fairy Slaying Four Sword Formation and the Sea Calming Pearl were used to repress the vast sea. He had nothing else in his pocket.</p><p>He knew that Meng Qi could get the support from mighty people and the great gods this time and it was still possible for him to borrow the legendary item. However, he was not used to relying on others. It would be great if Meng Qi could borrow it but if not, he would think for solutions ahead of time first.</p><p>The body of Su Wuming looked empty and his eyes were deep and indifferent as before. After a moment of silence, he stated, “If we combine our legendary characteristics now, the realm would be boundlessly close to the Legendary realm. Even if our strengths are inferior, we could still delay for a bit under the situation if it is limited by the formation.”</p><p>“How do we combine them? Fusion of the two swords? That would be superficial,” Mister Lu Da knew that Su Wuming would never talk about nonsense. There must be a reason for him to suggest that.</p><p>Su Wuming said in a faint tone, “I learned a secret spell for Amalgamation when I had my Spiritual Wander to the Myriad World to enlighten my reflected self. If we use it now, a power exceeding the simple combination of strengths by the two will be erupted.”</p><p>“A secret spell for Amalgamation? Which universe is it from?” Mister Lu Da asked in surprise.</p><p>…</p><p>Su Wuming thought for a while and said, “There was a Dragon Beads Relic there. If all seven beads are collected, a dragon can be summoned and a certain wish can be fulfilled.”</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei reached Zhou Cheng of the state of the South with the Sword of Sun-Crossing Fogbow in her hand. She looked domineering with the brilliant purple lights embracing the sword body.</p><p>At that moment, Restrictive Spell Nodes in the city moat were damaged and white lotuses were scattered all over the streets. They seemed like connecting together into an enchantment to summon some power from the Void Hometown, causing the moat to be difficult to open. Not far from there, Oracles who held ancient books and recordings, Oracles who held glaze lamps, and Oracles who did mudra were going to cross the city walls.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei pointed with her long sword lightly and purple electricity sword beams emerged in every corner of the city and struck every Luo Sect member who was causing trouble in there.</p><p>The city regained its peace with just one sword.</p><p>It could be due to the ubiquitous technique and power of Spreading Dao to the Universe!</p><p>She had obtained her Dharmakaya status for not more than ten years. She reached the transcendent level after witnessing Meng Qi in obtaining the Legendary vision and she would be able to make breakthroughs in another one or two years. With the support from the transfer of power from different universes from the many reflected self from her compromise without enlightenment, not to forget that she had more legendary features than Su Wuming, she had the strength of a new Celestial Being and she could be treated as a Transcendent during combat. Since she had the weakening and restriction from the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation, with the borrowed power and Invincible Blade Realm, there was still a high possibility to block off a Legendary person who awakened earlier.</p><p>As for the other two, their ubiquitous were not fake. They were waiting for Mister Lu Da’s aid.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei’s speed in advancing was fast and she surpassed Su Wuming and Meng Qi. However, that was how it should be. In the past, Su Wuming had his breakthrough earlier than expected in an urgent situation as he had not accomplished all his skills. Unlike Su Wuming, she had completed her basics. As for Meng Qi, due to his unique status as premier true form, he needed dozens more of the Water Mill Kungfu skills to shape the form of the multiverse before he advance from Earth fairy to a Celestial Being. For example, he opened up every acupuncture points in his whole body into a Universe and sublimating his internal organs into Heavens. His reliance on all kinds of opportunities reduced the delay of time he took to enter the Celestial realm.</p><p>One sword brought peace to the city. The City Guarding Formation was finally activated and the light of Living Beings burst on time. The Celestial Ceremony Ambassador was blocked outside.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei was floating in the air with her yellow dress. Her long sword shone with purple light as she attacked with her sword everywhere. The Celestial Lamp Ambassador looked at her, she looked more like a Legendary mighty person compared to him. Without any slightest contempt, the glaze lamp he was holding bloomed with Light of Limitless. It illuminated through the hurricane and stratosphere, shrouding half the sky.</p><p>Without any obstacle, even if its strength was weakened, the City Guarding Formation could still be destroyed with one blow!</p><p>There seemed to be lights shining through the realms, there were no darkness nor demons. However, Jiang Zhiwei was nowhere to be found in the light.</p><p>A purple sword beam seemed to be descending from infinity right after that and attacked the three gods at the same time. It shrouded the three gods as if there was no distance between them and they were only three repetitive dots.</p><p>The Celestial Ceremony Ambassador gave out a wry smile in his heart. He always used the ubiquitous technique to crush those who did not achieve Legendary level. He did not expect to experience similar treatment on that day.</p><p>Just like lightning, the sword beams contained a strong and arrogant sense as if they were communicating with the God of Thunder from many worlds and basic power. The gods dared not ignore it.</p><p>Hmph!</p><p>The Celestial Vase Ambassador snorted and pushed forward with his palm. A mighty and freezing power rushed out, drowning in all directions, dispelling the purple electricity sword beams.</p><p>He was breaking the power by force!</p><p>…</p><p>Sitting on the Heaven Conferring Platform and sensing the changes in the various battles, Meng Qi had a faint expression like a God Master Buddha looking at the River of Time. However, after listening to the conversation between Mister Lu Da and Su Wuming, he gagged a little and could not close his mouth.</p><p>Then, he watched them practice the secret spell, watched them master it quickly with a funny posture of touching each other via their fingers, their usual graceful demeanor totally ruined. He also watched a radiant light flashing before a handsome young man with silver hair appeared. His eyes were deep yet indifferent, his breath was deep yet intimidating. He muttered,</p><p>“I am Lu Wuming.”</p><p>There was only one thought reverberating madly in Meng Qi’s mind at that point.</p><p>What the fuck? Fine, I’ll take it.</p><p>Taking in a deep breath, he stood up slowly. He rotated the Principles of Karma and said aloud,</p><p>“In the name of the Teacher of Jade Palace, I hope that Senior Sister Manjushri Guangfa would lend me the heavenly magic weapon!”</p><p>The void cracked open and a slender and feminine hand was seen. A long sword flew over as if it contained all the knowledge in the world. Compared to it, Meng Qi’s Alaya sword looked ordinary like dust on the ground.</p><p>It was the Great Wisdom Sword!</p><p>Meng Qi held the sword’s hilt, thanked his senior sister and closed his eyes. He could not bear to look at the Great Wisdom Sword being sent away in the air for Lu Wuming.</p><p>Extending his hand to catch the sword, Lu Wuming with his indifferent gaze disappeared suddenly. He immediately appeared in the sky of Zhou Cheng in the state of South. Darkness surrounded him as if many universes were connected and linked to the magnificent galaxy.</p><p>…</p><p>Maitreya moved slowly. However, he would disintegrate the local Restrictive Spells and accumulate Forces of Living Beings by response of Sambhogakaya everywhere he went.</p><p>He wanted to be quick. However, once there was a suppressing sword formation and Su Meng’s interception in putting a stop to it, he would have a mild feeling in his heart. He was unsure whether it was good or bad feeling so he chose to go steadily.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
