A dark whirlpool was sinking and the borderless Sea of Sufferings was formed. Light rays were floating above the ocean, depicting all kinds of beauty. It was motivating, quiet, and so much like home.</p><p>While at the suffering ocean, pale horrifying arms extended out in the dark whirlpool, trying to pull the immortals who tried to cross the Sea of Sufferings deep into the sea, letting them sink forever and never to be released. They could only achieve redemption if they believed in the Ajati Matriarch.</p><p>Forthcoming Sutra of the Ajati Matriarch is the Precious Raft for people who are crossing the Sea of Sufferings!</p><p>People who believe in me will live, and the non-believers will perish!</p><p>Facing the borderless Sea of Sufferings, Meng Qi could not help but feel that he could never escape, as if he had experienced in advance the feeling of the Creation Realm at the Legendary Realm, which was the despair of the endless Sea of Sufferings and traceless Nirvana Realm.</p><p>What a good Celestial Ceremony Ambassador, what a good Forthcoming Sutra of the Ajati Matriarch!</p><p>At this time, Gu Xiaosang’s shy voice came from inside the body of Meng Qi, “Father, even when the hands are holding the Forthcoming Sutra, if one hasn’t reached the Creation Realm and see the Sea of Sufferings, what virtues or abilities does the Feng Dian have to make people sink? It’s only a bluff half-true, with the help of the Principle of Nature of Heaven and Earth.”</p><p>With the experiences and knowledge of the Golden Emperor, the Luo Sect’s tricks were no secret at all in her eyes.</p><p>Actually, your name is more persuasive than the Sea of Sufferings of Feng Dian… Meng Qi spoke in his heart and already knew what he should do next. He then stood up before the eyes of the four, Feng Dian, Celestial Vase, Celestial Lamp. and Celestial Curtain Folding Ambassadors, just like a God stepping out from a deep chaos. Around him, the Illusory River which was flowing quietly emerged, it was unclear where it came from, and where it was flowing to.</p><p>“This world shall have no Sea of Sufferings!”</p><p>Before the Celestial Lamp, Celestial Vase, and Celestial Curtain Folding started to attack, Meng Qi pointed with his finger and projected his voice, as if the God of Creation, the Principles of Karma was setting the rules for the Myriad World!</p><p>A depressing rumble reverberated and the pale-white, horrifying arms disappeared like bubbles. The dark whirlpool that formed the Sea of Sufferings disintegrated inch by inch. All kinds of beauty above turned to normal without the contrast of the endless suffering.</p><p>My Word is the Rule!</p><p>If the manipulation of destiny and the control of rules were to be compared among the legends, who would be a match for Meng Qi who had the characteristics of the Nirvana Realm!</p><p>The Sea of Sufferings was broken, the waves were rewinding and abruptly stopped. The three big ambassadors who only managed to swing the scepter, tilted the mouth of the bottle and activated the twinkling lights. Seizing the opportunity, Meng Qi gave the Bamboo Crown on his head a push.</p><p>A gush of clean air burst out from Niwan and shot up straight to the clouds, then fell in all directions.</p><p>The dazzling galaxies around Sha Wujing linked together and shaped into a fathomless universe, while the vast and scary breath expanded. Carrying his scepter, he broke down the waves of the Sea of Sufferings. As he was about to attack Meng Qi, a handsome monk with red lips and white teeth appeared in front of him.</p><p>The monk smiled lightly and said, “My fellow friend Su, I’m here to help you!”</p><p>His middle finger and thumb touched, like he was pinching a flower. He slowly turned toward Sha Wujing.</p><p>In the midst of this turn, Sha Wujing seemed to have seen a golden Buddha full of Buddhist Zen. This made him grow sentimental and he even thought of abandoning the evil to be good, so he could become a Buddha in the near future. His face broadened into a smile unconsciously.</p><p>It felt just like when he first entered Spirited Mountain and met the Gautama Buddha… he was stunned for a moment.</p><p>The Celestial Lamp Ambassador was holding the glaze lamp. The lights were so bright and radiated across all directions of the Myriad World. It dispelled the utter darkness of the Sea of Sufferings and shone on Meng Qi as clear as noon.</p><p>Just as he was going to separate the twinkling lights to form the Ten Directions of the Wanderer’s Azure World, suddenly, a figure so tall that could reach the sky appeared in front of him. That was not an adjective description but an actual statement.</p><p>This figure was majestic and heroic, full of light gold, immortal and indestructible. It appeared with the posture of the Celestial Body, had three heads and six arms. One of his heads looked arrogant with a Third Eye wide-opened in between his eyebrows. One head turned into a Man-Faced Dragon, and in the blink of an eye, winter and summer changed alternately. Another head transformed into a Fire Bird and was swallowing the scattered twinkling lights. The five arms were in different states, all of which were part of the mythical animals and could be known as the moving Magical Treasury or Battle Magic Weapon. It was in fact Meng Qi’s Undying Tao Body and Eight-Nine Incarnation.</p><p>“Fellow friend Su, I am here to help you!” the towering figure shouted. One of his arms raised an invincible blade winded with purple electric, and with the power capable of breaking this realm, smashed at the Celestial Lamp Ambassador who was holding the Wanderer Lamp.</p><p>His violent and powerful breath made the Celestial Lamp Ambassador shudder.</p><p>The Celestial Vase Ambassador sealed his hands and transmuted the mouth of the bottle. Numerous shadows appeared at the surrounding and formed an icy torrent which was about to overflow. All of a sudden, the Chunjing Sword appeared at the side, one divided into two, two divided into four, and four divided into eight, coloring the sky with blazing sword rays. They assembled into a mighty array and enfolded across the sky.</p><p>The man with the swords was a cool-looking swordsman in white, he said indifferently, “Fellow Su, I am here to help you!”</p><p>The sword rays flashed in turn repeatedly with one expanding and one contracting, trapping the Celestial Vase Ambassador in the center.</p><p>Right in front of the Feng Dian Ambassador, the air surrounding Meng Qi became darker as if it could accommodate all things, and induced the feeling of birth and origin.</p><p>His expression was emotionless, a combination of good and evil. He lifted his right hand, expanded his body and then fell from the sky with the Three Realms in his palm. This made the Feng Dian Ambassador look as tiny as an ant.</p><p>Feng Dian already knew that Su Meng had mastered the great direct knowledge of Creating Three Manifestations with One Breath. Thus, he was not surprised at all. The Forthcoming Sutra flipped and white lotuses materialized, which seemed to be summoning the Void Hometown.</p><p>Su Meng’s Yi Qi Turning San Qing was not a big success, it was just a body capable of demonstrating different arts. There was an obvious gap between his ability and the deity’s.</p><p>Of course, it was barely enough to deal with the Legend who woke up too soon and was not at his best condition yet. But the problem was, how long could the Yi Qi Turning San Qing last?</p><p>This time, the Four Great Luo Sect Oracles were definitely not unprepared!</p><p>…</p><p>On the Heaven Conferring Platform, facing the body of the future Creation Realm Maha Bodhisattva Maitreya which was turning into a Buddha, Shaoxuan and Xi’e knew that anxiety and depression were not helpful, but still they could not help but have such thoughts, just that their souls did not waver.</p><p>The Forthcoming Arts chosen by the Maitreya required practice bit by bit from the very beginning. Even with experience and knowledge, the strength bestowed by the deity, and the capability to practice at a tremendous pace, there was a process and law of martial arts or Sambhogakaya that could not be violated. As of now, there was no need to be afraid, as he had not ascended to the Creation Realm and was only achieving the Legendary realm.</p><p>Of course, if the deity was still intact after the resurrection, there might not be a vision when witnessing the Legendary realm again. And by the time the Maitreya reached the Legendary peak, this body would be able to undertake the forthcoming of the deity completely. By then, the future Gautama Buddha appointed by both the current Gautama Buddha and Amitabha would be able to show the complete power of the Great Medium without weakening.</p><p>In between thoughts, both of them started the Last Ship. The ship with several decks expanded and turned into a giant ship, standing in the way of the Heaven Conferring Platform and the Five Wisdom Emperors Sacrificial Altar.</p><p>The giant ship was raised by the Restrictive Spell, stacked layer by layer and appeared indestructible. Both Shaoxuan and Xi’e were standing at the bow of the ship.</p><p>The Maitreya who sat high on the white lotus platform did not leave his seat to help, instead, he chuckled and looked at the responses of the two Legendary Terran. Suddenly, among the surrounding clear Azure stones, two faintly golden bodies came into sight and stepped out.</p><p>Both of them were the Maha Bodhisattva who had lumps on their heads, circular lights floating at the back of the heads, and overlapping shadows. They were the media across the Myriad World. One of them was holding the Lection characters in the arms and another one was carrying the treasure bottle. They were exactly the Maitreya Buddha’s left and right-hand men, Fahualin Bodhisattva and Damiaoxiang Bodhisattva. Both of them had completed the forthcoming and practiced until the arrival of the deity.</p><p>The Maitreya Lection characters tossed, and the Swastika flew out from the pages. Each of the Fahualin Bodhisattva’s shadow was holding the Buddhist Society Seal, reciting the Lection characters, and radiating the wisdom light. Together they formed a Flammule of the Future World, and shot toward the Last Ship.</p><p>Damiaoxiang Bodhisattva tilted the treasure bottle, and a dazzling Eternity River rushed out endlessly and mightily as it gushed toward Shaoxuan and Xi’e.</p><p>As the light rays burst, the flammule and the Eternity River struck the Last Ship at the same time and caused the Xuan Huang Meritorious Virtues to fall like rain, forming ripples of water.</p><p>However, it was a treasure that was refined to cross the end of the era after all. Even without its full power, the Last Ship took the attack without any damage.</p><p>Shaoxuan and Xi’e gazed at each other, and they saw firmness in each other’s eyes.</p><p>Then, one of them steered the Last Ship, and another one took out the Emperor’s Seal, drew a complicated print and motioned it downward.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>A light golden sword light shot out from inside the Changle Palace, straight toward the depths of the Heaven Conferring Platform. There came a deep roar, and the Heaven and Earth shook while virtual shadows of the layers in the sky surfaced, just like the Nine Levels of Heaven!</p><p>Seeing this scene, the face of Maitreya slightly changed color.</p><p>Since they were the ones who built the Heaven Conferring Platform, how could Shaoxuan and Xi’e not have measured the power of the enemies and themselves to predict any future obstructions?</p><p>When they arrived at this realm, they knew not to put their hopes on the negligence and compassion of someone else. The decision was made firmly to protect themselves from possible destruction by the few major forces out there.</p><p>Although there was little possibility of it happening, there should not be none!</p><p>…</p><p>Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu both stood by the window, looking at one direction and were shocked at the disappearance of the Heaven Conferring Platform.</p><p>After a while, they suddenly felt the imperial atmosphere of the King’s Dao. They watched as a light golden sword ray rose from the palace and mightily cut through the darkness with the Forces of Living Beings.</p><p>“The emperor had attacked?” Yu Banshan mumbled.</p><p>Just when Qi Jinxiu was about to talk, she suddenly stopped and pointed at the sky with her right finger, “The Bright Moon and White Stars are gone, too!”</p><p>Yu Banshan looked up, and saw that the Bright Moon that was shining with clear light and the White Stars which were comparable to the brightest moon were all gone as if they were engulfed by a thick layer of shadow. It was as dark as night.</p><p>Narrowing his eyes to analyze something, Yu Banshan suddenly felt numbness in his scalp, as the shadow looked like a wing!</p><p>Only one side of the wing could cover the entire sky of Changle district?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
