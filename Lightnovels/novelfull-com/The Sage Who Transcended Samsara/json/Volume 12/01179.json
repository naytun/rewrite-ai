The branches swayed along the wind as hot vapor was released from the bottom of Daqinggen, creating a chaotic environment.</p><p>Without needing to rotate his direct knowledge, Meng Qi could sense the despair deep within Daqinggen.</p><p>In an instant, Daqinggen moved, letting out an incomprehensible low moan. It struggled to run away from the Celestial Hound. However, the Celestial Hound’s strength was unmatched by Daqinggen. Despite grappling with its utmost effort, it was still stuck in its place.</p><p>Just when Meng Qi expected Daqinggen to give in and beg for help, he noticed its continuous change of emotions. As its green shades constantly interchanged, he immediately took out all of his jade box, jade bottle, and his other golden and iron possessions. He squatted down and collected the liquid that was still dripping into the bottle. Then, he shoved up the dirty and soaked soil and kept them inside the jade box.</p><p>“Woof, what are you doing?” the Celestial Hound asked curiously.</p><p>Daqinggen put on an ingenuine Maitreya and said, “I’m keeping these as a token of remembrance.”</p><p>Then, it looked at the Celestial Hound. Smiling slyly, he spoke:</p><p>“How long have we not met each other? It’s been a long time since you escaped the real world with the immortal. I’m certain that you don’t understand the current world well. Come, let me teach you how to use the Myriad World Talisman!”</p><p>Its Maitreya contained a hint of eeriness and pleasure it obtained from the revenge. However, the Celestial Hound did not have a single doubt. Instead, it replied gleefully, “Sure, sure! Woof! What is a Myriad World Talisman?”</p><p>“The Myriad World Talisman is an excellent thing…” Daqinggen led the Celestial Hound into the room as it continued its explanation. Humored by the scene, Meng Qi gently rubbed his forehead.</p><p>Daqinggen carried out its revenge so skillfully!</p><p>It will turn into a perfect gaming dog, shopping dog, single dog in the future…</p><p>Uninterested to watch a hound learn about the Myriad World Talisman, Meng Qi deliberated over the next step.</p><p>There were two most important things based on his genuine emotions. First was to gain Gu Xiaosang’s attention and favor. Being a Legendary person, since he had already confessed his feelings explicitly, he should not shy away from what he ought to do. Although he was not as thick-skinned as Brother Guangcheng, he was never an awkward and shy man. Now, he was supposed to take the initiative and confront Gu Xiaosang directly. Secondly, he had to return to the Qingwei Realm. He had to release the Heaven and Earth Seal that was suppressed by Yang Jian and find out the clues about the premier’s whereabouts. Subsequently, he needed to enter the uppermost layer of the Nine Levels of Heaven to explore further. Otherwise, he would always worry about the most ancient God Master which might occasionally interrupt his practice and cause him to make a wrong judgment.</p><p>However, the most urgent issue as of now was the battle of the Heaven Conferring Platform. As Maitreya and the Roc Demon King had returned, they could not delay the matter anymore. Without further ado, all the strong people who were competent were assembled to attack the terrain of Great Zhou. With the ubiquitous technique of the Legendary and the Creation Realms, they could attack and conquer any land belonging to the Great Zhou Dynasty, except for Changle City. It would be a tough war and all their previous battle experience would no longer be useful.</p><p>Despite the existence of the Myriad World Access, the news would spread within a fraction of a second if the karma was not concealed regardless of which state the demon race and buddhist country attacked. Meanwhile, the mighty people of the Legendary Realm who worked with Gao Lan could also apply the ubiquitous technique. They were able to provide support immediately once they were summoned. However, if they appeared as an aide, the mighty people who rivaled them might assemble and ambush them, unless they obscured the mysteries of heaven and hid all their movements during the operation.</p><p>As the number of the demon race and the Buddhist country was unrivaled by the Legendary Realm, leaving Changle City for Shaoxuan and Xi’e was like throwing themselves into the snare. Moreover, if Meng Qi, Nazha, the Celestial Hound, and the others from the Jade Palace were not capable of defeating the Maitreya, Roc Demon King, and Bull Demon King, there was no way that the Heaven Conferring Platform could be completed when the Luo Sect interferes in this affair!</p><p>“How can I resolve this crisis?” Meng Qi thought as he returned to his silent room. He took a seat on the low bed as he let his Divine Sense sink in. He passed by the sleeping Demonic Peach and entered the acupuncture points on his left hand.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang was sitting on a lotus platform that was as green as jade. She was surrounded by a dancing lotus. The five colors of her Congenital Virtues were blended, making out a touch of darkness. As a result, her eyes, nose, and heart was painted with vibrant colors. She appeared ethereal and sacred.</p><p>Sensing Meng Qi’s arrival, Gu Xiaosang recomposed herself and paused her practice. She opened her eyes that seemed to contain innumerable stars and said, “Husband can no longer hold back himself and wants to meet me at night?”</p><p>Meng Qi replied with an emotionless laugh. He did not dare to be willful before he grasped Gu Xiaosang’s real mind. However, he did not want to appear spineless. Hence, he answered, “The merging of the soul and body is unmatched by the fusion of the Divine Senses. Let’s talk only when you have the courage to leave this place.”</p><p>Before Gu Xiaosang could reply, he succinctly narrated the journey to the Jade Palace. He chuckled after he finished, “Speaking of practice, wit, battle skills, and determination, I reckon that I’m almost peerless. But, I admit that I’m not as good as you in planning ahead and analyzing the situation. So…”</p><p>He did not finish his statement, but his intention was clear. He was here to consult Gu Xiaosang on how to handle the current situation.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang had the knowledge and experience of the Golden Emperor and was always an expert in planning a strategy and layout. She was on par with the Grand Wang Trickster. She barely failed twice because of Gao Lan’s mental illness which led to unpredictable circumstances. He would be a fool if he cracked his own head and wasted Gu Xiaosang’s talent.</p><p>With this, he could flatter Gu Xiaosang conveniently with the truth. Women always liked to be praised. Otherwise, the compliments would not come easy as he was born an egoistic man.</p><p>Meanwhile, Meng Qi was rather confident in Gu Xiaosang’s decision. Not only because she lived in the acupuncture points on his left hand, she was also an aspirational and ambitious woman. Now that there was a strong and almost undefeatable enemy, how could she miss the beneficial chance to be the influential person amid the chaotic times?</p><p>For a siren like her, this was the best opportunity for her to commence her plan!</p><p>Hence, Meng Qi intended to turn a blind eye to Gu Xiaosang’s hidden agenda. As long as her work did not imperil his kins and good friends, he would overlook the matter.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang tilted her head a little and looked at Meng Qi with a spurious smile. She spoke only after a while.</p><p>“Husband has gotten better at talking. Your dear wife likes it a lot.”</p><p>As Gu Xiaosang spoke, her eyes turned into a crescent shape and she wore a gleeful expression. Her porcelain-like cheek blushed pink as she pretended to be both happy and shy.</p><p>Meng Qi admired Gu Xiaosang’s beauty as Gu Xiaosang rested her chin on her hands. She said in a mischievous manner, “The current situation seemed to be in jeopardy. But, we can actually twist this around. Firstly, Gao Lan is an unforeseeable man, but he has his own plans. He might not be concerned about the Heaven Conferring Platform at all as he hastily released the Heaven Conferring Platform to the public. He probably did this to hide his true motive.”</p><p>She had lost to Gao Lan before. Naturally, she had a better perception about his schemes. Meng Qi nodded his head as an acknowledgement. With Brother Doubi’s changeable personality and mind, it was not unexpected for him to keep a secret motive.</p><p>As Gu Xiaosang played with her hair, she appeared as beautiful as a fairy. However, her deep and unreadable eyes occasionally sparkled when she spoke. At that moment, she looked like a queen on the throne, slightly different from how she used to present herself, but as pretty as ever.</p><p>“Furthermore, two fists can hardly fight against four hands. There are only the Emperor’s Sword and the Last Ship, two mighty people of the Legendary Realm in Gao Lan’s crew. Together with you, Nazha, the Celestial Hound, and the weapons borrowed from the fairies of the Jade Palace, the chance of defeating the Great Sages of the demon race, many Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of the Pure Land and the Luo Sect Oracle is very slim. And that is when the Great Sage Equaling Heaven does not interfere. That is why you should never be selfish and always make more friends and allies across the world. For instance the Ling Bao Sect, the other sects of the Buddhist Society who did not want Maitreya to build the Buddhist Nation and become the Gautama Buddha, and the Qing Emperor who went missing after he took a crucial step!”</p><p>She steadily listed out the examples. But she seemed to be deliberately highlighting the issue regarding the Qing Emperor.</p><p>To form an alliance… Meng Qi pondered about the proposal.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang continued, “Not to forget, the demon race, the Buddhist Nation and the Luo Sect are only a coalition. None of them want the other parties to reign the Heaven Conferring Platform. Their union will inevitably fall apart.”</p><p>“I understand. However, we’re in great urgency now. The dissolving of their alliance or the search for our allies are not practical to save us in this current situation. If we don’t come up with a solution within these few days, they will be able to seize all the states other than Changle City,” Meng Qi said in a low voice.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang pursed her lips and smiled in an extremely joyful manner, “Husband owns the four Fairy-Slaying Swords and has achieved the Legendary Realm. Even if you don’t have the complete sword manual, you can still plan a formation that covers the terrain of Great Zhou. It is not a tough task to seal the ubiquitous sword formation. You have only entered the Legendary Realm and are still not familiar with it. Although the terrain of Great Zhou is vast, it only appears as a few inches for a Legendary person.”</p><p>The Fairy Slaying Sword Formation that covered the entire terrain of Great Zhou? A scene flashed across Meng Qi’s mind. He could almost see the sword beams of four colors, red, green, black, and white, fall from the sky and plunge four different directions over the earth. It blanketed the whole Real World and the atmosphere was overwhelmed by the sword power.</p><p>That was a magnificent scene!</p><p>Indeed, everything was different now that he had achieved the Legendary Realm!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
