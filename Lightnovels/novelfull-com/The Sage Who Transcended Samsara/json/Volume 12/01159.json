Like a mirage, it could be seen but not touched unless it was broken by a mighty person from the Luo Sect using a restraining treasure by force to allow it to return to the Real World. The vast sea, fairy islands, and sacred mountains could be vaguely seen through the crack.</p><p>However, this involved the land in the Archaeozoic Era after all. Even if a crack was formed, it was still a superior world in which the seven seas could be seen, like the Jade Palace, the Nine Levels of Heaven, and as developed by the Sea Calming Pearl. Therefore, with the entrance of Shaoxuan and Xi’e who were the mighty people of the Legendary Realm, ripples were formed in the Eight Treasures Pond of Merits and Virtues in Vaiduryanirbhasa. Similar to live footage distorted due to signal disruption, it was harder to see the scene clearly with the fluctuation.</p><p>The Moonlight Buddha held Fearless Mudra and said with a faint smile, “Mister, look. What’s the difference between you coming or not, and you spectating or not?”</p><p>Although Sambhogakaya and Legendary ubiquitous techniques were similar, they were not the same. Legendary was to elevate oneself to a higher state like the Nine Levels of Underground of Celestial World and shroud above Real World and all Universe Caves, to be ubiquitous for those with lower levels but not for those with the same level. This was similar to Gu Erduo and his men who planned to kill Su Wuming and tricked him to Jasper Lake to destroy this characteristic.</p><p>Sambhogakaya was getting more and more similar to its corresponding Dharma and Da Dao. It was assimilating and would replace them in the end. Sambhogakaya would be seen in all Dharma points which were practicing. So, when the ubiquitous technique and Zhi Chi Tian Ya reached the fulfillment level of Amitabha, it would cause the person to be present if Da Dao was present. If Dharma and Da Dao were not suppressed deliberately and replaced by either oneself, tactical formations or developments, Sambhogakaya could be ubiquitous even in Nine Levels of Underground of the Celestial World!</p><p>The theory of Heaven and Earth of the precinct surrounding the ancient Fusang tree was clearly replaced by the theory of oneself. Since it was Sambhogakaya, the Moonlight Buddha who was also Legendary could not see the inner parts clearly. Therefore, there would be no difference for him to come or spectate.</p><p>With the power to awaken an Invincible Blade to Legendary level, even if Meng Qi was located on the ship with several decks, he could still lend it to Shaoxuan!</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said nothing. The ripples formed in the Eight Treasures Pond of Merits and Virtues subsided suddenly as a purple figure emerged with buzzing noises and lightning. A clear scene emerged swiftly. The ancient towering tree was seen some distance away while fairy islands were spread out nearby. Waves glistening with golden lights were underneath them and they were surrounded with sacred mountains and forests. It was as elegant as the residence of fairies in ancient times.</p><p>This was the view from the Invincible Blade!</p><p>This was the vision transmitted back via the unique link between Meng Qi and the blade!</p><p>“The land is clean and pure and my heart is clear like azure stones. There is a Buddha pond nearby and I have a Buddha to have a conversation with. So why not?” Meng Qi said with a smile. He had the expression of a priest who was there to meditate for leisure. It appeared as if he was not worried about the ancient Fusang tree incident. He seemed like he was not worried, frustrated, or impatient at all.</p><p>However, deep down, Meng Qi clearly felt the presence of these emotions. He was assessing them coldly and looking back upon their source. He was analyzing his memories, experiences, habits, and his inexplicable emotions…</p><p>It was a unique experience. Without giving up the changes to his mode of thinking brought by his abilities in the martial arts, he would not be able to isolate some memories, experience, and instincts by himself to build new cognition or perception. He would not be able to assess himself from another perspective and see another side of his actual self through phenomenons.</p><p>Shaoxuan and Xi’e who entered the precinct of the ancient Fusang tree suddenly disappeared like a burst bubble. There were no traces of them. Meng Qi would not have perceived their movements if it was not for the Invincible Blade.</p><p>They were here to seize the legacy of the previous holy maiden of Daluo. They had to get near it hideously before they started their attack. This was a great strategy as they could avoid an intense Great Legendary Battle. Naturally, Shaoxuan and Xi’e who were not close to Meng Qi would want to get less involved.</p><p>A Legendary conveyance light moved swiftly. The images transmitted from the Invincible Blade were delayed to ensure Meng Qi could see clearer. As it forwarded, the fairy islands and sacred mountains were exposed in the pond water. Ancient yet elegant pavilions were constructed on them, enough to let people imagine how merry it was during ancient times. However, these sacred buildings were covered in dust and most of them were already slanted and decayed. They lost their glory and became ordinary buildings again as they were corrupted with the passing of time.</p><p>Besides, it was silent without any noise. There were no birds or fish, it was desolate and lifeless.</p><p>“Even if these sacred buildings went through ancient times and lost their powers, they shouldn’t be rotting like this and accumulating dust…” Meng Qi muttered with confusion.</p><p>The Moonlight Buddha’s voice was heard as if it was from another universe. His words formed into a sentence, “When the demons attacked the earth, the Legendary people who protected the ancient Fusang tree decided to leave suddenly without a reason. Not long after, the precinct became isolated from the outside world and no living creature could enter, not even the Legendary people. Looking at it now, something strange must have happened at that time.”</p><p>“What happened?” Meng Qi frowned slightly. Things were always strange when Eastern Emperor Taiyi was involved. Therefore, he had some guards and taboos instinctively.</p><p>The monsters repressed under the Ancient Tomb of the Nine Lord of Immortals were shouting the name of Taiyi. Also, Yellow Turbanism claimed that they obtained protection from some important person who was claimed to be fallen for an era and the ancient Fusang tree was breed from his blood when this person fell.</p><p>It would be impossible for Xiaosang to enter the precinct of the ancient Fusang tree by herself with her realm powers at that time. Perhaps she found legacy left by the Legendary mighty people who left this place? Meng Qi thought calmly while assessing his idea by finding its source to understand the reasoning behind it.</p><p>Shaoxuan and Xi’e were clearly alert because of the accumulated dust on the fairy islands and sacred mountains. The conveyance light slowed down and circled around as if they were afraid to face something unknown.</p><p>Right at that moment, the Moonlight Buddha answered Meng Qi’s confusion, “The reason for these people ordered by the Golden Emperor to enter the precinct of ancient Fusang tree is not to look for the previous holy maiden’s legacy but to make clear of the strange events here and find some clues.”</p><p>Meng Qi muttered as thoughts and memories played in his mind after he discarded the parts stained with his own emotions. He shook his head, laughed and said, “Sometimes I do suspect that the Golden Emperor removed the sign hidden by Xiaosang on purpose so that he can do other tasks that are more important to him.”</p><p>“That’s possible, but it’s more likely that both reasons are valid,” the Moonlight Buddha’s tone was calm as if he couldn’t care less about what happened within the precinct of the ancient Fusang tree. He changed the subject and said, “Mister Su, you can actually see the Tathagata to finding out the truth. Why are you choosing the more difficult way? You have the Arts of Eight-Nine so you must be good in transformation. You can change everything aside from your real spirit. Therefore, you can experience senses for different living spirits so you can understand how they feel toward the same thing, like the actual self…”</p><p>Meng Qi stunned. The Arts of Eight-Nine changed things differently to collate forms of the path of Tao and he even emphasized this fact before. How could he not thought of this at all!</p><p>“It relied more on the Premier Nine Seals recently so it was beclouded by it?” he seemed to be posing the question to himself.</p><p>The Moonlight Buddha laughed, “Not really. It was your emotions that beclouded you when you were anxious to achieve the Legendary level. It is a very simple thought. If everything you own right now can help you in achieving Legendary status, you should already have prospects of a solution. Since you have none right now, this means that what you require is out of your thoughts. Since it is out of your thoughts, you should ignore everything you own without a doubt.”</p><p>“I see,” Meng Qi paused, inspired. He laughed suddenly, “It’s not too late. Can you please awaken my memory fragment?”</p><p>His memory abilities deteriorated drastically since he lost his abilities in martial arts. However, that did not mean that he lost all his memories, he only could not recall them by himself. The memories were hidden within him as fragments.</p><p>He could even hide memories of previous Samsara within himself, thus, the memories in his present life would not be a problem.</p><p>Is this considered as not relying on my mortal body and unchanging of three souls?</p><p>Right at that moment, Shaoxuan and Xi’e were near the ancient Fusang tree. The vision zoomed in.</p><p>The ancient towering tree stood tall as its roots were deep within the ocean. Its trunk formed a huge island and a valley. It was divided into two. One of them grew upwards even though it was heavy. Another strain was hidden deep elegantly. Both strains were depending on each other and climbed upwards, spreading into many branches. Each branch gave out a sense of the Real World. Leaves grew on the branches and they were bathing in sunlight. It was emitting heat like it was burning in flames. It was hazy and dense inside like another universe.</p><p>Meng Qi saw a scene similar to this, which was the Tree of Da Dao!</p><p>Is this bred by someone using Taiyi’s blood on purpose to replace the Tree of Da Dao? This thought emerged in Meng Qi’s mind when the Moonlight Buddha pointed toward him and awakened his memory as a mouse and his memory as an eagle.</p><p>A shadow was sitting in front of the valley of the ancient Fusang tree while holding a glaze lamp without moving. He was the Celestial Lamp Ambassador of the Luo Sect. It seemed like he was waiting for something. On the ancient tree, Sha Wujing was climbing up slowly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
