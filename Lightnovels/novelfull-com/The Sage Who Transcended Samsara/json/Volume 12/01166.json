Then, they rushed into the city and looked for a quiet alley before reading it carefully, thereby confirming the language and writing of the Celestial World were similar to their own.</p><p>“Our sect has a long history, starting from the external inheritance of the third generation ancestors of the Sword-Enshrining Tower, and has a good relationship with all the major forces… our sect is very strong, with fifteen strong external realm experts, including one guru. Most of them are strong because of the Star Sparks Art and have a wealth of experience in this area, and are extremely good at giving pointers. Many of our disciples are people with nine orifices, and it is very likely for them to attain the exterior realm, be top-notch, or be called gurus. There may even be hope for them to be ranked on the celestial list with the perfection of the Star Sparks Art.</p><p>This method of recruiting disciples was unheard of for Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu. Most of the descriptions did not strike them, because there were differences in the categorizing of cultivation levels in the secular world they belonged to and the Celestial World. It was difficult for them to understand what external realm, top-notch and guru represented. However, they were still very clear about one thing – the words ranked on the celestial list couldn’t be said casually, especially in the Celestial World.</p><p>“The Star Sparks Art can make people be ranked on the celestial list?” Qi Jinxiu whispered in shock.</p><p>Slightly frowning, Yu Banshan said, “And it seems to be a skill that is easy to access, one that many people know…”</p><p>This was beyond imagination in their original world. A magical skill that could make a person be ranked on the celestial list would definitely cause bloodshed in the pugilistic world, and many sects would be destroyed as a result.</p><p>And in the Celestial World, such a magical skill is so accessible, without having to pay too high a price?</p><p>And the fight for disciples among the sects has reached such a fierce level?</p><p>The two were shocked, unknowingly feeling more fear and anticipation for the Celestial World.</p><p>“Jinxiu, let’s go to the street and see what kind of money they use, and see what books there are in the bookstores.”</p><p>Yu Banshan, who had been in power for twenty years and well-trained in the mind, quickly calmed down.</p><p>Qi Jinxiu recovered from her shock, looked at him and laughed in a low voice, “Banshan, you are still so meticulous.”</p><p>She quietly changed her way of addressing.</p><p>The two held hands, stepped into the streets, and looked around, looking much like travelers from far away. They only saw many machines that substituted walking on the road, which were far better than the wooden oxen. They were both convenient and strange, with towering rooms on both sides. There were many that were more than four to five levels, their styles each had their own characteristics and were not ordinary. As for powerful characters, they were very often encountered, and everyone of them made Qi Jinxiu feel thrilled and shocked. Any few of them joining hands was enough to dominate the martial arts world excluding Yu Banshan.</p><p>This is the Celestial World… she exclaimed again.</p><p>After careful observation, Yu Banshan exhaled a breath and slightly calmed down, “Fortunately, the Celestial World also uses gold and silver.”</p><p>When he flew up, although he did not specifically prepare similar things, but as the leader of the martial arts world, how could he not have money with him?</p><p>With money comes confidence. The two started focusing on looking for bookstores. Not long after, they found a House of Gold at the corner of the long street.</p><p>Yu Banshan calmed down, holding Qi Jinxiu’s hand and slowly stepped into the shop. With a glance, he almost exclaimed, because there were books related to the Star Sparks Art everywhere, such as: Qi Annotated Star Sparks Art, Lu Annotated Star Sparks Art, Star Sparks Art – Southern Wasteland Detailed Collection, Star Sparks Art Sword Practice Edition… there was a dazzling lineup and they were too numerous to enumerate.</p><p>The magical skills that can make one be ranked on the celestial list is actually available everywhere on the street?</p><p>This was completely beyond the knowledge Yu Banshan had for the past few decades. Even with a strong mind, he couldn’t help but feel at a loss for words.</p><p>More importantly, the most expensive book, Qi Annotation of Star Sparks Art, was only two taels of silver, so cheap that it made people suspect that it was a fake!</p><p>Such a powerful technique and secret to achieving immortality is worth only one or two taels of silver?</p><p>Is it true that the Celestial World made no distinction between those of high and low birth, and everyone can practise?</p><p>Compared with this kind of magical power, wouldn’t the manual that he practiced be just a few dozens of copper coins? For a few dozens of copper coins, his sect guarded day and night, strictly selecting a talented person to become its direct inheritor?</p><p>Qi Jinxiu felt it was ridiculous just thinking about it. Shocked and refusing to believe, she couldn’t help but said, “Storekeeper, can I flip through the books?”</p><p>The storekeeper said without raising his head while holding a book, “How can this be fake? You do not need money to learn what’s in the Myriad World Talisman. I just earn for the work of organizing and collecting. The Star Sparks Art annotated by Mister Lu Da is scattered and requires a lot of hard work to collect everything. The original annotation version of the Devil Emperor Qi Zhengyan is subject to the yamen’s restrictions. It is not difficult to see one or two chapters, but it requires great effort to see all of them. Adding in the cost of paper, it is really reasonable to sell for two taels of silver…”</p><p>As he continued talking, Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu were lost in names such as the Myriad World Talisman, Mister Lu Da, and the Demon Emperor Qi Zhengyan. But after living for decades, they could still understand the rough meaning. These two were powerful characters in the Celestial World and are likely to have been ranked on the celestial list for a long time, and their respective annotations of the Star Sparks Art.</p><p>But, the supreme arts of Taoism endorsed by celestial beings are only sold for two taels of silver?</p><p>This simply, this simply couldn’t describe his current mood! Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu each brazenly took an annotated version of the Star Sparks Art and started flipping casually. In their hearts, they were wondering what the Myriad World Talisman was and why money wasn’t required to learn magic skills.</p><p>Once they started, the two couldn’t take their eyes off of it. They had been learning martial arts for many years, so they could still tell the quality of a secret manual. This was especially so for Yu Banshan who had exceeded the predecessors and gone a step further. His understanding of martial arts were deep and his eyes were quite picky.</p><p>However, this Star Sparks Art referred directly to the essence of martial arts, from the inside to the outside, from its own world to the natural world, touching the laws of heaven and earth. It seemed that it could really make people to be ranked on the celestial list, and could really be called a magical skill!</p><p>Qi Jinxiu’s face change color time and again while reading, feeling that all kinds of realizations she had in the past had been defeated, but there was a wider and more magnificent world in front of her, making her feel intoxicated. As for Yu Banshan, he was slightly radiating with delight. The problems encountered during practice were all explained. With this magical skill, why would be need to worry about not becoming a celestial being?</p><p>But, a celestial martial arts skill like this is worth only two taels of silver?</p><p>Thinking of this made them feel what was in front of them was as ridiculous as a dream.</p><p>“Are you done?” the storekeeper couldn’t help but interrupt them.</p><p>Qi Jinxiu took a glance at Yu Banshan, biting her lips, took out the money bag and gave the storekeeper money, buying several manuals.</p><p>If she didn’t buy these magical powers back, she definitely wouldn’t be able to sleep at night!</p><p>Although what they saw in the Celestial World was strange, the effects of the magic skills were real!</p><p>After keeping two secret manuals, Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu walked silently on the street, feeling as though the first half of their lives had been denied.</p><p>“Magical skills can be gotten everywhere, the Celestial World is indeed extraordinary…” after a long time, Yu Banshan let out a sigh.</p><p>Qi Jinxiu took in a breath and said, “This is our opportunity.”</p><p>There was a restaurant in front. After experiencing mental ups and downs, the two were quite tired. They walked in, intending to have lunch and take a break.</p><p>The restaurant was quieter than expected, because some people were holding strange things in their hands, burying their heads engrossed in them, rarely making a sound. But there were lights and shadows floating on the wall opposite the door, which was actually the scene of a fierce battle scene – humans were fighting with demons and devils, attracting the attention of many diners. Sounds of explanations came from the lights and shadows from time to time.</p><p>“The live broadcast of the battle of humans, demons, and devils at the God Burial Desert has come to an end, next up will be the South China Sea adventure, let us experience the charm of the ocean…”</p><p>The blue waves were vast and undulating, and the sea monster was hidden underneath… such a scene made Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu feel astonished. Thoughts and ideas ran in their minds, and they were unable to clear their heads at once.</p><p>After a long while, Yu Banshan finally sighed with emotion and sent a message, “Tens of thousands of miles seem to be far away but it is just in front of you, this is the power of a celestial being!”</p><p>He had probably figured out what he saw. Things that were far away appeared in front of him, and they could still communicate with each other even thousands of miles away. This is the power of a celestial being!</p><p>“Correspondence by letters…” the unusually shakened Qi Jinxiu self-mocked.</p><p>Yu Banshan’s ears slightly moved as he listened to the small talks, and then sent a message, “Jinxiu, I listened to their discussion, this celestial power seems to come from the so-called Myriad World Talisman.”</p><p>“The storekeeper of the bookstore also mentioned the Myriad World Talisman just now…” Qi Jinxiu recalled.</p><p>“Let’s see where we can buy it after lunch,” Yu Banshan suggested.</p><p>Qi Jinxiu had no objection. The two went to the second floor and asked for a quiet seat. While waiting for the dishes, they continued to read the different annotations of the Stars Sparks Art, but changed to browsing instead to first grasp the whole content.</p><p>“Jinxiu, your level is roughly equal to the nine orifices of the Celestial World while I have just entered the exterior realm…” Yu Banshan made an initial judgment by contrasting the description of the realms.</p><p>Different universes have different rules and different realms at which one could fly up. Yu Banshan was a little disappointed that he had only just entered exterior realm.</p><p>The exterior realm has nine levels of heaven and three levels of heavenly stairs!</p><p>“So Peerless, Guru, and Great Guru are the names of the different levels of the exterior realm…” Qi Jinxiu flipped to one of the pages of the collection edition, where there was a detailed categorization of the realms for beginners to gain general knowledge. “After the exterior realm is Dharmakaya, and only till this level can one be ranked on the celestial list. It is called Man Immortal in Taoism but Arhat in Buddhism.”</p><p>Yu Banshan put down the book in his hand, moved to the side of Qi Jinxiu, and read the description of the realm together.</p><p>“After Man Immortal is Earth Immortal and Heavenly Immortal, corresponding to Buddhism’s Bodhisattva, Great Bodhisattva, or Great Arhat, and after this is the Legendary realm which is the only one in the world. It is known as a supreme, and has great magical powers, which is also Buddha in Buddhism. This is the level of so-called becoming Buddha…” Qi Jinxiu exclaimed.</p><p>This is how the celestial beings are categorized!</p><p>“There is still the Creation and Nirvana realms, but there is not much description,” Yu Banshan was in a state of turmoil thinking about the celestial beings.</p><p>At this moment, several diners had arrived. They were young and loud, and were clearly audible to others.</p><p>“Jiu, its another year of recruitment again, are you planning to go to the Great Mountain Sect, or go southward?” someone asked.</p><p>An arrogant young man said, “I still practice on my own. The Myriad World is full of summaries of experience, why is there a need to join those sects?”</p><p>“There is so much experience that summaries can give. Everyone is different and cannot completely copy the path of others. A teacher’s advice is still necessary,” The person who first spoke advised, “And joining a sect brings relationships, and the sect can be your backup when you travel the pugilistic world in the future, allowing you to do more with less effort…”</p><p>Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu slightly nodded – this statement was right.</p><p>Their attention unconsciously turned to that side.</p><p>The arrogant young man snorted, “How would you know my aspirations? What did I come all the way to this city for? Why are there so many people who travel long distances here to settle down every year, what do they do it for?”</p><p>He pointed outside the window. There was a mountain of spiritual beauty covered in clouds and fog, looking extraordinarily gorgeous, “For getting the opportunity to join this celestial sacred place, Kunlun Mountain Jade Mirage Palace!”</p><p>Kunlun Jade Mirage Palace? Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu were stunned, and the Taoist temple they saw last night appeared in their heads at the same time.</p><p>It was ordinary, but had an inscribed board, Jade Mirage Palace, hanging on it.</p><p>Celestial sacred place?</p><p>That’s a celestial sacred place?</p><p>The arrogant young man continued to say, “Deep in the clouds, it is impossible to reach the Jade Mirage Palace without opportunity and fate, but I will try every month until I am twenty-five years old. If I am lucky enough to be a disciple of Jade Mirage, wouldn’t it be tens of thousands times better than joining that whatsoever Great Mountain Sect?”</p><p>“The sect master of Jade Mirage, Celestial Lord Primitive Emperor, is the first and only self-attained Legendary supreme in the world. If I can be favored by him, would I have to worry about not succeeding in martial arts? His two disciples are both famous powerful characters in the pugilistic world now!”</p><p>“Many powerful characters are currently returning, restoring the real world together, showing signs of ancient times. If we do not have great ambitions, wouldn’t we be letting this world down?”</p><p>Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu looked at each other, confused and puzzled.</p><p>Legendary supreme? The only Legendary supreme in the world?</p><p>The green-robed priest they saw last night was the Legendary supreme, the Primitive Emperor?</p><p>Impossible to reach the Jade Mirage Palace without opportunity and fate?</p><p>We had stayed for a night in Jade Mirage Palace of Yu Xu, but left without bothering much…</p><p>The two suddenly turned their heads, looked out of the window, and saw the mountain from which they left. Foggy and blurry, it was indeed a place deep in the clouds.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
