However, the miniature universe didn’t move at all, looking like it really contained the inverted galaxies. Inside every galaxy were countless stars and planets, and the boundaries couldn’t be seen with just a glance.</p><p>This was the weight of one of the twenty-four heavens, which was above the level of a Legendary universe!</p><p>Taking in a breath, Meng Qi stopped attempting to take or move it but formed a mudra sign with both hands, displaying the treasure-keeping formula recorded inside the Premier Golden Stamp continuously. Golden lotuses flew and dim lights danced, refining and infecting the ownerless treasure.</p><p>How could a supreme treasure that was used by Lord Xuantan in the past be so easy to get a hold of?</p><p>After exactly eighty-one days, the miniature universe was surrounded by golden lotuses and covered by rays of dim light with rotating five colors. Light erupted and it started to shake violently.</p><p>Splash!</p><p>Sounds of rumbling water could be heard as the galaxies shook with brilliant colors. Splendid and beautiful five-colored lights overtook the dim lights and golden lotuses.</p><p>Meng Qi grabbed forcefully with his right hand and the miniature universe shrank rapidly, becoming smaller and smaller before turning into a pearl – covered by five-colored light and with chaos and mistiness deeply hidden in it – that threw itself over.</p><p>After days of refining, he finally succeeded!</p><p>Meng Qi stretched out his right hand in front and caught hold of the Sea Calming Pearl before placing it at the back of his head with a smile. A clear and bright precious light suddenly rose from there, forming five colors before falling.</p><p>Inside the precious light was mistiness, as though hiding a celestial world.</p><p>With the five-colored precious light above him, Meng Qi retrieved the auspicious cloud and his celestial body. In his flowy Taoist robe, he headed back leisurely to the black hole once again.</p><p>As fine light fell, suppression and accretion were completely exhausted. Mistiness undulated in front, reflecting the location of the turbulent flow and flagging out the right path.</p><p>Stepping on this celestial path, the Buddha-like Meng Qi gradually left the black hole and returned directly to the real world.</p><p>Different from other celestial treasures and weapons, the Sea Calming Pearl’s power came from the unchangeable trait above all realms and weight exceeding a universe, making it closer to a material than a magic weapon. Therefore, it could display some Legendary powers without waking in advance.</p><p>When met with an enemy, Meng Qi could throw it out directly. At most he wouldn’t have the help of the five-colored light to confuse the spirit.</p><p>Of course, whether he could hit the enemy under this kind of situation was another thing.</p><p>…</p><p>Zhou Dynasty Changle, inside the imperial palace.</p><p>Gao Lan was sitting on a nine-dragon chair with the Emperor’s Sword on his waist. His eyes were half-closed, around him were holy water light and fire of civilization intertwined and shining, forming a pale golden kingly disposition that transpired to the outside and spread into the void space, as though communicating with a different universe.</p><p>He was sensing the additional self of all realms with the help of the Emperor’s Sword in order to build links and to communicate with one another, and also waving his banner inside the various worlds, spreading humanity and striving to be the one and only in all realms.</p><p>Different from Meng Qi who possessed the Principle of Karma and could travel through space, Gao Lan currently still couldn’t enter the various realms directly unless the path was opened up. He could only use his consciousness to explore, which was more dangerous than spiritually wandering in the world and traveling in the starry sky. He could get lost more easily and also not necessarily able to sense the additional self.</p><p>This was one of the barriers on the road to the Legendary realm, and many famous celestial beings had been stumped by it!</p><p>Suddenly, a thought came to Gao Lan’s mind. He opened his eyes and a pale golden color illuminated every little thing within ten thousand miles.</p><p>As the pale golden color faded away, he saw a figure descending from the sky – Cloud crown, Taoist attire, silk ribbon on the waist, straw sandals and a five-colored light sprinkling downward behind his head, looking very sacred.</p><p>In the quiet surroundings, strong men guarding the palace couldn’t help but lower their heads, as though they had seen a celestial god and Buddha in myths and legends.</p><p>After a short while, they collected themselves and realized it was the Primitive Priest from Kunlun Mountain Jade Mirage Palace who had arrived. He was the younger brother of the current emperor!</p><p>Is the Primitive Priest near to self-attaining the Legendary realm?</p><p>With such power and divinity, is the world really returning to the era of myths and legends?</p><p>Against the precious light at the back of his head, Meng Qi enjoyed the gazes with a smile as he pushed the gate of the main hall and slowly walked inside. Opening the door casually, he said smilingly, “I have already gotten the Sea Calming Pearl, not disappointing you.”</p><p>“Sea Calming Pearl…” Gao Lan mumbled. He was no stranger to this naturally-formed supreme treasure.</p><p>They accounted for the majority of the various heavens!</p><p>He was about to speak when he suddenly saw Meng Qi’s sleeve vibrate and a ray of light surge out, dashing out of the palace and into the sky before it couldn’t be seen.</p><p>The Seven-Kill Tablet has been taken back… Meng Qi looked at his own sleeve and sighed silently.</p><p>How could such a useful supreme treasure be lent to him all the time?</p><p>Luckily, he has a Sea Calming Pearl now!</p><p>“Seems like the Stone Tablet of the Celestial Ruler?” Gao Lan asked after pondering for a while.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded, “The remains of the Celestial Ruler’s Stone Tablet, a powerful character refined it into a Seven-Kill Tablet.”</p><p>“It can go back to the past and change history?” Gao Lan’s voice suddenly became low and coarse.</p><p>“Yes, but it would be disturbed and show deviation at where characters of the Legendary realm and above could be felt,” Meng Qi answered truthfully.</p><p>Gao Lan moved back slowly and leaned against the chair. His disposition became deeper and said only after a long while, “Let’s discuss how to restore the formation deep inside the Endless Sea.”</p><p>As time went by and after many attempts, Meng Qi and Gao Lan finally derived illusory precincts inside the Sea Calming Pearl, laid down formations and injected in their individual living force.</p><p>The Sea Calming Pearl that was emitting the five-colored light became heavier. Inside it was a scene of thousands of lights at night, like it had inherited the weight of humanity.</p><p>Meng Qi once again turned the Sea Calming Pearl into a precious round light, placing it behind his head before stepping out. With the help of the Primitive Emperor Symbol inside the former site of the Asura Temple, he arrived directly at the Endless Sea and sank into it.</p><p>The five-colored light was heavy and the lights of all realms were warm. Darkness inside the Endless Sea lightened and fog dissipated, Roaring sounds came from deep inside but dared not go near.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>One of the heavens arrived and the Endless Sea gave off an intolerable sound. Surrounded by the five-colored light, Meng Qi got faster as he sank deeper, finally arriving at the layer of protected space.</p><p>With a wave of his hand, the five-colored precious light flew out, first turning into a pearl before deriving into a layer of universe, overlapping together with the seal and restrictive spell. The living forces flowed in an orderly manner, repairing the damages.</p><p>“When there’s no need for the Sea Calming Pearl to suppress this place, I’ll truly possess one of the heavens. What should I name it then?” Meng Qi changed his body to adapt to the Endless Sea environment as he slowly rose upward.</p><p>This protected space indeed looked like it was set up by the Qing Emperor. I wonder where he has gone to and what is he still searching for?</p><p>Where is the main entrance of the netherworld? Is the Nine Spirited Saint still standing guard there or had already left with the Qing Emperor?</p><p>These questions flashed across Meng Qi’s mind as he looked down. He had a vague premonition that something major would definitely happen when he saw the Qing Emperor again.</p><p>Maybe by then, the Qing Emperor would be taking his final step to the Nirvana realm?</p><p>Of course, these had nothing to do with him for now. The most important thing now was to create Imprints of Additional Self and strive for self-attaining the Legendary realm before the twentieth year of the new calendar!</p><p>Because of having experienced that future and also because of the homicidal mighty character with strange golden and silver eyes, Meng Qi had a greater sense of urgency.</p><p>Of course, he couldn’t mess things up no matter how urgent he was. He couldn’t rely totally on absorbing Yuanshi projections without wisdom to level up quickly. Creating Imprints of Additional Self that were close to the Devil Buddha’s projection had to account for more than half, forming a balance and restriction.</p><p>The road to Legendary realm starts from today!</p><p>…</p><p>Inside a room in Shuiyue Nunnery, the connected beds radiated white light but the young nuns couldn’t get to sleep, tossing and turning because they were all secretly playing with the Myriad World Talisman.</p><p>“Senior, senior, there’s a hot post inside Jianghu Teahouse. Many people are discussing it, looks quite interesting,” words popped out from the inside of the Myriad World Talisman – they had all wisely chose not to speak.</p><p>Out of curiosity, the senior opened the Jianghu Teahouse forum and saw the hot post, “It’s time to rerank today’s top forces.”</p><p>The post was by a chap nicknamed Black Emperor. He wrote in the foreword, “With the disappearance of the restriction of heaven and earth, celestial beings have emerged one after another. The top forces of the past have already differentiated into various ranks. Furthermore, there are many in heterodoxy that have already entered demonism. It’s time to rerank the top forces, your active discussion is welcomed.”</p><p>“From what I see, the current top forces are the following: the East and West Celestial Sects, the North and South Sword Sects, the Two Great Pure Lands, the Double Devils and the Great Zhou Dynasty, matching the number nine perfectly.”</p><p>Since Priest Chonghe passed one, no one from Xuantian Sect achieved breakthrough and the successor of the Zhenwu Sect has inadequate abilities. The three Taoist sects can no longer be known as a top force. Of course, it’ll be another thing if the Time Blade is completely awakened. Today, there is the Island of Three Clouds in the east which succeeds Heavenly Lord Lingbao and Kunlun Mountain Jade Mirage Palace in the west which succeeds Heavenly Lord Yuanshi. They hold the reputation of Taoism and are jointly known as the East and West Celestial Sects.</p><p>“The Primeval Deity of the Island of Three Clouds has been a celestial being for years, controlling three supreme treasures – Primeval Dipper, Golden Dragon Scissors, and Heaven-Measuring Ruler, which is far more extravagant than Heavenly Lord Guangcheng. Although the Primeval Dipper can’t do anything to the Primitive Emperor, others won’t be able to counter it. Moreover, the Island of Three Clouds has a long history of inheritance and deep foundation, and among its disciples are many talents. Now that it has a new Dharmakaya, it can definitely be regarded as a top force.”</p><p>“There aren’t many people in Kunlun Mountain Jade Mirage Palace, but the Primitive Emperor controls the Tyrant Invincible Blade, the Myriad World Knowledge Ball, and a suspected Sea Calming Pearl. He also possesses the Premier Nine Seals which is a supreme skill and acquired the Principle of Karma. Not many on the Heavenly List can rival him. With him, the Jade Mirage Palace would be a top force. Without him, it would just be an ordinary sect.”</p><p>“The North and South Sword Sects refers to Xijian Pavilion in the south and Huamei Heights in the North. Heavenly Sword Su Wuming of Xijian Pavilion is the closest to the Legendary realm and his swordsmanship is currently in the top two positions in the world. His successor Taishang Supreme Sword Jiang Zhiwei has a strong foundation and boundless prospects. Mister Lu Da of Huamei Heights hasn’t struck for years and is said to be finding his own path of cultivation, but his celestial realm and swordsmanship which is on par with Su Wuming are enough to make him famous. Like the Primitive Emperor, he alone upholds the reputation of Huamei Heights as a top force. Of course, now the Ice Fairy seemed to have an encounter and about to attain Dharmakaya, and there are also many talents among the later generations of Huamei Heights. Given some time, their foundation would also become strong.”</p><p>“The Two Great Pure Lands refers to Lan He Temple and the Buddhist Kingdom. The Lan He Temple is illusory and faintly discernible, only those fated could see it. I’m one of those not fated so I shall not comment. Because of its mysteriousness, it is rated as one of the Two Great Pure Lands. As for the Buddhist Kingdom, it has the reborn Maitreya in legends and has now also unified the various pure lands. After roping in Jin-gang Temple, it is now a huge establishment and can be ranked as top. As for Shaolin Temple and Shuiyue Nunnery, it would be difficult for them to enter the top ranking even if they have Dharmakayas soon.”</p><p>“The Double Devils are the Demonic Sect and Luo Sect. The Devil Master has great abilities, unifying original heterodoxies such as the Asura Temple, the Blood Cloak Cult and the Temple of Joy with the Annihilation Sect as a foundation, reproducing the power of primitive diabolism. It is said that he himself is also of top celestial level, possessing the skills of the Celestial Ruler and can counter anyone at the top of the Heavenly List. The Luo Sect has recently been developing rapidly and there are many experts in the sect. Although the Night Emperor is only an earth deity, but according to news from the yamen, one of their constables who died had met a terrifying powerful character suspected to be of the Legendary realm! If this isn’t top, what is?”</p><p>“I guess I needn’t talk about the Great Zhou Dynasty? With the current emperor and the assistance of the Primitive Emperor, it is the number one top force in the world!”</p><p>“There are also three other forces to be discussed. First is the Wang family from Jiangdong whose inheritance can be traced back to ancient times. The strength of its foundation and the number of secrets it has are beyond our imagination. Although it has been keeping a low profile recently and has also been said to have encountered great losses, even losing the Ancient Book, but such huge establishment wouldn’t fall completely. Its remaining portion might still be able to squeeze to the top. Second is the Plain Girl Sect, with reasons same as above. Third is the Southern Wasteland. The Demon Emperor Qi Zhengyan has in his hands the Devil’s Claws that might have awakened to an unknown level!”</p><p>“As for the others with Dharmakayas, or supreme or celestial heavenly weapons, they are below the top forces. As for those with only heavenly weapons, they would be a grade lower.”</p><p>There were a lot of comments at the back, mostly disciples of the Great River Gang which was once a top force arguing.</p><p>The little nuns inside the room felt suffocated and also wanted to argue with the chap nicknamed Black Emperor. When would Shuiyue Nunnery be regarded as a top force?</p><p>Light and shadow moved and a stern voice suddenly came from outside, “Are you playing with the Myriad World Talisman again?”</p><p>“How are you going to meditate and practice martial arts this way?”</p><p>It was the nun in charge. Seeing the disciples falling to temptations of the mortal world and feeling worried, she wanted to report to the abbess and prohibit the use of the Myriad World Talisman.</p><p>The little nuns panicked. Inside the room of the abbess of Shuiyue Nunnery, the gray-robed abbess was reciting the Heart Sutra peacefully below the statue of Goddess of Mercy, “Shariputra, all Dharmas are empty of characteristics. They are not produced, not destroyed, not defiled, not pure; and they neither increase nor diminish…”</p><p>A willow branch was inserted in the jade vase in front of the statue, looking fresh and dewy.</p><p>Suddenly, the willow branch grew and produced leaves!</p><p>The gray-robed abbess opened her eyes in shock and looked over.</p><p>This is?</p><p>…</p><p>On the Island of Three Clouds, Primeval Deity Bi Jingxuan was sitting cross-legged beside the lotus pond, guarding the three slowly growing chaotic green lotuses.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
