Fei Zhengtao removed his martial arts uniform and stood under the shower head. He raised his head and closed his eyes, allowing the water to brush away his exhaustion from all the practice and teaching during the day.</p><p>He had gotten into his dream university and started the Primitive Emperor Martial Arts Society. The name was quite childish and initially it was hard for him to recruit new members. However, after his accidental involvement in a campus fight which disclosed his brilliant martial arts skills, the society had expanded rapidly. Today, there are a few dozen members in the society. Fei Zhengtao was aware that he would not be able to manage all this by himself since he was the only coach for the time being. Therefore he decided to postpone the mass recruitment until the next academic year.</p><p>Fei Zhengtao examined himself in front of the mirror after finishing his shower, water still dripping down his body. He was no longer skinny but sturdy. His body was not muscle-packed, yet sleek in figure and with great strength. He had a peculiar feeling, he felt as if there was a hidden explosive force in every inch of his skin and flesh.</p><p>He wiped himself dry and put on his daily outfit before leaving the dressing room. He came to the dojo. Fei Zhengtao was ready to leave after paying his respect to the statue of the Primitive Emperor.</p><p>“Good day, President!”</p><p>“Good day, Coach!”</p><p>There were still plenty of members who were practicing in the dojo, they greeted him when they saw him.</p><p>Fei Zhengtao nodded to each of them and smiled in response. He walked slowly and finally disappeared from sight at the door.</p><p>One of the members said in a low voice and praised, “President is so cool!”</p><p>Fei Zhengtao always gave them a sense of alienation, even though he was friendly and polite. The feeling of estrangement was not against anyone, but to his surroundings, it was as if he was living in another world.</p><p>“That’s why he’s called the master of martial arts!” there were members who were in awe of Fei Zhengtao, hoping that they would achieve his level of mastery someday in the future.</p><p>They set their eyes on the statue of the Primitive Emperor, envisioning their glorious future.</p><p>Fei Zhengtao went back to his rented house. He took out the Myriad World Talisman after taking a short break. He turned on the computer and browsed through the forum eagerly. He was surfing through the mall, picking a live streaming room, just like a total Internet addict.</p><p>His eyes lit up suddenly as he was attracted by the title of a live streaming room.</p><p>“Fighting the Nine Nether Evil Demon? Oh, this looks nice,” Fei Zhengtao whispered to himself and clicked into the live streaming room. In a split second, the scene of a vast expanse of desert emerged in front of him.</p><p>However, the color of the gravel was masstone, boundlessly dark and terrifying.</p><p>The host looked like a man in his twenties, but from what Fei Zhengtao observed from the layers of green wind surrounding the man, he believed that the host might actually be in his thirties. After all, all the forces would be focusing on training the strong who could step into the Exterior Realm before thirty years old. There would be no need for him to do any live stream.</p><p>Of course, he could not deny that this could be a matter of choice of hobby as well.</p><p>“Hi everyone, I am a self-learner of magic arts, Xiao Qian. I major in Star Sparks Art and minor in Kazuya’s Rising Uppercut. I’ve stepped into the Exterior Realm for a year but I’m still lacking in experience. That’s why I came to the Endless Sea today, I want to find and battle against the real Nine Nether Evil Demon,” Fei Zhengtao entered the live stream at the right moment, Xiao Qian was just going to start.</p><p>The Endless Sea? The term was not novel to Fei Zhengtao as he had been surfing through all the forums on myriad world access for the past year. It was said that the Endless Sea was the passage which was purposely left by the Evil Demon and Evil God in ancient times after they returned to the Nine Levels of Underground, so that they could stop by anytime without going through the main entrance of the Nine Levels of Underground. It was secretive and hard to be discovered back in the day. But the passage completely cracked after the Chaos of the Devil Buddha and connected with the Nine Levels of Underground. It was surging with devil gas and a sea was formed. It remained untouched although the remaining medieval celestial beings blocked it with a planet, the planet was like a clay oxen plunging into the sea – never to be seen again. If they were to act with force to undo all this, it would only broaden the boundary of the Endless Sea because it fed on destruction and massacre.</p><p>At that time, there were prohibitions by heaven and earth and the time had yet to come. The monsters would not simply appear from the Endless Sea without a special call. Since it could not be sealed or destroyed, they could only take a laissez-faire attitude about it. However, as the Final Trial was approaching, there were changes happening in the Endless Sea. For the past few years, some weaker Evil Demons had been sneaking out from time to time and wreaked havoc in the vicinity of the Endless Sea. Luckily, those who were able to come to the Endless Sea would not be overcome easily, hence no harm was caused.</p><p>Since then, the Snowy Mountain Sect, Nature Sect, and the righteous sect in the Central Plains would send their people to guard the place, but occasionally those who sought the Evil Demons’ treasures would find their way to the Endless Sea and kill the monsters.</p><p>But this was the first time Fei Zhengtao ever saw someone live streaming the battle with the Nine Nether Evil Demon. That was why he was instantly attracted and the streaming was propelled to fame.</p><p>The layers of green wind surrounding Xiao Qian expanded, bringing him to the direction of the Endless Sea. After a few breaths, a crack with no ending came into Fei Zhengtao’s sight. The crack seemed to have divided the land in half, puffs of black gas were boiling inside. Though they were not in the same realm and he was in fact watching across infinite time and space, an involuntary shudder ran over Fei Zhengtao. The feeling of facing death when he was seriously ill returned again.</p><p>That place was horrifying, it was the synonym of death! Fei Zhengtao unconsciously clenched his fists.</p><p>Xiao Qian pressed down the conveyance light and landed at the side of a huge temple. He introduced, “This place used to be the former site of Asura Temple, it belonged to one of the Nine Demonic Sects. Great Asura Meng Nan was killed by The Heavenly Sword Su Wuming in the battle between the Righteous and Corrupt Path. They had no choice but to retreat into the Endless Sea. They were later incorporated into the forces of Devil Master Han Guang but no one knows where they are now.”</p><p>The temple was mainly colored in black and red, sculptured with human bones and stumps. It was nauseating to witness as it was associated with massacre and anger but it fit perfectly with Fei Zhengtao’s imagination of the Nine Demonic Sects.</p><p>“There are plenty of Restrictive Spells remaining here which I have explored thoroughly. If the Evil Demon that I encounter later is too strong to be defeated, I’ll lure it here and kill it by taking advantage of the Restrictive Spell,” Xiao Qian said with great confidence. “Evil Demons are powerful, but they are easily deceived and vulnerable to trapping. This is their greatest flaw.”</p><p>Immediate comments were flooding the screen because everyone was expressing their own opinions. Fei Zhengtao was amused by the comments but nervous at the same time as he was finally meeting the real Evil Demon.</p><p>Xiao Qian had pulled back the green wind and allowed the Myriad World Talisman to float behind him as he slowly moved toward the Endless Sea. When he finally came close to it, Fei Zhengtao found that he was unable to see through the black gas. The gas kept rolling and boiling like hot water. It appeared as though the ferocious and frightening monsters would climb out from the sea anytime, anywhere.</p><p>“Bloody flesh can lure out Evil Demons,” Xiao Qian took out the flesh of wild beasts that he collected, and carefully threw the flesh down bit by bit.</p><p>The comments had stopped, everyone was holding their breath, waiting for the arrival of Evil Demons.</p><p>Rumbling sounds of gas could be heard. The black gas started to churn more furiously. All of a sudden, the center of the smoke cracked opened and a horrifying aura rocketed toward the sky, even heaven was shaking. Dark clouds gathered together, there was black fire everywhere. Fei Zhengtao felt a chill down his spine, his limbs were frozen.</p><p>What kind of Nine Nether Evil Demon is this?</p><p>Xiao Qian stiffened at the sight of the overpowering Devil Gas. He stared blankly at a black tentacle with six eyes flying out and engulfing him.</p><p>“Nine Nether Evil Demon with the level of Dharmakaya?”</p><p>“It’s at least the level of a Great Guru!”</p><p>“What is he going to do? Is the host going to die?”</p><p>The comments started appearing again one after another like a whirlwind. They were full of worries and panic.</p><p>It was not an accident caught on live stream, someone was really going to die!</p><p>Fei Zhengtao stared at the screen blankly when a thought popped up, “He’s not going to die if he doesn’t look for death…”</p><p>Right at that moment, countless golden lotuses started appearing at the former site of the Asura Temple. A snow white palm appeared out of thin air, enveloping the sky.</p><p>It seemed like heaven had disappeared, and the void had vanished. Boom. The tentacle was squashed into lumps. A cry of pain could be heard and disappeared soon after from the Endless Sea.</p><p>That man was really powerful! Fei Zhengtao was struck by a thought when he saw the bullet comments springing up.</p><p>“The Primitive Emperor!”</p><p>“It’s the Primitive Emperor!”</p><p>“Right! The kill beyond the timeline!”</p><p>“Haha, the Primitive Emperor is here, the Nine Nether Evil Demon is just a piece of cake for him.”</p><p>“We don’t have to burn incense for the host anymore…”</p><p>“Why do I feel like the boundary of the Endless Sea has become bigger?”</p><p>It’s the Primitive Emperor? Patriarch Primitive Emperor? Fei Zhengtao was dumbfounded at first but broke into excitement quickly.</p><p>This is the first time I have seen the Patriarch Primitive Emperor from the Jade Palace on Kunlun Mountain showing off his skill!</p><p>What an honor!</p><p>I’m the disciple of Green Wood King from the Jade Palace!</p><p>…</p><p>In the silent room of the Jade Palace.</p><p>Meng Qi was surrounded by darkness. He felt as if his body had disintegrated, turning into deep and boundless universes and worlds.</p><p>His five viscera and six bowels were transforming, his nine orifices were focused. His senses were moving upward with agility and gradually deriving into heavens. The rest of his body subsided, turning to the Nine Levels of Underground.</p><p>Nine months had passed, it was time for him to break through.</p><p>Right at that moment, plenty of illusionary figures made their way out from the universe. There were figures like the Awakening Celestial Sword which was the reincarnation of the Demon Lord, the Creator Brahma, and the Patriarch Primitive Emperor, which had not been thoroughly sealed and Knights of the Zodiac who stood in front of Buddha. They were charging toward the polymers of countless light balls that derived from the universe incarnation…</p><p>The illusionary figures went into his body, the characteristics of the Legend came into place, which in turn propelled the functions of his five visceras and six bowels. The real spirit of Meng Qi, the Premier Priest was guarding his own Tathata.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>His five visceras and six bowels were experiencing a tremendous explosion that could split heaven and earth apart. Clear air went up while the foul sank deeply. The celestial world and the Nine Levels of Underground formed naturally, and a multiverse began to materialize.</p><p>Meng Qi had stepped into the Realm of Celestial Beings!</p><p>There was still a huge gap between the current power of the multiverse and those of Legends, there was not even a galaxy yet. Meng Qi would have to reach the Summit of the Celestial Beings in order for it to realize. Now, it was equivalent to a stellar system that was made up of tens to hundreds of stars.</p><p>It was an initial success for Blood Rebirth and it would be a huge success when it becomes Legendary!</p><p>“I should move around to familiarize my strength,” Meng Qi opened his eyes. There were numerous galaxies revolving in his eyes and the Myriad World was hidden inside.</p><p>…</p><p>In the Endless Sea, a two-headed Hei Jia Devil Sage sat on a dim lotus platform, looking at its subordinate whose body was full of tentacles.</p><p>“The Primitive Emperor is too strong to be defeated for the time being, we shall focus on expanding the Endless Sea,” the two-headed Evil Demon instructed.</p><p>Its name was Liang Luo, one of the most outstanding Evil Demons from the new generation of Nine Levels of Underground. It was rational and could control his desire to kill, almost comparable to the Celestial Level.</p><p>The subordinate went away while Liang Luo was getting ready to initiate the changing of the Endless Sea. Its eyes lit up all of a sudden when it saw a priest in water gown. The priest looked like he had been through the ups and downs in life, but his eyes were deep and peaceful.</p><p>“Primitive Emperor Su Meng!” Liang Luo had collected a lot of information about the Real World, which was why it was able to recognize the man in front of it.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled, “I sensed your presence just now, I’ve come especially to see you.”</p><p>One of Liang Luo’s heads started to laugh hysterically, “I may not be your match in the Real World, but how dare you enter the Endless Sea!”</p><p>“We have the geographical advantage in the Nine Levels of Underground or even in the Endless Sea, as we are near-Legendary. Even if you summon all Dharmakaya from the Real World, it’ll be useless over here! You should have gone to the Heavenly Court when they welcomed you, not barging into the Nine Levels of Underground unwelcomed!” the other head of Liang Luo added on.</p><p>Joy was written all over their faces.</p><p>Meng Qi replied with a smile, “I forgot to mention that I’m near-Legendary in the Nine Levels of Underground as well!”</p><p>His temperament changed just after he had finished. It was dreadful and gloomy!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
