These brought about the plundering of the four elements where colors of red, green, yellow, and white wallowed like boiling porridge with danger as thick as its viscosity.</p><p>The Tyrant’s blade sank into it, becoming slower as it had already exhausted its energy and was about to be swallowed by the four elements.</p><p>At this moment, with the disappearance of the purple light, it strangely went missing within the chaotic four divisions as though it had merged into the illusory space, attacking from another world.</p><p>The shadow of the blade suddenly appeared, tearing many colors of red, green, yellow, and white before striking the back of Meng Qi’s hand that was stretched out.</p><p>The collision was silent and the shadow of the blade seemed to freeze on the skin. In front of Meng Qi whose vision was covered by the dim light coming down from the Supreme Endless Premier auspicious cloud, a blade with pure purple aura surged out of nowhere. It seemed to strike from a mysterious world of karma, breaking through the barrier of the water curtain in front!</p><p>This was the top move the Tyrant used against the Demonic Monarch, and was a step higher than Letting Go of the Past. Not only could it cut links, it could also use the link to attack the opponent himself.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, the karma links would also be eliminated by the Wuji Seal. However, Meng Qi’s attacking hands weren’t under the protection of the chaotic dim light, hence the Tyrant bypassed the defense of the Supreme Endless Premier auspicious cloud and attacked the body directly.</p><p>Strong like the Demonic Monarch, even if he was just a manifestation or still in deep sleep, he was definitely stronger than any celestial being. Under the blade, he was still unprepared, getting injured and shedding blood, dyeing the Ancient Bronze Coffin red.</p><p>At this point, the Tyrant responded to Meng Qi in the same manner as he did to the Demonic Monarch, showing the importance of this battle to him as his fighting spirit escalated.</p><p>The Invincible blade was glowing with subtle purple lightning against the chaotic dim light, following the mysterious karma links as it struck downward swiftly. The suppressed momentum of the Tyrant started to rise back. With a successful strike, he could definitely attack continuously and tire out the other party until he lost.</p><p>Suddenly, he sensed with the help of the heavenly weapon that the towering celestial character Meng Qi had disappeared. He had completely disappeared, and so had the Supreme Endless Premier auspicious cloud and the chaotic dim light. What was left behind was only an ancient glaze lamp with a pea-size flame, giving off an illusory black and white light that illuminated countless star lines.</p><p>Is this his original form? As this thought ran through the Tyrant’s mind, the long blade quickly fell.</p><p>Then, the indescribable ancient glaze lamp strangely extinguished and everything turned dark and chaotic. Karma was everywhere and the links broke right away as the unavoidable blade struck an empty space.</p><p>With the Tyrant’s rich battling experience, shock did not affect his judgement. He retrieved the blade and let it dance around his body such that it looked like an ancient thunder dragon.</p><p>The beam of the blade had just appeared when the towering giant appeared behind him. Meng Qi’s auspicious cloud had already been kept and in his palm was a strong Yang energy. With his right hand below and its palm directly facing the right palm, soft Yin energy flowed, like he was holding a round ball.</p><p>Yin and Yang intersected, forming a round ball brought about by black and white fish in front of his chest between the two palms.</p><p>Meng Qi’s hands turned the other way and the round ball followed suit before shrinking and turning into a dot, chaotic and deep.</p><p>With a shake of his shoulders and releasing his hands, the dot flew out and absorbed the surroundings, turning it into chaotic air, covering the Tyrant and eliminating all things, returning to the beginning. The sense of danger was far above any before.</p><p>Squinting his eyes, the Tyrant suddenly retrieved the sword beam, making the ancient thunder dragon around his body disappear, looking like he had lost the intention to resist and did not want to put up anymore useless struggle.</p><p>Thunder roared from inside his body covered by black armor, agitating every acupoint. Overbearingness flowed and his power increased by a few levels. Many deep and vast universes appeared behind him and illusory shadows flew out from them one by one, either coiled around by thunder light, carrying a huge hammer in the hand or holding a lightning spear and an invincible shield. They flew into the Tyrant’s body, making his power shoot up to a level dozens of times as before.</p><p>At the same time, an illusory River of Time appeared. A Tyrant carrying a Chinese halberd and a Tyrant carrying a huge tripod flew out continuously, also merging with the Tyrant’s body, such that his power had another breakthrough again. As he had also came into contact with some eternity not affected by time, he had completely surpassed a level that a celestial being could attain.</p><p>He was like a weakened Nirvana character who couldn’t backtrack or go to the future, but could slightly get into chaos.</p><p>Facing the Wuji Seal, the Tyrant retreated and attacked at the same time. With a pause of the blade, his body and the blade combined and struck out!</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>His voice shook the main hall as brilliant purple light appeared. All strengths and characteristics appeared with the strike of the blade. The Tyrant was pushed to the limit by Meng Qi and also bounced back to the limit, displaying a strike that surpassed the one before.</p><p>With this strike, everything would either die or be destroyed!</p><p>After the blade entered the Wuji Seal, purple light was eliminated. The Tyrant’s shadow was partly visible as he attempted the impossible with explosive strength, wanting to break the chaos and create another world!</p><p>Meng Qi’s Celestial Body extruded all its strength and the imprints of additional self appeared continuously. He even got back stamps of sacred warriors and countless indescribable objects formed by light balls in order to increase his strength and improve the Wuji Seal. He was having a tough time holding on after the Tyrant’s transcending strike.</p><p>“Open!”</p><p>With a creaking sound, chaos undulated like water before purple lights flashed across and dashed out, striking in the direction of Meng Qi’s skull.</p><p>To the Tyrant, the most dangerous attack he faced earlier on was also his best chance.</p><p>This was because under normal circumstances, Meng Qi would have a strong defense, which was the chaotic dim light laid down by the Supreme Endless Premier auspicious cloud. Even if he could break it, he wouldn’t be left with much strength and would also be interrupted by other seals. But when Meng Qi used the Wuji Seal to attack, he wouldn’t be able to lay the auspicious cloud at the same time. If something strengthened, something else had to be weakened.</p><p>This was his best chance!</p><p>If he could break through the Wuji Seal, he would be able to hit the other party’s body immediately!</p><p>Even if his strength was weakened, he wouldn’t need to fear about being interrupted. With the Invincible Blade and his erupting power, it was sufficient to cut open his indestructible flesh body!</p><p>Before the blade beam reached between his brows, overbearingness replaced the surrounding laws and void spaces. As he was unable to move anymore to avoid, Meng Qi leaned backward forcefully, attempting to dodge.</p><p>The long blade fell and hit his body, but seemed to have hit an illusion, like a moon in the water. Meng Qi had flipped away faster than the blade beam.</p><p>The Tyrant showed no mercy. Purple lightning and the blade beam struck as he continuously attacked Meng Qi’s body until he couldn’t fight back.</p><p>As the blade beam pursued and attacked, Meng Qi’s shadows were hit one by one, but they all turned into illusions and were just scapegoats. Meng Qi continued to retreat and dodge, hovering between life and death, as though he would lose if he relaxed a little.</p><p>One chasing and one dodging, the two’s shadows moved faster and faster, almost filling the entire main hall. They actually fought until they were competing who could last longer. Meng Qi turned the Yin-Yang Seal, bringing continuity to his strength while the Tyrant merged the imprint of additional self and history for the time being such that his strength was many times more than that of an ordinary celestial being and was not afraid of it being depleted.</p><p>After continuing for an unknown period of time, time seemed to have lost its meaning. Finally, the blade beam weakened a little due to the Tyrant breaking the Wuji Seal and had yet to recover his strength.</p><p>With the weakening of the blade beam, the purple lightning immediately disappeared. Meng Qi’s palms were placed together in front of his forehead, pressing hold of the Invincible Blade from both sides. Blood flowed down from his white skin as he suffered light injuries.</p><p>Golden lotuses continuously died off and grew again, emitting millions of fine lights, stopping the Invincible Blade from moving downward.</p><p>Black hair was all over floor inside the main hall and were all broken into two. They were all replications transformed by Meng Qi as scapegoats, and he almost made himself a monk again.</p><p>I’ve finally blocked the blade… he felt sweat all over his body. It had been a long time since he experienced such danger exchanging blows, feeling both regretful and lucky at the same time.</p><p>What he regretted was, when he used the Principle of Karma to resolve the Tyrant’s strike against the Demonic Monarch, he had gotten himself a great opportunity. If he had laid down the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation using Creating Three Manifestations with One Breath, he would be watching the Tyrant struggling instead of him dodging. Unfortunately, he wasn’t thinking straight then. Because of the Invincible Blade, he felt that this wasn’t a life and death battle and using Creating Three Manifestations with One Breath in additional to the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation was too cheating. Using just the Wuji Seal was highly likely to make the Tyrant struggle, which was enough.</p><p>Not that the Wuji Seal was inferior to the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation. As a top premier seal, both of them were on par. The issue was, the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation was laid down using Creating Three Manifestations with One Breath, which was equivalent to finding another three helpers of the same level, similar to Heavenly Lord Daode joining hands with Heavenly Lord Lingbao to battle against Heavenly Lord Yuanshi.</p><p>He didn’t expect the Tyrant to be so heaven-defying. His level was indeed above him currently, breaking the Wuji Seal and turning the situation around and almost beating him.</p><p>The lucky thing was, the Invincible Blade still recognized its owner. Otherwise, when he pressed against the blade all of a sudden with his hands, it wouldn’t just be his fingers getting scratched even though he possessed the Eight Nine Mysteries. His acupoint between his brows would definitely have been injured, decreasing his power and affecting the rest of the battle.</p><p>After his thoughts flashed past, Meng Qi and the Tyrant made the upcoming changes simultaneously.</p><p>The Tyrant’s Invincible Blade showed extreme softness from extreme strength, like the last stance of the Complete Soul Annihilation, creating life within destruction. It retrieved itself from between Meng Qi’s palms before striking again in a terrifying manner.</p><p>An intrinsic force gushed out from the top of Meng Qi’s head, dividing into three and transformed into different shadows.</p><p>This wasn’t the best chance to display Creating Three Manifestations with One Breath as the Tyrant might not fall into the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation this way.</p><p>But he had to use it!</p><p>The Primitive Emperor against the Tyrant, the strongest celestial being in history. Victory or defeat would depend on the final sixty seconds!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
