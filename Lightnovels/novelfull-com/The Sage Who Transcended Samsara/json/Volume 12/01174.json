He witnessed the passing of time, and his heart swelled with enlightenment as he felt he could perceive truth and lies and discern reality and illusions as if he himself was on the verge of becoming a Buddha at that very moment.</p><p>His towering and burly body gradually emitted a crystal clear radiance, as if he could reveal a Golden Body at any time, just like before.</p><p>Just like before?</p><p>Just as this thought entered his mind, his spiritual sense registered a sense of danger as he recalled a similar experience. Immediately, he came to his senses as he knew that he had fallen into the trap of the emotionally manipulating boundless Dharma, Smile of Flower-Picking!</p><p>The golden glowing finger that was held as if it were picking flowers had already reached the center of his brows.</p><p>In a flash, Sha Wujing’s body suddenly disintegrated and turned into an immeasurable number of rippling lights. He condensed all of his Power of Vow, and the light scattered across the sky while whizzing around everywhere. It reformed into an Oracle Body at the opposite direction, narrowly avoiding a strike from Meng Qi’s Tathagata Zhending incarnation.</p><p>Upon seeing this, the Golden Body Buddha was not dismayed, instead, he had a smile in the corner of his mouth as he opened his left hand. The thumb was slightly bent and the remaining four digits were stretched out and drooped downwards relaxingly, as if welcoming the world in benevolence.</p><p>A wave of the flammule shone from the palm, some shaped like twigs and sweet dew while some became giant golden palms. All of them rushed unsparingly toward Sha Wujing.</p><p>However, Sha Wujing had recovered his mighty power after avoiding the The Smile of Flower-Picking. With his scepter wrapped around his body and the void shining brightly, he used the power of Additional Self to derive divine sense, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, as if he had been imbued with the protection from both the Void Hometown and Saha Pure Land. It was as though he had detached from his body and become unaffected by divinity!</p><p>The sweet dew and giant palms rained down and the void that was protected by hundreds of thousands of Buddhas rippled. Occasionally, one could hear the sound of holy zen chanting, ethereal and fleeting, blocking off the Buddha’s Palm.</p><p>With one side defending and the other attacking, it was hard to tell who would be victorious.</p><p>The Celestial Vase Ambassador suddenly entered into the One Sword Expanded Formation. However, he was not afraid and used both hands to tip the mouth of the Treasured Vase and streams of bright light came pouring out. White lotus buds were mixed inside, and everywhere was filled with auras of various sizes. It surrounded all four corners with an intention of helping the good but excluding the rest.</p><p>The white lotus buds blossomed and wilted, and the streams of water disappeared, but each of these was offset by a flash of a sword. The light shone brightly without end and the lotus flowers wilted and bloomed as if it was unaffected at all. It seemed that Meng Qi’s powerful swordsman incarnation would soon fall apart.</p><p>This was the power of the Void Hometown’s World Saving River!</p><p>The Ambassador of the Treasured Vase drew out his sword to attack. In a flurry, the swords had changed colors, each now stained with blood. However, some were ethereal like water while some were heavy as if they were condensed, causing the light to sink, slow down, or become stagnant.</p><p>Just like when he swapped the Invincible Blade for the incarnation of Eight-Nine, Meng Qi placed the nether skeleton on his swordsman’s body, causing the sinking feeling of death to materialize, further increasing the destructive power of the twin Fairy-Slaying swords. It was now hard to discern it from the bright light, trapping the Ambassador of the Treasured Vase again.</p><p>Compared to the Curtain Folding or Treasured Vase, the Celestial Lamp Ambassador was less dangerous, although he was in charge of the worldly magic weapons. Even though Ten Directions of the Wanderer’s Azure World was set up, the Purple Electricity Lightning Knife was far stronger. With just a few swings, it caused many cracks in the Wanderer’s Azure World and that Undying Tao Body covered in pale gold also seemed indestructible. It surely resisted the light from the lamp’s fire, in addition to the mystery in Candle Dragon’s season changing time, the opponent’s control over the flame along with various extraordinary deities and beasts, the enchantment had no choice but to endure, though it could break at any time.</p><p>So this is the power of the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade and the power of the Arts of Eight-Nine! The Celestial Lamp Ambassador sighed to himself, having already formed a countermeasure in his mind.</p><p>Previously, when extinguishing the Wanderer Lamp, Su Meng had relied on the Kai Tian Seal and the Derivative Bladesmanship to barely break through the Lightless Darkness. Now he was facing another incarnation without the help of the Premier Nine Seals, and even if the Eight-Nine could imitate it, it would still be an inferior version, and was unlikely to break through the unending chaos created by the Wanderer Lamp.</p><p>Circumstances could change at any time, and the direct knowledge that was useless before may work this time.</p><p>In a few seconds, the Celestial Lamp Ambassador made a decision. With a single breath, he extinguished the flame of the Wanderer Lamp he was holding.</p><p>The Arts of Eight-Nine incarnation suddenly disappeared in front of Meng Qi’s eyes. He activated his Third Eye and spiritual sense but still failed to register anything around his surroundings, it was as if he had fallen into darkness itself and this was true chaos.</p><p>Bam!</p><p>Without a thought, Meng Qi raised the Invincible Blade in front of him and accurately blocked the silent attack from the Celestial Lamp Ambassador’s Nine Streams of Body Transforming Holy Light. That Holy Light would have caused the Dharmakaya to deteriorate into chaotic energy.</p><p>After this, he relied on his ability to sense any presage of danger and the stability of Eight-Nine as well as depended on the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade and Seventy-Two Changes. He had to be extremely alert within the Absolute Darkness that the Wanderer Lamp had created. After all, the Lamp’s attack could come from any direction and was difficult to overcome.</p><p>The Celestial Lamp Ambassador did not have to be too extreme, after all this was only an incarnation. There was little need to place himself in danger, he just had to delay things a little while longer and the incarnation would vanish on its own!</p><p>Blossoms of white lotuses fell from the sky and clear light shimmered all around, everything was blissful and full of the tranquility of the Real Void Hometown. Meng Qi activated the Fan Tian Seal and it slowly started to vanish.</p><p>Seeing that he had evaded the attack and discovered that the Lamp, the Treasured Vase, and Curtain Folding had stabilized their position, resisted the Three Pristines that Su Meng had created, and even in the next half an hour it was hard to tell who would win, Oracle Feng Dian quietly let out a sigh, everything was settled.</p><p>He just needed to hold on a little while longer. The great art of Yi Qi Turning San Qing was taxing to maintain and the incarnation would soon vanish, the four gods would then be surrounded, what reason was there to fear that Su Meng would not be defeated?</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi’s unwavering voice drifted to his ears, “It is enough.”</p><p>What is enough? Oracle Feng Dian had been carefully protecting the Real Void Hometown. He suddenly looked at Meng Qi in puzzlement.</p><p>Meng Qi kept both his arms by his side and opened up Niwan. Out flew the calm and dark Supreme Endless Premier Auspicious Cloud, like an ancient deity descending from Heaven, he boomed solemnly,</p><p>“This short period of time is enough to defeat you!”</p><p>Before the incarnation vanishes, I am able to defeat you!</p><p>Arrogant! Conceited! As if I am unable to defend myself until your incarnation vanishes?</p><p>However, Oracle Feng Dian still felt feelings of humiliation and rage take root in his heart. He immediately examined his thoughts and eliminated these feelings that had been amplified by the Yuan Xin Seal.</p><p>He then saw Meng Qi descend from above. The auspicious cloud whirled around and gentle light glowed downwards. He formed a seal with both hands and then absorbed it creating indistinguishable chaos, after that, he suddenly launched them outwards.</p><p>The Ajati Matriarch Forthcoming Sutra uses the Wu’Ji Seal as a base, today you will know what the principles of a complete Wu’Ji Seal are!</p><p>Only after entering the Legendary realm could Meng Qi’s Wu’Ji Seal now be considered successful!</p><p>…</p><p>The Heaven Conferring Platform rumbled deeply and absorbed the surrounding void. The heavens shook and images of Nine Levels of Heaven appeared, it was as if the surrounding had been transformed into a totally different place. It interacted with Da Dao according to its own rules, connecting heaven and humanity!</p><p>Light golden sword sparks emerged from the depths, depicting a person wearing a Heavenly crown on his head, his regal silhouette clothed in imperial robes. He stood tall and imposing and held the Emperor’s Sword in one hand, the Emperor’s Imperial Seal in the other. He was enveloped in the strength of living beings, like the light of ten thousand houses.</p><p>“Humanity and Heaven, sealed deities and ghosts, today I witness from above, as the divine son in the authority of the Great Zhou Dynasty and beyond, let it be announced to the whole heavens: Shaoxuan of the Emperor Descendants, is full of integrity, merit, benevolence, and compassion towards the people. Therefore you shall be bestowed the title of Master of Stars and Bearer of Purple Energy!”</p><p>The heavens changed color and purple energy descended. It entered Shaoxuan’s body, causing his aura to suddenly expand. He could almost feel the rush of the River of Time and the discomfort of the Sea of Suffering.</p><p>A myriad of stars appeared everywhere, their lights flickered and it seemed like they were bowing their heads.</p><p>Even though the Heavenly Conferring Platform had not yet been completed, there were still lots of divinity available after ten thousand years of refining and constructing. After constructing the Altar of Five Emperors of Five Countries it could now seal deities but was limited to within a thousand miles of the altar, could not be beyond the boundaries of Chingle. Furthermore, it could not give the sealed ability to surpass the legendary Authority of Heaven and Earth.</p><p>This was the main reason Shaoxuan and Xi’e were protecting the Heaven Conferring Platform!</p><p>The auras expanded and the stars cheered, Shaoxuan looked upon Maitreya, his eyes were shining and full of confidence toward him.</p><p>“… Xi’e of the Emperor Descendants, kind hearted protector of humanity, you have overcome many difficulties to illuminate the world, hereby you will be appointed the Heavenly Bearer of Lightning!”</p><p>Thunder rumbled, resounding with a high-pitched echo. Lightning flashed and electricity crackled, enveloping the place.</p><p>Innumerable purplish green lightning condensed into a cloak and morphed into a crown. It descended from the sky and settled on Xi’e’s body, making her look majestic and imposing.</p><p>In just these two short moments, Shaoxuan and Xi’e had achieved a level close to the Creation Realm, but the accumulation of the power of humanity and Heaven Conferring Platform’s own divinity had almost been consumed to the brink.</p><p>Facing the Master of Purple Stars and the Heavenly Bearer of Lightning, Fa Hualin and Da Miao Bodhisattva’s both felt immense pressure. Maitreya’s once smiling face diminished greatly, one hand was extended out and the other held the Human Sack.</p><p>The Buddhist Society’s Great Medium who was regarded as the future Gautama Buddha was about to demonstrate his power!</p><p>He had once managed to entrap Sun Wukong from the Pilgrimage to the West when he was meditating with joss sticks in front of the Divine Golden Cymbals. Although this kind of object had been broken, with just a raise of his finger it would be made whole again!</p><p>“Namo Amitabha,” Maitreya said with a deep voice.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
