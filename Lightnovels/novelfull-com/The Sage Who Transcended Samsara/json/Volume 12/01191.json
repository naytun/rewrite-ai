One section of the metal cudgel that covered a vast area pierced into the sword formation in an indestructible manner.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The projections of the four celestial swords around Meng Qi shook violently and produced a soft noise, seemingly unable to take the weight, and the ripples almost formed a wave.</p><p>He saw the metal cudgel had a golden hoop over it, with lightning around, hitting away the vast sword auras, causing the green celestial sword to shake slightly, breaking most of the suppression that the sword formation had on the Bull Demon King, and almost hitting Nezha and the remains of the emperor at the same time.</p><p>The Golden Cudgel!</p><p>The Great Sage Equaling Heaven!</p><p>These words suddenly flashed in Meng Qi’s mind, as he realized that Sun Wukong has struck. Other than the Qing Emperor, he was the only powerful character in the world with complete abilities and had maintained at the state of the peak of the Creation realm. No matter how strong the Celestial Slaying Sword Formation was, the four celestial swords had only awakened to the Legendary level, hence it was barely able to deal with new entrants of the Creation realm, but obviously couldn’t stop the Monkey King.</p><p>And Meng Qi had only three impressions about this blow: Strong! Arrogant! Violent!</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The Golden Cudgel filled the space, threw off the remains of the emperor, and blocked the ubiquitous Nezha.</p><p>The Bull Demon King seized the opportunity and dashed to the sky along the broken gap, and was about to escape from the sword formation.</p><p>At this moment, the sky suddenly became dim, and a greenish-gray ancient seal suddenly fell downward, smashing toward the Bull Demon King with unimaginable weight.</p><p>In that instantaneous moment, heavens and earth seemed to have reversed. The Bull Demon King was in the void, facing the crushing of the entire real world, and he felt himself extremely small. Other than the bottom, there was nowhere he could dodge or hide.</p><p>This is a Heavenly Lord level strike!</p><p>“Guangchengzi!” the Bull Demon King quickly dashed down, clenching his teeth. He had already recognized who was the one who obstructed him!</p><p>“Senior Guangcheng…” Meng Qi was manipulating the sword formation and trying to make up for the gap.</p><p>Although Guangchengzi had not completely awakened and could only descend a trace of his strength, the Flip Heaven Seal was special and could unleash almost all the strength although it hadn’t been made into a peerless heavenly weapon without having to be awakened. It was like pulling out a mountain and smashing it at someone. Just the weight alone was enough, and there was no need for other magic powers or for the mountain to be awakened. It was purely pressing people by strength and its own material.</p><p>The only problem was that, without awakening and having no spiritual wisdom, who could lift up the Flip Heaven Seal and so many real world fragments?</p><p>Other than its owner Heavenly Lord Guangcheng, there might be only a few existences in the Creation realm. Even if Meng Qi’s body was strong and powerful, he wouldn’t be able to use it for the time being. The precondition of smashing someone was to be able to throw it out. And it was precisely because of this that he had not gone to borrow the Flip Heaven Seal since guarding the Heaven Conferring Platform.</p><p>The ancient seal shot down, and the descending speed of the Bull Demon King decreased. The surrounding voids were stacked and curved, and many worlds were opened up and then pressed into this space, forming a cage. Not only that, even time seemed to have slowed down, and all the movements of the Bull Demon King were now visible to the naked eye.</p><p>At this moment, the Golden Cudgel appeared, and it was jabbed at where the sword formation isolated the inside, obstructing Meng Qi from making up the gap, while it collided straight on with the Flip Heaven Seal!</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The falling momentum of the greenish-gray ancient seal paused and it flew up instead. The Golden Cudgel shook and countless miniatures concentrated, releasing Nezha and the remains of the emperor. But the aftermath swept wildly, like a universe had exploded in the air. Countless nebulas collapsed and light swept across the surroundings.</p><p>The aftermath might not be able to shatter the core of the real world, but it could minimally make the Great Zhou a dead land. Meng Qi sighed softly as he manipulated the sword formation, relaxed the restraints, and concentrated power. Lights burst out, silently eliminating the aftermath.</p><p>The Bull Demon King once again seized the opportunity and dashed to the boundary of the sword formation. However, a fire spear pierced over in front of him, and Nezha’s proud face came into view.</p><p>…</p><p>“No!</p><p>The deep roar of the Supreme Buddha was swallowed up by the sword formation, and its body where pure white light concentrated was was divided by the sword auras and dragged into the never-ending chaos.</p><p>If he was at the same state as when on Spirited Mountain, he wouldn’t be afraid of the current level of the Celestial Slaying Sword Formation. However, he had just reverted to the level of the just entering the Creation realm by swallowing Bodhisattva Fahualin.</p><p>Screaming, the Supreme Buddha turned into ashes.</p><p>In a secret church inside the old universe, a blood-colored cross was erected in front of an ancient coffin, and above it was naked man hanging upside down. It was filled with feelings of chaos and bloodthirstiness, and there were many believers worshipping in the surroundings.</p><p>Pah!</p><p>Four-colored lightning strikes - red, green, black, and white - illuminated the church. The naked man on the bloody cross fell apart, and the bloody cross started burning in an invisible flame.</p><p>The believers looked up one by one and stared at the scene in shock, full of fear and terror.</p><p>Their master, their fallen god, had died!</p><p>…</p><p>Maitreya sat in the eye of the formation, with a white lotus platform below him and Arhats and Bodhisattvas forming a formation around him, barely resisting the continuous shooting and chaos of the four colored sword auras. The three relics on his head emitted light as they moved up and down continuously in the threshing flammule.</p><p>He looked outside the Thousand Buddha Formation, at the fateful enemy, and at the pair of deep pupils.</p><p>The emperor… Maitreya sighed silently.</p><p>He’s a respectable opponent, but unfortunately…</p><p>The remains of the emperor appeared here, and his pupils reflected the figure of Maitreya and the many things he had done in the past ten moments, including competing with the Supreme Buddha, and using himself and Damiaoxiang as the eye of the formation to form the Thousand Buddha Formation again in order to eliminate the overbearing sword auras.</p><p>With a pale golden flash, the Emperor’s Sword attacked and struck into a few earlier moments. However, it did not attack Maitreya but struck at Damiaoxiang. If the other eye of the formation couldn’t be formed, the Thousand Buddha Formation would be in chaos and the Celestial Slaying Sword Formation would be able to swallow Maitreya immediately.</p><p>The sword aura struck downward and was about to hit Damiaoxiang who was totally unaware a few moments ago, but a relic suddenly appeared in front of it. It was a relic containing vicissitudes of the past!</p><p>Plop!</p><p>The sword aura was blocked by the relic. Maitreya was actually able to use the relic that symbolized the past to intercept the Emperor’s Sword a few moments ago.</p><p>This was the fruit of the future Buddha’s exploration of the road to Nirvana.</p><p>The emperor did not give up. The sword aura continued to break into the ten moments of the past, colliding violently with the relic of Maitreya.</p><p>Gradually, the smile on Maitreya’s face froze, and the white lotus platform below him began to wither. The manipulation of the past relic as a defense was too much of a burden to his current realm and strength. He couldn’t hold on for long and would only entangle for a short while.</p><p>If the interference of the emperor couldn’t be stopped, and the Thousand Buddha Formation was broken, the Supreme Buddha’s failure would have been a warning.</p><p>More importantly, he didn’t know where the Celestial Hound was hiding, and could only shrink the Buddha formation, containing only the Buddhist Kingdom and not get compensation from the outside world.</p><p>The sword aura lit up again and struck a few cracks in the past relic, which affected Damiaoxiang.</p><p>The Thousand Buddha Formation suddenly appeared chaotic. Sword beams shot down, and the illusory shadows of the golden-bodied Buddhas were destroyed. The swastikas fell apart and the layers of glazed enchanted boundaries disappeared, entering their final moments.</p><p>The great formation was about to be broken!</p><p>Suddenly, the sword formation was torn apart, and a big sun descended into it. The inside seemed connected to a Buddhist pure land with hundreds of thousands of calamities an infinite distance away. And at the center of the pure land, at the peak of Mount Meru above the four dhyana heavens, there seemed to be an ancient golden-bodied Buddha of wisdom sitting. Behind the head was a flawless flammule, forming a big sun, and in the palm was an ancient glaze lamp containing various karmas!</p><p>The lights were shining and the star lines were dense. The remains of the emperor fell into another universe, one with only karma links. The surroundings were dark with flickering lights, cold and dead. Without spiritual wisdom, he couldn’t find the way back. As for the Thousand Buddha Formation, it was illuminated by the ancient glaze lamp and was immediately stabilized.</p><p>Dipankara Buddha!</p><p>The ancient Buddha who has perfected the Creation realm!</p><p>In order to save Maitreya, he has awakened in advance!</p><p>Universe of Karma… Meng Qi witnessed the scene, and a glazed lamp appeared in his eyes.</p><p>The black and white revolving lights follow the link and they shone into the universe with only karma links, illuminating the road of return for the emperor!</p><p>At this moment, a red gourd jumped out of the void, a beam of light dashed into the clouds. Inside was an object with eyebrows and eyes, cold and murderous. The two rays of white light that shot out from the eyes fell right onto the flammule-like big sun.</p><p>“Lu Ya!”</p><p>The Dipankara Buddha sitting in the center of the boundless pure land produced a grand and solemn voice, and the tone was obviously surprised.</p><p>Lu Ya who was sealed by Heavenly Lord Yuanshi throughout the ages actually helped the emperor and the people of Jade Mirage!</p><p>At this moment, the sword formation plundered madly, and Meng Qi’s incarnation appeared once again in Jiangdong, holding the Invincible Blade in one hand and the Great Wisdom Sword in the other!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
