Everything was back to normal, but without the feeling of moisture and blessings.</p><p>Seeing Changle looking as good as before and the Heavenly Conferring Platform reappearing, both Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p>Although there was the projection of the sect master striking through space, this definitely wasn’t a small matter. Both of them had yet to be ranked on the Celestial list, so it was best for them not to get involved.</p><p>There were clear lights falling and huge stars in the sky. Yu Banshan was about to lament about just now when he saw a star as bright as the moon lit up and covered the others, showing off the vaguely visible unusual colors on its surface. Looking carefully, there were magnificent buildings, like palaces in heaven.</p><p>Suddenly, a white brilliance burst out from the middle, concise and sturdy, like the sharpest and most ferocious sword, shooting directly into the sky, leaving behind traces that seemed to have solidified and the coldness that made Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu tremble.</p><p>What a horrifying sword aura! It seemed to bring the end of everything! The two were unable to control the minds all of a sudden.</p><p>Jade Mirage Palace, inside Jade Pure Hall.</p><p>Thoughts ran through Meng Qi’s mind as he thought about how many powerful characters of Jade Mirage could rush over after hearing the bell.</p><p>At this moment, a white sword beam flew in from the door, filled with ferocity of shattering reality of Ling Xiao, before falling on the prayer mat next to Guangchengzi.</p><p>In the middle of the white sword aura was a vague sword body with an ancient and eerie feel that seemed to connect to the past eras, spreading to countless futures. There were two ancient Chinese characters formed from Taoist markings inscribed on it: “Celestial Killing!”</p><p>Meng Qi’s pupils suddenly contracted. This is the Celestial Killing Sword of the four Celestial Slaying Swords!</p><p>And the four Celestial Slaying Swords belonged to the Heavenly Lord Lingbao!</p><p>The Nirvana of Nirvana!</p><p>After so many years, Meng Qi had long known that the top ten peerless weapons listed by the Devil Buddha could not cover all the other things of the Nirvana level. Due to caution, he had deliberately left some out, and according to what Xiaosang said these last few days, most of the top ten peerless weapons ranked by the Devil Buddha appeared only in this era. Other than the Yuanyang Ruler and the Devil’s Claws, he was very wary of the Nirvana level weapons of the ancient eras, such as the four Celestial Slaying Swords, the Tai Chi Map, and the Wondrous Tree of Seven Treasures.</p><p>Today, he could actually see the Celestial Killing Sword!</p><p>Although he possessed the Invincible Blade which was also a Nirvana level peerless weapon, the title of the four Celestial Slaying Swords was too loud and too ancient!</p><p>The sword light was distorted and the Celestial Killing Sword turned into a figure, wearing a Taoist hat on his head, a plain robe on his body, and a purple ribbon belt around his waist. His face was lean and glowing with a red light.</p><p>Seeing which, Guangchengzi laughed, “How have you been, Junior Chijingzi?”</p><p>So this is Chijingzi, I wonder if he had just entered the Creation realm or is at the peak of the Legendary realm, his characteristics are different from the description in the Investiture of the Gods…Meng Qi nodded thoughtfully. The battle of the gods stopped during the Thousand Celestial Formation, but the Celestial Slaying Sword Formation was broken, and the four celestial swords fell into the hands of Guangchengzi, Heavenly Lord Daohang, Priest Yuding, and Chijingzi respectively, and it seemed that they had not been returned to Heavenly Lord Lingbao.</p><p>Having gotten a heavenly weapon like the Celestial Killing Sword to gain enlightenment, and after hundreds of thousands of years, Chijingzi would be letting Heavenly Lord Yuanshi down if he hadn’t reached the Creation realm.</p><p>However, this Jade Mirage deity was a good weapon maker. The Yin Yang Mirror according to Xiaosang’s description was a peerless magic weapon.</p><p>Chijingzi cupped his fist together as greeting and said, “Senior Guangcheng, you are still as charming as before, and it seems like you have made some progress.”</p><p>After exchanging greetings, he looked at Meng Qi, pondered for a while and smiled, “This must be Junior Su? You’re really extraordinary, obtaining even the Nether Skeleton. When I was making the Yin Yang Mirror back then, I had played with the idea of getting the Nether Skeleton. It was a pity that I wasn’t its match in the Netherworld, so I could only give up the idea.”</p><p>He positioned Meng Qi as a junior, because Meng Qi really had no specific inheritance.</p><p>Meng Qi’s Eight Nine Mysteries and Premier Golden Stamp were obtained partially from the Master of Six Dao of Samsara and the Immortal World, and partially from the Jade Mirage Palace. They were all left behind directly by Heavenly Lord Yuanshi, while Yang Jian only moved the body and made arrangement.</p><p>As such, it was acceptable to regard him as a disciple of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi.</p><p>As for how Meng Qi and the other Jade Mirage disciples he knew in the past address each other, they each had to figure it out themselves.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said, “You have overpraised me, sir. I still need to ask for your advice in the future if I want to refine the Nether Skeleton.”</p><p>Hah, in this case, Yang Erlang would have to address him as little uncle, this would ease the melancholy of him being called a junior.</p><p>As they exchanged greetings, in the darkness and chaos outside the long river,another two swords beams dashed out from the dark chaos outside the River of Time and flew into the Jade Clear Hall. One red and one black, they both had the feel of collapsing heaven and earth and destroying all things, and had the inscription of Celestial Invading and Celestial Slashing, respectively.</p><p>With these two celestial swords, Priest Yuding and Heavenly Lord Daohang could also sleep in chaos.</p><p>The former was arrogant on the inside and indifferent, looking more like a swordsman more than a Taoist priest. The latter was always with a smile, wore a bamboo crown a dustless blue Taoist robe.</p><p>“Greetings, Senior Guangcheng and Senior Chijingzi,” the two each took a bow, and then followed Chijingzi to address Meng Qi as junior.</p><p>Those who have gotten the four Celestial Slaying Swords have all lived past ancient times, I don’t believe this wasn’t arranged by Heavenly Lord Yuanshi… Meng Qi silently bantered looking at them.</p><p>Heavenly Lord Daohang was a fallacy of the Investiture of the Gods. After listening to the exchange of greetings, Meng Qi already knew that he was actually Celestial Lord Daohang.</p><p>At this moment, the Jade Clear Hall slightly shook before quickly regaining its peacefulness. But Meng Qi seemed to be able to sense the growth of the green lotus seed in the chaotic pool. It blossomed and produced a handsome young man whose presence actually shook the entire Jade Mirage Palace!</p><p>It was Nezha, the god of three realms, the powerful character of the third generation of Jade Mirage who was second only to Yang Jian!</p><p>Wearing black armor and carrying a long spear on his back, Nezha showed traces of glory and pride in his handsome looks. He stepped into the hall and greeted with his fists cupped together, “Greetings, uncles.”</p><p>When he called out uncle, he paused for a while, seemingly not too happy that Meng Qi was a generation higher than himself.</p><p>Guangchengzi looked a little gloomy, “Where’s your teacher?”</p><p>Nezha’s eyes turned red, “Teacher was hurt when the demons created chaos on earth. He did not manage to escape the washing of time and passed on in his residence.”</p><p>His eyes showed hatred, but did not say how Priest Taiyi was injured. It seemed that he wanted to kill the enemy himself.</p><p>So it’s true that Priest Taiyi has passed on… I wonder whose hands the Fire Shield of Nine Dragons had fallen in to. It would be disastrous if someone who is bad-tempered and reasonable like Nezha sees it… Meng Qi’s thoughts ran wild.</p><p>“This is all destined…” Chijingzi and the others sighed.</p><p>Guangchengzi looked out of the hall, still looking gloomy, “Senior Nanji died in the battle of the fall of the Heavenly Court, and Junior Kakusandha passed on in Spirited Mountain. Their bodies are yet to be found, I’m afraid they might not be able to come.”</p><p>“Junior Yellow Dragon was affected by the remains of the Primeval Dipper and the Nine Yellow Tunes River Formation. Although he had escaped death and returned to the peak, he could not improve any further and passed on after ancient times,” Priest Yuding said lightly. His tone was calm but had lingering sorrow.</p><p>“I wonder if the other three juniors, Samantabhadra, Manjushri, and Cihang managed to escape the trail of Spirited Mountain,” Celestial Lord Daohang’s smile disappeared.</p><p>Upon hearing this topic, Meng Qi said deliberately, “I saw Bodhisattva Manjushri and his mount in Spirited Mountain. They have become remains and were swallowed by the Supreme Buddha…”</p><p>Other than Guangchengzi who vaguely knew about the Supreme Buddha, the others were listening attentively and deep in thought, having left the mortal world for too long and Spirited Mountain was also isolated from the mysteries of heaven.</p><p>“Junior Manjushri was originally in Buddhism. After giving up his status of an ancient Buddha, he re-cultivated and became a great bodhisattva before coming under Jade Mirage and cultivating the body of a Heavenly Lord of Taoism. Although the body of the Great Wise Bodhisattva has passed on, it might not have completely fallen,” Chijingzi nodded and said.</p><p>Meng Qi asked, “Is it the same for Senior Cihang and Samantabhadra?”</p><p>He was merely curious.</p><p>“There is a slight difference. They also gave up their status as ancient Buddha, but first came under Jade Mirage, cultivated their Taoist body and gained enlightenment before returning to Buddhism and cultivate the body of a Great Bodhisattva, and then attain the Creation realm,” Chijingzi looked normal and showed no grudges.</p><p>Since Cihang and Samantabhadra were mentioned, Meng Qi talked about the Immortal Demon Deity and then asked, “Seniors, who do you think that the Immortal Demon Deity will be?”</p><p>“They’re all possible,” Guangchengzi and others looked at each other and shook their heads. After all, they knew too little.</p><p>Just as they were discussing the matter of the Supreme Buddha, a ray of conveyance light which looked as though it came from the bottom of one’s heart flew into the Jade Clear Hall.</p><p>The conveyance light fell and turned into a woman in a Taoist robe and five knots of hair, her eyes filled with immeasurable wisdom.</p><p>“Junior Manjushri?” Guangchengzi laughed. “Why did you turn into a woman?”</p><p>Manjushri Heavenly Lord Guangfa?</p><p>One of the nine lords of Taoism!</p><p>Manjushri Bodhisattva really hasn’t completely fallen? I can know more inside stories of Spirited Mountain battle through her! Thoughts floated in Meng Qi’s mind.</p><p>Manjushri Heavenly Lord Guangfa smiled slightly, “There was this change after the falling of the Bodhisattva Golden Body.”</p><p>Hearing this, Meng Qi laughed, “Senior Manjusri, I have seen your remains in Spirited Mountain, but unfortunately I failed to bring it out, and it was swallowed by the Supreme Buddha.”</p><p>Manjushri Heavenly Lord Guangfa was stunned for a while but quickly clapped and laughed, “It was great that it happened!”</p><p>All past links and karma were eliminated and all was easy from now on!</p><p>Meng Qi was about to ask about Spirited Mountain when he saw another black light fly into the hall and dash at him.</p><p>Holding the Flip Heaven Seal, Meng Qi was about to hit with his palm when something struck him. He felt kind intentions and retrieved his attack.</p><p>A red tongue stuck out and licked Meng Qi’s palm. The conveyance light turned into a thin hound with shiny black hair.</p><p>Celestial Hound? Meng Qi was stunned, only to see the thin hound shake its tail fawningly before walking to the side, looked for a prayer mat and sat down in a standard dog posture - supporting with the front legs, looking serious and cautious.</p><p>It barked and said with enthusiasm, “Dear uncles, I’m here representing my owner Erlang.”</p><p>Seeing it, Meng Qi couldn’t help but wipe his non-existent cold sweat.</p><p>After waiting for a while more, no other lights entered the hall. Lord Daode, Samantabhadra, and Cihang all didn’t appear.</p><p>After a long silence, Guangchengzi couldn’t help but sigh, “The body and the heart are old, and half of my close friends are gone…”</p><p>In the past, there were many celestial beings in Jade Mirage, but there were only a few in the hall now.</p><p>After another moment of silence, Chijingzi said, “Senior Guangchengzi, why did you hit the bell and gather us here?”</p><p>They were all here using a little power and with the help of heavenly weapons.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
