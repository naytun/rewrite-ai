She lowered her eyes and laughed gently before speaking meaningfully, “Some influential figures might have already been aware of the existence of the Heavenly Way Monster since a long time ago.”</p><p>She gave an irrelevant answer without even mentioning the issue that the Heavenly Way Monster might be the one pulling the strings behind the scenes.</p><p>Some influential figures were already aware of the existence of the Heavenly Way Monster during the Battle of the Fall of the Heavenly Court… it gave off the sense of chaos and evil as if this was its nature. It seemed as though it was not always rational and good at planning strategies. Although it could watch the battle of the Heavenly Court from the sidelines calmly, it still gave a mad upside down feeling… Meng Qi was stunned for a moment. Numerous impressions emerged, and he had a few guesses.</p><p>There were some incidents that happened during the ancient times. In-depth investigation could probably discover the appearance of the Heavenly Way Monster, but it might have been taken advantage of.</p><p>Nodding his head thoughtfully, Meng Qi knew that for now, Gu Xiaosang did not want to get into the details. Thus he asked her, “What exactly is Lu Ya plotting? His actions this time were only to take Yuan Hong down?”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang spread her delicate hands out, now holding a crimson peach. It was translucent and filled with arteries and veins, it was full of demonic luster.</p><p>She gently caressed the surface of the Demonic Peach with her thumb and smiled faintly, “Lu Ya is the son of God Hao Tian, a figure of the previous era. He could survive the destruction, and live till ancient times. This was all due to the blessing of that person from the Jade Palace.”</p><p>The person she was implying was Heavenly Lord Yuanshi!</p><p>Looking at Gu Xiaosang’s actions, Meng Qi was slightly terrified. She could actually make the little peach, that even the Tree of Da Dao feared, so docile?</p><p>But if he thought about it, the little peach obviously had something to do with life span and the flat peach garden, it was seemingly a natural thing. After all, the flat peach garden belonged to the Golden Emperor who was the Ajati Matriarch, and not much needed to be said about the Ajati Matriarch’s relationship with Gu Xiaosang.</p><p>But it was Lu Ya who relied on the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi’s blessing to survive the end of the era that astonished everyone. He was repressed with a seal by Heavenly Lord Yuanshi for an eternity!</p><p>Gu Xiaosang continued, “Lu Ya was always very ambitious. The incident of the Heavenly Court seemed to have secret contacts with the Celestial Ruler or Lord Ling Bao. It might be the reason that person was angry, and so he was repressed. What he is doing now should be related to the incident back then. Perhaps it was an arrangement that lasted through eternity, but unfortunately I am not even sure of the entire situation.”</p><p>The more Meng Qi listened, the more shocked he was. He had a feeling that the incident of the Heavenly Court many years ago had not truly been settled. Even though victory and defeat seemed to have been determined at that time, in reality, large incidents that happened after that such as the demon battles, the emperor governing the world, the tyrants of the middle age, the Chaos of the Devil Buddha, and so on, were extended from it. Parts of the plan had experienced eternity, and it was going to finally reach completion once the Final Trial is here.</p><p>The sudden arrival of this feeling was not baffling due to Gu Xiaosang’s obvious hints and certain abnormalities that he found out a while ago. They all pointed to the fall of the Heavenly Court and the destruction of the Nine Levels of Heaven as symbols of the end of an era. However, the fall of the Heavenly Court and the disappearance of the Nine Levels of Heaven happened two to three thousand years ago and the current era still existed. These were enough to prove that the incident of the Heavenly Court was not so easily resolved!</p><p>With this thought in mind, many secrets inside Meng Qi’s head were beginning to connect into a single thread, but as the crucial part was still missing, it was unable to take shape.</p><p>Ever since the demon battles started, the source of many Heavenly Tribulations, strategies, and resentment was the incident of the fall of the Heavenly Court!</p><p>After understanding that Lu Ya had certain involvements with either the Celestial Ruler or Lord Ling Bao, Meng Qi kept his other thoughts in check. He looked at Gu Xiaosang’s pale face and said with a smile, “Now that the situation is barely stable, this is the best opportunity for you to attack the Legendary realm. But even if you let the legend prove itself, perhaps you would not have any power to resist and there might not be many places for you to hide when you have to face the one who has returned.”</p><p>He wanted to find out who Gu Xiaosang was relying on. No matter how he looked at it, the legend about the Nirvana Realm’s fight had no chance of winning, unlike himself. At any rate, the Devil Buddha was repressed in Spirited Mountain. As long as he could race against time and fight to enter Nirvana Realm before it could escape, even though it is difficult, at least there is still some glimpse of hope.</p><p>But Meng Qi also did not expect Gu Xiaosang to reveal her own secrets. Instead he only hoped to find out some things based on her reactions.</p><p>With one hand caressing the Demonic Peach and the other hand supporting her face, Gu Xiaosang smiled, “Same with you. When the situation is in chaos once again, there might be someone who would sneak into Spirited Mountain, open the seal, and let the Devil Buddha out. When it comes to destroying the chessboard, both of us are on the same boat.”</p><p>When she said that both of us were on the same boat, the look in her eyes changed. Her smile concealed the emotions deep in her gaze, making Meng Qi empathize with her.</p><p>Both of them were on the edge of the cliff, and they could fall off at any time.</p><p>Withdrawing from his Divine Sense, Meng Qi opened his eyes. After examining his thoughts, he activated the Principles of Karma, covered the mysteries of heaven, and entered the Qingwei Realm immediately.</p><p>This was the best opportunity to open the Yang Jian seal.</p><p>First of all, his own strength was already enough. Secondly, Maitreya and the other external enemies had just been hit hard, so there was no way they could pay attention to him. Thirdly, Dipankara Buddha and the others had awakened ahead of time, and now that the realm desperately needed to be stabilized, they would have to search for a method of restoration and they would not be in time to investigate the whereabouts of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi. If this was delayed, once Dipankara Buddha and the Superior Demonic Monarch has begun the early stages of stabilization, and with Guangchengzi and the rest not fully awake yet, they might get to the Qingwei Realm first and open the seal, thus destroying important clues.</p><p>But what clue was it that needed a Yang Jian seal and could not be taken away?</p><p>While the thoughts were turning in his head, Meng Qi appeared in front of the valley where flora grew in abundance and were rotating with a breathtaking expansiveness reminiscent of the beginning of the ancient times.</p><p>A pale ray of light appeared, presenting a light golden gate that was sealed. Within the entrance was a place so lush and full of exotic flowers and spiritual roots, but none of them took the form of spirits.</p><p>A stone tablet marked with traces of age was erected at the core, and on it was written:</p><p>“No spiritual roots and exotic flowers shall take form within this land.”</p><p>Laying eyes on the stone tablet again, Meng Qi was still amazed. It was so simple for him to break this law of thearchy now. Re-establishing it would only make it last a short while, as it is unable to transform permanently. After all, this was a fragment of the Qingwei Realm.</p><p>To get to the level of Yang Jian, one had to at least enter the Creation Realm.</p><p>The Ancient Glaze Lamp appeared in his eyes, emitting lines of bright sparkling stars, white and black rotating in the karma universe. His surroundings were an illusion of the River of Time, silently moving forward and never changing.</p><p>The two combined, and the breath of destiny filled the air. His words could rule!</p><p>Meng Qi reached out with his right hand, and with the karma threads and the River of Time, he grasped the stone tablet and declared,</p><p>“There shall be no prohibitions on this land. Sagacity shall be born, and shall take shape!”</p><p>With the power to control destiny, he competed with the power of the stone tablet. It offset each other, allowing it to be pulled up.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A loud rumbling sound rose in the void, echoing all around. The stone tablet was pulled down from infinite height as if it were extracted from between heaven and earth. The exotic flowers, Ginseng and Ganoderma suddenly increased in vitality, their branches swaying as though they were bowing.</p><p>The stone tablet had just been pulled out. A light breeze blew past, turning it to ashes which eventually corroded with time.</p><p>The second golden gate emerged, and Meng Qi entered with his hands behind his back. He was surrounded by countless stars, the flowing of the River of Time never ceasing.</p><p>The gray stone ground was about a dozen square feet. A similar stone tablet was erected on the ground, and a law of thearchy was faintly written on it:</p><p>“The living spirits of this realm shall not pass the first level of the Heavenly Stairs.”</p><p>Meng Qi reached out with his right hand again, grasping the top of the stone tablet as he announced solemnly,</p><p>“The living spirits of this realm’s practice limit is within themselves, and not externally!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The two mainlands separated by the Sea of Fairy’s Sorrow rumbled with thunder at the same time. Purple and silver snakes of electricity filled the air as though something was broken and they were celebrating!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>In a certain sect, a white-haired elder was meditating with his eyes closed. Feeling the shackles that could never be broken, he sighed with frustration in his heart as he waited for his emotions to pass with time. But as the God of Thunder shook the earth, he shuddered, feeling the eternally unchanging Heaven Pass collapse ever so naturally.</p><p>He opened his eyes, startled at his breakthrough. Sensing the External Realm, he could feel the electricity bright as day, and heaven and earth were seemingly much different than they were before!</p><p>Is this the beauty of the Creation Realm, reversing after hitting the extreme?</p><p>There were many powerful individuals such as him in many places on these two mainlands.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Meng Qi did not stop and continued forward. He then pulled up the stone tablets one by one.</p><p>“This realm ought to be full of vigor, with no shortage of natural resources and treasures, unlimited grades of arts, and measures of refinement increasing day by day!”</p><p>“The sea of chaos in this realm will have no fog, with normal thunder, no whirlpools, with a seamless void, and shall grant entry whenever!”</p><p>…</p><p>Boom!</p><p>On the dark ocean, the fog that was covered for eternity was blown away by fierce winds, never to be seen again. The unceasing purple-green lightning stopped suddenly, the terrifying whirlpools that were hidden in the darkness and the gaps in the void restored and healed. The sea was blue, and the sky was as clear as water. Everyone could clearly feel the changes of the external realm. Everything was different, and the powerful individuals that were feeling the heaven and earth all cried inexplicable tears.</p><p>The eight stone tablets vanished. Meng Qi paused in front of the last empty tablet, feeling it shaking continuously. After losing the remaining blessings, it was unable to repress the movements under the seal.</p><p>After making some slight adjustments, Meng Qi activated the Principles of Karma again, revealing the River of Time. He started controlling destiny and grasped the blank stone tablet.</p><p>The stone tablet was extremely heavy so it was being pulled out little by little. A heavy noise emerged from deep in the earth as if the thunder had reversed its position.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>An absolutely potent arc of purple lighting shot down from the sky. As if it was the Divine Thunder of each realm, it hit the blank stone tablet which was pulled halfway out directly and incinerated it, making its ashes sputter everywhere!</p><p>The stone tablet’s disappearance revealed a dim whirlpool filled with destruction and termination, its source unknown.</p><p>“Are the clues to Heavenly Lord Yuanshi’s whereabouts in there?” Meng Qi stared at it deeply, focused in his thoughts.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
