He had no choice but to accept the fact that the extraordinary power that he got was the Small Universe of Virgo.</p><p>Little Universe? What can this little thing do? Gu Liang sat on the side of the bed and closed his eyes, recollecting the extraordinary senses earlier on. His mind and body gradually stabilized as the little universe inside his body revolved naturally.</p><p>The surroundings seemed dark and empty. Then, a thick veil seemed to be lifted and everything became clear. Sounds came from every room in the apartment building – whistling sounds, squeaking of gramophone needle, low sobbing sounds, sounds of rat biting. They were all in a mess, but brought out the unusual quietness of the night.</p><p>Something unexplainable descended from the sky, forming the stars of Virgo that emitted brilliant and illusory light rays, falling onto his body and creating an illusionary image of the Virgo sign, seemingly forming a vast universe of its own.</p><p>As energy flowed, stars seemed to appear in Gu Liang’s hand, forming a miniature galaxy that contained explosive power.</p><p>Gu Liang opened his eyes, and no longer had doubts about the so-called Little Universe, Virgo and fast-tracked.</p><p>This is a truly authentic extraordinary power!</p><p>Just the small portion that he had currently released seemed no worse than many members of the Special Operations Division!</p><p>And just over ten minutes ago, he was still an ordinary person who had never seen any real extraordinary power. This had changed instantaneously, owing to the kindness of the god.</p><p>What is a real god?</p><p>This is a real god!</p><p>Gu Liang who in the past only had slight faith and did not believe in ghosts, extraordinary powers, etc. stood up and knelt devotedly before the Eye of Desire with his right hand on his chest as he said from the bottom of his heart, “You are the master of storms, you are the incarnation of natural disasters, you are the almighty god!”</p><p>Right after this, he seemed to see an indescribable existence sitting at the deepest, darkest and most terrifying part of the universe. It didn’t have any differentiation between up and down, front and back, past and future, tracing everything back to the very beginning.</p><p>A bolt of lightning burst out from this existence, forming a giant with messy golden hair and thunder-like wings. Holding a terrifying giant hammer, he created a storm and turned into a natural disaster.</p><p>“Could the God of Storms and Natural Disasters be just a manifestation of some great existence?” Gu Liang got a shock, feeling exuberant right away.</p><p>He put on the Eye of Desire, tidied up the room and walked out of the apartment. Standing under the bright street light, he waited for an available horse carriage.</p><p>As the most prosperous city in the Far East, there were still horse carriages passing through places crowded with disco clubs and other corners of the city even late at night.</p><p>After a long wait, Gu Liang finally got a horse carriage without passengers. In the past, he would definitely be frustrated and impatient, but after having the Little Universe of Virgo, he felt that he particularly enjoyed the rare idle time.</p><p>The carriage passed through the no longer crowded streets and soon it was near the New Scotland Yard. When paying the fare, he saw the driver had a simple and unsophisticated cross hanging in front of his chest.</p><p>“Do you believe in god?” he raised an eyebrow and asked.</p><p>Since the falling of god, many clergy people have gone mad and went on killings. His church quickly fell apart and it is difficult to find believers anymore. Even if there were, they are bloodsuckers who worship the fallen god.</p><p>The driver nodded with reservation, “Yes, for three generations.”</p><p>“But there are no more clergies,” Gu Liang frowned.</p><p>The driver gave him a strange look, “How does that matter? Just pray at home.”</p><p>Speaking of which, he scratched his head and said in embarrassment, “Just for a peace of mind.”</p><p>Gu Liang nodded. This was also his attitude toward religion in the past, but things had changed as time went by. He now believed from the bottom of his heart the existence of real god, the almighty God of Storms and Natural Disasters.</p><p>Back in the Special Operations Division conference room, many members were still resting and the inside appeared sparse. Gu Liang didn’t talk much, received new information and focused on studying them.</p><p>As time went by, he knew what was the Buddhist organization and what was the Taoist organization, knew about the common Buddha chant Namo Amitabha, knew about the mystery of the soul advocates of the members of the Buddhist organization, knew about the system of Six Dao of Samsara they constructed, knew about the sixth sense, seventh sense, eighth sense, and the corresponding consciousness…</p><p>With the understanding of the Buddhist organization, he found his little universe got clearer and stronger, as though it had references and it now had so-called seeds of wisdom of the Buddhist organization. Once they sprouted, they would be different extraordinary powers.</p><p>The Little Universe of Virgo has countless links with the Buddhist organization? Gu Liang suddenly felt a chill down his spine but also extremely delighted.</p><p>No wonder the God of Storms and Natural Disasters want to investigate the Anti-Buddhist Sect!</p><p>“How’s it going?” Lin Tong who had changed into a black female police coat came over.</p><p>Gu Liang said honestly, “Didn’t find any clues, but have a better understanding of the Buddhist organization and the Taoist organization that had disappeared in history.”</p><p>“Not bad, this is essential to finding the Anti-Buddhist Sect.” Lin Tong nodded before curling her lips into a spurious smile, “But I have one question.”</p><p>“What is it?” Gu Liang asked.</p><p>Lin Tong’s eyes wandered, “Why are you always keeping your eyes closed? You can still read the information like this?”</p><p>I, I closed my eyes? It was only until now that Gu Liang realized he was closing his eyes like a blind man, he didn’t know when it started, but he could see Lin Tong’s expression, the colleagues around and the information on the table clearly.</p><p>He was using his heart to see… Gu Liang suddenly understood, the Little Universe of Virgo really originated from the Buddhist organization!</p><p>He opened his eyes, and the surroundings seemed to brighten up at once. Lin Tong felt that there seemed to be a galaxy revolving slowly deep in his eyes, which was particularly attractive.</p><p>“Not bad, besides accurate shooting ability, you also have other spiritual talents, no wonder Officer Zhang specially recruited you,” Lin Tong looked away and silently marveled.</p><p>A few days later, after the information on the Anti-Buddhist Sect Gu Liang collected deepened the core of the Eye of Desire again, the stay-behind team swapped with the action team and started substantial investigation of the related people, etc., listed out previously. He and Lin Tong were in the same team together with other experienced members, in charge of a few targets in Xu’an District.</p><p>Inside an alley, the road was narrow, and above the head were messy clothes lines with water dripping from time to time. Lin Tong walked with disappointment as she casually asked the team members, “Did you discover anything about that target just now?”</p><p>“No, very normal,” a spiritual inspector named Li Feng shook his head.</p><p>Gu Liang also felt that there was nothing wrong and was about to reply when he suddenly froze, because he felt something resonating with his little universe!</p><p>It had pure wisdom and clear zenness – it was a relic of the Buddhist organization!</p><p>Gu Liang turned to look at the old and run-down apartment at the side, pointed at the third story and said, “There’s something wrong with that room!”</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Lin Tong asked in shock.</p><p>“There is a presence of a sacred item of the Buddhist organization, seemingly related to the Anti-Buddhist Sect,” Gu Liang said with resoluteness.</p><p>He suddenly understood why the God of Storms and Natural Disaster gave him a Little Universe of Virgo and not Capricorn.</p><p>“You can sense it?” Lin Feng expressed his doubt.</p><p>If the Special Operations Division didn’t have so many examples of having extraordinary abilities that could sense some things, he would have just left.</p><p>What abilities can a newbie have?</p><p>“Yes,” Gu Liang said firmly.</p><p>Lin Tong gave it a thought and immediately instructed, “Senior Inspector Lin Feng, return to New Scotland Yard and request backup. Inspector Wang Yan, spread out the remaining members and seal off all the entrances and exits of this apartment.</p><p>Sheriff Gu Liang and I will go up to investigate, in case there are other unforeseen circumstances.”</p><p>She was cautious and didn’t want to barge in directly, in case the other party got alerted and she couldn’t handle it.</p><p>The stairs of the apartment creaked – it could have been built in the last century and experienced all sorts of hardships. After passing through the first two levels and reaching the third, Lin Tong suddenly sniffed in and said in a low voice, “Smells of blood, something’s wrong indeed, retreat downstairs.”</p><p>Right after her words, arms suddenly appeared one by one from both sides of the wall. They didn’t have any skin and were just full of bloody flesh while bloody intestines appeared from the stairs, wanting to entangle their bodies.</p><p>Lin Tong pressed her right hand and light suddenly shone from the surface of her body like the rays of the morning sun, making the arms and intestines produce whizzing sounds.</p><p>She was the celestial officer of the God of Sun.</p><p>When Gu Liang witnessed this scene, he was at first shocked but suddenly something came to his mind and his expression turned solemn. Opening his mouth, he produced a solemn and sacred voice, “Namo!”</p><p>With the zen voice, his body simultaneously emitted rays of golden glaze light that looked like they were cast in gold, full of indestructible charm. Neither the arms nor the intestine could invade it, and those that got hit were shattered.</p><p>Lin Tong glanced at Gu Liang in shock and was about to pull him backward when she heard footsteps. She saw strangers walking up one by one from below, their dressings each had their own characteristics and they all had friendly smiles on their faces, but they either were short of arms, had empty eyes, or had opened up stomachs with missing intestines!</p><p>The skinless arms and bloody intestines came from them?</p><p>Behind was extremely dangerous. Lin Tong gave it a quick thought and dashed up pulling Gu Liang along, “Get to the third story, jump to the rooftop of another apartment and wait for support!</p><p>Thump thump thump, they ran extremely fast. But right at this moment, the door of the room on the third story suddenly opened and out came a tall and thin man wearing a strange reddish black long robe. His skin color was bronze and his eye gaze was cold. As he stretched out his right hand, an invisible wall suddenly blocked the front of Lin Tong and Gu Liang.</p><p>His voice seemed to originate from hell. Spreading out his hands, he said in a deep voice, “With Buddha, all living things are delivered from suffering. Against Buddha, all things are annihilated!”</p><p>Spreading his palms, a reddish black reverse swastika turned into a bright light that surged toward Lin Tong and Gu Liang.</p><p>Only one thought flashed across Gu Liang’s mind. The Reversed Buddha’s Palm!</p><p>Under the reddish black waves, the dead weren’t affected, but the living people of Far East definitely couldn’t counter it.</p><p>Lin Tong held an emblem of the God of Sun in her hand and turned it into a big sun, but it continuously melted and she couldn’t hold on much longer.</p><p>“What rotten luck, meeting this Anti-Buddhist Sect top level,” Lin Tong let out a bitter laugh.</p><p>Gu Liang’s hair was standing and didn’t care about accumulation anymore. He stroked the Eye of Desire and shouted, “The almighty existence, help me pass through this!”</p><p>Darkness was gone in a flash and an armor that seemed to be cast in gold suddenly appeared in Gu Liang’s mind. Its strength was boundless and its extraordinariness looked substantial.</p><p>“Golden Holy Robe of Virgo, borrowing time limit… one minute, usage restriction… the Little Universe is inadequate, it can only be worn on the hand,” the thunderous voice of the God of Storms and Natural Disasters sounded.</p><p>Golden Holy Robe? What’s this? Gu Liang was stunned.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
