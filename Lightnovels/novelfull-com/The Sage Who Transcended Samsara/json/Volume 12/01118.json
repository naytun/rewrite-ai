He held up the massive Golden Hammer beside him as he furiously roared,</p><p>“Hold that cow by his nostrils and extend his neck for me to hammer for a good three times!”</p><p>Along with a deafening rumble like waves, the sky grew dark above Ju Ze, causing the hole-like ripples to look prominent, deep inside the ripples appeared like an illusion as though it was connected to another universe.</p><p>Splash, every ripple had water spurted out, illusory but true, causing over three thousand miles of the vast pole to turn into a flooding world with sparkling and clear waves.</p><p>Here, there was a lot of gold, scattered melanite, ungrowable Aoki, and fires unable to ignite. Other than the power of the water and the corresponding rules, all others seemed obviously weak or even could not survive.</p><p>This was the reflection of the Afflatus King’s inner cave. Within a specific range, when a word was uttered, it would be accompanied by law. If heaven and earth were not in order, then it would be altered to fit!</p><p>It was very close to the legend… Meng Qi was in mid-air with waves lapped around him, hooking his blood veins, to turn himself into a puddle of purulent blood and merge with the marine world.</p><p>Afflatus was indeed the Demon King of the West!</p><p>He watched as the goldfish spirit draped over its war armor, lifted his giant hammer, and bellowed with rage, charging out of the Crystal Palace to attack him. Meng Qi felt a surge of overwhelming emotions at this moment.</p><p>When he first entered this world, it was almost impossible for him to escape from the little monster, Benbo’erba from the West. But after much painstaking effort, he forcibly managed to slash him to death, and today, he could even confront the famed Afflatus King from the Journey to the West without any fear. Things changed over time, and he was no longer who he was before, causing others to lament about the uncontrollable time and the miracle of fate.</p><p>Then, he stretched out his right hand, his five mighty yet slender fingers gripped onto the long unadorned handle of the Invincible Blade.</p><p>The Afflatus King grabbed a dazzling golden giant hammer in each hand as his inner body’s cave altered, followed by a surging flood from the outside world, isolated and forced against the Principle of Nature.</p><p>Even with the cultivation of a Celestial Being, as long as it was not near to the legend, it might be impossible for a person to escape and save their lives even if this person fell into their own flooding world!</p><p>The cow-nose looking creature faced the stranger, thinking about the ill-informed monk not known from which remote mountain was dared to step into his domain.</p><p>Such ignorant and ungrateful!</p><p>“Only water alone, only I am the best!” he roared as he launched a sudden attack alongside the giant hammer with a terrifying world-annihilating aura. The flood formed into water belts with all the layers restraining Meng Qi, immobilizing him from using half of his external force.</p><p>At this instant, the Afflatus King’s vision blurred, and he lost sight of Meng Qi as if he had vanished without a trace from the flooding world!</p><p>The Afflatus King’s thoughts spun with the Qi Ji dragging, he furiously lifted his head, penetrating through the gurgling water to look up high in the sky which was thousands of miles. An illusionary bubbling fire rose, painting a canvas of purple heaven and earth. There was a sense of ubiquity, somehow like the celestial world back then, while above the purple heaven and earth was a layer of a chaotic world of red, green, yellow, and white. Similarly, it was close to everywhere like the Heavenly Court in former years.</p><p>Above two layers of the Celestial World was a young monk dressed in a water gown with a hand behind his back and another hand holding the sword, looking down at him!</p><p>Is he closely related to the Legendary Celestial Being? This frightened the Afflatus King.</p><p>That’s not right! If it is close to the Legendary Celestial Being, then why my reflection of the cave was a normal world, yet he stands above those two layers of heaven and earth like the Celestial World?</p><p>Meng Qi’s pupils blackened, and he raised his right arm in a rather slow yet rushing manner. A calm voice was emitted as if it was from the Fairy God that was responsible for Heaven’s Punishment,</p><p>“The cardiac acupuncture point is a fire that hides the spirit. This is derived from my heart, the Yuan Xin Tian.”</p><p>“The liver raises the wind, the spleen nurtures the earth, the liver stores the water, and the heart stokes the fire, every part plays an important role for budding, growth, killing, and deep state of concealing, where the four roles could form the beginning!”</p><p>“Thou enjoys blood sacrifice and swallows the children. With such deep sins, today I will punish you on behalf of heaven!”</p><p>The words reverberated across the atmosphere, it agitated the Afflatus King into a state of great fury, however, there was a sudden loud snap. The Invincible Blade fell which was followed by a stroke of purple lighting shooting down.</p><p>With the protection of the two layers of the Celestial World, the flood of heaven and earth could not repel that stroke of lightning, only able to split into parts, as though a big tree was growing roots. Along with the nature of water, it split up to the top part of the Afflatus King’s head within seconds and engulfed his entire body.</p><p>With one slash of the sword, the Five Lightnings rumbled horrendously, with one swing of a sword, it flattened the Spirited Mountain, and produced a tactical formation!</p><p>The Afflatus King snorted, the two golden giant hammers weightlessly floated up. The flood around the surroundings became transparent, forming the purest coat of water.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>The lightning could not break through that coat of water, the Invincible Blade was blocked by the giant hammer, the flooding world trembled continuously, causing the Shui Ze below to shake violently and the marine family to become dizzy from the quake which was incredibly unbearable.</p><p>If it was not for the absorption of the after effect by the reflection of the cave from the outside world, with only one strike, it was already able to destroy them completely.</p><p>“Great!” Meng Qi raised his Invincible Blade once more and slashing his sword downward. All the universe of his acupuncture points universe contracted, returned to the Celestial World, and unleashed a billow of dark chaotic auspicious cloud, while above the auspicious cloud was an ancient and vast flag.</p><p>The Pangu Flag swayed, and the beam of the Invincible Blade flashed through, silently splitting the flooding world apart.</p><p>As Meng Qi split heaven and earth and nothing would be unbreakable for he did not reserve his power!</p><p>When he studied the Journey to the West, he was always unhappy of the Demon Kings who were the riders of a certain Fairy God or the pets of a certain Bodhisattva. Consequently, there was always a need for redemption to return to before without having to pay the full price, especially the Afflatus King. He couldn’t care less about the lives of the young boys and girls he had affected. It was undeniable that he had to be punished, even if he would end up having broken bones or scattered ashes as it could not be compared to the sufferings he had committed. In the end, what could have been an easy victory for the Great Sage Equalling Heaven to perform an act before him by forcing him to back down to preserve his honor before the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva.</p><p>Yet again, Afflatus has not learned from his evil ways. As a chivalrous person, will I let him go so easily?</p><p>If heaven does not punish you, then I shall punish you with my own hands. If the Bodhisattva does not condemn, I will!</p><p>Because of this, as the request to meet the Afflatus King was rejected, without holding back, Meng Qi blocked the Main Entrance of Ju Ze and was ready for a fight.</p><p>As the blade beam flashed through, reaching before the Afflatus King who was supposed to be prepared for a battle, was shocked. He sensed the danger of being slaughtered into half.</p><p>Without thinking of anything else, the ripples of water around the Afflatus King drifted, and his body suddenly split into two, and from two became four, becoming into rows of golden fish spirits.</p><p>With a swing of his sword, the initial presence of Afflatus in the imaginary bubbles burst, the rest of his virtual shadow had vanished as well, there was only him left at that corner.</p><p>This was no illusion trick, but the combination of effects of water ripples from the legendary projection against foes magical power was nowhere near the level of legendary. Without the corresponding reflection of the cave, it was extremely hard to achieve practical results.</p><p>“Aaah, receive the attack from my hammer!” the Afflatus King who had received a deathly blow wailed. The flooding world suddenly receded upward, with chaotic ripples left below, deep beneath their mirage spawned a creature that was conceived from Afflatus, after that it morphed into water rippling stars.</p><p>The stars flew out of the ripples connected, a vast and majestic aura of the stars suddenly appeared, the flooding world trembled violently, many marine creatures from Ju Ze floated to the surface of the lake, their bellies flopping upward as they were already dead.</p><p>Splash! The two golden hammers turned into two leading stars which stunningly converged, creating a galaxy of twinkling stars. It rose erratically, trying to engulf the whole Yuan Xin Tian and the Four Divisions Sky.</p><p>Splash! The gloomy clouds over the Northeastern Precinct of Nanzhan State gathered, it rained like cats and dogs, as if forecasting an apocalypse.</p><p>Splash! The water level rose violently, and almost half of the mountain peaks had been submerged.</p><p>The Heavenly River trembled and the Giant Hammer was heavy. It was total darkness for the Afflatus King; and he could only see a few universes appear behind the two young monks which brought forth an earth-shattering effect, judging from their appearance. One positioned his right hand and pressed downward, and another had eyes that shot forward beams of light, fusing with the young monk’s chaotic auspicious clouds and then flying out to engulf the stars of the Milky Way.</p><p>All the massiveness and flood were gone in an instant.</p><p>Is this direct knowledge? The Afflatus King was startled and trembling at his wits. He flung his giant hammer wildly, optimizing his direct knowledge fully to fight against Meng Qi.</p><p>Yet, the more he fought the more he was shocked, even as he utilized his full potential, no one seemed to be on the higher ground of the other, and his enemy seemed to have reserved his power!</p><p>Does the legend ever exist such a creature?</p><p>He wanted to retreat, so he feigned an attack, letting the flooding world to abruptly collapse to defend himself from his enemy, while he dug into Ju Ze and had every intention to resist with the Restrictive Spell he had arranged long ago.</p><p>It would be no risk at all!</p><p>Overlooking Ju Ze, the waves rolled, and suddenly the view before the Afflatus King changed to endless darkness as well as an infinite vastness, and there were only flickering stars in the distance.</p><p>Did I fly to space?</p><p>At this moment, he noticed an ancient majestic statue of god, above his head was the Premier Auspicious Cloud, while it stood on the Four Divisions of Chaos, surrounding it was golden lotuses, its six limbs wielded the ancient seals and weapons, as if the heaviest planet rested on its shoulders, making itself a tiny bit of dust.</p><p>Above meant below, left meant right, he reversed his direction, so the act of him getting into the Crystal Palace turned into the sky? The Afflatus King who had just come to a realization saw a handsome monk who was holding a long sword with a smile on his face emerged from his left, declaring the Moniker,</p><p>“Namo Statue of the Sacred Buddha, this poor monk has come to aid you!”</p><p>At the same time, a swordsman drifted forward in the sky from the right, and exclaimed coldly,</p><p>“Let me help you, my fellow friend!”</p><p>From behind, a giant figure over-stuffed like the size of a galaxy emerged, unable to be described with the phrase catching stars and snatching moons. His magnificent voice was able to tremble the galaxy,</p><p>“Let me help you, my fellow friend!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
