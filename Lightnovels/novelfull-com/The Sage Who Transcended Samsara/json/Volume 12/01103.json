But after that, he overflowed with joy, and his whole body quivered with honor and confidence as he entered the right Master Sect and had the right patriarch!</p><p>The comment section was quiet for a while, before it was refreshed crazily:</p><p>“Evil Demons like this should have reached the status of Earth Fairy or Transcendent, right?”</p><p>“This is really as if plucking a hair that is thicker than my thighs…”</p><p>“In the Nine Levels of the Underground, the skills of Evil Demons and Evil Gods can both accelerate. Those who are stronger can even level up to another state, but all the other Gods, Buddhas, and Fairies will be suppressed, or even fall off their original status. It should be similar in the Endless Sea. Under such circumstances, the Primitive Emperor could still kill the enemy so easily, demonstrating just how powerful he is!”</p><p>“As expected of who I think is number one on the Heavenly List!”</p><p>“Evil Demons of the Earth Fairy or Transcendent status… he must be covered with treasure. His blood and flesh contains mighty power, his bones and scales could be made into apparatuses. Excuse me, let me just wipe off my drool…”</p><p>The comment section paused following this sentence because including Fei Zhengtao, all eyes were on the gigantic body of the Evil Demon.</p><p>“I wonder how much Primitive Emperor Coin I can earn just by selling one from any piece from his corpse…”</p><p>“An Evil Demon’s blood and flesh at this level must be capable of deriving. It can be reproduced into top level healing medicines after removing the dirt…”</p><p>“I want to go to Antarctica, I want to go to the desert!”</p><p>Everyone at the scene was so hyped up and agitated, causing Fei Zhengtao to be restless, too. He couldn’t wait to get across, keep the remaining corpse of the Evil Demon and convert it into Primitive Emperor Coin. Then, he can shop crazily in the Myriad World Mall for something like the Golden Sage Robe that he has been longing for.</p><p>Fuck, how dare you rob the Jade Palace! In Kunlun Mountain, Daqinggen’s stems extended, and its eyes were filled with anger.</p><p>Everything in the Jade Palace is for me to collect!</p><p>I would be affluent for a very long time if the old man would just spill some out between his fingers!</p><p>It brought along a bundle of baggage with it, ready to head to the western region to dispose of the trash and clean up the battlefield.</p><p>At the same time, something popped out in the comment section:</p><p>“Stay calm, this is the plunder of the Primitive Emperor!”</p><p>The rest of the audience suddenly came to a realization, followed by arising doubts: “Why didn’t the Primitive Emperor just keep it? Why did he have to throw it to the Antarctic Desert?”</p><p>“Maybe the White Mustard Ring was not spacious enough to take it in? Such a huge Evil Demon…” someone came out with their own answer.</p><p>“Bah, were you seriously thinking that the Earth Fairies and Transcendent still use the White Mustard King like you? They have already achieved the Interior Realm or are close to the cave or perhaps have evolved into the cave. How can they be unable to take in a few mountains?” someone objected on the spot.</p><p>“Perhaps he didn’t have the time to collect it?”</p><p>“He had the time to throw it out, so how could he not have the time to collect it?”</p><p>Predictions emerged and were refuted one by one. Suddenly, someone came out with an absurd idea at the end of the discussion:</p><p>“Could it be that the Primitive Emperor threw it out intentionally for us to see?”</p><p>Threw it out intentionally… intentionally… Fei Zhengtao and everyone else were stunned, followed by chuckles as they said, “How could the Primitive Emperor be so superficial?”</p><p>“Right, right, no matter what, this was still the first ever live battle of Dharmakaya!”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, even though the battle was at the deep end of the Endless Sea, and it was difficult for us to peek, I was still satisfied by just looking at the outcome of the battle. We can’t just wait for the once again delayed battle of the God of Swords, right?”</p><p>They achieved the status of Transcendent together and had their own path. Mister Luda and Su Wing mutually delayed their battle day once again. They planned to hold it when one of them or both of them had reached the peak of Transcendent, got close to Legend and were looking to break through. This way, they could verify the paths and motivate each other to create the opportunity for a breakthrough.</p><p>There was an explosive amount of people in the live chat, discussions doubled up by pages in a flash. Fei Zhengtao was looking at it diligently, while Daqinggen had also left his baggage aside to think about how he could flatter the old man to get some random prizes. As a plant, it was struggling to live.</p><p>…</p><p>In the Endless Sea, Meng Qi punched Liang Luo to death with one punch and threw its broken body parts out. He remained in the condition of dark soul and Evil Demon, sinking towards the dark and deep end in the sea to investigate the origin of the abrupt change in the sea that Monk Sha mentioned.</p><p>He was not worried about meeting the real legend of the Nine Levels of Underground, because abrupt changes would have arose in the place and engulfed the desert if the Evil Demons at this Heavenly Tribulation entered the Endless Sea at the moment. Also, being able to enter the Endless Sea indicated its ability to befall at the Real World. A mighty person of the Legendary Realm would be able to sweep through the world even without any assistance from the Nine Levels of Underground. Everything except forces with especially concrete foundations were equivalent to rotten wood in front of him. Meng Qi hoped that he could destroy the lot so that the Moonlight Buddha could find an excuse to be involved in the fight.</p><p>He was afraid that Monk Sha would be the only one that could contend for supremacy now in this universe. But this familiar face from the West had been untrackable after leaving the Jade Palace. No one knew what the Ajati Matriarch had sent him to do.</p><p>Since there wasn’t any incident about the legends of the Nine Levels of Underground invading the world wantonly, Meng Qi could be sure that they could not enter the Endless Sea temporarily, while he himself proved the essence of Transcendent, so he could accelerate almost the level of a Legend. With his martial arts cultivation, Fairy Slaying Wu’Ji, Dao Yi Kai Tian, and other various arts, he was confident that he could defeat all Evil Demons that are below the Legendary level. If he wasn’t trapped in their great tactical formation, he could come and go whenever he wants.</p><p>This was also one of the reasons why Meng Qi only came to explore the Endless Sea after he had successfully made a breakthrough.</p><p>As for Mister Luda and the others, their ability at the Nine Levels of Underground would fall at least by one state while the Evil Demons on the other side would accelerate. Adding and deducting, maybe those who have just entered the state of Earth Fairy would be able to defeat them. Therefore, exploring the Endless Sea was a very dangerous thing to do, they should never recklessly enter into the sea.</p><p>Meng Qi was surrounded by layers of universe. It was so dark and dull, reflecting chaotic and lunatic conditions, and caused him who was pale as paper and extremely gloomy to be similar to that of the Ghost Emperor at the Nine Levels of Underground or Devil God. It caused the Evil Demons and gods whose Black Gas were concealed everywhere to escape from the scene as they were afraid to approach him. If the Divine Creator and the incarnation of the universe were negative reflections, then the universe that they were in would often be despairing and horrific.</p><p>Then, the Black Gas surrounding him surged silently. Everything was silent to the point as if it was deadly still.</p><p>In this situation where there wasn’t a single movement, and this surrounding where there was nothing but Black Gas, Meng Qi sunk rapidly, deeper and deeper into the dark. The passing of time slowly felt dreamy and imaginary, everything seemed blurry without comparison, causing one to lose his space sense.</p><p>Then, after an unknown period, Meng Qi stepped on a solid object and sunk. He looked at it and found out that it was a huge mountain, which was supposed to be something that the Transcendents transferred here to block the Endless Sea in the Middle Ages.</p><p>Boom! The mountain shook when the tip of Meng Qi’s foot touched it. Then, white, sticky and huge worms suddenly crawled out from the rocks that were drowned in darkness. They were shaking their heads and tails as they escaped hurriedly. The vast amount of worms was absolutely horrific.</p><p>Meng Qi couldn’t be bothered with them. He used his divine sense to explore the area below. He saw an empty mountain with dense holes on it while below it, there was an enchantment covered by layers of light shining with dim azure gold. It was like a path that extended infinitely, like the bottom of the Endless Sea.</p><p>But below that, the Black Gas was still surging, and it appeared to be increasingly filled by death wills and evil wills, covered in a layer of frightening void.</p><p>The void isolated the sea from time, preventing Meng Qi from peeking into anything below it.</p><p>“Seems like the Nine Levels of Underground really did conceal and disconnect itself with the Real World in the first place,” looking at this layer of void, Meng Qi nodded while seemingly deep in thought.</p><p>The Nine Levels of Underground and the Nine Levels of Heaven were opposite each other, they must have corresponded changes following the fall of the Heavenly Court and the near destruction of the Nine Levels of Heaven. This was not because of gnosis but an instinctive evolvement, it was just like if he emptied halfway up the mountain, the tip of it would definitely collapse. With the falling of the Demonic Lord and negative factors like the Cruel Priest being defeated by the Demonic Sage, it was very much possible for self-concealment.</p><p>“Now that the Final Trial is approaching, the Nine Levels of Underground are reconnecting again with the Real World, but the enchantment was created by an unknown Great Medium at an unknown era, causing this connection to be slow and also restrict the abilities of Evil Demons who enters the Endless Sea,” Meng Qi’s eyes shot out black and white lights that were two feet long. He observed the light golden enchantment closely, and discovered that it was slowly eroded by death and evil thoughts. Following the increase in connections of the Nine Levels of Underground and the Real World, it seemed like it would collapse at any time. He could already imagine the chaotic situation when the time came…</p><p>So these are the abrupt changes at the Endless Sea that the Ajati Matriarch mentioned?</p><p>He had to find a way to strengthen the enchantment of the tactical formation at this level! Meng Qi was just thinking about it when a purplish red eye reflected in his field of vision. There was no pupil in the eye, and it looked so vicious and evil. It was staring at him across the void and the enchantment!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Meng Qi’s real spirit was substantially attacked but it was absorbed by the Wu’Ji Seal. He did not have a single sign of backing off in his eyes. He stared at the purplish red eye from afar.</p><p>Which mighty person of the Nine Levels of Underground is this?</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Black Gas surged as it filled the void. The enchantments vibrated continuously, but it calmed down at the end while the purplish red eye disappeared.</p><p>“Who was that?” Meng Qi frowned, he did not know much about the Legendary of the Nine Levels of Underground, so he could not recognize someone just by looking at his eyes. Looks like he would have to ask Senior Brother Qi later.</p><p>He tried to concentrate. The moment the Dao Yi Lamp lit up, heavens rotated, the legendary traits emerged and its vision changed with it. He kept the micro structures in the light golden enchantment into his eyes so that he could search for a way to strengthen or upgrade them when he goes back.</p><p>The only question was that the Endless Sea has most traits that the Nine Levels of Underground has, many things would be weakened here. Even those of the Legendary level will have less than ten percent of their power. What did they have to defend themselves from the powerful Evil Demons who had the assistance of the Nine Levels of Underground?</p><p>Of course, Meng Qi never dreamed of enjoying after one battle, because following the gradual awakening of the mighty people of the Nine Levels of Underground and the Great Medium, even with the tactical formation of the Nirvana Realm level, it would not be able to sustain for a long time. He thought of trying his best to delay the shattering of the enchantment and to fill the void in order to gain time for the Transcendents of the Real World, including himself, to attack the Legendary.</p><p>“What I got was inclined to the martial arts with little tactical formations and sealing arts. The Fairy Slaying Sword Formation did not have a legendary object to suppress it, so I reckon I’ll have to ask for big brother’s help…” Meng Qi softly nodded. He recorded the structure of the tactical formation, then, he jumped and escaped out of the Endless Sea, befalling at the Great Zhou Dynasty’s Changle in a flash.</p><p>Gao Lan got the full version of the Emperor’s Golden Book, with martial arts and of course, tactical formations and sealing arts in it.</p><p>As the Emperor’s younger brother, Meng Qi has the authority to enter Chang Le palace city right away. He befell and appeared in the palace, in front of Gao Lan.</p><p>Gao Lan was sitting on the Dragon Chair in his bright yellow emperor’s robe, playing with the Myriad World Talisman in his hand, surfing for something. He sighed after sensing Meng Qi,</p><p>“The current generation’s Mysterious Fairy is about to prove the essence of Nirmanakaya.”</p><p>Meng Qi twitched and said, “Imperial brother, what weird group have you entered into again?”</p><p>“Oh, the Mysterious Fairy is about to make a breakthrough?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
