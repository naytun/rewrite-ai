The light shone through the Shifang World and brightened up the darkness around the ancient Fusang tree. It was like the Loving Mother Ormazd who waited for the wanderer to come home during the end of the world. It was waiting for the attack from Shaoxuan and Xi’e quietly. Where there was fire, ashes could be seen falling down from nowhere.</p><p>Although he was an enlightened priest in the ancient times, he got more benefits when he served the Immortal Woman and was close to the Creation Realm. However, he was not as powerful as he used to be as he had woken up earlier than expected. As he faced the attacks of the two Legendaries, faced the Tyrant’s Invincible Blade and the Last Ship, even though he spoke with confidence, in reality he did not dare to neglect and relax. He gave up the initiative to attack, and protected the Shifang Wanderer Glaze Boundary that he set up previously. He helped Sha Wujing get rid of the hidden trouble that was the Immortal Woman, took that thing, and fought for enough time.</p><p>When they reached the Legendary realm, knew the I am who I am, understood that appearances could not be relied on, and were able to remove limitations and understood the situation, under such clear circumstances, how could Shaoxuan and Xi’e not understand the intention of the Celestial Lamp Ambassador?</p><p>Without any hesitation, Shaoxuan stepped into the Last Ship, and stood next to Xi’e. They drove the giant ship slowly toward the brightly lit place.</p><p>The layers of prohibitions on the deck of the ship were floating, mingled into Marks of Dao, and formed a moist and faint golden brilliance. Holy Virtue and Meritorious Virtues were all set. There were sparks caused by the friction upon touching the light that shone out from the Wanderer Lamp. It flickered up and down, and flowed left and right. It seemed like it would be lightened up anytime.</p><p>However, even if the sparks were like wild winds and huge waves, the Last Ship was not affected nor was it damaged. In fact, the light avoided it automatically. It remained its stance as it sailed through the places where the light shone on the Sea of Suffering.</p><p>Although the Last Ship did not put in all its efforts, lacked many abilities, was difficult to be known as peerless, but it was originally made to overcome the Final Trial and enter into the next era. It belonged to the Sea of Suffering’s Precious Raft, and its base was its power to defend. This ability enabled it to be compared favorably with the peerless object and was able to bring its strengths into play while it was sailing on the Shifang Wanderer Glaze Boundary!</p><p>The lights were like water as it formed into a sea. The ship was navigating on it before it split into waves and approached the Celestial Lamp Ambassador.</p><p>But it was right at this moment that Xi’e and Shaoxuan saw the sudden changes before their eyes. Although it was still the Shifang Wanderer Glaze Boundary and there were still waves of light, but the Celestial Lamp Ambassador in front suddenly disappeared, leaving only a lamp wick that was burning quietly. An addition of dark liquid with a similar texture to oil appeared in the surroundings.</p><p>Lamp wick?</p><p>Xi’e’s heart tingled, she matched her Divine Sense with the Last Ship, and instantly explored all the areas like a tentacle. Then, she saw the handsome face of the Celestial Lamp Ambassador who was standing at the infinity peak. He was looking down at the two of them from above.</p><p>The glaze boundary was over the distance, and it seemed like a lamp.</p><p>This is… her heart tingled. She combined everything that she saw, and grasped the current situation.</p><p>For some reason, they had entered the Last Ship of the Shifang Wanderer Glaze Boundary, and by following the lights, they had strangely driven toward that celestial glaze lamp!</p><p>At this very moment, Shaoxuan and herself were not at the outside world, but in the lamp. They were approaching toward the lamp wick!</p><p>What a good way to hoodwink people!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>When Xi’e became clear of the situation at hand, Shaoxuan had also understood what they have encountered. He prepared his blade, and hit out the Wanfang Holy Virtue Holy Light.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Layers upon layers of worlds were highlighted, civilizations appeared, and the flames of stars gathered and brightened up the cold and dark universe. All kinds of colors such as red, green, yellow, white, and black were gathered. Each of it represented the different parts of humanity. It transformed into a colorful moistened water flow, and with the power of man which could conquer nature, it blended into the Invincible Blade. Finally, it activated the Thunder of Heaven.</p><p>Everything which was purple, green, colorful, unreal, chaotic, and fierce-looking were formed into a ball. Each strike of thunder with different colors became water, and it seemed like they were back to their initial form as it formed out an ancient and vicissitude thunder pond. Combined with the Holy Virtue Brilliance that could infiltrate everything, it twisted into a spiral and attacked the Celestial Lamp Ambassador with great strength and vigor.</p><p>Wherever the blade’s beam passed, the lights would avoid it and not harm it. In the blink of an eye, it was almost in front of the Celestial Lamp Ambassador.</p><p>The Celestial Lamp Ambassador appeared to be pleased. With a solemn gaze, he spread out the other hand of his which was not holding the glaze lamp. His five fingers were close together, his palm was like jade, and the surface went transparent instantly. Each of the Marks of Dao were highlighted, and actually transformed into a mirror which was full of mystery.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>The blade beam chopped the mirror, but it was rebounded back directly. The Last Ship was able to stabilize it reluctantly after it lit up with a dull shade of gold and the Meritorious Virtues yowled.</p><p>A deep scorch mark was left at the center of the mirror.</p><p>The few rounds of fierce battle which occurred rather quickly were hung in balance.</p><p>…</p><p>Sha Wujing’s eyes were dimmed as he used the Air-Conveyance Technique to travel to the ancient Fusang tree which seemed to have a distance of a universe. From time to time, there would be a crackling sound coming from beside him, and sparks of ashes would float out from the dim light which shone upwards.</p><p>The whole area of the ancient Fusang tree was full of these creepy monsters that came from unknown places which were difficult to kill. Even the mighty people of the Legendary Realm would fall into it. This was because, if there was no corresponding method, it would be difficult to sense these monsters. No one knew where they hid that they could even escape from the senses of a Legend. In fact, their attacks were weird, it seemed like they were dragging the Legendary being down from a high level state of life.</p><p>What were they transformed from?</p><p>Could it be something related to God Hao Tian or Eastern Emperor Taiyi?</p><p>During the Air-Conveyance Technique, a lot of thoughts ran around Sha Wujing’s head. He was thinking about the strange things that have happened in the ancient Fusang tree area. Fortunately, the Immortal Woman gave him the Wanderer Lamp, which allowed the Celestial Lamp to be brought into the Real World. Otherwise, he would really have no idea on how to defeat these weird monsters. With every step, there would most definitely be interruption from other forces.</p><p>However, when it almost reached the tree top, the light of the Wanderer Lamp could not shine through, so he could only rely on himself.</p><p>“I’m no longer the me who was not at a high realm during the Pilgrimage to the West, the useless Sha Monk…” Sha Wujing’s apathetic eyes flashed with a glimmer of light, it seemed like he wanted to prove something.</p><p>A conveyance light flew by, and all of a sudden the surroundings turned dark. However, it was not completely dark, the mori folium and branches were bathed in daylight and shone with flames. It looked as if the night was filled with torches at the outdoors.</p><p>Sha Wujing touched the White Bone Glaze Beads that hung in front of his chest. Internally, he was shining around. He slowed down his speed and walked step by step in order to guard against sudden attacks from those weird monsters.</p><p>After flying for awhile, he noticed that everything was fine and nothing strange happened. However, this made Sha Wujing even more worried. There must be something weird going on when things are out of the ordinary!</p><p>After a short while, Sha Wujing’s eyes were brightened as he saw the peak of the ancient Fusang tree.</p><p>One of the tree leaves transformed into a mountain stacked with white flowers. A green grave was surrounded by the white flowers. Beyond the green grave, stood a stone monument with a line of handwritten words.</p><p>Sha Wujing read it out word by word:</p><p>“Here lies the grave of husband, Meng Qi!”</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The sound of thunder rumbled loudly below, and the ancient Fusang tree shook slightly. Shaoxuan, Xi’e, and the Celestial Lamp Ambassador had collided with each other violently.</p><p>Sha Wujing’s heart tingled. He sensed something and looked to the side. He saw a figure who was standing quietly at the top of another ancient tree. He wore a Yellow Emperor Robe and Heavenly Crown with tassels hanging down from it. It hid his face, and his aura was vicissitude and ancient.</p><p>He was staring at him!</p><p>…</p><p>In between the similarity and differentiation, an idea was coming up. Meng Qi seemed to have grasped something, and he rotated the real spirit naturally.</p><p>He relied on the experiences and insights of martial arts intuitively. He relied on the experiences and insights from the knowledge of earth. He relied on any kind of experiences and insights that he has gone through. It all transformed into glaze-like fragments, and while they flew out from the body, it did not leave himself. In fact, it circled around the surroundings, and there were connection links that looked like star lights.</p><p>At this moment, he was like an opened umbrella. The efforts made were at the external realm, while the congenital nature was in the internal. However, they were not completely separated as they were still connected, and formed into a whole.</p><p>Where there was a positive, there would be a negative; where there is Yin, there is Yang. The man-made efforts and congenital nature were comparative, thus it was difficult to distinguish between right and wrong. The congenital nature would be infected by the man-made effort, and the man-made effort would also be affected by congenital nature. So, the congenital nature would have slight changes when it is affected by the man-made effort. Let go of anything that should be let go instead of throwing everything away, it was just like the Tai Chi Map. As spoken by Qiang Ji, Yang was hidden in Yin, Yin is followed by Yang.</p><p>Various modes of thinking were formed by fragments through the same starlight connection links, and circled around Meng Qi’s surroundings. Meanwhile, the connection with self-contact had slight changes and constructed slight differences.</p><p>The modes of thinking circled around, when he was without the strength of martial arts, and without the knowledge of earth. When he became a mouse, Meng Qi maintained an everlasting established self. Looking at them, he could see his similarities and differences.</p><p>He could not see himself directly. However, he could see something from other external factors. By combining all these, Meng Qi seemed to be able to recognize himself more, and more and more memory fragments flew out and circled around. The true self was getting clearer and clearer. It seemed like it was slightly resonating with the infinity peak.</p><p>The corresponding experiences and insights about the State of Mind Cultivation Base flew out, too. The way Meng Qi saw and thought were different. Everything was dark and chaotic, presented in their initial form. However, this did not mean that he could not think. Because the different man-made effort experiences and insights were still connected, he could not hide himself.</p><p>In the dark, Meng Qi looked over with the Ji eyes. There was nothing about time in front, no void above and below, nothing about the beginning of everything. It was indeed a congenital nature.</p><p>At this moment, he realized that there was a priest sitting in the middle of the chaos. It was a priest who could not be described by words.</p><p>“You are…” Meng Qi’s heart tingled, and he blurted out accidentally.</p><p>The priest stood up slowly and spoke with a massive voice that was filled with vicissitude and ancient intent:</p><p>“I am Yuanshi.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
