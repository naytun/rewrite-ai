He looked like he was mumbling to himself but he was actually questioning him.</p><p>“The route to the Nirvana Realm paved by the Qing Emperor has been uncommon right from the beginning. Sometimes he appears as the Qing Emperor; sometimes he is in the form of Lord Taiyi Savior. The reason for him to be able to survive to this day in all these different forms isn’t because he escaped from the River of Time, but due to all kinds of secret spells. After the Medicine Buddha’s awakening through your hands, he started to universalize his past. He returned to the beginning of the ancient era with identities like Chunyangzi, Eastern-Sun Deity, Medicine Buddha, Lord Taiyi Saviour, Green Emperor, and more. Now he must occupy the future as well in order to truly reach the Nirvana Realm,” the Moonlight Bodhisattva said solemnly.</p><p>“Therefore, he is now in the future.”</p><p>These aren’t some eloquent words but the truth!</p><p>Meng Qi once again gained new perceptions about the Qing Emperor’s expedition after listening to the Moonlight Bodhisattva’s detailed explanation. It was unnecessary for the Qing Emperor to eliminate Lord Taiyi Savior and Medicine Buddha, transform into Chunyangzi and Eastern-Sun Deity, and forget the past as well as get puzzled by his own true identity. With his own realm, the Qing Emperor could simply hibernate to survive until now. However, all his experiences and memories would only prove how long he has lived, they would not help in bringing him back to the past.</p><p>All pioneers deserve respect!</p><p>“How can we find him then?” Meng Qi asked worriedly. He could only detect the scour of the River of Time and control the fate marginally with his current state of Nirvana Realm. How could he travel to the future?</p><p>Even the Seven-Kill Tablet could only bring him back to the past!</p><p>More importantly, there were so many uncertainties and countless branches in the future. Those without adequate Fruit of Dao could never occupy the entire future, nobody even knew which branch the Qing Emperor went to!</p><p>The Moonlight Bodhisattva fell silent for a while before a smirk appeared on his face.</p><p>…</p><p>Despite the fact that the ancient Great Sages like the Bull Demon King were being weakened and restricted by the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation, Shaoxuan and Xi’e were all set to put up a good fight. Regardless of the Last Ship drifting amidst the boundless sky and was ready for their escape at any time, they were careful and buckled down to battle.</p><p>But now, the sash-wrapped youngster equipped with a long spear and Wind Fire Wheels could maneuver around anywhere from all directions in the form of three heads and six arms. With the spear dancing and sash flying through the air, he subdued all the ancient Great Sages by himself easily including the Bull Demon King, the Roc Demon King, the Dragon Demon King, and others. Aside from the Bull Demon King, the other Great Sages were so pathetic that they could only form an alliance to counteract.</p><p>Looking at Nezha who was at ease and agile, Shaoxuan and Xi’e were nonchalant.</p><p>The Bull Demon King was becoming more and more low-spirited in the battle. Nezha alone could never defeat him if he was not besieged by the Gods of the Heavenly Court back then. The Bull Demon King could proudly say that Nezha was no better than him. They were equally matched as the Bull Demon King had not fully recovered and Nezha had regained consciousness earlier than others.</p><p>What disgusted the Bull Demon King was that the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation had bounded his powers, most importantly the ubiquitous technique. As a result, Nezha had struck and fled as he wished and he was even able to attack the brothers simultaneously. The situation forced the Bull Demon King and the brothers to the wall.</p><p>His flashing speed from his wings were of no use when it encountered the ubiquitous technique!</p><p>As for Qingqiu, Glow, and Raka, the ever arrogant Nezha couldn’t care less about them, not to mention attack them.</p><p>Due to the constraint of the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation, the victory skewed to Nezha’s side in this battle between those that were well-matched. It reminded the Bull Demon King of the trauma of being burned harshly by Nezha and beheading.</p><p>There was no interference from the Heavenly Deities this time. Yet, there was still the Fairy Slaying Sword Formation.</p><p>Despite the incompleteness, the top fatal formation in the Archaeozoic Era was definitely legitimate!</p><p>…</p><p>The overflowing icy power from the Celestial Vase engulfed the purple electricity sword beam and turned the surroundings into a dusky frozen land. The place looked like the ancient Icy Killing Formation with sword-like icebergs floating around.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei could no longer exert the ubiquitous technique around three Ambassadors at the frozen land. She could only blink around the edges and utilize her swordsmanship. However, all she did could never break the shield put up by the cautious Feng Dian, Zhang Dian, and Bao Ping. Furthermore, she could barely dodge the sudden attack by their magical arts. Fortunately, the Invincible Blade was sensitive enough to help her detect the charge in advance, therefore she could escape just under the wire. Without other choices, she watched helplessly as the Ambassadors put the Restrictive Spell of Zhou Cheng and destroyed six doors and a few yamen. The representation of ruling by the Great Zhou was being demolished and the Luo Sect followers were coming out to gain control of the place.</p><p>She was too defenseless to do something to stop the damage as there was more than one Ambassador to fight against.</p><p>Suddenly, a figure so familiar yet foreign appeared out of nowhere. The man looked a lot like her master but with a hint of calmness and silvery hair.</p><p>“Who are you?” she asked.</p><p>The man replied in a low-pitched voice, “I am Lu Wuming.”</p><p>Lu Wuming? Jiang Zhiwei was confused upon hearing his name.</p><p>While bright lights were driving away the illusion, the Celestial Lamp Ambassador noticed the newly arisen enemy and laughed out loud, “Isn’t this the secret spell for Amalgamation? Su Wuming and Lu Da? There is no use even if both of you had complementary characteristics and merged into a whole one. Don’t forget the most important thing in the legend. You are neither Su Wuming nor Lu Da now. You have nothing but mere energy and features, you are no different from the little girl beside you!”</p><p>Is he talking about the made-up legend created by Master and Senior Lu using the Secret Scripture of Amalgamate Methods? Jiang Zhiwei finally came to the realization while avoiding Celestial Ceremony Ambassador’s attack through the air with the ubiquitous technique. But the Celestial Lamp Ambassador just said that merging could not bring anything greater than mere energy and features, not to mention a made-up legend?</p><p>Lu Wuming dodged the attack stolidly without a word. Then, he swung his sword through the air with all his might. The slashing sword beams cut through the frozen land magnificently. The sword was as powerful as the Invincible Blade, but with a touch of augury.</p><p>The Celestial Vase Ambassador was only able to react right before the beam hit him. With a faint glow, a white lotus came out of his palms and blocked the invasive sword beam.</p><p>“The Great Wisdom Sword!” the Celestial Vase Ambassador muttered.</p><p>The unbeatable was not the merging body with mere energy and features, but the Great Wisdom Sword!</p><p>The Great Wisdom Sword was the legendary sword possessed by Manjushri and represents great wisdom in the Buddhist Society. The sword brought whole fulfillment and it was so clear that it could reflect everything. He never thought that he could catch a glimpse of this sword as it was rumored to have gone missing at the Spirited Mountain!</p><p>With this peerless sword, Lu Wuming was much more powerful now.</p><p>At the same time, the purple electricity beam was aimed to give the Celestial Vase Ambassador a strike.</p><p>On the other side, the Celestial Lamp Ambassador was waiting to launch his Wanderer Lamp and set up the enchantment to help his allies. Suddenly, a freezing coldness ran through his body, signaling the advent of critical danger.</p><p>He moved across on his instinct as a burning spearhead pierced through the void. The spear passed by where he was standing just now and stabbed the back of the Celestial Vase Ambassador.</p><p>Poof!</p><p>The Celestial Vase Ambassador burned down to ashes as he was pierced by the fire spear. A good-looking youngster pedaled on the Wind Fire Wheels and appeared in front of the Celestial Lamp Ambassador and Celestial Ceremony Ambassador.</p><p>“Nezha!” the two ambassadors exclaimed.</p><p>It was the ubiquitous technique!</p><p>In the midst of fire and light, the Celestial Vase Ambassador pathetically returned to his original form again. Without the characteristic of ‘Symbiosis of Projection and Main Body’ and his own survival divinity, the Celestial Vase Ambassador could never have survived the attack.</p><p>With a sly grin, the spear-armed Nezha vanished into thin air. However, the Ambassadors could not put down their defense as they were worried that there would be a deadly shot at any time.</p><p>The situation could not go on! After taking a glance at each other, they decided to make a last resort!</p><p>…</p><p>As Maitreya made his way to Guangling City, his arrival disintegrated the forces of living beings and the Restrictive Spell of neighboring cities. Some parts of the Jin Xiu Mountain River Map dissipated as well.</p><p>Maitreya was about to reply to the resonated chant of Namo Savior Maitreya Buddha in front of the city when he realized something strange. He pointed his hand toward the left and a white lotus dropped out of the void, transforming into a lotus throne.</p><p>Then, a spearhead came out of nowhere and pierced right on the lotus throne. Flames were blazing and ashes were scattered everywhere.</p><p>The appearance of Nezha clearly explained the strange feeling Maitreya sensed just now.</p><p>Suddenly, a shadow darted out and penetrated the Buddha Country. It emerged on Maitreya’s side abruptly. With its mouth opened wide and sharp teeth shown, the dark figure charged to bite Maitreya. Maitreya dodged it as best he could but his shoulder was still bitten. His golden body was injured in the process.</p><p>Fahualin and Damiaoxiang only realized that the dark figure was a ferocious black dog with smooth fur!</p><p>Close the door and release the Celestial Hound!</p><p>The Celestial Hound’s performance in frontal assault could be considered as average but it was exceptionally good at biting as a surprise attack. Yang Jian won so many battles in the past owing to this tactic of Celestial Hound. It was only natural that Meng Qi intended to put its surprise attack tactic to good use now.</p><p>It was his strategy to have the Celestial Hound in leading the attack when Maitreya was distracted by Nezha and him.</p><p>The huge bite almost got Maitreya falling down from the lotus throne. But the extraordinary Maitreya emitted a pale azure relic in an instant and flung it at the Celestial Hound, scaring it away.</p><p>…</p><p>Meng Qi was not too excited that he was at the brink of victory as the dog bit the soon-to-be Buddha. It was because he knew that all these deities including Maitreya, the Bull Demon King, and the Luo Sect Oracles have always had an alternative plan!</p><p>On top of that, it was really strange to see no action from all the other might people and the Great Medium to this day.</p><p>Nobody heard anything from the Demonic Monarch from Samsara line, the Seven-Kill Priest, or the Ancestors of Water.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
