As a result, the Buddhist Kingdom expanded, glaze spread, and white lotuses were all over the place.</p><p>The Bodhisattvas and Arhats who had originally surrounded Maitreya spread out, each sitting on a lotus flower, linked to each other and chanted together. With Fahualin and Damiaoxiang as the cardinals, they formed the fundamental enchanted boundary of Buddhism – the Thousand Buddha Formation!</p><p>In Spirited Mountain in the past, when Gautama Buddha was destroyed, and Amitabha and Bodhi Ancient Buddha had yet to strike, the Saha Pure Land laid a Thousand Buddha Formation with Ananda and Maha Kasyapa as its core as an attempt to resist the great sages led by the Demonic Sage, so as to delay until help from the Nirvana characters arrived.</p><p>Under the situation where only Nirvana characters could counter against Nirvana characters, even though Spirited Mountain was special, the courage to attack the Demonic Sage with the Thousand Buddha Formation was enough to show that the fundamental enchanted boundary was strong and indestructible.</p><p>Unfortunately, Ananda rebelled at the crucial moment and the Buddhas fell. The great formation only reappeared in the world today, but the Bodhisattvas and Arhats who laid the formation weren’t Buddhas after all, hence unable to reproduce its glory in ancient times and could not be considered as perfect.</p><p>Even so, Meng Qi who was looking down at the Buddhist Kingdom at a distance above still heard sounds of chanting, his nose filled with the smell of sandalwood, and the golden swastikas in his sight connected to form restrictive spells. Every swastika seemed to be formed from a golden-bodied Buddha, chanting in unison, “Boundless is the sea of sufferings, repentance is salvation!”</p><p>At this moment, the Buddhist Kingdom on earth seemed to have become an illusion of a giant glazed Buddha made up of many normal-sized golden-bodied Buddhas. Its face was blurry, golden in color, and full of vicissitudes.</p><p>Seeing the illusion formed by the Thousand Buddha Formation, Meng Qi seemed to see himself.</p><p>No, it wasn’t just himself, but also Tathagata.</p><p>The Tathagata Buddha!</p><p>This Thousand Buddha Formation cannot be underestimated, it can form an illusion of Buddha… Meng Qi looked over, feeling solemn.</p><p>Countless white lotuses and golden swastikas also flew at the place previously redeemed by Maitreya, merging into one with the enchanted boundary, forming part of the Buddhist Kingdom, such that he couldn’t recover those places for the time being, and also greatly reduced Maitreya’s previous achievements.</p><p>Maitreya was smiling, and his eyes squinted line like he was asleep. The shoulder of his golden body bitten by the Celestial Hound emitted light as it was slowly recovering.</p><p>Meng Qi was silent for a short while before he silently instructed the Celestial Hound and then laughed out, “Maitreya Buddha, let me try out this Thousand Buddha Formation!”</p><p>Just as he finished talking, his body suddenly expanded, and was even bigger than the Buddha Kingdom that covered most of Jiangdong – the giant against the giant Buddha!</p><p>The five fingers of his right hand bent one by one, forming a fist. The acupoints all over Meng Qi’s body opened up, showing the image of a vast universe. Inside every image was a brilliant galaxy flying out, intertwining into clouds and gathering at the fist. Just with his own acupoint universes and without mobilizing the strength of the projection, he already showed power close to the ordinary Legendary realm.</p><p>If his real self was here, there would also be Heavens of the Internal Realm to form the prototypes of multi-universes. This was also the main reason why Meng Qi could counter the four gods Celestial Ambassadors when there weren’t enough additional selves and he couldn’t mobilize more power of the universe.</p><p>Wouldn’t the Indestructible Original Body be unimportant then?</p><p>“That’s not enough!” Meng Qi roared. Darkness appeared around his body, turning into swirls, and inside every swirl was the image of his additional self imprint - there was the Creator Brahma, and also the Door of All Doors - all transferring strength to his fist.</p><p>The mountain-like fist became extremely heavy, and the surrounding void seemed to be constantly twisting and collapsing, forming a dot. The feeling of horror was felt by even the Bodhisattvas and Arhats in the Thousand Buddha Formation.</p><p>He concentrated all the powers that the manifestation had, of which the process was a little slow, looking like a target, but Maitreya did not attack him. Fahualin and Damiaoxiang also did not activate the Thousand Buddha Formation him to attack him, because they knew it was a trap.</p><p>Outside the Buddhist Kingdom, attacking with restrictive spells would result in being suppressed. Moreover, the other party was everywhere, and it was impossible to hit him. If they acted rashly, they might reveal their own flaws instead let the enemy grab a fleeting opportunity.</p><p>Therefore, they turned a blind eye and continued to expand the Buddhist Kingdom, redeeming the worldly beings in the most indestructible manner.</p><p>Fight as you please, we continue to do what we have to do!</p><p>Seeing that he failed to lure the enemy, Meng Qi stopped delaying and gave a violent roar, “All things return to the void!”</p><p>His right hand struck and slammed down, reaching the surface of the Thousand Buddha Formation instantaneously. The world seemed to be compressed at this moment, like thin papers stacked together, dark and dull.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The golden-bodied Buddhas collapsed but quickly reappeared again. The restrictive spells of the Thousand Buddha Formation that were broken quickly formed again.</p><p>Meng Qi’s manifestation from the Eight Nine Mysteries used all his strength in the punch but did not move it by even a bit, even the dissipating aftermath was swallowed by the formation and turned into flammule.</p><p>While being attacked by Meng Qi, white lotuses bloomed all over full Guangling, and the light of Buddha shone through this ancient city. Since ancient times, it had fallen for the first time without any strength to counter, and the Wang family who had lost their power had hidden into the grotto-heaven.</p><p>Facing the indestructible Thousand Buddha Formation, Meng Qi’s hair and beard were standing as though he was on fire. Then, he turned into a candle dragon with a human face and a snake body, red all over. His eyes opened and closed as winter and summer alternated, and spring and autumn changed instantly. Within a short instant, the Thousand Buddha Formation seemed to have experienced the four seasons, and the restrictive spell was suddenly a little chaotic.</p><p>Making use of this opportunity of time abnormality, Meng Qi pulled out his tail and hit at where the flaw was according to his deduction.</p><p>The Eight Nine Mysteries did not only use pure force, its essence was in using different restraints for different enemies!</p><p>At this moment, the three relics on top of Maitreya’s head turned gently as a wave-like flammule surged.The abnormality of time died away quickly, unable to cause chaos in the Thousand Buddha Formation anymore, hence the tail that was thrown over could not shake it at all.</p><p>Faced with this, Meng Qi couldn’t help but sigh silently. With the suppression of Maitreya and the two great Bodhisattvas of Fahualin and Damiaoxiang in the formation, he definitely wouldn’t be able to break this Thousand Buddha Formation even if his real self was here to display Creating Three Manifestations with One Breath, together with the suppression of the Celestial Slaying Sword and exhausting all his martial skills as well as magical powers, let alone the manifestation of the Eight Nine Mysteries.</p><p>At his current level, he didn’t have much chance of winning even if it was just Maitreya!</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Meng Qi seemed to not give up. He straightened his right palm, and once again collapsed the universe of the acupoints over his body, concising the power mobilized by the imprints of additional self. However, the blade wasn’t to return all things to void, but to create a new world.</p><p>He wanted to break this Thousand Buddha Formation, and open up another new heaven!</p><p>The pale golden right hand flashed across as the blade fell, striking at the Thousand Buddha Formation. All the Bodhisattvas and Arhats didn’t move at all, still looking down and chanting the name of Maitreya.</p><p>They believed in the sturdiness of the Thousand Buddha Formation.</p><p>Suddenly, a black shadow jumped out from the inside of Guangling which had been redeemed. Instead of dashing at the guarded Maitreya, it immediately rushed to the side of Bodhisattva Fahualin, biting through the layers of glaze protecting the formation and biting at the shoulder of Fahualin - it was the Celestial Hound!</p><p>Following Meng Qi’s instructions, it did not attempt to attack Maitreya again but lurked into Guangling, waiting for the expansion of the Buddhist Kingdom to get Guangling covered in it, and then attacked the Bodhisattvas in the formation at the most critical moment.</p><p>The Celestial Hound slammed fiercely, and Fahualin’s position actually moved. The restrictive spells immediately became chaotic, and the golden-bodied Buddha disappeared while the swastikas became illusory.</p><p>Meng Qi had been attacking, in vain and ineffectively, just to wait for this opportunity. How could he let go of the opportunity to work in collusion?</p><p>His hand was raised and the blade fell. With the flash of a light, the Thousand Buddha Formation separated into layers, showing the Buddhist Kingdom inside.</p><p>Bodhisattva Fahualin who was the first to be affected was being bitten by a dog as blade aura surrounded him. Having no other choice, he got out of the formation and appeared in the sky above Guangling. His golden body was broken, and his consciousness and spirit were both shaken.</p><p>Maitreya let out a sigh and delayed his healing. The three relics on his head suddenly appeared before Meng Qi’s blade aura, and the wave-like flammule caught the falling of the blade.</p><p>The Celestial Hound let out a roar and displayed shadows of dog that filled the sky, biting madly at every Bodhisattva and Arhat. Luckily, Damiaoxiang struck in time to prevent the calamity of the Buddhist Kingdom.</p><p>But no matter what, the Thousand Buddha Formation was already broken!</p><p>This can be delayed until Brother Doubi comes back… Meng Qi did not even think of defeating Maitreya with the manifestation of the Eight Nine Mysteries, but only planned to delay.</p><p>…</p><p>In the universe where Nezha and the Bull Demon King fought, Qingqiu the Fox calculated the time and clenched her teeth, “It cannot be delayed any more!”</p><p>Accompanying her voice, the Demon Divine Spear in her hand shone, bursting colors of black and yellow, and formed a thirty-three story exquisite pagoda!</p><p>A few years after the Spirited Mountain incident, the Demon Divine Spear had also awakened to the Legendary level!</p><p>…</p><p>Shaoxuan, Xi’e, Jiang Zhiwei, and Lu Wuming together battled the three celestial ambassadors of the Luo Sect, and were slowly breaking the Ten Directions of the Wanderer’s Azure World of the Celestial Lamp Ambassador.</p><p>But at this moment, the presence of the three celestial ambassadors actually merged with each other and formed a dark swirl in the center.</p><p>The dark swirl gave out clear light, showing a scene deep in the Void Hometown!</p><p>…</p><p>In the vast starry sky and outside the Celestial Slaying Sword Formation, the eyes of the white-haired giant monkey appeared bright as it quietly watched the development inside.</p><p>Suddenly, Yuan Hong smiled, shook its body and turned into a into a majestic man wearing a heavenly crown and yellow robe. With a handsome and cold disposition, it was Gao Lan!</p><p>Immediately after this, he flew into the sword formation.</p><p>…</p><p>Bodhisattva Fahualin was bitten by the Celestial Hound, and his injury was neither serious nor mild. Seeing the Thousand Buddha Formation being broken and the pure land on earth in chaos, with the sound of a dog barking everywhere like a downtown food market, he felt a fire burning inside him.</p><p>He immediately realized that his emotions and thoughts were wrong, and chanted the name of Maitreya to regain his peacefulness. He planned to join hands with Damiaoxiang to get a hold of the Celestial Hound.</p><p>Suddenly, he trembled all over, like he had fallen into an ice cave, and even his golden body and wisdom seemed to have frozen. He only saw a glazed golden hand fly out from the city of Guangling, its palm cracked into a huge mouth that had forty Buddha teeth!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
