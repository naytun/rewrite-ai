The dancing spear and the sharp horn constantly collided, bringing about countless beginnings and ends of thunder. And between the beginning and the end, the world was seen throughout to have the dissipated aftermath stretching the sun, destroying the stars, and turning the galaxies into pure energy, hitting the other party.</p><p>Even though they had only recovered to the level of just entering the Creation realm, the fierce battle between the two powerful characters made the Roc Demon King and the Dragon Demon King unable to intervene. All magical skills and powers were not able to get close, disappearing upon contact. Even they themselves had to seek protection under the white illusion of the Celestial Bull, hiding in the subtleties of the universe so as not to be involved in the omnipresent battle, otherwise they would be in deep trouble.</p><p>Because of this, the Roc Demon King was quite frustrated. If he was at the peak, he didn’t have to be afraid of Nezha, but unfortunately time was not on his side and it would take two or three years for him to return to the Creation realm. Although the Nezha today wasn’t better than those supreme characters with the title of Heavenly Lord whose partial power could crush him, but there was still a difference in their realms. Going forward would not help the Bull Demon king, but create more trouble.</p><p>Swallowing this down, the Roc Demon King squinted his eyes and looked at the outside world through the white celestial bull illusion. He saw that both sides seemed to have countless manifestations, covering every corner of the universe. They created boundless seas of sufferings for each other, wanting to let the other party sink in.</p><p>At this moment, he saw the Demon Divine Spear shine brightly, creating a thirty-three level exquisite pagoda that covered the surroundings in gold, giving an uninvadable sense of invincibility.</p><p>“Pagoda of Virtues?” he muttered.</p><p>In the past, the Demonic Sage was extremely powerful with five virtues on the body. Seeing the Pagoda of Virtues again now made him feel the vicissitudes and impermanence of worldly affairs.</p><p>Qingqiu nodded slightly, “Although it is a peerless heavenly weapon, stronger than the Legendary level under the same conditions, but it is still inferior to a normal Legendary supreme and may not even be comparable to one that has awakened in advance, and could only be considered as a weak Legendary weapon. Therefore, even the Pagoda of Virtues can only block one blow from Nezha. I appeal for all the great sages to cooperate, seize this opportunity to get out of this universe, and use the opportunity of the Heavenly Great Sage and Nezha battling to destroy the formation all the way.”</p><p>As staying here was of little use and also very time-consuming, the Dragon Demon King immediately agreed without any hesitation. The other great sages and demonic deities also nodded.</p><p>After communicating and getting ready, a thirty-three-story golden pagoda flew out of the white celestial bull illusion. Yellow lights hung downward and turned into water curtains, covering the group of demons underneath.</p><p>The Pagoda of Virtues had just appeared when the tip of a spear flew over, almost without any difference in sequence. Similarly, the iron corners attacked the tip of the spear like a cudgel.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The two attacked each other, bursting out terrifying waves of light that swept the surrounding galaxies. The pagoda made a creaking sound, breaking down under the close range of detonation and melting.</p><p>But at this moment, the Roc Demon King’s wings spread out and gently flapped, carrying the severely damaged pagoda out of the core area along with the light waves. Then, the Dragon Demon King drew out his tail and disrupted the aftermath.</p><p>The golden pagoda disappeared immediately, conveyed out of this universe and returned to the real world covered by the celestial sword formation.</p><p>…</p><p>In the sky above Nanzhou, Shaoxuan and Xi’e once again faced the Ten Directions of the Wanderer’s Azure World, and recalled the bad experience in the Ancient Fusang Realm.</p><p>However, things have changed as time went by. Some characteristics of the Celestial Lamp Ambassadors and the others were restricted, and their powers were also suppressed. Even if three of them joined forces, they wouldn’t be able to hold on for too long under the strong attack of Shaoxuan, Xi’e, and the Last Ship. Moreover, Jiang Zhiwei and Lu Wuming, holding the Invincible Blade and the Wisdom Sword, attacked from time to time, and the enchanted boundary started to collapse.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The area illuminated by lights emitted an illusory cracking sound. Light retreated and shrunk into the wick.</p><p>However, the backup of the Celestial Lamp Ambassador, the Celestial Ceremony Ambassador, and the Celestial Vase Ambassador had already been completed, and clear light surged out continuously from the dark swirl. The scene of the depth of the void was first presented, and then reflected in the surrounding. Outside the boundless chaos, four out of the twelve white lotuses bloomed, and the remaining eight were in buds of different degrees.</p><p>Dim light immediately enveloped the surroundings. The projection of the Void Hometown landed and offset the suppression of the Celestial Sword Formation. However, there was still no one who could be ubiquitous within a few tens of thousands of miles.</p><p>This was caused by the nature of the Void Hometown. It was equal to the Celestial World, and slightly higher than the Lifeless Heaven. They were all Legendary objects at infinite height. In the projections of two of them, the ubiquitous nature was offset and naturally cannot be used. It was just like in the past when Gu Erduo led Su Wuming to the Jade Pool in order to kill him.</p><p>In other words, this kind of restraint did not distinguish between the enemy and self, which was different from the suppression of the Celestial Sword Formation. Earlier on when the four celestial ambassadors of the Luo Sect used the strength of the Void Hometown and Lifeless Heaven to isolate Meng Qi and restrict ubiquity, they were also constrained. Other than after Meng Qi’s manifestation was trapped in the enchanted boundary of the Wanderer Lamp and the attack on him could be ubiquitous, it hadn’t been able to display this characteristic.</p><p>With the detection and reaction of the Invincible Blade and the Wisdom Sword, Jiang Zhiwei and Lu Wuming had jumped out of the range while the light was surging like the Shaoxuan and Xi’e. The four looked at each other and was going to join hands with the outside world to break the projection of the Void Hometown.</p><p>However, the Luo Sect’s three celestial ambassadors did not just want to drag the two sides to the same starting line. Amidst the chanting of the Ajati Matriarch, Void Hometown, petals flew out of the eight budding white lotuses, forming the statue of a supreme god.</p><p>With a flash of his figure, Meng Qi’s manifestation of the Eight Nine Mysteries appeared beside Jiang Zhiwei. He was about to strike when his expression suddenly changed and looked to the north at Changle.</p><p>…</p><p>The swordsman manifestation blocked the sudden attack of the Demonic Monarch, giving Meng Qi more time. Red, green, black, and white, the four celestial swords around him shone and emitted sword aura, creating chaos that swallowed up sequence and that could spread to the end.</p><p>The finger moved out and showed a complete appearance. It was an arm with six fingers that was exuding a feeling of annihilation.</p><p>The arm was long, and turned into a black-robed old man. His appearance was similar to that of the Demonic Monarch’s head - it was his Demonic Body of Six Annihilations which had awakened in advance and was lurking in Changle, waiting for an opportunity.</p><p>On the other side, seeing that he couldn’t succeed in tricking, Yuan Hong shook his body and turned into a white giant ape. Holding a black cudgel with both hands, he let out a loud roar and planned to break the formation by force.</p><p>The huge cudgel hit down, and a boundless sea of sufferings appeared, with pieces of the universe floating in it.</p><p>As the earliest awakened Creation character of the current era, Yuan Hong was definitely not ordinary.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>In the loud noise, the Heaven Conferring Platform shook and the sword aura was swallowed by the sea of sufferings. The shadows of the four swords shook violently, seeming like they couldn’t block a few more blows.</p><p>At the same time, the Demonic Monarch’s shot out his right hand and hit the enchanted boundary of the formation, bringing greater turmoil, and making the four colors look dull for a moment.</p><p>There was no leakage of aftermath from this exchange of blows, which was enough to show that Yuan Hong and the Demonic Monarch were fighting with skill and ease!</p><p>Meng Qi was seated on the Heaven Conferring Platform, and the premier auspicious cloud above his head expanded, eliminating the intruding strength, and his heart was heavy.</p><p>If Big Brother still doesn’t come back, he might not be able to guard the Heaven Conferring Platform.</p><p>He had expected the attack of the Demonic Monarch, but not Yuan Hong’s sudden appearance!</p><p>He had thought that he was seriously injured by the Qing Emperor and couldn’t stir trouble again in the next ten or twenty years.</p><p>…</p><p>After getting out of the small universe with fierce battle, the Roc Demon King returned to the forest. Feeling free and relaxed, he spread his wings and was about to fly to the western state.</p><p>At this moment, the surrounding sword aura subsided, the clouds in the sky were thin, and the strong wind was weakened. The suppression of the Celestial Sword Formation was reduced by more than half!</p><p>“Something is wrong with the sword formation!” the Dragon Demon King said joyfully.</p><p>“Heaven is on our side!” another great sage laughed loudly.</p><p>…</p><p>The sword formation weakened, and the projection of the Void Hometown expanded with it, almost enveloping Jiang Zhiwei and the others.</p><p>The Celestial Ceremony Ambassador and the others were stunned at first but quickly laughed.</p><p>Heaven is really on our side!</p><p>And the god statue was gradually taking form, seeming like the Ajati Matriarch!</p><p>…</p><p>The real world was broken, the multiverse shook. Terror was contained in infinite heights, and a clear light suddenly fell from it.</p><p>The clear light was neither thunder nor fire, but brought along the nature and wisdom of the Demonic Monarch, and letting it fall from infinity to dust.</p><p>The counter-attack directly caused him to fall into the realm!</p><p>Not only the manifestation, but also the real body!</p><p>Seeing which, Meng Qi who was inside the shaking Heaven Conferring Platform, activated the Principles of Karma, connecting cause and effect, and established a link, wanting to pull the nature and wisdom of the Demonic Monarch directly into his own hands.</p><p>By then, he could do whatever he wants with it!</p><p>But layers of demonic territories appeared in the air - there was a netherworld passing through, a nether blood pool, and also demons and ghosts. It was the projection of the Netherworld!</p><p>The Netherworld was joyful and the evil spirits sung praises. Blood and black fog rewound and eliminated the clear light, dashing upward with the nature and wisdom of the Demonic Monarch.</p><p>Yuan Hong and the Demonic Monarch laughed, and struck at the same time. A cudgel and a palm, hit on the cardinal enchanted boundary, causing disintegration.</p><p>The shadows of the four swords barely held on, and had reached the limit. The suppression of the sword formation had been reduced to a minimum.</p><p>Meng Qi squinted his eyes and began to consider giving up the guarding.</p><p>There was no way to block it by force. If he held on, it would implicate billions of living beings in the real world instead.</p><p>But at this moment, Gu Xiaosang’s original judgment flashed across his mind, “Gao Lan’s way of thinking is unpredictable, but yet has its own pattern. He hastily released the Heaven Conferring Platform and became a target of public criticism, but his real intention might not necessarily be on the Heaven Conferring Platform. It might just be a camouflage to deceive the enemies.”</p><p>…</p><p>In a hidden place in the boundless starry sky, Gao Lan looked down quietly at the changes in the sword formation, seeming like he had not gone looking for help.</p><p>After seeing the Demonic Monarch strike, he frowned and was slightly surprised, “Why is he here to stir trouble?”</p><p>After this, he looked to the side and said, “I can’t wait anymore.”</p><p>Next to him was a cultured-looking man in a loose robe. Carefree and unworldly, he was the Devil Master Han Guang. After sensing Gao Lan’s gaze, he smiled and said, “Indeed, those who should jump out have already jumped out, there’s no need to wait anymore.”</p><p>With deep eyes, Gao Lan said, “Then let me see who is the one behind you.”</p><p>Han Guang smiled, stretched out his hand and threw a scroll down. It was red, green, black, and white, ancient, and had the feeling of the end of the world.</p><p>Shrewd as he was, Gao Lan still couldn’t help but mumble, “Drawing of Celestial Slaying Sword Formation!”</p><p>Heavenly Lord Lingbao’s Drawing of Celestial Slaying Sword Formation!</p><p>The drawing of the formation appeared in a flash and fell toward the Heaven Conferring Platform.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
