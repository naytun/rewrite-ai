The snow fluttered down, covering the whole city with snow. It was another year of the worship day.</p><p>For the Blessed Nation which was based on the magical witchcraft, this was a grand occasion of high importance. Not only the Son of Heaven had to attend the Suburban Festival, but the Master of the National Guard Temple also had to attend personally, to offer sacrifices to the Earth Goddess of High Heaven together and pray for blessings.</p><p>The master and some tyrannical sect elders were not there, certainly, the National Guard Temple completely activated the Great Formation, just in case anything bad could happen. After all, the person blessed by the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi was always coveted, so he would be destroyed if he could not be possessed. It was absolutely impossible to let Gan Ruoxu follow the footsteps of the person blessed by the Black Emperor, Lin Fengxiao.</p><p>The light was wavering, and the Seal Script was drifting. Many phantoms of the Fairy God surrounded the air above the national guard temple, causing the place to be like the Heavenly Court. It was heavily guarded and remained stagnant like a mountain.</p><p>Nonetheless, even if it was the Forbidden Restrictive Spell, there would be people leaving or returning, especially disciples who would like to watch the sacrifice and see if they could get the Emperor’s favor, and deepen the connection with the Protecting-Fairy Gods.</p><p>The door shrouded in clear light cracked a gap, it then spread out into a round hole to let Wu Ju and the other disciples walk out. They headed swaggeringly toward the outskirts of the temple.</p><p>The round hole at the center of the clear light shrunk rapidly just like the water ripples and was about to subside. At this moment, a wave of light flashed, the small black hole that had been shrunk to the size of a thumb suddenly slowed down, and instantly solidified.</p><p>The unusual event appeared and disappeared in no time. The tactical formation did not have any response, the host did not notice it either. However, the sunshine by the door seemed to be much brighter.</p><p>Next to the screen wall facing the gate of the national guard temple, a ray of light floated like a water wave, and quickly condensed into a female figure in a purple robe with her hair tied up loosely, revealing her extraordinary manner.</p><p>The woman in purple robe relaxed her eyebrows, showing a smile on her face, clasped her hands behind her back, and leisurely walked around the National Guard Temple. Not sure why, but all her disciples, Taoist disciples, and servants who bumped into her had overlooked her. Some places which were isolated by the Restrictive Spell slowed her down, but she managed to pass through them without any hindrance.</p><p>The periphery of the national guard temple, which was one of the biggest forces in the world unexpectedly gave an impression of no man’s land.</p><p>As the woman in a purple robe was continuously walking, she suddenly paused her footsteps. In front of her, the Restrictive Spells were everywhere, layer upon layer with death lurks, isolating the series of core places in the Three Pristines Temple from the periphery.</p><p>“Not bad. This is indeed the National Guard Temple with a long history and deep heritage,” the woman in a purple role nodded gently in a calm posture, then raised her right hand.</p><p>This palm was bigger than the usual woman, but it was fairer, more slender, and feminine. It gave a feeling of years of dust accumulation.</p><p>If she wanted to go further from here, either she had an undercover, or else she could only barge her way in!</p><p>The woman in a purple robe estimated the progress of the worship ceremony and the power of the Restrictive Spell there and integrated with her tentative plan. No longer hesitating, she slowly extended her right hand. The center of her palm sparkled, forming a river.</p><p>Her body seemed to have overlapped with the illusory figure of an Ethereal Emperor!</p><p>The dawn had come!</p><p>At this moment, the Restrictive Spell in front suddenly turned dark, as though the deepest and most extreme night sky. Then blazes of bright light appeared and formed a vast star map. It then sprinkled with brilliant rays and fell on the long sword that was formed by the galaxy of stars, and slammed into the shining long river.</p><p>Puff!</p><p>The different colors around the River of Sword faded away. The pale white snow and the dark night sky; everything seemed to be stagnant. Nevertheless, the starlight was revitalized constantly; it might be slow but never solidified. The illusionary long river was completely shattered by the constant flow of power.</p><p>Heaven and earth once again became lively. The Restrictive Spells were endlessly activated on and off. The woman in a purple robe stopped going forward and confronted Taoist Qing Lang who was in the air above the Three Pristines Temple.</p><p>“Master Xu should attend the worship,” the woman in the purple robe was not panicking. Her right hand touched her waist, and slowly pulled out a long knife consolidated with brilliant rays.</p><p>Taoist Qing Lang was the Master of the National Guard Temple, Xu Jingxu. He clearly had led many sect elders who were heading to the outskirts to participate in the worship.</p><p>Xu Jingxu pointed his long sword to the side, smiled and said, “The connection between the South Star and I deepens over time. I already understood the secret of vitality, and able to pull out an incarnation. My noumenon purposely stays here to wait for Master Yun.”</p><p>The common name of the woman in a purple robe was unknown as she proclaimed herself as Yun Gu. Before she reached sixteen years old, she had already sensed the Celestial Ruler before the Chart of Deities Achievement Ranking. She refused to attach to Yellow Turbanism, National Guard Temple, etc. She traveled overseas, established the Emperor Heavens and appointed herself as the master. She was hunted down by various countries and sects, but she always managed to escape. Her power gradually developed, she herself also became the strong contender of the self-strengthening person in the world.</p><p>“I frequently heard about the Star Master’s glory of Master Xu. It’s just in time for me to widen my knowledge today,” the woman in a purple robe flicked the long knife in her hand, it drew out a strange track with the posture of dissecting heaven and earth, slashing toward Xu Jingxu.</p><p>In front of the blade beam, and behind the figure, Yun Gu was as illusory as she was. She passed through the layers of Restriction Spells in flashing light, wanted to escape from the National Guard Temple.</p><p>National Guard Temple was a powerful branch of Taiping Dao in the former years, with a long history and deep heritage. No matter how proud Yun Gu was, she did not think she could compete with Xu Jingxu when she was in his Restrictive Spell, not to mention there was not only one strong person in the temple.</p><p>She would not be able to get away if she did not leave now!</p><p>Xu Jingxu did not expect Yun Gu to be so decisive, she escaped so quickly and never hesitated at all. He automatically launched his swordsmanship, splitting the blade beam and chased after her.</p><p>Suddenly, Xu Jingxu and Yun Gu heard the bell ringing at the same time.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>The bell reverberated and shook heaven and earth. The sect elders of the National Guard Temple who were waiting to attack were stunned simultaneously. The dense Tactical Formation outside Three Pristines Temple thereupon stagnated.</p><p>“Great Taoist Sage!”</p><p>“Zhang Buzhou!”</p><p>Yun Gu and Xu Jingxu blurted out, calling different title, but both pointed to the same person, the Chief of Yellow Turbanism, Zhang Buzhou, the Great Taoist Sage, the person blessed by Eastern Emperor Taiyi. In the past four decades, he overran the whole world and never met any opponents. He literally expanded the weakest Taiping Nation and doubled the size. In the past ten years, he isolated himself from the world to practice, intending to break through the boundaries and hold the arrival of Eastern Emperor Taiyi with the mortal body to conquer the world and unify the universe.</p><p>These few years, when Yun Gu was at her peak, she always thought of having a confrontation with the Great Taoist Sage. She was aware that she was not necessarily defeated, but surely she could not win.</p><p>Whoever thought that this old monster who never showed up would suddenly come to National Guard Temple!</p><p>The bell sounded melodious as a strange figure appeared in front of the Restrictive Spell of Three Pristines Temple. His forehead was covered with a wide yellow towel which had even blocked his eyes.</p><p>His figure flickered and instantly passed through the stagnated Restrictive Spell. He stretched out his right hand and pressed from afar, trying to push open the door of the Three Pristines Temple.</p><p>In Three Pristines Temple, Gan Ruoxu who was visualizing the strange state had already noticed the activity outside. He was a bit nervous in the beginning, but he found that the master was cautious and ready to fight. He silently took a sigh of relief after he managed to stop Yun Gu. However, the situation changed suddenly, Great Taoist Sage came unexpectedly, he broke the Restrictive Spell and was about to enter Three Pristines Temple.</p><p>What to do? What to do? Gan Ruoxu suddenly felt nervous. In the Blessed Nation, the name of Zhang Buzhou, the Great Taoist Sage could stop babies from crying at night. Not sure how many people had nightmares of him!</p><p>He just received the blessings from the Heavenly Lord for a few months. What could he do to escape from his hands?</p><p>All kinds of thoughts popped in his mind. Gan Ruoxu was like being affected by the bell, and stunned in stone, the feeling of nervousness made his legs limp.</p><p>At this moment, he felt that the Premier Priest in his mind open his eyes promptly, his own bright and thorough heart turned dark, not recognizing up and down, hard to know the front and back, the past and the future seemed to be in unison.</p><p>Does the Heavenly Lord initiate to pass on such a powerful force to me?</p><p>This was the state which could only be achieved by those experienced people with direct knowledge who had practiced for five years and above!</p><p>Creak!</p><p>The main door of the Three Pristines Temple in front of Great Taoist Sage was unable to stop him, he dragged along the piercing sound, and broke open with the speed of almost falling.</p><p>Then, Zhang Buzhou, Yun Gu, and Xu Jingxu saw the situation in the temple. Gan Ruoxu was sitting with his legs crossed, facing the door. His eyes were closed, the eyes of the statue of Heavenly Lord Yuan Shi behind him were deep and appeared old. It seemed to have overlapped with him, setting off the temple to look rather distant yet deep.</p><p>The Great Taoist Sage was a little stunned, and immediately shook off all kinds of emotions, and promptly pulled off the yellow towel to let his eyes reappear in the world.</p><p>This was a pair of white eyes without the eyeballs which was as clear as the Azure stones that had reflected an ancient and honorable emperor.</p><p>The figure of the emperor was vague and hard to distinguish in detail. As soon as he appeared, there were countless of dim rays rolling over the whole Three Pristines Temple. Some of the time it was fast and some other time it was slow. It had formed a turbulent flow, tearing everything apart, and aimed to make Gan Ruoxu die inexplicably!</p><p>The eyes of Yun Gu were flickering, focusing on the magical witchcraft of the Great Taoist Sage. Xu Jingxu was waiting for rescue. However he was blocked by the bell and got affected by the turbulent flow. It was so near yet so far. His heart was anxious, but he could not do anything. It seemed like he could only watch Gan Ruoxu die inexplicably in the eyes of Zhang Buzhou.</p><p>Suddenly, Gan Ruoxu raised his head a bit with his eyes tightly closed, as if he was listening to the teaching of Heavenly Lord Yuan Shi behind him. A figure in green robe appeared on his body. The beautiful facial features with greying temples, which was exactly the same as Heavenly Lord Yuanshi!</p><p>The figure in the green robe opened up both his hands, and made a move of embracing the front. Gan Ruoxu also stretched out both his arms.</p><p>The two figures seemed to overlap and hard to distinguish from each other. Their faces were upright with their arms opened, immediately the surrounding was immersed in the deepest darkness. Chaos was everywhere without any light. It was subtle and difficult to float. The turbulent flow of time sank into it without even having to stir up waves and torrents!</p><p>Endless acceptance, embrace heaven and earth!</p><p>All the anomalies and the fluctuation disappeared completely!</p><p>Xu Jingxu seized the opportunity to rush to the front of the Three Pristines Temple. The Great Taoist Sage turned around and left immediately; he dared not remain in one place.</p><p>Gan Ruoxu who had just connected with the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi for a few months was able to show such magical witchcraft. It had completely gone against the theory of magical witchcraft as if a practice was needless!</p><p>Could it be the omnipotent of the Chief of Three Pristine Daode Tianzun?</p><p>Yun Gu took a light breath and stepped back, then withdrew from the National Guard Temple.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>The sound of a bell ringing echoed around the atmosphere. Zhang Buzhou disappeared strangely. Gan Ruoxu sat still at the Three Pristines Temple. The illusionary figure had already disappeared. The statue of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi stood like eternally immutable.</p><p>…</p><p>At a secret place outside the city of the Blessed Nation, the Great Taoist Sage stood with his arms clasped behind his back. In his mind, there was only the grand and mysterious scene of the figure in green robe, embracing heaven and earth.</p><p>“The person blessed by the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi is really difficult to be measured by common sense. It will be hard to find it again after losing the opportunity this time,” Zhang Buzhou was highly aware of this. “I can only carry out the last move as a last resort.”</p><p>The so-called final move was to arrange the altar and directly pray for the arrival of the Eastern Emperor. This heaven and earth would not be able to withstand it with only a hint of his strength, and able to cause the place within a radius of ten thousand kilometers to be destroyed. The universe would be shaken and all kinds of doomsday scenes would arise, and might not be able to be stabilized.</p><p>Most importantly, he who hosted the ceremony was going to die for sure. Of course, Gan Ruoxu who was at the nearby city would also die.</p><p>“Since the Eastern Emperor is willing to pay the price, let’s do it then,” the Great Taoist Sage showed a firm expression on his face.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
