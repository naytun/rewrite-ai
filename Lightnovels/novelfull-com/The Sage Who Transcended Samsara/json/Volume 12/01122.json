Meng Qi was covered by the light of the Seven-Kill Tablet, causing the Principle of Karma and his Nirvana characteristics to erupt. He could deeply feel himself right in this river of time and destiny, and right at that node.</p><p>Looking into the future, there were countless tributaries. They were unclear and he could only vaguely see one or two of them. Looking back at the past, all kinds of images were presented. Bits and pieces of himself, others and the ancients were uncountable and vast like the starry sky. If Meng Qi were to fill them all into his brain, he would explode immediately and a mighty person like him also wouldn’t be spared.</p><p>Having used it more than once, Meng Qi was already familiar. He turned his thoughts and amplified his consciousness, “Six hundred and eighty-nine years ago, second day of the second month, two o’clock in the afternoon…”</p><p>Countless images that made people’s heads explode faded away, leaving behind relevant scenes. But most of them were unclear - some were covered with snowflakes and some were even completely blurred, like television signals that had been subjected to strong magnetic distortion.</p><p>When there was a mighty person of Legendary status and above, the backtracking of the Seven-Kill Tablet would be seriously interfered with. Previously, there were already more than one Nirvana realm character, not to mention Legendary and Creation realms. Such situations were common and Meng Qi had already expected it. Not panicking, a new thought came to his mind:</p><p>The Donghai Dragon Palace!</p><p>The old Dragon King hasn’t reached Legendary status yet, and even more impossible in the past. The Sea Calming Pin which was the only commendable item had already been taken away by Sun Wukong, so there was no need to fear being interfered by any treasures in the Dragon Palace!</p><p>The images of snowflakes and blurriness faded away, leaving behind a series of shiny water scenes showing the instinctive reaction of the Donghai Dragon King when facing a great disaster.</p><p>Meng Qi stretched out his right hand, touching that instant wave of light when the Donghai Dragon King changed from being calm to shock and panic.</p><p>That was the critical point when he noticed cracks appearing on his position of the Superior Lord of the Four Seas and the Heavenly Court!</p><p>The scouring suddenly disappeared and Meng Qi felt himself being thrown out of the River of Time. Enveloped by the force of the Seven-Kill Tablet, he went through the chaos and moved upstream against the flow.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, his eyes lit up, seeing the shiny waters swaying in the surroundings. Standing there were prawn and crab soldiers, Dragon descendents, the Turtle Chancellor, and the Fish General, etc. The Dragon King was sitting high up in his throne with wine in his hand. The shock and fear on his face couldn’t be hidden.</p><p>“Dragon King, you’re still this energetic despite your age,” Meng Qi couldn’t help but say this after he saw the Dragon King look exactly the same as more than six hundred years later and not appear younger because of him going back to the past.</p><p>The old Dragon King looked over and saw a mysterious young priest in his palace, he blurted out, “Who are you?”</p><p>Appearing in the Dragon Palace out of nowhere and said even said he was energetic despite his age!</p><p>The Turtle Chancellor and the other marine characters were also shocked. They remembered clearly that there wasn’t this priest just an instant ago, how did he get in?</p><p>The Dragon Palace was heavily guarded and had strong prohibition laws. How could anyone come and go as he wished?</p><p>At this moment, the Dragon King’s face changed color again, feeling his relationship with the Heavenly Court had totally broken.</p><p>Right after this, the Dragon Palace suddenly shook. The pillars swayed, looking like they were about to be broken. Corals and other items fell while cracks appeared on the tiles, spreading to the bottom of the sea, looking as though doomsday was approaching.</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi’s right hand pushed his cloud crown and a chaotic auspicious cloud dashed out from the top of his head. Rays of dim light hung low, turning into water mist.</p><p>With a jump, he conveyed out of the Donghai Dragon Palace. In front of him were five-colored celestial thunders and brilliant purple flames falling like rain.</p><p>Heavy rain poured directly on the Dragon Palace and Meng Qi dashed right to it without any avoidance.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The thunder and fire landed on his body and fell into the dim light, causing ripples but quickly disappeared without a trace.</p><p>After breaking through the cross attack of thunder and fire, Meng Qi’s view suddenly became clear. At this moment, he was on top of a vast sea. High up in the sky were different thunders – some chaotic and looked destructive, some intertwined in black and white, some of the colors red, green, yellow, and white. There were also flames of different colors – red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple – and different power. They were entangled with one another, turning into fire meteors that looked spectacular.</p><p>Judging from their power, if all of them were to fall, the four main continents and all the creatures of the ocean would become extinct. There would be no more mountains and the seawater would dry up.</p><p>Fortunately, they didn’t fall down completely like raindrops, blocked by a thin layer of faintly discernible air halfway. They turned into a female shadow with the head of a human and the body of a snake. Its arms were spread out as though hugging the sky, such that Meng Qi would only see its back view.</p><p>Thunder and fire attacked but most were eliminated by the faintly discernible air. Only a little barely went through with decreased power and quality, hitting toward the Superior Lord of the Four Seas that was connected to the Heavenly Court.</p><p>“A skill left behind by Nuwa?” Meng Qi was staring blankly for a while before hearing an indescribable breaking sound coming from the sky.</p><p>If one really had to describe it, it was a powerless struggle by a universe that had come to its end, a cry of despair on doomsday, a great terror of heaven and earth collapsing!</p><p>After that moment, a ray of bright light shone at the thunder and flames that filled the sky, making them lose their colors, as though there was only this ray of light left in the world.</p><p>Meng Qi’s eyes seemed to be blinded and couldn’t see external objects anymore. But his mind was calm without a trace of ripple formed. Deep inside his dark and non-reflective pupil was an ancient glazed lamp giving off black and white illusory light.</p><p>What he saw was no longer the same. The blazing color of white disappeared and brilliant star lines appeared, but they were scattered in all directions like messes of fabrics, such that it was impossible to see or figure out the detailed karma.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The blazing white light faded away and the sky was dim, so was the illusory world of karma.</p><p>Raindrops the color of dark blood fell. A small amount of them penetrated the faintly discernible air landed on the ground, immediately forming a flood that drowned the city and turned mountains into deserted islands.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The sky suddenly sank, seemingly falling downward. Rays of light dashed into the sky one after another. There were a total of twenty four of them, scattering in all directions.</p><p>The heavens started to collapse!</p><p>The moment that Meng Qi had been waiting for was here. Inside the illusory world of karma, a mess of karma differentiated into twenty four parts, each moving in different directions, creating a brilliant scene.</p><p>The Principle of Karma turned, but Meng Qi didn’t attempt to intercept the treasure. Once he passed the layer of faintly discernible air, he would definitely turn into ashes under the thunder and flames. Therefore, he remembered the karma characteristics and links related to the twenty four Sea Calming Pearls so that he could make deduction and searches after going back to the future.</p><p>The glazed lamp quietly emitted light as the karma threads were being remembered in Meng Qi’s eyes.</p><p>Just as he was about to remember all of them, something suddenly struck him, making him look up at the horizon uncontrollably.</p><p>Karma faded away and chaos appeared. The sky was dark red and directionless, filled with irregular swirls that formed a pair of terrifying eyes that are indifferent to the extreme.</p><p>They were staring at where the heavens collapsed!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
