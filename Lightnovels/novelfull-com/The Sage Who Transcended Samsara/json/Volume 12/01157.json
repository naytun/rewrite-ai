Looking at the rising sun and the gorgeous morning clouds, he seemed to be lamenting about something. He turned his head back after a few seconds, looking at the empty door while listening to the morning bustles. He heaved a sigh of relief when he sensed that everything was serene as if he had been through a fierce battle.</p><p>“It is truly not easy…” he sighed secretly.</p><p>The Bhaisajyaguru generation was based on the Sutra of the Merit and Virtue of the Past Vows. They primarily cultivated Sambhogakaya, and Moonlight Bodhisattva was no exception. Their words and deeds must comply with their own Great Vows so that they were closely connected to the Da Dao Dharma and getting more and more similar until they succeeded in superseding it. Once there was a violation in the process, they would immediately lose their Sambhogakaya and fall down.</p><p>Hence, there was no problem for the Moonlight Bodhisattva to protect him and repay the karmic debt. However, as a part of the Da Dao Dharma, it was obviously impossible for the Moonlight Bodhisattva to directly interfere with the mundane aspects of the life of an ordinary person, intervened with the vicissitudes of life and assisted him to deal with the black-robed man.</p><p>Meng Qi could protect himself with ease but he was worried that the black-robed man was unable to control his urge to compete with other passengers on the ship. Besides, he was unsure whether the Moonlight Bodhisattva would step in and restrain the man if they were not under the circumstance of the holocaust. He had to bring his ability to hoodwink into play, combining it with his experience and lamentations after losing martial arts in order to hold off on the man for the whole night. He could finally eliminate all sorts of desires in the mind of the black-robed man and at the same time, restricted him by bluffing in half-truth about the requirement for the complete success of Wu Wang Eyes.</p><p>In the middle of the night, he looked like a supermundane master who was big-hearted and reserved, talking about the meaning of outer appearance and true self. In reality, he was anxious about every step he took as he was afraid that the black-robed man would not be interested in what he said. However, he was also fearful that he might go too far and cause a rebound.</p><p>There was no punching and kicking, nor was there any sword. The conversation in this night was not just similar to a fierce battle, it was in fact a fierce battle though the other party might not be able to feel it.</p><p>“Fortunately, I still have my mouth…” Meng Qi touched his temple, self-mocking yet proud of himself.</p><p>Back when he was in the dorm of his university, he was addicted to the wuxia fantasy novel. He was the best among his roommates in enlivening the atmosphere, gossiping, pulling pranks, and bluffing. He was a bad influence among them. They jokingly said that his ability to talk was the only thing he had. They sincerely compared him with Confucius who became a saint and was addressed as Kongzi in ancient times, saying that he was the King of trash talk, and thus, should be addressed as Zhuizi.</p><p>As expected, he had to change his attitude, thinking and way of dealing with matters since he lost his martial arts.</p><p>Meng Qi had a deeper comprehension of his external mode after tonight.</p><p>It was not the martial arts that beclouded his eyes, but his experience and habits formed from his reliance on the martial arts. His mind was disturbed by the inherent cognition and instinctive judgment. They were very accurate under some circumstances, but it would be playing by the same old rules and incorrigibly obstinate to completely have faith in and abide by them. Sooner or later he would not even know that he had reached the threshold and became lethargic thereafter.</p><p>As such, seeing the true self by self-destroying was not tantamount to giving up on himself, neither was he giving up his martial arts. He was indeed seeing through the limitation and understood that he could not rely upon the rules.</p><p>He would be able to completely master the strength of martial arts once he broke through and saw the true self. He would be able to control it and not be controlled by it. It was just like building a ship (martial arts) to sail through the sea (sea of sufferings). If you were still unwilling to let go of the ship (martial arts) when you had reached the shore, it would be like putting the cart before the horse and you had confused the means and the purpose.</p><p>It was not easy to see through this matter. Those experiences, acknowledgment, and habits that had almost become an instinct came into play unconsciously, seeping into all areas unknowingly. It was difficult to be aware of the difference itself. It was hard to identify it even if there was a correspondence thought in your mind. After all, those who were closely involved could not see clearly, they would need to take a long time to review it in order to see through. This could be regarded as a big complication in the course of martial arts.</p><p>Under such circumstances, Meng Qi took the advice from Qi Zhengyan and gave up on his martial arts, for the sole purpose of letting the conflicts between reality and these experiences, acknowledgments, and habits surface. Though it was an extreme measure, the results were indeed remarkable. He had different appreciations from time to time, though his heart had become impenetrably thick-headed after years of cultivation.</p><p>Meng Qi’s stomach began to growl after meditating for a while. He shook his head and broke into a laugh. He went out of the cabin and headed toward the hall of the ship. He saw plenty of people carrying the Myriad World Talisman along his way. They were either chatting with their families to ease the pain of separation or swiping their fingers on the Talisman and surfing through the news and posts that they were interested in.</p><p>It was analogous to the scenario of seeping into all areas unknowingly, the Myriad World Talisman had changed the lifestyle of the Real World.</p><p>“Where’s your Myriad World Talisman, Xiao Meng? I have not seen you using it these past few days?” after getting along with Meng Qi for a few days, Huang Chang who wanted to seek shelter from the Palace of Mohism had gotten very familiar with him. He greeted Meng Qi while asking him the question that he had forgotten to ask before.</p><p>How to exchange numbers and add him to the address list without the Myriad World Talisman?</p><p>Meng Qi let out a sigh, “It was stolen when I was at the Island of Three Clouds. I only discovered it was gone when I set sail.”</p><p>Huang Chang did not suspect anything, he took out another Myriad World Talisman and handed over to Meng Qi, “This is my old Talisman. It has fewer functions but it will still serve the purpose. Use it to contact your family lest they’re worried about you.”</p><p>“Yes!” Meng Qi’s eyes were beaming with light, he accepted Huang Chang’s kindness without any hesitation.</p><p>I can contact Mister Lu Da, Zhiwei, and Daqinggen with this Myriad World Talisman. I can straight away return to the Jade Palace without the hassle of traveling over land and water and being all travel-worn.</p><p>But will I have less experience and appreciation if I return to the Jade Palace directly?</p><p>Whatever, I’ll just contact them and talk about gossip in order to have the development of the current situation well in hand.</p><p>Switching his thoughts, Meng Qi opened the Myriad World Talisman, intending to enter the correspondence number to contact Jiang Zhiwei and the others.</p><p>Just then, he froze as he realized that he could not recall Jiang Zhiwei’s number.</p><p>The Primordial Spirit and the mortal body merged into one following the Dharmakaya and the real spirit would surface. It was not empty words that he would have a highly retentive memory and everything would be imprinted in his memory. He would be able to receive information that was as big as a universe in the future as he enhanced his realm. This could not be compared to those of a mortal. As such, Meng Qi never took the effort to remember his master and friends’ numbers since he could imprint it in his memory with a mere glance. Now that he had lost his martial arts and was back to normal, he no longer had the capability to memorize and receive such huge amounts of information.</p><p>He could still vaguely remember it deep in his mind, but it was hard to see it clearly. Meng Qi puzzled over it and frowned his brows slightly, looking like an amnesia patient. It was as though many of his experiences and knowledge that he had gained previously was sinking into the sea. They were indistinct and unclear, he could only recall a small part that emerged from the water.</p><p>As it turned out, his memory and knowledge were depending on his martial arts…</p><p>If it was not because of him consuming the Elixir of Life before, he would have aged and died of old age.</p><p>The effect of the martial arts that had become an instinct began to emerge. Meng Qi felt like he was soaked in sweat. It was not that simple to be aware of the problem albeit he gave up his power.</p><p>He would have to rely on time if he did not give up.</p><p>There were surprises and fearful things, yet there were gains and rewards as well. Meng Qi kept away the Myriad World Talisman that was given by Huang Chang and smiled, “No one picked up now, let’s have breakfast first.”</p><p>Huang Chang did not suspect anything. They entered the hall of the ship together and took their seats.</p><p>Meng Qi resumed thinking about the doubt he had just now while chit-chatting about the anecdote of Jiang Hu.</p><p>Even the memory and knowledge are dependant on the martial arts. Have I completely gotten rid of its impact on my attitude, thoughts, and methods?</p><p>The acknowledgment and experience that came from the strength of martial arts are restrictions. Is this knowledge from earth, acknowledgement, and experience in my memory restrictions as well? What’s the difference between my reconstructed way of thinking and the essence of the mode of thinking that came from the martial arts?</p><p>After a moment of silence, Meng Qi answered to himself in his mind.</p><p>They are both restrictions! There is no difference!</p><p>He gave up martial arts simply because it was his biggest reliance. Thus, he could look at other things more clearly and not solely focus on appearance.</p><p>There were restrictions from the experience, knowledge, and way of thinking that came from martial arts. It would be difficult for him to see his true self clearly. Similarly, there were restrictions from the knowledge on earth, past experience, ideology, and the mode of thinking. It was difficult for him to see his true self as well. In other words, it was a posterior for being limited in itself. Cutting off everything would be tantamount to death. He would be unable to think and appreciate it. Therefore, the restrictions were there regardless of the nature of the Dharma practice and experience. They were unable to see through the true self and could only reflect one side. There were similarities and differences between them. It was like blind people touching an elephant, they would have their own view and cover the part for the whole, yet they were unable to see the big picture.</p><p>Knowing the similarities and differences between them, he would be able to understand that everything he saw was merely an illusion and he would be able to see the Buddha when he could see beneath the surface.</p><p>What’s Buddha? I am Buddha!</p><p>Right now, it could be considered that he had seen the true self and self-attained the Legendary realm.</p><p>Meng Qi was joyful at the thought of cognition at his moment. It was not a sudden realization. He truly saw the path in becoming a Legend. He used to be at a loss as to what to do and realize after giving up his martial arts, all he could do was keep trying. Now, he finally knew how to work hard and inspect himself.</p><p>He could not help but grin from ear to ear at this thought. The young lady who was at the side of the table muttered, “Uncle lit up all of a sudden.”</p><p>“Right, right, like a candle at night,” the young boy echoed.</p><p>They were less contaminated and could see what the adults were unable to see in spite of their lack of experience and wisdom.</p><p>Meng Qi looked at them and said smilingly, “I’m like an azure stone, clear and bright from the inside and the outside.”</p><p>“Uncle is so great!” the twins said without any doubt.</p><p>Right at the moment, the person who was standing near the window exclaimed and blurted out.</p><p>“The ancient Fusang tree?”</p><p>This sea route is in a totally different direction with the ancient Fusang tree and it is ten thousand miles away from here. How did he see the ancient Fusang tree? Meng Qi collected his senses and looked out the window. There was a towering tree at the boundary of the sky and the sea. The leaves were similar to mulberry leaves and looked as if they were on fire.</p><p>Is it really the ancient Fusang tree?</p><p>Some martial artists took out their astrolabe, speculating for a while and said with uncertainty, “There’s nothing wrong with the sea route, how did the ancient Fusang tree get here?”</p><p>While Meng Qi was preparing to post on Myriad World Access to seek help, he heard the voice of the Moonlight Bodhisattva in his ears, “The shadow of ancient Fusang tree can be seen in all the seven seas and there are people from the Luo Sect coming and going in its vicinity.”</p><p>“The Luo Sect?” Meng Qi frowned his brows. The ancient Fusang tree was related to the Eastern Emperor Taiyi. What does the Luo Sect want to do?</p><p>He then beseeched, “Please keep your eyes on it.”</p><p>Tongues were wagging in the hall of the ship. There were people who were taking pictures, posting on the forum and live broadcasting. Huang Chang looked at them for a while and turned his head back in satisfaction. He noticed that his new friend, Xiao Meng was puzzling over something and his face was grave.</p><p>“What are you thinking about?” he asked casually.</p><p>Meng Qi said seriously,</p><p>“I’m thinking about the motive of the Luo Sect, worrying about how far they’ve colluded with the demon race. I’m thinking about the world trend and deriving about what the terrans shall do…”</p><p>Huang Chang looked at him blankly, not knowing what to say. Everyone around him was confused.</p><p>Why… why do you have to think about it? Would it help even if you have thought it through?</p><p>Could he be a member of the virtual government hall that is well-known on the Myriad World Access? They are ordinary people, yet concerned about the nation and its people. It is all about the affairs of national defense and administration between talks.</p><p>Suddenly, the voice of the Moonlight Bodhisattva reverberated in Meng Qi’s ears.</p><p>“There’s an aura of the Luo Sect Legendary realm in the ancient Fusang tree. It seemed like they were guided by the Golden Emperor and found their way here from the clues left by the holy maiden.”</p><p>Xiaosang? Meng Qi stood up abruptly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
