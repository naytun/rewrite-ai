The strong attack against the Great Sage of Mei Mountain Yuan Hong and the supreme Demonic Monarch was coming to an end, and the sword aura covering the territory of Great Zhou was being eliminated and decreasing to a level that was impossible to interfere with the Legendary level.</p><p>The prehistoric behemoth-like white ape once again raised the black cudgel up high, activated the acupoints on his body, opening up layers of universe and caves and explicitated projections of his additional self. Then, it struck down violently with pure force, causing illusory light waves and brought about the sea of sufferings that first eroded the sword formation.</p><p>The Demonic Monarch did not take any action, but placed one hand behind his back and looked relaxed. It naturally wasn’t difficult for him to judge with his eyes that the Celestial Sword Formation was going to fall apart under the cudgel. If this was the case, why should he bother to waste his energy?</p><p>It was better for him to wait until Yuan Hong broke the cardinal, and then seamlessly join the attack, crush the picture of mountains and rivers, so that Su Meng couldn’t find a chance to escape.</p><p>Yes, for his attack this time, first would be to destroy the Heaven Conferring Platform, and he would have overfulfilled the task if he could destroy the real world. Second would be to use the opportunity to get rid of the Primitive Emperor Su Meng!</p><p>This was both the intention of some existing beings, and also his own thinking!</p><p>Because of the Jiangdong Ancient Book, Qi Zhengyan achieved Dharmakaya, and preliminarily got rid of his restraint. Also, the demonic sages were coming back from reincarnation one after another. It would be quite troublesome to get rid of him when his combined body had not completely awakened. And the biggest problem was Su Meng who was bound to help. He had already achieved the Legendary realm and he dared not say any of his replicated demonic bodies was sure to win him.</p><p>If he had the opportunity, he must of course eliminate the trouble in advance!</p><p>Strike!</p><p>With the strike of the cudgel, the world was compressed, becoming dark and sullen, and seemed to be stacked together. The palm of the Demonic Monarch hanging on the side of his body slightly opened, and the six fingers respectively communicated different ways of destruction, preparing for the follow-up.</p><p>Plop!</p><p>The black cudgel paused, and a weak sound reverberated away. There was no movement of a violent collision, nor was there a loud and breaking sound. It was completely different from what Yuan Hong and the Demonic Monarch had expected.</p><p>What happened?</p><p>Looking over, the Demonic Monarch did not see a crumbling sword formation in front of the black cudgel, but an ancient formation drawing that had both distinctive and mixed up colors of red, green, black, and white.</p><p>Yes, it was both distinct and mixed up. A concept that was completely opposite and contradictory was actually put together strangely!</p><p>“Drawing of Celestial Slaying Sword Formation!” as a great powerful character who was active during the Demon Sage and the Emperor’s reign, he recognized the drawing at one glance.</p><p>Drawing of Celestial Slaying Sword Formation!</p><p>The most ancient formation drawing that was born with Heavenly Lord Lingbao!</p><p>Damn! The presence of his demon body contracted, and he couldn’t care for anything else. His well-prepared right hand popped out and grabbed the formation drawing.</p><p>He mustn’t let Su Meng get hold of it!</p><p>Meng Qi had already prepared for the sword formation conveying out of this realm after being broken. But at this crucial moment, he saw an ancient formation drawing in front of him, resonating with the four celestial swords erected in the north pole and other places.</p><p>Drawing of Celestial Slaying Sword Formation?</p><p>It is the original Drawing of Celestial Slaying Sword Formation, not the one that the Priest Chonghe re-completed using the refining method and the four sword manuals!</p><p>Having the original Drawing of Celestial Slaying Sword Formation meant that the sword manual was completed. The complete Number One Archean Killing Formation had once again appeared in the world!</p><p>Meng Qi got a shock as he instantly recognized the formation drawing and knew its significance.</p><p>This is the key to turning defeat into victory!</p><p>As soon as he saw the formation drawing, he had already gained a sudden realization and understood the plan of Gao Lan. Brother Doubi really feigned action in one place and made the real move in another, but yet not entirely so.</p><p>He used the construction of the Heaven Conferring Platform as a bait to make the powerful characters who had awakened in advance and had animosity jump out, and then use the formation drawing to complete the Celestial Slaying Sword Formation, complete the battle of the swords with the map before wiping them all out!</p><p>In this way, there would be no more interference from powerful characters in a short period of time, and Gao Lan could easily spread the humanity and attack the Legendary realm. He could also show his ability to the emperor’s allies and get into an active position.</p><p>If powerful characters such as Maitreya and the Bull Demon King became aware of it and refused to jump into the trap, he could only watch helplessly at the successful construction of the Heaven Conferring Platform. Gao Lan ruled by humanity, and could still take on an active position all the same.</p><p>The conspiracy was perfect!</p><p>As for why Gao Lan was certain that there were the four celestial swords, Meng Qi could now easily think of it: Guangchengzi was the teacher of two generations of the emperor!</p><p>A genius in retrospect refers to someone like Meng Qi. But he was a helper in the first place and had no interest in re-establishing the Heavenly Court or bringing glory to the Great Zhou. Other than wanting to reach the Nirvana realm, he had also no ambitions for similar strategic games. He had just lent a helping hand because Gao Lan needed help.</p><p>As for Gao Lan not communicating the plan with him, Meng Qi did not mind at all. If it was just a battle limited to the Legendary level, his Principles of Karma were enough to cover up the mysteries of heaven and trick everyone, so that the remaining power characters couldn’t spy on the secrets and understand the idea, thereby speculating the development. But be it Maitreya or the demonic race, they were all hands of influential Nirvana characters to manipulate the current situation. They must be guarded against in order to disrupt their hands. One less person who knew the plan meant one less communication method and hence less possibility of failure.</p><p>If the matter was not kept a secret, it might bring harm to himself instead!</p><p>If the same situation happened in the future and the manipulator was changed to himself, Meng Qi believed he would also hide it from Gao Lan.</p><p>Moreover, from the look of it now, if he wanted to be redeemed and reach the Nirvana realm, he still had to play strategies.</p><p>As the thought ran through his mind, Meng Qi also followed to pop out his right hand and also grabbed at the Drawing of Celestial Slaying Sword Formation.</p><p>The cardinal shook, the sword formation was in chaos, and the aftermath affected the senses. With interference everywhere, both Meng Qi and the Demonic Monarch chose the most primitive way to snatch.</p><p>Bending his six fingers and destroying the internals, the Demonic Monarch was in the midst of exploring when he suddenly straightened the finger and emitted invisible sword aura, half striking at Meng Qi’s hand and half pulling the formation drawing.</p><p>But at this moment, the formation drawing jumped gently and got into Meng Qi’s palm by itself as if it had its own wisdom, and also seemed to have a master that could manipulate it.</p><p>After getting the formation drawing, Meng Qi flipped his palm and used its back to receive the invisible sword aura. Dim light gathered at the auspicious cloud, forming chaos.</p><p>Swoosh!</p><p>The sword aura entered and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Pah!</p><p>With this force, Meng Qi threw the formation drawing at the core of the cardinal.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The four celestial swords emitted sounds like that of a dragon, and as the swords shook, they each shot out a killing sword aura that was far beyond the previous one.</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>The cardinal emitted red, green, black, and white brilliance, and the four sword shadows seemed to have substantialized. The territory of Great Zhou suddenly turned dark, and the sword auras maneuvered around with vast intent to end the world.</p><p>Restraint rewound over ten times or even a hundred times the previous.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The four colored sword beams twisted downward with aggression along the way, turning the projection of the Void Hometown into ashes right away, and the statue of the Ajati Matriarch collapsed before it was completely formed.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sword beam fell again. Having lost his ubiquitous ability, the Celestial Vase Ambassador couldn’t dodge in time and was struck at. The sword beam differentiated, entered different worlds and universes, and completely shattered his projection.</p><p>The Number One Archean Killing Formation deserves its reputation!</p><p>Throughout the entire process, the Celestial Vase Ambassador didn’t even have the chance to scream, and the Legendary figure was as fragile as a mortal. This made the Celestial Lamp Ambassador and the Celestial Ceremony Ambassador give up hope as they moaned for their ally. But they took the opportunity before the surging clear light was completely eliminated and jumped into the swirl regardless, and completely gave up the matter.</p><p>One dead and two escaped - it was a deliberate action by Meng Qi. To be honest, it was impossible that he who always bore grudges had no intention to take revenge for the Luo Sect’s repeated attempts to make things difficult. In the current situation, killing one celestial ambassador and letting two off was just a small punishment and not considered falling out completely.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Red, green, black, and white lights shot down, and the small universe collapsed. The battle between the Bull Demon King and Nezha was separated for now.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Amidst the light beams, the exquisite pagoda and the Taiji scroll, etc., were all shattered. One of the Roc Demon King’s wings was drooping, having sustained serious injuries protecting Qingqiu and other demonic deities.The other great sages were also wounded.</p><p>Seeing this situation, the Bull Demon King widened his eyes and understood the situation. He opened his giant mouth and got the Roc Demon King and the Dragon Demon King etc into the Interior Realm, planning to get out of the sword formation by force.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sword beams intertwined and the cardinal was at its peak. Countless airs of killing struck Yuan Hong’s body, crushing him into powder.</p><p>However, clear light flashed across the sky and Yuan Hong reappeared. Earlier on was just a change against the wind and his white hair had died in his place.</p><p>“A complete Celestial Slaying Sword Formation!” his head turned numb. Powering himself up, he wanted to use his sage body to counter the sword aura by force and get out of the sword formation.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Sword beams fell, and the Buddhist Kingdom was shattered. The Supreme Buddha and Maitreya separated and each made their own decision. One used himself and Damiaoxiang to form the Thousand Buddha Formation again to counter the sword aura. The other one had the surrounding shadows of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas display the Buddha’s Palm, and break out by force.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Demonic Monarch dodged awkwardly and was almost surrounded by sword auras.</p><p>…</p><p>Among the vast stars, the Devil Master Han Guang smiled as he looked at the changes below and said leisurely, “The Celestial Slaying Sword Formation is the Number One Archean Killing Formation, but the four swords have only awakened to the Legendary level after all and can barely deal with enemies who have just entered the Creation realm. They might not be able to keep Yuan Hong and the Bull Demon King.”</p><p>He turned his head, looked at Gao Lan and forced a smile, “Isn’t it time to show me your backup plan?”</p><p>Gao Lan did not turn around and was still looking down. He said in a low and calm voice, “After the Archean era, there weren’t many influential Nirvana characters who had passed on. The body of the Earth God merged into the Seal of Samsara, the body of the Demonic Lord was in all places, the Celestial Ruler used his own body as a blade, and the Demonic Sage used his body to create a spear. The whereabouts of their bodies were all known.”</p><p>He slowly looked toward Han Guang, his eyes like an eagle as he said each word with emphasis, “And what about the remains of the emperor?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
