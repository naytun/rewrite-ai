The restrictive spell which guarded the gates to its Heart of Formation, held down by the Plain Girl Sect using something unknown, was activated. Thus, it was about to be fully released.</p><p>“Go!”</p><p>Meng Qi cleansed away all his emotions of astonishment, shock, regret, and worry. He became clear about what he had to do. He activated his primary heart, allowing his voice to reach Gao Lan in order to sternly warn him to his senses.</p><p>If we don’t leave now we will never be able to make it out!</p><p>Just then, a scent which carried a sense of immense vicissitude rose from the rear hall. It filled the entire world in a blink of an eye, prompting the statues which depicted the Fairy of the Ninth Heaven from various universes to tremble faintly. Domes of galaxies lit up one by one before they started to droop, shining with vivid brightness.</p><p>Meng Qi felt trapped by a sense of rotting dread which he couldn’t quite wrap his head around. He felt as if he would be punished if he made a single move. He then noticed that the ancient coffin in front of the current Mysterious Fairy’s body was creaking open. A slender and graceful hand reached out from within, five pale fingers curled in unison, forming a fist. Slowly, the fist punched outwards.</p><p>The Mysterious Fairy of the Ninth Heaven is sloughing? Meng Qi’s field of vision was occupied by the snow white but extremely powerful fist. It was attacking from everywhere while Meng Qi had nowhere to run to. Furthermore, galaxies were being turned upside-down, sparkling like gravel, increasing in number. All the living spirits of this world could be easily crushed, just by the aura left by the fist.</p><p>While her remaining strength could never compare to the late mighty Great Medium, it was still formidable. Just looking at that punch, which seemed fairly ordinary, was already terrifying to Meng Qi. He felt as though his heart was about to burst, like a mountain was toppling over him, crushing him.</p><p>“Come at me!”</p><p>His voice thundered, shaking the entire hall. The Invincible Blade in his right hand appeared to transform into a purple lightning dragon, it was exceptionally straight and sturdy, containing immense power of Yang. His left hand wielded the Celestial Parting Sword, it swung half an arc and five colors of light converged, the expression was beautiful and had a flowing gentleness to it.</p><p>It was a meeting of a lifetime, a fight like this was a rare sight. Like Yin and Yang colliding, they resembled Black-White Tai Chi, snapping at the heels of one another.</p><p>Meng Qi’s acupuncture points opened as virtual shadows of Creator Brahma appeared around him. Primordial auspicious clouds floated down from above and connected with it. Meng Qi stepped into Tai Chi mode.</p><p>“Good move!”</p><p>With the reversal of Tai Chi, Yin and Yang became one as the universe began to collapse. The flurry of blades became an area of dim chaos. With a roar, everything in the surroundings had been devoured, including the frightening fist.</p><p>The void was shattered and time began to unravel. All things ceased to exist as chaos swallowed the universe!</p><p>Crack!</p><p>The walls and pillars which existed in the Plain Girl Sect for god knows how long were destroyed from the impact of the blades and fist clashing. Unrepairable huge cracks appeared all over. Following that, the chaos receded like the undulating motion of sea tides.</p><p>The moment Gao Lan saw the remains of the Fairy of the Ninth Heaven reacting, it triggered him to snap out of his daze and sorrow. He jumped awake, following Meng Qi’s stern voice, and took a step forward as he brandished the Emperor’s Sword.</p><p>“Doesn’t matter if it’s Heaven’s Will, humans will never give in!”</p><p>“Yan Ran, wait for my arrival at the Nirvana Realm, I will reverse time and change the past! I will resurrect you!”</p><p>With two loud claps of destruction, he penetrated through the aftershock. Gao Lan regained the resolve in his eyes, his perseverance ignited, fueled by his sorrows.</p><p>After having waited all these years, what is there left to lose?</p><p>If I cannot succeed, I would just die and vanish, what do I have to worry about?</p><p>A few beams of golden ray began to shine, merging with one another like a stream of a river, illuminating the darkness. The Light of Humanity converged to form a sword beam, striking into the undulating waves. It chopped at the snow white fist precisely.</p><p>As the brothers worked together, the windstorm suddenly engulfed the hall, knocking back the remains of the Fairy of the Ninth Heaven with raw power.</p><p>“Go!” Meng Qi grabbed hold of the opportunity and took a step back. He saw a flash of the Plain Girl Sect, yet from his location, Meng Qi was unable to establish a link to return to safety through the advent of air.</p><p>Gao Lan’s eyes were now dark and withdrawn, his expression was icy cold. Without any delay, he followed right behind Meng Qi.</p><p>At the moment, the clouds formed a sea in the sky, while voids of the sky glowed like amber. The Plain Girl Sect’s Heart of Formation was almost completely exposed.</p><p>Meng Qi with his quick thinking, summoned the closed-eye sacred warrior who sat before the Buddha to his side to prepare to grab hold of a link, to use the advent of air on this universe so that he can escape from the Plain Girl Fairyland. Just then, an ethereal but emotionless voice emerged out of thin air, “The two worlds are divided!”</p><p>Instantaneously, the amber glow deepened. Meng Qi found himself unable to detect any links from the other worlds outside, be it the Real World or various universes. It was as if he had vanished from the universe without a trace.</p><p>Is this the accumulated strength which allowed the Plain Girl Sect to protect its vigor from the Chaos of the Devil Buddha?</p><p>“Stay, visitors!” the ethereal voice sounded once more.</p><p>Immediately, Meng Qi and Gao Lan felt that they were both sinking into an invisible swamp. Invisible hands grabbed onto them, making it difficult for them to use the Air-Conveyance technique.</p><p>Primordial auspicious clouds began to soar again above their heads as chaotic dim light descended. Meng Qi relied on the Wu’Ji seal to destroy his shackles while he raised his arms, transforming into the ancient Dhajagga Sutta which combined with the Invincible Blade, cutting his way forward forcefully.</p><p>The gleam of his sword was bright beyond words, it promptly obliviated the invisible swamp with an explosive force potent enough to destroy all things created in the world.</p><p>While Gao Lan also utilized humanism over the Heavenly Way, he waved the pale golden sword across his torso, transforming into the ruler of the current world. Slashing apart the bramble of shackles, he advanced strenuously.</p><p>However, the strange Heart of Formation of the Plain Girl Sect was frighteningly abnormal. The two of them used up all of their techniques, yet they could only catch up with the rate that the Exterior Realm was disappearing, completely restrained by the invisible hands that were constantly regenerating.</p><p>Right then, the ethereal voice sounded without any emotion,</p><p>“The Myriad World Annihilation Divine Orb of the Ninth Heaven Ten Earths!”</p><p>Instantly, gaps dilated in the sea of cloud, each one of them leading into vast and endless universes. Stars were smashed apart as galaxies overflowed, stacking up constantly until it was about to become a black ball of destruction almost the size of the entire Plain Girl Fairyland.</p><p>By the minute amounts of aura it emitted, Meng Qi could discern that it was a lot more fearsome than Sha Wujing, whom he had met previously.</p><p>The sky and earth turned pitch black, and Meng Qi felt as if the world was ending. If this black ball of destruction came down, there was no way for him to survive. Besides, the two worlds have been divided, it might not be possible to revive depending on a sacrificial projection.</p><p>He exhaled at once, and emerging in his hands was a little emerald tree which shone with a misty green light.</p><p>When the tree appeared, a tremor was felt across the entire Plain Girl Fairyland, as if it had awakened and had its own life and intelligence. Without a care for the Myriad World Annihilation Divine Orb of the Ninth Heaven Ten Earths, the amber glow began to squirm and like a stomach, it expelled both Meng Qi and Gao Lan from this world. No words could express the horrifying sensation.</p><p>The Tree of Da Dao!</p><p>It devours all things in the Nine Levels of Heaven, at least for now!</p><p>This was the trump card which had allowed Meng Qi to journey to the Plain Girl Sect without any worry!</p><p>The lights and shadows changed before Meng Qi’s eyes as he found Gao Lan and himself falling into a vast ocean. They trod on the waves in a form which resembled a dragon god.</p><p>“Third brother, come and accompany me for a drink,” Gao Lan spoke in an extraordinarily calm voice without averting his eyes, as if he was hiding the iciness in the depths.</p><p>Meng Qi stored away the Tree of Da Dao and the Divine Invincible Blade, “Sure!” he replied without hesitation.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the Plain Girl Ancient Palace of Plain Girl Fairyland.</p><p>The corpse of the current Mysterious Fairy sat crossed-legged and still before the ancient coffin. She was beautiful and elegant as always, as if she was still alive.</p><p>Creak, creak, creak. The coffin opened, the remains of the Fairy of the Ninth Heaven sat up slowly. Her eyes opened, and although hesitant, they emitted a compelling aura. She did not give off a single sense of being a dead body, it was as if she had resurrected.</p><p>Moreover, her appearance was similar to Liu Luo, the descendant of the Mysterious Fairy!</p><p>She murmured to herself, “The Tree of Da Dao?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
