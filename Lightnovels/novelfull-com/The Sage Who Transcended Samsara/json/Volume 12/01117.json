This book was different from Gan Ruoxu’s version in everyday life because it had replaced all mentions of the emperor with the Eastern Emperor Taiyi’s, taking on an indistinct mysterious yet mystical aura.</p><p>Meng Qi’s pupils appeared a Dao Yi Glaze Lamp. He gently caressed Eastern Emperor Taiyi’s name with his right hand while connecting with his breath to sense for a reaction.</p><p>The surroundings began to waver. Blazing comets appeared, one in particular brimming with ancient vicissitudes connected with the East Emperor’s name, shooting into infinity.</p><p>The Principles of Karma flashed through Meng Qi’s senses, coursing through him like a bolt of electricity. Meng Qi followed one karmic thread as it raced forward into a tunnel of shadows and illusions, silence and darkness. It felt as though he was crossing through one realm after another.</p><p>Abruptly, a pitch-black space loomed ahead. Karma ceased to exist, and time appeared to stand still. Within the darkness, there appeared to be a strange creature capable of swallowing all creation. Meng Qi was so startled that he lost focus and violently rebounded into his conscious mind, opening his eyes.</p><p>“It was not Yuan Hong, the Great White Ape Sage, nor was it Han Guang…” he murmured.</p><p>Although unable to ascertain the identity of Eastern Emperor Taiyi, at least he had managed to eliminate certain possibilities.</p><p>To Meng Qi’s knowledge, few were capable of impersonating Eastern Emperor Taiyi without being discovered. Yuan Hong, the Great White Ape Sage, who held the Fragment of the Eastern Emperor Bell, Devil Master Han Guang, and Su Wuming were among the suspects, but his earlier traceback and perception had basically proved their improbable involvement.</p><p>This could be someone stronger, or even the possibility that the Eastern Emperor Taiyi was not truly dead! Meng Qi’s mind flashed back to where a monster was held captive beneath the Ancient Tomb of the Nine Lord of Immortals deep in the snowy mountains. The monster used to howl words that seemed to be Taiyi!</p><p>Could it be that the Eastern Emperor is alive, and have been holding on all this while so he can become a backstage manipulator of events?</p><p>Thinking back to the Chart of Deities Achievement Ranking, the Eastern Emperor in this book appeared to prevent himself from recovering the Seven-Kill Tablet, avoiding the mutation of the Endless Sea at all costs. Some peculiar ideas began to form in Meng Qi’s mind.</p><p>If the Eastern Emperor is truly alive and manages to hide this from God Hao Tian, then his current position is clearly skewed toward the Nine Levels of the Underground, and all things associated with him are now in a state of chaos… when the Demonic Lord abruptly broke through the barrier to cross into the Nirvana Realm, he took many influential figures by surprise. What was even more unexpected, was instead of taking the time to strengthen himself, he made the most unwise choice to attack the Heavenly Court…</p><p>Is it possible that Eastern Emperor Taiyi has something to do with this?</p><p>After all, only someone from the Nirvana Realm can defend against or trick a fellow realm member. He or she can direct the Demonic Lord and conceal oneself from the Demonic Lord’s knowledge!</p><p>If the Eastern Emperor is not dead, how does he manage to evade detection by everyone including the ancient and mighty God Hao Tian?</p><p>It was important to know that God Hao Tian was one of the most powerful beings in the Archaeozoic Era, if not as great as Heavenly Lord Yuan Shi, then at least on the same level as Buddha Amitabha. Regardless of how mighty the Eastern Emperor was, with such a weakened state, how did he manage to trick him?</p><p>Compared to the Ancient Mythological Era, the Archaeozoic Era had experienced many calamities, and had long been validated as being full of unsolvable mysteries. Meng Qi’s mind was racing, but he was unable to find a clear path of understanding. He decided to postpone the matter until he could meet and question Son of Hao Tian, Lu Ya to find out about his father’s war with Eastern Emperor Taiyi. Otherwise, he would visit the ancient Fusang tree when the opportunity came his way.</p><p>With a flick of his right hand, Meng Qi rolled up the Chart of Deities Achievement Ranking and closed his eyes, once again sinking into the chaotic heaven and earth, receiving the Premier Reflection. Who would care where in the universe this so-called Eastern Emperor Taiyi had projected himself to? There was nothing to worry about. After all, Heavenly Lord Yuan Shi had always been a premier deity in first class with countless retellings of history throughout millennia. Eastern Emperor Taiyi on the other hand, was merely a premier deity in second class; his influence was limited to just the Yellow Turbanism Sect of the Taiping country and small neighbouring kingdoms. He was not even recognized by the Blessed Nation and Wuduomi Sect, unlike Heavenly Lord Yuan Shi, who was widely acknowledged and mentioned in history and legends of almost all the major sects.</p><p>The Eastern Emperor could be defeated just by comparing Reflections!</p><p>…</p><p>Over the passage of time, Gan Ruoxu had foiled one after another plot against him. It was as though he had entered an inexplicable state where he no longer required any injection of power from the Heavenly Lord. In the areas of the Connection of Feedback alone, he was already among the most powerful person in existence.</p><p>“Ten years of piety, ten years of isolation. One day my name will be renowned throughout the world!” Gan Ruoxu opened his eyes and slowly rose to his feet. He made a respectful bow toward the Heavenly Lord Yuan Shi’s statue.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt the miniature tablet under the Dantian or Sea of Qi come alive. It spun rapidly, evolving into a bright light that pierced through his body and proceeded to fly out of the temple toward the open sky.</p><p>“Has the Heavenly Lord reclaimed this treasure yet?” Gan Ruoxu was startled. Despite receiving the tablet ten years ago, there was no opportunity to use it.</p><p>Has it all been for nothing?</p><p>Thoughts began to emerge, but were quickly retracted as Gan Ruoxu regained his composure. Based on his current relationship with the Heavenly Lord, what was the need for a mere object?</p><p>Go ahead and take it, I’ve got nothing to hold me back now!</p><p>He slowly walked out of Three Pristines Temple with his eyes looking straight ahead. He whispered in his heart, “Yun Gu, the Heavenly Empress, Lin Fengxiao, the Black Emperor, Zhang Zijing, the Eastern Emperor, here I come!”</p><p>…</p><p>As the tactical formation brightened up and layers of light shadows fluctuated, Xu Feixiang cried inconsolably, bidding farewell to his teacher or friend, Fairy Chang Er.</p><p>Despite all the traveling they had done together in the mortal world, fairies and men were two different beings. She was due to return to her realm eventually!</p><p>As the figure of Ruan Shuyu who was holding the Stone Tablet Bestowed by the Premier, faded into the distance, Xu Feixiang sobbed and shouted, “Fairy, I will prepare a sumptuous feast as an offering to you on every full moon!”</p><p>This was the most sincere and purest expression of adoration that was observed in many years!</p><p>…</p><p>In the Jade Palace at Kunlun Mountain, where restrictions were as many as the stars in the sky and infinitely powerful, a figure in a flowy white dress emerged from the depths of the universe, making an ethereal descent.</p><p>“Not bad. We can attempt something great with some polish, sufficient accumulation and a short period of isolated fasting,” Meng Qi smiled and nodded.</p><p>In these past ten years, Ruan Shuyu had not used any Secret Treasure Weapons. She had come into contact and dueled or even fought to the death with the likes of different deities such as the fully matured Empress Yun Gu, the Black Emperor Lin Fengxiao, and others. She had learned different methods of dealing with each deity based on their unique characteristics, and this gave someone like her, who was still seeking a path for herself an advantage of unpredictability.</p><p>Ruan Shuyu retrieved package after package from the White Mustard Ring, looking at Meng Qi and said, “Here are some local specialties from the faraway places I’ve visited.”</p><p>This too, was the purest and most sincere form of adoration.</p><p>After Meng Qi had accepted the Seven-Kill Tablet and local delicacies, she abruptly wrinkled her brows and asked, “Will I be able to accept Xu Feixiang’s offerings?”</p><p>“No problem, it’s free shipping across the realm,” Meng Qi replied with a straight face.</p><p>After a casual exchange of laughter, Meng Qi saw Ruan Shuyu off and began to stroke the tablet, preparing to descend upon the West.</p><p>Of course, traveling to the past with the Seven-Kill Tablet meant he could only stop for a limited period. He had to first ascertain the exact time and place when the heavens fell apart and the Sea Calming Pearl was lost. The best way to do this was to ask someone who had lived through this catastrophe, such as the Undying Fairy, the Donghai Dragon Emperor, or the Afflatus King who lived in the Nanzhan State.</p><p>Meng Qi had every intention of questioning each one, cross-examining their answers to prevent any discrepancies.</p><p>…</p><p>In the Nanzhan state, many lakes joined together to form what looked like a huge glistening ocean. It was patrolled by many strange-looking aquatic soldiers.</p><p>Guarding the administrative center were two crab generals. They moved back and forth, watching over the marine people. In a sudden blur of vision, a fresh-faced monk dressed in a water gown and a bamboo cloud crown on his head appeared.</p><p>“Hairy Crab Generals… hmmm… Crab Generals, this humble monk before you, Su Meng would like to see the Afflatus King regarding an important matter,” Meng Qi smiled and gave a respectful bow.</p><p>For some inexplicable reason, the two Crab Generals felt a sense of kinship with this monk standing before them, as though he was their own father. With a courteous and admiring expression, their response was unhesitant, “We will immediately notify His Majesty.”</p><p>One of the crabs left, diving into the bottom of the lake. He continued tunneling into the depths for an indeterminate amount of time until a gleaming, luxurious crystal palace came within sight. After announcing his intent and purpose, he finally saw the Afflatus King. The king was dressed in gold armor, his face resembling a fish. It turned out that he was the Goddess Guan Yin’s pet goldfish many years ago!</p><p>“A monk called Su Meng is here to see you, Your Majesty,” declared the Crab General.</p><p>The Afflatus King was in the midst of a blood meal, contemplating an increase in the number of child sacrifices to him in the coming years. With a cold smirk on his face, he replied, “Su Meng? Never heard of such a person. Kick him out!”</p><p>A loud noise resembling a raging storm thundered, startling the Crab General. Gathering his wits, he scrambled out as fast as he could. Just like that, Meng Qi’s request had been soundly rejected.</p><p>“What an odd fellow! Do you think that I, the Afflatus King, will deign to see you as you wish?” the Afflatus King murmured to himself.</p><p>Several moments passed. A sense of foreboding crept up on him as the marine folk around him began to panic. Crab General returned with a frightened look on his face, “My lord! That monk, Su Meng has just blocked the passage to our lake home. All the marine folks are unable to get out!” he reported.</p><p>Blocked the passage? A burst of gold light shot from the Afflatus King’s eyes as he looked toward the surface. There, he saw a monk dressed in a water gown sitting cross-legged with a striking violet sword of lightning across his knee. Electric bolts flashed intermittently toward every corner of the lakes, barring any marine folk from leaving. With the effort of him alone, he was able to effectively block the passage!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
