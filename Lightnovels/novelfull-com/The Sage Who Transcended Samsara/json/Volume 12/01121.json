He was also a demon fairy who could soar above the sea. The Heavenly Troops were defeated and fell into another’s hands at present. It was worrisome that they suffered a huge loss or even fell into the hands of some mysterious priest outside the palace. If so, why should he mind about his dignity?</p><p>As the proverb goes, never slap the smiler. Thinking back, when Sun Wukong just escaped the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit Cave of Water Curtains, nobody knew its name. Funnily, it even called itself the Born Saint when it came to the Donghai Dragon Palace. Even for it, he was cautious and went to greet it himself. He also defied his own wishes to obey Sun Wukong’s wishes. Even though he damaged his treasure, he never got himself injured.</p><p>Even Sun Wukong who had no fame could make him act that way. Who was to say what he would do for the mysterious powerful priest who showed the strength to suppress the Afflatus King?</p><p>Without bothering the astonished gazes by his dragon descendants and his army of crabs and shrimps, the Ancient Dragon King rushed to the door with his feet bare. He stepped outside the door and raised his hands, “Welcome to the Dragon Palace, come on in.”</p><p>He made some derivation during the process and found that the Afflatus King was alive but his vitalities were weak. Furthermore, he was not in Nanzhan State so he suffered huge losses and almost lost his life. Therefore, the Dragon King was more cautious.</p><p>Looking at the Ancient Dragon King with a dragon head and human body being polite and courteous, Meng Qi smiled and waved his hand to grab two broken golden hammers. He followed the Dragon King entering the pavilion into the palace. Then, he was seated on a high seat.</p><p>“How should I address you? Which Fairy Mountain do you practice Taoism in?” the Ancient Dragon King asked casually as his servants of mussels and jellyfish served tea.</p><p>Meng Qi picked up a teacup and took a sip. With a smile, he said, “My name is Su Meng. I’m from the Jade Palace of Kunlun Mountain.”</p><p>The Ancient Dragon King planned to flatter Meng Qi no matter where he was from. Having listened to his answer, he said without hesitation, “Kunlun Mountain is great, it’s a famous fairy… fairy…”</p><p>He started stammering in the middle of the sentence. Jade Palace of Kunlun Mountain?</p><p>The Jade Palace of Kunlun Mountain that disappeared for many years?</p><p>The Jade Palace of Kunlun Mountain that belonged to the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi?</p><p>This mysterious priest has an impressive background. No wonder the Afflatus King was crushed!</p><p>His flattering words stopped abruptly. The Ancient Dragon King’s lips halted and his expression changed. Observing his change, his dragon descendants were all shocked.</p><p>He calmed his emotions after a while, “Is it the place where Heavenly Lord Yuanshi performed Taoist rites in the past?”</p><p>“Exactly,” Meng Qi nodded leisurely.</p><p>For him, there was nothing to hide.</p><p>The Ancient Dragon King inhaled lightly. The fourth generation disciple of Explanatory Teaching is already born? Is the Final Trial coming?</p><p>The Ancient Dragon King was suspicious as Meng Qi didn’t show any proof and his tone was casual, but he did not have the courage to ask. He changed the subject and said, “Is there anything for you to come to Donghai Dragon Palace?”</p><p>“There are two things actually,” Meng Qi snorted and said. “I wanted to form the Four Person Sword Formation but I need another three Celestial Level Heavenly Swords. I’ve heard that the Dragon Emperor possesses many treasures, so here I am, asking for your help.”</p><p>Thump! The Ancient Dragon King’s heartbeat fastened as déjà vu appeared in front of his eyes. A golden-haired monkey walked towards him casually and asked for a Heavenly Weapon treasure by using their friendship as an excuse.</p><p>It’s the same situation all over again!</p><p>The previous monkey was not easy to handle. It seems like the person before me is also like that!</p><p>The dragon descendants around them were not as patient and sophisticated as the Ancient Dragon King. Although their expressions were fine, anger could be seen in their eyes. Since you’ll need three more Heavenly Weapons to form the Four Person Sword Formation, why would you even want to form the formation? This is exactly like if you want to have a whole roasted lamb for dinner but you only have a grill and the spices without the lamb!</p><p>“I wonder what Sword Formation you’re intending to form. I’ll see what I can do,” a Legendary Peerless treasure was not easy to come by and some mighty people do not even have one of them. Therefore, the Ancient Dragon King cherished his Celestial Level items the most. It pained him to even think about giving them away.</p><p>Meng Qi looked at the Ancient Dragon King with a faint smile, “The Fairy Slaying Sword Formation.”</p><p>Since the Afflatus King would not conceal for him, there was no point for him to hide anything.</p><p>“The Fairy Slaying Sword Formation? The Fairy Slaying Sword Formation!” the Ancient Dragon King leaped from his chair as sweat dripped down his forehead like raindrops.</p><p>The dragon descendants beside them fell silent and started shaking.</p><p>The Fairy Slaying Sword Formation!</p><p>The number one fatal formation in the Archaeozoic Era!</p><p>Since when did Aquamarine Palace and Jade Palace become so close that they can exchange supreme direct knowledge?</p><p>“You don’t believe me? The Afflatus King didn’t believe me before this so I let him have a taste. Then, he left his Heavenly Weapon to me,” Meng Qi had a feeling as if he fooled through the mundane world.</p><p>The Ancient Dragon King felt his heart aching like a thorn was prickling his back. He took a deep breath and said, “I, I will try to look for it. I’ll see how many I can find.”</p><p>These barbarians do not care about principles. The monkey took my Sea Calming Pin from me. It seems like I will lose another treasure again this time…</p><p>Meng Qi pressed his right arm and smiled, “You do not have to rush. I’m not a bully, I wouldn’t take anything by force. Since I want a Celestial Level Heavenly Sword, I will give you something else in exchange.”</p><p>He flicked his hands and the two broken golden hammers flew to the ground lightly without causing water ripples to the surrounding, “These giant hammers are Celestial Level Heavenly Weapons. Even though they are heavily damaged, their nature is still maintained. These would be worth half a sword.”</p><p>He pulled from his sleeve using his right hand as he spoke. A bright and clear crystal palace appeared within the Dragon King’s palace. Although minimized, various treasures could be seen from within.</p><p>The Ancient Dragon King and its descendants bulged their eyes. Isn’t, isn’t this the Afflatus King’s crystal palace?</p><p>This priest from Jade Palace moved almost everything from the Afflatus King’s place!</p><p>“Um, there is a Celestial Level Heavenly Sword in here. I guess I’ll only need two more,” Meng Qi only realized that there was a Celestial Level Heavenly Sword after going through the Afflatus King’s savings. That should be a Maha Bodhisattva and Great Arhat Level Buddhist Sword. But of course, it would not reach the level of Avalokitesvara Maha Kasyapa.</p><p>The sword’s body was emerald and bamboo-shaped. As if made from the wind, its insides were ethereal and it shone with glaze. It looked like it could light up a person’s mind. It was named as the Sword of Alaya.</p><p>As the Eighth Consciousness of the Buddhist Society, Alaya was born the moment everything was created in the universe. It could store any spells and illuminate any distance.</p><p>The Buddhist Sword must have been obtained by the Afflatus King from Putuo Mountain, where the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva started practicing Taoism.</p><p>After keeping the sword, Meng Qi also took some materials usable for Exterior Realm Dharmakaya. Even though he didn’t have many demands, he still needed to support his two disciples and his old guard. As for the other Heavenly Weapons, he did not take them for himself but used them to exchange for the Celestial Level Heavenly Sword after he calculated their estimated worth.</p><p>“Two giant hammers plus everything in here for two Celestial Level Heavenly Swords. What do you think?” Meng Qi pushed the crystal palace towards him.</p><p>The Ancient Dragon King who was prepared to lose his treasured items became joyful and said, “Fair enough, you are a just person!”</p><p>The Afflatus King had been plundering for many years and he found some great treasures from the Purple Bamboo Forest. He would definitely gain from this!</p><p>He was rather good at being a dragon. He never really checked the inventory of the crystal palace. He only gave a token of forbiddance and asked his descendants to obtain the two Celestial Level Heavenly Swords from the treasury of the forbidden place.</p><p>Listening to his tone, Meng Qi had an idea. He realized that the Ancient Dragon King had a rich collection built for years and generations. No wonder Sun Wukong was plotting against him.</p><p>Meng Qi took something out with a grin and pushed it to the Ancient Dragon King. He said sincerely, “This is the real gift for our first meeting. This is known as the Myriad World Talisman. It can be used to contact anyone that possesses such a talisman no matter how far the person is. Also, there are quite a number of good places that you can go by using this like the Myriad World Mall…”</p><p>His exaggerated tales about the Myriad World Mall made the Ancient Dragon King palpitate with excitement.</p><p>A cold shiver ran down Daqinggen’s spine all of a sudden in a room of the Jade Palace. He raised his chopper and muttered to himself,</p><p>“I will chop off my hands and break my legs if I go to the mall again!”</p><p>Light shone from the chopper and branches flew.</p><p>Not long after, some of the dragon descendants brought the two Celestial Level Heavenly Swords over following Ancient Dragon King’s orders. One of them was black with some clouds surrounding it. It was shaped like a minimized dragon. The other sword had a green base and it was engulfed with burning flames like wood and wind.</p><p>“This is known as the Soaring Dragon. It is complemented with water and obeyed by the clouds.” The Ancient Dragon King introduced, “This one is known as the Soaring Phoenix. Phoenixes live on plane trees. Use this sword and wind and flames will fill the sky.”</p><p>Meng Qi stroked the two swords lightly to feel the cave within after he accepted them. A scene with a black-scaled Real Dragon soaring in the sky and a brilliant phoenix flying near a plane tree appeared in his mind.</p><p>“Great swords!” he complimented and kept the two swords in his sleeve. He continued straight to the point, “The second thing is, I have a few questions that I wanted to ask.”</p><p>“Ask away!” the Ancient Dragon King was relieved.</p><p>“When did the fall of the Heavenly Court happen? Do you know the exact timing?” Meng Qi asked.</p><p>The Ancient Dragon King paused and looked sad afterwards, “It was six hundred and eighty nine years ago, at two thirty pm on the second day of the second month. The sky crumbled as lightning and fire attacked Donghai and the Dragon Palace was badly damaged. Many of my sons and grandsons died there…”</p><p>His voice was shaking.</p><p>“Wasn’t it three pm?” Meng Qi asked with confusion, not bothering to comfort him.</p><p>The Ancient Dragon King answered, “The wind and lightning were gone already by three pm. Also, the sky was dark like a deep cave so it was hard to estimate the timing. For those who were not at the scene, their sense of time was confused. I determined the exact timing based on my own priesthood and the breaking of the Heavenly Court.”</p><p>“Very well,” with the reference from the Afflatus King’s answer, Meng Qi could determine the time for backtracking. A precise point was not required as the Seven-Kill Tablet would give him choices to be selected from, “When did the Demonic Lord attack Heavenly Court?”</p><p>The Ancient Dragon King was confused with Meng Qi’s question. He didn’t understand the purpose of it but he didn’t ask. He answered frankly, “Six hundred and ninety five years ago, on the seventh day of the seventh month, to be exact.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded with thoughts running in his head as he asked about related events casually. The higher level fights were not related to the Ancient Dragon King and he was not interested in them. He would rather be worldly-wise and play safe so he’d rather not have any knowledge about them.</p><p>It seemed like he didn’t have to look for the Immortal Demon Fairy anymore. What happened in the Heavenly Court must be related to Lord Dao De and he must not be around the West to avoid troubles… furthermore, it must be dangerous when the Heavenly Court fell. The Donghai Dragon Palace must be safe since the Ancient Dragon King survived… as his thoughts flourished, Meng Qi made his decision and activated the Seven-Kill Tablet on the spot.</p><p>It is finally my time to return to the ancient times. I can now witness the spectacular and ever-changing era with my own eyes.</p><p>What else is there to see during the Heavenly Court’s fall aside from the fall of Heavens?</p><p>Light waves shone. Meng Qi’s figure disappeared from Donghai Dragon Palace abruptly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
