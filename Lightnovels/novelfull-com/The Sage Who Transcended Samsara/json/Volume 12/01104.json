The three thousand Nirmanakayas must stay united, and when the white sun ascends, they will coagulate into a Dharmakaya body. This was Meng Qi’s initial recognition about the Mysterious Fairy Sect’s foundation practice. Although some amendments were made later, its nature has never changed.</p><p>In other words, when the Mysterious Fairy of a generation wants to prove the essence of Taoism, they have to possess three thousand Nirmanakayas, and each Nirmanakaya will need to correspond with fate and emotion. Aside from the fact that the heaviness of karma could possibly force a Heavenly Trial, it is also a horrific challenge to a person’s soul cultivation base as they would have to accommodate three thousand experiences, memories, and personalities. If the cultivator is not focused, it could cause one to have a dissociated personality and confusing memory; they might even go crazy and be possessed by the devil.</p><p>Therefore, Nirmanakaya practices requirement to one’s soul cultivation base would definitely enter the top tiers within the levels of Exterior Realm to Dharmakaya. The genuine Equal Emotions was something even Meng Qi had to acknowledge as being inferior.</p><p>With such high requirements and dangerous way of cultivation, those who can achieve Nirmanakaya practice in the Mysterious Fairy Sect were numbered. Meng Qi never thought that the Mysterious Fairy of this generation would have silently paved her way to the borderline of a break through. He was amazed.</p><p>Gao Lan’s face showed no emotion, the solemnity of an emperor was obvious. He lightly nodded, “I found traces from the groups where the Mysterious Fairy Sect exchanged their experiences of cultivation, when added with the actions of the Mysterious Fairy’s Nirmanakaya caught under surveillance, it can be estimated that she’s about to make a breakthrough.”</p><p>“What traces? What actions?” Meng Qi wasn’t in doubt of his big brother’s judgement, he was just curious.</p><p>Gao Lan spoke steadily, “The few Mysterious Fairy’s Nirmanakaya were either dead or had their mortal fate broken apart, accomplishing their own experience. Meanwhile, the people who were likely to be Mysterious Fairies exited a few groups one after another.”</p><p>“The return of Nirmanakaya is normal, but returning one after another in a short period of time is indeed worthy of suspecting,” Meng Qi agreed. This meant that the Mysterious Fairy’s Nirmanakaya brought about the climax of the return. In other words, the Mysterious Fairy has completed the cultivation of three thousand Nirmanakaya and has returned to its original self, tidying up herself to be ready for the breakthrough.</p><p>He could not hide his curiosity at this point, so he asked, “Imperial Brother, what is so special about the group in which the Mysterious Fairy Sect exchanges their cultivating experience?”</p><p>Gao Lan was silent for a while and his gaze became dark, “They communicated about the genuine practice of cultivation and the art of sexual intercourse. They were very particular about the need of mutual Yin Yang and the conciliation of man and nature. If they got along well, they could meet each other privately, learn from each other and form a Taoist couple. One thing that is rather extraordinary would be that although some or all of the females in a group have different identities, appearances, manners, and personalities, all of them are the Mysterious Fairy’s Nirmanakayas. But the males in the group are unaware of it and they even guide each other on the cultivation method.”</p><p>Oh my god, Big Brother, how did you endure it when you entered into a group like this and witnessed scenes as such? Meng Qi breathed in a mouthful of cold air and felt that his pure little soul had been contaminated.</p><p>Gao Lan seemed to have guessed Meng Qi’s thoughts as he calmly said, “Yan Ran is Yan Ran and they are they. I have always been able to differentiate them clearly, or else how am I going to bear the experience of reflected self in the future?”</p><p>Luckily I am on the path of breaking apart the reflected self. Meng Qi decided to put that aside and he asked with care, “Imperial Brother, what are you going to do?”</p><p>“Of course I am going to hunt for an opportunity to let that part of Yan Ran replace the deity, Mysterious Fairy, at the crucial moment,” Gao Lan said with determination as he was playing with the Myriad World Talisman in his hands.</p><p>“You’ll have to handle the timing well then.” Meng Qi predicted based on his own knowledge, “Nirmanakaya practice is extremely demanding towards one’s soul cultivation base. There’s still a huge gap between the skills of sister-in-law Yan Ran and the deity, Mysterious Fairy, so you have to be very accurate when you act. You can only act when the deity, Mysterious Fairy, starts to absorb the rest of the Nirmanakaya sear, and her soul is dashed by initial shock but yet to accommodate them entirely. This might be only one or two short moments. If she acts early, how is sister-in-law Yan Ran going to bear the rest of Nirmanakaya’s memories and the erosion of emotions with her soul cultivation base? However, if she acts late, the deity, Mysterious Fairy, would have accommodated her completely, leaving no space for any turnaround.”</p><p>This was different to what Wu Jizhen said at the beginning, because there has been tremendous changes in terms of the knowledge in the current Meng Qi as compared to the Meng Qi in the past. He understood why the deity was a deity. As long as she never dies, Nirmanakaya will never be able to convert into a deity. It does not solely rely on emotions to cause a huge impact.</p><p>Gao Lan seemed to be very satisfied when Meng Qi addressed Yan Ran as sister-in-law Yan Ran. He softly nodded, “I collected some Nirmanakaya’s practice, so I am confident on choosing the right timing to act.”</p><p>“Not only to choose the timing but we also need to find the current Mysterious Fairy. She had deep karma and was deeply entangled with various men, so how could she not be prepared for the actions of people like you, Big Brother?” Meng Qi frowned and did his best to analyze, “Does Big Brother have any clue as to where and when will she pass the trials?”</p><p>He naturally addressed him with the title Big Brother that he was familiar with and liked the most.</p><p>Gao Lan pursed his lips, but his expression remained cool, “There are two choices. One, is to find the secret treasure that is used to conceal her process of passing the trial, just like how I did it before, but this way, she will not be able to utilize the power of Plain Girl Fairyland and the plot in it, she would only have a twenty percent chance to defend herself from the Heavenly Trial with the karma of Nirmanakaya practice. Her second choice would be to coagulate into Dharmakaya in Plain Girl Fairyland. She would have a bigger seventy to eighty percent chance to pass the Trial of Thunder. However, when Heaven’s Punishment befalls, it will cause a big stir that can penetrate Plain Girl Fairyland and leave us the chance to disturb her breakthrough. After the Devil Buddha’s chaos, the heritage of Mysterious Fairy Sect may not be able to protect themselves from accidents.”</p><p>“If I was in her situation, I would definitely choose the latter, as it is only possible for accidents to occur, while the Plain Girl Fairyland is part of the initial Nine Levels of Heaven with the characteristic of being everywhere. The current Mysterious Fairy could always choose an isolated and remote place where no matter how big the stir caused by the Heaven’s Punishment was, it would be hard to attract attention. Well, of course we should not rule out the possibility of the Mysterious Fairy Sect having something that could help her in passing the trials so she can secretly use the first method,” Meng Qi started to think that they were in big trouble. If they didn’t have accurate information, it was not something that could be solved with the current direct knowledge tactics.</p><p>So he suggested, “What about using Yan Ran’s birth details and personal belongings to make a karma toy, and when the current Mysterious Fairy start to absorb her, it can be sensed right away. The only problem is that it would be the last stage by then and advent of air will follow. The Mysterious Fairy only needs to do some slight set up and delay for a while to make things irretrievable. Big Brother, do you have any accurate clues?”</p><p>Although dummy Big Brother was mentally-ill, and always did unexpected things, he never acts unprepared. Resurrecting Yan Ran was his biggest wish until now, so he would have been preparing by getting information like the location and timing of the Mysterious Fairy’s breakthrough.</p><p>Gao Lan said calmly, “Using the martial arts interaction group between the Mysterious Fairy Sect and Joy Sect, I placed some death squads in there and incited the defection of some core members who were able to freely enter Plain Girl Fairyland, but the current Mysterious Fairy is very cautious when it comes to proving Dharmakaya. I guess no one would know when and where she is going to breakthrough until it has commenced.”</p><p>“Control one of the entrances of Plain Girl Sect beforehand with the help of a spy and dash in as soon as it starts?” Meng Qi suggested.</p><p>He silently cursed inside. He even sent someone to join the martial arts communication group of the Joy Sect. No wonder it was so hard for the Sect of Six-Fans to fight against pornography and illegal publication’, the very root of it was Great Zhou’s Emperor!”</p><p>Gao Lan put the Myriad World Talisman down and stood up slowly, “If she has started to get through the trial, the current Mysterious Fairy will certainly open the Plain Girl Fairyland. All the restrictive spells will be controlled by oneself.”</p><p>This is a hard one… Meng Qi was immersed in his thoughts. Many plans came into his mind but they were eliminated one by one.</p><p>At this time, Gao Lan placed his hands behind his back and came two steps forward. He said solemnly,</p><p>“So, I will not let her have the chance to decide when, where, and how to get through her trial.”</p><p>Huh? Meng Qi was shocked, and felt like he was starting to understand Gao Lan’s thinking.</p><p>Gao Lan’s gaze became sharp and he said in a deep tone, “I have been tolerating for many years to make her believe that I will only make a move when she has achieved Nirmanakaya.”</p><p>“But now, since we are aware of some of the entrances to Plain Girl Fairyland, Third Brother, do you have the courage to dash into the Plain Girl Sect with me and abduct the current Mysterious Fairy!”</p><p>Yes, if we have the Mysterious Fairy in our control, dummy Big Brother will be the one to decide when and where the Mysterious Fairy will go through her trial!</p><p>If the Mysterious Fairy is not willing to break through because of how they abducted her, it could be solved by Dharma practice like the Yuan Xin Seal and secret medicines. The difficulty of this task compared to their previous one was incomparable!</p><p>He fixed his gaze on Gao Lan. Meng Qi thought that his dummy Big Brother just looked so powerful now.</p><p>“Alright, then let’s dash into Plain Girl Fairyland!” he said with passion and confidence.</p><p>“You really are my brother.” Gao Lan nodded softly and then said seriously, “Third Brother, there is something that I’ve been regretting a lot.”</p><p>“What is it?” Meng Qi was astonished.</p><p>Gao Lan said seriously, “Yan Ran and I might have our own children when she is resurrected and undergoes Twin Practice with me. By that time, you will have to fall one step backwards in the line of succession to the throne.”</p><p>… Meng Qi was dazed, he thought it was something else. He smiled bitterly, “Imperial Brother, you are thinking too much.”</p><p>Can I praise a psycho for having a broad train of thought?</p><p>After the discussion about the Mysterious Fairy, Meng Qi quickly told him about the situation in the Endless Sea.</p><p>Gao Lan said in a deep tone, “The Emperor’s Golden Book has the Dharma practice that was mended and sealed by forces of living beings. As long as their natures do not conflict, I think the enchantment that was mixed with Buddhist Dao and seems to be the craft of the Qing Emperor can be put to use.”</p><p>The Qing Emperor? Meng Qi silently nodded. This was his guess, too.</p><p>The Nine Spirited Saint who was guarding the Nine Levels of Underground was his mount.</p><p>Gao Lan continued to say, “But it is a very difficult task to gather such massive forces of living beings and make them withstand the erosion of the Endless Sea to mend the enchantment. There must be a bearing object that can accomodate them and is able to defend the filth of the Nine Levels of Underground.”</p><p>“A bearing object?” Meng Qi started to think.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
