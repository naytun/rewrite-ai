Time is always cruel and heartless…”</p><p>Because of Meng Qi, he sounded a bit complicated.</p><p>As for Qi Xiaobai who was under Jiang Ziya, the remaining Jade Mirage orthodoxy of the World of Gods, and the new disciples of each could only be regarded as the foundation and not the top level.</p><p>Guangchengzi, Chijingzi, Priest Yuding, Celestial Lord Daohang, Manjushri Heavenly Lord Guangfa, Nezha, Yang Jian, and me… Meng Qi silently nodded. He now had a deeper understanding of Jade Mirage.</p><p>Guangchengzi stopped sighing and looked at Meng Qi, smiling slightly, “Junior Su, although you have gotten teacher’s inheritance for a long time, but it’s only today that you connect with us. You have to remember one thing, hah, we Jade Mirage Palace always help our own people disregarding whether it’s right or wrong.”</p><p>He bantered and started joking, putting a stop to all kinds of negative emotions.</p><p>I didn’t expect Heavenly Lord Guangcheng to be one who likes to self-deprecate and crack cold jokes… Meng Qi looked up at the pillars Jade Mirage Palace.</p><p>After livening up the atmosphere a little, Guangchengzi raised his right hand, the thumb touching the little finger while extending the three other fingers, “I have gathered all of you here today for three things.”</p><p>As soon as he finished, he and Manjushri Heavenly Lord Guangfa looked out of the hall, like there was going to be changes there.</p><p>Chijingzi, Priest Yuding, Celestial Lord Daohang, and Nezha were a little slower, while Meng Qi and the Celestial Hound were the last to sense the abnormality. When they looked over, a light golden glaze-like conveyance light was already close.</p><p>Looking at the Celestial Hound’s shiny and smooth fur, Meng Qi’s mouth slightly twitched. Talking about sensing abnormalities just now, darn, I’ve practiced for so many years and yet seem to be worse than a dog!</p><p>The Eight Nine Mysteries were known for being sharp in sensing, even before the wind moved. Therefore, at least in terms of realms, the Celestial Hound should at least be at the peak of the Legendary rea;,, and he was even worse than a dog…</p><p>In the midst of self-deprecation, Meng Qi saw that the conveyance light fly into the Jade Clear Hall and fell next to him, turning into a tall, thin but powerful figure. The man was wearing a black robe, his eyebrows were black and long, hanging from his cheeks, and he had a pair of gold and silver eyes that gave a lasting impression!</p><p>Gold and silver eyes? Time seemed to have turned back, but the future also seemed to have come in advance. The image that Meng Qi once saw flashed into his mind: he couldn’t self-attain the Legendary realm for a long time, until the twentieth year of the new calendar when the time came, the stars were falling and the powerful characters were all returning. The man with gold and silver eyes in front of him appeared in the Jade Mirage Palace of Kunlun Mountain and killed him because he coveted for the Principles of Karma.</p><p>At that time, there was no help from the powerful characters of Jade Mirage!</p><p>And now, the gold and silver eye character has actually come to Jade Mirage Palace!</p><p>Who is he under, and what is his relationship with Jade Mirage?</p><p>The gold and silver eye character first looked at Meng Qi before smiling and cupping his fists together as a greeting, “Since Senior Guangchengzi hit the bell, how can the Lamp bearer line be forgotten?”</p><p>“I, Dingguang, was instructed by my teacher, Lamp Bearer Buddha, Dipankara to come here to meet the seniors and juniors.”</p><p>Dipankara Buddha? So the gold and silver eye character is under Dipankara, no wonder he coveted the Principles of Karma! Meng Qi gained a sudden realization, but his expression did not show any change.</p><p>In that future, he had not been able to achieve the Legendary realm and hence not be recognized by the disciples of Jade Mirage. Under the mediation of Dipankara and the exchange of interests of the influential people of Nirvana, it was natural for him to be abandoned and replaced. He couldn’t point out any mistakes of Guangchengzi and the others as he didn’t have any friendship with them after all.</p><p>But now he had achieved Legendary realm. Although he dared not say that he was the most powerful in this realm, but at least he could easily deal with the powerful characters who had awakened in advance. Moreover, with the powerful skill of Creating Three Manifestations with One Breath, even though he had just entered the Legendary realm, he could also counter those at the peak by force. He had already gained the recognition of the Jade Mirage disciples and was officially considered a direct disciple of Yuanshi, hence his situation was no longer the same. If he carefully understood Guangchengzi’s joke about always helping our own people disregarding whether it’s right or wrong earlier on, it actually had a deeper meaning, so he needn’t worry that they would abandon him at will.</p><p>Of course, he couldn’t relax on things that he had to be vigilant about. At least he knew that the Dipankara line had a deep desire for the Principles of Karma!</p><p>When a celestial glaze lamp in the sacred mountain awed the heavens and he formed the Principles of Karma, he had deliberately avoided the look of the manifestation of Yuanshi and chose the glaze lamp. Thinking of it now, it seemed to be destined.</p><p>If Dipakara wanted to reach Nirvana, he probably had to enhance his own celestial lamp to the Principles of Karma…</p><p>As thoughts ran through his mind, Meng Qi heard Guangchengzi say, “Since Elder Dipankara is an ancient Buddhas of the past, why does he still need to bother about matters of Jade Mirage?”</p><p>Hmm, he addressed him as elder instead of uncle? Meng Qi had roughly grasped the mentality of Guangchengzi and other Jade Mirage disciples. It seemed that the two sides had had some unhappiness back then, and did not maintain harmonious relationships like Manjushri, Samantabhadra, and Cihang.</p><p>Other than his long eyebrows and strange eyes, the remaining features of Dingguang were more ordinary, but gave people a feeling of self-sufficiency, full of vitality.</p><p>He chuckled, “We are from the same sect after all, and it’s not easy to eliminate the karma. I shall just and not speak.”</p><p>After that, he randomly found a prayer mat and sat down. His pair of gold and silver eyes sank darkness as he quietly looked at the direction of Guangchengzi, but Meng Qi always had the feeling that he was looking at him.</p><p>Nezha still looked like a teenager, with red lips and white teeth like a girl, but he showed a valiant bearing and his eyes were sharp. At this moment, he slowly stood up, looked at Dingguang and snorted, “I do not like to have unrelated people listening at the side, are you going out yourself or do you want me to throw you out?”</p><p>He breathed heavily and was already holding a long spear in his hand.</p><p>This fellow really doesn’t give face when he’s worked up… Meng Qi secretly applauded for the kid.</p><p>Seeing Nezha’s murderous look, Guangchengzi and others looked down and did not bother, looking like they would help their own people. Dingguang’s expression slightly changed, and after measuring the strength of both sides, he forced a smile, “Since the estrangement between the two sides is already deep, I can only return to the Pure Land and inform my teacher.”</p><p>With the flash of a conveyance light, he flew out of the Jade Clear Hall.</p><p>Nezha sat down again and smiled. His mood was a day in the sixth month, changing very quickly and was a lot better. Meng Qi also felt happy inside.</p><p>As for Guangchengzi, he looked as though nothing had happened and continued to say, “The first thing, has Erlang found any clues searching for teacher’s whereabouts?”</p><p>He looked over at the Celestial Hound.</p><p>The Celestial Hound sat up straight, barked and said, “Erlang said that the clue is in the Qingwei Realm and the uppermost level of the Nine Levels of Heaven. You can go see it yourselves.”</p><p>The Qingwei Realm? The place where Yang Jian set up the monument for suppression? The realm that comes with the Aquamarine Palace? A thought struck Meng Qi, and he already understood what Yang Jian meant.</p><p>He set up the monument to suppress heaven and earth, and what he sealed was the clue to the whereabouts of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi?</p><p>If the Qingwei Realm sounded like a part of Qingwei Heaven’s Jade Clear Realm, how could the world attached to the Aquamarine Palace be this? Meng Qi secretly frowned, full of doubts. Compared to Heavenly Lord Yuanshi, Heavenly Lord Lingbao seemed to have disappeared more completely?</p><p>Now that I have attained the Legendary realm, I have to go there to take a look, find a way to enter the third level of the Nine Heavens and enter the uppermost level through the Gray Stone Hall…</p><p>Priest Yuding and the rest slightly nodded, showing that they understood, and did not say much about it.</p><p>Guangchengzi pondered for a while before saying, “The second thing, I do not know when Teacher will return and the Final Trial is the current issue now. Jade Mirage cannot be without a head, we have to choose someone for the position of sect master for the time being.”</p><p>“Woof woof, I recommend Uncle Su, no, it is Erlang who recommends Uncle Su!” the Celestial Hound frantically expressed loyalty, and its fawning attitude made Meng Qi somewhat suspicious.”</p><p>Pleasing me for nothing, what is this dead dog up to?</p><p>After the barking stopped, Chijingzi took a deep glance at Meng Qi before smiling, “Junior Su self-attained Legendary status, and has great success in the Principles of Karma. It’s a matter of course to be the sect master for the time being.”</p><p>“I also have the same thinking,” Priest Yuding said indifferently.</p><p>Celestial Lord Daohang also nodded, “It’ll be a joke if the Principles of Karma is not the sect master of Jade Mirage.”</p><p>Manjushri Heavenly Lord Guangfa looked around and said with a smile, “Yes, exactly.”</p><p>“I have no objections,” Nezha raised his hand as he said nonchalantly.</p><p>“That’s it then!” Guangchengzi made a decision.</p><p>Holy crap! The matter was decided before Meng Qi could respond. They agreed one after another, so fast that he felt it had already been fixed and suspected there was something fishy.</p><p>“I’m not being humble…” he answered subconsciously.</p><p>Before he could finish, he was interrupted by Guangchengzi, “Junior Su, everyone has already decided. You are also the sect master of Kunlun Mountain Jade Mirage Palace of the real world, so it is perfectly justifiable. Moreover, it concerns the emperor this time, so we need a temporary sect master to make a decision.”</p><p>Uh… the second half of the sentence made Meng Qi give up the idea of rejecting, and he smiled bitterly, “I’ll respect the decision then.”</p><p>It’s definitely not true to say that the second generation disciples of Jade Mirage such as Guangchengzi and Chijingzi are not interested in the position of sect master, but just the great success in the Principles of Karma was enough to dispel any of their desires… Meng Qi thought to himself.</p><p>Without the consent of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi, will there be new Principles of Karma?</p><p>What they fear is the thinking of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi!</p><p>“There are not many benefits in this sect master position. At least before reaching Nirvana, Jade Mirage Palace cannot be completely controlled.” Guangchengzi stood up smilingly and took a bow, “Greetings, Sect Master Su.”</p><p>Priest Yuding and the rest also stood up and bowed, “Greetings, Sect Master Su.”</p><p>The feeling of having powerful characters of the Creation and Legendary peak bowing at him was great. After enjoying it for a short moment, Meng Qi said, “Senior Guangcheng, the third thing is?”</p><p>After finishing his words, he came to a realization. Darn, I’ve already taken the temporary position of sect master and not given even one magic item?</p><p>Guangchengzi smiled, “The Final Trial is on, the demonic race and the Buddhist Kingdom are attacking Great Zhou together. Should we help the current emperor?”</p><p>“Taking control of the virtues at the core of the real world will help in rebuilding the Heavenly Court in the future, improve the netherworld, and get opportunities.”</p><p>The unworldly speaks last. Not waiting for others to speak, Meng Qi quickly said, “We Jade Mirage have always had a good relationship with the human race, and Senior Guangcheng is the teacher of two generations of the emperor. It is a matter of course for us to help the emperor!”</p><p>Chijingzi looked at Celestial Lord Daohang before saying with a smile, “The time and the layout by the various parties have come earlier than planned, we cannot fall behind also. We can try to help the emperor, but I have not fully awakened and have have only landed a bit of strength here with the help of something, so I won’t be able to come back to help for the time being. But don’t worry, sect master. I can still lend my strength and weapon even though I cannot come back!”</p><p>“Great!” Priest Yuding and Celestial Lord Daohang echoed.</p><p>Manjushri Heavenly Lord Guangfa also nodded slightly, “Sect master, you can take action without worries.”</p><p>Does this mean that I can borrow heavenly weapons such as the four Celestial Swords, Flip Heaven Seal, etc., along with a bit of strength of their original owners? Meng Qi was quite surprised.</p><p>At this moment, Nezha stood up and said, “Little uncle, how can a battle against the demonic race be without me?”</p><p>“I’ll take a walk around the various realms first. If there is anything, I will definitely go into battle!”</p><p>He showed two rows of white teeth as he laughed.</p><p>After the planning, Guangchengzi and the others conveyed out of the Jade Clear Hall one after another and returned to their places of residence. There were only Meng Qi, Nezha, and the Celestial Hound left in the huge hall.</p><p>After Nezha also left, the Celestial Hound suddenly jumped over and stuck out its tongue, “Uncle Sect Master, Erlang wants me to follow you for the time being.”</p><p>No wonder it was so fawning, so it was to please its temporary owner… Meng Qi finally understood the enthusiasm of the Celestial Hound. He got up and smiled, “Follow me back to Kunlun Mountain first.”</p><p>Stepping out of the Jade Clear Palace, the man and the dog directly manifested at Kunlun Mountain.</p><p>Sensing the return of its sect master, Daqinggen came out excitedly to receive him, wanting to ask about the celestial beings of Jade Mirage such as Guangchengzi, etc. But when it went out of the door and saw the Celestial Hound, he was stunned.</p><p>The Celestial Hound who was also suspicious jumped forward, sniffing as it went around Daqinggen, as though searching for some smell.</p><p>They are both spiritual beings of Jade Mirage, seems like the Celestial Hound and Daqinggen are old acquaintances? Fellow townsmen seeing each other? Meng Qi nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>But just as this thought came to his mind, he saw the Celestial Hound lift a hind leg and urinate at the bottom of Daqinggen.</p><p>Urine? Urine… Meng Qi was stunned, and Daqinggen was stonified.</p><p>“It’s really you!” the Celestial Hound sighed with a tone that sounded like it had finally found a royal toilet.</p><p>So Daqinggen has grown so strong because it has been watered by the Celestial Hound… Meng Qi held his forehead, not bearing to see Daqinggen’s expression.</p><p>Is this an ill-fated relationship?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
