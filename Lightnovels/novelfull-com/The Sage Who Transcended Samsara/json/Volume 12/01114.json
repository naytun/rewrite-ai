Nonetheless, he was very talented in securing personal gain. After he saw Gan Ruoxu receive the care and solicitude from Heavenly Lord Yuanshi, he intentionally chummed up with him whenever he found the opportunity. He even revealed his family treasure! Now that there was a real fairy, how could he not curry his favor?</p><p>A real existence would be stronger than the protecting god that could only be sympathetic, isn’t it?</p><p>Fairy Chang Er was cold and majestic. She was much more beautiful than the corresponding statue. Even if he could not get any benefit from her, he could at least feast his eyes.</p><p>Gan Ruoxu was also curious about the real fairy who came down to the earth. He echoed, “Sister Xu, we were shocked by the fairy’s arrival to the World of Mortals, and displayed poor manners. We were just thinking of going over to apologize.”</p><p>How could Xu Feixiang not know about Wu Ju’s careful thought? Since Gan Ruoxu, the esteemed person of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi had opened his mouth, it was difficult for her to reject. She smiled slightly and said, “Then you two have to be the lookout. We must not be caught by Rice Head and Vegetable Head and expose the fairy.”</p><p>To be frank, facing a fairy who came down to the World of Mortals, she was feeling uneasy in her heart. The voluntary act initiated by Gan Ruoxu and Wu Ju had made her feel more steady and sure.</p><p>With Gan Ruoxu’s magical powers and Wu Ju’s experiences of playing the fox, Xu Feixiang successfully snuck into the kitchen and stole the hare for lunch tomorrow. She put it in her arms and fled to her own yard.</p><p>After carefully looking at the wing-rooms on both sides, she made sure all her sisters of the same master were asleep. Xu Feixiang signaled to let Gan Ruoxu and Wu Ju sneak in.</p><p>As she pushed the door open, she saw Fairy Chang Er was virtually playing the guqin to the moon. She did it in a gracious manner, being unearthly elegant. She then looked over with her pair of beautiful eyes with clearly defined pupils.</p><p>“Fairy, I found this little fella on the road,” Xu Feixiang smiled brightly as she uttered the words she had prepared to say earlier, raising the hare with her hands pulling its ears.</p><p>Gan Ruoxu and Wu Ju exclaimed, “Maybe it escaped from the kitchen, how pitiful is this little fella!”</p><p>Hopefully this white hare could make the fairy smile.</p><p>They were not let down. In their sight, the cool and unearthly elegant fairy gently nodded her head, and opened her mouth slightly, “Not bad, it was very thoughtful of you.”</p><p>Not bad? Very thoughtful? The fairy praised us! Xu Feixiang twisted her head sideways and looked at Gan Ruoxu and Wu Ju respectively. In her eyes, there was uncontrollable happiness. She secretly clenched her fist.</p><p>Then, they saw Fairy Chang Er wave her hand, and the white hare flew up to the sky. The hare was cast over, but there was no sign of magical powers.</p><p>She surely deserves to be the Moon Palace Fairy!</p><p>In the secret praises, they looked at the fairy gently touching the neck of the white hare with a joyful heart.</p><p>The fairy liked the Jade Hare as expected. Her coldness had turned into gentleness!</p><p>Just as the idea popped into their head, suddenly they saw blood spurt out from the neck of the hare.</p><p>The blood spurted out and squirted… the three teenagers of two boys and a girl seemed to have turned into ice sculptures, and solidified in stone.</p><p>The blood flew into the air and disappeared directly, it never contaminated the room. Xu Feixiang and others heard the Moon Palace Fairy coldly say, “If you don’t clean the blood of the hare, then it will easily cause the meat to taste gamey and sour in texture, and this will cause the ingredients to go to waste.”</p><p>“Yes,” Xu Feixiang, Gan Ruoxu, and Wu Ju were stunned as they answered. There was only an idea that kept running through their minds, what is she talking about…</p><p>In their eyes, Ruan Shuyu was gracefully processing the hare. She removed the fur and organs in a well-ordered manner. Lastly, she took out the utensils and seasonings from the ring on her hand.</p><p>“Whether the roasted hare tastes good or not, half of the effort depends on the seasoning beforehand. I just got a marinate recipe, I’ll try it today,” the standard voice tone of a fairy was speaking words that made Xu Feixiang and others feel completely in the dark.</p><p>Seasoning beforehand? Recipe of a roasted hare?</p><p>“It takes some time for the seasoning to set in. Let’s take the opportunity to prepare a charcoal fire. We need a smokeless and dustless one,” Ruan Shuyu said, while taking out the highest grade charcoals from the White Mustard Ring.</p><p>…</p><p>After some time, a ray of moonlight shone into the room. Xu Feixiang, Gan Ruoxu, and Wu Ju sat in a line, each of them holding a piece of hare meat in their hands. The hare meat tasted crispy and toothsome, it was so delicious that they just could not stop eating.</p><p>“How is it?” Ruan Yushu swallowed the last hare meat in her hand, and looked at the three people opposite her with expectant eyes.</p><p>Xu Feixiang’s mouth was stuffed with the hare meat, so she nodded her head to indicate that it was tasty. Gan Ruoxu and Wu Ju also spoke respectively and praised its superb taste.</p><p>After that, they saw the corners of Fairy Chang Er’s mouth curve up and show a shy smile. It was breathtaking.</p><p>“The fairy finally smiled as expected…” Xu Feixiang and the two others spaced out for a short while.</p><p>The goal was achieved, however, they always felt that something was not right!</p><p>…</p><p>A few days later, Gan Ruoxu visualized the statue of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi in Three Pristines Temple. The temple had been closed specifically for him. There was no one else, the surrounding was empty and quiet, as if he was in the Jade Palace located above the Thirty-Three Levels of Heaven.</p><p>At this time, there was a person holding the token of the temple master who passed through the layers of the Restrictive Spell and pushed open the main door. The midday sun streamed in and shone goldenly. It had dispersed the darkness and thoroughly lit up the temple.</p><p>Gan Ruoxu did not look back. He was in the visualization and felt an impulse in his heart, as if he had seen it with his eyes. He blurted out, “Sister Xu.”</p><p>The person who came was truly Xu Feixiang. Her eyebrows and eyes sparked with joy, and looked more youthful and beautiful with compelling Reiki. She lowered her voice and said, “The fairy wants to bring me along to travel around the world, and increase my cultural knowledge in different parts of the world. I found an excuse, and already got the master’s permission.”</p><p>It had been a year since she enrolled. Based on her rapid progress in theurgy, she could protect herself with her own ability. It was the right time to travel around the World of Mortals, and practice the Dao which was corresponding to protecting the fairy god. With that she could deepen the sympathy level, and acquire more strength and direct knowledge.</p><p>Gan Ruoxu admired this, and said sincerely, “I hope so, too. Unfortunately, as the person favored by God Master, those with evil intentions were too many. Without a world-class ability, I would not dare to travel far, and I’m afraid this might take five to ten years’ time.”</p><p>“You can follow us. With the fairy, who would dare to play a trick on you?” Xu Feixiang said in high spirits.</p><p>The fairy who came down to the World of Mortals, would could beat that?</p><p>How could the strength of the fairy god through the theurgy be comparable to the fairy god itself?</p><p>Gan Ruoxu sighed, “I know things would be fine if I tag along. But the master would not believe it, moreover, we can’t reveal the existence of the fairy. He definitely won’t let me out.”</p><p>“Well, take care of yourself, Senior Brother.” Xu Feixiang laughed playfully, “It seems like your ten years of cultivation without anyone knowing will shock the world when you emerge from the mountains.”</p><p>As Gan Ruoxu watched Xu Feixiang leave the Three Pristines Temple, he once again sighed heavily. One has to pay for the equal price in relation to the type of precious care and solicitude one receives. Youth, freedom, arbitration, etc. will all stay away from me. Five years of hard practice and ten years of loneliness will be my future life.</p><p>Nonetheless, it was of his free will, and he was perfectly satisfied with it.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Xu Feixiang closed the door of Three Pristines Temple again. The bright turned dim, cool, and silent.</p><p>Gan Ruoxu turned around, once again sat in front of the statue of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi with deep eyes and sorrowful temples. He closed his eyes, and immersed in his visualization. One big and one small, one high and one low, sat down relatively and formed a sharp contrast, revealing a certain sacred meaning.</p><p>You have to endure similar levels of loneliness in accordance to the level of success you would like to achieve!</p><p>Hopefully, the national guard temple could protect his parents.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the capital city, a carriage sped by and seemed to be escaping from something.</p><p>There was a man and a woman sitting in the carriage. The dress of the woman was gorgeous, with the style of a remote area. She was tapping the copper plate in her hand. The clanging sounds partly appeared then partly disappeared, as if it could drill into hell and arrest the ghosts.</p><p>A man was in a high crown and dark robe. He looked arrogant just like Lin Fengxiao, the person favored by the Black Emperor Zhenwu!</p><p>“Sir, as long as you join the Teaching of Five Pecks of Rice, you will be able to lead the Yang Ping Precinct immediately, and worship the Sacrifice Liquor,” the woman in gorgeous dress said with a smile.</p><p>The region ruled by the Teaching of Five Pecks of Rice was known as the Taoist Kingdom, combining politics and religion together, and the Lord Master was the top-ranked leader. Under him, it was divided into twenty four third-class precincts. Each precinct revolved around the Sacrifice Liquor, also known as Du Gong.</p><p>The Yang Ping Precinct was the first of the twenty four precincts. Generally. it was directly ruled by the Lord Master. This had made the meaning behind making Lin Fengxiao the Sacrifice Liquor of Yang Ping Precinct to go without saying.</p><p>And the Sacrifice Liquor Official Seal of Yang Ping Precinct was also known as the Yang Ping Precinct Du Gong Seal!</p><p>Lin Fengxiao sat upright, nodded slightly and said, “The National Guard Temple refuses to give prominence. I am just about to leave, but your sect really shows much sincerity.”</p><p>As the person favored by one of the Five Wisdom Buddhas, how could he be placed under others?</p><p>The woman smiled with her lips closed and tapped the copper plate. She closed her eyes to feel for a while and said, “The Sect Elder of the National Guard Temple is deceived by the ghosts as expected, and are misled in the wrong direction.”</p><p>…</p><p>Above the boundless sea, at the core of the fog, the battleships full of Restrictive Spell quietly moored there. On the chief battleship, there was a girl with almond eyes standing with her hands clasped behind the back at the fore.</p><p>“Not only the person favored by Zhenwu appeared, but the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi is also showing concerns to the mortals?” the woman was wearing a purple robe. Her clothes were drifting in the wind, revealing a dignified appearance.</p><p>Next to her stood a terrifying general. He replied with respect, “Correct, and the direct knowledge is so horrible that it can reverse life and death. Currently, he is practicing in the National Guard Temple.”</p><p>Outside the cabin behind the general, there was a picture scroll hanging there, a picture of the position of the fairy gods.</p><p>The woman in purple smiled with her eyes shining, “It is certainly a great battle. I want to land on the shore to widen my knowledge.”</p><p>Before she finished her sentence, she already took a step and disappeared in the fog. And on the picture of the position of the fairy gods behind her, the name of the Celestial Ruler which was on the center of the second row was slightly glowing, and it seemed to be echoing!</p><p>…</p><p>In a deep quiet room, a weird man with a yellow towel covering his forehead, blindfolded his eyes and sat on the floor. There was also a picture of the position of the fairy gods in front of him.</p><p>This picture was different from the usual one, and the difference was only in one place.</p><p>Suddenly, the name at the center of the second row on the picture of the position of the fairy gods glowed and the light sprinkled on the man.</p><p>The man raised his head. Although his eyes were blindfolded by the yellow towel, his gaze was like it was real solid. He lowered his voice and mumbled to himself,</p><p>“Killing the person favored by the premier at all cost?”</p><p>The name that was glowing was neither Lord Xuantian, nor the abbreviation of Celestial Ruler, but the Eastern Emperor Taiyi!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
