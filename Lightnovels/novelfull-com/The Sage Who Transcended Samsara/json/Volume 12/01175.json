Facing the temporary Purple Star Master Shaoxuan and Heavenly Lord of Lightning Xi’e, he threw his left hand forward and the Human Sack flew out. Changing with the wind, it swayed open, and the white lotuses inside were receiving items that embraced all living things into the Buddhist Kingdom.</p><p>The item was formed by external factors, to save all the fated ones in the world.</p><p>Enveloped by this renowned ancient treasure of Buddhism, brilliant stars flew out from around Shaoxuan’s body. There were a total of three hundred and sixty-five stars, forming a large array of stars that surrounded him, resisting absorption.</p><p>Every one of these stars had an ancient feel. Running through the various worlds, each had its own galaxy projections of different universes. They were ancient stars born within the Celestial World, limited in number and every one of them were majestic and powerful.</p><p>Under the water-like starlight and the strict formation, the momentum under the Human Sack suddenly slowed down.</p><p>Compared to earlier on, Shaoxuan’s strength had already surpassed the two Bodhisattvas Fahualin and Damiaoxiang. Even if faced with the Human Sack or the future Buddha Maitreya, he seemed not at all inferior.</p><p>At this moment, Maitreya pointed his right hand, his voice thunderous, grand and solemn, “Close!”</p><p>As soon as the voice was heard, invisible cymbals from an infinite distance seemed to close up above and below Shaoxuan and Xi’e.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The ancient star projections around Shaoxuan were crushed and he was covered by the Human Sack, struggling to brace himself at the opening of the sack as he got inside in a slow and determined manner.</p><p>Even though they were both close to the realm of Creation, Maitreya still showed the power of a once great supreme character, almost conquering Shaoxuan in a destructive manner!</p><p>Of course, it was also because the Heaven Conferring Platform wasn’t complete such that it was difficult for Shaoxuan to obtain the full authority of the Purple Star Master.</p><p>On the other side, Xi’e pulled with both hands and the Last Ship reverberated with lights around it, protecting her and resisted the absorption of the Human Sack However, Fahualin and Damiaoxiang displayed their individual powers, hitting with a Buddha light and overturning the Ganga, shaking her left and right in an extremely difficult situation.</p><p>Even though she could be everywhere, she still couldn’t get out of this situation!</p><p>Maitreya did not bother about Shaoxuan and Xi’e. Still smiling, he slapped his thigh with his left hand and a white lotus platform flew forward. Surrounded by golden swastikas, lotus petals, and a chanting Buddha, he lowered his right hand and turned it into a giant palm, grabbing at the Heaven Conferring Platform roof, wanting to pull it up and take it back to the Buddha Kingdom.</p><p>The palm covered all directions, with layers of pure land on it and countless Buddhas and Bodhisattvas chanting the name of Maitreya, making it impossible for people to escape.</p><p>The virtual image of Gao Lan on the platform looked on with cold eyes that had no trace of panic. The emperor’s sword suddenly erupted and dashed into the clouds in a pale golden color, turning into thirty-six yellow water lights that lined up in the sky and smashed toward the pure land in the palm of the Maitreya.</p><p>Sensing the end of the world had changed in advance, the Emperor’s Sword quietly awakened to the Legendary level.</p><p>This was another strength and confidence why Gao Guan, Shaoxuan, and Xi’e dared to build the Heaven Conferring Platform.</p><p>“Namo Amitabha,” Maitreya chanted Buddha’s name again. Pressing his palm, the pure earth emitted the light of Buddha, scattering the thirty-six yellow lights of virtues.</p><p>However, when his palms continued to move down, the collapsed yellow water lights once again agglomerated and turned into a beautiful picture of mountains and rivers, which was the shrinkage of the current twenty-seven states of the Great Zhou Dynasty.</p><p>They were all colored and intertwining, vaguely passing through earth and connected to their respective corresponding states.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>There was a slight vibration in the territory of the Great Zhou Dynasty. The beautiful picture of mountains and rivers showed resonance with this part of the real world.</p><p>Maitreya’s palm stopped before there was any contact.</p><p>Because attacking this beautiful picture of mountains and rivers would be equivalent to attacking the territory of the Great Zhou, and also equivalent to attacking the core of the real world, which would inevitably result in serious counter-attacks.</p><p>This was the real world, the core of all heavens and realms that was second only to the Celestial World and Netherworld, a place where Creation and Legendary supremes would be suppressed, and where the counter-force could also threaten their own existence if it was destroyed.</p><p>This was the true meaning behind the protection of the Forces of Living Beings, and it was one of the strengths and confidence of Gao Lan!</p><p>If Maitreya was an evil spirit of the Netherworld, he could give it a fight to see if the joy of the Netherworld could resist the counter-force of the Great Zhou territory. Unfortunately, he was the future Buddha. He had to build the Buddhist Kingdom on earth, and his Sambhogakaya had already been re-cultivated. Such a move that caused natural disasters and destruction would immediately lead to the fall of his Sambhogakaya and sink the Buddhist Kingdom into depravity. Even if he still had his Dharmakaya body, he was currently still unable to maintain his strength at the peak of the Legendary realm.</p><p>So, he hesitated.</p><p>He did not expect that the Heavenly Conferring Platform to be able to form the beautiful picture of mountains and rivers even though it had not been completely built!</p><p>Looking at the cold and indifferent Gao Lan, Maitreya’s right palm seemed to have frozen in the air, and his face that was full of smiles showed signs of lament.</p><p>Suddenly, the voids separating the two world suddenly split open, and a golden ray emerged, striking toward the back of Gao Lan at the moment when the beautiful picture of mountains and rivers stopped Maitreya, covering the entire Heaven Conferring Platform but had yet to land!</p><p>It was a golden wing that looked like a sword. With cold light and the feel of ancient times, it seized the best opportunity.</p><p>At the crack of the void was a pair of golden eyes looking on coldly.</p><p>“Master Roc…” Maitreya said in a low voice.</p><p>The great sage of the demonic race, the Roc Demon King, who had yet to recover to the level of Creation, had struck!</p><p>Neither the Buddhist sect nor the demonic race would want to see the Heavenly Conferring Platform being built!</p><p>Remove the source of trouble, kill the emperor!</p><p>At this moment, a golden light flashed across the stunned Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu. They saw the gold book given by the sect master flip quickly, emitting infinite light, filled with the Forces of Living Beings and illusory money shadows, forming a Heavenly Lord statue that looked like Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi’s Heavenly Lord statue was expressionless. It took a step forward, made a fist with his right hand and suddenly smashed out. The money shadows intertwined with the Forces of Living Beings, penetrated the void and hit the golden wing directly before it struck Gao Lan.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As the golden wing fell slowly descended, the Forces of Living Beings and the illusory money shadows collapsed, but integrated into the beautiful picture of mountains and rivers, covering Gao Lan and the Heaven Conferring Platform.</p><p>“Su Meng!” the Roc Demon King roared in shock.</p><p>Didn’t the celestial ambassador of the Luo Sect isolate him from the real world and trap him in the projection of the Void Hometown?</p><p>He instructed his disciples to travel the world just to wait for this strike?</p><p>The Principles of Karma can really fool everyone!</p><p>…</p><p>“This amount of time is enough for me to defeat you!”</p><p>Accompanied by this voice, the Celestial Ceremony Ambassador saw Meng Qi’s hands form a mudra sign before pressing the chaotic Wu’Ji Seal.</p><p>Feeling puzzled as his scalp turned numb, he quickly displayed his powers while flipping the scriptures in his hands.</p><p>White lotuses flew out, and were swallowed by chaos.</p><p>The light that came down from the Void Hometown lingered, and was swallowed by chaos.</p><p>The sleeves were raised, and Qiankun was recreated, heaven and earth that were rebuilt were also swallowed by chaos!</p><p>In a short moment, the Celestial Ceremony Ambassador showed a variety of magical powers. However, the pressed Wu’Ji Seal did not slow down at all but distorted his sense of the direction to the void and his judgment of time and speed. It seemed that he could only watch helplessly at the Wu’Ji Seal attack but unable to do anything.</p><p>Silently, the protection enchantment he had built earlier on was also returned to its original by the Wu’Ji Seal. He had used all his strength but could barely counter.</p><p>I can’t even resist a single strike from him?</p><p>The Celestial Ceremony Ambassador felt frustrated and hopeless.</p><p>No wonder he said that this amount of time was enough!</p><p>The Wu’Ji Seal displayed by the real body of Yuanshi was really not at all inferior to the Buddha’s palm displayed by the Buddha Golden Body!</p><p>He let out a sigh and stopped struggling. With a shake of his hands trembled, the scriptures in his hands were completely shattered, turning into a dark whirlpool.</p><p>Clear light emitted from the whirlpool, seemingly connecting to the depths of the Void Hometown. A jade-like palm slowly came out, and its majestic presence directly slowed down the falling Wu’Ji Seal!</p><p>It was a celestial ambassador who had yet to be awakened. It was a powerful character of the Creation realm who was in a deep sleep through the channel across the two worlds, and showing a hint of strength.</p><p>This was the hidden means of attacking the Jade Mirage Palace by the Luo Sect!</p><p>As an influential character of the Nirvana realm, how could the Ajati Matriarch have no judgment on Meng Qi’s abilities?</p><p>As his palm came out, the real spirit Meng Qi was looking down at seemed to freeze as it felt the horror of a powerful Creation realm character.</p><p>Just as he was about to burn himself completely to operate the Wu’Ji Seal, he suddenly heard a melodious sound.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The bell rang and echoed the three realms, causing the palm to pause.</p><p>Meng Qi looked at high up in shock as thoughts ran in his mind:</p><p>Why is the sound of this bell so familiar?</p><p>It’s the Jade Mirage Bell!</p><p>Who rang the ancient Kunlun Bell inside the real Jade Mirage Palace?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
