He utilized his Dharmakaya, condensed his Divine Sense and formed indelible rays of mild golden light which then flowed like water and extended into his body.</p><p>With a boom, his Dharmakaya shook and his senses were no longer the same. The interior of the Dim Whirlpool was a boundless vast, Chaotic Holes formed by perishing collapses were everywhere. The holes were near to each other, devouring each other and grew constantly. It was magnificent yet scary.</p><p>More importantly, all those endless elevations seemed as if they were falling down, collapsing and falling apart, which lowered the legendary nature throughout this boundless and gloomy precinct. As such, he could not depend on Dharmakaya alone to be ubiquitous and view the whole place in order to find the clues.</p><p>After figuring out the preliminary situation, Meng Qi was confident that he could handle it. He took a breath and pushed the Dao Crown, causing many chaotic auspicious clouds to flush out of Niwan. Dim lights were hanging down like a water curtain with thousands of golden lights inside while blossoming golden lotuses were floating.</p><p>Meng Qi stepped forward and fell into the Dim Whirlpool which was filled with perishing and termination. The water-curtain-like chaotic dim lights around him swayed as they digested and accommodated all those destructive storms, lights of termination and so on. It entered the boundless, universe-like vast after they passed through the tunnel smoothly.</p><p>After leaving trails to identify the roads, he walked around the margin of Chaotic Holes and tried to explore toward the deeper side. The terrifying dragging force could only mildly swing the chaotic dim lights hanging down from those primordial auspicious clouds.</p><p>At the moment of bypassing the Chaotic Holes’ galaxy that blocked his Dharmakaya, something struck Meng Qi’s mind suddenly. A glaze lamp rose to reach his eye level and illuminated the dimness at his left.</p><p>There seems to be a shadow floating at the distance of a galaxy away!</p><p>It was not due to the effects of his senses being suppressed by the current environment. In fact, it came from the premonition of Legendary Phase of Arts of Eight-Nine.</p><p>Although Meng Qi only obtained the first three chapters of the Arts of Eight-Nine in Jade Mirage Palace without grasping the subsequent chapters of it in hand as the path of the Legendary realm required self-exploration, he still managed to enter the Legendary Phase, which gave him a stronger ability to reveal the mysteries of heaven and premonition that was stronger than Buddha’s, and it was close to the combination of nine senses into one. Thus, others would be able to sense him from afar.</p><p>A Magic Cloud appeared under his foot and he tore the void apart with both his hands. Meng Qi descended to the spot where the shadow was but there was nothing there. The space and time at the common border of a few expanding Chaotic Holes dragging each other was distorted and countless illusions were created.</p><p>“Was it an illusion?” Meng Qi frowned. Was it an oversensitive effect caused by the Arts of Eight-Nine?</p><p>He reviewed his thoughts and recalled the moment just now. There was still a possibility that the shadow did exist.</p><p>If the shadow is real, is he an aboriginal of this precinct or has he been following me discreetly to investigate the person who peeped on Heavenly Lord Yuanshi’s tracks?</p><p>Meng Qi was getting more alert. He held the handle of the Invincible Blade tightly with his right hand while he explored the surroundings.</p><p>Even if there was no discovery, he kept himself alert and moved toward the deeper side.</p><p>After passing the Chaotic Holes’ galaxy, Meng Qi came to an open area. His eyes reflected the scene of a world rolling and raging in red, green, black, and white.</p><p>They omitted an ancient vibe, very far away from the present. They seemed as if they were the ground power, fire power, wind power, and water power which had not been stabled by the Tai Chi Diagram during the time when the earth and heaven were just only pioneered. Other than these four powers, all the other matters died after they grew. They then regrew after their death without having the ability to remain in a stable form.</p><p>Meng Qi sensed the scene from a distance away. His Four Elephants Seal seemed as it was responding to the scene. It maneuvered around the elements of earth, fire, wind, and water which were crazily wreaking havoc and went forward by shifting in the void.</p><p>After a while, Meng Qi was suddenly stunned as the piece of earth, fire, wind, and water was covered with haze. They had their own border and was semi-separated and semi-overlapped with the surrounding vast dimness. It was strange as it seemed like a part represented the past, while another represented the present. Also, their gaps were broken by some type of tyrannical force which dragged them together.</p><p>“Were these pieces of the past? Were these the earth, fire, wind, and water during the time when this precinct was pioneered into earth and heaven?” Meng Qi wondered as this was his first time encountering such a situation.</p><p>He wanted to ask Gu Xiaosang but the information he obtained was still not enough. Hence, he only transferred what he saw and heard before he continued forward.</p><p>After passing those earth, fire, wind, and water which seemed to be self-shredding, Meng Qi realized that the scene ahead was even more strange. The deeper side of the dimness seemed like a kaleidoscope, covered with different colors of tatters. The primary parts of the tatters were real, while the rest were illusory. Some were deathly still, like a star had reached its end or it was icebound. Some had nothing but endless chaos with condensation seeping through because the chaos had reached the highest level. There was tranquility and an eternal silence. Some had a big explosion, in which the fragments wreaked havoc everywhere…</p><p>These fragments seemed to be the different possibilities of the termination of heaven and earth. Although they were lying close to each other, some were even connected while they covered the precinct, they only blended slightly as if there was an illusory barrier.</p><p>When passing by this place for the second time, Meng Qi saw a piece of dot-like chaos. A real chaos, devouring with another piece of empty nonentity. The border of the nonentity shimmered in the four colors of red, green, black, and white while emitting a feeling of the end of an era.</p><p>Meng Qi was just about to approach it when he felt his rapid aging. Even the Supreme Endless Premier auspicious cloud was not able to stop it. The illusory River of Time appeared automatically and surrounded him, delaying the lapses of his life span.</p><p>He was shocked and stepped backward to return to his previous location to get rid of the aging. He lost a hundred years of his life span within just two seconds!</p><p>The Illusory River was flowing while the ancient glaze lamp appeared. With their guidance, Meng Qi found the presence of the broken chaos in the time and space other than chaos and nonentity. Some were hundreds of years in a flash, some were thousands of years in a moment. Some of the images reflected from chaos and nonentity were only a few thousand years ago, while some were few flashes ago. As their changes were measured in thousands of years, not much difference could be observed with a glance.</p><p>Even space and time were completely smashed into pieces… Meng Qi retroflexed his tongue and thought of those intrinsic auras located at extreme elevations which was also involved and pulled down directly. He came to a final speculation.</p><p>This seems to be the battlefield of the Nirvana Realm Individuals!</p><p>With his speculation, he transferred everything he saw and sensed to Gu Xiaosang.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang muttered to herself for a moment and sighed with rare melancholy,</p><p>“The past and future are broken, this is indeed the battle of Nirvana Realm Individuals…”</p><p>The past and future are broken? Meng Qi’s mind was cleared by this one sentence. The earth, fire, wind, and water he had seen before were actually from the time of pioneering heaven and earth and they belonged to the past. While the kaleidoscope-like tatters were the possibilities in the future, they were originally irrelevant and distinct, but due to the break in the River of Time of this world which he was in, they coexisted strangely at the present while the broken time and space that could make one lose a century of longevity were the wreckages of the River of Time.</p><p>Luckily, he was able to sense the flow of the River of Time in the real world, control fates slightly, and borrow some power to prevent the ending of being engulfed and decayed by this heaven and earth.</p><p>The nonentity that was like the end of an era accommodated every chaos with the four colors of red, green, black, and white. All these gave Meng Qi a familiar feeling. All of a sudden, he connected everything together and muttered,</p><p>“It was the outcome of the battle between Heavenly Lord Yuanshi and Lord Ling Bao!”</p><p>It symbolized Heavenly Lord Yuanshi’s nothingness and beginning and Lord Ling Bao’s possession and ending!</p><p>Gu Xiaosang spoke in an ethereal voice, “It’s unbelievable that they had a battle in Qingwei Heaven after the fall of the Heavenly Court…”</p><p>The thirty three Levels of Heaven here did not include the Great Red Heaven of Lord Dao De, the Qingwei Heaven of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi and the Yu Yu Heaven of Lord Ling Bao, which meant that these places were not the transformation of the Sea Calming Pearl. These places were known as the Residences of Da Luos outside the Trayastrimsa Heaven.</p><p>Qingwei Heaven was destroyed to this extent, leaving only some fragments outside… no wonder Yang Jian called this place the Qingwei Realm… Meng Qi was first shocked regarding this point but he managed to discover the problem by putting Gu Xiaosang’s guesses together.</p><p>Yang Jian only started the search since Heavenly Lord Yuanshi’s tracks became a riddle. Eventually, he found the fallen Qingwei Heaven.</p><p>Which meant that, after the disappearance of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi, he had a great war with Lord Ling Bao, who was the first person to disappear.</p><p>Putting the points that Aquamarine was located in Kunlun Mountain and the Premier Golden Stamp and Nine Seal were obtained by senior Chonghe, Meng Qi guessed that the disappearance of Heavenly Lord Yuanshi and Lord Ling Bao were related!</p><p>This was the clue shown in the battlefield in the Qingwei Realm!</p><p>There was no way to pacify the war even with Yang Jian’s strength at that time and putting a seal on them was the only way. As such, if there were other clues which could be taken away, Yang Jian must have taken them.</p><p>Why did the two ancient God Masters fight? Where did they go after the fight? Many questions appeared in Meng Qi’s mind, but he was clear that those subsequent clues might be located at the highest level of the Nine Levels of Heaven.</p><p>All of a sudden, he felt something in his heart. He could sense that the previous shadow was peeping toward his side once again from a distance away!</p><p>The shadow disappeared again when his sense reached there.</p><p>The shadow does exist! There really is a stalker! Meng Qi thought twice and decided to play it safe. He descended to the exit carefully as it was better to leave the battlefield first.</p><p>Upon reaching the valley, his vision was blurred suddenly and he saw an illusory, hazy, and glaze-like shadow at a scene with exotic plants. The shadow had sideburns, a yellow-toned face and some whiskers. He looked carefree without any strong aura, as if he was just an illusionary image.</p><p>It is the shadow from before! Meng Qi used primordial auspicious clouds to cover himself and asked in a deep voice,</p><p>“You are…?”</p><p>The priest gave a faint smile,</p><p>“My name is Zhun Ti.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
