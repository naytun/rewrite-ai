Meng Qi was quite surprised and asked again, “Han Guang’s interest is in the position of the Celestial Ruler, planning to re-establish the Heavenly Court and unify the three realms. How would he help you in building the Heaven Conferring Platform and rule the world with humanity?”</p><p>The formation had just dispersed, and he had not had time to deduce the mysteries of heaven to figure out what happened outside the sword formation.</p><p>When he saw the Drawing of Celestial Slaying Sword Formation, many thoughts flashed through his mind, including speculations of Gao Lan forming an alliance with the Jie Sect’s remaining members in order to lure the enemies out and then destroy them altogether. But he never thought that it would be the Devil Master Han Guang.</p><p>The one behind Han Guang is Heavenly Lord Lingbao?</p><p>Then his ambiguous attitude could be explained. Moreover, when Meng Qi himself turned Creator Brahma into the Additional Self Projection in the universe under Jade Mirage Palace, Han Guang had not only absorbed the sleeping body, but also got the Destroyer Shiva, which could be the Lingbao Projection.</p><p>Gao Lan’s eyes were deep when he said, “During the Jade Pool incident, Han Guang took the opportunity to break into the Xuantian Sect and was blocked by me after expending his energy. He asked me some things and agreed to a covenant under defeat, and the person behind him seemed to also want to see building of the Heaven Conferring Platform.”</p><p>“But from today onwards, the covenant has stopped, and it is necessary to raise our defenses against him, lest he make use of the opportunity to build the Heavenly Court.”</p><p>Such a thing actually happened back then… Meng Qi nodded slightly as he thought to himself, and then said, “So you let go of Yuan Hong on purpose?”</p><p>If there was interference from the emperor’s remains, Meng Qi was confident of keeping Yuan Hong given serious injuries!</p><p>Gao Lan nodded, “The condition that Lu Ya promised to intercept the Dipankara Buddha was that Yuan Hong will be left for him to deal with.”</p><p>What does Lu Ya want? Thoughts ran in Meng Qi’s mind, but he just couldn’t speculate the purpose of this cunning old fox. He planned to wait for things to die down and get more clues before discussing with Xiaosang.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, he looked at Gao Lan and asked smilingly, “Then who was the one who gave the Divine Emperor’s Demon Order to you?”</p><p>He was very curious about this matter.</p><p>Gao Lan walked forward like a dragon and coldly said, “That’s the fourth question.”</p><p>Meng Qi stood on the Heavenly Conferring Platform as the wind blew over. They are brothers, why does he have to be so calculative!</p><p>…</p><p>The fierce battle had subsided, but the Myriad World was raging and chaotic.</p><p>Under the interference of the formation, it was impossible to record a fighting scene at the Legendary level, but many people had seen the movement in the sky at that time. Even if their naked eye couldn’t capture every move, the earth-shattering scene still left a deep impression in their hearts. After the sword formation was withdrawn, the Myriad World’s regulatory state was restored, and the doomsday scene in the northern part of Ganzhou was uploaded by the powerful characters from the nearby state cities and watched by viewers. Fluster and uneasiness started to spread.</p><p>Inside the Jianghu Tea House forum, posts and replies sprang:</p><p>“The northern part of Ganzhou has been completely wiped out. Tens of thousands of people and hundreds of millions of living beings are gone. The mountains are gone. The rivers are gone. Even the plains and canyons are gone, left with only the bottomless sea and endless silence…”</p><p>“This is the horror when Legendary and Creation powerful characters strike. In front of them, we are just like bubbles and can be burst anytime by the dissipating air.”</p><p>“The real world is too frightening. Now that the Legendary powerful characters are gradually coming into the world, a few more fierce battles and Great Zhou may just be torn apart. We will die without any remains!”</p><p>“What should we do?”</p><p>“My friend is from Qinlian in the northern part of Ganzhou, and we have arranged to meet our parents after the new year…”</p><p>“I am from Luoning in the northern part of Ganzhou. I had a happy family, but now, only I who was escorted to Changle am still alive. There were seventeen people in my family, seventeen…”</p><p>Sadness, despair, and fearful emotions permeated. Wu Yanping calmly read calmly and did not reply. The fragility of life – a beautiful fragility – was completely displayed before him. He who had never experienced any hardship or death of a kin experienced the meaning of darkness.</p><p>The world that he had thought would only get better was actually so fragile. A battle, a power fight, could erase the brilliance brought by the Myriad World and ruin so many wonderful moments.</p><p>And his life which he had always felt was ordinary was so beautiful and brilliant compared to the citizens of northern Ganzhou.</p><p>One would only come to realization after losing or comparing.</p><p>In the pessimistic atmosphere, some people felt that this time was an accident. With preparations in the future, the human race would be able to resist such catastrophes:</p><p>“My uncle holds a high post in the yamen. He secretly told me that the Primitive Emperor had the four celestial swords of Heavenly Lord Lingbao, and the current emperor has the Drawing of the Celestial Slaying Sword Formation. These five items together can form the Number One Archean Killing Formation, which can protect Great Zhou. Like this time, the disaster in northern Ganzhou actually wouldn’t have happened. However, the founder of diabolism took the opportunity to create chaos when the Primitive Emperor and the current emperor were focused on dealing with the demons of the Luo Sect and the Devil Buddha today, hence resulting in the tragedy. But with this experience, there will be no similar incidents in the future.”</p><p>“I am from a reputable family with a long history, and an elder in my family holds an important position in the political office. According to him, the current emperor has even gotten the remains of the emperor! The emperor is a real influential character, an outstanding figure of the Nirvana realm, and his remains are extremely powerful. It will definitely make Great Zhou peaceful, and the rogues will not dare to try anything funny!”</p><p>“Let me tell you, this time round because of the attack of the founder of diabolism and the Great Sage of Meishan, the Primitive Emperor, the current emperor and the various powerful characters and deities fought really hard. They did not leave us in the lurch but protect us with their lives!”</p><p>There were many such remarks, but they weren’t able to calm the hearts of the people which were like boats in rolling waves, drowned in a blink of an eye. Some people even started thinking about backup plans:</p><p>“Aren’t there various realms and worlds? Aren’t there friends from other universes? Can we move over and leave the real world? The real world is the core of struggle of the power characters. As long as we leave this place, we won’t be implicated.”</p><p>“Is it too late to worship Buddha and the Primitive Emperor now? Can we enter the pure land or the heavenly realm where the Jade Mirage Palace is directly with our flesh body?”</p><p>With the world in chaos, it was a good time to win the hearts of people. Fortunately, the yamen and the imperial court Great Zhou cooperated with each other to eliminate many calamities, just that the pessimistic and fearful atmosphere was still shrouded in the Myriad World and the various counties and prefectures. Only some people of the pugilistic world were okay, since they led a life of fighting anyway and . might just die at anytime!</p><p>Time passed by quickly, and it had already been a month.</p><p>On this day, Wu Yanping and the people of Great Zhou who didn’t have the energy to do anything but indulge in the Myriad World to escape from reality saw live broadcasts being shown on all the forums, and all the live broadcasts became the same scene.</p><p>It was a hundred foot tall Heaven Conferring Platform that was divided into nine levels, surrounded by red, green, yellow, white, and black altars that symbolizes the five elements and five emperors. The four sides were engraved with various stars and deities. The bottom had heavenly soldiers as well as earth and mountain deities, and going upward there were celestial officials and the golden boy and girl, increasing accordingly until the second level where there were the five elements and five emperors, and the first level the manifestation of Taoism.</p><p>There was a formation on the platform, flowing with the brilliance of the lights of the various worlds and spreading the power of humanity. Gao Lan was wearing a black robe and an emperor’s crown, holding the Emperor’s Sword in his hands as he walked up the platform step by step.</p><p>“The Heaven Conferring Platform is about to be completed?” this thought flashed across the minds of the hundreds of millions of people watching the live broadcast. They controlled their emotions and watched attentively.</p><p>After completing the three thousand six hundred and fifty steps, Gao Lan finally reached the top of the Heaven Conferring Platform. There were the sect master of Jade Mirage Palace Meng Qi, Primeval Deity Bi Jingxuan, etc., who represented different forces watching the ceremony.</p><p>Of course, Meng Qi did not have the self-awareness of being the emperor’s brother.</p><p>Going forward nine steps, Gao Lan did not immediately confer the heaven but took a bow, leaving the emperor’s corpse at the core of the Heaven Conferring Platform.</p><p>The emperor’s remains’ face was pale gold, and his eyes had double pupils, filling the place with an air of majesty. The entire real world was shook again as a result, as though it could not bear his weight.</p><p>Gao Lan looked around and did a series of rituals. The sacred and solemn feeling gradually became stronger.</p><p>Then, facing the remains of the emperor, he took out an oration and recited, “Born during ancient times, the ruler took over the throne and brought glory to the human race, accumulating merits and virtues of benefiting the common people…”</p><p>After reciting the oration, Gao Lan looked around again and solemnly declared, “When the emperor passed on, his heart was thinking of the people, and he had a wish. He wanted to use his body as land, his bones as mountains and his blood as rivers to integrate into this world, to protect the human race of this world, the sentient beings, and the glory of civilization and humanity!”</p><p>His voice was impactful and rang in the ears of every listener. Then, the light of the enchanted boundary moved, and eyes of the emperor’s remains showed gratification and satisfaction.</p><p>The body slowly turned illusory and sank into the Heaven Conferring Platform, decomposing and spreading in all directions. Meng Qi suddenly felt the earth become extremely firm and the mountains indestructible. The city of humans seemed to have an inexplicable protection.</p><p>The sky became bluer and everything wasn’t the same anymore. The laws were changed again!</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly looked at Gao Lan in shock. He didn’t expect him to be willing to part with the remains of a great Nirvana character, not to mention the emperor’s last wish was to integrate into the world to guard the human race, the sentient beings whose wish was to live in peace, and the glory of civilization and humanity!</p><p>Within the territory of the Great Zhou Dynasty, bits of brilliance emerged, looking like fireflies that filled heaven and earth.</p><p>A single spark can start a fire!</p><p>The people of Great Zhou were moved and their hearts were tearing. Their previous despair and fear were completely gone.</p><p>After today onwards, they didn’t have to about the aftermath anymore!</p><p>The sky was blue, and Gao Lan solemnly took nine bows to show appreciation to the emperor’s virtue. Meng Qi also followed with a bow.</p><p>Soon after, Gao Lan walked to where the emperor’s remains were originally, raised his long sword, pointed it at the sky, and began the official ceremony of conferring heaven.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
