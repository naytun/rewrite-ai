If the seal could be mended, with the Qing Emperor’s power and the current conditions where the power of long time erosion and the power to penetrate stone with water is lost, the enchantment might be able to sustain itself until the Creation Realm Evil Demons and Gods wake up. By then, mighty people from the Great Medium and even mighty figures from the Nirvana Realm would have returned and balanced the forces. Perhaps a new self-claimed legend would emerge in the Real World by then.</p><p>As the most hopeful person now who can control and achieve Legendary status, Meng Qi was not trying to be humble. He would put himself on top of the list, followed by the others. However, when it comes to achieving it, there was only one answer to the fastest way within the shortest period of time, which is Su Wuming, the Heavenly Sword. He had been self-reflecting even before he achieved Dharmakaya, reaching an amount that almost caused a fundamental change with the legendary characteristic of being everywhere. Many years passed by, and after years of accumulation, it could almost be said to have established a legendary foundation. Compared to himself who still needs to leave different seara in a different universe and convert them into the Imprint of Additional Self, the path of No Others that Mister Luda was exploring while moving forward and the communication and absorption that Gao Lan and Han Guang only started doing after achieving the level of Transcendent, Su Wuming had incomparable convenience and speed.</p><p>If Su Wuming could see through his Tathata and understand I am who I am in perhaps five, ten, or twenty years, he could easily gather his reflected-self and convert qualitative change into fundamental change to become the first self-proving legend since the Middle Ages.</p><p>Everything flashed through his mind one by one before a divine light streaked Meng Qi’s mind suddenly. Words escaped his mouth,</p><p>“The Sea Calming Pearl!”</p><p>It was a Peerless Magic Weapon that could evolve heavens right away if it was not used to attack the enemies. Although its essence was lower than the Nine Levels of Heaven, the Endless Sea was merely a Nine Levels Derivation which was enough to defend the erosion. How could one of the Thirty-Three Levels of Heaven not be able to accommodate the forces of all mankind?</p><p>Most importantly, after the fall of the Heavenly Court, twenty four Sea Calming Pearls were scattered around the world and they became unowned. Even if some of them were acquired by others and evolved into the Lifeless Heaven, some remained unfound. They could still be found by trying to use something like the Moonlight Mirror to retrospect history and reconstruct the past in order to determine their locations.</p><p>“The Sea Calming Pearl?” It was obvious that Gao Lan heard of the Twenty Four Heavens before. He put his hand at his back and walked near him, “Objects of the Creation Realm could be found easily but hard to be acquired. Do you have any clues?”</p><p>Meng Qi shook his head, “No, I don’t. But we have to try.”</p><p>“I will try to search for other treasures. We should not only target the Sea Calming Pearl,” Gao Lan said with the solemnity and dignity of an emperor.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled, “News accumulated by the Plain Girl Sect since the primeval times would all belong to you after the return of my sister-in-law, Yan Ran. We will not need to fear about not being able to find similar treasures.”</p><p>Knowledge was part of the heritage but unlike the other heritage that could be easily destroyed, knowledge stayed with the inheritance. After the Chaos of the Devil Buddha, the Plain Girl Sect had accumulated various anecdotes, treasures, and myths since the primeval times.</p><p>“Good!” Gao Lan made a step and reached the doors of the Main Hall. He stood straight and said with a low tone, “Why wait until later when we can do it now? Brother, let’s head to Plain Girl Fairyland today!”</p><p>Meng Qi was stunned. He then smiled and answered, “Alright!”</p><p>It seemed like his big brother had been prepared for this. He only waited until today because he had been going here and there for isolated practice or travel. It was difficult for him to find and get in touch with an assured helper.</p><p>Magic clouds appeared below their feet. Two rays of light rose and escaped into the void without causing any fluctuation in the Palace of Great Zhou.</p><p>…</p><p>Above Donghai, there was a hidden cave at the core of an island with wild beasts and fierce birds. It was covered in mist and a spring hanging on it diagonally. It looked like a hidden paradise.</p><p>A decent-looking man with a mustache was wearing a plain green Taoist robe as he stood at the entrance. He wasn’t moving but his gaze was flickering, showing a sense of anxiety and discomfort.</p><p>Suddenly, his vision went blurry and two men with different auras appeared. One of them was wearing an emperor’s robe and a Heavenly Crown. He was tall, stalwart, cool and dignified while the other was wearing a Water Gown and Bamboo Cloud Crown, looking fresh, mighty, yet reserved. All they did was stand there and they looked like the dictator of Heaven and Earth. The restrictive spells and wild beasts on the island had no reaction towards them at all.</p><p>The decent-looking guy lowered his head and said respectfully, “Your Majesty, the Primitive Emperor.”</p><p>Although the Primitive Emperor was the Great Zhou Emperor’s younger brother, his reputation had long surpassed this scope. Between the owner of Myriad World Heaven and Earth, the sage who brought the drastic change, the strong competitor to top the Heavenly List with knowledge passed down directly from the Premier and taught by the Jade Palace, none of them was weaker than the emperor’s younger brother.</p><p>“Thank you for your effort, please leave as soon as possible,” Gao Lan nodded slightly and said with a soft tone but his words were heartwarming.</p><p>The decent-looking man stopped talking. He turned around and led Gao Lan and Meng Qi into the cave, passing through the mists. The special token he had in his hand was glowing and its light connected to the entrance of Plain Girl Fairyland. Meng Qi and Gao Lan drew in their manner to appear like an ordinary Exterior Realm.</p><p>“Who are the people behind you?” words of enquiry were heard from Plain Girl Fairyland.</p><p>The decent-looking man maintained his expression and said, “The Miraculous Elixir and Medicine required by Bodhisattva.”</p><p>Before he finished talking, vigorous sounds of heartbeats were heard, subtle yet powerful. He couldn’t help but to follow them. The heart of the person who questioned started beating with the same rhythm, too, as they followed the connection along the voicemail. His mind became blurry and he opened the passage subconsciously.</p><p>The lights and shadows in front of them changed. White clouds formed the sky, rays were shining down from the sky and mist formed the earth. It looked magical. The guard at the entrance looked lifeless and he ignored both Meng Qi and Gao Lan as if they were not there.</p><p>“Your Majesty, the Mysterious Fairy entered the Plain Girl Palace and used the restrictive spell to isolate herself from the outside world, forbidding anyone from getting close to her. I suspected that she was doing the final polishing,” the decent-looking man transmitted his voice to Gao Lan.</p><p>Gao Lan nodded slightly and stepped forward solemnly towards the Plain Girl Palace. Meng Qi followed closely from behind as his Taoist robe fluttered.</p><p>The objective of this trip was to act fast and abduct the current Miss Mystery before the others in the Plain Girl Sect could react!</p><p>After all, the Plain Girl Sect was inherited from the primeval times. Being able to survive the Chaos of the Devil Buddha meant a lot even though they were damaged. The mighty people in Plain Girl Fairyland might not be able to withstand it if they activated their remaining heritage completely like the Nine Heaven Mysterious Fairy slough, let alone himself and his dummy big brother?</p><p>One must never wade in the mud and water or hope for the other when one is in a critical situation. Going straight into the Plain Girl Palace was the best choice!</p><p>There were many palaces with gardens and herb farms in between. Meng Qi and Gao Lan only disguised themselves slightly to conceal themselves from the natural scan from the Formations so that they can get close to the Plain Girl Palace without triggering the restrictive spells.</p><p>There were a number of masters and pupils along the way. They were alerted by these strange faces but sounds of heartbeats and soft, mysterious hums were heard from the void as soon as they were alarmed.</p><p>“Heavenly Lord Yuanshi!”</p><p>Heavenly, Lord, Yuanshi… their brains buzzed before they fell into a feeling of amazement with hums echoing inside them.</p><p>They also felt the dominating, mighty, and powerful aura of King Dao and they were intimidated. They sent Meng Qi and Gao Lan across the palaces and arrived at the Plain Girl Palace.</p><p>An aged and worn out palace appeared in front of their eyes immediately. The traces of burn marks from strike of lightning and fire became dark as time passed. Three ancient seals were hanging there, blocking the door.</p><p>Witnessing this, a few thoughts flashed through Meng Qi’s mind. What are the differences between Tao coagulated by Nirmanakaya Practice and Dharmakaya after he passed away while sitting cross-legged? Is there a strong slough? For example, did the Fifth Generation Miss Mystery have a slough? If she had it, where is it?</p><p>As thoughts were running in his head, Gao Lan and him passed through layers of restrictive spells around the Plain Girl Palace and arrived at the doorstep.</p><p>The door was closed tightly. It looked ancient and serene.</p><p>Gao Lan’s gaze condensed as he drew the Emperor’s Sword while Meng Qi smirked and raised his Invincible Blade. His arms looked blurry like the Pangu Flag.</p><p>The sword glowed with a golden light and illuminated the darkness. The blade had a purplish aura and lightning around it, capped by the Trial of Thunder.</p><p>The blade and sword fell together while they shone brightly. One was able to allow man to conquer nature, while the other could split heaven and earth apart. In the midst of chaos, all the restrictive spells of the Plain Girl Palace shattered and the door disappeared straight away.</p><p>However, only the four pillars that were supporting the ceiling of the wide palace could be seen. The palace was empty and the Mysterious Fairy was not in there!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
