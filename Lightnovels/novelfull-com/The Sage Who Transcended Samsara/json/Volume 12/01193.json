His consciousness seemed to spread continuously, exploring into countless universes like an attacking octopus absorbing all negative emotions and all killing nutrients.</p><p>“If only the universe was a boundless sea…” the Demonic Monarch sighed, turning a blind eye to the either vague, hideous or strange figures in the surrounding darkness. If these spirits and demons misbehaved, they would only become his blood.</p><p>Just the endless sea formed from the demonic air leaked out of the Netherworld was already able to make him feel that his injuries were recovering and his power was nearing the peak. If he really stepped into the real Netherworld, he would probably not just reach the peak but make a huge progress to reach perfection, or even come into contact with the characteristics of the Nirvana realm.</p><p>His body sank rapidly, and there was no unusual movements in the spirits and demons around him, as they seemed to have an instinctive fear for him.</p><p>In just a few moments, the Demonic Monarch saw the layer of pale golden glaze boundary that seemed to be the bottom of the sea. Overlapping it was a layer of heavenly realm derived from the Sea Calming Pearl. Five colors of light were slightly moving, lights were quietly shining, and the power of all living beings were slowly flowing, repairing the continuous damage.</p><p>Just as the Demonic Monarch’s eyes turned into a whirlpool with self-generating darkness and was about to display the aura of the Demonic Sword, an eye suddenly appeared in his line of sight. It was an evil-looking eye with six colors, and was looking at him indifferently through the enchanted boundary and void.</p><p>“Mahesvara…” the Demonic Monarch muttered. His heart contracted and swelled, stirring the spirit and formed resonance with the other party, thereby infiltrating the enchanted boundary.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, it was no longer just a six-colored evil eye in his sight, but a real black demonic dragon formed from a galaxy. Every part of its body was a vast black sun and a dark star, occupying the core area of the boundless universe. Light extended into the void and into the various realms. It was the leader of heavenly demons who ruled the Nine Nethers during ancient times – Mahesvara!</p><p>The demonic dragon also vibrated its heart and its voice bypassed the enchanted boundary, “You want to destroy the Qing Emperor’s seal?”</p><p>Being the Demonic Monarch, he knew what it meant and said calmly, “Are you thinking of stopping me?”</p><p>It seemed that Mahesvara had long been working together secretly with Qi Zhengyan, and him being in the Nine Nether meant that his abilities were comparable to the Creation realm, hence similar to himself and was fully capable of stopping the destruction of the seal.</p><p>Mahesvara smiled and said, “Things are sometimes against my wishes.”</p><p>He paused and continued, “You are the ancestor of diabolism, and can be called a Heavenly Lord if your state is perfected. Why do you care about someone like Qi Zhengyan who is still far away from Legendary realm? Even if he had the inheritance of the Demonic Lord and could have a bright future, there was only a certain level of possibility. Why do you have to fight so hard with me now?”</p><p>“The Devil’s Claws are a restriction and not a help to Qi Zhengyan. Even if he achieves the Legendary realm and enters the Creation realm, you’ll still have the opportunity to get rid of him? If you want to take back the Devil’s Claws, he would be more than happy!”</p><p>Befogging the minds of people had always been a hobby and expertise of Mahesvara.</p><p>The Demonic Monarch said with awareness, “Su Meng has entered the Legendary realm and has the support of Jade Mirage and the emperor. At anytime he could get Guangchengzi to smash down the Flip Heaven Seal, borrow the four celestial swords and formation drawing, and can summon the remains of the emperor. With his obstruction, unless I return to the peak state now, I’m afraid it will be difficult for me to succeed. When Guangchengzi completely returns, it will be even more troublesome.”</p><p>“Ha, that may not be the case,” Mahesvara laughed. “You should be very clear about what Qi Zhengyan did in the Southern Wasteland. He has irreconcilable contradictions with the current emperor, but he is now still weak and the problem isn’t obvious. By the time he grows up, the friction will increase. At that time, Su Meng would be in an awkward predicament, and he cannot borrow the formation drawing and the remains of the emperor, what fear will you have? Who knows the emperor might even help you get rid of Qi Zhengyan.”</p><p>These words touched his heart.</p><p>Having said that, he continued with an ambiguous smile, “Why do you have to get rid of Qi Zhengyan? Even if he has the inheritance of the Demonic Lord, it does not hinder your perfection. If you want to be the ruler of heterodoxy and the Netherworld, those few from the Nine Nether cannot be underestimated. And there are also the Seven-Kill Priest that is about to get rid of the control of the Devil Buddha, and the returned Nether.”</p><p>The Demonic Monarch’s thoughts were slightly shaken, and he asked, “The returned Nether?”</p><p>After the Nether was captured by Emperor Zhenwu, it reincarnated mysteriously and did not reappear throughout the ages. Even the corpses that were prepared for himself to create heavenly weapons landed in the hands of others. It seemed that it had completely abandoned the past, but also seemed that something went wrong during the reincarnation.</p><p>The Demonic Monarch was very concerned about this. The task of finding the Nether’s whereabouts was jointly promulgated by him and the Devil Buddha, just that the Devil Buddha’s concern was on Zhenwu.</p><p>Mahesvara said, “There were ghosts who saw his reincarnation near the Nether. He seemed to be going to the start of life and death.”</p><p>“The start of life and death…” the Demonic Monarch pondered for a while and nodded. The Nether really had other arrangements, and it seemed to be related to Emperor Zhenwu.</p><p>With Mahesvara blocking the way, the Demonic Monarch knew that there was only a slim chance that he could destroy the seal today. Moreover, the other party did analyze well. The contradiction between Qi Zhengyan and Gao Lan was irreconcilable, and he would have plenty of opportunities by then.</p><p>After deducing the mysteries of heaven and knowing that the battle in the outside world had ceased, he spoke no more and turned to disappear into the darkness of the vast sea.</p><p>Mahesvara looked quietly at his back view and muttered, “Why must he get rid of Qi Zhengyan?”</p><p>…</p><p>The air stagnation disappeared and the four colors went away. The clouds covering the sky and the roaring wild wind gradually faded away. The four celestial swords pulled out by themselves and dashed into the sky, penetrating into the void and disappeared.</p><p>At this moment, the sun rose from the east and the sky was red, magnificent, and full of vigor.</p><p>The fearful people of Great Zhou finally breathed a sigh of relief, having understood that the calamity was over. Some spoke of the emperor silently, some were grateful to the Primitive Emperor, and some believers of Buddhism and Taoism offered incense.</p><p>Inside the Buddhist temples, practitioners were chanting, “Namo Amitabha…”</p><p>“Namo Manjushri Bodhisattva-Mahasattva…”</p><p>“Namo Fahualin Bodhisattva-Mahasattva…”</p><p>Amidst the chanting, the illusions gathered and the outline of a figure gradually formed, as though from the purest white light.</p><p>…</p><p>On the Heaven Conferring Platform, the picture of mountains and rivers floated, the projections of the four celestial swords dissipated, and the formation drawing flew into the air. Meng Qi stood up slowly and saw Gao Lan descending from the sky and landing on the edge. His emperor robe and crown were majestic and his expression was cold and indifferent but with a slight arrogance. He seemed quite satisfied with the previous plan.</p><p>After this battle, although he couldn’t completely keep the powerful characteristics of the demonic race, the Buddhist Kingdom and the Luo Sect, it had seriously injured Maitreya and the Bull Demon King, etc., and they wouldn’t be able to influence the situation of the real world for a period of time. He could then easily complete the Heavenly Conferring Platform and seek the Legendary path without hurry.</p><p>The only worrying thing was that the Demonic Monarch and the Dipankara Buddha had awakened in advance, and might stir trouble.</p><p>Just when he was about to enter the Heaven Conferring Platform, a shadow moved in front of his eyes and there was a layer of enchanted boundary. Then, he saw Meng Qi saying with a solemn expression, “In case of the use of transformation magic, you have to answer three questions.”</p><p>Looking at Meng Qi, Gao Lan suddenly felt that his god brother was mentally retarded again.</p><p>With the remains of the emperor beside him and the Emperor’s Sword in his hand, how could he be fake?</p><p>“What question?” Gao Lan asked indifferently, and surprisingly did not choose to take back the control of the Heaven Conferring Platform straight away.</p><p>A mental patient cannot be measured using logical thinking!</p><p>Meng Qi thought about it and said, “The first question, who lent the Drawing of Celestial Slaying Sword Formation?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
