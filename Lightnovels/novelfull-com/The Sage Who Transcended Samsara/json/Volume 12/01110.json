A high and mighty sacred aura radiated from deep within, which turned into Chinese Globe Flowers, giving everyone present the impulse to bow down to the sacred power.</p><p>The name was highlighted and the lights radiating from it lit up the whole place. The four big words seemed to be floating in thin air. That was the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi who sat at the highest and centermost place!</p><p>The Heavenly Lord Yuanshi… everyone including the county magistrate and the host seemed to have turned into a clay puppet. The golden light was reflected on their faces, and their eyes were filled with bewilderment as if they were having a daydream.</p><p>Ever since the creator of Taiping Dao dreamed of the Celestial Ruler, and worshipped the Ether as the Yellow Sky, the concept of theurgy started to spread. After many generations of connecting with various deities, eventually, the Chart of Deities Achievement Ranking was created. At first, the Celestial Ruler was considered to be the highest ranked and sat at the very top of the list. The Four Emperors among the Five Emperors from Five Places were placed below him, followed by the Multi-treasure Heavenly King, the Great Zhenyuan Deity, and so forth. Later, they took into consideration the fact that this was the Taoist Sect Heavenly Court and the Deity Records, which meant that the Three Pristine Daode Tianzuns should not be left out. Only then were their names included, as a mere form of respect. Nobody had ever imagined that someone would be able to connect with one of them.</p><p>The fact was that in the millions of years since the Chart of Deities Achievement Ranking had been finalized, the Five Emperors from Five Places, the Multi-treasure Heavenly King, the Great Zhenyuan Deity, and the others had all connected with at least one familiar. The Celestial Ruler had never appeared, but he had at least appeared in the dreams of the Taiping Dao creator, who received a large amount of direct knowledge. The Three Pristine Daode Tianzuns were the only ones who had never shown any form of connection.</p><p>However today, within this small county, a young boy received an acknowledgement from the head of the Three Pristine Daode Tianzuns, the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi. How could one believe their own eyes?</p><p>Throughout millions of years, a long time had passed, and Taiping Dao had already separated into the National Guard Temple, the Teaching of Five Pecks of Rice, Yellow Turbanism, etc. Who would have thought that such a spectacular never-before-seen occurrence would happen!?</p><p>From an acknowledgement from the Three Pristine to Yuanshi’s decree, could it be a sign that an event of overwhelming importance was soon to occur?</p><p>The light was dazzling, and every corner of the words Heavenly Lord Yuanshi was luminously lit up. The light entered Gan Ruoxu’s head, causing his whole body to quiver. He felt like there were chaotic seeds planted in his head, they were neither cold nor hot, neither big nor small.</p><p>The name returned to the Chart of Deities Achievement Ranking, the Chinese Globe Flowers disappeared, and the lights faded away. Everything returned to its original form. Only then did people start to snap out of their daze. He started to recite in a low voice filled with respect and affection,</p><p>“The Celestial Venerable of the Primordial Beginning.”</p><p>For some reason, he subconsciously made minor changes of the honorifics of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi, which seemed to be more suited for the sacred energy that he sensed just now.</p><p>This showed the connection between heaven and earth, where changes came naturally. At least that was how he felt.</p><p>Along with his soft recitation, the teens and crowd who came to attend the ceremony started to lower their heads, and recited in a soft voice,</p><p>“The Celestial Venerable of the Primordial Beginning…”</p><p>With a loud rumble, the sky seemed to split open and rain started to fall. The rain fell on his body, but he did not feel soaked at all. Instead, he felt an indescribable sense of comfort, as if all his illnesses could be healed without medicine.</p><p>It is the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi! The Celestial Venerable of the Primordial Beginning! As a country whose most foundation was Taoism theurgy, it was no surprise that they would have a strong belief in Taoism, as they continued to recite continuously right until Gan Ruoxu opened his eyes and turned around. He looked at the people below the stage with mixed feelings of being confused and excited.</p><p>Xue Lian’s heart suddenly skipped a beat, and droplets of cold sweat started to form on his forehead. Gan Ruoxu became the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi’s family, so what would become of him?</p><p>If he knew from the start, then he would not have spoken such words!</p><p>As Gan Ruoxu looked at all pairs of eyes which were filled with awe, he felt as if he had tasted the sweetest and purest honey. There were no words to describe this feeling of comfort and ease. His parents were both abandoned and were harshly discriminated upon, while he was also frequently bullied by his classmates.</p><p>Today, he had gained the greatest return from all the sufferings and hardships he had faced throughout his life!</p><p>The time to hold one’s head high with pride would come naturally!</p><p>Although the county magistrate’s Protection Deity was only in the sixth class, due to many years of practice, they shared a strong bond. He was able to control his senses due to stable spiritual control and came to his senses rather quickly. Many thoughts crossed his mind,</p><p>After the Black Emperor, the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi appeared. This is something that has never occurred throughout history. Could this be signifying that chaos will soon approach?</p><p>This won’t do. We have to safely escort Gan Ruoxu into the capital as soon as possible to be protected. We cannot allow our enemies to assassinate him before he grows up!</p><p>It is a shame that the news can no longer be hidden… he sighed quietly. Under normal circumstances, most people would be able to sense abnormalities when trying alone, and those who suspected that they had a connection with deities of the third class and above would have to report to the imperial court immediately. They would then stand before the Chart of Deities Achievement Ranking in advance and undergo secret training. However, the third class consisted of high ranked deities like the Fairy of Ninth Heaven, the Master of Purple Star, Lady Mother of the Chariot, and the Heavenly Lord Guangcheng, all of which would usually not appear in a hundred or even a thousand years. Because of this, the rule had been long forgotten, just like the case of the Black Emperor and the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi.</p><p>The county magistrate took a step forward. His eyes met with the host for a short while, and he announced with a clear and loud voice,</p><p>“Today, my Blessed Nation has received sacred protection from the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi. This is a grand event which has never occurred in a million years. However, the world is currently not in peace, and we have to be cautious about our enemies in case of assassination. I ask of all who are present today to not reveal a word regarding this matter to the outer world,” he had a soothing voice filled with magnetism, and a purple glow radiated from his eyes. He seemed to have the mysterious power to gain the people’s trust, and influence the crowd.</p><p>In this day and age, the family of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi would be equal to a golden trump card. If chaos were to occur in this era where theurgy existed, there would be no need to guess whether the people would choose to follow the familiar of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi and the Great Emperor Zhenwu, or the third and fourth class deities. That name alone could be used as a flag to determine the fate of religion and the whole country. If this power could not be owned, then it would be better off destroyed even if that would anger the deities.</p><p>As for how the Blessed Nation would handle this matter, whether they would nurture him with care due to their fear of the Lord, or would choose to sacrifice a person by killing the family as a scapegoat, the county magistrate did not care to think about it. After all, his job would be fulfilled once the familiar was sent to the capital.</p><p>Influenced by his direct knowledge and charming voice, the audience all thought that the county magistrate’s words made perfect sense, and had to be obeyed.</p><p>The county magistrate then turned to look at Gan Ruoxu. He gave him a simple bow, not caring the least bit of their difference in position, and said, “Sir Gan, your identity is of extreme importance, I would have to send you into the capital as soon as possible to receive protection. You will only be given fifteen minutes to say farewell, is that alright?”</p><p>“Sure!” Gan Ruoxu was still a teenager who was in high spirits. Entering the capital was exactly what he wished for.</p><p>The county magistrate looked at the surroundings and said with a smile, “To be less eye-catching and avoid suspicion from our enemies, I will send Wu Ju, the Marshal Tianpeng, and the others into the capital as well, with the excuse of receiving the seal in advance.”</p><p>One group focused on transporting the people in, while the other focused on relaying the message to let the capital being swiftly informed about the situation.</p><p>Connecting with the Black Emperor was no big deal if compared to the presence of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi!</p><p>…</p><p>In the house which had not been repaired for a long time, Gan Ruoxu’s face was flushed red, his eyes brightened up with excitement as he watched his parents walk out of the room. Without waiting for them to ask any questions, he said. “Dad, mom, I’ve been acknowledged by a deity!”</p><p>His parents were both stunned. Tears started to flow down their cheeks. The two middle-aged people were crying like young children, releasing all the hardships and sufferings they had endured throughout the years.</p><p>“Good, good, good!” they said with their voices overlapping. They only remembered to ask after some time, “Which deity is it?”</p><p>Gan Ruoxu smiled with his lips pressed together and said, “I’m keeping it a secret for now. You two will know after seven days. I’ve received the favor of the National Guard Temple, so I’ll have to enter the capital immediately to undergo training.”</p><p>“Great news, this is great news!” his parents did not further question him. They suspected that their son had connected with a high ranked deity, possibly a fourth class Star-Lord or Immortal.</p><p>…</p><p>The two chariots traveled with high speed. Gan Ruoxu and Wu Ju coincidentally sat opposite to each other.</p><p>Wu Ju shrunk back slightly due to fear and was secretly monitoring Gan Ruoxu. When Gan Ruoxu turned to look at him, he forced a smile and said, “You’ve never told us about your abnormalities. Now I know it was because you didn’t want to scare us.”</p><p>“I didn’t experience any abnormalities. However, the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi does symbolize nothingness, so I suppose it is more accurate to have felt nothing,” Gan Ruoxu had already calmed down and was able to find an explanation.</p><p>As Wu Ju felt that Gan Ruoxu’s attitude seemed rather pleasant, he mustered up his courage and asked, “What direct knowledge did you receive? Mine is the True Power of the Heavenly River.”</p><p>What type of direct knowledge will the head of Three Daode Tianzuns, the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi grant him?</p><p>Gan Ruoxu went blank. He seemed to have not received any direct knowledge.</p><p>Could it be that chaotic seed which was planted in his head?</p><p>“It’s a bit complicated. I haven’t figured out exactly what type of direct knowledge it is. I’ll need some time to fully comprehend what it is,” Gan Ruoxu answered with honesty.</p><p>Wu Ju had the intention of sucking up to him, and the two were happily chatting away. When the night drew in, the group entered the National Guard Yard in the capital.</p><p>As they stepped into the front gate, Gan Ruoxu saw an old Taoist with a head of white hair advancing toward him at full speed. The old man stopped in front of him, and said emotionally, “Could you be Gan?”</p><p>“That’s me,” Gan Ruoxu bowed with a slight smile.</p><p>“Quick, follow me,” the old Taoist did not care about the others. He led Gan Ruoxu through the National Guard Palace located in front and entered the Three Pristine Temple located at the back. He introduced himself as he walked, “I’m the Master of the Huzhou National Guard Temple. I’ve just received the news that you’ve received the acknowledgement of Three Pristine Daode Tianzuns, and have gained the protection of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi. I’ve deliberately come to explain how you’ll be undergoing training in the future.”</p><p>If nothing unpredictable were to happen, to prevent the family of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi from eyeing the emperor’s seat or being enticed by the enemy, he would most probably be appointed to be the next master of the National Guard Temple. How could he not make sure they have a good relationship?</p><p>“Thank you, Master,” Gan Ruoxu had just been worrying about not knowing his direct knowledge.</p><p>Within the Three Pristine Hall, the majestic statue of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi was located at the center, with Lingbao on his left, and Daode on his right. The entire hall was unexpectedly quiet and felt incredibly sacred.</p><p>“After receiving the protection from a deity, you’ll have to face the deity’s statue and visualize it every day, to strengthen your impression and gradually transform the seed of the direct knowledge into the image of your deity… this energy could come from the deity himself or the power of heaven and earth. As long as the relationship is strengthened, you will be able to gradually feel the deity’s energy or a portion of the power, which increases its feedback…” The old Taoist pointed at the cushion in front of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi’s statue and said, “You can sit here to visualize the Heavenly Lord.”</p><p>Gan Ruoxu nodded and sat down crossed-legged. He visualized according to the old Taoist’s method. He allowed his inner peace to take over and entered an intricate state. His eyes looked directly at the mighty statue of Yuanshi.</p><p>In between confusion and uncertainty, he felt that the scene before him had changed and he seemed to have arrived at the peak of a scenic mountain. He walked down along the stone steps, passed through all sorts of exotic plants, and arrived at a Taoist temple known as the Jade Palace. As he entered the temple and stepped into the hall, lotuses started to bloom and he saw the statues of the Three Pristine once again. Only this time, there was a Taoist dressed in a green robe standing in between Lingbao and Daode. His facial features were beautiful, his sideburns were white, and his eyes had a bottomless depth as if it could contain the entire universe.</p><p>Is this the true spirit of the Heavenly Lord Yuanshi?</p><p>Gan Ruoxu’s whole body and mind were entirely drawn into those eyes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
