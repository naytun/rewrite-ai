However, as long as one reached the Exterior realm and could fly, it would be of no significance, not to mention those who were now entering Spirited Mountain were all top experts below the Legendary realm. They naturally disregarded it and leapt past it easily.</p><p>Meng Qi who was at the back quietly pushed the crown on his head and crossed the Cloud Canyon inconspicuously before entering Spirited Mountain.</p><p>After their silhouettes were covered by the dark void, abundant cracks and roaring wild wind, glazed light flashed beside the Cloud Canyon, outlining the silhouette of a monk in a dust-free monk’s robe. It was the manifestation Meng Qi created using the art of Creating Three Manifestations with One Breath – Tathagata Zhending.</p><p>The monk Zhending appeared quieter and cleaner than before. His shoes and socks were free of dust, and his eyes had glazed lamp hidden in them, making him look even more like a Buddha who had come to this world.</p><p>In the previous universe, Meng Qi had gotten from the Anti-Buddhism Sect three relics containing the real inheritance of the Buddha’s Palm, namely the third stroke The Smile of Flower-Picking, the sixth stroke The Pure Land in the Palm, and the seventh stroke Divine Intervention. They were all from the Devil Buddha’s legacy, making this Tathagata manifestation more complete and improvised.</p><p>As for the corresponding Reversed Buddha’s Palm’s Demons in Chaos, Heaven and Earth Falling in Tandem, and Race Annihilation, Meng Qi only took them as reference to know more about the enemy and had never practiced them.</p><p>With lotuses appearing with every step he took, Tathagata Zhending proceeded downward along with the Cloud Canyon.</p><p>The river was rolling and its end was unknown.</p><p>…</p><p>The void cracked and the wind was blowing. Black fog filled and polluted the surroundings. Screams came from both near and far, making Spirited Mountain like the nine levels of hell where a normal person couldn’t even move a step.</p><p>But whether it was Meng Qi, Qingqiu, Taili, or Glow, Raka, and No Thoughts, they were all deities, so they might not get hurt even if they hit the crack in the void. It was really like walking on flat ground for them and they were soon deep inside Spirited Mountain, passing the dilapidated Buddhas.</p><p>Suddenly, a glazed golden colored Buddha bead appeared in the sky and hit toward the demonic deities. It was like a shrunk star with black air around it. Its purity and sordidity were just balanced and would explode fiercely once hit by a foreign object, like the commonly seen divine heavenly weapon that destroyed everything nearby once it was pushed to the extreme.</p><p>Meng Qi who was at the back looked on indifferently, assessing the strength of the demonic deities.</p><p>Seeing the Buddha bead almost reaching, the Phoenix Demonic Deity Glow let out a deep sneer before spreading her illusory wings upward, forming an exquisite thirty-three-level pagoda that was golden all over and indestructible. Rays of yellow light fell from it, forming wreathing dragons.</p><p>Thump!</p><p>The Buddha bead hit the pagoda, causing a ripple. Without moving, the resulting explosion was enveloped and engulfed by the yellow dragons, and no damage was caused.</p><p>Virtues on the body, no evil could invade!</p><p>With the pagoda of virtues above her, Glow took a step forward came to the dilapidated Buddha at the side. There was a golden-bodied Bodhisattva with dead air and black fog around it, its compassionate face showing menace. In his hand was a string of the Buddha beads that had a spirit stronger than his body but only had a few remaining.</p><p>Glow opened her right hand, as though spreading her wings. As invisible flames filled the space between her five fingers, her palm fell, landing on the handprint resisted by the Bodhisattva.</p><p>Inextinguishable flames gushed, quickly burning the Bodhisattva into a transparent glaze.</p><p>Glaze collapsed as golden light erupted, forming a transparent Buddha relic.</p><p>Glow absorbed in the air with her hand, keeping the relic and the remaining Buddha beads before saying without turning her head, “Let’s go!”</p><p>During the entire process, she hadn’t stopped her footsteps but seemed to keep going forward and hitting a fly on the way.</p><p>“A phoenix is just a step away from the Legendary realm indeed,” not wanting to be too involved, Meng Qi nodded lightly as strange thoughts ran through his mind.</p><p>Right now, he should take out the Myriad World Talisman and finish a live broadcast program as an anchor. The name would be “Adventures with the Primitive Emperor” or “Into Spirited Mountain with the Demon Deities.” It should be very well-received.</p><p>The only problem was, Spirited Mountain was isolated from the outside and he couldn’t transmit information according to karma, so he could only just think…</p><p>Flying along the mountain road, many bodies of Arhats and Bodhisattvas along the way were destroyed by Glow and burned into Buddha relics.</p><p>Seeing that they were about to pass a mountain peak, a decaying goat surrounded by dead air suddenly jumped out from the foggy darkness at the side. It had a terrifying strength and was filled with evilness, looking like an evil deity from the netherworld.</p><p>It was a demonic deity that had attacked Spirited Mountain and invaded by hellish dead air, making it regain some wisdom and was extremely terrifying.</p><p>As the Kirin Demonic Deity Raka gave the goat an indifferent look, five-colored lights erupted around him and agglomerated into an ancient and unpretentious token, commanding the world by destiny. Although the decaying demonic deity was very near, it always couldn’t hit him, as though there was an unrecoverable distance between them.</p><p>Thereafter, two rays of pure light shot out from Raka’s eyes.</p><p>Once the light shone, evilness and sordidness dissipated. The goat’s limbs collapsed and it became a mash of blood.</p><p>“A celestial beast of destiny indeed. The Evil-Destroying Light is also extraordinary,” Meng Qi silently complimented, looking very much like an onlooker.</p><p>The contingent continued to advance forward. Seeing Glow and Raka enjoying the limelight, No Thoughts fastened his speed, not wanting to fall behind. He managed to get to the front and the bodies of Arhats, Bodhisattvas, demonic deities, and demonic kings were either smashed up by him or broken into two and thrown into the void gap, breaking all resistance and sweeping all obstacles.</p><p>A contingent like this naturally advanced very quickly, crossing the mountainside within a short time and got to an area beyond where Meng Qi and the others had previously encountered Maha Kasyapa and Manjushri.</p><p>At this moment, the door of the Buddhist temple in front that was only left half opened and out came a towering golden silhouette.</p><p>He had a kind look on his face and his earlobes were huge, falling on his shoulders. Its golden body invaded by ash and darkness, emitting five-colored glaze light, each with floating golden lotuses blooming and withering, pure lands being created and destroyed, like there were countless universe surrounding this silhouette.</p><p>It was the body of a Buddha!</p><p>Meng Qi squinted his eyes. Shouldn’t all the Buddhas on Spirited Mountain have formed the Thousand Buddha Formation and be at the peak without anyone being in control?</p><p>This golden-bodied Buddha had actually left the Thousand Buddha Formation and came to the mountainside!</p><p>Did the Devil Buddha show a hint of strength and is controlling it or is it some other powerful expert secretly in control?</p><p>Or had Spirited Mountain changed after Sha Wujing carried out that mysterious body, and the remains of the Buddha golden bodies that were trapped in the formation were increasingly invaded by the dead air of the netherworld and gradually showed signs of regaining wisdom?</p><p>No matter what the possibility was, the road ahead would not be smooth sailing!</p><p>Indeed, Qingqiu was looking for trouble by asking me to participate… Meng Qi criticized himself silently.</p><p>Although the demonic deities were arrogant, they weren’t ignorant. The moment they saw the Buddha body, their faces all slightly changed color and thought of many things.</p><p>As Taili took a step forward, red, green, yellow, white, and black light revolved behind him, agglomerating into one before falling violently and directly absorbing the golden-bodied Buddha into it.</p><p>The five rays of light shook with endless ripples, Taili seemed unable to control it for too long. At this moment, No Thoughts nodded and opened his mouth.</p><p>The five-colored light shook and the golden-bodied Buddha flew out. The Great Roc Demonic Deity’s mouth suddenly became bigger, its upper lip against the sky and its lower lip touching the ground, and swallowed the body.</p><p>His stomach moved and struggled fiercely before quickly subsiding. No Thoughts laughed, “Tastes good.”</p><p>You’re not a roc demonic deity but Taotie demonic deity… Meng Qi’s mouth twitched.</p><p>“We have to be more careful next time,” the Little Fox Qingqiu said seriously.</p><p>Although Glow, Raka, and No Thoughts nodded, they were full of self-confidence.</p><p>Next, they started to encounter many bodies that were obviously stronger than before, but the four demonic deities showed their individual powers with irresistible force and their speed only slowed down by a little.</p><p>Meng Qi took in the entire situation and gradually came to a conclusion.</p><p>Compared to Qingqiu who cultivated the five virtues through practice, Glow who relied partly on blood inheritance had not reached the level of having five virtues on her. Her virtues of sage and credit were obviously weaker, and only the virtues of merit, morality and fortune matched her level. Could it be the case of three virtues at the celestial level, four at the Legendary and five at Creation…</p><p>Raka is good at destroying evil and is also a manifestation of destiny. Exchanging blows with him makes one forbidden by heaven and destiny. Luckily I can control destiny slightly…</p><p>No Thoughts’s flesh body is extremely strong and almost comparable to me currently, and he also has the ability to swallow all things…</p><p>Taili’s five-colored holy light has advanced again and the five colors can now be combined to contain contain all physical objects…</p><p>Although the speed of the contingent slowed down, it still quickly crossed the mountainside. The mountain road in front had collapsed and there was a cliff. It seemed that there had been a fierce battle recently.</p><p>A thought suddenly struck Meng Qi before he saw Raka stop and look at the other side of the cliff like he had sensed something. A huge dark golden silhouette was sitting cross-legged there. Looking like an elderly, his two eyebrows were extremely long and extend out of his face. Surrounding him were Udumbara flowers with no voids. When one looked at them, the flowers bloomed, showing a universe and a pure land. When no one looked at them, they were as silent as one’s heart.</p><p>The dark golden silhouette held his fists together with a faint smile on his face, full of zen.</p><p>Different from the other bodies that they had seen earlier on, this golden body did not have any ashes or dead air.</p><p>Meng Qi closed his eyes and gave a long sigh silently, “Maha Kasyapa…”</p><p>Compared to the previous time they exchanged blows, he seemed to have a faintly discernible wisdom, and his level of terror had risen!</p><p>“He’s not easy to deal with, let’s work together,” the Great Roc Demonic Deity who had all along shown arrogance said seriously.</p><p>At this moment, a roaring sound came out from the darkness at the bottom of the cliff, shaking the entire Spirited Mountain. Bodies of Arhats, Bodhisattvas, demonic deities, and demonic kings surged over and entered, forming a real-looking blood river that penetrated the horizon and flowed endlessly. The faces of Glow, Raka, and Taili all changed color and looked extremely solemn.</p><p>The bodies at the bottom of the cliff went well with the current Spirited Mountain, as though they were the dictators of the place and seemingly more difficult to deal with as compared to Maha Kasyapa!</p><p>Seeing their solemness, Meng Qi felt relieved instead. Although there were some unusual changes to the Nether Skeleton, his stamp was still there!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
