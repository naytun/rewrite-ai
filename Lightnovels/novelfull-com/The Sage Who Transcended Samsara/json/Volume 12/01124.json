With his eyes half-closed, he seemed to be visualizing.</p><p>Suddenly, brilliant dots floated around him. Glorious and pure, they were like twenty-four pearls encircling and hovering.</p><p>They weren’t the actual Sea Calming Pearls themselves but shadows formed by Meng Qi with their links and karma characteristics. They encircled like satellites, helping his deduction.</p><p>These twenty four pearls were all full and round. Inside them were chaotic and misty, like containing heavens. The released splendor slowly changed into five-colored lights that were dreamy and blurry, looking like real celestial treasures indeed.</p><p>As Meng Qi revolved the Principle of Karma and the Jade Mirage divination, a small portion of the pearls suddenly got smashed. These were the remaining portions of the clues that couldn’t be remembered in time previously, and couldn’t be used for tracking down.</p><p>The five-colored light turned even more rapidly, covering Meng Qi’s surrounding with a layer of light. Suddenly, almost ten shadows of Sea Calming Pearls became dull and exited from history silently.</p><p>They were the parts with obvious characteristics and clearer whereabouts. Being so easy to be found, how could it be his turn? Meng Qi’s expression didn’t change a bit as he had already selected a method. Indeed, this part of Sea Calming Pearl’s clue were initially clear but became blurry after deduction, so it had definitely been obtained by a mighty character. One of them had a familiar sense vaguely like the Lifeless Heaven!</p><p>And this in turn confirmed Meng Qi’s thoughts.</p><p>The remaining six or seven Sea Calming Pearls continued to rotate and the five-colored light became brighter. Two of them ended up with the same blurry state and couldn’t be investigated. Meng Qi preliminarily suspected them to have been also obtained by some mighty or powerful character and put them aside for the time being. Each of the other four had clues inside them, but some were vague and he couldn’t handle them with his current calculation ability.</p><p>The Sea Calming Pearls dimmed off one by one, leaving only two that flew to Meng Qi. They belonged to the type that could be attempted to search into currently.</p><p>Suddenly, Meng Qi stretched out his right hand and grabbed one of them, jumped up, and went directly into the vast starry sky.</p><p>The surroundings were pitch black, decorated with stars. Meng Qi’s skin was a pale golden color as he searched for clues along the sea of stars. Some deductions were influenced by either distance or astronomical factors, so he had to come closer before taking another step downward.</p><p>Hiding in the vast sea of stars were an unknown number of galaxies, each with a countless number of stars. Most of the stars each had a surface area bigger than the four main continents, and the distance between them were far beyond this.</p><p>Sometimes descending through space and sometimes crossing galaxies, Meng Qi went past many deserted and lifeless planets and a sense of loneliness as though he was the only living thing in the vast universe spontaneously came to his mind.</p><p>This was an inevitable emotion traveling in the starry sky.</p><p>Finally, he stopped the conveyance light. In a distance was a huge burning fireball of which the heaviness distorted the surroundings and heat evaporated all things.</p><p>On the other side was the deepest darkness rotating slowly, as though it was going to swallow all things. It was extremely horrifying, spurting lights from time to time like a monster spitting out bones after eating human flesh.</p><p>Based on previous backtracking and deduction results, Meng Qi was fifty percent certain that the Sea Calming Pearls had fallen into this black hole.</p><p>Precisely because of its concealment and the clues putting it out of sight when it fell, it hadn’t gotten the attention of any mighty character and hence remained till this day.</p><p>At a great distance apart, Meng Qi was still able to feel that kind of suction. He couldn’t help but let out a smile – he was actually going to barge into the inside of the black hole.</p><p>Giving his Cloud Crown a push, his body suddenly expanded, touching the sky. The acupoints on his body were released and celestial strength were added onto his body. The pale golden light showed an indestructible spirit.</p><p>Thereafter, a deep chaotic auspicious cloud surged out from the top of his head with rays of dim light hanging, enveloping the humongous body.</p><p>Meng Qi took a step forward and went deep into the black hole area, going along with the accretion without resisting it. There was no more light around. Colors could sometimes be seen in front while the Supreme Endless Premier auspicious cloud broke down the extruding terrifying force.</p><p>He didn’t fall downward directly but followed the law of hovering, getting deeper and darker. Meng Qi only felt his body seemed to have completely isolated from the world of mortals and was walking toward death.</p><p>Time and space were in chaos. Not knowing how much time had passed, the accretion got stronger and stronger. The auspicious cloud squeaked and ripples appeared.</p><p>This is the bottom… Meng Qi understood. An ancient banner suddenly appeared above the auspicious cloud before falling and matching with the Invincible Blade. Then, the Invincible Blade struck.</p><p>The blade beam was like a purple line, splitting the front directly.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Before the chain reaction, Meng Qi grabbed the chance and rushed into the gap in the purple light.</p><p>In front of him, light and shadow fluctuated as time and space got more chaotic. If Meng Qi didn’t have Nirvana characteristics, he might just get lost.</p><p>Meng Qi, a bright light exploded and illuminated his field of view – there was a mountain with spiritual beauty in front.</p><p>What a familiar mountain? Meng Qi frowned and flew over. As he was about to land, he was suddenly taken aback. Isn’t this his own Kunlun Mountain? Isn’t the Jade Mirage Palace right there?</p><p>What happened?</p><p>Why am I back home after going through the black hole?</p><p>An illusion?</p><p>Looking back, the sky was clear and blue, what black hole?</p><p>Doing some deduction, familiar people such as Mister Lu Da, Jiang Zhiwei, and Ruan Yushu all existed here. The karma was definitely real and couldn’t be faked.</p><p>Meng Qi got more confused. The black hole actually has this kind of effect?</p><p>But the clue of the Sea Calming Pearls has been cut off!</p><p>Filled with speculations, he was about to press the conveyance light when the Myriad World Talisman sounded — it was Jiang Zhiwei’s conversation request.</p><p>“You’re finally out from retreat?” Jiang Zhiwei asked smilingly, “I saw your online status inside the right path for humans is the vicissitudes of life hall.”</p><p>Out from retreat? Meng Qi frowned slightly and laughed intentionally, “Oh yes, did you find any suitable opponent to test your sword recently?”</p><p>“No, but I’ve entered the celestial realm when you were in retreat,” Jiang Zhiwei said with slight complacency.</p><p>Celestial realm? Do you have to be so fast? Meng Qi got a shock. With his encounter of one night equivalent to five years, his speed of reaching the celestial realm was already very amazing. How many years has Zhiwei attained Dharmakaya?</p><p>Shocked, confused, and worried, he mumbled a few sentences before hanging up, planning to get to the bottom of things from other areas.</p><p>As his conveyance light fell, He Mu and Fang Huayin both came out to receive him.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded with a smile, “Not bad, you’ve improved very…”</p><p>His words suddenly paused and there was shock in his eyes. What, his two disciples already attained half-step Dharmakaya!</p><p>How long has he been away?</p><p>Didn’t he just make a short trip to the west?</p><p>“Teacher, I need to seek your advice on something,” Fang Huayn accepted her teacher’s compliment and took the chance to say.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded and gave pointers while he opened the Myriad World Talisman to search the forum.</p><p>As he looked on, he suddenly got a big shock.</p><p>Because the year stated was the twentieth year of the new calendar!</p><p>What was the new calendar? The new calendar started after the unification of the North and the South!</p><p>In other words, he had arrived at more than ten years later – the future!</p><p>Was there really a time tunnel hidden in the black hole?</p><p>Although he had experience of going back to the past, but such a strange incident still made Meng Qi feel uneasy. After answering and dismissing his two disciples, he entered the Jade Mirage Palace and came to the side of the lotus pond.</p><p>The moment he went near, his gaze froze. A figure in a black robe was standing in front of him – tall and slim but full of strength.</p><p>He actually appeared in front of him without him noticing?</p><p>“You are?” Meng Qi asked and was ready to strike.</p><p>With a hidden disposition, the black-robed figure did not turn back but said in a low voice, “Since I woke up from my deep sleep, I have heard that the Principle of Karma has made its appearance. I am specially here to get it.”</p><p>His disposition suddenly erupted, its vastness was like the conglomeration of countless galaxies, pressing on Meng Qi until he was unable to show his strength and cracks appeared inside his body.</p><p>This was the power of the Legendary realm!</p><p>The Legendary mighty character who covets the Principle of Karma? Meng Qi breathed in slightly as thoughts ran through his mind, thinking of a way to stay alive.</p><p>At this moment, the sky suddenly turned dark and dense brilliance appeared. Stars oscillated, forming trajectories that were pure and clean, making the sea of stars look beautiful as though it was storming.</p><p>This was different from the stars that fell like rain when the Heavenly Court fell. The former went completely downward but the stars here were flying both slanted and horizontally.</p><p>“Mighty characters in deep sleep enter the world one by one, astronomical phenomenon changed and naturally stars fall like rain,” the black-robed figure turned his head. His majestic and horrifying strength was like a shining sun, swallowing Meng Qi such that he could only see a pair of strange golden and silver eyes.</p><p>The pure strength completely suppressed Meng Qi. He fought to the best of his abilities but still couldn’t resist it. His consciousness dissipated bit by bit and his dharmakaya body completely disintegrated.</p><p>No influential characters appeared. It seemed that there was an alliance formed behind the scene. Some reached an agreement and some were intercepted halfway.</p><p>Everything was gone and in front of him was eternal deadness. Suddenly, there was a flicker of light – it was from an ancient glaze lamp!</p><p>Once the lamp appeared, Meng Qi forcefully opened his eyes. The darkness had faded away and in front of him was a universe with inverted galaxies.</p><p>The universe miniaturized and was covered by the chaotic hole.</p><p>“This is the interior of the black hole?” Meng Qi took in a deep breath as fear still lingered from his encounter earlier on.</p><p>It seemed like when he went through the black hole, his sense of time and space was messed up. As a result, he entered the turbulent flow of time and experienced a possibility of the future. If not for the Principle of Karma, he might have been completely lost!</p><p>In that future, although his cultivation leveled up fast, he couldn’t catch up with the speed of the Final Trial entering its climax and didn’t attain the Legendary realm, hence turned into ashes…</p><p>Who was that Legendary mighty character with strange golden and silver eyes?</p><p>A sense of urgency spontaneously filled Meng Qi’s mind.</p><p>Calming himself, he looked over and saw the miniature universe was actually a pearl with a dim five-colored light around it!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
