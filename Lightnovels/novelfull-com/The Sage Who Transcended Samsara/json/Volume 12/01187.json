His tens of thousands of years of practice seemed to have encountered his born nemesis, and he couldn’t keep a calm mind anymore. His thoughts surged like boiling water, dragging his instinct of his infinity all the way down.</p><p>His golden body seemed to be shackled, and his spirit seemed to be frozen. At this moment, he couldn’t break free and couldn’t make an effective reaction beyond fearing the chaos, but could only watch helplessly at the giant mouth and body!</p><p>The three relics emitted flammules with blooming white lotuses, stopping Meng Qi’s hand blade and the collapse of the Buddhist Kingdom. Maitreya also noticed the shocking change in the sky above Guangling City, and the smile on his face completely disappeared for the first time. Ignoring Meng Qi’s follow-up attack, he directly appeared beside Fahualin. His body with twenty heads and sixteen arms were wielding pestles and swords, attacking the glazed hand together. The three relics paused for a short while before flying up again. Moving up and down, it fixed the surrounding world and eliminated all abnormalities.</p><p>Damiaoxiang on the other side showed the projection of Bodhisattva of all realms, and was battling in full swing with the mad dogs all over the sky, but he had also noticed the anomaly over at this side here. He tilted the treasure bottle, pouring the water of Ganga directly over the sky above Guangling, and engulfed the glazed golden hand.</p><p>Supreme Buddha! Meng Qi recognized the origin of the glazed golden hand. Feeling a chill, he did not use the chance to attack Maitreya.</p><p>This is the Supreme Buddha sealed at the peak of Spirited Mountain!</p><p>The Supreme Buddha who wanted to devour all Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Arhats, and Wisdom Kings to achieve enlightenment!</p><p>He actually escaped from the hands of the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, hid in the territory of the Great Zhou, and had been waiting for the opportunity to attack Maitreya and his party!</p><p>Just as this thought came to his mind, Meng Qi saw that the glazed golden hand lost its dazzling color and faded into a light flesh color, emitting infinite white light that was the purest and without any impurities.</p><p>As the light surged, the water of Ganga suddenly transpired and evaporated, and its flow stopped. Maitreya did not dare to look at it directly, and the sixteen arms that had been thrown out subconsciously blocked in front of him.</p><p>As white light floated, pure and clear illusions of statues of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas appeared. There was the golden-winged Great Roc, and also Bodhisattva Manjushri - it was neither an object nor a heresy, but his real self.</p><p>The illusions formed a Thousand Buddha Formation, blocking the whereabouts of the three relics. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the huge mouth opened up and swallowed the petrified Fahualin!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Having heard a strange sound, Meng Qi only felt a star symbolizing the Great Bodhisattva inside the vast starry sky of karma was burning, dragging its flame tail, and merging into the purest strange star, making it strong again.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A light pillar dashed out of Guangling, swaying the clouds and intending to turn the destroyed Buddhist Kingdom into an infinite sea of light.</p><p>A grand and solemn sound came out from it, “If I achieve Bodhi, all the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Arhats, Jin-gangs, and Wisdom Kings shall all be my incarnations.”</p><p>“If I achieve Bodhi, I shall be the one and only Supreme Buddha in all realms and worlds.”</p><p>Maitreya sighed again, unable to smile. The three relics fell, with vicissitudes of the past, the current disaster, and also the future enlightenment, almost connecting into an illusory long river that he controlled with his breath, allowed the sea of light to fade before putting his palms together in front, “If I achieve Bodhi, all sentient beings shall be free from sufferings, and all realms shall be a Buddhist Kingdom without any sea of sufferings.”</p><p>The Buddha’s voice reverberated, and the three relics actually stripped the infinite pure light, vaguely showing the strange Buddha that was formed by the pure white light.</p><p>It’s really the Supreme Buddha… Meng Qi slightly nodded, not knowing which side to help at that moment.</p><p>Judging from the process earlier on, the presence of the Supreme Buddha was rather weak, only a little stronger than the current Maitreya. With his unstable realm, it seemed that he had gotten the worst of it from the cudgel of the Great Sage Equaling Heaven, and it was unknown how he managed to escape. As such, he did not dare to attack Maitreya in the face and could only wait patiently, seizing the opportunity to launch an attack before using his remaining force, barely resisting a blow, and swallowed Bodhisattva Fahualin.</p><p>With this, his presence expanded and he had recovered a fair bit. He already had the feeling of being slightly inferior to the current Bull Demon King, surpassing Maitreya in terms of realm and strength but relatively inferior in other aspects, especially when the three relics restrained him to a great extent. More importantly, Maitreya still had the recovering Buddhist Kingdom, Damiaoxiang, and the Bodhisattvas and Arhats who could form the Thousand Buddha Formation. If there were no external forces intervening, it would be difficult to predict the outcome.</p><p>If he helped the Supreme Buddha, first eliminating Maitreya would really help in the Heaven Conferring Platform matter. But if he swallowed the future Buddha, he would be too powerful to be controlled, and this would bring harm to Meng Qi himself. This was especially so when Meng Qi always had a good relationship with the Eastern Pure Land of Azure Stones. Letting the Supreme Buddha grow would inevitably threaten the Moonlight Bodhisattva and even the Medicine Buddha, offending his allies for nothing and losing helping hands.</p><p>But if he helped Maitreya deal with the Supreme Buddha, then what about the Heaven Conferring Platform?</p><p>This was just like over at the celestial ambassadors of the Luo Sect. Guangchengzi said not to fall out completely, so he did not delay the demonic race and the Buddhist Kingdom and concentrated his power to remove them first. With Nezha’s strength and realm, and the weakening of the formation, it would be easy to eliminate the celestial ambassadors. Unfortunately, it was impossible to do so, and could only give an occasional attack to terrify and delay them.</p><p>This was the dilemma brought about by the intricacies of the relationships.</p><p>At this moment, the illusions of Buddhas reappeared around the pure white Buddha as he said solemnly, “A real Buddha cannot be seen, see it and you will fall.”</p><p>Just as the voice trailed off, many Bodhisattvas and Arhats who were looking at him screamed wildly. Pure white fire started burning around their bodies and was about to burn their golden bodies, making them fall one by one.</p><p>Maitreya showed his signature smile again, stretched out his right hand, holding the three relics. The surroundings suddenly became quiet - the screams disappeared, the white fire extinguished, and white lotuses bloomed.</p><p>“Flowers bloomed to see me”!</p><p>The Supreme Buddha had his own illusory Thousand Buddha Formation, contending that the flowers bloomed to see himself.</p><p>Watching the battle, thoughts ran in Meng Qi’s mind and he quickly made a decision. He beckoned for the Celestial Hound to come back and commanded, “Bite whoever has the upper hand!”</p><p>“Woof!” the Celestial Hound nodded happily, its tail hanging downward, jumped two steps and conveyed into the void.</p><p>This fellow is obviously an expert in the Seal of Void.</p><p>Alright, let’s strive to maintain a balance in power over here, and I shall go to the Luo Sect on the other side, unite Shaoxuan and the rest, and pretend to strike a vicious blow to scare away the celestial ambassadors!</p><p>This kind of thing cannot be entrusted to Nezha. This fellow has always been vicious and might just turn pretense into reality.</p><p>With a flash of his figure, Meng Qi’s incarnation of the Eight Nine Mysteries appeared in Nanzhou.</p><p>…</p><p>In the boundless glazed Buddhist Kingdom, the Moonlight Bodhisattva under the sacred Bodhi tree was silent for a long time before finally showing a smile, “There is a current node in the River of Time, and the future is just a variety of possibilities and not reality. If I knew how to go to the future, I would have already attempted to free myself from the sea of sufferings.”</p><p>“But since the future is all kinds of possibilities, the future scenes that were derived may happen, with just differences in size. If you can figure out where the Medicine Buddha will definitely appear in the future, then leave a letter or a stone or something there. He should be able to see it.”</p><p>Meng Qi was a little confused listening to it, and was thinking carefully, when the Supreme Buddha suddenly appeared and swallowed Fahualin. The Moonlight Bodhisattva became solemn and looked outside the glazed pure land, “It’s him?”</p><p>…</p><p>On the Heaven Conferring Platform, the beautiful picture of mountains and rivers was covering it like curtains, reflecting the illusory images of the four-color sword beam.</p><p>Meng Qi was sitting inside and controlling the sword formation when happiness suddenly struck him. He looked up into the sky and saw Gao Lan who was wearing a heavenly crown and yellow robe fly back.</p><p>Gao Lan stepped downward and coldly said, “Third brother, I’ve already contacted the allies. The Island of Three Clouds, Shangjing Palace, and the various celestial lords, etc., are about to strike.”</p><p>He was about to get close to the Heaven Conferring Platform when he saw the four-color sword beams intertwine, red, green, black, and white colors surged and formed a wall, blocking himself outside.</p><p>“Third brother, what’s the meaning of this?” Gao Lan asked with deep eyes.</p><p>Meng Qi looked closely at him and said in a strange tone, “Emperor brother, this is not the style of your speech. Shouldn’t you just say you have already contacted the allies and wait for me to ask you who they are before saying in detail about the Island of Three Clouds and Shangjing Palace? Answering one question with one sentence shows the deep and cold temperament of an emperor. It’s not like you to finish saying everything all at one go.”</p><p>Gao Lan showed a faint smile and said indifferently, “With the important matter about to succeed, it is inevitable that I’m excited and lose self-control.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly, and felt that it should be so. Suddenly, the four-color sword beams burst and formed a torrent, and it struck directly at Gao Lan!</p><p>Gao Lan stretched out his right palm, pressed forward and blocked the sword beam. Full of doubts and shock, he heard Meng Qi’s laughter, “I was just a little skeptical at first and tested a little. Now I’m certain that you are a fake big brother!”</p><p>“If you are really big brother, your answer to the question just now should be, “I’ve always been crazy, when did I ever have a regular style of speech?”</p><p>This Gao Lan was transformed from Yuan Hong in order to trick the four celestial swords. He was furious hearing what Meng Qi said and vomited blood.</p><p>Is this a normal answer?</p><p>Meng Qi looked at Gao Lan change into a white-haired giant monkey, laughing silently inside. Of all people, you choose to transform into a madman. Do you think it’s so easy to imitate a madman?</p><p>Just a little test and you gave yourself away!</p><p>He was about to activate the sword formation to suppress Yuan Hong, and then use a magic item to create a manifestation in order to delay this great sage from destroying the formation, when he suddenly felt coldness in his heart with an indescribable danger.</p><p>As thoughts ran in his mind, the white swordsman flew out of the auspicious cloud and made preparations.</p><p>Suddenly, a finger lingering with demonic air poked out from the void and pointed straight on the beautiful picture of mountains and rivers.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The northern part of Ganzhou collapsed straight away. The mountains no longer existed and the rivers dissipated. Cities and tens of thousands of living beings turned into ashes.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The collapse went downward, and the entire area was torn apart, flying into the sky and turning into tiny stars that emitted brilliant light.</p><p>The original place became deep and bottomless with the demonic air of the Netherworld coming out from it. It was another endless sea.</p><p>Hooooooo!</p><p>The real world suddenly turned dark, and there were cries all around. The wind smelled of blood and blood fell like rain.</p><p>A terrifying object seemed to be landing from high above, and was about to hit the finger.</p><p>But layers of demonic realm appeared around the finger and there were countless demonic laughs. The finger penetrated the hole on the beautiful picture of mountains and rivers, and pointed at Meng Qi.</p><p>Poof!</p><p>It hit the incarnation of the swordsman, smearing the sword aura dragged him into the Netherworld, turned him into a pool of pus!</p><p>The Demonic Monarch! Meng Qi had only this thought in his mind.</p><p>When did a demonic body of the Demonic Monarch awaken in advance!</p><p>He really came!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
