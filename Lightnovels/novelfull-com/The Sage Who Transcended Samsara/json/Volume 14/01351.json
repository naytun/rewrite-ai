The large-scale destruction caused by the aftermath of the battle on the other side of the river had already been restored to its original state under the influence of time reversal. The mountains were clear, the waters were beautiful, and the paths were crisscrossed with red dust, in the thirty-six ancient wells surrounded by jade railings, twenty-four of them were constantly bursting with flames and multicolored clouds. It was as if they were boiling, embellishing a dreamy and extraordinary feeling.</p><p>Deep within the many palaces and pavilions, in the hollow Jade Hall, Meng Qi received the congratulations of Guang Chengzi, Chi Zhizi, Gao Lan, Jiang Zhiwei, and other fellow disciples and good friends. He officially took over this place and became the true master of the Hollow Jade Temple, the new “Heavenly venerate of the origin”.</p><p>After a series of formalities, Guang Chengzi looked at Meng Qi, who was surrounded by golden lanterns and jade chains. The light of the Qing clouds was like a curtain of water in front of the eaves. He sighed deeply and said,</p><p>“Junior Brother Headmaster, why bother…”</p><p>There was no real loss on his side. If he took a step back, everything would be peaceful. Not only did the dao path being cut off mean that there was no hope of transcending this era, it also meant that there would be a backlash. The embryonic form of the dao fruit that was not far away would probably become difficult.</p><p>At the legendary realm, if the changes in history were great, it would be like the primordial beginning heavenly venerate opening up the source of time in the past, intercepting and extracting a “River”after ascending to godhood. The almighty beings would be located at an infinite height due to the spiritual light of their natures, the remnants of memories that had nothing to do with them would be confused if the changes in history directly involved their own family. They would not feel that there was anything wrong with their own experiences. Only when they reached the destiny realm.., only when they could feel the erosion of the river of time would they be able to understand the things that had happened and changed. However, they still lacked a sense of reality. It was as if they were in a bizarre dream, it was a dream where one’s own fate developed in another way.</p><p>If one did not reach the other side, one would not leave the sea of bitterness. In the end, one could not see reality. Even someone like Guang Chengzi, who had completed the destiny realm and had explored the other side without lacking accumulation, did not have a deep-rooted hatred for his death. It was as if he had dreamed of being killed by someone, there was no reason for him to wake up and pursue the matter.</p><p>As for Jiang Zhiwei and Ruan Yushu, it was even more difficult for them to understand Meng Qi’s feelings when he slashed out. It was not that they did not understand it well, but they did not understand what was going on at all.</p><p>The difference between realms wasn’t just in strength.</p><p>And among so many realms, the biggest difference was between the other shore and the lower levels. The difference between heaven and earth was also indescribable!</p><p>Meng Qi’s gaze was gentle, and there wasn’t the slightest bit of the other shore’s majesty. After looking around, he slowly said,</p><p>“For Mother Jin, this is the best development.”</p><p>“If I can endure it and repay the favor of the Dao first, then looking at the current situation, I can only help her with two things. One is to stop Maitreya from breaking free from the sea of bitterness, so that Amitabha’s efforts to reduce and search for emptiness can not progress. The other is to plan many ways to help little sang to break through the other shore and help gold mother to get closer to the dao fruit. After ending the favor of the Dao, I am sure that the embryonic form of the dao fruit is qualified to participate in their fight. Moreover, the resentment and hatred still exist in my heart. In addition to little sang’s relationship, there is no possibility of cooperation with him.”</p><p>“Therefore, he deliberately provoked me to strike with his blade. In this way, not only will my path of cultivation be cut off, I will no longer have any hope of fighting with him for the dao fruit in this era. I can also delay the original teacher’s steps of transcendence and leave hope for him. As for the matter of Maitreya breaking free from the sea of bitterness, when the golden mother reveals her true colors and Amitabha exposes the Fu Empress, it doesn’t matter which side I help. And when little sang attacks the other shore, I will do my best to help her whether or not she has the grace of achieving the Dao.”</p><p>“It goes without saying how mother gold chose to kill several birds with one stone.”</p><p>Listening to Meng Qi’s description quietly, Celestial Master Wen Shu could not help but exclaim, “In ancient times, she was good at planning. After becoming the other shore, her grasp of the hearts of people and the situation became even more chilling.”</p><p>The key point of this matter was that whether or not there was a ‘favor of attaining Dao’, the junior brother of the sect master would help the Gold Emperor to reduce the number of empty products and attack the other shore. Since that was the case, wasting the ‘favor of attaining Dao’on this.., obviously, the gold emperor could not maximize the benefits. It was better to force the younger brother of the headmaster to cut off his own path, and at the same time, delay the teacher’s progress in Achieving Dao.</p><p>And this crux was deliberately created by the gold emperor to manipulate people’s hearts and destinies from the very beginning.</p><p>From the moment Gu Xiaosang was born and the younger brother of the headmaster was placed into the chess game by the Devil and Buddha, the Gold Emperor had been waiting for this move!</p><p>Just thinking about these details made him feel like he had fallen into an eternal ice cave. It was a bone-chilling and despairing feeling.</p><p>“But I still need the sect master’s junior brother to be willing to make this strike…”Guangchengzi sighed again. He did not want to see Meng Qi doing something that was not worth it for the sake of his illusionary fate.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and then said seriously,</p><p>“If I can’t make this strike, I will slowly be assimilated by the ‘Nirvana realm’and become the supreme will of heaven. I will no longer have the slightest bit of humanity.”</p><p>“And the Dao of others is not the Dao of ‘Me’</p><p>“This slash severed the path of the Dao and saved ‘me’</p><p>“If I don’t even have the ‘Me’, then what is the Dao fruit without the dao fruit? What is the point of transcending or not transcending?”</p><p>He did not say much about this matter. This was an idea that was formed from his own experiences, his three outlooks, and his beliefs. It was normal for others to not understand it. However, even if the path ahead was perilous and even cut off, he would not hesitate.</p><p>After billions of tribulations and countless eras, the difference would be whether it would be su Meng, the ‘Primordial beginning heavenly venerate’, or the pure primordial beginning heavenly venerate.</p><p>With that, he turned to look at Gao Lan. The Emperor Sword flew out from the clear circle of light behind his head, and he threw it at Gao Lan:</p><p>“Imperial brother, it will be difficult to recover from the Great Zhou. However, the islands in the East Sea, the countries that have ascended to godhood, and the four great continents in the West all have great potential. It is not difficult to establish a human path again. I hope that one day, you and I can stand side by side.”</p><p>Gao Lan took the human emperor sword. He suddenly felt more real about his experiences before the change. He laughed and said boldly,</p><p>“No need to agitate me. I have never lagged behind others in my life. Sooner or later, the human emperor and the Celestial Master will be called the same.”</p><p>After saying that, he picked up the light golden long sword and turned around to walk out of the Jade Pure Palace. Seeing the situation, Wen Shu reminded him, “The whip is still under control. Don’t forget to go to Dou Shuai Palace to get it.”</p><p>While the Luo sect and the Buddhist sect were sweeping the world, they didn’t let go of the world of Gods Ascension. Duke Qi Huan and little white hid in the Dou Shuai palace.</p><p>Gao Lan pursed his thin lips, nodded slightly, and left with his head held high.</p><p>Meng Qi looked at Jiang Zhiwei and Ruan Yushu again and laughed:</p><p>“Don’t call me by the wrong name in the future.”</p><p>Originally, because Meng Qi had ascended to the other shore, the back of his head was bright and clear, the clouds above his head were dark and chaotic, and the golden lanterns and ribbons around his body made Jiang Zhiwei and Ruan Yushu feel a strong sense of alienation, it was as if there was an insurmountable gap between the two sides. The Su Meng they knew in the past was already a high and mighty figure. However, as soon as these words came out of his mouth, Jiang Zhiwei burst out in laughter, and Ruan Yushu pursed his lips into a faint smile, they both felt that the distance between them had been shortened in an instant.</p><p>This was perhaps the person on the other shore who didn’t have the taste and airs of a great figure the most.</p><p>“Yes, Little Monk.”Jiang Zhi held back her laughter and answered. Ruan Yushu nodded slightly.</p><p>Meng Qi said with a smile, “If you can deeply understand the spiritual light of your nature and distinguish the ‘true’and ‘false’causeD by the changes in history, you will benefit greatly in the future.”</p><p>After giving some pointers to his fellow disciples, Meng Qi asked them to leave separately. He had to stabilize his realm first.</p><p>When the Jade Pure Palace returned to its eternal silence, a bright and round light flashed behind his head. The green and vigorous tree of Great Dao was faintly discernible. Two illusory dao fruits, the Overlord Saber, and the Three Treasures Ruyi were hanging on the branches, gu Xiaosang appeared in front of him.</p><p>She was no longer as pale as before. There were tears in her eyes, and she looked as if nothing had happened to her. However, there was a bit of calmness in her ethereal temperament.</p><p>“Don’t worry. I’m used to being beaten up. I Won’t collapse just like that. I’m just a little lost. My past self is not shaped by the gold emperor.”Gu Xiaosang smiled faintly and was unusually calm in front of Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi looked at her and said, “The gold emperor can only guide you. The key lies in your original personality. I believe that you will slowly walk out of this legendary stage.”</p><p>Hearing that, Gu Xiaosang laughed softly. “I always have goosebumps when my husband talks in such a tone.”</p><p>She paused, she continued, “But I’m always unwilling in my heart. So what if I walk out? “I still have to follow his ‘plan’and motivate myself with monstrous hatred. I’ll attack the other shore with my resolute nature… It’s better to cut off my own body in exchange for the Hopeless Dao Fruit of his era.”</p><p>“You won’t make such a choice. It’s equivalent to admitting that you’re a subordinate of the golden mother and have no meaning to your own existence.”Meng Qi looked at Gu Xiaosang and said with a smile, “And you didn’t attack the other shore just for the Golden Mother.”</p><p>“…”Gu Xiaosang was stunned. She frowned and her eyes were watery. “What kind of mushy words are you going to say again, Hubby?”</p><p>Meng Qi coughed lightly and said,</p><p>“After achieving the other shore, time is hard to erode, and it’s impossible for all the people around me to be able to reach the other shore. Even if I use all my means, after billions of years and a few eras, they will eventually die one by one, making me less and less tied to the secular world. In the end, I’ll be completely cut off and become a high and mighty figure.”</p><p>His voice was bleak, as if he had already seen the ending:</p><p>“I need you to help me achieve the other shore and live together hand in hand.”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s eyes slowly curved, and then she said with a low laugh,</p><p>“My husband is getting better at talking…”</p><p>At this point, she rolled her eyes, looked outside the hollow jade temple, and said with a smile,</p><p>“Some benefits have been delivered.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
