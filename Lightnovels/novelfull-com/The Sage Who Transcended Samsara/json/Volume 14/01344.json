He almost blurted out, “He is going to attack the other side? Today? Now?”</p><p>Wasn’t this too sudden and unexpected?</p><p>Ever since Yang Jian cut off the hand that old mother Wusheng had extended into the Netherworld and joined forces with Meng Qi to isolate the black heavenly emperor, burning lamp was completely unaware of the situation in the netherworld. He had no idea that Meng Qi was carrying a knife and a sword on his back, step by step, he walked towards the real world.</p><p>“Yes,”Ananda’s phantom answered concisely.</p><p>“How could this be?”Burning Lamp’s tone was filled with doubt, “He has accumulated enough without saying anything, but the positions of the other shore’s bigwigs have not changed much. Without waiting for Maitreya to prove this variable and opportunity, what exactly does he have to rely on?”</p><p>Moreover, he was so open and aboveboard, afraid that others would not know!</p><p>This was not the time when Emperor Qing had broken free from the Sea of suffering. The other shore’s people had not returned yet, so there was a limit to what they could do!</p><p>Could it be that behind the scenes, some important figures on the other shore had changed their attitudes and the situation was developing in Su Meng’s favor, so he had nothing to fear and attacked the other shore in the most direct and arrogant manner?</p><p>When he thought of this possibility, ripples appeared on the spiritual altar of the Burning Lamp Heart Lake, and a fear that he had not felt for many years appeared.</p><p>If that was the case, not only would his path to the Dao be completely cut off, but he would most likely die without a burial place.</p><p>Which other shore would have changed their attitude? Would Su Meng make the decision to break free from the Sea of suffering right now?</p><p>The Golden Emperor? No, the hatred between him and Su Meng was as deep as the sea, and there was also Gu Xiaosang, this dead knot. There was no way to compromise and be kind.</p><p>Bodhi ancient Buddha? The three of his corpses were missing because of Su Meng. The enmity was extremely heavy, but it was not impossible to resolve it. As long as he paid a sufficient price and made a great wish, of course, he and Amitabha would always advance and retreat together, they would not change their attitude unilaterally.</p><p>Amitabha? He valued himself very much, but in order to attain the Dao of Maitreya, there was no other shore obstructing him. It was also not impossible for him to make a secret agreement with the Celestial Master of Morals and make an exchange..</p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p>The ancient Buddha with the burning lamp seemed to hear his own heartbeat, which had been silent for thousands of years. It was also as if the footsteps of Su Meng walking out of the other shore were stepping on his heart again and again.</p><p>He was no longer confident about the situation. As someone who had completed his destiny, there was a limit to how much he could intervene in the battlefield of the other shore.</p><p>At this moment, he heard the phantom of Ah Nan calmly say,</p><p>“Don’t worry, Su Meng Won’t come out of the netherworld. If he leaves, he will definitely fall.”</p><p>The certainty in his tone made the waves in burning lamp’s heart calm down a lot, but then he was shocked. He seemed to have understood something. He turned his head to look at the ruins of Mount Numinous and the three treasures ruyi that were pressing down on the peak.</p><p>Could it be the Devil Buddha..</p><p>He did not dare to think about it anymore and made a decision in his heart. If his side had the upper hand, he would wait for the “Dao one seal”to enter. If both sides were evenly matched, he would not care so much and would personally enter the battlefield.., he would do his best to stop Su Meng from reaching the other side.</p><p>At the critical moment when he was trying to reach the other side, those who had completed their destiny could also cause damage, just like when the Azure Emperor was trying to attain the DAO in the past.</p><p>In short, there was no turning back. If he did not make a decision, he would be thrown into chaos!</p><p>..</p><p>In the land of Buddha, there were Buddhist temples everywhere. White lotuses were everywhere, and pools of merit could be seen from time to time. In Changle City, where the palace used to be, the eleventh-grade lotus throne quietly bloomed, carrying the fat golden body of Buddha Maitreya.</p><p>He had received some advice from Amitabha Buddha, and a hint of surprise appeared on his smiling face. Obviously, he had not expected su meng to suddenly and recklessly step out of the Netherworld and attack the paradise on the other side.</p><p>Maitreya had a vague understanding of Su Meng’s accumulation. He vaguely guessed that Amitabha Buddha, ancient Bodhi Buddha, and old mother Wusheng were secretly indulging in order to give su Meng the courage to leave the netherworld, therefore, he had actually completed the three “Historical landmarks”that were crucial in backtracking the past. He had also grasped all kinds of possibilities by occupying the things that were bound to happen in the future. Once he moved the “Past”out of the netherworld.., he could immediately make a breakthrough in this aspect.</p><p>As for the matter of bearing illusory dao fruit, his boundless path of chaos had long been able to do so.</p><p>However, accumulating enough was only an important aspect of reaching the other shore, not the whole thing. The attitude of the bigwigs on the other shore was crucial. The right time and place could not be ignored. Their temperament had been tempered a thousand times. His family could be considered to have touched the threshold of the other shore, it was precisely because there had never been a sudden inspiration or a sudden inspiration that they did not dare to try this step for a long time.</p><p>Originally, they had thought that Su Meng would wait until he reached the other shore to fish in troubled waters. But now, it seemed that he had chosen to ask for his heart, to seek his nature, and to prove his dao according to his own path.</p><p>Wait until he stirred up a thousand waves with a stone, and completely messed up the situation, then perhaps his opportunity would appear!</p><p>..</p><p>Lu Ya hid in the primordial chaos fragment and re-refined the previously damaged nail head seven arrow book.</p><p>Suddenly, he frowned slightly, and a complicated and indescribable emotion appeared on his ancient face:</p><p>“Su Meng is about to leave the Netherworld and attack the other shore.”</p><p>Han Guang’s aura nearby became increasingly ethereal, as if the sky was empty. There was a Bodhi tree on his knees. After pondering for a moment, he said, “Where is Su Meng’s confidence?”</p><p>The situation in Jiuyou had been isolated for a long time. Even he, who was holding the Bodhi tree, only barely noticed it when Su Meng was near the edge of Jiuyou. How did Lu Ya find out about this?</p><p>“Su Meng might not even know about his confidence. He just chose to trust Gu Xiaosang.”Lu Ya chuckled. “Gu Xiaosang thought that she could hide it from the world, but she can’t hide it from me.”</p><p>“She can’t hide it from the person behind you, can she?”Han Guang smiled and said nothing.</p><p>“Su Meng is still too reckless. When Maitreya tries to verify the dao, the situation will become more chaotic, and his chances will be greater.”Lu Ya did not know if he was regretting or gloating. “When the time comes, I’ll have to borrow your Bodhi magical tree.”</p><p>Han Guang shook his head and said, “Other People’s Dao is not my dao. If Su Meng is as cautious as you guys, he will lose his most important spirit and courage to fight for a slim chance. Heh, the celestial emperor yuan is still mad saber, the Thunder Saber Mad Monk, and the reckless vajra.”</p><p>Lu Ya did not speak anymore. His eyes were half-opened as he adjusted his body and mind, waiting for the opportunity to make a move.</p><p>In all the worlds in the universe, the powerful figures with powerful divine abilities behind them all knew that the Yuan emperor was about to leave the nine nether world and begged for the supreme path to the other shore, they all moved to the glazed world, the fusang ancient tree realm, the thirty-three heavens, and other places to prevent themselves from being affected.</p><p>The era was coming to an end, and the end of the world was coming. After Emperor Qing, was it the Yuan emperor who achieved the Dao?</p><p>Or did he disappear into thin air and the hollow jade temple completely withdrew from this era’s competition?</p><p>..</p><p>In the nine serenities realm, Meng Qi carried a saber and a sword on his back. His eyes were deep and serene as he looked at the real world. Every step he took was condensing his aura and absorbing the past.</p><p>Since little sang said that she was well prepared, then he believed that she was really well prepared!</p><p>Since she was ready and had accumulated enough experience, she might as well make the best use of this opportunity to settle the scores and settle the disputes today!</p><p>This was not a reckless decision, but a decision made on her own path. If it were Wang Siyuan, it would not be a problem for him to take advantage of Maitreya’s “Momentum”to ascend to the shore, just like how he jiu used to ascend to heaven in the past, but he could not.., if he really wanted to take advantage of Maitreya’s momentum, the sharpness in his heart would dissipate a lot. Without the preparation of the final struggle, the “Blade”that could split the sky would no longer be pure.</p><p>Because the obstacle on the other side was the biggest obstacle to break out of the sea of bitterness, people often overlooked the danger of reaching the other side, not only on the outside, but also on the inside. Even if there were no big figures involved, even if they had accumulated enough, if there were any flaws in their temperament.., they could not avoid the ending of death and disappearance of the Dao. Emperor Zhenwu was a dao child with a deep background and many treasures. He had studied at the origin of life and death for many years, and his accumulated strength was definitely not inferior to his current self, he was just lucky at the last moment and did not have the courage to “Learn the Dao in the morning and die in the evening”. He used the primordial Yang ruler and failed.</p><p>No matter how many arrangements, plans, and preparations were made, they all turned into nothing and came to an abrupt end.</p><p>This was the other shore, and this was the most difficult part of cultivation!</p><p>Seeing the boundary of the netherworld, Meng Qi closed his eyes. Four streaks of red, green, black, and white sword lights appeared in his mind. They flew toward the bright and perfect moon like moths to a flame. They were swallowed by the light and could not stir up any waves.</p><p>“Reporting to old mother, my hollow jade temple has always been protective of the weak!”Meng Qi silently recited these words. He extended his left hand and pulled out the emperor sword with a clang. Light gold glittered, and the way of the king filled the air. Mountains, rivers, the Sun, the Moon, and the stars seemed to form their own heavens.</p><p>Before he opened his eyes, he seemed to hear the faint sound of a zither. The extremely pure and clear sword light appeared in his heart. “All kinds of things in the past”then appeared. There was the sweeping novice who had first met the goose-yellow girl.., there was the frenzied sword who had returned from deep injuries in the sword-washing pavilion. There was the young hero who was tasting the delicacies on his plate. There was also the sigh he had when he saw the cold and elegant girl trying to persuade the priestess of the Doumu..</p><p>More than a hundred years ago, I didn’t have the ability to save you. I Let You Face Death alone. I waited for a long time, but no help came.</p><p>More than a hundred years later, I could finally shout loudly:</p><p>“The reinforcements are here. We will live and die together!”</p><p>He held the hilt of his saber with his right hand and pulled out his absolute saber. Purple light soared into the sky, and lightning struck down. His domineering aura seemed to be corporeal!</p><p>“Third brother, bring my hope to the other shore!”</p><p>Gao Lan’s words reverberated in his heart. The cold and indifferent figure of the emperor seemed to have curled up his thin lips and revealed an expectant smile… Meng Qi opened his eyes, there was a surge of pain, grief, anger, hatred, and madness that couldn’t be erased. It explained the emotions hidden in the depths of his heart and steadied his aura to the extreme.</p><p>“Alright, Imperial Brother. Place your hopes on me today!”</p><p>Mottled spots flowed out of the corners of Meng Qi’s eyes. Just like when he was screaming in pain, he took a step forward and left the nine serenities realm.</p><p>Today, he was openly attacking the other side in order to sever all hesitation and all thoughts. He was going to go all out and fight with his life on the line!</p><p>As soon as his figure left the nine serenities realm, the perfect and flawless moon slowly rose. Old Mother Wu Sheng directly made a move!</p><p>“Demoness, wait for your death!”Meng Qi seemed to have been prepared for this. With a roar, the Overlord Saber and the Human Emperor Sword in his hands soared into the air. The brilliant purple and pale gold intertwined as they faced the bright moon.</p><p>This saber attack advanced without retreat!</p><p>This sword attack was seeking death for survival!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
