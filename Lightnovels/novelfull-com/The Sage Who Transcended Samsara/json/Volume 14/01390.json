He closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, there was a little more heat and excitement.</p><p>The pride in his bones could not defeat the woman in his heart!</p><p>“How should I use it?”Gao Lan tried his best to control his tone, but his voice unconsciously became hoarse and slightly trembled.</p><p>Because it was a moonlight treasure box, he had to say prajna paramita or represent the moon… in the end, Meng Qi did not say anything mean. He nodded slightly and answered, “Just activate the Taoist power.”</p><p>It was fine if he did not urge her. After all, it was a communicator, and what worked was his own power..</p><p>Gao Lan held the moonlight box with both hands and hesitated for a moment. It was not that he did not want to, but he was afraid of her as if he was close to home. After hundreds of years, what should he say when he saw her again? What would her answer be?</p><p>He took a deep breath, and a line of words appeared in his mind:</p><p>“The 27th year of Yongxi, the 16th of June, the 4th of Midnight…”</p><p>This was a date that he would never forget for the rest of his life. This was a date that he would never forget.</p><p>The moonlight treasure box lit up, and its clear splendor was like the moonlight. It shone through the pavilion, making Gao Lan’s figure become indistinct and illusory. Then, he was swallowed up by the surging illusory light.</p><p>..</p><p>The 27th year of Yongxi, the 16th of June, the 4th of midnight. It was a long and torrential rain, with dark clouds pressing down on the city.</p><p>Pa, PA, PA, PA, the Heavenly River poured down, and the rain fell on the ground, splashing up white mist and forming a curtain. The surroundings were pitch black, and the sounds of weapons clanging against each other could be heard constantly. Occasionally, lightning would be triggered, and flames would shoot up into the sky, a sword light illuminated the surrounding area, illuminating the slowly flowing blood on the ground, as well as the corpses and wounded on the ground.</p><p>The elegant and fairy-like woman struggled to hold on, and numerous palm shadows flew out from her hands. It was as if she had a thousand arms, and each of them formed a seal, blocking the sword and saber attacks. Her body was covered in blood, some of which came from others, and some belonged to herself, it was not easy for her to survive this strong attack. However, there were still many enemies looming in the darkness around her.</p><p>“It seems that my dream is going to shatter this place today…”Yan ran sighed in his heart. He had already foreseen his ending. For a moment, he lost the will to fight. There was only one obsession left. To live until he came and see him one last time..</p><p>At this moment, a bolt of lightning was triggered. It struck down from the high sky and lit up the entire city. It Illuminated Yan ran in a daze, as if this was the last brilliance of his life.</p><p>A sword light came out from the darkness and stabbed into her back silently. Yan ran only woke up when she felt a slight pain, but she could no longer dodge it.</p><p>Unfortunately, she could not wait for him..</p><p>Suddenly, the sword light stopped. When the tip of the sword had just entered her skin, the noise and chaotic aura around her strangely disappeared. It was as quiet and peaceful as the night when the moonlight shone on her.</p><p>Yan ran looked up subconsciously and saw a man wearing a royal robe and a flat crown on his head. His majestic body blocked the wind and rain and blocked all the chaos.</p><p>That handsome face was so familiar. The burning and excited eyes seemed to be a dream. There was self-blame, joy and gratitude hidden in them, but there was an indescribable pain and pity.</p><p>Countless emotions surged in Yan Ran’s heart, making her vision blurry. Many words were on the tip of her tongue, but she only said one sentence softly:</p><p>“You seem to have aged more than ten years overnight…”</p><p>The Gao Lan from before was high-spirited and full of vigor. Now, he was mature and reserved, and there was an additional layer of frost between his brows.</p><p>The rims of Gao Lan’s eyes immediately turned red. His lips moved a few times as he said,</p><p>“Yes, we haven’t seen each other for a night. It feels like more than ten years have passed.”</p><p>More than ten years. This was a gaze that came a few hundred years too late!</p><p>He stretched out his right hand and wrapped it around Yan ran’s waist in an overbearing manner. The frozen figures around him exploded with loud bangs, and blood and flesh flew everywhere like fireworks.</p><p>Yan ran was caught off guard. She was both sweet and surprised. Then, she was lifted up by Gao Lan, but she looked down at another Gao Lan. She rushed toward Gao Lan like a madman!</p><p>“Him? You?”Yan ran was shocked and confused.</p><p>“Humph, don’t mind that Idiot!”Gao Lan pointed with his finger, and the cause and effect entered Yan Ran’s heart. With a flash of light, he came to an infinite height and saw the towering palace that had never changed since ancient times, he saw the plaque of “Hollow Jade Temple”that was quietly hanging.</p><p>He held onto Yan ran’s hands, and his eyes were full of heroic tenderness that could drown people’s hearts. He said gently and gently,</p><p>“Wait for me here.”</p><p>Yan ran understood the whole story. She nodded with tears in her eyes and said gently but firmly,</p><p>“I Will!”</p><p>A clear light rose, and Gao Lan’s figure disappeared. A fake Yan ran’s corpse appeared in Changle City. Crazy Gao Lan hugged her and cried crazily, washing changle with blood.</p><p>An ancient glazed lamp shone, and the thread of karma was cut off. The mystical maiden of the nine heavens at the current node had new memories. She sighed softly, and in the hollow jade temple, the bright and clean treasure light was hanging high up in the sky, she was looking into the distance at the highest level of the nine heavens, the Gao Miao emperor.</p><p>Yan ran trembled for a moment, and then calmed down. She turned around to look, and the door of the hollow jade temple had opened without her noticing. It was deep and quiet, giving off the feeling of an ancient Buddha with a green lamp.</p><p>She bowed and slowly walked past the threshold, entering a side hall. In front of her was the statue of the primordial Lord of Heaven, and below the statue was an ancient lamp. The flames flickered, and all sorts of important events in the world were floating around.</p><p>..</p><p>At the current node, Meng Qi reappeared. He was no longer there. Looking Up, he saw the door of the hollow jade temple slowly open, and out walked a haunting figure.</p><p>Yan ran felt something. She lifted her head and looked around. Lightning flashed, and thunder rumbled. It was as if hundreds of years had passed.</p><p>In front of the heavenly venerate throne, there was a solitary lamp. After a hundred years of hard work, this day had finally come!</p><p>..</p><p>The doomsday boat crossed the void and entered the mysterious and Sorrowful Ksitigarbha Pure Land. It stopped at the top of Mount Meru, but Meng Qi did not immediately refine it.</p><p>Although he could speed up time and shorten the long refining process to a few months, days, quarters, or even breaths, he had to wait for an opportunity to use something of this level. Only then could he seize the time and the general situation for his own use, to achieve the desired effect, Meng Qi did not idle while he waited.</p><p>In the new Thrush Manor in the eastern sea immortal realm, the back mountain was as usual. Strange flowers were everywhere, grass huts were secretly built, and a tomb stood quietly.</p><p>Mr. Lu Da was wholeheartedly carving the wooden statue. He was not distracted by the appearance of a celestial venerable with a black robe and an ancient crown in front of him. He did not put down what he was doing until he struck the sword, he smiled at Meng Qi and said, “During the last tide of Brocade Water, I thought of that time again. At that time, who would have thought that the young man I was carving would become a celestial venerable of Haotian Taoism?”</p><p>“One’s life is full of unspeakable fortuitous encounters. At that time, it was all thanks to senior who taught me some life experience.”Meng Qi casually sat cross-legged and looked at fairy Han Bing, who had finally become a dharma body and lived to this day in the Huamei Villa, qu Jiu Niang and the other members of the original celestial miracle who had enjoyed more than a hundred years with longevity-extending pills said softly, “Yan ran has been resurrected.”</p><p>The six paths had long been disbanded, and the reincarnation had already stopped.</p><p>“Is that so…”Mr. Lu da had already seen through the heavenly secrets after a short pause, and he knew that what Meng Qi said was true.</p><p>“Back then, senior rejected the temptation of the demon Buddha and said that he would complete it. Now that the era is coming to an end, do you want to meet your wife again and face that future together that may no longer have a future?”Meng Qi asked with a smile.</p><p>At this point, he could no longer look forward to Mr. Lu da taking another step forward. Time waits for no man. Thus, he began to help his old friends resolve their wishes before calmly facing the arrival of the end of the world.</p><p>Mr. Lu Da’s gaze was gentle as he looked at the grave and said with a smile, “This old man is not pedantic, nor am I a good dragon, Lord Ye. Under the circumstances that do not violate the bottom line of my heart, having such a good thing is really something that I can’t wait for.”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly felt something. He turned his head to look at the small path at the back of the mountain. He saw that there were hundreds of flowers in full bloom. There was a beautiful woman in a palace dress standing there. She smiled faintly, and her eyes were gentle. Everything seemed to be in a dream!</p><p>Mr. Lu da could not help but become infatuated.</p><p>The most gentle smile was that one that lingered in his dreams until now..</p><p>In the past, at the moment Mr. Lu Da’s wife passed away, Meng Qi had brought her to the hollow jade temple. He had given her immortal pills and miraculous medicines, as well as items that could prolong her life. He had also used his Daoist magic to conjure a body that could deceive the heavens and cross the seas, this was to prevent Mr. Lu Da’s cultivation from changing.</p><p>..</p><p>After doing something similar, Meng Qi turned back to look at the ancient times.</p><p>This time, it was his turn. It was time to meet the brand of primordial beginning Celestial Master that he had been trying to escape from!</p><p>Knowing that old mother Wu Sheng’s backup plan was likely to come from the secrets left behind by primordial beginning Celestial Master and Numinous Treasure Celestial Master, it was practically suicide not to explore and touch these things!</p><p>In the mythological era, was the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning only left with the brand to maintain the course of history? What would happen when this reduced and empty product met his brand?</p><p>Would there be a chance to open up the source of time again, to reunite The God Ascension, the journey to the west, and the real world, and return to the original appearance of the river of time, allowing clues to appear about the whereabouts of the two heavenly venerates?</p><p>As for the reincarnation of the Overlord brand, it was best to wait for the next era. There were not many years left for the Apocalypse!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
