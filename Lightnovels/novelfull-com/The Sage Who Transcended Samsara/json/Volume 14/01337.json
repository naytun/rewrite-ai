It stirred up the surrounding space and time, tearing all the monsters, foul qi, black sun, and haze that it passed through into it. It turned everything into darkness and was almost frozen, it lost the feeling of time passing by.</p><p>On a certain level of the nine Netherworld where the Black Heavenly Emperor’s Daoist rite was located, the evil gods that were flying in the sky, the monsters that were rampaging on the ground, and the Yin ghosts that ran amok in the mountain range were all stunned on the spot. It was as if they had turned into statues. It was completely silent, only that sword light that cut across the horizon came from an unknown place and slashed towards the place that was like the God of Heaven Mountain.</p><p>Layers of forbidden techniques rose into the sky like waves of water, bringing with them a sense of scouring as they clashed head-on with the surging sword qi. However, the dark and chaotic sword Qi seemed to be able to contain everything, and time was no exception. One could only see the waves of water curling up, as the layers of forbidden techniques stacked up against the sword qi, they became chaotic, and many whirlpool-like holes appeared on the river.</p><p>With a soft sigh, a palm reached out and absorbed every ray of light. It was as clear and translucent as a black gemstone. With a flick of his finger, he pointed towards the middle section of the Sword Qi. It was just right.</p><p>At the same time, a palm came crashing down, stirring up waves of blood that dyed the entire sky red. It rushed crazily towards the Black Heavenly Emperor’s Daoist rite temple, wanting to erode and eliminate everything. It seemed to contain a hint of boundless chaos.</p><p>“Supreme Pure Source Mystic Dao”Yang Jian also made his move!</p><p>At that moment, it was as if a huge hole had been opened up high up in the sky. Six streams of Sword Qi descended. One of them was yellowish-brown in color and was filled with the desire to die. It contained a little bit of life force. Another beam of crimson light was like blood, intertwining with plunder and erosion. The other beam was like a dream-like illusion.., it was not like reality. It was like the manifestation of the white moonlight at the bottom of everyone’s hearts. The other beam was dark red and near black, filled with a strong desire to kill and fight. It made people shudder when they saw it from afar. They did not dare to face it directly. The other beam was deep and near.., exterminating the heavens, exterminating the earth, exterminating the gods, exterminating the people, exhibiting a great destruction, a great sense of destruction. A pitch-black beam twisted and writhed like a snake. It was demonic and depraved, evil and hazy.</p><p>The six beams of sword qi were slanted and connected to form an array formation. It suffused a supreme demonic intent, as if the Netherworld had taken form and shrunk here. It directly enveloped the sea of blood, stirring up rays of various colors.</p><p>Six Emperors Heaven Abyss Sword, a supreme demonic body great divine ability!</p><p>The demon lord, who had been hiding in the netherworld for many years, struck out with the most powerful strike he had comprehended!</p><p>After more than a hundred years, he had finally used the Netherworld to repair his lost arm and return to his peak state. He had even improved, becoming one of the few false shores in the netherworld. However, the past was mostly in the real world.., it was rather difficult to trace back to the netherworld. At present, it was still far from the time when the world was created. Similar to him, Daoist seven kills was the same.</p><p>At the end of ancient times, the demon lord used his peerless talent to refer to the demon Emperor’s Codex, transforming the divine abilities and martial arts of the evil demons and evil gods from their bloodlines into cultivation techniques. All races could cultivate them, eventually condensing them into a corresponding body of the demon god, just like the “Six exterminating yama body”and the “Netherworld true body”, on the one hand, he wanted to prevent the demon emperor’s claws from eroding and controlling him. On the other hand, he had lofty ambitions, borrowing different treasures to split his body, different parts cultivated different cultivation techniques and formed different fiendcelestial bodies. Finally, they merged into one and obtained the ‘supreme demon body’of the former Demon Emperor. This was a terrifying demon body that could replace the netherworld with one’s own body!</p><p>This demon body also had divine powers and martial arts that came from the bloodline. One of them was the ‘Six Emperors Heaven Abyss Sword’!</p><p>The demon lord had lent a hand to the black heavenly emperor not because he had pledged allegiance to Buddhism, but because of a very simple idea. If he did not lend a hand today and watched as Su Meng and Yang Jian jointly defeated the Black Heavenly Emperor and banished him from the netherworld.., then he would inevitably end up in the same situation in the future. He might not even be spared.</p><p>Nine Chaos Heavenly venerate was in a state of chaos and madness. He could not be relied on. Ghost Emperor Xuanming was being held back by Zhenyuan Zi in Luo Feng and black prison, making it difficult for him to make a move. If the remaining false nirvana could not cooperate, he would only be defeated by the two Jade Void realm experts!</p><p>He had no choice but to help!</p><p>Sword Qi surged as the sea of blood surged. It dyed the illusory river of time red as it peered into the various futures, searching for flaws in the sword array.</p><p>The Demon Lord’s time in the Netherworld was limited. Even if it was difficult to trace back, there was no time for him to be weak. Therefore, Yang Jian began with the “Future.”The Sea of blood seemed to have a spirit, but it also seemed like chaos, unintentionally, it seeped out from the tiny joints between the changes in the sword array, as if it had long known that there would be tiny flaws in those places.</p><p>Dark, red, black, green, yellow, brown, and other sword glows swirled around. The demon lord used all his strength to slow down Yang Jian’s strike. On the other side, a dark light flickered as a sword Qi silently attacked, it slashed straight at Meng Qi.</p><p>Wherever the sword Qi passed, the stars would extinguish, splitting into countless small pieces. The mountains on the ground would wither and turn into desert, devoid of any life. Numerous evil gods and demons would fall to their deaths on the spot.</p><p>The number one sword of the Netherworld Sea!</p><p>Daoist seven kills also harbored the grief of a dead rabbit and a fox. He slashed out from afar to assist the Black Heavenly Emperor.</p><p>Meng Qi stretched out his left hand. His palm was dark as purple lightning danced in the air before finally returning to a point.</p><p>As if he had discussed it with Meng Qi, the sword aura of the dim light drilled into the point of the dim light and stopped moving. However, the dim and chaotic sword aura of Meng Qi was shattered into pieces by the black heavenly emperor and vanished into thin air.</p><p>Meng Qi was neither shocked nor angry. The mud ball on his head suddenly opened, and three figures rushed out. One of them was emitting a ghostly aura, and his skin was pale green. It looked like it was not going to be worn down. The 89 incarnations evolved on their own and obtained the power of the pseudo-nirvana realm!</p><p>The other two were the handsome and carefree novice monk and the cold and prideful swordsman. One of them held the purple lightning dragon-like saber while the other carried the human emperor’s sword that flickered with pale gold on his back, both of them had used peerless divine weapons to obtain the power to resist the pseudo-nirvana realm and the nine underworld realm.</p><p>As for Meng Qi’s original body, it was even more mysterious. It was neither good nor evil. It was a combination of good and evil. The chaotic Qing clouds above his head were shrouded, and the glass lamps on them were bright and clear. The water around them rippled, and he still possessed the power of the pseudo-nirvana realm.</p><p>The three figures dispersed as soon as they appeared. Together with their true bodies, they split up the nine Netherworld four pillars, surrounding the Black Heaven Monarch, unparalleled demon lord, Daoist seven kills, and Yang Jian in the center.</p><p>The swordsman pulled out the sword behind him. Light gold surged like waves, and the power of the Dao of kings suppressed the filth of the Nine Netherworld. It was as if it had drawn out an ocean of vitality on its own. The handsome monk smiled as he flicked the absolute blade in his hand. Purple Lightning Rose and pierced through the clouds first, then, with a boom, he descended, illuminating layers of the void, deducing the Void structure from point to line, from line to surface.</p><p>The ghost emperor transformed from eighty-nine pointed his finger, and dark green light shot out. It did not leak out or dissipate in the slightest, as if matter was highly condensed. Meng Qi’s true body once again formed a sword with his finger, slashing out a sword light that resembled chaos and water ripples, it was fast and slow, and it moved as it pleased. It was more ethereal than the breeze.</p><p>“Su Meng is already so terrifying…”at the sight of this scene, the demon lord and Daoist seven kills felt their hearts turn heavy. Their gazes contracted, and just as they were about to withdraw their sword qi, the four sword beams combined to form the immortal vanquishing sword array, it set off the most terrifying storm of eradication, completely enveloping them. Yang Jian had long expected this, and he transformed with the wind, escaping from this world.</p><p>With two fully awakened nirvana-level existences in his body and the ability to transform into three pure ones in one breath and fight in all-weather terrain, Meng Qi was equivalent to using the immortal vanquishing sword array set up by the four great false Nirvana realms, he was recreating some of the original appearance of the primordial era’s number one killing array!</p><p>He wanted to fight against the three old fellows alone!</p><p>Taking this opportunity, Yang Jian’s figure flashed and he descended on Luo Feng. He pressed down with his palm and a sea of blood surged, drowning the netherworld that flowed towards his vacuum homeworld.</p><p>His and Meng Qi’s true goal was not the black celestial emperor, but to use this opportunity to cut off his mother’s hand that had reached into the netherworld!</p><p>Without knowing the attitude of the unparalleled demon lord and Daoist seven kills, they would first attack the black celestial emperor and temporarily trap them in the immortal vanquishing sword array!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
