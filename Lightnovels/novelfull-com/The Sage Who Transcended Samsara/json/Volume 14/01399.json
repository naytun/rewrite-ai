The mechanism was too clever</p><p>One side of the universe collapsed, like a relief sculpture piled up on a beach. When the huge waves hit, it collapsed almost at the same time, causing the entire real world to turn into a mess. From the beginning of the creation of the world many eras ago.., the river of time curled up.</p><p>The state of convergence and diffusion superimposed, the state of Ultimate Yin and ultimate Yang superimposed, the past and future superimposed, the vigorous vitality superimposed, the silent death superimposed, the timeline completely fell, and the brand all belonged to Gu Xiaosang’s metal emperor and Dao Fruit, the superposition of the soon-to-be-transcended mother wusheng was the wonder of the end. All contradictory things existed at the same time and were all tolerated. They all belonged to a point that was the greatest, the smallest, the most wonderful, and the simplest.</p><p>Amitabha’s figure was both when heaven and earth were created and now that the end of the world had come. However, it suddenly became illusory, as if it was about to break out of the current node and the shackles of logic and imagination, and achieve true transcendence, however, it had been weakened by the six soul banner previously, and it was lacking in mastery. It alternated between illusion and reality a few times, and finally could not completely break free.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang had become an ancient man, and Amitabha’s reduction and emptying had also been completed. He only needed to recover, and he would be able to obtain the dao fruit. However, it was this extremely short recovery that made him slow down a “Step”, and in his line of sight.., the Celestial Master of morality who was entangled with him had completely disappeared!</p><p>This was because Meng Qi had also beheaded the Celestial Master of Su and Meng, and had obtained the embryonic form of the dao fruit. He had become an old man!</p><p>Hadn’t his morality been weakened by the Six Soul Banner? Amitabha put away the incarnation, the incarnation, and the Dharma body in one place. He put his hands together and whispered, “Merciful, Merciful.”</p><p>Then, the Western Paradise flew out and blessed the doomsday boat, helping it to survive the doomsday and lead to the next era.</p><p>In the battle for the Dao Fruit, he failed by a hair’s breadth. He rationally began to think about the “Future”. If there really was a next era, nuwa would be the first dao fruit to compete with him..</p><p>Gu Xiaosang stood in the chaos. The past and present overlapped in the nothingness. His eyes were complicated, but he lacked the pleasure of killing the “Golden Emperor”.</p><p>The Golden Emperor clearly knew that he would suppress his realm after he reached the other shore. He would not break through, and he might even imitate his husband and bear a lot of karma. Therefore, he could only “Force”him to prove the embryonic form of the dao fruit in the most extreme and unimaginable way, after he became an ancient, he reduced and perfected the void. No matter how much he weakened himself, it would not affect him..</p><p>At the end, time overlapped, life and death overlapped, and all kinds of contradictory states overlapped. This was a chance for him to make a big deal out of it..</p><p>From the beginning, he had been planning for this. The real targets of the six souls banner were actually Amitabha and the Celestial Master of morality. The goal was to weaken them, so that they would be one step slower at the critical moment, so that they could seize the opportunity!</p><p>The Buddha had made a move before, so he had to seriously consider the possibility of him making a move again. Moreover, there were three treasures under the Bodhi magical tree. The signs of his collusion with the three pure ones were very obvious!</p><p>Among the ancient people who had hope of achieving the dao fruit, Amitabha and the heavenly venerate of virtue had been “Delayed”by one step. The three pure ones were one. Without the heavenly venerate of virtue, they could not transcend at all. Who else could stop the Golden Emperor from transcending?</p><p>Gu Xiaosang felt a wave of sadness in her heart. She had worked so hard to reach the other shore just to be a stepping stone for the Golden Emperor?</p><p>Could it be that in this life, not only was her fate manipulated by her, she could not even destroy one of her plans?</p><p>Meng Qi felt the same way. The dao fruit that had already taken shape transformed into a clear cloud. Countless golden lanterns hung down, illuminating the darkness. They absorbed the will of the end and chaos around them, thinking of ways to help the three pure ones and stop the Golden Emperor.</p><p>The Gold Emperor relied on the strange state of the end to transcend, so he had to not reveal any of it in front of him. Could there be karma that had not been completely resolved yet? could he find them, magnify them, and slow down the gold emperor?</p><p>Perhaps the gold emperor was seizing the opportunity to completely destroy those insignificant karma?</p><p>Meng Qi was never a person who gave up easily. The green cloud above his head changed, revealing a glass lamp. The karma of all the karma illuminated the current chaotic and crazy world of karma, instantly tracing back to the source, it was as if he had arrived at the beginning of the cause and effect.</p><p>It was dark and bright, and the stars interweaved. A Daoist sat inside and quietly watched Meng Qi’s “Arrival”!</p><p>Before Meng Qi could react, the Daoist who could not be described with words suddenly stood up and said with a smile,</p><p>“I am the primordial beginning.”</p><p>The poor Daoist saw the primordial beginning. He did not expect that his first meeting with the true primordial beginning celestial venerable would be at this time… Meng Qi cupped his fists and said, “Greetings, primordial beginning teacher.”</p><p>There were two figures behind Primordial Lord of Heaven. One of them represented the process of the creation of things, while the other had white hair. It was the celestial lord of morals, but his sense of existence was extremely thin. The three of them were independent, but they seemed to be one, it was just that they were different at different times and in different states.</p><p>Seeing this, Meng Qi’s heart was as clear as a mirror. He immediately smiled and said,</p><p>“Congratulations to the three teachers for obtaining the DAO fruit. You have finally attained transcendence.”</p><p>Yuan shi smiled and said, “It’s also thanks to you that you were able to attain the other shore. Otherwise, everything would have been over.”</p><p>In the end, the one who broke free from the sea of bitterness was still himself. External things could stop him, but they could not help him!</p><p>“What about the Golden Emperor? Why did he fail?”Meng Qi could not hide his confusion.</p><p>Was the matter resolved just like that?</p><p>Daoist Yuan Shi said calmly,</p><p>“He used this method to seek the dao fruit. It was originally a fight to the death. He cut off his path of retreat and chased after that last chance of survival. Once he failed, he would naturally vanish into thin air. There would be no chance for him to come back again.”</p><p>That was the reason… Meng Qi nodded slightly. The metal emperor had “Died first”in exchange for little sang becoming an old man, allowing her to absorb all the imprints and bear all the Karma for her. In the timeline, it was considered a complete fall, the “Later”was used to reduce and perfect the void, and it was qualified to strive for the Dao fruit. In terms of logical sequence, the “Later”thing could not have happened, but now, in the process of the end of the epoch.., all contradictions could be superimposed. Not only could the sequence of timelines be superimposed, but so could the sequence of logical sequence. Once the body “Fell”, there was no possibility of being weakened, and there was no way to reduce it.</p><p>As long as he took this opportunity to obtain the dao fruit, with the unknowable and unspeakable mysteries of the Dao fruit, the previous unreasonable things could be established. If he failed, then this state of logical contradiction superimposed obviously could not last long.., it would eventually return to the ending where the gold emperor had completely fallen.</p><p>However, it clearly seemed that the gold emperor had slowed down the Celestial Master of morals, implicated the three pure ones as a whole, and gained the upper hand. Why was he still unable to seize the opportunity to transcend?</p><p>Daoist Yuanshi smiled and said,</p><p>“He shouldn’t have placed morality on the Six Soul Banner.”</p><p>“The reason why we waited for the end of the epoch to seek the dao fruit is to give you more opportunities to become an ancient. On the other hand, the myriad worlds in the heavens have completely collapsed, and the foundation of existence is in the weakest state. Only then can morality be freed. The gold mother used the six soul banner to weaken morality for a while, making him more damaged and weaker. Isn’t that closer to transcending?”</p><p>“For the sake of learning more and more, for the sake of the DAO, it will be damaged day by day. If it is damaged, it will be damaged again and again, so much so that it will not do anything.”</p><p>“I have told him this truth long ago. Unfortunately, he was blinded by the struggle for the Great Dao and only wanted to weaken his opponent. He did not see it, so he was one step behind in the end.”</p><p>It turned out that the Golden Emperor had used the six soul banner to worship the heavenly venerate of morality, which helped the three pure ones to transcend faster. As for the heavenly venerate of origin and the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure, they were in a strange state. It was difficult for them to make a move, and it was also difficult for them to be affected. It would not be effective.., moreover, the six soul banner was a numinous treasure… Meng Qi suddenly realized and said after a moment of silence, “What if the golden mother saw this and did not write the name of the moral teacher on the Six Soul Banner?”</p><p>The tone of the primordial master did not change. “Then he has a twenty to thirty percent chance to compete with us for the Dao fruit, and only a twenty to thirty percent chance because you have long replaced our brand, and he will do all of this when he is ‘absorbed’by Gu Xiaosang in the end. It will be too rushed and slow.”</p><p>The Gold Emperor probably also knew this, so he took the risk to worship the Moral Celestial Master with the six soul banner… Meng Qi thought for a moment and said, “For gold mother, the best thing is to give up this fight and wait for the next era?”</p><p>“No, he only has this chance,”Yuanshi laughed, “From the moment he controlled Gu Xiaosang’s fate bit by bit and provoked you to make that Slash, he was destined to fight for this chance. Once Gu Xiaosang achieves the other shore, he will definitely suppress himself from making a breakthrough, and you would rather guide fellow Daoists to transcend. With the three of them working together and having the tree of Great Dao, I’m afraid he will not see the next era.”</p><p>“Ever since he manipulated little sang’s fate bit by bit and provoked you to make that Slash, he was destined to fight for this opportunity…”these words echoed in Meng Qi’s heart, and he had an indescribable feeling, the Golden Emperor had made such a terrifying and despairing plan and obtained great success, but in the end, he had restrained himself and could only take this dangerous opportunity.</p><p>The real trap was too clever and had cost his life!</p><p>Thinking of this, Meng Qi sighed and said,</p><p>“It’s a pity… he is the most terrifying and difficult enemy I have ever seen. It’s a pity that I couldn’t defeat him with my own hands.”</p><p>After sighing, he asked again, “Teacher Yuanshi, can only one dao fruit be achieved in one era?”</p><p>The three pure ones were a different matter.</p><p>“Yes.”Yuanshi nodded affirmatively. “Only the complete cycle of an era, from nothing to existence, from prosperity to prosperity, from prosperity to decline, and then from nothing, can make the embryonic form of the dao fruit truly mature.”</p><p>“Then Buddha?”Meng Qi asked doubtfully. It seemed that the DAO Master had truly transcended, even if the consequences of what he left behind were great.</p><p>“He is in the state of a restricted and incomplete dao fruit. He can not be considered to have transcended. Working with us, we hope that after we attain the dao fruit, we can knock him down to this state, free him from the restrictions, and start over again,”Yuanshi said with a smile, “The end has come. It’s time for you to start the next era.”</p><p>As he spoke, the three pure ones had already disappeared, as if they had never appeared before. In front of Meng Qi was the rapidly shrinking nothingness, and it was Gu Xiaosang, who was in a daze.</p><p>“The Golden Mother is dead, and the three pure ones have attained dao,”Meng Qi said simply, calling back Gu Xiaosang’s spirit. Then, he pointed with his finger and merged all the remnants of the vacuum hometown and Netherworld into the doomsday boat, he transferred all the living creatures that were still alive into the boat.</p><p>The faint golden light flourished, and golden lotuses bloomed. The doomsday boat was enveloped by endless nothingness and was squeezed by the terrifying shrinking.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang sighed lightly. She didn’t know whether it was the joy of being freed or the disappointment of falling into an empty space. She joined hands with Meng Qi and pulled out the damaged fusang ancient tree. They refined it into the ship and flew back together, they saw demon saint, Green Emperor, Bodhi ancient Buddha, and so on.</p><p>Inside the ship, all the living beings were shivering. Han Guang mingled among them and was at ease.</p><p>Suddenly, his face twisted, and the life force in his eyes faded and reappeared, revealing a dignified expression.</p><p>The universe did not exist, and the doomsday ship was sailing in the endless “Nothingness”, enduring the assimilation of chaos and the invasion of all kinds of terminations.</p><p>At this moment, a Buddha with extremely pure light and a dark red distorted monster flew over. They wanted to enter the doomsday ship, but Meng Qi waved it gently, releasing a water curtain-like light in front of the eaves, blocking them.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>The Supreme True Buddha and the Heavenly Dao monster screamed and fell into the void, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, the doomsday boat was covered in wounds and finally survived the end. Meng Qi stood on the bow of the boat, holding the hilt of the absolute saber and transforming his nascent dao fruit into an ancient and boundless banner of Pangu, he combined it with the overbearing saber that was surrounded by purple lightning.</p><p>The creation of Heaven and Earth was now!</p><p>The Saber slashed out, splitting the darkness apart, but it quickly collapsed and was about to condense again. It seemed that there would be no next era. At this time, the Green Tree of Great Dao flew out from the clear and round light behind Meng Qi’s head and supported itself in the gap, the light flickered, and the branches and leaves grew.</p><p>In the doomsday boat, countless creatures suddenly felt the real light, the natural light, and the boundless light. Then, they heard a solemn declaration:</p><p>“If I respect the heaven and earth, then everything in the world has a glimmer of hope!”</p><p>PS: Tomorrow, I will start updating my wechat public account.
