It seemed to shrink the entire real world to within an inch, with an unstoppable momentum, it slapped toward the Wuji apricot yellow flag that was barely holding on. The tip of the white and beautiful fingers that followed were cold and dark, as if the call of death had finally arrived.</p><p>Under the situation where the other important figures were entangled with each other, there was no force in this world that could slow them down in the slightest!</p><p>When the two shores joined hands, everything was set in stone!</p><p>In the Pure Land of the Buddhist kingdom that spanned billions of tribulations, the burning lamp that was about to make a move came to an abrupt end. It was both surprised and delighted:</p><p>“No wonder the Devil Buddha is so sure!”</p><p>“I didn’t expect him to have this trick hidden, to be able to directly control the monster of the Heavenly Dao!”</p><p>He couldn’t care less about how Ah Nan or thunder god could do such a thing. His astonishment faded away, and he was replaced with joy. He repeated the words of the Devil Buddha in a low voice:</p><p>“Su Meng, You’re Dead!”</p><p>..</p><p>In the Netherworld, Gu Xiaosang had sensed this with the help of her subtle connection with the monster of Heavenly Dao. Although she remained calm and didn’t lose her composure, her face was shockingly white.</p><p>After all her calculations, she had missed out on the fact that the Devil Buddha had such a backup plan!</p><p>She had once taken the risk to test whether the monster of Heavenly Dao was a puppet on the other side like the emperor. After confirming that there was no other interference, she decided to set up this plan.</p><p>She did not expect the devil Buddha to hide so deeply. During the Middle Ages, due to several reincarnations, it was difficult to completely let go and gradually fell into depravity. When it was constantly weak, the Overlord broke away from its control and directly threatened the original body, he had never used the power of the monster of Heavenly Dao, which made people believe that he had no other tricks up his sleeves. When he reversed the Tathagata and ascended to the devil throne, his own power was enough, and he could not use the monster of Heavenly Dao for the time being.</p><p>And the ancient thunder pool was the remnant of the ancient path. What happened in it was difficult to know even on the other side. The overlord being able to refine it into an absolute blade was more or less suspicious, however, they all guessed that the Devil Buddha had some residual power in the place where he was born, and he used his own divine body as a guide to imitate the former Heavenly Killer Taoist. That was how he was lucky enough to succeed, but who knew that it contained such a secret!</p><p>At that time, Ananda might not have been stronger than the current him, so how did he manage to completely control the monster of the Heavenly Dao?</p><p>These doubts lingered in Gu Xiaosang’s mind for a while and then disappeared, because they were of no help to the current situation.</p><p>The good situation just now suddenly turned into a dead end!</p><p>The Monster Emperor wanted to see the Devil Buddha who had already escaped. Who else could stop mother Wusheng and the Monster of Heavenly Dao?</p><p>Even if the celestial emperor, who was still alive, made a move, how could he stop the two on the other side?</p><p>When he was at his peak, he was indeed stronger than mother Wusheng, but he was not strong enough to be weaker than mother Wusheng!</p><p>He had always planned the big picture with Mother Wusheng as his target. Although he had guessed that the Devil Buddha would not do nothing and would probably escape early, and he had asked his husband to ask the monster emperor to look after him personally, he had still neglected her, she had not been promoted to a position that was as important as the gold emperor.</p><p>A son lost, and everything went wrong.</p><p>At this point, the situation was no longer under his control.</p><p>Should they expect the illusory heavenly venerate of primordial beginning or heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure to intervene?</p><p>Or the even more unfathomable dao venerate and Buddha?</p><p>..</p><p>On the three clouds island, in the Hollow Jade Temple, in the Elysium Realm, all the great divine arts practitioners in the destiny realm were either happy or sad apart from their common shock.</p><p>It was not that heavenly venerate Wen Shu did not have the courage to fly into the fire, but there was no hope at all in front of them. All the remaining great divine arts practitioners could not even block a single finger of the Golden Emperor.</p><p>In such a situation, one would not even have the thought of risking their lives!</p><p>The deepest and deepest despair!</p><p>Inside Jade Emperor Mountain, the sparkling long saber flickered for a moment before finally returning to peace.</p><p>..</p><p>Seeing that he was about to go back to the time when he was born, Meng Qi suddenly felt as if he had fallen into an ice cave. Cold, darkness, and silence — that was the most intuitive feeling of death!</p><p>His consciousness had been worn out by time, leaving only the courage and courage to cut off everything in his way. His temperament had been polished like the sharpest knife and the sharpest sword. Stimulated by this, not only did he not hesitate.., instead, he seemed to have been forced out of his potential and completely abandoned everything else.</p><p>At the current node, the ‘heaven-cleaving fruit’that was hidden in the Purple Qi suddenly trembled. Meng Qi’s figure that was in the past suddenly turned into a saber light. Who else could it be? The incandescent saber light that was indomitable, the saber light that split open the heaven and earth and rebuilt the universe!</p><p>The saber light flashed and cut through the long river, penetrating into the beginning of Meng Qi’s birth. Moreover, it did not go as far as this. It broke through the waves and came to the Middle Ages. It was the ‘historical landmark’that connected to the era of the Overlord. The resonance with time became more and more intense, it allowed the two illusory dao fruits to be close to taking shape. The spiritual light of their nature rose again. The reverse also brought about an increase in the speed of backtracking to the past. It had already merged with ‘Meng Qi’s figure’, who was looking up at the falling heavenly court.</p><p>The other shore was already in sight!</p><p>However, it was already too late. The dark red and brutal giant hand slapped down, and billions of golden lotuses fell apart, and the yellow flag of Wuji Apricot fell into the netherworld!</p><p>“Su Meng is finished…”the ancient Buddha with the burning lamp could not hide the smile on his face.</p><p>The Devil Buddha Ah Nan looked at the Monster Emperor Palace in a teasing manner, and looked at the Black Golden Spear with Phoenix Wings that had all five virtues. He was calm and composed, and he had a plan in mind.</p><p>In the Hollow Jade Temple, Wen Shu, the Celestial Master Guangfa, sighed faintly. He felt endless loneliness and bitterness.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang looked up at this scene, and her mind was full of thoughts. She even thought of transforming into a monster of the Heavenly Dao to weaken the Golden Emperor. However, what was the use of that?</p><p>One by one, the powerful people in the destiny realm watched the dark red palm reach into the river of time, stirring up waves of ripples. They were all deeply moved.</p><p>Another martyr had appeared on the other shore’s path.</p><p>When would this sea of bitterness end?</p><p>The giant dark red palm slapped towards Meng Qi’s two illusory dao fruits that were about to take shape. The chaos had eroded the past a step earlier.</p><p>All the Great Powers, great divine arts practitioners, and even the great personages on the other shore could already see the end. It was likely that the future would be like this!</p><p>But right at this moment, terrifying waves were stirred up at the current node of the illusory river. Many brand-new tributaries forcefully rushed out!</p><p>The dark red ferocious giant palm inexplicably stopped in place. It was only a split second away from Meng Qi’s illusory dao fruit, and at the end of it was a pure white and beautiful finger!</p><p>It was so extraordinary, so refined.</p><p>The finger of the Gold Emperor!</p><p>The Gold Emperor’s finger, which was supposed to stop Meng Qi from charging to the other shore, actually quietly changed its direction and subdued the Heavenly Dao monster!</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>There was a loud bang on the peak of Mount Numinous, and countless dark lightning bolts burst out. The Devil Buddha could no longer maintain its leisurely appearance. It suddenly stood up and looked at the bright and vast moon in astonishment. It instantly understood something, and black shadows flew around its body, it gritted its teeth and shouted,</p><p>“Golden Mother!”</p><p>The demon Saint Spear was triggered, and the thirty-three golden exquisite pagodas pressed down. Together with the bright light of the Monster Emperor Palace, it forcibly trapped the devil Buddha on the spot.</p><p>“What?”Such a turn of events made burning lamp feel like he was in a dream, and he blurted out the words.</p><p>The Gold Emperor, who had the most determined heart to kill Su Meng and the most irreconcilable grudges between them, actually blocked the monster of Heavenly Dao, leaving Su Meng No Way Out!</p><p>Was he crazy?</p><p>Was there any justice in this?</p><p>Wen Shu, the heavenly venerate Guangfa, stood up from the Futon. His expression kept changing, but he couldn’t find the slightest bit of belief. It was as if what he was seeing was just an illusion, a mental demon born from too much despair.</p><p>All the powerful people stared at this scene with their mouths Agape. They had no reaction at all.</p><p>This… a chill emerged from Gu Xiaosang’s heart and spread throughout her body.</p><p>The bigwigs on the other shore looked at the new branch of the future and understood most of the story.</p><p>At this time, on the Golden Bridge of the other shore that connected the thirty-three heavens and the real world, another old man riding a bull came. His white hair was gray, and his aura was obscure.</p><p>The Golden Bridge’s light rose sharply and stopped the “Void”created by the three sariras. Amitabha could not escape.</p><p>The Celestial Master of Morals did not hold back anymore!</p><p>..</p><p>He pointed at the Heavenly Dao monster and the dark chaos immediately swallowed it. The Bright Moon expanded and pushed the dark red vortexes to a corner. It was much more powerful than before.</p><p>In the Bodhi Pure Land, a sigh came out:</p><p>“Embryonic form of dao fruit…”</p><p>Embryonic form of Dao Fruit!</p><p>The Gold Emperor had actually formed the embryonic form of Dao Fruit!</p><p>In the Bright Moon, four sword lights of red, green, black, and white rushed out. The intent of the end of slaughter and destruction was vast and mighty. They were inserted into the four poles of the Jade Emperor Mountain, trapping the saber of time in the center.</p><p>Soon after, an ancient formation diagram flew out from the bright moon. Red, green, black, and White joined together to form a dao pattern and fell into the center of the four immortal slaying swords.</p><p>Immortal slaying formation diagram!</p><p>This formation diagram was actually in the hands of the gold emperor!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The world was vast. The number one killing formation in the immemorial era completely sealed the saber of time!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Lu Ya was dumbstruck when he heard a low voice at the same time:</p><p>“The Gold Emperor is the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure…”</p><p>He turned his head to look and saw that Han Guang, who had always been leisurely and complacent, was ashen-faced. Even if he knew that the heavenly emperor was not dead and that there would be a terrifying enemy in the future, he still seemed to be confident.</p><p>In the Netherworld, Gu Xiaosang looked at this scene in a daze. Her starry eyes suddenly flashed with a strong self-deprecation:</p><p>I should have thought of it long ago..</p><p>The symbol of the beginning, the limitless seal, not only cultivated the will of chaos, it actually had a final end, the end of everything..</p><p>What the metal emperor obtained was not only the orthodoxy of the primordial Lord of Heaven..</p><p>After cultivating the limitless seal and reaching the other shore, he was only one step away from the embryonic form of the dao fruit. In addition to the final outcome of the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure, it was not surprising that he had achieved this realm..</p><p>The Qingping Sword suddenly flew away, leaving behind a glimmer of hope..</p><p>After the Thunder God sealed the highest level of the ninth heaven, he entered the Peach Garden of immortality and put down the demonic blood peach without breaking the restriction. The most direct way was to pass through the Jade Lake!</p><p>No wonder his actions were always slow, leaving us a chance..</p><p>In that case, there was definitely no such thing as me being strong, and he would become weak and incomplete. The ripples of the “Bright moon”back then were just an illusion created by the gold emperor.</p><p>In other words, if I’m not the DAO Mark of the gold emperor, then who am I?</p><p>All these years of struggle and pain, was it just a joke?</p><p>Was heaven’s will really so difficult to ask?</p><p>At this time, a seemingly indifferent and mocking voice came from the bright and clear moon. It said to Meng Qi in the river of time,</p><p>“Don’t worry, how could I kill myself to be the product of reducing and seeking emptiness?”</p><p>Before he finished his words, a terrifying wind and waves were stirred up in the river of time. Meng Qi’s figure did not stop. He rushed past Yin Shang, the soup-like Yin Shang, the initial Golden Crow, the Six Heavenly Ancestor Dragon, and the beginning of the creation of the world.</p><p>Not only that, with a flash of his saber, he split open the void and stepped into the chaos between the two epochs!</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The world lost its light, and even the black and white had been lost. The abnormal phenomenon on the other side was “The chaos of the world”!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
