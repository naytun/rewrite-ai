Red light soared into the sky, and smoke filled the air, blocking out the light. Huge waves surged in every part of the sea, rolling up one whirlpool after another. In the depths of the starry sky.., numerous stars suddenly exploded, blossoming with incomparable brilliance. The premonition of the end of the world appeared in front of the world just like that, allowing the immortals and deities to “Hear”the footsteps of the end of the era.</p><p>The birth and death of Dao was something that even the bigwigs on the other side could not stop. They could only slow down the general trend, which was destined to happen in the future!</p><p>In the original territory of the Great Zhou, in the land of Buddha, which had merged with the characteristics of the hometown of vacuum, all the living beings chanted even more devoutly. Fear turned into faith, and they wanted to rely on Holy Mother White Lotus, the savior of the world, to survive the end of the world.</p><p>In the Jade Void Palace of Kunlun’s field, Meng Qi threw out the three treasures ruyi and the Higan golden bridge to suppress all these changes, temporarily isolating the nine underworld and the real world. His gaze pierced through the layers of barriers and saw the slightly smiling demon Buddha, he looked at the future tributaries of the river of time.</p><p>This was really the future of the evil devil.</p><p>He looked away as if nothing had happened. He looked like he was still sitting in the clear Jade Palace, but he had already communicated with the brand. He went to the past and returned to the calm before the fall of the Heavenly Court.</p><p>Because of the Devil Buddha’s actions just now, he remembered one thing. It was the strange death of Zhu Bajie, the marshal of the canopy great country.</p><p>He had sensed in advance that there would be a great disaster in the heavenly court. It was difficult to resolve and difficult to resist. Therefore, he swept up the resources and wrapped up the money, trying to escape from the Heavenly River with Gao Cuilan and hide back in Gao Laozhuang. Who knew that he would be ambushed halfway and die with a grievance, the words “I don’t know anything”reverberated.</p><p>Initially, he thought that it was Zhu Bajie’s immediate superior, the Nine Heavens Thunder God, who had killed him to cover up the betrayal of the Heavenly Emperor. This speculation was also tacitly accepted by Devil Buddha. However, after careful consideration, he discovered that something was wrong, as a creator, the thunder god could easily turn Zhu Bajie into ashes. It was impossible for his corpse to be left on the star!</p><p>Back then, he could not investigate the clues and verify his guess. Now, he could directly descend to the scene and witness it with his own eyes!</p><p>The water of the heavenly river seemed illusory and unreal. It was dark and boundless, as if the layers of the universe were superimposed on each other. Each of them was shining brightly, like sparkling waves. If one approached them, they would discover that they were all stars and Suns, either huge or huge.., they were of different sizes, and their colors were different.</p><p>A waterway extended from the pond. At the bottom of it was a hidden and ancient copper door. Meng Qi stood in the distance with his hands behind his back. His black robe was deep, and his ancient crown was vast. He quietly watched the changes of the copper door, all the harmful things in the surroundings passed through his body, but they did not cause any effect.</p><p>The copper door slowly opened. Without a sound, four Pegasus with long white fur pulled a golden carriage out. The body of the carriage was written with the words “Heavenly River Navy”. The driver was a big, Fat Man with a pig’s mouth, he was covered in layers of golden armor, and his eyes were rolling around, showing a bit of panic and fear, especially so. The whole process did not have any ripples, as if he was used to being a thief.</p><p>At this moment, a fair and beautiful palm stretched out from the carriage behind him, and suddenly pressed on his back!</p><p>Countless silver-white flying, as if there was a silent explosion of divine thunder. The pig-mouth man instinctively showed his heavenly body, but he could not resist it. The smell of burning spread, and he flew out and landed around a nearby star. His eyes were wide open as he stared at the carriage, he was filled with disbelief, shock, and anger.</p><p>“You know too much…”a low and ethereal voice came from within the carriage.</p><p>Then, without even opening the carriage door, a beautiful and graceful woman walked out. Lightning flashed in her palm, turning into a whip that lashed out at the huge and fat pig body outside the star. Without the slightest hesitation, her killing intent was very strong.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Broken spikes appeared on the nine-toothed rake. A terrified scream echoed in the blazing light and blazing flames:</p><p>“I don’t know anything!”</p><p>The pig’s corpse landed on the surface of the star and lost all its vitality. It burned with sizzling sounds and the smell of barbecue filled the air.</p><p>The beautiful and graceful woman closed the copper door again and strode forward, swimming in the Heavenly River. Meng Qi walked behind her with his hands behind his back. No matter how she changed directions and hid her aura, she could not escape, and she did not sense it at all.</p><p>After a while, the woman escaped the Heavenly River and returned to the western travel world, entering a rather prosperous manor.</p><p>“Gao Cuilan!”</p><p>As expected, it was Gao Cuilan… Meng Qi nodded slightly and stood on the mountain outside the manor. He looked at the illusory flowing river of time and saw the changes that followed:</p><p>Including Gao Cuilan, all the living beings in this place were soon massacred during the demon riot. None of them were spared, and Gao Cuilan no longer displayed the strength to kill the canopy marshal. It was as if thunder god had used her body to attack, it was because of this restriction that Zhu Bajie’s corpse did not turn into ashes.</p><p>After watching the entire process, Meng Qi raised his feet and returned to the past. He planned to directly change history and save Zhu Bajie to see what he knew!</p><p>The water of the Heavenly River swayed, illusory and dark. He appeared in front of the copper door and sat cross-legged in the air, waiting for things to happen.</p><p>Zhu Bajie swept up all the precious things in the Navy camp. He pulled his wife, Gao Cuilan, through a secret passage and entered the secret place at the bottom of the pond. On one side, he summoned four extraordinary Pegasus and put them on the carriage, on the other side, he let Gao Cuilan enter the carriage to avoid being hurt during the journey of the Heavenly River.</p><p>“This time, when we return to Gao Lao Zhuang, we will live on our own and no longer care about the matters of the Heavenly Court!”He said to Gao Cuilan in panic, “Even if the monster race is powerful and dominates the world later, I am still a pig demon. What is there to be afraid of? If it was not to leave a way out, why would I keep up this appearance!”</p><p>As he spoke, he closed the carriage door and sat in the driver’s seat. He waved his hand and opened the copper door to the Heavenly River.</p><p>Silently, the copper door slowly opened. The illusory water of the Heavenly River was reflected in Zhu Bajie’s eyes.</p><p>Suddenly, his gaze froze. He saw a dark-robed Daoist sitting cross-legged at the door. His face was young and handsome. He wore an ancient crown on his head. His aura was extremely deep, as if it contained all things and all possibilities, it was the beginning of everything, the earliest reason for the layers of connections!</p><p>This… Zhu Bajie’s heart jumped, but he soon realized that it was somewhat familiar. With his identity, he naturally had to participate in the various feasts held by the Heavenly Emperor and the meeting of the peach of immortality held by the Queen Mother of the west, he also had the opportunity to meet those ancient heavenly venerates a few times, the true rulers of the universe!</p><p>The Daoist in front of him gave him the feeling of..</p><p>No, it was not like, it was him!</p><p>In an instant, Zhu Bajie’s entire body was hot but cold sweat was breaking out. He was so terrified that he could not speak. He had directly bumped into the leader of the big figures on the other shore, the first among the nine of the Dao sect’s heavenly venerates, the primordial beginning heavenly venerate!</p><p>After the Battle of ascension to godhood, the primordial Lord of Heaven had rarely appeared in front of people!</p><p>In his fear and trepidation, he hurriedly saluted. He could bend and stretch:</p><p>“Greetings, Celestial Lord. I wonder if there are any orders for your presence?”</p><p>Meng Qi glanced at the carriage. Suddenly, there were bursts of lightning in the carriage. It was silvery white and looked like fireworks that had exploded.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Zhu Bajie’s eyes suddenly showed fear and lingering fear. Since when did the thunder god Tamper with Cuilan?</p><p>Luckily, he had met the primordial Lord of Heaven!</p><p>At this moment, the void above the carriage split open, and a huge hand surrounded by black and red mist extended out. It was very close to Zhu Bajie, and it slammed toward him as if it was swatting a fly.</p><p>RULAI flipped his palm, and the Devil Buddha attacked. It controlled time and erased all traces!</p><p>Meng Qi was already prepared. Purple Lightning flashed in front of him, and it was brilliant and domineering as it forcefully cut through the red and black mist. At the same time, the clear air above his head rushed out and transformed into a green and blue glazed Buddha. He smiled, and his thumb and middle finger touched each other, it was like picking a flower. It gently swept out, bringing about an epiphany in the soul and the stagnation of the spiritual light in his nature.</p><p>However, this finger did not point towards the Devil Buddha. Instead, it swept towards the Heavenly River beside him. The water flow there suddenly surged and was dyed dark red. It became crazy and chaotic.</p><p>True rulai against the monster of the Heavenly Dao!</p><p>Seeing that Meng Qi had withstood the attack of the Devil Buddha and was about to raise his sleeves and take Zhu Bajie away, the pig-mouthed man’s body suddenly became illusory. He lost the foundation of his existence and turned into little bubbles.</p><p>Meng Qi narrowed his eyes and looked over. Following the river of time, he saw the shadow of marshal canopy in history disappear at the same time until he left Mount Numinous and returned to the heavenly court.</p><p>Outside Mount Numinous, Zhu Bajie, who was the emissary of the altar of purification, turned around and bowed to the residence of Buddha. He did not dare to be negligent.</p><p>At this moment, his heart palpitated. The six-foot-long golden body of Buddha appeared in front of him. His mouth was wide open, revealing forty Buddha Teeth. He looked like the most terrifying monster.</p><p>Then, Zhu Bajie lost all his senses and returned to the only “Pure dharma body”.</p><p>Meng Qi met the gaze of the Supreme True Buddha and saw a vengeful smile on his face. He wiped the corner of his mouth.</p><p>The emissary of the pure altar was also one of the Bodhisattvas and arhats. He belonged to the target of assimilation!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
