His essence, Qi, spirit, and all his thoughts were focused on the other side of the world, as if he was possessed by Mr. Lu Da.</p><p>Only by reaching the other side of the world as soon as possible could he change the situation. There was no other way!</p><p>Dao Yi’s glass lamp stood in the void, illuminating the heavens. On each side, there was an illusory dao fruit that was slowly taking shape. Some were dark and chaotic, while others were purple and hidden in white. It was the current node for Meng Qi, supporting his spiritual light to not fall into the sea of bitterness, he was half immersed in the river of time.</p><p>With this, Meng Qi was connected to the first “Historical landmark”that he had left behind. It was himself, who had planted the inner demon for the tower lord of the heartless building in the 37th year of tianle!</p><p>His figure floated as he flew toward the landmark. The water of time around him was no longer illusory. It became solid and viscous, preventing him from going back.</p><p>His thoughts dispersed bit by bit, but there was only an indelible sharpness in Meng Qi’s heart. He was determined to the extreme. Even if he had forgotten everything, he still maintained the speed and release to advance toward the “Landmark”, fast and determined!</p><p>This process was one of the difficulties on the other side. If there was even the slightest hesitation, the slightest lack of confidence, and the slightest bit of hope, he would leave the river of time and dissolve into the vast sea of bitterness. He would completely vanish into thin air, and there would be no possibility of resurrection, just like the Black Emperor back then!</p><p>..</p><p>Inside the hollow jade temple, Meng Qi sat upright on a futon. Nearby were Guang Chengzi, Celestial Master Guang Fa of Wen Shu, Chi Jingzi, Immortal Master Yu Ding, Immortal Master Dao Xing, Nezha, and Xiao Tianquan, they were discussing who should take the position of sect master temporarily.</p><p>“The position of sect master doesn’t have any benefits. At least until we reach the other shore, the hollow jade temple can’t be fully controlled.”Guang Chengzi stood up with a smile and bowed to Meng Qi:</p><p>“Greetings, sect master Su.”</p><p>Meng Qi’s body suddenly trembled. The long river around him surged. Some understanding flashed in his eyes, and a warm smile appeared on his face.</p><p>Senior brothers, long time no see!</p><p>..</p><p>West Mountain Buddhist temple, under the Bodhi tree.</p><p>Wang Siyuan mixed snow bud, Bamboo Lord, Longhu Peak, iron flower tea, hidden dragon tea, and other famous teas together. He used a mixed smell to remind Meng Qi and taught him that “All things in the past, vanish into thin air”could only be obtained from the Overlord Blade, the rest was all fake.</p><p>Meng Qi slowly stood up, and asked with a slightly complicated expression, “Why did you teach me these?”</p><p>The chess piece in Wang Siyuan’s hand suddenly slid down and smashed onto the chessboard. It flew everywhere and messed up the chess game just now.</p><p>His face was hidden in the shadow of the Bodhi Tree, and his tone was erratic as he said,</p><p>“Helping you to break the game is helping me to break the game.”</p><p>Meng Qi’s gaze swept over and suddenly heard the sound of a river surging in the distant horizon. His body inexplicably trembled, and a hint of realization appeared in his eyes.</p><p>He turned his head back and looked at Wang Siyuan. The corners of his lips curled up as he muttered to himself:</p><p>“Fraud, I wanted to beat you up every time I saw you in the past. Now, I want to say that I’m definitely going to befriend you!”</p><p>..</p><p>The night was foggy. The two “Drunkards”were holding wine jars and roaring an unknown tune called “Laughter in the vast sea”as they wandered in the Quiet Alley.</p><p>Gao Lan’s eyes were still clear and bright as he staggered forward. He looked at Meng Qi with a smile filled with interest as he knocked on someone else’s door.</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The figure startled the neighbors. The owner of the courtyard put on his clothes and shouted loudly,</p><p>“Who? What’s the matter?”</p><p>“Buy, Buy a rooster, and, and, there’s yellow paper,”Meng Qi answered vaguely.</p><p>The owner of the yard was stunned, and then he flew into a rage:</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>“Where the hell did this drunkard come from!”</p><p>Where did he get a rooster?</p><p>Bang, Bang, Bang!</p><p>Meng Qi did not doubt it. He went to the next yard and was splashed with cold water. He was still drunk, but he persevered and knocked on the door. Someone wanted to come out and beat him up, but when he saw the corpses on the ground at the end of the alley, he was so scared that he closed the doors and windows, he did not dare to make a sound.</p><p>In the end, the neighbors could not bear the disturbance. Someone threw a rooster out, and someone spilled yellow paper.</p><p>They had just done all this when they saw the silver accurately thrown into their hands. They were at a loss.</p><p>Was this… was this a drunkard?</p><p>Meng Qi held the rooster and Gao Lan held the yellow paper and wine jar. The two returned to the original abandoned courtyard. They lit the weeds, burned the yellow paper, cut off the head of the rooster, and sprinkled the blood into the wine.</p><p>“Come, after sacrificing the heaven and earth and drinking the blood wine, we are sworn brothers. I am definitely older than you. I am the eldest brother, and you are the second brother.”Gao Lan laughed boldly.</p><p>Meng Qi was drunk. His eyes were blurry, and he stuttered, “No, I can’t. The Second Brother Thing, the second brother thing, it’s too, too f * cking ugly. I want to be the third brother. I, I want to be the third brother!”</p><p>“Heh, interesting.”Gao Lan laughed. “Let’s do it!”</p><p>He pulled Meng Qi down on his knees and said to the spot where the yellow paper had been burned:</p><p>“Come, let’s bow to the heavens. Let’s become Sworn Brothers!”</p><p>At this moment, the night seemed to be moving. The sound of flowing water could be heard faintly. Gao Lan didn’t notice it at all, but Meng Qi suddenly trembled. The drunkenness in his eyes instantly faded. The light in his eyes was restrained, as if there was another world hidden in the darkness.</p><p>He looked at Gao Lan beside him, and his eyes were filled with enlightenment and sadness. Then, he turned his head and kowtowed heavily.</p><p>Imperial brother, I am willing to kowtow!</p><p>..</p><p>In Yuexiu restaurant, Ruan Yushu and Meng Qi had killed Gao Tong. They relaxed, and the dishes they had ordered were placed in front of them.</p><p>Raising his chopsticks, Meng Qi enjoyed the delicious food. At the same time, he noticed that Ruan Yushu was only watching and did not eat.</p><p>“Eat. It’s my treat,”he said with a smile.</p><p>Ruan Yushu nodded slightly. With his elegant and graceful movements and the speed of a whirlwind, he swept up the entire table of dishes. Meng Qi was dumbfounded when he saw this. He could not believe that a girl with a cold temperament would behave like this.</p><p>Ruan Yushu’s face was slightly red, as if he was in the mood. He raised his head and said, “You treat me to food. I, I have never been very polite.”</p><p>Meng Qi almost laughed out loud. Suddenly, he saw an illusory long river in his eyes. The water was sparkling and flowing quietly, and a figure was moving against the current, rapidly approaching. Only when he was in front of the figure did he realize that it was him!</p><p>The two figures suddenly overlapped. Meng Qi’s gaze became gentle as he thought to himself,</p><p>“You don’t have to be polite. I will invite you often.”</p><p>..</p><p>The Cold Moon Hung High in the sky, its brilliance shining on the river. Silver and white danced together, and the water rippled.</p><p>The sound of the flute was melodious and melodious, as if it was crying and complaining. A small boat sailed out of the darkness. A young girl in white stood at the bow of the boat. She was exquisite and indescribable. Her temperament was ethereal, and her clothes fluttered in the wind. She was so beautiful that she looked like a celestial being, she pressed her hands on a green jade flute. Her pink lips were close to the mouth of the flute, and she blew out a mournful sound.</p><p>Meng Qi’s expression changed. He drew his knife and held his sword. He took an offensive posture, restrained his state of mind, and said calmly, “Miss Xiao Sang, how have you been?”</p><p>Gu Xiao Sang’s pink lips left Xiao Guan. She looked at Meng Qi with her starry eyes that seemed to be filled with resentment. “Husband, you’re here, but you don’t want to meet me. How can I Be Safe?”</p><p>Husband… Every time he met her, he would call her by her name… Meng Qi’s face twitched. Suddenly, he felt that he was surrounded by a river that flowed endlessly. He felt as if he had passed away.</p><p>His eyes suddenly had a hint of a smile and tenderness. He answered in a low voice,</p><p>“Yes, My Lady.”</p><p>My lady… Gu Xiaosang’s expression seemed to be frozen on her face.</p><p>..</p><p>Inside the Shaolin Temple, in the Zen heart courtyard, Meng Qi’s chest was held by a longsword wrapped in a heavy copper-green scabbard. He managed to maintain his balance. In front of him was a bright and beautiful young girl with an oval face, big eyes and dark eyebrows. Her black hair was simply tied up, she wore a light yellow dress that was gently draped over her shoulders.</p><p>She burst out laughing. “You’re more like a young master of an aristocratic family than a small monk. You should be addressed as a female benefactor.”</p><p>Then, she turned the long sword around and returned the bow. “Yes, my name is Jiang Zhiwei. I’m a disciple of the sword washing pavilion. I’m really sorry for involving you in the fight between us.”</p><p>Just as Meng Qi was about to speak, he felt the light and shadows around him fade away. They sparkled as if they had sunk into the deep sea.</p><p>He saw a pair of eyes and saw himself. His eyes suddenly flashed with enlightenment. He quietly looked at the girl opposite him and sighed to himself:</p><p>“You said that I don’t look like a little monk, but you called me a little monk for the rest of my life…”</p><p>..</p><p>Meng Qi sat on the FUTON and watched as Xuan Ku held the ruler and asked the layman’s name of a child and the reason for entering Shaolin.</p><p>The child was a little over ten years old. His lips were red and his teeth were white. He was handsome and he answered stiffly, “My name is Fang ah-qi. I was sold to a monk because I didn’t have enough to eat.”</p><p>Meng Qi almost burst into laughter, but an illusory river suddenly appeared in his eyes. He seemed to have had an epiphany.</p><p>He stopped smiling and looked at Fang ah-qi. Looking at his true wisdom in the future, many of his worries disappeared completely. He sighed in his heart:</p><p>“Little junior brother, I didn’t expect you to be like this, Yang Jian…”</p><p>..</p><p>Without the interference of the gold emperor, Meng Qi’s figure traveled back in time. With the help of the influence of the other universes in the real world, he traveled back in time to the parts that involved him, waking up the past and connecting to his own body.</p><p>This speed was extremely fast. He was about to arrive at the beginning of his birth!</p><p>In the Pure Land of the Buddhist kingdom that spanned billions of tribulations, burning lamp was stunned to see the situation turn for the worse. The Golden Emperor was temporarily entangled by the Heavenly Dao monster, and no one could stop Su Meng. A thought flashed through his mind, and he quickly made a decision, he saw the ancient glazed lamp fly out from the back of his head.</p><p>At this point, it was time to stake the foundation of both sides’Fortunes!</p><p>He would definitely do his best and not hesitate anymore!</p><p>In the Western Paradise World, the unfettered kings and Buddhas also put their palms together. Bodhisattvas and other Buddhists and Luoism’s fortunes were ready to be unleashed!</p><p>Not only did they have the numbers of those who had reached perfection in fortunes, but even those who had great supernatural powers in fortunes, the alliance between Buddhism and Luoism was stronger than the Azure Emperor, Yuxu, and morals. The demons would not interfere too deeply, just like the attitude of the demon emperor.., it All depended on what the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure would choose!</p><p>..</p><p>On the three clouds island, the forbidden spell flew up, carrying some of the aftershocks. Yun Xiao looked up at the sky and suddenly sighed:</p><p>“We can be resurrected. Thanks to Su Meng’s gift, let’s end this karma today.”</p><p>Bi Xiao and Qiong Xiao both smiled, expressing their agreement.</p><p>..</p><p>In the Hollow Jade Temple, celestial venerate Wen Shu Guangfa had long known about San Xiao’s character and did not doubt their actions. At this moment, she could not hide her excitement because the situation was starting to develop in a good direction. If this continued for a while.., junior brother Su would have the chance to reach the other side of the Dao!</p><p>Maitreya was still hesitating whether he should use this opportunity to reach the DAO. He had his own way to stop burning lamp. The world’s unfettered King Buddha had the nine spirits primordial saint to act. On the other hand, Bodhi ancient Buddha was obviously holding back. It seemed that Zhenti Daoist and black heavenly emperor would not join the battle, under such circumstances, there was no other blessed realm to intervene. As long as San Xiao made a move and set up the nine twists Yellow River Formation, it would be meaningless no matter how many blessings the Buddhism and Luoism combined. They would be able to trap as many as they wanted!</p><p>It all depended on the attitude of the heavenly venerate of treasures..</p><p>..</p><p>Just as Meng Qi was about to return to his infant state, and just as burning lamp and other good fortune were about to make their move, a dark red light suddenly appeared in the eyes of the demon Buddha, Ananda, who was on the peak of the spiritual mountain.</p><p>It was as chaotic and crazy as the dark red light of a monster of the Heavenly Dao!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>With a loud sound in the sky, the irregular dark red vortex suddenly disintegrated and turned into a terrifying giant hand. It actually abandoned the golden emperor and turned around to slap Meng Qi!</p><p>The Devil Buddha could actually control the monster of the Heavenly Dao, and it was as if it could control it with its arm. It was definitely not the barely-able influence of Wang Siyuan, Gu Xiaosang, and the others!</p><p>Seeing this change, the gold emperor did not hesitate at all and pointed his fair and beautiful finger at Meng Qi again.</p><p>Seeing this scene, the Devil Buddha revealed a cruel and happy smile:</p><p>Since ancient times, the East Emperor Taiyi, which was also the monster of the Heavenly Dao, had been under my control. It acted according to my will, and only when it was suppressed by the Buddha did it not dare to drive it, in case the gap was too big and it suffered a backlash.</p><p>Decades ago, I had quietly escaped, but I had never activated this hidden hand. I had been waiting for this day!</p><p>Wang Siyuan, Gu Xiaosang, how could your plans be hidden from me?</p><p>If it wasn’t like this, how would su Meng Dare to leave the Netherworld?</p><p>Didn’t you think that after reaching the other shore, I would be afraid of karma at the level of several saints, so I let the Wang family go. I let you go because you have always been my chess pieces, the puppets of the monster of the Heavenly Dao!</p><p>Without the Heavenly Dao Monsters’help in the dark, did you think that the Overlord would be able to refine the absolute blade? Would I be able to leave a mark?</p><p>Now that both mother Wusheng and the Heavenly Dao monsters were attacking at the same time, let’s see how you can resolve this!</p><p>The Devil Buddha’s gaze was deep, revealing a hint of malevolence:</p><p>Meng Qi, you’re dead!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
