They were quite surprised to see Meng Qi descending directly. As important figures on the other side of the river, even if he could be everywhere, he should still maintain a high and mighty manner, why did he have to come here in the nine dragons agarwood carriage like before?</p><p>They did not dare to think too much and bowed with complicated expressions:</p><p>“The first master invites the celestial to enter.”</p><p>Not long ago, they had addressed each other as fellow disciples. Now that the other party was a celestial, no matter how polite they were, they could not afford to be the slightest bit disrespectful.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly and said, “Thank you for your trouble, Senior Brothers.”</p><p>“Yes, Celestial.”The golden-horned boy and the silver-horned boy turned around and led Meng Qi inside. They passed through numerous halls and pavilions and came to a quiet room that was decorated with an alchemy furnace. The Flames at the bottom looked ordinary, but there was no heat emitted from it at all.</p><p>The Old Man in Daoist robes with a white beard sat cross-legged in front of the alchemy furnace. His eyes were half-open and half-closed, and his head would nod gently from time to time, as if he was in a deep sleep.</p><p>When he saw the Celestial Master of morals, Meng Qi suddenly had a subtle feeling. Compared to the last time they met, his sense of existence was weaker. It was the influence of the end of the epoch, and also a kind of transcendence that was close to perfection!</p><p>At this moment, the Celestial Master of morals slowly opened his mouth:</p><p>“What is inaction?”</p><p>“Inaction is not inaction. When the heavens respond, the teacher will naturally follow. Following the Dao, it is inaction. Those who do not do it have the Dao in their bodies. When the general trend coincides, it is always advantageous.”</p><p>The golden-horned boy and the silver-horned boy by the door were confused. They did not understand why the old master was talking about “Inaction.”What did this have to do with the purpose of the sect master of the Hollow Jade Temple, Su Meng?</p><p>Shouldn’t they be discussing the struggle for the other shore?</p><p>At this moment, they saw Meng Qi clapping his hands and smiling. “Junior is relieved to hear your words, martial uncle.”</p><p>He cupped his hands and turned to walk out of the alchemy room, leaving behind the golden-horned and silver-horned boys who were staring at each other.</p><p>Outside Tuoshuai Palace, the white clouds were like waterfalls, and the spiritual springs were flowing. Meng Qi was in a good mood as he admired the exotic flowers and plants that could only be seen in ancient times.</p><p>Previously, for the matter of little sang, he had worked together with Amitabha, secretly communicated with the Azure Emperor, and assisted Maitreya. In the eyes of senior Uncle Dao De, this matter did not matter, so he did not make any arrangements or make any chess pieces, however, in the end, he played a game with Amitabha, but after he swallowed the Medicine Master King Buddha and used the great divine ability of one Qi to transform the three pure ones into true rulai.., it was equivalent to inheriting the fruit of one of the three pure ones that senior Uncle Dao De had transformed into and helping him complete a crucial task of reducing and seeking emptiness. When ‘heavenly venerate Su Meng’and ‘true venerate Qingyuan’struck out one by one, he would become the weak shore.., at that time, he would be both the original heavenly venerate and the heavenly venerate dao de.</p><p>In other words, senior Uncle Dao De had done nothing in the entire matter, not even giving any hints. He had only managed to block Amitabha in the end, but he had obtained the greatest benefit and was one step ahead of Amitabha. In this process.., all the other shores were entangled in the matter of Maitreya’s attainment of the Dao, and there was no hindrance at all, that was why he said, “Doing nothing is not doing nothing. If one follows the heavens, he will learn from nature. If one follows the DAO, he will be doing nothing. If one does nothing, he will have the Dao in his body. When the general trend is aligned, he will be successful in everything!”</p><p>Compared to him, the Golden Emperor, who controlled the layout to the point of despair and made people feel cold to the bone, seemed much more petty.</p><p>“As expected of the oldest person on the other side.”Meng Qi could not help but sigh inwardly.</p><p>Under the premise that the origin and numinous treasure did not appear and Amitabha was left behind by a small step, the heavenly venerate of morals was indeed the oldest person on the other side.</p><p>He walked into the chaos and looked down at the lower realm. In his eyes, the illusory river of time, which had always come and gone, appeared as he looked at the fall of the Heavenly Court.</p><p>In that period of history, there was still a figure that belonged to him.</p><p>Two hundred and thirty-four thousand seven hundred and sixty-six years ago, on the second day of the second month, at 2.30 pm, on the peak of Jade Emperor Mountain, Meng Qi wore a dark Daoist robe and an ancient jade crown. He stood with his hands behind his back, quietly watching the heavens collapse and the stars fall like rain, a ball of burning fire suddenly fell. All the destructive and residual waves naturally dissipated when they reached his side, as if nothing had happened.</p><p>The fireball fell rapidly. It was a towering palace that was wrapped in layers of deep flames. Within it stood a distorted and indistinct figure of an emperor, as if it was filled with the past, present, and future.</p><p>Seeing that the fireball was about to fall near Jade Emperor Mountain and destroy this piece of land into ashes, turning it into nothingness, the corpse-like figure of the emperor raised an ancient seal. It was like the epitome of the nine heavens, it was also like the condensation of the universe. It was the embodiment of Dao and the source of order.</p><p>Without a sound, waves of light rose up. It was like a vast ocean that engulfed the emperor, the ancient seal, and the towering palace. The sparkling illusory tide was like a little flame, burning something and refining something.</p><p>The fireball hit the ground as if nothing was there. It directly drilled into a certain area of Jade Emperor Mountain. It did not cause destruction, but it changed part of the terrain.</p><p>Meng Qi put his hands behind his back and looked down from above. He saw through all the obstructions and saw the blade of time floating in the remaining palace. Then, he felt waves of extremely powerful will sweeping over and withdrawing.</p><p>This was the mark left behind by the people on the other side who had destroyed the heaven. They did not find anything wrong with the heavenly emperor refining the blade of time with his own Dharma Body Dao fruit, the core of the Heaven, and the Heavenly Dao Seal.</p><p>It was also because of this that they did not allow each other to take the time blade away. They watched the long blade together for all eternity to prevent any changes and “Wait”for the return of the Heavenly Emperor.</p><p>As soon as the time blade was refined, it was at the level of the other side. All kinds of things in the past had become imprints, so they could not interrupt the refining process.</p><p>At this moment, the time blade floating in the remaining palace suddenly changed. The floating light surged and contracted. First, it showed the appearance of the Fu Emperor, and then it quickly changed into the towering emperor that he had seen just now. His body was ethereal, it was as if he had crossed the universe, the past, and the future. His face was blurry, but his majesty was clear.</p><p>The returning Heavenly Emperor appeared here!</p><p>“I didn’t expect you to dare to appear directly, fellow Daoist.”Meng Qi was not surprised and smiled calmly.</p><p>The Heavenly Emperor’s voice was enough to be described as grand. He said calmly, “The present is different from the past. Without the lure of the dao fruit, how could the ancient people work together again? In the other situations, what do I have to fear?”</p><p>Even if he could not win, he could still escape with his life!</p><p>“It’s better to meet him than to hear his name. Fellow Daoist, you are indeed worthy of being the supreme one who has dominated the world.”Meng Qi nodded with a smile. “Fellow Daoist, why did you come to see me?”</p><p>“I just want to remind you that the thunder god of the past and the Devil Buddha of the present are not simple. Even I can not see all of his details. Although you have surpassed him today, you must not be careless and underestimate your enemy,”the Heavenly Emperor said slowly.</p><p>Seeing that he was also very wary of the Devil Buddha, Meng Qi nodded and said, “How can I be careless when it is a problem in my heart? I wonder if you have anything else to say about the fall of the Heavenly Court?”</p><p>“You should know what you should know. Jianmu is about to have its results, which will help in transcending. I hid this matter and used it to improve myself. However, it was pierced by the Thunder God and attracted the collaboration of the ancient elders.”The Heavenly Emperor suddenly laughed, it was a bit sarcastic and desolate. “After they ‘killed’me, they said ‘no foreign objects’to the fruit of Jianmu and turned around to leave.”</p><p>It was like someone who was trapped in his home by a few gangsters. He resisted with his life but was killed. Before he died, he sensed that they were searching for something and finally said, “I killed the wrong person”..</p><p>What a grievance and irony!</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, you were able to avoid their gaze and live until now secretly. I’m afraid it’s because of the inspiration from the reincarnation seal, right?”Meng Qi did not continue the heavenly emperor’s topic and asked instead.</p><p>Regarding this, he was still puzzled before, but when he saw the heavenly emperor’s appearance, he basically understood what was going on.</p><p>“Yes, after the reincarnation seal, this thing came to my hands. It made me realize that its spirituality is different from the spirituality of the other nirvana divine weapons. It has the characteristics of the back Earth itself.”Since he had successfully returned.., the Heavenly Emperor did not hide anything. “With this, after a long period of fumbling, I finally created a technique that could fuse my own spiritual light, illusory dao fruit, and the spirituality of the divine weapons into one. Then, I would have a chance to separate them again.”</p><p>“In other words, all along, the time blade has been the heavenly emperor, and the Heavenly Emperor is the time blade. No wonder it was able to hide from the Nirvana divine weapons. No wonder it needed the body of an emperor.”Meng Qi nodded slightly, “This kind of fusion is definitely not something that can be done in a rush. It seems that fellow Daoist has long fused the spirituality of the Heavenly Dao seal with the body. At the crucial moment, it was completely completed through refinement.”</p><p>If it was not for the body of Emperor Fu, the demon master might not have been able to escape the calamity. However, if that happened, the heavenly emperor who returned would have a very long period of weakness. After all, Han Guang could only be blessed with good fortune.</p><p>“These are minor details. As for the other preparations, they are all a feint,”the Heavenly Emperor said indifferently, “The battle for the dao fruit is exceptionally cruel. Don’t think that you can definitely avoid it just because you cut off your own path. What happened to me back then can be verified.”</p><p>As he spoke, his figure swayed, turning into waves of light and disappearing.</p><p>Meng Qi stood by the side of the Jade Emperor Mountain and sighed lightly. There were cultivators who came to check on him because of the fireball. They saw his figure become illusory bit by bit, as if he had completely disappeared from the world, that feeling was like the tyrannical wills that had swept through this place previously.</p><p>“Another important figure hiding behind the scenes of this era?”They looked at each other in shock and bewilderment.</p><p>After they calmed down, they each did their own thing and left what they saw today in the ancient records, passing it on to the later generations.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
