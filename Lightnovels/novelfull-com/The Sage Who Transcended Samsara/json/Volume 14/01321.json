Numerous dao patterns scattered and gathered, converging and dispersing. They were like bright stars condensing into a Milky Way, stirring up the surface of the water and stirring up ripples, bringing about an ancient desolation and time that was like a blade.</p><p>Meng Qi’s mind was immersed in it, comprehending the comprehension and grasp of time by Donghuang Taiyi, making up for his own shortcomings in this aspect. After all, the ‘Celestial Eradication Sword Scripture’focused on the end, while the limitless seal focused on the curling of time, there was no past and no future. The two were different from the normal way of time. Although there were three thousand great daos, and each path led to the same destination, at the very least, it was not very helpful to look back at the past and peep into the future before the good fortune was completed.</p><p>Donghuang used time as the foundation of his Dao, and Little Peach was part of his dao fruit regarding this dao. Even if the changes and mysteries induced by a trace of aura were still shallow, it was enough for Meng Qi to digest for a long time and benefit a lot!</p><p>Gu Xiaosang, who was watching from the side, also closed her starry eyes and used her mind to sense. She felt that there was a wide, sparkling river with no end in sight. Sometimes it was fast, sometimes it was slow. There were no mottled mottles, and it did not appear vigorous, it was displaying the different flavors of time.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Meng Qi opened his eyes. His eyes were old and ancient, and there seemed to be an endless stream of light flowing slowly in the depths of his eyes. Little Peach, who was drunk, was already sound asleep, as if she had used up a lot of energy, the ancient bronze bell formed from the remnants of Donghuang’s flesh and blood inside the absolute blade shook wildly, emitting light chimes one after another. It brought about the chaos of time and the erosion of time, and it almost broke free from the restraint and suppression of the Purple Blade Shadow.</p><p>Meng Qi did not expect the reaction to be so intense… seeing this, Meng Qi gave up on the idea of drawing out more aura and establishing a connection to stimulate blood peach in exchange for more opportunities for comprehension, on one hand, little peach had to adapt to the many problems brought about by the discovery of the hidden power. On the other hand, the remaining flesh and blood of Donghuang had been deeply stimulated. Adding fuel to the fire, it would be very easy to make it go completely mad, through this, he could break through the seal of the absolute blade.</p><p>Anyway, it would take some time to digest the gains… he thought as he looked at Gu Xiaosang with a smile:</p><p>“Donghuang’s remaining flesh and blood have been suppressed by the absolute blade, and his spirituality has been restrained. We can now enter the ‘Myriad realms of the heavens’to temper ourselves.”</p><p>After he roughly understood Donghuang’s current state of disintegration, he was no longer afraid of mentioning his name, just like he was afraid of Fu Huang.</p><p>“US?”Gu Xiaosang asked with a faint smile, as if there were countless bright stars hidden in his eyes.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly. “This piece of flesh has not lost its vitality. There must be a remnant of the spirit of Donghuang hidden in the depths. Under the current situation of being suppressed, there is a limit to the power he can mobilize. If he can find it, there is quite a bit of hope to get rid of it. This way, he will have complete control over this piece of flesh on the other side and will no longer be a threat. Therefore, I have to go in.”</p><p>No matter what, he had to think of a way to get the absolute blade out of its restraints and wake up completely. In short, he would never give up!</p><p>Of course, without the remaining spirit of Donghuang, the vitality of this piece of flesh would gradually fade away, and the “Myriad worlds”within would also rapidly move towards the end of the world. However, the time before that was enough for little sang to temper herself.</p><p>“More importantly,”Meng Qi continued, “Donghuang has existed in the primordial age for countless eras. He has experienced the confrontation with Haotian God, the ending of being killed, the resurrection of the monster, watching and even mixing with many things from the ancient mythological era, and has a secret connection with the Devil Buddha that was suppressed in Mount Lingshan. All of these may have left corresponding traces in the ‘myriad worlds’in his body, and it is very likely that he has some memories in his remaining spirit. If I can gain something in this regard, it will help me to grasp the details of the Devil Buddha.”</p><p>“Only by knowing the past can you live a better life in the present.”</p><p>Perhaps he could even use this to probe the will of heaven and resolve the great calamity that Emperor Qing had mentioned!</p><p>Gu Xiaosang did not comment on this, instead, she smiled and said, “This piece of flesh is extremely violent and violent. It’s very crazy and very strange. It’s very different from the Donghuang that I know of. Perhaps something went wrong after merging with that monster. The evil side has completely gained the upper hand and has even devoured the rationality and goodwill. I’m afraid the situation in the ‘Myriad realms of the heavens’inside is not as good as people think.”</p><p>“The evil side?”Meng Qi asked thoughtfully.</p><p>“It’s similar to the evil projection of the core of chaos, the dark mother, and other important figures that you mentioned before.”Gu Xiaosang stood up slowly. White lotuses flew around, and the surroundings became ethereal.</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly understood. He pondered for a moment and said, “No matter what, you have to go in and try. Besides, it’s only you. It’s more dangerous.”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang pursed her lips and smiled. “The big shot on the other side is not a dao fruit. He has not truly attained the Dao. No matter how perfect the ‘Myriad realms of the heavens’in his body is, there will not be a place to approach the DAO. The creatures inside will at most be at the peak of perfection. This is still the best case scenario. This piece of flesh is only a part of the East Emperor. Although it may be able to evolve back to its original state, it is still a remnant. The ‘Myriad realms of the heavens’inside is only a part of the original. In addition, the absolute saber has sealed and suppressed it. There is danger, but it is not a narrow escape.”</p><p>At this point, she smiled and said, “If there is no danger, how can we train ourselves?”</p><p>“Good.”Meng Qi clapped his hands and smiled. His soul consciousness returned to his Niwan. His body suddenly shrank and he threw himself into the absolute saber once again.</p><p>The boundless sea of lightning occupied every corner. Lightning surrounded him, making him look like a god. In the depths of the sea, there was a purple saber shadow firmly pressing down on the ancient bronze bell. The lightning kept exploding and rolling along the surface of the bell, colorful lights were stirred up. It was a brilliant scene. One could vaguely see layers of lightning patterns forming a net.</p><p>Yuan Shi Qing Yun rushed out from above Meng Qi’s head. A dim light hung down, decorated with golden lanterns and jade chains. He carefully passed through the net of lightning patterns laid out by the purple shadow of the blade and turned into a dim light that crashed into the ancient bronze bell.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>The sound of the bell reverberated, as if it could shake the three realms. Meng Qi froze on the spot as if he was frozen in the depths of time. If Qing Yun had not canceled it out and the blade light fell, he would have been almost penetrated by a drop of blood and flesh into his body.</p><p>How could the heaven and earth in the body of the other shore be entered just like that?</p><p>However, this was not a problem for Meng Qi. He sensed the change and simulated a bit of Donghuang’s aura. Then, he drew a trace of aura from Little Peach and transformed it into a blurred dao fruit, making it appear as if it was real!</p><p>He moved forward again, and the pitch-black surface of the flesh and blood rippled like water, allowing him to pass through!</p><p>In an instant, Meng Qi seemed to have experienced endless changes in space and time. He passed through layers and layers of Great Dao barriers and arrived at a place completely different from the real world.</p><p>It was dark all around him. It was almost impossible to feel the passage of time. It was more like chaos than the nothingness at the highest level of the immortal world. If Meng Qi had not been dispelled, he would have felt that the darkness had split into different directions, in the depths of each place, there were many terrifying and innate auras, as well as two cold and hostile gazes staring at him. He really thought that he had stepped into pure chaos.</p><p>“Everything ends, turning into chaos, and giving birth to life…”at this moment, Gu Xiaosang’s voice rang in Meng Qi’s ears, “Donghuang has gone through a calamity, and he has been resurrected and returned. He has also been suppressed for many years. It is imaginable that the myriad worlds in his body have been shattered, and he has turned into a state that is similar to chaos, concealing his life force and maintaining his spirituality. This is what he should do.”</p><p>Meng Qi vaguely understood what Gu Xiaosang meant. He asked in puzzlement, “This world is similar to chaos, and it is difficult to tell the location and time. How do we find the remnant spirituality of Donghuang?”</p><p>“It is hard to say for others, but with you here, isn’t it simple?”Gu Xiaosang laughed softly. “We can just open up the world again!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
