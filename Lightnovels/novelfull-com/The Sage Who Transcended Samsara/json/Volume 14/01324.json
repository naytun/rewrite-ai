Given Xiao Sang’s relationship with mother, she would never make a mistake in sensing such things.</p><p>Mother Wu Sheng, who was also the former Gold Emperor, had really returned to the world!</p><p>A real big shot from the other side had returned!</p><p>In his previous discussion with little sang, Meng Qi had already made preparations for the big shots from the other side to return from the chaos earlier than expected through various means, viewing this as the biggest possibility of his doom, that was why he had taken the risk of targeting the remaining flesh and blood of the East Emperor. However, he had never expected that the gold emperor would return so quickly and so early. It had not been long since Emperor Qing had reminded him, and he had already passed through the vast chaos and returned to the long river of time, there was almost no room for him to plan!</p><p>It was too fast! It was so fast that he could not cover his ears. He had just begun to prepare, and the distance between him and the time limit was more than 108,000 miles?</p><p>However, how could everything in the world wait for you to finish preparing? Not to mention that this was a robbery?</p><p>The raging waves subsided in an instant. Meng Qi got rid of all kinds of unnecessary emotions, and the first thought that popped up in his mind was only one:</p><p>Run! Run! Run immediately!</p><p>However, where could he run to?</p><p>Hide in the origin with the help of the wheel of life and death in the heavens? Hide in the highest level of the Netherworld in the immortal world by relying on the causal connection left behind in the Dark? One thought after another burst out, but they were all mercilessly rejected by Meng Qi. What was the point of hiding in these places? This time, he was not facing a false shore.., his past in the real world would be exposed in front of mother wusheng, pale and helpless. With a casual wave of her hand, she could erase his past self, and the “Present”would be reduced to ashes. It would be useless no matter where he hid!</p><p>It was not until now that Meng Qi deeply felt the despair of being enemies with a person on the other shore. It was the darkness that could not see the dawn at all. It was a fate that no matter how hard he tried, it would be futile.</p><p>Only the person on the other side could resist the person on the other side!</p><p>..</p><p>Clang!</p><p>In the Imperial Palace of Changle, the Emperor Sword that was hanging on Gao Lan’s waist suddenly let out a light cry. It bloomed with a faint golden light and condensed into mountains, rivers, sun, Moon, stars, Heaven and Earth. The will of the king had become tangible, it was as if it had been stimulated by an inexplicable aura.</p><p>“Someone on the other side has returned?”Gao Lan, who had always been calm and collected, raised his chin slightly. His thin lips were pursed tightly, and his eyes revealed obvious astonishment.</p><p>Due to Han Guang’s existence, the human sovereign sword still needed more than ten years to fully awaken and reveal the power of the divine weapon of the other side.</p><p>..</p><p>Crash!</p><p>In the pavilion of the mysterious sky sect, waves surged around the blade of time, as if it had merged into a long river.</p><p>When the other side returned, the corresponding things would have their own senses!</p><p>..</p><p>In the depths of the Netherworld, the pure and holy white lotus petals bloomed, completely tainting this world. The vengeful souls and evil spirits lost their obsession, their viciousness, and even their yin energy. It was as if they had been reborn and returned to their hometowns, their faces were filled with joy, and their expressions were calm. As many as the stars in the universe, they all kowtowed in unison, roaring like a tsunami:</p><p>“Welcome back, mother!”</p><p>Standing on top of it, mother Wusheng seemed to be covered by endless space and time. She could only see the ancient and elegant, complicated and light-hearted clothes, and her pair of eyes that contained all the beauty and all the possibilities.</p><p>A clear light surrounded her, condensing into a full moon-like treasure light. Countless tiny white lotuses floated down with her, and each White Lotus gave birth to a god, a god that represented different Great Dao and different laws. She did not take a step forward, he had already appeared in the grand and pitch-black hall in the deepest part of hell, appearing behind Zhenyuan Zi.</p><p>At that moment, the flawless treasure light behind him suddenly trembled, as if it had gone from the moon to the waning moon. It changed a few times before it returned to normal, delaying a full two to three breaths of time.</p><p>Then Zhenyuan Zi heard his old mother’s holy and ethereal whisper:</p><p>“She has indeed been resurrected.”</p><p>The stronger the previous SAINTESS was, the more affected his old mother was… This thought inexplicably appeared in the bottom of Zhenyuan Zi’s heart, and then he felt the subtle changes of layers of chaotic space-time.</p><p>His old mother had made her move!</p><p>..</p><p>Hanging in the Jiuhua Mountain outside Qingming, Guangcheng Zi was doing breathing exercises and exploring the path to the other shore.</p><p>Suddenly, a divine and familiar female voice rang in his ears:</p><p>“I hereby decree that Su Meng does not know when to advance or retreat. He has gone against me time and time again. I, mindful of the heavenly venerate’s legacy, have always retreated and endured, repaying the karma. I have never killed anyone. However, today, he still protects me from my path to Dao. This is intolerable and must be severely punished. If you dare to interfere, don’t blame me for being merciless and killing you without teaching you!”</p><p>Mother Wusheng… Guang Chengzi opened his eyes in shock, as if a wisp of Purple Qi was expanding and contracting.</p><p>At the same time, Wen Shu, Celestial Master Guangfa, Chi Jingzi, Reverend Yu Ding, Immortal Dao Xing, Nezha, and the other great divine arts practitioners of the hollow jade lineage all heard mother Wusheng’s announcement. They were all shocked, bewildered, and terrified.</p><p>..</p><p>Only those on the other side could fight against those on the other side!</p><p>As this thought flashed through Meng Qi’s mind, he already knew where he should run to. That was the other side’s Daoist Rite Temple, which would protect him!</p><p>Among the friendly people on the other side, Primordial Lord of Heaven had gone missing for many years. The Hollow Jade Temple had no owner and was not a place to hide. No one knew if he would make a move this time. They could not pin their hopes on this. Mother Wusheng was a great benefactor to the green emperor who had achieved the Dao, although the Green Emperor would definitely save his life after entering the Fusang Ancient Tree realm, it was only limited to this. He would not stop mother Wu Sheng from doing other things to him, such as inspecting his body and finding little sang, for example, taking away the absolute saber, sealing and suppressing him, making him unable to cultivate again, or forcing him to swear the heaviest karmic oath so that he would not become his enemy in the future, so as to eliminate all possible hidden dangers.</p><p>What was the difference between living like this and dying?</p><p>Therefore, he only had one place to go, the Dou Shuai palace beyond the thirty-third heaven!</p><p>At this moment, a voice fell from the heavy sky and drilled into his ears, echoing the words of the silver-horned boy:</p><p>“Junior brother Su, something bad has happened. Amitabha has blocked the door of Dou Shuai Palace and is fighting with the great master. Ancient Bodhi Buddha has also sent a quasi-lift Daoist into the monster Emperor Palace. You have to find another way out!”</p><p>“Oh right, mother Wusheng has also returned. Although I don’t know what has happened and she hasn’t made a move yet, it’s not up to you to make a decision as soon as possible!”</p><p>Hearing this, Meng Qi felt that the world was vast and vast, but there was no place for him to stay.</p><p>At this moment, Gu Xiaosang, who was hiding in the absolute saber, smiled sweetly. The shock and fear in her eyes disappeared completely, she said calmly, “Husband, if mother comes, you can hand me over. You have hope of crossing over to the other side. It’s not too late to go back in time and resurrect me. If I die, there will be nothing left.”</p><p>Meng Qi’s divine sense entered and looked deeply at her. He suddenly laughed:</p><p>“You didn’t hear what the silver-horned boy said, so you don’t know the current situation. Mother came back early because she made an exchange with Amitabha and Bodhi ancient Buddha and temporarily formed an alliance with them. You are an obstacle to his path of Dao, and I am a thorn in the ancient Buddha’s flesh. No one can escape. You Won’t be able to escape death just by handing you over.”</p><p>Even if the heavenly lord of primordial beginning made a move, he would most likely be stopped by the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure. The others would either be suppressed or in a bad state, and most of them were his enemies. He probably couldn’t count on them.</p><p>He could only rely on himself now!</p><p>Meng Qi’s eyes revealed a resolute expression, just like when he slashed at the Devil Buddha with his saber and sword.</p><p>There was really no chance of survival on this path.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
