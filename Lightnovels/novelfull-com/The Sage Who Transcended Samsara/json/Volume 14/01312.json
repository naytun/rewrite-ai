Have you seen the real Donghuang Taiyi? who did he incarnate into?”The existence at the core of the seal heard Wang Siyuan’s words, a monstrous roar suddenly erupted, as if it had penetrated the boundary formed by the nine tokens and the Luo book, ringing directly in Wang Siyuan’s heart, shaking every single thought of his, bringing with it a lingering shadow and fear, it was as if the spiritual light of his nature would dissipate at any moment and he would turn into a walking corpse.</p><p>Wang Siyuan had layers of protection, but due to the fact that he was not yet a legend, he felt his mind buzzing and chaos welling up. His face had turned deathly pale, as if the dead were better than the living, but his eyes seemed to be burning with raging flames, abnormally Bright.</p><p>He coughed violently, as if he was going to cough out the inner scenery Wonderland of the true body of the Yi Dao, after a long while, he chuckled softly and said, “In the primordial era, Donghuang controlled time and controlled mystery. How can I know everything? It was only by chance that I managed to get a glimpse of it.”</p><p>It was unknown whether it was Donghuang Taiyi or the existence of the founder of Zhexiu Mountain, she qin, who was roaring in a low voice:</p><p>“Then, why did you come to this place?”</p><p>Wang Siyuan straightened his slightly bent back due to the coughing. His figure stood alone, but his face was filled with madness:</p><p>“I have a way to transfer the remnants of Donghuang’s Tai Yi’s will and flesh from your body. I can bear it with my own body and help you return to normal!”</p><p>“What did you say? Aren’t you afraid of becoming a monster like me?”Shechen asked excitedly, his mind seemed to have some confusion and madness again. “With your realm and strength, you won’t be able to bear it at all. I’m afraid that you’ll become Donghuang’s clone on the spot!”</p><p>Wang Siyuan immediately laughed out loud:</p><p>“If you don’t hear about it, how can you get the Tiger’s Cub if you don’t enter the Tiger’s Den?”</p><p>“If I don’t do such an intense thing, I won’t be able to see any signs of life in the upcoming calamity, let alone the end of the era that will definitely come.”</p><p>“So, if I advance, I’ll die. If I retreat, I’ll die. Why not give it a try?”</p><p>His madness was revealed, and the terrifying monster, he qin, was rendered speechless for a long time.</p><p>..</p><p>The Eastern Emperor Tai Yi didn’t really fall? Meng Qi was quite shocked, but he had a subtle feeling that he had expected.</p><p>After experiencing so many things, he had touched upon many mysterious, wild, and evil remnants of the primordial era, and in his hands was a demonic blood peach that seemed to be part of the Dao Fruit of the Eastern Emperor Tai, he had long suspected that this supreme emperor who had traversed through the primordial era might not have truly fallen.</p><p>The great figure on the other shore was almost immortal. He could trace back to the past and possess the future. It went against common sense and logic. How could he really fall so easily?</p><p>“Senior, why did you see me?”Meng Qi asked, keeping the matter of the demonic blood peach to the bottom of his heart.</p><p>Emperor Qing’s clothes fluttered in the wind, and he looked as if he was about to ride the wind and return, he calmly said, “The Fusang Ancient Tree was born from the blood of Haotian God and Donghuang Taiyi. I appeared because of the Fusang ancient tree, and I can not help but have some subtle senses toward things related to them. You have seen me borrow the power of the ‘Monster of the Heavenly Dao’, and the key is that he has some sense of Donghuang.”</p><p>“The monster of Heavenly Dao is Donghuang Taiyi?”This was beyond Meng Qi’s expectations.</p><p>“Yes and no,”the Green Emperor replied sarcastically. “The monster of Heavenly Dao is Donghuang Taiyi, but Donghuang Taiyi is not a monster of Heavenly Dao.”</p><p>Meng Qi’s heart skipped a beat when he heard this, and he thought of the demonic blood peach in his hands, he probed, “Could it be that Donghuang, in order to hide from the world and avoid death, took the initiative to split into several parts, and one of them devoured and merged with the monster of Heavenly Dao?”</p><p>And part of the peach that the dao fruit had turned into fell into his hands?</p><p>“It’s very possible.”Even with Emperor Qing’s realm and identity, he could not be sure.</p><p>Meng Qi thought for a moment and asked, “What is the origin of the monster of the Heavenly Dao?”</p><p>“The remnants of the Dao Fruit of the Dao master are like the remains of the Supreme True Buddha and the remains of the Tang Sanzang.”As an important figure on the other side, Emperor Qing’s words exposed the secret.</p><p>The Supreme True Buddha and the Tang sanzang were indeed the “Products”of Buddha’s minimalism… it seemed that the corpse sha Wujing carried out from the depths of the Spirit Mountain was the remains of the golden body of the Tang Sanzang… Meng Qi took a deep breath. “With the omniscience and omnipotence of the Dao fruit, why are these evil things still left behind after transcending?”</p><p>“No one can be certain about the dao fruit. I suspect that the Heavenly Dao monster and the Supreme True Buddha were left behind by the two dao fruits on purpose. With the will of the apocalypse, they might not even have achieved the dao fruit. They are just a little bit away from the final stage. They will have to wait for the ‘remnant’to completely disappear with the apocalypse before they can truly transcend. This is my opinion, and I can’t be sure. However, Eastern Emperor Taiyi controlled the mystery in the previous few eras and most likely knew part of the secrets of the Heavenly Dao Monster. When he was killed by Haotian, he destroyed his body and a part of his will, flesh, and Dao Fruit quietly merged with the Heavenly Dao Monster. Only then could he escape death.”</p><p>Meng Qi’s thoughts fluctuated as he heard this. For a moment, he was thinking about the other shore and the Dao fruit. For a moment, he was moved by the fact that the primordial age had existed until now. He was waiting for the final calamity to completely erupt and be written off.</p><p>Tang Sanzang’s golden cicada’s molt, the shell of the Supreme True Buddha, was now in my hands. What use could it be?</p><p>If the Buddha was like this, then the DAO Master’s remnant should not be just a heavenly dao monster..</p><p>While he was thinking, the green emperor suddenly changed the topic:</p><p>“I stayed here to wait for you to come and give you the eight words of wisdom.”</p><p>Did he mean that the conversation just now was about reminiscing the past and was not meaningful? No, the Green Emperor was not like me, how could he let things go? Meng Qi was confused and cupped his hands:</p><p>“Please teach me, Senior.”</p><p>Emperor Qing slowly turned around. He was handsome and not like an ordinary person. “Those who are lucky will definitely suffer a great calamity. I’m afraid that I can’t protect you from the disaster that will follow. Therefore, I’ll give you the eight words of wisdom first.”</p><p>Great Calamity? A disaster that even Emperor Qing could not protect? Meng Qi was shocked when he heard that. His emotions rose and fell, and he almost lost control. Fortunately, he suppressed all his thoughts.</p><p>The Green Emperor was not a fortune teller on the street, so he would not threaten others!</p><p>“Please give me some advice, senior!”Meng Qi bowed again solemnly.</p><p>The Green Emperor’s eyes seemed to be hiding another real world. It was dark and gloomy, and it was hard to find any clues. He said calmly,</p><p>“There is no way out, there is no way out.”</p><p>There is no way out, there is no way out? What kind of motto was this? Meng Qi was stunned.</p><p>At this time, the green emperor let out a soft sigh:</p><p>“Disperse.”</p><p>With a wave of his sleeve, a cool breeze swept up and his figure disappeared. The leaves on the JIANMU, of various colors and different kinds of great dao, flew out and landed on the tree of Great Dao in Meng Qi’s hand.</p><p>Light Rose and the tree of great dao absorbed the “Food”happily.</p><p>Inside the immortal-slaying sword array, the heavenly venerate of many treasures showed his might. The world’s unfettered King Buddha and the ancient Buddha of burning lamp suppressed chi spermatozoa and perfected Master Yu Ding, forcing Guang Chengzi to contact various parties. While controlling the sword array to put out fires everywhere, he had no choice but to use the heaven-flipping seal, he landed from time to time to stabilize his own position.</p><p>At this moment, a cool breeze blew over. The sword array that was filled with the intent to destroy and end suddenly burst with vitality. The four-colored light disintegrated, and the one around the heavenly venerate of many treasures was no exception. The time in front of the world’s unfettered king Buddha swayed like water, as if there were waves, when he stabilized his body, his surroundings became clear and hazy. The strong wind howled, and he unknowingly retreated from the highest level of the immortal world and returned to the real world.</p><p>The ancient Buddha’s glazed lamp flickered, confusing his senses. By the time he recovered, he had already appeared outside his own pure land.</p><p>Consort three firmament’s nine-bend yellow river formation vanished into thin air. He unconsciously recalled the fear of being dominated by the big shots on the other side. The experience of being completely powerless was still vivid in his mind.</p><p>Their inner demons almost appeared because of this. It was as if the heaven and Earth diagram, the chaos box, and the Three Treasures Ruyi were right in front of them. Fortunately, the scene around them changed back to the three-cloud Island in time, and the danger did not come.</p><p>Guang Chengzi, Celestial Master Guang FA, Celestial Master duo Bao, and the others also inexplicably withdrew from the highest level of the immortal world. They looked at each other in dismay and no longer had any intention of fighting.</p><p>The fierce confrontation between great divine arts practitioners like themselves was nothing more than a child’s play in the eyes of the big shots on the other side!</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi’s figure appeared in the sky and was also sent out by the Green Emperor. However, the tree of Great Dao hidden in his sleeve had already grown to nine branches, and each branch had nine leaves. It was more mysterious than before.</p><p>What did the Green Emperor Mean? He frowned slightly and was puzzled.</p><p>“Forget it. After I’ve finished waiting, I’ll return to the hollow jade temple to discuss with little sang.”Soon, Meng Qi got rid of his other thoughts and remembered something. A smile appeared on his face and he directly descended to the Changle Imperial Palace.</p><p>Now that the god Ascension Roll had returned, he could revive Chong and his senior!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
