Only when he could no longer feel the aura of the person behind him and could no longer hear the curse-like words did tan ping stop his divine ability and land on the peak of the mountain on his left, he looked in the direction he came from with lingering fear.</p><p>He had actually returned to the ancient era when he was ascending to godhood, and this was not the main point. The main point was that he had actually met Shen Gongpao directly and enjoyed the treatment of “Fellow Daoist, please wait!”!</p><p>“Fortunately, I was quick and opened the second secret treasure. With many treasures, I was able to get rid of that Death Star.”Tan Ping could not help but mumble.</p><p>The innate god spirit water ancestor had witnessed the ascension to godhood. As his reincarnation, Tan Ping was no stranger to Shen Gongpao. When the familiar words entered his ears, his aura was immediately confirmed. Furthermore, back when the heavenly court was in its heyday.., water ancestor had interacted with his colleagues on the god Ascension Board. He was shocked to find that anyone who heard Shen Gongpao’s words, “Fellow Daoist, please wait a moment”, would inevitably die and enter the board with just a bit of their true spirit, it was as if there was a curse on the other shore level taking effect.</p><p>The lesson from the past was still in his heart. Not only was tan ping not ashamed of his own desertion, he was actually very proud of it!</p><p>Soon, he calmed down and muttered in his heart, “I wonder which stage of Ascension is it? Other than going to see me and ‘enlighten’him, can I get other benefits?”</p><p>For a Dharma body expert, this was not a difficult problem. Tan Ping withdrew his gaze from where he had come from and planned to observe the astrology and divine secrets through the layers of clouds and the bright sunlight during the day.</p><p>At this moment, he saw a series of barracks in the distance. The Soldiers’qi and blood were strong, and their dharma was strict. They matched the heavenly laws and formed a dark red cloud that covered the barracks. Further away, there was a mountain with a strange appearance, there was a platform at the top of the mountain, and on the platform, there was a list that shone with a faint golden light.</p><p>Tan Ping looked over and saw that there were runes on the list:</p><p>“God Ascension List!”</p><p>God Ascension List? Tan Ping sucked in a breath of cold air, and his heart suddenly felt uneasy.</p><p>He had fled in a panic and lost his sense of direction. He had actually rushed to the Qi Mountain’s God Ascension List?</p><p>Wasn’t this too much of a coincidence?</p><p>In the unseen world, there was probably an invisible and unfelt power silently guiding his actions!</p><p>His memories and knowledge began to churn in his mind, and his thoughts constantly revolved and stimulated each other. Occasionally, they would collide and flash with a fiery light. After an unknown amount of time, his expression became solemn, and he gradually came to a certain level of understanding:</p><p>The Daoist who lent him the yellow millet pillow intended to be on the god-ascension board!</p><p>Therefore, the first few times were a sweet taste. Now, he had to pay the necessary “Reward”?</p><p>After he was reincarnated as Tan Ping, he was no longer an innate god, and he had to hide it from some of his competitors. Therefore, his current strength was insufficient, and he was not well-informed. It was impossible for him to know the details of the cross-shore confrontation when Maitreya tried to verify the Dao, he even forgot about Maitreya and only knew that there was the holy mother of White Lotus, Gu Xiaosang.</p><p>“However, the ‘god-ascension ranking’of the current node is in the hands of the one from vacuum hometown. He is one of the high and mighty people on the other side. What can I use to covet the ‘God-ascension Ranking’?”Tan Ping looked into the distance with a solemn gaze.</p><p>In the struggle between the people on the other side, what the current node could not get, was the same as going back to the past! Unless there was a qualitative difference in the degree of ancientness compared to all the opponents, it was clear that the dao practitioners of this era could at least trace back to the beginning of the nine underworlds in the immortal realm, and it definitely included the matter of ascending to godhood.</p><p>When he thought of this, the water ancestor Tan Ping felt a chill, he thought to himself, ‘the one from vacuum hometown used the ‘Godhood ranking’to replace the ‘Ghost God True Spirit Map’as the foundation to support the netherworld. This completely cancels out the final influence of that person from the Bodhi Pure Land on the netherworld. If there really is a struggle for the ‘Godhood ranking’, the latter will definitely stand on the opposite side of that person from vacuum hometown. That person from the hollow jade temple has a close relationship with the current human emperor, so he should also help. As for the other important figures, it is difficult to guess their attitudes and wills</p><p>“Under such circumstances, if I were to get involved in an open and secret struggle between the two shores, I would only die a miserable death!”</p><p>Tan Ping frowned, his eyes flickering. Suddenly, he made up his mind and turned around to leave!</p><p>“In any case, there are no clear instructions and no direct decree. Just treat it as if I didn’t understand this intention and do my own thing!”At this moment, he was actually gnashing his teeth. He planned to pretend to be stupid and stall for as long as he could.</p><p>If there were really clear orders in the end, then he would have to bite the bullet. could he still resist? He only hoped that the other party could protect him a little and not treat him as an abandoned child!</p><p>The flight light rose again, and Tan Ping once again fled in a panic. He could not determine the direction and only wanted to get far away from the Qi mountain.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the sky was dark, and starlight shone. He stopped and looked up at the sky, calculating his current position.</p><p>“Hu…”seeing that his home was not strangely circling around Mount Qi, but was actually approaching the North Sea, he let out a long sigh and recovered from his fear. He decided to immediately go to the Seventh Heaven of the immortal world to find his true body, there was no time to waste. He could not delay any longer!</p><p>With a leap, light soared into the sky. Tan Ping arrived outside the South Heaven Gate with ease, and then took out the water ancestor token in the secret treasure.</p><p>Seeing the jade pendant that seemed to be formed from endless layers of blue, the divine general guarding the South Heaven Gate did not question him. Instead, he waved his hand and let them pass.</p><p>After passing through two layers of heaven, Tan Ping’s eyes suddenly lit up. He saw a familiar scene again.</p><p>This layer of sparkling light and dark water surface hid layers of universes and galaxies. It could be said to be a brilliant ocean, vast and boundless, covering all directions. Many races lived there and opened many immortal cave abodes, the water ancestor was born here.</p><p>“At this juncture, Ghost Emperor Cheng Tang is lobbying the gods with relatively independent authority for the matter of Yin Shang and contacting the Buddhists… at this moment, he seems to have just left the Jade Lake and come to rope in my original body…”Tan Ping thought, he planned to wait for a while and stagger into a soup to avoid embarrassment.</p><p>When the Battle of Ascension to Godhood began, Ghost Emperor Cheng Tang, who had created his own world of Yin, naturally would not wait for his death. He could only watch as the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure fought against the heavenly venerate of morality and the oldest heavenly venerate of primordial beginning alone, he ran around the Monster Emperor Palace, the Elysium Realm, and the Bodhi Pure Land. On one hand, he was trying to get NUWA’s support again, and on the other hand, he was planning to ask the two saints of the west to intervene.</p><p>At the same time, the current Heavenly Lord had not been able to suppress the entire world. The Golden Emperor and a few other deities had always respected the three pure ones and neglected him, so there was room for persuasion. Therefore, Cheng Tang entered the ninth heaven, wanting to stir up the wind and clouds in the immortal world and change the focus.</p><p>With a plan in mind, Tan Ping slowed down his escape light and wandered freely in the Sea of stars.</p><p>Just as he turned around a star, he suddenly bumped into a Daoist wearing a green scarf on his head, wearing a pair of sandals and riding on a black tiger. The moment he saw the other party, Tan Ping’s scalp went numb, and he just wanted to escape this world without caring about anything.</p><p>The Daoist was stunned at first, and then he revealed a brilliant smile. “Fellow Daoist, you have really stayed far away!”</p><p>At this point, tan ping calmed down and chuckled:</p><p>“Who am I? So it’s fellow Daoist Shen Gongpao.”</p><p>As long as I didn’t believe what Shen Gongpao said next and wasn’t tricked by him into protecting Shang and destroying Zhou, I wouldn’t be in any danger?</p><p>I didn’t believe that the words ‘fellow Daoist, please stay a moment’could be so evil!</p><p>Shen Gongpao said with a smile, “I thought you looked familiar when I saw you before, so I took the liberty to talk to you. Now I finally understand what’s going on. Do you think you are the water ancestor’s clone or something similar?”</p><p>“If you say so.”Tan Ping didn’t want to say anything more and asked casually, “Why did you come to this world, fellow Daoist?”</p><p>He didn’t have any fragments of Shen Gongpao’s visit in his memory. was history beginning to change subtly?</p><p>Shen gongpao chuckled and said, “This penniless priest has obtained an item and wants to offer it to Ghost Emperor Tang. Coincidentally, I found out earlier that he plans to visit the water ancestor. Now that I see that the matter is of great importance, I might as well rush over directly.”</p><p>Tan Ping’s heart suddenly thumped, and he had a bad premonition.</p><p>No matter what he said, I have no plans to respond. Why am I still trembling with fear? Could it really be that evil?</p><p>Holding back the urge to turn around and leave, tan ping asked cautiously, “What is it?”</p><p>Shen gongpao smiled and took out an item from his pocket. It flickered with light gold and had the words ‘God Ascension Roll’written on it.</p><p>God Ascension Roll! With a buzz, Tan Ping’s mind felt as if it had been struck by lightning and instantly went blank.</p><p>Why was the god Ascension Roll in his hands?</p><p>How did he get the God Ascension Roll?</p><p>Where was the fury of that person from his hometown of vacuum?</p><p>What were the big shots on the other side thinking?</p><p>“This penniless priest fought back and went to Qishan to snatch the god Ascension Roll…”Shen Gongpao’s words echoed in tan ping’s ears, but he had already ignored the other party’s follow-up, he only felt that many gazes from the highest level of the nine heavens, the Jade Lake, the paradise world, and other places were looking over, causing his body to sweat profusely and his soul to almost dissipate.</p><p>Now that the god Ascension rankings had changed hands, history would be greatly changed. The fates of countless gods and immortals would be rewritten, and he might not be able to live to the end of the Tribulation and reincarnate!</p><p>No, he had to send the god Ascension rankings back!</p><p>Things were really that evil..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
