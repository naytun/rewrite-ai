What you say to the Empress is your own business.”</p><p>Meng Qi did not care. Instead, he bowed solemnly:</p><p>“Thank you for your trouble, Great Sage!”</p><p>Sun Wukong felt a little uncomfortable in the face of such a great ceremony and such respect. He scratched his ears and cheeks and said, “Quickly go in, quickly go in.”</p><p>He retracted his gaze and continued to pass through the doors. Before long, the pill and the ancient cauldron appeared in front of Meng Qi’s eyes. The surroundings were filled with dense mist and a strange fragrance assailed his nostrils. He raised his head and moved forward. He could only see layers of curtains covering his line of sight. His divine sense could not pass through, he could only vaguely see a hazy figure in the depths. The gentleness and compassion seemed to be tangible.</p><p>“Su Meng pays his respects to His Majesty.”Meng Qi looked straight ahead and paid his respects.</p><p>A gentle and indifferent voice came from behind the layers of white curtains, “Since you are a human, you can call me your Majesty.”</p><p>“Yes, Your Majesty.”In the depths of the demon Emperor Palace, Meng Qi’s figure, which was formed by his thoughts, rippled like waves, emitting purple light. If not for his master’s permission, he would not even be able to exist.</p><p>“You came here today because of the matter on the other shore?”The Demon Emperor’s voice passed through the layers of curtains. It was calm as usual, without any sadness or joy.</p><p>Meng Qi took a deep breath and said calmly, “Your Highness, you have seen a thousand miles. This junior is here for this matter.”</p><p>The white gauze swayed as if there was a gentle breeze. The Demon Emperor did not speak and remained silent.</p><p>Seeing this situation.., meng Qi said to himself, “Your Highness created man-made objects in the primordial era and held the power of life. She was both the emperor of demons and the ancestor of humans. She was always impartial until the heavenly venerate of virtue valued the cultivation potential of the human race. The heavenly venerate of primordial beginning began to lean toward it. In order to seek balance, he slowly protected the demon race. However, he also favored the former human emperor.”</p><p>The former human emperor was referring to the real human emperor who dominated the last years of the ancient era.</p><p>“Unfortunately, his prejudice is too deep and he is unwilling to tolerate the demi-human race…”behind the layers of white curtains, the demi-human emperor sighed softly.</p><p>From this, it could be seen that he watched the fall of the human emperor and did not lend a helping hand… Meng Qi thought to himself and continued to speak, “The Empress is the ancestor of the human race. She is the carrier of my flesh and blood. This is a kindness rather than karma. Therefore, I do not dare to use this to plead with her. I even have feelings for her.”</p><p>“In my opinion, the person that the Empress wants to ascend to the other shore should be the equal to the heavens grand sage. He is from the demon race and is the product of the primordial Lord of Heaven. He has a close relationship with the bodhisattva ancient Buddha. Before the Battle of Mount Ling, he maintained a good relationship with almost all the other powers. Furthermore, he has the will to destroy the heavens. As long as he accumulates enough, other than himself, there will be no other obstacles on the other shore path.”</p><p>The Demon Emperor’s voice was ethereal, “He was born in the demon race and he followed the golden cicada master to cultivate Buddhism. He should be able to treat humans equally.”</p><p>His answer tacitly agreed with Meng Qi’s guess.</p><p>“It’s a pity that there was the Battle of Mount Numinous,”Meng Qi said calmly, “He broke off his relationship with Buddhism and left a grudge behind. Furthermore, he was severely injured and almost fell. He had to rely on the celestial venerable of morals to cultivate pills for a few hundred to two hundred thousand years before he recovered. He maintained his peak strength, but because of that, he lacked many opportunities. His accumulation can not be compared to Maitreya and Yang Jian. He could not reach the other shore easily.”</p><p>Furthermore, the Golden Emperor, who had obtained the remains of the Tang monk, would not be willing to let the Monkey King escape from the Sea of suffering.</p><p>The mist floated and the surroundings were silent. The Demon Emperor fell silent once again, as if he wanted to hear what Meng Qi had to say next.</p><p>“The few remaining great sages relied on the changes in the apocalyptic world and many fortuitous encounters to reach the perfect destiny realm. However, when it comes to the other side, it is almost impossible. They are too far away from the relic of the Great Ming King Peacock. They have refined five innate five elements tail feathers and reached the destiny realm. However, they are still thousands of miles away from the other side… after counting, only Fox Qingqiu is left. She has received the demon saint’s inheritance and with the five virtues, she has improved step by step. She is walking very steadily. Even if she is not at the perfect destiny realm, she is not too far away. Unfortunately, compared to the younger generation at the center of the storm, she has less danger and less training that can not be exchanged for gifts. The opportunity should be in the next era, if there is one.”</p><p>Meng Qi spoke slowly. His last sentence borrowed Yang Jian’s words to show that he was related to the next era.</p><p>There was no question of being humble when facing important figures on the other side. It was only right to show his own advantages.</p><p>After listening to Meng Qi’s narration, the monster Emperor said without any emotion in his tone,</p><p>“Where is nine spirit primordial saint? where is Yang Jian?”</p><p>Nine spirit primordial saint was an old monster who had completed his destiny during his journey to the west. He had gained something from guarding the nine Nether Gate since the beginning of time. Most importantly, he was a disciple of the Azure Emperor. Supporting him could also exchange for the goodwill of the Azure Emperor, not to mention Yang Jian, his whereabouts were a mystery, and his accumulation was so deep that it was almost impossible for him to be the second person in the world. Maitreya might not even be a match for him.</p><p>“Yang Jian himself isn’t willing. If he agrees, I’m willing to support him with all my strength,”said Meng Qi without changing his expression.</p><p>As long as Yang Jian broke free from the sea of bitterness, it would mean that there would be another shore on his side. Furthermore, it would be someone like the celestial venerable of Morals who was certain to help him. When that happened, the situation would be reversed. Even if the other party released the fiend Buddha, he would at most gain the upper hand, then, he would be able to calmly set up the other shore. It would be more than a thousand or ten thousand times more comfortable than it was now?</p><p>Unfortunately, everyone could see this.</p><p>“As for the nine spirits primordial saint…”Meng Qi didn’t say much and only said five words, “One gate, two shores.”</p><p>It wasn’t just Buddhism and Taoism in the broad sense, it was just the Fusang Ancient Tree realm!</p><p>The Monster Emperor didn’t mention the matter of the nine spirits primordial saint anymore. There was a hint of an unfathomable smile in his tone:</p><p>“According to what you said, who else would be the new one on the other side?”</p><p>Meng Qi’s gaze met the layers of white gauze curtains as he said seriously,</p><p>“More importantly, this junior does not wish for your Majesty to directly lend a hand.”</p><p>“Oh?”The Monster Emperor expressed his doubts appropriately.</p><p>“The death of the monster saint is partly due to Ah Nan, and he has fallen into the Devil and is insane. This is also one of the Reasons Why Your Majesty has always been kind to this junior. She does not wish to see him complete,”Meng Qi said in a deep voice, “I only have one thing to ask of you. When I reach the other shore, please keep an eye on the Spirit Mountain and stop the Devil Buddha from escaping. There’s no need for you to directly participate in the battle.”</p><p>“And now, I can make a promise. If I reach the other shore in the future, I will treat the monster race equally, as long as there are no similar incidents in the past when the monsters roiled the land.”</p><p>The Monster Emperor pondered for a moment before speaking:</p><p>“It was my intention to watch over the demon Buddha. It’s better that you have this intention.”</p><p>“But I have to remind you that we can also think of what you can think of.”</p><p>After saying that, a breeze blew and the mist expanded. Meng Qi’s figure returned to a wisp of purple gas and dissipated in the monster Emperor Palace.</p><p>“Your Highness, how can he be so crazy? If you watch the Spirit Mountain, what can you use to fight against the Golden Emperor? “The Alliance of the celestial venerable of morality and the Green Emperor is not as powerful as Amitabha and Bodhi ancient Buddha, not to mention the fact that he has a lifeless mother!”The curtain blew, the white gauze swayed, revealing the seductive face of the Fox Qing Qiu. She was not convinced by Meng Qi’s comment just now.</p><p>The demon Saint Spear in her hand had already awakened to the higan-level.</p><p>The voice of the demon emperor sounded gently, “The higan-level is the only one who can fight against the higan-level. His trump cards include the monster of the Heavenly Dao, the Emperor Fu, the Celestial Emperor who is still alive, and more higan-level talents. Therefore, he used himself as bait in the open and secretly asked Gu Xiaosang to plan these things, especially the monster of the Heavenly Dao that is closely related to the Donghuang Empire</p><p>“The supreme mental demon he created with the cause of all fruits and the Yuan Xin seal is indeed extraordinary, but who on the other side doesn’t know what he is good at and what he has learned? Who doesn’t know what he might do next?”</p><p>“Whatever he can think of, we can also think of it. It seems like everything is going smoothly now, but there is probably a fatal trap ahead.”</p><p>After listening to these words, Qing qiu frowned and asked, “Then where is his life force?”</p><p>“It depends on what secrets Gu Xiaosang learned from the primordial beginning Celestial Master that we don’t know.”The Demon Emperor’s tone was calm.</p><p>“Primordial beginning Celestial Master?”Qing Qiu was shocked.</p><p>..</p><p>Mount Yuhuang, Blackheaven sect.</p><p>In the quiet room where the saber of time was placed, the current sect master was meditating with his eyes closed, cultivating bitterly.</p><p>Suddenly, his eyes opened, revealing a hint of purple. The saber light in front of him was like water, instantly sealing the pavilion.</p><p>“You were refined from the heavenly emperor’s body and have never acknowledged him as your master.”Meng Qi used the Supreme Mental Devil Dao to temporarily control the current leader of the Blackheaven sect and slowly explained to the saber of time in front of him, “You should know that the heavenly emperor has not completely fallen and is still waiting for his return.”</p><p>The saber of time was like water and there were no changes.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
