There were all kinds of tributaries in the future, and things were uncertain and unpredictable. Therefore, there were a few exceptions among the innate spirits who were indifferent and only fought for the Great Dao, such as the Hou tu who pitied all living beings, and the demon saint who was extremely emotional.</p><p>At this moment, he struck the center of the spear. Looking at the Devil Buddha whose expression had changed drastically, a faint mocking and smiling expression appeared in her beautiful crystal eyes.</p><p>When I had yet to reach the other shore, you were that unrivalled hero who had suppressed the primal chaos and nearly caused the Daoist master to escape. You were a great figure who had caused people’s hearts to pound, a great man whom I admired but did not dare to approach, you were a candle flame that always watched from afar, a moth that flew into the flame, and you did not hesitate at all..</p><p>When you fell at the end of the primal chaos, I was powerless to save you and was disheartened. However, I unexpectedly discovered that you had not died completely, but had voluntarily abandoned your true body and the imprint of the past and future, i relied on a little bit of my life force and all of my memories to entrust the ancient lightning pool to live through this era. I was truly furious and overjoyed. I hurriedly contacted you in secret and was tricked by you into swearing an oath using a secret technique that you would not reveal your true identity, i also helped you drive a wedge between the monster race and the three pure ones, as well as the relationship between the three pure ones. I was willing to do all of this without any complaints..</p><p>However, during the Battle of the Spiritual Mountain, you not only abandoned me for your own sake, but you also wanted to exterminate the monster race. All the vows you made in the past could not compete with the fight for the Great Dao and your belief in revenge!</p><p>In your eyes, I was probably just a tool. It was not a coincidence that you accidentally found out that the thunder god was Haotian. It was you who deliberately revealed it so that you could help me..</p><p>I endured for eternity and waited for eternity. I watched you be free and unfettered. I watched you reach the other shore so that this spear could be absolutely safe!</p><p>Otherwise, with the help of the monster of the Heavenly Dao and the reincarnation seal, you wouldn’t be able to kill me in one strike even when you were at your weakest. Instead, you would reveal the secret of the demon Empress.</p><p>Now, do you feel the pain of this spear? Such pain has been brewing in my heart for countless years!</p><p>The world-burning fire was burning, the light of the five virtues interweaved, and the faint black evil aura crushed the various demonic techniques that Ah Nan was operating. Meng Qi’s hands were either holding the limitless seal, entangling the threads of karma, or transforming into giant lightning hands, or he was using the three virtues as palms to firmly bind the demon Buddha, preventing him from stopping his devouring and escaping.</p><p>It was not easy for him to fall into a trap, how could he let go of such a great opportunity!</p><p>The Devil Buddha’s reversal ignited a layer of dark fire. It was suppressed by the Heaven, earth, black, yellow, exquisite pagoda, and the Taiji diagram. Feng Xi’s beautiful figure was reflected in his eyes, and it was as if he heard the death knell, scenes of the past flashed through his mind like the passing of a mortal:</p><p>He helped the heavenly emperor, helped him obtain the support of the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning and the heavenly venerate of morality, unified the immortal world, and secretly instigated Feng Xi to bewitch the demon Emperor with some secrets of the Dao venerate. He joined hands with the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure, supported him into soup, and finally, through Feng Xi.., spreading the apocalypse to the Demon Emperor, the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure’s terror and the great increase in the hope of the Dao fruit, set off a battle to ascend to godhood, greatly weakening the numinous treasure..</p><p>After the Celestial Emperor had dominated the world, he made a big fuss about the goal of alienating the Celestial Emperor, the primordial beginning Celestial Master, and the Moral Celestial Master. He beheaded Ah Nan, who was a Buddhist, and threw himself into the Spirit Mountain, laying the foundation for the Celestial Emperor to become close to Buddhism. He himself then turned to Buddhism, he wanted to use this to return to the other shore. In the end, he succeeded through Sun Wukong and a series of other things..</p><p>Then, he betrayed the Celestial Emperor and indirectly broke the news of the construction wood fruit. First, the title of the Celestial Emperor could only be Haotian. He had profited by letting that guy shine for so many years. It was time to give up and make the best use of it, secondly, it was time for those on the other side to fight over the fruit of the tree of life and cause chaos. In that case, as the oldest and most powerful on the other side, with the help of the Celestial Master of Morals, the primordial Lord of Heaven had a good chance of obtaining the fruit of the tree of life, from then on, it would become a restricted and incomplete dao fruit. In the future, it would be difficult for them to make a move. They could only wait for the end of the epoch. In that case, only the Celestial Master of Morals was left intact in the three pure ones</p><p>Who knew that the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning would suddenly realize at the last moment. Facing the fruit, he turned around and left without any hesitation. He did not lie about external things. Even Amitabha and Bodhi Buddha were suspicious, in the end, the fruit fell into the hands of the Buddha of Lingshan. With this, he became a dao fruit and gave birth to the Supreme True Buddha, a terrifying monster that countered Buddhism. He had no choice but to provoke the monster race to attack Lingshan and reverse the Ten Thousand Buddhas Formation at the critical moment, he destroyed the Buddha and Bodhisattva before the Supreme True Buddha devoured them, so that he could at most eat the golden body’s remains. Therefore, at the current juncture, the supreme true Buddha was still “Down and out.”At the same time.., this also damaged the demon emperor, Amitabha, and the others, who seemed to show signs of reducing the amount of time they had</p><p>In the mortal world of reincarnation, in order to get rid of the sea of suffering before those on the other side returned, they had the right to set up a fair and aboveboard plan..</p><p>Eventually, there would be feelings, guilt, and obsession. The more one reincarnated, the more one would sink into the abyss, and it would be difficult to see the tathagata..</p><p>Giving up all good thoughts and completely letting go of one’s obsession, one would eventually fall into the Abyss and ascend to the other side. Before the obstructionists could escape from the influence of the current node and return from their slumber..</p><p>After doing so much and putting in so much effort, all in exchange for this stab in the back? Did his ambition and thirst for the Great Dao Vanish just like that?</p><p>No, I am not willing to accept this!</p><p>The demon Buddha’s eyes were like fire as his body suddenly expanded and transformed. All that was left was darkness and an empty hole, just like the situation at the end of the epoch. It caused the seas to sink into the sinkhole and the islands to sink.</p><p>I am the demon that destroyed the world. I am the symbol of the end of the epoch. I will not fall so easily!</p><p>Seeing this, Meng Qi restrained his smile. The supreme infinite primordial Qi collapsed and turned into a point with his own dao body. It contained the past, present, and future. It contained all things and all principles, it was the beginning and the end point. It held on in the darkness, pulling on the void and preventing the Devil Buddha from breaking free.</p><p>At the same time, the purple blade turned into lightning. With the power to split the sky and split the earth, it illuminated the endless darkness. Demon Saint Phoenix XI spun the Black Golden Spear with Phoenix wings, constantly crushing and burning the life force of the Devil Buddha, Ah Nan.</p><p>The two joined forces to destroy the demon Buddha in the shortest time possible!</p><p>In the Bodhi Pure Land, when demon Saint attacked with his spear, the ancient Buddha had already stood up. He reached out his hand and touched the seven treasures wonderful tree, and the leisurely look in his eyes completely disappeared.</p><p>If Su Meng killed the demon Buddha, even if he could not devour and assimilate it, the remaining “Dao fruit of eradication”of the demon Buddha would naturally belong to his other “I”, which was Su Meng. In this way.., with the “Dao Fruit of eradication”as the basis, using the corresponding sword scriptures and array formations of the four celestial eradication swords as the foundation, he was able to slash out a weak incarnation of the other shore that symbolized the end, allowing his own dao fruit to take shape and become an ancient being, he allowed the heavenly venerate of morals to complete the task of reducing the void, allowing the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure to bear the name of karma, allowing the three pure ones to transcend the Dao!</p><p>Back then, the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning had chosen the “He and I”that the Devil Buddha had hidden as the target of reducing the void. It seemed like his true intention was to “End the dao fruit”!</p><p>At this moment, he could only stop it..</p><p>At this moment, on one side, demon Saint had stopped, the godhood world had been emptied, and the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure was about to break free. On the other side, demon Saint had joined forces with Su Meng to severely injure the Devil Buddha and make it impossible for him to escape. Bodhi ancient Buddha did not hesitate and swept down the seven treasures magical tree from afar, however, it was not as clear as before and swept away the demon Saint Spear.</p><p>As for the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure, he would leave it to the Golden Emperor. He believed that he was the last person who would want to see the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure return!</p><p>At this moment, the Heavenly Emperor took a step forward indifferently. A layer of flowing water-like flame emerged from his body, burning the dao body that originally belonged to the Fu Emperor and burning his own illusory dao fruit.</p><p>He actually released his body and willingly fell!</p><p>Time flourished, and the current node overlapped with the end of the epoch. It attached to the long saber and covered the god-sealing world, temporarily stopping the heavenly venerate of Lingbao who was about to break out.</p><p>He withstood the two most ancient heavenly venerates at the cost of his own death!</p><p>However, there was a smile in the eyes of the heavenly emperor. This was the last step to break away from the end of the era and the fall of the Heavenly Emperor!</p><p>Of course, the last step had to hold you back!</p><p>All of a sudden, all the worlds in the universe suddenly became dark and chaotic. Gu Xiaosang traced back to the early years of the ancient era and completely formed the illusory dao fruit, welcoming the final test before the other shore.</p><p>The first type of abnormal phenomena on the other shore: the chaos of Heaven and earth!</p><p>At the sight of this scene, the woman who looked like Gu Xiaosang but was more mature, elegant, and dignified stood up in the bright moon in her hometown of vacuum, which had been silent since the beginning. Behind her stood a pitch-black and terrifying flag, it intertwined with the end of the epoch and merged with the current situation. Six Flags were hung down, each with six names written on it:</p><p>“Meng Qi!””Devil Buddha!””Demon Emperor!””Amitabha Buddha!””Bodhi ancient Buddha!””Heavenly venerate of morality!”</p><p>On the streamers, layers of dark patterns overlapped, forming three inexplicably horrifying words:</p><p>“Six Soul Streamers!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
