The important figures on the other side of the river who had escaped from the sea of bitterness were all high and mighty, looking down on the passage of time and the vicissitudes of the mortal world. How could they be easily seen?</p><p>Although they were also considered to be in the immortal class and were beyond the mortal world, in the eyes of the other side, they were probably no stronger than the dust!</p><p>One after another, they circulated their dao strength and used immortal spells to tidy themselves up, not daring to show the slightest disrespect. Reverend Zhu long even took out a small bottle made of red coral and threw it into the sky. As it poured over, streams of clear spring water poured down like rain, it completely enveloped the entire ning bi peak.</p><p>The “Drizzle”was misty, washing away the filth and purifying the body and mind. Tan Ping and the others only felt their entire bodies relaxed and refreshed. Their surroundings seemed to have been washed, and they actually felt somewhat translucent.</p><p>They looked at the peak in shock, not understanding what had happened and why such a change had occurred.</p><p>After a short while, the peak was green and green, full of vitality. The spring water gurgled, and the bottom could be seen. In the center, there was an awning with lanterns and streamers, and it was otherworldly.</p><p>Just as everything was ready, a crane’s cry came from the sky, and it resounded through the nine heavens. Then, spiritual master Zhu Long and the others saw a dense mist come from somewhere, and a strange fragrance assailed their nostrils. A clear light covered the road.</p><p>Nine five-clawed true dragons slowly descended from an infinite height. They pulled an ancient and holy chariot of Agarwood. Waves of dark yellow light rose from within and formed a canopy that emitted an infinite amount of light.</p><p>Although Tan Ping and the others did not understand what had happened, just the sight of the true dragons with golden or crimson scales made them subconsciously hold their breath. They felt a shock that came from the bottom of their hearts, they did not dare to make a sound.</p><p>They had seen the nineteen sons of the Dragon King of the eastern sea from afar, but they did not have the power of the true dragons in the sky. More importantly, they were only the carriage drivers!</p><p>Who knew what kind of people were sitting in the agarwood carriage to make nine true dragons pull the carriage?</p><p>Back when the Sacred Emperor went on patrol, only nine dragons pulled the carriage!</p><p>On the other peak, the wat-wielding divine messenger and the unfettered king and Buddha stood up instinctively and blurted out at the same time,</p><p>“Primordial Lord of Heaven!”</p><p>Primordial Lord of Heaven, Su Meng!</p><p>The Agarwood sedan was getting closer and closer. Its canopy covered the top of the sedan, and light burst out like a beaded curtain that covered the interior of the sedan. One could only vaguely see a round, bright and flawless light. Inside, the green trees were rooted and covered with a clear light, there were two vaguely visible fruits hanging on the sedan, holding an ancient glass lamp that illuminated all the worlds in the universe. Under the round light, there was a blurry figure.</p><p>On the peak of Ning Bi Peak, Golden Lotuses appeared on the ground, and clear spring water flowed out of the flowers. Reverend Zhu Long and the others had solemn expressions, and their hearts trembled with fear. They followed Fang Huayin and kowtowed, saying in unison,</p><p>“Welcome, teacher!”</p><p>“Welcome, Celestial Venerable!”</p><p>The sound reverberated in all directions, reaching the ears of Tan Ping and the others. Their hearts trembled, and a word suddenly appeared in their minds:</p><p>“Primordial Lord of Heaven!”</p><p>The person who had come was actually fairy Mingxia’s teacher, primordial Lord of Heaven, Su Meng. He was one of the few important figures on the other side of the world, the current supreme figure!</p><p>They had never thought that they would be lucky enough to witness a person on the other side of the world, the ruler who stood at the highest level of heaven and earth!</p><p>Their hearts and bodies became solemn as they followed suit and kowtowed. They did not communicate with each other, but they were surprisingly in sync:</p><p>“Welcome, Celestial Lord!”</p><p>The Voice of the celestial venerable reverberated in all corners of the world. The nine dragons agarwood sedan stopped in front of the awning, and the inside of it immediately shone brightly. There were multicolored clouds shooting up into the sky, and the earth was filled with dense mist. There was a lofty and lofty feeling that was not tainted by time.</p><p>The bright and flawless round light entered the awning, and the Agarwood sedan shrank inch by inch and stopped beside it. The entire Changmen Island was completely silent, as if it had entered another world.</p><p>Seeing Fang huayin enter the awning to greet him, Reverend Zhu long and the other immortals bowed again:</p><p>“Greetings, heavenly venerate!”</p><p>After a few breaths, Fang huayin walked to the edge of the awning and said loudly,</p><p>“Heavenly venerate of the origin of the Jade Void Palace of Kunlun Mountain is here to observe the ceremony!”</p><p>“Heavenly venerate has said that the end of the calamity is dangerous, and the nine Netherworlds will erode it. If humanity is missing, then there will be no hope of recovery. Only by gathering the strength of all living things and working together can we seize a chance of survival.”</p><p>Taoist Xuanwu and the others hurriedly replied, “Thank you for your guidance, Celestial Master. We will definitely do our best to help the human emperor and complete the end of the Tribulation!”</p><p>Tan Ping and the others also answered. In the end, they could not help but feel curious. They raised their heads slightly and looked into the tent, wanting to know what the big figure on the other side looked like.</p><p>The colorful multicolored light was abnormally bright and dense. The bright and clear round light in the tent could be clearly seen, as if it contained all things, all kinds of possibilities and the past and future. And under the round light sat a figure in a dark Daoist robe, he wore an ancient and sacred crown on his head. His face seemed to be blurry and dark.</p><p>Upon seeing this figure, Tan Ping’s mind suddenly buzzed, as if something had exploded.</p><p>Although his attire was different, this was obviously the Daoist who gave him the “Golden millet pillow”, the Daoist who made him dream back to the Middle Ages!</p><p>The golden millet pillow was actually borrowed by an important figure on the other shore! It was lent to him by the original Celestial Master of the Void Jade Temple of Mount Kunlun, Su Meng!</p><p>This kind of knowledge was beyond his expectations. He had never been so bold even when he was daydreaming. A great divine ability creator was already the limit of his imagination, and this was because he had witnessed the sacred Emperor’s sacrifice to the heavens and the awakening of the primordial immortal, otherwise, he would at most think that it was an almighty immortal.</p><p>Dong, Dong, Dong. His heart could not help but beat faster. Excitement, confusion, ecstasy, confusion, and other emotions surged out like a tide.</p><p>Why would a high and mighty figure on the other shore lend him the golden millet pillow?</p><p>The immortal destiny that he had been searching so hard for had actually surpassed the sum of his previous expectations!</p><p>How many people in the world could have encountered someone on the other shore?</p><p>While his thoughts were flying, the Free King Buddha of the world put his palms together and bowed to Meng Qi. He silently formed a lotus position and sat down again. His expression was thoughtful, and he lost his usual carefree smile. The Wat Oracle did not dare to be rude, he was afraid that Meng Qi would find an excuse to use the three treasures ruyi or the Overlord Blade.</p><p>In the past, the primeval Lord of Heaven could not be shameless enough to bully the weak and protect the weak to the extreme. Now, the primeval Lord of Heaven probably would not give in too much. There was no need for him to use his life to test it out.</p><p>He restrained his expression and bowed solemnly. Then, he retreated somewhat nervously.</p><p>Today’s trip was on one hand a demonstration to break the hearts of the people who were depending on Gao Lan. On the other hand, it was an order from the oracle to test out the attitudes of the other important figures on the other shore towards re-establishing the Great Zhou and reviving humanity, this could be seen from the powerful divine arts practitioners they sent out.</p><p>Who knew that the primordial Lord of Heaven, Su Meng, would directly descend and personally watch the ceremony? This was completely out of the expectations of the messenger of God and himself!</p><p>If he had known this would happen, he would not have come at all!</p><p>Clang!</p><p>At this moment, the sound of a bell rang out from the palace community in the middle of Changmen Island. It reverberated in a melodious manner for a total of twelve rings. The rings connected back and forth and resonated, creating a grand and solemn atmosphere.</p><p>Gao Lan wore a flat crown on his head and a bright yellow robe. He walked out of the hall and stepped onto a high platform.</p><p>With a clang, he pulled out the human emperor sword. The Sun, Moon, and stars descended. Mountains, rivers, and rivers lined up. It was as if a magnificent scene of humanity had appeared in every corner of the universe.</p><p>He looked around and said in a deep voice,</p><p>“My homeland has not been restored. I dare not celebrate the re-establishment of the Great Zhou!”</p><p>Before he finished his words, he raised his pale golden longsword. On the vast eastern sea, countless islands rose with the radiance of humanity. They were all different colors. One after another, they gathered in front of him a four-colored seal, it was as if more than half of the map of the Eastern Sea was carved on all four sides!</p><p>With the blessing of fate, humanity gathered again. He looked up at the mountain where the wat-wielding divine envoy was. Their gazes met, and lightning and fire appeared.</p><p>Where was the homeland? The home of the vacuum and the Buddhist kingdom on Earth!</p><p>The wat-wielding divine envoy leaned back slightly, and his eyes became cold. At this moment, he saw a golden light fly out from the green-congealed peak. Countless talismans surrounded it, making it holy and brilliant.</p><p>Gao Lan stretched out his left hand to catch the golden light. It was a bamboo whip. The talismans formed patterns, and the merit was all over his body. It was filled with the aura of stripping the power of the Supreme Dao.</p><p>“Divine Whip!”The wat-wielding divine envoy shrank subconsciously. His aura fluctuated, as if he had met his natural nemesis. The many celestials watching the ceremony looked at each other in dismay.</p><p>Inside the tent, Meng Qi spoke in a dignified manner:</p><p>“With this whip in hand, you can beat All Evil Gods.”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Reverend Zhu long and the others came to a sudden realization. This was probably the legendary divine whip. And the god Ascension Roll had been snatched away by mother Wu Sheng. The wat-wielding divine envoy’s current realm and strength were most likely because of his help!</p><p>No wonder he was so afraid of the Divine Whip!</p><p>Tan Ping was dazzled by the sight. As he thought about it from afar, he suddenly heard a Buddhist proclamation:</p><p>“Amitabha Nanwu. Almsgiver, you have a deep wisdom root and are fated to be with US Buddhists. I wonder if you are willing to follow me and Practice Buddhist Dharma?”</p><p>Following the voice, Tan Ping looked over in astonishment. He just happened to see the ancient giant Buddha turning his head and smiling at him.</p><p>The world’s Free King and Buddha!</p><p>He wants to take me as his disciple?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
