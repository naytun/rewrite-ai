However, he did not expect Sun Wukong to be the product of the primordial Lord of Heaven’s minimization.</p><p>Yang jian nodded slightly, “During the primordial age, after witnessing the DAO Master’s minimization and completion of the dao fruit realm, the grandmaster began to explore his own path. It was slightly different from the DAO Master’s path. He beheaded the Holy Buddha and used the Bodhi ancient Buddha to devote himself to the pure land to perfect everything. This was the beginning of everything. Passing the eight-nine arcane art to Sun Wukong through the Bodhi ancient Buddha was his first attempt. Beheading a dao seal and leaving it to you was his second and possibly final effort.”</p><p>“As for the remaining Heavenly Dao Monsters of the Dao Masters, the Buddha beheaded the golden cicada and used the Mahayana Buddhist dharma to escape. Teacher Yuan Shi’s method seems to be more indirect.”Meng Qi pondered over the matter that Yang Jian described, he figured out the difference.</p><p>Shouldn’t the products of reducing and seeking emptiness be directly produced from the body?</p><p>Yang Jian smiled and said, “That’s right. Using the ‘things’of the other shores to bear the fruits of reducing and seeking emptiness to avoid certain bad things. Furthermore, the selection was not random. They were all pivotal factors in the calamity. Just Like How Monkey Sun was the five-colored stone left behind by the Demon Emperor and you were the ‘him and me’that the fiend Buddha secretly hid, the entire process was mainly guided in order to minimize the relationship between you and me.”</p><p>“I see.”Meng Qi sighed softly.</p><p>Even if he was on the other side, the road was still long.</p><p>After sighing, he asked, “Do you know where teacher origin is now?”</p><p>To reach the other side, a great calamity was the enemy blocking the path. It was very important to find out the whereabouts and situation of the Origin Celestial Master in order to confirm in advance whether he should be included in the situation.</p><p>Yang Jian’s smile immediately turned bitter. “Apart from the moral patriarch, there is probably only one person in the world who knows the Patriarch’s whereabouts. When you calculate the will of the heavens, you should still exclude him. It is expected that he will not take action, but it is an unexpected joy to have help. It is just icing on the cake and has nothing to do with the overall situation. It is the same with the Numinous Treasure Patriarch.”</p><p>He clearly did not want to say who other than the moral celestial master knew the whereabouts of the primordial beginning Celestial Master.</p><p>“As expected.”Meng Qi nodded lightly, showing neither disappointment nor frustration.</p><p>At that moment.., yang Jian changed the topic and said, “Junior martial uncle, although you have moved the ‘past’into the Netherworld, the imprint is still in the real world. It is far from enough to reach the other shore in the netherworld. Furthermore, it is almost impossible to reach the other shore in the netherworld. Thanks to the Netherworld, which is to say, limited by the Netherworld, the demon lords in the past have chosen to leave this place and open the demon world in the Void.”</p><p>“I understand this as well, but as soon as I return to the real world, I will definitely attract the conflict between the people on the other side. The situation seems to be balanced, but it may not be,”Meng Qi said, referring to the things that he had discussed with Gu Xiaosang many times over the years, “Uncle-master dao de is undoubtedly on my side, and there will be no changes. Emperor Qing is kind to me and is willing to protect me from Mother Wusheng, but he may not be happy to see me on the other side. Just like the Monster Emperor, he will help me grow and weaken the demons and Buddhas, but most likely, he doesn’t want me to escape from the sea of bitterness</p><p>“For those on the other side, if there is no need, the number of important figures will not increase. If there is one more on the other side, then there will be endless variables</p><p>“And among those who oppose, mother Wusheng is different from me. Bodhi ancient Buddha has past grudges, and Amitabha would definitely not want to see me ascend to the other side to recreate humanity and destroy the power of the Buddha Kingdom on Earth. They can be considered determined and clear-minded, and there is almost no room for redemption.”</p><p>Meng Qi’s expression did not change as he analyzed the situation, it was as if he was describing other people’s affairs. “Therefore, for me, the most important thing now is to build up my strength step by step and stir up problems step by step. I need to create an opportunity for the Azure Emperor and the monster emperor to be firm in their attitude, take the initiative to seek change, and actively seek new allies on the other shore. Of course, even at this stage, I can’t act Rashly. The comparison between the enemy and myself seems to be barely balanced, but as long as I return to the real world and cause the collision on the other shore, there will definitely be people with ill intentions who will release the Devil Buddha and turn the situation around.”</p><p>The remaining seals in mount numinous gradually loosened. It did not seem like it would be long before the Devil Buddha escaped on his own. It could not be ruled out that the Golden Emperor and the others would take the risk and release this variable ahead of time.</p><p>As for the Heavenly Dao monster and Emperor Fu, their states were very problematic. It was possible that they could be controlled by both parties.</p><p>Yang Jian nodded and agreed with Meng Qi’s words. Then, he said, “But in order to reach the other shore, one must first return to the real world. Junior martial uncle, you have to plan as soon as possible. If you delay, you will miss the opportunity of Maitreya. If you delay, the Devil Buddha will have escaped on his own.”</p><p>He looked at Lin Suhe’s “Retreat”route with a pensive expression.</p><p>“Alright,”Meng Qi replied in an unperturbed tone.</p><p>Yang Jian gave him a deep look. He felt that there was nothing out of the ordinary about his words and actions. There was no fatigue, no pain, and no melancholy. All he could see was the gloominess in his eyes. But the more it was like this.., the more he could see the flames of hatred hidden deep in his heart. He used such emotions as fuel, never to be extinguished.</p><p>“Junior martial uncle, once you consolidate your previous small breakthrough, we will be able to join forces to find Black Heavenly Emperor to discuss the Dao. Then, we will be able to help ghost emperor xuanming and stir up waves in Luo Feng and black prison.”Yang Jian patted his Daoist robe, he stood up slowly and transformed into a blurry, nearly chaotic light that shot up into the sky.</p><p>Ever since heavenly venerate nine chaos obtained the demon Emperor’s Claw, all the fiendcelestials on all levels had submitted, with the exception of a few fake ones.</p><p>Meng Qi watched Yang Jian leave quietly as he slowly closed his eyes. The mud ball above his head opened and a sparkling fruit with a shimmering light rushed out. It was surrounded by an illusory, flowing river.</p><p>The fruit flew out and the river followed it. It merged with the river of time that connected the nine Netherworlds. Meng Qi’s body instantly turned illusory. The figures that passed by did the same. They seemed to form a line with each other, they became the “Ancient snake”that entrenched itself in the river of fate.</p><p>At the beginning of this life, Meng Qi opened his eyes, but he did not stop. He went upstream, and the water in front of his eyes was dark. The surroundings seemed to have formed a tunnel filled with mysterious patterns, faintly revealing the scene of the nine hells outside, the scene was constantly flickering and changing.</p><p>He did not know how long he went upstream, but his heart suddenly moved. The tunnel disintegrated, and his figure appeared somewhere in the Nine Hells. The Black Sun Devil Fog and other things were no different from what he usually saw.</p><p>He raised his head and looked out of the netherworld. Meng Qi saw an enormous lion crouching in the void. It had nine heads, and its snores were like thunder. They shook the heaven and earth, blocking the exit.</p><p>Nine spirit primordial saint?</p><p>Nine spirit primordial saint, who was guarding the gate to the Netherworld?</p><p>Had he already reached the beginning of the near ancient times, or was it during the middle ancient times?</p><p>Nine spirit primordial saint seemed to have sensed the prying eyes. The snores stopped, and he opened eighteen eyes. Each of them reflected a pair of eyes that were as deep as the bottomless sea. They were extremely cold and evil.</p><p>With nine spirits original saint’s realm and strength, he could not help but shudder at this moment.</p><p>“Where did this false shore come from? It’s even more terrifying than the black heaven monarch, Ghost Emperor Xuan Ming, and nine chaos heavenly venerate! Could it be from the future?”Nine spirits original saint’s expression became unusually grave.</p><p>..</p><p>Lin Suhe put away the galaxy meteorite crystal and hid the green jade box. He streaked across the sky and headed straight for the nearest island with the teleportation array.</p><p>At this moment, his eyes lit up. Rays of pale golden glazed light spread out and a fat monk holding a alms bowl appeared inside.</p><p>The monk smiled and looked at Lin Suhe:</p><p>“Amitabha Nanwu, the jade box in almsgiver’s arms is fated with Buddha.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
