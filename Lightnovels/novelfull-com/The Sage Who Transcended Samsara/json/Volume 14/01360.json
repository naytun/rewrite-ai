After a while, she shook her head and said with a slight frown, “It feels like an ordinary lotus seed, nothing special.”</p><p>However, when it appeared, the clear light that was like a fountain and the fresh white lotus that was outlined indicated that it was extraordinary!</p><p>Tan Ping had already recovered the memories and knowledge of the water ancestor. He pondered for a moment and said, “Perhaps we have to find a place where the spiritual spring irrigates and plant it. Only when the leaves grow and the flowers bloom and bear fruit will we know how magical this lotus seed is.”</p><p>“Big Brother Tan’s words make sense.”Xia Xiu nodded slightly. She was full of gratitude towards Tan Ping. He was actually not stingy at all and really shared this rare treasure, the yellow millet pillow, with everyone.</p><p>Then, she described what she saw in her “Dream”. Seeing that everyone was baffled and did not know why, she changed the topic, “Then, Next, we’ll find a place on Changmen Island where the spiritual spring irrigates. We’ll wait for the flowers to bloom while we search for immortal destiny.”</p><p>The rest of her companions repeatedly said yes, looking forward to the fortuitous encounter after using the Golden Millet pillow. Only Tan Ping’s gaze was deep as he thought about other things. Xia Xiu and the others did not know what that period of history represented, however, how could they not know that they had recovered the memories and knowledge of the water ancestor? The seemingly calm scene hid the power struggles of at least three important figures on the other shore. It seemed that the matter of the yellow millet pillow was not an ordinary ‘Immortal Fate’, but a huge whirlpool!</p><p>Previously, when he entered the Mystic Yan Palace of the Eastern Qinghua World of Eternal Music and met the Taiyi Celestial Master of salvation, there was most likely a turbulent undercurrent hidden in it!</p><p>When he thought of this, Tan Ping smiled, without batting an eyelid, he said, “Let’s do as Little Xiu said. However, I still have a wish that I have yet to fulfill, and I have to make it up to her personally. I will be leaving Changmen Island for the time being. Everyone, use the yellow millet pillow in turn. Please do not argue with each other.”</p><p>Since it was a reincarnation to get rid of the restriction of the innate divine body, how could the water ancestor not make arrangements for his own growth and leave behind the corresponding treasures?</p><p>From his memories, Tan Ping knew that there was a place suitable for the exterior stage. He had to open it as soon as possible and take out the things inside so that he wouldn’t let the night fall too late and benefit others like Zhen Wu. More importantly.., he was afraid of being sucked into the other shore whirlpool and wanted to escape far away so he could wait and see.</p><p>Seeing that Tan Ping had never thought of taking the golden millet pillow with him, Xia Xiu and the others didn’t doubt him. They were both grateful and reluctant to part with him and sent him to the teleportation hall on Changmen Island.</p><p>Standing in the teleportation hall and watching the light rise, Tan Ping’s thoughts floated and he recalled something in his mind.</p><p>When he obtained the authority left behind by the true martial arts to complete his body, he also used it to obtain a piece of information left behind by the Black Emperor. In the vast primal chaos, there was a secret spot that hid the Daoist Hall left behind by the holy man after he transcended!</p><p>As the holy man’s child, the true martial emperor was the only living being who knew the location of this Daoist Hall. He planned to open it after he reached the other shore so that he could form the embryonic form of the dao fruit as soon as possible. Unfortunately, no matter how well prepared he was, he still could not cross the limit of the sea of bitterness, in the end, it would benefit him.</p><p>Dao Child’s legacy mansion… Tan Ping muttered these four words and his figure disappeared into the teleportation formation.</p><p>..</p><p>In the extreme north, it was eternally frozen. A storm raged in the sky. One could vaguely see the ice palace shrouded in a hazy fog. It was the place where the demon lord had buried his “Seven orifices ice soul heart”in the past.</p><p>Within the layers of restrictions, the layers of palaces were in perfect condition. There was not the slightest bit of damage. It was filled with a cold and deathly stillness, as if no one had ever stepped in before.</p><p>This was the era of the middle ancient sages!</p><p>A black light twisted like a demonic snake, illusory and illusory. Like a shooting star chasing the Moon, it pierced through all obstacles and arrived at the core of the Ice Snow Immortal Palace. It arrived in front of the ancient mottled bronze coffin.</p><p>Under the illumination of the black light, the bronze coffin suddenly became transparent. It was as if it had returned to an illusion, revealing the black heart with seven apertures inside!</p><p>It was only at this moment that the devilish heart of the seven apertures of the man in the womb suddenly awakened, conjuring the boundless pure land and the great array of ten thousand Buddhas. However, it was still unable to stop the Black Light, and it penetrated one of the apertures.</p><p>Everything returned to calm, and the bronze coffin once again “Closed”. The ice and Snow Immortal Palace was once again cold and deathly silent.</p><p>At the current node, in the nine serenities realm, the demon lord was breathing in the foul qi of the beginning of the world when his body suddenly trembled, and a new memory appeared in his mind.</p><p>If it were not for the fact that he had already formed his destiny and was now on the false shore, he would not even be able to tell that this memory had suddenly appeared at this moment. It had suddenly appeared “From the past”!</p><p>In the memory, a black light transformed into a pitch-black body that enveloped the spiritual world. It had nine heads and twenty-six sides, and it was filled with different negative emotions such as anger, jealousy, and bloodlust. It stood on a black lotus and had twenty-four arms, it held the white bone rosary, the human skin wooden fish, and other Devil Dao Treasures, but it had lost all proportion. It was chaotic and ferocious, terrifying, destructive, sinking, and crazy. It was the true body of the Devil Buddha!</p><p>On the forehead of the devil body of the reverse Buddha, the red and black reverse ten thousand symbol slowly rotated. Its voice seemed to be able to touch the heartstrings of any living being:</p><p>“You have lost the Devil Emperor’s Claw, and you have no strong reinforcements outside. The history that you left behind in the river of time is your greatest weakness. If it weren’t for the other shores temporarily having no time to deal with you, you would have long been reduced to ashes</p><p>“The end of time is near, the end of the epoch. This is the time when we, the evil Devil Gods, are at our peak. Even if I am somewhat weakened because of Su Meng, I can still approach the peak. Do you want to hide in the depths of hell and struggle for your life, waiting for the end, not trying to fight for the other shores?”</p><p>“As long as you are willing to serve me and work for me, I will protect your past, help you take back the Devil Emperor’s Claw, and together we will stir up the end of the world!”</p><p>..</p><p>After ten thousand years, the demon lord’s words were still ringing in his ears. Dark Flames flickered in his eyes, and his expression was somewhat distorted.</p><p>At this point, it was no longer the situation of the end of the ancient era. At that time, the human emperor and the demon Saint were fighting, and he had the demon emperor’s claws in his hands. He was barely able to survive and develop in the crevice. He could find an opportunity to prove the supreme demonic path, and now, he had returned to the other shore.., he was high up in the air and had no backing. He had no hope of breaking free from the Sea of suffering in the Netherworld alone.</p><p>He took a deep breath. His white hair and long black beard rose at the same time, as if he was surrendering to a terrifying existence.</p><p>..</p><p>At an infinitely high place, a sea-stabilizing pearl transformed into Kunlun’s field. The peak where the mountains worshiped was covered with dense mist, covering the ancient hollow jade temple surrounded by 36 ancient wells.</p><p>He Mu was cultivating in his quiet room when he suddenly heard his master, Meng Qi’s voice.</p><p>He stood up abruptly and said respectfully, “As you command, Master.”</p><p>With that, he shrunk into an inch and passed through the pavilion, arriving in front of the ancient Kunlun Bell. He took the bell hammer and struck it hard.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>The Bell’s sound reverberated throughout the heavens and the ten thousand worlds. It rang in the hearts of every disciple of the jade void sect.</p><p>In the world of God Ascension, Duke Qi Huan and little white were first stunned. Then, they revealed an excited and emotional expression. They did not expect that there would be a day when they could hear the bell of the Jade Void sect!</p><p>This was different from the gathering of powerful people. All the disciples of the Hollow Jade Temple could hear it, which meant another meaning:</p><p>After a long time, the hollow jade temple began to speak again!</p><p>Duke Qi Huanong adjusted his clothes and leaped out of heaven and earth. He came to Kunlun’s field and ascended to the hollow jade temple step by step.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>In the Western world, on the Tianzhu Mountain, the Undying Demon God tilted his head slightly as if he was listening. His lips moved for a long time before he finally stood up and exhaled a long breath of turbid air.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>The bell rang throughout Mount Jiuhua, the twenty-eight realms of the Seven Seas, the starry immortal realm, and other places. All those who had the ability to escape to the infinite heights below the jade void sect were inexplicably shaken.</p><p>Outside the Jade Void Palace, thirty-six ancient wells rose with strange lights. The door was open and led directly to the jade clear palace. As the first disciple of the current primordial Lord of Heaven, Meng Qi, he mu waited by the door to welcome his fellow disciples.</p><p>Celestial Lord Guangcheng, Celestial Lord Guangfa of Wen Shu, Chi Jinzi, Celestial Lord Dao Xing, Immortal Master Yu Ding, and other great immortals entered one by one. They each found a futon to sit on, and the rest of the new legends followed.</p><p>After a short while, he mu saw a familiar face and smiled to welcome them:</p><p>“Junior brother Yu, junior sister Qi, you two are really carefree. You roam the starry sea and explore the myriad worlds, making people envious.”</p><p>Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu had been bitterly cultivating ever since their master hid in the netherworld. The former had attained the dharma body a few years earlier than Fang huayin, while the latter had also become an immortal class not long after Meng Qi had ascended to the other shore. Now that they had nothing to do, the couple was in love, together, they traveled through the ancient starry sky and the myriad worlds with their own unique features.</p><p>“Teacher has achieved the other shore, and our wishes have been fulfilled. Naturally, we need to relax a little. After this journey is over, we can consider leaving behind our descendants.”Yu Banshan had already awakened the memories of many lifetimes in the past, wanting to make up for this flaw.</p><p>Upon mentioning this matter, Qi Jinxiu noticed a flash of desolation in He Mu’s eyes, and she quietly pulled Yu Banshan aside, changing the topic, she said, “We met junior martial brother Sun earlier. He traversed the outer seas in the immortal world and established an illustrious reputation. His strength and realm have already caught up to junior martial sister’s.”</p><p>The three fellow disciples exchanged pleasantries for a while. When Fang Huayin and Sun Wu arrived, they entered Jade Clear Palace Hall. They each found a seat and sat down, leaving he mu to continue welcoming the guests.</p><p>The jade pure palace did not look big, but it did not seem crowded when the disciples of the various sects gathered. After fifteen minutes, he mu saw that other than true Lord Qingyuan Miao Dao, who could not leave the Netherworld for the time being, everyone else had arrived, just as he was about to return to the palace and wait for his teacher to begin his lecture, he saw a black light flash over, revealing a Daoist who was covered in a long black robe.</p><p>“May I ask who you are?”He Mu asked in puzzlement.</p><p>The black-robed Daoist pondered for a moment and said, “The immortal demon god of Tianzhu Mountain.”</p><p>He was also a disciple of Yuxu? He Mu was puzzled, but his master did not send any other voice transmissions, so he took advantage of the situation to invite the immortal demon God into the hall.</p><p>Many eyes looked over from the front row, examining this demon god whose identity was unknown.</p><p>At this moment, in front of Yuqing Hall, a dark yellow light lit up. Meng Qi, who was wearing a dark Daoist robe and an ancient Daoist crown, appeared on the Lotus platform. Behind his head, a bright and Perfect Circle of light seemed to contain all the possibilities of logic.., it illuminated the heavens, and the disciples of the hollow jade sect who practiced different seals seemed to be able to gain some enlightenment from this,</p><p>meng Qi held the Three Treasures Ruyi in his left hand and looked at the dao practitioners below. He smiled slightly and said,</p><p>“When it comes to cultivation, one must sail against the current. If one does not advance, one will retreat. At the end of the day, one must put in more effort in order to have a chance of survival.”</p><p>“The Hollow Jade Palace will reopen today, and on the fifteenth day of the Lunar New Year, the DAO will be preached.”</p><p>Upon hearing this, the disciples of the hollow jade temple in the hall cupped their fists and bowed:</p><p>“Thank You, Hierarch Celestial Venerable!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
