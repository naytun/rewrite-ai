It was like the soul-summoning flag at the end of the last era of the universe.</p><p>Woo Woo Woo!</p><p>In the original Netherworld, the wind whistled as if it was crying. The final feeling of the final destination after death became more and more obvious. It was as if it was corporeal. It could bury all living things, Bury everything. When the end of the world came, the other shore did not exist!</p><p>An infinitely large and infinitely small auspicious cloud rushed out from the top of the Golden Emperor’s head. On it floated a dao fruit that contained all things that had come to an end. It was no longer illusory but had an embryonic form. As she faced the “Six Soul Banner”, she bowed gently, the embryonic form of this dao fruit immediately shone brightly. It interweaved with the netherworld, the vacuum hometown, the real world that was beginning to collapse inch by inch, and the strange and terrifying six soul banner. It shot out a dim light that could break free from the current node.</p><p>The dim light transformed, as if it was hiding a universe-destroying sword that could end all eras in the universe. It was indistinct and indistinct, and it was difficult to distinguish.</p><p>This was the final trump card of the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure, who had tried to lift the chessboard in the Ten Thousand Immortals Formation during the Battle of Ascension to godhood. Unfortunately, it was blocked by the powerful figures on the other side, and in exchange, the world was in ruins.</p><p>Now was the end of many eras in the past. It was the doomsday that could bury the other side, and it was even more persistent with the performance of the Six Soul Banner!</p><p>Even though it was suppressing and weakening the other side, and it was impossible to kill it directly, it would be fatal for Meng Qi and the demon Buddha who were both heavily injured and in the fierce battle!</p><p>If Meng Qi died, the efforts of the three pure ones to reduce and search for space would be reduced to nothing, and there would be no chance to transcend this era!</p><p>If the demon Buddha died and Meng Qi did not continue, and the Numinous Treasure did not return, the destruction and end of the world that it symbolized would be transferred to the gold emperor, allowing this lifeless mother to fully grasp the power of the end of the world and occupy the right time, place, and people.., as for Gu Xiaosang, she cultivated both infinity and end. Once she reached the other shore, just like the Golden Emperor in the past, she would be infinitely close to the embryonic form of the dao fruit. With a slight opportunity, she would step into the ranks of the ancient people, allowing the Golden Emperor to obtain the dao fruit and truly transcend.</p><p>As for Amitabha, who had also benefited, he was weakened to a certain extent at this moment. At the last critical moment, he would be a step slower. The other ancient people who were worth paying attention to were also famous for their six soul flags.</p><p>He had been giving in step by step, wanting to take the initiative and give it to them first. He had been refining it for many years, and today was the opportunity to take it back!</p><p>The gold emperor was elegant and indifferent. There was not a hint of acquired emotions in his eyes. Facing the six soul flags and the dim light, he bowed solemnly once again!</p><p>I knew that the Heavenly Lord of Numinous Treasure was using me, and I also knew that they would have ways to restrain themselves. However, some things, when used at the right time, at the right place, and with the right target, would always come to heaven and earth at the same time to break free from the hidden dangers, the situation was difficult to control!</p><p>One thing was always mutually beneficial. You used me, and I used you!</p><p>The Golden Emperor bowed, and the wails of ghosts and gods suddenly surged. The dim light carrying the blurry sword and the six soul banner shook at the same time.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The old fusang tree in the darkness that the Devil Buddha had turned into exploded inch by inch. Its leaves withered one after another, and its bark was mottled. It had lost most of its vitality, and had blocked the fatal blow for the Devil Buddha. However, it also whimpered and rapidly shrank, it returned to the depths and had no more strength left.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Meng Qi’s glabella split open, and a Dao Yi glass lamp that could not be described by color flew out. The black and white flames lit up everything in the surroundings, illuminating a pitch-black, deadly pitch-black that looked like a sword ray or a curse.</p><p>He did not have the time to defend and could not pull out his hand to defend. Meng Qi’s heart moved, and he activated the ’cause of all consequences’.</p><p>As the cause and effect changed, the deadly pitch-black immediately shot toward a chaotic green lotus seed in the Dark Pool of the hollow jade temple through some inexplicable connection.</p><p>This was the chaotic green lotus seed that he used to nurture the blood of Haotian.</p><p>When the gold emperor broke through the hollow jade temple of Kunlun Mountain, this thing had escaped because of the extremely high nature of the blood of Haotian. However, it did not catch the eye of the gold emperor, so it was picked up by the great green root that went back to rummage through the ruins and returned to the real hollow jade temple.</p><p>According to the demon saint’s advice, after figuring out that the root of the demon Buddha was Haotian’s God, he quietly merged his own aura into it as a backup measure to prevent the demon Buddha from having other secrets that would cause him to tie himself up in a cocoon.</p><p>At this moment, the aura was pulling and the cause of all the fruits was rotating. The Curse of the six soul banner immediately shifted to the chaotic green lotus seed and fell into Meng Qi’s merged aura and the blood of Haotian’s God!</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Cracks appeared on Meng Qi’s original incipient God true body as he spat out drops of golden blood. Each drop contained a vast universe. In the depths of the darkness, the Devil Buddha let out a world-shaking scream:</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>The Scream was filled with hatred for Meng Qi that was engraved in his bones and pain that he was unwilling to accept.</p><p>It was not easy for him to rely on the fusang ancient tree to block the killing tribulation. However, he was inexplicably hit again. His devil body immediately collapsed and his true spirit dissipated. A bit of his innate spiritual light barely supported him.</p><p>Damn the gold emperor! Damn the cause of all the consequences!</p><p>Meng Qi knew that the follow-up was not finished, and there was a similar curse. The green lotus seed of chaos had been destroyed, and there was no “One”to share half of it with him. At this time, if he did not want to rely on others to save him, the only way was to completely defeat the demon Buddha.., by merging with his remaining will of eradication and completely recovering his injuries, he would be able to raise himself to the level of an ancient. At that time, he would be able to take it head-on!</p><p>Enduring the heavy injuries, he went deep into the final darkness that the Devil Buddha had turned into, searching for his little bit of spiritual light of his nature. His surroundings were pitch black. There was no passage of time, no boundary separating the void. Under the circumstances where the power of the heaven opening seal had greatly decreased.., it was as if he had stepped into a swamp. He had taken the initiative to jump into a trap. For a moment, he had been continuously met with destruction, termination, freezing, filth, and corruption. If it were not for the Overlord Saber and the Three Treasures Ruyi protecting his body, he would still be essentially entangled with the Devil Buddha, unable to recover from his injuries, he would most likely be in danger of dying.</p><p>With a thought, the boat of Doomsday, which had fused with Ksitigarbha’s pure land, passed through layers of space and time and appeared in the darkness of Doomsday. It gave Meng Qi a place to stand and better search for the spiritual light of the Devil Buddha’s hidden nature.</p><p>The boat of Doomsday was originally refined for this kind of situation. Now that it had been upgraded, with the protection of the Three Treasures Ruyi, the Overlord Blade opening a path, and the darkness that the Devil Buddha had transformed into, after all, was not the true end of all things. It was lacking a little bit of fire.., it barely managed to stabilize itself in this destructive void and moved forward quickly.</p><p>..</p><p>Many eras ago, when the heavens and earth were created, the heavenly venerate of virtue, Amitabha, their incarnations, avatars, and avatars all trembled. They opened their mouths and spat out a dark fire, dissolving the power of the six soul banner.</p><p>They even left the six soul banner to the Golden Emperor? Amitabha’s thoughts fluctuated. Not only did he not turn back to attack mother Wusheng, but he also held onto the heavenly venerate of virtue, not giving him a chance to save Meng Qi.</p><p>The six soul banner was only slightly weakened to Amitabha. As long as Amitabha did not hold on for too long, it would not be a problem for Amitabha to take two or three hits head-on. However, there was a high possibility that Amitabha could kill Su Meng and break the hope of the three Purities Dao fruit. Amitabha had no choice but to help Amitabha!</p><p>The golden emperor had maliciously weakened Amitabha, but Amitabha had no choice but to help the Golden Emperor Stop the heavenly venerate of virtue. This was the advantage of having the upper hand!</p><p>..</p><p>The seven treasures magical tree brushed down and brushed away the black golden spear with Phoenix Wings that was trying to reach the hollow jade temple. Bodhi ancient Buddha blocked demon saint’s rescue. Then, both of them spat out a dark flame. Each of them had a lower aura, but demon Saint had more.</p><p>“The Golden Emperor has done so much, but you still want to help him, fellow Daoist?”Demon Saint thought and shook the void.</p><p>Bodhi ancient Buddha smiled bitterly and said, “If you don’t help, fellow Daoist Su Meng will become an old man, and fellow Daoist three pure ones will immediately transcend. We have no more hope. If we block them, we can still fight against them and fellow Daoist Golden Emperor. We can fish in troubled waters. But why do you want to help Su Meng? Aren’t you afraid that you will cut off the path of the Demon Emperor’s Dao Fruit?”</p><p>Clear light flashed, and strange colors flew everywhere. He brushed away the demon Saint Spear again.</p><p>“There must be a next era. Only when the humans and demons successfully survive the end of the tribulation and live to the next era can I become a true old man. Only then can the demon Emperor completely transcend. His destiny in the next era has no conflict with you, and neither does it have any conflict with heavenly venerate three purities.”Demon saint thrust out his spear again, at the same time, the Human Emperor Sword and the Heaven, earth, mountain, and river painting were brought out. However, the demon emperor in his current state was unable to make a move personally. The moment he made a move, he would be tainted by all kinds of karmic connections, and he would clash with the current “Demon Emperor”as to who was real and who was fake, this would cause all the previous efforts to be wasted.</p><p>Demon saint benefited from the fact that he was the first Phoenix that was born during the creation of the world. It was very easy for him to go back in time to ancient times. It was the same for him to replace the demon Emperor and absorb the brand. Therefore, he had the feeling of an ancient being, but his dao fruit was relatively lacking, he had to protect the humans and demons to survive the apocalypse before they could take shape. Therefore, Meng Qi, who had the tree of Great Dao as the key to the apocalypse, had no choice but to save him. However, the Bodhi ancient Buddha was a genuine ancient being. Even if there were problems with the three corpses, demon saint would not be able to break through in a short period of time.</p><p>..</p><p>A few battlefields fought fiercely. Green Emperor tried his best to suppress the backlash and recover, but he was still far from attacking.</p><p>..</p><p>On Changmen Island in the East Sea, looking in the direction of the hollow jade temple, he suddenly took out the beautiful landscape map and pulled up the remaining islands to protect the living beings. Then, he flew toward the clear Jade Palace and the doomsday boat to merge with it, he wanted to improve its nature so that he could pass the doomsday in the future and find the remaining spiritual light of the Devil Buddha’s nature as soon as possible.</p><p>In the Devil World with only a few fragments left, Qi Zhengyan tapped the four stars between his eyebrows, revealing his blood-red true form. He merged with the enlightened beings into a torrent and rushed toward the hollow jade temple. He also wanted to merge with the ship of the apocalypse, so that he could pass the final tribulation together, he was so proud that he had given up on the past feud and united his front to overcome the destruction together!</p><p>When they each gave a little help, a ray of white light lit up, illuminating the darkness and the broken universe. Gu Xiaosang finally broke through the final obstacle and proved the second type of abnormal phenomenon on the other side: illuminating all directions!</p><p>..</p><p>However, all of this help was either too little or too late. Facing the Golden Emperor of the banner of six souls, his figure was elegant and dignified, and the embryonic form of the Dao fruit on his head was a little dim, but he resolutely bowed again!</p><p>With this bow, the Devil Buddha would die, and Meng Qi would die!</p><p>At this moment, in a secret place, Han Guang, who was watching the battle with the anxious Lu Ya, suddenly changed his expression. He saw the Bodhi magical tree in his hand fly up by itself, completely ignoring his own imprinted self!</p><p>The Bodhi light spun, and the glass was clear as it sprinkled down. This wonderful tree flew into the real world and was suddenly grabbed by a faint golden Buddha that appeared high in the sky. It swiped down fiercely towards his home in the vacuum, towards the banner of six souls, towards the golden emperor.., the grand and solemn chanting of sutras could be heard without end.</p><p>Near the Hollow Jade Temple, the Supreme True Buddha, who was fighting with Lord Daoist Qingyuan, suddenly trembled. He was even more terrified than when he encountered the shell of a golden cicada or the remains of the three treasures of the Tang dynasty.</p><p>Buddha!</p><p>The Buddha who defeated the demon Buddha Ananda at a critical moment!</p><p>The only transcendent who had a record of attacking!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
