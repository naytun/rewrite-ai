Sitting cross-legged was a golden Buddha of ancient wisdom. The twenty-four Buddhist lights behind his head overlapped layer upon layer, reflecting each other’s brilliance. The faint golden light was flawless, and it was holy and solemn, in his palm was an ancient glazed lamp that contained many meanings of cause and effect, as if it had existed since long ago.</p><p>At this moment, the eyes of this ancient Golden Buddha were not as deep and calm as before. They were filled with despair, frustration, frustration, and unwillingness. They were about to turn into inner demons and destroy the eternal cultivation.</p><p>“Sigh…”burning lamp let out a long sigh and spat out the turbid qi and demons in his heart. He allowed the glass lamp to burn them, eliminating the negative condensation in his body.</p><p>Su Meng had already reached the other shore and become one of the major figures who dominated the ups and downs of the myriad worlds in the heavens. His thoughts of the “Cause and effect”had completely vanished. He could only hope that the major figures on the other shore would compete against each other, he was no longer able to control his fate in his hands.</p><p>He had only cultivated for a few hundred years and was able to break through successive obstacles and break free from the sea of bitterness. Even if the end of the tribulation was approaching, the heavens and earth would loosen up, and the reason for the circulation of Dao Charm was due to the plans of the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning, the heavenly venerate of morals, the Golden Emperor, and the other ancient figures, it could not conceal his own brilliance, his own personality, and his own spirit and determination. Only in this way could he traverse the sky and illuminate the heavens.</p><p>Compared to him, he, who had lived from the immemorial era to the current era and enlightened the Buddha, appeared too hesitant and timid. When the opportunity presented itself, he did not dare to suppress all the possibilities. This was the reason why he was able to survive until now, however, it was also a shackle that restrained him from taking that important step, causing his cultivation base to be thrown away for hundreds of millions of years.</p><p>Looking back on the past, it was not that he did not have the opportunity to get rid of Su Meng in advance. It was because he was weighing the pros and cons, because he was cautious, and because he did not want to risk his life. He could only watch Su Meng grow step by step with jealousy and hatred, after being said by the devil Buddha, “When you make a decision, you will constantly suffer the consequences.”Only then did he slowly change this mindset. Until now, he had completely understood:</p><p>There were many things in the world that were not 100% certain. It involved the key to breaking free from the sea of bitterness and reaching the other shore. There was a 20% chance that it was time to take a gamble!</p><p>Just as burning lamp thought about it, boundless light suddenly burst out from the sky above the Pure Land, illuminating every Bodhi tree, every Brahma flower, every Buddhist temple, and every monk.</p><p>“Amitabha from the south.”Burning lamp pressed his palms together and greeted Buddha respectfully.</p><p>The person who came was Amitabha, the Lord of the Western Paradise World and the leader of the two saints of Buddhism. He had boundless light and boundless lifespan.</p><p>The clear glass light submerged the sea of clouds and carried an ancient Buddha that was faintly visible. The light around his body gathered and condensed into a round of perfect and flawless Buddha light.</p><p>“Almsgiver Su, you have already reached the other shore and escaped from the Sea of suffering. Are you still unable to let go of the obsession in Your Heart?”Amitabha’s solemn and grand voice was like a twilight drum and morning bell. It shook Burning Lamp’s golden body, and all the past seemed to collapse along with it, today, all sorts of positive things were born.</p><p>Can you let go of it?</p><p>Can you let go of the “Cause and effect”that you have been bitterly waiting for for an era?</p><p>Even now, do you still want to pursue that illusory hope?</p><p>Do you still want to bitterly wait until the end of the era?</p><p>The burning lamp seemed to have realized something. His golden body stood up and solemnly bowed. “Amitabha, thank you for receiving Buddha’s warning.”</p><p>Amitabha’s voice reverberated in the pure land, “If you don’t put down your obsession, how can you see the Tathagata in your heart? You are so obsessed with the results that you can’t achieve anything. Your eyes are covered with a miasma. Today, when you turn back and look, if you put down this matter when you ascend to godhood and become a Buddhist, and wholeheartedly cultivate the ‘great dream true scripture’or the ‘Tathagata divine palm’, will it be lower than Maitreya? Will you have a chance to escape from the Sea of suffering?”</p><p>“It is not too late to become a Buddha on the spot. There are still hundreds of years before the end of the epoch. Almsgiver su, if you can do it, why can’t You?”</p><p>Upon hearing Amitabha’s words, the lamp lit up as if it was reflecting the obsession of the past. Half of it was filled with a bitter smile and helplessness.</p><p>Other than enlightening himself and eliminating the obsession in his heart, he also needed to use the illusory “Karma and dao fruit”that he was just a little bit away from completing to resolve the hatred between him and the primordial Lord of Heaven, Su Meng!</p><p>Previously, he was worried that he would be made difficult and targeted by the new primordial Lord of Heaven in the future, so he could only stay in the Pure Land and rely on protection. Who knew that before he could even make a move, Amitabha had already asked him to put down the Karma Dao, there wasn’t even the possibility of escaping.</p><p>This was the person on the other side, this was a high and mighty figure.</p><p>That’s right. The primordial Lord of Heaven, Su Meng, had cut off his path of cultivation, so there was no hope of him transcending this era. There was no longer any competition for the Great Dao with Amitabha, the heavenly lord of virtue, the Golden Emperor, and other ancient people. Many things could be eased and they could work together.</p><p>Although the strike of the primordial Lord of Heaven, Su Meng, had cut off his hope of attaining the Dao, it had also cut off countless variables and created the best situation for himself.</p><p>Burning lamp was silent for a long time before he finally let out a long sigh. It was as if he had spat out the obsession that had haunted him in the past:</p><p>“Amitabha of the south, what should I do?”</p><p>Amitabha’s compassionate and grand voice rang out again. “If I do not break, I will not establish myself. I will use this nirvana golden body to put aside the past, cut out the path of karma, and reincarnate in the Elysium World. I will wholeheartedly cultivate the Buddhist dharma and become the Buddha of the future. I will not be pure, unsullied, and will not increase or decrease.”</p><p>Burning Lamp revealed his last bitter smile and left his helplessness in this world. Then, he sat in the lotus position, closed his eyes, and formed the Nirvana seal with his hands. His smile became empty, full of pure and merciful intent.</p><p>He recited in a low voice,</p><p>“If I attain bodhi, I will illuminate all the worlds in the heavens, past, future, between the ages…”</p><p>A wave of glazed golden fire rose from his body and burned quietly, refining the golden body and swallowing the lamp. The chanting of Buddhist sutras around him did not stop, and flowers fell from the sky.</p><p>When everything calmed down, a bit of glazed light was thrown into the palm of the ancient and quiet Buddha high up in the sky. It entered the Elysium World, bathed in the water of the eight treasures merit pool, and turned into an ordinary monk with a weak aura.</p><p>In the center of the Pure Land Buddhist kingdom, where the burning lamp sat cross-legged, there was a dripping sarira. It was black and white, and the light was flowing. It was complex and peaceful.</p><p>The Buddhist light in the sky disappeared, and the Sarira jumped up. It passed through layers of time and space and fell into the Buddhist kingdom on the ground. It landed in Maitreya’s palm, which had a fat golden body.</p><p>Looking at the sarira, the smiling Maitreya suddenly sighed. Then, he jumped up and escaped to the hollow jade temple.</p><p>After passing through layers of darkness, time seemed to have stopped. An ancient yellow palace finally appeared in front of Maitreya. The eaves of the palace hung with the aura of virtue like a true dragon. It was noble and noble, and the red door was closed tightly, there were 365 golden nails inlaid. Around the palace, there were nine ancient wells on each of the three sides that could be seen. The bottom of the well could not be seen, and it was surrounded by jade railings. It was full of solemnity, and twenty-four of them were emitting strange lights, it was a dreamy and hazy scene.</p><p>It was not Maitreya’s first time coming to the hollow jade temple, but when he saw that the Higan Daoist rite had regained its vigor and became more and more profound, he could not help but sigh in his heart, and a deep sense of reverence was suppressed in his heart.</p><p>This was still the other shore Daoist rite temple. The people living inside were still high and mighty figures!</p><p>He walked to the front door and saw a strange-shaped plant. Its entire body was green and its branches were swaying.</p><p>“Please report back to the Celestial Master. Maitreya has come to seek an audience.”Maitreya did not dare to be negligent. He put his palms together and bowed.</p><p>The great green root had never received such a grand ceremony from the leader of a region, the future Buddha. The entire plant was floating in the air and was about to ascend to immortality. It coughed and said arrogantly, “Bodhisattva, please wait a moment.”</p><p>Regardless of the state, Maitreya’s current position was still that of the great bodhisattva.</p><p>It turned around and stepped into the hollow jade temple. After waiting for a while, it strolled out and said,</p><p>“The sect master wants you to enter.”</p><p>Maitreya nodded slightly and watched as the vermillion door slowly opened before him. He stepped in and headed deeper into the hollow jade temple.</p><p>The great green root smiled secretly and led the way. It was extremely satisfied. The order just now had actually been given long before Maitreya arrived.</p><p>One after another, the doors opened. Maitreya passed through the halls and finally arrived in front of the jade pure palace. He saw a dense, dark, and heavy mist. A round, clear light seemed to be hanging in the sky, he could vaguely see the green trees and fruits that were covered in clear light. He could also see the long saber that was flickering with purple lightning and the Ruyi that was purple, white, and green gold. At the same time, he could vaguely see an ancient, dignified figure.</p><p>A true celestial master, a true nirvana… Maitreya secretly shivered. He restrained his emotions, suppressed his fear and awe, and put his palms together to salute:</p><p>“Greetings, Celestial Master.”</p><p>Yesterday, the two sides were still at the same level, but today, the difference was like the sky and the Abyss.</p><p>“No need for formalities.”A lofty and dignified voice came from the Jade Clear Hall.</p><p>Maitreya didn’t dare to waste his breath. He took out the sarira that was flowing with black and white light and said solemnly,</p><p>“I regret receiving Buddha’s knowledge of the cause of the celestial venerable’s fruits. I have instructed me to deliver this item. I hope it can resolve the previous grudges.”</p><p>After saying that, he held his breath and waited for a reply. His heart was slightly perturbed. If the original originator celestial venerable Su Meng did not accept this item and end the previous cause, then there was almost no hope for him to ascend to the other shore.</p><p>After waiting for a while, he heard a distant voice coming from the Jade Clear Palace:</p><p>“The matter of the past, receiving fellow Daoist is just a threat. There is no need to care so much.”</p><p>As soon as he said that, Maitreya saw the sarira fly out from his hand and fall into the bright circle of light, landing on the hazy green tree.</p><p>With a boom, the light in front of his eyes suddenly shone brightly. The world became illusory, filled with bright star lines. The background was only black and white. Outside the Jade Void Palace, the remaining twelve ancient wells were also emitting strange lights.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
