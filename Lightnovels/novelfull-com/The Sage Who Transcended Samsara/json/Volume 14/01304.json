They were ignited by the dao one glass lamp, dividing and reassembling, endlessly deducing all sorts of possibilities.</p><p>When the complexity in the depths of his eyes finally came to a stop, Meng Qi’s right palm completely pressed down, spreading out in a daze and completely enveloping the two stone slabs. At first, one could still see the flickering light in the darkness and the changing of the symbols. But after a few moments.., everything disappeared without a sound, as if it had merged into the chaos. Even the stone slabs themselves could not be found at all, revealing the majestic steps down.</p><p>At this moment, a ray of light with a grayish luster hacked out without any warning. It was heavy and sharp, giving one the feeling of a giant axe going against the heavens. It broke through the darkness and divided the chaos. It was as if the world had been reborn at this moment!</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Amidst the clanging of metal, the gray stone pillar stopped moving. The light dissipated and revealed an ancient and mottled stone axe. It was pressed down by Meng Qi’s giant pale golden right hand and blocked in front of him.</p><p>Drops of spiritual blood slid down from where the axe came into contact with the palm. Countless rules manifested within it, forming a world that disintegrated one after another.</p><p>The person holding the stone axe was a headless giant. The position of his breasts had become his eyes and his navel had become his mouth. His will was so strong that it became a reality. He condensed a mottled and terrifying stone axe. It was none other than the ancient powerhouse Xing Tian.</p><p>“It’s been a long time since I’ve suffered such external injuries. Unfortunately, with the passing of time and the erosion of time, you are less than 20% of your peak condition. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be just a flesh wound.”Meng Qi held the axe with his right hand and looked at Xing Tian with a sigh, the darkness that had been split apart rolled back and condensed into a cloud-like point of chaos once again.</p><p>The chaos spread and drowned Xing Tian. His strong will rushed left and right, absorbing waves and ripples. However, in the end, he returned to his original state silently.</p><p>There was something strange about the reincarnation here. Meng Qi gave up on capturing Xingtian alive. Instead, he assimilated with the infinite, hoping to read a few memory fragments.</p><p>Darkness, the darkness that would never change, the darkness that had nothing. Strangely, this was the only scene in Xingtian’s memory fragments.</p><p>Just as Meng Qi was about to melt the stone axe formed by Xingtian’s will and merge it into the heaven-opening seal, the darkness suddenly collapsed, revealing a pair of indifferent and majestic eyes. It made people involuntarily submit, swearing to obey his orders.</p><p>Everything passed in the blink of an eye, and Meng Qi heard the rueful voice of the nine heavens mystical maiden Liu Luo:</p><p>“Indeed, the heaven opening and the boundless.”</p><p>Xing Tian’s axe just now had an obvious intent to open the heaven, condensing into an illusory great dao that could break through Meng Qi’s boundless intent and hurt his original body. However, due to the consumption of splitting the chaos and the body of the eight-nine arcane art.., it only caused a flesh wound.</p><p>Meng Qi was not surprised by this. Although the primordial Lord of Heaven had the purest and most powerful heaven opening seal, it did not prevent others from comprehending similar dao. Just like when he himself was at the Qionghua banquet before practicing the first three seals, through no word of the monument to realize a form of “Heaven and earth”knife.</p><p>Even if it is unique, such as “Cause and effect”, others can approach it by practicing other cause and effect exercises, only because someone takes the place can not achieve the illusory dao fruit.</p><p>There was an obvious wound on Meng Qi’s right palm that was bleeding. It was wriggling rapidly and was instantly restored to its original state. Streams of light pierced through his palm and merged into the ‘Pangu Banner’shadow inside his Niwan.</p><p>“As expected, something is sleeping inside.”His aura was concealed as if it was invisible. After saying that, he quietly fled into the deep hole that was surging with colorful lights.</p><p>Liu Luo pondered for a moment and also cast a divine ability to make himself seem as if he had disappeared. Then, he followed Meng Qi and cautiously descended.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, the multi-colored lights became bright again. They revolved around and formed a huge millstone or a crazy vortex, completely blocking all directions.</p><p>Streams of light continuously poured into the millstone, and the core of the Millstone was bottomless. It was dark and difficult to see, as if it was leading to a different path of reincarnation.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Liu Luo’s expression was slightly solemn. “Water element, fire element, light, burning, drowning, Void, life, death, filth, fate, Yin Virtue…”</p><p>The streams of light that were revolving corresponded to different illusory concepts, like broken authority, Split Great Dao, like the blue and black light that symbolized the water element, the pure white light that symbolized light, and the vibrant green of life, the silent darkness that symbolized death, the pale white flowing colors that symbolized yin virtue..</p><p>“No wonder…”Meng Qi nodded slightly. He understood why the six ancestral dragons and the other Old Gods and ghosts were only empty shells.</p><p>This place was constantly absorbing their physical strength, residual authority, illusory great dao, and the spiritual light of their respective natures. It was crushed in the way of a millstone, poured into an unknown place, and entered reincarnation, because Xing Tian was killed and then resurrected with his will, he dismembered his body before he became a soup, received incense, and achieved the path of ghosts and gods. They were all similar to dead things, so they could barely be preserved. After each cycle of reincarnation, they returned to their own bodies, this slowed down the disappearance of their power.</p><p>It was also because of this that they were quietly planted with a loyal and self-destructive will during the cycle of reincarnation.</p><p>“The Celestial Emperor made this arrangement to nurture and strengthen something?”A divine light flashed in Liu Luo’s eyes as she looked into the depths of the illusory millstone. There was a faint black dot floating there.</p><p>As she looked, the Qi pulled and the black dot slowly rose.</p><p>Meng Qi, who was beside her, sensed a familiar feeling. It was the “Enemy”he had faced many times!</p><p>He said in a deep voice, “The effect of the reincarnation seal is still here.”</p><p>“You mean, before Ananda obtained the reincarnation seal, he hid here?”Liu Luo’s tone was slightly fluctuating.</p><p>What this meant was self-evident!</p><p>Empress Hou Tu had a secret conversation with the Heavenly Emperor, and after achieving the other shore, the reincarnation seal was placed in the hands of the Heavenly Emperor. It was unknown what he was planning by placing it here!</p><p>“I suspect that the reincarnation seal in Ah Nan’s hands was obtained from here.”Meng Qi looked solemnly at the black dot that slowly floated up.</p><p>This could also explain why the immortal realm’s heavenly prison remained in the aftermath of the other shore, and the reincarnation seal was secretly protected here!</p><p>At first, he thought that some important figure had other plans, but the era ended immediately. Therefore, he secretly cooperated with the Celestial Emperor and hid the immortal realm’s heavenly prison, leaving hope for the Celestial Emperor to resurrect, but now, it seemed that this was not the case.</p><p>“Could it be that the betrayal of the thunder god was just a feint? The heavenly emperor calculated that he would face such a calamity, so he deliberately arranged it this way. When the Heavenly Court fell, the Thunder God would complete the resurrection. Therefore, the reincarnation seal would recognize the thunder god as its master…” Liu Luo boldly said this guess based on his understanding of the Heavenly Court’s gods.</p><p>Meng Qi frowned. “We can’t rule out this possibility.”</p><p>This could explain why Ah Nan betrayed the Spirit Mountain and demon saint. As a result, the power of the Buddhist league and the demon race was greatly damaged, even Amitabha, ancient Bodhi Buddha, Demon Emperor, and demon saint should have suffered heavy injuries from each other’s battle. They either jumped out of the river of time and fell into a deep sleep, or fought with injuries. They fought with the human emperor and eventually died in meditation, therefore, the only obstacles to the heavenly emperor’s resurrection were the primordial beginning heavenly venerate and the moral heavenly venerate, which were the enemies that Ananda said could not be fought against at that time.</p><p>Therefore, he chose to degenerate into a demon to reach the other shore.</p><p>If that was the case, this was true love! Meng Qi almost cursed in his heart. He simply could not imagine that he was such a demon Buddha Ananda.</p><p>However, according to this conjecture, why was Ananda’s phantom image scared off just now?</p><p>The black dot floated up and gradually became bigger. It was actually a body. It wore a crown on its head and a black robe. It was filled with ghostly qi and floated in reincarnation. The illusory Great Dao and authority that were crushed by the millstone fused into it, a terrifying feeling came crashing into his face.</p><p>“The clone of the Celestial Emperor!”Liu Luo was definitely not unfamiliar with this. He blurted out, extremely solemn, “This is the body of the ghost emperor that was refined and nurtured!”</p><p>This was the Heavenly Emperor’s backup plan to revive him? Just as Meng Qi was about to speak, he saw this terrifying body open its eyes. It was indifferent and majestic, making people want to submit.</p><p>Qing Yun flew out to resist the influence. Meanwhile, monstrous death qi and demonic intent suddenly rushed out from the eyes of the Heavenly Emperor’s clone and the body of the ghost emperor, almost covering the past, present, and future.</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi saw layers of Buddhist light sealing spells appear around its body. They surrounded the three ruyi phantoms of purple, white, gold, and green, suppressing the attack that was ready to be launched.</p><p>This familiar scene and the demonic intent emitted by the Ghost Emperor’s body made Meng Qi blurt out,</p><p>“The Celestial Emperor’s avatar has already been taken over by the Devil Buddha Dove!”</p><p>His previous guess was instantly overturned!</p><p>..</p><p>In the void at the highest level of the ninth heaven, the ancient Buddha Burning Lamp, who had been scared off by the “Celestial Emperor’s patrol”, was searching for clues. However, the distance between the two parties had already widened, and the void engulfed the rest. Everything was empty.</p><p>Suddenly, Ah Nan’s illusory figure, who was sitting cross-legged in the perfected Buddha light of burning lamp ancient Buddha, suddenly turned his head and looked at a certain spot as if he had sensed something.</p><p>“Is There Something Wrong?”Burning lamp ancient Buddha asked.</p><p>Ah Nan’s illusory figure revealed a smile:</p><p>“I know where they are.”</p><p>“They are actually following the big dipper emperor chariot…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
