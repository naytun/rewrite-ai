Meanwhile, the illusion of the three treasures ruyi emitted the aura of virtue, saint virtue, and virtue, it suppressed all the changes in the body’s Qi dynamics. Even though there were all kinds of profound and subtle changes, it was still difficult to penetrate and infiltrate the outside world.</p><p>“The Thunder God still betrayed the celestial emperor…”witnessing this scene, the nine heavens mystical maiden luoluo could not help but sigh.</p><p>Along the way, the other story told by the various arrangements still had the same ending.</p><p>However, if not for this, Su Meng and he would probably have to deal with the awakened Celestial Emperor’s avatar now. Even if he did not have the Nirvana realm, it was still quite dangerous, and it might even cause a chain reaction.., to resurrect the fallen celestial emperor — after the Devil Buddha dove occupied the magpie’s nest, the seal of the Buddha and the primordial Lord of Heaven would naturally affect this body.</p><p>Of course, as the great god of the ancient Heavenly Court, Liuluo was secretly looking forward to this situation. As long as the clone of the Celestial Emperor still had intelligence, it would be able to get along well after it woke up. However, he never expected that the thunder god would be so ruthless, it was as if he wanted to break all of the Heavenly Emperor’s backup plans, causing her hopes to turn into nothing as she sighed in disappointment.</p><p>Meng Qi quietly looked at the heavenly emperor’s avatar and suddenly laughed, “The thunder god, this thick-browed and big-eyed fellow, is really a traitor in his bones. I roughly understand why he was scared off when he saw the Big Dipper Sovereign.”</p><p>Hearing this.., liu Luo’s heart moved slightly as he said, “The Devil Buddha took over this devil emperor’s body because he wanted to break all of the Heavenly Emperor’s backup plans, causing him to completely fall and have no chance of revival. However, after he really implemented it, he discovered that the heavenly emperor did not only set up this place. A crafty rabbit has three burrows and has another opportunity. Therefore, after he was scared by me and witnessed the Big Dipper Sovereign’s ride, he felt that it was possible that the real heavenly emperor had relied on other preparations to return and retreated with a guilty conscience.”</p><p>Meng Qi clapped his hands and smiled, “Your Highness is right. I wonder if you have any clues about the Heavenly Emperor’s other plan?”</p><p>A bitter smile appeared on Liu Luo’s face, “If I knew the clues, I wouldn’t be shocked along the way. When the heavenly emperor protected us from the fall of the heavenly court, he only told us one thing.”</p><p>“What is it?”Meng Qi looked over.</p><p>Luoluo pursed his lips. “If the human emperor is born, I will help him!”</p><p>The human emperor could not be the reincarnation of the heavenly emperor. At that time, the Moral Celestial Master could directly interfere with the matters of the real world, so how could he not notice… Meng Qi thought about it, and his thoughts clashed with each other, stimulating the spark of inspiration, however, he still could not understand it. His gaze returned to the huge millstone that was constantly crushing the illusory authority, and the depths of the core that was hard to see.</p><p>Then, he extended his right hand. The face of his palm was like a mirror, absorbing all the light. It was pitch-black and deep, reflecting the specific void structure of this arrangement.</p><p>All colors flew, and the illusory path interfered. With reference to the Void Seal ABHIJNA derived from the supreme heavenly mirror, one could only vaguely see layers of death and subtle reincarnation.</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi turned his head and smiled at Liuluo:</p><p>“As long as I don’t touch the avatar of the Celestial Emperor and try to open the seal around him, no matter how this place changes, it can’t affect the enchantment and the things that the original body is suppressing on the spiritual mountain.”</p><p>What kind of experience and knowledge did Liu Luo have? He immediately asked back,</p><p>“What do you want to Do?”</p><p>Meng Qi said leisurely,</p><p>“Use the infinite tolerance to absorb these broken authorities, tear down the reincarnation arrangement of this place, and peek at the secret in the depths of his heart.”</p><p>As he spoke, the pitch-black mirror on his right palm rippled like water and collapsed layer by layer. Soon, it formed a darkness that was like a dot, like a cloud, and contained all things.</p><p>As his palm pressed down, the remaining multi-colored light seemed to have covered the light veil of chaos. It trembled continuously and slowly broke away from the suction force and restraint of the Millstone Vortex. It spread out and headed towards the point of infinity, slowly disappearing within, it seemed to have been assimilated.</p><p>Rays of light rose. There was the power of the ancestral dragon that could overturn rivers and overturn seas, and the power of the great water that could destroy the world. There was the power of the nine flames that could burn the sky, and the power of the sun that shone with light. All of them were thrown over and disintegrated, returning to their original state.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The entire gigantic millstone trembled, and its own body shook violently. Slowly, cracks began to appear.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The illusory millstone shattered, turning into countless rays of light that returned to the infinite, returned to the chaos, returned to Meng Qi’s right palm, and perfected the various dao intents that he had comprehended.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The vortex completely dissipated, and layers of dense fog surged out crazily. However, as the infinite dim light shone down, everything was contained by the chaos, without the slightest fluctuation.</p><p>Meng Qi did not know when, but a tree branch that was emitting a hazy clear light had appeared in his left hand. The excess broken authority and illusory Great Dao were like the water of the Milky Way. They could not help but flow over and were completely absorbed by it.</p><p>The tree of Great Dao was also known as the “Epoch.”Of course, he had to seize the opportunity to “Feed”it!</p><p>When the will of Chaos withdrew, the abnormal changes in the depths of the vortex calmed down. The scene there was vaguely presented in Meng Qi and Liu Luo’s eyes.</p><p>It was a desolate land with the howling of the cold wind. It spread over billions of calamities, and there was no end to it. At the core stood a pitch-black mountain. It was as if the illusory death and the will of ghosts had condensed into a corporeal form. It was the source of the ghosts and ghosts.</p><p>This mountain was divided into six layers. The turbid intent was deep, and layers of forbidden spells were born naturally. They formed an impenetrable barrier of the path of ghosts, which was dense and terrifying.</p><p>When Meng Qi’s gaze landed on this pitch-black mountain, a pair of indescribable eyes suddenly appeared in his mind. They were cold and sinister, and they hardened his body, corroding his body layer by layer.</p><p>Clang! Clang!</p><p>The blades and swords cried out in unison. The absolute blade and the scarlet sword burst out with light at the same time. The chaotic light around Meng Qi’s body slowly revolved, dispelling the terrifying will that was projected over. Dao Yi, Liu Li, and the others tilted their flames, burning off the connection.</p><p>Their eyes met, and he and Liu Luo spoke at the same time:</p><p>“Xuan Ming Ghost Emperor!”</p><p>“Luo Feng’s black prison!”</p><p>The tyrannical will that the pair of eyes represented was none other than the Xuan Ming Ghost Emperor that Meng Qi had once interacted with, the false shore of the nine Netherworlds!</p><p>— Luo Feng’s world, the Black Prison’s world, and the River Styx were the source of death, Slumber, darkness, and ghosts in the nine Netherworlds. The former two were now Xuan Ming Ghost Emperor’s training grounds.</p><p>The reincarnation arrangement at the bottom of the immortal realm’s heavenly prison had actually secretly linked Luo Feng and black prison together!</p><p>Then, when he thought about how the Heavenly Emperor had created a clone with the body of the Ghost Emperor, the truth of the matter was obvious.</p><p>“Back then, the Heavenly Emperor had set up this place with the reincarnation seal as the core and the Old Gods and ghosts that had been suppressed over the years as a supplement. He probably wanted to bypass the ancient Hades, where the two sects of Buddhism and Taoism had been deeply involved, and use the body of the ghost emperor to unify Luo Feng and black prison. Then, he had crossed the sky and the sea to establish a real afterlife, a world that only belonged to himself after death. Then, with the help of this, he had formed the embryonic form of the dao fruit. Unfortunately, the reincarnation seal was taken away by the Devil Buddha and took over the body of the Ghost Emperor. The middle path of this matter collapsed.” Based on what he knew and heard, he quickly made a judgment, and his heart was filled with an inexplicable melancholy.</p><p>As the Great God who presided over the Heavenly Court’s expedition, he actually did not know any of this!</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly and said, “It seems that the so-called resurrection arrangement of the clone is just a side effect. Of course, it’s also possible that the body of the ghost emperor is just a feint. The remnant spirit of the Heavenly Emperor might have already colluded with Luo Feng and black prison through the will of reincarnation. I don’t know where he reincarnated to, and I also don’t know what Empress Hou Tu had a secret conversation with him.”</p><p>With that, he waved his left sleeve, and the universe stood up again. He put away the clone of the celestial emperor that was suppressed by the seal, turned around, and left without any hesitation.</p><p>“You?”Facing Meng Qi’s straightforward action, Liu Luo could not react in time.</p><p>Meng Qi chuckled. “This is already considered a devil Buddha clone. Encountering him will definitely arouse ah Nan’s senses. If I don’t Leave Now, do you still want to stay and fight with him?”</p><p>At the same time, he flicked his right hand, and a small illusory light seal flew towards the nine heavens mystical maiden. Inside, there were many vague dao patterns floating. Their colors were like gold and red, filled with the intent of battle and conquest.</p><p>“This is…”Liu Luo caught the seal, his expression slightly changing.</p><p>Meng Qi flew up and left the deep pit, he said nonchalantly, “I have assimilated some of the bits and pieces of authority related to battle and conquest. The rest is condensed into this seal. I believe that it has the effect of a rock from another mountain for you, Your Highness. If everyone works together to explore, how can I be the only one to reap the benefits?”</p><p>Liu Luo did not pretend to be sincere. She put away the seal and smiled sweetly. “No wonder there were many rumors in the jianghu in the past. It was said that frenzied sword, Su Meng, was a brave and righteous man. I will remember this in my heart.”</p><p>Then, she looked at Meng Qi’s left sleeve and said, “You took away this heavenly Emperor Avatar because you were afraid that the Devil Buddha, Ah Nan, would use it to bypass the spiritual mountain seal and escape?”</p><p>“Although it’s very unlikely, we have to be careful.”Meng Qi nodded solemnly.</p><p>Of course, in this way, even if there was a “Cause of all karma”that was isolated from the void of this world, the Devil Buddha could still rely on the connection between the avatar and the real body to vaguely grasp their whereabouts.</p><p>It would only depend on who ran fast!</p><p>Moreover, as long as he met up with Guang Chengzi and the other disciples of Yuxu sect, things would be less troublesome.</p><p>He and Liu Luo quickly escaped from the heavenly prison and rushed back to the Big Dipper carriage.</p><p>..</p><p>In the real world, in the Great Snow Mountain, beside the nine immortal venerated tombs, Wang Siyuan met the current Snow Mountain sect leader.</p><p>“Young master Wang, you suddenly came to visit. May I know what’s the matter?”The Snow Mountain sect leader asked politely.</p><p>Wang Siyuan coughed lightly and said with a faint smile,</p><p>“I’m here for the one suppressed in the ancient tomb.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
