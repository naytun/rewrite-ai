Tears would have flowed down his face on the spot, and he would have knelt down in ecstasy and kowtowed to acknowledge his master. No matter how high he was on the precipice, no matter how conceited he was when he was born.., at most, he would have thought of entering the cave abode of a sect that was suppressed by a venerated immortal and being taken in as a disciple by someone ranked in the immortal class. He did not have, and did not dare to dream of being favored by a great divine ability user who had completed his destiny, not to mention, there were only a few perfected beings like Wang Fo in the world!</p><p>However, at this moment, the first thought that appeared in his mind was:</p><p>“I have the fate of being an important figure on the other shore. With the yellow millet pillow lent to me by the current primordial heavenly venerate, I might be able to enter the hollow jade temple in the future and become an illustrious figure like ‘Fairy Mingxia’Fang huayin. Why do I have to become the disciple of a great destiny divine ability user?”</p><p>Only when there was a comparison would there be a difference. Those who had completed their destiny were known to be the strongest below the other side of the river. They would live forever, and there was hope for the new age. They were terrifying existences that could destroy an entire universe, but they were only “Below the other side of the river”, there was a huge difference between them and the truly important figures. With the favor of the primordial heavenly venerate Su Meng, who would care about the “Small”unfettered King Buddha in the world?</p><p>This was not contempt, this was the truth!</p><p>Tan Ping shook his head at the unfettered king and Buddha in the world without any hesitation. He made an apologetic expression as if he was saying, “I am loyal to Taoism and have failed the good intentions of the ancient Buddha.”.</p><p>The unfettered king and Buddha in the world turned his head and continued to look at the ceremony of re-establishing the Great Zhou. His leisurely and unrestrained expression did not change, as if he did not care about the rejection of his whim just now. However, there was a hint of doubt in his eyes, he was puzzled that Tan Ping could reject the good intentions of a person with perfect destiny.</p><p>Did he have other sources of support?</p><p>Had he been secretly taken in by other fellow Daoists Long Ago?</p><p>Seeing that the unfettered King Buddha of the world was not angry, tan ping secretly heaved a sigh of relief. At the moment, he could only be considered to be fated with the person on the other side and had yet to be listed as a disciple. If he really angered an ancient Buddha or a great divine arts practitioner, it would not be a good thing either.</p><p>Following the arrival of the primordial Lord of Heaven, Su Meng, and the suppression of the wat-wielding divine envoy with the divine whip, the undercurrents that Tan Ping and the other ordinary experts could feel before came to an abrupt halt, as if they had never been brewing, the entire ceremony ended smoothly, and the Great Zhou Empire was once again established in the East China Sea. It ruled over half of the billions of islands and gained the allegiance of many Immortals and deities.</p><p>The round light rose from the canopy and landed in the nine dragons agarwood carriage. The fragrance filled the air, and dense mist surged as immortal music reverberated.</p><p>“Greetings, heavenly venerate!”All the immortals and deities on the island bowed solemnly. Even the unfettered King Buddha and the wat-wielding divine envoy stood up and bowed, not daring to be the slightest bit negligent.</p><p>Seeing the nine true dragons fly up and pull the agarwood carriage into the Infinite Heights, the wat-wielding divine envoy heaved a sigh of relief. He felt as if he had collapsed.</p><p>Facing a person who could destroy his body and soul with just a breath, facing a big figure who had a deep hatred with Luo sect, the pressure was not something that outsiders could understand. He was really restless and had a thorn in his back, so what if he could get rid of all these thoughts? The fear from his innate spiritual light surged like the sea.</p><p>One could only say that he was lucky to be an envoy.</p><p>Not daring to stay any longer, the Wat Oracle left in a panic with the Luoism people.</p><p>..</p><p>After the ceremony of Gao Lan re-establishing the Great Zhou, Xia Xiu, Liu Zubin, and the others still remained on Changmen Island, hoping to meet the immortal destiny. Tan Ping could do nothing about it, having the fate of being an important figure on the other shore, he did not care about the immortals on the island at all.</p><p>In the evening, a line of people walked in the market, asking which immortal family had the wish to take in a disciple. Suddenly, Tan Ping’s vision blurred, and he saw a handsome monk with pale golden skin. His temperament was carefree and free, as if he had no ties, even time could not be restrained. Golden ten thousand characters protruded from his forehead and condensed into the word “Buddha”.</p><p>The world’s carefree King Buddha!</p><p>Tan Ping was shocked and his heart beat like a drum. He did not expect this ancient Buddha to return and specifically come to find him!</p><p>What exactly was his plan?</p><p>Xia Xiu, Liu Zubin, and the others also recognized the world’s carefree King Buddha. They were shocked and excited. Their lips moved, and they could not speak. After a long time, they finally said in a scattered manner,</p><p>“Greetings, King Buddha!”</p><p>Could it be that they had the fate of Buddha and were about to bring an ancient Buddha into the Pure Land?</p><p>The unfettered King Buddha of the world smiled slightly and put his hands together to return the greeting. He did not have any sense of superiority. He looked at tan ping and said, “Almsgiver Tan, are you really not willing to follow me to cultivate the Buddhist dharma and return to the Pure Land?”</p><p>Xia Xiu, Liu Zubin, and the others were immediately disappointed. It turned out that the unfettered King Buddha of the world came because of Tan Ping. However, when he was born, there was a strange phenomenon of a room full of red light. Thinking about it, it was normal.</p><p>There was definitely jealousy in their hearts. However, they had heard of many similar things and understood what the right way to handle it was. At such a time, they had to sincerely congratulate him. They could not break off their friendship. When their good friends succeeded in their cultivation.., it could also be considered that they had formed a connection with the immortal and Buddhist sects. They might even be accepted into the sect by their good friends.</p><p>Wealth and relationships were also considered as “Relationships”. One more friend meant one more path!</p><p>They were about to congratulate tan ping, but when they turned their heads to look, they found that Tan Ping’s face was as white as a sheet of paper, without a trace of blood.</p><p>What was going on? Xia Xiu was immediately stunned and showed concern.</p><p>Tan Ping forced a smile and said, “Junior’s heart is with Haotian Taoism. Does the ancient Buddha want to disregard mercy and force fate?”</p><p>The Carefree King Buddha of the world laughed and said,</p><p>“How can fate be forced? I just want to let almsgiver know his true colors before making a decision.”</p><p>He raised his right hand and pointed at tan ping’s glabella. His movement seemed slow, but Tan Ping, Xia Xiu, and the others seemed to freeze and did not react at all.</p><p>The point between his glabella was like an electric shock. It was numb and went straight into Tan Ping’s heart. Light and shadow immediately floated in front of Tan Ping’s eyes. He felt pieces of golden memory fragments leap out from the deep ocean, creating scenes.</p><p>All kinds of water elements and the ocean surrounded his body..</p><p>The planet condensed from the Azure Ocean..</p><p>The black dragon beneath his feet, the dark blue near-black statue..</p><p>The Black Tortoise’s authority that was filled with red mist..</p><p>So I am the reincarnation of the ancient god water ancestor. After fusing with the authority left behind by the Zhen Wu, I have secretly reincarnated in order to get rid of the restriction of the godly body!</p><p>Tan Ping only felt that every drop of blood and every trace of water in his body was restless and cheering. The memories of the past and the previous world rolled over, and his eyes appeared to be confused for a moment.</p><p>“Do you understand, almsgiver?”The world’s carefree king and Buddha put their palms together.</p><p>Tan Ping Shivered. There was a hint of desolation and ancientness in his eyes. His eyes became clear, like the condensation of layers of liquid.</p><p>He sighed and said,</p><p>“Only today do you know that I am me, but I still have to let down the good intentions of the ancient Buddha.”</p><p>That was a big figure on the other side!</p><p>The world’s carefree king and Buddha put their palms together again and said,</p><p>“Good, good, good.”</p><p>With that, he turned around and left. He disappeared into thin air and disappeared from the market.</p><p>Outside Changmen Island, there were countless blue waves. This ancient Buddha sat upright on the waves. There was some doubt in his eyes:</p><p>“Not only does he have the Dharma Pearl of the old tree of Fusang, but he also has a treasure that can reverse time…”</p><p>“Before Zhenwu fell, he gave the primordial Yang ruler to the old tree of Fusang. It is normal for the water ancestor, who has merged with his authority, to receive the reward from the old tree of Fusang. But who gave that treasure that can reverse time? Could it be that it is also the old tree of Fusang?”</p><p>The unfettered king and Buddha of the world could not understand what was going on. A glazed look appeared in his eyes as he continued to look at Tan Ping and the others through the layers of obstacles.</p><p>..</p><p>The sky gradually darkened. Tan Ping and the others were still immersed in the shock caused by the unfettered king and Buddha of the world just now. They were all silent. They bid farewell to Liu Zubin and slowly returned to the inn where they stayed.</p><p>At this moment, Tan Ping casually took out the yellow millet pillow and took a look. He saw that the patterns on it were covered with brilliance and were no longer as dim as before.</p><p>“It should be usable again,”he muttered to himself.</p><p>After recovering the water ancestor’s memories, he began to feel that this matter was a little strange. Thus, he looked at Xia Xiu and said with a smile, “Xiao Xiu, you try it.”</p><p>Xia Xiu had been looking forward to it for a long time and did not refuse politely. After thanking him repeatedly, she placed the yellow millet pillow on the bed and closed her clothes before leaning on the pillow and falling asleep.</p><p>A faint light flashed. Other than the unfettered king Buddha who had been watching them, no one noticed it.</p><p>“He can really send people back to the past for a short time…”the carefree king and Buddha nodded slightly. The Buddha character between his brows suddenly turned into a flowing light, making his golden body illusory, as if he was controlling the river of time.</p><p>He used that bit of connection and power to circulate the accumulation of his dao of time. He quietly followed Xia Xiu upstream, wanting to see where he would be and what he would encounter.</p><p>Light and shadow floated, and Xia Xiu suddenly woke up. In front of her was a surging river, and next to it was a city with a deep sense of history. Above the city stood a man in white clothes. He looked like a young girl, and his face was full of sickness, the lights behind him were waning, but it was still the same. Little by little, they reflected on the surface of the river, like the upside-down galaxy, dreamy and blurred.</p><p>Where was this? Xia Xiu was completely at a loss, but she was also excited because she knew that she had most likely returned to the past!</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>At this moment, she heard a long howl that was filled with guilt, pain, despair, resentment, and other emotions. It was like a lone wolf howling at the Moon, or a ghost crying at the grave at night. She could not help but feel gloomy.</p><p>Looking over, Xia Xiu saw a man wearing a black suit and a hero’s scarf on his head. He was valiant and masculine. He was facing the sky and howling sorrowfully. In his arms, he was holding an infinitely beautiful white figure. His clothes were hanging down, and his limbs were weak, there was no life left in him.</p><p>In the high sky, the easygoing Buddha king who had followed him secretly saw this scene and became even more confused:</p><p>“Outside Guangling City, Gu Xiaosang died in the arms of the person from the Hollow Jade Temple…”</p><p>“Why did he return to this period of history…”</p><p>As he thought of this, he had a flash of inspiration and thought of something:</p><p>“The product of Buddha’s minimization and emptiness is the tang sanzang. After the Tang Sanzang scripture passed through the clouds, it shed its mortal body and became a virtuous Buddha. The mortal body returned to its original state and turned into a golden cicada. The Supreme True Buddha was born through this… in other words, there are two products of Buddha’s minimization and emptiness. One is the Golden Buddha formed by the spiritual light of the Tang Sanzang’s nature, and the other is the Supreme True Buddha born from a mortal body…”</p><p>“Gu Xiaosang is the product of the man from the Hollow Jade Temple. She used the man from the hollow jade temple to abandon her mortal body and use the green lotus seed of Chaos to rebuild her dharma body. Will this mortal body give birth to something?”</p><p>“Even though the man from the Hollow Jade Temple learned the art of the hollow jade temple from the very beginning and is different from the Buddha, this mortal body is still a bit mysterious…”</p><p>Thinking of this, the carefree king Buddha was shocked:</p><p>“When the one from the hollow jade temple left with Gu Xiaosang’s body and came to the isolated ridge of Mount Kunlun, there were only lotus seeds in the pond…”</p><p>“Where did he bury the body? Or was it destroyed or replaced by someone else?”</p><p>The carefree king Buddha looked at the figure who was howling at the sky and understood why he had returned to this period of history.</p><p>The other shore who had given away the Golden Millet Pillow was planning something!</p><p>After attracting all the attention to the reincarnation of the water ancestor, he was planning something in the form of darkness under the lamp!</p><p>PS: Tonight’s chapter is in the early morning</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
