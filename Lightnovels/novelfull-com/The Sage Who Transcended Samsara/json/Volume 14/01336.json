Other than that, everything else was covered.</p><p>When he retracted his gaze, he vaguely felt that the primordial lord of Heaven was looking at him. His gaze was neither sad nor happy.</p><p>After waiting for a long time without seeing any changes, Meng Qi engraved the brand on this spot and completed this trip back in time. He pushed the traces of his existence in the Netherworld to the time of creation, he became an ancient creature that had witnessed the entire history of the Netherworld, a real ancient creature!</p><p>Of course, his consciousness was not like the real other shore. It was already outside the river of time and could exist in every moment of the past. It could only be transferred between the brand left in history. Actual combat would not have much of an effect, however, the essence was completely different. It was one of the differences between the fake and the real. It was one of the differences that relied on the power of the Netherworld and oneself.</p><p>Meng Qi’s consciousness did not directly shift back to the current node. Instead, he searched the history of the Netherworld and descended to a certain era.</p><p>According to what little sang said before she left, if he could go back in time, he must come and see ‘him’!</p><p>The yellowish-brown water rolled and flowed. It was full of the intention of death and sinking. Countless vengeful souls and ghosts were floating in the ripples, pulling everything that passed through this place. They wanted to make them erase their memories and spirituality as well, they would be trapped in the Netherworld forever, unable to escape.</p><p>There was no sediment on this stretch of the river. The mountains on both sides were connected, rugged and steep, like monsters that lurked in the darkness. At this moment, a six-foot-tall monk with a sallow and emaciated face had a merciful expression, the monk with wisdom in his eyes was walking on the edge of the cliff step by step, enduring the strong wind that blew against his bones, the cold of his blood, and the will to fall. He did not stop at all, not showing the slightest bit of bitterness.</p><p>Meng Qi appeared beside him and quietly followed him for a few steps. Suddenly, he opened his mouth and said in a low voice,</p><p>“Venerable one.”</p><p>This monk was the Buddha of Lingshan who had measured the nine Netherworlds in the past, the Master of the Saha World, and the only two transcendents. It was impossible to know and impossible to talk about!</p><p>After the fall of the other shore, there was only a simple brand left in the past to maintain the course of history. What would happen to the Buddha of Lingshan who had witnessed the realm of Dao Fruit? Would it be different from the fallen other side?</p><p>This was the reason why Gu Xiaosang had asked Meng Qi to come and see the “Brand”of the Buddha. He wanted to see if he could find some secrets and use them to reach the other side!</p><p>The Buddha put his hands together and his expression did not change. He did not stop even for a moment because of Meng Qi’s arrival and shouting. It was as if there was nothing beyond his heart and nothing beyond his body. In short, he was turning a blind eye and listening to nothing.</p><p>Meng Qi placed his hands behind his back. His black robe fluttered in the wind from the netherworld. He continued to walk side by side with the Buddha of Lingshan as he said to himself,</p><p>“I have been to Lingshan before. I followed the river beside the Lingyun crossing and went down all the way to the back of the mountain. I saw the shell left behind by the golden cicada after it broke out of its shell and entered the place where the Supreme True Buddha was sealed…”</p><p>He slowly described his experience of entering and leaving the spiritual mountain several times. He described everything in detail, including everything, as if he was seeking Buddha’s teachings.</p><p>However, Buddha still had no reaction. It was more like a brand than the brand of Ananda after being suppressed.</p><p>Turning his head, Meng Qi looked at him deeply and did not say anything more. His body dispersed like fog and disappeared from this place.</p><p>Strong winds swept, and the yellow springs stirred up waves. Buddha walked forward step by step, as if he was going to walk through the eternal time.</p><p>Suddenly, a tiny crack appeared at the back of his head. It expanded rapidly and continued to extend. As if he had taken off his clothes, the surface of his skin was peeled off. A brand new figure walked out from within. It was still six feet tall and sallow and emaciated, his expression was benevolent, and his eyes were filled with wisdom. He only paused for a moment and looked back at the place where Meng Qi had disappeared. His mouth cracked open, revealing forty Buddha Teeth!</p><p>The shell that had been peeled off shattered bit by bit, turning into pieces of glazed light that fell into the Yellow Springs, disappearing without a trace in an instant.</p><p>..</p><p>His will shifted, but Meng Qi still did not return to the current node. Instead, he came to the nine serenities crevice that had appeared nearly two hundred years ago, a crevice that connected and invaded the real world.</p><p>Outside the crevice of the rolling black fog stood a towering and sinister mountain. It was none other than Tianzhu Mountain, the training hall of the Immortal Demon God!</p><p>Through the crevice, one could vaguely see the burial chamber inside the mountain. There were bright lamps inside, but there was no coffin. There was only a bed of black clouds and ice. Sitting cross-legged on it was the immortal demon god, whose entire body was covered in a long black robe.</p><p>Opposite him stood a handsome man with a proud body and pale golden skin. In Meng Qi’s eyes, it was so familiar and closely related.</p><p>This was the incarnation of the “Immortal Dao Body”that he had visited the immortal demon god in the past and asked about the whereabouts of the descendants of the Wuzhuang Temple!</p><p>“Should I call you the bodhisattva of universal virtue or the bodhisattva of Guanyin?”Huisheng asked seriously.</p><p>At this moment, the immortal demon God suddenly looked at the nine nether crevice at the bottom of Tianzhu Mountain and said in a deep voice,</p><p>“Which Demon God came? Why did you eavesdrop?”</p><p>Meng Qi sighed and did not answer directly. Instead, he asked, “When the demon God escaped from Lingshan Mountain, did he see anything that made him afraid to leave this world and unwilling to return to the Pure Land?”</p><p>His incarnation of the “Undying Dao Body”was stunned in the face of this sudden situation because the past had been transferred to the nine Nether. All that was left was the brand.</p><p>The Undying Demon God immediately fell silent. After a long while, he said, “I don’t remember. Who is the Demon God?”</p><p>“Who?”Meng Qi smiled. “Isn’t he the one in front of you?”</p><p>“You…”the Undying Demon God’s emotions clearly fluctuated. He was shocked and immediately understood, “So this isn’t the current node. You have obtained the other shore and traced it back to here. No, you are the false other shore, a false other shore that relied on the eight-nine arcane art to achieve.”</p><p>“Since you know that I have attained the false other shore, and that I am a direct descendant of the jade void, what is there that Demon God can not say?”Meng Qi said calmly.</p><p>The Immortal Demon God pondered for a moment and asked in puzzlement, “Why didn’t you ask at the current node? Could it be that I had already fallen at that time?”</p><p>“No,”Meng Qi said concisely. “Demon God, you will understand why in the future.”</p><p>Upon hearing Meng Qi’s answer, the immortal demon god clearly heaved a sigh of relief, then, he let out a long sigh and said, “When I seized a chance to escape from Mount Numinous, I discovered two things. First, at the moment when Ten Thousand Buddhas fell together, there was an obvious strong fluctuation at the back of Mount Numinous with ecstasy. Furthermore, it was very similar to the aura of Buddha…”</p><p>“Supreme True Buddha. Buddha is the product of reducing space. I have dealt with him in the future,”Meng Qi said calmly.</p><p>“Supreme True Buddha…”the undying demon god muttered to himself, “I see.”</p><p>He paused for a few breaths, he continued, “At the moment when Ten Thousand Buddhas fell together, Bodhi ancient Buddha stopped demon saint. It was neither too early nor too late. It was just the right timing. It did not stop Ah Nan from reversing the formation, nor did it allow demon saint to save the other great sages in time. It was as if she wanted her five virtues body to be polluted by the nine Netherworlds. Then, Amitabha Buddha descended.”</p><p>“No wonder the Monkey King called me teacher. No wonder you didn’t dare to return to the Pure Land of Buddhism.”Meng Qi’s tone was filled with emotion.</p><p>Seeing that the Undying Demon God did not have anything else to reveal, his figure flashed and left a mark on this place. Then, he returned to the current node and let history play out quietly, maintaining his original appearance.</p><p>..</p><p>Meng Qi, who was sitting in the lotus position on the pitch-black peak, opened his eyes. At the same time, the Undying Demon God in the world of the western expedition suddenly trembled. A memory that did not exist in the past appeared in his mind.</p><p>The figure hidden in the nine nether crevice was still vivid in his mind. The conversation kept echoing in his mind, and traces of him going back to the past were left in his mind.</p><p>“I’ll understand why in the future…”the immortal demon god muttered to himself.</p><p>..</p><p>“Su Meng!”</p><p>The world’s carefree king Buddha let out a painful groan. The Buddha character between his brows lit up, and the ten thousand characters stacked on top of each other, emitting a clear light. He performed the form of the Tathagata divine palm, forcibly resisting the erosion of the mass of flesh and blood. With a leap, he entered the Western Paradise.</p><p>Before he truly entered, the mass of flesh and blood suddenly fell on its own. It lost its vitality and spirituality and decayed into mud.</p><p>“This is the harvest of Su Meng’s own flesh and blood after he digested and assimilated the remnants of Donghuang…”the unfettered King Buddha of the world no longer looked angry. He was at ease.</p><p>With someone on the other side pressing down on the world, relying on a mass of flesh and blood would definitely not be able to severely injure him. It was just a little nausea so that he could continue to throw stones and ask for directions in the future.</p><p>On top of the Fusang ancient tree, the green emperor suddenly sighed when he saw this scene.</p><p>He already knew the “Message”that Su Meng wanted to send.</p><p>He had used this matter to present the current situation in front of him: when faced with the alliance between Buddhism and mother Wusheng, when the Monster Emperor’s stance was wavering, he and the heavenly venerate of morals were at an absolute disadvantage. More importantly.., he was the latest to reach the other shore, and his own forces had yet to grow. Only the nine spirits primordial saint and the Moonlight Bodhisattva were capable of doing so at the moment.</p><p>The subtext was obvious: he urgently needed an ally, an ally from the other shore, an ally that represented the forces of the Hollow Jade Temple!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
