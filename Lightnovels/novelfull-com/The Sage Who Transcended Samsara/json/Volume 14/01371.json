The figure of the Buddha, who only left a mark, sat upright in the great thunderclap temple on the peak of the spiritual mountain, he was merciful and compassionate.</p><p>The Supreme True Buddha was a monster on the level of the other shore. Being swallowed and assimilated by him was equivalent to becoming a part of him. Not only was the future cut off, but the past was also only left with a mark and could no longer be resurrected by changing history, therefore, Zhu Bajie was considered to have completely fallen!</p><p>More importantly, before Zhu Bajie died and returned to the heavenly court, the role that he had assumed for the things that he had done after that collapsed with a loud bang. History began to stop and change.</p><p>“Bajie!”Inside the spiritual mountain, the Buddha of victory, whose dharma body was green and Golden, suddenly opened the vertical eye between his eyebrows and sensed the strange disappearance of Zhu Bajie’s aura.</p><p>The Bodhisattva’s wisdom eye scanned the universe and reflected the mysteries of heaven and earth. There were all sorts of things in the world, but there was no trace of Zhu Bajie’s existence. Even how he disappeared became a blank, as if nothing had happened, it was as if the messenger of the altar of purification had suddenly turned into ashes.</p><p>The eyes of the Buddha of victory burned with anger. The glass above his head spewed out and turned into a boundless light. It revealed a violent ape wearing a golden chain armor, a purple-gold crown with Phoenix Wings, and a heavy golden cudgel in his hand.</p><p>Who dared to ambush and kill Bajie!</p><p>With his hands under the awning, the heaven-equal grand sage and the Buddha of Victory’s eyes shone with a strange light as they searched for clues. However, with their cultivation level and strength, they did not find anything.</p><p>The Buddha of victory suppressed his anger and realized that this matter was beyond his ability. Hence, he stepped on the lotus flower and climbed to the peak. He came to the front of the Great Thunderclap Temple and saw Jia Ye and Ah Nan guarding the door.</p><p>“Bajie fell mysteriously. I came to ask Buddha to reveal the true culprit!”The Buddha of victory in battle shouted loudly.</p><p>Jia Ye and Ah Nan looked at each other, he pressed his palms together and said, “Buddha already knows about the death of the emissary of the altar of purification. However, he said that this matter is related to a great calamity. When you know about it, you will tell me the whole story. There is no need to ask today.”</p><p>The door of the great thunderclap temple was tightly shut. The signboard was flowing with light. It was peaceful and at ease.</p><p>The Buddha of victory of the battle widened his eyes angrily when he heard this. “Do you want me to just watch and do nothing?”</p><p>He wished that he could join hands with his original body to attack the great thunderclap temple, but he also understood that this would not be of any help.</p><p>“Buddha, please stop being angry and impatient.”Ananda’s face was full of bitterness as he bowed and answered.</p><p>“If Buddha doesn’t say, I will go somewhere else to ask!”The golden violent ape cried out a few times and no longer hesitated. He set up the somersault cloud and flew out of the Saha world, straight to the Great Scarlet Heaven Dou Shuai Palace.</p><p>The victorious Buddha also calmed down a little. He immediately transformed into a Buddhist light and headed towards the Bodhi Pure Land’s spiritual altar, Miniscule Mountain!</p><p>As he watched them disappear into the Saha world, the corners of Ah Nan’s mouth curled up slightly. He revealed a mocking smile:</p><p>Go ahead and ask. The murderer was sitting upright in the great thunderclap temple behind him, receiving offerings and worship. He was merciful and had a clear conscience.</p><p>If you could really ask him, with your personality, history would probably change drastically..</p><p>With a somersault cloud, the Monkey King landed at the door of Tuoshuai Palace. However, the door was tightly shut and it was quiet and peaceful.</p><p>“The Old Lord is not here?”The golden violent ape was confused and impatient. It banged on the door of Tuoshuai Palace. The sound reverberated for a long time, but no one answered.</p><p>The Old Lord didn’t want to see me… The Monkey had always been smart, and now he had understood.</p><p>Bodhi Pure Land, Bier Miniscule Mountain.</p><p>The Buddha of victory battle descended outside the Tristar Crescent Cave. He hurriedly said to the gatekeeper, “Has teacher gone into seclusion? I have something to ask.”</p><p>The gatekeeper returned the bow and answered honestly,</p><p>“Senior brother, teacher doesn’t allow you to enter.”</p><p>Battle Victory Buddha was stunned outside the cave abode. It took him a long time to regain his senses. He shook his head and left the Bodhi Pure Land. Then, he saw the unruly golden violent ape dragging a thick golden cudgel as it walked over with a dim light.</p><p>Their eyes met, and they saw the frustration, confusion, despair, pain, and hatred in each other’s eyes.</p><p>They had asked everyone on the other shore, but none of them were willing to tell the truth!</p><p>Suddenly, the golden violent ape raised its head and roared angrily, and the corners of its eyes became a little moist:</p><p>“What’s the use of cultivating the Great Dao and seeking longevity for so many years!”</p><p>It couldn’t even find the murderer of the old pig!</p><p>What was the use of the seventy-two transformations, eight-nine arcane art, and the Golden Cudgel!</p><p>Its roar shook the sky. It was full of pain and sorrow, but there was nothing it could do.</p><p>Without being able to stir up this change, the ripples that little marshal canopy had stirred up in history quickly subsided. There would be a new leader of the Heavenly River Navy to maintain the process.</p><p>At the current node, the golden violent ape, who was cultivating in the depths of the Tusita Palace, suddenly opened its eyes. Golden Light shot out in all directions. It sensed the existence of two parts of history in its memory at the same time. In addition to its understanding of the Supreme True Buddha during this period of time.., it instantly understood the whole story.</p><p>The violent ape lowered its head and muttered to itself in pain,</p><p>“Idiot…”</p><p>So what if it understood the truth? It could no longer be saved..</p><p>In the Heavenly River, the demon Buddha and the Heavenly Dao monster retreated. Meng Qi looked at the Monkey King who was struggling in history and the Sun Wukong who was in pain. He sighed lightly:</p><p>“The Sea of Pain…”</p><p>Even the Monkey King had to endure the torment of the Sea of pain.</p><p>Of course, it was not for nothing. The demon Buddha’s attitude showed an important problem. He still had a very important secret, the reason why he killed Zhu Bajie was not because he was worried that the heaven would be attacked by the ancients. It was simply because the other party might have found some clues. Otherwise, when he reversed time and saved Zhu Bajie.., he did not need to make a move at all. The fall of the Heaven had already happened, and it involved the people on the other side. It was not a small leak that could be changed. If this was the end of the matter, what did Zhu Bajie’s life have to do with his death?</p><p>He must have covered up some possibilities earlier, making the other people on the other side think that thunder god had used Gao Cuilan’s hand to kill marshal canopy to prevent the plot to attack the heavenly court from leaking out. Therefore, no one had paid attention to this matter, and he had not seen enough in the past, he did not expect to use his body to do something like this. He was puzzled as to why the creator could not destroy the remains of the little fairy. He then thought of coming forward to take a look and hit the nail on the head.</p><p>With deep eyes, Meng Qi returned to the hollow jade palace in Kunlun’s field and appeared next to Gu Xiaosang, who was cultivating the White Lotus divine body.</p><p>“Let’s go. I’ll take you to a place,”Meng Qi said.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang also noticed the slight change in history. She tilted her head and asked with a smile, “A place related to the Devil Buddha?”</p><p>“Yes, it’s also the place where I was born. It’s a ‘crossing world raft’. I want to go back to the time there and see which fellow Daoist left this ‘crossing world raft’. Why would the Devil Buddha hide my ‘him’and ‘Me’There? You can also use it to experience the mystery of returning to the past,”Meng Qi said slowly.</p><p>Hearing this, Gu Xiaosang turned around calmly. She cupped her cheek with her right hand, her eyes watery and charming. She smiled and said,</p><p>“Does this count as going from unmatchable sexual intercourse to meeting your parents?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
