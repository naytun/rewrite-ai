There were twenty-eight beautiful or steep mountain peaks. They were on top of the stars, and below them was Luo Feng. With a population of ten million, it was abnormally prosperous. Now, the auspicious light was not extinguished, and the auspicious clouds did not fall, from time to time, one could see immortals from all walks of life coming. They rode on beasts or set up clouds. They were truly detached from the secular world.</p><p>“I have never seen so many immortals in my life.”Xia Xiu, who liked to wear pink jackets, stood on the shore. She could not help but sigh as she looked at the magnificent scenery of tens of thousands of immortals coming and going.</p><p>These were all true immortals who could visit the North Sea, Sunset, Cangwu, and eat the morning dew and the clouds. In the past, they could not meet them even if they wanted to!</p><p>Tan Ping said with great ambition, “I hope I can be fated to be a disciple of some immortal.”</p><p>The yellow millet pillow was still recovering and could not be used for the time being. The bead that was emitting a green glow and floating with talismans finally had a preliminary understanding of how to use it after he tried it day and night, not only could it flourish the vitality of the physical body and primordial spirit, but it could also guide the flow of internal QI and optimize cultivation methods. At critical moments, it could even be used as a powerful magic tool to attack the enemy. tan ping named it the “Eternal music bead.”.</p><p>After sighing, they entered a nearby city, intending to bump into immortal destiny. At this moment, Xia Xiu heard a warm greeting. “Miss Xia, Brother Tan, you’re here too?”</p><p>Turning their heads, they saw a man in a white robe carrying a sword case. He was an acquaintance they had met during their travels. His name was “Cloud Vajra”Liu Zubin.</p><p>Tan Ping cupped his hands. “Immortal destiny is hard to come by. How can we let go of this opportunity?”</p><p>Liu Zubin laughed when he heard that. “I do have a good introduction. If you are lucky enough to join the immortal sect, don’t forget me in the future.”</p><p>“What introduction?”Xia Xiu asked in surprise and joy.</p><p>Liu Zubin pointed at the beautiful and verdant mountain outside the city and said, “‘Fairy Mingxia’Fang Huayin is hosting a banquet for immortals near Ning bi peak. It’s not forbidden for mortals. Everyone can go there. Even if they can’t find immortal destiny, it’s still good to ask for a few cups of immortal wine and eat a few divine fruits.”</p><p>“‘Fairy Mingxia’Fang Huayin…”Tan Ping repeated the name silently and said with a wry smile, “I am ignorant, but I don’t know which mountain, island, and cave abode she is an immortal from?”</p><p>The entire East China Sea was vast and boundless. Even if there were teleportation arrays on the main islands in the major sea areas, it was difficult for exterior experts to explore one or two out of ten. Naturally, they would not know about some immortals who were not well-known.</p><p>Liu Zubin coughed, with a serious expression, he said, “Fairy Mingxia’s cave abode is on the Wanxiang Island in the small South China Sea. It is more than a trillion miles away from the sea area that you often visit. It is normal that you have never heard of it. However, her background is not small. Today, on Changmen Island, other than the reincarnation of the human emperor, she is revered.”</p><p>“Her background is not small?”Upon hearing Liu Zubin’s introduction, Xia Xiu and the others were stunned. Their curiosity was piqued.</p><p>Liu zubin nodded slightly, “Don’t look at Fairy Mingxia, who had to work hard for a sixty-year-long period of time to obtain the Dharma Body and was ranked in the immortal class. Now, she is only at the Earth immortal realm, but her teacher, the former leader of the Jade Void Palace of Mount Kunlun, immortal venerate Yuan Huang, just recently broke free from the Sea of bitterness and ascended to the other shore, becoming the new immortal venerate Yuan Shi!”</p><p>“Do you guys think that her background is Big?”</p><p>Tan Ping was very shocked and blurted out, “The Jade Void Palace of Mount Kunlun? Immortal venerate Yuan Huang ascended to the other shore, and he did not suffer for ten thousand tribulations? How come we don’t Know About It?”</p><p>He had never heard of this matter at all. Shouldn’t the phenomenon of transcending the sea of bitterness and ascending to the other shore be seen by all the worlds?</p><p>“Haha.”Liu Zubin shook his head and laughed, “The immortal venerate Yuan emperor attained the Dao and was no longer the Azure Emperor of the past. A few heavenly venerates and Buddhas all made a move and caused the destruction and destruction of the real world. Only a few living beings survived and saw the phenomenon of heavenly venerate su ascending to the other shore. All of us should have died at that time and were resurrected after the event. However, we also missed the crucial scene. I only found out about this matter after hearing about it from the immortal of the cloud sea non-yearning realm.”</p><p>Tan Ping and the others looked at each other in shock:</p><p>We’ve only died once, and we’ve been resurrected again?</p><p>There was no feeling at all! It was as if nothing had happened at all!</p><p>It was simply too unbelievable!</p><p>They thought that with so many immortals gathered on Changmen Island, Liu Zubin would definitely not lie about this matter. They had no choice but to believe it. They all sighed at the mystery of the other shore. It was beyond their imagination and beyond common sense.</p><p>“I heard that the Jade Void Palace of Kunlun Mountain used to be one of the top holy grounds of the immortals. Unfortunately, it was destroyed by Mother Wusheng. The Daoist rite was destroyed and the sect scattered. I didn’t think that there would be a day when it would be revived. Moreover, if it didn’t make a sound, it would have already shocked everyone. It could be compared to the Dou Shuai Palace, the monster Emperor Palace, the Paradise World, the Bodhi Pure Land, the hometown of vacuum, and the Fusang Ancient Tree Realm.”Tan Ping let out a turbid breath, looking at Ning bi peak outside the city, a myriad of thoughts ran through his mind.</p><p>If Fairy Mingxia took a fancy to him and accepted him as her disciple, then he would be able to ascend to the heavens in a single step!</p><p>This thought reverberated in everyone’s mind, and they couldn’t wait to rush to Ning Bi Peak. Along the way, there were crowds of people, and the vegetation was lush. From time to time, strange lights and fogs could be seen rushing towards the peak.</p><p>On the mountain, the winding waters revolved, and cup after cup of immortal wine and plates of delicacies poured in with the waves, allowing people to eat them. Tan Ping, Liu Zu bin, and the others didn’t dare to get too close to the peak, lest they offend the immortal gods. Thus, they found an empty spot and sat down on the ground, they were thinking about how to attract attention.</p><p>As far as the eye could see, strange flowers were blooming on the peak, and rays of light rose into the sky, almost forming a colorful treasure house that covered the area. One could vaguely see that the person in the lead was a strong and concise woman.</p><p>“That is ‘Fairy Mingxia’Fang huayin,”Liu Zubin introduced.</p><p>Tan Ping and the others nodded, their emotions complicated.</p><p>Fang huayin looked at the immortals and deities around him, raised his Jade Cup, and said,</p><p>“This toast is to establish the Great Zhou once again as the emperor of the world, reviving the human way.”</p><p>Reverend Zhu Long and the other immortals and deities raised their cups one after another and took a sip with a smile. Just as they were about to speak, golden light suddenly shone in the sky, and colored glass covered the entire sky. An ancient Buddha descended, surrounded by five Hundred Arhats, Heavenly Dragons, Asuras, and indigo bodhisattvas, he occupied a mountain peak.</p><p>“The unfettered king and Buddha of the world!”Reverend Zhu Long said in surprise.</p><p>He actually came to congratulate him? He probably came with ill intentions?</p><p>The direct opponents of the Human Emperor’s re-establishment of the Great Zhou were the Buddhist kingdom on Earth and his hometown in vacuum. Behind the Buddhist kingdom on Earth was Amitabha Buddha, the Lord of the Western Paradise World. The unfettered king and Buddha of the world was the ancient Buddha that he relied on, he was a powerful divine ability user who had completed his destiny for tens of thousands of years. Moreover, he had achieved success in the way of time, and his dharma was mysterious. He was one of the few people below the other shore.</p><p>The arrival of this ancient Buddha immediately cast a shadow over the human emperor’s re-establishment of the Great Zhou, making the cheerful atmosphere of the banquet a little more solemn.</p><p>It was unknown whether the human emperor’s side would also have a divine ability user of the same level to congratulate them..</p><p>Daoist Xuanwu pondered for a moment and looked at Fang huayin. “Fairy Mingxia, do you know which other great divine arts practitioners with perfect destiny have come? Celestial Venerate Guangcheng, will celestial venerate Wenshu come personally to congratulate you?”</p><p>Fang huayin revealed a wry smile. “What arrangements do you have, senior uncles? How would I know…”</p><p>At this moment, the glass in the high sky suddenly turned dark. It was shrouded in a boundless darkness, and it was filled with a quiet and deathly stillness, immortal gods that looked like king Ming Vajra, golden boy and jade girl, and spiritual officer and celestial master surrounded a god’s messenger with a blurry face and a jade board in his hand.</p><p>“God’s messenger Hu! A great divine arts practitioner also came to vacuum hometown!”Daoist Xuanwu looked solemn.</p><p>This God’s messenger was ranked second among the twelve God’s messengers, second only to Zhenyuan Zi. Moreover, he had always been mysterious and had an unknown origin. More than thirty years ago, he had successfully completed his destiny and was one of the few powerhouses in luoism!</p><p>The immortals looked at each other in dismay. They felt that the undercurrent was surging, and danger was like an arrow in the bowstring. As expected, the affairs of humanity were not short of trials and tribulations.</p><p>They hoped that the forces supporting the human emperor would quickly send great divine arts practitioners to maintain the balance of the situation. They did not want to make everyone feel uneasy and afraid anymore.</p><p>The relationship between the Buddhist kingdom on Earth, the hometown of vacuum, and the Great Zhou of humanity was known to all passersby. Tan Ping, Liu Zubin, Xia Xiu, and the others were also apprehensive, afraid that they would encounter the collision of great divine arts practitioners and be swallowed by the aftermath, then, there might not be another great figure on the other side reversing time and resurrecting them!</p><p>Subconsciously, tan ping touched the “Eternal music bead”in his pocket and the “Yellow millet pillow”in his storage bag, hoping that these two extraordinary treasures could protect him.</p><p>Fang huayin looked at an immortal god with an uneasy look in his eyes. He composed himself and said with a smile,</p><p>“The human emperor has decided to establish the Great Zhou again today, so he must have some confidence. Please don’t…”</p><p>Before she could finish her words, her expression suddenly changed. She stood up abruptly with a look of joy on her face:</p><p>“My teacher is about to descend here. Congratulations, Human Emperor!”</p><p>What? Reverend Zhu long, Daoist Xuanwu, and the others stood up at the same time. They looked at the sky in astonishment.</p><p>Primordial Lord of Heaven, Su Meng, was about to descend?</p><p>An important figure from the other shore wanted to come personally to congratulate the human emperor?</p><p>Fang huayin suppressed his excitement and said in a deep voice,</p><p>“Please follow me to welcome teacher!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
