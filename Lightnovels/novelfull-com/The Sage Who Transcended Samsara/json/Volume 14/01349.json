This was the other shore. This was the will of heaven</p><p>Countless figures flew out, from the past to the future. They burrowed into Meng Qi’s body, layer upon layer, before finally condensing into one. Together with two illusory dao fruits, they took shape, carrying the spiritual light of Meng Qi’s nature out of the river of time!</p><p>Everything was pitch black. There was nothing around. Even the flow of time up, down, left, right, front, back, and back no longer existed. Meng Qi’s final consciousness and spiritual light of his nature seemed to be completely assimilated into this absolute nothingness.</p><p>If he could not break this deathly “Nothingness,”then he would not be able to break free from the sea of bitterness, and he would not be able to ascend to the other shore!</p><p>This was the final tribulation, the “Eternal Nothingness”!</p><p>For other great divine arts practitioners who were trying to attain the DAO, it was a rather severe test. However, to Meng Qi, there was no heavenly tribulation that was more suitable for him than this!</p><p>The final bit of consciousness and innate spiritual light was mixed into the blade ray. A blazing white light illuminated the entire pitch black, splitting apart the absolute “Nothingness.”It expanded everything that had condensed into a single point within it, stirring up an explosion that was sufficient to destroy everything.., an explosion that could create everything.</p><p>A world-splitting explosion!</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Everything before his eyes suddenly became clear. Meng Qi saw the end of the immemorial era that was constantly collapsing and destroying.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>In the real world, a streak of white light lit up, breaking through the darkness and illuminating the world. It illuminated every corner of the universe, including the Netherworld Sea ruins at the lowest level of the Netherworld and the highest level of the nine heavens where countless fragments floated.</p><p>In the white light, it seemed that even the last era of the immemorial era had been illuminated.</p><p>The second type of abnormal phenomenon on the other side, ‘illuminating ten directions’!</p><p>The more places it illuminated, the deeper its foundation was!</p><p>The white light dimmed, and the world suddenly became colorful. The five colors converged into a thirty-three-story golden pagoda. Streams of yellow Qi hung down like dragons and snakes.</p><p>The lights and shadows changed, and there were also black and white fish that connected their heads and tails. The wheels of life and death in the heavens kept rotating, and pages of books that looked like the book of water saint’s virtue, ancient cauldrons that were formed by the Purple Qi of virtue, and plain white flags that were formed by the will of virtue of Yin, the Wuji Golden Lotus kept falling, and the ancient bronze bell that shook the three realms. The Purple Qi infected the bell-like heart of the heaven, and it swept away all the chaotic Earth, fire, wind, and water..</p><p>The symbols of the five virtues intertwined into a beautiful and terrifying Phoenix. Under the Bodhi Tree, there was a golden Buddha that touched the sky and the Earth. There was also an old man in Daoist robes who was slowly riding a green bull and had a purple aura that spanned 30,000 miles, there was also the figure of the four sword lights of red, green, black, and white that flew into his palm. In his mind, there was a bright and clean treasure light that contained all kinds of principles and all kinds of possibilities.</p><p>“Five virtues become phoenixes”, “Morals ride oxen”, “Spiritual treasures hold swords”, 99,999 kinds of “Great Dao manifestation”spread across the universe and finally collapsed into a point, the oldest and oldest point, the beginning of everything seemed to contain a flag of Pangu floating in it.</p><p>The anomaly on the other side, “The appearance of the beginning of the beginning”!</p><p>Upon seeing these anomalies, the burning lamp was in a trance. The glass cup in his hand shook, and his mouth opened and closed. In the end, he could not say anything.</p><p>It was over. Everything was over..</p><p>Su Meng had reached the other shore..</p><p>The people on the other shore who were involved with each other paused. They could only see that the slender, white finger was still trying its best to devour and assimilate the “Monster of Heavenly Dao”. They could get as many as they could!</p><p>Gu Xiaosang looked at all the strange phenomena, but there was not much joy in her heart.</p><p>The bright moon in her line of sight suddenly became clear. She could vaguely see the figure sitting in the palaces. He had a 70-80% similar appearance to her, but he was more mature, more sacred, more dignified, and his eyes were deep, she raised her chin slightly and said,</p><p>“Don’t you understand?”</p><p>“After obtaining the limitless seal and the spiritual treasure orthodoxy, the traces of ‘Primordial Lord of Heaven’and ‘Spiritual Treasure Lord of heaven’that appeared in all the worlds in the universe were all played by me. They will not attack again</p><p>“The ‘Primordial Lord of Heaven’that allowed you to gain an independent consciousness was me. I was the one who instilled all kinds of future possibilities and secrets about the Dao Fruit to you. I was the one who told you the secrets of the secret passage of the three lives palace and the fruit of this life. I was the one who left the green lotus seed of Chaos in the Jade Void Palace. Even your mother, whom you can’t forget, was also transformed by a bit of my will.”</p><p>Hearing this, Gu Xiaosang’s heart slowly sank, sinking deeper and deeper into the frozen ice cave.</p><p>She felt that all the perseverance, all the pride, all the pain, all the courage, all the ruthlessness, all the softness in her heart had been pushed away bit by bit with the words of the Golden Emperor, bit by bit, it was smashed, thrown into the mud, and then crushed into powder.</p><p>So everything was God’s will..</p><p>The mother that she had been calling out to in her heart, the unscrupulous means in order to maintain her independent consciousness, the pride that she knew of the many possibilities and secrets of the Dao fruit in the future, the pride that she thought she had successfully completed the plan to get rid of it.., the false and real feelings that she had deceived the gold emperor were all a joke. They were all arranged by the Gold Emperor and were all destined plays, including the dual cultivation between herself and her husband.</p><p>Apart from these, what else was left for him? Was there still a purpose for his existence?</p><p>Can the other side control my life like this?</p><p>The blurry figure on the throne leaned back slightly and looked down at Gu Xiaosang. He said indifferently,</p><p>“You should know why I’m telling you all this today</p><p>“It’s to stimulate you and make you full of motivation. The stronger you are, the Closer I am to the Dao fruit</p><p>“Of course, if your realm can surpass mine, then I will become the product of you reducing and seeking emptiness. Work hard for this.”</p><p>The various visions of the Great Dao disappeared, and Meng Qi’s figure returned to the current node. However, it seemed as if he was still at the end of the last era of the immemorial era.</p><p>An illusory long river appeared and surrounded him. Time passed, and the passing of time was like this. It was filled with the feeling of the erosion of time and the unbreakable fate. With the river of time that ran through the real world, it was difficult to tell who was real and who was fake.</p><p>The fourth type of abnormal phenomenon on the other side: “Time around the body”!</p><p>The illusory long river around Meng Qi suddenly spread out and overlapped with the river of time and fate in the real world. It kept flowing back into the past and also continued to extend into the future, occupying one possibility after another.</p><p>The source was turbulent. It overflowed the past and the history that Meng Qi had just witnessed. Very soon, it arrived at the beginning of the new era. It drowned the Earth, fire, wind, and water that were ravaging the world, shrank back into tai chi, and returned to chaos. Finally, it was opened up again.., it flowed through absolute nothingness and came to the end of the last era.</p><p>The world was quiet again, and everything seemed illusory. A figure suddenly appeared in front of Meng Qi. It was majestic and ancient, containing all things. The infinite clouds above his head were like dots of fog, and rays of light like water hung down, there were tens of thousands of golden lamps, countless golden lotuses, Jade, and Luo, and other objects.</p><p>It stood there like the overlapping of eras. Layers upon layers of the immortal world’s nine remoteness gathered. It was the beginning of everything, and it was the cause of all the fruits.</p><p>The primordial Lord of Heaven!</p><p>The fifth type of abnormal phenomena on the other shore, “Seeing the primordial beginning”!</p><p>A bright moon that seemed dark and bright gradually formed behind Meng Qi’s head. It was perfect and flawless, giving birth to two illusory dao fruits, “Limitless”and “Splitting open the sky”. He wanted them to slowly become real and become embryonic forms.</p><p>At this critical moment, Meng Ran’s heart moved. A small jade-green tree flew out from his body. It was crystal clear and was covered in a clear light. One branch, one sky, one Earth, one leaf, one universe.</p><p>The tree of Great Dao!</p><p>The tree of Great Dao rose up by itself and fell into the clear round light behind Meng Qi’s head. It took root here and was located in the middle of the two illusory dao fruits!</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Muffled sounds descended from the heavens. They came from the netherworld. Everything was dyed with a blood-like color, as well as a dark color. Layers upon layers of heavens were formed. Layers upon layers of the Netherworld, the vast galaxy, and the boundless universe.., however, they were all connected by a towering and luxuriant tree, and there was an illusory river of time.</p><p>The “Two lives standing side by side”phenomenon that Meng Qi had once witnessed in the legend appeared again, but there was a different change from the past.</p><p>The sixth type of the othershore phenomenon, the “Reconstruction Era”!</p><p>It was a phenomenon that no one had ever witnessed before!</p><p>Seeing this scene, a hand reached out again from the bright and flawless moon. It was white and slender, and it rippled the river of time.</p><p>More than a hundred years ago, Guangchengzi, red sperm, immortal Jade Tripod, and Immortal Venerable Daoist Xing were not annihilated. They were captured by the Gold Emperor and imprisoned in their hometown in the vacuum The sword light that Jiang Zhiwei slashed across the Heaven Immortals and legends was lifted up by Mother Wusheng’s sleeve and put away. The unruly and heroic Gao Lan was trapped by the plain-colored cloud realm flag and did not die. Ruan Yushu was captured before he killed his true spirit, the sound of the zither was faint and endless</p><p>Wang Siyuan’s consciousness had not been completely assimilated by the monster of the Heavenly Dao. A few moments ago, his figure that was thrown toward the dark red vortex was flicked away by the Golden Emperor’s finger. The real world that had been destroyed by the cross-shore battle was blocked by the aftershock, one after another, the Earth was regenerated, the city was rebuilt, and the figures that had been reduced to ashes appeared again. They did not realize that they had died once.</p><p>The figures sitting on the throne waved their sleeves. Guang Chengzi, Chi Jingzi, Gao Lan, Jiang Zhiwei, and Ruan Yushu appeared outside the hollow jade temple. Their eyes were blank, as if they did not understand why they were here.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang once again felt the indifferent and dignified gaze of the metal emperor. She heard his calm words:</p><p>“Do you see that? Everything has been reset. There is no more blood feud.”</p><p>“Under the other shore, one thought can kill and one thought can live. Whether or not they exist and how they should exist depends on the outcome of our game. It is like an illusory dream. If you want them, you can have them. If you want them, you can not have them.”</p><p>“That is why Buddhism says nothing. Taoism says nothing. Other than the struggle for the Great Dao, these are just illusions. What is there to care about?”</p><p>“Su Meng will certainly be like this in the future. This is the other shore.”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang felt an unprecedented chill in her heart. She could not find any warmth.</p><p>Yes, this is the other shore. This is the will of heaven.</p><p>And the will of heaven has been difficult to ask since ancient times.</p><p>At this moment, the phenomenon between heaven and earth disappeared. Meng Qi, dressed in a black robe, walked out of the river of time step by step. He had already reached the other shore. The back of his head was round and bright, the green trees were flourishing, and his eyes seemed to contain all the worlds in the universe, he looked at the Gold Emperor quietly and said,</p><p>“I may be like this in the future, but that is the future. As for the present…”</p><p>He paused for a moment and suddenly shouted,</p><p>“F * ck your old mother!”</p><p>The round light behind his head suddenly expanded and occupied the sky. It shed a boundless light and enveloped the bright moon of the gold emperor!</p><p>In this era, I never thought of transcending and F * ck your old mother’s Karma!</p><p>Gu Xiaosang stared blankly at this scene, suddenly smiled, with tears in it.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
