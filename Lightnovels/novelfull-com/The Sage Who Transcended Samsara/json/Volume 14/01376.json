There was no accumulation of dust, and there were also no signs of decay. The two rows of candles were eternal and always lit up the darkness. The only difference was that it was even more deathly still, it was as if there were millions and millions of years that no living beings had set foot on this place.</p><p>“I really can’t find any traces of a dao master.”Meng Qi looked around. His expression was calm and his eyes were filled with emotion, “I’m afraid that only through the monster of the Heavenly Dao can we grasp the clues. No wonder the few on the other side all judged that the end of the epoch would come. All the products that were created to reduce and seek emptiness would be completely destroyed. Only then would the holy man and the Buddha be able to transcend completely. This epoch is considered the end of the Apocalypse and there is no future. It is all the result of the influence of the two dao fruits secretly.”</p><p>The surroundings were dark, which made Gu Xiaosang look even more ethereal and serene, the dimples on her face were faint as she said, “The heavens left a sliver of hope, which is why the holy man set up the tree of Great Dao to plant hope for the next era after it was completely destroyed. I wonder what Buddha left behind?”</p><p>Meng Qi smiled, he teased, “The realm of dao fruit is unknowable and can not be discussed. It’s wrong as soon as it’s said and wrong as soon as it’s guessed. Your judgment just now might be wrong as well. As for Buddha, I once received a green lamp left behind by him because of Ananda. Although its rank isn’t high, Buddha said that if Buddhism declined in the future and the demons danced wildly, this lamp would illuminate the VIPRALOPA and guide the true treasure. Currently, the two sages in the west are still alive and are all ancient. There’s no sign of the decline of Buddhism at all. vipralopa is probably referring to the end of the era. Although it was destroyed after that, I have always had a deep affinity with Buddha. I even got the general outline of the Tathagata palm. It’s hard to predict what will happen next.”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang looked at him with a faint smile. “So it’s only a matter of time before the true rulai is revealed?”</p><p>“It should be so.”Meng Qi looked around and examined every single pavilion in the purple clouds palace, searching for any remnants. Gu Xiaosang’s eyes were deep, revealing a thoughtful look, “The Buddha has improved the transcendence of the holy man. Although the essence has not changed, he is more inclined to bear the burden of the Mahayana orthodoxy and the fundamental dharma body of Buddhism, Piluchana Buddha. Tang Sanzang, Chentan Merit Buddha, the Supreme True Buddha, the golden cicada shell, and Old Lord Huang, Donghuang Taiyi, and the Heavenly Dao monsters are slightly different.”</p><p>Although the supreme true Buddha’s words of “The only Buddha”were extreme and terrifying, they could be found in the Buddhist scriptures. The Buddha said that “All Buddhas have the same dharma body”, all the Buddhas’golden bodies were different manifestations of this one pure dharma body. This one pure dharma body was called the Piluchana Buddha. Of course, before the birth of the Supreme True Buddha, the Piluchana Buddha was closer to the conceptual title, in fact, it was what the Daoist sect called “Forcefully remembering the Dao”, which was the root of everything. Hence, the Buddha’s words could be understood as saying that all Buddhas had the same root, which was to seek the dao and achieve the “Piluchana Buddha”.</p><p>However, once the Supreme True Buddha was born, he said that he was the piluchana Buddha, the only true Buddha. When the “Dao”became real, things started to become terrifying to the Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Using ye Gong’s good dragon was definitely not accurate enough, there were many mistakes, but they could barely describe it.</p><p>As the couple conversed, the wind howled within the purple clouds palace. Doors were opened one after another, and items were swept out one by one and landed in front of Meng Qi. There were not many of them, but they all looked dull and dull. The divine items were self-obscuring!</p><p>After careful inspection, the two discovered that there were stone steles that were stained with the aura of the immemorial underworld. There was the central Wuji soil where humans, ghosts, demons, and demons were mixed together, which was also where the first great dao tree was planted, there were also stone spears and stone swords that exuded a sense of desolation. They seemed to be able to be used to refine peerless items. Other than that, there was also a calabash of pills and a feeling of being close to the Great Luo.</p><p>“There are still many things left in the residence of the Holy Man.”Meng Qi sighed. Compared to the Purple Clouds Palace, the Jade Void Palace had only a few treasures left due to its previous opening, although he could also simulate the various eras and eras with the myriad worlds in his body, and then control the flow of time to obtain different treasures as if he was creating something out of thin air, it was still too troublesome, some could only take shape when it involved the transcending real world.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang smiled sweetly and said, “The fall of Zhenwu, these are ownerless items. They should be a wedding gift for us.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded, he smiled and said, “Today, I finally understand why the Devil Buddha wanted to find out the whereabouts of Emperor Zhenwu. On one hand, he is a Daoist boy, and he is involved in the Donghuang Taiyi, the monster of Heavenly Dao, the ancient fusang tree, the tree of Great Dao, and the Green Emperor. If we are not careful, he might make a big news. On the other hand, Zhenwu knows the whereabouts of the purple clouds palace. If he can find this place before earth is exposed, it will be very disadvantageous to the secret of him and me that the Devil Buddha is hiding.”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang was no stranger to the word “News”after her trip to Earth. She put away the treasures on the ground with a smile and left the purple clouds palace together with Meng Qi. Some of them could be given to the Yuxu sect even if they could not use them themselves, they did not need to be as shabby as before.</p><p>Before leaving, Meng Qi closed the gate of the purple clouds palace with a smile on his face. He erased all traces left by the two and made a gesture as if no one had ever set foot in this place before.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang seemed to have guessed something. She said with great interest in her eyes, “My husband is really vengeful for the smallest grievance. He doesn’t have the temperament of the other side at all.”</p><p>“If the temperament of the other side refers to the struggle for the Great Dao in your eyes, then it’s better not to have it,”Meng Qi said with a smile. He reached out and grabbed Gu Xiaosang. In a flash, they returned to the hollow jade temple in Kunlun’s field.</p><p>The chaos was shapeless. No one knew how high or low it was, and no one could tell the time. The purple clouds palace was dark for an unknown amount of time. Suddenly, a ray of light pierced through the layers of obstacles in front of the gate.</p><p>On the head of Tan Ping, the reincarnation of the water ancestor, there was a bead that was beginning to crack. The wave of light was struggling to resist the corrosion of the chaos nearby. This was a rare treasure that his godly body had collected since the beginning of time, it was called the “Eternal Pearl of Heaven”. It could barely enter the chaos and head to the place where it was infused, but it could not stay there for long.</p><p>“It’s all thanks to the DAO Mark left behind by the true martial emperor.”Tan Ping was the reincarnation of an ancient heavenly god, but he could not help but be overjoyed. This was one of the two transcending cultivators’training grounds, furthermore, he didn’t experience the great battle on the other shore like Buddha’s spiritual mountain, so he would definitely be pleasantly surprised.</p><p>Similarly, it was also thanks to the blue-blood man that he was able to gather treasures unchangeably throughout the ages. Otherwise, even if he knew the DAO Mark, he wouldn’t be able to enter the chaos now.</p><p>Tan Ping approached the door and got rid of the chaos. He was satisfied to find that the ancient sense of desolation here wasn’t damaged at all.</p><p>“As expected. According to the impression of Emperor Zhenwu, only he knows the location of the Holy Man’s treasure raft and the purple clouds palace.”Tan Ping could not hide his joy. He activated his supernatural power and opened the gate under the protection of the immortal bead of heaven, he stepped into the deep and quiet inner hall.</p><p>After a while, a series of shocked and angry roars came from the inner hall:</p><p>“Nothing?”</p><p>“There’s nothing in the Yi Residence?”</p><p>..</p><p>Inside the hollow jade temple.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang stood up in a myriad of postures. “I’ve gained a lot of insights into the mystery of time and the past from this trip. I need to go into seclusion for a period of time.”</p><p>“Digest it well. Don’t be impatient. Amitabha is the one who is anxious, and it’s mother Wusheng,”Meng Qi reminded her with a smile.</p><p>After Gu Xiaosang sealed the meditation room, he sat on the cloud bed. A bright and clear round light appeared behind his head and gathered the disciples together.</p><p>“What instructions do you have, Hierarch Teacher?”He Mu was in high spirits and was waiting for the wedding.</p><p>Meng Qi was in the chaos. He looked at he mu, Fang huayin, Yu Banshan, Qi jinxiu, and Sun Wu:</p><p>“The calamity is coming again. You will come down to the mortal world to help the human emperor unify the East Sea Islands.”</p><p>“He mu can delay for a while. After the marriage, he can bring Jiu Li with him to show the attitude of the hollow jade temple.”</p><p>The disciples did not dare to have any doubts. They immediately cupped their hands and said,</p><p>“We will obey the Order of the Hierarch Teacher.”</p><p>Therefore, except for he mu, all of them left Kunlun’s field and came to Changmen Island.</p><p>..</p><p>Tan Ping returned to Changmen Island with a gloomy face. He forced a smile so that the almighty would not see the clues.</p><p>Fortunately, at this moment, he found that the yellow millet pillow could be used again, and his mood finally improved. After every use, the recovery time of the yellow millet pillow was getting longer and longer. Today, it was Tan Ping’s second time.</p><p>Lying on the yellow millet pillow, Tan Ping already had a plan in his mind. Other things were not important, but what was important was to leave a clear trace of himself in history. In the future, he could go back to the past and work with the body of a god. It would be twice the result with half the effort.</p><p>The fog was heavy and dark. He suddenly woke up and found that lying in the countryside, the sky was like a play. The nine heavens were faintly discernible, and he could even vaguely feel the existence of his own body of a god.</p><p>“Back to the ancient times?”Tan Ping was overjoyed. He felt that there was no greater opportunity than this.</p><p>In this era, he could find the water god that still existed “Today”and “Enlighten”him, so as to lay a foundation for breaking free from the Sea of pain in the future.</p><p>Tan Ping’s light had just risen when a voice suddenly came from behind him:</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, please wait!”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Tan Ping’s hair stood on end, as if he had fallen into Luo Feng’s black prison.</p><p>As an innate God who had witnessed the ascension of a God, how could he not know the deep “Malice”and lethality contained in this sentence! !</p><p>Thus, he did not turn his head back and ran away frantically.</p><p>PS: I’m stuck here. I’ll ask for a leave of absence at seven o’clock tonight. Think about it carefully and I’ll make up for it at three o’clock tomorrow</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
