The time had come</p><p>Outside Dou Shuai Palace, there were spiritual springs and waterfalls, exotic flowers and plants, immortal birds flying slowly, and spiritual beasts walking slowly. It was a peaceful and peaceful atmosphere.</p><p>The golden-horned boy and the silver-horned boy had been waiting outside the palace door for a long time. When they saw Meng Qi’s figure appear, they bowed respectfully and said,</p><p>“Greetings, uncle-master. My eldest master has asked us to pass on a message to You: when the time comes, we will unite as one.”</p><p>At this moment, for the two boys, it was still before the Battle of Ascension. The one who came to visit was naturally Yuqing, the Grand Supreme Emperor of the Purple Void, the original heavenly venerate of primordial beginning, the leader of the three Pure Ones, and the first of the nine venerables!</p><p>When the time came, they would unite as one? What kind of time would it be? The moment before the end of the epoch? Meng Qi’s expression was expressionless as he nodded slightly. Since the heavenly venerate of morals had already said so much, there was no point in asking any more questions.</p><p>However, he did not turn around and leave. Instead, he smiled and stood in front of the golden-horned and silver-horned boy, as if he was waiting for something.</p><p>At this moment, the golden-horned boy took out two items from his clothes and handed them over respectfully:</p><p>“The first master has instructed me to hand these two treasures to uncle-master.”</p><p>The first of these two items was the fierce and flickering immortal-slaying sword with an ethereal green glow. The other was the formation diagram that was crisscrossed with red, green, black, and white, and suffused with the will of eradication!</p><p>As expected… Meng Qi was not surprised at all and reached out to receive it.</p><p>Then, he realized that the celestial eradication sword and the previous owner’s brand in the formation diagram had been completely erased, leaving no trace behind.</p><p>His fingers touched the cold and sharp body of the sword, and his figure suddenly turned illusory, disappearing in front of the eyes of the golden-horned and silver-horned boy like a bubble. He returned to the hollow jade temple at the current node, and sat in the lotus position on the cloud bed, his mind wandered to the caves of Guang Chengzi, Red Essence, master Yu Ding, and the immortal venerable Daoist Xing.</p><p>The Four Great Abhijnas woke up from their meditation one after another. They opened their eyes and spat out clouds. They turned into streaks of different colors of flowing light, with many vague dao patterns floating in the air. Each of them formed a sword light and threw it toward the hollow jade temple.</p><p>This was the harvest of hundreds of thousands of years that they had mastered the exterminating and slaughtering four great killing swords. It was the corresponding sword scripture that they had learned from the swords!</p><p>Meng Qi’s eyes were half-opened. The immortal-slaying formation patterns that were roaring in green, black, and white were floating in front of him. From time to time, green, white, black, and red sword lights were shot out, interweaving into an illusory immortal-slaying sword formation.</p><p>Four sword lights flew over from the stars in the outer space such as Mount Jiuhua. He extended his right hand, which was dark and gloomy, and grabbed it with the power of the universe in his palm and pressed it on his glabella.</p><p>The light shone in all directions, and the sword scriptures were completely assimilated by Meng Qi. Even the illusory immortal-slaying sword formation was sucked into his “Stomach.”.</p><p>A gust of clear Qi rushed out of his head and turned into three. One was the pure and smiling true rulai, the other was the carefree and carefree Daoist Lord Qingyuan, and the last was the increasingly cold celestial venerable Su Meng, his aura gradually became more and more terminating.</p><p>Celestial Venerable Su Meng was originally an incarnation of Meng Qi after he had learned how to turn one Qi into three pure ones. He had used his accumulated sword techniques to slash out. It was the “Heaven-severing dao body”that had combined the four celestial eradication swords. Now, he wanted to complete the profound mysteries of the sword scriptures and formation diagrams of the four celestial eradication swords, slowly, he adjusted this incarnation to focus on the Numinous Treasure Dao lineage.</p><p>However, just by relying on the cultivation technique, even if it was complete, it was still just an incarnation at the peak of the creation realm. It was impossible to cross the Heavenly Chasm and become the weak shore. It would help Meng Qi’s true body form the embryonic form of the dao fruit with shackles and burdens.</p><p>“Do I have to refine the four celestial eradication swords and the formation diagram into the ‘Celestial Venerable Su Meng’?”Meng Qi thought of a possible method. However, the other three swords of the four celestial eradication swords were in the hands of the green emperor and Amitabha. The former could still be exchanged, after all, he had only recovered to his original level. In this era, he was at most at the level of an ancient. As for the latter, it involved the struggle for the Great Dao. Once he handed it over, it would cut off the possibility of transcendence in this era. There was almost no need to hope for it.</p><p>Was there any other way? For example, by swallowing and assimilating the heavenly dao monster, he could directly complete the heaven-severing body and upgrade it to the weak shore. This would allow the heavenly venerate of morals and the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning to reduce the amount of space they could do to the extreme, however, the heavenly venerate of numinous treasure was obviously lacking… of course, it was the same for him. They were both in the embryonic form of the dao fruit. After becoming an ancient, there was essentially no difference between the incarnation of the heaven-severing body or the true body of Numinous Treasure.</p><p>Would Dao ancestor three purities have made other preparations? Was it because of the end of the epoch?</p><p>As Meng Qi cultivated, he pondered over the possibilities as he deduced the changes that would surpass the various current tributaries in the future.</p><p>Whether or not the three heavenly venerates of primordial beginning, morality, and numinous treasure transcended wasn’t something he cared about. What he cared about was whether or not he could make use of this opportunity to benefit himself and little sang. He might even find an opportunity to eliminate the fiend Buddha and the Golden Emperor!</p><p>Surrounded by darkness, he seemed to be hiding in the depths of the chaos. His expression was indifferent and there was not the slightest ripple.</p><p>..</p><p>Time flowed like water. In the blink of an eye, more than thirty years had passed. Even with Yang Jian holding the Wuji Apricot flag at the center of the world to guard the Western Region and the seven kills Daoist holding the netherworld sea sword to isolate the southernmost part of the Eastern Sea.., the natural disasters in the real world were still growing at a speed visible to the naked eye. The southernmost part of the world was melting and the surface of the sea was rising. The previously prosperous islands and continents along the sea had disappeared under the cover of the Azure Blue. The will of death pervaded the multiverse, it brought the end of the world again and again.</p><p>Devil Buddha Ananda sat at the bottom of the nine nether world with a smile in his eyes. No one knew who he was looking at.</p><p>Suddenly, he patted his knees and said leisurely,</p><p>“The time has come!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The nine nether world was boiling instantly. The Gobi Desert in the western region and the extreme south of the eastern sea were like two huge volcanoes erupting. Pitch-black flames and dark mist were spewing out, bringing the scene of the end of the world.</p><p>“The time has come…”inside the hollow jade temple, Meng Qi slowly opened his eyes. The interior was so deep and quiet that it seemed like the beginning of everything.</p><p>He clenched his right hand out of thin air, and the Ksitigarbha Pure Land where Xuan Bei was located suddenly contracted and drilled into the indestructible ship of Armageddon. Waves of golden flames rose, burning glass, and a strange light shot into the sky, it pulled at the aura of Armageddon in the real world.</p><p>Time flew by. In the blink of an eye, a thousand years had passed, and the ship of Armageddon had become abnormally large. Its head and tail spanned across billions of calamities. Its surface was covered with a layer of pale golden glass, and the empty space was filled with pure lotuses. It had the feeling of returning to the world after death, it also had the feeling of transcendence.</p><p>Xuan bei sat cross-legged on the Golden Lotus platform on the deck. The ghosts around him were at a loss. At a glance, there were countless rooms in the ship. It was more than a trillion, and it could hold all kinds of creatures.</p><p>“Nanwu Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva…”Xuan bei chanted in a low voice.</p><p>He knew that this “Crossing the World Treasure Raft”was not complete yet, and he still had to wait for something else.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Thunder rumbled in the sky, and shadows danced. Lightning and fire fell from time to time, but they were blocked by the pure white lotus or the power of humanity.</p><p>Seeing this scene, on the remaining islands in the East China Sea, the people prayed even more for the protection of the human emperor. In the original territory of the Great Zhou, the believers became more and more devout, hoping that Holy Mother White Lotus would save the world.</p><p>Sensing the change in the Heavenly Dao, Gu Xiaosang suddenly stood up in the hollow jade temple and descended to the lower realm. She became one with Holy Mother White Lotus and could no longer be separated from her.</p><p>She formed a seal with her hands, looking solemn and holy. She smiled and said,</p><p>“The opportunity has arrived!”</p><p>With the arrival of the end of the world, the people were hoping for a savior. It was the opportunity to break free from the sea of bitterness and reach the other shore!</p><p>The opportunity could not be missed. If it was lost, it would not come again. If it was decided, it would be thrown into chaos!</p><p>As for the past, looking back at the past and peering into the future, after many years of seclusion, they had accumulated enough!</p><p>In the Nirvana world, the Bodhi Pure Land, the home of the vacuum, the nine Netherworld immortal world, and other places on the other shore, many high and mighty gazes looked over.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
