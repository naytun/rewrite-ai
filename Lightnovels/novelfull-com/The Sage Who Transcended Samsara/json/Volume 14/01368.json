He suddenly woke up, bowed his head, and cupped his hands:</p><p>“As you command, Master.”</p><p>He didn’t say anything more. He turned around and walked out of the Jade Pure Palace. He set up his escape light and left Kunlun’s field, heading straight for the Monster Race’s star field. He felt hot and humid all over, and he couldn’t breathe properly.</p><p>This time, he mu didn’t conceal his aura. He disguised himself as a monster, and his sword light was vast and mighty. Like an upside-down heavenly river, it cut through the dark starry sky and shot toward the boundary of the vast star field.</p><p>Sensing this aura, countless strange lights suddenly rose from a planet full of demons. There were pure white, green, and red. They converged into a huge monster with the head of a tiger and the body of a human. It was as big as a star.</p><p>“Stop, human! What are you doing in our demon galaxy?”The monster, which was so huge that it was terrifying, shouted sternly. The only legendary aura in all the worlds spread out and turned into a barrier, blocking he mu from the Sea of stars.</p><p>He Mu stopped the sword light and revealed himself. He said in a clear voice,</p><p>“I am he mu, a disciple of the original Celestial Master of the Jade Void Palace of Kunlun’s field. I am here to pay a visit to the monster Emperor Palace under the Order of the Hierarch Master.”</p><p>A man’s name was like the shadow of a tree. When he heard “The original Celestial Master of the Jade Void Palace of Kunlun’s Field”, the little saint who was guarding the border of the Monster Race’s star field could not help but restrain his aura. He subconsciously softened his tone:</p><p>“You said that you came here under the decree of heavenly venerate Su. Do you have any proof?”</p><p>Since the beginning of the new age, there had been very few people who were truly important figures on the other side. In today’s world, if one did not count monsters of the Heavenly Dao, Supreme True Buddhas, and other abnormal products, there were only nine people who had escaped the sea of bitterness, they stood at the top of all the worlds in the universe and looked down on all living beings. The heavenly venerate origin of the jade void Temple of Kunlun’s field, Su Meng, was one of them!</p><p>Facing such a big figure, unless one was as arrogant as the Monkey King, who would not show some respect?</p><p>He Mu laughed when he heard that. “You are thinking too much. If I were to lie about this, there would be divine lightning descending from the heavens and I would be reduced to ashes. More importantly, would the demon Empress not know if it is true or not?”</p><p>The tiger-headed little saint was stunned for a moment before he reacted. If the other party was really a fake, would the demon empress, who was a big figure on the other shore, not be able to detect it? He wouldn’t even be able to get close to the Demon Emperor Palace!</p><p>After he figured out what was going on, the huge figure disappeared. A beam of white light flew out of the planet and turned into a huge tiger with wings on its back. It said in a muffled voice, “I’ll bring you to the Demon Emperor Palace.”</p><p>The clouds followed the dragon and the wind followed the tiger. The wind whistled. He Mu felt as if he was surrounded by a fierce wind. He couldn’t tell what was inside and entered the mysterious and unpredictable other world at an unimaginable speed. However, he didn’t think about this at all, instead, he was anxiously waiting to see if he would meet her during this trip to the demon race’s star field?</p><p>As the sound of the wind faded, he Mu’s vision returned to normal. He saw an ancient and majestic palace. At the door stood a lady in a crimson dress. She had a beautiful face, and her aura was elegant and elegant. She was naturally noble.</p><p>Dong Dong Dong! As she saw this lady, he Mu’s heart started to beat faster. Even though he used the Yuan Xin seal, he could not control it. This was the beautiful figure that he had been dreaming about for more than a hundred years.</p><p>Because of the connection between Haotian’s blood and his body, he had been in contact with Phoenix Jiuli ever since he escaped from the nine Phoenix Grand Sage’s residence. They discussed cultivation and shared their experiences, as well as his experience of “Pretending”to be a human and traveling around the real world, their feelings for each other were deep. After a period of time, they had been secretly engaged for the rest of their lives.</p><p>Just as he mu was thinking about how to beat around the bush and tell Jiuli his real identity bit by bit, Jiuli suddenly left home and sneaked into the real world to find her lover. He Mu was completely unprepared, he Mu didn’t have time to disguise as a demon at all and was caught red-handed.</p><p>Jiuli hated his deception and returned to the demon star area in anger. During that time, he mu encountered the destruction of Kunlun Mountain, his master’s escape to the nine serenities realm, and his family’s exile in the East Sea. He was in a terrible mood. When he recovered.., jiuli wanted to apologize and comfort him, but she was already deeply resentful. She cut off all contact with him, and there was no response. Thus, she was lonely to this day.</p><p>How could it be such a coincidence that it was her turn to guard the Demon Emperor Hall? Was It Luck or punishment?</p><p>Sensing the arrival of the two auras, Jiuli looked over and just happened to meet he Mu’s eyes.</p><p>The ripples in her beautiful eyes shook violently, and then a layer of coldness covered them. She looked at the legendary mighty figure indifferently and said, “Flying Tiger Little Saint, why are you here?”</p><p>Flying Tiger Little Saint felt that the atmosphere was a little strange, but he didn’t think too much about it. He said in a rumbling voice, “This is the disciple of Celestial Master Su, the Sect Master of the Jade Void Palace of Kunlun’s field. He has been ordered to come and pay a visit to the empress. Please go in and inform her.”</p><p>The disciple of Celestial Master of origin Su Meng… Jiu Li wasn’t surprised. She seemed to have known about it for a long time. She turned around and stepped into the monster Emperor Palace.</p><p>He Mu wanted to let out a sigh to ease his mind, but it turned into a sigh when it reached his mouth. The bitterness and loneliness were even more intense than before.</p><p>The Flying Tiger Little Saint glanced at him and felt that the human race was really strange.</p><p>After a while, Jiu Li walked out and said calmly, “The empress asked me to bring him in.”</p><p>The Flying Tiger Little Saint gave up his job and didn’t stay any longer. He immediately left. He Mu followed behind Jiu Li and watched the crimson figure walk forward like a flower and a willow. His lips moved as if he wanted to say something, however, he was frozen by the ice-cold atmosphere.</p><p>The entire journey was silent and the atmosphere was awkward. Unknowingly, he mu noticed that Jiu Li had stopped in her tracks. In front of him were layers of curtains and a figure could be seen faintly.</p><p>He did not know when, but he had already arrived in front of the Demon Emperor!</p><p>He suddenly woke up and bowed solemnly:</p><p>“Junior he mu pays his respects to the Demon Emperor.”</p><p>The lofty and gentle voice of the Monster Emperor rang out. “There’s no need to be so formal.”</p><p>He Mu forced himself to be spirited. He took out a book slip and handed it over with both hands. He said respectfully, “The Hierarch teacher instructed me to pass this book slip to the Empress.”</p><p>The book slip flew into the layers of curtains without any wind. The Monster Emperor stretched out his hand and caught it. He said calmly as if he had expected it:</p><p>“Fellow Daoist Su has proposed marriage to the monster race on your behalf. I wish to marry Jiuli.”</p><p>“What?”Not only he mu, but also Jiuli, whose face was full of frost, blurted out.</p><p>They had never thought that a celestial, a big shot from the other side, would send a letter to the demon Emperor Palace for such a trivial matter!</p><p>Although it was a lifelong relationship for them, in the eyes of the other side celestial, it was no more important than a dream!</p><p>After the shock, they quickly regained their composure. Since the demon Empress had spoken, it was definitely true.</p><p>No wonder it was such a coincidence today!</p><p>He Mu instinctively felt uneasy. He couldn’t help but look at Jiuli. He didn’t know if he was looking forward to it or if he was afraid of something. Jiuli’s face alternated between green and red. Countless thoughts surged in her mind, and she felt angry, dissatisfied, and rebellious.</p><p>Could it be that her dao partner was just going to let the two big shots on the other shore have the final say, and her own will wasn’t important at all?</p><p>Sensing her emotional fluctuations, he mu’s eyes revealed tenderness. He took a deep breath, gritted his teeth, took a step forward, cupped his hands, and said firmly,</p><p>“Your Highness, this junior didn’t know about this matter before, nor did I know about Miss Jiuli’s wishes. If she doesn’t want to marry down, please don’t force her. As for my master, this junior will go back and explain it to her. I will bear the responsibility.”</p><p>Hearing this, Jiuli was stunned. The many thoughts in her heart faded one after another. She turned her head to look at he mu, as if she had gotten to know him again. There was less anger and hatred in her eyes.</p><p>The Demon Emperor’s tone was still calm and there was not the slightest bit of anger. “You mean that if Jiuli is willing, you are willing to accept it?”</p><p>As soon as these words were said, he MU’s state of mind and cultivation that he had been in for many years instantly collapsed. His face turned red in embarrassment, and Jiuli’s cheeks were also covered with a layer of red.</p><p>The Demon Empress’question was so embarrassing!</p><p>He Mu’s thoughts spun quickly. In the end, he followed her thoughts and said as if he had used his sword in the past:</p><p>“Your Highness, this junior is indeed very willing…”</p><p>As he finished speaking, his voice gradually became softer, but he still insisted on finishing his sentence.</p><p>Jiu Li instantly felt embarrassed. She lowered her head, and all kinds of happiness, anger, and resentment in the past rose up. They gathered into a mess, and she did not know how to react.</p><p>Behind the layers of curtains, the demon emperor turned to look at Jiu Li:</p><p>“I won’t force you on this matter. What do you think?”</p><p>He Mu looked over with a whoosh. There was desire, fear, loneliness, and bitterness in her eyes.</p><p>Jiu Li’s thoughts surged. For a moment, she could not tell if it was hatred or happiness. After a long time, she looked up and said coldly, “Celestial Master Su has personally proposed to him. How can I refuse?”</p><p>“Well, you seem to be willing.”The Monster Emperor wouldn’t be deceived by Jiu Li’s words, and a hint of a smile appeared in his tone.</p><p>Hearing this, Jiu Li’s cheeks were redder than the fire in the river, and she was so embarrassed that she wanted to turn around and leave. On the other hand, he mu felt as if fireworks had exploded in his heart, shining brightly.</p><p>Looking at Jiu Li, whose half of her back was facing him, he mu suddenly thought of the past.</p><p>He Mu, who had been practicing the sword stiffly in the Green Peak Dojo, had never imagined that he would have such a future when he saw Mr. Su wearing a cloak, having a small fire in the red furnace, and reciting poems while drinking wine.</p><p>Fate was truly amazing.</p><p>… ..</p><p>In the goddess Goddess’realm, the nine heavens mystical maiden Liu Luo was inhaling and exhaling dense mist while her mind was wandering outside of things.</p><p>Suddenly, she had a thought and opened her eyes. She saw waves of light surging in front of her, transforming into the figure of an emperor.</p><p>“Greetings, Your Majesty.”Liu Luo stood up and bowed. It was unknown whether he was happy or surprised.</p><p>The heavenly emperor said calmly, “Your Majesty.”</p><p>“Go to the Monster Emperor Palace on my behalf.”</p><p>“As an ancient man, the monster Emperor has never shown any signs of reducing or seeking emptiness. I don’t know whether he is hiding something or has other ideas.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
