Where else can we go?”</p><p>The majestic voice of the Celestial Emperor seemed to ring directly in the heart of Daoist seven kills. It shook the ocean of his calm thoughts and shook the spiritual light of his nature, which lived in an infinite high place. It made him feel deeply terrified, surrounded by despair, and had no desire to fight at all, he was only so-so when he was surrounded by enemies. He wanted to put down the sword in his hand, lower his head, and submit to the other party in exchange for protection.</p><p>With this thought, the netherworld sea sword suddenly trembled. The flowerless and traceless pitch-black blade emitted rings of killing intent, cutting off the hesitation, fear, and despair in Daoist seven kills’s heart, and shattering the time that had frozen like amber around him.</p><p>Daoist seven kills’s eyes flickered with a fierce light, containing the purest and most original killing intent. His Dao body transformed into light, and when it was incorporated into the Netherworld Sea Evil Sword, a dark sword light that could kill everything in the world rose up, cutting through time and the long river, it brought a pause in time and space and slashed toward the heavenly emperor. It wanted to cut down the symbol of this era and kill the foundation of the existence of all things.</p><p>The heavenly emperor was hazy, as if he was separated by thousands of mountains and rivers. He calmly extended his hand and the sword light gathered, forming a small wave of light that was right in front of the dark stream. The two solidified at the same time at the gap between the boundless chaos and the long river of time, it seemed to have evolved into a vivid picture.</p><p>Suddenly, the light burst out, penetrating the dark sword light and extending to the past that had long passed. It connected the illusory time and the river of fate. Figures appeared in it. They were all the seven kills Taoist from the past.</p><p>The past that he had been cut off by the netherworld sea sword was “Forced out”by the celestial emperor again at this moment. The illusory brand became a real existence!</p><p>The past reappeared. Daoist seven kills was sleeping outside the world, waiting for the arrival of the Apocalypse and the instructions of the Devil Buddha. The seven kills tablet stood in front of him.</p><p>Silently, the seven kills tablet glowed with a hazy light on its own. As if it had awakened some brand, it suddenly flew toward Daoist seven kills and enveloped him.</p><p>The Celestial Emperor had already turned back time and left an indelible mark on the celestial emperor stone tablet that originally belonged to him. It continued until it turned into the seven kills tablet and continued until the “Present”that suddenly attacked him!</p><p>With a flash of Dark Light, the Netherworld Sea sword pierced through time and shot out from between the brows of the seven kills Daoist. With a clang, it hit the stone tablet, causing it to lose its clear light, lose its vitality, and begin to rot.</p><p>At this moment, the seven kills Daoist had achieved success in his cultivation and was about to set off a monstrous killing calamity in the real world. His expression was blank, and his fear was concealed. He saw himself standing in a palm that seemed to be able to cover the sky, he was as small as dust, and this palm was pitch-black and evil. It was floating with a red and black luster, and reverse ten thousand symbols could be vaguely seen on it.</p><p>Looking at the palm, it was a dirty and deep arm. This arm was just an ordinary arm among the twenty to thirty arms. It was neither holding a human skin wooden fish nor a white bone rosary.</p><p>The owner of these arms was a terrifying evil demon that filled the heavens. It looked like a wise king of fear or a fallen Buddha. Dozens of eyes were staring at Daoist seven kills with a cruel smile, it was the Devil Buddha who had turned Daoist seven kills into his puppet!</p><p>“You can escape for a while, but you can’t escape for a lifetime. Surrender Again!”</p><p>The Devil Buddha’s voice rumbled and shook the heavens. He used the methods of intimidation, bewitching, and seduction to the extreme.</p><p>Daoist seven kills trembled. The fear that even the netherworld sea sword could not kill him spread throughout his body. He only wanted to surrender and serve him respectfully. He wanted to live in humiliation and wait for the future.</p><p>His glabella split open, and the Netherworld Sea Sword shot out again. A dim light shot straight at the Devil Buddha, disturbing the voice of the bewitching God.</p><p>However, in this way, the history of fighting against the Heavenly Emperor was suddenly in danger. The light of Buddha shone on these two parts of history, and the voice of “Put down the butcher’s knife and become Buddha on the spot”echoed in Daoist seven kills’s ears.</p><p>Amitabha did not give up and attacked again!</p><p>Even if it was an old man, the netherworld sea sword could only resist for a few breaths at most. Now, facing the three of them, there was no way to escape. Therefore, a sense of despair and coldness occupied Daoist seven kills’s mind. Even because he could not go back in time.., just by relying on the Netherworld Sea Sword to transmit the battle scenes, he could not even grasp the details. He felt that fate was completely in the hands of the other party. He could only hope that the three old men were wary of each other and restrained each other.</p><p>At this time, in one of history, outside the world of the old demon of Black Mountain.</p><p>The exhausted Taoist seven kills looked at the Little Grandmaster of external scenery in front of him and heard him blurt out in shock, “You are the real old demon of Black Mountain!”</p><p>He smiled slightly:</p><p>“The Dharma body is in a deep sleep, shedding out a split soul, experiencing reincarnation, and waiting for the great calamity. It is a good way to extend life, but he actually wants to reflect on his previous life and eliminate the past. He really overestimates himself.”</p><p>“All of his schemes and plans are in my eyes. There are no secrets at all. Such an ending is fated. Do you think so?”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he suddenly realized that the Puny Grandmaster opposite him had a leisurely smile on his face. He raised his hand and pointed, and his voice drifted into his ears:</p><p>“His fate is fated, and the ending can not be changed. What about you? Are you willing to accept your own fate as fated?”</p><p>This… he was not a weak grandmaster, but a big figure on the other shore! Numerous images flashed in Daoist seven kills’mind, causing him to freeze.</p><p>Combined with the bits and pieces that the netherworld sea sword transmitted over, he saw the “Present”situation of his own despair. He saw the giant palm of Buddhist light, the clear light stone tablet, and the red and black reverse ten thousand characters.</p><p>Fated to be unable to escape?</p><p>Was he really willing to do so?</p><p>Wasn’t this puny exterior master in front of him also controlled by others in the past? He could not control himself, but he eventually broke free from the control and jumped out of the sea of bitterness. He had achieved the true Nirvana realm!</p><p>As long as there was a glimmer of hope, a glimmer of hope, he would never give up!</p><p>As he thought, he saw a clear and perfect treasure light rise behind the head of Meng Qi, who was clearly only in the grandmaster realm. It shone into his mind and soul. He said in an ethereal yet grand manner,</p><p>“I have borrowed the help of the seven kills tablet several times, and I am here today to return the favor.”</p><p>“If you enter the Hollow Jade Temple, you will be a guest. You will not be my servant, nor will you be my puppet. If you have the opportunity to reach the other shore in the future, I am willing to lend you a hand.”</p><p>“It’s just that you are too murderous. You still have to read your morals and refine your essence heart.”</p><p>Daoist seven kills was stunned. He did not expect that the primordial Lord of Heaven, Su Meng, would still remember this small karma of his. Seeing that there was no way out, it seemed that the best choice was to shelter him in the hollow jade temple.</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi’s smiling expression became solemn as he shouted,</p><p>“In today’s world, any other shore can cooperate with the Devil Buddha in the future, but this humble Daoist will never do so. Fellow Daoist, do you still have any hesitation?”</p><p>That’s right, the primordial Lord of Heaven, Su Meng, and the Devil Buddha had no relationship with each other. They could not live under the same sky! Daoist seven kills thought quickly and finally made up his mind. He lowered his head and bowed respectfully:</p><p>“Greetings, Hierarch Heavenly Venerate!”</p><p>“Good!”Meng Qi laughed. The ultimate infinite primordial Qi flew out from the top of his head. With a wave of his sleeve, he put Daoist seven kills and the Netherworld Sea sword into it, making his past and future possible to be pulled and curled up by the infinite, he avoided the huge palm of the Devil Buddha, the clear light of the stone tablet that enveloped him, and the sound of Amitabha putting down his knife. He rolled into a small ball of chaos and followed his original body into his sleeve.</p><p>Then, he put away the clear round light and the chaotic Qing Yun behind his head. He put his sleeve behind his back and leisurely returned to the hollow jade temple.</p><p>In the world, everything returned to calm.</p><p>When Meng Qi waved his sleeve again and released the seven kills Daoist, his past and future began to be affected by the Netherworld Sea sword again. He was cut off again and again, leaving only his brand. There was no need to worry about being quietly affected by the other shores.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged in the Jade Pure Palace, Daoist seven kills crossed his sword and sat on his knees. He looked at Meng Qi, the primordial Lord of Heaven, who lived in the dark and chaotic world, as if he had become a world of his own. His gaze flickered, and his emotions were complicated. Finally, he let out a long sigh, stood up, and bowed, he left respectfully and read his morals in the meditation room.</p><p>..</p><p>After failing to subdue Daoist seven kills, the celestial emperor did not feel dejected. Instead, he returned to the highest level of the nine heavens and returned to the surroundings of the withered tree.</p><p>With a deep gaze, he suddenly stretched out his right hand and slashed out a shimmering blade light toward the immortal world below, stirring up the mysterious and subtle years.</p><p>The heavenly soldiers, Heavenly Generals, and star officer divine lords who were frozen in the fragments of the immortal world immediately recovered the loss of their vitality. They “Walked”out from the still time and revived to greet the celestial emperor.</p><p>In this process, the lower the realm, the less affected by the eternal time. At the legendary level, it was difficult to survive in this way.</p><p>Countless heavenly soldiers, heavenly generals, star officers, and Divine Lords returned. It was as if they had fallen into a deep sleep from the ancient times to the current node. It made the dead and lonely immortal world regain its color, noisy and lively, however, the third and second levels that were destroyed by Meng Qi, as well as the battlefield where they fought on the other shore, could no longer be restored.</p><p>As his former subordinates woke up one by one, the heavenly emperor’s body constantly flickered with a faint light. It was as if he had lit up the bright stars one by one and strung them into a sea of light. From the countless weak buffs, he refined the authority of the past!</p><p>The things that had not ended in the ancient times, the end of the world would be completely over!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
