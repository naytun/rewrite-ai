White waves rushed out of the head of Maitreya’s golden body of the future Buddha. There were two SARIRAS rolling about, symbolizing the past and present SARIRAS, while the future was bleak, there were only dots of Buddhist light that looked like white lotuses that flickered sparsely.</p><p>At this time, all the living beings in the Buddhist kingdom on Earth seemed to have realized something. They sat in the lotus position, worshipped the Buddha devoutly, and chanted the honorific title of Maitreya together:</p><p>“Nan Wudang, come down and give birth to Maitreya!”</p><p>Billions of voices shook the heavens, resounding across all the worlds. They turned into white lotuses that flew to the top of Maitreya’s head and converged into a brilliant galaxy, lighting up the future together!</p><p>The illusory time and the river of fate appeared, seemingly real and illusory, covering every corner of the real world. The past was leisurely, but the future was uncertain.</p><p>In the Western Paradise, the Golden Buddha sitting on the twelfth-grade green lotus throne suddenly lowered his left hand and made a fearless seal. He said with compassion and pity,</p><p>“Good, good, good.”</p><p>Before he finished his sentence, his entire body bloomed with endless light, illuminating the western paradise, illuminating the dark and mysterious chaos, illuminating the universe, illuminating the Buddhist kingdom on the ground, and letting the lotus flowers bloom, it made clear springs surge.</p><p>“Amitabha Buddha of the South!”Over billions of years and many eras, the Buddhist chant penetrated through the restraints of the river of time. Golden Buddhas appeared one after another in response to the chanting of the living beings in the Buddhist kingdom on the ground. They were vast and mighty.., they were endless, as if the real world had become an ocean of Buddhas!</p><p>Although these Buddhas looked different, they all had the aura of Amitabha Buddha. They were the different bodies that had manifested in the world according to Karma over the many epochs. Now that they had merged into a vast sea of Buddhas.., they actually had the feeling of crossing the shore of time!</p><p>At the same time, the twelfth-grade green lotus throne under the Golden Buddha suddenly expanded and merged with the vast and boundless Elysium World, turning into a perfect, flawless, light golden giant Buddha full of redemption. The Buddha light behind its head was heavy, there were a total of 48 wheels, and a solemn and grand voice of the power of will was heard:</p><p>“If I attain bodhi, there will be hell, hungry ghosts, and beasts in the world, and I won’t be able to attain supreme enlightenment.”</p><p>..</p><p>The 48 great wishes that had opened up the path to becoming a dao in the immemorial years once again reappeared in the world!</p><p>As for the six-foot-tall golden body, its expression was benevolent, and its eyes were filled with pity. Both of its hands formed a seal, and it was enveloped by the boundless light that had bloomed before. It was like a sun that illuminated the mysteries of the heavens, and it would eventually return to the void.</p><p>The light filled the heaven and earth, connecting the Sea of Buddha and the light golden giant Buddha. It made everything hazy and dreamy.</p><p>After Amitabha attained the Dao with his body, he cultivated his dharma body and Ying body to the other shore. His Dharma returned to the completion of his three bodies. He was one of the strongest ancient people!</p><p>Amitabha, the Sanskrit word ‘Wu’, Amitabha, meant ‘quantity’. Amitabha Buddha, boundless light, boundless lifespan, boundless technique, boundless virtue, boundless compassion, and boundless divine ability!</p><p>At this critical moment, the oldest Buddha went all out and descended first. He brought the real world under his control and protected Maitreya from the Sea of pain.</p><p>At this moment, a golden bridge flew over from the 33 heavens. It was placed on the Sea of pain and connected to the other shore. With a thought, it extended to the Sea of Buddha.</p><p>The “Amitabha of the south”and the 48 wishes stopped abruptly as if they were completely suppressed by the Golden Bridge.</p><p>At the other end of the bridge, the white-haired and white-bearded Celestial Master of Morals rode on the Green Bull and walked into the Sea of boundless Buddhist light formed by the Amitabha’s dharma retribution. He pushed his Daoist crown and rushed out a wave of clear air, he turned into three Daoists with a weak aura of the other shore. The young ones were vigorous and full of vitality at the beginning. The middle-aged ones were mature and dignified. They suppressed the world and maintained operation. The old ones were old and decayed, it was like the end of everything that could not escape.</p><p>One Qi turned into three pure ones!</p><p>The two most powerful existences of the other shore collided again. Boundless light, boundless longevity, and boundless pure land of Bliss were destroyed and reborn again. The two were in a stalemate. Those who were not on the other shore could not see the specific battle.</p><p>Seeing this, a faint sigh came from the demon Emperor Palace and flew out of the Mountain River Map.</p><p>This map showed the universe, the underworld, the Yellow Springs, the Sun, the Moon, and the stars. It looked down from above and wanted to completely envelop the entire Buddhist kingdom on Earth. What was even more terrifying was that the map split into two, the power of humanity that was like the lights of tens of thousands of families and the aura of all living beings of the vast and savage monster race appeared. The two combined into the water-like saint virtue, and they each had the feeling of shaking the past and the future!</p><p>At this moment, on Changmen Island in the East Sea, Gao Lan pointed with his finger and the sword of the human emperor flew out. It was sprinkled with light gold and filled with holy virtue. In the hall of the demi-human emperor, Fox Qingqiu also took out the demon Saint Spear. Surrounded by the five virtues, dark flames rose up.</p><p>The two peerless divine weapons were thrown into the sides of the map of mountains and rivers, as if they were held by two hands on the other side!</p><p>Nuwa was both the demi-human emperor and the human ancestor!</p><p>Moreover, the current situation was different from the past. When it came to the battle for Dao Fruits, if the ancient Bodhi Buddha had not sent out the quasi-mention, nuwa would have tacitly agreed to the outcome. She had to give it her all!</p><p>In the Bodhi Pure Land, the ancient and quiet Buddha sighed as well. In the real world, he suddenly pressed down on a giant Buddha palm that covered the heavens. It was green in color and shined with wisdom. At the same time.., daoist Zizhang, who was wearing a double bun, held the seven treasures wonderful tree and let out a strange light. Together with the Buddha palm, they blocked the mountain and river map that was combined with the human emperor sword and the demon Saint Spear!</p><p>The light soared like rain. There was no pure land in the real world. Daoist Zizhang protected all the living beings in the Buddha kingdom on the ground. His gaze was cast toward Changle City, which was covered by the Endless River of time, and toward Maitreya, who was still gathering power.., he made the sarira take shape into the illusory dao fruit.</p><p>“Amitabha and ancient Bodhi Buddha have made their moves. Although they have stopped the celestial venerable of morality and the Monster Emperor, there are still the green emperor, the Devil Buddha, and the Golden Emperor, as well as the Supreme True Buddha and the monster of the Heavenly Dao who will be controlled. Even if the Hierarch heavenly venerate wants to help Maitreya and form a good relationship with Amitabha, in case the Hierarch’s wife tries to attack the other shore, I’m afraid he won’t be able to do it…”</p><p>“Even with the emperor fu under Amitabha’s control, the strength of both sides is completely out of proportion. Maitreya looks like he will die from external causes and completely fall. There is no hope for the position of Buddha anymore…”</p><p>Just as Daoist Cihang’s thoughts were racing, his eyes suddenly turned bright white. He could no longer see anything else and felt the majesty and restraint from the “Dao”as if he had encountered a natural enemy that he would never be able to resist.</p><p>The Supreme True Buddha made his move… he sighed in his heart.</p><p>The aftershock of the battle between Amitabha, the heavenly venerate of morality, the ancient Bodhi Buddha, and the Monster Emperor had turned into a sea of light. It was extremely pure and did not allow for any miscellaneous items. There was a pure white Buddha in it that was difficult to look at directly!</p><p>As soon as the Supreme True Buddha appeared, he immediately “Flew”out all the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Arhats in the sky. His golden body stood in a forest, and colored glass filled the sky. One of his hands pointed to the sky, the other touched the ground, or his thumb and middle finger touched the ground. He held an invisible flower in his hand, each of them performed a tathagata divine palm.</p><p>The divine palm returns to one to create a new era!</p><p>In the Jade Void Palace of Kunlun’s field, Meng Qi, who was sitting in a quiet and deep hall, looked at the Supreme True Buddha about to unleash a terrifying “New era”against Maitreya. However, he felt the malice and prying eyes from all directions, from the past and the future.</p><p>That was the devil Buddha’s undisguised gaze. He was waiting for himself to make a move. In this cross-shore contest that was destined to fail, he would seize the opportunity to create a situation where he was besieged by the Monsters of the Heavenly Dao in order to achieve perfection.</p><p>Meng Qi’s expression did not change. He extended his left hand and threw the three ruyi into the real world.</p><p>The golden flowers were stained with black and yellow, and the Purple Qi was deep. They were like multicolored light, the water was moist, and the ripples of the saint’s virtue surrounded the three ruyi. They smashed toward the Supreme True Buddha’s head in an omnipresent manner, directly splitting the Buddha’s light, they penetrated the restriction and seemed to be difficult to block!</p><p>At this moment, the bright and full moon lit up the sky. A flawless white finger suddenly pointed at the side of the Three Treasures Ruyi. It expanded in darkness, and the chaos was like an ocean, it used the reversal of the five Supreme Dao to assimilate the virtue, virtue, and saint’s virtue, and it did not cause the slightest ripple.</p><p>The four sword lights, red, green, black, and white, flew out from the bright moon and stabbed into the four corners of the hollow jade temple. The lights intersected, and the sword qi intertwined. They combined with the formation diagram that was released later to form a complete immortal-slaying sword formation.</p><p>The number one killing formation in the immemorial era!</p><p>The gold emperor still needed Meng Qi to protect Gu Xiaosang to achieve dao. At this time, he trapped Gu Xiaosang with the sword formation so that the Devil and Buddha would not have a chance to take advantage of him.</p><p>Whoosh, Whoosh, Whoosh. The sword lights swept across, killing all life and all things, bringing about an endless end. They enveloped the hollow jade temple and isolated the domineering purple at the beginning.</p><p>On the other side, he had extra strength. He held the heavenly punishment axe in his slender white hand, surrounded by nine clear dao patterns, and slashed toward Maitreya, who had just formed the illusory dao fruit and had yet to go back in time.</p><p>This was the difference between the ancient man in the embryonic form of the dao fruit and the other shores. It was not even comparable to the ancientness of going back to the past. Of course, there was the existence of the end of the era, as long as it did not go back to the beginning.., if the world could not be opened up, then destroying the previous era would not affect the current era!</p><p>The sound of the zither was faint, and the wheels of life and death rotated. Countless black and white light spots appeared, turning into layers and layers of puzzles, trapping the heaven’s punishment axe inside. It seemed illusory, but it made the giant bronze axe have nowhere to put its strength.</p><p>The emperor fu controlled by Amitabha was not surprised to make a move, blocking the gold emperor outside the Buddhist kingdom on the ground.</p><p>But this also gave the Supreme True Buddha an opportunity. In front of him, there was only the Buddhist kingdom on the ground and the Green Lotus treasure-colored flag. In just a few moments, it would be enough to destroy Maitreya and devour him!</p><p>The tathagata divine palm struck out and gathered into a vast light of creation. It wanted to drown the Buddhist kingdom on the ground, reset the situation in the real world, and turn Maitreya into a part of the true Buddha!</p><p>The Green Lotus treasure-colored flag unfurled, and the SARIRAS hung in the air. White Qi billowed like waves, and golden rays of light shot out in all directions. Under the pure and endless light, they were on the verge of collapsing. It seemed that they would not be able to hold on for long.</p><p>At this moment, the Green Emperor, the demon Buddha, the monster of the Heavenly Dao, and the celestial emperor behind the blade of time had yet to make a move.</p><p>Those who were close to the fruit of the dao were “The envy of the heavens”, and all living beings stopped them!</p><p>On the top of the Fusang ancient tree, the Miyan Palace of the Eastern Qinghua World was created. The Green Emperor stood with his hands hanging down, and his eyes reflected the situation of the people on the other side fighting.</p><p>Suddenly, a ruler with purple qi floating in it flew out of the Fusang ancient tree. It was extremely yang and righteous, invulnerable to all evil, and it dispelled all the haze in the world.</p><p>The primordial Yang ruler!</p><p>The Green Emperor finally made his move!</p><p>The Yuan Yang ruler flashed. The purple light was heavy and covered the sky. It struck down in a mighty manner. However, it did not hit Maitreya, who was half-formed from the illusory dao fruit. Instead, it hit the Supreme True Buddha!</p><p>PA!</p><p>The Supreme True Buddha was hit by the pure light that did not allow impurities. He staggered and his body spewed out brilliant flames.</p><p>Emperor Qing actually stood on Amitabha’s side and chose to help Maitreya!</p><p>“Taihao…”the low roar of the Devil Buddha echoed in the real world. The Sky and earth were dyed dark red, and chaotic whirlpools appeared one after another. A huge hand full of violence and madness reached out to grab the primordial Yang ruler.</p><p>Although it was a little unexpected, the situation was still under control!</p><p>It was also because of this that the bright and round moon did not show any ripples.</p><p>At this moment, through the perception of those on the other side, Green Emperor stepped out of the Fusang ancient tree realm and walked into the illusory river of time.</p><p>In the past, the azure-blue medicine Guru Buddha, the Primordial Heavenly Lord of salvation who wore a bamboo crown on his head, Chun Yangzi who was a disciple of morality, and the East Yang Divine Lord in front of the Sacred Emperor seat all followed him and surged their auras,</p><p>green Emperor pointed with his finger, and the medicine Guru Buddha imprints in the river of time flew out one after another, condensing into a azure-blue glazed Buddha that transcended time.</p><p>The pain on his face was obvious. The huge green tree with the illusory dao fruit appeared above the Green Emperor’s head. It shook violently, causing the medicine master king Buddha to fly toward the hollow jade temple at an infinite height. He formed a seal with his hands, he slapped toward the immortal-slaying sword formation.</p><p>As if they had a tacit understanding, a purple line that covered all the light in the various colors appeared out of thin air within the red, green, black, and white sword formation. It cut open the end and then opened up the world. The two combined forces finally shook the immortal-slaying sword formation, layers of restrictions were opened.</p><p>The purple light flew out, and the Tai Shang Wuji Yuan Shi Qing Cloud also flew out. However, it did not counterattack the Golden Emperor. Instead, it directly enveloped the “Medicine Master King Buddha”.</p><p>The green and blue were transparent, and the Buddha Light Rose. It was completely swallowed by the Wuji and assimilated by the Chaos!</p><p>At the same time, the ancient glazed lamp also flew out. It reflected the cause and effect rain that was covered with bright star lines. As the black and white swirled, it burned off the various connections between the Medicine Master King Buddha and the Green Emperor, leaving a blank in that period of history, it made Emperor Qing have the tendency to fall into the sea of suffering again.</p><p>However, the heavenly venerate Taiyi who had been silent in that period of history woke up one after another, connecting the front and back as one again, allowing Emperor Qing to stabilize his body!</p><p>“Li Dai Tao Jiang!”The Devil Buddha’s angry roar was like rolling dark thunder, and the bright and clear flawless moon also stirred up some ripples.</p><p>What was Li Dai Tao Jiang? It was Meng Qi who swallowed medicine master Wang Fo with the Wuji Seal and accepted all karma, including the restrictions of the great wish, in exchange for Emperor Qing’s release.</p><p>Although Emperor Qing would be weak for a short period of time, there would be no obstacles to his future advancement!</p><p>This was the price Emperor Qing had to pay!</p><p>This was Meng Qi’s true intention of giving out the “Golden millet pillow”and allowing the reincarnation of the water ancestor, Tan Ping, to return to the era of Sacred Emperor Qi. It was the purpose of fighting over the matter of Gu Xiaosang’s corpse!</p><p>Meng Qi sat in the Lotus position in the Jade Clear Palace. The prime minister, Shi Qing, flew back and burrowed into his Niwan Palace. Then, a gust of clear air flew out and transformed into various forms.</p><p>He looked directly at the Devil Buddha’s prying eyes and said with a smile,</p><p>“In any case, I don’t have many grudges.”</p><p>Before he finished speaking, he pointed with his finger and the stream of clear Qi split into three. Two of them were weak and the other was strong.</p><p>The strong person flew out and transformed into a monk with red lips and white teeth. He revealed a green-blue translucent Buddha body that was covered in precious light and suffused with the aura of the other shore!</p><p>After Meng Qi Swallowed Medicine Master Wang Fo, he combined his Qi to form the three pure ones and slashed out this weak ‘true rulai of the other shore’!</p><p>With this, he could finally contend against an embryonic form of dao fruit like the gold emperor!</p><p>However, the Boundless Dao of chaos encompassed everything. Similar incarnations could not be sustained for long. They could only be sustained for a period of time at a time and could not reach the Saint Buddha State of the former heavenly venerate of primordial beginning.</p><p>“In the world, only I am Supreme!”True Calm Tathagata pointed to the sky with one hand and touched the ground with the other. He directly asked the evil and depraved mind of the Devil Buddha. Following him was a purple saber light that could cut through all things. It was extremely domineering, it was unstoppable.</p><p>Meng Qi became stronger again, and the Devil Buddha naturally fell a little. At this point, he finally reversed the situation that had been shrouded by the shadow of the Devil Buddha for hundreds of years. He had a slight advantage, so he made the first move.</p><p>Faced with true rulai’s mind buckle question and the ultimate blade that could split the heaven and earth, the Devil Buddha’s eyes burned with black fire. He showed the devil body of the reverse Buddha and performed the nine forms of RULAI’s reverse palm at the same time, reenacting the scene of ten thousand Buddhas falling together to destroy the world, he also recalled the Heavenly Dao monster and used a chaotic and crazy vortex to meet the blade light, fighting against Su Meng together.</p><p>The chess piece from before, the Lamb of the past, had grown to a level that surpassed his own, and had become a real primordial Lord of Heaven!</p><p>This time, who was the chess piece and who was the Lamb?</p><p>The black palm slammed down, and demonic Qi filled the air. Purple Lightning flashed like a blade, and the soul transformed. The high ground of the hollow jade temple was filled with the battle between Meng Qi and the Devil Buddha, and there were no more external objects.</p><p>Without the entanglement of the Monsters of the Heavenly Dao, the weak green emperor once again held the primordial Yang ruler filled with purple qi and blocked the Supreme True Buddha. On the other side, Amitabha saw that the situation had taken a turn for the better, so he no longer cared about subduing the emperor, he allowed him to stop the gold emperor with a desperate attitude.</p><p>And a person on the other side who risked his life was as strong as the ancient gold emperor. Even if he controlled the immortal slaying sword formation, the heaven slaying axe, and the plain-colored cloud realm flag, he would not be able to break free from the obstruction for a short time.</p><p>At this time, Maitreya finally allowed the illusory dao fruit to be half-formed and started to go back in time to light up the future.</p><p>All of a sudden, he heard an angry roar and his entire body stiffened, as if he had fallen into an eternal ice cave with his mortal body.</p><p>The Supreme True Buddha’s body spewed out rays of extremely pure light, and his aura rose steadily. As he blocked Emperor Qing’s primordial Yang ruler, he spoke in a grand and solemn voice:</p><p>“The pure dharma body is unique. All the Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, and Arhats are formed from this dharma body. It is piluchana Buddha, and also my Supreme True Buddha!”</p><p>The heavens shook, and the Pure Land was shrouded in darkness. Even Amitabha and Bodhi ancient Buddha felt as if their own dharma bodies had been infected.</p><p>“He has merged with Chantan Merit and Virtue Buddha!”This kind of shocking knowledge appeared in the hearts of many well-informed Buddhas, and a strong sense of despair brewed in them.</p><p>Fu Huang was controlled by Amitabha, and the Buddha seal in his body was also suppressed. In an instant, he became dull, and he could only watch as the golden emperor’s white and slender hand held the heaven’s punishment axe and chopped at Maitreya’s head.</p><p>After hundreds of millions of years of cultivation, his wish to save the Apocalypse was about to turn into an illusion!</p><p>At this moment, Amitabha sighed.</p><p>In the past, Gu Xiaosang stood outside the door of the divine capital of Dajin. She quietly watched the will of Maitreya descend into the body of former crown prince Zhao Qian. Then, she heard Amitabha’s sigh.</p><p>She immediately stretched out her hand with a smile. The White Lotus that Xia Xiu had planted at the moment finally bloomed. It flew back into history and landed in Gu Xiaosang’s palm.</p><p>She smiled and pointed out her right hand. It was fair and slender, and it hit the forehead of the former crown prince, Zhao Qian, right in the middle of the ten thousand character talisman condensed from glass.</p><p>“No!”Zhao Qian let out a miserable cry. His body turned into light and flowed into Gu Xiaosang’s finger and into her body.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s expression became solemn. She pointed out with her finger, and with the White Lotus as a support, she cut out a pure and aloof God, which looked exactly like her.</p><p>The God sat down again, and the White Lotus bloomed around him, looking fresh and refreshing.</p><p>At the current node, Maitreya, who was under the heaven’s punishment axe, suddenly became illusory and transformed into Gu Xiaosang’s appearance. However, it was more solemn and holy, and it also had the taste of a vacuum home!</p><p>The Lutheran believers rescued by Daoist cihang all sensed the subtle changes in the Buddhist kingdom on Earth. It seemed that the future Buddha was really transformed by the old mother!</p><p>The little bit of will power immediately gathered, making the Buddhist kingdom on Earth radiate a sense of home.</p><p>The Heavenly Punishment Axe was frozen in the air, unable to cut down. Gu Xiaosang looked at the bright moon hanging high in the sky with a faint smile. She stroked her long hair and said,</p><p>“Thank you for your mercy, Old Mother.”</p><p>At this point, how could the gold emperor cut down this axe? It was to cut off the hope of transcending his own era!</p><p>The bright moon rippled and returned to calmness after looking back. For the gold emperor, such a change was beneficial and there was no need to stop it.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang covered her mouth with her hand and yawned. She put away the relic on her head and said with a faint smile,</p><p>“I haven’t accumulated enough. Next time I attack the other shore, I’ll take my leave first.”</p><p>After saying that, she did not turn her head back. She let the heavenly punishing axe hang high behind her and slowly walked into the white lotus throne.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
