Maitreya’s eyes flickered, and a glass lamp suddenly appeared in his eyes. The color of the lamp could not be described with normal cognition, and it was filled with the oldest and most ancient feeling, it was the source of all the entanglements in the world, such as birth, old age, illness, death, love, hatred, separation, and unrequited love. It was the beginning of all things.</p><p>“The cause of all fruits…”this name unconsciously appeared in Maitreya’s mind. He saw the perfect and flawless ancient lamp that shone across the universe slowly rise and fall behind the head of the primordial beginning Celestial Master, Meng Qi, and at the top of the clear light green tree, it made the clear and round light more profound and mysterious, and people could not help but worship it.</p><p>He was intoxicated by it for a long time before he came back to his senses. He put his palms together and said,</p><p>“Congratulations on completing the third seal of the heavenly venerate.”</p><p>The bright and clear round light did not cause any ripples, but Maitreya seemed to have felt Meng Qi’s gaze. He heard an indifferent and lofty voice, “Thank you for your trouble, fellow Daoist.”</p><p>Maitreya heaved a sigh of relief. Just as he was about to leave, he heard Meng Qi, the heavenly venerate of the origin, continue, “I heard that you once made a great wish, saying, ‘do not save all sentient beings, do not save the Apocalypse, do not seek the future’?”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Maitreya was instantly bewildered. He did not understand why the high and mighty figure across from him would suddenly mention this matter. According to Amitabha’s instructions, this trip had brought the karma relic that was cut out by the burning lamp, helping primordial beginning Celestial Master Meng Qi to complete the karma of all his karma and end the enmity between him and the Dao was considered to have achieved his goal. He could take his leave now. As for helping himself to reach the other shore, it was still too early to talk about it. It was still too early for the situation to develop, he needed to wait for the opportunity to arrive, but it was not enough to say anything deep!</p><p>Who knew that the heavenly venerate of the origin aiding sect, Meng Qi, would take the initiative to talk about this matter..</p><p>No matter how many thoughts ran through his mind, Maitreya still maintained a pleasant smile and replied respectfully, “Just as the heavenly venerate said.”</p><p>Dao Yi’s glass lamp took shape, and the billions of golden lamps around Meng Qi became increasingly clear. He said calmly,</p><p>“All living beings have yet to cross over, but the homeland still exists, and the great wish is still there. Fellow Daoist, you don’t have to be too anxious. You must know that the path to the other shore is inside and not outside.”</p><p>Maitreya was shocked. He actually felt as if he had been given a severe warning. For more than a hundred years, he had been anxious to reach the other shore. He had somewhat forgotten that the original purpose of establishing the Buddha Kingdom on Earth was to cross over the Sea of suffering for all living beings, he had not sought the other shore to cross the sea of suffering of all living beings.</p><p>His great wish was “Not to seek the future”, not “Not to reach the other shore”. It was not enough to hinder his efforts to break free from the Sea of suffering. However, if even his state of mind had quietly changed, unlike “I”, he would most likely die when he made the breakthrough.</p><p>He still had to establish a solid foundation, not forget his original intention, and wait for an opportunity!</p><p>“Thank you, Celestial Venerable, for your guidance.”Maitreya bowed solemnly.</p><p>Did the primordial Lord of Heaven, Meng Qi, take the initiative to offer guidance because he wanted to help him ascend to the other side?</p><p>Did he want to tie this matter to Gu Xiaosang’s attainment of the Dao?</p><p>Deep in his thoughts, there was nothing else to say in the Jade Clarity Palace. Maitreya understood that he had said all that he could say today, so he took his leave obediently.</p><p>As he watched Maitreya leave, Meng Qi’s eyes seemed to be hiding another universe. He released his left hand, and the yellow flag of Wuji Apricot fell into the lower realm. It fell into the nine netherworld, piercing through layers of barriers and carrying billions of golden lotuses, it flew into the hands of ‘True Lord Pure Source Mystic Dao’Yang Jian.</p><p>Yang Jian looked at the hollow jade treasure and smiled. He maintained his blood demon appearance and did not step out of the netherworld.</p><p>At the same time, Meng Qi grabbed with his right hand. The river of time, which had disappeared without a trace, appeared illusory and illusory. The universal sign-up ball in the hollow jade temple of Mount Kunlun flew out of history and landed in his palm, he used it to avoid the attack of the Golden Emperor.</p><p>The shimmering ball of light slowly rose up and connected with the universal symbol talismans again, shortening the distance brought by the passage of time.</p><p>..</p><p>In a certain cave abode, a white-haired old man was sitting on a cloud bed and lecturing his disciples and grand-disciples about the essence of the “Spark great art”.</p><p>Suddenly, a strange light flashed in his arms, as if something had regained its vitality.</p><p>The old man was stunned at first, but then he reached into his arms and took out an object. With his martial grandmaster realm and strength, his palm was trembling slightly. It was hard to control, which showed the excitement in his heart.</p><p>His disciples and grand-disciples looked at each other, not understanding what had happened. They saw a piece of silver-white metal sheet in the palm of the sect leader, on which were engraved mysterious and indescribable patterns.</p><p>Could the myriad realm general knowledge talisman be used again? The myriad realm general knowledge talisman could be used again! The old man took a deep breath and activated the metal sheet. He immersed his spiritual sense into it, and the haunting scenes appeared one after another in front of his eyes.</p><p>Jianghu Teahouse, Martial Arts Relay Station, Myriad Realm Shopping Mall, live broadcast website, martial arts teaching, discussion group, and so on were all quietly prominent. Even after 168 years, they were still so familiar with each other!</p><p>The old man opened the group and saw messages popping up one after another. The other party’s profile picture was of a pretty and cute girl:</p><p>“Is it possible that you can’t connect to the myriad world general knowledge ball?”</p><p>“What about our appointment to meet after the New Year?”</p><p>“Why don’t I come to Pingjin to look for you?”</p><p>“When I arrived in Pingjin, I heard that your family moved to the overseas immortal realm…”</p><p>“When I went to the overseas immortal realm, I couldn’t find any news about you…”</p><p>Some of these messages were sent a few days ago, and some were sent a few years ago. However, the old man only received them today.</p><p>When he saw these messages, the old man’s vision immediately blurred, and tears gathered at the corners of his eyes. His hands trembled even more violently.</p><p>168 years ago, he had found a lover whom he planned to be with for the rest of his life. Who knew that the universal sign would suddenly lose its effect, and the two sides could no longer contact each other. Meanwhile, his family was terrified of the coming rule of Luoism, he chose to move to the overseas immortal world, leaving behind a letter. When he arrived on the island today, he also tried to contact the other party according to the address they left behind. Unfortunately, the letter sank into the sea, and there was no response. Since then, the message was cut off, and heaven and man were separated.</p><p>Thinking of how that thin and weak figure had gone to the east of the Jiang River more than a hundred years ago and had been unable to find him, the old man felt sorry for him. He could not care less about losing his composure in front of his disciples and grand-disciples, so he hurriedly sent a message:</p><p>“Yingzhi, where are you now?”</p><p>This was a reply that had been delayed for more than a hundred and sixty years.</p><p>At this moment, the other party’s head suddenly lit up, causing the old man’s heart to race. There was too much anticipation.</p><p>A message was sent:</p><p>“Is it Grandpa Cui? I’m Grandmaster Lin Yingzhi’s grand-disciple. When she passed away in meditation ten years ago, she passed this item to me. She asked me to wait for the day when the myriad realm general knowledge talisman can be used. I’ll reply to you with a message.”</p><p>Passed away in meditation… The Old Man’s heart slowly sank, and he felt that the world had become dark. “What message?”</p><p>The other party immediately replied:</p><p>“She was never married in her life.”</p><p>With a swipe, the old man’s tears flowed freely, and he could not help but feel sorrowful.</p><p>He was ten years late, no, one hundred and sixty-eight years late!</p><p>..</p><p>In all corners of the world, the old people who had survived until now all entered the universal symbol again. When they saw the arguments in the forums, they suddenly stopped at one hundred and sixty-eight years, the “Enemies”who had quarreled with them at that time, the group of people who posted daily, had all passed away. In some small forums, only one of them was still alive. They were all alone here reminiscing about the past.</p><p>This place buried their youth, their most spirited age. Now that 168 years had passed, who could say that they were filled with emotions?</p><p>Time was merciless, and time was like a ravine.</p><p>In a group, the news was kept very well, and the only remaining old man had tears in his eyes. He looked at the discussions of the past and kept muttering to himself,</p><p>“Little Six, aren’t you going to participate in the martial arts competition in virtual reality and strive to enter the man roll?”</p><p>“Ku’er, aren’t you always saying that you want to organize the virtual martial arts ranking competition?”</p><p>..</p><p>“Why did all of you leave and leave me alone?”</p><p>At this moment, a profile picture lit up and sent a message:</p><p>“Is there anyone else?”</p><p>The old man’s eyes widened and he hurriedly recovered. “Little Six, are you still alive?”</p><p>“No, I’m long dead.”The other party sent a smiley emoji. “Now that I’m in Master Xuan Bei’s Pure Land Buddhist kingdom, I can finally use the myriad realm General Knowledge Talisman Again!”</p><p>‘this works…’The old man was pleasantly surprised.</p><p>..</p><p>The Pure Land Buddhist kingdom, which was covered with resurrection Lily Flowers, was filled with a sense of peace and tranquility, slowly dissipating the obsession and resentment.</p><p>Sitting cross-legged on the Golden Lotus Throne, Xuan bei read the Ksitigarbha Soul Sutra to the ghosts around him. When he glanced around, he saw a few of them secretly playing with the universal symbol.</p><p>He smiled and pretended not to notice as he continued to recite.</p><p>Suddenly, an immeasurable amount of glazed golden light descended from the sky. A vast pure land that far surpassed Xuan Bei’s current Buddhist kingdom slowly flew over. It was filled with deathly stillness and was mostly damaged.</p><p>“Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva’s remaining Pure Land…”Xuan Bei’s heart stirred.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
