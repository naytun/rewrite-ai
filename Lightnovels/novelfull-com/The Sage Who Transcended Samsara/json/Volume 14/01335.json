Just as he was about to approach the edge of the netherworld, he suddenly felt a chill run down his spine. The image of the Jade Lake Rippling with golden water immediately appeared in his mind, as well as the lofty and indifferent gaze that hung down from the pavilion.</p><p>The mother of no life!</p><p>The mother of the Jade Lake!</p><p>It was truly haunting. Even though he had returned from the current node to the mythological era, he had always been watching his every move without the slightest bit of slack! Meng Qi raised his head slightly. His eyes were as deep as the sea, hiding countless invisible whirlpools, like one chaos point after another.</p><p>Their eyes met, and their gazes collided. The dim nine underworld suddenly turned pitch-black. The edge of the sky caved in and collapsed, turning into a terrifying chaotic hole that devoured everything around it, dispersing the fog of time.</p><p>The two touched and retracted. Meng Qi once again flew out of the sparkling fruit that was shimmering with light. The illusory and incomplete river that surrounded him became more and more complete upstream. It stirred up space and time, forming a tunnel that made him disappear from where he was.</p><p>Demon saint and Daoist Tiansha were only left with the mark of history and no real spirituality. Seeing Meng Qi leave, they ignored him and began their fierce battle again.</p><p>..</p><p>Lin Suhe carried the green jade box and came to the nearest island where the teleportation array was set up. This island was connected to middle-earth and connected to things. It was also a famous place where goods were distributed and transported in the era of the myriad realm mall, now, it had developed into one of the few prosperous markets in the world where all kinds of goods were traded. There were no lack of rare treasures.</p><p>However, Lin Suhe did not have the time to wander around this place. He pressed down the escape light and landed outside the teleportation hall. After a relatively simple process, he stepped into the array that led to the outside of the Fusang ancient tree.</p><p>The light around him rose and protected his body and mind. He only felt a little dizzy and was not crushed into ashes by the vibration that tore through the void. His eyes were dark and deep, as if he was retreating rapidly, but also as if he had never moved.</p><p>“Phew, I am finally safe.”Lin Suhe touched the green jade box in his arms and let out a long breath. He only needed one or two breaths to reach his destination!</p><p>In his opinion, if he did not encounter any obstacles before the teleportation formation was activated, then everything would be fine. When he arrived at the island outside the Fusang Ancient Tree Realm and was close to the Green Emperor Daoist sect, who would dare to stop him and Rob Him?</p><p>And up until now, the Green Jade Box had not undergone any changes, which completely dispelled the worries in his heart.</p><p>Right at this moment, a ray of light suddenly lit up in the pure darkness before his eyes. It swayed gently and illuminated the void.</p><p>It was a warm and peaceful flame, just like a lamp lit by his mother at night, illuminating the way home for every wanderer. Lin Suhe only felt that the direction of his teleportation had quietly changed, he headed straight for the crystal-clear glass lamp!</p><p>It was the first peace!</p><p>It was the final destination, the desire to go home in everyone’s heart!</p><p>The void shrank, and the flame was like a bean. It was already in front of him. Lin Suhe knew that it was bad, but with his realm, he had no way and no ability to respond.</p><p>“Is it the wanderer lamp of the legendary Luoluo sect?”Lin Suhe’s pupils shrank to the tip of a needle, and a storm rose in his heart.</p><p>What had he gotten himself into that he was “Lucky”to experience the summoning of the traveling lantern?</p><p>In the midst of his confusion, an object suddenly fell from the void above his head. It was bright and white, seemingly slow but actually fast, and it directly smashed toward the traveling lantern.</p><p>The white light left a trace in Lin Suhe’s pupils, and one could vaguely see that it was a circle with a gap. The patterns on it were completely hidden, and it returned to its original state. It exuded an ancient aura, and it possessed both the immortal intent of Taoism and the Zen realm of Buddhism.</p><p>As the circle approached, the wandering child lamp immediately shone brightly, completely illuminating the Void and darkness. It illuminated all directions in the three realms, the heavens, and the universe, doing its best to resist the approach of the bright and white light.</p><p>However, with a piercing sound, the circle restrained all the light within the chakra, and like a round light pressing down, it placed the wandering child lamp in the center.</p><p>The lamp flickered and rippled, but it could not rush out no matter how hard it tried. It could no longer affect the surrounding darkness, and everything Lin Suhe saw before his eyes returned to nothingness.</p><p>“What kind of treasure is this? It can actually trick the wandering child lamp of the Luo Sect?”His heart was beating like a drum. He had finally experienced what it felt like to be an expert.</p><p>At this moment, a bright moon slowly rose up in front of him. The clear light scattered down, white and sparkling, leading Lin Suhe’s teleportation in the right direction again.</p><p>In the middle of the Bright Moon, a bodhisattva as beautiful as the moonlight sat in the lotus position. His figures were numerous, each holding a state. He appeared to be a different kind of winner, making people involuntarily become calm and happy.</p><p>“Moonlight Bodhisattva!”As a cultivator of the 28 worlds of the Seven Seas, how could Lin Suhe not recognize this great bodhisattva of the Pure Land of Dongfang glaze? His heart was filled with joy and surprise, and he could not believe his eyes, as if he had fallen into a dream.</p><p>This was a great abhijna who had cultivated to the creation realm!</p><p>The world of Dongfang glaze was omnipresent, while the realm of Fusang ancient tree manifested at the end of the East Sea. Therefore, the veneration and worship of the Green Emperor, the heavenly venerate of primordial salvation, and the Medicine Guru Buddha belonged to the great trend of the overseas immortal world, the mount of the heavenly venerate Taiyi for salvation, nine spirits original Saint, and the bodhisattva moonlight, the threatening servant of the Medicine Master King Buddha, were also common offerings. Temples could be seen on many market islands. Although there was definitely a difference between the deity statue and the original body, it was difficult for mortals to draw the appearance of the deities and Buddhas, but the general image would not be wrong!</p><p>The sound of Buddhist bugles rang in his ears, and the darkness in front of him was like a retreat. Lin Suhe was relieved once again. With the guidance of the Bodhisattva Moonlight, the matter was almost complete.</p><p>It was an exciting experience that he had never imagined!</p><p>Suddenly, he heard the sound of the wind. In the darkness of the moonlight and the silence of the Buddha’s call, he heard the sound of the wind!</p><p>The sound of the wind was so loud that the sky and earth were spinning. Lin Suhe felt that his body was rapidly shrinking, and the universe seemed to have changed.</p><p>The Moonlight Bodhisattva and the Light Buddha’s call had all disappeared!</p><p>“Roar!”</p><p>At this moment, he heard a deafening roar, as if there were nine layers of resonance. Another gust of wind swept over from behind him, dragging him out of the restraint, and threw him toward the clear splendor Moon that had reappeared in front of him, he threw him toward the moonlight bodhisattva.</p><p>Looking back in astonishment, Lin Suhe only saw two blurry figures standing at the ends of the darkness. One had a ghastly aura, a crown, and a robe. The sleeves were raised, and it seemed to cover almost everything. The other was as huge as a galaxy, and it looked like a lion, it had nine heads, and they were opening their huge mouths, swallowing and spitting the universe. Each of them occupied half of the void, and there was a torrent that reverberated at the point of collision.</p><p>“Nine-spirit primordial Saint!”Lin Suhe’s hairs stood on end. It was unknown whether he was excited or shocked.</p><p>The other was the great divine ability of the Luo sect that shook the world: Sleeve Universe?</p><p>As his figure landed, he came to a pure land. When he saw the Moonlight Bodhisattva, his heart calmed down slightly. He stretched out his hand and prepared to offer the Green Jade Box.</p><p>His right hand reached into his chest, but it was empty. The green jade box had disappeared without a trace!</p><p>Lin Suhe was indescribably terrified. A memory suddenly appeared in his mind. It was when he had entered the teleportation hall and paid the corresponding fees. At that time, he had met a handsome monk wearing an ancient monk robe. His skin was pale gold, there was an enviable word “Buddha”between his brows. He smiled at himself. Immediately, a myriad of principles and understandings entered his mind, making him seem to instantly understand many of the principles of martial arts, when he stepped into the teleportation array and touched the jade box in his arms, it was already gone!</p><p>Was it that handsome and carefree monk who took away the Green Jade Box?</p><p>In the bustling market, the half-opened eyes of the world’s carefree king and Buddha retracted his hand from the sparkling and illusionary river upstream. A green jade box appeared out of thin air in his arms.</p><p>There was a smile at the corner of his mouth. He opened the jade box without hesitation, wanting to see what it was.</p><p>The lid of the green jade opened, revealing the thing inside. It was a mass of dark red flesh that was slowly squirming!</p><p>Each drop of blood seemed to have its own spirituality!</p><p>As soon as the lid opened, the flesh pounced out and grew longer with the wind, enveloping the head of the world’s unfettered King Buddha!</p><p>“Su Meng!”</p><p>The world’s unfettered King Buddha let out a painful groan.</p><p>..</p><p>After passing through a long period of time and leaving his figure behind in every period of time in the Netherworld, Meng Qi finally felt his limits. Therefore, he stepped out of the time tunnel that was filled with mysterious patterns.</p><p>The surroundings were filled with turbid fog and surging demonic intent. The Netherworld had just taken shape, and in the darkness, the nine Chaos Celestial Venerable, Black Heaven Monarch, Xuanming ghost monarch, and Yang Jian’s wills were like balls of flames that lit up the surroundings.</p><p>They had also gone back to the beginning of the nine Netherworld, when it was born!</p><p>Meng Qi did not speak. Instead, he raised his head and looked beyond the nine netherworld. Clear air floated up, and he could vaguely see the immortal world. In the center, Earth, fire, water, and wind raged wildly.</p><p>In the Earth, fire, wind, and water, there was a chaotic Qing cloud. Rays of dim light hung down, carrying golden lotuses, Golden Lanterns, jade chains, and other things.</p><p>Primordial Lord of Heaven!</p><p>This was the first time that Meng Qi had seen him, even if it was just a brand.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
