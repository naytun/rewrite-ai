He appeared directly in a region of the vast Eastern Sea, where the Golden Ao Island used to be.</p><p>“How can you be sure that the flesh and blood suppressed by the Qingping sword belongs to that archaic emperor?”Gu Xiaosang’s voice rang in his mind through spiritual sense. “I haven’t even heard of it.”</p><p>Obviously, she knew that the Qingping sword was hidden on the Golden Ao Island. She knew that the Qingping sword was suppressing the mysterious and strange flesh and blood. She was not even surprised that the vitality of the flesh and blood had not been eliminated. However, she did not know who the flesh and blood belonged to, it was not until Meng Qi mentioned it and mentioned that it was related to the demonic blood peach that she realized that it was Emperor Taiyi.</p><p>It seemed that Xiaosang had long known that the demonic blood peach was formed from the growth of a part of the dao fruit of Emperor Taiyi. No wonder it was hidden in the acupuncture point on his left hand… Meng Qi thought to himself and replied with a smile, “I guessed.”</p><p>“Guessed?”Gu Xiao sang immediately burst out laughing. “Hubby really has a flair for thinking. It’s hard to fathom.”</p><p>Meng Qi’s answer just now was to increase the interaction. Seeing that the effect was not bad.., he originally explained, “At the highest level of the immortal world, after confirming that the primordial emperor did not really die and that it was related to the monster that the eternal shadow of the Wang family in Jiangdong had sent, I guessed that the so-called primordial evil creature, Little Peach, was probably also a part of that emperor. I used this to associate it with the mysterious flesh and blood suppressed by the Qingping Sword on Jinao Island. There is a subtle and mysterious similarity between the two, so I boldly made a hypothesis and came to verify it.”</p><p>Not only could this prove the “Identity”of the lump of flesh, but it could also be used to determine whether the demonic blood peach was actually a part of the dao fruit from the East Emperor Taiyi.</p><p>“A part of the flesh of an archaic emperor has yet to completely extinguish its vitality. This is something that even those with perfect destiny would avoid like snakes and scorpions. My husband, please don’t underestimate them and make me a widow,”Gu Xiaosang reminded him in a relaxed and lively tone.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly. His expression was as usual, but his heart was solemn:</p><p>“How would I dare to underestimate the things left behind by those on the other side?”</p><p>How could something that could allow him to improve as quickly as possible and to a certain extent, resist the will of heaven be simple? How could it not be risky?</p><p>If it wasn’t for the activation of the verdant emperor’s words of wisdom and the determination he made in the celestial prison, he would definitely have been more prudent and not take the risk to try!</p><p>With so many calamities, he could only seek death!</p><p>However, he wasn’t completely confident in this trip. The remaining flesh and blood of Donghuang Taiyi was suppressed by the Qingping Sword, making it difficult for him to unleash any sort of power. Furthermore, his overlord Blade was the essence of the paramita-grade divine weapon, it wouldn’t be easy for that lump of primordial flesh and blood to touch it. More importantly, it could drive away tigers and devour wolves. Not only would it completely destroy the Devil Buddha imprint, but it would also cause Donghuang’s flesh and blood to lose most of its abilities, reducing it to a level where it could be controlled.</p><p>If he hadn’t fallen, the remaining flesh on the other shore would have been more terrifying than he had imagined. He still had the demonic blood peach as a backup, and it was countered by the tree of Great Dao.</p><p>Of course, even if he had all sorts of methods, the danger level was still very high.</p><p>Without saying anything more, Meng Qi stepped on the waves with his feet. Golden lotuses surrounded him, and the space between his brows split open, and a dao one glass lamp that seemed to have solidified flew out.</p><p>The green lamp was like a bean, shining brightly. Black and white swirled around it, layer upon layer. Then, it seeped into the void and disappeared.</p><p>At the same time, Meng Qi flicked his finger and shot out a bright and dazzling sword ray.</p><p>The Sword Ray split into two and four. Some were scarlet, some were pure green, some were dark black, and some were blazing white. Each of them had their own unique techniques. As they descended, they formed the immortal vanquishing sword formation.</p><p>At Meng Qi’s level, forming a formation with a single sword was a piece of cake. He could even use his ‘He I projection’to form the immortal vanquishing sword formation!</p><p>In just a short moment, sword qi rose up, whistling unceasingly. All sorts of colors swept through, and the formation was dim and dark. Everything was void, as if it was the end of the world.</p><p>Seizing this opportunity, Meng Qi activated his ‘karma of all fruits’. The light flickered, and it was like a new sun on the sea, trying to shine out any secret location that resonated with the immortal vanquishing sword formation.</p><p>A few faint connections appeared, but they disappeared in the blink of an eye. Like a candle in the wind, it was extinguished when it encountered the fluctuations. Like the ebb and flow of the tide, mysterious and powerful forces surged again, completely covering up the movements, there was no time to grasp the “Gap”.</p><p>“It’s really well-hidden,”Meng Qi praised. There was not a trace of dejection on his face. He quietly connected with the demonic blood peach and absorbed the strange and evil feeling on its body.</p><p>Then, he used it as “Oil”and threw it into a glass lamp.</p><p>Suddenly, the flame of the lamp grew without wind, and the surroundings became dark. It was as if he had returned to the earliest time, when the causal connection was born.</p><p>With the help of this aura, Meng Qi suddenly grasped a causal connection, and a corresponding scene appeared in his mind:</p><p>It was an ancient long sword inserted in the void with the word “Qingping”on it. A mass of dark black flesh was wriggling crazily under the sword, and there were inexplicable howls coming from it. It gave off a terrifying and barbaric feeling, as if it was going to take back the demonic blood peach at all costs, the little peach was so scared that it dropped down and fell into Gu Xiaosang’s acupuncture point. It hid behind her and peeked out half of its face timidly.</p><p>“It really is the remains of the flesh of Donghuang Taiyi. It really is a part of his dao fruit…”Meng Qi was completely sure. Just as he was about to grab hold of the connection and lock onto the location of Jin Ao Island, he descended directly, and the surrounding scene suddenly changed, an ancient and vast immortal world appeared before his eyes.</p><p>The immortal world was layered and densely packed. It was like a huge cloud that surrounded the figure at the top.</p><p>It was a towering figure in a black robe and an ancient costume. It was lofty and ethereal. It actually looked somewhat like the remnant of the Celestial Emperor in the Big Dipper Imperial carriage. However, it was even more vast, majestic, and ancient!</p><p>His face was blurry. There was an ancient bronze bell hanging above his head. As it rippled, the bell lightly rang. Time Rose and fell, and time flowed backward.</p><p>This terrifying scene and terrifying power seemed to freeze the spiritual light of Meng Qi’s nature. It was as if he was facing the existence at the top of the food chain. Fear and panic came from the bottom of his heart, and he could not muster the slightest will to fight back.</p><p>Suddenly, a pair of eyes bearing the prosperity and destruction of countless civilizations and the beginning and destruction of many eras appeared on the blurry face of the ancient emperor, wanting to absorb Meng Qi’s mind completely.</p><p>At this moment, a figure appeared in front of the ancient emperor. He was wearing a Daoist robe that could not be described by color. Countless eras were born and died under his feet. The Broken River of time surrounded him like a true dragon, and his body was dark and chaotic, it was like a dot of clouds, and above his head hung something that looked like an axe or a banner. The most ancient and most primitive intent was rippling heavily.</p><p>It was actually a celestial venerable, an extremely ancient celestial venerable!</p><p>This ancient celestial venerable looked down at the Emperor and said in a deep voice,</p><p>“Stop playing tricks and quickly retreat.”</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Illusory thunderclaps erupted, and the ancient bronze bell collapsed. The archaic emperor vanished, and the immortal world turned into bubbles. Everything returned to its original state.</p><p>The collision just now was the aura of the remnant flesh and blood of East Emperor Taiyi, which had been extended in reverse through the connection of karma. It had created an illusion, crushed Meng Qi’s soul, and turned him into a walking corpse, carrying the will of the ancient man, however, Meng Qi possessed the origin heart seal and was adept at being the sole sovereign. On one hand, he used the Wuji Guardian as his true body, and on the other hand, he used the illusion against the illusion. The nine seals appeared at the origin!</p><p>“If it wasn’t for the Qingping sword suppressing it, it definitely wouldn’t end here. The power of an archaic emperor is simply beyond imagination…”as Meng Qi’s thoughts spun, he had already grasped the connection that was about to disappear and sensed the golden ao island.</p><p>It had actually been moved out of the long river of time and hidden in the depths of the space-time turbulence that was filled with fog. It was abnormally close to true chaos and was quite difficult to find.</p><p>With a flash, the supreme limitless origin Shi Qing cloud above Meng Qi’s head passed through layers of fog and many turbulence and arrived near the Golden Ao Island.</p><p>At this moment, a loud shout sounded:</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>A white furry fist suddenly appeared, collapsing the void and tearing apart everything. It turned everything into darkness and even brought about changes in the surrounding space-time turbulence.</p><p>The Meishan Grand Sage, Yuan Hong, who was adjusting his breathing and cultivating, sensed the intruder.</p><p>The fist grew bigger and bigger, almost taking up the entire space. However, another fist that shone with faint gold suddenly landed in the outer realm. It was the same size, collapsed the void, and tore apart everything. It was very similar.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The storm swept and the turbulence “Roared”. Layers upon layers of forbidden spells appeared on the Golden Turtle Island, cancelling out the aftershocks.</p><p>The two fists collapsed and turned into ashes. Then, flesh and blood squirmed and grew new ones!</p><p>Meng Qi stood proudly in the fog and laughed:</p><p>“How has the Meishan Grand Sage Been?”</p><p>At this point in time, even if he was above the eight-nine arcane art, he could still compete with the ancient Grand Sage Yuan Hong.</p><p>Yuan Hong’s face was gloomy. He did not expect that the ant that he did not even look at back then had grown to such a stage. Moreover, there was no lack of shameless fellows from the hollow jade temple behind him. It seemed like he would have to ask Lu Ya to make a decision.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
