At a glance, the void seemed to be filled with many brahma flowers, but they were all withered, and the golden color was dim. One could vaguely see the glory of the past.</p><p>Although Xuan Bei had obtained the Golden Body of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva and now had the status of “Great Bodhisattva,”in terms of realm, he was still fundamentally different from the real ksitigarbha bodhisattva. He could not be compared to the real Ksitigarbha, when he saw the fall of this Buddhist kingdom, he could not help but feel a ripple in his heart.</p><p>— because the Netherworld was assimilated by his hometown, and Luo Feng’s black prison could not be entered, he had been trapped in the legendary pass for a hundred years. In the past, Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva was one of the top four bodhisattvas in Buddhism, he was only slightly inferior to Maitreya, who had the name of the future Buddha. The two of them were separated by two great realms, the legendary realm and the destiny realm.</p><p>As he thought about it, he held the reverence towards Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva. Xuan bei showed a golden body of Buddhism that was mixed with pity and a little melancholy. Stepping on the Golden Lotus, he ascended step by step and stepped into the Dead Pure Land.</p><p>It was said that Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva had disappeared after the Battle of Lingshan. Some said that he had fallen in the Ten Thousand Buddha Array, and some said that he had escaped and was hiding from the world. Xuan bei did not expect to meet his Pure Land of Buddhism today… Xuan bei thought about all kinds of rumors, walking on the barren land where there was no sign of life, the Buddhist temples, lotus flowers, crystals, Brahmas, Bodhi trees, and virtue pools of the past were either weathered or desolate.</p><p>In the center of this Pure Land, there was no commonly seen Mount Meru. There was only a twelfth-grade golden lotus platform. Its petals were grand and flowing with a faint light, as if it was made of glass. On top of it sat a bodhisattva who looked solemn and compassionate, each of his hands held a lotus flower and a pearl. Around him rose different Buddhists’appearances, corresponding to the transcending of all worlds and the six paths of reincarnation. They were collectively known as the ten kings of Ksitigarbha.</p><p>Unfortunately, this Bodhisattva’s vitality had been cut off for a long time. Traces of death intent and filthy black gas remained on the surface of his body. He was full of depravity.</p><p>Seeing such a situation, how could Xuan Bei, who had learned a lot about the matters of Mount Ling from Meng Qi, not guess the truth of the matter? Ksitigarbha had indeed fallen in the Devil Buddha Ah Nan’s reversal formation back then, however, because he had always been in charge of the eighteen levels of hell and the six paths of reincarnation on behalf of Buddhism, he had a deep accumulation and harvest in this aspect. Therefore, after the battle on the other side, the golden remains had been taken away by some important figure, he was sent back to the Pure Land that he had opened up in the void.</p><p>Xuan bei clasped his hands together and bowed:</p><p>“Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, I have received your inheritance and will carry on your legacy. I can not wish for this and will not see Tathagata.”</p><p>His voice was low and deep, but it reverberated in the air. At Xuan Bei’s current level, such a wish could no longer be considered hollow. He could touch the Great Dao and enjoy the rewards. Specks of golden light dripped down like rain, it made him feel as if he had connected with Ksitigarbha’s wish left behind in the myriad realms in an instant. He saw the painful struggles of all living beings in hell.</p><p>At the same time, Ksitigarbha’s golden body shed two streams of blood-stained tears. The hands holding the lotus flower and the pearl formed a strange mark. A black light was revealed. The will to die was deep, and there was vigorous vitality hidden within, it brought out a little bit of pure white, which seemed to be indistinct.</p><p>The origin of life and death?</p><p>Xuan Bei’s heart moved. He sat in the lotus position and circulated the will of life and death of the demon-subduing Mahakasyapa fist. He sensed a point that was full of mysteries.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the “Point”suddenly shook. A pitch-black and white light flew out and landed in Xuan Bei’s palm.</p><p>It was a treasure wheel that was filled with a faint blood-yellow fog. There was white in the black and life in the death. It seemed to reveal the great secrets of the heavens, the profound meaning of life and death. At a glance, it was.., cold, cold, silence, pain, death, exuberance, warmth, and other intuitions pounced on him.</p><p>Xuan bei held the wheel of life and death in his hand and watched Ksitigarbha’s golden body rise into a clear glass fire. It burned away the will of death and demonic qi and disintegrated the molt.</p><p>The fire soared into the sky and fluctuated. In the end, it left behind a clear glass-like relic that hid life and death. It reflected black and white and reflected many phantoms. It was an ancient scripture:</p><p>“Buddha said Ksitigarbha’s bodhisattva sutra”, “Ksitigarbha’s Bodhisattva’s wish Merit Sutra”..</p><p>Xuan Bei’s thoughts were all over the place, but he could not figure out what had happened. which person from the other shore had fallen behind the scenes, Amitabha, or Bodhisattva?</p><p>He waved his hand, and the relic left behind by Ksitigarbha flew up and fell into his palm. Just as he touched it, the entire pure land suddenly became generous and bright, and it was covered in a layer of light gold.</p><p>The Buddhist temple washed away the dust, and the pool of merit once again surged with clean water. The Bodhi tree once again sprouted branches and leaves, and the Brahma flowers blossomed brilliantly. Everything was once again filled with vitality.</p><p>The Pure Land Drooped Down and fused with Xuan Bei’s original Buddhist kingdom. In just a few breaths, it had become one, making it boundless and able to accommodate endless vengeful spirits and ghosts.</p><p>Xuan bei returned to the center of the Pure Land, holding the Ksitigarbha relic and the wheel of life and death in his hands, and sank into his comprehension.</p><p>No matter what scheme was behind this matter, at least it was in accordance with his own wishes!</p><p>This was his only wish in this life!</p><p>..</p><p>Inside the hollow jade temple, Meng Qi kept the bright and clear round light. However, his surroundings seemed to be enveloped by darkness. Even the illusory river of time flowing through this place was no exception. Some variables were curling up by the infinite chaos, some futures were hidden!</p><p>This was the way of concealing the Secrets of heaven and the future that belonged exclusively to the infinite seal.</p><p>It was because of this that the metal emperor hid all kinds of possibilities related to his own rebellion, and only at the last moment did he open up many new futures!</p><p>As for the other shores, of course, they also had their own methods.</p><p>It was pitch-black and dark. Meng Qi’s eyes were half-opened, as if he was sitting before the opening of the sky, the beginning of all living things, but Gu Xiaosang was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>..</p><p>Dark clouds hung over the sky, the wind howled, and the waves were a thousand feet high. Bolts of lightning filled the sky, illuminating the darkness.</p><p>In such extreme weather, not only did the ships not dare to sail, even the experts on the exterior did not want to fly. After all, if they were not careful, they might be struck by lightning.</p><p>At the edge of a deserted island, a few young-looking warriors were hiding in a cave. They watched the heavy rain fall, but there was no panic on their faces. Instead, they seemed to have taken a half-day of leisure.</p><p>“Do you think that when the human emperor establishes the Great Zhou on Changmen Island this time, there will be an important figure from the other side coming?”A man with sparse eyebrows asked.</p><p>Another man whose facial features could barely be considered Zhou Zheng shook his head and laughed. “An important figure from the other side is high and mighty. With a flip of his hand, he can destroy the entire real world. How can he come for a trivial matter like establishing the Great Zhou again? Unless the human emperor can enter the middle-earth again, destroy his hometown of vacuum and the Buddhist kingdom on Earth, unify this world, and achieve the peak of humanity…”</p><p>He paused and said, “But no matter what, when the human emperor re-established the Great Zhou and re-established the human way, many immortals will seek refuge with him. If we rush there, we will have a good chance to meet an immortal and join a sect of an immortal god.”</p><p>They were warriors of the Eastern Sea and had known each other during their travels. They had always wanted to find an opportunity to join the sect of the immortal and seek the path of immortality. Unfortunately, they had been to many islands and caves but were all rejected. It was difficult for them to have an immortal destiny.., after hearing that Gao Sheng had established the Great Zhou on Changmen Island, they had thought of going there to try their luck.</p><p>A young girl wearing a pink jacket looked at the man who had spoken just now and said, “Brother Tan, when you were born, there was a red light all over the house, and you had a strange body. However, it was difficult for the immortals to enter, and they had a lot of training. That’s why you have wasted your time until now. This time, when you go to Changmen Island, you will definitely get what you want.”</p><p>Tan Ping was half bitter and half proud. His gaze casually looked outside the cave. Through the curtain-like rain, he saw the sea surface that was like a heaven-swallowing behemoth.</p><p>Suddenly, his eyes turned cold. He saw a young Daoist wearing a water suit and a fan-cloud crown sitting cross-legged in the rolling waves. No matter how the sea surface surged, it didn’t move at all.</p><p>Immortal?</p><p>I met an immortal here?</p><p>Did My Immortal Destiny come?</p><p>Tan Ping swallowed his saliva. He didn’t have time to greet his companions. He turned into a streak of light and flew over despite the heavy rain.</p><p>He came to the seaside and saw that the young Daoist was still there. However, his eyes were deep as he watched quietly.</p><p>“This junior tan ping pays his respects to the Immortal Elder.”He bowed respectfully, guessing in his heart which mountain, island, or cave the other party was from.</p><p>Then, he heard a clear and low voice, “This humble Daoist has a pillow that can turn time upside down. It has endless mysteries. Today, you and I are fated. I can lend it to you. However, this matter concerns your fate. This humble Daoist does not force it. You have to make your own decision.”</p><p>Tan Ping was stunned for a moment. Then, the unwillingness and desire from the past emerged in his heart. Without hesitation, he said resolutely,</p><p>“This junior is willing!”</p><p>As soon as he said that, he saw a red and yellow light being thrown over. It landed in his arms. It was a pillow with a dark yellow color. There were many mysterious patterns and two characters on it:</p><p>“Yellow Millet!”</p><p>Tan Ping raised his head. The waves in front of him surged up and the young Daoist was gone.</p><p>Which immortal abode did he come from?</p><p>At this moment, his companions rushed over and asked all kinds of questions. After Tan Ping gave a brief explanation, they were all curious and asked him to try the ‘yellow millet pillow’when he returned to the cave.</p><p>Tan Ping was also itching to try it. He rushed back to the cave and tried for a long time. After eliminating many methods, he lay down and leaned against the yellow millet pillow to fall into a deep sleep.</p><p>A faint light appeared in front of his eyes, and Tan Ping suddenly woke up. The yellow millet pillow hadn’t changed, but the surroundings were no longer a cave. Instead, it was an elegant room, and there was a clamor outside.</p><p>He tilted his head to listen, and a loud shout echoed out:</p><p>“Saint-emperor offers sacrifices to the heavens, all evil shall disperse!”</p><p>Saint-emperor?</p><p>Saint-emperor’s enlightenment?</p><p>Could it be that I’ve fallen into the yellow millet pillow and returned to the past?</p><p>Tan Ping was somewhat dumbstruck. He had actually returned to the past. This was a fortuitous encounter that had never been recorded before!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
