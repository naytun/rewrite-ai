The Big Dipper Emperor seemed to have sensed the remnant aura at the bottom of the immortal realm’s heavenly prison after Meng Qi and Liu Luo returned. He once again soared into the sky, dragging a long flame tail as he flew into the depths of the void.., it was unknown where he would eventually run to, where he would stop, or whether he would forever drift in the pitch-black darkness.</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi, who was standing under the pure white canopy, frowned slightly. He turned his head to look at the position of the black prison’s heavenly prison, as if he was looking for something.</p><p>“Is there an anomaly?”As an ancient god with rich experience in expeditions, Liu Luo was keenly aware of this and secretly asked.</p><p>Meng Qi mused for a moment before shaking his head. “I can’t explain why I feel an inexplicable sense of familiarity. I think it’s because I’m too cautious and cautious, causing me to panic…”</p><p>The surroundings were dark. Other than time and space, there was nothing else. There were also no signs of danger. After Liu Luo was on high alert for a moment, he finally believed that Meng Qi was indeed too sensitive after the Big Dipper sovereign drove the immortal realm prison to the point that his shadow could not be seen.</p><p>When the light of the ancient constellation and the aura of the heavenly emperor’s remnant completely disappeared, the space where the big dipper sovereign had stopped suddenly began to squirm. A black figure appeared and transformed into a human figure.</p><p>He wore an ancient immortal’s robe and wore a crown on his head. His aura was long and seemed to span through the ages. He was clearly the leader of the twelve divine envoys under Mother Wusheng, the same ruler as the world, Zhen Yuan Zi!</p><p>Just now, he almost couldn’t help but take action. He used his sleeve to capture Meng Qi and Liu Luo, but the subtle aura made him choose to give up in the end.</p><p>If he didn’t have the confidence to capture the two of them and let one of them escape, exposing the fact that he had appeared in the Celestial Realm’s heavenly prison, then the more important matter would be troublesome.</p><p>Zhen Yuan Zi’s original purpose of this trip had nothing to do with the layout of the heavenly prison. However, after he happened to witness the grand occasion of the “Heavenly Emperor’s patrol”, he secretly tracked them down and secretly observed the entire process. He was pleasantly surprised.</p><p>The inexplicable spying in the darkness that Meng Qi and Liu Luo sensed came partly from the Ghost Emperor Cheng Tang and Xing Tian, and partly from Zhen Yuan Zi. However, they were mixed up. With someone taking the blame, it was really difficult to detect the truth!</p><p>Taking a step forward, Zhen Yuan Zi’s sleeves fluttered. With the grace of an ancient immortal, he once again entered the Heavenly Prison of the immortal world. After passing through layers of stairs, he passed through the dark and deep pit and arrived at the place where the illusory millstone crushed the avenue of authority,</p><p>looking at the desolate land in the depths of the black fog, Zhen Yuan Zi took a light breath and sighed inwardly:</p><p>“It really is so.”</p><p>At the beginning of the epoch, when heaven and earth were separated, the Clear Air Rose and formed the immortal realm. The turbid air descended and there was the nine Netherworlds. It seemed to be clearly divided and repelled each other. However, as one entity, how could there not be a subtle connection? It was just like the extreme yin and the extreme yang, the Yang Extreme and Yin birth, they were mixed together and returned to the Tai Chi.</p><p>The bottom of the immortal realm’s heavenly prison was the place where the ‘clear extreme and turbid condensation’was located. It could directly sense the connection to the nine nether regions. It was precisely because of this that the heavenly emperor placed the secret reincarnation and the Ghost Emperor’s avatar here. Once the reincarnation was formed.., the Ghost Emperor was pregnant with a spirit, and he could ‘Reincarnate’into Luo Feng or the black prison without anyone knowing. He would wait for an opportunity to replace Ghost Emperor Xuan Ming, and then pass through the reincarnation to become the true master of the underworld. He would then seize the key to the final tribulation.</p><p>The authority and the will of reincarnation that Su Meng had absorbed made people envious. The Heavenly Emperor avatar that he had taken away made people wary. However, these were not the most important things in this world!</p><p>Zhen Yuan Zi slowly sank. The Divine Talismans and runes on the Crimson Jade text around him were prominent. They continued to connect and condense, eventually forming one blurry dao pattern after another. Even the three dao patterns at the core were almost complete and clear.</p><p>As soon as the blurry dao patterns appeared, the Millstone Vortex that had been destroyed by Meng Qi appeared once again. It slowly rotated and crushed all things, giving birth to a subtle reincarnation intent.</p><p>He had actually reconstructed more than 50% of the Heavenly Emperor’s arrangements with the help of the onlookers just now!</p><p>Zhen Yuan Zi’s figure sank deeper and deeper. At first, he was like a black dot. Then, he gave birth to some ghost qi and some death intent in the reincarnation. It was as if he had been reincarnated as a ghost emperor. A long sigh reverberated faintly:</p><p>“So what if I’m the same as the Lord in the world? In the end, it’s all for naught…”</p><p>The black dot sank faster, as if it had passed through a subtle barrier and quietly fell into Luo Feng’s black prison.</p><p>The illusory millstone that had reappeared gradually disappeared.</p><p>After a while, a dot of light suddenly appeared. Then, it burst out with boundless light, illuminating the darkness of this realm. It was burning lamp, who had 24 circles of perfect Buddhist light behind his head, who had rushed over.</p><p>“Su Meng and Xuan Nu have already left,”burning lamp said with neither joy nor sorrow.</p><p>In a round of Buddhist light, Ah Nan sat in the lotus position and smiled leisurely:</p><p>“As long as they still point to the big dipper chariot, then I can be sure of their next resting place. I will rush there in advance and block them there.”</p><p>Burning lamp ancient Buddha nodded slightly. He looked at the hazy yin soil covered by the black gas and sighed with emotion. “The heavenly emperor is indeed worthy of being a mighty lord who can suppress his whole life. He has already begun to set up the Yin world by himself.”</p><p>Ah nan chuckled, “The end of the tribulation is like the extinguishing of a man’s lamp. There are immeasurable benefits in establishing and controlling a complete yin world. Not only is it necessary for the embryonic form of the dao fruit, but it is also the key to the tribulation. With the Heavenly Emperor’s shrewdness and knowledge, how could he not notice it? “The 18 levels of Hell of your Buddhism, the six paths of reincarnation, the Pure Land of Bliss, the Buddhist kingdom on Earth, the vacuum homeland of Luoism, the ancient underworld of demons and gods, and the Yin soil of the Dao sect’s emperor are all such attempts, aren’t They?”</p><p>The ancient underworld of the ten halls of Yama, the Yellow Springs of reincarnation, which had once been established by Haotian Taoism, Buddhism, the demi-human race, and the gods of the Heavenly Court, collapsed after the Falling Battle of the Heavenly Court because of mutual destruction.</p><p>The two casually chatted for a while, and the ancient Buddha with the burning lamp turned into a long rainbow and rushed out of the Heavenly Prison of the immortal world. According to Ah Nan’s guidance, he went straight to the depths of the void.</p><p>..</p><p>“Young master Wang, What do you mean? Do you want to release him and bring harm to the common people?”The Snow Mountain sect leader was shocked and almost could not control his emotions. His expression darkened as he asked solemnly.</p><p>Wang Siyuan’s whereabouts from behind the Dharma body had become a mystery. His current strength was unfathomable. The Snow Mountain sect had not had a dharma body for many generations. No matter how deep their foundation was, with the legacy of a venerated immortal, they were probably not a match for him!</p><p>Wang Siyuan clenched his left hand into a fist and pressed it against his mouth. He did not answer directly. He looked around and said,</p><p>“Your sect has been mistaken about one thing. The one suppressed in the venerated immortal’s ancient tomb has always been known as ‘He’in the outside world. People often recite his name, but he did not escape.”</p><p>“How is that possible?”The Snow Mountain sect leader blurted out in shock.</p><p>The nine venerated immortals had clearly warned him in this way.</p><p>“Only when the person who recited his name knows that he is suppressed here, can he use this opportunity to escape,”Wang Siyuan said with a smile, “Moreover, his situation is special. It is neither here nor there. There is probably only one person in this world who can accurately describe his name. It is not what you normally think.”</p><p>The Flames in his eyes danced crazily, as if he wanted to break some seal and release a certain name!</p><p>The sect master of the Snow Mountain sect was shocked and furious. “Are you crazy? What are you trying to do?”</p><p>Wang Siyuan smiled and said, “If you don’t let him out, let me in and lend you the nine tokens.”</p><p>“Aren’t you afraid of Death?”The sect master of the Snow Mountain sect did not expect such an answer.</p><p>Wang Siyuan coughed a few times and laughed out loud:</p><p>“A madman will not be afraid.”</p><p>..</p><p>The Big Dipper Emperor Chariot tore through the darkness. After flying for an unknown amount of time, Meng Qi began to feel a wonderful sense of separation around him. From time to time, he would see mirage-like illusory scenes flashing before his eyes.</p><p>There were divine generals and heavenly soldiers in Golden Armor, a majestic and sacred great hall, broken walls that were burning with raging flames, and shimmering fragments of light… all of this made Liu Luo frown slightly. He felt as if he had returned to the heavenly court in the past.</p><p>At this moment, a wave of light lit up, and a long river quietly flowed around the Big Dipper Emperor Chariot. It was so wide that one could not see the end of it, nor the end of it. Time flew by, and time flowed.</p><p>“River of time, why isn’t there a future tributary…”Meng Qi exclaimed.</p><p>Suddenly, the water downstream of the river of time rippled, and a figure slowly came riding on a kui cow. There was a sword hanging at his waist, and a clear treasure light floated behind his head. It seemed to contain all kinds of principles and all kinds of possibilities, including the past, present, and future.., it was perfect and flawless.</p><p>This figure was covered in auspicious light, and it was hard to see it clearly. He leisurely sang a song and said,</p><p>“Opening up the heaven and opening up the truth, discussing the scriptures and traveling to the capital.”</p><p>“The five Qi Dynasty transmits the marvelous arts, the three flowers gather at the top to play the role of Wu Sheng.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
