There was a clear difference from the darkness brought about by the erosion of the Netherworld at the end of the new age. It felt refreshing.</p><p>Could it really be the early Middle Ages, during the reign of the sacred emperor? Could it be that he had really returned to the past?</p><p>Yellow millet pillow, yellow millet pillow… could it be that it was just a dream that was close to reality?</p><p>Surprise, doubt, confusion, and other emotions surged in Tan Ping’s mind. He saw specks of white light descending from the sky, and only when they got close did he realize that it was a scene of heavenly flowers falling from the sky.</p><p>“Sacred Emperor is offering sacrifices to the heavens, and all the evil spirits are retreating!”</p><p>The loud shout he heard earlier reverberated once more, and streaks of multicolored light rose up from the horizon. They spread out, forming a vast path of light. Then, a violent wind howled, and rain dripped down, marquis Feng and uncle Yu, the two legendary mighty figures, brought their divine weapons and immortal generals under them to open a path. It was vast and mighty, and each of their auras made Tan Ping feel inferior.</p><p>Behind Marquis Feng and uncle Yu, streaks and streaks of lightning streaked across the horizon, illuminating the world. Marquis Lei and the Lightning Empress protected the emperor carriage as they slowly drove over. The sounds of thunder were like the sounds of a welcoming ceremony.</p><p>The Emperor Carriage’s design was simple and unadorned. It was stained with spots of blood. The colors were all different, and there was also a powerful will hidden within. It was as if they had died with their eyes open. An ancient and demonic aura filled the sky, and the carriage was being dragged by nine horned flood dragons, their bodies were agile, and every inch of their flesh and blood contained explosive power. Just looking at them made tan ping want to bow down to them.</p><p>The emperor’s chariot was surrounded by beaded curtains, and one could vaguely see a tall figure with a mighty pressure in all directions. The King’s Dao Aura around it condensed into a corporeal form. There were mountains, rivers, suns, moons, and stars surrounding it. Just looking at it made Tan Ping’s eyes hurt, he didn’t dare to look directly at it.</p><p>This kind of aura, this feeling, was more terrifying than any immortal god he had encountered in the past when he was seeking immortality and Dao. It was even more unfathomable than the wind marquis, Uncle Yu, and the Lightning Marquis, perhaps only the mysterious and unfathomable immortal who had lent him the golden millet pillow could compare.</p><p>Tan Ping lowered his head, not daring to look at it again. He already had an understanding in his heart.</p><p>If it was a dream, it was absolutely impossible for him to imagine the grandeur of the Sacred Emperor’s enlightenment!</p><p>What he had seen just now was real. It was not an illusion or a dream!</p><p>He had really returned to the Middle Ages and the past. This was a great opportunity!</p><p>Here, although he was the exterior scene, he had an advantage that even the almighty experts and divine arts practitioners could not hope to attain. That was knowing the future development and the inevitability of the future. The heavenly secrets were all in his heart, and he relied on this.., it wasn’t difficult for him to accomplish great things, become an immortal and become an ancestor!</p><p>Tan Ping was very confident about this. Although he was born in the 28 worlds of the Seven Seas, and his past history was separated from that of the middle-earth, it had been two to three hundred years since he returned from the end of the East Sea. Back then, there was still the universal sphere of knowledge that connected the north and South Seas.., he had left behind many ancient books, so it wasn’t difficult for him to know the main events and general trends of the middle-ancient history.</p><p>Thinking of this, he could not help but tremble. He felt that the beautiful prospect of his life was within reach, and a Golden Avenue lay at his feet.</p><p>“Is this the ‘treatment of the main character’mentioned in those novels…”Tan Ping’s thoughts ran wild.</p><p>When he traveled to different sea areas, he had read many novels that had been passed down from hundreds of years ago in many markets. It was said that they were left behind by people who wanted to copy them after the universal universal knowledge ball broke.</p><p>After a full quarter of an hour, the sky had long since returned to normal. Only then did tan ping wake up. He recalled the history he knew and saw what opportunities he could seize recently.</p><p>“The Sacred Emperor’s sacrifice to heaven must be at Jiangdong Longtai. Even if this place isn’t close to the East Sea, it must not be too far away.”He thought to himself. “The East Sea… during the sacred emperor’s reign…”</p><p>Suddenly, Tan Ping thought of something. His eyes were filled with ecstasy:</p><p>“The Miao Yan Palace!”</p><p>“The Miao Yan Palace appeared once in this period of history. Immortal cultivation manuals such as the Taiyi longevity scripture, the true formula of Taiyi’s salvation, and the Qinghua Spirit text were passed down, along with many treasures!”</p><p>The Miao Yan Palace was known as the Miao Yan Palace in the Qinghua World of the east. It was also the place where the heavenly venerate Taiyi’s salvation was located. After the Green Emperor ascended to the other shore, it merged with the Fusang Ancient Tree realm. It was famous in the ancient times, it had not been long since it had hidden in the underworld. It had only appeared once during the Middle Ages. It was during the reign of the sacred emperor.</p><p>Tan Ping paced back and forth in excitement as he thought to himself,</p><p>“I’ve heard that the great figures of the other shore are everywhere in the past, present, and future. However, I’m only taking some benefits. It Won’t affect anything…”</p><p>“I don’t dare to do this, and I don’t dare to do that either. Isn’t this a waste of an opportunity?”</p><p>Tan Ping quickly suppressed his anxiety. He followed the records and set up his escape light, heading straight for the Green Rock Mountain of the Eastern Sea.</p><p>This mountain was remote and desolate. It was close to the end of the eastern sea that had disappeared. Although Tan Ping knew the general area, he didn’t have any specific knowledge. It took him half a year to find the corresponding object and follow the map to find it.</p><p>Looking at the withered grass and the small mountain island, Tan Ping wouldn’t have believed that there was a Daoist rite temple hidden here if he didn’t know it was here.</p><p>As he lamented, he descended his escape light and searched for clues. He was afraid that he would be too late and miss that part of history.</p><p>A few days passed, and Tan Ping was pleasantly surprised to find a magical valley. As soon as he stepped into it, a dense fog emerged.</p><p>“It is indeed here!”He held back his excitement and kept moving forward in the dense fog. The valley, which seemed to be only a thousand feet long, had been walking for three days and three nights.</p><p>Suddenly, the dense fog dispersed and tan ping’s eyes lit up. He saw colorful clouds overlapping and purple clouds filling the sky. There were strange flowers everywhere and spiritual springs gushing out from the ground. The plants and trees were flourishing to the extreme and full of vitality, he immediately understood that he had arrived at another world.</p><p>In the distance, there were towering mountains, lush forests, and layers of pavilions. Auspicious lights rose from time to time.</p><p>Tan Ping took a deep breath and flew up. He carefully approached the magnificent pavilion and opened the door of the Miyan Palace, which seemed to be unlocked and unsealed, a dark red and pitch-black lake suddenly appeared in front of his eyes. It looked like blood and filth, full of the entanglement of karma and the convergence of death.</p><p>In the middle of the lake, a green lotus flower bloomed. Its petals were bright and contained strong vitality. Sitting on it was a tall and thin Daoist in a water-blue robe with a bamboo crown on his head. His eyes were closed and his breath was completely gone, it was as if he had fallen into a deep sleep, or as if he had been in meditation for a long time.</p><p>“Medicine master Wang Fo is quite active in this era, so the Taiyi Celestial Master of salvation is sleeping to avoid it?”Tan Ping was shocked and almost broke out in sweat. He only had the mood to ask this question when he found that the Daoist had not moved at all.</p><p>He could not understand the mysteries of the other shore, so he respectfully bowed to the Taiyi Celestial Master of Salvation, who did not know if he was dead or alive:</p><p>“I did not mean to offend you, heavenly venerate. I just followed the plan and came here by destiny. Please do not blame me, heavenly venerate. If I am lucky enough to get something, I will worship you day and night. I do not dare to forget your kindness.”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, his heart suddenly palpitated. He looked up and saw the heavenly venerate Taiyi opened his eyes, and his aura slowly spread out.</p><p>He was alive?</p><p>He was awake?</p><p>Tan Ping felt like he was going crazy from fear. His whole body trembled and his vision turned black.</p><p>“I understand.”A gentle voice sounded in his ear.</p><p>What did he understand? Tan Ping looked around blankly. He saw the light and shadows around him changing, as if pieces of debris were being peeled off.</p><p>“Ah!”He cried out and sat up abruptly. He found that he had returned to the cave and was surrounded by his old friends.</p><p>A Dream?</p><p>A dream that could even imitate the aura of the sacred Emperor Qi and the Primordial Heavenly Lord of Salvation?</p><p>In his confusion, Tan Ping found that there was an extra thing in his arms. It was a bead that was emitting spots of green light. There seemed to be countless talismans floating in it. It was very mysterious.</p><p>“What is this?”The girl in the pink coat asked in confusion.</p><p>He didn’t remember that brother Tan had such a beautiful bead..</p><p>Tan Ping looked around and didn’t know if it was a dream or not. When his good friends were talking about it, he exhaled and said, “This is the harvest of a golden millet dream…”</p><p>Did he really return to the past in the “Dream”? Did he see the Primordial Heavenly Lord of Salvation?</p><p>“It’s so magical!”The man with sparse eyebrows exclaimed.</p><p>Tan Ping calmed down a little and thought for a moment, “Why don’t you try it?”</p><p>“Can we?”The girl in the pink coat was surprised and happy.</p><p>Tan Ping smiled slightly. “Those who see it will have a share, and those who share the fate of immortality will share it. This is what a good friend looks like.”</p><p>They couldn’t hide this thing from each other and cause cracks to appear between them. They could even kill each other to silence each other, right?</p><p>Under the unanimous sighs and thanks of the others, the girl in the pink coat lay down. She remained calm and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p>After a while, she woke up and shook her head blankly. “I didn’t dream anything.”</p><p>Tan Ping looked at the pillow and saw that its color was dim and the patterns were obscure, as if it had used up all its strength. However, specks of light condensed and were recovering.</p><p>“It might take a few days before it can be used again,”tan ping judged.</p><p>The man with sparse eyebrows nodded slightly. “Then we’ll talk about it when we get to Changmen Island.”</p><p>Changmen Island? Tan Ping subconsciously looked outside the cave and saw that the storm had subsided, the dark clouds had dispersed, the moon and stars were sparse, and the whole world seemed to have been washed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
