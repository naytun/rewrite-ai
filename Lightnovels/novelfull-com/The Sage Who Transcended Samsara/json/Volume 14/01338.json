A blood-brown river rushed in from the sky and rushed into the yellow spring that ran through this world. It connected the vacuum hometown that had assimilated the netherworld to Luo Feng’s domain, filling it with dreamlike mist, inside the six layers of pitch-black dead peak that was formed by the most ancient turbid qi, Ghost Emperor Xuan Ming looked at the upstream of the blood-brown River quietly. His eyes were throbbing with angry flames.</p><p>Over the years, he had slowly lost control of Luo Feng and could only retreat to the training hall. It would not be long before he had to give up this layer completely and return to black prison.</p><p>At this moment, his eyes reflected a hint of blood. It was as if the ocean formed by the blood and flesh essence of all the living beings in the world was pouring down with the fall of a palm, surging toward the boundary of nine remoteness, he wanted to swallow the blood-brown afterworld and cut off the connection between Luo Feng’s black prison and his hometown of vacuum.</p><p>“Chance!”</p><p>Although Ghost Emperor Xuanming had always been cruel and cold, and liked to eat flesh and blood, he was definitely not a chaotic, crazy, and almost irrational existence like nine Chaos Celestial Master. He instantly understood the whole story and made the choice that was most beneficial to himself, without hesitation, he extended his ghost claw from the pitch-black Death Peak.</p><p>Wherever it passed, the eternal squall condensed into a sky full of snowflakes, and the barren yin soil turned into layers of crystal-like ice spirits. One by one, the vengeful souls and ghosts flew up and fell into the claw, the pitch-black silent vortex that created the path of death and the yin ghost silently slapped toward the boundary of the nine Netherworlds.</p><p>Outside the nine remoteness world, a bright moon suddenly rose in the center of the blood-brown river. It was flawless and contained all the daos. It was sparkling and clean, and it sprinkled out specks of divine light that made the blood sea disappear layer by layer. It made the silent whirlpool seem to be assimilated, it made the “Yellow Springs”that ran through the two worlds in a state that was difficult to reach.</p><p>Faced with the incident that endangered the connection between Luo Feng’s black prison and his hometown of vacuum, mother Wusheng did not hesitate at all. She personally went down and made the first move!</p><p>However, at this moment, the green light in the void flickered and a vigorous green tree grew out of it. The branches were blowing on the mysterious fruits, which were blooming with divine light and resonating with the bell chimes.</p><p>The light slowed down, and the roots of the huge tree spread and pierced into the perfect “Bright Moon”. The two of them were in an intense battle.</p><p>Emperor Qing had descended his divine power from the eastern glazed world!</p><p>Meanwhile, the Elysium Realm, the Bodhi Pure Land, the Tusita Palace, and the Monster Emperor Palace were all quiet as if no one was there. It was unknown whether it was because they were involved with each other or because the western two saints were happy that the gold emperor had lost Luo Feng.</p><p>A huge black shadow rose up from the blood-brown river. Zhen Yuan Zi, who had already become the ghost emperor, held the plain-colored cloud realm flag in one hand and the heaven’s punishment axe in the other. He followed the surging waves and went straight for the blood sea and the Ghost Claw. He wanted to fight one against two, he wanted to maintain the connection.</p><p>A dense mist covered the ground and a strange fragrance enveloped it. Once the Blood Sea was illuminated, it immediately slowed down. It was as if it had sunk into a swamp and was enveloped by the flag. Meanwhile, the Heaven’s punishment axe revealed nine dao patterns, the intent of punishment transformed into Black Lightning and dark-green flames as it pounced towards the ghost claw.</p><p>Yang Jian suddenly chuckled. With a shake of his palm, red bubbles immediately appeared in the blood sea one after another. The bubbles expanded and exploded with a loud bang. They continued to explode, setting off endless explosions, finally, they converged into a single sound.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Sea of blood returned to nothingness as a storm swept in all directions, forcing the plain-colored cloud realm flag back.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The various levels of the nine Netherworld felt deafening. Even the evil gods and evil demons in the Crimson mountain range could not help but feel dizzy. Their auras were like tiny sparks that strung together to form a prairie fire, the red stream at the core of the eighth level of the nine Netherworld seemed to be corporeal. Qi Zhengyan suddenly opened his eyes and looked at the source of the explosion. There were four Golden and clear stars between his brows.</p><p>More than a hundred years had passed, and with the protection of Meng Qi and Yang Jian, he was able to prove himself as a legend and step into serendipity!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Yang Jian unscrupulously triggered the explosion of the Sea of blood to plunder the surrounding energy, causing the blood-brown river to emit a sharp tidal sound. Following that, it disintegrated inch by inch into segments.</p><p>Destruction was always easier than protection!</p><p>Furthermore, Yang Jian was only targeting the segment in the netherworld. He did not intend to affect the river in the outside world!</p><p>The Yellow Springs disintegrated and the two worlds were cut off. The misty fog dispersed without wind. The green wood and the bright moon disappeared immediately, no longer engaging in useless battles.</p><p>Zhen Yuan Zi hovered outside the Netherworld and gave Yang Jian a deep look. Then, he held the plain-colored cloud realm flag and the heaven punishing axe. He went against the current and returned to the netherworld. The erosion and assimilation of his vacuum homeworld to Luo Feng came to an abrupt end.</p><p>On the other side, outside the Black Heavenly Emperor’s Daoist Rite Temple, the sword Qi of slaughter and destruction that roamed freely gradually dissipated, revealing the somewhat wretched peerless demon lord and the lifeless Netherworld Sea Sword.</p><p>Meng Qi’s one-qi three-clarity divine ability had consumed too much energy and was close to its limit. Seeing that Yang Jian had succeeded, he ended the immortal slaying sword array and appeared on the top of the pitch-black mountain where he had previously sat in the lotus position. It was as if he had never slashed out sword qi.</p><p>“If he really wants to fight, then he’ll fight. If he wants to leave, then he’ll leave…”the demon lord’s eyes were subtle as he felt hatred in his heart.</p><p>His own knowledge was actually not much inferior to Su Meng’s. Even if he encountered the great divine ability, one Qi three purities, and relied on his supreme demon body’s invulnerability, he still had a chance to last until the time limit for his incarnation arrived. However, if he could not withstand the other party’s immortal vanquishing sword array.., if he could not withstand the other party’s possession of two peerless divine weapons, then he did not have a single one!</p><p>Comparing people was truly infuriating!</p><p>The Netherworld Sea sword transformed into a dim light and returned to the bottom level of the netherworld. It returned to the seven kills Daoist’s hands, and the demon lord also vanished. His escape technique was mysterious and extremely concealed. It was unknown where he had hidden to, but in this aspect, he was stronger than Meng Qi.</p><p>The Netherworld quickly returned to ‘peace’. Mother Wusheng’s hundred years of hard work could not stir up any waves, and all her efforts were destroyed in an instant.</p><p>‘this is only the beginning…’Meng Qi thought to himself. He raised his head and looked at the other layer of nine underworlds. His eyes met Yang Jian’s as they nodded slightly.</p><p>After severing mother Wusheng’s hand that reached into nine underworlds and forcing the Black Heavenly Emperor to defend the Daoist rite temple, many things could be done. He was no longer afraid of being spied on by important figures!</p><p>Meng Qi closed his eyes. The heart in his chest suddenly began to beat faster.</p><p>Dong Dong Dong, Dong Dong Dong. It was filled with purple qi, like a bell, filled with the ancient and original intent.</p><p>Dong Dong Dong, Dong Dong Dong. The sound of the heart beating was isolated by his body. Even if he was standing next to Meng Qi, it was difficult for him to hear it.</p><p>Dong Dong Dong, Dong Dong Dong, Dong Dong. Meng Qi connected the beating of the Purple Heart to the Tuoba Palace in the dark, and he received a response that was neither sad nor happy.</p><p>Once the response came, Meng Qi’s illusory and hazy purple heart beat even more intensely. It was more mysterious and strange than any skyfiend, including the easygoing son of heaven.</p><p>In the real world.</p><p>Mr. Lu Da, who had moved the Thrush Grange to the eastern sea realm, was still guarding the solitary grave. His mind would occasionally recall the events of middle-earth a hundred or two years ago, the reconciliation that had been difficult for thousands of years, and Guldo, who had failed to return from the Middle Ages, and Su Meng, who had personally witnessed him step by step from Enlightenment to good fortune, and who had no other choice..</p><p>Sixty years ago, he suddenly slashed out a dazzling sword light from the grass hut. It was bright, clean, and pure. He hacked toward the sword washing pavilion, which had also moved to the Eastern Sea. He exchanged a move with nameless su across space, and with that sword light.., he had finally walked down an unprecedented path. The spiritual light of his nature first entered the infinite heights, and then reflected on the various realms, obtaining a projection.</p><p>After taking this step, he had accumulated a lot of experience. In just a short thirty years, he had already formed a destiny. Now, he was already in the middle range and had caught up with nameless su.</p><p>Mr. Lu put down the wooden sculpture in his hand and looked at the undulating green waves. He thought of the green jade box that had caused a stir recently.</p><p>“I wonder what state young friend Su is in now.”Just as this thought appeared in his mind, the image of Meng Qi in the past appeared in his mind. His green robe was carefree, and his smile was close to his face.</p><p>At this moment, the image of Meng Qi cupped his hands, and his eyes were suffused with illusory purple qi!</p><p>This… Mr. Lu da seemed to be deep in thought. As if nothing had happened, he withdrew his gaze, picked up the knife again, and focused on carving.</p><p>On an island in the East China Sea, there was a white-haired old man lying on a rocking chair, basking in the warm afternoon sun. He casually told the child beside him about the prosperity of the Great Zhou.</p><p>“If the Great Zhou dynasty didn’t perish, the martial arts exchange between the myriad realm shopping mall, the video teaching, and the Forum group wouldn’t have collapsed. I, your great-grandfather, would most likely have been able to break through to the Dharma body stage and become an immortal. No matter how bad it was, I would have been able to seek refuge with the human emperor, obtain a divine position, and protect an area..</p><p>“At that time, the Holy Land of the immortals was the hollow jade temple of Mount Kunlun, and the Hierarch was the immortal venerated Emperor Yuan, Su Meng. He was the person whom your great-grandfather admired and respected the most in his life…”</p><p>The old man recalled the past in his heart. He thought back to the first time the heaven sealing platform was successfully built, and the figure of the immortal emperor, Su Meng, who was observing the ceremony.</p><p>What he did not notice was that the eyes of the figure in his heart were suddenly dyed with a touch of illusory purple. It was as if his heart was beating.</p><p>In the real world, similar situations happened one after another quietly.</p><p>..</p><p>Outside the demon Emperor Hall, a somersault cloud floated over and landed at the door. It transformed into the monkey king, Sun Wukong, who was wearing a golden chain armor.</p><p>He scratched his cheeks and said to the demon guarding the door, “I, Sun Wukong, am here to meet the Demon Emperor.”</p><p>Facing his childhood idol, the demon guarding the door did not dare to stop him. Furthermore, the door behind him opened. It was obvious that he had received the approval of the Demon Emperor.</p><p>After passing through numerous gates and entering deep into the demon Emperor Palace, Sun Wukong suddenly stopped. In his mind, he visualized Meng Qi’s figure in a black robe.</p><p>A purple light flashed and his heartbeat appeared. This figure had actually come to life!</p><p>Sun Wukong pointed with his finger and slashed out this thought. The purple light within it rose up and his heartbeat became clear. It stretched out and became Meng Qi’s incarnation.</p><p>The supreme path of inner demons was used to secretly pay a visit to the monster emperor!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
