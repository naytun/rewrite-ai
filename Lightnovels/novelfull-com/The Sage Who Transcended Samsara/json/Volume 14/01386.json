Even the Great Peacock King Kong Xuan was severely injured. At this moment, the demons were affected by the reversal of the Ten Thousand Buddhas Formation, at the same time, they had to fight against Amitabha or one of the ancient bodhi buddhas who “Just happened to be here”. They could not even protect themselves, let alone protect the demons. The situation was precarious.</p><p>At this juncture, the Monkey King Grand Sage, who had always been brave and brave, was severely injured by the fall of the Ten Thousand Buddhas. However, he relied on the physical strength of the eight-nine arcane art and wanted to summon his remaining strength to use his golden cudgel to break through the spiritual mountain and rebuild the Pure Land, he created life for the other demon Grand Sages. At the same time, he saw his teacher, the ancient Bodhi Buddha, he heard words like “There are many limitations to an innately strong body. Why not use this opportunity to reincarnate and seek the next life to prove the path to the other shore”. He felt the attraction of the power of the golden form of the Saint Buddha.</p><p>However, making this choice meant giving up on the great saints of the demon race and completely standing on the side of the Buddhist sect. Therefore, he first called out “Teacher”in a low voice and then roared. He did not cultivate the next life and swung his club with all his might, piercing through the spiritual mountain, he almost died completely. Fortunately, he was saved by the heavenly venerate of morals, who intervened in this battle. After refining for all eternity, he was finally alive and kicking again, maintaining his peak condition.</p><p>Such a scene flashed in Meng Qi’s mind. Although he had yet to “Step Foot”into the Battle of Mount Ling, and he did not know how many ancient elders fought against each other, he knew many details today, he could already deduce what happened to the equal-heaven Grand Sage.</p><p>Looking at the golden body of the Saint Buddha, whose aura was covered by the Bodhi Tree, Meng Qi had a new understanding of the sudden outbreak of the Battle of the other shore:</p><p>The ancient Bodhi Buddha had completed the Three Corpses and restored his peak state. He was now qualified to participate in the battle for the last Calamity Dao fruit. The heavenly venerate of virtue did not interfere in the battle and seemed to be completely unprepared. However, he was able to obtain a portion of the four immortal slaying swords or the formation map, furthermore, because he had assimilated the golden body of the Holy Buddha, he had completed eight or nine incarnations and cut out ‘Lord Qingyuan’. He was able to further reduce the gap and was considered the biggest winner!</p><p>Amitabha was also able to obtain a portion of the four immortal slaying swords or the formation diagram. He was able to resolve the karma of the three Bodhi ancient Buddhas without any hesitation. The Heavenly Emperor was able to obtain a certain degree of relief, he was able to accumulate karma for some future schemes. The Green Emperor was able to obtain one of the four immortal slaying swords. Amitabha was able to obtain the golden body of the Holy Buddha and complete the eight-nine arcane art. He was able to progress further while bearing heavy karma and grand aspirations The demon Buddha had refined the nine underworld and ascended to the level of an ancient man in one fell swoop. Even if he had his own strength to hold him back, he would not be weaker than the Bodhi ancient Buddha; the monster Emperor did not obtain it, but he did not lose it either.</p><p>Other than the two abnormal shores of the Supreme True Buddha and the monster of the Heavenly Dao, seven out of the nine had benefited, and one was unharmed. Only the gold emperor had weakened a lot, but the four celestial slaying swords and the formation map were things that he would definitely lose, using this to exchange for some unknown benefits or karma given by the Devil Buddha could be considered equal, and it had even turned a passive into an active one.</p><p>There was no loser in this struggle for the other shore!</p><p>The various tributaries of the future were clearly reflected, and Meng Qi could only smile. Amitabha and the celestial venerable of morals had seen through the changes and did not hesitate to descend to break the formation, or did they have a tacit understanding with the Bodhi ancient Buddha?</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Streaks of pitch-black lightning tore through the layers of the nine remoteness, bringing with them the destruction of the void and the condensation of demonic qi. The sturdy and towering mountains and the rigid and boundless land all rolled up like soft towels and squirmed crazily, it was as if they were digesting something or being digested.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Black and red engulfed the layers of the nine remoteness, dissolving the origin of life and death, Luo Feng’s black prison, the Netherworld Sea’s demonic pool, and other places that were close to the Dao or remnants of the ruins!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Eyes appeared out of thin air in different parts of nine remoteness. They were either evil, cold, mad, or cruel. All of them were rotating the reverse ten thousand character Talisman, looking down on all the living beings in this world.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>An illusory river of time appeared, flowing through nine remoteness. It passed through countless years in the past and was gradually dyed in red and black.</p><p>Red and black spread rapidly. They flowed upstream, assimilating modern times, controlling the Middle Ages, and covering the ancient times. It was all the way until the beginning of the new age when clear and turbid air descended, and nine remoteness was born.</p><p>After the birth of the nine underworld, the turbid qi settled and condensed, connecting with the Great Dao, forming a place that was close to the Great Dao, giving birth to the first batch of Evil Gods and ghosts born from the “Dao”.</p><p>In the depths of the black prison, there was ice, dark green, and decay. There were ghosts growing inside, breathing in turbid qi, and breathing in and out of time. It was the first ghost of this era, Ghost Emperor Xuanming!</p><p>He had already traced back to this point. Before he was born, he was already on the false shore. At the current node, he was in a fierce battle with the Black Heaven Emperor, covering all parts of history. Even at the beginning of the nine underworld, one could still see the dying and doomsday-like waves and the cold and silent Ghost Dance.</p><p>At this moment, the red and black colors that were dyed by the river of time suddenly stirred up a violent whirlpool, disturbing the time of the netherworld. A finger that was full of depravity and madness reached out and pointed at Ghost Emperor Xuanming, who was in the dark green ice.</p><p>The reverse ten thousand characters formed on the tip of the finger, transforming into layers of demon shadows, and performing the third move of the Tathagata reverse palm together:</p><p>“Saint Forsaken Wisdom!”</p><p>At the current node, in different places in the long river of history, Ghost Emperor Xuanming sensed the danger of his own body. He attacked crazily without caring about his life and death, trying to avoid the Black Heaven Emperor. However, his understanding was too late. The palm of “Absolute saint forgives Wisdom”hit.., layers of barriers disappeared, and even his thoughts became blurry. He was pointed at the center of his brows by that finger.</p><p>The green jade at the tip of his finger gathered and turned into an ancient and gentle bodhi seed. It drilled into Ghost Emperor Xuanming’s body and rapidly pulled out branches and leaves. It absorbed the spiritual light of his nature and shone with a new light of wisdom.</p><p>“No…”Ghost Emperor Xuanming screamed miserably at the current node. He looked up at the sky and cried out, but everything came to an abrupt stop. He had been “Someone else”since the beginning of his life, and then he had experienced eternal corruption and perfection, until “Today.”.</p><p>When he lowered his head, his eyes had lost the color of the past and became dignified and lofty, just like Emperor Fengdu back then.</p><p>Both of them were ghost emperors, and they were different lords of the Netherworld!</p><p>“Congratulations on your ‘return’, fellow Daoist.”Black Heaven Emperor smiled slightly.</p><p>Ghost Emperor Xuanming nodded slightly. “Greetings, fellow Daoist!”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Netherworld began to turn transparent, and an unimaginably huge mouth appeared at the bottom. With the reverse ten thousand-word Buddha as its teeth, it gnawed and chewed on this world, seemingly slowly but actually quickly pulling it into its mouth.</p><p>At this moment, the three “False shores”that the demon Buddha had separated from earlier gathered together and returned to their lumps of flesh and blood, throwing them into the huge mouth.</p><p>Seeing this, not only did the Monkey Heaven Grand Sage and the seven kills Daoist escape from the nine netherworld, even the demon lord, the Black Heaven Monarch, and the Xuanming Ghost Emperor, who had submitted to ananda, left without hesitation. Yang Jian, the nine chaos heavenly venerate, and the other evil demons followed closely behind.</p><p>If they remained in the nine Netherworlds, they would be refined by the combination of the demon and Buddha!</p><p>Kacha. The sound of shattering rang out as the nine Netherworlds was pulled completely into that evil and demonic mouth. The heavens and earth darkened as if something bad was about to happen.</p><p>Inside the celestial eradication sword formation, Daoist Taiqing, Daoist Shangqing, Amitabha, and Amitabha each suppressed a sword formation, the heavenly venerate of virtue, Daoist Yuqing, Amitabha, and the green emperor barged into the eye of the formation. They saw old mother Wusheng holding the plain-colored cloud realm flag and the heaven-destroying axe floating in front of him. The back of his head was as bright and clear as the bright moon, the clear light scattered down, covering his face.</p><p>Seeing the four other shores arrive, he suddenly bowed calmly. He escaped from the eye of the formation and returned to his home in the vacuum. He did not hesitate at all.</p><p>Without a sound, the immortal slaying sword formation disintegrated. The four immortal swords turned into red, green, black, and white light, dancing in the air.</p><p>Amitabha put his hands together and chanted in a low voice, “Mercy.”The red and black light converged and turned into an ancient sword, falling into his palm. The heavenly venerate of morals threw out a bright and shining circle to trap the green immortal slaying sword, then, he waved his robe and put away the formation diagram filled with the will of eradication.</p><p>The white light tried to escape, but it was entangled by the purple gas and held by the Green Emperor. The sword light cut off the future and connected countless eras in the past. The dao patterns turned into different shapes with the same meaning:</p><p>“Kill Immortal!”</p><p>..</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The nine Netherworld disappeared, and the huge mouth formed by the reverse ten thousand characters turned into a vortex. Red and black alternated and intertwined into one. Then, the center of the mouth twitched and quickly turned into the smiling demon Buddha Ananda.</p><p>The aura of the demon Buddha Ananda was obscure and ancient, like the most ancient evil demon that had existed since the beginning of time. The figures were numerous, as if they were connected to countless eras, bringing about the merging of the long river of time and branches.</p><p>He looked at Meng Qi in the hollow jade temple and smiled slightly. He spat out the mouth, and the Black Waterfall flew up and gave birth to a new netherworld, a part of the demon Buddha. Evil demons and devils took shape once again, this included the asura primogenitor and other transportation and good fortune!</p><p>At this moment, he saw a green-gold Buddha fly into the hollow jade temple. It was transparent, indestructible, indestructible, and exceptionally powerful.</p><p>“Saint Buddha…”the eyes of the Devil Buddha darkened and became cold.</p><p>The Supreme True Buddha who had just gotten rid of true determination tathagata and Zhundi Daoist’s eyes were filled with greed and hatred.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
