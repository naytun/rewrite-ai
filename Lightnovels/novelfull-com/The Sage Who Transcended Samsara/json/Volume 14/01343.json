They were full of pressure and solemnity. Under his feet, the raging sea was surging. One fierce but dark whirlpool after another appeared, dragging him down from afar… Ji Xing looked around in a daze, he didn’t understand why he suddenly found himself in the extreme south of the East China Sea. He had an inexplicable sense of fear. A great disaster was at hand, and it was impossible for him to escape.</p><p>Crash!</p><p>Accompanied by a loud boom, the waves surged more than a thousand feet and almost swallowed Ji Xing. His gaze was fixed, and he saw that the seabed was collapsing layer by layer, as if it was beginning to completely disintegrate, countless deep-sea objects were turned into corpses without any resistance, and the corpses were immediately turned into ashes.</p><p>This kind of destruction spread in all directions, as if it was going to affect the entire real world. A dense black aura pervaded the air, and in the darkness, there were many evil things that could make one’s scalp tingle.</p><p>“This is the end of the era that Luo Jiao has proclaimed, the end of the World?”This thought suddenly appeared in Ji Xing’s mind, and he felt even more terrified.</p><p>At this moment, he discovered that he had two things that he had never seen before in his hands. In his left hand was an ordinary wooden box, floating lightly as if it did not contain anything, and in his right hand was an ancient stone tablet that was half the height of a person, there were four ancient seal characters, “Jade Void Su Meng”.</p><p>“Jade Void Su Meng, isn’t this Grandmaster’s name?”Ji Xing seemed to have remembered something. With a flash of inspiration, he threw the stone tablet and the ordinary wooden box towards the raging sea.</p><p>The two things sank into the sea. The wind and waves immediately calmed down. The layers of collapse at the bottom of the sea were also restrained. It became gentler and the apocalyptic scene became empty.</p><p>“It’s Really Useful!”After the suppression was removed, Ji Xing’s body was filled with ecstasy, and he couldn’t help but shout.</p><p>With this shout, he suddenly woke up. Everything he had seen just now had faded away, and what he saw was a simple environment in the straw hut. His master was sitting cross-legged, breathing in and out the first wisp of purple gas in the morning.</p><p>At this time, the memories from before slowly returned to Ji Xing’s mind. After paying respects to the founding master, the Celestial Master of Primordial beginning, and the founding master, the Celestial Master of Primordial Emperor, Yesterday, he had officially entered the gate wall, when he learned that the unknown cultivation technique he had cultivated in the past was derived from the general principles of the ‘seven heaven-severing swords’, he was truly overjoyed. Thus, he stayed here and sought guidance from his master. He only began meditating in the middle of the night. Who would have thought that he would have a nightmare!</p><p>After entering the exterior, I rarely even have a normal dream, let alone a nightmare… Ji Xing frowned slightly. His heart was filled with doubt as he looked around casually.</p><p>Suddenly, his gaze turned cold as he saw an ordinary wooden box placed in front of Grandmaster Yuan’s statue. Below it, there was a stone tablet that was half the height of a person. It exuded an ancient aura.</p><p>These two things really existed… Ji Xing was shocked and instinctively looked at his master he mu. However, he saw that his eyes were half open and he was still focused on cultivation. He was completely unaware of what was happening in the outside world.</p><p>Confusion, anticipation, shock, all sorts of emotions were mixed together. Ji Xing carefully leaned over and reached out to touch the stone tablet that was half the height of a person. It was different from what he had seen in his dream. There were no seal characters on it.</p><p>Just as he touched it, the stone tablet suddenly shrank and turned into the size of a palm. It fell into Ji Xing’s hand, and the ordinary wooden box also slid down.</p><p>Ji Xing caught the wooden box and had a guess in his heart:</p><p>“Could it be that Grandmaster entered the dream to borrow some points? He wants me to throw these two things into the southernmost part of the East China Sea?”</p><p>“That place seems to be the weakest point of the real world. Where will the erosion of the nine serenities and the arrival of the end of the world begin?”</p><p>As his thoughts fluctuated, Ji Xing hid the two things well. When his master he mu finished breathing, he probed a few times. Seeing that he mu did not know anything, he hid the matter and continued to receive guidance.</p><p>After half a month, Ji Xing left the island with his friends. Then, he found an excuse to leave the team and quietly went south, heading toward the southernmost part of the East China Sea that he had seen in his dream.</p><p>After teleporting and flying, the sea appeared in front of Ji Xing’s eyes. The sky was blue, there were no clouds, and the sky was clear. There were no dark clouds that he had expected. The surface of the sea rose and fell slowly, and the fish jumped on the boat, it did not look like the world had collapsed or the end of the world had come.</p><p>Ji Xing frowned as he looked at this scene. He thought for a long time but had no clue. In the end, he decided not to care about anything else and just sank the two things into the bottom of the sea.</p><p>He took out the stone tablet and saw that there were no words on it. Ji Xing thought for a while, then reached out his finger and tried to write.</p><p>It was cold to the touch. His finger drilled into it. Ji Xing flew like a dragon and danced like a phoenix. He wrote the four ancient seal characters, “Yu Xu Su Meng.”Then he threw it and the ordinary wooden box into the sea and watched them rise and fall.</p><p>Nothing happened. Ji Xing waited for a long time before he finally shook his head and left.</p><p>Just as his figure disappeared into the sea, a tornado appeared in the air. A furry hand reached out and grabbed the ordinary wooden box.</p><p>It was the nine spirits original saint!</p><p>When it was guarding the nine underworld, it had received some news from Meng Qi. Today, it took the wooden box and handed it to the Azure Emperor!</p><p>The wooden box was not made of special materials. The situation inside had already appeared in the mind of the nine spirits original saint. There was nothing inside. It was empty!</p><p>What kind of hint was this? While the nine spirits original saint was trying to figure out the meaning of the simple wooden box, he took a deep look at the stone tablet that had sunk to the bottom of the sea. His figure flashed and he returned to the Fusang ancient tree realm to see Emperor Qing.</p><p>Emperor Qing took the wooden box and opened the lid, revealing the emptiness inside.</p><p>At this moment, as the aura of the Fusang ancient tree spread in, the emptiness suddenly shook, creating ripples. It was as if an unformed illusory fruit had appeared, but there was nothing inside.</p><p>“Something out of nothing…”nine spirits original saint’s eyes darkened, and this thought suddenly appeared in his mind.</p><p>..</p><p>Meng Qi sat upright on the top of the pitch-black mountain peak in the netherworld. From time to time, he would attract creatures that had accidentally entered the Netherworld and ask them to send one green jade box after another to the Fusang ancient tree realm.</p><p>Of course, none of them were able to successfully send them over. They only stirred up a series of battles between the various factions’great divine arts practitioners.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, he suddenly opened his eyes, which had been tightly shut the entire time. His eyes were dark and gloomy, as if they contained everything. Even time was no exception.</p><p>At that moment, a flame suddenly rose in Tusi Palace. A box carved out of Suet Jade fell into the nether world from thirty-three heavens and landed in front of Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi caught the jade box and slowly opened it. A flag that looked like a banner, but was not a banner, and a flag that looked like an axe, but was not an axe, appeared in front of Meng Qi’s eyes. It was suffused with traces of innate chaotic energy, making it seem heavy and yet strangely illusory, the names of the two original root-like dao patterns were written:</p><p>“Pangu!”</p><p>Pangu banner!</p><p>The most powerful divine weapon of the primeval Lord of Heaven!</p><p>However, what Meng Qi was looking at was only the evolution of an Unreal Great Dao. It was not the real one, but it was as ancient as the real one.</p><p>Was this the ‘heaven-cleaving fruit’that the primeval lord of Heaven had slashed out? Just like the ‘Dao one seal’from before? Did he give it to me only today because he was worried that I would refuse it and refuse to take the responsibility? Meng Qi’s gaze was deep and unwavering. He reached out his right hand, grabbed the Pangu banner, and activated the limitless seal.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, perhaps three to five years, the Pangu banner had disappeared. Meng Qi gave off an increasingly ethereal feeling.</p><p>He slowly stood up and suddenly looked out of the netherworld. He looked at the Netherworld, his home in the vacuum, and saw the bright moon.</p><p>Their eyes met, and the void outside the Netherworld suddenly boiled and then returned to chaos.</p><p>The debt from yesterday was coming for him today!</p><p>A saber and a sword appeared behind Meng Qi’s back. The Saber was the Overlord’s Ultimate Saber, and the sword was the sword of the human emperor. The two crossed each other, and purple light and light gold danced together.</p><p>He shut his mouth tightly, and his expression was indifferent. With the Saber and the sword on his back, he walked out of the Netherworld step by step. He did not seem to hide anything about his actions. He wanted to get out of the Sea of pain openly, but he did not wait for the opportunity for Maitreya to attack the other shore.</p><p>As for whether Maitreya would seize this opportunity, that was another matter.</p><p>Numerous lofty and unfathomable gazes were focused on the Dou Shuai Palace, the demon Emperor Palace, the Elysium Realm, the Bodhi Pure Land, the vacuum hometown, the peak of Mount Ling, and the Fusang Ancient Tree realm.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
