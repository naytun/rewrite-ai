He wished that he could take action personally. However, the aftershocks on the other side were truly terrifying, and the nine serenities had greatly weakened him. He could only watch patiently from the side, watching the development.</p><p>At this moment, seeing the black mystic water flood like a flood, “Drowning”the world, his heart suddenly thumped, and he had a bad premonition.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, if you don’t act now, it will be too late to repent,”said a Nan’s phantom next to him with a smile.</p><p>Burning Lamp’s gaze suddenly turned to him. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, didn’t you see that the demon lord and seven kills failed to stop nine chaos and that he obtained the Demon Emperor’s Claw? “As long as you have some time and control this thing, regardless of realm or strength, he will receive a certain increase. and the will of the Netherworld repels mother Wusheng. When that time comes, he who is affected will definitely act. With the monkey and the absolute saber, the Golden Emperor will definitely not be able to enter the Netherworld.”A Nan seemed to be talking about something as light as the clouds and the wind.</p><p>Burning Lamp’s expression did not change. He was still compassionate and compassionate. “Nine messes controlled the Devil Emperor’s claw. Mother Wusheng, who took out the heavenly punishment axe, had ample time to defeat the Buddha and make it difficult for him to protect Su Meng.”</p><p>Ah Nan chuckled. “Zhenwu was once a dao master’s child. He knew too much and grasped too much. No other side was willing to let him become the other side. He soared into the sky and messed up the situation. At this time, do you think Mother Wusheng should eliminate her own hidden danger first or stop Zhenwu First?”</p><p>“Isn’t there still Emperor Qing?”Burning lamp closed his eyes slightly.</p><p>“Emperor Qing has always been leaning toward Su Meng. If it wasn’t for the Karma with the gold emperor, he would have already intervened and stopped it. Under the situation where he was restrained and restrained, it would be a good idea to sit back and watch Zhenwu Achieve Dao. After all, Zhenwu also had a close relationship with Su Meng. I know this, the Gold Emperor knows it, and Zhenwu himself knows it too. The timing is just right,”Ah Nan spoke with confidence, a lotus flower blossomed out of his tongue. “With the green emperor watching, would those at the perfect destiny realm dare to interfere?”</p><p>The two of them were communicating through their wills, and their thoughts echoed in the void. The conversation just now only took a moment or two.</p><p>Burning lamp fell into deep thought, and then he said in a low voice, “How should I Act?”</p><p>At this time, a figure appeared in the black mystic water that had “Submerged”the world. The figure had a thin face and an ancient Daoist robe. It was the true martial art of the demon-slaying heavenly venerate. As soon as the figure appeared, the mystic water on the left and right sides suddenly changed, and half of it was clear and quiet, it irrigated everything and gave birth to life. The other half was deep and quiet. It submerged everything and gave off an aura of death. The two spun quickly and intertwined with each other. In an instant, they absorbed everything in the world and formed the form of the Black Tortoise and the soaring serpent, they continued to curl up to form a fruit. However, the Fusang ancient tree realm and the Dongfang glazed pure land did not move at all. The green emperor fruit really chose to sit and watch!</p><p>Facing the problem of burning lamp, Ananda smiled:</p><p>“Go to the Spiritual Mountain and help me get out!”</p><p>“If I get out and join hands with old mother, wouldn’t Su Meng be easy to capture?”</p><p>Burning lamp was shocked and blurted out,</p><p>“The Green Emperor Won’t just watch. What can you do?”</p><p>He was already tempted!</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>At this time, a strange sound suddenly came from the heaven and earth. Countless Yin ghosts traveled in the night, and each living being’s lifespan increased. The abstract concepts of life and death seemed to have descended into the real world.</p><p>The true martial arts had almost been assimilated by the Dao in the past, and at the critical moment, it triggered the origin of life and death!</p><p>Black and white intersected, and life and death circulated. The Black Tortoise and the soaring serpent were guided, and a half-formed illusory fruit grew on the rolling black water. It seemed to be crystal clear, but it actually contained many dao charms such as water, life, death, and destruction.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Ah Nan was about to answer the burning lamp’s question, but he saw the Golden Emperor’s hand, which had been stagnant just now, holding a huge axe. Without hesitation, he hacked toward the nine nether regions, toward the Monkey King!</p><p>He actually did not care about the attainment of true martial arts!</p><p>Nine dao patterns flew out, “Burn,””Devour,””Kill,””Destroy,”and so on. They complemented Wusheng’s will and ultimate destination!</p><p>“This…”the sudden change stunned burning lamp.</p><p>Ah nan sighed calmly, “Mother Wusheng is very determined to kill Su Meng and Gu Xiaosang.”</p><p>“Didn’t you say that he wanted to stop Zhenwu from attaining Dao?”A rare look of confusion appeared in burning lamp’s eyes.</p><p>“If it were me, I would do the same. Attaining Dao through Zhenwu is a headache for everyone. If Gu Xiaosang doesn’t get rid of her own hidden danger, why must she sacrifice herself to help everyone?”Ah Nan answered with a smile, “More importantly, even if there are no obstructers, the other shore is also extremely difficult. Whether Zhenwu can succeed or not is still uncertain.”</p><p>Burning Lamp’s gaze was deep as he looked at Ananda. “You didn’t advise me like that just now.”</p><p>“Of course, I have to choose a statement that is beneficial to myself,”Ananda said matter-of-factly.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The blade and axe clashed, and an earth-shattering explosion occurred on the highest level of the nine nether world. Purple Lightning and Red Flames flew out at the same time. The Darkness was one color, and the earth split into countless small pieces that floated in the dark void as if they were drifting on the sea, even the red mountain range had been broken into two. If it weren’t for the unfettered emperor, the twelve demon saints, and the forbidden spell that they had set up over the years, they would probably have been turned into ashes. This was even before the fight just now.</p><p>The dark violent ape’s feet sank into the space-time fog that separated the two layers. The golden chain armor that was stained with filth turned into butterflies. Its body was badly damaged, and its flesh and blood squirmed and regenerated rapidly. It was at an absolute disadvantage, seeing that it could barely protect itself after a few attacks, it was no longer able to protect Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang!</p><p>The Gold Emperor’s killing intent was stronger than a rock.</p><p>His white and slender palm reached out again, still holding the huge and disproportionate heaven’s punishment axe. On the other side, the nine Chaos Celestial Master took the Devil Emperor’s claw and poured his will into it, forcibly breaking through layers of obstacles in order to gain control, the Devil Lord and Daoist seven kills attacked repeatedly, but they were unable to harm him, who was temporarily in the past. Seeing that things could not be reconciled, the two of them had already decided to retreat. After all, when nine Chaos Celestial Master took control of the Devil Emperor’s Claw, he would not be able to leave even if he wanted to!</p><p>At the same time, the semi-formed illusory dao fruit appeared. An ancient and unadorned purple jade ruler flew out from the true martial Niwan Palace. It was invulnerable to all evil, unbreakable by all magic, and possessed innate virtue.</p><p>As soon as the Yuanyang ruler appeared, the dao patterns on it became prominent. The figure became slightly transparent and illusory, as if it had fallen into the long river of time.</p><p>Then, it rolled up the Zhenwu and carried it upstream!</p><p>From the current to the hidden place, from the hidden place to the point of departure from the origin of life and death, from the origin of life and death to sitting inside for many years, it continuously awakened and merged into one.</p><p>With another chop of the Axe, the Monkey King roared. He didn’t run away because he was at an absolute disadvantage. He waved his sword and went up to meet the difficulties, just like how he would wreak havoc in the Heaven Palace even if there was no hope in the past!</p><p>The Dark Ape rose into the air, covered with purple clouds, and rushed to the white and beautiful palm. The seemingly huge figure was getting smaller and smaller.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang, on the other hand, had been murmuring the eight-character motto of the green emperor since the beginning, “There is no way out, there is no way out… there is no way out, there is no way out… there is no way out in heaven, there is no door in the earth, the hidden meaning of no way out should be no way out, but there is a door, that is to enter the earth, that is to enter the ninth underworld, and there is no way out, what is the meaning of no life? “Then what does ten deaths mean?”</p><p>Thinking of this, she suddenly raised her head and looked at Meng Qi in front of her. She seemed to have understood something and whispered to herself,</p><p>“Ten deaths means all deaths? At the moment, it’s only us, husband and wife. He’s close to death, and I’m still alive… so that’s what Emperor Qing means…”</p><p>There seemed to be bright stars flashing in the depths of Gu Xiaosang’s eyes. The image of Meng Qi swallowing the flesh of Donghuang without hesitation was still vivid in her mind. If I die, you protect Xiaosang… If I turn into a monster, wait for you to reach the other shore.., then Wake Me Up… she pondered for a moment, then suddenly made a move and pointed a finger between Meng Qi’s eyebrows!</p><p>Meng Qi roared angrily, and his dark red and chaotic eyes revealed a hint of disbelief and grief. A crazy aura was about to erupt.</p><p>“Trust me.”Gu Xiaosang’s lips curled up. Her dimples were shallow, and her eyes were rolling. She said with a faint smile, “Don’t Tell Me You Only Trust me after I’ve saved my husband a hundred or a thousand times?”</p><p>Meng Qi immediately calmed down, and his dark red eyes fixed on Gu Xiaosang. Donghuang’s flesh and blood resisted the absorption of the lifeless finger. However, Gu Xiaosang had already separated a trace of the Demonic Blood Peach’s aura from her fingertips.</p><p>The flesh and blood surged over, and the boundless chaotic will also turned into an undercurrent and rushed toward Gu Xiaosang.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s aura soared, and dark red spots appeared in her eyes. They were demonic and beautiful, and she felt as if she was expanding like a balloon and was about to explode.</p><p>At this moment, the perfect moon hanging in the sky above the ninth underworld suddenly shook. It changed from the full moon to the waning moon. It flickered back and forth and was quite unstable. The Heavenly Punishment Axe that was chopped down had undoubtedly become slow and weak!</p><p>The stronger Gu Xiaosang was, the weaker the metal sovereign was!</p><p>Even if her current strength was not enough to weaken the metal sovereign by a lot, and even if she could reach the other side, she might not be stronger than the other party. However, a little influence at the critical moment was enough to turn the tide of the battle!</p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s black hair flew in the wind as she looked up into the sky. It was as if she had passed through the aftermath of the other side and saw the pair of eyes that had been afraid for many years.</p><p>When facing the other side, no matter how many arrangements were made, they might not be effective. It was nice to say that a plan would move, but often it would not be effective.</p><p>At this moment, there was no other way but to fight to the death!</p><p>This was a sure death!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
