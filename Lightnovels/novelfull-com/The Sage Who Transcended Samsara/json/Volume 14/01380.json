The river of time calmed down and flowed slowly. The restraint and backlash were as normal as before.</p><p>The majestic figure of the Heavenly Emperor and the dark and deep hall disintegrated layer by layer. Like a dream, they disappeared before tan ping and water ancestor’s eyes.</p><p>However, before Tan Ping could catch his breath and wake up water ancestor a few more times, everything around him was hazy, dark and boundless, and nothing else could be seen.</p><p>He suddenly woke up and found himself leaning against the yellow millet pillow, lying in a courtyard on Changmen Island. The previous experience and the soul-stirring scene just now were like a deep dream, seemingly real but not real.</p><p>“Brother Tan, which era have you returned to this time?”Xia Xiu asked curiously when she saw Tan Ping’s frightened look.</p><p>Just when Tan Ping calmed his mind and was about to answer, the dim yellow-millet pillow suddenly cracked open and turned into pieces of flying catkins. Like butterflies filling the air, it quickly disappeared into thin air.</p><p>“The yellow-millet pillow is broken!”A series of exclamations sounded, filled with thick frustration and disappointment.</p><p>Tan Ping had a similar feeling, but he could not help but feel a little happy despite the shock and disappointment. The golden millet pillow was broken, and he could no longer return to the past. It could be considered as being clear of karma with the person from the hollow jade temple or the other side who had pretended to be him, he did not have to constantly worry about being involved in the schemes and struggles between the other side, dying without a complete corpse, or even being unable to resurrect!</p><p>The golden millet pillow was both an opportunity and a burden!</p><p>Xia Xiu and the others were too far apart on this point. They were ignorant and it was difficult for them to understand. However, Tan Ping was deeply moved. This act of ascending to godhood was the most important!</p><p>Taking a light breath, tan ping looked around, clapped his hands, and smiled. “Well broken, well broken. An opportunity can be obtained but not for long. You can rely on it but not rely on it. The most important thing is still your own cultivation.”</p><p>Xia Xiu was enlightened, she said with a mixture of disappointment and emotion, “That’s right. If you always rely on the yellow millet pillow to grow, if you encounter today’s incident in the future, the consequences will be unimaginable. The road of martial arts has different stages, and different stages have different opportunities. If you rely on your own efforts to connect them, you don’t have to feel too regretful about losing the yellow millet pillow…”</p><p>The other friends also sighed and thought about how they had each gained something from relying on the golden millet pillow over the years. Their cultivation progress was extremely fast, and they were barely able to alleviate the regret and depression.</p><p>“Big Brother Tan, you didn’t gain anything this time?”After everyone calmed down, Xia Xiu looked at Tan Ping a few times and asked doubtfully.</p><p>Tan Ping smiled slightly and said, “This time, when I returned to ascend to godhood, I learned some divine abilities. It can be considered as a harvest.”</p><p>In the future, he could use the inherited divine abilities in the secret treasure of the water ancestor openly!</p><p>As for the real harvest, he could return to the past, see his past self, and speak to awaken him. was such a harvest not big enough? This was a fortuitous encounter that many great divine ability creator dreamed of!</p><p>After a short exchange, Tan Ping looked at everyone and said, “The golden millet is shattered. What plans do you all have? Do you all want to continue staying on Changmen Island, or head to another place in the East Sea to look for other opportunities?”</p><p>“I’m preparing to join the Great Zhou,”Xia Xiu answered without hesitation. “The human emperor has announced to the entire territory that he is seeking talents. He is going to conquer the sea area where three clouds island is located. Once he has the merit of occupying an island, he will be able to share the power of humanity.”</p><p>Tan Ping had not paid enough attention to the human emperor recently. When he heard Xia Xiu’s words, he was stunned. An idea suddenly popped up in his mind. Another prelude to becoming a god?</p><p>The Eastern Sea was vast. At the end of it, there were twenty-eight worlds in the Seven Seas. There was no lack of people who were waiting to be sold or opposed to viewing it from a higher vantage point. One of them was represented by three clouds island.</p><p>Back when consort three clouds was resurrected, she had Meng Qi’s help. Therefore, they had always received a lot of rewards. However, the entire matter still relied on the guidance and planning of the “Heavenly Lord of Numinous Treasure”. Since the end of the ancient era.., the “Heavenly Lord of Numinous Treasure”had already been played by the Gold Emperor. In other words, the gold emperor had given them the greatest favor of being resurrected.</p><p>Therefore, after the truth was exposed, the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure chose to sit on the sidelines and quietly live in the heavenly realm created by the sea-pacifying pearl. Consort three firmament recruited part of the Numinous Treasure Orthodoxy to help the gold emperor delay the progress of unifying the East Sea.</p><p>At this point, the war between the two sides was on the verge of breaking out!</p><p>Under the premise that there were no signs of the people on the other side personally taking action, it was a good idea to recruit experts under the situation where there were many islands and the ocean was scattered. They would fight steadily and press forward step by step.</p><p>Seeing that Tan Ping was silent, Xia Xiu asked, “Brother Tan, do you want to join?”</p><p>Join this war together? Tan Ping immediately fell into a state of hesitation.</p><p>Although this matter seemed to be something he could participate in, there was a high possibility that it would turn into a fight between the big shots on the other shore. When that time came, no one would pay attention to the deaths of a bunch of ants!</p><p>However, how could he possibly escape from everything in the Apocalypse? He would always be forced into a situation where he had no choice but to face the apocalypse. Moreover, if he wanted to grow, he would have to temper himself. If he were to escape from this, he would also escape from it. Then, he would lose the meaning of reincarnating and re-cultivating!</p><p>He was silent for a long time. Then, he slowly nodded and said, “Alright!”</p><p>..</p><p>Inside the hollow jade temple, lanterns and streamers were placed. The wedding between he mu and Jiu Li was being carried out grandly.</p><p>Guang Chengzi, Wen Shu, the heavenly venerate guangfa, the jade tripod master, and other powerful cultivators from the hollow jade sect brought their disciples to congratulate him, they discussed dao with the demon ox king, the demon Flood Dragon King, the demon Roc King, the Little Fox Qing Qiu, the Peacock Tai Li, the Phoenix Radiance, and the other great demon saints and saints. They turned the wedding into a stage for the upper echelons of the two great powers to drink and have fun.</p><p>When the auspicious time arrived, the clear Jade Palace opened up. Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang sat on the cloud bed. Behind their heads hung a clear and Perfect Circle of light. Around them floated a golden lamp and a jade bracelet.</p><p>The atmosphere immediately became solemn and solemn. Under the gaze of the guests, he mu and Jiuli entered together. They kowtowed every three steps and bowed every nine steps to thank the headmaster for his kindness.</p><p>In the crowd, there was someone who was not looking at them. Nezha’s eyes were burning with fire as he stared fixedly at Bull Demon King.</p><p>After his many years of investigation and pursuit, he finally confirmed that the main culprit behind the “Chaotic lands of demons”era that severely injured his master, the Taiyi holy man, and made it difficult for him to break through at the end of the antiquity age, was demon ox, it was the “Ping Tian Grand Sage”, Demon Ox!</p><p>As a destiny, Demon ox could sense Nezha’s gaze. He thought to himself, the relationship between the hollow jade temple and the demons was inevitable. What kind of trouble could nezha cause?</p><p>Moreover, the main reason why Daoist Taiyi died in meditation was because of himself. Whether or not he was severely injured, it would not change the outcome of his difficult breakthrough. Otherwise, with the temperament of the sect master of the Jade Void Palace, heavenly venerate Su, he would have long gone back in time, he would stop this matter and resurrect Daoist Taiyi!</p><p>The wedding continued, and the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves to the fullest.</p><p>The hustle and bustle eventually dispersed. Streaks of light left the jade void palace one after another. Nezha was filled with resentment and resentment. He returned to his own cave abode, held his spear on his knees, and gnashed his teeth.</p><p>Suddenly, a green light seemed to flash in his mind. An illusion appeared in his mind. The Bodhi was swaying, and it sprinkled down in peace. Han Guang, who was wearing a wide robe and wide sleeves, stood under a branch, holding a wonderful tree in his hand.</p><p>“What do you want to Do?”Nezha narrowed his eyes and asked.</p><p>Han Guang smiled leisurely and said,</p><p>“I’ll give you a chance, but I won’t let you do anything in return. Because you know what kind of chance it is, and you know the consequences of seizing it.”</p><p>Nezha sat up straight.</p><p>..</p><p>After leaving the Jade Void Palace of Kunlun’s field, Bull Demon King did not return to the demon race. Instead, he appeared in a flash and transformed into a tall, green-robed man. He landed on an island somewhere in the East China Sea.</p><p>He was a womanizer by nature. After being suppressed in Mount Lingshan for all eternity, Princess Iron Fan and the other original wives and concubines had already passed away. Therefore, it took him a while to find someone he was satisfied with.</p><p>The island was remote, and the strange flowers were in full bloom, giving off a strange fragrance. Bull Demon King landed in front of the cave abode and opened the door without knocking. He entered the bedroom and saw a charming scene of a begonia sleeping in spring.</p><p>The beauty’s clothes were thin, and the light gauze covered her body. It was faintly discernible, and it was exceptionally attractive. Her face was ruddy and did not retreat. It was as if she was in a dream that could not be told to outsiders.</p><p>Gollum, Bull Demon King’s throat squirmed, and he swallowed a mouthful of saliva. He picked up the Teacup on the table and took a sip before he reached the bedside.</p><p>After several times of flirting, he lay down in satisfaction, and his thick arms wrapped around the beauty.</p><p>At this moment, his face suddenly changed, and he felt the power disappear into thin air. He immediately shouted sternly,</p><p>“What did you do?”</p><p>“Who are you exactly?”</p><p>The beauty smiled faintly. “I was originally a virgin sitting under Guanyin Bodhisattva. Because I read the scriptures incorrectly, I came out of my own sect and was blessed by the Celestial Emperor. I can be considered quite famous.”</p><p>“You are the joyful Bodhisattva! What does the celestial emperor want to do!”Bull demon king suddenly felt that all “Him and me”had lost their power!</p><p>“It was thanks to the Celestial Emperor’s order that the Mystic Maiden’s lineage took in my orthodoxy. Today, the Celestial Emperor has issued a decree. How could I not obey?”The Beauty’s eyes were bewitching as she said, “The cup of three-life-and-three-life-forgetting water and my beautiful woman’s Yin Seed are not abnormal even when separated. They are not dangerous, but they are beneficial. However, if you encounter them at the same time, it is inevitable that they will be temporarily taken care of by me.”</p><p>“As for the person who killed you, it was not me.”She stood up gracefully and put on a light veil. She walked to the entrance of the cave abode barefooted and stretched out her hand to open it.</p><p>Nezha stood outside with a gloomy expression.</p><p>PS: in the previous chapter, the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning and the heavenly venerate of morality only left their imprints and revised them into the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning and the heavenly venerate of Lingbao.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
