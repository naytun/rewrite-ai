After experiencing all kinds of things and constantly correcting his past mistakes, he had a feeling that he was getting closer and closer to the truth.</p><p>At this moment, after deducing from the bits and pieces of words left behind by the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning that it was very likely that the other shores had joined forces to fight the Heavenly Court for matters related to the dao fruit, some of his long-standing doubts seemed to have been explained at once.</p><p>After the Heavenly Emperor opened the highest level of the nine heavens and transcended the sea of bitterness, he reached the other side. As a genuine big shot, he had always been ambitious. It was normal for him not to want to become the puppet of the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning and the heavenly venerate of morals, to rope in the Gautama Buddha of the spiritual mountain and involve the Buddhist powers to achieve balance, to be in the middle and to be on both sides was a brilliant strategy. However, why did he end up falling out with the primordial beginning’s morals and completely sided with the Buddhist sect?</p><p>The key point was that Sun Wukong, the Monkey King, wreaked havoc in the Heavenly Palace. He was unstoppable and forced the heavenly emperor to directly ask the Gautama of Mount Numinous to suppress him. However, this seemingly simple matter had too many unimaginable aspects:</p><p>As one of the three pure ones and an ancient person on the other side of the river, the Celestial Master of morals failed to refine Sun Wukong with his pill furnace. Instead, he gave him even more tyrannical strength</p><p>Yang Jian, the true Lord Erlang, who had always shown mercy and was known to no one other than the masters of the Hollow Jade Temple, had returned to the mouth of the river</p><p>The two heavenly court generals, thunder god and mystic maiden, happened to be absent</p><p>The remaining experts, such as the star Lord and Yuan Jun, either did not make a move or could not be stopped at all. They did not have the grace of a famous person</p><p>Most importantly, the heavenly emperor was a true higan, the most powerful one among the Five Emperors. He actually avoided the skyscraping hall and requested the help of rulai from Mount Numinous. He did not dare to fight Sun Wukong, shouldn’t it be “When the heavenly emperor is angry, the demon monkey will turn into ashes”?</p><p>If he added “The thing that is related to the achievement of Dao Fruit”, everything would be connected.</p><p>The Heavenly Emperor opened the highest level of the ninth heaven and found this item by chance. He kept it a secret and pondered over it. He even refined it slowly. At the same time, he secretly arranged reincarnation and schemed against Luo Feng and black prison to build his own true Hades, as a result, his strength increased rapidly and there were signs that he was catching up to the ancient ones. His desire to break free from control was like a raging fire that had been poured oil on it. He began to come into contact with and rope in the Gautama of Mount Numinous, he used his power to conceal his true reliance.</p><p>However, how terrifying were the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning and the heavenly venerate of morality? The beginning of everything, the cause of all the effects, and the incarnation of the Great Dao were just statements and not descriptions. He vaguely found some clues and took advantage of the critical moment when the Heavenly Emperor was comprehending or refining it to release Sun Wukong, they wanted him to wreak havoc in the Heavenly Palace and force the Heavenly Emperor to make a move to find out what was going on.</p><p>Therefore, Yang Jian, True Lord Pure Source Mystic Dao, who did not listen to the instructions, returned to the mouth of the Gujiang estuary early on. Thunder God, Mystic Maiden, and Great Emperor Zhenwu were all transferred away due to other matters. Most of the remaining people who were loyal to the Dao sect either pretended not to know.., or they did not put in any effort, forcing the heavenly emperor to personally make a move.</p><p>And the heavenly emperor was likely to reveal his secret the moment he made a move. He simply steeled his heart and completely sided with the Buddhist sect, inviting Gautama of the Numinous Mountain to suppress the demon monkey. After that, the westward journey incident.., other than involving the mysteries of rulai of Lingshan to “Reduce and seek emptiness”, it was also after a few hundred years that the Heavenly Emperor and the Buddhist sect finally gained the upper hand. They began to fish and suppress and even threaten the Taoist sects in the heavenly court.., the demon camp on the Earth.</p><p>Later, for some unknown reason, the secret about the Dao fruit was leaked. Even Lu Ya knew a thing or two about it. He even asked Lu Ya to tell the legend of the green emperor that he was the “Highest level in the nine heavens”. Therefore, the other shores put aside their prejudices.., they joined hands to invade the heavenly court and almost destroyed the mythological era. In this process, the Buddha of Lingshan, who was still unknown at that time, benefited the most. Or rather, he used this to break the obsession, put down the shackles, and completely became nothing, it did not take long for Lingshan to be reborn and obtain the dao fruit. This was also one of the supporting evidence for Meng Qi’s guess.</p><p>As for the culprit behind the leak of the secret, the word “Thunder god”immediately appeared in Meng Qi’s mind. The seemingly honest ‘he’had already colluded with the Devil Lord Long before the other shores joined hands to invade the heavenly court. It could even be said that.., the Devil Lord’s invasion of the immortal world was a prelude to the fall of the heavenly court by the ancient people.</p><p>This could also explain why the Devil Lord could not wait to rebel against the immortal world and fight the heavenly emperor to the death. It was because that “Thing”was too precious and important, and he had the thunder god as an undercover agent, the two heavenly venerables, primordial beginning and moral, would even help to stop the Buddhist forces so that they could observe the changes and have a good chance of success.</p><p>If they did not act now, the heavenly emperor might have completely digested the gains!</p><p>Who knew that at the critical moment, Yuan Shi and Dao De managed to stop the great enemies like Buddha Lingshan and Amitabha. The Thunder God, who was supposed to make a fatal betrayal, came too late, too late, too late..</p><p>Hence, the heavenly emperor risked serious injuries and killed the demon lord at the heavenly court boundary stone, his body scattered across the myriad worlds.</p><p>On further thought, the Devil Master’s arrival on the other side was a little sudden, and it was very likely that he received benefits from the thunder god, based on the benefits of that “Thing”– he, who stood out from the evil devil, would definitely not believe in empty words!</p><p>But all of this had a prerequisite. The Celestial Emperor actually let the Thunder God know such an important secret and did not silence him. This was either really an “Absolute trust”, or the thunder god was extremely familiar with the highest level of the ninth heaven and had hidden means, he was actually able to deceive the heavenly emperor and spy on and come into contact with that “Thing”.</p><p>As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Meng Qi heard Liu Luo Sigh:</p><p>“It’s very likely… no wonder the Azure Emperor took the lead…”</p><p>However, such a “Thing”had probably already been taken away by some big shot during the Falling Battle of the Heavenly Court. Even if there was leftover soup, there was still the Azure Emperor in front of him. It seemed meaningless for him to wait for the great divine arts practitioner to rush over.</p><p>..</p><p>The ancient tomb was deep and dark. The dome seemed to hold up a curtain of sky. The stars twinkled, and a great power kept adding to it.</p><p>“Tai Yi (Taiyi) !”</p><p>A crazy and vague roar came from the depths of the ancient tomb. It seemed to be able to directly shake the spiritual light of everyone’s nature, which lived at an infinite height. It was tainted and dragged into the chaotic and terrifying abyss.</p><p>The tokens engraved with “Wanxiang”, “Ice and snow”and other bright jade characters circled around, faintly communicating with the molts in the nine ancient tombs and borrowing the power of Heaven and earth, under the guidance of Luo Shu, who was constantly evolving and changing the black and white light spots, a small-sized forbidden spell was formed here. This allowed Wang Siyuan to withstand the faint roar of the monster.</p><p>Even so, Wang Siyuan still felt that all his acupuncture points were numb, as if there was a cold light that was about to drill out. His head felt a little dizzy, and his Yi Dao true body was like an illusory qi, shaking and rippling.</p><p>The smile on Wang Siyuan’s face did not diminish, and the terrifying madness in his eyes became more and more obvious. After taking another nine steps forward, he suddenly spoke:</p><p>“Tai Yi?”</p><p>“What’s his name? Tai Yi?”</p><p>“Aren’t you the Eastern Emperor Tai Yi!”</p><p>The Eastern Emperor Tai Yi, one of the three supreme emperors of the immemorial era, had failed to compete with the heavenly emperor for the supreme position and had fallen!</p><p>He was still alive? Had he lived to this era? Had he been suppressed by the sacrifice of the nine venerables?</p><p>The angry roar was strangely silent for a few breaths, and then it seemed to have recovered a little bit of consciousness because of it. It shouted like a tsunami,</p><p>“I am not the emperor of the East!”</p><p>Wang Siyuan coughed and actually nodded slightly:</p><p>“That’s true. You are not worthy to be called the emperor of the east.”</p><p>Saying this, he looked over with a smile:</p><p>“You’re sheqin. You’re the founder of the Zhexiu Mountain.”</p><p>The shouting stopped again, and a faint voice of pain could be heard. It was only after a long while that he weakly shouted,</p><p>“I, I’m sheqin…”</p><p>A sickly red tide appeared on Wang Siyuan’s face. “In order to escape from the Sea of bitterness, you tried to study the traces left behind in heaven and Earth when you fell on the other shore. Who would have thought that you would touch Donghuang Taiyi, who had yet to die, and was almost possessed by him. If not for the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure sensing it and slashing his sword from afar, you would have long become Donghuang Taiyi.”</p><p>The chaotic and crazy voice became lost, and his tone became erratic as he said,</p><p>“How, how did you know?”</p><p>Madness and bitterness flashed across Wang Siyuan’s eyes. He coughed and laughed:</p><p>“Of course, cough, of course from, cough, the real Donghuang Taiyi…”</p><p>..</p><p>The Big Dipper Emperor’s steed tore through the void and continued its journey.</p><p>“Is there really a need to go there?”The mystical maiden of the nine heavens, Liu Luo, raised an objection. “How could a big shot miss out on something important?”</p><p>Judging from the chaotic time around them and the fact that they could actually see the past, the core of the highest level of the nine heavens, one of the focal points of the battle on the other shore, was about to arrive.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said, “The things that big shots don’t like are also very precious to us. Moreover, it’s very likely that we’ll meet the Azure Emperor. That way, I won’t have to worry about burning lamp and the devil Buddha using the connection between their avatars to chase after us…”</p><p>Before he could finish his words, he suddenly felt the tree of Great Dao in his sleeve tremble slightly. It seemed to have sensed something and was trying its best to break free.</p><p>With a thought, Meng Qi took out the jade-green tree covered in clear light and pointed it into the depths of the void.</p><p>In an instant, a clear light shot up into the sky from the depths of the void. The ripples were like waves that surged crazily into the void, lighting up the path.</p><p>..</p><p>Celestial Venerate Guangfa, who was flying in the boundless darkness, suddenly stopped. He turned his head to look in a certain direction and saw a beam of clear light that looked like a lighthouse in the distance!</p><p>“What happened there?”Celestial Venerate Guangfa muttered solemnly. He changed his direction and flew toward the “Clear Light Lighthouse”.</p><p>In other places in the void, the King Buddha of freedom, celestial venerate duobao, Empress Sanxiao, Demon King Ox, Demon King Roc, and ancient Buddha Lamplight also turned their eyes to the side and sensed the clear light that seemed to pierce through time and space.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
