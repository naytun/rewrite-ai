He had a feeling that he had been dragged into a terrible whirlpool.</p><p>He forced a smile and said, “Master, you are wrong. No matter how fated we are, how can we force it? Could it be that Buddhism cultivates the mind of a robber and the method of killing?”</p><p>The clear glass light around the fat monk spread out one circle after another. The smile on his face did not diminish as he said,</p><p>“Almsgiver, you don’t know the half of it. This item involves the nine Netherworld Demon God, and it concerns the safety of the world. Since I’ve encountered it, I’ve already made up my mind. Even if I have to give up this body, I will protect the path and defend the law. Almsgiver, for the sake of the true world and the livelihood of the world, please hand this item over to me and bring it back to the Pure Land, so as to prevent it from poisoning the living beings.”</p><p>His words were awe-inspiring and full of compassion. Lin Suhe was stunned when he heard it:</p><p>The Green Jade Box and the falling star crystals seemed to have come from the demon god of the netherworld..</p><p>Could it be that they really intended to invade the real world?</p><p>No, this was to be sent to the Fusang Ancient Tree Realm. There was the suppression of the Green Emperor there. which demon God could stir up waves?</p><p>However, what the Demon God said might not be true. Perhaps the green jade box would open quietly once it passed through the teleportation formation and release an item that could destroy the world, making me an accomplice to the evil. I would be spurned by the world..</p><p>Seeing that Lin Suhe had doubts and was struggling, the fat monk extended his right hand that was holding the prayer beads. Buddhist light sparkled and condensed into a solemn and quiet giant Buddha palm that grabbed towards the green jade box.</p><p>At this moment, a stern shout suddenly came from high up in the sky:</p><p>“Great Wheel Vajra!”</p><p>“Who?”The Fat Monk was inexplicably surprised and replied.</p><p>But before he finished his sentence, his body suddenly turned into light and was thrown upwards. It became smaller and smaller until it entered a purple-gold-red calabash. Then, it was pasted with a yellow paper that read “Grand Supreme Lao Jun’s urgent order”.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the purple-gold-red calabash disappeared, leaving only the vast expanse of green waves and the dazed Lin Suhe. Everything that happened just now changed too quickly and ended too quickly. It seemed to be a daydream.</p><p>He gritted his teeth and touched the galaxy meteorite crystal and the Green Jade Box in his arms. Since he had saved his life, he would first send it to the Fusang ancient tree realm to take a look. With the current situation, the bigwigs on the other shore had long returned. If anything really happened.., the Devil God had no chance of winning either. After all, if the sky fell, the tall man would be able to withstand it.</p><p>The escape light rose again and swept across the surface of the sea. It pushed aside the waves and headed straight for the island.</p><p>In the Pure Land Buddhist kingdom, which spanned across billions of tribulations, burning lamp watched this scene from afar. The 24 circles of Perfect Buddhist light behind his head swayed gently, stirring up endless ripples.</p><p>“What exactly does Su Meng want to send to the Fusang Ancient Tree Realm?”He asked in a low voice. He asked the Devil Buddha Ah Nan who seemed to be fine beside him.</p><p>The Green Jade box was mixed with some remnants of Donghuang. It was also refined by Su Meng’s fake Nirvana realm. It was already a rare treasure, making it difficult for one to peek through it to see what was inside. Even the bigwigs on the other side might not be able to see it clearly.</p><p>Ah Nan chuckled. “It doesn’t matter what it is. What’s important is the ‘gift’itself.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”Burning lamp vaguely understood su Meng’s plan.</p><p>Ah Nan said leisurely, “If it’s really important, once the jade box is brought out of the Netherworld by that mortal, Emperor Qing should have stepped in to help. Of course, there will also be other people on the other side obstructing it, which will turn into another round of resistance. Now that Emperor Qing is sitting firmly in the eastern glazed world without moving an inch, this can be seen.”</p><p>“This is Su Meng’s test.”Burning lamp made a judgment based on this.</p><p>“Yes, his plan of ‘throwing stones to ask for directions’, ‘asking’is about the bottom line of the people on the other side. If he succeeds this time, there will be a second time, a third time, or even more.”Ah Nan was not angry at all, he explained with a smile, “If su Meng wants to prove the other side, he must return to the real world and transfer back the ‘past’that he received from the netherworld. The biggest and most important part of the communication is the upstream of the river of time, peering into its future tributaries and laying the most solid foundation.”</p><p>“But if he dares to return in his real body, mother Wusheng will certainly make a move without hesitation and replay the confrontation that happened more than a hundred years ago. When the two sides are roughly equal, it will be easy for me. At that time, fellow Daoist, you will have to release me if you want to get rid of Su Meng.”</p><p>Burning lamp nodded slightly. “Fellow Daoist, you are too ruthless. You have always been the target of public criticism. Not only did Buddha and Bodhisattva not want to see you get out of trouble ahead of time, even the gold emperor did the same. Therefore, is this the bottom line that Su Meng is testing? “When he reaches a certain level, will the few on the other side acquiesce or tolerate you getting out ahead of time?”</p><p>“Exactly.”Ananda clapped his hands and smiled, “Although Su Meng wants to get out of the sea of bitterness and must return to the real world, it may not necessarily be necessary for his true body to return in person. He may slash out his ‘past body’, slash out the half-condensed corresponding illusory dao fruits, and send them out of the nine Netherworlds under the protection of others. It can also be done, but it will take some twists and turns and there is a danger of losing control. Of course, Su Meng can not send ‘them’directly to the Fusang Ancient Tree realm. That will certainly attract mother Wusheng’s direct interference.”</p><p>“He will divide this matter into many steps, real and fake, real and fake. Through repeated attempts like sending the green jade box to the Fusang ancient tree realm, he will ask about the limits of tolerance of those on the other side and roughly understand the scope of their personal participation. On one hand, he will strengthen the alliance with Emperor Qing, and on the other hand, he will use this opportunity to arrange for the true return. However, many of the arrangements may have already been in the Green Jade Box.”</p><p>The lamp-burning ancient Buddha listened quietly and did not interrupt. He had completely understood su Meng’s thoughts. He was walking on a very dangerous path.</p><p>If there was no devil Buddha in the current world, the other side could attack without any scruples and not worry about triggering any variables, then he would never have the chance to “Return”to the real world. However, that was not the case in reality, the other side had to consider that once they personally entered the battlefield and triggered an all-out confrontation, the Devil Buddha would have a high chance of escaping alive, bringing about the biggest and most unpredictable change. With this balance.., it also gave su meng the space to “Throw stones and ask for directions.”However, it was very easy for him to burn himself by playing with fire. If he really released the Devil Buddha, it would be a fatal blow to him.</p><p>“No wonder Maitreya only allowed the great wheel vajra to stop him…”burning lamp sighed softly. It would be best if he could resolve this matter without going through the big figures on the other side, “That benefactor will have to fight openly and secretly for the rest of his journey…”</p><p>At this point, he raised his head and stared at Ananda. “If this turns into a full-scale confrontation between the people on the other side, how can I help you get out?”</p><p>Burning Lamp had made up his mind. The previous few missed opportunities had made him understand one thing: if he did not make up his mind, he would be in trouble instead!</p><p>“Help Me Get Out?”Ananda looked at him like he was an idiot. “I don’t want to get out yet.”</p><p>Burning lamp fell into silence. After a long time, he said, “Fellow Daoist, haven’t you been bewitching me to help you get out?”</p><p>“That was then.”Ananda snickered, “If I get out of this, Su Meng’s hope will be completely extinguished. He won’t dare to step out of the netherworld. While he’s in the netherworld, he’s a false shore. He has the absolute saber and the Human Emperor Sword. If I win, I won’t be able to kill him. At that time, can I just stare at the end of the epoch? “In an incomplete situation, both parties will be reduced to ashes in the end. It suits his state of mind to perish together.”</p><p>As he spoke, Ananda’s tone was a little cold:</p><p>“I want to leave him with hope. I want him to step out of the Netherworld and charge to the other shore.”</p><p>Burning lamp came to a realization. He put his palms together and announced in a low voice,</p><p>“Amitabha, NAMWU.”</p><p>..</p><p>The nine spirits primordial saint looked at the pair of deep, dark eyes that were as deep as the bottom of the ocean. Just as it was filled with doubt, it suddenly received a message. Its eyes immediately revealed some surprise.</p><p>Then, it saw that the figure rolled up a bit of light and disappeared from where it was.</p><p>It was another time tunnel that was filled with mysterious and strange patterns. Meng Qi had more energy left. He looked back to an even older and more distant era. The scene around him constantly flickered and changed, revealing the appearance of different times in the netherworld.</p><p>Suddenly, the tunnel was affected by external forces and disintegrated again. He appeared next to the vast and scorching black sun. He saw a beam of dark light falling rapidly from the sky. Everywhere it passed, everything was desolate and all life was extinguished. Outside the nine underworld.., an extremely beautiful phoenix spread its wings and carried a thirty-three-story golden pagoda on its back. Streams of mysterious and yellow Qi hung down. Other than that.., there was also the Taiji morality scroll, the book of Sage Virtue, the Yin virtue flag, and the ancient blessed cauldron. Countless strange colors were scattered all over the place.</p><p>“The battle between demon Saint and Daoist Tiansha in the past?”Meng Qi roughly understood that he had returned to the mythological era.</p><p>As he thought about it, the Phoenix’s eyes and the coldness in the sword light turned towards this expert who had appeared out of nowhere.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
