The Carefree King Buddha in the world suddenly felt that something was wrong.</p><p>No matter what the other shore who gave him the golden millet pillow planned, as long as it involved Gu Xiaosang’s body, he could not avoid that person from the hollow jade temple!</p><p>He reached the other shore, looked back at time, and unified the past. The furious mad saber in front of him was equivalent to the real person. It was also the real other shore, and there was no time when it was weak, how could he not be alarmed when someone dared to have designs on Gu Xiaosang’s corpse in his arms? Even his own prying might be noticed!</p><p>Thinking of this, the free king and Buddha of the world had the intention to retreat. He did not dare to look on from the side, lest he angered someone on the other shore and end up in ashes.</p><p>Just as he was about to circulate his time accumulation to resist the impact of the turbulence when he returned, he suddenly saw the valiant and masculine figure carrying Gu Xiaosang’s corpse horizontally. Step by step, he walked toward the river. He did not step on the waves, as if he was going to sink into the bottom of the river.</p><p>At this moment, an unknown karmic fire suddenly rose from within Gu Xiaosang’s corpse. It swayed and burned, and it was difficult to extinguish. It was like a curse and a backlash. It made the figure in the white dress become hazy, like a dream bubble. If one did not see it with their own eyes.., if it was not for the great divine arts practitioner, they would not have noticed that she was slowly disappearing.</p><p>Seeing this scene, the world’s free king Buddha suddenly understood the “Whereabouts”of Gu Xiaosang’s corpse. She was a reincarnator and was controlled by the six paths. Although she had a certain degree of cooperation with the Devil Buddha.., she had also obtained the Higan memories imparted by mother wusheng, so she was less controlled and restrained when she was alive. However, after her death, it was still easy for the lord of the six paths of reincarnation to destroy her body, and the Devil Buddha was the only one who had attacked her.</p><p>Without knowing that Gu Xiaosang was the product of Mother Wusheng, in order to further stimulate Su Meng, the Devil Buddha had accidentally eliminated this hidden danger.</p><p>How different would it be today if they were to go back in time?</p><p>However, no matter who wanted to change the condition of Gu Xiaosang’s body, they could not escape from the Devil Buddha who had burned Gu Xiaosang’s body in the beginning, the gold emperor who was closely related to it, and the primordial Lord of Heaven, Su Meng, who had broken free from the Sea of suffering and ascended to the other shore!</p><p>As the King of freedom in the world did not know the difference between the gold emperor’s method of reducing space and the Buddha’s, he could not determine the mystery of the body that Gu Xiaosang had left behind, it was hard to guess what the Devil Buddha, the Golden Emperor, the primordial Lord of Heaven, Su Meng, and the person behind the yellow millet pillow were thinking and hoping to achieve.</p><p>Because of this doubt, the unfettered King Buddha in the world hesitated to leave this period of history, and then saw the next change: the nameless karmic fire that rose in Gu Xiaosang’s body slowly extinguished!</p><p>The Devil and Buddha knew very well about the Supreme True Buddha. They would rather miss it than let it go. They wanted to preserve this body. If it was proven to have an impact on the gold emperor in the future, it would be a crucial bargaining chip! A similar thought flashed in carefree king and Buddha’s mind. He could not help but guess the unpredictable “Will of heaven”.</p><p>After the nameless karmic fire was extinguished, the space between Su Meng’s arms suddenly became dark. The layers of structures in the void and the time that had passed were collapsing and curling. They wanted to return Gu Xiaosang’s body to its original “Nothingness”together with them!</p><p>“The person from the hollow jade temple wants to destroy the body so as not to affect the current Gu Xiaosang. Even if they really find out that this body can affect the gold emperor in the future, and the ashes are destroyed in his hands, it will be relatively easier to ‘recover’…”the easygoing king Buddha felt a sense of instant satisfaction, he seemed to have grasped the thoughts of the other side in this matter!</p><p>This was an almost impossible feat for the creatures struggling in the sea of bitterness!</p><p>“And the change in the condition of Gu Xiaosang’s body will definitely not be able to hide from the one from his hometown in the vacuum…”the unfettered king and Buddha in the world were extremely certain of this.</p><p>Thinking of this, he suddenly felt a chill run down his spine. He felt as if there was a pair of eyes quietly watching this scene from high up in the sky. Evil, demonic, dark, depraved, and deep, they were the eyes of the Devil and Buddha.., and the bright moon in the sky seemed to have an imperceptible ripple. There was no longer any flaw, and it was perfect and flawless.</p><p>In addition to that heroic figure, the unfettered king and Buddha of the world were actually covered in dust, frightened by his own imagination. His body, which was peeping from afar, seemed to be being watched. His entire body was transparent, without any secrets, but the young girl who came over with the help of the yellow millet pillow was covered by a subtle power and was not discovered.</p><p>Time surged and water surged. The unfettered king and Buddha of the world no longer hesitated. The golden body was surrounded by the clear glass light, turning into a dream-like illusion as it returned to the “Current node.”.</p><p>The last scene reflected in his eyes was: the nameless karmic fire erupted again, preventing the void and time from collapsing and curling up. The world became dark, even though the bright moon hung high in the sky!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>He heard the explosion that drilled into his heart. He felt as if the end of the world had arrived by the river. Gu Xiaosang’s body was pulled down by three forces and turned into ashes, disappearing into thin air. This wave surged forward, it affected his control over time. He had to use all his strength to barely avoid being swallowed by the turbulence.</p><p>..</p><p>In another part of history, the “Current node”of the “Hustle and bustle”outside Guangling city.</p><p>In the divine capital of Great Jin, the former Crown Prince’s residence that was once famous.</p><p>Zhao Qian lived in a quiet room and sat in the lotus position. Under him was a futon with a zen-like aura. Around him were lotus flowers that suddenly bloomed. They were quiet and extraordinary, distant and ethereal. A Buddha’s will seemed to descend from the void, a glass-colored ten thousand-character symbol was condensed between his brows.</p><p>Outside the window, a white-clothed girl was quietly watching. She was exquisite and beautiful, ethereal and lively. The corners of her mouth curled up, and her dimples were shallow, like a smile that was not a smile.</p><p>..</p><p>PFFT!</p><p>The world’s carefree king Buddha returned to the front with great difficulty. He spat out a mouthful of Golden Buddha’s blood, almost dyeing the blue waves dead silent.</p><p>“This matter is not a trivial matter. I have to repay Amitabha Buddha.”He ignored his injuries and leaped out of the real world. He came to the boundless and perfect glazed pure land, the western paradise.</p><p>He walked all the way and entered the core of the dreamlike land. He saw a six-foot-tall golden body with a face full of compassion and compassion. He nodded slightly and said,</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>There was no need for the world’s free king and Buddha to say anything more.</p><p>This… upon hearing this, the world’s free king and Buddha suddenly felt that what he saw today seemed to have been arranged by some important figure on the other shore!</p><p>Previously, he felt that he had guessed the will of heaven. Was it also someone who had let him guess correctly?</p><p>..</p><p>In the inn, the faint light that was covered by the yellow millet pillow gradually dimmed. Xia Xiu suddenly woke up.</p><p>“Which period of history did you return to? What did you gain?”Tan Ping and the others urgently asked.</p><p>Xia Xiu shook her head in confusion. “I don’t know which period of history it was, but I didn’t gain anything either…”</p><p>Before she could finish her sentence, she suddenly saw a speck of clear light emitting from her palm. Like a fountain, it outlined the petals of a flower and condensed into a palm-sized white lotus. It was fresh and refined, detached from worldly affairs.</p><p>The White Lotus instantly withered, leaving behind an ordinary-looking lotus seed.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
