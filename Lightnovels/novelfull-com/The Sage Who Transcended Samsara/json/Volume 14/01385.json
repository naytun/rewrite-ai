It made the heaven and earth within the coverage seem as if it had arrived at the end of the world, and nothing could survive.</p><p>Just from afar, Sun Wu, Tan Ping, and the other immortal avatars were all cold. Fear was as cold as ice, seeping deep into their bones. What was even more terrifying was that through this apocalyptic scene.., they seemed to have seen an extremely quiet darkness. There was no flow of time, no flash of thought. Other than dead silence, there was still dead silence. It made people feel fear and fear from the bottom of their hearts.</p><p>This was the final outcome. It was the “Tomb”of this era. Only by believing in the supreme mother could this despairing darkness evolve into a vacuum hometown.</p><p>Just as their minds were about to be eroded by the feeling of the leak of the immortal slaying sword array and turned into walking corpses, a clear cry of a crane suddenly sounded in their ears. A long golden bridge condensed from many dao patterns appeared in front of their eyes, it seemed to be erected on the sea of bitterness, leading to the other shore of bliss, turning into a dream-like bubble into a real existence.</p><p>This higan golden bridge descended from the Oudou Palace of the thirty-three heavens, also from the extreme south of the Eastern Sea. It extended from the point of intersection between the Netherworld and the real world, landing in front of the immortal slaying sword array in a vast and mighty manner. It was filled with the aura of Doomsday, it suppressed all the hidden killing and destruction and did not cause any ripples.</p><p>A white-haired old man in Daoist robes rode on a green bull and stepped on the Golden Bridge. He seemed to be walking slowly, but in reality, he was walking quickly. The world behind him changed, forming a black-and-white Yin-yang fish with its head and tail entwined.</p><p>“Welcome, martial granduncle!”Sun Wu was the first to come back to his senses and pay his respects.</p><p>The celestial venerable of morals! Tan Ping’s heart pounded violently. He was actually somewhat shaken. Even though he was the reincarnation of the ancient Empyrean God, water ancestor, he was able to enter and leave the immortal world as if nothing had happened. The number of times he had met the heavenly venerate of virtue could be counted on one hand. After all, ever since the beginning of this era.., daofather three purities, the two saints of the west, Demon Empress Nuwa, and the other ancient transmigrators who had dominated the previous eras were all hiding behind the scenes. They rarely appeared in the world. Before the fall of the heavenly court.., they were only able to get a glimpse of the Battle of Ascension. At most, they would be able to pay their respects at the Peaches of immortality banquet and other occasions</p><p>Today, this ancient Celestial Master was right in front of them.</p><p>It was precisely because of this that Tan Ping felt that the end of the world was approaching.</p><p>“Welcome, Celestial Master!”The others were all startled awake. They followed Sun Wu and bowed respectfully.</p><p>At the same time, there were many Brahma flowers falling from the sky. They were golden and translucent, and they shone with a glazed light. They intersected with the green lotus flowers that were blooming on the surface of the sea and on the ground. “Namo Amitabha Buddha”came out from every corner, it was endless.</p><p>The Brahma and the green lotus bloomed. A Golden Buddha sat cross-legged in each of them. It was the Amitabha Buddha in the hearts of every believer. It was also the manifestation of all kinds of karma, together, they formed a vast Buddha that filled all the worlds in the universe. Bit by bit, it was like the condensation of the vast sea.</p><p>In the center of the vast sea of Buddha, a twelfth-grade green lotus throne was fresh and clean. It was not stained by dust. It connected the perfect nirvana world in the Western Paradise, which was everywhere. It turned into a pale golden giant Buddha with 48 circles of light behind its head, its face was full of compassion and its heart was filled with all living beings.</p><p>This faint golden giant Buddha opened its palm and sat in a lotus position with a golden body that was six feet tall. It emitted boundless light and had boundless lifespan. It had boundless divine abilities. White waves rolled over its head, and three Zen intents floated above it, the relic that symbolized wealth seemed to be the smallest, but it made the onlookers look at it instinctively. It was as if it was the source of all dharma and the condensation of all the true intents of Buddhism.</p><p>When the two most ancient Hikikomori appeared, the surroundings of three clouds island immediately became calm. However, the immortal-slaying sword formation was red, green, black, and white. It did not seem to be weakened at all. The Bright Moon at the center of the formation was quietly hanging high in the sky, without any ripples, it was as if they had been waiting for a long time.</p><p>The celestial venerable of morals walked to the front of the immortal-slaying sect. He looked up at the green ethereal immortal sword that seemed to be hanging in the sky and sighed lightly. He pushed the Daoist crown on his head and a wave of clear air rushed out, turning into three Daoists, old, middle, and green, they all had the aura of the other shore, showing the beginning, prosperity, and decline.</p><p>“Daoist brother, I’m here to help you!”The three Daoists each rode on a strange beast and went to the gate of extermination, following the heavenly venerate of virtue. One went to the gate of extermination, waiting for Amitabha’s dharma body, which was rolling relics above his head, to approach the gate of entrapment, they met up with Amitabha’s dharma body.</p><p>Seeing this, Amitabha put his hands together, and the three dharma bodies chanted in unison,</p><p>“Mercy, Mercy.”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, his avatar entered the gate of extinction. The three Sariras above his head rolled out white waves, turning the past, present, and future, up, down, left, right, front, and back, into an illusion. Even the trillions of sword lights that fell were the same, like a dream, it disappeared without a trace in the blink of an eye. A great path opened up in the formation, allowing Amitabha to grow lotuses step by step and walk toward the core of the formation. Daoist Shangqing followed closely by his side.</p><p>The higan golden bridge extended out and entered the celestial execution citadel. All the sword radiances, all the destruction, and all the slaughter were suppressed. There were no fluctuations, allowing the heavenly venerate of morals to “Leisurely”ride the ox into the depths, daoist Taiqing did not even use any abhijna.</p><p>Outside the gate of entrapment of immortality, the perfected body descended. He pointed with his finger, and the Green Lotus platform beneath him shot up into the sky. Lotus flowers bloomed inside, each holding a relic. Each relic emitted billions of rays of light and interweaved with each other, it formed an indestructible “Pure Land.”Even if the sword light kept slashing down and the end of the world came, it could only shake a little. One or two green lotuses fell, and Daoist Yuqing held the Jade Ruyi in his palm, the golden flower of virtue, the purple clouds of virtue, and the Holy Virtue Water Light were also guarded tightly. The two combined their strength and steadily passed through the gate of Entrapment, approaching the core of the formation in the boundless sword Qi of destruction, Slaughter, and freezing.</p><p>On the other side, the vast Buddha formed by countless Amitabha Buddhas flew into the gate of immortal slayer amidst the endless “Buddhist chants”. Each sword light was able to destroy a Buddha, but the Buddha was reborn again after being destroyed.., the implication was boundless. For a moment, both sides had their ups and downs, and they were in a stalemate.</p><p>Seeing that Amitabha Buddha was having a hard time breaking through the formation, Meng Qi did not sigh. Instead, he nodded slightly. The current situation was a little better than he had expected.</p><p>As expected of the two most ancient transmigrators in the world. He had originally estimated that he would need a transmigrator who was close to the embryonic form of Dao Fruit to break through the immortal slaying sword formation. In other words, he had to descend and do his best to be confident, however, looking at it now, the Green Emperor who had not fully recovered was enough.</p><p>Meng Qi, who was in the hollow jade temple, looked at the Green Emperor in the Fusang Ancient Tree realm. Their eyes met and they nodded slightly.</p><p>It was better to leave the breaking of the formation to Emperor Qing. He would stay behind. Together with the Monster Emperor and the Bodhi ancient Buddha, it would be enough to suppress all evil.</p><p>Outside the three clouds island, green light suddenly sprinkled down from the sky and paved a road. Within a radius of hundreds of thousands of miles, plants grew, schools of fish expanded, and life was full of vitality, then, Sun Wu, Tan Ping, and the other immortal gods saw Emperor Qing riding a powerful nine-headed lion with a purple pure Yang Jade ruler hanging at his waist. He walked into the slaughter immortal sect elegantly and elegantly along the “Road”.</p><p>The Purple Qi was mighty and formed many flying flowers. The Sword Qi twisted down and could not be shaken at all. Green emperor and Amitabha joined hands to pass through the door and enter the sword formation.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Meng Qi, who was sitting cross-legged in the dark chaos, had a deep look in his eyes. It was as if there were other worlds hidden in the universe, waiting for the next change.</p><p>Mother Wusheng’s sudden escalation of the conflict was too sudden at first glance, but after careful deduction, it could be found that this was his best response: his body was in the final tribulation, his cultivation method combined with the orthodoxy of the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure, and he also grasped the four immortal slaying swords and the formation map, it was like the incarnation of the end of the epoch, which made every person on the other shore wary. If he was about to take a step further on the path of reducing and seeking emptiness, it would be almost intolerable!</p><p>Therefore, before little sang broke free from the sea of bitterness, the heavenly venerate of morality, Amitabha, and the other ancient elders who feared each other would most likely put aside their differences temporarily and join forces to deal with the gold emperor, just like how they had attacked their home in the vacuum when they were in heaven, in the process of dismantling the four celestial eradication swords and the formation map, he would never mind adding insult to injury. It would be best if he could make the gold emperor perish.</p><p>Seeing that such a future could not be changed, he used the celestial eradication sword formation as the bait for an overt scheme. He would help the celestial emperor or the Devil Buddha to tie down at least three other shores in exchange for other benefits. Without considering emotions, he would only talk about benefits, it was indeed the best choice, and he had even turned the passive into the active.</p><p>The Gold Emperor would give up on worldly possessions, even if it was a godly weapon of the other shore level!</p><p>Therefore, the following article was outside the celestial eradication sword array, not inside the array that was destined to be the result!</p><p>Just as Meng Qi’s thoughts were moving in the infinite chaos, outside the demon Emperor Palace, the water suddenly flourished and rippled, transforming into a towering and lofty emperor.</p><p>He stood outside the door with his hands behind his back, neither entering nor leaving. Just like that, he ‘looked’at the monster Emperor ‘from afar’through the many pavilions.</p><p>The Celestial Emperor had made his move!</p><p>The key point was the Devil Buddha… Meng Qi had an epiphany. He reached out his hand and was about to command the Three Treasures Ruyi, which was suppressing the intersection of the extreme south end of the East Sea, the nine underworlds, and the real world. A clear aura flowed out from the top of his head, it transformed into a green-blue, pure Buddha.</p><p>Suddenly, outside the hollow jade temple, a little green floated down. Each dot was suffused with the color of wisdom and tranquility. It was disguised as a towering Bodhi tree. Under the tree sat an ancient Buddha with twenty-four heads in eighteen hands in a lotus position, each of them held a jade bracelet, a flower pot, a divine pestle, a golden bell, an umbrella cover, and other objects. The glass was bright and clean, without the slightest bit of dust. Beside him, a quasi-taoist with his hair in a bun was holding a colorful seven treasures magical tree, he smiled and looked at Meng Qi, who had a deep aura in the Jade Clear Hall.</p><p>Bodhi ancient Buddha!</p><p>The one who came to stop Meng Qi was the Bodhi ancient Buddha!</p><p>Meng Qi was neither shocked nor angry. He looked at the Bodhi ancient Buddha and the quasi-lift Daoist and said calmly, “I am not afraid.”</p><p>“No wonder the gold emperor is so fearless. I thought it was the demon emperor who created the gap, but it turned out to be the ancient Buddha.”</p><p>“With the realm and strength of the ancient Buddha, there is only one thing that Ah Nan can bewitch you, and that is the ‘technique’to cut out another corpse in a short period of time.”</p><p>Tu Qiong saw it clearly. He had already seen the changes in the tributaries that followed. The Devil Buddha, Ah Nan, had done so much. He had contacted the heavenly emperor, communicated with the Golden Emperor, and secretly connected with the Bodhi in order to eliminate the interference, refine the nine underworld, and become the incarnation of the Apocalypse, the evil devil that destroyed the world!</p><p>The Bodhi ancient Buddha was shrouded in the pure Buddhist light. He said with a smile and a sigh,</p><p>“Three of my corpses were damaged because of you, and now, because of you, Hope has been restored. One drink and one peck are all destined. As the cause of all the consequences, I believe that it is not difficult for you to understand.”</p><p>With his realm, it was not difficult for him to kill another corpse. It was difficult because the end of the world was near and time was pressing. Even if he could kill one, he would not be able to grow, not to mention fighting Amitabha, the heavenly venerate of morals, and others for the transcendence dao fruit.</p><p>In the Monster Emperor Palace, the voice of the little girl sounded as if she was sighing and asking,</p><p>“You took the chestnuts from the Devil Buddha’s fire. Have you forgotten what happened in the past? Aren’t you afraid that you will be attacked from behind again?”</p><p>Knowing that the Devil Buddha was very harmful to the monster race, the Heavenly Emperor did not have any doubts about the monster emperor’s attitude. A faint smile appeared on his blurry face in the light:</p><p>“Once the nine Netherworld is refined, the Devil Buddha will temporarily replace the gold emperor who controls the immortal-slaying sword formation and become the symbol of the destruction of the world. He will be so powerful that he is as old as the ancients. He will also have great power. In this way, he will naturally become the target of everyone. He will firmly attract the attention of the heavenly venerates and Buddhas. This will allow the heavenly emperor of this era to obtain a certain degree of relief.”</p><p>The end of the epoch had always been tied to the destruction of the nine heavens and the fall of the Celestial Emperor. After the Devil Buddha refined the nine Netherworld, there were changes, just like how the Heavenly Emperor planted the fusang ancient tree and tried to replace the peach tree!</p><p>The Celestial Emperor knew this, and so did the Devil Buddha. They just took what they needed!</p><p>..</p><p>In the nine Netherworld, when the bodhi ancient Buddha blocked the “Gate”of the Hollow Jade Temple, the Devil Buddha sitting cross-legged on the pitch-black peak suddenly revealed its devil body. It had nine heads and 26 faces, and each of its arms held human skin, wooden fish, white bones, prayer beads, and other objects, every face was a manifestation of all sorts of negative emotions in the hearts of all living beings. It was filled with the intent of great destruction, Great Madness, great destruction, and Great Terror.</p><p>The dozens of eyes flickered with dark red, highlighting the reverse ten thousand character symbol. They all looked toward the deepest part of the netherworld.</p><p>The demon lord suddenly stood up, and a small seal flew out of his body, enveloping Yang Jian. It was deep and heavy, and it was divided into six realms. It manifested the scenes of the Netherworld, the mortal world, and the Paradise of the immortal world. It was dark and deep, and it was mysterious and profound, it was as if it could push any great divine arts practitioner into different reincarnation cycles. It could make every person on the other shore feel as if they were born after birth.</p><p>Reincarnation seal!</p><p>In order to successfully refine the nine Netherworlds, the demon Buddha lent the treasure to the demon lord!</p><p>Yang Jian’s expression was calm. He held the small apricot flag in his hand, and golden lotuses rolled around. They emitted a myriad of light that connected to the Yin Earth, firmly protecting himself against the power of reincarnation.</p><p>The Dark Red Vortex appeared in every corner of the nine netherworld. They turned into crazed eyes and palms that kept contracting, enveloping the nine chaos celestial master who controlled the Demon Emperor’s claws.</p><p>The two chaotic and irrational fellows were like wild beasts. They entangled with each other, tore at each other, crushed the world, and froze time.</p><p>Black Heavenly Emperor extended his palm from the void and fought with Ghost Emperor Xuanming in the two levels of Luo Feng and black prison. They destroyed layers of yin earth and decayed the ghosts and zombies.</p><p>In a short moment, there were only seven kills Daoist who wielded the netherworld sea sword and the extremely terrifying Devil Buddha left in the netherworld.</p><p>As their eyes met and were being stared at one by one, seven kills Daoist suddenly felt a strong sense of fear. It came from the memories of being crushed and defeated by the Devil Buddha in the past, and it came from the imprint of many years of puppets.</p><p>The enemy in front of him could not be defeated and could not be stopped!</p><p>This was a thought that could not be dispelled from his heart.</p><p>“What, do you still want to resist?”The Devil Buddha, Ah Nan, smiled. He was evil and deep.</p><p>At this moment, a golden light broke through the space-time barrier and fell into the nine netherworld. It turned into a dark and violent ape. It swallowed time and reversed karma. In an instant, it reached the pseudo-nirvana realm. It was the Monkey King Grand Sage, Sun Wukong.</p><p>He did not use the Golden Cudgel. He extended his right hand and it expanded continuously. It connected the sky with the earth and smashed towards the demon Buddha like a windmill. He shouted,</p><p>“Return my master’s Life!”</p><p>Under the guidance of this high-spirited fighting spirit, the seven kills Daoist finally cut off the fear in his heart. He held the Netherworld Sea Sword and turned into a streak of lightless sword radiance. He crossed several layers of the nine Netherworlds and slashed towards the huge body of the demon Buddha.</p><p>“Heh, do you think that you can fight me with the boost from the Netherworld? Don’t you see whose home ground this is?”The eyes of the demon Buddha, Ah Nan, flashed with a cold light. His smile did not diminish as his body suddenly squirmed and split into three lumps of flesh and blood.</p><p>The flesh and blood grew longer with the wind and turned into the appearance of the thunder god, Ah Nan and the demon Buddha. Originally, they were only at the peak of the destiny realm, but with the boost from the netherworld, they instantly expanded to the pseudo-nirvana realm, he faced the equal-heaven Grand Sage and the seven kills Daoist. With three against two, he barely managed to hold them back.</p><p>The nine Netherworld’s boost to the Nirvana realm was limited? It did not matter! If I could turn one into ten thousand demons and secretly cultivate three temporary bodies at the peak of the Destiny realm, they would be able to improve their essence!</p><p>This was the terrifying aspect of the Satanic Buddha in the nine netherworld!</p><p>However, at this moment, the Satanic Buddha’s aura had also dropped to the level of the weak Nirvana realm. If it continued to drop, he might encounter a backlash.</p><p>Seeing that all his opponents were blocked and that the celestial eradication sword formation was on the verge of collapse, but it could still hold on for a few breaths, he felt exceptionally happy. He looked at Meng Qi in the hollow jade temple and laughed out loud:</p><p>“You should help me become the oldest shore!”</p><p>Amidst the loud laughter, the Devil Buddha took a step forward and entered the bottom of the Netherworld Sea. He entered the core of the netherworld. Waves of red and black light surged out like water, dotted with reverse ten thousand symbols.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The Netherworld trembled, and the black sun fell. Qi Zhengyan from the Scarlet Mountain Range had long stood up, and his gaze was solemn as he looked at the bottom of the Netherworld Sea.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The Devil Buddha’s laughter reverberated in every part of the Netherworld Sea. This world was dyed black and red, as if it had become someone else’s internal organs. It squirmed crazily, digesting everything.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan’s gaze was deep, and he sighed. He set off rolling red currents, and swept up the transformed evil devil God and his followers. He instantly disappeared, and no one knew where he had hidden them.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Thunder rumbled as black lightning streaked across the sky. It was densely packed like an ocean, filling up the netherworld.</p><p>..</p><p>A pure white, flawless light illuminated the sky. The Supreme True Buddha looked hungrily at the Buddhas and bodhisattvas who had lost the protection of the other shore, such as the Benevolent Voyage Bodhisattva and the Moonlight Bodhisattva!</p><p>Seeing this, Meng Qi let out a long sigh:</p><p>“My Zhending Tathagata has nothing to do with the nine Netherworlds. He can only block the Supreme True Buddha.”</p><p>“The Supreme True Buddha can restrain the golden body of the Zen sect. I’m afraid you can’t rely on Zhending alone. I’m willing to help,”Zhundi Daoist said with a smile. He turned his head and raised the seven treasures wonderful tree, charging at the Supreme True Buddha, zhending Tathagata also used this opportunity to escape from the hollow jade temple and launch a siege.</p><p>Looking at the ancient Buddha under the bodhisattva tree, Meng Qi said without anger or annoyance,</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, aren’t you worried that after the Devil Buddha refines the netherworld, it will be difficult to control it and bring about the end of the era ahead of time?”</p><p>The ancient bodhisattva Buddha looked at the refined Netherworld and chuckled:</p><p>“Of course I’m worried. Moreover, the Devil Buddha is a traitor by nature. Even if we cooperate, we won’t be able to trust him. However, it’s not like I’m not prepared. I have a magical technique.”</p><p>“What secret technique?”Meng Qi suddenly understood.</p><p>The Bodhi ancient Buddha smiled:</p><p>“The stronger you are, the weaker he will be. When he has refined the nine Netherworlds, I will help you to improve.”</p><p>As he spoke, a golden body of a Buddha appeared under the Bodhi Tree. It was green and golden, untainted, unclean, and indestructible. It had three heads and six arms. It was extremely powerful!</p><p>“This is…”even Meng Qi who was at Nirvana realm was a little surprised.</p><p>This was the golden body of the Holy Buddha!</p><p>This was the body of the primordial Lord of Heaven!</p><p>Bodhi ancient Buddha sighed:</p><p>“When I was in Lingshan, I used this to persuade Wukong to reincarnate and cultivate again. I really stood on the side of Buddhism. Unfortunately, he didn’t want to…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
