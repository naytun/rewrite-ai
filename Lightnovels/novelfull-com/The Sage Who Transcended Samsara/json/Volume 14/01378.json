His eyes were filled with arrogance and a sense of accomplishment as if he had single-handedly changed the fate of the world.</p><p>Restraining the raging waves in his heart, tan ping vaguely sensed that the river of time was roaring. The mad rejection of history was about to surge over, so he said with a face full of shock,</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, you have actually seized this thing! It is the key to this calamity!”</p><p>“This is a very important matter. I will immediately lead you to the myriad water ancestral mansion!”</p><p>All of Shen Gongpao’s vanity was satisfied. He turned around and looked at the depths of the vast, glittering sea of stars. Pointing with his finger, he laughed and said, “Please, fellow Daoist!”</p><p>Before he finished his words, he suddenly heard a clear and melodious bell ring. He felt that all his thoughts had become muddled, followed by a sharp pain at the back of his head. His vision immediately turned pitch-black.</p><p>“You…”Shen Gongpao turned around with difficulty and stared at Tan Ping with lifeless eyes. His body quickly collapsed and fainted, floating in the illusory water waves.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist has offended me!”Tan Ping held a purple-gold bell in one hand and an octagon mace in the other. He gnashed his teeth and said, his eyes filled with ferocity and viciousness.</p><p>He absolutely could not let the history of Ascension change greatly. Otherwise, the people on the other side would at most suffer a certain degree of backlash, which was not enough to hurt their bones, on the other hand, his family and other almighty experts would have to go through all sorts of things again to have a chance of surviving until the current juncture. They might not be able to be as safe as the previous time!</p><p>The purple-gold bell circled, and tan ping picked up the “Ascension Board”in Shen Gongpao’s arms with one hand. He turned his head and fled out of this world, wanting to hang this peerless item back to Mount Qi before history changed.</p><p>If it weren’t for the fact that he didn’t want to delay any longer, he would have kicked Shen gongpao hard:</p><p>F * ck your fellow Daoist, please wait! I will pull you to the water source of the sea filling eye right now!</p><p>At this moment, his vision blurred and two familiar yet unfamiliar figures appeared in front of him.</p><p>One of them had a dark blue body that was close to black. He had an ancient and majestic aura. He had two black dragons under his feet and a terrifying water snake in his ears. In his hand was an octagon mace that looked exactly like tan ping’s. It was his true body, the innate god spirit water ancestor, another one was wearing a black imperial robe. His aura was majestic and there was a blurry dao pattern on his forehead. It looked like a ghost, a God, an immortal, and a demon. Just by looking at him, Tan Ping could feel his opponent’s aura. It was so dark and virtuous that he could not look straight at him, it was the last obstacle that the heavenly monarch had in his way. Yin Shang was like a soup!</p><p>They were close to the creator level and they were the top figures among the great divine arts practitioners. How could they hide the fact that there was an attack outside the myriad water ancestor’s mansion?</p><p>“Who are you?”As the master, the ancient water god glanced at the unconscious Shen gongpao and focused all his attention on Tan Ping. He felt that the other party had an inexplicable connection and strange resonance with him, even their auras were vaguely similar.</p><p>Facing Cheng Tang, Tan Ping’s heart was beating like a drum. However, he had finally seen his real body, so he could not let go of this opportunity. Moreover, if he wanted to hide it from Cheng Tang and send back the god Ascension Roll, he definitely could not rely on his newly formed Dharma body.</p><p>Thus, he stared into the eyes of the water ancestor and gave an enigmatic smile. He then shouted,</p><p>“Do you still not understand?”</p><p>The water ancestor was stunned and his expression was shocked. Then, he said thoughtfully, “Who are you my lost descendant? The Qing Yue River Narcissus? The female flood dragon of the Daming Lake?”</p><p>He had a horny nature. At his peak, he had three to five hundred of his own children!</p><p>Tan Ping’s subsequent words were immediately stuck in his throat. He felt annoyed as if he was throwing a flirtatious glance at a blind man. The old him, the old him, was actually so dull!</p><p>It was only after the fall of the Heaven Court and the chaos of the world that he realized that he no longer viewed the universe from the perspective of an innate god. With his breakthrough, he was able to live to the present.</p><p>Beside him, Cheng Tang glanced at the Octagon Jian in Tan Ping’s hand and he looked at the water ancestor with a puzzled expression, “These two divine weapons are exactly the same, the only difference is the feeling of the vicissitudes of life.”</p><p>At this moment, Tan Ping felt extremely fortunate. He had kept it in his mustard seed ring after receiving the god Ascension Roll. Otherwise, how could he have hidden it from the famous Ghost Emperor Cheng Tang?</p><p>“Exactly the same…”the water ancestor was even more puzzled. The light in his eyes rippled like a stone thrown into a still lake. The ripples went straight to the origin.</p><p>Yi! He suddenly felt like he was looking at himself in the bronze mirror!</p><p>‘this matter is a little strange. I Can’t get to the bottom of it in front of Cheng Tang so that he won’t get to the bottom of it…’the water ancestor covered his shock, he said calmly, “Sigh, it seems to be the product of that mortal fate. I Can’t expose my family’s dirty laundry. I Won’t send the Emperor out of the Ninth Heaven.”</p><p>Cheng Tang nodded slightly and didn’t think much about it, he turned to look at Shen gongpao, who was floating beside tan ping’s feet. “This friend is the disciple of the Celestial Master of the Hollow Jade Temple. He once came to visit me. Why did he appear here, and why was he killed by you?”</p><p>Upon hearing this, the water ancestor was shocked and blurted out,</p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p>Even he did not dare to openly deal with the disciples of the Hollow Jade Temple. That Celestial Master was the oldest one on the other side, and he was extremely protective of his disciples!</p><p>Tan Ping was also drenched in cold sweat. For a moment, he did not know how to answer. As long as Cheng Tang woke Shen Gongpao up, the matter of the god Ascension Roll would be exposed.</p><p>And when the bigwigs on the other side did not make a move and seemed to be in a stalemate, it was very strange. The Ghost Emperor, Cheng Tang, who had completed his destiny, could play an important role!</p><p>Fortunately, he was a guest from later generations. He did not know the matter of the god Ascension like the back of his hand, and he was better than any other experts outside of the other side. He found a reason in a flash.., he said respectfully, “Imperial Emperor, this fellow Daoist is angry that Jiang Ziya was valued by the celestial venerable of the Hollow Jade Temple and held the key to this calamity. His own cultivation and strength are far superior to the other party. Therefore, he left Kunlun Mountain in anger and wanted to stir up the matter between Yin Shang and Xi Qi.”</p><p>At this point, Cheng Tang roughly understood the whole story. Shen Gongpao betrayed the hollow jade temple and came to the ninth heaven to seek refuge with him, therefore, he nodded and said, “I see. Why Don’t you leave this fellow Daoist Shen Gongpao to me to deal with?”</p><p>He did not suspect, so he did not use his supernatural power to examine Tan Ping. The sense of karma became weak due to the existence of the water ancestor.</p><p>“Imperial Emperor, please understand. Fellow Daoist Shen Gongpao left the hollow jade temple without permission. I have to send him back to Kunlun Mountain to avoid the blame of the heavenly venerate. The Imperial Emperor may not be afraid, but I and the water ancestor can not bear the wrath of the heavenly venerate,”tan ping answered calmly, he felt that his temperament had improved greatly in an instant, and it was better than the years of bitter cultivation.</p><p>No wonder the innate godly spirit body had a shackle on cultivation..</p><p>“That’s right,”water ancestor agreed.</p><p>Cheng Tang thought for a while and said, “When this fellow Daoist wakes up, please tell him that Yin Shang’s door is open for him.”</p><p>Then, he turned into a wisp of green smoke and disappeared into the immortal world. He did not dare to stay any longer as he was the enemy of the heavenly monarch.</p><p>After seeing Cheng Tang leave, tan ping finally heaved a sigh of relief. He felt weak and almost collapsed like Shen Gongpao. If he had shown any weakness just now, the matter would not have been resolved. Now, there was still a chance to redeem history!</p><p>He did not have the time to rejoice and immediately sent a telepathic message to the confused water ancestor:</p><p>“Don’t you understand? I am you. I am your reincarnation to get rid of the restrictions of the innate gods</p><p>“This time, with the help of the treasure, I have transmigrated here from the future. I am trying to wake you up and establish the foundation of the other shore</p><p>“There is no time to say more. Quick, escort me to Qishan. Otherwise, history will change drastically. We might not be able to withstand the correction and Backlash!”</p><p>F * ck, do you think I’ll believe you just because you say so? The water ancestor had such an expression on his face at this moment, and he was greatly shocked in his heart.</p><p>Seeing that the water ancestor would not be able to accept this for a while, Tan Ping did not dare to delay. He immediately set up his escape light and was about to fly out of this world and head to Qishan by himself.</p><p>Suddenly, the sparkling water around them became illusory. The spatial structure changed, and the scene collapsed layer by layer. It once again formed the appearance of the deep and serene great hall.</p><p>A lofty and indifferent emperor stood on the emperor’s throne. He stood with his hands behind his back, quietly looking at the water ancestor and Tan Ping.</p><p>Heavenly Emperor! Tan Ping’s heart was filled with despair. The matter of the god Ascension Roll had finally provoked an important figure on the other shore!</p><p>Although in history, in the water ancestor’s memories, the heavenly emperor at this time was still one step away from the other shore. He had yet to completely open the highest level of the nine heavens. He had to wait until the god Ascension was over and take over as the soup, truly becoming the ruler of the Heaven and earth, only then would he be able to dominate the world. However, once he became the other side, the past, present, and future would be the same. The Heavenly Emperor in history would be the Heavenly Emperor in the future, and he would be a big figure on the other side. There would be no difference anymore!</p><p>Damn it, “Fellow Daoist, please wait!”!</p><p>..</p><p>At the current node, Meng Qi, who was wearing a deep robe and an ancient crown, was playing chess with the Green Emperor. The back of his head was round and clear, reflecting the past, present, and future.</p><p>PS: the third will be later. Everyone, look at it tomorrow morning</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
