Regardless of whether they were male or female, their minds were swayed. The tip of their nose suddenly smelled a strange fragrance, like musk or orchids. Their bodies seemed to float, as if they had fallen into the clouds.</p><p>The fire clouds hung low, surrounded by flames. The Green Hill descended to the sky above Yanling Island. Holding a long spear with one hand behind his back, his eyes were sparkling, reflecting the nine-bend yellow river formation in front of him.</p><p>The Empress suddenly issued a decree, asking him to come and help her. Was this the prelude to a new round of the war on the other shore? Or did she already “See”that Empress San Xiao was just bluffing, using the human emperor’s mentality of not wanting to easily widen the conflict to scare the enemy away with the “Empty city strategy”?</p><p>If it was the former, it would not be a waste to think about it. With the current situation, Amitabha, old mother Wu Sheng, and the primordial Lord of Heaven, Su Meng, did not want to break the relative peace before Gu Xiaosang attacked the other shore, which would increase the number of variables suddenly, it would even lead to the possibility of an uncertain future.</p><p>At the moment, Amitabha had stabilized the alliance with Bodhi ancient Buddha. The Golden Emperor, at some unknown price, had a tacit understanding with the celestial emperor and the Devil Buddha, and might even secretly join forces. The primordial Lord of Heaven, Su Meng, had been befriending the green emperor, it could be imagined that when Gu Xiaosang tried to break free from the sea of bitterness and bring Amitabha and mother Wusheng closer to the Dao fruit, the important figures on the other shore who would stand out to stop her were clearly at a disadvantage. They did not want to take this opportunity to stir up the situation and intensify the conflict, they could only watch helplessly when the time came.</p><p>And now that they had descended to help the human emperor, neither the heavenly venerate of morality, the green emperor, or the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning, Su Meng, could pick out the word “Wrong”. In the face of the imminent collision, they would only stand on the side of the current human emperor, let’s see how Amitabha and the ancient Bodhi Buddha would respond.</p><p>With his mind racing and his thoughts whirling, Qing Qiu had a pure and charming smile on his face. He took a step forward and stepped into the “Nine bend Yellow River Formation”under everyone’s gaze!</p><p>The world changed. The river water was turbid and rolled up a thousand layers of brown waves. They merged with the light from the Chaos Golden Dipper and struck towards Qing Qiu in all directions. Once they were contaminated, they would immediately change towards mortals, the top three flowers were cut off and the five Qi in his chest was corroded. Therefore, the nine-bend Yellow River Array with the Chaos Golden Dipper as the core was the nemesis of almost all cultivators below the other shore.</p><p>Trapped in the array that shone brightly during the ancient godhood era and could lose the illusory great dao at any time, Qing Qiu was calm and unhurried. He held the Black Golden Spear with Phoenix wings on his back and made it stab upwards, shaking out the spear flowers, it transformed into a thirty-three-story Golden Pagoda. Streaks of yellow light drooped down like a cluster of true dragons. It was sacred and solemn, and it was filled with virtue. It was impervious to all spells!</p><p>Turbid waves flickered with golden light as they slammed down. The Heaven, earth, black, and Yellow Pagoda remained unmoving. It was not tainted by the power of decadence. It was bright yellow, clear, and lustrous.</p><p>With the Virtue Pagoda formed by the demon Saint Spear, Qing Qiu Sheng walked leisurely toward the center of the nine Bend Yellow River Array Formation. Along the way, the wind was strong, the waves were high, and the turbid waves were filthy. None of them could shake her even a little. Even if the chaos golden dipper was lowered.., even if it pressed down on her surroundings, it would not be able to soak in the light of the mysterious yellow merit.</p><p>At the center of the formation, two flood dragons, one black and one white, flew out. Yin and Yang interweaved, creating a tai chi millstone. It twisted the heaven, earth, and the mysterious yellow exquisite pagoda, wanting to wear it down bit by bit.</p><p>The mysterious yellow splashed and the light gold flickered. The sizzling sound of friction was incessant. The thirty-three golden pagodas did not appear to be dull at all.</p><p>At this moment, Qing Qiu had already arrived at the edge of the nine twists of the Yellow River Formation. He saw three clouds island, which was entangled by the turbid river water. Everything was so fragile, so vulnerable.</p><p>“There hasn’t been any change yet… could it be that lady three clouds is really bluffing and has just started to use all her chips to Bluff?”Qing Qiu let out a sigh of relief, half relieved and half relieved of a lot of doubts.</p><p>She pointed her finger at San Xiao Island and pointed at the winding turbid river.</p><p>The Heaven, earth, and yellow exquisite pagoda instantly disintegrated into a vast and clear ocean. A book full of the feeling of moistening things floated up and down, bringing with it the sparkling light of a spark, and submerged toward San Xiao Island.</p><p>It was a saint’s virtue to be moistened by the common people and not be touched by any laws!</p><p>The turbid and sinking tortuous river water avoided one after another. It split open the central fog and revealed the scene on the three clouds island.</p><p>That place seemed to have formed a world of its own. The four pillars of Heaven and earth each had a towering and rugged immortal sword. It was red like blood, pitch black like the sky, green ethereal, and pure white. They interweaved with each other and gave birth to an endless sword light, it displayed the intent of destruction, Slaughter, freeze, and so on. Just by looking at it, Fox Qingqiu also took a few steps back under the protection of the water of holy virtue.</p><p>Immortal-slaying sword formation!</p><p>The complete immortal-slaying sword formation!</p><p>The number one killing formation in the immemorial era!</p><p>What was even more terrifying was that in the center of three clouds island, there was a bright and clear moon hanging. It was calm and tranquil, as if it was the scene after death, illuminating the place where the sword Qi was rampant.</p><p>Wu Sheng’s mother actually personally came here to preside over the immortal-slaying sword formation!</p><p>This was absolutely different from the power when she used the four immortal-slaying swords and the formation map to form a formation against the enemy. Because at this moment, there was an ancient elder suppressing the eye of the formation, almost recreating the grand scene of the immortal-slaying sword formation established by the Heavenly Lord of Lingbao during the Battle of Ascension!</p><p>What made Qing Qiu’s heart palpitate even more was that the immortal slaying sword formation before him seemed to have fused with the Heaven’s secrets and Heaven’s secrets. It was like the end of the epoch had finally arrived. Even if all the other shore cultivators joined hands, they would still be unable to reverse this trend..</p><p>“Since the Gold Emperor took the initiative to make a move, isn’t he afraid that he will completely intensify the conflict and once again stir up the conflict between the other shore, completely exposing his trump card?”Qing Qiu did not dare to be careless. Her beautiful figure flashed as she retreated back to Yanling Island, suddenly, she recalled what had happened just now and had a new understanding of the current situation, “Why did the gold emperor, who endured and endured and retreated time and time again, suddenly become abnormal?”? With the celestial eradication sword formation being set up without anyone noticing, he had long been waiting to intensify the conflict and was prepared to start a war on the other shores here! “Is it because the last stronghold in the real world can not be lost, or did he plant some kind of trap, just waiting for other important figures to jump into the pit?”</p><p>In the Hollow Jade Temple, on the Fusang ancient tree, in the Western Paradise, in the Higan Daoist rite temples, pairs of eyes were cast toward the three clouds island, toward the immortal-slaying sword array that was completely set up and suppressed by the old man.</p><p>Sensing the arrival of the end of the world, Meng Qi stroked the ancient Daoist crown on his head and sighed inwardly:</p><p>The closer it was to the end of the world, the more terrifying the immortal-slaying sword array became.</p><p>The current gold emperor was still not as powerful as the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure during the Battle of Ascension. However, the immortal-slaying sword formation was stronger than it was then. Under the circumstances of cancelling each other out, the entire formation was almost the same. In other words.., only when the four true Nirvana realms worked together could they break this formation!</p><p>Of course, this did not mean that the immortal-slaying sword formation suppressed by the Gold Emperor was as powerful as the four normal Nirvana realms. In Meng Qi’s own condition, after flying out of the “Supreme boundless primordial Qi Qi Cloud”and slashing out the “True rulai”to join forces.., he could leisurely enter the formation, “Tour”it once, and then leave the formation intact without suffering any damage. However, this way, he could not break the formation and could not threaten the gold emperor!</p><p>At this time, he recalled the Numinous Treasure brand he had encountered at the highest level of the nine heavens, and recalled the phrase “I am the supreme during the final tribulation”!</p><p>As the saying goes, if the Numinous Treasure heavenly venerate returned, he would definitely be able to suppress the rest. He was the number one in the world. Perhaps, during the Battle of the ascension of the gods, the two Western Saints had chosen to join forces with the primordial beginning morality in order to suppress the numinous treasure as much as possible, he was trying his best to not fall into a passive position during the final tribulation..</p><p>Seeing the four swords of immortal slayer rise into streaks of red, green, black, and White Sword Light, outlining the aura of the end of the epoch, Meng Qi got rid of all the emotional interference and naturally got an idea:</p><p>“To break the immortal Slayer Sword Formation, I have to make the four swords of Immortal Slayer and the formation map belong to their respective owners. I can’t have them in the hands of the gold emperor who cultivates the ‘hometown of vacuum’!”</p><p>He believed that this was the first thought that every big figure on the other shore had when they witnessed the current scene. However, in order to break the immortal slaying sword formation, even if the current heavenly venerate of morality and Amitabha descended.., there still had to be the cooperation of an ancient figure on the other shore. In other words, in a short period of time, the Gold Emperor was able to hold off the three big figures by himself. Therefore.., the Celestial Emperor, the Devil Buddha, the monster of Heavenly Dao, and the Supreme True Buddha faced the remaining three other shores and had a chance to plot something.</p><p>The Gold Emperor had another purpose, and every other shore could see it. However, his posture was too good, and people could not help but want to dismantle the immortal-slaying sword formation and cut off a huge hidden danger!</p><p>This was an overt plot!</p><p>Looking at the future tributaries and sensing the possibility of his own occupation, Meng Qi could not find the hidden changes of the gold emperor. At this moment, a crane cry came from high in the sky, and the Golden Bridge fell across Heaven and earth. The western colored glass rose, and a huge Buddha condensed, the heavenly venerate of morality and Amitabha were about to descend.</p><p>It was not that they could not see that the Golden Emperor had other motives, but they had weighed the pros and cons and made this choice. They could bear a certain price for this!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
