Bull Demon King had never been to Bodhisattva Joy’s cave abode, nor had he drunk the water of love for three lifetimes, nor had he encountered the yin seed of a beautiful woman. However, Bodhisattva Joy still left the cave abode in a quarter of an hour according to the instructions of the Celestial Emperor, she tried to escape into the Sea of stars and hide in the immortal world.</p><p>As soon as she rose up, she suddenly heard a soft sigh. It seemed to come from the chaos, but it also seemed to reverberate in the future. She lamented the helplessness and complexity of using all the worlds in the universe as a chessboard and the fate of all living beings as chess pieces, even if she could “Regret chess”, there were times when she was at her wit’s end, and there were times when she could persist in doing what she should do but not doing it!</p><p>When the voice entered her heart, Bodhisattva Joy was inexplicably frightened. The world before her eyes suddenly darkened. A sleeve hung down from the high sky. It was vast and mighty, enveloping everything and everything. Then, the universe was established again!</p><p>Not punishing Nezha did not mean that Meng Qi did not do anything in this matter. He dared to scheme against Yu Xu’s disciples. Did he really think that the primeval lord of Heaven was someone who would swallow his anger and swallow his anger?</p><p>Especially the bodhisattva of joy who attacked directly. He would definitely not let him off!</p><p>The Bodhisattva of joy opened his sleeves and took over the world. Immediately, he fell into an indescribable darkness. At this moment, a little wave of light suddenly lit up. It was as if it jumped out from the illusory river of time soundlessly, it dyed the dry kun in his sleeves with a layer of emptiness. The clear light swam around, confusing the speed and speed. It reversed time.</p><p>The Heavenly Emperor made his move!</p><p>The darkness faded bit by bit. The sleeves followed the original trajectory and returned to the high sky. It was slow and heavy until it resisted the time blade’s “Rewind”of time and “Released”a happy bodhisattva with a blank expression.</p><p>The Blade’s light was lofty and seemed to resonate in all directions. It cut off the relationship between the sleeves and the river of time, making it unable to descend into the torrential river anymore, so it could not directly interfere with the real world.</p><p>The profundity of this blade was difficult to describe. It was enough to show how powerful the heavenly emperor was when he was suppressing the entire world!</p><p>In the dark and Gloomy Hollow Jade Palace, a streak of clear qi soared into the sky and transformed into a green and blue glazed Buddha. His right hand hung down, facing outwards, as if he was offering salvation to all living beings. At the same time, the sleeve was pulled back, a powerful fist with five fingers was revealed. It pulled and curled up space and time, bringing with it the earliest form of chaos, the limitless!</p><p>The Buddha’s light and the limitless descended together. It was dark yet not dark, bright yet not bright. It was immediately neutralized by the unpredictable time and brought about the lightness of the clouds and the clear blue sky.</p><p>After slashing out the true determination tathagata, Meng Qi was able to resist the heavenly emperor who had once dominated his entire life!</p><p>At that moment, a scroll flew out from the demon Emperor Palace. It contained mountains, rivers, the Sun, the Moon, and the stars. The Immortal Realm and the nine Nether World took the place of the reality around the bodhisattva of joy, wanting to seal her inside.</p><p>However, the sky suddenly turned dark red, and there were many vortexes. It was like one crazy and chaotic eye after another. A mysterious and strange small seal jumped out from the nine Netherworlds, causing the myriad worlds in the Mountain River Map to fall into reincarnation, it turned into a defense. The Devil Buddha and the Heavenly Dao Monsters worked together to block the scroll and the demon Saint Spear respectively!</p><p>For a moment, without the others from the other side intervening, the two sides were almost tied. It was difficult to change the current state of the bodhisattva of joy!</p><p>Meng Qi sat in the hollow jade palace, his gaze deep and unyielding.</p><p>Two to three hundred years ago, in the goddess realm, he sneaked into the palace of the Joy faction and attempted to kill Bodhisattva Jing Yan.</p><p>He raised his palm blade, and purple lightning swirled around it. It suddenly expanded and changed abruptly. The lightning that could only cut through the forbidden spell in front of him turned into a lightning that could destroy the world!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Half of the goddess realm was about to be drowned by the Sea of lightning. Every inch of the land of the line of joy was trembling. Feeling the “Fear”of being turned into ashes, the bodhisattva of joy, who was struggling to survive in the forbidden land, suddenly woke up. However, he felt that there was no escape!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A dull sound burst out. Waves of light poured down from the infinite height of the goddess realm, enveloping the lightning and making time reverse. The purple, white, green, and gold lightning of various colors condensed into the first point, neutralizing each other and vanishing into nothingness.</p><p>The battle between the two shores would not only be in the present, but would also continue to extend into the past. One side was trying to seize every opportunity, while the other was to eliminate any hidden dangers!</p><p>Such a battle was no longer something that the people of the sea of bitterness could observe, and there was no description of it in the world of understanding.</p><p>Rumble, Rumble, Rumble! The battle between Meng Qi and the Heavenly Emperor happened more than a thousand years ago, when the joyous lineage was rather glorious, and in the early Middle Ages, when they had not yet been taken in by the mystic maiden lineage, when they perished in the heavenly court.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Hundreds of thousands of years ago, in the purple bamboo forest in the South China Sea.</p><p>The Benevolent and Compassionate Bodhisattva Guanyin sat on a lotus throne and explained the Heart Sutra to the virgins and Arhat Vajra in the Pure Land. Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled in the outside world, and heavy rain poured down. Sometimes it was dark, and sometimes it was brilliant, it was as if the end of the world had arrived.</p><p>The Wuji Seal, the heaven opening seal, the Purple Lightning Divine Thunder, and the Tathagata divine palm were used one after another. They fought fiercely with the celestial emperor, who had three lives and three lifetimes under his sword, outside the purple bamboo forest, above the thirty-three heavens, meanwhile, the monster emperor, the demon Buddha, and the Heavenly Dao monsters were in a stalemate at the current juncture.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>With the sound of thunder, all living things went dormant. Inside the purple bamboo forest, a young girl’s body trembled. Her eyes rolled around, and they were pitch-black and charming. She secretly looked at the brilliant lightning that was swallowed by the sparkling rain in the blink of an eye.</p><p>She was unable to concentrate on listening to the Buddhist scriptures to begin with, and at this moment, she was even more unable to concentrate. She thought of her own insights and the experience she had when she secretly descended to the lower realm the last time. She thought of the joy of having both her physical and mental cultivation bases satisfied, and she actually felt hot.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>This girl did not feel any sense of danger. There was no wind or thunder in the purple bamboo forest. It was calm and peaceful.</p><p>When both sides were almost on par in strength, it was obvious that the other side would gain an advantage if they did not allow the change to happen!</p><p>If they could not kill the bodhisattva of joy at the moment, they could not do it in the past either!</p><p>At this moment, the white-clothed scholar sitting on the lotus throne suddenly turned his gaze towards this girl. Purple Lightning flashed in the depths of his eyes, and he spoke solemnly,</p><p>“Evil creature!”</p><p>She pointed her finger right between the girl’s brows.</p><p>The eyes of the joyful Bodhisattva when he was young were filled with confusion. He could not believe that the benevolent Bodhisattva would kill him for no reason!</p><p>He had only violated a few unimportant commandments. At most, he would be expelled from the sect. He would not die..</p><p>The light waves in the outside world suddenly flourished. However, they were swallowed by a seemingly endless chaos and reinforced by layers of glazed Buddha light.</p><p>This time, it was Meng Qi’s turn to defend!</p><p>A few hundred years ago, when Meng Qi first entered Tianzhu Mountain and paid his respects to the immortal demon god, when he traveled back in time from the Netherworld and came to the gap between the two worlds to ask the Immortal Demon God.., however, he took out the purple lightning-dazzling overlord blade from his sleeve and activated a seal. He hid it from the sky and passed it over to the immortal demon god.</p><p>The Immortal Demon God flew out his true spirit and used it to travel back in time. By relying on their connection, he temporarily occupied the golden body of the merciful and Merciful Bodhisattva. At the critical moment, he shouted, “Evil creature, clean the door!” He made Meng Qi take the initiative!</p><p>He pointed at the center of his brows. The color was empty, and the empty was the color. The child-like bodhisattva of joy was enveloped in an invisible flame with confusion and fear. She was burned to ashes and no trace was left.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The river of time suddenly roared and surged violently. The figures of the bodhisattva of joy in history all turned into dreams and Phantoms. The orthodoxy she left behind was also like a spring dream. There were no traces of her waking up, and it spread all the way to the near ancient times, it spread to the current node. There were no flesh-and-sex-giving heavenly daughters in the world, and there was no classic division of large and small steps of medicinal dregs and snacks. It was just that when time stopped, other orthodoxies were born correspondingly, partially replacing the role of the lineage of joy, it did not make much of a difference in history.</p><p>At the current node, fear appeared on the face of Bodhisattva Joy. His body suddenly became illusory, and even the traces were about to disappear.</p><p>Those who plotted against the hollow jade temple, how could they not pay the price!</p><p>The long river of time surged and separated into a few new futures.</p><p>At this moment, the cold snort of the heavenly emperor rang out from high in the sky. The wave light condensed into a ball and crashed down, enveloping the illusory figure of Bodhisattva Joy. It turned illusory into real and traced forward, creating a brand-like figure, it changed the river of time.</p><p>The brand continued to go against the river of time. The bodhisattva of joy “This time”was no longer a virgin under Guanyin. Instead, he was the target of the harvest from the temple of joy. However, his talent was extraordinary and overturned the universe. Instead, he absorbed many eminent monks from the temple of joy, after betraying the sect, he obtained many ancient orthodoxies. Finally, Meng Qi became a legend before he reached the other shore.</p><p>The other shore was to erase the past and change history, but the celestial emperor could fake the past to maintain his existence!</p><p>But this was also a backlash for him, and it was not something that he could easily use.</p><p>The body of the bodhisattva of joy returned to reality and came back to life. However, the traces of the past were all fake, and there was naturally no way for him to go any further in the future!</p><p>Seeing this, Meng Qi withdrew his sleeves and the Overlord Blade, allowing the Undying Demon God to return to its original path. Of course, she was also awakened by this.</p><p>Then, sitting in the hollow jade temple, Meng Qi, who was bright and round, cast his gaze towards Han Guang, who was pretending to be a shaolin abbot!</p><p>Han Guang, who was hiding in the primal shard, suddenly felt his heart palpitate, and his hair stood on end.</p><p>However, at this time, the vacuum hometown that had fused with the Netherworld had a bright and clear light sprinkling down, making everything tense and formless.</p><p>PS: There are some things, tonight that chapter leave, the day after tomorrow to make up ~</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
