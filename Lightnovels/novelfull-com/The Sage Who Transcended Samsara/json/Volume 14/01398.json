This made me clear one thing, it wasn’t that Buddha, who relied on the construction wood fruit and the original technique of reducing emptiness to become a restricted and incomplete dao fruit, didn’t have the ability to attack. It was just that he was heavily restrained and could only attack once in a disaster, therefore, he had conspired with the primordial Lord of Heaven and the others to seek the final escape!</p><p>Knowing this, how could I not be prepared for the Buddha’s suppression at the critical moment of the final calamity? Therefore, I turned a blind eye to mother Wusheng’s evil intentions and pretended not to have any guesses about her trump card. I was just waiting for her to jump out and attract the Buddha’s only chance to make a move and exhaust the three Pure Ones’trump card!</p><p>However, who would have thought that the monster Emperor would make a mistake? Feng XI actually survived until now and gave herself the most fatal blow!</p><p>I painstakingly went from a few epochs before becoming a celestial emperor to the chaos that suppressed the entire world, from the thrilling experience of hiding from the heavens and crossing the sea to the arrangement of plotting step by step until I didn’t even let go of myself, only to receive such an ending?</p><p>I wasn’t willing!</p><p>Facing the silent roar of the Devil Buddha, Meng Qi, who was standing at the bow of the ship, held the handle of the absolute blade in his right hand. He felt a little touched but was unusually determined to slash out this overbearing blade that came from the Devil Buddha who became a devil Buddha himself.</p><p>Who would be willing to be killed by you?</p><p>Qing Yun rushed out from the top of his head, setting off the Pan Gu banner that looked like an axe but was not an axe. It made the illusory dao fruit fly down and merge with the long blade.</p><p>Purple Lightning flashed and cut through the boundless darkness, splitting open the void that had no past, present, and future. The exhausted Devil Buddha could not stop the momentum of reopening the world even though he had combined the nine forms of Tathagata and reverse palm into one.</p><p>The Darkness parted, and the Devil Buddha sat in the lotus position at the bottom of the Fusang ancient tree. The life force in his eyes faded and disappeared crazily. Only the last of his vicissitudes and emotions were left. There was no regret, no guilt, and he murmured,</p><p>“If you can not become a dao fruit in life, you will die a dao fruit in death!”</p><p>His voice reverberated, and the devil body disintegrated. It was as if he had turned into an illusory bubble at the end of the Archaic era, leaving only the illusory dao fruit of eradication. An instant later, the illusory dao fruit of eradication also disintegrated, leaving only the will of eradication and the feeling of Doomsday, it turned into an inexplicable stream of light and shot toward Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi reached out to grab it, and the space between his eyebrows split open. Chaos churned, and the infinite was revealed, assimilating and devouring the stream of light.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The four seas collapsed, as if there was a sinkhole. The mountains of the Southern Wilderness and the western region collapsed. The earth turned to ash, and the dark clouds in the sky were stained with blood. Streaks of scarlet lightning tore through space and time.</p><p>The fall of the Devil Buddha, the collapse of Heaven and earth!</p><p>The fall of the other shore had its own phenomenon. and at this moment, it brought the end of the epoch. It announced in advance that all the worlds in the universe were about to be destroyed!</p><p>The Heavenly Emperor, who was still burning his dao fruit to confine his soul and travel to the Western world, smiled when he saw this. Finally, his figure disappeared. The time blade turned into pieces of light and scattered in all directions, as if it was about to fall apart, all that was left was the withered and scorched wood.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Raindrops fell. They were blood-red as if the sky was crying. The Sun, the Moon, and the stars in the sky broke through the darkness and crashed into the real world. All the immortal caves in the ancient star area were moved out. There was no way out, they could only escape to the hollow jade temple and integrate into the doomsday boat.</p><p>At this moment, the vision of Gu Xiaosang’s other shore that illuminated the immemorial epoch disappeared. However, different visions of different Great Dao appeared. There were 9,990 of them. They interweaved into a grand doomsday scene that complemented the surrounding environment, they complemented each other.</p><p>The third type of the vision of the other shore was the end of no life!</p><p>After the end of no life was the time around the body. Gu Xiaosang, who had both the limitless and the end of the two great dao fruits, directly went back to the immemorial era. He went back to the time when Huang Laojun ruled the world. He was only one step away from the old man, he successfully “Saw the beginning”and verified the vision.</p><p>At this moment, the Golden Emperor, who was suppressed by the Bodhi magical tree, suddenly moved. The “Six soul banner”in front of him flashed with a strange light. It was not outward, but inward.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The six souls banner exploded. A dark light burst forth, and the end spread out, shattering the glass.</p><p>The Golden Emperor had actually given up on this treasure. He had used this opportunity to open a gap between the flowing clear light of the Bodhi tree and escape.</p><p>He seemed to have given up. All he wanted was to escape!</p><p>..</p><p>The Darkness created by the Devil Buddha faded away, but the myriad worlds in the universe were also in a state of collapse. Meng Qi’s eyes were half-opened, and a gust of clear air suddenly shot out from the top of his head. It was divided into three parts. There was the pure and smiling true rulai, there was the handsome and carefree Lord Qingyuan, as well as the sharp-eyed celestial master Su Meng in his white robe.</p><p>He had also successfully stepped into the ranks of the weak nirvana!</p><p>Guided by this, the ancient glazed lamp, the point of infinite chaos, and the flag of Pangu, which looked like an axe but was not an axe, appeared at the same time. They combined and formed a complete embryonic dao fruit.</p><p>As soon as the dao fruit was formed, Meng Qi’s figure directly moved forward along the turbulent river of time. He broke through the central celestial emperor, Old Lord Huang, and the other epochs, and was about to enter the era of primordial chaos, which was the beginning of the creation of the world. He became an ancient man.</p><p>..</p><p>The Golden Emperor escaped. His aura was much weaker, and he was obviously severely injured. However, he did not hide. He flashed into the air and hung the bright moon in the abnormal vision on the other side. When Gu Xiaosang had just witnessed the abnormal vision of “Seeing the beginning”.., he stretched out a white, slender finger and pointed it at the center of her brows.</p><p>The finger was covered with a clear light, and the tip was chaotic. It was like the beginning and the end. He poked it out firmly without hesitation, just like the two indifferent eyes in the bright moon.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang looked at this scene in a daze, and for a moment, she could not react.</p><p>Was the gold emperor crazy?</p><p>Was he crazy? When Heaven and earth were created, Amitabha, who was involved with the heavenly venerate of morality, showed a rare look of astonishment.</p><p>He had never seen anyone trying to kill the other shore that he had created to reduce the amount of time he had spent!</p><p>Could it be that when the gold emperor saw the Buddha making a move, the situation of the three pure ones could not be reversed, and he had suffered a heavy blow himself, so he might as well break out of his shell and absorb the products that he had just created to reduce the amount of time he had spent on the other shore, recovering the heavy blow he had suffered, and elevating him to the most ancient state.., to lay a solid foundation for surviving until the next era?</p><p>This change was really unexpected. Amitabha wanted to stop it again, but it was too late. Because the end had come, the time there was already chaotic, blurred, and difficult to trace back!</p><p>Facing the finger of the gold emperor, Gu Xiaosang of course would not sit still and wait for death. She pointed out a finger with both doubt and hatred in her heart. The same end, the same lifeless finger!</p><p>Now, I am also the other shore. I will no longer be controlled by you!</p><p>The two equally delicate fingers collided. Gu Xiaosang’s expression suddenly changed because the power of the finger of the metal emperor was empty. It was like suicide!</p><p>She looked at the pair of eyes in the bright moon in surprise. She saw that the aloof and indifferent eyes were still there, but there was an additional sense of liberation.</p><p>Liberation?</p><p>The lifeless finger absorbed crazily. The metal emperor did not resist at all. He was instantly assimilated into chaos and turned into a stream of light. He threw himself into the three great illusory dao fruits that Gu Xiaosang had formed.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The sky collapsed and the earth cracked. The Metal Emperor Fell, and the end of the phenomenon reappeared. Gu Xiaosang instinctively pointed, and the Buddhist kingdom on Earth in the territory of the Great Zhou flew out, throwing it toward the boat of Doomsday.</p><p>At the same time, her three illusory dao fruits entangled together and took shape. Her figure crossed the era of Lord Huang’s rule, broke through the previous layers of barriers, and came to the era of the creation of heaven and earth, she became an ancient and also saw Meng Qi who came here almost at the same time.</p><p>However, she had been in a trance and was abnormally confused.</p><p>Did the gold emperor fall just like that?</p><p>Did he simply die in her hands just like that?</p><p>As this thought flashed through her mind, an idea suddenly flashed through her mind, and her gaze could not help but freeze:</p><p>“Now that I have obtained the embryonic form of the dao fruit and become an ancient, it also means that if the gold emperor and Amitabha are not weakened, they will almost be the same as the dao fruit..</p><p>“Although the Golden Emperor had already fallen before this, the doomsday is crazy, time is chaotic, and everything is blurry. Moreover, the two things are directly related to each other, so there is a possibility that the cause and effect will be disrupted!”</p><p>“More importantly, those who obtain the dao fruit do not need to follow logic!”</p><p>The sense of relief in the Golden Emperor’s eyes just now was actually a derision that was about to transcend?</p><p>His six soul banner was clearly in front of his husband, taking Amitabha and the heavenly venerate of morality. Did he also expect Buddha to make a move?</p><p>This..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
