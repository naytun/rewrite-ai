Meng Qi’s eyes returned to normal. Countless things flooded into his mind and he instantly understood the cause and effect. On the surface, he maintained a leisurely smile as he raised his finger, he exchanged blows with Ren Qiushui’s probing.</p><p>Next, he had to do his best to maintain this period of history so that the big figures on the other shore would not “Notice”anything unusual.</p><p>I knew that you would know, but I pretended not to know.</p><p>..</p><p>Time was like water. Time had changed. In the 37th year of tianle, Ning Xin City.</p><p>The assassin from the House of No Mercy who had just killed Lin Kang, the sect leader of the Heaven and Earth sect, was running towards the window. He was neither tall nor short, neither strong nor thin. He was just like everyone else, but he was unusually certain of the outcome. He did not doubt that he would fail.</p><p>Suddenly, his pupils constricted as he saw the window in front of him open silently. Standing outside with his hands behind his back was a handsome man in green robes. His eyes were as deep as the sea, suffused with spots of purple light that caused one’s heart to palpitate and hallucinate, then, he raised his slender and powerful right hand and pressed it on his forehead, which he had taken the initiative to throw over.</p><p>“An immortal caresses my head, tying my hair and bestowing immortality.”</p><p>His deep and demonic voice had a hint of mockery for some reason.</p><p>..</p><p>During the ancient era, when he traveled to the west, Thunder and fire collided, and the heavens collapsed. The Heavenly Court was about to fall.</p><p>Meng Qi’s figure was looking up at the sky, at the Dark Red Sky, and at the terrifying eyes that were filled with chaos and coldness!</p><p>The strange eyes seemed to sense something, and the irregular vortex seemed to change slightly, as if it was looking over.</p><p>With just a glance, Meng Qi’s figure suddenly felt his heart beating wildly. Every thought, every thought, was trying to be independent.</p><p>At this moment, a hint of purple appeared in his eyes. It was strange, inexplicable, and extremely mysterious. It was actually not much inferior to the eyes of the monster of the Heavenly Dao. All the chaos and all the madness vanished into thin air.</p><p>Their eyes met, and their gazes collided. However, time began to flow backward, and the Quiet River turned into a roaring sea of anger.</p><p>..</p><p>With the seven kills Stele’s concealment, instead of the two supreme weapons with strong personal colors, the absolute saber and the Human Emperor Sword, Meng Qi located the history related to himself in the real world and planted the traces left behind in the past into the supreme mental demon, he used it as a “Road sign”to reach the other shore in the future, “Illuminating”the Endless Sea of pain.</p><p>Inside the Emperor of the Dead’s ruin, the seven kills Daoist crossed his long sword on his knees with his eyes closed. He seemed to have no interest in Meng Qi’s actions at all.</p><p>The dark, colorless sword exuded an almost unparalleled killing intent. It took away the life force of all living things around Daoist seven kills. Even the “Past figures”in the illusory river around him were killed one after another, only the corresponding traces were left. Every moment, Daoist seven kills seemed to be dying, and then he returned with the power of the Netherworld Sea Sword.</p><p>Evil things were difficult to grasp!</p><p>However, they had their own unique strengths, just like the demon emperor’s claws, which were filthy, strange, mysterious, and concealing.</p><p>Suddenly, the seven kills Daoist opened his eyes, which were filled with the boredom of the mortal world. He said in a low voice,</p><p>“He also explored the various possibilities of occupying the future?”</p><p>..</p><p>Above the eastern sea, the blue waves were endless, and there were countless islands.</p><p>Ji Xing returned to his birthplace in a gorgeous turreted boat. He was surrounded by friends and companions, which showed his status in the jianghu.</p><p>“This island doesn’t even have a name. It looks ordinary, but I didn’t expect it to have someone like you, Young Master Ji,”a friend said with a fawning smile.</p><p>Ji Xing looked at the shabby village and the small half of the mountain peak in front of him. He took off his cape and threw it to his companion, saying seriously, “Please Wait a moment. I will go and pay my respects to my teacher.”</p><p>After saying that, without waiting for any reply, he strode up the mountain path and headed toward the depths of the mountain range that seemed to have been struck by lightning. There was a thatched cottage where his teacher lived in seclusion.</p><p>After seeing Ji Xing’s back disappear at the end of the road, the person who spoke just now clicked his tongue and sighed:</p><p>“I wonder who young master Ji’s master is. To be able to teach such a hero like him, he must be someone from the immortal class, right?”</p><p>Someone at the side immediately echoed, “The island owners of the seventy-two islands nearby all treat young master Ji with utmost respect. They often ask the old man how he’s doing. It’s obvious that they’re in awe of the master behind him and don’t dare to provoke him. If he’s not someone from the immortal class, with their high standards, how could he be like this?”</p><p>“Young Master Ji is such a character yet he’s unknown and lives in seclusion on this island. It’s no wonder that we’re ignorant.”</p><p>“Yes, yes, but perhaps he was famous in this sea area when he was at his peak?”</p><p>..</p><p>The discussions drifted into Ji Xing’s sharp ears. He smiled slightly and did not care.</p><p>Yes, if he had not met his master who lived in seclusion here, where would he have learned a world-shaking ultimate technique? It was unknown how much higher it was than most of the island owners’treasured “Spark great art”!</p><p>Similarly, if he didn’t have his master, how could he have obtained the respect and respect of the 72 island owners? He hadn’t been in danger ever since he set foot in the pugilistic world?</p><p>Before he left the island, he had always thought that his master was a down and out martial artist. He was disheartened by his adventure in the pugilistic world, so he lived in seclusion here and didn’t care about the affairs of the world. However, as he traveled through this sea area, his knowledge gradually increased, every day, he refreshed his understanding of his master. He was so unfathomable, so majestic. Every time he thought that he had roughly understood his realm, strength, and status in the past, he would be overturned by the new bits and pieces of speculations.</p><p>In the end, he could only sigh with emotion. His master was really like a divine dragon in the clouds, whose head was nowhere to be seen. He just needed to understand that he was very, very powerful.</p><p>His footsteps were faster, and his desire to return was like an arrow. Ji Xing soon saw the thatched cottage. It was a thatched cottage that even he himself could not enter. Outside stood a black and strong man respectfully. It was the island owner of the nearby Zhou Liu Island, there were a few great grandmasters in this area of the sea.</p><p>“I’ll accept the gift. You can leave.”Ji Xing heard his master’s familiar voice.</p><p>Zhou Liu Island’s Island owner was overjoyed. It seemed that Ji Xing’s master had given him a great deal of face by accepting his gift. He bowed repeatedly and left in high spirits. He did not forget to give ji Xing a few words of encouragement.</p><p>Ji Xing Strode to the front of the straw hut and bowed to the ground. He kowtowed three times and said excitedly,</p><p>“Unworthy disciple greets Master.”</p><p>The person in the straw hut was silent for a moment before he sighed and said, “It’s not bad. I’ve heard of what you’ve done from the island lords. Even if you have an air of arrogance and extravagance, in the end, you haven’t abandoned your martial arts or abandoned my teachings.”</p><p>“I often recall master’s words. I don’t dare to forget them!”For some reason, Ji Xing was covered in cold sweat as he hurriedly spoke.</p><p>The voice of the person in the thatched cottage suddenly sounded more ancient, “Since you’ve passed the test, I will officially put you on the door wall today. I will also inform you of the current situation of your sect and my true identity.”</p><p>“Thank you, Master!”Ji Xing was just like the island lord of Zhou Liu Island just now. He was overjoyed and the corners of his eyes were filled with excitement.</p><p>With a creak, Ji Xing heard the figure of the door opening. He looked up and saw the scene inside the straw hut.</p><p>His slightly skinny master seemed to have not experienced the erosion of time. He still maintained the appearance of a scholarly middle-aged man. He could vaguely see a few strands of silver hair and the tiredness at the corners of his eyes. His realm was as usual, and he could not tell the depth of it.</p><p>“My name is he mu. During the past hundred years of traveling in the Eastern Sea, the most well-known nickname of the world is ‘The Heaven lacking sword’,”ji Xing’s master said calmly.</p><p>He Mu? The heaven lacking sword? Ji Xing was stunned when he heard that. He could not believe it.</p><p>This was the most famous sword immortal in the Eastern Sea decades ago. It was said that he had already reached the Earth immortal realm in the past, and he was actually his master?</p><p>It was really unexpected!</p><p>The master who lived in seclusion on the small island in front of him and lived a simple life was actually ‘The heaven lacking sword’he mu!</p><p>He Mu ignored ji Xing’s reaction and said to himself, “I was born in the Holy Land of Taoism more than a hundred years ago, the Jade Void Palace of Mount Kunlun. You will be officially listed as a member of the sect if you come to pay your respects to the founder. In the future, you will meet your martial uncles and Martial Sisters.”</p><p>Ji Xing had heard of the hollow jade temple of Mount Kunlun even after more than a hundred years. He vaguely knew that it was related to the universal sign of knowledge. It was an extremely illustrious sect that could be called the Holy Land of Taoism. However, for some unknown reason, it declined later on, it disappeared into the long river of history.</p><p>He did not expect that his master was born in the hollow jade temple of Mount Kunlun!</p><p>He did not expect that he would be related to this ancient Holy Land of Taoism!</p><p>He retracted his thoughts, stood up solemnly, and stepped into the straw hut.</p><p>As he mu stepped aside, he saw two statues worshipped. At the top, it said “Yuqing Primordial Heavenly Venerate”, and at the bottom, it said “Yuan emperor Su Meng”.</p><p>“The founder of our sect is Yuan emperor celestial venerate, and your Grandmaster Yuan emperor celestial venerate is the second generation disciple, the current sect master,”he mu introduced solemnly and respectfully.</p><p>The heavenly venerate of origin, Su Meng? Ji Xing’s mouth slowly opened.</p><p>This name was not unfamiliar to him at all. It was said that he was the first almighty in the real world to prove himself in the modern era. Later on, he ascended to the Destiny Realm and became a great divine ability user, stirring up the winds and clouds of the world, the Universal Knowing Talisman was his casual work, which had been missed by several generations until now.</p><p>As for the great divine arts practitioner, he was separated from the jianghu he lived in by countless layers of heaven and earth. For him, having such a grandmaster suddenly was like a dream!</p><p>It was so wonderful that it didn’t seem real!</p><p>He had thought that the Master of an Earth immortal or a heaven immortal was already incredible. Just looking at the attitude of the island lord of Zhou Liu Island, it was obvious that such a powerful master was respectful to the Grandmaster’s name!</p><p>“Grandmaster, isn’t Grandmaster said to have fallen?”Ji Xing suddenly thought of this matter.</p><p>He Mu said indifferently, “Grandmaster hasn’t fallen. If he returns, he will definitely shock the heavens.”</p><p>Ji Xing didn’t ask any more questions. He swallowed with difficulty and began the initiation ceremony according to He Mu’s instructions.</p><p>When both of their gazes left the statue of the origin emperor, a hint of purple suddenly appeared in the eyes of the clay puppet.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
