The pure white palm holding the bronze axe was pulled back.</p><p>For the Gold Emperor, he did not succeed this time, but he did not fail either. The outcome was beyond the future that he had. He had to re-understand the mystery behind the completion of the “Cause of all fruits”, he had to figure out how terrifying it was when it was combined with the infinite seal.</p><p>As for anger, frustration, and other emotions, they never existed and would never come. The general situation was still under his control. The stronger Gu Xiaosang was, the closer he was to the dao fruit until he succeeded. The scene before him was just a small detail, it was like watching a butterfly falling into layers of spider webs. The more it struggled, the tighter it was bound.</p><p>At this moment, the ocean of Buddha and the Higan golden bridge had yet to fade away. There were many black shadows around the hollow jade temple. It was as if the end of the world had come. The epoch had fallen, but it was repeatedly cut open by the purple light that split the heaven and earth apart, the chaotic dark red and glazed Buddhist light inside was revealed.</p><p>The Supreme True Buddha, who had revealed his hidden strength and was able to infect all the self-generated dharma bodies of Buddhism, was shrouded in the purest light. It was as brilliant as the ripples of water, as if it was the resentment in its heart, “I have done it for nothing again…” Not only had maitreya been “Absorbed”by Gu Xiaosang from the past, even the “Medicine Master King Buddha”had become the “True rulai of Tranquility”created by the primordial Lord of Heaven, Su Meng. Even his own Buddha had not been able to “Retrieve”it, if it were not for the benevolence of the metal emperor, who had given him the golden body molt of Tang Sanzang in advance and perfected his own Nirvana realm, he would have really been played like a monkey.</p><p>On the Green Lotus flag outside the land of Buddha, the Fu Emperor who had been shaken by the imprints of Amitabha in his body was still a little stiff. He was like a marionette that had temporarily lost control and was trying his best to recover his original will.</p><p>At this moment, a knife light lit up behind his back. It was like water and wind, ethereal and difficult to understand, just like the long river of time that flowed quietly.</p><p>The blade light flashed, and before all the other shores could react, it penetrated through the layers of obstacles and entered Emperor Fu’s body!</p><p>With a boom, the entire sky was filled with waves of light, as if the river of time had set off a monstrous tide. It surged out from Emperor Fu’s dao body continuously, mixed with broken and dreamy golden ten thousand characters. The glass was dim and empty, it disappeared in a flash.</p><p>With just a thought, the Amitabha Buddha brand in Emperor Fu’s body was forcefully destroyed. Such a divine ability could be said to be boundless. Even if it was inferior to Amitabha Buddha and the heavenly venerate of morals.., it was similar to the current three corpses of the ancient Bodhi Buddha!</p><p>“Heavenly emperor…”the bright and full moon shone with a clear light. The Heavenly Punishment Axe that had just been withdrawn returned to the world.</p><p>The one who ambushed Fu Huang turned out to be the mysterious and hidden heavenly emperor!</p><p>This supreme-being who had dominated the world in ancient times had once again stepped onto the “Stage”, announcing his return in such a way!</p><p>“Burn!””Devour!””Destroy!””Punish!””Kill!””Silence!””No!””Freeze!””Destroy!”Nine Dao patterns danced in the air. The Heavenly Punishment Axe had just slashed out when it landed on Fu Huang’s head, disregarding the layers of light.</p><p>The time was receding, and the Void was replaying itself. However, no matter how emperor Fu dodged, the Heavenly Punishment Axe was still locked on him.</p><p>Suddenly, Emperor Fu’s eyes flashed with light. It was extremely faint, as if it contained all the illusory rivers in the universe. A powerful, terrifying, and supreme aura shot up into the sky, connecting the heaven and earth, allowing the nine heavens to appear layer by layer, if it did not disappear, it would be suspended in an unknown place!</p><p>The heavenly punishment axe fell and struck his body. However, everything turned into light spots, converging into a long river, surging into the void, and disappearing without a trace.</p><p>The influence of this change, as well as the Supreme True Buddha’s all-out suppression of true determination tathagata, the Devil Buddha pulled himself out, bringing the monster of the Heavenly Dao into the chaos.</p><p>He took one last look at where Fu Huang’s body was, and his eyes were filled with boiling dark fire.</p><p>He had expected that with Han Guang’s hint, the heavenly emperor would swallow the bait and make an early appearance, making all of Su Meng’s plans come to naught and trapping him in the encirclement of the three other shores. Who would have thought that the heavenly emperor would be able to endure until the end.., he would rather miss it than be absolutely sure!</p><p>It seemed that after the lessons of the ancient times, the Heavenly Emperor had also changed and become more and more difficult to deal with!</p><p>At the lowest level of the Netherworld, in the ruins of the Netherworld Sea, the demon lord sat in a lotus position with his eyes half-open. When the battle on the other side of the world entered its climax, he suddenly opened his eyes and his will sank into something.</p><p>However, there was a figure in his line of sight. He wore a fan and a cloud crown, a water suit, and a pair of shoes. His waist was tied with silk, and he looked elegant and handsome. His entire body was covered in a layer of blood-red light, and he was followed by a dejected black dog, he held the Wuji Apricot Flag in the center of the world in his hand, and the corners of his mouth curled into a teasing smile. It was none other than true Lord Qingyuan Miaodao, Yang Jian.</p><p>Yang Jian said with a smile, “Demon Lord, you’re in a good mood.”</p><p>“You’re not bad either.”The demon lord closed his eyes again, as if his awakening had only been alarmed by the battle on the other shore.</p><p>..</p><p>“Mercy, Mercy, gain, and loss.”</p><p>Amitabha’s deep voice echoed through the world, and all the strange phenomena and fluctuations vanished without a trace. After falsifying history, not a single place in the real world was destroyed, not a single living creature was affected. Only the Buddhist kingdom on Earth was filled with white lotuses, there was an additional sense of home in the vacuum, making the original believers of the LUOISM begin to believe that the two religions were originally one, and in Changle city.., the Fat Monk Chang Kai, who was sitting on the lotus throne, had become the exquisite, ethereal, and solemn Gu Xiaosang two or three hundred years ago. His white dress was fresh, and divine light lingered around it.</p><p>In the Western Paradise, the eight treasures virtue pool bubbled and formed a golden bodhisattva with a fat head, big ears, and a cloth bag hanging from his waist. It was Maitreya, who had re-formed his dharma body. However, his past, present, sarira, and his great wish for the future.., his realm of perfection in creation had all been lost.</p><p>Amitabha had achieved enlightenment quite early, but it was too late to reduce and seek emptiness. Just like the primordial Lord of Heaven, through the experience and lessons of the Venerable Daoist and the Buddha, he had found a more suitable and relatively perfect technique. It was not to directly cut Maitreya, instead, it was to support Maitreya so that he could inherit the wishes of the past, the future, the three relics of the present, and the Buddha Kingdom on Earth to save all living beings. Then, through some secret techniques, Maitreya became the product of reducing and seeking emptiness. In other words.., after Gu Xiaosang absorbed the descending Maitreya, even if a little bit of Maitreya’s spiritual light was regenerated with the help of the eight treasures merit pool, it would not affect the situation.</p><p>This was like Meng Qi. Before he reached the other shore, if someone traced back history and got the Dao one seal before him, he would no longer be the product of the primordial beginning Celestial Master’s reducing and seeking emptiness. Life and death, reincarnation and rebirth would not affect the primordial beginning Celestial Master, none of this would affect the primordial beginning Celestial Master. However, once he broke free from the sea of bitterness, his past and future would remain the same. At that time, he would always be himself, the product of the primordial beginning Celestial Master’s practice of reducing and seeking emptiness. It was not something that could be changed by devouring or snatching.</p><p>Maitreya walked out of the eight treasures merit pool and sat down cross-legged. His expression became a little more relaxed, and there were also a lot of gloominess. The reason Amitabha agreed to this exchange was because he saw that he had no hope of succeeding at the last moment, however, all the years of hard work had gone to waste. It was almost impossible to reach the other shore in this era. Any powerful supernatural being would find it hard to stay calm.</p><p>..</p><p>Kunlun’s field, inside the hollow jade temple.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang rested her chin on her hand and watched the three treasures ruyi fly back into Meng Qi’s palm. She smiled and said, “It’s a pity that you almost have another wife.”</p><p>The “Holy Mother White Lotus”that she had slashed out was a combination of Buddhism and the divine path. It was formed by absorbing Maitreya’s relics in the past, present, and future. It was a white lotus that was born from the aura of her own corpse. It was neither a Buddhist body nor a divine path body, it was also not a divine path body, but an incarnation that did not have its own consciousness. That was why Meng Qi almost had a wife.</p><p>Meng Qi was calm, but his skin was already thick. “Don’t worry, I can turn the three pure ones into one.”</p><p>“But it can only last for a short time,”Gu Xiaosang said with a low laugh, as if she was in a good mood because she did not follow the script of the metal emperor this time.</p><p>After a period of time, Gu Xiaosang said lazily, “Hubby, are you going to Dou Shuai Palace next?”</p><p>“I hid it from Martial Uncle Dao de previously. I have to go and see him after the matter is over.”Meng Qi nodded slightly, “Moreover, the end of the epoch is getting closer and closer. Although I have temporarily surpassed the Devil Buddha, it will become stronger bit by bit with the intensity of the end of the world. On the other hand, I have the shackle of Medicine Master Wang Fo. I’m afraid that I can’t catch up with him in terms of improvement.”</p><p>“Therefore, Yang Jian stayed in the Netherworld to prevent the Devil Buddha from quietly refining the Netherworld and becoming a real world-destroying devil, a symbol of the end of the epoch,”Gu Xiaosang said with a smile. It was not a question, nor a question, but an affirmation.</p><p>Meng Qi looked down at the netherworld and said, “If the devil Buddha really becomes the symbol of the end of the epoch, even if it is not perfect, it should still be at the level of Amitabha. It is quite terrifying. I have to guard against it.”</p><p>However, this kind of power did not belong to itself. If there was a next era, the Devil Buddha would fall to another level.</p><p>“In addition, the state of the Heavenly Emperor is a little strange. He actually chose to occupy the body of Emperor Fu. I plan to return to the heavenly court and see the scene when he transformed into the saber of time,”Meng Qi said as he slowly stood up, he had already arrived outside the 33 heavens.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
