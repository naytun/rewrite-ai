Therefore, in the face of the current sect master of the Hollow Jade Temple, the newly advanced great divine arts practitioner.., he did not hesitate to crush an ancient and mottled jade pendant and passed the difficult problem he encountered to Lu Ya.</p><p>Lu Ya, who was in the archaic secret realm, had just heard about this. The first thought that came to his mind was to take this opportunity to kill Su Meng. He had just entered the serendipity realm and dared to come knocking on his door. He simply did not know the immensity of Heaven and earth. However, this thought disappeared in a flash, it did not cause any ripples because su meng represented not only himself.</p><p>He was the current sect master of the Hollow Jade Temple, a direct descendant of the original incipient Celestial Master. There were several great divine arts practitioners in the same sect. Guang Chengzi and Wen Shu, Celestial Master Guangfa, were among the nine venerables of Dao sect. They were not much inferior to him. In addition to the immortal slaying sword formation.., they were much stronger than his side.</p><p>Even if he couldn’t see the other experts of the hollow jade temple, he couldn’t rule out the possibility that they were just showing their weakness to the enemy. They were either hiding in the dark or waiting in other places. Once they were activated, they would immediately descend through the karma. If he attacked rashly.., the one who would fall was most likely not him but himself.</p><p>As the sect master, every word and action was often a manifestation of the will of a force!</p><p>Fearing this, Lu Ya sent a message to Yuan Hong through the broken jade pendant:</p><p>“The green touring palace has been moved away, and the forbidden technique of the Golden Ao Island has lost its core for a long time. Although it has been patched up and tried to perfect it for many years, there are still many loopholes. After all, it is not the other shore, nor is it a direct descendant of the Green Touring Palace. There is no way to completely understand the layout of this place and make up for it. If it is purely a defense, I am afraid that Su Meng will find out the problem. Why Don’t you take the opportunity when he has just entered the serendipity realm and is full of pride to provoke him into a one-on-one fight. I will use this arrangement to quietly move the Golden Ao Island away and hide in the real chaos.”</p><p>In a one-on-one fight, you quietly moved away the Golden Turtle Island? Isn’t this asking me to risk my life and cutting off my escape route? Yuan Hong was secretly resentful, but his innate spiritual light was controlled by others, and he couldn’t help it. He could only reluctantly say, “The Lord Daoist has ordered me, and I dare not disobey.”</p><p>Lu Ya was very experienced, so how could he not guess Yuan Hong’s mentality, he comforted him, “When you move away the Golden Turtle Island, I will inform you in advance. With your near-indestructible physical body, when Su Meng and the others were shocked by the change in the Golden Turtle Island and tried to stop it, would you still be afraid of not finding a chance to escape?”</p><p>Yuan Hong had always been proud of his strength and talent. Hearing this, he nodded slightly. “You are absolutely right.”</p><p>Before he could finish his words, his body trembled, and countless white hairs fell off. He transformed into one ape after another and pounced on various parts of Golden Turtle Island. He occupied the different pivotal points of the forbidden spell and used his doppelganger to control the formation.</p><p>Immediately after, a white rainbow soared into the sky and pierced through the forbidden spell to leave the island. His explosive shout completely swept away the surrounding time fog:</p><p>“Wu, that junior, do you dare to compete with me?”</p><p>Contempt, contempt, disdain, disdain, and other intentions were all mixed together. They were mixed with the heavenly devil divine ability, and they wanted to affect Meng Qi’s mind and make him lose his mind.</p><p>Meng Qi’s light golden body, which was larger than the Golden Ao Island, allowed the strong wind in the Void to blow past. It only flickered and no wounds could be seen. In his hand, he was holding a purple lightning long saber that was so heavy that it seemed to be the overlapping of countless universes. Hearing that, he laughed loudly:</p><p>“Just what I wanted. You are just a skeleton in a tomb. How many sabers can you block?”</p><p>His long hair flew in the air as he slashed out with his saber. The turbulence in the surroundings seemed to have a direction and rushed towards him at the same time. If he fell into this place and did not know the past and future, he would be doomed forever.</p><p>“Good!”Yuan Hong had not had such a chance to fight head-on for a long time. For a moment, it was as if he had returned to the time when he was in the god Ascension realm. Amidst his loud cries, he turned into a towering white ape, which was actually taller, bigger, and older than Meng Qi.</p><p>It brandished its black club with both hands, dragging along flickering dark sparks along the way. Each spark, if released into the starry sky of the universe, could devour countless brilliant galaxies.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sound of the collision made Meng Qi feel a little deafening. The sweeping storm made the world feel as if it had stopped for a moment. However, the space-time turbulence swallowed it silently and did not cause any chain changes.</p><p>One Man and one ape each took a few steps back and smashed up the debris of stars that had been floating here for billions of years. It was a draw.</p><p>“Again!”Meng Qi simply showed three heads and six arms, knife and Fist, Yuan Hong did not show any weakness, white ape is similar change, to carry the power of the sky pounced over.</p><p>Ta-da! Bang-bang-bang! Boom-boom!</p><p>The clash of swords and sticks, fist to fist, created an unknown number of chaotic holes that contained a world, and swept away everything nearby that could exist in the turbulence gap. If Jinao Island did not have a forbidden law to resist, it might not be able to escape the aftermath, even a man and an ape body is constantly rising light, white blood stains one after another, but the wounds are instantly squirming recovery, do not see the slightest injury.</p><p>On one side, Yuan Hong met a worthy opponent and fought to his heart’s content. On the other side, he was deliberately stalling for time. When he saw that he could not gain the upper hand in a head-on battle, he suddenly transformed into a human-faced snake body in the fierce collision, it was a crimson innate god candle dragon that wrote the word “Dao”.</p><p>The Candle Dragon opened his mouth and the color of the world changed. Time flowed out like water and slowed down the surroundings as if it was frozen. The seventy-two transformations revealed its power.</p><p>Meng Qi was not in a hurry. He had also turned into an enormous human-faced snake. He opened and closed his eyes. It was already the turn of spring and autumn. Time flew by quickly.</p><p>Everything became like a crystal, trapping the two candle dragons inside at the same time. Then, cracks appeared and collapsed abruptly.</p><p>The moment the ‘crystal’shattered, Yuan Hong changed again. He rose into the air and spread his wings, blocking the gaps between the chaotic streams of time. He curled his sharp beak slightly, giving off an intimidating aura.</p><p>He reached out his claws and reached out toward the torch dragon that Meng Qi had transformed into. It was a golden-winged ROC.</p><p>Although it was a little weaker than those of the same realm, it was just enough to restrain the dragon-snake race.</p><p>Meng Qi changed his body, and a handsome and beautiful five-colored Phoenix appeared on the spot.</p><p>The light and shadow behind it floated, forming the heaven, earth, yellow, exquisite pagoda, the scroll of morality, the book of Saint’s virtue, and other objects. They were connected to form the patterns of five virtues. Then, he raised his head and let out a light cry that spread to the nine heavens. The golden-winged ROC that Yuan Hong had transformed into was actually trembling, it had lost the feeling of ferocity and barbarity just now.</p><p>The Phoenix was the ancestor of the birds, the beginning of virtue. With a cry, a hundred birds would make a pilgrimage!</p><p>More importantly, Meng Qi had once collected the three virtues and cultivated the fist of Ruyi. Now, he had reversed the Wuji. The pattern of five virtues and its corresponding symbol were even more divine compared to Yuan Hong’s golden-winged ROC. It was closer to the original.</p><p>Yuan Hong rose up again. With a flash of light, he actually transformed into an innate ferocious spirit. The “Primal Chaos”in the center was like a giant dog. It had no seven orifices, no internal organs, and no virtue at all.</p><p>The moment the ‘Primal Chaos’appeared, it directly descended, wanting to swallow the phoenix into the pitch-black and despair that it had created.</p><p>However, with a flash of the blade’s light, it was like the first ray of light from the beginning of Heaven and earth. It seemed to have split apart the darkness, bringing with it the ancient flag of life. The ‘Primal Chaos’directly split apart from within and returned to the giant white ape.</p><p>The ‘Primal Chaos’in front of the Master of the heaven opening seal was simply like a giant axe in front of Lu Ban’s door!</p><p>The power of the blade did not decrease after splitting the chaos, and it had a special charm. It made Yuan Hong feel that all the futures were destined. He could not avoid this blade no matter what, and he immediately felt powerless and afraid.</p><p>Su Meng’s exploration of the other shore had reached such a level?</p><p>He could influence fate and possess the future?</p><p>After his trip to Zhixu Mountain, Meng Qi had been experiencing all these years. He had integrated all the gains related to the future into the blade of “Not seeking the afterlife.”Although it was not enough to truly possess all the possibilities of the future.., but also through the influence of fate, to create unavoidable potential, the potential that must happen!</p><p>Yuan Hong has always been Intrepid, instantly reinvigorated the flag and drum, shouted loudly, unexpectedly met this knife to fly past.</p><p>Kacha!</p><p>Yuan Hong’s body is divided into two pieces, but the light rises, the lotus flower opens and closes, and is a intact white ape, the body is really nearly indestructible!</p><p>He seized the opportunity and swept the iron rod horizontally. However, it touched the void, and the power sank into the sea.</p><p>In his line of sight, he saw that a truly chaotic Qing cloud was shrouded over Meng Qi’s head. Rays of dark light hung down, like a water curtain in front of the eaves. His attacks could only create waves of ripples.</p><p>This Su Meng was like a completely different person from the Su Meng who had opened up all of his powers previously!</p><p>And Su Meng, who had used all of his strength just now to reach a draw, seemed to have only used 50% of his supernatural power?</p><p>As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Yuan Hong could not help but feel dejected.</p><p>At this moment, his heart stirred. He sensed that there were changes in the vicinity of Jin Ao Island. He saw a golden tathagata pointing at the sky and touching the earth. He was the only one who was supreme. With the ability to point directly at his own heart, he was able to restore all of his clones back to white hair, it caused an obvious loophole in the forbidden technique. The four sword lights of extermination and slaughter fell down, completely mixing into a paste.</p><p>“Isn’t it a one-on-one fight?”Yuan Hong roared angrily and struck out with his staff</p><p>“That’s my incarnation. It’s doing what I have to do to save it,”Meng Qi replied indifferently. He stretched out his right hand and blocked Yuan Hong’s black staff.</p><p>As he spoke, the “Meng Qi”technique from before was like an innate giant. Its body was suffused with a faint golden light as it appeared at the side of the Golden Turtle Island. Its body was slightly arched, and its hands were placed on both sides of the island.</p><p>“Get Up!”</p><p>With a roar, he pulled Jin ao island out of the void.</p><p>With a dazzling light, he pulled Jin ao island out of the Void!</p><p>His goal had always been Jin ao island, not Yuan Hong!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
