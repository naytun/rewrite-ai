A dark red flashed in his eyes, and his craziness intensified, but he eventually calmed down.</p><p>The violent ape, whose golden chain mail was dyed black, held the absolute saber and raised its head. Its unyielding eyes looked up into the sky and at the finger that was devouring everything. All kinds of thoughts surged in his mind, and he felt as if he had returned to the past, he stepped on the sky and was unbridled and unruly.</p><p>He suddenly laughed out loud, and the perfect treasure light hanging outside the Netherworld roared out:</p><p>“You are not even as good as the old Heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>“Eat my blade!”</p><p>The blade light expanded, displaying the lightning of the heavens, the balance of yin and yang, and the wonders of life and death. Then, it contracted abruptly, and all the colors of the dao patterns condensed into a violent, terrifying, and extremely brilliant purple glow, draped over the body of the equal to Heaven Grand Sage, it faced the pure white finger that was like an unworldly object.</p><p>Under the feet of the violent ape, pitch-black mountain peaks collapsed immediately, and twisted rivers disappeared like bubbles. One by one, evil demons and gods exploded. Everything was collapsing layer by layer, and above his head, there was darkness, it was like the deepest and deepest despair.</p><p>At this moment, another four fingers suddenly appeared beside the white finger. They were holding a plain-colored cloud realm flag!</p><p>The flag was unfurled, and a strange fragrance billowed. It was dense all over the ground. The violent ape and the purple clouds were like stones sinking into the sea. They could only create some ripples. The further they went, the thicker it became. It was as if they were stuck in a swamp and were about to stop, then, with a flip of her slender and beautiful hand, the plain-colored cloud realm flag disappeared. She pressed down on it, as if she was pressing down on the top of a mountain.</p><p>Not only that, when Sun Wu Kong tried to avoid it, his heart skipped a beat. He sensed great danger, as if no matter how hard he tried to avoid it, he couldn’t escape the ending of being hit in the head by a palm.</p><p>The future had been taken, and it was fated that he couldn’t escape it!</p><p>“You can’t achieve the dao fruit, and yet you aren’t satisfied with all the future!”Bao Yuan’s golden eyes sparkled as he used his current pseudo-nirvana realm to peer into the countless future developments. Although he wasn’t a real big shot, he couldn’t possess it, but he could always find a chance to survive. More importantly, as a nirvana-level divine weapon, the absolute blade could do it!</p><p>“Found it!”</p><p>In a split second, he gave up on dodging and returned to the body of the blade. He gathered all the powers and divine abilities in one place with the power of return to void of all living things to break the surface with a point.</p><p>The long blade removed the purple lightning and the golden flames around it, revealing its heavy and transparent body. It hacked at the seemingly beautiful and abnormally terrifying palm, using its attack to counter the attack!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A thunderclap exploded in the clear sky, blowing away the layer of black fog and demonic qi that had enveloped the nine Netherworld for countless years. White lotuses burned with purple-green flames as they descended. Bolts of lightning of different colors were like broken arrows, falling like rain.., as the flowers bloomed and fell, a part of the world was born and destroyed, while brilliant galaxies appeared and died.</p><p>The beautiful white palm pressed on the back of the absolute blade, slapping the huge violent ape that was supporting this layer of nine serenities to the ground.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The violent ape landed on the ground with both feet. Smoke and dust rose up and spread across the realm that was more than a billion miles in circumference. Cracks spread rapidly in a shocking manner and collapsed instantly.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The pitch-black demonic soil broke through layer by layer. Dark green and crimson magma mixed with each other surged out. It was only when the space-time fog appeared faintly under the violent ape’s feet and the next layer of nine serenities could be seen that he managed to stand firmly on his feet and neutralized the attack.</p><p>The clash between the two had almost pierced through this world, bringing with it an endless scene of destruction. If Meng Qi, who had transformed into a mad monster, had not received the blessing of Hell, and the Absolute Blade’s protection of the past and the future.., he and Gu Xiaosang had already turned into ashes.</p><p>Sun Wukong was not angry, but rather happy, after blocking the palm with great difficulty. He shouted again,</p><p>“Again!”</p><p>Although he was at a disadvantage, he still managed to block the attack from the big figure on the other side!</p><p>At this moment, the eyes of the asura patriarchs from the other levels of the netherworld flashed. It was as if they could see the combination of the demon lord and the Demon Emperor’s claw before he attained the Dao. The fake higan and the higan level were unparalleled. They were not much weaker than the non-ancient ones.</p><p>However, before the equal-heaven grand sage slashed down with his blade, Zhenyuan Zi, who was the Cardinal of the Netherworld, suddenly sighed. He appeared in the world of Luofeng in the Netherworld and appeared in the layers of yin earth that had accumulated for billions of years, he opened his sleeves, wanting to pierce through the layers of space and mess up the heavenly secrets. He wanted to recreate the universe and bring Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang into it.</p><p>Luo sect still had such a pseudo-nirvana in the nine netherworld!</p><p>This was not a paradise either!</p><p>At this moment, the eyes of the Xuanming Ghost Emperor in Luo Feng Mountain flashed. His figure suddenly appeared in the sky above Zhen Yuan Zi, turning into a massive object that was covered in layers of yin qi and death intent. It blocked the universe in his sleeves.</p><p>Luo cult was so powerful. If they succeeded in this matter and cut off Old Mother’s future troubles, would luo feng black prison still have a place to stay in the future when the Netherworld realm was linked to this world?</p><p>He was not someone like the nine Chaos Celestial Master, who was usually unable to suppress his demonic nature. He could see through the changes in the situation and make a choice that was beneficial to his side!</p><p>The sleeve opened, and the universe was re-established. No matter how huge Ghost Emperor Xuan Ming was, he could still be taken in. He could not help but shrink and throw himself into it.</p><p>The sleeves that covered the heaven and earth returned to their original state. Zhenyuan zi was about to cast another divine ability when a black look suddenly appeared on the white-green Ghost Emperor’s face. The hand that held the sleeves of Ghost Emperor Xuanming was dyed green, yellow and turbid blisters protruded out one after another. They kept cracking, and pus gushed out and quickly rotted.</p><p>Such a scene that only ordinary people could have appeared on a ghost emperor and a false nirvana. It was truly inexplicably horrifying!</p><p>Ghost Emperor Xuanming was the first evil ghost of this era. After a few previous exchanges, he naturally saw the problem behind Zhen Yuanzi’s transformation into a ghost emperor. He relied on reincarnation and was already a ghost, so he could receive the blessings of the nine Netherworlds, he was on par with him, but the Divine Arts and absolute arts that he originally cultivated belonged to the immortals. Even reincarnation could not change the nature of this technique. It was a little out of place with the nine Netherworlds, so.., his strongest skill was his biggest weakness. He deliberately fell for it so that he could grasp it!</p><p>A layer of brown light rose and enveloped Zhenyuan Zi’s entire body. He tried his best to suppress these changes, so he could not be distracted for a moment.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The fair and beautiful palm fell again, slapping the dark violent ape, man, and knife to the ground. It was like slapping a tiny fly, causing the ground to be full of cracks, as if it was going to be divided into countless pieces, floating in the darkness, against the background of the purple lightning, dark thunder, and White Lotus Green Flame, it looked unusually desolate.</p><p>On the other side, the red mountain range shook. The Dark Sky Emperor looked at Meng Qi, who was struggling in the aftermath of the other shore, with his weathered and indifferent eyes. His withered and desolate voice fell:</p><p>“In the end, you still bumped into my hand!”</p><p>A vortex appeared in the high sky surrounded by black fog. A dark palm that absorbed all the light reached out and directly pierced into the river of time that flowed through the nine underworld.</p><p>However, a huge six-fingered palm with strange patterns and deep demonic intent suddenly appeared in front of his eyes.</p><p>The Devil Emperor’s Claw!</p><p>In the scarlet mountain range, Qi Zhengyan had been expressionless the whole time. He looked at Meng Qi who had transformed into a monster. He looked at the bulging veins on his face, the orifices all over his body, and the black hair all over his body that looked like snakes. His gaze was deep, as if he was recalling the past.., he remembered that figure that always made people gnash their teeth but would never be hated.</p><p>He suddenly let out a long sigh as if he was already prepared. Before the Black Heavenly Emperor reached out his hand, he threw out the Devil Emperor’s Claw.</p><p>He originally wanted to use this as bait to lure away all the attention so that he would not be attacked by evil people. However, everything could not go as he wished!</p><p>The Devil Emperor’s claw flew straight into the Black Heavenly Emperor’s hand. It almost threw itself into his arms. It tried its best to get rid of it and return to Qi Zhengyan. However, it was temporarily cut off by the power of the Twelve Devil Saints and the son of heaven.</p><p>In the eyes of the Black Heavenly Emperor, the Devil Emperor’s Claw, which he had been coveting for a long time, became clearer and clearer. The furious nine chaos heavenly venerate and the nine nether blood demon manifested themselves and descended.</p><p>Just as Qi Zhengyan thought that the Black Heavenly Emperor was going to take the Devil Emperor’s Claw and get caught in the whirlpool of fighting with the other two false nirvana realms, and could no longer free his hands to deal with Meng Qi, he saw the black gem-like palm suddenly bend its finger, it gently flicked on the Devil Emperor’s Claw.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Devil Emperor’s Claw was flicked in another direction. Nine Chaos Heavenly venerate and the others immediately chased after it.</p><p>The Black Heavenly Emperor had actually given up on this supreme treasure of the Devil Path!</p><p>This was simply unimaginable!</p><p>His vision locked onto Meng Qi, and he said lightly,</p><p>“You have moved the past into the netherworld. There will no longer be a time when you are weak. Killing you is like slaughtering a chicken.”</p><p>The dark and gloomy palm followed the illusory river water upwards and pressed down on Meng Qi, who had proven himself as a legend.</p><p>Suddenly, the illusory river of time was dyed with a hint of blood. Red waves surged up rapidly and swallowed the Black Heavenly Emperor’s palm.</p><p>The nine serenities blood demon had also given up on the Devil Emperor’s Claw!</p><p>The Asura primogenitor and the others were dumbstruck as they watched. What kind of world was this? The other shore-level devil path divine weapon was actually not in the eyes of the two fake other shore-level divine weapons!</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>The crimson waves surged forward, following his palm and surging towards the Black Heavenly Emperor’s training hall. The surging demonic Qi in the sky turned into a sea of blood. There seemed to be a fierce flash within it, and it was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The Black Heavenly Emperor’s voice came from within. There was a slight change as he roared furiously, “Yang Jian!”</p><p>“Yang Jian!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
