It was time to end the story. In the initial outline, the idea was that Little Meng and little sang would fight against the Golden Emperor and end the story with a hot-blooded battle. However, halfway through the story.., the more he wrote, the more he felt the terror of the Golden Emperor’s shrewdness and his firm pursuit of the Great Dao. A BOSS like this on the other side would never allow himself to end up like that. He was too clever in his scheming, the iron-hearted pursuit of the Great Dao should be his final destination. Therefore, he could not get off the final climax, and he could not finish it with a satisfying ending. For a creator, it was too painful to not be able to balance the fish and the bear’s paw.</p><p>However, I ultimately decided to respect the character of the Golden Emperor, the villain who supported the next third of the story, and the character’s personality and settings. This was also the original intention of my writing — every book.., i would consider which aspect of my shortcomings I wanted to improve and improve.</p><p>Doom was a complete mind-training story. There was no other way for me to write my heart by hand, so I wrote the immortal’s will. However, there were too many shortcomings: writing style, plot design, rhythm control, character creation, these may have some shining points, but overall, they were too common and too thin. Therefore, the arcanist was led by the decryption of the world view. He did a good job of rhythm control. The degree of fine structure was better than doom, and the characters were also improved, but it was not enough, and the fighting was also powerless.</p><p>With these summaries, the original intention of the first life was to write about people and ideas. In the first half of the happy world, self-feeling characters, fighting, conflicts, secrets, suspense, ideas, hot-blooded, happy, and so on were all written to a new level, breaking through the previous self. But after stepping into the outdoor scene, the first thing was that the fighting began to become empty, there were too many problems that I had never encountered in the confrontation of the high-level martial arts style. It was very painful to write, and I slowly fell into a bottleneck. As the relatively dark and heavy worldview gradually revealed itself, the conflicts of the early styles, and the integration of the past characters, it was a new difficult problem, and the larger background, more characters’games, more detailed clues to pave the way, and the need to rack one’s brains, it was difficult to take care of other things, unless one could only use a chapter in two or three days, thus, while the main body was still fine, many of the advantages of the earlier chapters were lost,</p><p>these things could not be thought of in the initial outline. One would only understand it when it was written, and only when they encountered it would they know how to solve it in the future. The first life was good, but there were indeed many problems that needed to be summarized.</p><p>Fortunately, I was satisfied with the conclusion of the game of the Almighty. I felt pretty good that I could achieve such a level of content with nearly 4.5 million words. I only hoped that I could summarize more and improve in the next book.</p><p>The most satisfied characters in this book were Xiao Meng, Jin Huang, and Xiao sang. Initially, Xiao Sang was an extra for a girl I knew. She only had one requirement: write her as a female antagonist. I looked at Jade Purple’s settings, i suddenly felt that she was quite cute, so she became schizophrenic. Then, she gave me a series of inspirations. I had the layout of Jin Huang. If it wasn’t for this coincidence.., perhaps the life that everyone saw wouldn’t be like this.</p><p>Perhaps many people didn’t like Xiao Sang’s character, but at least for me, I felt that she was the best female character I had ever written. Not the most loved and most satisfied, but the best. At the end of the seventh volume, Xiao sang faced the golden emperor head-on, when I was stripped of my pride bit by bit, I even had the feeling that this character was alive.</p><p>After concluding here, I first answered a few questions that hadn’t been filled in in the main text:</p><p>First, what did Pig Bajie Know? He had used some sort of lustful intuition to keenly detect that thunder god was having an affair with demon saint, and from there, he could see that there might be a problem with thunder god’s true identity, which was why old pig had to die.</p><p>Second, Han Guang. Wang Siyuan’s portrayal of him in the early stages was full of resourcefulness and meticulous planning, to show that the true will of heaven behind the curtain had been difficult to question since ancient times. Thus, there wasn’t much of a scene, and Han Guang’s ending had long been destined, the original owner of the Luo book was the Emperor of the east. Wang Siyuan thought that he had gotten it back by figuring out the monster of the heavenly axiom. In fact, it was the arrangement of the Devil Buddha. His resistance had always been under the control of the Devil Buddha.</p><p>Thirdly, the escaping Carya remains was a terrifying need to show the Supreme True Buddha. After being taken away by the Monkey King, Wang Siyuan could only imagine if it was possible for him to turn into a sarira in the new era and find a new successor.</p><p>Fourthly, why did no one rush to carry the remains of the Tang Sanzang after the Battle of Mount Lingshan? Because the other shore was balanced and involved with each other, no one dared to make the first move until they entered a deep sleep in the chaos and waited for the end of the calamity. The Laotzu did nothing and could not carry it unless it was a legend. Hence, the sand monk returned in advance.</p><p>Fifthly, the golden cicada shell was originally used by Meng Qi to deal with the Supreme True Buddha. However, the Buddha did not truly transcend, so he did not need it anymore.</p><p>Sixthly, the Buddha did not truly transcend the pit. There had been hints in the early stages that the DAO Master’s products were very powerful. There was Old Lord Huang, who split into the Donghuang and the Heavenly Dao monsters. They were both on the other side, and there were the ancient ones, while the Supreme True Buddha was indeed powerful and strange, the Tang Sanzang was much weaker. Meng Qi thought that it was because of the improvements, but when he realized that the dao master’s mark was empty, the Buddha’s mark was still there, he suspected that the Buddha had not transcended, and the DAO Master had not made a move. The Buddha had made a move, and the Devil Buddha had revealed the secret of cooperating with the primordial Lord of Heaven. Therefore, the final battle was predictable and not a spur of the moment.</p><p>Seven, as for each era, there was only one transcending. If the Buddha had transcended, why did Meng Qi not suspect that those on the other side were fighting for the Dao Fruit? He had forgotten to write here. He thought that this was the final tribulation, the end of many previous eras, and not a single era. Perhaps there was still a chance.</p><p>Eight. Why couldn’t the original incipient numinous treasure take action, but Amitabha Buddha and the Golden Emperor could? In the last chapter, the original incipient said that they had already transformed their states, eliminating karma and waiting for an opportunity. They didn’t need to rush like the Golden Emperor, which meant that they were half a step ahead and had a seventy to eighty percent chance of winning, this forced the gold emperor to use the six soul banner to cut his morals.</p><p>Nine, the state of the demon emperor was slightly equivalent to that of Buddha, but she was not restricted. She was just afraid that her efforts would turn to naught the moment she showed up. She was waiting for an opportunity. As long as there was still the next era, she was not afraid of the apocalypse. Demon saint’s words had hinted at this.</p><p>Ten, the chronological sequence of the godhood journey to the west. First, it was godhood, the celestial emperor attains the other shore, suppressing the rest of the world. Then, gradually, she was separated from Yuanshi and her morals. There was the journey to the west. Then, the demon lord was instigated by the Thunder God to attack the heaven, indirectly, the secret of the fruit was exposed. Not long after, the heavenly court fell. The other shore joined forces. Monkey took the diamond ring given by the Old Lord and at the last moment, he sent the heavily injured celestial emperor to the Heavenly Court and sent him to the immortal world, giving him a chance to live, to maintain the existence of this era, the final battle was the Battle of Mount Numinous. Amitabha and Bodhi fought against the demon saint, morality and the primordial beginning, and the other ancient people later intervened. The diamond ring and the seven treasures magical tree were all damaged in this battle.</p><p>Of course, this was after all a series of nearly two years. It was inevitable that some of the details would be confused, and there would be situations that did not correspond. For example, when Liu Luo Ming had seen Meng Qi’s painting of the demonic blood peach and explored the highest level of the heavenly court.., but he said that he did not know. Of course, it could also be explained as little Meng’s painting ability being “Divine and uncanny.”It was amazing. When he drew a child’s painting, even his mother would not recognize it. Well, these did not involve the main plot.., it did not involve the direction. If there was a chance to publish it in the future, he could proofread it again.</p><p>The rest were all pitfalls for the ending of the characters. Some of them would be published outside, and some of them would be left blank. Oh right, when I saw that some of my friends in the book review section said that it was best to publish it in a book, in order to take care of them, I would publish it in a book as well, using the free format, after resting, there would be the first post of the character series at seven o’clock on Friday night. However, I also hope that everyone could add me as ‘prestige’. There would be good jokes, all kinds of whims, and there would be waste drafts to read first, i’ll also put aside the stories that have nothing to do with my first life. For example, tonight’s “If it’s a city”. In short, I’ll have time to maintain my three weekly updates. Just search for my pen name. There’s no need to add me as a person of authority..</p><p>After concluding, it’s time to talk about the new book. As mentioned before, the new book is an urban superpower. Today, I can say it more clearly. It’s an urban martial arts or fantasy style of the boxing emperor type. Its power level will be lowered, it would allow me to write better characters and stories, and use the things that I had concluded in my life. Moreover, this type of writing would have fewer people and would be more fresh. It would be very exciting to write</p><p>Of course, people would say that if I didn’t seek death, I wouldn’t die. I would change the subject and change the field. To be honest, I knew that it wouldn’t be good. I would definitely lose a lot of readers. Every time I saw someone add a few hundred thousand new subscriptions, I would be able to write more than ten million, tens of millions of copyright fees. Was I not envious? That was impossible. But I couldn’t write what I didn’t want to write. I couldn’t fake a smile and fake an orgasm to write a story that I had no inspiration, no idea, no passion to write.</p><p>Call it naive or call it stupid, but I still remember the original intention when I first started writing. I wrote my heart with my hand. I felt good writing. I felt that I couldn’t wait to share the story with everyone. I enjoyed creating a world, the satisfaction of writing a character alive.</p><p>I’m not young anymore, but I still feel that I still have a dream in my heart. I still have passion, and I still have energy. I still want to tell the story. It has nothing to do with the subject matter or the style. It only has to do with my heart!</p><p>Just like what little Meng said, it’s not a matter of whether it’s worth it or not. It’s whether I want to!</p><p>I want to. I have no regrets. I’m a big idiot!</p><p>The new book had been conceived for a long time. Before writing the Arcana, he had some ideas. Of course, at that time, he wanted to write about the science and technology, but unfortunately, the time had passed and he no longer felt that way. However, the details accumulated at that time, the accumulated plots.., many of them could be used. Until now, the general idea had been perfected, and he was just waiting to add more bricks and tiles. However, he had been writing for almost two years, and he was really exhausted. His thinking seemed to be slow. He needed time to rest, and he also needed time to recharge, i needed to read a good book, see how others portrayed characters, tell good stories, learn skills, and gain experience. Therefore, I needed two months of rest and recharge. I needed a month to perfect the outline and draft. I will see you on October 1st for the new book!</p><p>Phew. I wrote for twenty-two months. Some of my friends passed high school, some of my friends graduated from college, some changed jobs, and some got married and started their own businesses like me, little Meng can be considered to have accompanied us through a stage of life. If this book can become a memory of the past for everyone, then I will be very happy.</p><p>Sincerely, salute, see you outside, see you in the new book!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
