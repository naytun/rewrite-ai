Even if it was just a part of it, even if the immortal world and the nine underworlds did not have a corresponding land for the shortcut, the manifestation of the Great Dao was incomplete!</p><p>However, if one thought about it carefully, this place was only close to chaos, not true chaos. The difficulty of establishing it had dropped drastically. Moreover, it was suppressed by the power of the absolute blade in all aspects, making it difficult for it to unleash its full potential.</p><p>As this thought flashed through his mind, Meng Qi laughed:</p><p>“If that’s the case, then I will become a second-origin heavenly venerate!”</p><p>The clouds above his head were boiling. It was as if the initial and final point that had been formed had collapsed into rolling waves, forming a vast and ancient banner.</p><p>As soon as the flag appeared, the darkness in the surroundings suddenly shook, and the ripples spread out like waves in the ocean.</p><p>Meng Qi reached out his right hand and grabbed the slowly descending pangu flag. It was the manifestation of his own illusionary heaven-splitting dao, and then he waved it forward in an extremely heavy manner.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, colorful rays of light and a myriad of auspicious auras pierced through the quiet darkness, making the rest seem to be frozen.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Everything began to shake. With the appearance of a thin opening, the ‘Dam’collapsed, and the ‘flood’surged. Endless terrifying explosions tore apart the chaos and broke the immutable stillness.</p><p>The moment there was a bit of movement, there would be yin and yang. The clear Qi would float up, and the turbid Qi would sink down. The light from the explosions would sweep through everything, creating a chaotic scene of Earth, fire, wind, and water.</p><p>At this moment, the innate virtue manifested itself. Countless yellow clouds floated down and condensed into a thirty-three-story exquisite pagoda. It had the appearance of invulnerability. The black and white qi intertwined and transformed into a Taiji diagram. There were also many green lotuses blooming, evil spirits became swords, and the black females became gates… at the beginning of the world, many treasures that originated from the innate realm took form!</p><p>However, before this, it was only close to chaos and not true chaos. These treasures were originally created by Donghuang’s original “Myriad realms of the heavens”that corresponded to the Great Dao. Each of them had some of their original spirituality, and in an instant, they gained life, they turned into innate gods, just like how the Heaven, earth, black, yellow, and exquisite pagoda had turned into the awe-inspiring “God of virtue”, the Taiji diagram had turned into the “Moral boy”, and the river of time had given birth to the “Time ancestor”, all of these things were in abundance, but they were all far away from Meng Qi, and they were all on high alert. For some reason, they were all filled with a violent and brutal feeling. They did not look like gods and devils, but more like demonic gods!</p><p>Meng Qi’s divine sense spread out. He could not care less about maintaining the evolution of the world at the beginning. He allowed them to develop on their own and focused on searching for the remnants of Donghuang’s spirituality.</p><p>Without the follow-up that he provided, the clear air that floated up and the turbid air that sank down could not be completely separated. They were mixed together with the raging Earth, fire, wind, and water, forming a boundless and boundless starry sky.</p><p>This starry sky possessed the wonders of both the immortal realm and the nine Netherworlds, making it difficult for it to be omnipresent. Everything that one’s divine sense could reach was deep darkness, boundless darkness. Occasionally, one would be able to see a bit of bright stars being born, like a lone island in the vast ocean.</p><p>At the center of this strange ‘Myriad Worlds’, which was where Meng Qi ‘split the heavens and split the earth’, as he left this place and roamed the starry sky in search of the East Emperor’s spirituality, one after another mysterious and indescribable vortexes suddenly appeared, numerous dao patterns were carved onto the jade disc, and the ‘Dao’on it, such as time, longevity, Great Sun, and stars, were the most perfect.</p><p>“HMPH, you want to find me in my divine domain? You must be Dreaming!”In another vortex, a black-robed emperor appeared. He stretched out his right hand and grabbed the jade disc that was glowing with a bright light.</p><p>This was the jade disc of Destiny that had all the laws of the Great Dao of the Eastern Emperor’s ‘Myriad Worlds’written on it. Only when the remnant spirit controlled it would it be able to completely control this world.</p><p>At this moment, a fair and slender finger suddenly appeared in the eyes of the black-robed emperor, and he saw an exquisite face that was filled with joy and displeasure.</p><p>That finger seemed to be the destination of all things, exuding a heart-palpitating serene tranquility. It was the first to hit the Jade Disc of Destiny!</p><p>White lotuses surrounded Gu Xiaosang’s body, ethereal and holy. There was a hint of a playful smile in her eyes, as if she was saying, “Sorry, first come, first served.”.</p><p>The black-robed emperor could not be bothered with his anger. There was only one thought in his mind:</p><p>“She’s here? where is the one who created the world?”</p><p>As soon as this thought appeared in his mind, he saw a green, ethereal, and boundless sword light shoot out from the depths of the dark universe. It was vast and unstoppable.</p><p>At the same time, a handsome monk with red lips and white teeth appeared in the boundless starry sky in another direction. A cold, focused man with a sword on his back and a solemn celestial being whose entire body was suffused with faint gold. Each of them shot out a sword light, some were as red as fire, some were pure white, and some were as dark as the void. They were exactly the same as the green sword lights from before, forming the celestial eradication sword formation, which happened to envelop the black-robed and crowned emperor, who was the remnant of Donghuang’s spirituality.</p><p>Faced with the remnant of the other shore, Meng Qi went all out as soon as he made his move. He transformed the three pure ones in one breath and the celestial eradication sword formation without holding anything back!</p><p>The red, green, black, and white sword lights swept across, cutting through the void, messing up time, destroying everything, and spreading the “Waves”of destruction, slaughter, heat, and death, leaving no chance for Donghuang’s spirituality!</p><p>Just now, he had listened to Gu Xiaosang’s suggestion and temporarily stayed away from this place where the “Jade Disc of Destiny”might appear. Then, he had made a comeback, so that Donghuang’s spirituality would not remain hidden and the jade disc of Destiny would not appear!</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, he saw that Xiaosang had completely controlled the jade disc of Destiny and was about to absorb it bit by bit with the “Lifeless finger.”Meng Qi suddenly realized that this was probably the purpose of her proposal to reopen the world. As for why she knew.., and to guess where this thing would be born, the answer could not be simpler. The Gold Emperor had his own universe, so it was not to the extent that he did not have this little bit of knowledge!</p><p>The celestial eradication sword formation kept shrinking, completely squeezing the space where the remnants of Donghuang’s spirituality were moving around. Seeing that he was about to be swallowed by the many paths of eradication and the billions of sword lights, Meng Qi suddenly felt his heart palpitate.</p><p>“Am I someone you can kill?”The illusory voice suddenly reverberated, like the chimes of a bell, Grand and solemn.</p><p>Meng Qi immediately felt the astonishment on the face of ‘Elder Time’, and the river of time that was rolling forward began to flow in the opposite direction!</p><p>Red, green, black, and white, sword lights rose one after another and flew into the distant starry sky. The four figures of Meng Qi’s family also returned to the depths of darkness, and everything returned to the time before he set up the celestial eradication sword formation.</p><p>Time flowed backwards, and everything happened again!</p><p>The black-robed monarch stared coldly at Meng Qi and said indifferently,</p><p>“Even if you are incomplete, even if you are restricted by a majority of your power by the other shore blade, you can not harm me just by relying on your essence!”</p><p>How could the incomplete spirit of the other shore be so easy to deal with?</p><p>At this moment, the expression of the black-robed monarch suddenly changed, because the “Jade disc of Destiny”that was supposed to return to him had disappeared! The orchid-like woman from the Hollow Valley had disappeared!</p><p>Seeing this, Meng Qi smiled and casually explained to the remnant of Donghuang’s spirituality,</p><p>“She has always thought things through thoroughly. Once she gets the jade disc of Destiny, she will use the power of the Peach and me to leave this world and return to the absolute blade. No matter how much time you turn back, what use is it?”</p><p>It could only affect this world!</p><p>Before the brutal and violent remnant of Donghuang’s spirituality flew into a rage, Meng Qi also disappeared into the depths of the boundless starry sky and leaped out of this special “Universe”. After the battle just now.., he knew that he had no way to get rid of the remnant of Donghuang’s spirituality for the time being. He had to first try to increase his strength.</p><p>The Light and shadows changed before his eyes. The Sea of lightning around him flickered. Gu Xiaosang stood at the ripples of the water. Her bright eyes and white teeth were smiling sweetly as she waited for Meng Qi.</p><p>Seeing that she was holding the jade disc of fortune in her hand and didn’t absorb it with her lifeless finger, Meng Qi was quite surprised:</p><p>“You still keep it?”</p><p>With Xiaosang’s personality, shouldn’t she just put it in her bag and absorb it directly?</p><p>Gu Xiaosang smiled and said, “Aren’t we waiting for you to share it with us, husband?”</p><p>“Ah?”Meng Qi couldn’t react in time.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang rolled her eyes, she said emotionlessly, “My dear husband, the great calamity is coming. You must improve yourself as soon as possible. As long as you absorb and assimilate it, your control over the world will be strengthened. Then, you can use this opportunity to destroy those innate demon gods one by one and devour their symbolism. Finally, you will be perfected and surpass the remaining spirit of Donghuang to get rid of them.”</p><p>At this point, she added deliberately, “If there is no skin left, there will be no fur attached to it. I still understand this principle.”</p><p>After going around in such a big circle, he was actually plotting for me? Meng Qi could not help but smile.</p><p>..</p><p>In the Misty Dream, the Netherworld, which had been in chaos for a long time due to the fall of the Fengdu Emperor, had already regained order.</p><p>In the deepest part of the palace, in a towering and magnificent black hall, the Nine Spirits Original Saint was comprehending the various mysteries of the afterlife.</p><p>Suddenly, it opened its eyes and looked out of the palace. The Yellow Springs surged and rose violently. It was unknown where they connected. Then, an ancient aura flew out and landed in front of it, turning into the image of the Ghost Emperor.</p><p>“Zhen Yuan Zi, how did you become like this?”The nine spirits original saint asked in a low voice.</p><p>Zhen Yuan zi answered indifferently, “I just had an opportunity.”</p><p>As he said that, he stared into nine spirits origin saint’s eyes and said,</p><p>“According to Emperor Qing’s promise, it’s time to hand over the Netherworld to us.”</p><p>Emperor Qing had not sent nine spirits origin saint into the Netherworld for himself!</p><p>Nine spirits origin saint narrowed his eyes and said, “You have the aura of Luo Feng from the netherworld. It seems that you have made a lot of achievements. If you take it to the Netherworld and combine it with your hometown of vacuum, I’m afraid that you can welcome the return of Mother Wu Sheng…”</p><p>“I should have entered the Netherworld first and used this opportunity to link up with Luo Feng’s black prison and make some achievements. Finally, I combined it with my hometown of vacuum. Who would have thought that I would encounter a fortuitous encounter? The order is a little reversed,”Zhen Yuan Zi replied calmly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
