It had flown away at a critical moment. If Meng qiruo still did not understand the will of the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure, then his life would have been wasted.</p><p>It was difficult to predict what kind of monster the remnants of the primordial emperor’s flesh and blood would turn into if they were not suppressed and sealed. However, one could imagine how terrifying it would be. Even if one’s physical body was destroyed.., there was only a drop of blood and a cell left. As long as a little bit of the spiritual light of his nature had not disappeared, his flesh and blood would be able to regenerate, and he would be able to regain his dao body and his original realm. Under the premise that there was enough time, it would not be difficult for him to recover to his peak state, if even a great divine arts practitioner with a saintly physical body could do this, how could a person on the other side who had transcended the sea of suffering not be able to do it?</p><p>It was likely to be even more mysterious and terrifying!</p><p>In other words, what he was about to face was an enemy that was close to the other side or even the real other side. Just the word ‘his’realm alone made those who heard it despair. They had no motivation to resist at all.</p><p>This was not the same as the trip to the Underworld to take the god Ascension Roll. Back then, he had planned and acted after he had made his decision. With the secret arrangement of the Heavenly Wheel of life and death and a place that isolated the origin of the outside world, he could fight for a chance of survival against the Black Heaven Emperor and the other false ‘Other Side’, it was not that he was not prepared, but the incident was sudden and unexpected. It completely interrupted all the arrangements. In the rush, what other backup plan did he have?</p><p>Moreover, this place was filled with time turbulence. It was almost outside of the river of time. He could barely grasp the causal connection in the real world. It was already difficult to sense the origin of life and death in the netherworld.</p><p>This was a plan to kill him!</p><p>After going through the stage where they used each other and were unable to distinguish friend from foe, the Heavenly Lord of Numinous Treasure finally showed his true attitude!</p><p>Was this the great calamity that Emperor Qing had mentioned?</p><p>But didn’t it happen too quickly? Wasn’t it too surreal?</p><p>The thoughts in Meng Qi’s mind flashed like memories of death approaching. However, he had been through hundreds of battles, and his accumulated experience was profound. He was also the best at making snap decisions. In an instant, his heart was as calm as a mirror, and he dismissed all unnecessary thoughts, he suppressed them in the depths of his spiritual altar.</p><p>At this moment, if he couldn’t block the first wave of retaliation from the remnants of Donghuang Taiyi’s flesh and blood, even Emperor Qing wouldn’t be able to save him in time. After all, he had already jumped out of time and entered the turbulent flow!</p><p>The remnants of Donghuang Taiyi’s flesh and blood had been suppressed by the Qingping Sword for countless years, and they had long been weakened to the extreme. Furthermore, they weren’t completely on the other side of the river, and a portion of the crucial dao fruit was still with him. In other words.., it would take a certain amount of time for him to break out of his weakened state and for his flesh and blood to reproduce and recover!</p><p>For a great divine arts practitioner like him, it would not take too long for his flesh and blood to recover after being suppressed for so many years. The Nirvana would definitely be even shorter, even if it was an incomplete nirvana practitioner.</p><p>It would take at most three moments, and in the blink of an eye, the remaining flesh and blood of Donghuang Taiyi would recover to a level that was sufficient to crush him!</p><p>But no matter what, there was always a gap that he could use!</p><p>In that instant, hundreds of millions of thoughts flashed through Meng Qi’s mind, and he swung the overlord blade in his original body.</p><p>Even if it was really the end of the world!</p><p>Even if there was no chance of survival!</p><p>He would never give up. He would rather face the death of his enemy than face death with his back turned!</p><p>Crackle, crackle, crackle. Purple lightning streaked across the sky, abnormally brilliant. It set off the chaotic flow of time in the surroundings incomparably clearly, completely dispersing the fog that filled the area.</p><p>The Saber Light moved forward, slashing towards the brutal and ruthless aura.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The sound of Thunder suddenly rumbled, hiding the essence heart. It made everything seem to be intimidated, and there was a short and fleeting pause.</p><p>The wriggling of that strange mass of pitch-black flesh slowed down subtly, and it was also slightly affected.</p><p>This was the opportunity! The saber light spread out like a thundercloud, and like a huge mouth, it suddenly descended, swallowing the remaining flesh and blood of Donghuang Taiyi into it.</p><p>Yes, it swallowed him!</p><p>Meng Qi had never thought that with his current realm and the current level of the absolute blade, he would be able to severely injure the remaining flesh of the other side. Even if he had been suppressed for all eternity and had yet to fully recover, the nature of it meant that this could not happen!</p><p>Therefore, his idea was not to retreat but to advance and fight head-on, taking the opportunity to absorb the remaining flesh of Donghuang Taiyi into the absolute blade!</p><p>Inside the absolute saber, the essence of the absolute saber was at the paramita level. Just like the Qingping Sword, it would not be quickly destroyed by the remnants of Donghuang Taiyi’s flesh, stained, or even mixed together. Furthermore, there was the Devil Buddha’s imprint there. If he could drive the tiger away and devour the wolf.., if he allowed the remnants of Donghuang Taiyi and the Devil Buddha Ah Nan to fight until both sides suffered heavy injuries, the spirit of the absolute saber would reap the benefits. Not only would he be able to escape death, but he would also be able to completely eliminate the hidden dangers within the absolute saber, allowing it to fully awaken and barely resist the will of heaven!</p><p>However, without the suppression of the Qingping Sword and the safe environment outside the Fusang ancient tree, driving the tiger to swallow the wolf was itself a very dangerous matter. What if Donghuang Tai Yi and the remnants of Devil Buddha Ah Nan were to join forces? What if the two of them did not fight to the death right away but instead tried to replace the spirit of the absolute saber and determine the victor?</p><p>More importantly, if he wanted to drive the tiger to swallow the wolf, his consciousness and strength had to enter and help the spirit of the absolute saber. Only then would he be able to grasp the fleeting opportunity, after all, the spirit of a divine weapon or magical treasure was ultimately inferior to that of a great divine arts practitioner. In this way, he would be the weakest of the four ‘factions’, and it would be very easy for him to be targeted by Donghuang’s flesh and blood, as well as the Devil Buddha’s brand. Water flowed downwards.., when the brand and flesh didn’t have much spirit or had yet to fully recover, their instinct was to avoid the edge and eliminate the weak first.</p><p>Therefore, after absorbing the remaining flesh and blood of Donghuang Taiyi into the absolute saber, the true danger and the true confrontation would begin!</p><p>Meng Qi didn’t have any luck in waiting for others to help him. His will was as firm as a rock. His true body and the three incarnations disappeared together and entered the absolute blade.</p><p>Either he didn’t do it, or he did his best!</p><p>The scene in front of him changed. Lightning turned into water and condensed into an endless ocean that rolled away. Layers after layers of purple, green, gold, and silver filled every corner of this realm.</p><p>In the depths of the Lightning Sea, every drop of water turned into the corresponding true god of lightning, forming the image of a purple blade shadow. Half a sea away from it was a blood-black reverse ten thousand character talisman, it represented all kinds of evil and brought endless corruption.</p><p>This scene and image was different from what Meng Qi had seen before. It seemed that with the weakening of the Devil Buddha brand, spirituality gradually gained the upper hand, and there were certain changes.</p><p>At this moment, Qing Yun was above Meng Qi’s head, and his body was in the Sea of lightning. Not far away, his black flesh was squirming, crazily absorbing the power of lightning. His aura instantly rose to a level that was sufficient to contend against the absolute blade and the Devil Buddha brand, and it had not stopped growing.</p><p>“Driving a tiger and swallowing a wolf, nine out of ten deaths is better than ten out of ten deaths!”Meng Qi thought to himself. He was going to take the initiative to attack, stimulate the remaining flesh of Donghuang Taiyi, and then use the protection of the absolute blade to lead it to the Devil Buddha brand.</p><p>Such an action could be described as dancing on the edge of a cliff!</p><p>Dang!</p><p>At this moment, he heard a bell chime in his ear. Time seemed to have frozen, but there were still flashes of lightning.</p><p>The remaining flesh of Donghuang Taiyi did not need to be stimulated, it was revealed crazily!</p><p>Meng Qi’s true body immediately stopped. The defense of the ultimate infinite primordial qi, Shi Qingyun, was so weak that it was like a thin piece of paper. It could only force his consciousness to move.</p><p>Then, he saw the strange black flesh transform into the image of an archaic emperor in a black robe. Then, it pounced on the Devil Buddha brand without looking back. It was aggressive and did not hold back. It did not care about absolute blade’s spirituality or Meng Qi, it turned a blind eye!</p><p>Ah..</p><p>I don’t need to drive the tiger to swallow the wolf. They started to fight..</p><p>Meng Qi was stunned. The smooth development of the matter left him dumbstruck.</p><p>Could this be considered a wish come true?</p><p>Seeing the black-robed supreme ancient emperor “Swallowing”the reverse myriad character talisman without caring about his own safety and engaging in an intense battle, his aura and attitude were as if he had a blood feud with the Devil Buddha Ananda for ten lifetimes, he would rather die together than let the other party have a good time. A strange thought suddenly appeared in Meng Qi’s mind:</p><p>“When the heavenly court fell, the ‘Monster of Heavenly Dao’watched from afar and did not intervene. It seemed like it had other plans and was extremely intelligent. It would not be too much to say that it was Donghuang Taiyi himself. At that time, thunder god happened to not be in the heavenly court. Could there be a connection between the two?”</p><p>“Looking at the chaos and brutality of the monster of Heavenly Dao now, could it be that Ah Nan had also betrayed him, causing the hidden problem that had appeared when Donghuang had mixed with the original monster to suddenly erupt? “If that’s really the case, it’s no Wonder Donghuang’s flesh and blood looked so hateful and hateful that it was difficult to conceal their mutual destruction…”</p><p>“That’s true. Donghuang Taiyi combined with the Heavenly Dao monster. If there were no problems, he would have long had the ability to undo the Qingping sword’s suppression…”</p><p>Seeing the “Life-or-death”aura of both sides, Meng Qi felt that this idea was increasingly close to reality. Moreover, the connection between thunder god and Donghuang might not even be known by the Heavenly Lord of Numinous Treasure, this could also explain why thunder god had the ability to spy on the secrets of the Dao fruit under the eyes of the Heavenly Emperor and obtain the benefits of helping the Devil Master achieve the Dao. It was because he had borrowed the power of the monster of the Heavenly Dao, which was Donghuang Taiyi!</p><p>And by a stroke of luck, he had also helped himself to escape a calamity. However, this was clearly not the calamity that was certain to bring about his death as mentioned by the Green Emperor.</p><p>I had always thought that I was an expert at stirring up trouble and drawing hatred. I was one of the rare MTS in the world. Who knew that the ability of the Devil Buddha Ananda to draw hatred was simply incomparable? The Heavenly Emperor, Buddha, demon saint, Demon Emperor, Amitabha Buddha, ancient Bodhi Buddha, and so on.., in the end, even the archaic emperor, Donghuang Taiyi, hated him so much. He was truly a red rabbit among humans and a Lu Bu among horses. He was the best in the world, and I could not compare to him. As expected of my true self… Meng Qi, who was watching the battle from the sidelines, silently cursed, he deliberately changed the positions of the Red Rabbit and Lu Bu, and then commanded the Absolute Blade’s spirit to sit back and reap the benefits!</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, there was a loud bang. The blood-black ten thousand words symbol seemed to have endured the erosion of countless years. It was eroded and shattered, dissipating into foam.</p><p>The Devil Buddha imprint had finally been completely removed!</p><p>However, a bronze ancient bell hung in the depths of the sea of lightning, suppressed by the Absolute Blade’s phantom image. Although it was dim and weak, it was still some distance away from being shattered. Upon closer inspection.., one would discover that this bronze ancient bell was formed from bits and pieces of strange, near-black flesh and blood. It was the remnants of Donghuang Taiyi.</p><p>When the two tigers fought earlier, due to a period of recovery, the remaining power of Donghuang’s flesh and blood had completely overpowered the Devil Buddha imprint that had been repeatedly worn down. This caused the absolute blade’s spirit to not be able to reap the full benefits, and it could only weaken and suppress it, it could not be defeated in one fell swoop.</p><p>But no matter what, Meng Qi’s danger had been resolved.</p><p>..</p><p>In the boundless pure land, Ah Nan’s shadow was explaining the mysteries of the other shore to the lamp-burning ancient Buddha.</p><p>Suddenly, he stopped speaking and turned his head to look outside the Buddhist kingdom. He muttered to himself in a low voice,</p><p>“Tai Yi…”</p><p>At this moment, the Devil Buddha brand in the absolute saber had been completely eliminated.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
