At night, they could compete with the bright moon.</p><p>At this moment, after hearing mother Wusheng’s warning, the ‘lights’flickered one after another, as if they were frightened and kept quiet. However, they soon recovered, and their consciousnesses instantly crossed a long distance, they directly entered the hollow jade temple and revealed their corresponding images. For a moment, they looked at each other speechlessly.</p><p>“Teacher still hasn’t revealed any traces,”Guang Chengzi said with a bitter smile as they communicated with their consciousnesses.</p><p>The current situation was different from the past. When he ascended to godhood, his teacher was at the peak of the myriad worlds in the heavens. Other than the transcendents who were easily mistaken, he was known as the most ancient shore. Although the twelve immortals of the hollow jade temple had experienced a killing tribulation, they were full of confidence and had a strong backbone, he had never been afraid of any force. When he faced his senior Uncle Numinous Treasure, he dared to speak with confidence. At present, in order to seek the dao fruit, his master had disappeared for all eternity. All the traces and arrangements had been left behind by the ancient times, it was hard to believe that he would return in time. On the other hand, his senior uncle morality had been stopped by Amitabha, making it difficult for him to protect him.</p><p>Under such circumstances, who would dare to not listen to the warning of a genuine important figure on the other shore?</p><p>What would happen if they didn’t listen? In Guang Chengzi’s mind, the respective encounters of consort three firmament during the ascension to godhood had already surfaced. They were like moths to a flame, like mantises to a chariot. They couldn’t even cause the slightest ripple before they left dejectedly!</p><p>Daoist master Yu Ding sat upright, concealing his pride and indifference. He was more like a swordsman than an immortal. After the initial fear and shock had passed, he remained silent. It was only when he heard Guang Chengzi’s bitter words that he looked indifferently at his fellow disciples, he spoke concisely:</p><p>“What is the Hierarch?”</p><p>Without waiting for his fellow disciples to answer, he continued to speak:</p><p>“The symbol of a sect, the head of the Hollow Jade!”</p><p>“If even the Hierarch is killed, you and I are afraid of death and stand idly by, then why do we still need fellow disciples? Why do we still need the hollow jade temple? Why don’t we just disperse and go our separate ways!”</p><p>His words were resolute and decisive, and his body had already stood up. Spiritual Master Yu Ding’s imposing manner burst forth, and his sword intent soared to the sky. He looked at Guangchengzi and said in a clear voice,</p><p>“Our peers have long withered. What are you and I still doing? What are the four immortal slaying swords in our hands for?”</p><p>“There is no other shore. If we are bullied in front of the door, what is the use of retreating? Today, we can kill Junior Brother sect master by name. Tomorrow, we can write an invitation to self-destruct. There is nothing more common than a common enemy. If there is no way to retreat, there is no need to retreat anymore!”</p><p>Before Guang Chengzi could speak, Chi Jinzi, who was at the side, patted his purple sash immortal robe and stood up with a calm expression. He smiled and said,</p><p>“The four immortal slaying swords are in our hands. Without the protection of the other shore, we can avoid mother Wusheng today, but we can not escape the Jie sect’s revenge in the future. Moreover, once the sect master’s junior brother dies, burning lamp will be able to obtain the dao seal and ascend to the other shore. At that time, you and I can imagine our fate. Tomorrow is death, today is death. Can We stake everything? “If we don’t even have this little bit of courage, what can we use to seek the immortal path that is fated to be ethereal?”</p><p>After saying that, he walked to the side of Reverend Yu Ding and stood side by side. The killing immortal sword in his hand shone brightly.</p><p>The conversation from before made Nezha’s blood boil. He wanted nothing more than to stand up immediately and fight to the death on the battlefield. However, a hand suddenly appeared on his shoulder and gently pressed him to the ground.</p><p>Through his senses, the Dao Xing immortal venerable beside him returned to his usual smiling expression and said leisurely,</p><p>“The end of the tribulation is coming. You and I should face it. I’ll Go First!”</p><p>His Daoist robe fluttered, and a streak of black light rushed out of the hollow jade temple. It merged with the Immortal Sword of the bull in the Golden Garden Mountain, and the three dao flowers suddenly burned with an invisible flame, he pushed himself to the level of perfection of creation at all costs.</p><p>“Good!”Master Yu Ding shouted. The red glow was like a waterfall, flying out of the infinite height. The light gold around his body was flourishing, and he directly disintegrated his immortal body, turning everything into a terrifying sword light that reflected the stars in the sky.</p><p>The red essence bowed to the remaining Guangchengzi, Celestial Master Guangfa, and Nezha, then returned to Mount Taihua with his mind. Then, a white light pierced through space and time, surrounded by black, white, and Yin-yang, however, it quickly collapsed and condensed into the sword light.</p><p>He had also put his whole life’s cultivation into this sword!</p><p>“Haha, I’m afraid that the reason why teacher gave me the four swords of extermination is for today. Three Junior brothers, wait for me to face the tribulation together!”</p><p>Seeing this, Guang Chengzi laughed out loud. A clear light cloud about an acre in size appeared above the head of his original body in Jiuhua Mountain. It was surrounded by three illusory flowers that were about to bear dao fruits. Some were green and ancient, some were surrounded by purple clouds, and some were Yang and without yin, they disintegrated one after another, like endless kerosene that helped the sword of immortal execution burn fiercely.</p><p>Watching the four fellow disciples face the tribulation generously, Wen Shu’s spiritual altar, which had not fluctuated for tens of thousands of years, rippled. Her eyes were a little blurry. Just as she was about to follow them, she heard Guang Chengzi’s deep voice:</p><p>“Junior Sister Wen Shu, you have a good relationship with the Buddhist sect. You should be able to survive this tribulation. Please bear with the humiliation for Yuxu and preserve this body. I hope that you will ascend to the other shore in the future and prosper our sect!”</p><p>“Senior brother Guang Chengzi…”Wen Shu muttered. She watched as the green sword light chased after the first three streaks. It cut through the layers of time and space and slashed toward the vacuum hometown where the Netherworld was, only the last exhortation of Guangcheng zi echoed in his ears. “Watch Nezha well. Don’t let him try to be strong…”</p><p>The four sword lights, red, green, black, and white, were like moths that had burned all life, illuminating the darkness. They pounced toward the home of vacuum, which was suspended in the dense fog without hesitation. Three of them were at the completion of Destiny, and one was close to the other shore. They formed the celestial eradication sword formation, there was no retreat. There was no forward or backward. It was a race for time!</p><p>The Sword Qi was boundless, and the sword lights shattered everything. Guang Chengzi laughed and said,</p><p>“Reporting to old mother, our jade void palace has always been protective of our shortcomings!”</p><p>Red, green, black, and white lit up and fell toward the four poles of the home in the vacuum, bringing about the freezing of time, the shattering of the void, and the destruction of all things.</p><p>An indifferent, ethereal, and emotionless voice sounded:</p><p>“Even a grain of rice is shining?”</p><p>A perfect and flawless treasure light, as bright as the Moon, rose from the Netherworld, illuminating all the worlds in the universe. It contained everything, be it destruction, slaughter, or the other paths of termination, it was as if they had returned to their hometown.</p><p>The closer the four sword lights, the smaller they became. Gradually, they looked like dots of light in front of the full moon.</p><p>Then, the specks of light were enveloped by the moonlight and disappeared from Celestial Master Guangfa’s field of vision. There were no ripples at all.</p><p>Wherever the Dao was, there was no turning back. Moths flew into the fire, regardless of the consequences.</p><p>“Martial uncles!”Nezha struggled desperately. His fair face was mottled, but his body was locked by the Escape Dragon Pillar. He could not escape no matter how hard he tried.</p><p>Celestial Master Guangfa slowly closed his eyes. It was as if he had returned to the time before he became a god. Senior Brother Guangcheng rang the bell, senior brother Red Essence, senior brother Yu Ding, Senior Brother Dao Xing, senior brother Taiyi, and his fellow disciples came from their respective cave abodes, they gathered in front of their teacher’s seat and listened attentively to the sermon. When they were free, they would form groups of three to five and roam the myriad worlds.</p><p>At this point in time, other than Pu Xian and Ci Hang, whose fate was unknown, I was the only one left.</p><p>How Lonely..</p><p>..</p><p>Meng Qi seemed to have sensed what happened to Guangchengzi and his senior brothers. His eyes were already red. He looked at the absolute blade in front of him and forced a smile:</p><p>“Brother Dao, if I die today, you will follow Xiao sang. I hope you can protect her.”</p><p>As he spoke, he turned to look at Gu Xiao sang. He reached out his left hand, held his soft hand, and smiled:</p><p>“If I become a monster, I will wait for you to wake me up on the other shore.”</p><p>Before Gu Xiao sang could react to his words, Meng Qi’s eyes were filled with determination. He drew all of the Demonic Blood Peach’s aura into his body and released the absolute blade’s suppression on the remaining flesh and blood of Donghuang!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Sea of thunder rumbled, and the remaining flesh and blood of Donghuang squirmed wildly. From the Phantom image of the ancient bronze bell, it turned into a distorted pitch-black mass. After sensing the aura that made him drool, it rushed out of the blade and into Meng Qi’s body, the veins on his face bulged immediately, making his last smile look exceptionally ferocious.</p><p>At this moment, the primordial Qi cloud descended from above Meng Qi’s head and wrapped him along with Donghuang’s flesh and blood with boundless chaotic will, while the demonic blood peach was transferred to Gu Xiaosang.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A loud explosion shook the six paths of the three realms. The absolute blade glowed with purple light as if it had flown out of an illusory river of time. Lightning gathered in all directions as if it was worshipping the ruler. Its domineering will pierced through the past and the future.</p><p>With Donghuang’s flesh gone, the absolute blade was no longer bound!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
