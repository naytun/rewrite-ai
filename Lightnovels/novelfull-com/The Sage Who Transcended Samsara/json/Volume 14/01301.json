She could only vaguely understand that after her soul and flesh were separated and she fell into a deep sleep, who had ever bypassed the seal.., sneaking into the upper three levels of the immortal realm and leaving the birthday girl’s corpse in the Peach Garden of immortality, the specific reason was that the two of them were taking risks together. Was it a sudden attack because of the benefits, or was it done on purpose? It was unknown if there was another purpose.</p><p>At this moment, she looked at the remaining entrance of the heavenly prison. After a moment of silence, she said,</p><p>“The outer layer of the seal has been completely destroyed.”</p><p>If there were the Nine Heavens Old Gods and the earth ghost who were lucky enough to escape, they would be able to leave this place easily.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly. His body glowed as if he was an illusion. He passed through the crack and officially stepped into the celestial prison of the past. Then, he saw the dome towering like a boundless curtain of night, quietly covering the entire place. It was hard to see the edge, it was even wider than the floating continent itself, forming a world of its own.</p><p>There were countless jade pillars in this place. Each of them was a thousand feet tall. Meng Qi stood in the middle like an ordinary person who had come to the giant kingdom. From this, he could see how huge the bodies of the old gods and the old ghosts of the past were.</p><p>The mystical maiden of the nine heavens followed them in. As she extended her spiritual sense and looked around, Meng Qi’s voice suddenly rang in her ears, “I wonder when did the heavenly emperor attain the Dao and reach the other shore?”</p><p>“After sweeping away the old gods of the nine heavens and some of the old ghosts of the Earth, and obtaining the support of the Golden Emperor and the Black Emperor, the Heavenly Court was officially established. Not long after that, the highest level of the nine heavens was opened.”Liu Luo had personally experienced that period of history and had a deep impression of it.</p><p>Meng Qi’s heart skipped a beat, and he said in a gentle tone, “In the beginning, this world was impossible to enter?”</p><p>“Yes, only a real celestial emperor could open this world. As for whether the other important figures on the other side could do it before that, I don’t know.”Luoluo’s tone carried some nostalgia, it was as if he was recalling the grand occasion when the Heaven Court suppressed all the worlds in the universe.</p><p>“It seems that the highest level of the nine heavens really has many secrets, or perhaps it involves the key to the Celestial Emperor’s arrival on the other side…”Meng Qi could not help but sigh.</p><p>Liu Luo nodded slightly, expressing his agreement. The two of them moved forward together, going deeper into the place where the dome extended. The further they went, the more inclined they were to go down. The further they went, the darker their surroundings became. They could only feel the white jade pillar that was tainted with black gas flickering with a faint light, it barely illuminated the surrounding area.</p><p>The darkness revolved around them. It was as quiet as a deep pool, as deep as the underworld. It was as if there were one terrifying monster after another hiding there.</p><p>Fear came from the unknown. The unknown had a mysterious origin. The mystery was born from the Void and darkness.</p><p>Liu Luo was about to speak when she suddenly had a whim. She turned her gaze slightly and combined her soul consciousness to look at the deep darkness on the left. That place was quiet and unchanged, as if it had been like this for thousands of years.</p><p>She looked around and felt that there was something swimming in the darkness. Her tone finally became a little more serious:</p><p>“I always feel that there are a pair of eyes watching us, watching us quietly from all directions, but it also seems to be an illusion. There are no other traces, and there is no sign of Qi…”</p><p>Meng Qi walked forward with his hands behind his back. He smiled and followed Liuluo’s gaze:</p><p>“I have the same feeling.”</p><p>He did not seem to mind this at all. He was not worried at all. Other than the light gold floating around his body, it was as if he was leisurely walking around his own hollow jade temple, he even asked casually, “What was the image of the Thunder God in the heaven? was there anything special about him?”</p><p>As a great divine arts practitioner who was in charge of the Heavenly Court’s expedition, Liu Luo was naturally not frightened by the mysterious and strange peeping. His heart was calm as he replied casually, “It’s nothing special.”</p><p>“Back then, the thunder god was known for his loyalty and ferocity. He was not interested in power. Other than his love for battles, he spent his free time thinking about his own dao. He hoped that the Thunder technique would have another breakthrough so that he could get rid of the restriction of the innate divine body. To be honest, when I found out that he had betrayed the heavenly monarch, the Buddhist body that he slashed out had also betrayed the Spirit Mountain and fallen to become a demon Buddha, I could hardly believe it.”</p><p>“A living being can disguise for a while, but it is impossible to disguise all the way until the turning point. Ever since the Thunder God was born in the ancient thunder sea, his loyalty and loyalty has always been with him. Until the fall of the heavenly court, it has never changed. My colleagues and I don’t think there is any problem at all.”</p><p>No, before the fall of the Heavenly Court, before the Devil Lord fought in the immortal world, the Thunder God already had a different mind! Meng Qi was slightly stunned when he heard that. The mysterious lady of the nine heavens had such an impression of thunder god. Even now, she had not realized that thunder god had already begun to betray her.</p><p>This showed how good the previous incarnation of the Devil Buddha was at disguising himself!</p><p>Was it almost a natural ability?</p><p>Without explaining this matter, Meng Qi walked forward under the deep and dark surrounding, he thought for a moment and said, “Lady Mysterious, do you think that Thunder God’s betrayal of the heavenly emperor is related to the highest level of the nine heavens? After all, for a god to be able to freely enter and exit this realm, other than the heavenly emperor’s guards who do not have their own will, there is only him and the Heavenly Emperor.”</p><p>“It’s possible.”Liu Luo did not hesitate, and her beautiful chin gently nodded, “Perhaps this world contains the secret of reaching the other shore, and even the dao fruit is related, which caused the thunder god to have a change of heart, which is why many important figures from the other shore joined hands to invade the heaven…”</p><p>This was her speculation and thought for many years.</p><p>Meng Qi was about to ask again when a faint light appeared. In front of his eyes, there was already an additional road leading to the underground. The steps were magnificent, one hundred feet high and one hundred and twenty feet wide. It was as if a giant had built it for itself, and it was relatively well preserved, they did not seem to have been damaged by the aftershocks.</p><p>As they flew up, Meng Qi and the mystical maiden of the nine heavens were like two fleas. As they flew down the steps, they brought a faint light to the deep darkness. The prying intent around them did not decrease, but instead increased, making people’s hair stand on end, it was as if they were about to encounter an unknown danger at any time.</p><p>They did not know how long they had gone in like this. The water in front of them rippled and glowed with a golden color. A region appeared vaguely, and the steps came to an end.</p><p>Meng Qi and Liu Luo saw a huge creature curled up in the core of the realm. Each of its golden scales was like a star in the sky, floating and shining. It contained the universe, but it was also dead and broken. It had come to an end.</p><p>It was a true dragon that was filled with antiquity and decay. Its body seemed to be only dozens of miles long, but Meng Qi felt as if it could be counted in light years. Its eyes were closed, and its life force had been cut off. Only death was still emitting its aura, it was enough to show how powerful it was when it was alive.</p><p>“The six heavens ancestral dragon, the first true dragon to be born in this era. It was the dragon vein of the sixth level of the immortal world that gave birth to its own will and took form. It wanted to fight for the position of the heavenly emperor, but could not. It tried to stir up a flood and destroy the world. It was captured alive by the Heavenly Emperor, the Thunder God, and US. Unexpectedly, it has been imprisoned here all this time,”said Liu Luo with a sigh, “That battle killed the true dragon, and since then, the dragon race has declined. It no longer has the strength to meddle in the affairs of Heaven and Earth.”</p><p>Meng Qi walked to the front of the six heavens ancestral dragon and looked up at his mountain-like head. He recalled the glorious journey when the Heavenly Emperor ascended to the position of the nine heavens supremacy step by step.</p><p>He did not know how many powerful true spirits that were born at the beginning of Heaven and earth were defeated and how many powerful people who attempted to ascend to the throne of Supremacy were repelled. It was not a fluke that he was able to obtain the support of the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning and the heavenly venerate of morals. Instead, it was his own family that earned it bit by bit!</p><p>He was indeed worthy of being the heavenly emperor who had stepped on time and suppressed the entire world!</p><p>The six heaven ancestral dragon’s face was mottled with scales, as if it had been stained with the dust of time. Its eyes were tightly shut, and there was no life in them. No matter how strong it was in the past, no matter how terrifying it was, it could not escape the end of its life under the erosion of time.</p><p>Liu Luo was sighing in his heart when a thought suddenly came to his mind:</p><p>Su Meng was approaching without any obstruction, which meant that the inner forbidden spell around the six heaven ancestral dragon was also damaged. If that was the case, why didn’t he escape from here? Instead, he sat here and waited for his lifespan to run out.</p><p>Just as she thought about it, she felt a strong and cold aura gushing out from the six heavens ancestral dragon’s body, sweeping across the surroundings. His tightly shut eyes suddenly opened, and his eyes were sparkling, jumping with two dark green and cold flames!</p><p>‘He didn’t die?’?</p><p>‘did his body give birth to a new intelligence?’?</p><p>The six heavens ancestral dragon’s huge mouth opened and was about to roar. At this moment, a huge pale golden palm suddenly appeared out of nowhere and pressed down on the huge dragon’s head, pressing the pale breath back directly!</p><p>Crack Crack Crack!</p><p>The dragon’s body let out crisp sounds, even with all its strength, it was useless. It was actually pressed down by the palm, like a loach.</p><p>At this time, a golden giant stood in front of the six heavenly ancestral dragon, filling up this world. In front of it, the six heavenly ancestral dragon actually felt tiny, it was the form of Meng Qi’s heavenly form!</p><p>PA!</p><p>The six heavenly ancestral dragon’s body suddenly shattered, as though it had been weathered for a long time, a faint silhouette rushed out from within, throwing itself into the darkness, one could only vaguely see that it didn’t have a head!</p><p>“The undying body has actually decayed.”Liu Luo looked at this scene, his expression changed slightly.</p><p>Meng Qi retracted his changes, smiling, “There’s something strange about this place, let’s continue forward.”</p><p>Liu Luo pondered for a while, “Aren’t you afraid? Aren’t you afraid that the Old Gods and ghosts imprisoned below will all have such changes?”</p><p>Meng Qi crossed his arms and smiled,</p><p>“Afraid of them? After the erosion of the ages, even if there is a change, it will be destroyed or decline!”</p><p>“If it was before the legend, I might be afraid, but now I have become one of the few great divine arts practitioners in the world. If I am afraid of these Old Gods and ghosts that have declined for a long time, what is the use of cultivating?”</p><p>Saying this, he looked at liuluo and said leisurely,</p><p>“Their era has passed.”</p><p>“Their era has passed… What about ours…”Liuluo was suddenly in a daze.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
