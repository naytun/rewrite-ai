The Devil Buddha extended his right hand, bent his four fingers, and used his thumb to point out “Absolute saint forsaken wisdom”. He had already pressed into the hollow jade temple, he pressed onto the primal chaos light and the Golden Lotus hanging in front of Meng Qi’s forehead.</p><p>Dark red and black flashed, and the Golden Lotus floated down. Meng Qi seemed to be still affected by he mu and jiu Li’s successful “Sneak attack”. His reaction was actually slow, until the water curtain-like primal chaos light in front of the eaves cracked, the devil Buddha’s “Saint Forsaken Wisdom”finger was about to touch the center of his brows when he reached out his hands. The absolute blade in one hand materialized, and purple lightning collapsed. Life and death continued. A strange light rose from the other hand, and purple, white, and golden yellow light appeared, it blocked the center of his brows and smashed toward the devil Buddha’s dark and terrifying evil body!</p><p>Seeing this, not only did the devil Buddha not feel annoyed, but he revealed a cold smile. His body suddenly collapsed, turning into distorted black shadows that shot toward Meng Qi from every corner, as if they were enveloping him.</p><p>Go to hell!</p><p>Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang Bang! All the collisions were completed at the same time, converging into a single sound, the reverse palm of Tathagata’s “Dance of Ten Thousand Devils”!</p><p>The golden flowers of virtue withered, the streaks of virtue and purple clouds scattered, and streaks of purple lightning and dark thunder exploded, like fireworks blooming, setting off the dark and fearful body of the devil and the powerless Meng Qi who was sitting cross-legged on the cloud bed.</p><p>His light hand with three treasures rose up and blocked many of the arms of the demon Buddha. However, the purple lightning palm between his eyebrows could not stop the finger of absolute saint forsaken wisdom. It was hit between his eyebrows and could only hold the arm of the demon Buddha tightly, it prevented his finger from going one step further, crushing the true spirit and affecting the spiritual light of his nature.</p><p>Just like that, the power of absolute saint forsaken wisdom surged through and turned into the red and black reverse ten thousand symbol that devoured and assimilated. It kept attacking Meng Qi’s dao body, like sharp teeth that were gnawed off.</p><p>The Devil Buddha wanted to eat Meng Qi and achieve perfection!</p><p>The finger moved forward slowly but was unusually firm and had an obvious advantage. Meng Qi’s Wuji, Dao Yi, and heaven-opening three seals were shot out by the god-like spirits from each of his apertures one after another, but they were restrained by his own body, the blood that entered earlier was affected by the fusang ancient tree that stood behind the Devil Buddha. It swayed gently and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>The demon Buddha’s eyes were red and black. He was mad and ferocious. He used all his strength and pressed Meng Qi’s palms so hard that they slowly bent and almost went out of control.</p><p>“I have completely buried the past, present, and future of the Haotian God. I only have a little life force and memory left. I relied on the legacy of the DAO Master that I inherited from Donghuang to deceive the heavens and cross the sea. I entrusted the reincarnation of the immemorial thunder pool to myself. It was as if I had truly fallen, i wanted to escape the fate of the last era of the immemorial era. I wanted to rerule the world and obtain the dao fruit. I wanted to do it today!</p><p>As long as I swallowed you, achieved perfection, assimilated your realm and divine abilities, and refined the netherworld, with the power of the Fusang ancient tree, when the end came, I would be the strongest shore. I would be the key to the start of the next era!</p><p>Moreover, with this, the three pure ones will not be able to transcend. If they do not help me, they will sink together and perish together!</p><p>Hundreds of millions of years have passed. I am a vengeful evil spirit that should have died a long time ago, but has lived from the archaic era to the present!</p><p>After setting up for so many years, enduring for so many years, and waiting for so many years, at this time, who else can save you? !</p><p>“True rulai”had a calm expression. His thumb and middle finger intersected, and he leisurely swept out, bringing with him a pure Buddhist light that swept towards the Devil Buddha. However, the pure white light erupted, not allowing the slightest impurity, and it immediately shocked him to the spot, he saw a giant mouth with forty Buddha Teeth Open and swallow him.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>A pale golden fist suddenly struck out, and the terrifying giant mouth that was surrounded by pure white light was sent flying. “Daolord Qingyuan”activated 80-90% of his power, and a heavenly phenomenon appeared as he fought against the Supreme True Buddha. However, in front of “True Rulai of Tranquility”.., another chaotic and crazy dark-red giant hand appeared, blocking his palm that could “Save all living things.”.</p><p>The realm of the Fusang ancient tree collapsed inch by inch and merged with the Immortal World Beyond the sea that was infested by demonic qi. The Green Emperor sat in the lotus position and resisted the backlash from the origin. He slowly pulled them out and had no time to care about anything else.</p><p>Many eras ago, when the heaven and earth were created, the heavenly venerate of virtue and Amitabha were in a fierce battle. Outside the real world, the heavenly emperor paid the price of withering the building wood in advance and combined with the blade of time to prevent the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning from returning from his journey to the west, the mountain and river map relied on the suppression of the human emperor sword and the demon Saint Spear to sway and bind the god-sealing world.</p><p>In the hometown of vacuum, the bright moon hung high in the sky and shone with a cold light. There were two indifferent eyes that quietly watched as the demon Buddha slowly swallowed Meng Qi and did not make a move, however, it seemed as if it could expose any intention to save Meng Qi at any time.</p><p>In the Bodhi Pure Land, the quasi-ti Daoist, the Xuanming Ghost Emperor, and the Black Heavenly Emperor formed a formation in an attempt to use their own survival to implicate the Bodhi ancient Buddha.</p><p>The Bodhi ancient Buddha’s golden body was pure and quiet. He did not do anything, as if he had already accepted reality and was calmly watching the life and death struggle in the hollow jade temple.</p><p>Suddenly, he smiled at the quasi-lift Daoist and said elegantly,</p><p>“The Devil Buddha is a traitor by nature and has many hidden hands. If I cooperate with him, how can I not be more vigilant?”</p><p>“What?”The quasi-lift Daoist blurted out, and he suddenly had a bad premonition.</p><p>Bodhisattva ancient Buddha chuckled:</p><p>“After the three corpses are complete, I originally wanted to let you guys become independent one after another, inherit my name, and bear my karma. This is a path that only belongs to me.”</p><p>“This wasn’t supposed to be easy. I prepared for an era before I almost touched the threshold, and planned to attempt the final tribulation. Who knew that I would encounter Fengdu’s fall. Now, I have to thank fellow Daoist Devil Buddha for helping me to complete it easily. Next, I might have a chance to pick up some scraps.”</p><p>He looked at the expressions of the Zhundi Daoist, Ghost Emperor Xuanming, and the black celestial emperor that changed in an instant and said leisurely,</p><p>“As for now, why do I need to save the origin, the Numinous Treasure, and the key to achieving the dao fruit of morality to help them transcend?”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang gathered the future and returned it to herself at the current node. Then, she saw lights rising in many parts of the past. They were the marks left by Meng Qi when he brought her back to the past. They formed a fulcrum, allowing her to find her way.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang escaped and went against the current. She completely cut off her sense of the outside world because she knew that the only way to help was to get out of the Sea of pain and reach the other shore as soon as possible!</p><p>The seven kills priest restrained he mu and Jiu Li. Seeing that the Devil Buddha had the upper hand and was constantly swallowing and digesting the Hierarch Celestial Master, Fear Rose in his heart again. He just wanted to escape from this world and escape.</p><p>Just as he was about to escape, a thought suddenly appeared in his heart.</p><p>He could retreat in the past, but if he retreated this time, was there a way out?</p><p>If the Devil Buddha devoured and assimilated the Hierarch Celestial Master, not only would he achieve perfection, but he could also advance many steps. After all, his previous strength was weakened because of the Hierarch Celestial Master’s elevation. When that time came, where would he escape to, where would he hide? who on the other side would be willing to offend the Devil Buddha, who had grasped the key to the next era, when he was not involved in the battle for the Dao Fruit?</p><p>This time, there was no retreat!</p><p>With that thought in mind, the seven kills Daoist instantly surged with killing intent. His body turned into a black light and merged with the Netherworld Sea Sword.</p><p>“Either you die, or I Die!”The sword light spread out, and with an unprecedented momentum, it cut through time and space and slashed at the Devil Buddha.</p><p>The leaves of the Fusang ancient tree behind the Devil Buddha suddenly shook, emitting a clear light and resisting the sword light of the Netherworld Sea Sword.</p><p>Silently, the sword light dissipated, and only a leaf fell from the fusang ancient tree. Daoist seven kills’face was as white as snow, and his eyes were full of despair. Even with his full strength, his sword could not break the Devil Buddha’s defense.</p><p>The Devil Buddha let out a crazy laugh, and his finger, which had pierced into Meng Qi’s glabella, went one inch deeper, absorbing and devouring more and more intensely:</p><p>“The Fusang ancient tree is the key to the opening of the next era. It is a treasure that is close to the dao fruit. It was painstakingly refined by the holy man in the past. After absorbing the essence of the destruction of the previous era, it is not the real nirvana. A divine weapon of the same level will not be able to break its defense. It is far better than the tree of Great Dao that you have yet to grow. The Green Emperor tried to refine it for many years but failed!”</p><p>“Not the fake nirvana stage, not the Nirvana stage. I wonder which Nirvana Stage will come to save you!”</p><p>The Devil Buddha seemed to be in a crazed state. He revealed his demonic state and a samsara seal flew out in front of him. As it turned the heavens, it changed the overall situation and wanted to absorb Meng Qi faster.</p><p>Monkey King and the rest who had the Nirvana stage magic treasures such as the flame flag attacked from afar. However, they could not do anything to the Fusang ancient tree.</p><p>The Devil Buddha laughed maniacally, shaking their hearts and confusing their minds. However, he completely ignored them. There was only madness and ecstasy in his eyes as he stared fixedly at Meng Qi, he had to remember his ugly state when he was completely destroyed.</p><p>In order to hide from the other side, not only did I set up a trap to make people think that Haotian had reincarnated as Emperor Qing, and that it was the eastern emperor who was struggling to survive, but I also did something that was close to harming my own soul!</p><p>Today was the time to reap the rewards!</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly felt that the finger between Meng Qi’s eyebrows had stopped moving. The wrist that was held by the Purple Lightning God seemed to have fallen into a shackle and was sealed!</p><p>Meng Qi, who had always been calm, looked at the Devil Buddha and said with a smile,</p><p>“What if I knew? What if I knew that you were Haotian’s God?”</p><p>What? The demon Buddha narrowed his eyes, and his madness faded away, revealing his wisdom.</p><p>The Ultimate Wuji Primordial Qi above Meng Qi’s head shone again. An arm appeared in front of him, and his fist instantly opened, revealing the Haotian’s blood ray that he mu and Jiu Li had ambushed him with.</p><p>The Blood Ray flew away and fell bit by bit, and the smile in Meng Qi’s eyes became even more obvious.</p><p>In the past, Fox Qingqiu had secretly told me something, he said, “Demon Saint was born at the beginning of Heaven and earth and survived for several epochs. He is knowledgeable and insightful, and his spiritual cultivation isn’t inferior to Buddha’s. How could he suddenly fall in love with Ah Nan at the end of the ancient era?” Later on, I learned that Ah Nan was the Thunder God’s Buddhist body. I felt that both of them were innate spirits, and both of them were good fortune, so they could be considered compatible.</p><p>However, the real point in his words was that “After several epochs,”how could demon Saint Fall in love with a great divine arts practitioner who didn’t have the same experience? They were on completely different levels!</p><p>And Lu Ya’s betrayal of the original teacher made me begin to doubt.</p><p>When I discovered many things about thunder god, I became even more puzzled. How did demon Saint Take a fancy to you?</p><p>Only the Great Heavenly God, who had suppressed the primeval era and made it difficult for Donghuang to reach the other shore, and the Dao master almost failed to obtain the dao fruit, and the demon race finally became his subordinates, and nine Phoenixes didn’t forget to resurrect even after death, could do it!</p><p>Of course, later on, he realized that there were others who had pointed out his identity as the Haotian God.</p><p>As for why he had to show weakness first and put himself in such a sorry state, it was so that he could sink into a state of devouring and assimilation, where he could be restrained by him and could not escape for a moment!</p><p>At the sight of the blood ray that turned inch by inch into ashes, an extreme sense of danger rose in the heart of the Devil Buddha. However, Meng Qi had Wuji in one hand, Dao in the other, purple lightning in the other, and the three treasures in the other, trapping him firmly!</p><p>An invisible flame flashed and the Devil Buddha felt that the Fusang ancient tree had been swept away. A sharp object had pierced through his evil armor and entered through it.</p><p>He sensed it and saw a black golden spear with Phoenix Wings extended from the Monster Emperor Palace. It pierced through the layers of space and time and struck him!</p><p>The Gold Emperor and Bodhi ancient Buddha could not react to this attack!</p><p>Meanwhile, the mountain and river map and the human emperor sword had already flown back and circled around the monster Emperor Palace.</p><p>The Monster Emperor had given up on stopping the heavenly venerate numinous treasure? Was he not afraid that the situation would be reversed? was he not afraid that the three Pure Ones would transcend the Dao? The Devil Buddha’s body squirmed and contracted, resisting the burning of the invisible fire.</p><p>In the monster Emperor Palace, the layers of curtains suddenly parted. The Monster Emperor, who had not appeared in front of the world for a long, long time, stepped out. His face was as beautiful as the world, hard to describe, and his aura was very strange, there was actually a bit of residue that did not belong to the Monster Emperor!</p><p>She held the Black Golden Spear with Phoenix wings in her hand, and her eyes were filled with hatred and hatred. She said coldly,</p><p>“I gave up on myself and was willing to replace the monster emperor with a bit of spiritual light. I became the product of him reducing the void, accepting his brand, the past, and the future. What I have been waiting for is also today!”</p><p>Devil Buddha’s expression changed drastically, and he blurted out,</p><p>“Fengxi!”</p><p>Demon Saint Fengxi!</p><p>Those who are ungrateful and fortunate, kill!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
