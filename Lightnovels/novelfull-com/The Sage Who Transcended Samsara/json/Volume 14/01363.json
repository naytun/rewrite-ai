He saw a world shrouded in a hazy light. It was a thousand times larger than all the cosmic light fragments he had seen before, and it gave him an inexplicable sense of familiarity.</p><p>This is it… Han Guang’s heart palpitated. Instead, a carefree smile appeared on his face, and he appeared to be at ease.</p><p>After forty years of dreaming, he could no longer sense the existence of this cosmic light fragment. Even when he communicated with the myriad worlds, he could not sense it. It was as if it was really a dream.</p><p>He descended the escape light and concealed his figure. He quietly entered Jade Emperor Mountain, and everywhere he passed, all the restrictions seemed to have disappeared.</p><p>“The void and the strange lightning tribulation have turned into ashes… it happened to be when I left the ‘dream’and returned to reality. It seems like someone deliberately erased the traces of my existence in this world…”in the Scripture obituary pavilion, han Guang held the mysterious Heaven Sect’s books in his hand and flipped through them casually. People came and went around him, and they felt it was only natural when they saw him, “On the other hand, Daoist Shoujing even obtained a dharma body after that. He passed away a few years ago and was buried in the mountains… It’s a little strange…”</p><p>Han Guang put the books away in their original form and left leisurely with his hands behind his back. In an instant, he appeared outside Daoist Shoujing’s mausoleum.</p><p>The tomb was not big and had a gray-white base. There was a stone tablet in front of the tomb with the name written on it.</p><p>“At least he was my master…”Han Guang sighed and mocked himself. He bowed in accordance with the etiquette of the mysterious Sky sect. Only then did he cross the layers of restrictions and enter the interior of the tomb. He saw the black wooden coffin that stopped in the middle, for some reason, his spiritual sense could not penetrate this seemingly ordinary black wooden coffin.</p><p>“There is indeed something strange,”Han Guang muttered to himself with a chuckle. He focused all his attention in secret and pushed his right hand forward.</p><p>The sound of friction rang out. The lid of the coffin slowly opened in an unusually heavy manner, revealing the scene inside:</p><p>There was nothing, nothing!</p><p>The Shoujing Daoist who had died of old age had actually disappeared!</p><p>Han Guang instantly felt a chill rise from the soles of his feet, as if he had stepped into a terrifying and fatal trap. He had encountered an ancient and powerful enemy that he was unable to resist.</p><p>At this moment, a wave flashed before his eyes, and a long, sparkling blade appeared from the void.</p><p>The time blade!</p><p>The time blade that the primordial Lord of Heaven Su Meng had used to escape when he attained the Dao had actually been hidden here!</p><p>The Thoughts in Han Guang’s mind went back and forth, and he suddenly understood the hint that the devil Buddha had yet to make clear. He smiled at the time blade and said, “Senior, please pass on these four words to the heavenly emperor. This is what the Devil Buddha said.”</p><p>He paused, and seeing that the blade of time was as indifferent as the passage of time, he said the four words:</p><p>“The body of the Fu Emperor.”</p><p>The light wavered, flickering, and the dream came to life. The blade of time rippled and then disappeared.</p><p>Han Guang stood with his hands behind his back, his expression relaxed, and a question flashed in his heart:</p><p>If it was just to pass on the message to the celestial emperor, there was no need to go through so much trouble. Wouldn’t it be enough to silently recite his name in his heart?</p><p>Could it be that such an action could not be hidden from the other shore?</p><p>Or could it be that one had to face the legend in order to achieve a certain goal?</p><p>As a devil who was good at thinking and grasping people’s hearts, Han Guang vaguely felt that he had touched on a key point.</p><p>..</p><p>In the land of Buddha, Daoist ci hang sat on a lotus throne and appeared in front of the world as a white-robed scholar. He held a jade clear bottle in his hand and fiddled with willow branches. He used a solemn and grand voice to preach the Dharma and compassion to the densely packed Luo cult believers around him.</p><p>However, after he felt the strong hearts that were filled with hatred, he felt somewhat powerless. It seemed that the best way was to forcibly convert them with the light of Buddha. Why did he have to torture himself?</p><p>He took a light breath, and a benevolent smile hung on the corner of his mouth. He stopped talking about Buddhism and said instead,</p><p>“You have been in the land of Buddha for many days. Have you ever discovered the similarities between this place and your hometown of vacuum?”</p><p>Before he finished speaking, the expressions of the followers of Luoism changed slightly, because everyone had an inexplicable sense of familiarity with the Buddhist kingdom on Earth.</p><p>Daoist Cihang’s solemn and grand voice rang out again:</p><p>“They are all the end of the world. They are all treasure rafts for crossing worlds. They are all white lotuses. They are all descended to be rescued. They are all merciful and joyful…”</p><p>As he said the similarities one by one, the followers of Luoism looked at each other in dismay. They were at a loss and did not know how to explain.</p><p>In the end, his voice suddenly became louder, like the sound of thunder:</p><p>“Don’t you understand? The two religions are first-class, and they both worship the savior who used the White Lotus as a symbol</p><p>“However, the oracles below the Savior have their own plans and do their own things. They only want to have the greatest merit, and describe the other party as an unpardonable evil, so as to deceive you into hating each other</p><p>“If you are not sincere in repentance and reclaiming your compassion, when will it be?”</p><p>As a great bodhisattva, Daoist Cihang had never lied. His words were vague, but they were not lies. The teachings of the godless mother were derived from Maitreya’s White Lotus sect!</p><p>At this moment, he wanted to use this to break the hearts of the stubborn followers of Luoism. It would be convenient for him to teach them to understand themselves in the future and to find the Tathagata in their hearts.</p><p>Crossing people and crossing hearts, this was the true meaning of salvation, and this was what the Order of the Hierarch Heavenly Venerate meant!</p><p>In the center of the Buddhist kingdom on Earth, Maitreya, who was lying on his side on the lotus throne, acted as if he had not seen or tried to stop Guanyin’s actions and attempts because of his relationship with the primordial heavenly venerate Meng Qi. In any case, he still belonged to the Buddhist line, he could not escape the boundaries of the Buddhist kingdom on Earth.</p><p>His eyes were half-open, half-closed, and he breathed out the rewards of his great wish. He cultivated the dharma to repay both of his bodies, accumulating the rewards in return, waiting for the opportunity to free himself from the Sea of pain to come.</p><p>..</p><p>In the depths of the netherworld, the demon lord, with his white hair draped over his shoulders and dressed in the clothes of the end of ancient times, left his seclusion and entered the lowest level of the netherworld. He bypassed Daoist seven kills and entered the core of the Netherworld Sea ruins, it was also the place closest to the origin of the netherworld.</p><p>He sat cross-legged here, as if he was comprehending the thoughts of the most evil and impure, as if he wanted to use this to cultivate.</p><p>Nine Chaos Celestial Master, Daoist Seven Kills, and the others only glanced at the demon lord’s actions. They did not react in any way, because it was perfectly normal.</p><p>There was not a false other shore that did not want to become the true other shore!</p><p>..</p><p>Time passed, and another ten years passed.</p><p>The Buddhist kingdom on Earth had already reached the immortal world beyond the seas in the east, the polar regions in the north, the great wilderness in the south, and the deep sea in the west. Everyone was chanting Buddha, and glass could be seen everywhere. Faint golden light continuously gathered in Changle City.</p><p>White lotuses were everywhere in the city, and the fragrance of flowers assailed everyone’s nostrils. It was quiet and self-generating. Maitreya, who was cultivating on his side, suddenly trembled. He sat up straight and began to recite the scriptures in a grand and solemn voice:</p><p>“When the star tribulation comes in the future, there will be Buddha returning from the destruction and guiding all living things. I hope that everyone will have compassion and become the Buddha of the future…”</p><p>The scriptures reverberated, and the earth surged with Brahma. The light of Buddha descended from the sky and enveloped Maitreya. A golden body of the Buddha of the future with twenty heads and sixteen arms, covered in Resplendent Starlight, appeared. All the scriptures converged into two mighty lines:</p><p>“If I attain bodhi, then everyone will be Buddha during the end of Dharma</p><p>“If I attain bodhi, I will not lead all living beings, save the end of the world, and seek for the future!”</p><p>After experiencing the defeat of the ancient times, the death tribulation of the Middle Ages, and the near-ancient tribulations, Maitreya, who had been granted the title of future Buddha, finally found the opportunity to take the step to reach the other shore!</p><p>In the Western Paradise, the six-foot-long Golden Buddha looked at this scene with benevolence in his eyes.</p><p>In the Jade Void Palace of Kunlun’s field, it was as if the eternal silence had been broken. Meng Qi, the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning, opened his eyes and looked at the Buddha Kingdom on the ground.</p><p>In the Monster Emperor Palace, the Tusita Palace, the home of the vacuum, the Bodhi Pure Land, the Fusang Ancient Tree realm, and in the dark depths, many gazes were cast over.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
