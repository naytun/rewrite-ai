The nine heavens were filled with flames, lightning, crevices, and chaotic holes. Especially the top layer, it had almost completely disappeared into nothingness, leaving only a few remaining places.</p><p>Meng Qi appeared here. The supreme infinite origin Shi Qing cloud hung high above his head. It was like a dot of mist, and it was both static and moving. Rays of dim light like water hung down, and gold lanterns, pearls, and other objects floated up and down. He took a step forward, he had already reached the vicinity of the towering and magnificent construction tree.</p><p>Although the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning had left behind the words “The dao fruit is not a foreign object”, in the later generations, when he entered this place, he had not discovered the existence of the construction tree fruit. This time, he came here to see which other shore would take it away, perhaps in the future, there would be changes because of this.</p><p>The construction tree held up the sky and penetrated into the chaos. It penetrated into places that were difficult to reach. Originally, it was difficult to see the branches, but at this moment, one could see that there was a hazy, clear light sprinkling down, a fruit that seemed to contain all colors, all rules, all principles, all possible dao patterns fell down. All the opposite concepts and descriptions were perfectly integrated from a higher level.</p><p>And the palm that held this fruit was glowing with a faint golden luster. Following the trail, Meng Qi saw a six-foot-tall, sallow, emaciated, and compassionate monk.</p><p>Buddha!</p><p>The Buddha without any prefix, the former leader of the Saha World, one of the only two transcendents!</p><p>It was he who finally got the fruit!</p><p>At this time, the powerful Wills of Bodhi ancient Buddha, Amitabha Buddha, Lingbao heavenly venerate, moral heavenly venerate, and primordial beginning heavenly venerate disappeared in an instant, surpassing the fading of the tide and not competing with Lingshan Buddha.</p><p>Seeing this scene, Meng Qi suddenly understood why not long after the fall of the Heavenly Court, Buddha entered the destruction of Lingshan and became a dao fruit.</p><p>Although Buddha’s transcendence method had some improvements, it basically followed the path of the former Dao venerate. Therefore, primordial beginning heavenly venerate did not lie about external things and did not fight for it, but he wanted to get the fruit of construction wood, this item did have a certain effect on the achievement of the Dao fruit. If it was not true, how could it tempt the heavenly emperor to try to hide it?</p><p>Holding the fruit in his hand, Buddha suddenly looked over and looked at Meng Qi. His eyes were filled with layers of glass. The myriad realms in the heavens, the nine serenities hell, and various places that were close to the Dao were all hidden deep within.</p><p>Facing his gaze, Meng Qi chuckled. His gaze did not hesitate to meet it. There was not the slightest bit of fear.</p><p>PA!</p><p>Endless light erupted. It was so pure that it could not tolerate the slightest bit of debris. However, on the other side, the void was extremely dark. It revealed true chaos. It encompassed the past and the future, assimilating everything. The two collided, half was light and half was darkness. They destroyed each other, and everything seemed to no longer exist.</p><p>Buddha had already achieved the dao fruit, who else could he leave behind?</p><p>Supreme True Buddha!</p><p>Just as the Supreme True Buddha revealed forty Buddha Teeth, something on Meng Qi’s body suddenly trembled, emitting an inexplicable aura that made him suddenly terrified.</p><p>It was the shell of his own golden cicada that had shed its shell!</p><p>It was something that could restrain him!</p><p>The Supreme True Buddha did not dare to stay any longer. He immediately formed a seal with his hands and used the divine palm to dissolve his Earth, fire, wind, and water. The four elements were all empty, and he escaped stealthily.</p><p>Meng Qi did not try to track him down. Instead, he took out the golden cicada shell and slowly rubbed it.</p><p>This object had no other functions. He did not expect it to suppress and weaken the Supreme True Buddha. If used well, it could resist the higan-level divine weapon.</p><p>After figuring out the final location of the fruit, he immediately disappeared, leaving only traces behind. He returned to the Jade Void Palace of Kunlun’s field at the current node.</p><p>..</p><p>On Changmen Island, in a place irrigated by a spiritual spring.</p><p>As usual, Xia Xiu came to check if the lotus seed she had planted had bloomed. After all these years, it seemed to have withered and died. There had been no movement at all, but the more it did so, the more she felt that the lotus seed was not an ordinary object.</p><p>Before she could get close, her expression suddenly froze. She noticed that the pond where the lotus seed had been planted had dried up, and even the nearby spiritual spring had temporarily stopped flowing.</p><p>Xia Xiu hurriedly checked and saw that the pond had turned into mud and stone. The lotus seed had strangely disappeared, leaving behind only three fresh and dripping petals.</p><p>“The lotus seed bloomed and flew away on its own?”Xia Xiu hurriedly picked up the three white petals.</p><p>As soon as they entered her hands, they immediately transformed into aura and entered Xia Xiu’s body, increasing her aptitude.</p><p>In just a few breaths, Xia Xiu felt like she had been reborn. Her body was as light as a swallow, surpassing more than ten years of bitter cultivation!</p><p>She composed herself, took out the myriad realms general knowledge talisman, and contacted Tan Ping, telling him in detail what had happened just now. She wanted to hear the opinions of this older brother who was becoming more and more knowledgeable.</p><p>Tan Ping had already obtained the first treasure set up by the water ancestor. He had returned to Changmen Island and was now a martial grandmaster. He was only one step away from becoming a dharma body. Once he broke through this cultivation difficulty, he would have a smooth journey ahead of him.</p><p>“Could this matter be related to the middle-earth’s ‘Holy Mother White Lotus’trying to verify the Dao?”Tan ping naturally knew the meaning of the history that Xia Xiu had witnessed, he knew that the corpse was the previous body of the current ‘Holy Mother White Lotus’.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Xia Xiu said doubtfully, “Forget it. Since the matter has already been settled, I’ve also received the benefits of being reborn.”</p><p>“That’s right. This kind of matter can not be investigated to the bottom,”Tan Ping said.</p><p>However, he kept feeling that something was wrong. It was as if the original history should not be like this.</p><p>Even if the water ancestor was reincarnated and did not become a legend or prove his good fortune, it was still difficult to notice the changes in the past.</p><p>..</p><p>After more than ten years of recovery, the world-wide world-wide world-wide world-wide-understanding once again had the prosperous atmosphere of more than a hundred years ago. The virtual martial arts competition, the World Arena competition, the Martial Arts Exchange Group, the teaching website, the video live broadcast, the Forum competition, and so on all returned!</p><p>In the Jianghu Teahouse, someone posted a mottled yellow-brown scroll. It was a young Daoist standing on the peak of the mountain. He wore a dark Daoist robe and an ancient crown. His face was handsome and his temperament was deep. He was looking up at the collapse of the nine heavens, the fireball fell.</p><p>The poster said, “This is a scroll recently excavated from an ancient ruin. It records the scene of the fall of the Heavenly Court. Look at who he looks like.”</p><p>Soon, “The Fox of heavenly water”and the others replied, “He looks like the person from the hollow jade temple before he attained Dao!”</p><p>“Could it be that he is not a powerhouse who was born during the last tribulation, but a reincarnated ancient qi cultivator? No wonder he improved so quickly!”</p><p>“Yes, similar records and paintings have appeared in the ancient, Middle Ages, and even thousands of years ago!”</p><p>..</p><p>In the confused and shocked debate, the first poster said, “It’s not like that. Haven’t you heard that the bigwigs on the other shore can go back in time? The more powerful they are, the more they can appear in an even more ancient era!”</p><p>The debate came to an abrupt end. After a long silence, the “Heavenly Water Fox”said,</p><p>“I’ve heard about it all along, but it’s very difficult to communicate with the real world… if, if, if that person in the hollow jade temple was really powerful at the very beginning, would he be the real primordial beginning Celestial Master and there be no other primordial beginning Celestial Masters?”</p><p>“In theory…”the poster was also somewhat uncertain.</p><p>..</p><p>While they were discussing the various terrifying aspects of the other shore, he mu, who was quietly cultivating, was suddenly awakened by the great green root.</p><p>“The Hierarch Master wants you to go.”The Great Green Root was glowing and full of energy.</p><p>The Xiao Tian Quan didn’t dare to return to the hollow jade temple for the time being. It was living a comfortable life, and it had finally become the gatekeeper of the real hollow jade temple that it had always dreamed of.</p><p>This was its dream since it was young.</p><p>He Mu didn’t understand why, so he came to the clear jade temple and bowed to Meng Qi, who had put away all kinds of magical things but was shrouded in darkness. “Teacher wants to see you. What are your orders?”</p><p>Meng Qi pointed and a letter flew out:</p><p>“Send this thing to the monster Emperor Palace in the Monster Race’s Star Field.”</p><p>Monster Race’s star field… He Mu suddenly fell into a trance, feeling as if he did not know who he XI was.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
