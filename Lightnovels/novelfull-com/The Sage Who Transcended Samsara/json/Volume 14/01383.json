Not playing by common sense</p><p>The wind blew against the trees, and a leaf fell to reveal the autumn of the world. The tension that had permeated the air without the sense of ordinary people instantly disappeared, and all traces of fighting ceased to exist. It was just that the history of the existence of the line of the bodhisattva of Joy had shortened by a lot, furthermore, they had become mortal enemies with the orthodoxy of the Buddha of joy.</p><p>Regardless of their status or stance, the great divine arts practitioners of creation all sighed in their hearts. Every time at this time, they would experience a sea of bitterness.</p><p>The ignorant tan ping, Xia Xiu, and the others had already joined the Great Zhou Camp and were assigned to be the vanguard. They were currently forming a ring of formations and joining forces to attack Yanling Island, which was the gateway to three clouds island.</p><p>Lightning was like spears, and the waves were like peaks. The surrounding water surface rose rapidly, leveling the highest peak on the island. If it weren’t for the heavy flow of fire, burning deep blue, and steaming water vapor, this place would have long turned into a swamp country, turning into an underwater landscape.</p><p>Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!</p><p>The sound of a horn sounded, and the sound of metal was heard. The grand array that had gathered many overseas immortals and exterior experts returned without success, unable to do anything to the numerous forbidden spells of Yanling Island.</p><p>“This ‘Darkfire Hell Sea’truly lives up to its name. It can actually block so many immortals and deities.”Xia Xiu breathed in and out Yuan Qi, recovering her strength as she lamented the encounter just now.</p><p>Yanling Island’s ‘Darkfire Hell Sea’was known as one of the best in the Dharma body level grand array. She had never experienced it in the past, but now that she had finally experienced it, her reputation was inferior to meeting them.</p><p>Hearing this, her companions in the surroundings agreed with her.</p><p>Without the trouble of being involved in the conflict on the other side, Tan Ping was calm and composed, she chuckled and said, “How dare you call yourself the best among the dharma body level arrays that are thousands of miles away from the legendary level? When you encounter the ‘nine Zigzag Yellow River Array’in the future, won’t your eyeballs pop out?”</p><p>“The attack on Yanling Island this time is just to practice the array formation for newcomers like us to improve our tacit understanding and plan for the future. There is a huge difference between the human power of an organized array formation and a bunch of loose sand running their own government</p><p>“Don’t you see that our nominal chief general, Sun Wu, a disciple of the hollow jade temple, has shown his face and made a move so far?”</p><p>Another companion named Yan jingang nodded and said, “Brother Tan, I admire your words!”</p><p>He scratched the top of his head, he continued, “But I still don’t understand. His Majesty is the current human emperor. He holds the nirvana-level and is peerless. He can easily defeat the forces of three Cloud Island and break the nine twists Yellow River Formation. Why does he have to let us attack and go through so much trouble?”</p><p>The combination of the nine Zigzag Yellow River Formation and the chaos golden battle caused the expressions of those below the Nirvana stage to change. However, the human emperor sword had long been awakened. With the Nirvana stage, what was there to be afraid of?</p><p>Tan Ping’s lips moved. He wanted to say something but stopped, in the end, he smiled and said, “In the game of the Nirvana stage, the universe is used as a chessboard and the fate of the common people is used as a chess piece. One move can affect the whole body. Before the situation is clear, if His Majesty makes a move rashly, it may cause unexpected changes. The world is so big, and he is not the only one who has the Nirvana stage. It is also not only the person from the hollow jade temple who is an important figure. It is the way of the king to strike steadily and ask for the way.”</p><p>He did not go into too much detail because it was very difficult for his companions to understand the true meaning of the sea of bitterness. It was very difficult for them to experience the worry and fear of “If they do not reach the other shore, they will just be a bubble.”.</p><p>Not every great divine arts practitioner in the destiny realm was able to face death calmly. Those who could say “The only death that has been difficult for thousands of years”were like those who had a nightmare together. Some would forget it in the blink of an eye, while others would only recover after being depressed for a long time, not to mention that there were other factors that affected them as well. The inner demons, external demons, and heavenly demons had never been cut off since ancient times!</p><p>Xia Xiu and the others were confused when they heard that. They only roughly understood the main meaning. When the human emperor of the world had to be wary of the other divine weapons and other important figures on the other shore.., they needed to test the other party’s trump cards and the attitudes of the various forces bit by bit. If they were finally certain that they were at a disadvantage, there would be room for maneuver, and the losses would not be too great.</p><p>Just as they finished resting and were ready to perform the 756th transformation of the array, a volcano suddenly erupted from Yanling Island. Lava poured out like water, and the smoke and dust filled the air, it turned into ink-like filth that gave off an evil and depraved feeling.</p><p>“Not good!”Tan Ping’s expression changed slightly, “The Apocalypse has deepened, and that volcano directly connected to the Netherworld and spewed out demonic fire and evil mist. This way, the Darkfire Hell Sea will turn into a ‘black hell of Filth’. The slightest contamination will pierce through one’s body and contaminate one’s true spirit. It’s very dangerous.”</p><p>“Then what should we do?”Xia Xiu knew that Big Brother Tan was experienced and knowledgeable. He definitely wouldn’t scare others.</p><p>Tan Ping said, “The Dark Fire Hell Sea needs a certain amount of time to turn into a nefarious fire hell. At this time, it’s the most vulnerable. As long as we can find a treasure of extreme yang or extreme cold, we can try to break the array directly. At that time, we can seal the volcano and end this matter.”</p><p>He looked around and thought of a treasure in the water ancestor’s collection: “Ice Soul Ten Extreme Water.”.</p><p>Should he make a name for himself?</p><p>Suddenly, he felt a chill in his heart. He felt the powerful aura of a prehistoric beast. He looked to the east at the same time as Xia Xiu and the others. There stood a pale golden giant that was as tall as a mountain. The acupuncture points around it were opened, it reflected layers of dark and deep universe.</p><p>“‘Invincible Iron Fist’Sun Wu… Eight-nine arcane art…”tan ping squinted his eyes.</p><p>However, before he could say anything, he saw the pale golden giant take a step forward and crash into the Dark Fire Hell Sea. Flames rose up and wrapped around him.</p><p>The Flames burned and sizzled, and the pale golden light became brighter and brighter. Sun Wu laughed out loud and rushed to the side of the volcano despite all the Flames, filth, and divine abilities. He clenched his right fist and smashed it down.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The volcano collapsed and stopped spewing. The Devil’s will was buried by layers of giant rocks.</p><p>Watching this scene, Yan Jingang couldn’t help but mutter to himself, “This is the eight-nine arcane art. Both are peerless, but compared to it, the Starfire great art is too mediocre…”</p><p>“As expected of the disciple of Yuxu…”Xia Xiu also sighed with emotion. There was no ultimate yang or ultimate frost treasure, but just his body alone could do this!</p><p>Sun Wu withdrew from Yanling Island and began to give orders. He ordered his immortal gods and external scenery experts to form a formation, leaving behind layers of forbidden spells to seal the volcano that connected to the nine nether world.</p><p>At this moment, he saw the sea area in the direction of three clouds island rise up with waves of fog. The azure blue turned yellow and turbid, as if there was a lot of mud floating in the air. In an instant, it completely covered the boundless sea area.</p><p>“Nine twists of the Yellow River Formation…”Sun Wu frowned and muttered.</p><p>Why was he in the nine twists of the Yellow River Formation right from the start?</p><p>His side had just begun to attack the weak outer islands!</p><p>To use his teacher’s occasional joke, this scenario was not right!</p><p>Could it be that consort three clouds had received some sort of guarantee, so she had nothing to fear?</p><p>Would the great Zhou side respond in the same way, or retreat temporarily? If they chose the former, the conflict would quickly escalate, and the degree of conflict would continue to rise. In the end, it was likely that the big shots would have to personally take part, and at this moment.., the attitudes of many important figures were very vague. It was impossible to predict who would have the upper hand and who would be at a disadvantage!</p><p>All of a sudden, a ray of light lit up high in the sky, dyeing the clouds red and forming a sea of fire. A seemingly pure and charming voice descended:</p><p>“Qing Qiu has come to assist the human emperor under the decree of the demon Empress!”</p><p>Qing Qiu? Tan Ping’s gaze suddenly contracted. Before he reincarnated, this was the successor of the demon saint, deeply favored by the demon emperor. He was practically the representative of that important figure on the other shore, his arrival brought the “Calm”situation to the edge of the cliff.</p><p>What did the demon Emperor Want to do?</p><p>In the Netherworld, the demon Buddha narrowed his eyes and thought to himself,</p><p>“The demon emperor is very determined… does he really not care about the feelings of the demon Grand Sages?”</p><p>“Or does he want to intensify the conflict as soon as possible, before Amitabha and mother Wusheng do something to reduce the Void?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
