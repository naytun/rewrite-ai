Scheming was too clever</p><p>“What’s the matter?”The ancient Buddha with the burning lamp sat on the lotus throne. His golden body was magnificent. He saw the abnormality of Ah Nan’s shadow and asked.</p><p>Ah Nan retracted his gaze and smiled again. He said calmly, “It’s a small matter. My brand in the absolute saber has been worn away.”</p><p>“Doesn’t the absolute saber have lost all checks and balances and can be used to its full potential?”The ancient Buddha with the burning lamp’s solemn voice fluctuated as if he was saying something.</p><p>How was this a small matter?</p><p>If absolute blade overlord could completely break free of its restrictions, it would become something on the other shore level. He would no longer have the possibility of succeeding in his plan and could only wait for the will of heaven. Moreover, the will of heaven might not even be effective!</p><p>What was even more terrifying was that at that time, Su Meng could completely strike first and gain the upper hand. In the situation where the other shore people had not returned, he would most likely die!</p><p>Ah Nan chuckled. “It doesn’t matter. It’s just a matter of driving the tiger to swallow the wolf. Although the Wolf is dead, the tiger is still there. The absolute blade will be able to remove all the shackles in a short period of time.”</p><p>“Driving the tiger to swallow the wolf…”the ancient Buddha with the burning lamp thought of the two words “Tai Yi”that Ah Nan’s shadow had whispered earlier. Combined with his deductions, he had already understood the general reason behind it, “Su Meng took a risk and used the remnants of Donghuang to enter the absolute blade and drive the tiger to swallow the wolf, wearing away your brand. However, the marks of Donghuang are not so easy to erase?”</p><p>“Of course,”Ananda replied with a smile, “What I have is only the mark of the brand. Donghuang’s remnants still have flesh and blood as carriers. Even if they were severely injured from driving the tiger to swallow the wolf, it is not so easy to wipe them away. It is still uncertain whether the absolute blade will be able to perform to its previous level.”</p><p>“Amitabha Nanwu. Su Meng has gained many benefits from taking risks. This time, it is not worth the loss. No wonder you and Buddha said that the one who received the great fortune has a great calamity. The world is balanced and yin and Yang are born together. As expected, luck has turned and he has fallen to the bottom of the valley…”the ancient Buddha with the burning lamp chanted the name of Buddha in a low voice, his tone became a little more relaxed.</p><p>“It is the time to take advantage of his illness to take his life.”Ananda’s Phantom Face was merciful, and his tone was cold. “But he has many blessings. The most important thing is to find a way to help me escape.”</p><p>If the Devil Buddha appeared, in the current world, even the Green Emperor had to avoid its sharp edge. He could barely resist it, and Meng Qi’s life and death were only in his thoughts!</p><p>And when it came to his own perfection and the embryonic form of the dao fruit, how could he let Meng Qi live! !</p><p>The ancient Buddha’s face was pale gold, and under the light of the Glass Cup, it was holy and detached. He looked at the Phantom of Ananda with compassion, he said honestly, “Fellow Daoist, you have the intention to destroy the Buddha and destroy the Dao. You have the intention to sink all living beings. I can not stop you. As the old saying goes, I will not dare to help you get out of your predicament before you bring Buddha back.”</p><p>Ananda’s shadow was not angry, he chuckled and said, “I destroyed the Zen Forest sect and killed the Buddha and bodhisattva. I am afraid that fellow Daoist knows very well what I am trying to prevent. That Supreme True Buddha is a great threat to both of us. If not, it is not enough to cut off his path.”</p><p>“Amitabha Nanwu, why don’t you think of a way to completely eliminate him? When we bring the Buddha and Bodhisattva back, I believe that he will no longer be able to stir up trouble. He will be like the monster of the Heavenly Dao in the immemorial era.”The ancient Buddha with a lantern formed a seal with one hand, with the other hand, he held the glass lamp.</p><p>Ananda smiled and shook his head. “If he was really so easy to get rid of, how could I have been merciful when he was sealed in Mount Numinous? The matter of the Dao fruit is hard to predict, so we can only prevent it from happening.”</p><p>“But why did you fall into the path of the Devil for this?”The ancient Buddha said rather regretfully.</p><p>Ananda immediately laughed out loud. “If we talk about the ‘devil’, was I the ‘devil’who abandoned Mount Numinous, reversed the great array, and let all the Buddhas fall together? “Later on, when I traveled the world ascetically, when the world was reincarnated, when I broke through the mortal world and passed through the world with compassion, was I a ‘demon’?”</p><p>At this point, he put on a serious expression and said solemnly,</p><p>“There is good and evil, and there is the future. Without good and evil, one can see the fruit of the path.”</p><p>His voice was like the most terrifying whisper of a heavenly demon. It entered the ears of the ancient Buddha Burning Lamp, stirring up some of the restless thoughts in his heart.</p><p>..</p><p>In the depths of the Great Snow Mountain, at the core of the suppression of the nine venerated immortal tombs.</p><p>Wang Siyuan’s hair fluttered in the wind. Each strand was distinct, like black snakes that were constantly growing, almost completely filling up the space.</p><p>His eyes were dark red and chaotic madness. The veins on his face were constantly protruding, as if he had his own life. It made that beautiful woman’s face more ferocious, more strange, and more shocking!</p><p>His hands, neck, and every part covered by his clothes were expanding and contracting violently, as if there were countless monsters hiding in his body.</p><p>The brutal, violent, crazy, and chaotic terrifying aura kept spreading out, and even sheqin, who had barely recovered from the shock, could not help but hug his head and wail in pain. The spiritual light of his nature seemed to be about to disappear, and he was about to become a walking corpse.</p><p>As for Wang Siyuan, the sounds of the nine tokens shattering rang out incessantly. In a short period of time, only thirty percent remained. The light from the Luo book that enveloped his entire body dimmed, and the black and white dots that were calculating the laws of everything in the world disappeared one by one.</p><p>If not for the waves of invisible water blocking Wang Siyuan’s body, he would have already become a puppet left behind by the supreme one of the Eastern Emperor. He would not even be able to compare to sheqin from before.</p><p>At this critical moment, there seemed to be a soundless explosion of thunder. The Dark Red Chaos in Wang Siyuan’s eyes immediately weakened, and his long black hair was cut off, the bulging veins in his blood vessels became gentler… everything was strangely suppressed, or it could be said that the madness from before had lost its support.</p><p>Seizing the opportunity, the Luo book enveloped Wang Siyuan completely, and waves of water rippled out of his body, counteracting the tyrannical will.</p><p>The surroundings suddenly turned dark. Countless symbols rose up and connected, as if they had formed an essential tactic that described the laws and principles of Heaven and earth. They formed a complicated and illusory ball.</p><p>The ball suddenly shrank and drilled into Wang Siyuan’s body. A strange phenomenon appeared, but it was suppressed by the ancient tomb and could not be revealed to the outside world.</p><p>After a long time, Luo Shu entered Wang Siyuan’s Niwan Palace with a dim light. His sense of existence became weaker and weaker, as if he was composed of pure numbers, pure formulas, and pure calculations.</p><p>His face was paler than ever, as if he could die at any moment, vanish into thin air, and turn into ashes. At this moment, he looked out of the ancient tomb with some confusion, and coughed softly, “Cough, what happened? Cough, what happened?”</p><p>Although this trip was risky and crazy, it was not without some confidence. After confirming that idea, he had planned for a long time and made ample preparations, at the beginning, the transfer and absorption of the remnants of Donghuang from Schein’s body had been very successful. He had been on the verge of completing his transformation, but who would have thought that the remnants of Donghuang would suddenly go crazy, as if they had been stimulated by the outside world, they had destroyed many of his backup plans in one move, turning all hope of success into despair.</p><p>When he was about to become Donghuang’s clone, the Tai Yi Puppet, this madness suddenly stopped. It was even worse than before, and he had seized the chance to live, and he had achieved perfection.</p><p>“Did something go wrong with the piece of Donghuang’s flesh that the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure cut off? Was it first freed and then suppressed?”Wang Siyuan deduced the truth of the matter.</p><p>That piece of flesh had been cut off from sheqin, and the two must be closely related!</p><p>When he understood this, Wang Siyuan suddenly laughed. He was extremely deranged, and he looked like a madman:</p><p>“He was too clever in his calculations, and he almost lost his own life!”</p><p>“It’s hard to go against Heaven’s will!”</p><p>..</p><p>Meng Qi didn’t notice Wang Siyuan’s situation. He didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.</p><p>He had spent a lot of effort to resolve the danger, but in the end, he had only changed the Devil Buddha brand into Donghuang’s flesh and blood. The power of the absolute blade was still the same.</p><p>As expected, trials and tribulations were not easy to resolve… Meng Qi sighed and waved his sleeve, keeping the Golden Ao Island into his inner universe. Then, he returned to the hollow jade temple on Mount Kunlun.</p><p>Then, he used his spiritual sense to sink into the absolute saber and connect to the demonic blood peach. He wanted to see if he could use this to cause a change in the latter and obtain other, more hidden benefits.</p><p>Of course, Meng Qi’s tree of Great Dao was ready to be used to prevent the demonic blood peach from going out of control after a change.</p><p>His eyes were half open and half closed. He carefully drew out a trace of the remaining aura of Donghuang’s flesh and blood and established a new karmic connection. Then, he crossed over to where the demonic blood peach was located, which was behind Gu Xiaosang.</p><p>As soon as he touched it, the blood vessels and meridians hidden under the skin of the little peach suddenly bulged, and a desolate, barbaric, and unchanging sense of terror slowly spread out.</p><p>The little peach seemed to be drunk and abnormally excited. Under his skin and blood vessels, there was a faint shimmering light, like a condensed nebula, a coiled long river, and countless dao patterns floating in it, forming the main body, from the outside, it formed many ancient techniques, ranging from profound to shallow. They were the life-prolonging scripture, the key to immortality, the nine songs of time, and so on.</p><p>Meng Qi was not surprised by these. He was happy that little peach seemed to be the part of the Illusory Dao fruit that Dong Huang Taiyi had condensed that involved longevity and time. Even if this part was still incomplete, it was still no small matter!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
