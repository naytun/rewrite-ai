An endless sense of power gushed out and forcibly uprooted the heavy and vast former heavenly venerate Daoist rite temple, he looked like the Pangu giant who had split the heaven and earth in some mythological stories.</p><p>The forbidden techniques were glittering and overlapping like anchors that were connected to the heaven and earth and rooted in the mist. However, they were pulled and deformed in front of the overwhelming force and were broken apart one after another, rays of light turned into ‘drizzle’, but the backlash that resulted could not shake the pale gold and left scars.</p><p>Yuan Hong turned his white hair into a clone. The various guardian Cardinals’responses could be considered good. It was the evolution of a formation formed by one person, combined with the layout of the Golden Turtle Island itself. It was as if it was impregnable. However, a clone was still a clone, without an independent consciousness, an independent spirit, and an independent mind, if they encountered a person who pointed directly at their own heart, they would not be able to match up to the other ‘egotists’. They immediately lost their leader and were at a loss. They instantly understood their ‘identity’, they returned to their original forms and turned into white hairs.</p><p>Once they lost the control of Yuan Hong’s countless clones, the forbidden techniques on golden ao island would be unable to hide their original problems and loopholes. Meng Qi’s “Celestial Master Su Meng”clone seized the opportunity and sent down the immortal slaying four Qi, the sword formed a formation and messed up the arrangement. Although it could not directly break through, it made it difficult for it to connect the front and the back. It mobilized all its strength to resist the light gold deity’s simple and crude uprooting.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>On the Golden Ao Island, the desolate mountain peak that had been re-formed shook violently. The earth cracked and the Golden Crow fell. It was a scene of Doomsday. The forbidden spells around the island became thinner and thinner. It was about to be completely torn apart, it was taken away by ‘Lord Qingyuan’.</p><p>Yuan Hong, who was in the time turbulence crevice, exploded with all of his power. He seemed to be on the verge of a crazy counterattack. He wanted to beat back Su Meng’s original body and return to the Golden Ao Island. However, the supreme boundless primordial Qi above Meng Qi’s head shook slightly, rays of dark light drooped down, creating near-real chaos. It was even more magical and solid than the physical defense of the eight-nine arcane art. Yuan Hong’s storm-like attacks and the various Abhijnas of the seventy-two transformations, once they came into contact.., they sank like stones into the ocean and disappeared without a trace. One could only see wave after wave of ripples. The more he fought, the more frightened he became. He felt that the Wuji Seal was indeed the ultimate combination of attack and defense!</p><p>At the same time, what made Yuan Hong even more horrified was that there were several times when he disregarded everything and relied on his innate talent and martial arts to combine his body’s nearly indestructible strength to attack one place consecutively. He wanted to destroy it with a point and break through Qing Yun Chui Guang’s defense, seeing that he had made some achievements, there were inexplicable incidents of “Himself”attacking “Himself”. It was as if the person standing in front of him was another version of himself, or attacking him was equivalent to attacking his own body. Injuries continued to appear, it was strange and inexplicable, and he had to avoid this matter, so as to prevent his eternal cultivation from going to waste.</p><p>Seeing that Yuan Hong could not return to Jin ao island in a short while, the power that Lu Ya had quietly lowered knew that things could not be done. After all, to move Jin Ao Island into true chaos through space, not only would he have to pay a huge price.., and it would not be completed in a few breaths. Therefore, he thought a little and made a decision immediately:</p><p>If he gave up on moving Jin ao island, Su Meng would not be able to get what he could not get. He could even use this opportunity to bury him forever!</p><p>A scarlet-golden light flashed and rose from the pseudo Green Touring Palace on Jin Ao Island. It swept across the desolate sky that was constantly “Collapsing”and went straight into the depths of the debris.</p><p>The power that was descending from the land pressure wanted to pull out the Qingping Sword and release the remaining flesh and blood of East Emperor Taiyi to remove all the restrictions on him!</p><p>At that time, Su Meng would be facing a furious and mysterious archaic emperor. A true archaic emperor, although it would be impossible to recover to his peak level just by relying on these remnants, would definitely be as terrifying as the other side or even the real other side, it was enough to make Su Meng Vanish into thin air in an instant and turn into the East Emperor’s puppet, the Tai Yi clone.</p><p>The Tai was the greatest and most supreme, the most ancient and first; one, mixed with one without being divided, and the Dao gave birth to one, one gave birth to two, two gave birth to three, and three gave birth to one of all living things. Therefore, the Tai Yi, another name for the “Dao,”was the name of the East Emperor, it was enough to show how proud he was of himself. He would never allow people like Su Meng, who had designs on him, to do so!</p><p>The crimson-golden light passed through the layers of collapsed primal fragments and came to the deepest part. It saw the ancient longsword that was inserted into the pitch-black void, and the ball of dark and mysterious flesh that was suppressed by the tip of the Longsword. It was wriggling crazily, it displayed a brutal and ruthless feeling.</p><p>With a flash of light, it was about to land on the hilt of the sword. It was about to use the forbidden spell that it had spied on this place for so many years and constantly studied, pulling out the Qingping immediately.</p><p>But suddenly, the glazed glass protruded out. The Buddha had descended. After Zhen Ding Tathagata had transcended Yuan Hong’s white-furred clone, he had been accumulating power and was ready to go, he had not joined Celestial Master Su Meng and Daoist Lord Qing Yuan to break the forbidden spell on Jinao Island and moved away from this heavy place in order to guard against Lu Ya and Yuan Hongyu’s desperate attempts to break the net!</p><p>Moreover, Meng Qi’s “Karma”had always been connected to Jiuhua Mountain and other places. If Lu Ya really dared to come in person, he could only inform his senior brothers and sisters and summon them if he had no other choice, they would fight together.</p><p>The Buddha’s golden body was magnificent, and his face was full of mercy. There was a round light behind him. He stretched out his right hand and placed his palm on top of it. He spread it down slightly and made a gesture of giving.</p><p>Endless Buddhist light gushed out, like the rain that fell from the Willows. It purified everything around it and turned everything into the possession of the Buddha Kingdom.</p><p>The power of the land pressure seemed to have been inspired, and it understood the past. Under the shower of the glazed golden rain, the pure gold faded away, and the desire to kill faded away. He became a Buddha on the spot and died in Nirvana.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Golden Ao Island was completely shaken. Meng Qi’s 89 incarnations had broken all the forbidden spells and pulled out the hiding place. Countless lights rose up and then faded away.</p><p>Yuan Hong saw that things could not be done. He immediately relied on his near-indestructible physical body to withstand Meng Qi’s Wuji seal at the cost of half of his body collapsing. He escaped into the fog, jumped into the other cracks of the time turbulence, and fled in a panic.</p><p>The terrain and environment were dangerous, and the focus was on Jin Ao Island. Meng Qi couldn’t catch up with him in time, so he gave up. His eyes moved to the huge island surrounded by light, looking at the ancient longsword and the black flesh.</p><p>Next, he put Jin ao island away with the universe in his sleeve and moved it out of the Fusang Ancient Tree realm. If there was any mistake, Emperor Qing wouldn’t just let it die, right? Meng Qi had planned this from the very beginning.</p><p>At this moment, a green light flashed and Sword Qi rose into the air. Meng Qi saw the Qingping sword fly up and transform into a stream of light. It was thrown into the chaotic flow of time, and no one was there to pull it up and control it!</p><p>Without a doubt, the ball of black and strange flesh was left behind, and it had lost all its suppression and seal!</p><p>A violent and brutal aura of terror swept out and swept across the entire Golden Ao Island.</p><p>Was this the will of the Heavenly Lord of Numinous Treasure?</p><p>Was this his Providence?</p><p>These two thoughts first appeared in Meng Qi’s mind.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
