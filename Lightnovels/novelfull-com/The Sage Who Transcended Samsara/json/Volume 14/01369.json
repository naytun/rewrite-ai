If one was not careful, one would get lost. Under the guidance of the monster race on duty, the nine heavens mystical maiden, Liu Luo, slowly walked deeper into the palace.</p><p>Seeing that they were about to approach the inner palace, Liu Luo suddenly saw a man and a woman walking out together and brushing past him. The woman’s face was shy, and her beauty was soul-stirring. She looked around and revealed a joy that was difficult to hide, obviously, she had the bloodline of the Phoenix clan. The man was dressed in a green robe and his expression was not as reserved as the woman’s. He smiled like a fool.</p><p>Eh, isn’t this the disciple of the hollow jade temple? Liuluo remained calm and maintained an elegant and refined posture as he stepped into the inner hall. He saw layers of curtains and a beautiful figure faintly discernible behind them.</p><p>“Liuluo pays his respects to the Empress.”During the ancient times, she had visited the Monster Emperor Hall many times, so her tone had a sense of familiarity. “The person just now seemed to be the disciple of Celestial Master Su of the Hollow Jade Temple?”</p><p>The monster emperor smiled calmly. “Sect master su proposed marriage to the monster race on his behalf, showing that he treats humans and the monster race equally.”</p><p>Just for such a trivial matter, he had sent a disciple to meet the Monster Emperor so formally? Liu Luo didn’t believe it for a moment. How could celestial master bi an be so boring?</p><p>However, as an ancient man, the monster Emperor would never lie to him. Of course, some things could be misled if he only said half of them… perhaps there were other conspiracies besides the marriage proposal?</p><p>As the thoughts flashed through his mind, Liuluo did not pursue the matter and said respectfully, “The Celestial Emperor asked me to pass a message to the Empress.”</p><p>“What message?”The tone of the Monster Emperor did not change at all.</p><p>“The Empress and the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure, in the past, tried to establish Yinshang and unify the three realms by supporting Chengtang. She can give you anything that she obtained.”The eyes of the mysterious lady of nine heavens were quiet, like the clearest and deepest lake water.</p><p>In the inner hall, the curtains swayed slightly as if a gentle breeze was blowing by. The Monster Emperor fell silent for a moment before saying,</p><p>“I understand. You may leave.”</p><p>Liu Luo retracted his expression and bowed once more before turning around to leave.</p><p>..</p><p>In the nine Netherworlds, the demon lord and Yang Jian sat opposite each other in the depths of the Netherworld Sea ruins. At the entrance of the seven kills Daoist, Ghost Emperor Xuanming stood at the top of Luofeng Mountain on the sixth level, looking down at the layers of yin soil. Heavenly Lord of the nine chaos and Black Heaven Emperor were each in their respective training grounds, the few false shores maintained a relatively peaceful situation.</p><p>At that moment, the black fog in the various levels of the Netherworld seethed and seethed. The Dark Light in the sky intensified, and the river water of the Yellow Springs surged. Poisonous flames and foul gases spewed out from every crack, as if they were praising, welcoming, and surrounding something.</p><p>A figure walked in from outside the netherworld. He wore a black monk robe that revealed half of his shoulder. He had a handsome face and a smile on the corner of his mouth, as if he had everything under his control.</p><p>“Devil Buddha!”Daoist seven kills focused his gaze. Immediately, his fierce light intensified, but he could not hide his fear.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Netherworld Sea sword trembled on the spot, sending out circles of substantial death intent. It shattered the void and time, condensing into a point of killing intent that locked onto the person in the black monk robe.</p><p>The Devil Buddha, Ah Nan, had actually descended into the Netherworld without any disguise. He was not hiding behind the scenes, plotting and scheming. He had only acted at the critical moment to secure victory and break away from the obstruction to refine the netherworld!</p><p>What was he trying to do?</p><p>On the peak of Luofeng Mountain, in the Devil Pool, in the Netherworld Sea Ruins, in the scarlet mountain range, Xuan Ming Ghost Emperor, Unparalleled Demon Lord, nine Chaos Celestial Master, Black Heaven Emperor, as well as Yang Jian and Qi Zhengyan all looked over, they looked at the number one evil demon in the world.</p><p>He was not like the other shores where he would be constantly affected by the depravity and filth after entering the nine Netherworlds. Instead, he was like a fish in water. It was as if he had returned to his hometown and was “Welcomed”by the will of the nine Netherworlds.</p><p>Even if this did not improve him in any way, it still made the few evil demons and evil gods who relied on the netherworld to reach the pseudo-other shore realm deeply wary of him.</p><p>Ghost Emperor Xuanming’s cold eyes turned to nine Chaos Celestial Master, Daoist Seven Kills, and the others. It was as if he was inviting them to join forces and banish the demon Buddha from the netherworld.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The Netherworld Sea Sword let out a long hum in response to Ghost Emperor Xuanming’s suggestion. However, the demon lord, Black Heaven Emperor, and nine Chaos Celestial Master were unmoved. The first two had their own thoughts, while the latter was affected by the will of the netherworld, the frenzied desire to destroy was temporarily suppressed.</p><p>Yang Jian watched thoughtfully, but he did not move either.</p><p>Seeing this, Ghost Emperor Xuanming roared angrily and froze layers of yin earth. However, he did not attack the fiend Buddha in the end.</p><p>Even with the Netherworld Sea Sword, Daoist seven kills would be at a clear disadvantage against the fiend Buddha. It was only with him that he would have the advantage. However, the fiend Buddha still had the Samsara seal and the Heavenly Dao monster. With just the two false shores joining forces.., they would not be able to move him at all. They might even be seized by the opportunity to be destroyed!</p><p>The Devil Buddha, Ah Nan, enjoyed the gazes of hatred, fear, and wariness. His figure suddenly flashed and appeared in the sky above the Black Heaven Monarch’s training hall. A terrifying and demonic devil body appeared, it was like the condensation of all the depravity, all the filth, and all the destruction and slaughter in the world.</p><p>Seeing that he had found trouble with the Black Heaven Monarch, Daoist seven kills, Ghost Emperor Xuanming, and the others all secretly heaved a sigh of relief. At the same time, they were looking forward to it. When the two sides started fighting, they could seize the opportunity to join the battle and expel the Devil Buddha!</p><p>More importantly, if the Devil Buddha showed too strong and aggressive behavior, the remaining false nirvana would also participate in the battle with the mentality of a fox mourning the death of a rabbit, and it would be foolproof.</p><p>“What do you mean, fellow Daoist?”The black heavenly emperor’s ethereal voice came from inside the training hall.</p><p>The Devil Buddha sat in the Lotus position. Each of his arms held a treasure or formed a seal. He did not answer. He opened his mouth and began to recite the scriptures.</p><p>Just like that, he blocked the “Door”of the black heavenly emperor and began to recite the scriptures!</p><p>The scriptures were evil, as if they were written by gathering all the desires and negative emotions in the world. They turned into a buzzing sound and gave the evil Devil God a splitting headache. It was chaotic and crazy, and they started to kill each other.</p><p>All the drops of their blood flowed in reverse and finally converged into a red and black reverse ten thousand characters outside the Black Heavenly Emperor’s Daoist Hall!</p><p>After reading the scripture once, the Devil Buddha got up and left. He did not fight or speak, which made Ghost Emperor Xuanming and Daoist seven kills confused and confused.</p><p>What did he want to do?</p><p>It was simply baffling!</p><p>The Devil Buddha walked step by step and arrived at the pitch-black peak where Meng Qi used to sit cross-legged. He sat in the lotus position and closed his eyes as if he was sleeping.</p><p>Inside the training hall, the Black Heaven Emperor’s eyes flickered slightly. No one knew what he was thinking about.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Devil Buddha returned to its position, and the Netherworld flourished again. At the extreme south of the eastern sea, the endless blue waves suddenly collapsed, as if they had flowed into a place that could not be filled. A hole appeared out of thin air that made even the immortals’scalps go numb.</p><p>The hole cracked open, and the bottom of the sea collapsed layer by layer. The Black Fog and Devil Qi surged out and polluted the surroundings, turning the void time and all living creatures into the netherworld. and in the distance that had not been polluted, the creatures at the bottom of the sea lost their vitality one by one, soon, they were all turned into ashes.</p><p>It was as if the end of the world had arrived.</p><p>At this moment, a golden bridge that connected the sea of bitterness and the other shore suddenly extended from the high sky and stood at the place where the bottom of the sea collapsed, suppressing all changes.</p><p>At the same time, a ruyi that was surrounded by golden flowers, purple clouds, and water waves also descended from the sky and pressed down to the bottom of the sea, eliminating the filth and depravity, separating the nine serenities and the real world.</p><p>Upon seeing this scene, the closed-eyed demon Buddha was neither shocked nor angry. The corners of his mouth curled up slightly, as if he was smiling.</p><p>The end of the epoch was coming. This was the general trend, and this was going with the flow!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
