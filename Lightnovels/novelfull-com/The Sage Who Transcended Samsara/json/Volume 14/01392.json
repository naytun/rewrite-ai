The waters run deep</p><p>Meng Qi sat upright in the jade clear palace. His eyes reflected the arrival of ten thousand immortals, the green touring palace that had no discrimination. There were many figures there, and the atmosphere was noisy. The only thing missing was the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure. There were only some traces left, and the sound of the Great Dao reverberated endlessly.</p><p>When he first met the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure, his brand would not disappear and would not be replaced. This meant that he was not the product of the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure. At least, it was not directly related to him. On the contrary.., once he met the brand left behind by the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning, there would immediately be a dream bubble and a natural replacement. It perfectly matched his inheritance of the title of the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning and became the cause of all the fruits in the world. It was the situation where the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning was the product of the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure.</p><p>However, when he replaced the brand left behind by the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning, the brand left behind by the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure in the same period of history disappeared. Combined with the previous deductions, it was possible that it was obvious!</p><p>Since he was not directly the product of the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure’s minimization, the disappearance of his brand was obviously because of the original Lord of Heaven. There was a certain degree of strange connection between the two!</p><p>Of course, it did not mean that the original lord of Heaven had fused with or assimilated the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure. As long as he fused with the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure, the essence would be the same, and he would be the only one. If he saw the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure first, he would also cause the other’s brand to disappear and replace him.</p><p>At this time, the relevant things that Meng Qi knew in the past flowed through his mind one by one:</p><p>In the Battle of the fall of the Heavenly Court, the primordial Lord of Heaven, facing Jian Mu, let out an exclamation that “The matter of the Dao fruit is not an external object”</p><p>After the whereabouts of the primordial Lord of Heaven and the Heavenly Lord of Numinous Treasure became a mystery, they still fought in Qingwei Heaven. If this was not a trace forged by the gold emperor, then it meant that they were still fighting over something</p><p>The heavenly venerate of primordial beginning, the heavenly venerate of Lingbao, and the heavenly venerate of morality were all born on the other side. They were born at the same time, with the first three pure ones and then the heaven</p><p>They each represented the foundation of existence and the foundation of existence. Together, they covered everything. There was nothing left, no increase or decrease</p><p>The heavenly venerate of primordial beginning took the time to ascend to godhood to cover the whereabouts of the heavenly venerate of Lingbao. The heavenly venerate of morality cut off his journey to the west to hide the traces of the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning..</p><p>Did this mean that the “Dao”had transformed into the three pure ones, and each of them was a side of the “Dao”, mutually confirming each other to become the dao fruit and the complete “Dao”? Therefore, if they wanted to transcend.., even if they had tried their best to acquire the “Dao”symbolized by the other party and obtained the complete and flawless embryonic form of the dao fruit, because of the influence of each other, it would be difficult for them to take the final step. The three pure ones were one, and they had to form the dao together?</p><p>After realizing this point, the heavenly venerate of the origin was able to say that there were no external things. That was why he had a secret fight with the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure to fight for the leadership of the follow-up. He also resolved the past karma such as the Battle of Ascension. After all, before he saw the fruit of the tree of life.., the three Pure Ones sought their own dao. When they fought for the Great Dao, they were friends and enemies. There were many grudges between them, which led to the appearance of the other shore.</p><p>According to this speculation, the appearance of green touring palace on Mount Kunlun and other things could be perfectly explained.</p><p>Similarly, the cover-up of the whereabouts of the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning and the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure was actually to cover up their current state, so as to prevent the other shores from targeting them in advance and working together to destroy them.</p><p>By the time he broke free from the sea of bitterness and reached the other shore, the Wood had already become a boat, and the other shores could only find other ways to stop him!</p><p>“No wonder the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure changed his state and existed in a strange way between heaven and earth…”Meng Qi looked at the green touring palace and Sighed in his heart.</p><p>At this time, in the Western Paradise, in the Pure Land of Bodhi wisdom, in the monster Emperor Palace, in the newborn ninth underworld, in the hometown of vacuum.., in the reappearance of the immortal realm and the realm of the Fusang ancient tree, many deep gazes were cast toward the “Empty”green touring palace.</p><p>At this stage, they could naturally get a rough idea of the situation!</p><p>Through the green touring palace and the dense immortal qi, Meng Qi looked at the bright moon that was shining brightly. His gaze met the lofty and indifferent gaze of the gold emperor. There were no ripples, and it was as calm as ice.</p><p>The Gold Emperor should have known long ago that his recent successive failures and continuous weakening were all following his script. He must have a corresponding backup plan..</p><p>This realization accurately flashed in Meng Qi’s mind, and he had a deeper understanding of the past struggles.</p><p>If the gold emperor did not inspire him to slash out a blade from the path of extinction, then he, who cultivated the infinite seal and the heaven opening seal, could form the embryonic form of the dao fruit in the shortest time possible, step into the ranks of the ancient people, and perform the great divine ability of one Qi into three pure ones to perfection, there was no need to assimilate the medicine master, Buddha King, and the golden body of the Saint Buddha into the weak state of the other shore, which allowed the primordial Lord of Heaven, the heavenly lord of Lingbao, and the heavenly lord of morality to transcend as one, so that there was no hope for the Dao fruit in his current era.</p><p>That Blade was the one he had been waiting for since he had laid out little sang!</p><p>Meng Qi looked away and turned to look at Dou Shuai Palace, which was beyond the 33 heavens. It was as if he could see the old man in a Daoist robe who was meditating with his eyes closed.</p><p>“The heavenly lord of morality is the foundation of existence. He can not escape from the world like the primordial Lord of Heaven and the heavenly lord of Lingbao. He exists in a strange state. He must wait until the end of the era when heaven and earth do not exist before he can leave freely and transcend together with them. Therefore, before that, he needs to perfect his plan and make me an ancient…”</p><p>“At this point, this plan can’t be kept secret anymore. What else do the three celestial venerables have up their sleeves?”</p><p>It could be imagined that Amitabha, ancient Bodhi Buddha, mother Wusheng, Celestial Emperor, Devil Buddha, and even the demon Emperor would crazily block his next step of advancement.</p><p>Fortunately, that Slash had cut off his path of cultivation, and his advancement was slow. It was difficult to advance unless it was a great opportunity. Otherwise, he would have become the target of everyone at this moment!</p><p>Did the gold emperor have a similar plan or a backup plan? When he was about to cut off the third weak incarnation of the other shore and become the embryonic form of the dao fruit, he suddenly revealed the three pure ones and gathered the power of the other shore, just like how he killed the Celestial Emperor back then, little sang would be helpless even if she reached the other shore. She would also be restricted by the other ancient masters, and it would be difficult for her to threaten him at all?</p><p>It was really a chain-link and a flawless plan..</p><p>It was not too bad to expose this matter in advance..</p><p>All kinds of situations were clearly reflected in Meng Qi’s heart. He was even more eager to know what the Golden Emperor’s backup plan was with the help of the secret of the three pure ones. From these aspects, he was a more terrifying enemy than the Devil Buddha.</p><p>If he wanted to pry into this, he had to figure out the secret of the three pure ones. He had to reunite the ascension of the gods and the journey to the west into the real world!</p><p>To do this, only the oldest person who could go back in time to the time before the creation of heaven and Earth could do it. In today’s world, only the moral celestial master and Amitabha could do it!</p><p>Only they had the ability to open the source of time at the moment of the creation of heaven and earth!</p><p>And in this matter, the other shore could not even provide help because they could not go back to the time before the creation of Heaven and earth. In other words, they could block the moral celestial master after the creation of Heaven and earth together, but they could not affect the other party before the creation of Heaven and earth.</p><p>The realm advantage between the other shores was reflected in such a place!</p><p>In normal battles, the realm of the other shores could not be reflected too clearly. This was because going back in time to erase the gap between the end and restart of the past era was not very effective against the same other shores, unless they were willing to die together and no longer create heaven and earth, and also because they had too many means to make up for their battle strength. Just like Meng Qi himself, although he was not in the embryonic form of the dao fruit, but with the two incarnations of the weak other shores.., it wasn’t a problem for him to suppress the Golden Emperor, who was an ancient elder and had lost the celestial eradication sword formation. However, in such a situation, a slight difference in realm was just a tiny bit. No matter how he jumped, it would be difficult to leap over and reach him.</p><p>“Amitabha would definitely want to integrate the god Ascension and the journey to the west and find out all the secrets. But would martial Uncle Dao de be willing?”Meng Qi could only shake his head and smile. His figure flashed and he arrived outside the door of Dou Shuai Palace.</p><p>It was better to ask directly about some things!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
