Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang arrived outside the old neighborhood where they lived. The illusory river of time around them was prominent and flowing quietly.</p><p>He held Gu Xiaosang’s hand and went against the flow of time. He separated the time and returned to the past. It was not long after he had “Transmigrated”to the real world. The neighbors around him had lost their white spots and wrinkles, they had returned to their prime years.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang first closed her eyes to experience the changes of time, feeling the uniqueness of the past and history. Then she opened her eyes and looked around with her deep and beautiful eyes that seemed to be full of bright stars.</p><p>“The dressing here is different,”she said with a smile. The dress on her body changed into a loose and elegant white dress. The patterns were simple and refreshing.</p><p>However, she was not satisfied. She wrinkled her nose, pursed her lips, and pointed at her waist. “This place is too loose. It looks like I’ve been pregnant for a few months…”</p><p>As she spoke, she pulled out a light-colored leather belt from somewhere and tied it around her waist. It was a decoration and also tied around her waist, adding a bit of liveliness to it. In addition, her hair was loose, the straight and long jet-black hair cascaded down like a waterfall, covering half of her face and crystal-clear ears, revealing a faintly discernible beauty.</p><p>Seeing that Xiao sang had mastered the aesthetics of this era on earth in only a few seconds, Meng Qi was deeply ashamed, because he was wearing a standard plaid shirt, jeans, and white shoes, which had been the same for many years, he had not improved at all.</p><p>Gu Xiao sang lifted her feet and changed her boots into pink and white high-heeled sandals, which made her calves thin and straight. Her skin was white and almost crystal clear. Then she turned to look at Meng Qi, pursed her lips, smiled, and looked him up and down, again and again, but she did not say anything.</p><p>“What’s the problem?”Meng Qi pretended to be calm.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang smiled and said, “Nothing. I finally understand why my husband was still a virgin in Heaven.”</p><p>PFFT. Meng Qi almost choked. Fortunately, he had the strong self-control of the other side. He said seriously, “Everyone has a stage where they don’t know anything.”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang didn’t respond. She stretched out her hands and helped Meng Qi straighten his collar. She changed his plaid shirt into a dark blue slim shirt that was close to black to match his mature temperament. Without a doubt, his jeans had also become casual pants, the white wooden shoes turned into black breathable leather shoes. She felt like a new person.</p><p>“This is barely enough.”She clapped her hands and took a step back, watching Meng Qi return to his appearance on Earth.</p><p>The light faded. The two of them came out of the river of time and officially entered this period of history. They quickly received the baptism of many gazes. Regardless of whether it was men or women, old or young, they could not help but look at Gu Xiaosang, they were amazed by her appearance and temperament. They felt that she was as beautiful as a picture scroll. Some passers-by were so engrossed in her beauty that they bumped into a street tree.</p><p>Seeing this, Gu Xiaosang maintained her demure expression and elegant posture. However, there was an obvious smile in her lowered eyes, as if she was a fox pretending to be serious after secretly eating a hen.</p><p>On the other side of the river, the crossing World Treasure raft had thinned the existence of the Golden Emperor, and she had followed her husband home. She temporarily put aside the shadow in her heart and all kinds of plans, and felt more relaxed and at ease.</p><p>Meng Qi ignored the puzzled gazes, took out the universal sign disguised as a mobile phone, and acted as a base station by himself, dialing home with his original number.</p><p>“Tell me, what’s the matter? Calling home at this time, is it because you don’t have enough money?”His mother asked with certainty.</p><p>Meng Qi coughed and said, “It’s like this, my girlfriend is going on a business trip nearby today. I thought of bringing her to meet the parents.”</p><p>“What?”His mother’s voice suddenly became louder. “Little Bastard, meeting the parents is such a formal thing. How can you treat her as a girl? ! Wait, when did you have a girlfriend?”</p><p>“We’ve been dating for a long time. We haven’t met the parents before. I was afraid that there would be some changes, so I didn’t say anything,”Meng Qi explained.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang stood gracefully by the side. Her right hand twirled her long black hair, twirling it round and round. She listened to his nonsense leisurely with a smile.</p><p>“Oh, my son has grown up. He knows how to ambush!”His mother was both mocking and relieved. “When will you arrive? What’s the girl’s name?”</p><p>“Gu Xiaosang, you can just call her xiaosang. We’re almost there,”Meng Qi said gently.</p><p>Only when it was similar could he truly feel the existence of “Me”. He was afraid that one day, he would completely lose his acquired nature like Jin Huang.</p><p>“Almost there? Little Brat, why didn’t you say so earlier!”His mother gnashed her teeth in hatred. “Take the girl to the nearby shopping mall for a walk. I have to go out and buy vegetables quickly. I can’t be shabby anymore!”</p><p>With that, she hung up the phone and rushed out of the house.</p><p>Meng Qi watched his mother leave. He spread his hands to Gu Xiaosang and said, “Our mother is always like this. Let’s go around the neighborhood and get some gifts for our meeting.”</p><p>He had already prepared the branches of the great green root, the ganoderma, ginseng, and other immortal items that ordinary people could bear. However, he had to include some normal gifts so that they would not appear too abrupt.</p><p>“I’ve already prepared them,”Gu Xiaosang said with a smile as she lifted her left hand. There was a pile of tobacco, alcohol, and health products in it, “When you called just now, I went to the nearby shopping mall to have a look. They even gave me a 50% discount.”</p><p>She seemed to be very used to the life here. As for where the money came from, of course, it was from the void.</p><p>Meng Qi took the gift and looked at the old swing in the neighborhood. He smiled and said, “Let’s go there and sit and wait. I always had a dream, which was to bring a girlfriend to sit on the swing with me.”</p><p>The two walked over slowly. Gu Xiaosang sat on the swing and did not move. Meng Qi stood beside her and chatted with her. The setting sun was low, and the red light cast a layer of golden light on the two of them.</p><p>A few young people passed by and saw this scene. They were shocked. They quietly took out their phones and secretly took a few pictures.</p><p>“She’s much more beautiful than those celebrities!”</p><p>“I’ll give her 15 out of 10!”</p><p>“If I had such a female classmate in the past, it wouldn’t be so difficult for me to memorize the ode of Luoshen…”</p><p>They communicated in a low voice. Looking at the pictures they took, they suddenly felt that something was too annoying.</p><p>“Just go back and Photoshoppe the man next to you…”the young man who took the photo said indignantly.</p><p>When they returned home, they began to photoshoppe. However, they found that they could not erase Meng Qi’s existence. They were sweating profusely, as if they had encountered a supernatural event.</p><p>After sitting for a while, Meng Qi received a call from his mother, indicating that he could bring his wife home.</p><p>He went up the stairs and pressed the doorbell. The door opened quickly as if he had been waiting for a long time. His mother welcomed him to the door with a smile. She was about to speak when she was suddenly stunned by Gu Xiaosang’s appearance and temperament. For a moment, she was speechless.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang remained calm and said with an obedient smile,</p><p>“Hello, Auntie.”</p><p>“Good, good, good.”His mother came back to her senses and welcomed the two into the room in shock. She looked at Meng Qi suspiciously and moved her mouth slightly, as if she was asking something.</p><p>How could her silly son marry such a beautiful and cultured girl?</p><p>Could it be that this girl was good in everything but her eyes?</p><p>However, such a girl was hard to describe even if she was one in ten thousand. There were many temptations in society nowadays, and Meng Qi, this silly boy, could not be considered outstanding, so how could he keep her!</p><p>After they sat down, Meng Qi introduced them to each other. His mother was always cautious and felt that the girl in front of her was like a fairy in the sky, while Gu Xiaosang wore a faint smile and dutifully played the role of a quiet and obedient girl.</p><p>It had to be said that the witch was really able to pretend to be anything she wanted. Meng Qi’s mother was especially fond of her.</p><p>While Meng Qi went to the kitchen to pour water, his mother found an excuse and sneaked in. She lowered her voice and said, “Little Brat, you have to tell me the truth. How can such a girl like you fall in love with you?”</p><p>“Mom, your son is very insightful. In the future, he will be promoted and get a raise. He will become the CEO and walk to the peak of his life. Xiaosang is smart enough to recognize a hero,”Meng Qi said with a smile.</p><p>His mother was angered by his indecency and could only change the topic. “How Old is little sang? I think she is only seventeen or eighteen years old.”</p><p>“She has a tender face. She is about to graduate from university,”Meng Qi lied through his teeth.</p><p>His mother nodded. “Where is she from? What does her family do?”</p><p>“She is from the province. Her father died young. Her mother is the president of a multinational company,”Meng Qi thought for a moment and said. Luo Jiao could be considered a cross-border company, right? There were people on Earth who believed in Wu Sheng’s mother.</p><p>Her mother sucked in a breath of cold air and said solemnly, “Son, such a good girl can only be met by chance and not sought after. In the future, you have to know how to be grateful and calmly accept any kind of result.”</p><p>She felt that with Gu Xiaosang’s conditions, both parties would not last long. At the moment, the only possibility was that the girl’s eyes were blinded by Shi. It was basically impossible after she woke up.</p><p>Although it felt wrong to compare her son to Shi, she felt that it was more appropriate to compare them.</p><p>“Her relationship with her mother is very bad. They are incompatible with each other. She has already broken away from the relationship between mother and daughter. It is said that it is related to the death of her father,”Meng Qi said half-truthfully and half-falsely. He could not say that this quiet and obedient girl was cruel and merciless, she had taken countless lives..</p><p>“Poor girl, you have to treat her well,”his mother said earnestly and left the kitchen. She called Meng Qi’s father and told him to go home for dinner.</p><p>Meng Xiaoqi, who was living in a rented house in another city, suddenly woke up and sneezed. He had a feeling that something bad had happened.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
