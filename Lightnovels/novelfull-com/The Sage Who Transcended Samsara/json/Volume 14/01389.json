However, each layer was broken, and the Strong had withered. No matter how many heavenly soldiers and heavenly generals there were, they could only decorate their appearances and infuse nine levels of natural vitality into them, to stimulate its power, and thus strengthen the heavenly emperor.</p><p>The towering tree entered deep into the Great Dao. The Heavenly Emperor stood under the tree, and behind him were many phantoms, echoing with the immortal realm from afar. He quietly looked down at the Earth, and saw the deep sea west of the Gobi desert churning and surging, with an irreversible momentum, finally, he broke the seal of the green emperor and polluted the surrounding hundreds of thousands of miles into the netherworld. Negative emotions gathered and all kinds of depravity converged, giving birth to one evil god after another.</p><p>There was no longer a trace of brilliance in the vast sky of the western region. It was like a cloudy sky, gloomy and oppressive. Fortunately, the people on the other side had foreseen it. From the Monster Emperor Palace, from the Hollow Jade Temple, and from the Paradise World, there were decrees passed down, good fortune had descended, and all the creatures here had been relocated to the Buddhist kingdom on Earth and the Overseas Immortal World respectively. The Wan Xiang sect, the Snow Mountain sect, and the other sects, as well as the Demon Race’s Sky Sea source and other secret realms, had been ordered to evacuate in time.</p><p>And in the extreme south of the Eastern Sea, the suppression of the Higan golden bridge and the three treasures Ruyi had been weakened by the changes in Heaven’s secrets. They had been suppressed by the momentum of the end of the epoch, and they had also been attacked by the powerful forces of the demon Buddha. In the end, it was difficult for them to recover, and they all flew away, they could only temporarily restrict the fusion of the nine remoteness and the real world to this sea area. However, other places were also plagued by natural disasters. If it wasn’t for the immortals’efforts to eliminate it, the entire intelligent world would have already started to collapse, many universes had reached the end. Some were hot, some were frozen, some were collapsing, and so on.</p><p>All of a sudden, as the demon Buddha refined the nine nether regions, the end of the world seemed to have come ahead of schedule. The end of the era was right before their eyes!</p><p>Under this situation, the mindset of the people who were well-informed due to the universal knowing talisman suddenly changed. There were those who enjoyed themselves in time, those who indulged themselves in debauchery, those who panicked and feared, those who began to believe in the salvation of the world, and those who let go of the heavy burden of the past.., those who devoted themselves to the joy of family.</p><p>In the hollow jade temple, Yang Jian, who was meditating on the Dao and comprehending the truth, suddenly opened his eyes and saw great green root approaching the pavilion.</p><p>“What instructions do you have, uncle-master?”He smiled slightly.</p><p>Great Green Root held its head high and puffed out its chest as it answered, “I am passing on the Order of the sect master. True monarch Qingyuan Miaodao is to go down to the world to guard the Abyss Sea and ward off evil demons.”</p><p>With that said, it changed its fawning smile. “Erlang, you have worked hard. I don’t know why, but this time, it was our hollow jade temple that contributed. The sect master even ordered Daoist seven kills to guard the southernmost part of the Eastern Sea and kill evil demons to sharpen his sword.”</p><p>“Those who are capable will have to work harder.”Yang Jian’s smile did not diminish. He stood up in a carefree manner and bowed calmly towards the jade pure palace. “Your disciple obeys the decree of the Hierarch Uncle.”</p><p>Without taking a step or moving his body, he escaped out of the hollow jade temple and descended onto the quicksand assembly of the past. In front of him was surging demonic qi and the Gobi desert that was constantly turning black. In the depths of the darkness, it was as if there were countless terrifying monsters hidden.</p><p>Yang Jian flicked his ballistic robe and sat down leisurely. He pointed with his right hand, and the yellow flag of Wuji Apricot flew out from the center of the world and stuck at the border between the boundless sea and the Gobi Desert.</p><p>This hollow jade treasure grew with the wind, and in an instant, it pierced through the heavens and connected to the earth, scattering countless golden lotuses. Each of the Golden Lotuses bloomed with trillions of light, forming an empty and faint golden wall, it completely blocked out the black fog and Devil Qi.</p><p>The Evil Gods and Devils didn’t know how powerful they were. Their emotions, which had been destroyed by violence, attacked one after another and crashed into the golden lotuses. As the golden lotuses slowly rotated, they vanished into thin air like bubbles.</p><p>The southernmost part of the eastern sea was even simpler. A delicate Daoist in a black robe sat in the air. Black light whistled around him, constantly flashing and reaping every bit of life force. There was nothing left except dead things.</p><p>The situation in the real world had temporarily stabilized.</p><p>..</p><p>In a vast Buddhist kingdom that was filled with peace and tranquility, ghosts sat around the Golden Lotus Throne and listened to Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva’s profound sorrow preaching, in order to dispel the resentment and obsession in their hearts and free themselves from the self-hell.</p><p>Their number was not enough to fill one of the billions in this boundless pure land. There were empty Bodhi Buddhist temples and Brahma golden pools everywhere. The old ghosts in them were at ease, secretly playing with the universal sign of knowledge, they showed their relatives and friends the beauty of the world after death, dispelling their fear of the end of the world. The new ghosts were anxious and restless. Only the solemn and Merciful Voice of the Bodhisattva could alleviate some of their fear.</p><p>Xuan bei held the wheel of life and death and Ksitigarbha relics in his hands, as if he controlled the mysteries of reincarnation and transcendence. He preached the scriptures to the point that flowers fell from the sky, golden lotuses surged from the ground, and threads of resentment and obsession were removed.</p><p>After he finished speaking, he stopped and looked at the man who was sitting next to the Golden Lotus throne and listening like an ordinary ghost. He sighed and said,</p><p>“The end has come, and the era is coming to an end. Recently, the number of the dead has been increasing. I can imagine what the future will be like in the near future. May I know what preparations the heavenly venerates and Buddhas have made?”</p><p>The man wore a black robe and an ancient crown. He had a warm smile on his face. It was Meng Qi, the grand heavenly venerate of primordial beginning and the sect master of the Hollow Jade Temple. How could he sit next to Xuan bei and listen to the lecture without any grace.</p><p>He smiled and said, “Master is indeed merciful and compassionate. From the future that I have seen and possessed, the end of the Apocalypse is the end of everything. It is far better than the end of the previous era. The ‘crossing treasure raft’that was refined in the past can not protect the survival of all living beings. Only with the underworld in the present world, which is secretly compatible with the afterlife and the final and final destination, as the foundation, can we intercept the general trend of the Apocalypse and refine the most special ‘crossing treasure raft’. Only then can we have a certain hope to carry all living beings through the end of the era and travel in the void, waiting for the arrival of the next era that is difficult to describe.”</p><p>“There is no Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva in the south. It is no wonder that during the ancient mythological era, the Buddhist and Taoist heavenly courts were fighting for control of the netherworld. Now, there is also the appearance of a vacuum hometown waiting to return home after death,”Xuan bei muttered in realization, the surrounding ghosts could not hear him. “No wonder you secretly gave the wheel of life and death to the heavens to help me create a pure land after death.”</p><p>Meng Qi had always felt that this matter was shrouded in secrecy before he reached the other side. That was why he thought of using his master Xuan Bei’s attempt to peek into it. However, after he broke free from the sea of bitterness, he saw all kinds of changes in the future after the end of the epoch, after seeing Earth’s experience as a treasure raft for crossing worlds, he was already clear about it.</p><p>After hearing Xuan Bei’s words.., he smiled and said, “Currently, the authority of the Netherworld is divided by each family. The gold emperor and Amitabha are the main ones. However, if they go their own ways, the treasure raft refined by each family’s final intention is far from enough to avoid the end of the epoch. There will definitely be a competition in this aspect in the future.”</p><p>“Master, even if your Ksitigarbha’s Pure Land has merged with the remains of the former Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, it is still very far away from the lifeless mother and the others. The end of the world is imminent. In order to protect all living beings, I’m afraid that we have to make some changes.”</p><p>Xuan bei was silent for a moment before he said, “What changes?”</p><p>“The former human emperor was also prepared for this and tried to refine the ‘boat of the end of the world’. Unfortunately, he did not do his best. I want to get it and refine it into one with master’s Ksitigarbha’s Pure Land. I want to rebuild the raft and wait for the changes in the future,”Meng Qi said frankly.</p><p>Xuan bei nodded and said in a merciful tone,</p><p>“I only hope that the common people can escape calamity. Why not try?”</p><p>“Good!”Meng Qi clapped his hands and smiled. His figure had already appeared in the Great Zhou Imperial Palace of Changmen Island. He sat opposite Gao Lan and was separated by a table with fine wine.</p><p>The communication between him and Xuan bei just now turned into a ray of light and fell on Gao Lan’s forehead, showing the whole process.</p><p>“Royal brother, if you don’t want to, I won’t force you. If you do, I won’t take it for free. There will be an exchange,”Meng Qi said with a smile.</p><p>Gao Lan held his wine glass, his expression unchanged, he said slowly, “You and I are brothers. There’s no need to talk about such a small matter. Just take it. It’s also a continuation of the will of the human emperor. It’s an inseparable part of the human way. It’s beneficial to me without any harm.”</p><p>“Royal brother, do you really not want to hear what the exchange item is?”Meng Qi smiled a little like Gu Xiaosang.</p><p>Gao Lan’s gaze was deep and seemed to have some guesses. He lowered his voice and asked, “What is it?”</p><p>“Resurrecting sister-in-law Yan ran.”Meng Qi looked into Gao Lan’s eyes and enunciated each word.</p><p>Achieving the other shore and looking back in time was a piece of cake for Gao Lan. Moreover, it would not change Gao Lan’s previous life. However, Meng Qi knew that regardless of whether it was the goofy brother or the emperor’s brother, they were both very proud and proud people, unless it was absolutely necessary, this matter would never be handed over to someone else, which was why he had not mentioned it. However, now that the end was near, if he did not resurrect, he might not have the chance to “Meet”again, after all, Meng Qi himself was not very confident about whether there would be a next era or not.</p><p>Gao Lan’s gaze suddenly fluctuated, as if there was an intense whirlpool hidden in it, meng Qi continued to talk to himself, “This penniless priest knows that big brother is a hero for a lifetime. He only wants to achieve his own Dao and resurrect himself. However, what’s the difference between exchanging his own things for a chance to resurrect himself? “Besides, I won’t do it myself. I’ll let you do it yourself.”</p><p>As he spoke, he took out an object. It was a long jade box. It was covered in a bright and clear light. It felt as if time had stopped. There were four mysterious words written on it:</p><p>“Moonlight Treasure Box!”</p><p>“This object can reverse time and return to the past. What do you think, Brother?”Meng Qi looked deeply at Gao Lan.</p><p>Gao Lan’s hand that was holding the wine cup trembled slightly. He actually looked like an ordinary person. His eyes were dark, like a vast ocean that had been swept up by violent winds and huge waves.</p><p>Meng Qi did not urge him. He waited for his decision. He thought in boredom that if this matter did not concern sister-in-law Yan ran, his brother’s answer would definitely be, “Call me brother!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
