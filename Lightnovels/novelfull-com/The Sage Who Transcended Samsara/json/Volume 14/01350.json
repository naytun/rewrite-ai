We are not heartless people</p><p>The round light expanded, clear and flawless. Inside, the green trees were pure and clear. The branches and leaves were connected to the dao fruit. They went up and down, as if they were pregnant with another era. They invaded the sky and covered the bright moon that was rising toward their home in the void.</p><p>That unflinching attitude and that carefree aura were deeply reflected in the eyes of every great divine arts practitioner, as well as in the hearts of the others on the other side.</p><p>In the Bodhi Pure Land, the quasi-lift Daoist who had not made a move all this while sat in the lotus position and sighed softly:</p><p>“Another person on the other side who is unwilling to compromise because of the dream bubble…”</p><p>He suddenly recalled some of the past events that had been covered up by the changes of history. There was an ordinary human who had gone through trials and tribulations, cut through thorns and obstacles, and endured hardships, passing through many trials step by step, he had finally broken free from the sea of bitterness and reached the other shore. However, he was unwilling to compromise for some meaningless things. In the end, he was surrounded by enemies and became a person who had only existed for a short period of time on the other shore. This benefited old mother Wu Sheng.</p><p>The SU Meng of today was actually somewhat similar to the figure in the past.</p><p>They had really grown up little by little from the smallest and most humble state. They were fundamentally different from other people on the other shore, whether it was their original body, the ancient Bodhi Buddha, or Amitabha, primordial Lord of Heaven, heavenly venerate of morality, heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure, Green Emperor, Golden Mother, Devil Buddha, Demon Emperor, or even the former heavenly emperor, Haotian, East Emperor, Hou Tu, demon saint, and so on.., they were either born with the Dao, or they were born with the spirit of the innate state. The worst ones were also legends after they were born, and the strongest ones were born for the other shore as soon as they had consciousness. Even if they had to experience the tempering of the mortal world in the process of breaking free from the sea of bitterness.., but that mentality that was engraved in the bones was often deeply ingrained.</p><p>On this point, the demon lord’s experience was similar to those of the other two, and the figure of the rebellion against the heavenly court also overlapped with them a little.</p><p>However, his final outcome was also a complete fall, his body scattered across the myriad worlds.</p><p>“But Su Meng is even more determined.”Zhundi Daoist’s gaze was deep as he watched an illusory dao fruit fly out from within the clear and round light. Purple Qi hid white, turning into a blade light that could split the heavens and split the earth.</p><p>Regardless of whether or not mother gold had painstakingly set up the eternal world in order to form the karma of the primordial Lord of Heaven’s legacy technique to attain Dao, helping the primordial Lord of Heaven to become the product of reducing and seeking emptiness to reach the other shore, regardless of which aspect one looked at it from.., she was deeply indebted to Su Meng for attaining Dao.</p><p>If not for mother Gold’s previous attitude and the situation she had created, the monster emperor and Emperor Qing might not have been willing to intervene in Su Meng’s struggle. If not for her sudden betrayal and sneak attack at the last moment.., the Heavenly Emperor, who was hiding in the dark and unwilling to see the primordial beginning heavenly venerate getting closer to the dao fruit, would have used the time blade to stop Su Meng. It could almost be said that when Su Meng attained the DAO, the internal cause must be his own, while the external cause was more than 70% thanks to Mother Jin.</p><p>Therefore, his uncompromising strike towards mother Wu Sheng was not only slashing at her, but also at himself, to repay the Karma!</p><p>Ten percent of Wuji was at Heaven opening perfection. Even if the karma was lacking, Su Meng was still close to the embryonic form of the dao fruit. In addition to the son that the dao master left behind through the true martial secret, he might be able to surpass the other shores in the future, in the end, he was the first to obtain the dao fruit.</p><p>..</p><p>The blade light rose and incandescent white split the sky. Faced with Meng Qi’s vulgarities and powerful attack, the bright and cold moon did not waver at all. Only the indifferent female voice asked calmly,</p><p>“Is it worth it?”</p><p>Yes, is it worth it?</p><p>This blade attack did not care about the grace of attaining Dao. As the cause of all karma, how could meng Qi not know what the consequences would be?</p><p>Karma was hard to determine and a debt of gratitude was attached to one’s body. Not to mention that this era was at most the embryonic form of dao fruit to the extreme, there was absolutely no reason for dao fruit. The next era, the next era, would probably be filled with the unknown and difficult to transcend!</p><p>What did this mean?</p><p>It meant that this slash was also the slash that Meng Qi used to sever his own path and cut off all hope for the future!</p><p>Within the clear and round light, Meng Qi’s eyes were burning with raging flames as he looked into the lofty and indifferent eyes of the gold emperor.</p><p>Didn’t you say that other than the battle for the Great Dao, the rest was just a dream that wasn’t worth paying attention to?</p><p>Fine!</p><p>Then I’ll destroy my own path and get rid of a powerful opponent for you in the battle for the Dao fruit, increasing your hope of completely transcending!</p><p>Is this enough? Is it enough to repay the favor of becoming Dao! !</p><p>To You, it is a dream, but to me, it is extremely precious. I will not allow others to manipulate and play with it at will!</p><p>Whether it is worth it to you or not, to me, there is only whether I am willing or not!</p><p>The river of time suddenly surged. This incandescent white blade light seemed to have risen from the beginning when the Earth, fire, wind, and water raged. It rose from the battle between the six heavenly ancestral dragons and the Heavenly Emperor. It rose from the heyday of Cheng Tang and Yin Shang. It rose from the battle to ascend to godhood, it rose from the time when they were traveling to the west, from the fall of the Heavenly Court, from the destruction of the spiritual mountains, and from every moment in the past. It slashed toward the Jade Lake in the immortal realm, toward their hometown in the vacuum, and toward the underworld in the present.</p><p>This saber light also rose from the side of the Golden Emperor who was sitting high on the throne, from the bright moon hanging in the sky, and from all kinds of possibilities in the future.</p><p>This blade cut off one’s own path of cultivation. It also wanted to cut off the will of heaven that coldly controlled the fate of others. It wanted to cut off the other shore that saw people as illusory bubbles!</p><p>I don’t want to live my life in vain!</p><p>If I don’t achieve the dao fruit, I will be respected in this world!</p><p>The surroundings of the bright moon suddenly fell into darkness. It was as if it had condensed into a point. It was filled with deathly stillness and calmness. It could devour everything and assimilate everything.</p><p>A line of incandescent white light lit up. The blade light cut through the primal chaos, split open the vacuum, and illuminated the darkness. It went straight for the pure white and beautiful finger that stretched out from the bright moon. It was unstoppable and could open up anything!</p><p>The celestial eradication four swords and the formation diagram that was inserted into the Jade Emperor Mountain suddenly flew over. Red, green, black, and white enveloped the blade light and the finger.</p><p>It was not that the heaven opening seal did not have a nemesis. The heavenly lord of Lingbao’s path of eradication was just right!</p><p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, the Heavenly Dao monster and the blade of time in the mysterious sky sect suddenly flashed. They both escaped the battle and disappeared without a trace. The others on the other shore watched quietly and did not intervene to dissuade them.</p><p>The Devil Buddha also used the power of the Heavenly Dao monster to pry open the demon Emperor’s seal and escaped, leaving behind a complicated sigh.</p><p>In an instant, the crimson-green, black-and-white immortal-slaying sword formation disappeared. The blade light that split the heaven and earth also disappeared. The slender white finger was retracted back into the bright moon. A drop of golden holy blood condensed at the tip, it dripped heavily.</p><p>After it landed in the air, it suddenly burned fiercely and turned into an invisible shackle. Layers of shackles were added to Meng Qi’s body, as if they were connected to the source of the Unspeakable Dao, and it was extremely heavy.</p><p>Meng Qi did not attack again. He did not even look at the gold emperor. The bright, round light leaped up and landed in the hollow jade temple at an infinite height, meanwhile, the human emperor sword, the Overlord Saber, the three treasures ruyi, the Wuji Apricot Yellow flag, and Gu Xiaosang threw in the perfect treasure light.</p><p>Returning the Golden Emperor from the path of dao extinction, we are not heartless people!</p><p>From now on, the two sides can not live under the same sky!</p><p>In the Bodhi Pure Land, the Zhundi Daoist looked at the ancient Buddha and laughed, “Just now, mother Jin didn’t say anything soft. I’m afraid she was waiting for Su Meng’s strike.”</p><p>“Su Meng has the tree of Great Dao, so he might have changed,”the ancient Buddha said calmly.</p><p>..</p><p>At this moment, strange lights rose from the 24 ancient wells in the hollow jade temple.</p><p>As the bright and clear round light flew in, the doors in front of Meng Qi opened one after another, emitting clanging sounds that had been silent for thousands of years. It was as if the hollow jade temple had finally acknowledged Meng Qi’s identity and welcomed the new master!</p><p>The round light landed on the top of the hollow jade temple, revealing Meng Qi’s figure. He smiled as he looked at Guang Chengzi, Gao Lan, and the others. The Ultimate Ultimate Prime of the world, Shi Qingyun, flew out from the top of his head. Rays of dark light hung down, and countless golden lanterns floated up and down, billions of golden lotuses, countless pearls, and countless other objects. Then, he solemnly opened his mouth and announced to the heavens,</p><p>“From now on, I am the original heaven venerate.”</p><p>(end of this volume)</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
