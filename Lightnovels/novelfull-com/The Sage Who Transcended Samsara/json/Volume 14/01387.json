His body was like glass, giving off a feeling that he would not be worn down even after a thousand tribulations. A smile that had never changed remained on his face. It was as if he had anticipated all the changes and was waiting for the opportunity now.</p><p>Meng Qi sat cross-legged on the cloud bed. The back of his head was round and clear, containing all the possibilities of the Great Dao. He looked calmly at the golden body of the Saint Buddha and thought of the oldest and most powerful celestial master in the distance. Suddenly, he smiled, the dark, deep, and seemingly one-point primordial Qi of the infinite supreme suddenly flew out and enveloped the perfected golden body of the Bodhi. It was worn down by chaos and assimilated with the infinite supreme, the other side of the eight-nine arcane art dripped into his illusory dao fruit.</p><p>At this moment, the true rulai returned to a stream of clear qi and entered his Niwan Palace. It made his body collapse as if it had turned into a point that was initially the most difficult to describe, this allowed the Supreme True Buddha to take the opportunity to repel the quasi-mention Daoist. With hatred and envy, he retracted the pure and brilliant white light and disappeared into nothingness. This caused the Devil Buddha’s face to turn gloomy. It was as if he was mentally prepared, but it was also difficult to accept.</p><p>Soundlessly and soundlessly, the initial singularity split open. Clear Air Rose and turbid air descended, surrounding an ancient Daoist. His appearance was handsome, and he was none other than Meng Qi. A stream of clear Qi rushed out from the top of his head, illuminating all the worlds in the heavens and illuminating the past era, it allowed his figure to stretch from the last era of the primordial era to the era of the Central Heavenly Emperor, Old Lord Huang. He saw the original tree of Great Dao.</p><p>It was shaped like a peach tree with dense branches and leaves. It was connected to all kinds of Great Dao. Beneath it stood a terrifying and majestic imperial emperor.</p><p>The clear air split into three. Two streams were powerful while one stream was weak. The powerful person flew out first and transformed into two figures. There were red lips and white teeth. There was also a monk with a fan and cloud crown on his head. He was dressed in a water suit and wore a pair of shoes, the handsome Daoist with a silk belt on his waist had skin like glass. He was indestructible. A faint golden wisdom eye that was different from Yang Jian’s opened between his brows. It was closer to the Bodhi and could illuminate all kinds of illusions and see through all the mysteries, it was the eight-nine arcane art that Meng Qi had perfected after assimilating the Saint Buddha’s gold. It was another terrifying existence that was weak on the other shore!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The new nine Netherworlds that the demon Buddha had just spat out collapsed inch by inch. The evil demons and devils that were formed once again self-destructed, causing his aura to drop uncontrollably. His expression became even more gloomy, the oldest feeling of the birth of the heavens and earth also disappeared a little. It was just a hair’s breadth away.</p><p>Meng Qi pointed with his finger. The “Karma of all fruits”condensed into an illusory dao fruit and flew out. It turned into an ancient and mysterious dao-one glass lamp that lit up all the worlds in the heavens. It illuminated all sorts of karma in the world, it caused numerous bright star lines to fill the heavens and earth.</p><p>As the “Karma of all fruits”spun, a few tough and mysterious karma lines on the monkey king grand sage Sun Wukong’s body broke apart. They were cleverly grafted onto the body of the “Qingyuan Daoist”, making him feel relaxed, it was as if he had removed some invisible shackles. His body and mind were lively and he was happy.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>As soon as Daolord Qingyuan was formed, the terror of the Devil Buddha lessened by a little. It was no longer as dangerous as before, when the end of the epoch was just around the corner.</p><p>He snorted, and his gloomy face turned into the dark fire in his eyes. He spat out another Heavenly River and transformed it into the Netherworld once more. He connected the Abyss Sea and the southernmost part of the eastern sea, causing ten percent of the real world to be tainted and degenerated, evil and evil gods wriggled and were born. The nine serenities were indestructible, and they came in an endless stream!</p><p>Then, the Devil Buddha turned into black light, disappeared, and hid in his own Taoist temple — the new nine serenities!</p><p>At this time, Meng Qi looked back at the time, and his efforts to leave a mark stopped at the time when Lao Jun Huang was born, because he was burdened with too much karma, too much burden, and too much backlash. The weight was beyond imagination, every step towards the past was extremely difficult.</p><p>In terms of combat strength alone, he could already suppress the Golden Emperor who had lost the celestial eradication sword formation. However, his actual realm was still unable to reach the embryonic form of the dao fruit and become an ancient, he would probably have to slash out the third purity, ‘heavenly venerate Su Meng’.</p><p>Whatever choice he made and the path he took, he would have to bear the price!</p><p>The Celestial Emperor left the Monster Emperor Hall, the Azure Emperor returned to the fusang ancient tree realm, Amitabha and the celestial venerable of Morals left the real world and returned to their respective Daoist sects. Bodhi ancient Buddha looked at Ghost Emperor Xuanming and nodded in satisfaction, he disappeared outside the Jade Void Palace.</p><p>The important figures on the other side of the river had ended their battle in tacit understanding. However, the fake other side of the river that was forced out of the nine Netherworlds had lost the color of time and revealed a corporeal realm of perfection.</p><p>Under such circumstances, Yang Jian did not say much. He held the Wuji Apricot Flag in one hand and the three-pointed, two-edged blade in the other, transforming into a clear light. He brought the apprehensive Xiao Tianquan back to the hollow jade temple. He had strength and background.., without the nine Netherworlds, he still had his junior martial uncle!</p><p>The demon lord held the reincarnation seal and took a step forward. He stepped into the newly born nine Netherworlds and became the number one expert under the demon Buddha. The Black Heavenly Emperor and Ghost Emperor Xuanming naturally returned to the Bodhi Pure Land of wisdom. They did not have to worry about not having protection.., the nine chaos heavenly venerate took advantage of the fact that the Devil Buddha was affected by Meng Qi’s advancement and the Heavenly Dao monster slightly lost control. Seizing the opportunity, he used the Devil Emperor’s claw to turn himself into a speck of nothingness and disappear between heaven and earth, hiding abnormally well, even the big figures on the other side could not see it.</p><p>The Devil Emperor’s Claw was a sacred object of the devil path that was famous for its filth and mystery. It had its own strengths compared to other divine weapons such as the Overlord Blade. The former was even better at hiding from the heavens and crossing the sea, corrupting the spiritual light, and hiding and evading, therefore, the demon lord could rely on it to deal with the human emperor and the demon saint back then. Now, the nine chaos heavenly venerate could also use this opportunity to hide and protect himself.</p><p>In a moment, the once glorious false shores of the nine underworld had their own places to go. Only Daoist seven kills was left holding his sword and looking around in a daze. But he quickly dismissed these emotions and thoughts. His body and the sword merged together, turning into a lightless and lightless sword ray, he escaped from the real world and tried to hide in the chaos.</p><p>At this moment, the glazed golden light in front of him flourished. Green lotuses and Brahma flowers bloomed around him, setting off a perfect pure land that spanned across countless tribulations and had boundless light. In the center of the Pure Land.., a Buddha with a golden body of six feet sat upright. It looked ordinary, but it felt unusually grand. He said solemnly,</p><p>“The past is glorious, but it is all a dream. You killed yesterday, and now you are killed. Fellow Daoist, you have been forced out of the netherworld. Have you not come to your senses yet?”</p><p>“Put down your butcher’s knife and become a Buddha on the spot!”</p><p>With a severe warning, the seven kills Daoist felt that he was surrounded by a faint golden buddha palm. No matter how hard he struggled, he could not jump out.</p><p>A great divine arts practitioner with a perfect creation level divine weapon would be highly valued by any force. Under certain circumstances, he could change the situation, and it was worth for the great personages on the other side to personally come out and win him over or surrender!</p><p>Humph! He was not willing to surrender. He completely activated his dao body and fully activated the Netherworld Sea Sword, slashing out a pitch-black sword light that could take away all life.</p><p>The sword light was like a snake, slashing down sharply. A Golden Brahma withered and fell into the dust. However, the seven kills Daoist did not advance but instead retreated. Seizing the opportunity, he jumped out of the Buddha’s palm and leaped toward the chaos.</p><p>Suddenly, the river appeared, but it froze strangely. It sealed the seven kills Daoist like a mosquito in amber.</p><p>Outside the river, the palace was dark and deep. There was a deep throne inside. On it, there was an unfathomable heavenly emperor who was staring at the seven kills Daoist. He said calmly and majestically,</p><p>“There is no way out. Where do you want to go?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
