The closer one got to the dao fruit, the more difficult it was to speak of it</p><p>In the void, a sparkling river flowed quietly with countless tributaries. The past glory was all buried upstream, like a lost city at the bottom of the sea.</p><p>Meng Qi returned not long before the fall of the Heavenly Court. His figure appeared outside the hollow jade temple at an infinite height. He immediately felt the ancient, solemn, and dignified aura in the hall.</p><p>The aura of the leader of the three Pure Ones, the first Celestial Master of Taoism, the first Celestial Master of Primordial beginning!</p><p>He had received his inheritance, received his favor, and inherited his name, but he had never met him until today!</p><p>Clang! The sound of the door opening echoed in the dark and deep palace. Meng Qi calmly walked along the familiar path and slowly walked toward the hollow jade palace. On the way, he saw the White Crane Boy and the other old men of the Hollow Jade Palace who had long died, they turned a blind eye to Meng Qi’s arrival as if they did not notice it at all. It was strange as if they were living in a painting.</p><p>Not long after, Meng Qi arrived in front of the jade pure palace. He saw the cloud bed at the top, saw the round, bright, and flawless treasure light, and saw the majestic and profound ancient heavenly venerate who looked like a middle-aged man, he held the purple, white, and pale gold three-treasure ruyi in his palm. Layers of illusory and real phantoms floated around him. There was the Brahma who created the world, and there was the god of foolishness and blindness. They were all projections that had defeated the other shores in the most ancient universe, the primordial beginning “Him and me”that occupied absolute dominance seemed to be supporting an inexplicable “Boat”together, allowing the primordial beginning heavenly venerate sitting cross-legged in it to increasingly separate from the myriad worlds in the heavens and become pure and untainted.</p><p>Four gazes met in midair. Meng Qi looked straight at the most powerful and the most ancient heavenly venerate.</p><p>At this moment, the three ruyi in the primordial beginning heavenly venerate’s palm flew up and slowly flew toward the owner of the node in front of it. The ancient and dignified figure instantly turned illusory and disappeared like a dream bubble!</p><p>The Primeval Lord of Heaven in this period of history had just disappeared in front of Meng Qi’s eyes!</p><p>The three Ruyi fell and Meng Qi reached out his hand to hold it. He felt warm and tranquil, cleansing his mind. It was real and was in stark contrast to the illusory figure of the primeval Lord of Heaven.</p><p>He seemed to be deep in thought as he slowly walked to the front of the cloud bed. He turned around and sat in the lotus position. Just like the primeval Lord of Heaven Just Now, a clear round light appeared at the back of his head, as well as a part of the “Primeval projection”from the most ancient universe.</p><p>After a while, the White Crane Boy entered. When he saw Meng Qi, he was not surprised at all. He bowed respectfully and said,</p><p>“What Are Your Orders, Hierarch Lord?”</p><p>To him, the person sitting in the jade pure palace did not seem to have changed from the beginning to the end, even if his aura and appearance were no longer the same!</p><p>Meng Qi understood and said calmly,</p><p>“Pass on my decree that the disciples of the Jade Void sect have been cultivating in seclusion recently.”</p><p>Until the fall of the Heavenly Court!</p><p>This was also what the primordial Lord of Heaven had said in history!</p><p>As the product of the primordial Lord of Heaven, he had returned to the past. Once he saw the brand he had left behind, he naturally completed the replacement from that period of history to the current node!</p><p>He was indeed closer to the dao fruit than the heavenly lord of morality and Amitabha.</p><p>“As you command, sect master.”The White Crane Boy respectfully took his leave.</p><p>Watching his back disappear in front of the jade clear palace, Meng Qi sighed softly. The closer he got to the dao fruit, the more difficult it became to speak.</p><p>However, he also understood why the heavenly venerate of origin, Amitabha, and the other ancient people wanted to fight for the dominance of the most ancient universe of this era, completely suppressing the other party, because these universes that had their essence improved and “He and I”could be like pillars in a torrent, supporting the original body, causing it to be subtly separated from the universe and the real world. It would become more and more pure and clean, making it easier to reduce and seek emptiness.</p><p>“I haven’t seen the original incipient mark.”Meng Qi’s thoughts fluctuated. He looked at the white clouds and gray dogs. History had changed, and he had a new plan in his heart:</p><p>Since each original incipient mark he saw would naturally be replaced, and it would be difficult to see more clues, he might as well see the mark left by the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure. He would not disappear, and there would always be clues to find out.</p><p>And the mystery of the whereabouts of the two heavenly lords was a problem!</p><p>With a thought, Meng Qi arrived outside the green touring palace on Golden Ao Island. Since the battle for the title of God, there was no more hustle and bustle in this world. It became quiet and cold, and even a boy was rarely seen.</p><p>The gate of the green touring palace was open, empty, and there was no sign of the gatekeeper. It gave Meng Qi the feeling that the other party had long expected him to come, so he opened the middle gate and waited for him.</p><p>Could it be that the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure in this period of history was also played by the Gold Emperor?</p><p>In other words, the gold emperor was the product of the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure’s efforts to reduce the amount of time he had left. However, if that was the case, after he became an ancient, the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure should have already transcended and attained the dao fruit. Why would they fight for it?</p><p>Since he had come, he would take things as they came. As the other shore, Meng Qi was fearless. He strolled through the familiar green touring palace’s door with his hands behind his back and walked all the way to the front of Shangqing Hall.</p><p>The Aura and traces of the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure remained in this palace, but it was empty inside. No one could be seen.</p><p>Meng Qi stepped into the palace and opened his wisdom eyes. He looked at the remnant aura and discerned the clues.</p><p>At this moment, a boy walked out of the side palace. He looked at Meng Qi and was slightly puzzled, but he still said respectfully,</p><p>“The Hierarch Lord has come out of closed-door cultivation?”</p><p>The Hierarch Master? Meng Qi’s heart skipped a beat. He narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice,</p><p>“Pass on my decree and summon the three heavens.”</p><p>Did he think that he was the heavenly lord of Lingbao?</p><p>Moreover, the heavenly lord of Lingbao didn’t even leave a mark like the Dao Master?</p><p>The boy didn’t dare to be negligent and said hurriedly, “We will obey the Hierarch Master’s Decree!”</p><p>After a while, the three sisters of Yunxiao came from the heavenly court and stepped into the Supreme Purity Hall. They looked at Meng Qi and didn’t seem shocked at all. Instead, they bowed with slight confusion, “Greetings to the Hierarch Master. I wonder if you have any instructions for summoning us?”</p><p>Greetings, sect master teacher… Meng Qi’s gaze was deep as he calmly said,</p><p>“The Heavenly Court is about to change. All of you should be prepared.”</p><p>..</p><p>The changes in the situation had exceeded Meng Qi’s deduction. Something strange and indescribable had happened, so he didn’t give up just like that. After pondering for a moment, he looked back at time and arrived before the battle to ascend to godhood.</p><p>Outside the green touring palace, there were mountains and rivers, auspicious clouds, and dense clouds. They surrounded the peaks and formed a world of their own. Countless immortals, gods, and demons came from all directions and landed in various valleys and peaks. They bowed to the supreme purity palace from afar and listened to the sounds of the Great Dao.</p><p>At the location of the palace, a round of flawless treasure light that encompassed all kinds of principles and countless possibilities was hanging high up in the sky. It was bright and clean, and it set off a blurry figure. It was the heavenly venerate of numinous treasure that Meng Qi had met before.</p><p>Meng Qi was like an ordinary immortal God who had come to listen to the Dao. He casually sat in the lotus position and looked up at the Green Touring Palace. When he met the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure’s gaze, he saw a pair of lofty, deep, and obscure eyes.</p><p>Eh? It wasn’t “Empty”, nor did it disappear… Meng Qi felt as if he had grasped some clues from the encounters of different eras.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, he left and arrived at the hollow jade temple of this era. He planned to meet the primordial beginning brand again.</p><p>On Mount Kunlun, the hollow jade temple was ancient and deep. Meng Qi passed through the gate without any hindrance, passed through many obstacles, and arrived at the clear Jade Temple. He saw the ancient heavenly lord holding the Ruyi of the three treasures.</p><p>As expected, the moment the two met, the Three Treasures Ruyi flew up on its own, and the figure of the Celestial Master of primordial beginning disappeared. Meng Qi felt that history had been added to his body, and he had taken on the role of the “Primordial beginning”from this moment until the fall of the Heavenly Court!</p><p>In other words, he was also the “Acting”of the Celestial Master of primordial beginning in the Battle of Ascension!</p><p>“There’s no problem here…”Meng Qi was deep in thought, and he subconsciously turned his head to look at the Green Touring Palace.</p><p>Eh… He was suddenly stunned.</p><p>The bright and clear treasure light and the heavenly venerate of numinous treasure that hung high above the green touring palace had disappeared. There was only the sound of the Great Dao reverberating in the air, causing the immortals and demons who were worshipping to be intoxicated by it!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
