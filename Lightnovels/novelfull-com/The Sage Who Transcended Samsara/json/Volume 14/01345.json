The two intertwined and formed the tai chi image, illuminating Meng Qi’s eyes and removing the last bit of distracting thoughts in his heart.</p><p>There was no way out for this body. If he could not break through the layers of obstacles and slash out the future with one saber and one sword, then there would be absolutely no way to escape, and there would be no chance to escape!</p><p>The tai chi made of purple and light gold continuously collapsed to the center, turning Saint Virtue, merit, and other things into the five ultimate. It returned to a piece of dark chaos, darkening all areas of the real world, all that was left was the round, bright, crystal-clear, and cold moon hanging on an infinite height, sprinkling bits of light.</p><p>The chaos devoured the universe!</p><p>Meng Qi’s sword and blade divine skill, after reaching the ultimate level of infinity, was the most powerful attack he had ever executed with his two nirvana-level swords. It truly felt as if it had pulled all the worlds in the universe back to the beginning, and returned to the absolute void!</p><p>A delicate hand as white as jade stretched out of thin air. There was a hint of darkness at the tip of its finger, containing all things. It was deathly silent and peaceful. It was similar to the combined attack of the sword and blade that devoured the universe, but it brought about the end of everything.., it was the end of everything.</p><p>The moment the two appeared, they came into contact. The Sky and Earth became pitch black. All the stars in the universe seemed to be covered with a black cloth in an instant. The competition was not only in the real world, but also in all the worlds where he and I were.</p><p>After the sword and saber came out, Meng Qi let go of his hands without even looking at the result. He let them do whatever they wanted. The mud ball on top of his head opened, and a Taishang Wuji Yuanshi Qingyun rushed out. It was dark like water and chaotic, it surrounded an extremely ancient and powerful banner of Pangu and a dao one glass lamp that quietly illuminated all the karma.</p><p>Except for the reason of all the karma, there was no movement. The Qing cloud shrank instantly. The banner of Pangu rolled up and condensed into half-formed illusory fruits, as if some aspects of the Real ‘Dao’were manifesting. One was dark and chaotic, and the other was vague and vague, it seemed to contain everything. The other one was surrounded by threads of chaotic energy, but its purple color was deep and its white color was deep!</p><p>As soon as the two fruits were half-formed, Meng Qi felt that they were attracted and pulled by the ‘Dao’. The spiritual light of his nature was rising from an infinite height, as if it was about to jump out of the universe, he looked down at everything from a perspective he had never seen before.</p><p>An illusory crash sounded. He clearly “Saw his body gradually rise from the ancient surging river of time and fate, slowly and unsteadily, as if he would fall into the sea of suffering again at any time.</p><p>When he completely broke away, he would be in the true realm of the other shore!</p><p>This had nothing to do with looking back to the past and possessing the future. To be more precise, looking back to the past and possessing the future were the manifestations of the other shore. It was one of the directions for them to improve, but it was definitely not the essence, the essence was to get rid of the entanglement of the long river of time and the sinking of the Sea of suffering. Standing at the highest and lowest level of the structure of the myriad worlds in the heavens, it was closer to the “Dao”, therefore, the heavenly venerates of primordial beginning, Lingbao, and morals, who were born on the other shore, never relied on “Looking back to the past and possessing the future”to ascend. They followed the passage of time, naturally, they projected the brand marks onto the long river of time, forming an “Ancient snake”. The more powerful one was, the greater the extent of the projection, and the older they would be.</p><p>However, the postnatal realm could not do it. They were tainted by the affairs of the world and eroded by the sea of bitterness. How could they break free so easily?</p><p>They had to rely on the corresponding accumulation of “Looking back on the past”and “Possessing the future”to form a resonance and promote the further formation of the illusory fruit. Then, the three of them would work together, together, they would help Meng Qi’s innate spiritual light to completely jump out of the river of time!</p><p>In the Fusang ancient tree realm, the “Out of nothing”fruit of light leaped up in front of Emperor Qing and turned into a small and complete river of time. It was sparkling and looked like a dream.</p><p>It suddenly expanded and extended toward the past and the future, connecting the nothingness!</p><p>This was Meng Qi’s accumulation of “Looking back on the past”and “Occupying the future”!</p><p>It was the dao of time contained in the flesh and blood of the East Emperor. It was also a road sign left behind in the past and in the memories of others by the supreme mental demon. It was also the thought of occupying the future after the trip to the Void Mountain!</p><p>In the countless illusory tributaries of the long river, and in the only part of the future that was possible, the bottom of the eastern sea collapsed layer by layer, connecting with the Netherworld completely, bringing about an apocalyptic scene.</p><p>Meng Qi’s figure appeared here. He saw an ancient stone tablet floating in the boiling and pitch-black ocean, with the four ancient seal characters of “Yu Xu Su Meng”written on it.</p><p>This scene did not only happen in the future, almost all of the possibilities of Meng Qi not dying were the same.</p><p>The figures of Meng Qi immediately burst into laughter:</p><p>“As expected!”</p><p>By connecting themselves with the things that were bound to happen in the future with the general trend that was bound to appear, it was equivalent to taking the first step of occupying the future. However, this trend could not be too far away from the current node, or else it would not form a resonance.., therefore, at the end of the calamity, it was relatively easy to take over the future. It was better than the ancient mythological era.</p><p>The era was bound to end. This was an irreversible general trend!</p><p>“As expected!”</p><p>One by one, the “Future”Meng Qi burst into laughter. His voice seemed to penetrate the barriers of time and resonated.</p><p>Their numbers exceeded the limit and reached a qualitative change. They reversed their direction and suddenly rushed upstream!</p><p>“As expected!”</p><p>The figures merged at the future branch. The closer they got to the current node, the fewer they were. They were about to return to Meng Qi’s original body. Going back in time, how could the gold emperor and the others just sit back and watch?</p><p>“Burn!””Devour!””Destroy!””Punish!””Kill!””Silence!””No!””Freeze!””Destroy!”</p><p>Nine Dao patterns flew out, accompanied by the destruction of lightning, fire, ice, and ice. It brought about the cataclysm of the Earth and the misery of the living. Holding the heaven’s punishment axe, Zhenyuan zi reached out from his home in the vacuum and slashed toward Meng Qi.</p><p>At that moment, a giant golden-furred hand reached out from the void and grabbed the absolute blade. With a loud cry, it slashed across Zhenyuan Zi.</p><p>On the other side, Yang Jian, who had red lips and white teeth, suddenly opened his eyes. He reached out a palm from the blood sea and pierced through the boundary of the netherworld. He grabbed the emperor sword and summoned the power of all living things, he made the Holy Virtue and merit transform into an invincible sword light that slashed toward mother wusheng, preventing her from interfering with Meng Qi.</p><p>At the same time, he threw out the yellow flag of Wuji Apricot in the center of the world and spread it over Meng Qi’s head. It raised billions of golden lotuses and burst out an infinite amount of light to protect him from the aftershocks.</p><p>However, the sky suddenly became bright. With the glass as the bottom, it was clear. The crystal-clear Bodhi magical tree appeared strangely and brushed away the emperor sword in an instant, preventing it from stopping the Golden Emperor.</p><p>“Good, Lu Ya!”Yang Jian cursed. There was some doubt hidden in his eyes.</p><p>Lu Ya was originally a spy left behind by the original founder. At the critical moment, he would definitely side with Yang Jian. Previously, they had cooperated quite happily. He did not expect that after the betrayal last time, he would be so unrepentant and had no intention of turning back at all!</p><p>What had happened?</p><p>What benefits had he been tempted by someone on the other side?</p><p>Without the hindrance of the Emperor Sword, the bright and full moon lit up the entire river of time. It made Meng Qi’s figure, who had planted the inner demon in the heart of the tower lord of the heartless building a few hundred years ago, the figure of Meng Qi during the middle age overlord era.., meng Qi’s figure, who had witnessed the fall of the heavenly court in the ancient times, suddenly appeared from among the countless figures. He was so helpless and weak!</p><p>At this moment, a soft sigh came from the Fusang ancient tree realm. It resounded across all the worlds in the universe. Green light shot into the sky and transformed into a green tree with an illusory fruit. A purple jade ruler flew out and drilled into the river of time, it went to meet the gold emperor from every node.</p><p>After weighing the pros and cons, the matter suddenly became urgent again. In the end, Emperor Qing chose to support Meng Qi!</p><p>Seeing that the purple jade ruler was about to block the golden emperor’s attack that erased Meng Qi’s “Past”, the Buddhist chant suddenly rang out. One after another, Brahma flowers fell, one after another, the seven treasures of Buddhism rose and fell, and one after another, Bodhi trees grew, they spread to every corner of the river of time.</p><p>A strange, colorful light shone. It was quiet and self-generating, and all living things died. A slightly chipped, sparkling, and holy tree branch swept over, brushing the Purple Jade ruler out of the river of time.</p><p>The Bodhi ancient Buddha carved out the seven treasures wonderful tree from the Pure Land!</p><p>The world suddenly brightened, and a golden bridge with transcendence colors extended from beyond the heavens. It was placed on the sea of bitterness, and it was about to land beside Meng Qi.</p><p>Higan golden bridge!</p><p>The manifestation of the transcendence path in the world!</p><p>The other side of the Taiji diagram!</p><p>At the same time, three Daoists walked over on the Higan golden bridge.</p><p>One of them was young, one was middle-aged, and the other was old. They bowed at the same time:</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, let me help you!”</p><p>This was the three pure ones that the celestial venerable of morality had manifested in one go. They represented the prosperity, prosperity, and decline of the myriad worlds in the heavens. They were the three great manifestations of the foundation of existence. They were not the simple past, present, and future!</p><p>“Mercy, Mercy.”A Buddhist proclamation sounded. The three Sariras rolled with white waves and stood out strangely. The surroundings of the higan golden bridge became illusory and blurred. It was as if they had entered another myriad worlds in the heavens, it contained all aspects of the “Dao”, and it felt like it was about to condense into a true dao fruit!</p><p>The universe was empty, the heavens were empty, the three pure ones were empty, the higan golden bridge was empty, and all kinds of Great Dao were also empty.</p><p>This was the embryonic form of Amitabha’s Dao Fruit!</p><p>The three Daoists each used their supernatural powers, together with the Higan golden bridge, in an attempt to pass through this “Empty”world and return to the real world. However, this was not the ancient mythological era, not the time when Emperor Qing attained the Dao, and the heavenly venerate of morality was the foundation for the existence of the world, the incarnation of Dao was able to suppress Amitabha by relying on the terrifying divine ability of transforming the three pure ones into one qi. It was the end of the era, and the foundation for the existence of this world had declined. His strength had declined quite a bit, and he was on the same level as Amitabha.</p><p>A few higan appeared one after another, delaying the golden emperor’s attack. However, at this moment, there was nothing to stop him. The Monster Emperor looked at the Mount Numinous, as if he had no intention of attacking!</p><p>Deep in the depths of the Netherworld, Daoist seven kills sighed. He pointed his finger, and the Netherworld Sea Sword turned into a dim light that pierced through the Netherworld and slashed toward the Golden Emperor.</p><p>“Even a grain of rice is shining?”In the bright moon, mother Wusheng’s cold and ethereal voice fell.</p><p>With a flick of her slender white hand, the netherworld sea sword was knocked away, and she casually threw out the plain-colored cloud realm flag to trap Meng Qi. Her actions of erasing Meng Qi’s past did not slow down at all!</p><p>At this moment, the general situation seemed to be clear.</p><p>At this moment, Maitreya, who was sensing the situation and looking for an opportunity, suddenly felt a chill run down his spine. He felt as if he had fallen into hell. Pure White Buddhist light and a huge mouth appeared in front of his eyes. There were forty Buddha teeth in it. The Aura was so strong.., it actually had the feeling of the other shore!</p><p>“Supreme True Buddha!”Maitreya thought to himself. In the same realm, the Supreme True Buddha had an obvious suppression on the Buddhas of the Buddhist sect, not to mention that the Supreme True Buddha in front of him seemed to be one level higher than him!</p><p>When did he become so powerful?</p><p>Even Amitabha did not expect it!</p><p>Gu Xiaosang was in the netherworld. She raised her head and looked outside. Her delicate face seemed to be covered with a layer of fluorescent light, and a faint smile appeared on the corner of her mouth:</p><p>“The brand left by the DAO fruit will be absorbed by him as a product of reducing and seeking emptiness.”</p><p>“This is a secret that Amitabha and Bodhi ancient Buddha do not know. Only the most ancient primordial Lord of Heaven or Lingbao Lord of Heaven knows about it.”</p><p>“I asked my husband to take a look at the Buddha in the Netherworld to awaken the Supreme True Buddha to absorb the brand. I didn’t even tell him about this.”</p><p>“If I want to hide it from you, I have to hide it from him too.”</p><p>“Now that Maitreya is in trouble, Amitabha has no choice but to save him.”</p><p>“This is the first preparation!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
