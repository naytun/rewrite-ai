Meng Qi held the Three Treasures Ruyi in his hand and began to talk about the mysteries of the boundless primordial chaos. The structure of time and space was extremely complex and simple. These were all the insights he had gained after years of painstaking cultivation, which had condensed into an illusory dao fruit. Each and every word was as precious as pearls and pearls, as he spoke, the law followed. For a moment, the surroundings were filled with darkness. Numerous golden lamps appeared out of thin air, as if they were falling down from the sky, making everything seem like a dream.</p><p>The Disciples of the Jade Void sect who came to listen to the lecture had different levels of cultivation. Some were intoxicated, while others were deep in thought. The higher the cultivation level, the more intoxicated they were.</p><p>Nezha relied on his conjured physique and innate talent from the green lotus seed of Chaos to form his destiny. He was more proficient in Abhijna and combat, and his understanding of the origin of Dao was relatively lacking. At this moment, he looked at senior martial uncle Guangcheng, senior martial uncle Chi Jinzi, and the others who were listening to him. Some of them had smiles on their faces, some of them were excited, and some of them were puzzled. Although they had also obtained some gains from uncle-master’s narration and were eager to try their own martial arts, how could they lose their composure like this?</p><p>At this moment, a golden lamp fell right in front of his eyes. The flame of the lamp flickered, as if it contained an extremely mysterious and subtle point. He focused his mind and looked over, there was cause and effect, good and evil, front and back, past and future… It was as if all the descriptions of the principles of Heaven and earth had gathered here. The more he wanted to see it clearly, the more he felt that it was endless, in the end, he actually had an illusion. The dots became more and more numerous, connecting into lines. The lines formed a plane, and the plane folded into a world. Then, it connected with time. The later it evolved, the more difficult it was to describe it with words, and finally, it gathered into the point where all the elements, such as void and time, curled up together, as if it had never changed..</p><p>Nezha looked at this scene and was deeply immersed in it. He felt that the realms of legend, creation, and the other shore were also completely included. He did not even blink his eyes, lest he missed any details. The thoughts in his mind moved on their own, he wanted to replicate a similar evolution.</p><p>Suddenly, the golden lamp fell to the ground, extinguished, and disappeared. All the mysteries and subtleties came to an abrupt end. Nezha could not help but reach out to grab it, but it fell into an empty space. His heart was suddenly filled with disappointment and loss.</p><p>He suddenly had an idea and recovered from this state. He was stunned by his loss of composure just now:</p><p>“Am I as infatuated as uncle-master Guangcheng and the others?”</p><p>At this time, Meng Qi had stopped preaching. He nodded slightly and said,</p><p>“Too much is too much. That’s all for today.”</p><p>Without waiting for Guangchengzi, Celestial Master Guangfa, and the others to sigh regretfully, he continued,</p><p>“Senior sister Ci Hang.”</p><p>Ci Hang? Guanyin? Guangchengzi and the other golden immortals seemed to have understood something. They all looked at the Immortal Demon God!</p><p>The Immortal Demon God slowly stood up in the confusion of the third, fourth, and fifth generation disciples. He cupped his hands and bowed:</p><p>“What Are Your Orders, Hierarch Celestial Master?”</p><p>He admitted that he was Daoist Cihang before he became a god, and Guanyin Bodhisattva after he became a god? Duke of Qi Huan was both shocked and taken for granted. However, after he escaped from the Spiritual Mountain, why didn’t he return to the Western Paradise and stay on Tianzhu Mountain?</p><p>Meng Qi’s tone was warm:</p><p>“The end of the era is coming. The end of the world is coming. All living beings are suffering as if they have fallen into the netherworld. Senior Sister Ci Hang, have you forgotten your wish to save them?”</p><p>The Undying Demon God was silent for a moment before he said solemnly, “I will always remember this wish of mine.”</p><p>Meng Qi, who was sitting on the lotus throne, nodded:</p><p>“Then, let’s go to the lower realm to save them.”</p><p>As he spoke, he pointed with his finger and a black mist rose from the Undying Demon God’s body. It was as if there was a thick will of death and a demonic aura of depravity. The two intertwined and formed clear dao patterns, but they quickly spread and returned to their initial state of nothingness.</p><p>As soon as the black mist disappeared, the Immortal Demon God’s body burst with a boundless golden light. Chanting, prayers, and praises echoed around, dyeing the jade pure palace with a bit of peace and mercy.</p><p>The golden light faded and the Immortal Demon God returned to his white-robed scholar appearance. He bowed with gratitude and solemnity:</p><p>“I receive the Order of the Hierarch Lord.”</p><p>He nodded to Guang Chengzi and the other senior brothers, turned around, and walked out of the Jade Pure Palace. He left the jade void palace and turned into a beam of clear light, entering the lower realm.</p><p>Looking at Guan Yin’s back, Guang Chengzi sighed softly, “It hasn’t been easy for him for so many years…”</p><p>..</p><p>After receiving the decree and leaving Kunlun’s Field, Daoist ci hang looked down at the current state of the world. After pondering for a while, he arrived at the water-moon nunnery in the land of Buddha.</p><p>After the Great Zhou dynasty was destroyed, as the inheritance of the great bodhisattva of the Pureland of bliss, the water-moon Nunnery was undoubtedly integrated into the land of Buddha on Earth.</p><p>In the water-moon Nunnery, the current chief nun, CI Zhen, sat in the lotus position in front of the pale golden statue of the great compassion and the great compassion and the World Sound Bodhisattva. She tapped on the wooden fish. Following the wishes of the previous chief nunnery, she had finally achieved the Dao and Dharma body a few years ago.</p><p>The solemn and ethereal Zen singing suddenly rang in Ci Zhen’s ears, and a fresh and unique fragrance entered her nose.</p><p>Her heart skipped a beat. She opened her eyes and saw the suet jade bottle placed in front of the bodhisattva statue glowing with a gentle glow. The willow branches with branches and leaves growing inside the bottle looked even fresher and more ethereal.</p><p>Specks of golden light dropped down from the sky. The pale golden statue of the great compassion and the great compassion and the World Sound Bodhisattva suddenly lost its dull and dead stillness. It was full of vitality and bright colors. When it opened its eyes, it was full of compassion and compassion.</p><p>The chief nun, CI Zhen, had already understood the current situation. She put her palms together and chanted in a low voice,</p><p>“The great compassion and the great compassion and the World Sound Bodhisattva of the South, your disciple greets the arrival of the founder.”</p><p>Daoist cihang said solemnly,</p><p>“In this apocalyptic world, anyone with a benevolent heart should walk in the world.”</p><p>While he asked Cizhen to gather the disciples of the water-moon nunnery, he manifested himself at the border between the Buddhist kingdom on Earth and his hometown in the vacuum state by using the Yingying movement technique, so as to experience the suffering of all living beings and understand what he should do.</p><p>..</p><p>Buddhist temples could be seen everywhere at the border of the Buddhist kingdom on Earth. The crops grew on their own in the fields, and there was a bumper harvest in every season. The people lived and worked in peace, often smiling. Everyone read the Buddhist scriptures, and they were all benevolent and cultivated diligently from time to time, what a scene of the Pure Land of the human world. How could there be any signs of suffering?</p><p>Daoist cihang chanted the voice of the Guanyin Bodhisattva and transformed into a black-robed, delicate-looking BHIKUTI. He held his alms bowl and knocked on the courtyard door of a house.</p><p>The courtyard door opened. The owner was a middle-aged man in his forties. He had a kind and peaceful smile on his face as he said,</p><p>“Is this mistress here to take care of the situation?”</p><p>“Thank you for your trouble, Layman,”the Bhikuti transformed from Guanyin said gratefully.</p><p>The middle-aged man took the alms bowl, turned around, and entered the courtyard with a full meal. Along the way, he chanted the name of Buddha without the slightest bit of slack.</p><p>Guanyin took the Alms Bowl and said with a smile, “Layman, you are so devout in chanting Buddha.”</p><p>“Thank you for your praise,”the middle-aged man said with a modest smile. “If I were as devout as you said, I would have met Buddha Maitreya long ago. I would have attained the position of Buddha and enjoyed the bliss. I would not have to worry about life, old age, illness, or death anymore.”</p><p>“You can enjoy bliss and attain the position of Buddha by devoutly chanting a Buddhist proclamation?”The bhikkuni that was Guanyin frowned slightly. “Then how do you see the Tathagata in your heart and seek the freedom of your nature? Or do you want Buddha Maitreya to replace your own Tathagata?”</p><p>The middle-aged man shook his head blankly. “I don’t understand what the Tathagata in my heart is. My Own Tathagata only knows how to devoutly chant Buddha.”</p><p>Guan Yin gave him a deep look and did not say anything more. She turned around and left.</p><p>..</p><p>Her other body was dressed as an ordinary person. She had already arrived at her home in the vacuum. What she saw was very similar to the Buddha Kingdom on Earth. The people did not have to worry about food and clothing. Everyone was peaceful and quiet. It was just that there was a clear hierarchy between them. They only sincerely believed in the godless mother.</p><p>Guan Yin’s other body was dressed as a merchant from the eastern sea. She entered the inn and found an excuse to chat with the shopkeeper.</p><p>The shopkeeper was a kind-looking man in his thirties. He was fair and chubby. He spoke elegantly and had seen a lot of things. However, any topic would be related to the matter of his mother saving the world.</p><p>“My mother pitied all living things. She didn’t want me to be doomed forever. Therefore, she specially came to save the world and turned the mortal world into a vacuum home. In the future, even if the sky collapses and the earth collapses, she can still live forever in her home…”the shopkeeper kept talking.</p><p>After a moment of silence, Guan Yin said, “Save the mortals, including those in the North?”</p><p>Hearing this, the shopkeeper’s eyes suddenly turned fierce, and he said in a hateful voice,</p><p>“It was because they believed in evil demons and evil gods and accumulated a great deal of sins that the end of the world would come. They had to pay with their lives!”</p><p>His kind-looking face and his benevolence and modesty were all twisted into a hideous look at this moment, giving people an abominable impression.</p><p>Guan Yin listened quietly and sighed quietly.</p><p>It was at this moment that her original body, who was sitting in the Great Hall of the water-moon nunnery, suddenly sensed the change in the energy between heaven and earth. She saw Bodhisattvas with great power and the future stars and Buddhas descending on the boundary between the Buddha Kingdom on Earth and her hometown in vacuum.</p><p>“Has the peaceful coexistence between the Buddha Kingdom on Earth and her hometown in vacuum come to an end?”Daoist ci hang sighed.</p><p>After the arrival of the Golden Mother and the Hierarch Heavenly Venerate, the peace had become more fragile than thin paper. It was not surprising that it had come to an end!</p><p>Somewhere in the home of the vacuum, there was a pure white Buddha hiding. He looked at the scene with a cold gaze.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
