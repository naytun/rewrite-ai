Things are truly unpredictable. At our level, we still can’t see the will of heaven. What’s the use of this divination? What’s the use of this Yi Dao?”</p><p>As he said that, he turned around and walked out of the grand and Majestic Black Hall. He rose up in the sky above the dim netherworld. He removed the ghostly aura around him, the image of the emperor, and the authority in this place. He returned to the appearance of the demon Grand Sage, he broke through the layers of fog and returned to the Fusang Ancient Tree realm.</p><p>According to his original plan, he could still comprehend the mysteries of the world after his death for a few more years to grasp the key to the apocalypse. who knew that Zhen Yuanzi would come so quickly and so forcefully!</p><p>In the hall, the black fog of death left behind by the nine spirits original saint churned endlessly, revealing many blurry dao patterns. They condensed into a dark green-gray imperial seal and fell into Zhen Yuanzi’s hands, it was the symbol of authority in the Netherworld created by Emperor Fengdu!</p><p>“How would I have known about the layout of the immortal realm’s heavenly prison before I had such a fortuitous encounter…”Zhen Yuan Zi sighed as well.</p><p>Everything seemed to have been arranged!</p><p>He spread his hands and caught the green-gray imperial seal. He opened his mouth and spat out a quiet and deathly quiet light that broke through the layers of restrictions and left a mark on the pivotal point.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The gloomy underworld seemed to have been struck by lightning. The afterworld that had been refined surged forward. It passed through the chaotic time and connected with a piece of rotten and ancient Yin Soil, merging with the true Netherworld that flowed on top!</p><p>It was unknown how many layers of this yin soil were divided. At the bottom was the evil fiend sacrificial pool at the beginning of the new age. On it were the Demon God’s dead swamp from the struggle for hegemony in the nine underworlds, and the graveyard of the gods when the heavenly emperor was in the first nine heavens, there were generations of monsters and humans who tried to build hell. There were all sorts of things. The new suppressed the old. The current covered the past, making the “History”seem like a fossil. and at the core of this yin land.., no matter how many layers were accumulated, there was always a murky, pitch-black Luo Feng Mountain. This was the current training hall of Ghost Emperor Xuanming.</p><p>However, at this moment, even if his anger had invaded his cold eyes and his roar could be heard everywhere, he still could not stop Emperor Feng Du’s underworld from colluding with Luo Feng’s world, zhen Yuan Zi, who had been transformed into ghost emperor by the Heavenly Emperor, was also a fake shore here. Both sides were equally matched, and neither side could do anything to the other. Moreover, Ghost Emperor Xuan Ming’s center of gravity was still at the claws of the Devil Emperor, and that place could go out of control at any time.</p><p>The underworld in the layers of dense fog seemed to have suddenly expanded by countless times. The ghost soldiers were dumbstruck when they realized that what they could see was no longer the hazy fog, but the boundless desolate yin earth where strong winds swept, a black sun and a yellow moon appeared high in the sky. Both of them had a rotten and pale feeling, and their souls and bodies were becoming more and more solid. They even had spirit armor that flickered with silver light.</p><p>As this Netherworld was originally filled with all sorts of inadequacies, the ghost emperor that Zhen Yuan Zi had transformed into looked up at the heavens. He paid his respects and said solemnly,</p><p>“Please descend upon the vacuum homeworld!”</p><p>“Please descend upon the vacuum homeworld!”</p><p>..</p><p>After saying it nine times in a row, his sleeves suddenly rose up. The Netherworld turned from darkness to pitch-black. Layers of dense fog were pulled by the tornado and flew down from the sky like two giant pythons. In the endless distance, a dim light lit up, although it did not grow larger, it gradually became clear. It was a hazy world with no end in sight. There was the will of the great boundless bliss in it. It was filled with an eternal dead silence, as if it was the original home of all living beings and the final destination.</p><p>White lotuses bloomed and the clear light turned into dense mist. The Night Emperor and the oracles who were in it looked at each other, not understanding what had happened, however, the supreme will that was faintly revealed from the depths of the vacuum hometown made them not dare to doubt it, and they could only worship it.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>This dim spot brought with it a refined clear light that crashed into the core of the Netherworld, stirring up an endless storm, but it did not affect the soldiers of the netherworld.</p><p>The storm turned into countless white lotuses, and they fell down, rooted in every corner of the netherworld. Some sank into the netherworld, and some bloomed directly.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Beams of clear light were like true dragons, rising from the core of the Yin Cao and completely enveloping this world!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>In the true chaos, in the center of the Pure Land Buddhist kingdom, which spanned across countless tribulations, there was a giant Bodhi tree that held up this world. Its branches were the Dao, and its leaves were the rules. There was nothing that could not be reached.</p><p>At this moment, the “True spirit map of the ghosts and gods”hanging on the Bodhi tree was activated, and suddenly, it shone brightly,</p><p>where the light shone, an obscure, illusory, bliss, and pure ancient will appeared out of thin air from the Bodhi tree.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>In the center of the Western Paradise World, the dreamlike fog and bubbles remained unchanged since ancient times. There were eight treasure merit pools around it, and there were no water waves inside. The bottom of the pool was so deep that it was difficult to see, it was as if it led to a strange and inexplicable different universe.</p><p>Suddenly, lights shot into the sky from these merit pools. They were as green as glass and dreamy, forming a green lotus filled with an ancient aura.</p><p>The green lotus fell, penetrating into the dreamlike bubbles and layers of fog.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A clear light lingered in front of Zhen Yuan Zi’s eyes. His home in the vacuum had already fused with this netherworld. The white lotus petals in the deepest part of the pool bloomed one after another, forming a majestic and holy God. His clothes were complicated and light, ancient and elegant, his face seemed to be obscured by endless space and time. It was hard to see his face, but his eyes, which surpassed everything in the world, left a deep impression on people.</p><p>Zhenyuan zi immediately bowed and said solemnly,</p><p>“Welcome back, Old Mother!”</p><p>The Night Emperor and the other oracles directly bowed and shouted in unison,</p><p>“Welcome back, Old Mother!”</p><p>This god looked down at them and said with a faint smile,</p><p>“The will of heaven has changed.”</p><p>… ..</p><p>Outside the thirty-third heaven, where Dou Shuai Palace was located, there were strange flowers everywhere, and immortal birds and auspicious beasts could be seen from time to time.</p><p>The golden-horned boy was bored to death as he watched the silver-horned boy preaching. Suddenly, he had a thought and looked outside. He saw a slightly emaciated golden buddha sitting on a clean lotus throne. He neither came in nor left, he was six feet tall and his face was full of compassion. There was an infinite will that filled the heaven and earth.</p><p>“Amitabha!”The golden-horned boy blurted out.</p><p>..</p><p>In the mysterious heaven and earth connected by the eye of the sea, the monster Emperor Hall stood quietly. The Little Fox Qing Qiu was seizing the time to cultivate and strive to further awaken the monster Saint Spear.</p><p>Suddenly, she saw the doors of the monster Emperor Hall opening without wind. A Daoist with a bun stepped in.</p><p>This Daoist had a yellowish face and a thin beard. He looked at Qing Qiu with a smile and slowly walked into the monster Emperor Palace.</p><p>“He can actually enter the deepest part of the Monster Emperor Palace that we can’t touch…”Qing Qiu looked at this scene in a daze.</p><p>..</p><p>In the boundless Pure Land, the ancient Buddha with the burning lamp was thinking about all kinds of details and deducing every pass.</p><p>All of a sudden, he saw the phantom image of Ah Nan in front of him turn his head to look at the outside world again.</p><p>“Our Chance is here.”Ananda immediately revealed a meaningful smile.</p><p>Chance? The ancient Buddha with the lamp burning was confused.</p><p>..</p><p>Inside the absolute saber, the boundless sea of lightning was flickering.</p><p>Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang each held the jade disc of Destiny and operated their own boundless chaotic will to wear it down bit by bit and assimilate it into their own bodies.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, the water rippled, as if it was about to turn into a long river, and the Jade Disc of Destiny was reduced to ashes inch by inch.</p><p>“Donghuang is indeed worthy of being an archaic emperor…”Meng Qi could not help but sigh. Just by refining and absorbing the various daos and rules on the incomplete Jade Disc of Destiny, he had directly stepped into the middle range of destiny, gu Xiaosang had accumulated a lot of experience. Once it truly belonged to him, he would be able to break through the barrier consecutively.</p><p>Of course, directly absorbing and refining the DAO condensed by others would conflict with his own, causing his foundation to be unstable. In the future, he would have to spend more time polishing it. If Wuji did not contain everything, Meng Qi might even explode and die on the spot, however, in the face of the great calamity, he had to step into the realm of Perfection of Destiny as soon as possible and get rid of the remaining spirituality of Donghuang. He could no longer care about these things and only hoped that he could make up for it after the calamity had passed.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang opened her eyes and smiled. Just as she was about to speak, her expression suddenly changed. Meng Qi had never seen such a look of shock in her eyes before. She blurted out,</p><p>“Old mother is back!”</p><p>Old Mother is back? She actually returned at this time? Meng Qi’s mind buzzed and had the same shock.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
