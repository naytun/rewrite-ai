Thus, he was transported over while traveling, and he flew towards the rumored location without stopping.</p><p>As he hurried, he grumbled. If it wasn’t for the fact that his hometown of vacuum and the Buddhist kingdom on Earth prohibited ultra-long-distance teleportation to the outside world, why would he be in such a sorry state? It was said that it wasn’t like this more than a hundred years ago.., at that time, not only was there a teleportation array to communicate with the ends of the earth, but everyone had a magical artifact called the universal sign of knowledge. They could communicate with each other from thousands of miles away as if they were in front of their eyes. They all looked like Mighty Immortals.</p><p>However, he had seen the so-called “Universal sign of knowledge”in the hands of those old men who were about to lie in their coffins. He searched and searched but couldn’t find anything special, it felt as if they had fabricated a beautiful fairyland in the future to coax their juniors into cultivating diligently.</p><p>If not for the fact that all the old fellows he had met had said the same thing, he would definitely doubt it!</p><p>Was this still the real world?</p><p>“According to the old men, our generation is too miserable. We have to run around collecting materials and never see anything strange in our lives. Unlike those years, when we could experience hundreds of battles without leaving home, and directly observe how other people explored ruins and ruins to obtain corresponding knowledge, we could casually shop around and compare everything. Moreover, we don’t have to worry about being deceived, and we can talk nonsense with the living beings in the universe… This kind of thing is hard to imagine even in our dreams. It’s impossible for the old men to make it up without any evidence. Could it be the secular style of the ancient mythological era?”Lin Suhe thought in a daze, “But the ancient records passed down from the mythological era didn’t record these things either…”</p><p>As the light flickered, the coastline could be seen clearly. Lin Suhe retracted his thoughts and looked over. He saw strange lights floating in the air like Fireflies. They were clearly divided into several camps, and they were confronting each other.</p><p>Those were powerhouses that were not inferior to him!</p><p>However, Lin Suhe was not surprised. Instead, he was happy. This meant that the ‘meteorite crystals of the galaxy’had not really appeared yet. He had finally caught up!</p><p>Just as he was about to slow down the light to get close to them, he suddenly heard a loud rumble. It was like the earth had collapsed, or a mountain had collapsed. A deep crack appeared on the coastline, and rolling black fog emerged, it quickly polluted the surroundings, and an evil and terrifying aura spread out like a tide.</p><p>“It’s the nine nether crevice again…”Lin Suhe sucked in a breath of cold air. The world was really becoming more and more fragile!</p><p>According to the Old Fellows’descriptions, the world was currently in its final stages, and it was slowly approaching the end of the epoch. When the world collapsed, it would be difficult for immortals and Buddhas to survive, and all living things would return to chaos. No one would be able to escape.</p><p>Although he could not confirm whether what they said was true or false, the frequency of the nine nether crevice appearing over the years was getting higher and higher. The number of times it appeared was increasing, and every time, it would take a lot of effort to seal it, if this continued, in another hundred years, the nine serenities would completely descend on the real world, completely polluting and destroying heaven and earth. All living beings would go crazy and despair as they welcomed the end of the epoch.</p><p>Just as he was thinking, another earth-shattering explosion sounded in his ears!</p><p>It was so close that Lin Suhe was shocked out of his wits. His vision was dark, and he could no longer maintain his escape light. He fell to the surface of the sea like a rock.</p><p>Before he completely lost consciousness, he saw the sea surface collapse into a huge whirlpool. Layers of black light emerged from the core and dyed the surroundings.</p><p>It was another nine serenities crack..</p><p>..</p><p>Light and shadow flashed in front of his eyes, and his mind was in a mess. Lin Suhe shook his head and finally recovered from his daze.</p><p>He was still alive?</p><p>He was still alive after falling into the nine serenities crack?</p><p>He looked at himself in surprise and didn’t find any serious injuries. As far as the eye could see, it was a street with a strange appearance. The buildings on both sides were tall and strangely shaped, but there was also a unique sense of beauty, for example, the forty-nine-story building that could almost touch the stars had glass windows on one side that reflected the light. It was beautiful and magnificent.</p><p>“It’s completely different from the twenty-eight worlds of the Seven Seas. Where did I go?”Lin Suhe rubbed his forehead. “But it clearly doesn’t look like the nine Nether. Could it be that I’ve transmigrated?”</p><p>He had read some stories from the old men. It was said that they were written by some boring guys in the romantic era. There were many travel notes about transmigrating to the universe.</p><p>At this moment, a sharp horn was heard. Lin Suhe turned around blankly and saw a black iron box parked behind him.</p><p>This seemed to be their carriage?</p><p>It seemed to be a mechanism made by the ink palace..</p><p>“Are you crazy? ! You’re daydreaming in the middle of the road! You’re rushing to be reincarnated!”A middle-aged man came out of the carriage and shouted angrily.</p><p>“I’m sorry.”Lin Suhe instinctively apologized and retreated to the side. Then, he watched the other party walk away, still in a daze.</p><p>His spiritual sense was detected, but it was not weakened. He quietly observed the place. There was a long line in front of him, as if waiting for something.</p><p>At this moment, a girl in a white dress was holding a few books in her arms. She ran over in a hurry. Her black hair fluttered in the wind, and she was elegant. She was at the end of the line.</p><p>Seeing this girl, Lin Suhe’s eyes lit up. He felt that she was the most beautiful person he had ever seen in his life. Her eyes were black and white, and there was a trace of innocence in them. She was cold and elegant as a whole.</p><p>“What are you waiting for?”Lin Suhe subconsciously hit on her.</p><p>The girl turned around and looked at him with a serious expression. “Er Lang’s cookcake.”</p><p>“Is it very delicious?”Lin Suhe asked instinctively.</p><p>The girl nodded slightly. “It’s very delicious.”</p><p>Before she answered, Lin Suhe vaguely heard a grunt, which made him hungry.</p><p>“It looks like you have to queue up for a long time.”Lin Suhe found something to say.</p><p>The girl pursed her lips and said in a serious tone, “Good food needs to be pious. After eating, it’s time for the guqin lesson.”</p><p>“Guqin lesson?”Lin Suhe felt that it was natural for the girl to learn the guqin.</p><p>The girl said calmly, “My mother keeps forcing me to learn talent. She hopes that I can become a star.”</p><p>“Then do you like guqin?”Lin Suhe asked.</p><p>As the team moved forward, the girl took a step forward. Her gaze fell on the book in front of her and she said calmly, “I like it.”</p><p>Lin Suhe chatted for a while more until the young girl had bought the cookcake and left. Then, she strolled along the street. Her Taoist robe attracted a lot of attention.</p><p>“I forgot to ask her name…”Lin Suhe suddenly came to a realization. When he was about to turn around, he found that he had unknowingly arrived at a garden, a very small and ordinary garden.</p><p>In the shadow of the green trees, a few elders were supporting a table and playing things like hanging horses. One of them had a pale golden complexion and a long beard. He looked like an immortal. One of them had a lean face, ruddy and healthy, while the other had a cold expression, he did not smile, but the other was always smiling and making people feel close to him.</p><p>They had the ability to attract people’s attention, so Lin Suhe was curious and looked at them.</p><p>The half-hundred men with long beard sensed their gazes and raised their heads to look at Lin Suhe. They chuckled and said, “Little friend, are you bent on pursuing Dao? When we were young, we also went up the mountain and Cultivated Dao.”</p><p>“You Cultivated Dao?”Lin Suhe exclaimed in surprise.</p><p>There were people cultivating the Dao in this world?</p><p>“We casually cultivated it. Now that we’re Old and retired, we’ll be satisfied if we can gather together and play mahjong when we have time,”the old man said with a smile, letting people get close to him. He casually pointed to the side and said, “We’re not as hardworking as young people.”</p><p>In the direction he pointed to, there was a young girl wearing a light yellow dress. She was focused on waving the sword in her hand, leaving Lin Suhe with an infinitely beautiful back view.</p><p>“She’s also cultivating?”Lin Suhe asked in puzzlement.</p><p>“No, no. She’s training her sword skills. She wants to be the champion of this year’s world’s Number One Sword Dao Conference,”the fifty-one-year-old man who had spoken at the beginning said with a smile.</p><p>What the hell is this… the corner of Lin Suhe’s mouth twitched. He felt that he had been teased by a few elders.</p><p>He asked a few more questions, but none of them got to the point. Therefore, he strolled out of the small garden and returned to the road. At this time, a group of machine cars that he had seen earlier rushed over and blocked both sides of the road, preventing anyone from passing through.</p><p>“The CEO of the Great Zhou Group is here to inspect this place…”the pedestrians at the side whispered to each other.</p><p>The CEO of the Great Zhou Group? Lin Suhe pricked up his ears to eavesdrop, understanding the position of this “CEO.”More than 50% of the country’s businesses were monopolized by him, and he controlled the People’s food, clothing, and transportation.</p><p>A dark mechanical vehicle drove past, surrounded by people from all directions. However, Lin Suhe’s eyesight was so good that he instantly saw through Liu Li and saw the man in the back seat.</p><p>He was tall and well-built, sitting like an ancient bell. His face was chiseled, and his lips were thin, showing a bit of ruthlessness and coldness.</p><p>Eh, why do I Feel a little familiar? Lin Suhe was stunned. Thoughts surged in his mind, and he kept thinking about it.</p><p>Isn’t this what those old men said the current human emperor was looking at?</p><p>They still retained many images from the past!</p><p>After thinking about it for a lifetime, what Lin Suhe saw suddenly became hazy, as if it was covered in a layer of fog. His entire body grew taller and taller, as if he was looking down on everything. Then, he saw a pitch-black mountain peak, he saw a pearl that glowed with five colors. He saw Purple Bell that was expanding and contracting like a heart. He saw a pair of eyes that had all their emotions buried in the deep darkness.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
