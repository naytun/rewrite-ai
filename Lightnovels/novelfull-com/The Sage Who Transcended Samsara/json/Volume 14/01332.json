Thump! Thump!</p><p>Lin Suhe seemed to have heard his own heartbeat. It was so intense and clear that if he was not careful, his heart would leap out of his chest.</p><p>On the top of the pitch-black mountain, a young man in a black robe sat in the lotus position. His black hair was casually draped over his shoulders, and every strand of his hair was suffused with a spiritual luster that made one’s heart palpitate.</p><p>The Pearl that was emitting five-colored light turned into a bright moonlight and hung behind his head, making his face blurry. One could only see the pair of deep, cold eyes that were as deep as the bottom of the sea.</p><p>No, it should not be described as “He”. It seemed more appropriate to use “He”!</p><p>“He”looked like an ordinary person. He was certainly small compared to the mountain. However, sitting there made people involuntarily ignore heaven and earth and the mountains, as if they were just his background, his throne.., moreover, he gave people the feeling that he was not in this world at the moment, as if he was outside everything, quietly overlooking the passage of time, the passage of time.</p><p>As a monk in the 28 worlds of the Seven Seas and knew many old guys, Lin Suhe was definitely not a person with shallow knowledge. He had once participated in the birthday of Empress Sanxiao as a follower, and had entered and left the immortal’s Cave, there were many Arhat Bodhisattvas and venerated immortals and Buddhas that he had seen from afar, but none of them possessed the aura of the young man in front of him. None of them possessed that immutable feeling!</p><p>He was definitely the strongest among the Gods, Buddhas, and saints that I had ever seen. He was definitely one of the few figures in the world!</p><p>Just as this thought appeared in Lin Suhe’s mind, he saw the celestial venerate-like man clench his fist out of thin air. The Ocean of vitality immediately stirred up a tide and condensed into a sparkling crystal.</p><p>“Galaxy meteorite crystal? A creation from the Void!”Lin Suhe was shocked, his heart beating like a drum. Then, he heard the man say calmly,</p><p>“Since I saved your life, please send this thing to the Fusang Ancient Tree Realm for me.”</p><p>With a wave of his hand, a green light flashed, and a green mottled jade box and the galaxy meteorite crystal appeared in Lin Suhe’s arms.</p><p>Just as Lin Suhe was about to speak, the light and shadow in front of him changed, and he had already lost his perception.</p><p>His figure retreated rapidly, as if rippling through time. Then, he appeared by the side of the road. In front of him was the convoy of the President of Great Zhou, appearing in an ordinary garden. He saw four fifty-year-old men supporting tables, carrying a horse, a young girl dressed in yellow clothes was practicing her sword without any distractions. She appeared by the side of the busy street, chatting with the young girl in a white dress who was waiting in line for a pancake. When she appeared in the rolling black fog, her senses were completely deprived, she appeared above the dark vortex. Her eyes lost their souls and her mind was buzzing.</p><p>Finally, she appeared above the blue sea. The light of escape slowed down and she tried to hide. The waves under her body rose and fell. There was some calmness in the gentleness.</p><p>“It’s the nine serenities crevice again…”Lin Suhe looked at the scene on the shoreline and sucked in a breath of cold air. Then, he suddenly realized that something was wrong. Why was there a green mottled jade box and a galaxy meteorite crystal in his arms?</p><p>Seeing them, he immediately recalled the pitch-black mountain peak, the man in the black robe who was as imposing as this world. He recalled his orders, but he had no memory of anything else, as if he had never experienced it before!</p><p>Saved My Life?</p><p>Lin Suhe’s heart stirred. He vaguely understood that he was in danger. Without thinking, he accelerated his escape light, pushed aside the waves, and fled to the familiar twenty-eight sectors of the seven seas.</p><p>His escape light had just disappeared from the spot for a few moments when a loud boom erupted without warning. The seabed shook violently, as if it had collapsed. A terrifying vortex immediately formed, and layers of black light emerged from the core, it dyed the surroundings.</p><p>Although Lin Suhe was still shaken out of his wits, he avoided the place where the vortex had appeared. After falling into the sea, he choked on the salty water and instantly woke up. Once again, he set up his escape light and left the surface of the water.</p><p>Looking back at the terrifying whirlpool, he couldn’t help but shudder. He didn’t dare to imagine what would happen if his reaction was any slower.</p><p>Was this what that existence meant by ‘Saving My Life’?</p><p>Lin Suhe once again looked at the green and mottled jade box and the galaxy meteorites in his arms. He couldn’t help but be alert and sweat profusely. Then, he turned into his escape light and hurried to the nearest island with the teleportation array, he wanted to reach the fusang ancient tree realm as soon as possible.</p><p>Could that be a demon god from the Netherworld?</p><p>..</p><p>On a dark mountain peak on a certain level of the netherworld.</p><p>After Lin Suhe ‘retreated’out of this realm, a light that was almost chaotic descended from the sky and landed beside the black-robed man. It turned into a handsome man wearing a fan and a cloud crown, the handsome man was wearing a pair of shoes and a silk belt around his waist. His body was shrouded in a dark red glow that did not seem demonic. It blended perfectly with the surrounding environment. He was none other than Yang Jian, the Supreme Master of the mystical dao of Qingyuan.</p><p>He sat down casually and looked around casually. “Where’s Miss Gu?”</p><p>“She went to plot against old mother Wusheng,”the black-robed man said in a low voice. It was Meng Qi, who had hidden in the Netherworld years ago.</p><p>Relying on the magical attraction of the demonic blood peach to the remnants of donghuang, Gu Xiaosang “Transferred”herself and the terrifying flesh and blood in his body into the human emperor sword. She relied on the essence of the other shore to seal and suppress it, thus awakening Meng Qi.</p><p>However, since Donghuang’s flesh and blood had already destroyed the inner world and polluted his body, the two of them spent a long time in the dual cultivation path. The initial and final complement of the infinite will of Chaos pulled out the remaining power bit by bit, bit by bit, it was grinded and assimilated into their bodies, returning to normal.</p><p>Then, the two of them entered the remnant myriad realms in Donghuang’s body. As they honed their skills, they fought against Donghuang’s spirituality and innate gods. As they killed and assimilated more innate gods, the number of innate gods gradually increased, a qualitative change occurred in the comparison of their strengths. In the end, they swept across the myriad realms and completely wiped out the remnant spirituality of Donghuang.</p><p>With this premise, Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang no longer had any obstacles or hidden dangers when they refined Donghuang’s flesh and blood. They advanced by leaps and bounds and used this opportunity to comprehend and grasp the great dao of time contained in the little peach. Of course.., there was a clear gap between the realms of the two at that time. Meng Qi was able to endure more and refine more. After completing his cultivation, he stepped into the peak of the creation realm and traveled back to the beginning of his life in the netherworld, he reached the pseudo-nirvana realm, and Gu Xiaosang had also completed it ten years ago.</p><p>For so many years, the two did not mention much about the tragic incident back then. Because the pain and hatred were engraved in their hearts, there was no need for them to keep it a secret.</p><p>Yang Jian did not ask further. He smiled and said, “You seem to have started preparing as well.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded gently and said in a calm tone, “I have broken through a little more. From today onwards, I have to build up my strength bit by bit and advance step by step. In the end, everything will be fine. I have to reach the other shore in front of Mother Wusheng.”</p><p>When he mentioned mother Wusheng, his tone was still a little agitated.</p><p>“To reach the other shore, the right time, place, and people are indispensable. I must patiently wait for the opportunity.”Yang Jian’s handsome face was not tainted by the darkness of the nine underworld as he said with a smile, “But before long, an opportunity will appear.”</p><p>Meng Qi was not surprised. “You Mean Maitreya?”</p><p>“In the past, the lifeless mother went back in time and resurrected the Aquarius Oracle. Amitabha also intended to change history so that Maitreya’s ‘Relic of the future’would not be shattered. Who knew that Maitreya would stop it and make a great wish? ‘Do not save the Apocalypse, do not seek the future’. Now, the Buddhist kingdom on Earth occupies half of the real world and has spread across the multiverse. Maitreya has touched upon the wonders of the other side and has the possibility of breaking free from the Sea of suffering,”said Yang Jian without a trace of gloominess, “Once he attempts to attain the DAO, he will definitely stir up the harmony between the Buddha Kingdom on Earth and the vacuum homeworld for more than a hundred years. At that time, the other shores will have to go through a battle. This is your chance.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly. “It’s a rare opportunity, but the accumulation of one’s foundation is even more rare. You Can’t put the cart before the horse.”</p><p>Yang Jian clapped his hands and smiled. “Good! Senior Demon Slayer was too tight on the opportunity, so he barely managed to act and ended up in a miserable situation.”</p><p>Meng Qi gave him a deep look, he said slowly, “Ever since the search for teacher Yuan Shi’s whereabouts, your whereabouts have been unknown. You appear to be unfathomable. After going through the ages, your foundation has probably accumulated even more. The hope of reaching the other side is the same. Why Don’t you try it yourself and instead place your hopes on me?”</p><p>Yang Jian chuckled, he said seriously, “I’m used to being cautious. I’ve always liked to keep things to myself and go easy on others. I don’t have the hobby of going all out, so I don’t have the momentum to fight to the death. On this point, I’m inferior to you, junior martial uncle, and I’m also inferior to Monkey Sun. And even if everything is prepared and there’s no other side to obstruct the path, the chances of escaping from the sea of bitterness are only fifty-fifty. Once I fail, there’s no chance of a comeback.”</p><p>“In addition, Patriarch left some words for me. I can also sense it in my heart. My chance of attaining Dao will be in the next epoch, if there is still the next epoch.”</p><p>“Then why are you pinning your hopes on me?”Meng Qi’s gaze was deep, almost able to reflect Yang Jian’s figure.</p><p>Yang Jian pondered for a moment:</p><p>“To put it simply, junior martial uncle, you are not only him and me of the Fiend Buddha. You are also a product of Patriarch’s minimalism. Ever since you received the Dao one seal, you have been like Monkey Sun who has cultivated eight or nine times.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
