The knife of time was quietly placed on the offering table without any unnecessary reaction.</p><p>In the face of this, Meng Qi was indifferent and continued to speak as if he had never expected to receive an answer:</p><p>“If the celestial emperor can really return, he will directly return to his peak state. If he still needs time to consolidate, I believe he won’t mind having an ally on the other side.”</p><p>“As long as he or you make a move at the critical moment, I will help the Celestial Emperor return to his peak state after I have attained the other side.”</p><p>After he finished speaking in the manner of a great wish, he immediately withdrew his gaze and dispersed the purple in the eyes of the current leader of the mysterious Sky sect. He withdrew his inner demons and did not wait for the reaction of the time knife, he did not care whether it could convey these words to the celestial emperor who was still alive.</p><p>Mount Yuhuang was still there, and the mysterious Sky sect was still there. No important figure had snatched the time blade away. It was not like they were not waiting for a rabbit!</p><p>..</p><p>At the lowest level of the nine Netherworlds, at the core of the Netherworld Sea Ruins, sat a young man in a black robe. His face was delicate, and there was a hint of weariness and exhaustion from the secular world and everything else, on his knee was a dark, lightless sword that was three feet and three inches long. With a wave of his hand, it seemed like he was going to end everything, including himself.</p><p>Suddenly, a purple light flashed in front of him. It twisted and squirmed, transforming into Meng Qi’s figure.</p><p>“You’re here,”Daoist seven kills said calmly.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly. “I’m here.”</p><p>“What can you use to convince me?”Daoist seven kills seemed to have already known his purpose for coming.</p><p>“The only ones in the Netherworld who are qualified to interfere in the real world are you and nine chaos. He is a madman who has no reason and only knows how to destroy. He is unable to communicate.”Meng Qi did not directly answer Daoist seven kills’s question, instead, he mentioned the matter of the netherworld.</p><p>In the current pseudo-nirvana realm, the ones who had the ultimate nirvana level were himself, Yang Jian, heavenly venerate nine chaos, and Daoist seven kills. They could barely withstand two or three attacks from the big figures after they left the netherworld, however, Meng Qi did not expect them to participate in the main battlefield. He only hoped that they could scatter the corresponding treasures such as the plain-colored cloud realm flag, the Green Lotus treasure-colored flag, and the Heaven’s punishment axe.</p><p>After a pause, Meng Qi continued without waiting for the seven kills Daoist to speak, “As for the reason, if I die, the Devil Buddha will be complete and return to the ranks of the ancient. Isn’t that enough?”</p><p>The seven kills Daoist said with displeasure in his eyes, “The netherworld sea sword has completely awakened. I am in the Netherworld, and I am the false other shore. If I can’t defeat him, will I still be afraid of Him?”</p><p>“The Devil Buddha is a devil after the Buddha. I am quite worried that he will think of a way to assimilate or even swallow the netherworld, and your false other shore is just a gift from the Netherworld.”Meng Qi slowly said and then his figure disappeared. The purple light dots were like illusory bubbles, they disappeared in an instant.</p><p>The seven kills Priest watched the purple light dots die out, and his eyes gradually became dark.</p><p>..</p><p>“Mother! Mother!”</p><p>The childish voice kept ringing in her ears, as if it was from her past life. Gu Xiaosang slowly opened her eyes, and the bright stars reflected in them. It was dreamy and mysterious.</p><p>She looked around and saw that it was a magnificent bedroom, with a priceless guqin, one of the most famous Xiao pipes in the world, and a thick and warm carpet on the floor, it was so comfortable that people wanted to lie down on it.</p><p>In contrast to these, there were a lot of black wooden strips nailed on the windows. They were layer by layer, strong and solid, without any light. What was even more strange was that there was no door in this bedroom!</p><p>“It’s really twisted…”Gu Xiaosang curled the corner of her mouth and revealed a playful and self-deprecating smile. She turned a deaf ear to the “Mother”call that kept echoing in the room.</p><p>She got up from the bed and slowly walked to one of the windows like a pair of snow-white elves with her bare feet. She reached out her hand and caressed the layers of black wooden strips.</p><p>When she reached back, a bit of light actually came in from the outside world. A small gap had appeared between the two perfectly sewn black wooden strips at some point in time, connecting several layers of closed gaps, it showed the perseverance and recklessness of the excavator.</p><p>The smile on Gu Xiaosang’s face became more obvious. She walked lightly through the gap like a shadow, through the black wooden planks and the window itself.</p><p>Outside was not a courtyard, but a wide river with no end in sight. A ferry boat was parked on the bank, and an old boatman wearing a bamboo hat stood on it.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang walked forward barefooted, as if she was on a picnic in spring. It took her a long time to get to the side of the ferry boat and see the boatman clearly.</p><p>His face was yellowish and his wrinkles were deep. His eyebrows and hair had long fallen off. Gu Xiaosang did not say anything and directly boarded the ferry boat and sat on the bow.</p><p>The Boatman held the pole, and the ferry boat set off into the heart of the river. At this time, Gu Xiaosang smiled and casually bowed:</p><p>“Greetings, Buddha.”</p><p>This boatman was actually Buddha, the Amitabha in Amitabha Buddha, the ancient man on the other shore?</p><p>“Receiving is receiving. Buddhas have no ancestors,”the old boatman said calmly, tacitly acknowledging Gu Xiaosang’s address!</p><p>Gu Xiaosang smiled and said, “They would all guess that I wanted to use the flesh of Donghuang to hook up with the Monsters of the Heavenly Dao, or to secretly look for Fu Huang or the emperor of heaven, but that was not enough. So I hid in the absolute blade and pretended to start planning. When my husband cut off my mother’s hand that reached into the Netherworld and blocked the Black Emperor of heaven, I used the absolute blade as a cover to step into the ‘Heaven of his transformation’and enter the place that gave birth to the ‘son of Heaven of great freedom’. I used the source of the inner demon to hook up with the Dreamland and invited Buddha as a guest.”</p><p>Amitabha was a nickname for a certain level in the underworld, the paradise of the sky demon, and Amitabha was the real master of Dreams.</p><p>“Merciful, Merciful, why are you looking for me?”The Old Boatman was not surprised by Gu Xiaosang’s explanation.</p><p>“Of course, I’m asking Buddha to help my husband ascend to the other shore.”Gu Xiaosang made this request righteously. If there were bystanders here, their eyes would probably pop out.</p><p>Wasn’t Amitabha the one who blocked Dou Shuai palace and prevented the heavenly venerate of morals from making a move, allowing the gold emperor to deal with Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang unscrupulously?</p><p>Wasn’t Amitabha the one who formed a stable alliance with the Gold Emperor and divided the core of humanity equally?</p><p>She actually asked the other party for help, which was even more unbelievable than asking a tiger for its skin!</p><p>The Old Boatman looked at Gu Xiaosang and smiled, “It’s rare for you to have such a grand wish.”</p><p>“If fellow Daoist Maitreya wants to break free from the sea of bitterness, the celestial venerable of morals will definitely stop him. The Demon Emperor will definitely not want all the races to enter the Buddha Kingdom on Earth. Although the Green Emperor is the medicine master, he will definitely pay back for what he did in the past. Moreover, there is a fundamental conflict between his hometown of vacuum and the Buddha Kingdom on Earth. At this critical moment, what will the gold emperor think? Will he watch himself being weakened?”Gu Xiaosang said slowly, there was no pause at all, “I’m afraid that the Buddha and the ancient Buddha alone won’t be able to hold on. Releasing the Devil Buddha will only increase the enemy’s strength. In view of this, when mother returned early and tried to kill my husband and I, the Buddha didn’t use his full strength to leave me as a trigger.”</p><p>She said the last sentence with absolute certainty, as if she had witnessed Amitabha’s mercy with her own eyes.</p><p>“Although the moral almsgiver is the foundation of the survival of the world and will be weakened by the final tribulation, he has already formed the embryonic form of the dao fruit. The impact is not too great. With the supernatural power of one qi and three clarifications, it will be extremely difficult for me to block it.”The Old Boatman’s tone did not change, it was still gentle and calm.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang tilted her head slightly and suddenly smiled. “It’s not that you haven’t done your best, Buddha. It’s that you haven’t commanded the Fu Emperor!”</p><p>When she said the last two words, she suddenly raised her voice as if there was a thunderbolt out of thin air.</p><p>The Old Boatman didn’t say anything. He quietly looked at Gu Xiaosang for a while and then sighed:</p><p>“I didn’t expect you to know this secret.”</p><p>He frankly admitted that he could command Fu Huang!</p><p>“The end of the primordial era. The three emperors suffered losses. Not only Haotian and Donghuang, but Fu Huang rose up briefly in the early years of the primordial era and mysteriously disappeared. I don’t know what happened, but in the end, he ended up like Donghuang and was under your control, Buddha,”Gu Xiaosang said a few more words, to show that he was not bluffing, Gu Xiaosang continued, “And even if he was Emperor Fu, Daoist Maitreya’s situation of breaking free from the Sea of suffering was still extremely dangerous.”</p><p>“My husband was fated to be Buddha and was born in Shaolin. He also received the general outline of the Tathagata divine palm and practiced several forms of the divine palm. He was not naturally hostile to Buddhism. If Buddha could help him reach the other shore, when Daoist Maitreya attained the DAO, he would return the favor. The Celestial Master of Morals would also turn a blind eye.”</p><p>“Also, fellow Daoist Maitreya’s Buddhist kingdom on Earth is very important to Buddha, right?”</p><p>As she spoke, the water rippled, and the ferry unknowingly returned to the original shore. The Old Boatman’s bamboo hat hung low, covering his eyes and not answering.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang stood up and stepped out of the ferry. She returned the way she came, and only when the river disappeared did a faint smile reappear on her lips.</p><p>When her figure left the Dreamland, the place didn’t disappear. A bright moon rose in the heart of the river. It was flawless, sparkling, and shining.</p><p>“If you were happy to see Su Meng reach the other shore, you wouldn’t have watched one of the three corpses of the ancient Buddha die under the true martial sword.”A cold and ethereal female voice came down.</p><p>The Old Boatman smiled. “What have you thought about it, almsgiver?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
