The four sword lights were like the four pillars of heaven, falling down in glory.</p><p>The world’s carefree king and Buddha were using the word “Buddha”to protect themselves, piercing through the chaotic flow of time and looking back to the past. Suddenly, they felt a chill coming. Their hair stood on end, and they felt an intense sense of danger that they could not bear.</p><p>“Oh no!”He thought to himself. He immediately stopped the divine ability and returned to the present.</p><p>Although this danger could not change the past and could not affect the use of the great divine ability of time, unless he could exist in the past forever and was not in a hurry to return to the present world, everything in the future would be turned into a dead end.</p><p>It was self-evident which side was more important. After all, it was just a good karma that could be casually made. It was not a chance for him to become a dao. There was no need for him to risk his life for it!</p><p>The light of the glazed Buddha scattered like water. The figure of the world’s unfettered King and Buddha reappeared in front of him, and in the eyes of the Great Abhijna of the Demon King Roc.., he had only disappeared for a brief moment that could be almost ignored — this was the twist needed to perform the great abhijna of the “Three lives of Buddha”.</p><p>The sword light in front of him was criss-crossing, and the red, green, black, and white were pure and dazzling. The unfettered king and Buddha who had just returned to the world suddenly had the illusion that his golden body was pierced through and shattered.</p><p>And to an ancient Buddha like him, who had completed his good fortune, the illusion meant real danger!</p><p>“Celestial Eradication Sword Formation!”The unfettered king and Buddha could not care about anything else, six words of Buddha with golden glazed vernacular words suddenly burst out around his body. They revolved around his body and formed layers of seals, turning everything into an ocean of Buddhist light.</p><p>The sword formation was set up, and light soared into the sky. The intent of destruction and slaughter swept across the position of the world’s unfettered king and Buddha.</p><p>The barrier of Buddhist light formed by the six words of Buddha’s mantra shattered inch by inch, like a dream bubble. It was a false union, and the barrier was empty. There was no sign of the world’s unfettered king and Buddha!</p><p>Puff!</p><p>Far away from the celestial eradication sword formation, a mouthful of pure gold blood with a glazed color spurted out. The young and handsome ancient Buddha appeared.</p><p>As soon as the mouthful of Buddha’s blood touched the outside world, it immediately split and turned into one golden body after another that could not tolerate external things. There were a total of 108,000 of them. They revolved around the world’s unfettered king and Buddha, chanting Buddhist titles and condensing obsession, like an evil devil, they were even more powerful than Buddha.</p><p>The golden body of the world’s unfettered king and Buddha appeared dim. It opened its mouth and swallowed the world, sucking back all the Strange Golden Buddhas in the surroundings.</p><p>The backlash that the great divine arts practitioner had stopped, at the price of using the tathagata divine palm, “Four universes,”to avoid the immortal-slaying sword formation, had caused him great damage. He had actually developed a mental demon, spurting out blood, and had no choice but to swallow and refine it, he had temporarily lost the terrifying strength of the Sea of ao Xiao and Ku Hai.</p><p>Seeing this change, Meng Qi was in a good mood. Just as he was about to meet his senior brothers like Guangchengzi, he heard a voice coming from within the sword formation:</p><p>“Junior Brother Sect Master, go to Jianmu first. I am here to intercept all the fellow Daoists.”</p><p>Guang Chengzi’s spirit was vigorous. He actually wanted to use four people and four swords to block all the great divine arts practitioners in the world!</p><p>Meng Qi had long known the power of the celestial eradication sword formation. It was also a joint creation of the four great fortunes. It was different from the past. Upon hearing this, he let out a long laugh:</p><p>“Junior brother, we await your good news.”</p><p>The Somersault Cloud Rose and dragged out a white light. Meng Qi passed through the celestial eradication sword formation and headed toward Jianmu. He instantly disappeared into the vast darkness.</p><p>It was strange to say that Jian Mu’s clear light was located in the boundless darkness. It could reach all directions. Unless it could directly envelop it, how could the formation be able to isolate it? However, once the immortal vanquishing sword formation was formed, regardless of whether it was the unfettered kings and Buddhas of the world, ox demon king, or Roc Demon King, all they could see was a stretch of sword qi. Red and green interweaved, black and white mixed together. It was swift and fierce, without exception from any direction.</p><p>“As expected of the number one killing formation of the immemorial era.”The nine heavens mystical maiden Liu Luo sighed softly.</p><p>At this moment, streaks of light flew over from all directions. All sorts of colors flashed, and they were all different in color. They were the heavenly lord of Treasures, Empress Three Heavens, the ancient Buddha with the burning lamp, the Luo sect messenger of God, and the other demon Grand Sages.</p><p>Both sides had a clear line of sight, and Guang Chengzi spoke again:</p><p>“In this world, only the virtuous can live. Sect Master Su of the hollow jade temple has the tree of Great Dao, and he is the master of the wood. Fellow Daoists, it’s best if you don’t go against Heaven’s will and leave on your own.”</p><p>“Heaven’s will? What arrogance!”The flood dragon demon king sneered.</p><p>Guang Chengzi chuckled and said, “Fellow Daoists, if you are not willing, then charge into the immortal slaying sword array and try this archaic killing array!”</p><p>Hearing this, heavenly venerate duo Bao was immediately enraged and shouted loudly,</p><p>“Shameless!”</p><p>He spoke as if the immortal slaying sword array belonged to Your Hollow Jade Temple!</p><p>He looked around at the great divine arts practitioners and laughed out of anger, “It’s not far to build the tree. If there’s any delay, everything will be over. which fellow Daoists are willing to work with me to break this sword array that is like a tiger drawn but not like a dog?”</p><p>The incomplete celestial eradication sword array set up by the four serendipitous beings could be broken by the four perfect serendipitous beings!</p><p>“Amitabha Nanwu, I will help.”Circles of perfect Buddhist light lit up, and burning lamp pressed his palms together and answered in a low voice.</p><p>The unfettered King Buddha finally managed to tame the heart tribulation demon. The word “Buddha”appeared on his forehead again. Layers upon layers of it seemed empty, “I will help too.”</p><p>Three of the four perfect states were gathered in an instant. If Zhen Yuan Zi was here, he would not have needed to ask for help. However, the Luoism Divine envoys looked at each other and did not know where the substitute divine envoys had gone.</p><p>The demon Grand Sages were both embarrassed and angry. They wished that they could crash their heads into the celestial eradication sword formation. This was because they could not bring out an expert who could stand side by side with the heavenly lord of many treasures, the unfettered King Buddha, and the burning lamp ancient Buddha. The rest of their realms were insufficient, it was difficult to achieve a balance. Once something happened, they would be the first to bear the brunt of it. They would definitely die, which was why they refused to move forward.</p><p>It was a pity that Kong Xuan, Jiu Feng, and the other grand sages were not inferior to the ancient flaming lamp Buddha and the heavenly lord of many treasures. However, they died on the spiritual mountain. The Monkey Heaven Grand Sage, the nine spirits original sage, and the others all had their own circumstances. They could not be considered pure members of the demon race, back then, the ten thousand spirits demon race could not find a person who was at the perfect destiny state… Bull demon king gritted his teeth and was helpless.</p><p>Seeing this, Bi Xiao, who was in consort three firmament, didn’t want to waste time. She immediately said, “Senior brother duo Bao, why don’t we three sisters form the nine-bend Yellow River Formation as a way to travel together?”</p><p>Before Celestial Master duo Bao could answer, he heard the female voice of Qing Yue. “Consort three firmament, your opponent is this poor Daoist. It’s all thanks to the nine-bend Yellow River Formation that you can achieve what you have today.”</p><p>A hazy light shone, and the five colors of wisdom were bright. Holding the Great Wisdom Sword, the heavenly venerate of wisdom, Wen Shu, slowly walked out of the celestial eradication sword formation.</p><p>She had used the emptiness of Buddhism and the wisdom of the great circle mirror to walk a different path of the unity of ten thousand daos. She already had the illusory will of the infinite chaos, which was just enough to counter the Golden Dipper of the origin and the nine twists of the Yellow River Formation. Now, she was bullying Empress Sanxiao, whose strength was not what it used to be.., she had to fight against three alone!</p><p>“Amitabha Nanwu, things can not be delayed any longer.”The bright moon-like treasure light behind the ancient Buddha lit up, revealing the figure of a venerable Daoist. He held the Qiankun ruler in his hand and held the exquisite pagoda in his hand.</p><p>“Good!”The heavenly venerate of many treasures said no more. Five rolling white waves rushed out from the top of his head, which seemed to be formed by countless tiny sword Qi. On the white waves, three illusory dao flowers slowly opened up, bursting with boundless light, he was the first to enter the door of immortal execution.</p><p>The world’s carefree King Buddha, the ancient Buddha of burning lamp, and his “Past Taoist body”also turned out separately and entered the other three doors of the sword formation.</p><p>For a moment, the sword light flourished.</p><p>..</p><p>The somersault clouds rose and whistled forward. After an unknown amount of time, when the distance was shortened and he sensed that the connection formed by the “Resonance”was beginning to appear faintly, Meng Qi grabbed the karma and pierced through the layers of Void and darkness, he directly descended to the side of the tree.</p><p>The tree in front of him was towering, piercing through the void, piercing through the chaos, piercing into places that were difficult to reach. The leaves on its branches condensed an illusory dao.</p><p>Shocked by the magnificent scene, Meng Qi was slightly dazed. He immediately sobered up and took out the tree of Great Dao. He touched it and attempted to absorb it.</p><p>The water rippled, and the tree of Great Dao pierced through, but it actually failed to touch the tree!</p><p>“If this tree is destroyed, the end of the epoch will come faster. Therefore, after the Battle of the Heaven Court, the few ancient men agreed to leave a force to protect this tree.”An elegant voice came from the side, it was then that Meng Qi saw the Green Emperor.</p><p>He had been there the whole time. His expression was as normal as usual. There was no sign of any “Will of heaven”.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly and said, “It’s my fault.”</p><p>“The tree of Great Dao hasn’t grown yet. It’s not the right time yet.”The Green Emperor walked in front of Meng Qi and looked at Jian Mu with his back facing him. His voice echoed in the air, “In the last era, there was such a ‘tree of Great Dao’. Eventually, it was rooted in the blood of Haotian Emperor and Donghuang Taiyi. It absorbed all the illusory Great Dao during the end of the era and grew into the fusang ancient tree. That’s why when the tree in your hand appeared, I felt that I had seen it before and regained some of my memories.”</p><p>It turned out that the forerunner of the ancient Fusang tree was really a tree of Great Dao! Meng Qi had a feeling that it was unexpected and within reason.</p><p>Qing emperor did not look back and asked faintly,</p><p>“Do you know who planted the ancient fusang tree?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
