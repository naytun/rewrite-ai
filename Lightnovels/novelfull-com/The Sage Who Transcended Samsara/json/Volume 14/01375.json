He and Gu Xiaosang stepped into the sea of auspicious clouds together.</p><p>Did the monster of the Heavenly Dao or the Devil Buddha, Ah Nan, really dare to see him at this time?</p><p>Or was there another arrangement in the purple clouds palace, and “He”was going to make a move with the help of the Holy Man’s legacy?</p><p>Or was it just an instinctive reaction of the illusory brand?</p><p>Auspicious Qi surged and auspicious clouds spread. A palace that seemed to be wrapped in chaos appeared in front of Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang. The purple aura was hidden and the shape was ancient. The five virtues and five elements turned into divine beasts and immortal birds that surrounded them, the signboard above the door had two big words written on it with Taoist patterns:</p><p>‘purple’, ‘heaven’!</p><p>Each word contained ten thousand spells, and each word could be written with profound meaning.</p><p>At this moment, the door opened, revealing the spacious and deep inner hall. The candles were arranged in rows, never extinguished, illuminating the darkness.</p><p>The ancient immortal God with a totem on his face walked silently in front, leading Meng Qi and his wife up the stairs and into the hall. He then bowed solemnly to the front and said, “Reporting to the DAO Master, the two guests have arrived.”</p><p>Meng Qi looked up and his gaze penetrated through the layers of candlelight and darkness. At the end of the hall, the seat of Honor was empty. There was no Dao Master!</p><p>“The DAO Master is here?”He asked in a puzzled tone.</p><p>The ancient immortal God with a totem on his face looked at him in a daze. He looked at the empty futon and said, “Isn’t the Dao master sitting there? Please take your seats.”</p><p>The state of this immortal god was clearly reflected in Meng Qi’s eyes. There was no trace of lying, and there was no realm and level that could be hidden from the other side’s inspection.</p><p>“Interesting…”Meng Qi smiled and walked forward. He and Gu Xiaosang found a futon and sat down. The ancient immortal God bowed and left without stopping.</p><p>The deep hall suddenly became unusually quiet. The passage of time seemed to be slow. Except for Meng Qi and his wife, the place was empty. There was no trace of the existence of the DAO Master.</p><p>“The brand has disappeared? Can the historical process still be maintained?”Meng Qi did not have any scruples and directly spoke to Gu Xiaosang.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang sat in the lotus position, her dimples beautiful. “Isn’t this the Dao Fruit? It’s wrong as soon as you say it, and wrong as soon as you think about it. My husband must have thought that he would meet the monster of the Heavenly Dao, the Devil Buddha Ah Nan, or one of his own brand, but in the end, he guessed wrong.”</p><p>Her beautiful eyes looked around, and her words were both teasing and speculating. The last time she saw the Buddha’s imprints in the Netherworld, nothing similar had happened.</p><p>Of course, her husband didn’t know anything that time, so he had no way to guess.</p><p>Meng Qi seemed to be thinking about something, and he smiled leisurely. “In that case, I’ll go and ask the other fellow Daoists first.”</p><p>The ancient crown on his head arrived, and a gust of clear air rushed out of his Niwan Palace, turning into a white-clothed novice monk with red lips and white teeth, Zhending. Stepping on glass, lotus flowers grew with each step, and he escaped from the purple clouds palace — this was the past era, if one did not reach the other side, they would be restrained and repelled by history. Moreover, because they were too far away from the current node, the repelling force was extremely strong. If one did not send out Zhending Tathagata, the rest would be thrown back to the “Present”in a few breaths.</p><p>The true rulai Buddha’s light swirled around, and in a flash, he appeared in the Western Paradise. He saw Amitabha, who looked like he was in a deep sleep, receiving Buddha from a few eras ago!</p><p>After both parties greeted each other, Amitabha formed a hand seal on his knees and made a sign that he was about to enlighten all living beings:</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, are you from the Purple Clouds Palace?”</p><p>“Of course.”The true rulai Meng Qi nodded with a smile. “I am here to ask you, fellow Daoist, who is the other product of the Venerable Daoist? Is He a devil Buddha?”</p><p>Amitabha’s voice was loud and solemn. “Yes, yes, yes. You are wrong about this. The one that the holy man slashed out in the era before he attained Dao was Old Lord Huang.”</p><p>“Old Lord Huang?”Meng Qi knew this name because it was mentioned in some ancient books on Earth. It seemed to be the influence of the remnant marks in heaven and earth. However, he did not know that it was the product of the holy man.</p><p>“In the era before you, Haotian, the immortal world was indistinguishable from the netherworld. It was mixed with the real world. Humans, gods, ghosts, demons, demons, and immortals were mixed together. At that time, the leader of the five Celestial Emperors was Old Lord Huang. Actually, you would not be unfamiliar with him. You might even be familiar with him,”Amitabha said about a certain era in the immemorial era that Meng Qi had yet to trace back to.</p><p>“Familiar with him?”As a person from the other shore, even if he did not know about that period of history, he could understand it at a little bit. After hearing Amitabha’s words, Meng Qi roughly knew who it was. He smiled and said, “Old Lord Huang, is the tree of Great Dao the thing that became the Dao?”</p><p>Amitabha nodded slightly. “The tree of the Great Dao accompanied the birth of Lord Huang. It was suspected that the blood and heart of the holy man was condensed together. At that time, the real world was the immortal realm and also the netherworld. The Heaven and earth were dim and dark like the Yin Earth. Immortals, demons, ghosts, and devils ran rampant. In the center, there was this tree of the Great Dao. It was shaped like a peach tree. It could swallow the Great Dao, grow corresponding leaves, and become a deity who held such authority. Therefore, ghosts and gods were repelled and feared very much. It was the object of Lord Huang’s enlightenment. At the end of that era, Lord Huang inevitably fell. A Monster of the Heavenly Dao was born from his molt. A bit of incomplete spiritual light was reincarnated into the next era and became the one that fellow Daoist knew. When he reached the other side, the holy man transcended from then on.”</p><p>“Donghuang Taiyi,”Meng Qi said with certainty and calmness. In the world with the Celestial Karma map, Donghuang Taiyi was also known as the “Middle Yellow Taiyi.”The middle yellow was also known as the Central Celestial Emperor, Old Lord Huang, the Heaven was dead, and the Yellow Heaven was standing!</p><p>No wonder he knew all the secrets of the monster of Heavenly Dao. He could even fuse with it and escape the fate of being killed by the hands of the heavenly god of Haotian. At that time, the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning and the others were still observing the way of the holy man’s transcendence, they did not know enough about the changes made by reducing the number of empty objects, so it was quite possible that they could be fooled.</p><p>The Devil Buddha knew the whereabouts of Earth and could find the holy man’s Crossing World Treasure raft because of Donghuang Taiyi who had fused with the monster of Heavenly Dao.</p><p>The problem went back to the beginning. At that time, the Devil Buddha was only a creator-level supernatural power. How could he control the monster of Heavenly Dao? Who was the enemy that he feared at all times? What benefits did he gain from his repeated betrayals? What purpose did he want to achieve?</p><p>Amitabha said with a compassionate face,</p><p>“Good, good, good.”</p><p>“At that time, the tree of Great Dao withered with the death of Lord Huang, leaving behind two saplings. One of them disappeared mysteriously. Later, the DAO Master gave it to fellow Daoist Zhenwu and got your fate. The other one was reincarnated with his incomplete spiritual light and died in the hands of fellow Daoist Haotian. It was planted at the end of the East Sea and became the ancient tree of Fusang today.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded his head thoughtfully. It was only today that he finally understood the origins of the tree of Great Dao and the Fusang ancient tree.</p><p>Normally speaking, from the start of an era, there would naturally be something similar to the construction tree being born, supporting the immortal realms, the nine underworld and the myriad worlds. When the era was about to end.., something similar to the construction tree would absorb all the Great Dao in the world and bear a fruit. After that, it would wither and collapse, bringing about the destruction of an era. This fruit might be the source of the construction tree in the next era.</p><p>This era was the end of the apocalypse. The implication was that after the tree collapsed and died, because the fruit was taken away by Buddha, or for other reasons, there would be no more similar things. There would be no next era, and it would be completely dead, meng Qi was inclined to the latter. Otherwise, Buddha would not have taken away the tree of the tree of the Great Dao so easily.</p><p>The tree of the Great Dao and the ancient fusang tree were external things. Perhaps they could replace the tree of the tree of the Great Dao to support the next era. That was why Haotian God planted the ancient tree and tried to replace the tree of the peach tree with the tree of the peach tree. The Golden Emperor and the others called the tree of the great dao the “Era.”.</p><p>They represented the hope of the next era!</p><p>And all of this started with the first Transcendent Dao Master!</p><p>“I see. Thank you, fellow Daoist.”Zhending Tathagata put his palms together and disappeared into the Elysium Realm. He turned into a gust of fresh air and returned to Meng Qi’s Niwan Palace.</p><p>He smiled at Gu Xiaosang and said, “The root of the Great Dao in Donghuang’s flesh and blood was the seven heaven-severing swords. It’s a pity that the quantity and quality of the refinement was limited. Otherwise, I would have been able to use this to slash out ‘Celestial Master Su Meng’.”</p><p>“It turns out that the other product of the DAO Master’s minimization is Donghuang Taiyi. No wonder the Devil Buddha knows so much.”Gu Xiaosang was very smart. She knew what it meant when she heard the melody.</p><p>At this moment, the illusory river of time around them appeared. Meng Qi said leisurely, “Let’s go back to the current node in the purple clouds palace and see where its ‘Body’is now. Can we find anything else?”</p><p>Time flew by quickly. Meng Qi saw the Dao master servant pass away. He saw a child wearing a turtle-snake robe. He had delicate features and was short and childish, he saw all the changes in the purple clouds palace over the past few eras, but he did not see the DAO Master’s brand.</p><p>After an unknown period of time, the river of time flowed slowly. The two of them returned to the current node on Earth, and the purple clouds palace had entered true chaos.</p><p>In the outside world, the reincarnation of the water ancestor, Tan Ping, had finally obtained his dharma body. He opened another secret treasure and found a treasure. He was prepared to use this to explore the relic of the Dao master hidden in the Chaos!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
