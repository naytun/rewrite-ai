He looked past the specks of yin fire around him to the deepest part of the pitch-black prison. He saw that it was taking shape, red, gold, orange, green, and other colors seemed to fly out from the bottom.</p><p>“What are you disturbing?”He pondered for a moment and asked straightforwardly.</p><p>The Vague Dao pattern on Cheng Tang’s glabella was prominent. His eyes revealed a dignified look, which contained a fierce light. He said in a low and hoarse voice,</p><p>“It has nothing to do with you. Retreat quickly, or don’t blame me for being Merciless.”</p><p>His voice was not loud, like the muffled sound of thunder, but it seemed to ring directly in the hearts of Meng Qi and Liu Luo. They could not help but feel a sense of subservience and submission. Even the spiritual light of their natures was intimidated and wavered, their control over the true body of dao body was suddenly weakened.</p><p>To be able to establish Yin Shang, resist the heaven, and call himself emperor, even though Cheng Tang had been suppressed for hundreds of thousands of years, there was still a bit of his former strength and accumulated imperial qi. When he was angry, the Heaven and earth moved, and when he shouted, all living things bowed down!</p><p>Facing this familiar powerful enemy, the nine heavens mystical maiden Liu Luo was unusually cautious. Just as she was about to secretly communicate with Meng Qi, she heard him say in a clear voice,</p><p>“Ever since the Shang dynasty of the Zhou dynasty, it has been an eternity. The Imperial Emperor has been imprisoned here, and without any conditions, he has fallen into a deep sleep or used other methods to avoid being washed away. I’m afraid that he has already died of old age and his true spirit has dissipated. Currently, he is still able to talk to a certain someone and retain a certain level of strength. This makes one have no choice but to guess that the thing at the bottom of the immortal realm’s heavenly prison is related to reincarnation.”</p><p>Only after experiencing reincarnation would it be possible for him to survive until now and regain control of the body of the Ghost Emperor!</p><p>As soon as the word “Reincarnation”left his mouth, Cheng Tang was instantly enraged:</p><p>“Damn it!”</p><p>“It’s not like the dead souls under my command don’t have powerful divine abilities. Don’t be so arrogant!”</p><p>The Emperor’s Qi surged and surged like the tides of the universe, forming an ancient imperial cauldron that landed on Meng Qi’s head. It wanted to suppress his fate and weaken the spiritual light of his nature. The surroundings turned into the yin world, and the light virtue condensed to form a flag, it swept forward and destroyed everything.</p><p>“The emperor’s Cauldron of Fate! The Yin virtue accumulated throughout the ages!”Liu Luo’s expression changed slightly when he saw this scene. His expression was quite grave.</p><p>He did not expect that after the Emperor Cheng Tang was imprisoned here for an eternity, he could still condense the emperor’s cauldron of fate based on the Yin Shang dynasty and gather the virtue accumulated after the creation of the Yin World!</p><p>Although it was definitely not as good as when it was at its peak, it was not to be underestimated. The remnant “Cauldron”of the dynasty that was called the emperor was enough to suppress the fate of most venerables. It made them feel as if they were trapped in a killing calamity. They had their own wisdom and everything was not going smoothly, the path was not clear and they were gradually approaching the end of the road. The Eternal Yin virtue could not only protect themselves from the tribulation, but it could also be reversed to become one of the five grandmasters, eliminating all things. It was extremely powerful!</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Red light rose up, and Sword Qi soared into the sky. Liu Luo did not dare to be negligent. The true form of the fairy maiden of the nine heavens appeared amidst the immortal qi. The hazy clear light enveloped the outside, making people unable to see it clearly, but they also felt that it was incomparably beautiful.</p><p>Right at this moment, facing the legendary Emperor of the ancient mythological era, facing the main character of the past who had experienced ups and downs in his life, Meng Qi did not advance. Instead, he retreated. Facing the pale white flag, he took a step forward.</p><p>With this step, the heaven and earth changed. The Yin world shook, and the Emperor’s Qi swayed. Meng Qi’s body rapidly expanded, turning into a faint golden giant with the heavens above his head and the nine Netherworlds beneath his feet. He extended his right hand, and darkness appeared in his palm. He was muddle-headed.., there seemed to be an additional strange point that was neither up nor down, left or right, causing the surrounding to lose its color. Then, he pressed down on the emperor’s cauldron of fate that was descending in mid-air.</p><p>As soon as the two came into contact, the pitch-black darkness seemed to have spread. The ancient and solemn emperor’s cauldron let out a low cry and lost its suppressive intent. It disintegrated inch by inch in the dim light of chaos, returning to its original state.</p><p>“Limitless seal!”Ghost Emperor Cheng Tang cried out involuntarily.</p><p>He was about to escape when he saw the right palm that was glowing with dim light continue to descend. The will of chaos spread out, and the flag formed by the Pale Yin virtue swayed slightly before fusing into it and completely disappearing without a trace.</p><p>“No!”</p><p>Cheng Tang cried out in fear. He turned around and fled, trying to jump out of the area where Meng Qi’s right palm was pressing down. However, he found that he was still far away after a moment. He did not know when he had mixed up the direction and had been circling in the same place!</p><p>Darkness spread and covered Cheng Tang. The little yin flames were immediately extinguished, and wisps of ghostly qi faded away.</p><p>“The unbounded chaos that has condensed into an illusory great dao is so powerful…”the eyes of the nine heavens mystical maiden Liu Luo flickered slightly as she watched.</p><p>Even in the ancient mythological era, there was not a single person who could sublimate the unbounded chaos into an illusory great dao in the realm of creation. It was not because Liu Luo’s knowledge was shallow!</p><p>— the primordial beginning Celestial Master was born on the other shore. The boundless Chaos Dao had already become an illusory fruit, making it impossible for people to guess what was going on in the destiny realm. The Golden Emperor cut it off and turned into a lifeless old mother. When he appeared in front of the world, he was comparable to Emperor Qing, when he was close to the other shore, the boundless Chaos Dao had almost condensed into an illusory dao fruit. As for Yang Jian, he had been mysterious ever since the Battle of the Divine Ascension. He did not listen to the instructions and did not make many moves. When did he achieve the Destiny Realm, no one outside the hollow jade temple knew if there was an illusory path of the infinite chaos. As for Sun Wukong, although he cultivated the eight-nine arcane art and had many changes, it was clear that he did not walk the path of the infinite chaos.</p><p>Until today, the infinite seal had displayed its supreme divine might in the destiny realm!</p><p>Even though Cheng Tang had been suppressed for eternity and had been reincarnated, his powers were not as great as when he was at his peak. With one strike, he could destroy the Destiny Imperial Cauldron and the body of the ghost god that was the body of the Eternal Yin. He could return to his original state, it was enough to make every great divine arts practitioner give him a sidelong glance!</p><p>Just as Meng Qi was about to retract his right palm and raise his sleeves to capture Cheng Tang alive, his true spirit exploded and disintegrated on its own. It was as if he had experienced the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p>“What a pity…”Meng Qi shook his head. He did not expect that the reincarnation here seemed to be abnormal.</p><p>After saying that, he stopped the heavenly transformation and concealed his aura. He then walked towards the place where the multi-colored lights rose up, he then asked thoughtfully, “Just now, the empress mentioned many things related to the Battle of the heavenly monarch, but she seems to have left out a certain innate god that is extremely important in the ancient times?”</p><p>When it came to the mythological era, this god was a topic that could not be avoided!</p><p>“You Mean Empress Hou Tu?”Liu Luo suddenly sighed, “She is the Qi of the Earth in the real world. She is benevolent and wise. She has always pitied all living beings and protected all the worlds. Although she has great authority and strength, she has never participated in the battle for the heavenly monarch throne. She is respected by all the forces.”</p><p>“At that time, the turbid qi dropped and sank into the nine remoteness. Luo Feng’s world, black prison’s world, and the river of the yellow springs were the source of the death qi. The beginning of ghosts and creatures. If the living beings were obsessed with these places, they could not get rid of their resentment. After they sensed these places, they could turn into ghosts or zombies and lose all their memories. The rest of the living beings would disappear into the heaven and earth and return to nature. There was no such thing as reincarnation. Later, the living beings learned how to offer incense offerings. They could help these persistent ghosts and creatures to form their yin bodies, become ghosts and deities, recover their memories, and form a yin land that belonged to each family</p><p>“As for someone as ambitious as Cheng Tang, he wanted to create his own world of Yin. He wanted to fuse this world of yin and form a Yin Cao. Then, he wanted to connect with Luo Feng, black prison, and the other worlds of the nine underworld to complete the true underworld.”</p><p>Meng Qi was puzzled. “Did Empress Hou tu reach the other shore at that time?”</p><p>Liu Luo shook his head. “No. When the Battle of Ascension ended and the heavenly emperor was in seclusion in the hall of the past, preparing to digest his gains and open the highest level of the nine heavens in one fell swoop, Empress Hou tu suddenly came and paid a secret visit. After that, she left the immortal world and returned to the Earth. This shocked us and made us start to break free from the sea of bitterness. Unknowingly, she had reached such a stage, even surpassing the Heavenly Emperor!”</p><p>“When reaching the other side of the DAO, there will be obstacles. At the critical moment, Empress Hou Tu made a big wish. She wanted to use her illusory dao fruit as the material, her body as the cauldron, and the world of nine remoteness such as Luo Feng and black prison as the fire to forge a divine weapon and magical treasure that could allow living beings to reincarnate. With this, she successfully landed on the shore, but she also lost her life and turned into a mysterious and strange reincarnation seal… she actually planned to sacrifice herself…”</p><p>The mystical maiden of the nine heavens had used a lot of “Jing”words when she talked about the matter of the latter earth. It was evident that she still could not believe it today.</p><p>“After the reincarnation seal was born, who had it fallen into the hands of in the first place?”Meng Qi asked this crucial detail.</p><p>Liu Luo smiled bitterly and said, “The reincarnation seal disappeared without a trace as soon as it appeared. It was also difficult for the big shots to trace it back. When it reappeared, it was already the battle that destroyed the Spirit Mountain. In short, after Empress Hou tu transformed into this seal, there was reincarnation in the world. The reincarnated person had three souls to replace one.”</p><p>As they spoke, the two of them had already arrived at the deepest part of the sky prison that was soaring with various colored lights. Two stone slabs were inlaid on the ground, and they were covered with vague dao patterns, like an ancient door.</p><p>“Do you really intend to explore this place? Aren’t you afraid of disturbing some terrifying thing?”Liuluo asked solemnly again.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled slightly and said,</p><p>“When robbery was about to self-prove the legend before the calamity, I once felt satisfied and acted in a prudent manner. This was not wrong, but one thing after another began to go against my will, and it began to exceed the scope of my body’s response. It made people feel pain and helplessness, and I finally understood one thing. There was no mistake in being prudent. Under the background of the end of the calamity, the end of the era, and the struggle on the other shore, it was difficult to fight for a slim chance of survival without taking some risks</p><p>“I’d rather take a risk today. Even if I die here, I don’t want to regret not putting in more effort in the past when I can’t do anything in the future!”</p><p>After saying that, he reached out his right hand and pressed on the two stone doors. The glazed lamp in his eyes shone as he deduced all sorts of details and forbidden techniques.</p><p>Liu Luo looked at him. In an instant, he seemed to see Meng Qi from a long time ago. He saw a sharp blade that had been sealed for a long time finally unsheathed, shining with a cold light.</p><p>The knife, fierce forward, Invincible!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
