He could no longer sense the outside world. All he could hear was the sound of his heart beating like a drum. It sounded distant, but it was actually close. At first, he felt that it was his, but then he came to a realization, it belonged to another creature, and it was in his body!</p><p>Dong, Dong, Dong!</p><p>As soon as this realization surfaced, he immediately felt a tyrannical and demonic power suddenly expand. It shattered the embryonic form of the multiverse in his body, dyeing his flesh and blood with other wills. In a short moment.., all the defenses and tyrannical powers were broken, and his divine sense could no longer detect the existence of his body. The Sea of consciousness, which contained bits of golden scale-like memory fragments, surged violently without any wind or waves, numerous figures in black robes and crowns appeared one after another, condensing into a dark-red chaotic vortex that claimed this world for its own.</p><p>Meng Qi’s consciousness gradually blurred, and in what remained of his vision, the quiet sea of consciousness rapidly turned dark-red from all directions to the center. All the memory fragments retreated one after another, and in the end, they were squeezed into a small golden ball that was as clear as glass.</p><p>His spiritual sense tried its best to perform the infinite seal, the heaven-opening seal, the Universal Dao, the Supreme Self, and other supernatural abilities, but they were all like thin paper. Under the terrifying dormitory of the remaining flesh and blood of Donghuang, they collapsed one after another, and it was difficult to protect them, the small golden ball was soon dyed dark red as well. Chaos appeared, and it mutated crazily.</p><p>Ah!</p><p>A scream exploded. The supreme infinite primordial Shi Qingyun, which had enveloped Meng Qi, was pierced through by blood vessels that were dark red and nearly black. It turned into smoke and clouds, revealing his current appearance: the blood vessels on the surface of his skin were all protruding, from time to time, he would stretch out and shrink back, as if he had a life of his own. A face would protrude out of every orifice. It was the corresponding image of him and me. At this moment, “They”were all ferocious and crazy, it made Meng Qi feel like the gathering of countless evil ghosts and corpses. His eyes, which were filled with determination, were already dark red. They were filled with chaotic vortexes, and he had lost all reason and all wisdom.</p><p>Even though the founder of the Void Mountain sect, Shechen, had attained perfection in the destiny realm, he had still turned into a monster even after the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure had cut off most of the flesh and blood of Donghuang. He could only wake up from time to time, let alone Meng Qi?</p><p>At this moment, a bit of his innate spiritual light turned into an incomplete bright moon that hung in his Niwan Palace. It seemed to be located at an infinite height. The dark red tide below continued to rise crazily, wanting to completely submerge his last bit of self. Suddenly.., a phantom image appeared in the clear light of the Moon. It was a “Jade disc”that was covered in clear light!</p><p>It was Meng Qi’s harvest from refining the jade disc of destiny that corresponded to the remnant of Donghuang’s myriad realms. Only by controlling the remnant of his spiritual nature could he completely control his flesh and blood!</p><p>The phantom image of the “Jade disc of destiny”slowly rotated and scattered down rays of light. The dark red tide paused for a moment as if it was affected, and there was an intense internal struggle.</p><p>However, in just an instant, it continued to rise. It was slower than before, but it was equally determined.</p><p>At this moment, a small, translucent, and lively tree appeared beside the illusory image of the jade disc of fortune. There were nine branches and nine leaves on each branch. As it swayed, there seemed to be a melodious voice of the Great Dao coming from it, it was guarding the Dao Yi glass lamp behind it that was shining with black and white flowing light.</p><p>The tree of Great Dao!</p><p>The three of them worked together and cast a layer of clear light outside of the incomplete moon-like spiritual light of nature, dissipating a lot of the dark red tide’s craziness. The tide came and went, but it was always just a hair’s breadth away from being able to enter.</p><p>In the real world, the DAO crown on Meng Qi’s head was reduced to ashes. His black hair fluttered and turned into long snakes that wriggled crazily and extended into the void, seemingly endless.</p><p>Deep within the great snowmountain, Wang Siyuan sensed something and suddenly let out a long sigh:</p><p>“So that’s how it is…”</p><p>“It’s a pity that time doesn’t wait for me. In a few more years, I might be able to lend him a hand…”</p><p>In the boundless pure land, the twenty-four Buddhist lights behind the ancient Buddha’s head were stacked on top of each other, surrounding the ancient glass cup. He was focused on observing the situation of the hollow jade temple on Mount Kunlun, waiting for an opportunity.</p><p>When he saw Meng Qi recklessly sucking the flesh and blood of Donghuang into his body, he was slightly moved, but he quickly calmed down. He was neither frightened nor afraid, neither angry nor happy. Whether it was Su Meng or the remnant spirit of Donghuang that had been possessed, as long as it was erased by his mother.., he would be able to condense the “Dao one seal”again.</p><p>As this thought flashed through his mind, the voice of the Devil Buddha, Ah Nan, suddenly rang in his ears:</p><p>“Be careful.”</p><p>Before he could finish his words, long black snakes appeared in front of burning lamp. He did not know what they were sensing, but they silently penetrated the layers of barriers of the pure land Buddhist kingdom and “Bit”him.</p><p>The Buddha’s light flashed, and the glazed lamp spun. The strange black snakes broke into two and landed beside the pool of Merit. They wriggled slightly and turned into black broken hair.</p><p>“Instinctively, I want to swallow the Great Dao of karma that I have formed…”the ancient Buddha with the burning lamp’s expression became more and more solemn.</p><p>This monster was really crazy and not easy to deal with!</p><p>Meng Qi was filled with a brutal and violent consciousness. Only the last subtle thought allowed him to not destroy everything around him wantonly. It was as if there was something important to protect, and instinctively, he sensed danger, he knew that an enemy that he had to get rid of was about to arrive.</p><p>His black hair flew in the air, and his blood vessels protruded out. He reached out his right hand and grabbed the absolute blade.</p><p>“Go to hell!”</p><p>He shouted crazily, and the dark red in his eyes became even more ferocious and chaotic.</p><p>The purple light soared, and the world became a sea of lightning. Silver, white, green, and gold, all kinds of colors. Some were the collision of yin and yang, some were the conversion of life and death, and some were the stimulation of good and evil. The path of lightning was definitely not lightning!</p><p>The bolts of lightning gathered and condensed into dao patterns. Like a tide, they surged toward the horizon. The place was originally normal, but suddenly, a perfect and flawless moon rose, and the clear light suppressed the lightning, a flawless white finger poked out from the middle. The tip was dark, and even time vanished into nothingness.</p><p>Without a sound, the sea of lightning collapsed and was swallowed by the darkness. The lightning and many dao patterns in the sky returned to a heavy purple long saber, and in exchange, the pure white holy finger paused for a short while.</p><p>Meng Qi, who had become a monster, and the absolute sword, which had completely awoken, could only shake old mother Wusheng a little. He was at an absolute disadvantage!</p><p>At this moment, Gu Xiaosang approached Meng Qi. She was not afraid of his brutality and cruelty at all. She transmitted her voice into his ear:</p><p>“Take back the past and go to the ninth Netherworld!”</p><p>Go to the ninth Netherworld! Meng Qi’s eyes were dark red, and he had the urge to tear everything apart. However, after hearing this, he vaguely felt that he did not want to hurt the other party, and he should do as he was told.</p><p>“Kill!”</p><p>He roared again, and the light from his blade grew crazily. This time, it did not fill heaven and earth. Instead, it penetrated through space and time and went up the illusory river, connecting with Meng Qi before he devoured Donghuang’s flesh and blood, it connected with Meng Qi, who had entered the highest level of the immortal world, with Meng Qi, who had proven himself to be the only Meng Qi, with Meng Qi, who had severed the past and the afterlife, with Meng Qi, who was struggling bitterly in the six paths, and with Meng Qi, who had just entered Shaolin, it had extended all the way to earth… at the same time, he had also communicated with Gu Xiaosang, who had gone through all the moments in the past.</p><p>At this moment, the full moon hanging in the sky once again pointed out a finger. It was as white as jade, slender and holy. It made the darkness beyond the clear radiance seem to appear in the present and the past at the same time.</p><p>The primordial Qi of the Supreme Infinity rushed out of the top of Meng Qi’s head once again after he had lost his intelligence. It was deeper and more terrifying than before. It was as if all the dangers and all the mysterious chaos were hidden in it. Then, it flew into the absolute blade.</p><p>The light of the blade suddenly retracted, and every meng qi and Gu Xiaosang who had passed by curled up. Not only did they dodge the finger of the metal emperor, but they also condensed in front of them and turned into a dark ball full of human figures, leaving only a mark in history.</p><p>The dark ball could not last long. Seeing that it was about to collapse and return to its original state, the absolute blade suddenly rose up and blocked another finger of Wu Sheng’s mother. Then, with the help of the momentum of the collapse, it dragged the monster Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang into the underworld!</p><p>The Black Sun was hanging high in the sky, and the demonic energy around them was boiling. The two appeared at the highest level of the underworld. The dark sphere could no longer hold on and silently collapsed. Human figures “Converged”into the river of time in the underworld, which was cut off by the power of the absolute blade, they could not return to the real world.</p><p>The space-time at the highest level separated layer by layer, and all the barriers collapsed. The white and flawless finger came one after another, bringing about the ultimate doomsday. At this moment, even if there was no reason and no other thoughts.., the monster Meng Qi also felt that his entire body was empty. He was close to losing his strength. However, the nine Netherworld Demonic Qi continued to pour in and nourish him crazily.</p><p>The Golden Emperor’s attack arrived in an instant. Suddenly, a figure appeared in front of him. It was a dark violent ape that could hold up the sky and the Earth!</p><p>Monkey King!</p><p>“The old Lord asked me to wait here. I’ll Lend You My Ultimate Saber.”The violent ape grinned.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
