The crack was hard to remove</p><p>Nezha did not bind the heaven-turning silk nor did he hang the heaven and earth ring. He only held the fire spear in his hand and stood at the entrance of the cave abode of the bodhisattva of joy with a gloomy face. There was a dark fire in his eyes, burning with hatred and impulse, but there was also lingering hesitation and struggle.</p><p>Seeing that it was him, Bull Demon King secretly breathed a sigh of relief and said in a low voice,</p><p>“I know that you have a deep relationship with Daoist Taiyi, but I can’t be blamed for his death. The main reason is that his cultivation has stagnated and he can’t make a breakthrough. He has tasted all the life-prolonging pills before he passed away. Even without that serious injury, it can’t change this fact. At most, he can live for another hundred years.”</p><p>“Don’t you see that your sect master, Celestial Master Su, didn’t try to resurrect him?”</p><p>Fortunately, it was this matter. If bodhisattva joyfully handed him over to the celestial emperor, the consequences would be unimaginable. He might not even have the chance to resurrect the Empress!</p><p>Nezha’s eyes were filled with complicated emotions. His heart was like a whirlpool, but his feet took a step forward with great difficulty. He stepped into the cave abode as if he was following some kind of instinct.</p><p>Seeing this situation, bull demon king’s optimism immediately disappeared. His face became heavy, and there was a hint of fear:</p><p>“Nezha, you have to think clearly. Even if there is a heavenly emperor hiding the changes, it is impossible to hide it from the demon empress and Celestial Master Su. So what if you succeed? When the time comes, they will reverse time and resurrect me. What you have done is not only useless, but also responsible!”</p><p>He was not afraid of Nezha making a move, but he was afraid that after his death, there would be some inexplicable changes, making resurrection an extravagant hope.</p><p>The Bodhisattva of joy covered her mouth and laughed lightly, as if she was mocking bull demon king for saying that he was a peerless hero, but in reality, he was still afraid of death. At the same time, she quickly left the cave dwelling and escaped into the Sea of stars, disappearing without a trace.</p><p>The dark fire in Nezha’s eyes grew heavier and heavier, almost to the point of solidifying. He shook the fire spear in his hand and slowly took a step forward. His voice was hollow, as if it came from outer space:</p><p>“I know that this is meaningless</p><p>“I also know that the main reason for master’s complete death is not you. But in the past, when I killed Shiji’s disciple by mistake and convulsed the third Prince of the Eastern Sea Dragon King, it was meaningless for master to protect me when I acted recklessly. It also could not change the ending of my death and my dao vanishing. I could only resurrect with the help of the green lotus seed of chaos. But he still did it. Today, he let me see the glory of the guy who once severely injured him and indirectly caused his death in front of me. Just because there is no meaning in giving up revenge</p><p>“Change history and you can pretend that nothing happened? Then why can’t I calm down?”</p><p>The scenes of his godhood flashed across his mind. His biological father treated him like an old shoe, wishing that he could die completely. Only his master protected him from the beginning.</p><p>“Anyway, I’ve always been a bastard. At worst, I’ll just pay with my life!”</p><p>Nezha shouted in a low voice. He shook the tip of the fire spear and stabbed it at Bull Demon King’s glabella. He was determined and did not hesitate at all.</p><p>“You…”bull demon king had only uttered one word when he felt a sharp pain in his glabella. It was a pain and fear that he had never experienced before.</p><p>His vision quickly turned dark. His body burst into invisible flames and turned into ashes inch by inch. The fear and despair at the moment of his death were deeply planted in his heart. Then, everything returned to nothingness. There was no thought, no feeling.</p><p>Nezha put away his spear, and two streams of tears hung on his delicate face. He leaped and fled to the hollow jade temple. He wanted to apologize to the sect master.</p><p>..</p><p>One day ago, Demon Ox was thinking about how to enjoy himself after the ceremony. Suddenly, he saw the Fox Qing Qiu set up a fragrance and descended at his door.</p><p>“The Empress has ordered to summon the Ping Tian Grand Sage to the demon Emperor Hall,”Qing Qiu said with a smile.</p><p>Her every frown and smile was charming, as if they were natural. Even if there were no distracting thoughts in her mind, her every move was still mesmerizing. Demon Ox’s heart trembled as he looked at her. He could not help but swallow his saliva before he accepted the order and rushed to the Demon Emperor Hall.</p><p>After entering the inner hall, he looked at her nose and looked at her heart. He said respectfully, “What do you need me to do for you, Empress?”</p><p>“You have a killing calamity. Sit here quietly for a day to resolve it.”The Demon Emperor’s voice came from behind the curtains. It was neither angry nor happy.</p><p>Killing Calamity? Bull Demon King was shocked. He knew that the demon Emperor would not lie to him about such things. He sat down in a hurry and did not dare to move even a little. He stayed until the current node.</p><p>At this time, another piece of history turned into a memory and appeared in his mind. The fear, despair, and pain were vivid in his mind.</p><p>“Damn Heavenly Emperor! Damn Joy! Damn Nezha!”He lost his composure and cursed through gritted teeth.</p><p>Fortunately, he had the protection of the Empress. Otherwise, he would not have a second chance!</p><p>Thinking of this, Bull Demon King suddenly stood up and said in a mournful voice,</p><p>“Empress, you have to help me, Old Bull!”</p><p>The Heavenly Emperor was a big figure on the other side. Without preparation, the demon Empress did not dare to directly attack him. The Bodhisattva of Joy had asked him to protect her, so she had to wait for an opportunity. However, Nezha had destroyed the alliance between the Yuxu faction and the demon race and killed her once.., she had to punish him, right?</p><p>“The celestial emperor is scheming openly. Don’t jump into the trap yourself.”The curtains moved slightly, and the monster emperor said lightly, “Let Daoist su Meng deal with Nezha.”</p><p>Bull Demon King was unwilling, but seeing that the monster emperor had made up his mind, he did not dare to say anything. He bowed and said,</p><p>“Then I hope that Celestial Master Su will punish him impartially.”</p><p>He took his leave and left the Monster Emperor Palace. It was as if nothing had happened, but whenever he thought of the pain, despair, and darkness before his death, he could not help but shudder and Gnash his teeth.</p><p>At this moment, all the monster saint powerhouses knew about this matter. They all had different expressions, but they all focused their attention on the hollow jade temple and waited for the punishment.</p><p>..</p><p>Inside the hollow jade temple, Nezha was kneeling in the middle of the hall. In front of him, there was a round light hanging high in the sky, bright and clear.</p><p>“Please punish your disciple, uncle-master,”he said calmly.</p><p>Under the round light, his figure blurred. Meng Qi looked at him and said,</p><p>“Punish Me? What crime did you commit?”</p><p>“Is our hollow jade temple not allowed to avenge my master?”</p><p>Nezha was surprised at first, but then his heart warmed up. His eyes reddened and he choked, “I’m Afraid I’ll ruin your big plan, Uncle Master.”</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said, “I treat the demi-humans and the human society equally, but that doesn’t mean that I have to interfere with personal grudges. Even within the human race, there is no way to prohibit conflicts unless they are in the land of Buddha or the home of vacuum. In short, I only want to act according to my heart, and I will try my best to fight for it on this basis.”</p><p>Nezha immediately grinned:</p><p>“When I saw uncle-master slash at the Golden Emperor, I was so impressed.”</p><p>When he left the hollow jade temple safely and returned to his cave abode, the demi-human experts’faces darkened.</p><p>Meng Qi sat quietly in the chaos and suddenly sighed.</p><p>..</p><p>At the top of the pitch-black peak in the netherworld.</p><p>The Devil Buddha, Ah Nan, looked into the distance with a smile and at Han Guang, who was hiding somewhere, he transmitted his voice, “Su Mengcheng is in his heart, so naturally, he will be limited by this. We do not seek to stir up the situation immediately, we only want to dig out the pus and bury the cracks. At the critical moment, we will definitely be able to play a role.”</p><p>“Moreover, after this incident, the knot in Bull Demon King’s heart will be hard to remove, and the fear will be hard to forget. I am confident that I can secretly lead him to fall.”</p><p>The most important thing in this operation was to focus the gazes of the other people on the other shore on the secret relationship between him and the heavenly emperor. Coupled with the tacit understanding between the Golden Emperor and the Heavenly Emperor on the god Ascension Board, it was enough to cover up other things, there was no need to explain this to Han Guang.</p><p>Han guang listened thoughtfully and said with emotion, “As expected of the leader of the evil demons in the world. No wonder the heavenly emperor is willing to temporarily let go of the past enmity.”</p><p>“But he may very well turn against us at the critical moment,”the Devil Buddha sneered. “That’s why I kept you and nurtured you, so that I could suppress his occasional needs in the future.”</p><p>He spoke frankly, as if he was not worried about Han Guang’s betrayal at all.</p><p>Han Guang Thought for a moment and suddenly said, “I have one more thing to ask.”</p><p>“What is it?”The Devil Buddha had a faint smile on his face.</p><p>“The Golden Emperor said that after the end of the ancient era, the primordial Lord of Heaven and the Heavenly Lord of Lingbao were both played by him, and his feet were suppressed in the middle ancient era. Under the Bodhi magical tree, there was a layer of three-treasure ruyi seal. was this really the work of the primordial Lord of Heaven, or was the golden emperor pretending? And how did he get past the arrangement of the Bodhi magical tree?”Han Guang had a very deep impression of this matter.</p><p>The Devil Buddha was silent for a moment before he suddenly let out a laugh:</p><p>“Of course it’s the real primordial Lord of Heaven!”</p><p>“Besides, besides the Buddha who defeated me in the beginning, the Five Finger Mountain Seal, the Three Treasures Ruyi, and the Bodhi tree were all done by the primordial Lord of Heaven!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
