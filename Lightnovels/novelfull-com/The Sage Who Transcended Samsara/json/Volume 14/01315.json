Where can I train to hide from the one in my hometown?”Meng Qi was not surprised or doubtful. With little sang’s wisdom, she would definitely have thought of this. There must be a follow-up to her words.</p><p>Gu Little Sang’s eyes were dark and clear, as if she could see the bottom at a glance. However, the more she looked at it, the more she felt that it was unfathomable. It was like a clear river that could see the bottom. The depth must be deeper than she had expected.</p><p>She focused on Meng Qi’s face for a few breaths. When Meng Qi felt a little uncomfortable, she suddenly smiled, like the blooming of orchids in an empty valley. It was clear and beautiful:</p><p>“Husband, could it be that you can’t bear to part with me?”</p><p>Her eyes moved like a clever little fox. Without waiting for Meng Qi’s answer, she said to herself, “You must know that a good woman aspires to be everywhere.”</p><p>Her tone was slightly raised, and there was a hint of coquettishness in it. However, she was teasing Meng Qi by saying that a good man aspires to be everywhere.</p><p>“You want to be a good man, but you don’t want to go alone,”Meng Qi said to Gu Xiaosang with a smile, dispelling other thoughts.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang chuckled and didn’t comment, she changed the topic and said, “To be able to hide from the training of that person from vacuum hometown, it’s nothing more than the different levels of the nine underworld, the Celestial Realms, and the places where you can get close to the Dao. However, that person must have made arrangements in Luo Feng’s black prison for the world after his death and the destination of all living beings. Although he can’t tell the details of the matters in the nine underworld, he should have the ability to deduce the details. Going there to train is no less than walking into a trap. The celestial realms may collapse or be destroyed. It can be used as a source of harvest for a moment, but it’s not a place where you can train for a long time. The places where you can get close to the Dao have their own secrets. They may be occupied or difficult to find. It’s just like the starting point of life and death. If it weren’t for Zhenwu or Fu Huang who have their own trump cards, how could it be so easy to enter?”</p><p>Zhen Wu hadn’t reached the other shore yet, so the emperor-subduing state was extremely abnormal. It didn’t matter to mention their names.</p><p>“Now that you mention it, it seems like there’s no more training,”Meng Qi said with a smile, as if he had already guessed something.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang raised her exquisite face and said with a smile, “Doesn’t husband know? Other than these, isn’t there only the myriad realms in the bodies of the big figures on the other shore?”</p><p>Once one reached the other side, the inner world would become a real world. As one’s cultivation progressed, the nine underworld realms in the heavens would open up one after another.</p><p>“But who can be trusted?”Meng Qi asked the main point.</p><p>Who would be happy to see that the Golden Emperor was not perfected and that there was no hope for the embryonic form of the Dao Fruit?</p><p>At the mention of this matter, Gu Xiaosang had a rare moment of thought. Her gaze wavered. “The one in vacuum hometown is brilliant and far-reaching. He is even more capable than the one in Fusang ancient tree. I can’t think of any big figures who can be trusted…”</p><p>“He comprehended dao because of the Wuji Seal left by the Master of Hollow Jade Temple. He died yesterday, and now he lives today. He has always maintained a good relationship with this lineage. Later on, he secretly formed a Buddhist sect and worshiped the Master of the Paradise World and the Bodhi Pure Land. He learned the magic method of crossing the world from Maitreya Bodhisattva. Finally, he appeared in vacuum hometown and completed some secret things for them. The one from Fusang ancient tree was on good terms with him in the early years of the ancient era. He has always been watching over and helping each other. Until now, he even borrowed your hand and gave you a great gift. His kindness in attaining Dao is far greater than yours. He is an innate god and the head of female immortals. He treats both humans and demons alike. When he was in charge of the Jade Lake, he had a deep friendship with demon saint and was often praised by the ancestors of the human race…”</p><p>This is really all-seeing, clever, no wonder when the road is smooth sailing, did not leave the story of breaking through obstacles… Meng Qi listened to praise.</p><p>“When the 33 heavens were still in existence, he never disobeyed the orders of the ancient Celestial Master from Tuoba Palace. Even if the celestial emperor did not like it, the human emperor incident in the Early Middle Ages ended in chaos. All living things returned to their good health. It was only after meeting the expectations of the ancient Celestial Master from Tuoba Palace that there were changes. Some of these important figures may not have the heart to see him complete, but I can not tell who is real and who is fake. I have to verify it through a series of events. If I think about it carefully, the only one who will be his enemy is the completely fallen human emperor, the Celestial Emperor whose whereabouts are unknown, and the one who is more neutral is the one from green touring palace who has yet to be found,”Gu Xiaosang said in a gentle voice, there was no trace of fear in his words. It was as if he was analyzing the affairs of others.</p><p>“The one from vacuum hometown seems to be on the side of the victor. Just this alone is enough to make one shudder.”Meng Qi sighed.</p><p>It seemed that mother Wu Sheng had played an important role in the death of the human emperor!</p><p>He continued, “The human emperor has transformed into the real world and is protecting all the human beings. I don’t know where the celestial emperor has reincarnated and whether he has grown up or not. At least his body has become the saber of time, just like the reincarnation mark of Empress Hou Tu. Among the two peerless divine weapons, there is indeed the real world, and even all the worlds in the universe. However, the latter is in the hands of the Devil Buddha. The former must have many people paying attention to it at present.”</p><p>His overlord saber also had the “Inner Heaven and earth”that was close to all the worlds in the world. However, the Devil Buddha brand had not been completely wiped out. Once it was touched, he would not keep it a secret for himself.</p><p>As for the nirvana-level peerless, the original body of the demon Saint Spear was on good terms with the Golden Emperor, the Bodhi magical tree was in Han Guang’s hands, the Netherworld Sea sword was the item of the seven kills Daoist, and the primordial Yang ruler was obtained by Emperor Zhenwu. However, he was currently missing, since Guldo died, the whereabouts of the heaven punishing axe had been unknown for a long time, and the demon Emperor’s claw was being stared at by a few false nirvana levels. It was likely that it could not hide from their eyes. The human emperor sword could be tried, but it was unknown whether it had fully awakened, whether there would be restrictions in the inner world or not, as for the rest, it was all up to the masters of each family, so they had to choose the ones that were completely trustworthy.</p><p>As Meng Qi thought about it, he saw Gu Xiaosang smile sweetly. It was as if the light was as bright as day, floating and flowing. “Please teach me, my husband.”</p><p>“Let me help you make a choice?”Meng Qi was quite surprised. Xiaosang was shrewd and determined. She was very decisive and decisive in crucial matters. Shouldn’t such matters have already been decided? Why did she ask him to help?</p><p>Gu little sang pursed her lips and smiled. “I know that person from vacuum hometown, and he treats me the same way. She will definitely think of what I can think of in this matter, so I might as well hand it over to my husband to make a decision. Anyway, your thoughts have always been jumpy, and you often make people dumbfounded.”</p><p>Was she complimenting me for being unconventional in my work? Meng Qi immediately smiled and said,</p><p>“If that’s the case, then I’ll make a decision. The Emperor Sword is my backup. I’ll go to a place first.”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s mouth opened slightly when she heard this. Meng Qi’s decisiveness seemed to have exceeded her expectations. She had a feeling that he had used his battle instincts and instincts to find a way out without thinking.</p><p>“Where?”She asked.</p><p>“The flesh and blood of the primordial emperor that was suppressed by the Qingping Sword on the Golden Ao Island,”Meng Qi said proudly, “Not only do you need to temper yourself, but I also need to use all means to improve myself and gather strong reinforcements. That Emperor hasn’t truly fallen, and the flesh and blood that hasn’t been wiped out must have some remnants of the myriad worlds in it. Moreover, it might even be able to activate the power of the demonic blood peach, as well as drive the tiger to swallow the wolf, completely wiping out the Devil Buddha imprint and allowing the absolute blade to completely awaken!”</p><p>This was the magic weapon from the other side, and it was the last one to be born, so it had the least time erosion!</p><p>“Hubby, can you find the Golden Ao Island?”Gu Xiaosang thought for a while and smiled.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled:</p><p>“I couldn’t find it in the past, but it doesn’t mean that I can’t find it after I’ve entered the fortune-telling realm.”</p><p>Besides, Yuan Hong had secretly lived here, so he wasn’t worried about encountering the heavenly venerate of treasures.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
