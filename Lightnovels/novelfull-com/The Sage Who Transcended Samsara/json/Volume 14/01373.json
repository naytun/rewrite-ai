Compared to our eternal suffering, there’s nothing wrong with dying early.” There was almost nothing that could escape Meng Qi’s gaze. He was no stranger to Gu Xiaosang’s childhood experiences.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s smile grew wider, and her breath blew into Meng Qi’s ears. “That’s the father of the body of the past. As for the body of the present…”</p><p>She suddenly called out softly, “Father…”</p><p>“Father…”</p><p>Meng Qi’s body trembled, and his scalp went numb. He turned to look at his mother and found that she was very satisfied with the intimacy between the two of them. He nodded slightly to encourage her.</p><p>She naturally couldn’t hear what the great power of creation didn’t want her to hear.</p><p>After chatting for a while, Meng Qi’s mother went into the kitchen and began to prepare dinner. Gu Xiaosang glanced at her busy figure, played with her hair with her right hand, and said, “Should I go in and help?”</p><p>“No, you’re a guest when you meet the parents. Our Mother will feel uncomfortable if you go and help,”Meng Qi shook his head and answered, “Besides, I’ve never seen you cook. Who knows what you’ll make. The Saintess of Luo sect won’t teach you that.”</p><p>“Luo sect won’t teach me, but I’ve been through reincarnation and survived alone,”Gu Xiaosang said with a smile, “And I’m being considerate. I’m not as stable as you. You Don’t know how to be filial at all.”</p><p>Meng Qi chuckled. “If I go in, she’ll kick me out. I Can’t neglect my guest.”</p><p>The two chatted while the kitchen was busy. The sound of chopping vegetables and spatulas could be heard from time to time, making everything seem peaceful and warm.</p><p>Before dinner arrived, Meng Qi’s father rushed home from work early. He was also stunned when he saw Gu Xiaosang. He couldn’t believe that his son could find such an outstanding girlfriend.</p><p>Although he had always been proud of Meng Qi, he was also very clear about the fact that his son’s education was average, his job was average, his looks were average, and his family’s conditions were even more average. In addition to his courage and perseverance, his personality was lively, and he was good at adjusting the atmosphere, when interacting with people, he was the kind of person who could not be found in a crowd in an instant. How could such a girl like him take a fancy to him?</p><p>As for his lively personality, he had never brought a girl home in the past twenty years!</p><p>Was he really blind?</p><p>With such a mentality, the old man felt a little uneasy in the face of the “Quiet and obedient”gu xiaosang. He found an excuse and sneaked into the kitchen. He exchanged views with Meng Qi’s mother and communicated with her. Only then did he calm down, he returned to the living room with the idea of letting nature take its course.</p><p>The dishes were sumptuous during dinner. Meng Qi’s mother and father wouldn’t ask too many questions about the girl who came to visit them for the first time. Anyway, they could ask Meng Qi about it in private, so they brought up all the embarrassing things that happened to Meng Qi when he was young, for example, he was chased by a dog three streets away and burst into tears. For example, he was naked in the shower when he was two or three years old. Gu Xiaosang didn’t know if she was pretending to cater to him or if she was really interested. She listened to him with great interest and smiled brightly, from time to time, she would chime in and say a few words about Meng Qi’s stupidity. For a moment, the guests and hosts were having fun.</p><p>After that, the two didn’t stay long. After sitting for a while, they made an excuse of going on a business trip, leaving gifts and reminders to leave.</p><p>“I thought you were going to stay for a night?”The evening wind was blowing gently. Gu Xiaosang brushed her hair by her ears and looked at Meng Qi with a smile.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and sighed. “I don’t dare to expect too much from this kind of life. It’s better to try not to disturb their peace and happiness. Anyway, the era has ended. Who knows what kind of ending it will have.”</p><p>“That’s true. If we keep talking about it, our mother will even Nag about the girls you used to like.”Gu Xiaosang smiled like a flower. Her eyes were watery, and there was a hint of teasing hidden in them, “I wonder if your taste in the past is as high as it is now?”</p><p>“Haha, How Could It Be…”meng Qi laughed dryly and changed the topic. “I really didn’t see that you could pretend to be so quiet and well-behaved.”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang smiled with twinkling stars in her eyes:</p><p>“Husband, how could you know that this is not part of my nature?”</p><p>..</p><p>In the living room, Meng Qi’s mother and father were drinking tonics, and the smile on their faces remained.</p><p>Suddenly, his mother sighed and said, “Little sang, this girl is good in everything, but she is too good. How could our silly son be worthy of her? He is so happy now, and who knows what kind of blow he will take in the future.”</p><p>“Forget it. Don’t worry about it. Meng Qi is still young. Even if there’s no result, he’ll still be able to live a full life.”His father took a sip of Ganoderma tea and sighed, “Although society has taught us to be self-aware, it’s not that we can’t have dreams. It’s that we have to figure out our current situation, the distance between our dreams, and how to approach them step by step. This is self-awareness. Just thinking about self-awareness is enough to make us not dare to risk it, not dare to gamble, not dare to suffer, and not dare to improve ourselves. That’s just a cover for our cowardice, cowardice, and uselessness. I’ve lived for more than half my life, and only recently have I understood something.”</p><p>After saying that, he suddenly felt a chill. He turned his head and saw Meng Qi’s mother looking at him with a puzzled face. She said in a low voice, “Did you have a great fight when you were young?”</p><p>That was not the point… Meng Qi’s father suddenly broke out in a cold sweat.</p><p>..</p><p>Walking along the well-wooded road in the neighborhood, Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang seemed to be a normal couple on earth.</p><p>However, above their heads, the crescent moon seemed to be dragged by someone as they sprinted. In just a few breaths, they had finished the whole night’s journey and welcomed the Orange Morning Sun.</p><p>At this time, Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang stopped in front of a hall. The door had just opened, and there was a plaque hanging on it: “XXX Civil Affairs Bureau Marriage Registration Office.”.</p><p>“After we register, we will be legally married,”Meng Qi said seriously.</p><p>Even if we don’t register, no one would dare to say that we’re not husband and wife… Gu Xiaosang pursed her lips and smiled, following Meng Qi’s interest, she pretended to be coquettish and said, “I just brought them to meet their parents, and you can’t wait to get married. You’re really impatient.”</p><p>The two walked into the hall and came to a window. The working aunt was startled and blurted out, “The divorce is over there.”</p><p>“No, we’re here to register our marriage.”Meng Qi took out their household register, ID cards, photos, and completed forms. Of course, he took them out of thin air, and the whole system suddenly had information about the two of them, the corresponding part of Meng Qi was slightly different from Meng Xiaoqi’s, so as to avoid causing trouble for his “Younger brother.”.</p><p>The middle-aged woman took the documents and looked at the two of them carefully. She could not help but say,</p><p>“Miss, the marriage is very important. You Can’t be deceived.”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang wanted to make a tearful expression, but for some reason, she felt a little sacred and solemn. She chuckled and said, “Don’t worry, Aunty. He looks like a fool. In our family, I’m the only one who can deceive him.”</p><p>The aunt shook her head secretly and did not say anything else. She flipped through the documents and began to make the marriage certificate after confirming that there were no problems.</p><p>Seeing the two red notebooks handed over, Gu Xiaosang subconsciously looked at Meng Qi. He happened to look over as well, and their eyes met. They looked at each other and smiled. Unknowingly, they took the marriage certificate.</p><p>Watching the two leave, the aunt picked up the Teacup and whispered to herself, “A flower was placed on the cow dung…”</p><p>She took a sip of the tea and moved the mouse to read Meng Qi’s message:</p><p>“Name: Meng Qi.”</p><p>“Occupation: Primordial Celestial Master.”</p><p>Puff… the aunt spat out a mouthful of tea and stained the screen. When she wiped it clean, she realized that her eyes were playing tricks on her.</p><p>“But why did my eyes play tricks on me…”the aunt was puzzled.</p><p>Outside the hall, Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang stepped into the river of time again and disappeared.</p><p>..</p><p>On the other side, Meng Xiaoqi suddenly received a call from home after a few days of bafflement.</p><p>“How have you been recently?”His mother’s familiar voice sounded.</p><p>Meng Xiaoqi told her the truth, “I’m not in a good mood.”</p><p>He was just waiting for his mother to comfort him!</p><p>The other side was silent for more than ten seconds before saying earnestly, “What’s yours is yours. If It’s not yours, it won’t be yours.”</p><p>Mom, what are you talking about? Just as Meng Xiaoqi was about to ask again, the other side had already hung up the phone, making him confused.</p><p>What happened to comforting him?</p><p>When it was time for vacation, he thought about it and hurriedly took a car home.</p><p>The door opened. When Meng Qi’s mom saw him coming back, she frowned slightly and said, “Are You Alone?”</p><p>“Of course,”Meng Xiaoqi answered blankly. If I’m not alone, who else will I bring?</p><p>Meng Qi’s mother opened her mouth. She was about to say something, but she stopped herself in the end. She changed the topic and said, “Come, I’ll cook you a sumptuous meal.”</p><p>Meng Xiaoqi watched his mother go shopping with a dumbfounded look. He kept feeling that something was going on behind his back, but then he received a piece of good news. His mother and father had jointly announced that they would not force him to go on a blind date again, therefore, he threw all the previous problems to the back of his mind.</p><p>..</p><p>Time went back, and the past reappeared. Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang had traveled along the long river for tens of millions of years. Suddenly, it was dark before his eyes. He could only see that the earth was covered by black smoke and dust, and he could no longer see the sun, huge dinosaur carcasses were strewn all over the place.</p><p>“This is the end of the last era, and the beginning of this era,”he nodded slightly and said.</p><p>The Earth is a treasure raft for crossing worlds and has no nothingness between the two epochs.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
