There is no end to reincarnation, and there is no end to suffering. Take pity on the people of this world. A God has descended, and Holy Mother White Lotus has saved us from the end of our tribulation!”</p><p>Originally, wherever the Great Zhou was, be it the home of vacuum or the Buddhist kingdom on Earth, the ears of the believers rang with an ethereal and holy sound that reverberated through the heavens and earth, washing their hearts. An indescribable feeling rose up, making them all worship devoutly, the chanting resonated in a low voice. Billions and billions of grains of sand gathered into a tower. It was grand and divine to the extreme.</p><p>Such a commotion, coupled with the nine nether “Volcanoes”that spewed everywhere and the devil fog and black dust that covered the great sun, even the ordinary people on the east China Sea Islands sensed that something was about to happen, not to mention the experts of the immortal class.</p><p>Wang Siyuan sat alone on the island and lived under a tree. Ever since he tried to influence and manipulate the Heavenly Dao monsters to fall into the trap of the Devil Buddha Ah Nan, he had left the mortal world and lived in seclusion. For many years, he did not say a word. This was because he was reflecting on his past mistakes, he was also thinking hard about how to fight against the will of heaven under the other shore. His so-called “Smashing the chessboard”was just the embodiment of the other “Will of heaven”..</p><p>At that moment, sensing the arrival of the end of the world and sensing that there was a change in the middle-earth, he raised his head and looked there. His eyes were moving crazily and his emotions were changing. Finally, a bitter and lonely look appeared on his face. He sighed and said,</p><p>“Indeed, only those on the other shore can fight against those on the other shore…”</p><p>All the craziness and scheming that he had been doing all his life turned into nothing in the end. All he got in return was this familiar old saying. This was the experience and lesson that countless predecessors had learned with their lives and destinies!</p><p>In an instant, his black hair turned completely white.</p><p>“Holy Mother White Lotus, save the end of the Tribulation!”</p><p>The voices overlapped and shook all the worlds in the universe. The lotus flowers around Gu Xiaosang bloomed. They were fresh and refined, forming a spiritual altar that supported her as she slowly rose into the sky. The cold light scattered down, making her look like a Buddha, a god, and a fairy!</p><p>Between Heaven and earth, the illusory river of time was prominent. It came from the distant ancient times, surging endlessly. The water was sparkling, scouring through everything and never changing. It was just that this time, after the current node.., the tributaries of the future had become scarce, and it was no longer impossible to count them all. One could even see the end of the terrifying darkness of nothingness. The end of the epoch was right before their eyes!</p><p>The real apocalypse, the real end, even the one on the other side, might not have a future!</p><p>For Gu Xiaosang, it was relatively easier to take possession of the future. She pointed with her finger and revealed her own dharma body. She had the innate virtue to return to the infinite, the chaos to reappear, and the will to die to create the final deathly stillness, there were also white lotuses surrounding her to save people. The three of them shrank and began to condense illusory dao fruits. They pulled Gu Xiaosang up slowly, breaking away from the erosion of time and approaching the structure of the highest level of the universe.</p><p>In the hometown of vacuum, the bright and cold moon hung high in the sky, reflecting the peace after her death. She gave Gu Xiaosang a look of approval for her efforts in breaking free from the sea of bitterness.</p><p>It was not because she was satisfied, but because she wanted to use this “Approval”to make Gu Xiaosang feel even more excited. She wanted to use this as a basis to break through the next difficult obstacles.</p><p>As for the other obstacles on the other side, the situation had long been clear. She, Amitabha, Bodhi ancient Buddha, Yu Xu, Su Meng, the Heavenly Emperor, and the Devil Buddha would not stop them. Even if the green emperor was not neutral.., even if the Supreme True Buddha tried to cause trouble, they and the virtuous heavenly venerate and the monster Emperor would not be able to cause any waves. Today’s focus was not on this!</p><p>The Netherworld connected to the real world. The Devil Buddha got up and walked out. He walked out slowly with the images of destruction, slaughter, freeze, degeneration, and deathly stillness. He had a handsome face, and his monk robes fluttered in the wind. He was calm and at ease, he was like a gentleman who bowed slightly to announce the end of the story.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The space and time in the Western Region and the extreme south of the eastern sea collapsed layer by layer. The Wuji Apricot Flag and Netherworld Sea Sword in the center of the world could no longer sustain it. The two worlds merged and collapsed at an accelerated rate.</p><p>The end of the world had really come!</p><p>Right at this moment, outside the 33 heavens, the Taiji diagram of the black and white yin-yang fish flew out from the Dou Shuai palace and turned into a higan golden bridge. It crossed the ancient mythological era and the prehistoric era, it crossed the era when Old Lord Huang ruled the three realms with the tree of Great Dao on his back. It crossed the ancient era when innate gods and demons roamed freely. It crossed the most ancient era and arrived at the moment when the world was opened up, it came to the moment when time had just stretched out.</p><p>At that time, the figure of the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning still existed. He sat cross-legged in the deep chaos with the banner of Pangu in his hand. He activated the seal of heaven-opening and struck out!</p><p>Riding on the Green Bull, the heavenly venerate of virtue crossed the river of time in an instant and arrived at its “Source.”His bright head was calm, and his hands turned into two yin-yang fish, one black and one white, with their heads and tails intertwined, he was about to forcefully open the source of time and return the god Ascension and the westward journey to the real world. He would return time to its original appearance, and let the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning and the heavenly venerate of Lingbao appear in front of the world again!</p><p>“Amitabha of the South!”</p><p>The chanting of Buddha sounded from every point of light in the river of time and turned into the corresponding images of Amitabha. They gathered into a sea of bodies and rushed forward, drowning the opening of Heaven and earth.</p><p>At the critical moment of the apocalypse, not many people on the other shore were willing to see the return of the two oldest heavenly venerates to change the current situation and destroy their own plans. Therefore, Amitabha would not give in, he took action to stop the celestial venerable from opening the root of time.</p><p>At the same time, the twelfth-grade Green Lotus Throne flew up and merged with the western paradise world to form Amitabha’s perfect incarnation. A dreamy mist emerged and the six-foot-long golden body shone brightly with boundless light, boundless longevity, and boundless divine abilities!</p><p>The celestial venerable pushed the ancient crown on his head, and a gust of clear air rushed out of the clay ball. It turned into the beginning of many eras of prosperity, prosperity, and decline in the universe. Each of them condensed a Daoist, either holding a long sword or holding a ruyi, stepping on the Higan golden bridge, they fought with Amitabha’s avatar, Avatar, and Avatar.</p><p>The battle between the two most ancient men swept through the time when the world was created, and there were changes in the subsequent eras. Some things even did not exist at all. For a time, the scene of the end of the world became more and more clear, if Amitabha did not care that this was the crucial moment for Gu Xiaosang to attain Dao, and more historical changes were maintained, the situation would have been even more serious.</p><p>Due to the deepening influence of the Doomsday on the celestial venerable of morals, Amitabha still stopped Gu Xiaosang’s attempt to open the root of time.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Thunder rumbled incessantly in the sky. Bolts of lightning filled the sky, as if they could tear apart the real world. Meanwhile, the westward journey and the Godhood World in the different rivers of time suddenly shook, and strange lights flew up. On one side, there were golden flowers of virtue.., blessed purple clouds and holy virtue were surrounded by water light, and on the other side, there were four colors of red, green, black, and white. It was a scene of the end, as if a terrifying existence was about to break out of it and return to the present!</p><p>Primordial Lord of Heaven! Lingbao Lord of Heaven!</p><p>How could he return by sacrificing the godhood and westward journey without opening the source of time? Meng Qi sat in the Hollow Jade Palace, guarding Gu Xiaosang as she condensed the illusory dao fruit. At the same time, he watched the changes in the world, and his mind was filled with many questions.</p><p>He Mu and Jiu Li were on duty in front of the clear Jade Palace today. They were all in low spirits about the arrival of the end of the world.</p><p>They still had a chance to survive the end of the world under the protection of the big figures on the other side. Their good friends and companions probably wouldn’t have the opportunity to do so!</p><p>Seeing the transformation of the god Ascension and the journey to the west, the terrifying and extraordinary aura and feeling became as clear as the Jets of the nine underworld. It gradually became more and more powerful. It seemed that the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning and the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure were really about to return. How could the other people on the other side just sit there and watch?</p><p>At the highest level of the immortal world, the lofty and Majestic Heavenly Emperor suddenly took a step forward and drew out the blade of time that was like water reflecting the sun. He suddenly slashed toward the opposite side. It was not the god Ascension Realm and the Western world, but the construction wood that pierced through all the worlds in the universe, it was the foundation that supported the existence of heaven and earth!</p><p>The light of the blade was faint. It instantly pierced through the seals on the other side and landed on the construction wood. Time flew by quickly. In a breath of a hundred years, the construction wood that could have struggled for a long time in the apocalypse suddenly withered and turned green to yellow, the tree trunk also withered.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The heavenly soldiers and generals attached to Jian Mu all died of old age and turned into its last source of power.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Jian Mu changed crazily and absorbed all the ninth heaven. The top of it was held by the Heavenly Emperor’s holy giant hand and smashed toward the western world with the power of the end of the world-destroying era. It was vast and destructive.</p><p>Only such an end could restrain the five virtues and the five supreme beings, restrain the infinite chaos, and barely prevent the return of the primeval Lord of Heaven!</p><p>In order to guard against the heaven-opening seal, the heavenly emperor, who was high above the heavens, not only held the Jian Mu that contained all the worlds in one hand and smashed it down, but he also swung the knife of time, obscuring time and space and turning it dark and colorful.</p><p>His eyes were cold and gloomy, as if he had returned to the past. He led the charge into the highest level of the nine heavens and looked down at himself indifferently. It was the primeval Lord of Heaven.</p><p>The celestial emperor knew that due to the fall of the Heavenly Court, he had been on his last legs for a long time. He still had a long way to go to reduce the amount of time he had left. There was no possibility of transcendence in this era. Therefore, after returning from the tribulations.., he had been working hard to get rid of the fate of ending the celestial emperor’s inevitable fall in this era. If he did not solve this problem, he did not need to consider whether there was still a next era.</p><p>From the Devil Buddha, or rather, from Donghuang Taiyi, and the Dao master, he had obtained a technique that had a certain degree of hope under divination. Today, he was going to prevent the return of the primordial beginning heavenly venerate to witness himself breaking free from the shackles!</p><p>Jian Mu’s green and yellow intermingled and occupied the void. With the power of all worlds, he smashed into the golden light and purple clouds outside the god-sealing world, smashing into the boundless chaos that was like a dot</p><p>On the other side, a scroll containing the sun, Moon, stars, mountains, rivers, and the universe flew out from the Demon Emperor Hall. It turned into a blurry light and enveloped the world traveling to the west, it was on the verge of collapsing under the impact of the destruction of the world.</p><p>A sigh sounded. A black-gold spear that was surrounded by the five virtues Phoenix flew out from the Demon Emperor Hall again. Together with the pale golden human emperor sword that soared into the sky from Changmen Island, they stabbed into both sides of the mountain and river map, they used the power of all living things to stop all the changes.</p><p>Although it was very difficult and they were obviously at a disadvantage, the heavenly emperor and the Monster Emperor did temporarily stop the return of the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning and the heavenly venerate of Lingbao. The others on the other side of the river watched every corner of the universe in preparation for the following changes.</p><p>Because of the changes in the god Ascension and the journey to the West World, all the tributaries in the future were now in chaos and full of variables!</p><p>Meanwhile, Gu Xiaosang no longer paid attention to the situation. She was completely focused on breaking free from the sea of bitterness. The dao fruit that symbolized innate chaos, the dao fruit that symbolized the end of life, and the Dao fruit that symbolized the salvation of the world.., they were all condensing at a speed visible to the naked eye. Although they were illusory, they gave off a real feeling. They dragged her halfway out of the river of time.</p><p>At this moment, heavenly venerate nine chaos, who was driven mad by the apocalyptic aura, leaped out and attacked Yang Jian. It was as if he wanted to personally add bricks to the end of the epoch. As for Daoist seven kills, he was being suppressed by the aura of the demon Buddha step by step, he was forced back to the hollow jade temple.</p><p>The demon Buddha stepped onto the island in the East Sea and looked up at the hollow jade temple. He had a carefree smile on his face and his voice was like a bell that disturbed his mind, it rang in the ears of Meng Qi, Daoist seven kills, he mu, Jiu Li, and great green root:</p><p>“The Doomsday has arrived. It’s time for us to finish what we started.”</p><p>Finish what we started? Daoist seven kills couldn’t help but look at the demonic Buddha that had turned half of the eastern sea into the nine Netherworlds. He was confused.</p><p>At this moment, Bodhi ancient Buddha and green emperor weren’t restrained. Even with the Supreme True Buddha’s help, the Golden Emperor’s cooperation, and the Heavenly Dao monsters, it was impossible for the demonic Buddha to kill and Devour the Hierarch Heavenly Venerate, it was even possible for him to defeat the Hierarch Heavenly Venerate. After all, the Hierarch Heavenly Venerate had true determination tathagata and clear source daolord, the two weaker incarnations.</p><p>Meng Qi’s eyes met with the demon Buddha’s. The world suddenly turned dark. It was like the primal chaos, but also the final deathly stillness.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, you are truly confident,”Meng Qi said slowly. The clear air above his head rushed out, transforming into true rulai with red lips and white teeth, and the handsome and carefree Daolord Qingyuan.</p><p>The demon Buddha chuckled:</p><p>“Of course!”</p><p>A dark red projection appeared behind him. It spun nonstop, as if it were chaotic and crazed eyes.</p><p>At this moment, in the Bodhi Pure Land, there was suddenly a clear glass light shooting up into the sky. There were years of decay filling it. It surrounded the ancient Bodhi tree and the ancient Buddha together!</p><p>The ancient Bodhi Buddha looked at the three figures around him and said in a low voice,</p><p>“The Devil Buddha is indeed a traitor. There is always a hidden danger in cooperating with him.”</p><p>The three figures surrounding the ancient Bodhi Buddha were none other than the quasi-lift Daoist, Ghost Emperor Xuanming, and Black Heaven Emperor!</p><p>They were the three corpses of the Bodhi ancient Buddha!</p><p>The quasi-lift Daoist, who had his hair in a bun, smiled. He said with a hint of fear and determination,</p><p>“Who doesn’t want to become an independent, true creation or the other shore?”</p><p>As the evil demon who had refined the nine Netherworlds, the bewitching and seductive “Founder,”the Devil Buddha seized some of the thoughts that would flash through the Three Corpses and used cooperation as an opportunity to help refine the nine Netherworlds, he secretly hid a trick. when he planted the “Bodhi wisdom son”for the Xuanming Ghost Emperor, he also increased his obsession. Then, with this “Chess piece”that had been infiltrated, he quietly influenced the Black Heaven Emperor and the quasi-ti Daoist.</p><p>At the critical moment, the three corpses rebelled at the same time. Even someone as strong as the Bodhi ancient Buddha could not care about other things. After all, if he accidentally killed one of the three corpses, it would cause his body to become incomplete. In comparison, he and Meng Qi were not related, without too much cause and effect, he would not cut off the path of this era just to stop the Devil Buddha.</p><p>Inside the Bodhi Pure Land, there was a glow and a glass seal. It made the Devil Buddha look even bigger, as if he could never be defeated.</p><p>His gaze was fixed on Meng Qi, and he revealed the dark and terrifying devil body of the reverse Buddha. Each of his arms had a treasure that symbolized destruction and fear.</p><p>There was no coincidence in the world. When the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning and the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure tried to return, other than Amitabha who would definitely intercept the heavenly venerate of virtue, whether it was the Bodhi ancient Buddha who stopped them or the monster emperor, the Heavenly Emperor, and the Golden Emperor who made a move.., the situation would not change.</p><p>The Heavenly Emperor and the Golden Emperor were his allies. The Bodhi ancient Buddha was involved in the rebellion of the three corpses, while the monster Emperor had the benefit of the animosity caused by Nezha and the temptation of the Heavenly Emperor!</p><p>In addition, no one wanted to see you improve again and let the three pure ones achieve transcendence. In short, no one would help you!</p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s illusory dao fruit was almost half-formed, her figure appeared in the “Vacuum hometown”at the end of the new age, which symbolized the final destination. She retreated to the current node. Many figures gathered and merged with each other, eventually forming a single figure.</p><p>Meng Qi, on the other hand, stared at the Devil Buddha, who had yet to make a move for some unknown reason, and said calmly,</p><p>“With just you and mother gold, even if you join forces, it will be easy to defeat me, but it will be extremely difficult to kill me.”</p><p>More importantly, Emperor Qing had recovered to his peak level. Although he was not an ancient man, he could still be considered to be on the other side of the world. When Zhending Tathagata blocked the monster of the Heavenly Dao, and Lord Daoist Qingyuan blocked the Supreme True Buddha, he would join forces with Meng Qi, it was not difficult to resist the demon Buddha and the Golden Emperor. At most, he would be at a disadvantage. The Golden Emperor had to be distracted by Xiao Sang’s attack on the other shore, in case the powerful ones found an opportunity to destroy it.</p><p>The demon Buddha smiled leisurely and asked in return,</p><p>“Is that so?”</p><p>As soon as he said that, Meng Qi, who was sitting on the cloud bed, had a slight change in expression. Two dark streams of light came out of nowhere and suddenly burst out, piercing through the chaotic water light hanging down from his supreme infinite primordial qi and into it, it made his aura suddenly decrease!</p><p>All of this happened without any warning. It even hid from Meng Qi’s senses and his grasp of the future!</p><p>Following the two dark streams of light, Meng Qi saw a figure that would never sneak attack him. It was he mu and Jiu Li, whose faces were full of pain and struggle!</p><p>Their eyes alternated between madness and guilt. They let out the Devil Buddha’s loud laughter:</p><p>“There are no coincidences in this world. Why Is it today? Because they are on duty at the Jade Pure Palace!”</p><p>At the same time, the demon Buddha’s expression became solemn as he formed a seal with his hands.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Inside the Fusang Ancient Tree realm, Emperor Qing, who was about to attack, suddenly sat down with his legs crossed. His body was covered in a layer of dark fire, as if he had suffered a backlash.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Fusang ancient tree, which was comparable to a building tree but was growing vigorously, emitted an infinite amount of light. It suddenly flew up and became smaller and smaller as it fell into the apocalyptic scene behind the demon Buddha’s head.</p><p>It actually took the initiative to throw itself at the demon Buddha!</p><p>The demon Buddha no longer hesitated. With a finger, the absolute saint abandoned zhi and pressed it between Meng Qi’s eyebrows in the hollow jade temple.</p><p>No matter what, I also have the tree of Great Dao!</p><p>I can kill you without the help of the gold emperor!</p><p>Looking at this finger, Meng Qi suddenly sighed:</p><p>“Haotian…”</p><p>Today, he finally saw the true face of the demon Buddha!</p><p>He Mu and Jiu Li had fused with the blood of the Haotian God..</p><p>The fusang ancient tree was made of the blood of the Haotian God and the East Emperor, Taiyi..</p><p>The Green Emperor was born from this..</p><p>The East Emperor died at the hands of Haotian..</p><p>The Devil Buddha could control the monster of the Heavenly Dao that had fused with the east emperor with the body of destiny..</p><p>The Thunder God knew the secret of building wood and could guide the Devil Master to reach the other shore. He could use this to bewitch the heaven emperor..</p><p>The reason why he knew so much was because he was an old monster who had survived from the primordial chaos era by using the ancient thunder pool to deceive the heavens and the sea, he was the heavenly emperor who had once competed with the DAO Master, the three pure ones, and Amitabha for the position of the ruler of Heaven and earth and the Dao fruit. He was the first heavenly emperor who had escaped the end of the epoch, but because of this, his past life was almost over, only the inner demons who fought against the DAO Master and the three pure ones were left. They had been betraying him, so they decided to sink and ascend to the peak of the demonic path!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
