It stood high above the emperor, its wide robe behind its back. One could not tell that it was happy that the orthodoxy had finally been completed. Its Majesty was revealed.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled as he stepped into the hall. He cupped his hands as usual. “Congratulations, imperial brother. Congratulations, imperial brother. The orthodoxy has been established in a single day. Fortune is not far away.”</p><p>“Accomplished in a single day?”Gao LAN’s expression changed slightly. His thin lips were clearly defined. He seemed to be sighing with emotion as he said, “Looking back, it has already been a hundred years…”</p><p>A hundred years had passed. How could the road to becoming a human emperor be easy?</p><p>Without waiting for Meng Qi to speak, he continued, “You didn’t return to the hollow jade temple but came to Changle City first. You must have something to ask of me. Could it be that you came here to revive me?”</p><p>Meng Qi smiled casually. “I am your royal brother.”</p><p>He was used to being lazy in front of Gao Lan, so he did not want to waste his breath explaining the reason. He immediately bowed solemnly and said, “Please grant my request, Royal Brother.”</p><p>Gao Lan’s tone did not change. He said, “In the past, I said that Chong he was a skeleton in the tomb, and he did not have much time left. I truly meant it from the bottom of my heart. However, I did not expect him to be a reincarnator, the leader of the Celestial Miracle. He secretly mastered the one Qi three pure ones and the immortal slaying sword formation, which was beyond my expectations. However, when I began to value him, he sacrificed his life for righteousness and generously went to the trouble, which once again surprised me…”</p><p>He frankly said that he had made a mistake back then. There was not the slightest bit of embarrassment or anger. Instead, there was a faint hint of admiration.</p><p>Meng Qi was not surprised by this. Back then, Big Brother Joker’s personality was heroic, righteous, and full of emotion. Chong and his predecessor’s actions were just right for him. Now that his personality had returned to one, it did not mean that similar feelings had completely disappeared.</p><p>“After decades, Chong and Zong can be resurrected and returned. However, the Earth immortal ears have long been unable to keep up with the current situation. Not only him, but Lu Zhiping is also the same. Time is the most ruthless. Fate has always played tricks on people. Before I had the time to find them for a decisive battle, they already could not keep up with my footsteps.”Looking back to the past.., this was a great enemy that Gao Lan had always remembered and used to spur him on. Now that he looked at it again, he couldn’t help but sigh. “At this point, why should I be afraid of Chong He and Resurrection?”</p><p>After saying this, he turned his fingers into swords and started to write characters in the air. They formed golden characters and turned into a yellow dragon that shook its head and tail. It flew into the heaven sealing platform and entered the pivotal area.</p><p>Golden Light Rose and the name of Daoist Chong he became prominent. Then, it was erased. A bit of his true spirit flew out and went straight to Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi waved his sleeve and the universe was re-established. He instantly put away Daoist Chong he’s true spirit. He hadn’t rebuilt his dao body yet, so he couldn’t come into contact with the ten thousand worlds. Otherwise, he would be infected by the reincarnation intent.</p><p>“Thank you, Royal Brother.”Meng Qi smiled sincerely and left the palace. He cursed in his heart. His big brother talked for so long just to find a good reason to resurrect Chong he and his seniors, he did not expect him to have such a “Tsundere”side.</p><p>After leaving Changle, he immediately chanted the name of Moonlight Bodhisattva and was dragged into the Pure Land of eastern glass.</p><p>Seeing his old acquaintance, Moonlight Bodhisattva, still sitting cross-legged under the bodhisattva of wither and glory, meditating on the path of Buddhist impermanence, Meng Qi revealed his signature smile again:</p><p>“Bodhisattva, I’m here to disturb you again.”</p><p>Eh, why did he say again?</p><p>“You…”Moonlight Bodhisattva didn’t know whether to laugh or to curse. He pointed at the perfect virtue pool not far away. “Go do your own thing. Don’t disturb my cultivation.”</p><p>“Thank you, Bodhisattva.”Meng Qi walked to the side of the eight treasures virtue pool with a smile. The water in the pool was like pure gold and glass. It had all kinds of virtues, and it was perfect. It actually had some innate intent.</p><p>He waved his sleeve, and a bit of true spirit flew out and fell into the pool. The Buddhist treasures shone one after another, and the golden water rippled and slowly condensed into an old Daoist with white hair and white hair, skin like an infant.</p><p>Seeing that things were going smoothly, Meng Qi’s smile became even brighter. He cupped his hands and said,</p><p>“Welcome back, Senior.”</p><p>Chong he was obviously a little lost, not knowing what day it was. He fixed his eyes on Meng Qi for a while, then looked around at the green and Green Pure Land that was full of vitality, then he said hesitantly, “I remember that I had already died in the Battle of Guerduo’s invasion. May I ask where is this place?”</p><p>He was a good Taoist priest. Even if he did not turn into ashes after his death, he should have been reincarnated into the Great Scarlet Heaven. Why did he appear in the Pure Land Buddhist kingdom?</p><p>Meng Qi laughed, he said concisely, “Senior was trapped in reincarnation. How could you transcend after your death? A bit of your true spirit was placed on the god Ascension list and was controlled by the Lord of the six paths of reincarnation. After a battle between mighty figures, the god Ascension list was obtained by the current human emperor. Junior had the audacity to ask for it and used this perfect pool of Merit to reconstruct Senior’s Dharma body.”</p><p>The cause and effect were clearly understood, and chong he roughly understood what was going on. He solemnly bowed his head and said, “Thank you, little friend Su, for saving me. I didn’t expect you to still remember me.”</p><p>At this point, he said with half doubt and half sincerity, “I’m afraid that the pool of perfect virtue can only be obtained by returning it to the Pure Land. Is this the western paradise of Amitabha? I want to thank you in person.”</p><p>“No, no. This world is the Pure Land of eastern glazed tiles of medicine master Wang Fo. The Green Emperor has attained nirvana. If senior wants to thank me, you can just offer a few incense sticks to the heavenly venerate Taiyi who saved the suffering,”Meng Qi explained with a smile.</p><p>“The Green Emperor has attained nirvana?”Chong he was obviously shocked. Nirvana was the most important figure in all the worlds in the universe, and there was one more!</p><p>Meng Qi held back his laughter and said, “Not only that, the real world is also changing. The Great Zhou has already annexed great Jin.”</p><p>“What? Great Jin is dead? is the current human emperor fellow Daoist Gao Lan?”Chong he still remembered that Gao Lan had the human emperor sword.</p><p>“That’s right.”Meng Qi nodded and replied.</p><p>Chong he’s expression changed a few times before a bitter smile appeared on his face. “How long has this old Daoist been dead?”</p><p>“Roughly thirty years.”Meng Qi could very well understand the feeling of the world changing as soon as he “Slept”and “Woke up.”.</p><p>“It has only been thirty years, but the world has changed so much…”chong he looked at Meng Qi carefully and revealed a smile, “My young friend from the Daoist Temple is unfathomable. He is no longer an earth immortal. I’m afraid that he is more than a celestial immortal. Do you think that he has already proven himself to be a legend?”</p><p>“I was lucky enough to enter the Serendipity.”How could meng Qi hide such a proud thing.</p><p>Chong he was stunned. “He is already a great divine ability user? It has only been thirty years…”</p><p>Even in the early years of ancient times, the gods that were born with legends could not compare to him!</p><p>Thirty years was not even enough to become a great grandmaster for the experts of his generation.</p><p>“Since the end of the apocalypse, the restrictions of heaven and earth have loosened, and there are many opportunities. This junior was just lucky,”Meng Qi said humbly.</p><p>“The current human emperor… I’m afraid that fellow Daoist Gao Lan has also verified his own legend?”Chong he subconsciously asked people and things that he was familiar with in the past.</p><p>“Of course.”Meng Qi simply finished speaking, “Senior nameless Su has also proven himself as a legend. Mr. Lu Da has opened his own path and is currently stuck in the Heaven Immortal realm. However, his path has been cleared, and it won’t be long before he can break through. His potential in the future is extremely great…”</p><p>Chong he quietly listened to him finish speaking and couldn’t help but sigh. “Today, this old Daoist is deeply moved by the vicissitudes of life.”</p><p>With his age, he had sent away countless fellow Daoists in the past, but they had all accumulated bit by bit. He had to be moved by them and suddenly look back to feel what vicissitudes of life were like. Now that a “Dream”had passed for twenty to thirty years.., the people he knew had undergone great changes and became unfamiliar. A strong sense of impact was born.</p><p>After thanking the Moonlight Bodhisattva, the two left the pure eastern glazed pure land and flew back in the direction of the Pure Yang sect. Halfway there.., chong he suddenly said, “There is a city below us. I would like to invite little friend Su to accompany me for a stroll. Let me see what the object I tried so hard to protect looks like now.”</p><p>“Good.”Meng Qi clapped his hands and smiled. At the same time, he and Daoist Chong he descended into the city. It was noon and the sun was scorching. However, there were green trees by the side of the road and their branches were connected to each other, it actually gave off a refreshing and cool feeling.</p><p>There were not many passers-by. All of them had high spirits, and there were not even half a beggar along the way.</p><p>After walking for half an hour, Chong he finally saw a few beggars. In the void nearby, there was a drawing of a divine official in a green robe.</p><p>“This is?”Chong he looked at Meng Qi in confusion.</p><p>“Gao Lan ruled the heavens with humanity. He established the heaven-sealing platform and combined it with the god-sealing roll. He was able to bestow the City God’s land, the mountain god he bo, receive the incense and protect an area at the same time. He supervised the government and the six doors. Of course, the divine path could not interfere in the affairs of humanity. They could only keep records of all kinds of things. They inherited the responsibility of the Shangguan and ordered the government office to deal with them. Now that the Mo family is short of manpower, so are the various business paths. As long as they don’t deliberately become lazy or have illnesses, they wouldn’t go to the extent of begging…”Meng Qi explained.</p><p>Chong he nodded as he listened. Suddenly, he pointed at a building in the distance and said, “That should be the government office.”</p><p>In the eyes of martial cultivators, that building was shrouded in a faint red and golden light, and was invulnerable to ghosts and demons.</p><p>“That’s right. After the unification of humanity, it can already give officials of different ranks the power of humanity, forming fate. Not only can it help them cultivate, but it can also suppress ghosts and demons.”Meng Qi nodded with a smile.</p><p>Chong he sighed. “Even a grandmaster would be weakened by the suppression of humanity’s fate there.”</p><p>The two continued to move forward and entered the main street. There were more people passing by, and they could see all kinds of goods from all over the world, but there were fewer sellers and more people displaying them, the shops around were also dominated by restaurants and daily grocery stores.</p><p>Chong he noticed that many people were holding strange things in their hands. Some were talking to it, and some were smiling at it foolishly. It was quite strange.</p><p>“That is?”Chong he asked shamelessly.</p><p>“The Universal Knowledge Talisman. It’s a little thing that junior made. It can help people communicate with each other from thousands of miles away. It can exchange things…”Meng Qi casually took out a piece of paper and introduced all kinds of functions to chong he.</p><p>Chong he listened in a daze. It took him a long time to come back to his senses. He sighed with emotion:</p><p>“This thing is really magical. When mortals hold it, it’s somewhat different from the legends. It’s far better than the ancient times…”</p><p>Then he thought about the people he saw along the way. Although some of them had bitter expressions and not everything went as they wished, they all looked vigorous. He immediately exhaled in relief. “It’s better than what I wish…”</p><p>Without looking any further, he flew up and headed back to the pure Yang sect. However, he was afraid of being close to his hometown, so he did not dare to fall behind.</p><p>Meng Qi casually introduced the changes in the sects and aristocratic families. Finally, he said, “The pure Yang sect has an unending heritage. However, with the current situation and the spread of martial arts, it is no longer so easy to recruit outstanding disciples.”</p><p>Chong he pondered for a moment and nodded. “It doesn’t matter. Our sect teaches moral people, and we seek the Dao of nature. We can use this to get rid of those fake Daoists who can’t settle down and can’t endure hardship.”</p><p>Chong he is really broad-minded… Meng Qi couldn’t help but praise him.</p><p>At this moment, a light flashed and the golden-horned boy appeared. He said solemnly,</p><p>“In the name of the Great Master of morality, I summon Chong he to enter Tuoshu Palace to cultivate.”</p><p>“Who is this?”Chong he didn’t recognize the golden-horned boy and hurriedly asked Meng Qi through voice transmission.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and nodded. “The golden-horned boy under the celestial venerable of morality.”</p><p>Chong he was pleasantly surprised. Then, as if he had put down something, he laughed and said casually,</p><p>“I have fulfilled my wish in my life. From now on, I will do immortal and godly things!”</p><p>After saying that, he cupped his hands toward Meng Qi and flew toward the golden-horned boy. The two disappeared into the air.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
