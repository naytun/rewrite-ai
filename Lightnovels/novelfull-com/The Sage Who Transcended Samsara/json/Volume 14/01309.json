It was particularly eye-catching in the dark and deep empty space, as if it could cover the vast expanse.</p><p>As a great god ranked in the ancient heavenly court, “Nine heavens mystical maiden”Liu Luo was not unfamiliar with this. Her expression was solemn as she whispered, “Jian Mu…”</p><p>Jian Mu was born according to the Dao. It was connected to the roots and connected to all worlds. It was the skeleton and support of the Nine Heavens of the immortal world.</p><p>As she spoke, she looked at the tree of Great Dao in Meng Qi’s hand from the corner of her eyes. Although she had heard of it, she had just met it and felt that it was similar to Jian Mu.</p><p>Was her current reaction the resonance between the two?</p><p>Because the tree of Great Dao could absorb the tree of Great Dao and devour all sorts of special things in the immortal world, Meng Qi was only slightly surprised by the strange scene before her before she returned to normal. Many boundless and whimsical thoughts emerged in her mind.</p><p>This world was the highest level of the nine heavens. It was the place that was closest to the path and also the top of the tree of Great Dao. Would it bear fruit here?</p><p>And what magical fruit would it bear?</p><p>The ancient Fusang tree was planted by an unknown person. It imitated the tree of Great Dao and was nourished by the blood of Haotian God and Donghuang Taiyi. After the destruction of the previous era, it was born at the beginning of this era, as if it was going to replace the JIANMU, of the two fruits it bore, one was the true body of Emperor Qing and the other helped Emperor Qing attain the Dao. From this to the other, if the JIANMU had fruit, how precious would it be!</p><p>Which part of the tree that resonated with the Great Dao was the tree? Wasn’t it afraid of being melted and absorbed?</p><p>As these thoughts flashed through Meng Qi’s mind, he heard Liu Luo Sigh:</p><p>“Things are troublesome. I could have approached without anyone noticing, but now I have to face the snatching of other great divine powers.”</p><p>This should be the leftovers left behind by the great personages on the other shore and the current Green Emperor, right?</p><p>She had just finished speaking when she saw Meng Qi jump out of the Big Dipper Emperor Chariot. He laughed loudly and said,</p><p>“What a troublesome matter!”</p><p>As he laughed, a somersault cloud rose under his feet. His body turned into a streak of light as he headed straight for the place where the “Clear spring spouted.”.</p><p>It was difficult for the other side of the river to be everywhere in this world, let alone a great divine ability user. In terms of speed, how could the patrolling big dipper emperor chariot compare to Meng Qi himself?</p><p>Previously, they did not know what their destination was or where they were going. They had to rely on the Big Dipper’s direction. Now that they were closer and resonating with each other, they had already lit up the path!</p><p>This thought flashed across Liu Luo’s mind. He had already made his decision. He turned into a wisp of dense mysterious light and with an aura that could break through the Void and darkness, he followed closely behind Meng Qi as they flew into the depths that were close to reality and far away.</p><p>Su Meng was right earlier. They had already retreated before any difficulties had even appeared. What right did they have to fight for the opportunity and fight for a sliver of Hope in the Apocalypse?</p><p>The two beams of light, one in front and one behind, drew closer and closer to the clear light. One could vaguely make out a giant tree swaying its branches and leaves, which could not be described in terms of color. It stood tall in the void, and its roots stretched out to an unknown place. One could not see its roots at all, the branches stretched out without an end, as if they were supporting this immortal domain. Each branch and leaf no longer contained a universe. The Milky Way Nebula formed its own world. Instead, each of them had its own color. Some were crimson like fire, and some were dark like water, purple Lightning gathered, some were green and vibrant. It was as if they were the condensation of different illusory great daos. At the very top, it was hazy, as if it had turned into chaos. No one knew where it was connected to.</p><p>This giant tree was now covered in a layer of green and grey. It was mostly in decay. It was like an empty shell that was barely holding on. What was even more obvious was that the leaves that were more compatible with life and longevity had all withered.</p><p>At this moment, a golden light flashed and a huge black shadow approached from another direction. It was even faster than Meng Qi. It was the Demon King Roc of the Heaven Battering Grand Sage, who was famous for his speed.</p><p>He did not harm anyone and tried to stop Meng Qi. He only glanced at Meng Qi and was ready to fly towards Jian Mu.</p><p>Hey, if you want to compete with me in flying, even the Monkey King Grand Sage is no match for you, let alone someone who has just entered the destiny realm!</p><p>I shall take the lead!</p><p>Seeing this, the purple lightning flashed in Meng Qi’s hand. The absolute blade was already in his hand. He shouted loudly,</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, please wait!”</p><p>The brilliant lightning slashed out, illuminating the Void and darkness. Demon Roc King did not have time to flap his wings and fly far away. He felt as if there were many shackles around him. The heavy feeling tightly bound his body. The flight of light immediately slowed down. What was even more terrifying was that.., it was as if his own body and the terrifying purple lightning blade had a yin-yang attraction, as if they would fly back at any moment.</p><p>Purple Lightning generated primordial magnetism!</p><p>Using this attraction, Meng Qi’s escape light suddenly increased in speed. He was about to leap past Demon King Roc and take the lead once again.</p><p>However, Demon King Roc dominated the ancient times and was known as a great sage. It was not easy. Hatred grew in his heart. He had eaten countless Mohou Luojia and dragon race members before. He opened his mouth and spat out a ball of black and white light, which contained seven treasures, the eight trigrams of the dark talisman had 24 qi. It could reverse yin and Yang and turn the enemy into a pool of blood.</p><p>At the same time, the ox demon king with two horns took the opportunity to fly over. He was slightly faster than Liuluo. Then, he revealed his cosmic form and covered all directions, the mixed metal rod in his hand gathered all the power and slashed at Meng Qi with an aura that could tear through the collapsing void.</p><p>“Good timing!”</p><p>Facing the pincer attacks of the two ancient grand sages, Meng Qi was not afraid. Instead, he was delighted. As he shouted, the absolute blade in his right hand suddenly turned hard into soft and fell down. With the Lightning as the source of yin-yang life and death, a dense net of blade light was created, black and white alternated and changed continuously. They gently stuck onto the “Yin-yang two qi”that Demon King Roc spat out.</p><p>Black mixed with Yang, white swallowed Yin. The “Yin and Yang Qi”was forcibly neutralized by Meng Qi’s yin-yang Life and Death Dao and absorbed into his body under the layers of the saber net!</p><p>Taking advantage of this momentum, Meng Qi’s body grew rapidly. He also performed the heavenly phenomenon ground. His body was pale gold, like a creator of the world. His left hand clenched into a fist, condensing the combined strength of himself and Demon Roc King into a single point, he struck the rod of mixed metal in a plain and unadorned manner!</p><p>Everything returned to the Void and darkness grew. Everything seemed to return to chaos and return to its original state.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Demon Ox King’s rod of mixed metal flew backwards and specks of light fell down. His huge heavenly dharma body was shaken a million miles away, as if it had turned into a black dot.</p><p>The two demon Grand Sages, who were already famous when he was young, were not at a disadvantage at all. Meng Qi felt his body and mind be at ease. As he laughed out loud, he used the momentum of the collision to charge straight towards the light-covered JIANMU.</p><p>Suddenly, the water-colored glass in front of him rippled and an ancient and young Golden Buddha appeared. It was the unfettered King Buddha who had revealed his dharma body.</p><p>He pressed his palms together and his voice reverberated through the Void and darkness:</p><p>“Benefactor, please stop.”</p><p>The golden “Buddha”words, which were interwoven with different zen auras, protruded out from between his brows. The surroundings instantly became sticky. It was as if the chaotic time had finally curled up and solidified, forming a relic.</p><p>The dao of time! Meng Qi’s heart stirred, and he became abnormally solemn.</p><p>He did not expect that the unfettered King Buddha, an ancient Buddha who had lived for an unknown number of eras, would actually comprehend the will of the void and condense an illusory great dao of time!</p><p>Only by being able to control time could one be at ease!</p><p>Among great divine arts practitioners, this could be considered cheating. Just thinking about the seven kills stele going back in time and influencing the enemy’s strength was enough to tell one or two things!</p><p>As expected of the legendary Amitabha’s teacher!</p><p>Everything seemed to slow down. The scene Meng Qi saw was already blurry. and in the eyes of Demon King Roc, Demon King Ox, mystical maiden of the nine heavens, and other newcomers, he was like a mosquito frozen in amber, he moved forward in a very slow manner.</p><p>At this moment, a Qingyun rushed out from above Meng Qi’s head. It was dark and chaotic, spreading like fog and condensing into a point, pulling and curling everything and all logic within.</p><p>Creak, Creak, Creak. The surrounding river of time was like a rusty wheel that was being pulled. Invisible cracks appeared on the transparent “Amber”.</p><p>The combination of the characteristics of the other shore and the limitless seal was truly extraordinary… the world’s carefree king Buddha secretly praised as his golden body suddenly disappeared.</p><p>In the eyes of Bull Demon King, Roc Demon King, and the mystical maiden of the nine heavens, he was only temporarily enveloped by the glazed Buddhist light. His figure could not be seen. and in Meng Qi’s eyes, in the illusory river of time.., the figure of the world’s carefree king Buddha was flying towards the “Past”. As the light flickered, it was as if it could not last long.</p><p>He either did not make a move, but once he made a move, he did not hold back and unleashed his most powerful divine ability!</p><p>If he could not sense the erosion of the river of time, he would not have realized that the world’s carefree king Buddha had once disappeared.</p><p>Back then, Meng Qi had used the seven kills stele to get rid of the tower lord of the heartless building. He did not expect to face the same thing today.</p><p>Fortunately, there was no time for his family to be weak in the upper echelons of the immortal world!</p><p>Just as Meng Qi had this thought, a green sword light sliced through the air. The intent to kill Immortals and destroy Buddhas condensed into a point and landed on the spot where the world’s unfettered King Buddha was enveloped by the clear glass light.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, are you bullying the Hollow Jade Temple?”Guang Chengzi’s voice reverberated in the distance.</p><p>Immediately after, one sword light after another lit up, illuminating this world.</p><p>Upon hearing this, Meng Qi smiled. The disturbance caused by the resonance had indeed attracted the hollow jade temple’s fellow disciples.</p><p>That was why he said, “Good trouble!”!</p><p>Speaking of ganging up, it wasn’t that they looked down on the Buddhist and demon factions, but the hollow jade temple had never been afraid of any of them!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
