The descending heavenly punishment axe slowed down, and there seemed to be a gap between the nine dao patterns and the dark end of the world. Moreover, even the various possibilities in the future had silently increased by a lot of variables.</p><p>With the pull of Qi, the purple clouds suddenly soared. On a closer look, they were all the convergence of streaks of thunder patterns. They were the pivot of yin and yang, life and death. They dyed the high sky of the nine Netherworlds into a brilliant ocean, spreading to the past and flowing to the future.</p><p>“Eat my blade!”</p><p>The Roar reverberated. Lightning destroyed thunder. Flowers bloomed and fell. The purple clouds drowned out the pure white and beautiful palm.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The sky above the nine nether world was blazing. Other than that, there was no other color. Only the collision seemed to tear apart time. It was dark and gloomy, as if it was chaotic.</p><p>White lotus petals and lightning shards fell one after another. They were all covered in invisible flames. The universe within had just been born not long ago, and it had already reached its end, everything seemed to be paused under their contrast.</p><p>In the half of the red mountain range, the twelve demon saints and the son of Heaven were moving this place to the depths of the netherworld. Qi Zhengyan looked at the scene in the sky from afar, and for a moment, he felt like he had returned to the Spirit Mountain of the past.</p><p>Who had lost the attack just now?</p><p>As soon as he thought about it, he saw the giant bronze axe break out of the slowly healing chaos and fly into the void outside of the netherworld. It flew into the divine light moon that was slowly stabilizing and changing.</p><p>The Monkey King had won!</p><p>For the first time since they fought, he had won the collision between them!</p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s eyes turned dark red. She was even more demonic, but there was only a little madness, brutality, and chaos for the time being.</p><p>Through the subtle connection, she finally managed to grasp the situation of the battle. She knew that the metal emperor was repelled for the first time, so she deliberately stopped absorbing Meng Qi’s power and slightly retracted her slender and beautiful finger.</p><p>With her current realm and strength, it was obviously unrealistic for her to always interfere with the gold emperor’s perfection. She would slightly adapt to it and reserve her strength to be on guard. The effect would be very poor, so she had to know how to seize the opportunity, she added this chip at the critical moment, such as the moment when the two sides collided, so she had no time to care about the rest of the time!</p><p>It was the king to have Zhang and Chi. He had not lost his brain or intelligence… Gu Xiaosang’s black hair rose like silk. She closed her eyes and sensed the high sky.</p><p>After a short period of peace, the Moon was finally full. The plain-colored cloud flag flew out, and the Heavenly Punishment Axe was once again held by the white and slender hand. It broke through the layers of time and space and fell down with a bang. Darkness appeared in the surroundings, and peace swept across, it was as if it was calling for all things to return and obtain their final liberation.</p><p>The metal emperor seemed to have guessed Gu Xiaosang’s plan. He had both offense and defense, and he did not hold back anymore. He wanted to finish everything in one go!</p><p>The dark violent ape laughed arrogantly and showed three heads and six arms. The Niwan Palace of each head opened up, and beams of pure light shot out, converging into a glazed Buddha country. Inside sat a green-black fallen Buddha, which was completely transparent, the eye between his brows was opened. It could not be worn down even after ten thousand tribulations. It shone through the illusion. At the same time, twenty-four heads of eighteen arms appeared.</p><p>Each of these arms held an absolute blade. It was as if each of them had a different dao of lightning. There was the change of yin and yang, the rotation of life and death, the extreme Yang and the power of punishment. Then, they slashed out together, forming a torrent.</p><p>The more the torrent moved forward, the more it condensed. In the end, only a thin purple lightning remained!</p><p>Without a sound, the purple lightning sank into the dense fog on the ground. Then, it was struck by the heaven-destroying axe.</p><p>At this moment, Gu Xiaosang suddenly opened her eyes. Her finger touched the center of Meng Qi’s brows once again, absorbing that crazy and terrifying power.</p><p>Her eyes burst open, and traces of red blood flowed out. The Bright Moon hanging outside the netherworld once again turned from surplus to deficit. However, it only lasted for one time, and it lasted for an instant!</p><p>However, when they fought on the other side, how could the momentary wavering be ordinary?</p><p>The Darkness collapsed and the tranquility shattered. The heaven-destroying axe and the plain-colored cloud realm flag were pushed out of the nine netherworld by the “Zixia”. The equal-heaven Grand Sage’s figure crashed heavily into the ground and once again shattered a large piece of the ground. Only half of the greenish-black fallen Buddha remained, three heads and six arms were left with one head and three arms. Blood and flesh squirmed and quickly recovered.</p><p>This time, the two sides were tied!</p><p>In the boundless Pure Land, the ancient Buddha with the burning lamp saw this scene. The Golden Brahma flowers around him immediately withered and he blurted out,</p><p>“How do I hide from Emperor Qing and help you escape?”</p><p>Looking at the battle situation, the Golden Emperor was being restrained. He was afraid that he would not be able to win the battle against the Buddha for a while. Moreover, heavenly venerate nine chaos was about to take control of the Devil Emperor’s Claw. If he did not do something now, he would definitely lose the opportunity and regret it!</p><p>Ah Nan was about to speak when he suddenly looked outside the Buddha country. He saw that in the illusory river of time, Emperor Zhenwu was shrouded in the purple light of the primordial sun ruler. He kept looking back and he had arrived before he killed the evil thoughts and asked to be killed.</p><p>However, at this moment, his figure suddenly swayed as if he was eroded by water waves. When he looked back, he saw that the half-formed illusory dao fruit at the current node was crumbling bit by bit.</p><p>The waves surged and surged abruptly, drowning the figure of Emperor Zhenwu. The purple gas kept expanding and contracting, but it was still unable to rush out of the flowing goblet of time.</p><p>“Your comprehension is still a little lacking, just to seize this rare opportunity and rely on the primordial Yang ruler to make a breakthrough?”Ananda revealed a trace of ridicule. “Do you really think that it’s so easy to ascend to the other shore? Relying on external objects is impossible!”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the black mystic water reappeared and filled the heaven and earth. Heavy rain poured down, and a streak of purple light flew out from within, but the figure of Emperor Zhenwu was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Somewhere in the vast starry sky of the real world, the statue of the water ancestor hummed and vibrated. Light burst forth, as if it had been perfected and made up for its deficiencies.</p><p>Heavenly venerate demon subduing, the northern Black Emperor, had failed in his dao attainment and completely perished. Only a few imprints remained in the river of time!</p><p>Ah nan chuckled, “Zhenwu was born into a good family. With the blessings of the Dao venerate, there has always been no lack of external things. He was superior to his peers. I didn’t expect that he had developed the habit of relying on external things. His death was not unjustified.”</p><p>How could the other shore be so easy to achieve?</p><p>Since ancient times, how many heavenly venerates and ancient Buddhas had fallen here!</p><p>In this matter, the most important and most important thing could only be oneself!</p><p>The Purple Qi flew across the sky, passed through the mystic water, and flew toward the Fusang Ancient Tree realm. Emperor Qing took the primordial Yang ruler, and two rays of light shot down and landed in the true martial sect’s ancestral hall.</p><p>The True Martial Sect’s grand elder, Yao Xingliu, was in seclusion here. His heart stirred, and he opened his eyes. Coincidentally, he saw two immortal swords stabbed in front of him. One of them had the Xuanwu turtle shell, which was unusually heavy. The other was shrouded in clear light, and the soaring serpent danced, he had a deep desire to die.</p><p>Faced with the failure of the true martial sect’s Dao attainment, burning lamp was stunned at first. Then, he couldn’t care less about this. His golden body was flowing with light, and he asked again,</p><p>“How can I deceive the Green Emperor and help you escape?”</p><p>Ah Nan shook his head and looked at burning lamp with a mocking gaze:</p><p>“Without the true martial sect’s Dao attainment to distract my attention, how can I deceive the Green Emperor? It’s too late. Fellow Daoist, you must remember one thing in the future. If you don’t make a decision, you will end up in a mess!”</p><p>Burning Lamp’s emotions were obviously fluctuating, but his face suddenly brightened as he looked at the nine serenities once again.</p><p>The bright and cold moon-like treasure light was once again complete. White lotuses floated out from within, all stained with colored glass and the light of Mahayana Buddha, which could help all living things.</p><p>As soon as these white lotuses appeared, the Bright Moon began to ripple. It was as if it was attacked by some strange power and could not maintain its stability. Sun Wukong suddenly felt his legs go soft. The hand holding the absolute blade and the other hand pressed down on his head together, he let out a painful groan and cried out in a heart-wrenching manner,</p><p>“Master!”</p><p>Drops of black tears fell from the corner of his eyes. It was as if he had returned to the time when he traveled to the west.</p><p>The ancient Buddha with the burning lamp blurted out, “Golden cicada!”</p><p>Old Mother Wu Sheng had actually used the mysterious corpse that Shawu Jing had brought out from Mount Ling. It was the golden body molt of the Chentan Merit Buddha. Buddha was one of the products of reducing and seeking emptiness. It was the master and Inner Demon of the Monkey King, Sun Wukong!</p><p>But it was obvious that he had paid a great price!</p><p>Even the other big shots on the other side of the river did not expect him to be able to subdue this thing and borrow its power!</p><p>Taking this opportunity, her jade-white palm held the mighty heavenly punishment axe and chopped down again. The Sky split apart like the sea, and the absolute blade struggled to fly up in the sky without anyone controlling it, it was dyed with endless purple light, a brilliant and despairing purple light.</p><p>Sensing this change, Gu Xiaosang reached out her hand again and touched Meng Qi’s glabella. The corners of her mouth curled up as she said with a smile,</p><p>“After my death, you must be a good widow!”</p><p>She no longer had any scruples and used the wusheng finger to absorb Meng Qi’s power and the flesh of Donghuang crazily. Her own brutal and ruthless will rose steadily, as if she would become a mindless piece of meat at any time.</p><p>Dang!</p><p>The bright moon was waning, but the absolute blade was still repelled. Gu Xiaosang and Meng Qi no longer had any protection. At this moment, a small flag flew out from the Black Emperor’s Daoist rite temple. Golden lotuses bloomed in billions of light, forming an indestructible barrier.</p><p>Yang Jian did not care about anything else. He withstood the Black Emperor’s attack with his indestructible ability and threw out the wuji apricot yellow flag in the center of the world!</p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p>The enchantment shattered, the golden lotus withered, and the Yuxu apricot flag was split apart by the Heavenly Punishment Axe. Together with Gu Xiaosang’s strength, it only delayed mother wusheng for two or three seconds, gu Xiaosang, who had revealed her devilish beauty, ferocity, and madness, and Meng Qi, who was even more brutal and chaotic, were revealed.</p><p>Despair seemed to descend.</p><p>Suddenly, the nine underworlds churned, and demonic qi gushed out. A loud roar came from afar:</p><p>“Get Out!”</p><p>A pitch-black evil palm with six fingers suddenly appeared and pressed down on the side of the Heavenly Punishment Axe. Streams of foul qi were like snakes, constantly trying to erode into it.</p><p>The nine Chaos Celestial Master finally took control of the Devil Emperor’s Claw and attacked the Gold Emperor under the command of the will of the nine underworlds!</p><p>If it were not for Gu Xiaosang’s sacrifice and Yang Jian’s perfect timing, he definitely would not have made it in time!</p><p>“Get Out!”</p><p>The Demon Emperor gripped the heaven’s punishment axe with its claws and pushed it out of the netherworld. It turned the white lotus that was dyed with the light of the Mahayana Buddha into demonic flowers that were watered with blood and filled with black qi.</p><p>The Darkfiend Ape finally recovered. It held the absolute blade again and let out furious roars as if it was questioning the heavens.</p><p>Seeing this, Gu Xiaosang abruptly stopped absorbing and panted heavily. She felt a throbbing pain in her head, affecting her thinking.</p><p>She was only two or three moments away from becoming the puppet of Donghuang. She was only four or five moments away from completely exploding and turning into ashes.</p><p>Indeed, only by facing death could one survive.</p><p>After thinking for a moment, she pointed out with her finger again and reversed the life-less finger. Borrowing the aura of little peach, she returned what she had absorbed to Meng Qi and said with a smile,</p><p>“Husband, one of us has to stay awake. We can only trouble you.”</p><p>Everything became calm. The battle seemed to have finally stopped. The full moon hung outside the nine serenities world, shining with a clear light. It seemed to have recognized the reality and did not attack again.</p><p>In the boundless Pure Land, the ancient Buddha with the burning lamp let out a long sigh. Seeing that the opportunity was coming, he failed.</p><p>Perhaps it was just as the Devil Buddha said, he was not decisive enough. If he did not make a decision, he would be in trouble instead!</p><p>Just as the bystanders thought that the matter was finally over, a luxuriously dressed oracle flew out from the Moon that covered the sky.</p><p>A clear light appeared behind him. His face was old, and he was not smiling. His Majesty was revealed.</p><p>Oracle… Gu Xiaosang was no stranger to the twelve oracles. The dark red in his eyes gradually faded, and he silently muttered the name in his heart.</p><p>The messenger of Oracle’s gaze was like a torch as he looked at Meng Qi, who only had a little instinct left. He said solemnly,</p><p>“Sin immortal Su Meng, I know that you still have some instincts. I would like to ask you, are you willing to part with your family and friends, and Your Foundation in the real world? If you don’t want to watch them be destroyed, then walk out of Hell Yourself!”</p><p>“I believe that Yang Jian and the others will respect your choice!”</p><p>“Roar!”Meng Qi, who only had violence and chaos left in his eyes, seemed to understand the two sentences. He was stunned at first, then he let out a shrill and angry roar that shook the slowly recovering netherworld. The muscles all over his body bulged and turned into arms, he was about to rush up to the clouds and tear the oracle into pieces.</p><p>However, a beautiful and slender hand grabbed his arm. Gu Xiaosang’s temperament was pure and empty, and there was some pity in her eyes as she said,</p><p>“As long as you are alive, you will have a chance to turn the tables!”</p><p>Relying on his instincts, Meng Qi stopped all his actions.</p><p>The messenger looked at him coldly. Suddenly, he turned around and looked at changle. He said in a clear voice,</p><p>“Gao Lan, hand over the human emperor sword and abdicate!”</p><p>In the hall, Gao Lan had stood up a long time ago. He walked like a dragon and walked like a tiger. He looked heroic. At this moment, when he heard the messenger’s commanding order, his expression did not change.</p><p>When he knew that Wu Sheng’s mother had returned early, and that it was inconvenient for the Green Emperor to make a move, he had already guessed that such a scene would occur. Regardless of whether Su Meng was beheaded or not, the Buddhist kingdom and Luoism splitting the great Zhou would be the fated outcome.</p><p>Looking at the round and brilliant moon and the oracle who was using the power of a Fox to intimidate others, images flashed in his mind: the humiliation of being sealed in eternal happiness, the forbearance behind the attainment method, the callousness of many connections.., after seizing the opportunity, the imposing manner of the king and a series of actions finally stopped at the beginning. On the right was the scene of the previous generation’s Xuan Nu suffering a backlash, turning into ashes, and Yan ran never returning. On the left was the scene of Yan ran’s corpse in his arms.., fighting with blood, sweeping away Changle’s memories in the heavy rain.</p><p>He suddenly sighed, and a smile appeared on his cold and indifferent face. It was so gentle and heroic:</p><p>“At the end of the day, I am still a willful hero in my bones!”</p><p>He knew that he should choose to endure it, choose to retreat, and choose to wait for another opportunity to come. However, Gao Lan also knew that even if he handed over the human emperor sword, mother Wusheng might not let him go. He had to get rid of the root of the problem, it was just that there would be an extra glimmer of hope..</p><p>Then he would be willful again!</p><p>The lake of his heart fluctuated slightly as he suddenly rose into the air. The geography of the Great Zhou Mountains and rivers appeared behind him. The Sun, Moon, and stars appeared high in the sky. Countless golden rays surrounded him, and each point of his seemed like a subject.</p><p>“Since we are brothers, then let us go through thick and thin together!”He punched out and roared angrily. The emperor sword on his body had already disappeared without a trace!</p><p>The earth shook, the territory shook, and the people bowed down. The power of all living things transformed into a torrent that converged on his lofty body. It was vast and mighty, and a few times the color of pure gold.</p><p>Don’t you need the power of incense and will?</p><p>Then I’ll let you suffer a backlash from all living things!</p><p>Gao Lan acted on behalf of heaven. His body expanded, leading the torrent to rush toward the bright moon in the sky.</p><p>His vision gradually blurred, as if he had returned to his youth. He was full of emotion, and his body and mind felt comfortable. Therefore, he swore:</p><p>“Mother Wu Sheng, go eat sh * t!”</p><p>The bright moon seemed to grow larger, and the clear splendor filled the world. Gao Lan’s figure gradually blurred, and the torrent of living beings behind him turned into a black mist of resentment, about to be stained by the treasure light.</p><p>The light flourished and then contracted again. The black spots all dissipated, and Gao Lan’s aura was cut off. The Human Emperor’s seal slowly descended, and was caught by the Luo clan’s divine envoys.</p><p>“Compared to the human emperor of the past, you are still far from it…”mother Wu Sheng’s indifferent voice drifted out.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>A faint golden light flashed, and the Human Emperor Sword appeared in the ninth underworld. It stuck in front of Meng Qi and said the last words of Gao Lin:</p><p>“Third brother, take my hope and reach the other shore!”</p><p>With a boom, the mountains and the ground around Meng Qi exploded. He let out a heart-wrenching scream. If Gu Xiaosang had not pulled him with all her strength, he might have already run out of the ninth underworld.</p><p>The Messenger of Oracle looked at Shaolin Xuanbei. Thinking that it was related to Buddhism, he moved his eyes away and looked at the sword-washing pavilion.</p><p>Su Wuming suddenly opened his eyes. He was about to pull out his sword when his disciple’s voice suddenly rang in his ears:</p><p>“Master, let me out. Don’t implicate the sect.”</p><p>As soon as he said that, an extremely pure sword light rose from the cave in the distance. Jiang Zhiwei seemed to have forgotten everything in the world. She was the only sword in the world.</p><p>She had actually used this opportunity to step into the legendary realm, and was about to witness a strange phenomenon.</p><p>At this time, she only had eyes for the oracle, and only the scene of her few companions meeting for the first time. She only had the scene of the mountain flowers in full bloom back then, and every step she took was a dead end.</p><p>She did not regret their meeting back then, nor did she regret her choice back then, nor did she regret the situation she was in now.</p><p>The sword light suddenly soared, and it actually made the senior legendary oracle flustered. However, the bright moon shone down, and the white rainbow disintegrated inch by inch. Without Wind, it disappeared, and Jiang Zhiwei and the sword died together.</p><p>In the nine serenities realm, Meng Qi suddenly stopped howling. His knees went weak, as if he could no longer support himself. He kneeled on the ground.</p><p>The Messenger of Oracle snorted coldly and turned his gaze to the Langya Ruan family.</p><p>Ding Ding Dong Dong, the sound of the zither was long and melodious. It was like a thread of love that spun a thousand times. Ruan Yushu placed her hands on the zither. Her black and white eyes were clearly closed, and two drops of crystal-clear tears flowed from the corners of her eyes.</p><p>Then, she destroyed her true spirit, and the zither became the final song.</p><p>Meng Qi covered his head with both hands and leaned heavily on the ground. It was so quiet in the chaos and madness.</p><p>The Messenger of God struck out and shattered the hollow jade temple of Kunlun Mountain. The sacred place of Taoism Yesterday, which the world looked up to, had become a pile of ruins.</p><p>Just as he was looking for Meng Qi’s disciples, Xiao Tianquan, and great green root, he saw a circle of divine light rising from the Fusang Ancient Tree realm. Emperor Qing’s slightly tired voice was heard:</p><p>“The Karma has been cleared. Quit while you’re ahead.”</p><p>The Full Moon’s light quieted down for a moment and slowly disappeared into the horizon. The messenger quickly returned to his hometown in the vacuum.</p><p>“Ah!”</p><p>In the netherworld, Meng Qi suddenly raised his head and let out a heart-wrenching, bone-deep howl. His face, which had bulging blood vessels, was full of mottled spots.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang listened quietly and waited for him to calm down. Then, she put away the absolute saber and the Emperor Sword, held his hand, and walked toward the depths of the Netherworld step by step. Her gentle voice was getting farther and farther away:</p><p>“The human emperor sword can be used to suppress your flesh and blood and help you recover</p><p>“When you reach the other side, you can turn the tables.”</p><p>The two figures completely disappeared, leaving behind a desolate and deathly stillness. The first level of the Netherworld could no longer return to its original state. However, in the real world, everything was different. The Hollow Jade Temple, the immortal Emperor Yuan Huang, and the current human emperor were all different, the rain blew and the wind blew.</p><p>The fireworks would fade, and the music would stop.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
