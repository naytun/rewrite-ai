From now on, it’s a matter of immortals and gods… Meng Qi chewed on the two sentences that Daoist chong he recited. At the same time, he looked down at the vast expanse of the Earth. Everything was peaceful and convenient. It was absolutely different from decades ago, when humanity was at its peak.</p><p>The core source of the change was precisely the ten thousand worlds he had created. Every time he saw this, he naturally felt a sense of accomplishment, satisfaction, and pride.</p><p>However, the end of the era was near. How long could such a beautiful scene last? Ten years, fifty years, a hundred years? When that time came, everything would be reduced to ashes, and all his efforts would be wasted. The universal mall would “Collapse”. There would be no discussion on the forums, and the live streaming of the videos would be dead silent. The communication group would always be quiet..</p><p>Just thinking about it made him feel melancholic and emotional.</p><p>Holding back his thoughts, Meng Qi returned to the Hollow Jade Temple of Kunlun Mountain and sent a message to the acupuncture point on his left hand to prevent him from barging in recklessly. It was a critical moment for Xiao Sang’s cultivation.</p><p>After a short while, Gu Xiao sang’s thoughts seeped out, and Meng Qi’s supernatural awareness sunk in. He transformed into a human and stepped on the acupuncture point.</p><p>The clear light before his eyes was hazy, like chaos and nothingness, like the home of all living things. Gu Xiao sang stood at the core of the home of all living things. The white lotus beneath her feet floated and she slowly approached as if she was on a small boat.., gu Xiaosang smiled and said, “My husband must have something to discuss. That’s why he came here.”</p><p>“Aren’t you afraid that I’ll disturb your meditation?”Meng Qi was still not sure what Gu Xiaosang was thinking.</p><p>“Do you only dare to disturb me when I’m discussing something?”Gu Xiaosang’s eyebrows became more delicate, and her temperament became more ethereal. At this moment, her eyes were gloomy, as if she was crying.</p><p>Meng Qi felt awkward, but he changed his mind. He was about to take this opportunity to attack Gu Xiaosang, but he saw Gu Xiaosang smile. Her resentment just now was like ripples on the surface of the water.</p><p>“My husband must have encountered something extremely important,”she said in a confident tone.</p><p>Meng Qi did not know whether he was relieved or disappointed. He stopped thinking and told the story of what happened at the highest level of the ninth heaven. He did not care about the details or the details, so as not to miss any clues.</p><p>“As expected of the heavenly emperor who can suppress his whole life. The crafty rabbit has three holes, and he has made it look real and fake.”Gu Xiaosang was the first to sigh with emotion at the Heavenly Emperor’s arrangement. Then, her eyes moved as nimbly as water, “The demon master comes from both sides and uses his strength to fight. With a flip of his hand, he can turn the clouds and rain his hands. In the end, I’m afraid he still can’t escape the fate of being a dowry for others. Let’s see if he can find a chance to survive with the help of the Bodhi magical tree and the nine forms of tathagata palm.”</p><p>“I wonder where the Emperor of Heaven is reincarnated now. Maybe it really is Han Guang?”Meng Qi speculated casually.</p><p>“If Han Guang really is the reincarnation of the heavenly emperor, the grass on his grave would have been as green as this. Otherwise, he would have been a Buddhist novice monk in the Elysium World and a boy listening to the Dao in Dou Shuai Palace. Why would he have given him so many opportunities?”Gu Xiaosang’s face shone with a clear light, there was actually a hint of the holiness and majesty of an Emperor. “The Apocalypse doesn’t need a real heavenly emperor.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded and said with a smile, “Where do you think the Heavenly Emperor’s true return is set up?”</p><p>“I can guess it, but how can the people on the other side not guess it? Therefore, my guess is all wrong. I just feel that there might be clues hidden in the Jade Emperor Mountain, the remains of the heavenly court, and the blade of time.”Gu Xiaosang smiled faintly, “The matter of the Heavenly Emperor will not affect you for a while. The most important thing is still the eight-character maxim that the ancient Fusang tree gave you. Once this calamity is over, you will certainly soar to the sky. Otherwise, you will become a stepping stone for others and be reduced to ashes.”</p><p>“Where do you think the calamity comes from? This eight-character maxim is like a curse that is better than a reminder…”Meng Qi had some thoughts and speculations on his own, but he planned to listen to Gu Xiaosang’s analysis first.</p><p>Regarding the incident on the other shore, she, who had inherited a lot of memories and knowledge from the metal emperor, definitely knew more than he did.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang held her cheek with her right hand. The smile on her face disappeared, and her gaze was calm, the ethereal and elegant beauty was difficult to describe. “From a normal perspective, you are the current Hierarch of the Hollow Jade Temple and support the human emperor. That person in the ancient fusang tree also has the favor of attaining Dao. Your stance has been set, and your enemies and allies are clear. Although that Buddha in the western paradise and that ancient Buddha in the Bodhi Pure Land have different attitudes toward the Buddhist kingdom on Earth, neither of them would be happy to see the human emperor succeed and occupy the key point of the final tribulation. Moreover, you have eliminated one of the ancient Buddha’s three corpses. The Karma between the two sides is extremely heavy. At the critical moment, they will certainly block the two people from Dou Shuai palace and the ancient Fusang Tree.”</p><p>“The human emperor is broad-minded and has the ambition to accommodate the demi-humans. That person is also the ancestor of the human race, so his attitude will definitely be gentler. Perhaps he will help you. As for the remaining people on the other side, the one from vacuum hometown, the Devil Buddha sealed in Mount Lingshan, and the Eastern Emperor who may still be alive, they all have enough reasons to help you, especially the one from vacuum hometown. He has been a great benefactor to the emperor of the ancient Fusang tree who achieved the dao. They have a good relationship in the past. If he makes things difficult for you, that person from the ancient fusang tree will probably not be able to help you. Therefore, that ancient celestial venerable from Tuoba Palace and the ancestor of the human race will not be able to help you.”</p><p>The Devil Buddha was sealed, so there was no problem for him to mention his name directly.</p><p>Meng Qi frowned slightly and did not hide his doubts. “The premise is that the other side has completely returned from the chaos.”</p><p>It was obvious that it was still far from that time node.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang smiled again, with a hint of ridicule, she said, “Husband, do you know when the other side has returned? “And even if I do, it’s only their initial plan. At this realm, which is almost against common sense, they really can’t find a way to return a little earlier?”</p><p>“That makes sense.”Meng Qi nodded solemnly. Some things couldn’t be too certain, just in case they were caught off guard.</p><p>“And this is a normal analysis. Why is heaven’s will so hard to predict? The root is that the other side can peek into all kinds of possibilities in the future. What they know and grasp are far better than the rest. It seems impossible to predict and imagine, but it’s just because you don’t know enough.”Gu Xiaosang’s eyes were dark and bright, “For example, at this moment, the ancient Celestial Master of Dou Shuai Palace suddenly sent down the Taiji diagram and turned you into ashes.”</p><p>“How is this possible?”Meng Qi asked in surprise.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang smiled and glanced at him. “Why is it impossible? “For example, after passing this critical juncture, all kinds of possible changes will occur in the future. When the person in Dou Shuai Palace realizes that you will inevitably betray the human emperor and become a Buddhist guardian in the future, it’s better to get rid of the hidden dangers in advance and change the future.”</p><p>“Heaven’s will is hard to predict because you can’t see far ahead of them.”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s words removed a lot of the mystery of the other shore, reducing Meng Qi’s hidden fear by a lot, but from this, he was even more confused. “In this way, other than that person in the old tree of Fusang, the others on the other shore may become my doom. There’s simply no way to guard against this…”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang burst into laughter like the moon breaking through the clouds. “Husband, you said yourself that you want to get rid of that person in the old tree of Fusang? Why do you want to get rid of him?”</p><p>“Because I owe him the favor of attaining dao…”at this point, Meng Qi was stunned and blurted out, “Oh right, Karma!”</p><p>Gu Xiaosang said with a faint smile, “Karma is the most important thing on the other shore. My dear husband, you should have heard of something similar. Why do you value it? If you don’t understand karma, what is there to talk about reducing and seeking emptiness? And every important figure who can attain the other shore has his heart set on the Dao, and his eyes are only on the dao fruit! Therefore, before you completely end the favor of that person from the ancient tree of Fusang, even if he would not help you, he would never harm you. For example, if you took on the identity of Li Dan, preached the dao and ascended to godhood, that person from Dou Shuai palace would not make things difficult for you before giving you sufficient benefits</p><p>“Husband, in this calamity, you have to improve yourself as soon as possible, and at the same time, you have to make more good friends and fewer enemies.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly. He already had an idea in his mind, so he continued to ask, “What is the meaning of the eight-character maxim of the old tree of Fusang?”</p><p>There was no way out, there was no way out, there was no way out, there was no way out at all!</p><p>“There is no way out, there is no way out…”Gu Xiaosang whispered these eight words and asked in return, “Husband, let’s not talk about whether it is a maxim or not. Just these eight words, what can you associate with it?”</p><p>“What can I think of? There’s No Way Out in heaven, no way in Earth, the one from my hometown, the afterlife, the netherworld…”Meng Qi said one by one, “Could it be that the key to the catastrophe lies in the struggle in the Netherworld?”</p><p>“It’s possible, but it might also be to let you die once to resolve the catastrophe,”Gu Xiaosang suggested another point of view.</p><p>Die once? I have no past life and no next life. Doesn’t this mean that I’m completely gone? Meng Qi fell into deep thought.</p><p>At this moment, Gu Xiaosang lazily covered her mouth and yawned:</p><p>“Hubby, the disaster is getting closer and closer. I’ve also successfully cultivated in seclusion. I have to go out to temper myself and prepare myself.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
