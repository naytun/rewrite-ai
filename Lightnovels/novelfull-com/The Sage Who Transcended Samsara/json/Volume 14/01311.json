Wherever it passed, nothing remained, and there was nowhere to hide.</p><p>“Even a grain of rice is shining!”He snorted coldly. Five white waves surged above his head, and the five illusory green lotuses that were clustered around him immediately shone brightly. They were either killing, destroying, or melting. They were all signs of the end, they enveloped the surroundings in a clear and silent light, neutralizing the sword Qi that could destroy all things, but they did not move at all.</p><p>After turning through the array gate and arriving at the immortal execution citadel, the heavenly venerate of treasures saw Guang Chengzi, who was high up in the sky. A green immortal sword was hanging on top of him.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, what’s the matter?”Guang Chengzi bowed. The immortal execution sword shook, and immediately, green sword light fell. The surroundings became heavy, and all colors faded away. All that was left was a hazy gray, as if it had lost the passage of time.</p><p>The pause in time made the sword light extremely fast, making it feel like it was approaching from all directions. The green light was ethereal, like the wind in a dream, but once it hit, the immortal would also be turned into ashes.</p><p>The heavenly venerate of treasures felt his body gradually slowing down, and he did not dare to be negligent. Four strange-colored divine swords flew out from his back, red, green, black, and white, as if they were the reappearance of the extermination and slaughter.</p><p>“Guang Chengzi, this is the celestial extermination sword formation!”His words were like thunder, rolling and rolling. The four divine swords actually merged with the three illusory green lotuses that symbolized different ways of ending. They formed a sword formation that shattered Earth, fire, water, and wind around him.</p><p>This was not the end. Another ray of light rushed out from heavenly lord of many treasures’Niwan Palace. It turned into an ancient and terrifying four-colored formation map and flew into the sword formation.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Guang Chengzi only felt that everything in front of him was dark. The Void was no longer there and time was turbulent. All matter had disintegrated into energy and all of the basic powers, rules, and morals had completely disappeared.</p><p>What a complete celestial eradication sword formation! He praised it in his heart and also revealed the top three flowers. They attracted the light from Chi sperm, perfected jade tripod, and Dao Xing immortal venerable’s respective swords gate. They destroyed each other with destruction, ended each other, and firmly suppressed the heavenly venerate of treasures.</p><p>At the same time, in the palaces of the trapping, killing, and other sword formations, the burning lamp ancient Buddha stepped on the Golden Lotus, and a sea of bitterness appeared around him. Layers of perfect Buddhist light overlapped behind his head, reflecting the boundless pure land that spanned billions of tribulations, the ancient glass lamp that reflected Mount Meru’s lamp completely covered its own karma in the black and white light. Hence, the destruction of the void bypassed him, and the time turbulence, whether fast or slow, passed by his golden body, the sword Qi of eradication was a hair’s breadth away, but he was not easy. The speed of his advance was rather slow. It could only be said that he had the upper hand and had yet to gain the upper hand.</p><p>Compared to him and the heavenly venerate of many treasures, the world’s carefree king Buddha was more relaxed. The “Buddha”character between his brows was formed by the interweaving of golden ten thousand characters that were like Sariras. It stirred up illusory time, and the four great realms were empty, walking in the red, green, black, and white sword Qi was like traveling in an illusion.</p><p>The Sword Qi twisted and everything turned to ashes. However, the unfettered King Buddha of the world swayed, as if he was in the past that could not be interfered with by the sword formation. As for the rest, he had no choice but to avoid them because of the chaotic flow of time, or he could take it head-on with “Weng”, “Ma”, “Ba”, “Mi”, “Hum”.</p><p>The “Body of the old Taoist sect”that the ancient Buddha of burning lamp slashed out was not as dangerous as that of a perfected great divine arts practitioner. The Exquisite Golden Pagoda on top of his head shone, and it was slashed into pieces by the red, green, black, and white sword Qi. There were wounds everywhere, it seemed that it would not be long before it collapsed. Moreover, the void that was either solidified or destroyed and the terrifying time turbulence made him unable to move forward. He could only Dodge.</p><p>Fortunately, Daoist burning lamp clearly knew that he was only involved in this journey. He allowed the heavenly venerate of many treasures, the unfettered King Buddha of the world, and his original body to break the formation. He was neither anxious nor impatient. He wielded the heaven and Earth ruler and performed the Jade Void yin-yang Seal, borrowing the Void to return to the real, turning death into life, he could barely hold on.</p><p>Outside the immortal-slaying sword formation, consort three firmament had already unleashed the golden dipper of the origin and joined hands to set up the nine-bend Yellow River Formation. The sleeves of celestial venerate Wen Shu Guangfa fluttered in the wind. The five flowers of wisdom above his head gradually faded away, leaving only the center, which was like a round mirror, with the heart of immovable emptiness, she reflected all the things in the world and the moral and legal principles, reflecting all the changes in the nine-bend Yellow River Formation.</p><p>“Only by cutting off the leading edge can one know the emptiness, and cast the dao body without dirtiness or cleanness!”She murmured and slowly stepped into the formation.</p><p>The Chaos Golden Dipper in the High Sky Shook, and immediately, a light shot down and went straight for Celestial Master Wen Shu’s Niwan, intending to seal off the flower on her head and the five Qi in her chest.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>With a crisp and melodious sound, the round mirror formed by wisdom inherited the magical effect of vacuum and contained all things. It showed a hazy and chaotic color, and it shot the chaos gold bucket to the side, leaving only traces in the mirror.</p><p>Her unique way of the infinite chaos was different from Meng Qi’s. At this time, if it were the true supreme infinite origin Shi Qingyun, the strange light shot down by the chaos gold bucket would silently drill into it, disappear, and be contained and assimilated, returning to its original state, it would not have any effect. On the other hand, the “Innate wisdom mirror”, which was completed using the emptiness of Buddhism and the wisdom of the Great Circle Mirror as a reference, would not be touched by external objects. However, it would leave a mark in the vacuum and be included in the inclusion.</p><p>Seeing this situation, consort three firmament each had a solemn heart. She did not dare to be negligent. The nine Zigzag Yellow River Formation was activated and fused with the light of the chaotic golden light. It turned into a turbid wave that surged toward Celestial Master Wen Shu Guangfa one after another. If it was most of the good fortune.., if one was tainted by it, there would be a cycle of reincarnation. One would disappear and the other would fade. It would not take long for the immortal body to fade away and return to the mortal body. After many years of cultivation, one would die.</p><p>“There are many treasures heavenly venerate, ancient Buddha and others who have broken in. I’m afraid that the immortal-slaying sword formation is already at the end of its tether. We are like adding oil to the fire. It will be broken in an instant and we can take advantage of the chaos.”A Luoism messenger transmitted his voice to his fellow disciples, the demon Grand Sage and the remnant gods of the heavenly court.</p><p>Bull Demon King wanted to reach the peak of the destiny realm like never before. Hearing this, he nodded his huge head and said,</p><p>“I agree!”</p><p>“The mystical maiden of the nine heavens”Liu Luo rubbed the virtual seal of authority in her hand and sighed. She turned around and left. She did not want to get involved in this matter anymore.</p><p>..</p><p>“May I know who this important person is?”Meng Qi was extremely interested in the matter mentioned by the Green Emperor.</p><p>Although the distant primordial era had been extinct for a long time, there were still remnants of it, and it had a mysterious connection with many things. It wouldn’t be a bad thing if he could learn more about it.</p><p>The azure emperor’s back was facing him as he looked at Jian Mu. His tone was emotionless as he spoke:</p><p>“Heavenly Emperor.”</p><p>“Heavenly Emperor?”Meng Qi was slightly stunned. Wasn’t the fusang ancient tree planted with the blood of the Donghuang Taiyi and Heavenly Emperor?</p><p>Emperor Qing said slowly, “In the last era of the immemorial era, the tree of Great Dao was born and fell into the hands of Heavenly God. After he killed Donghuang Taiyi, he mixed his remaining blood with his own and planted the ancient fusang tree in a secret place. It seemed like he wanted to replace the peach tree with the plum tree and use it to replace his own death to complete the end of the era so that he could pass the tribulation peacefully.”</p><p>“I have yet to trace back to the immemorial era, so I’m not sure. All I know is that the Fusang ancient tree was not destroyed, and the Heavenly God died. The few elders did not destroy it because one of the keys to the final tribulation was also the tree of Great Dao. They wanted to observe the changes of the ancient tree and make preparations. That was how I was born.”</p><p>“After my divine body was formed, I coincidentally obtained the broken supreme heavenly mirror and refined it into a peerless item. This made many people who knew about it suspect that the heavenly God did not really die and was reincarnated as the Green Emperor Taihao with the help of the Fusang ancient tree.”</p><p>“Hearing your description, I even suspect that you are the reincarnation of the heavenly god…”Meng Qi could not help but curse in his heart. He was born from the Fusang ancient tree planted by the Heavenly God and obtained the treasure that allowed the heavenly God to achieve Dao, if there was no connection between the two, who would believe it?</p><p>Of course, it might not be reincarnation. Perhaps he was a descendant?</p><p>There was a rare smile in Emperor Qing’s tone. “In ancient times, I even suspected that it was the reincarnation of the Haotian God. I was quite worried that I would be possessed by him and lose my self-consciousness. However, I found the other side. After looking back, I realized that I am me. I am Emperor Qing, Taihao, not the reincarnation of the Haotian God. He once had such an arrangement, but I don’t know which ancient man destroyed it. Something went wrong and the connection was broken at the end of the epoch.”</p><p>Who would have thought that the azure emperor would be so pure and innocent? Meng Qi thought back to his family’s fear of the Devil Buddha and felt a sense of regret. Fortunately, his family’s matter was true.., but he found an opportunity to cut off the past and the future.</p><p>“But the secrets of the ancient Fusang Tree Don’t stop there.”The azure emperor changed the topic.</p><p>“You don’t even know the seniors who were born in the ancient Fusang Tree?”Meng Qi asked doubtfully.</p><p>Emperor Qing nodded slightly:</p><p>“Of course. Otherwise, what would the elders be observing? However, I have a vague feeling that one of the two foundations of the ancient fusang tree, Donghuang Taiyi, who was killed by Haotian, might not have truly fallen.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
