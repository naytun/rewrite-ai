The Asura primogenitor and the other evil demon gods were stunned when they heard it. The blood demon was actually transformed from Yang Jian, the supreme true monarch of the Pure Source Mystic Dao?</p><p>It was no wonder that he had advanced by leaps and bounds after his return. Very quickly, he reached the perfection of creation and attained the realm of the pseudo-nirvana realm!</p><p>Previously, they had thought that he had obtained Daoist Tiansha’s remains by chance. After the inherent devouring and plundering of the blood sea, he had achieved such an achievement. Who knew that it was merely an eighty-nine transformation. It was originally such a realm!</p><p>The Blood Sea was like a cloud, dyeing the sky red and turning the river red. A clear laughter came from within:</p><p>“Ancient Buddha really has good eyesight!”</p><p>“In order to hide from you, I really devoured Daoist Tiansha’s remains!”</p><p>Ancient Buddha?</p><p>Not only Asura and the other evil demon gods who could only watch on the sidelines were inexplicably shocked. Even unparalleled demon lord and Daoist seven kills, who were trying their best to prevent heavenly venerate nine chaos from obtaining the demon emperor’s claws, were stunned and terrified.</p><p>Black Heaven Emperor was one of the Bodhi ancient Buddha’s three corpses? The most mysterious one?</p><p>At the beginning of the New Age, this old man had replaced the original Black Heaven Emperor with his three corpses? Without anyone knowing?</p><p>Fortunately, he had learned about it in advance today, or he would have been tricked in the future!</p><p>Time was chaotic and blood shadows were everywhere. Yang Jian stepped into another layer of the nine Netherworld and fought fiercely with Black Heaven Emperor outside his Daoist Hall.</p><p>Under Meng Qi’s protection, Gu Xiaosang’s vision and senses had long been cut off by the aftershocks of the other world. It was difficult for her to know what was happening elsewhere. At that moment, she muttered to herself,</p><p>“Sun Wukong’s appearance in the Netherworld is not unexpected. Yang Jian will most likely descend here as well. Only here do they have the ability to interfere with the chess game on the other world. There’s no need to deduce the secrets of heaven or peep into the future. Just based on logic alone, it’s impossible for the gold emperor to be unprepared. What comes next is the most dangerous moment…”</p><p>“How exactly should I break out of this situation…”</p><p>There was no one more suitable for them to cultivate than nine serenities and the highest level of the immortal world in the past. After all, they could comprehend the past in advance and peer into the future realm without being corrupted by the nine serenities, if they wanted to leave, they could return to their original bodies and leave. Of course, if they stayed for too long, the will of the nine serenities would erode and inevitably become extreme. There would be many hidden dangers when they reached the other shore in the future.</p><p>It was precisely because she knew this that she had asked Meng Qi to retract his past and move to the netherworld. At the very least, this was the “Home ground”and he had the power to fight back. However, the accumulated power of the Gold Emperor had always been engraved in her heart, it made her believe that the calamity of ten deaths would not be resolved so easily.</p><p>The “Ten deaths without a way out”mentioned by the Green Emperor definitely contained the key to breaking the calamity. It was just that the true meaning was still unclear for the time being.</p><p>Speaking of which, there was not much difference between the current husband and death..</p><p>Just as Gu Xiaosang’s thoughts were churning and expanding, sparking sparks, mother Wusheng, who had the upper hand but could not crush Sun Wukong, paused for a moment. Her fair and slender palm suddenly retracted back into the real world, the flowing river of time was highlighted between heaven and earth. The light was illusory and had never changed since ancient times.</p><p>As the faint light flowed up the river, the world became vast. The real world expanded abruptly and was billions of times bigger than the current node. The Golden Water of the Jade Lake was still intact. The Empress of the Golden Emperor of the west, who was sitting in the palace, suddenly reached out her palm, she slapped toward the flower and fruit mountain of the lower realm and toward the mouth of the river. She wanted to nip the unborn Sun Wukong and Yang Jian, who did not possess the strength to fake the other shore, in the cradle and change history!</p><p>Your Past is not in the Netherworld!</p><p>Ever since the current node proved the other shore, the past itself was also the other shore. In other words, they were originally the same “Person.”From the simple points of time, they became countless points that strung together into a line. The past, present, and future formed a line!</p><p>With a palm strike, it split into two places. The Guanjiang River Mouth’s divine Lord Erlang temple was reduced to ashes. Yang Jian’s body was like a bubble. With a poke, it shattered. The Huaguo Mountain did not collapse, but the stone immediately collapsed.</p><p>However, with a flash of light, Yang Jian appeared once again. The stone appeared once again, and both of them were only left with their imprints in the real world.</p><p>“Thank you for your concern, old mother. Since you are in the Netherworld, how can you leave your weak days in the outside world?”Yang Jian, who was engaged in a fierce battle with black celestial thearch, laughed. Billions of golden lotuses suddenly appeared around him, and each of them emitted a boundless glow, they connected into one piece.</p><p>It was the jade void supreme treasure, the yellow flag of Wuji Apricot in the center of the world!</p><p>Wuji was the Yang Earth, and it was the Yin Earth. It was compatible with the Netherworld and was not weakened. Just like the yin-yang life-and-death Battle of lightning, it was undoubtedly able to help Yang Jian, who had also cultivated the infinite chaos intent in the eighth or ninth level, absorb it and move it to the netherworld, this process was covered up by important figures and could not be detected by the other side!</p><p>There were two completely different concepts between being in hiding and acting at the last minute. The former could prepare calmly and make up for the hidden dangers, while the latter descended in a hurry and revealed flaws everywhere.</p><p>On the other side, the equal of Heaven Grand Sage unleashed his true fire. He cried out in delight and mocked once again:</p><p>“Old Lord asked me to wait here. Why would I leave anything behind?”</p><p>Coincidentally, he also cultivated the eight-nine arcane art. Not only did he have the Bodhi golden body, he also had an indestructible dao body that could contain all things and return to the boundless universe. It was just that he and Yang Jian were late in attaining the Dao. After defeating Buddha and achieving success.., he then condensed the Limitless Dao of chaos and did not have many opportunities to make a move. He had always been mysterious and liked to go easy on others. After the Battle of Ascension to godhood, he rarely made a move with his full strength. Other than his fellow disciples from the Jade Void sect.., no one knew when he had attained the Limitless Dao of Chaos!</p><p>At the same time, the victory Buddha behind him appeared and quickly fused with his original body. His aura grew slightly, and he used this to slowly remove the erosion of the nine Netherworlds, so as to prevent him from truly becoming a devil.</p><p>Hanging outside the nine underworlds, the perfect moon that was like a pellet had no ripples. The pure white and holy palm pressed down again, and there was almost no gap with the previous one, it was as if the past was just a dream.</p><p>Suddenly, a long-handled axe appeared in the palm. The color was dark and almost bronze. Nine dao patterns were clearly visible. Some were shaped like flames, some like chaos, and some like thunder. But at this moment.., the corresponding meaning seemed to be displayed:</p><p>“Burn!””Devour!””Destroy!””Punish!””Kill!””Silence!””No!””Freeze!””Destroy!”</p><p>The Heavenly Punishment Axe!</p><p>The Heavenly Punishment Axe, which had disappeared for a long time, appeared in the hands of Wu Sheng’s mother. It was completely awakened and did not go against her orders. It seemed to have been like this for a long time!</p><p>The memory of it had never existed in Gu Xiaosang’s mind..</p><p>The Axe was rough and fierce, and her delicate hands were white and beautiful. The contrast between the two was strong, forming an impressive visual effect. It struck toward Sun Wukong in a mighty manner, as if it was the punishment from the Great Dao!</p><p>Woo!</p><p>The underworld roared everywhere, as if it had sensed great danger.</p><p>At this moment, in the real world, the world suddenly became dark, as if it was drowned by endless black water. The river of time and fate was once again prominent, and it flowed quietly in it.</p><p>The Falling Heaven’s punishment axe slowed down, and the Golden Emperor’s ethereal and sacred voice came from the full moon that had no ripples all this time:</p><p>“Zhen Wu!”</p><p>“This is a good opportunity!”</p><p>Everyone on the other side had their own matters to attend to, and there was no better opportunity than this to attack the end of the sea of bitterness!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
