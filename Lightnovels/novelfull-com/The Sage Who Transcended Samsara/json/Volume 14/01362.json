Each of them had their own plans</p><p>Waves of powerful and majestic energy descended from all the pure lands to the boundary between the Buddhist kingdom on Earth and the hometown of vacuum. Together with the eight groups of heavenly dragons, arhat vajra, and the enlightened king Bodhisattva, the energy was magnificent and impressive, there were seven or eight people who had great divine abilities.</p><p>“The power is at its peak. The future constellation, the ancestor Bodhi, the infinite wisdom Buddha…”Daoist cihang, who was sitting in the Great Hall of the water-moon nunnery, thought of the names of these people who had great divine abilities of creation. Some of them were called the same in the past, and some of them became Buddhas later, they included the two great sects of the Western Paradise and the Bodhi Pure Land of wisdom. In other words, for some reason, the Bodhi ancient Buddha had temporarily put aside his enmity with Amitabha and helped Amitabha with all his might in this matter.</p><p>At this moment, besides the two great divine powers in the destiny realm, the unfettered King Buddha of the world and the future Buddha Maitreya, the high-end forces of the Buddhist League had come out in full force. They wanted to uproot their hometown of vacuum with the momentum of a lion fighting a rabbit, and let the Buddhist kingdom on the ground occupy the territory of the Great Zhou Empire in the past, the essence of the real world!</p><p>Even with the calamity of Mount Lingshan, the Buddhist faction still had a deep foundation. The number of great divine arts practitioners at the Destiny realm was several times that of luoism!</p><p>“Even if old mother Wusheng obtained the god Ascension Board and moved away the heaven-sealing platform, with this, the overall strength of Luoism’s divine envoys would increase dramatically. Even if we include Zhenyuan Zi, there are only three people at the Destiny Realm. In the face of the Buddhist faction’s all-out effort, I’m afraid that only the Golden Emperor himself will come down.”Daoist cihang’s thoughts flashed through his mind, analyzing the current situation.., “He has the remains of the Tang Sanzang and is able to entice and control the Supreme True Buddha. Both sides have the same goal to fight against Buddhism. They should have hit it off at this moment, but as long as Amitabha and Bodhi ancient Buddha do not have any differences, there is no chance at all.”</p><p>Amitabha was one of the strongest shores in the world, and he also controlled Emperor Fu. The quasi-ti Daoist that Bodhi ancient Buddha slashed out was also at the level of the weak shore. With the two of them working together, no matter how brilliant the gold emperor was, or how he had already formed the embryonic form of the dao fruit.., and with the help of the Supreme True Buddha, he was still a step behind. Although Amitabha did not reveal anything when they fought on the other shore, the fact that he controlled emperor Fu was terrifying, but his opponent was the celestial venerable of morality, who could turn the three pure ones into one. Even though the apocalypse had weakened quite a bit, it was evident that the two sides had reached a draw.</p><p>“Under such circumstances, the gold emperor can only hope for external help if he wants to preserve his hometown of vacuum. Needless to say, the Hierarch Celestial Venerable, the Demon Buddha, uncle-master of morality, and the green emperor might not expect the Buddhist sect to be in a great trouble.”Daoist cihang sighed secretly, the outcome of the day was not something he could predict.</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly had a thought. He looked up at his hometown in the vacuum and saw the white divine light that covered the entire heaven and earth rapidly shrink like a receding tide, the gods conferred by the Luo sect and the original missionaries were strangely swept away by the “Receding tide”and surged into the dreamlike netherworld. Layers of restrictions emerged and dragged it into the chaos.</p><p>“Luoism has given up its ‘hometown’in the real world so easily?”Daoist ci hang frowned slightly, his eyes showing astonishment.</p><p>Luoism admitted defeat cleanly and withdrew from the real world without experiencing the Battle of Ascension, leaving only the Netherworld, which had merged with the original vacuum hometown?</p><p>Such a change was really out of his expectations, and also out of the expectations of the great divine arts descenders such as the Star constellation Buddha in the future. For a moment, there was no reaction, and he did not take the opportunity to occupy the territory.</p><p>In the center of the Buddhist kingdom on Earth, Maitreya sat upright on the white lotus platform and muttered to himself,</p><p>“Is this the decision of the other side?”</p><p>Seeing that things could not be done and that this future was hard to change, he did not hesitate to give up?</p><p>At this point, the Netherworld was independent and integrated into the vacuum hometown. It could be considered a part of the ashram, and not even the great divine arts practitioners could shake it in the slightest.</p><p>The battle between the Gods and Buddhas that was about to take place had quietly turned into nothingness. The many living beings in the real world did not realize that they had just escaped a disaster.</p><p>“However, according to the extreme of the followers of Luoism, unless one forcibly transmutes the light of Buddha, there will be a great slaughter and great sin…”Daoist ci hang came back to his senses and suddenly realized something, “Is this the true meaning of the Hierarch heavenly venerate asking me to go down to the lower realm to save the suffering?”</p><p>..</p><p>In the hometown of vacuum.</p><p>The pure white Buddha suddenly bloomed with boundless light, so pure that it could not tolerate any impurities. It was so brilliant that even the great divine power of creation could not look directly at it. He said in a low voice,</p><p>“Why don’t you want me to take action?”</p><p>“Why do you submit to those false Buddhas?”</p><p>In the depths of the hometown of vacuum, which had no end in sight, there was a bright and round moon hanging all year round. The clear light sprinkled down, and a beautiful voice was heard. It was indifferent and cold. “Those who are full of the moon will suffer losses.”</p><p>The Supreme True Buddha was not a crazy and chaotic person like the monster of the Heavenly Dao. He was only extreme. Many thoughts flashed through his mind when he heard that. He roughly understood what the gold emperor meant. If they were to start a war with the Buddhist sect at this moment.., the heavenly venerate of morals, the Green Emperor, the Devil Buddha, and the others would probably not attack immediately. Instead, they would wait for the Luo sect to be crippled before they could stop the Buddhist sect from expanding and contain the other party’s momentum. Now that the Luo sect had voluntarily given up.., the Buddhist kingdom on Earth had unified the original great Zhou realm and had reached its peak state. After a few more years of digestion, more than half of Maitreya’s great wish would have been completed. There would be enough power to push it to the other shore.</p><p>At that time, if they did not want to watch the Buddhist sect’s momentum being suppressed and Amitabha getting closer to the dao fruit, the heavenly venerate of virtue, the Devil Buddha, and the others would “Beg”the Golden Emperor to act. It would be the opposite of today. The host and guest would change positions.</p><p>“Then we will wait patiently.”The Supreme True Buddha’s heart was like boiling water adding fire when he thought of how he would be able to devour most of the false Buddhas in a few years.</p><p>There were no ripples on the full and bright moon. A lofty voice descended:</p><p>“Just waiting is not enough.”</p><p>As he spoke, a wave of pure yellow colored glass rose from the depths of his hometown of vacuum. The Buddhist chant echoed, bringing out a blurry Golden Buddha.</p><p>Seeing this scene, the pure non-impurity light around the Supreme True Buddha shook violently, bringing about the uncertainty of his hometown of vacuum.</p><p>He asked in excitement, “What else do you want to Do?”</p><p>That was the remains of the Chentan Merit Buddha, and that was the golden body of the Tang Sanzang!</p><p>The Bright Moon suddenly became clear, and the figure of the golden emperor could be vaguely seen. He said lightly,</p><p>“All the other shore knows that I have obtained the remains of the three Tang treasures, and I can use this to entice you. This is a brilliant move, and it is hard to find anything out of the ordinary.”</p><p>“I will give it to you directly today to see what kind of changes will occur after you devour it and attain perfection.”</p><p>“The two great products left behind by the Dao fruit should be combined into one, and there should be a variable that is beyond the expectations of the other shore.”</p><p>“I’ll wait and see.”</p><p>The golden body flew out and directly threw itself at the Supreme True Buddha. The pure light that could not tolerate impurities immediately flourished, and it reverberated with the great joy of the Nirvana.</p><p>..</p><p>In the center of the western nirvana land, Amitabha sat upright on a twelfth grade green lotus platform. His golden body was six feet long, and the Buddha’s light was complete.</p><p>Under the lotus platform, opposite Amitabha, stood an elf-like girl in a white dress. Her appearance was exquisite to the extreme, and her temperament was ethereal and beautiful. There was a meaningful smile at the corner of her mouth, revealing a shallow and beautiful dimple.</p><p>She smiled and pressed her palms together:</p><p>“My husband asked me to listen to the Dharma.”</p><p>Amitabha’s eyes were half-opened, but he did not answer. He directly talked about the mysteries of Buddhism.</p><p>..</p><p>Outside Qingming, where the mind wandered, Han Guang, who was wearing a wide robe and big sleeves, turned into a streak of light and traveled through the endless darkness.</p><p>Through Lu Ya, he once again connected with the Devil Buddha, temporarily breaking away from the depression and despair created by the gold emperor. According to the hint, he was going to find the time light fragment that the time knife had slashed out in the world that he had dreamed for forty years!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
