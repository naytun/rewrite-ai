There was no sun, only darkness, and only a few living things could survive.</p><p>Meng Qi looked out into the sky and saw that the nearby galaxies were like candlelight in the wind, swaying and on the verge of collapse. Further away, they were swallowed by endless chaos and returned to nothingness, leaving only illusory and illusory afterimages, like a background picture.</p><p>The end of this level could only affect but could not destroy earth and the surrounding galaxies. The so-called “Crossing treasure raft”truly lived up to its name.</p><p>However, this was not the main point of Meng Qi’s observation. A crack suddenly appeared between his brows. He opened a vertical eye that contained an ancient glass lamp, illuminating all the details without missing anything, by searching for the mystery of the “Crossing treasure raft”that could withstand the end of the epoch, or rather, the source of power, he could use this to find out which other shore had done it — after his body became the other shore, after he mastered the limitless and Dao one, his “Bodhi Wisdom Eye”was formed naturally.</p><p>The Great Sun was dim, like a flickering firefly, and the Earth was swaying like a huge wave and a broken boat. An invisible and nameless power shrouded the outside, and no one knew where it came from or where it came from.</p><p>“Interesting…”Meng Qi whispered to Gu Xiaosang.</p><p>Even with his current realm and strength of the other shore, he could not accurately determine the source of power of the crossing World Raft?</p><p>Gu Xiaosang was not surprised. She smiled and said, “If there is nothing strange here, why would the Devil Buddha hide the hope of breaking out of the seal here?”</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said, “Then let’s go back to the end of the last era and see when Earth became the crossing World Treasure Raft.”</p><p>In the real world, limited by the karmic shackles of the Golden Emperor and the great wish of the medicine master Wang Fo, although his strength was initially equivalent to that of an ancient person who had just entered the embryonic form of dao fruit, the improvement of his realm was quite slow, looking back, he was still stuck at the beginning of the last era of the immemorial era. It was difficult for him to step into the first few eras of the immemorial era, not to mention when the heavens were split open. At the very beginning, the Earth was just a treasure raft for crossing worlds, if the river of time seemed to have no connection with the past, looking back would be twice the result with half the effort.</p><p>“I feel that my husband already has a judgment in his heart,”Gu Xiaosang said faintly with her dimples.</p><p>Meng Qi glanced at her and replied with a smile, “Didn’t you also make a Guess?”</p><p>The illusory river of time once again filled the heaven and earth. Meng Qi went against the current and broke through the passage of time. He helped Gu Xiaosang to understand the mysteries of the past while walking toward an even more ancient history.</p><p>After experiencing several mass extinctions, which were also the end of several epochs, Meng Qi felt something. He suddenly stopped and looked around. He saw that the planet was covered in white snow and frozen. The low temperature and cold were freezing everything, all the warmth of all living things had disappeared.</p><p>However, an inexplicable power descended from an infinite height, leaving some things frozen in the ice layer alive and dormant. Once the epoch opened again and the cold faded, they would become active again, they would welcome a great explosion of species.</p><p>This time, the power that protected the world crossing treasure raft was no longer invisible and nameless, without a source or a place to return to!</p><p>Meng Qi gazed at the endless high place. He saw the auspicious clouds forming into a sea, the multicolored light was myriad, and the auspicious Qi formed a ball. So, he took a step forward with Gu Xiaosang and arrived nearby. A clear round light emerged behind his head. It was as cold as the moon, perfect and flawless, it contained all possible things.</p><p>Suddenly, a figure flew out from the Sea of auspicious clouds. He was wearing the clothes of the prehistoric era. There was an ancient and Savage oil-colored totem on his face, and his strength was almost equal to that of a creator.</p><p>“Who are you?”The ancient immortal God shouted sternly.</p><p>But before he could finish his words, he sensed Meng Qi’s subtle aura and saw the perfect and flawless treasure light that contained everything. His tone suddenly slowed down, and he cupped his hands and bowed:</p><p>“May I know which heavenly venerate has graced us with his presence?”</p><p>After a pause, he hesitated and asked again, “Could it be the first great heavenly venerate of the Jade Void Palace?”</p><p>The boundless chaos and the initial feeling of splitting the heaven and earth were almost exactly the same, but slightly immature!</p><p>With a slight smile, Meng Qi told him frankly, “I have obtained the Dharma from the hollow jade temple and attained the Dao in the future. I have traveled back in time to this place. May I know which fellow Daoist lives here?”</p><p>As the “Gatekeeper”of the passage passage treasure raft, this ancient immortal God should not be unaware of the unusual reason on the other side.</p><p>After hearing Meng Qi’s words and looking at Gu Xiaosang, who was obviously not the other shore, the ancient immortal God from the primeval era suddenly realized something, he smiled and said, “I see. No wonder I have never seen the celestial venerable before. I only feel that he is almost the same as the original great celestial venerable of the Jade Void Temple.”</p><p>Then.., he sighed and said, “The path of Dao is in the ‘future’, so the ‘future’should also be the current node. I am afraid that I am currently in history, and the Celestial Venerable, who is almost omnipotent, does not recognize me. This shows that I have not lived until that time. The path of immortality is ultimately a dream…”</p><p>Immortal gods of similar realms could be crazy and cruel, but they would not be ignorant.</p><p>Meng Qi was about to console him when he said that there would be reincarnations in the next era, so he might not be completely dead. However, the ancient immortal God with a wild totem continued:</p><p>“Since I can not live forever, I shall not disgrace the name of the Holy One. As for this place, it is the residence of the Holy One, the purple clouds palace outside the 33 Heavens!”</p><p>The residence of the Dao Master? Purple Clouds Palace? Meng Qi was not too shocked, as if he had expected this.</p><p>There were very few people who could prevent him from figuring out the source of the power. Even if the primordial beginning appeared again, spiritual treasures appeared, and morals were involved, it would take a lot of planning to hide it. Therefore, the answer was obvious. Earth was one of the two dao fruit holders, the crossing World Treasure Raft!</p><p>And the Devil Buddha was suppressed by the Buddha. Didn’t he walk into the trap by hiding “Him and me”in the Buddha’s Crossing World Treasure Raft?</p><p>Therefore, there was only one truth. This was the world-crossing treasure raft of the former Dao Master!</p><p>No wonder he believed that the “Him and me”on Earth, which was him, could hide from the Buddha and the other shores!</p><p>No wonder the legend of the ascension of gods on Earth had one more ancestral master Hongjun and one more purple clouds palace than the real situation. There were different developments. This was probably because the dao master’s imprint had influenced the world, but it was also ambiguous and was forced by the mortals to become Hongjun.</p><p>It was no wonder that Earth had experienced the end of several epochs!</p><p>It was no wonder that the Golden Emperor had to follow the basic rules to preach in this world!</p><p>It was no wonder that there were so many sects on Earth, but few abhijnas appeared in the world!</p><p>In this way, many things seemed to be able to be explained. The relationship between the Devil Buddha and the Dao Master in the past and the current thunder god was not shallow! It was even possible that it was an ancient figure who had used the immemorial thunder pool to “Sneak across the sea to survive”from the previous era to the current era. It might even be another great product of the DAO Master’s work of reducing and seeking emptiness, a relatively normal product.., just like how the Tang Sanzang was to the Buddha and the Supreme True Buddha!</p><p>That was why the Celestial Emperor said that he did not know the hidden details of the thunder god. That was why he could control the other product of the Dao master — the monster of the heavenly axiom — with his weak body. That was why he knew so many secrets, he gained the trust of the Donghuang, the Celestial Emperor, and the Devil Master. That was why he said that he had a terrifying enemy on the top of the Ananda Pure Land Peak. He had a great sense of danger because the apocalypse was to destroy all the products of the DAO Master and the Buddha who reduced and sought for emptiness, it would allow them to completely transcend, so it was relatively easy for him to reach the other shore. He did not even have the time to encounter any obstacles..</p><p>The true face of the Devil Buddha was immediately revealed!</p><p>But Meng Qi still had more questions in his heart. If this judgment was true, how could it explain the repeated betrayals of thunder god and Ah Nan? He could hardly get any benefits from it, and greatly weakening the other forces on the other shore was the opposite of the crisis that was against him.</p><p>As for why the original heavenly venerate knew the secret and location of Ah nan hiding “Him and me”, it was even more of a mystery!</p><p>More importantly, after he became independent, the secrets of Earth would definitely be exposed in the eyes of the other side. It was not difficult to find out that this was the venerable Daoist’s crossing over treasure raft. Why did the heavenly emperor say that Thunder God had other secrets.</p><p>Was it a big question if he judged that thunder god was the product of the venerable Daoist’s short-cut through experience?</p><p>At this moment, Gu Xiaosang also transmitted her voice, “I remember that the seven heaven-severing swords are missing in the exchange book of the Lord of six paths of reincarnation.”</p><p>In other words, the Devil Buddha Ananda did not have all the seven heaven-severing swords, and those who had collected all the heaven-severing swords at his level had plenty of excuses. There was no need to hide anything.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly and said to the ancient immortal,</p><p>“I wonder if I can pay my respects to the holy man?”</p><p>Was the brand inside occupied by the monster of Heavenly Dao, or was it the Devil Buddha Ananda?</p><p>The ancient immortal god bowed and said, “I will go and ask the holy man first.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
