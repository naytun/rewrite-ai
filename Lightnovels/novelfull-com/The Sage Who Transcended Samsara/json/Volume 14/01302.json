She entered deep into the darkness of the heavenly prison, looking like a God walking in the world of Yin.</p><p>Her mind was like a knife, cutting off the sudden burst of melancholy as she followed, she reminded, “The six heaven ancestral dragon is an innate spirit, formed from the dragon veins of the immortal world. It has long condensed a divine body and is immortal and indestructible. Now that it has collapsed, there is no residue. I’m afraid that it has been absorbed by something, leaving only an empty shell.”</p><p>And this thing had something to do with the eyes that kept peering into the darkness. It had something to do with the headless figure that jumped out of the six heavens ancestral dragon’s divine body!</p><p>“I’m very curious. What kind of monster is this?”Meng Qi said as if it was normal. “I wonder if it has anything to do with the remnants of the battle in the Celestial Prison on the other shore.”</p><p>Unfortunately, the remains of the six heavens ancestral dragon were destroyed just like that. Otherwise, there would be hope if they could collect a few similar old ghost corpses and paired them with the Greatsword of Destiny.</p><p>After passing through this realm, a huge and grand staircase appeared once again. As they continued to descend, Meng Qi and Xuan nu seemed to have flown into the void that had no boundaries, and they almost lost their sense of the passage of time.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, another dot of golden light leaped out. Like a candle flame, it burned quietly. As they got closer, the Golden Flame split into two, two into four, and four into eight, turning into pure yang true flames that filled the horizon, the color was pure gold, shining like the sun.</p><p>Within the cluster of True Flames was a three-legged strange bird with jet-black feathers and dark gold. It looked divine and handsome. The heat spread outwards, melting the void and interfering with time. Its life force had long since passed away, leaving behind a dead and ancient atmosphere.</p><p>“The first three-legged golden crow after the beginning of this era?”Meng Qi looked at the huge statue-like strange bird with his hands behind his back. He already had a guess in his heart.</p><p>“Yes, the essence of the Sunfire took form and opened its own intelligence. It was the first three-legged golden crow of this era. In the early years of the ancient era, it held the power of light, vitality, fire, time, and incineration. It was one of the few powerful gods.”The tone of the nine heavens mystical maiden remained calm, “But later, it was defeated by the celestial thearch and deprived of the power of the Sun. He gave part of it to Xi and made his name as the Sun Divine Lord.”</p><p>The Great Sun and the Cold Moon in the real world were not stars in the ordinary sense. They gave birth to different heavens in the immortal world, projected onto the myriad worlds and turned into corresponding authority. They had an illusory great dao that formed naturally, therefore, in the history of many intelligent creatures in the universe, the sun deity in the symbolic sense was initially regarded as the celestial emperor.</p><p>The two of them chatted casually like they were in a teahouse. They looked at the surrounding darkness, the malicious prying eyes, and the initial golden crow that had an extremely strong sense of existence as if there was nothing there.</p><p>At this moment, light erupted and a white blaze swept out. The grand sun primordial fire swept outwards and lit up the void. The three-legged Golden Crow opened its eyes and looked down with a high and indifferent attitude. It jumped around with a pale white color. It really had the majesty of a self-proclaimed emperor at its peak.</p><p>In the ancient mythological era, “Emperor”and “Emperor”were not things that could be called casually. They were all contained within the supreme intent that ruled over gods, mortals, and demons.</p><p>In the face of this mighty power, Meng Qi did not move. He looked at Liu Luo with a smile, and his true spirit vibrated as he sent a voice transmission:</p><p>“Lady Xuan Nu, Will you take care of this?”</p><p>Liu Luo did not say a word. His crystal clear eyes suddenly reflected the figure of the three-legged golden crow, excluding the incandescent light and the Grand Sun Primordial Fire.</p><p>In an instant, the sea of bitterness churned, and time surged. The terrifying three Golden Crows suddenly stopped.</p><p>The moment they stopped, a red sword light shot up from the hands of the mysterious lady of the nine heavens and slashed out. Along the way, it devoured the Sun True Flames and absorbed the white light. The darkness only left behind a bright and powerful red glow.</p><p>The sword light slashed past and the three Golden Crows suddenly let out a crisp sound. A crack appeared and it split open. Before it landed, it looked like it had been weathered for a long time. The undying body turned into light and a headless figure jumped out from within, he threw himself into the darkness behind him.</p><p>“Good sword technique, you are indeed worthy of being the god of the ancient Heavenly Court.”Meng Qi clapped his hands and smiled.</p><p>Liu Luo kept the sword in his sleeve and did not comment on Meng Qi’s praise. He said solemnly, “I think I recognize the background of that headless figure.”</p><p>“I would like to hear the details.”Meng Qi looked over.</p><p>“My original owner’s subordinate, Xing Tian, was beheaded by the Heavenly Emperor and did not die. I did not expect him to be suppressed here later. Now, it is somewhat strange.”Liu Luo’s sleeve let out a clear sword cry.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly and said, “Chi Di?”</p><p>As expected, such a figure had a mythical archetype..</p><p>“Yes, although the six heaven ancestral dragon, the Golden Crow and the other Old Gods of the nine heavens had fought for the throne with the heavenly monarch before, his strongest enemy at that time were the other two. One of them was Chi di. He was the emperor of all the living beings on the earth and he was also the ruler of half of the immortal realm. In a sense, he could already be called the heavenly monarch. Later on, after a long and arduous war and countless ups and downs, the heavenly monarch was able to turn the situation around bit by bit. However, it was only after the heavenly monarch used the seven kills tablet to break through the restrictions of the innate gods that he finally won the battle.” There was a hint of regret in Liu Luo’s tone.</p><p>After a brief pause.., she continued, “The Crimson Emperor was arrogant and unwilling to submit. He used his body as a sword and Xing Tian inherited the remnants of the army. In the end, he was also captured alive and his head was displayed to the public. However, his will was extremely strong. He was able to invert life and death with falsehood and reality. He used his breast as his eyes and his navel as his mouth. He survived and resisted once again.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded thoughtfully and said, “After that, the heavenly emperor did not burn his bones and scatter the ashes. Instead, he suppressed him here and forbade the gods from entering and leaving. Every time he went out on patrol, he would come to the heavenly prison. I’m afraid that he has set something up and is plotting something…”</p><p>Both of them spoke with a serious tone. However, they did not stop. They continued to move forward, following the steps and going deeper.</p><p>After that, they had passed countless layers of places where the ancestral dragon of the six heavens, the golden crow, and other Old Gods and ghosts were imprisoned, but there was nothing left. It was as if the spies in the darkness completely understood the uselessness of such obstructions and no longer wasted their efforts.</p><p>When Meng Qi had a feeling that he was about to experience eternity, he finally saw some floating lights.</p><p>The huge and magnificent steps came to an end. In front of him floated specks of yin flames, surrounding a black-robed emperor who was looking down!</p><p>His aura was terrifying and vast. His death intent surged, turning into a dark fire that could burn the spiritual light of his nature. There were vague dao patterns interwoven between his brows. They looked like gods, ghosts, immortals, and demons, it was obvious that he was above the six heaven ancestral dragons and the first Golden Crow’s molt that had been stripped of their authority.</p><p>At this moment, the nine heaven mystical maiden Liu Luo said with a sigh,</p><p>“Cheng Tang…”</p><p>Cheng Tang, the founder of the Yin Shang dynasty, was said to be the descendant of the Xuan Bird and the human race. He was a demigod and ruled over the Earth. The demons, humans, and earth gods all bowed their heads.</p><p>Facing the gaze of the high-crowned emperor in black robes.., meng Qi’s heart did not waver at all as he said, “According to your words, in ancient times, the title of ‘Emperor’was the symbol of ruling over the heavens and the earth. It was the meaning of the heavenly emperor. The emperors of the Yin Shang dynasty all had the title of Emperor. Even king Zhou was called di Xin. Heh, it seems that the other powerful enemy of the heavenly emperor was this Yin Shang Cheng Tang. The Battle of the Gods was definitely not just to enrich the gods of the Heavenly Court.”</p><p>During the Zhou dynasty, the Shang dynasty did not dare to call themselves the emperor. Instead, they were the kings. It was not until the fall of the heavenly court and the death of the human emperor that the titles of emperor and Emperor started to spread.</p><p>“Cheng Tang was a demigod and a descendant of Xuan Niao. At that time, he had the support of the heavenly venerate of spiritual treasure and the monster emperor. He wanted to use the earth to fight against the Heavenly Court and the heavens. He wanted to become the supreme ruler of the gods, humans, and the monster race. This was the final stop of the Heavenly Emperor.”Liu Luo looked at Cheng Tang who had yet to make a move, he nodded slightly, “Furthermore, Cheng Tang’s ambitions were not limited to this. He wanted to build a foundation that would last for all eternity. When he was alive, he disarmed himself and accepted the incense. He became the Ghost Emperor and tried to establish the underworld. He wanted to devour the immortal world. He wanted the descendants of the Yin Shang dynasty to be the emperor when they were alive and the Emperor when they were dead. He wanted to unify the immortal world, the nine underworld, and the Earth.”</p><p>Meng Qi was surprised when he heard this. Just as he was about to ask, he saw the Ghost Emperor Cheng Tang, who was floating in the air, open his mouth and speak in a low and hoarse voice:</p><p>“Retreat quickly and don’t disturb.”</p><p>Don’t disturb? Meng Qi and Liu Luo looked at each other in surprise.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
