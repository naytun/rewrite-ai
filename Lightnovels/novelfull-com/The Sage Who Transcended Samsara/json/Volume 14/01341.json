The Old Boatman’s figure was like a bubble, disappearing along with the whole world.</p><p>..</p><p>In the nine serenities realm, on the top of the Dark Mountain, Meng Qi sat in the lotus position. Before his hands formed a seal, one was surging with purple lightning, and the other was floating with light gold. In his mind, he recalled what Gu Xiaosang had said earlier:</p><p>“In the past, the gold emperor used me as a symbol to give me his experience and knowledge. If I knew more, I would be able to plan more deeply. However, this was limited by the nodes. Since I was born in my mother’s womb, I no longer know his future memories. Trying to grasp his current situation and arrangements would easily lead me into a trap</p><p>“However, for me to be able to maintain my spirituality and have an independent consciousness, I must have been secretly manipulated by some important figure. I don’t know who it is exactly. It could be the primordial Lord of Heaven or the heavenly lord of Lingbao. He allowed me to see many clear futures and know many secrets that even my mother doesn’t know. This is the source of our plans and the source of our vitality</p><p>“At first glance, Amitabha belongs to the hostile camp and is in a stable alliance with mother. He is not someone that can be roped in. However, if you think about it carefully, you will come to an unexpected conclusion. There is a fundamental contradiction between the Buddhist kingdom on Earth and the hometown of vacuum. In the future, there will always be a difference in power. In the case of Maitreya, which is enough to turn the situation around, Amitabha and mother Wusheng can be said to be separated on the surface. With the advantages and disadvantages, it is not impossible to directly break down the hostile camp and pave the way for your other shore, husband.”</p><p>“Heh, it’s fine if you listen to these words, my husband. This is what we are trying to confuse the gold emperor and Amitabha. The truth is that Amitabha will never allow you to reach the other shore. It’s even more determined than the will of the gold emperor and the ancient Buddha. This is a battle for the Great Dao, and there’s no room for reconciliation</p><p>“Mother’s main target is me, while the ancient Buddha and my husband are a ‘Three Corpses’enmity that can not be resolved</p><p>“Ancient people like them who have already formed the embryonic form of the Dao fruit only have one goal, and that is to perfect the dao fruit in order to completely transcend. Moreover, they are limited by the number of eras and are at the end of the calamity. There really is a situation where you don’t have me.”</p><p>“With the intention of indulging, the primordial lord of Heaven, Amitabha, and the other ancient people ‘observed’the process of the Dao master’s transcendence. They roughly understood the key and the problems that might remain in the DAO Master’s path, in order to find a more suitable and perfect method for themselves. Thus, there was the fall of the Heavenly Emperor, the end of the immemorial era, and the abnormality of the Fu Emperor. From this era onwards, they began to hide behind the scenes and experiment with their own paths. In this process, there were inevitably collisions between each other. Supporting the Heavenly Emperor, thriving in commerce, and the battle for the ascension of the gods were all extensions of this matter. It was a battle for the path, a battle for the Great Dao.”</p><p>“My husband is the product of the primordial Lord of Heaven’s second attempt to reduce the void and carry the name of Li Dan. How could Amitabha allow you to ascend to the other shore and help his most powerful opponent to get closer to and even obtain the Dao Fruit?”</p><p>“He controlled Emperor Fu and has been hiding in the deepest part of the origin of life and death. In the past, Zhenwu suddenly attacked and killed Fengdu the great emperor, leaving the Bodhi ancient Buddha’s three corpses incomplete, but he did not interfere. What was his purpose? “Isn’t it just to sit back and watch Bodhi ancient Buddha lose its perfection and take a step back from the Dao Fruit? “This is the case for allies for countless eras, let alone you, my husband</p><p>“As for why Maitreya and his ‘Buddha Kingdom on earth’are so important to Amitabha Buddha, my husband, have you not guessed it yet? The way to reduce and seek emptiness is more similar to the way of the primordial Lord of Heaven and not the way of the DAO Master and Buddha.”</p><p>“Therefore, on the surface, it seems that we have arranged a lot of things in order to collude with Amitabha and pull out the firewood from the bottom of the pot. We have completely failed to understand the crux of the matter and walked right into the trap so that Amitabha could make Amitabha fall into his trap. In this way, we can threaten the gold emperor and make a deal on the matter of Maitreya. But in fact, this is to confuse them and make them think that our tricks stop there and cover up our real efforts</p><p>“I don’t know how much the Golden Emperor knows about the mystery of the dao fruit, but Amitabha finds it hard to guess whether he knows or not. In short, he appeared in my dream and did not directly reject my request, which means that he has indeed played along with my plan. It also indirectly shows the attitudes of the few of them on the other side of the river. It gives you hope, husband, so that you have the confidence to try and verify the Dao. It also gives you the courage to leave the nine underworld, so as to completely end this matter.”</p><p>“Otherwise, you would have been hiding in the nine Netherworld with two divine weapons. With the help of Yang Jian and the seven kills Daoist, the nine chaos heavenly venerate would not have allowed the other side to enter this world. At the critical moment, the Monkey Heaven Grand Sage could still help. Even if he released the demon Buddha, they would have lost most of their powers. At most, they would have gained the upper hand and would not be able to do anything to you. The two sides would be in a stalemate until the end of the Apocalypse and the end of the epoch.”</p><p>“At that time, no one will be able to see the future clearly. There will be too many variables, and even the ancient ones might not be spared. Therefore, the best way is to lure you out of the nine nether world and end the matter in advance so that burning lamp can control the causes of the consequences and Maitreya can get the infinite and the heaven opening seal</p><p>“In that case, we will be able to make the best of the situation. Hubby, you can be more bold in the real world and speed up your preparation. You can solidify your foundation and accumulate more experience. This is their ‘acquiescence’, and it is also the reason why I invited Amitabha as my ‘guest’</p><p>“Of course, the process has to be a little more covert. Otherwise, in order to avoid your ‘suspicion’, they will act in a fit of pique and cause both sides to suffer heavy losses. More or less, the great divine arts of their sect will interfere and put on a fight, just like how the fight over the green jade box tested their bottom line.”</p><p>Meng Qi retracted his thoughts. He now had a deeper understanding of the current situation, and he had more confidence in his next actions.</p><p>After completely refining Donghuang’s flesh and blood and grasping every bit of the demonic blood peach, his accumulation on the limitless seal was already deep enough. He could attempt to condense an illusory dao fruit, which was half a dao fruit, at any time, he could even cut out a semi-formed fruit that was related to his lifespan and time, helping him to trace back to the past and “Experience”the future.</p><p>The main problem with his current arrival on the other shore was two aspects. One was that he could not return to the real world, and the “Past and future”had moved to the netherworld. There was a lack of attempts to trace back to the past and possess the future that was complete and real, it was just like the kind of person who had gone through hundreds of simulations but had never gone through an examination. He could not compare to the preparation of the former Azure Emperor. Secondly, the cause of all effects and the heaven opening seal were still lacking. If there was a chance to make up for it, there was no need to force it, he would use Wuji to attain Dao.</p><p>Just as he was analyzing himself, his eyes suddenly lit up. There was an ancient stone tablet with seven large “Kill”words written on it.</p><p>Seven kills Tablet!</p><p>It seems that Daoist seven kills has made up his mind… Meng Qi sighed. This “Gift”came at the right time. It was like having a pillow after falling asleep.</p><p>Back then, when he returned to the Middle Ages, he left behind a piece of history. He relied on the aftermath of the other shore. However, the seven kills tablet also had this ability, and it was not as eye-catching as the absolute saber and the human emperor sword, although the “Self”of his current experience had been transferred to the nine Netherworlds, there were still traces and imprints left behind in the Middle Ages. With the help of the seven kills Tablet’s positioning and the mystical “Cause of all consequences,”he was in the nine Netherworlds.., he could also try to send the “Supreme mental demon”back to the Middle Ages to awaken those imprints and leave behind a “Road sign”for the future when he reached the other shore!</p><p>He used his absolute blade to cut off the connection between the mountain peak and the outside world. His right hand caressed the inscription of the “Kill”word, and the increasingly ancient and Mysterious Dao Yi glass lamp appeared in his eyes.</p><p>The cause and effect were mixed together. The closer it was to the end of the calamity, the more chaotic it was. Black and white streams of light quietly shone on the seven kills tablet, and the thumping of his heart seemed to come from an illusion.</p><p>..</p><p>In Luo City’s restaurant, Meng Qi and Ren Qiushui were sitting opposite each other, commenting on the swordsmanship of the world.</p><p>Ren Qiushui was silent for a long time before she said, “You seem to know everything about swordsmanship, so what kind of swordsmanship do you practice?”</p><p>Meng Qi chuckled, “Me?”</p><p>“I practice the ‘seven heaven-severing swords’.”</p><p>Seven heaven-severing swords? Ren Qiushui suddenly clenched her right hand.</p><p>Just as her spirit fluctuated, a purple light flashed across Meng Qi’s eyes, as brilliant as lightning.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
