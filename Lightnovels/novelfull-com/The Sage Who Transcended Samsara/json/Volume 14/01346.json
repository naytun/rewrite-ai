Under the pure white light, in front of the huge mouth with 40 Buddha teeth, even though he had already touched the other shore, Maitreya still felt his entire body stiffen, as if he was frozen, it was as if he had met his natural nemesis, an existence that could not be disobeyed no matter what. He could not even use 10% of his strength.</p><p>And even if he could go all out, in front of that vast and supreme will, he was as weak as an ant!</p><p>This was simply the true other shore… Maitreya had cultivated for all eternity, and his Buddha Heart was firm. However, at this moment, he could not help but feel ripples. He felt some despair, and even his courage to go all out seemed to have been swallowed by the huge mouth.</p><p>The Supreme True Buddha, as expected of the Supreme True Buddha!</p><p>At this moment, he found that the frozen and stiff feeling had been alleviated. The sound of the zither rang in his ears, and countless black and white spots of light danced in front of his eyes, performing the five elements of yin and yang, the great development of the eight trigrams.., it enveloped the pure white light of the Buddha and the strange huge mouth.</p><p>High in the sky above the Buddha kingdom on the ground, in front of the Buddha that was condensed with pure white light and could not be looked at by mortals, a tall and majestic figure appeared. He was wearing a black imperial robe that covered his entire body. The crown covered his face, and the string of beads covered his face, his face could not be seen clearly. Under his feet was a pair of boots made of Golden Dragon Scales. Immortal clouds and zither music surrounded his body. His life force and death intent formed a balance and flowed endlessly.</p><p>Emperor Fu!</p><p>Maitreya naturally recognized this emperor who had dominated the early years of the ancient era. For a moment, he was in a daze and did not understand why he would help himself. He only felt that he seemed to be somewhat familiar with it. However, no matter what, it was not suitable for him to stay here for long, either he mustered up his courage and made use of this opportunity to prove his dao, or he would escape into the Western Paradise!</p><p>Fu Huang’s eyes, which had been crowned with tassels, looked at the Supreme True Buddha. Both sides transformed into immortal clouds and a sea of light, engaging in an intense battle.</p><p>Sensing the scene of the Buddha Kingdom on Earth, Gu Xiaosang smiled even more even though she could not see it clearly.</p><p>She was waiting for Fu Huang to make his move!</p><p>After the three bodies of Bodhi ancient Buddha were missing, Amitabha and the heavenly venerate of virtue, the two ancient masters, were the strongest in the world. They were involved in each other and were unable to determine who was stronger. Neither of them could fight or leave whenever they wanted to, therefore, when Amitabha, the product of reducing the void, faced with the great danger of the Supreme True Buddha, and when the Buddha Kingdom on Earth was likely to be purified by the Supreme True Buddha, he could only use his last and strongest trump card, he ordered Emperor Fu, who was hiding in the deepest part of the origin of life and death, to intervene and save Maitreya!</p><p>But in this way, the powerful supernatural beings at the level of creation could not see through it, and the people on the other side could not see through it? They could not guess that emperor Fu had been controlled by Amitabha long ago?</p><p>What would bodhi ancient Buddha, who had lost one of the three corpses, Fengdu Emperor, at the origin of life and death, think about this?</p><p>This was the hidden danger of their alliance. Today, they would completely expose it and change Bodhi ancient Buddha’s attitude!</p><p>Gu Xiaosang closed her eyes to hide her concern and worry. She said softly,</p><p>“This is the second preparation.”</p><p>The seven treasures wonderful tree that had opened the Yuanyang ruler paused for a moment, but it recovered immediately. It was still suppressing the purple qi and the green wood, and there was no sign of it rebelling.</p><p>It seemed that Amitabha had also noticed this hidden danger and saw the possibility of this “Future.”Before this, he had communicated with the bodhisattva ancient Buddha and reached some compromises. As expected of the ancient Buddha… seeing this situation.., gu Xiaosang secretly sighed, but it was not completely useless!</p><p>As an ancient man, even though the ancient Bodhi Buddha had three missing bodies and retreated, he was still able to suppress Emperor Qing. It was difficult to kill him. It was easy for him to balance himself while taking out his hand to interfere with Meng Qi’s Dao attainment, however, the situation now was that he seemed to have used all his strength to suppress Emperor Qing!</p><p>At this time, Meng Qi, who had rushed back from the future, finally returned to his original body standing at the current node.</p><p>The heaven and earth suddenly became illusory. Upstream of the long river, Meng Qi’s brand, which had planted a mental demon in the tower lord of the heartless building in ancient times, and Meng Qi’s brand, which had been in the middle age of the overlord, shone brightly when the ancient heavenly court fell, it was like a lighthouse of navigation, illuminating the fog of time and illuminating the “Navigation Path”leading to the current node!</p><p>In the nine nether world, the ‘past’that Meng Qi had transferred into flew out one after another. Some of them roared at the sky in pain, some were covered in blood and tears, some were cleansed, and some were restored to their original spirit. They were the ones who had courageously charged into the highest level of the nine heavens, some were the ones who had refined part of the origin of life and death, some were the ones who had proven themselves in legends, some were the ones who did not care about the past and did not ask for the afterlife. Some were the ones who had cut off all ties, and some were the ones who had rampaged for a while, but in the end, they hugged Gu Xiaosang’s corpse and shouted angrily, there were those who had spent three thousand guests in the hall, those who had watched Jiang Zhi’s back gradually disappear into the mountains and flowers, those who had dressed in fresh clothes, those who had expressed their gratitude and hatred, and those who had stepped through the rolling yellow sand and thanked their teacher with tears in their eyes, there were those who had gone through all kinds of hardships in the reincarnation cycle, those who had been relatively dull and relatively simple in the Shaolin Temple, and those who had gone through all kinds of things on earth. These figures had flown into the long river and formed a line that extended into the universe of Ten Thousand Worlds!</p><p>However, the Golden Emperor’s attack had already arrived and seemed to be unstoppable.</p><p>The bright and clear moon swayed with its clear splendor. Its fair and slender fingers were like the cry of a mother. The call of home brought with it a dim point that seemed to be the heavens and earth as it landed on the yellow flag of Wuji Apricot!</p><p>The boundless light scattered and billions of golden lotuses withered. This jade void defense treasure was almost broken in one strike.</p><p>Even so, it could at most block one more strike!</p><p>A red light flashed in the sky, and another flag fell down. The color was crimson, like a flame. But when it was spread out with the wind, it was ready for gold, wood, water, fire, and earth. The light of the five elements circulated, as if it was a material symbol, the foundation of the world.</p><p>The earth-leaving flame flag!</p><p>Another symbol of the foundation of the Celestial Venerable of morals, the defense treasure of Dou Shuai Palace!</p><p>The Bright Moon did not have the slightest ripple. The slender and powerful fingers pointed out again, shaking the five elements rare treasure, bringing about the shaking and shattering of the world.</p><p>If it was the heavenly venerate of virtue who personally held this flag, old mother Wusheng would have been cautious. Now, it was only the combined efforts of gold horn and silver horn, so how could she be taken seriously.</p><p>In a short moment, before Meng Qi could begin to retrace his steps, the yellow flag of Wuji Apricot and the flag of flame off the ground were on the verge of collapsing. They were about to be broken!</p><p>A golden light appeared in Maitreya’s hand, and a white mist hung in the air. The relic floated up and down, using it to resist the aftermath of the battle on the other shore.</p><p>It was the most precious item of Buddhism, the Green Lotus treasure-colored flag!</p><p>Should he take this opportunity to attack the other side? He had yet to have the opportunity to do so. Once he failed, he would be doomed, and there was no possibility of a second chance.</p><p>On the peak of Mount Lingshan, next to the Three Treasures Ruyi.</p><p>Ananda sat in the lotus position. A mysterious and strange reincarnation seal was rolling over his head. His body was full of substance, and there was no trace of Shadow.</p><p>It was unknown when, but he had quietly escaped!</p><p>In the air above Mount Numinous, a black golden spear with Phoenix Wings was emitting a strange light. It condensed the heaven and earth mysterious yellow exquisite pagoda, the Taiji morality scroll, the book of Saint Virtue, the ancient cauldron of fortune, and the banner of Yin Virtue, firmly suppressing the mystery of the seal of reincarnation.</p><p>The Monster Emperor Palace was floating in the strange light, quietly “Looking down”at Ah Nan.</p><p>The Monster Emperor was personally watching. No matter how mysterious and Strange Ah Nan’s methods were, there was no way he could escape silently!</p><p>The Devil Buddha suppressed the Three Treasures Ruyi while resisting the monster emperor’s terrifying will. He looked into the real world with a relaxed expression and said with a smile,</p><p>“It seems that Su Meng is going to be killed by the Gold Emperor…”</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The real world appeared as the sky collapsed and the Earth collapsed. The earth-leaving flame flag was flicked away by mother Wusheng with a finger. Its luster dimmed and it temporarily lost its spirituality. Golden Horn and silver horn, who were thirty-three heavens away, collapsed to the ground with dispirited expressions, the yellow flag of Wuji Apricot was about to be broken!</p><p>The power of the other shore was unstoppable!</p><p>Gu Xiaosang opened her eyes abruptly. Her eyes were as beautiful as the starry night sky. The demonic blood peach in her hand and the aura of Donghuang that was emitted from reversing the wusheng finger were added to her hands.</p><p>With this aura, she could feel the crazy and chaotic guy hiding in the darkness. She did not know whether to call him Donghuang or the monster of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s eyes were as calm as water. Her aura was going to reverse itself and merge with this monster of the Heavenly Dao!</p><p>Even if she would lose her spirituality, everything, and become a part of the monster of the Heavenly Dao, the short period of time before this could slightly affect her will. She could make her attack the Golden Emperor and buy time for her husband to reach the other shore of the Dao, she could fight for that Slim Chance of survival!</p><p>If he didn’t even dare to sacrifice himself to fight against the monster of the other side, he wouldn’t have a chance at all!</p><p>Hubby, when you reach the other side, please start with my sacrifice!</p><p>“This is the third preparation!”</p><p>“Hubby, when you reach the other side, you can reverse the time and resurrect me…”Gu Xiaosang outlined a beautiful but proud smile.</p><p>This was the first time she had planned the big picture and fought against the Golden Emperor. She hoped that she wouldn’t fail.</p><p>How would mother Wusheng be affected when he merged with the Monster of Heavenly Dao?</p><p>At this moment, a familiar figure appeared in front of Gu Xiaosang. It was Wang Siyuan, whose face was pale and looked like a woman. They looked at each other through the monster of Heavenly Dao’s “Tentacles.”.</p><p>Wang Siyuan hid in the nine immortal tombs. His eyes were filled with madness. He laughed and said,</p><p>“Leave this crazy thing to me!”</p><p>“I’ve been planning this for a long time. I want to overturn their chessboard today!”</p><p>A dark red vortex appeared in his eyes. His aura was exactly the same as that of the monster of the Heavenly Dao. His figure rushed into the darkness and set off a crazy storm. Wang Siyuan’s sense of existence was gradually assimilated!</p><p>How could he not die fighting against the other side?</p><p>Gu Xiaosang had no choice but to retreat. She shook her head and smiled:</p><p>“He’s actually half a monster of the Heavenly Dao. No wonder he could fool the other side…”</p><p>A dark red light suddenly appeared in the sky, and one chaotic and irregular vortex after another appeared, directly dragging the bright moon into the crazy world!</p><p>Taking this opportunity, Meng Qi took a step forward and “Rushed”toward the upper reaches of the river of time, waking up and connecting the past him one by one!</p><p>On the summit of Mount Ling, Devil Buddha Ananda saw the situation turn around. He was not shocked or angry, but there was a hint of a playful smile on his face.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
