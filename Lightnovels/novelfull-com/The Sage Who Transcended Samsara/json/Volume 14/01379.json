The Majesty seemed invisible, but it seemed to cover every corner. It weighed heavily on tan ping’s heart, making him panic and fear.</p><p>If this was only the brand of the heavenly emperor used in the river of time to maintain the changes of history, his actions would be abnormally dull. Facing the loss of the god Ascension Roll, he could only directly snatch it. How could he change the world and create a new universe like this, pulling himself and the water ancestor in front of him at the same time, unfathomable?</p><p>That was why he was the real celestial emperor. He did not know why he did not fall back then and mysteriously returned at the end of the Apocalypse!</p><p>The God Ascension Roll had finally provoked a big figure on the other shore!</p><p>The following changes were beyond Tan Ping’s imagination. Despair filled the air and cold sweat broke out.</p><p>Not only him, but the water ancestor was also uneasy and trembling in fear. He had just met the Celestial Emperor’s arch-enemy Cheng Tang when he was caught by him. Moreover, he had used an irresistible mystery to make himself change time and space in a strange manner, he was in a difficult situation to ask for help!</p><p>This move surpassed the water ancestor’s understanding of the heavenly monarch, and a ridiculous but reasonable thought suddenly emerged in his mind:</p><p>The young man beside him said that he came from the future, and that he was the reincarnation of himself who had gotten rid of the shackles of the innate god… the heavenly monarch’s realm and strength suddenly had a huge difference from the past… if the former was true, did it mean that the present belonged to history, but the heavenly monarch had achieved the other side in the ‘future’, so he was able to look down on the ocean of suffering whenever he wanted to?</p><p>If it was not for the innate God’s lack of sweat, the water ancestor would have already been drenched in cold sweat. The reason why he was so hesitant was because he did not want to offend either side, it was because the ‘present’heavenly monarch and Cheng Tang were both at the peak of the destiny realm and they had explored the other side. It was hard to say who would reach the other side in the future, but the reality before him told him that.., the future Heavenly Emperor would win and dominate the rest of his life!</p><p>Thinking of this, the water ancestor could only silently pray that the heavenly emperor would not change his mind at the last minute. It was best to spare him like in the past, so that he could live to the current point and reincarnate as the young man next to him..</p><p>The Heavenly Emperor looked at the water ancestor and Tan Ping quietly. They could not help but fight, wanting to beg for mercy. Then, he said indifferently,</p><p>“It’s better not to change the matter of Ascension.”</p><p>His right hand flashed with light gold, and the Ascension Board in Tan Ping’s mustard seed ring appeared in his palm at some point in time. It was tamed quietly, and the light was gentle.</p><p>Then, the Ascension Board flew out, fell into the lower realm, and hung up on the platform of the Qi mountain again.</p><p>..</p><p>On the top of the Fusang Ancient Tree, two opposite shores were playing chess. One was green, and the other was mysterious. Except for the round light, they looked like ordinary people.</p><p>Meng Qi held a white chess piece between his fingers as he looked at the chess game, he said leisurely, “After the Maitreya incident, the ‘Yellow Millet Pillow’and tan ping were completely exposed in the eyes of fellow Daoists from the other shores. This time, I sent him back to the year of ascension to alert the enemy. I want to see which fellow Daoists wish to snatch the god Ascension Board from the hands of the gold emperor. I want to see what plans they have after taking it.”</p><p>The God Ascension Roll was not something from the other shore. It was not the only thing in the past, present, and future. The current node in the hands of the gold emperor did not mean that it belonged to him in the past. Therefore, if there were great changes in the history of the god Ascension Roll.., it was very likely that he would lose the god Ascension Roll. In other words, he would do his best to maintain the relevant process.</p><p>In this way, if he had the idea of taking the god Ascension Roll at the current node, because it was in the hands of the gold emperor, he could only take action directly from the other shore. There was no way to go around it, but to snatch it in history.., one could only send out his subordinates and great divine arts practitioners to test each other out. There was room for maneuver, so as to avoid encountering unexpected changes and suffering unnecessary damage or weakening.</p><p>The green emperor saw that Meng Qi had made a move, he casually returned the favor and said, “The Golden Emperor’s response was quite clever. Without waiting for you to test him, he sent out the god Ascension roll by borrowing Shen Gongpao. It greatly changed history, causing all the fellow Daoists to be confused for a moment and unable to see the subsequent changes clearly. They were suspicious of each other and did not interfere rashly. Thus, this item was successfully sent into the hands of the Heavenly Emperor.”</p><p>After the destruction of Yin Shang, although the gods of the Heavenly Court had always focused on those on the god-ascension list, this treasure did not belong to the heavenly emperor. The list was hung near the capital of the Zhou dynasty, and the whip was in the hands of Jiang Ziya and his descendants, it could be said that the primordial beginning heavenly venerate and the moral heavenly venerate were holding back the heavenly emperor. But this time, the god-ascension list had actually passed through the hands of the heavenly emperor, and he had left his mark on it, subtly changing history.</p><p>Meng Qi played with the chess pieces in his hand, he smiled and said, “The Heavenly Emperor’s response was also quite unexpected. He returned the god-ascension board with only a little mark left. Other than having some tacit understanding with the gold emperor to confirm it, we can not see the corresponding changes in the future for the time being.”</p><p>If it were not for the people on the other shore continuing to be puzzled, even if they did not rashly interfere with the god-ascension board at the beginning, they could have gone back in time and come back again.</p><p>The Green Emperor did not answer, as if he was thinking about the chess game in front of him.</p><p>“The golden emperor is so confident. Aren’t you afraid that the Heavenly Emperor will force the god Ascension Board and make his Netherworld lose its support?”Meng Qi said calmly.</p><p>The Green Emperor smiled faintly. “He has always been good at planning and planning. He has always been more like an emperor than I am. He has also obtained the legacy of the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning and the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure, as well as many secrets. If we underestimate him, we will suffer a great loss just like Amitabha, Bodhi ancient Buddha, and the Devil Buddha Ananda.”</p><p>“Good.”Meng Qi laid down his son and clapped his hands with a smile, “When Yang Jian, the true lord of the mystical dao of Qingyuan, went to the Daoist’s world crossing treasure raft to take away my original body, I thought that this secret was left behind by the teacher of primordial beginning. However, the Golden Emperor has already admitted that after the whereabouts of the two heavenly venerates became a mystery, all the traces that they appeared were all faked or acted by him. That is to say, he had long known where the Daoist’s world crossing treasure raft was and was able to spy on the Daoist’s World Crossing Treasure Raft. However, he had been holding back all this while, so that even the Devil Buddha did not notice it. It was a careless miscalculation.”</p><p>“And since I came ashore, although he didn’t seem to have suffered any losses, and instead made it possible for him to further improve, on the surface, he was indeed forced to abandon his hometown of vacuum in the real world first. After that, he was confined to the netherworld. Now, he has even shared the god-ascension roll. He is really retreating step by step.”</p><p>“The more so, the more vigilant I am against him. I am worried that he has always been confident in his chances of winning, but he is deliberately showing weakness in order to make a final decision at the critical moment.”</p><p>The Green Emperor raised a few sons and asked, “What are the chances of Victory?”</p><p>“There are not many keys that can be hidden from us. When I broke free from the Sea of suffering, the Gold Emperor had already revealed quite a number of them. The rest should involve the secrets of the original teacher and senior Uncle Numinous Treasure. For example, the method of their dao fruit and their current state. The variables are really hard to predict,”meng Qi pointed out, “Just like when I ascended to godhood, I still don’t understand why Amitabha Buddha and ancient Bodhi Buddha would stand on teacher Yuan Shi’s and uncle-master Dao De’s side to jointly deal with uncle-master Lingbao who has lost his ally, the Monster Emperor. This has made the confrontation between those on the other side lose all suspense. From the perspective of the struggle for the Great Dao, helping uncle-master Lingbao, who has the weakest influence, and delaying the oldest teacher Yuan Shi is their inevitable choice.”</p><p>“I didn’t understand how it happened back then either.”Emperor Qing nodded slightly.</p><p>Some things couldn’t be understood just by looking at the past, because some transactions and secrets only existed between those on the other side. Without an opportunity, it was difficult to see through them.</p><p>“It’s a pity that you and I are still not ready. Otherwise, we could ‘help’senior uncle-master Lingbao to act as a deity again. We could throw stones and ask for directions, forcing out the ‘Heavenly Secrets’.”Meng Qi looked at Emperor Qing with a smile and flew away for a while.</p><p>Now that the original heavenly venerate and the heavenly venerate Lingbao were only imprints, there was no need to consider acting as a god-ascension player.</p><p>Emperor Qing looked at the chessboard calmly and put down the chess piece in his hand. He had the advantage in this game:</p><p>“I hope I have the chance.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
