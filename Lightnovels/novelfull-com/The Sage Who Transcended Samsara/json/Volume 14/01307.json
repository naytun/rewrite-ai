She didn’t seem like a great abhijna user who could censor his thoughts. Instead, she was like an ordinary person who was unfamiliar with the streets and gossiped about others. Her voice was fleeting and fleeting, it was as if she was squeezing out through the gaps in her teeth:</p><p>“Heavenly Lord of Numinous Treasure!”</p><p>Heavenly Lord of Tongtian! At the same time, Meng Qi almost blurted out. After proving the legend and being able to introspect every thought, he could still vividly remember the books and poems he had read in the past. It was as if he had just recited them a few times.</p><p>And the heavenly lord of Tongtian and the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure had different titles for the same big shot!</p><p>He had actually met the ancient man on the other side. The Heavenly Lord of Numinous Treasure in the three pure ones symbolized “From existence to nothingness”!</p><p>No! Could it be something like the remnant of the Heavenly Emperor in the Big Dipper Carriage? Not the Real Heavenly Lord of Tongtian?</p><p>No! The Heavenly Emperor had already fallen, so the remnant shadow did not have the corresponding power. But if it was the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure, the remnant shadow was equivalent to the real body. The Phantom could turn into the real body, and time and space were one!</p><p>Just as the two of them were in a mess and were about to follow the example of the ancient Buddha of burning lamp and the heavenly venerate of many treasures to avoid the attack, they saw waves of light surging around the indistinct figure that was shrouded in auspicious light. The clear and perfect light behind its head.., there was not a single flaw. It was as if the treasure light that contained all the possible theories was expanding at a seemingly slow but actually fast speed. It enveloped the world, and it was clear and blurry.</p><p>Meng Qi and Liu Luo did not have the time to dodge at all. They were in a daze before their eyes, and their bodies felt washed away. It was as if they had sunk into the long river of time from the Big Dipper Sovereign’s chariot.</p><p>Wasn’t it said that the heavenly venerate of spiritual treasure had been missing for a long time? As this thought appeared in his mind, Meng Qi’s body and mind trembled. His vision returned to clarity. He saw the surrounding light sparkling and flowing slowly. It contained the vicissitudes of life that would not return after the passage of time. It soaked into his body like it had never changed since ancient times.</p><p>The ancient shore that was riding the Kui cow was traveling against the long river. It did not even look at him or Liu Luo.</p><p>The surrounding waves suddenly changed and reflected Meng Qi’s familiar island, familiar world, and familiar pavilion. It was the Golden Ao Island that was derived from the prehistoric fragments. It was the supreme pure realm that was once equal to the supreme pure realm and the Great Scarlet Heaven, it was the green touring palace that had an ethereal immortal aura and left a deep mark in his family’s life!</p><p>In the Green Touring Palace, the Heavenly Lord of Numinous Treasure, who was riding on the Kui cow just now, was sitting high above the rolling five qi and lecturing about the Great Dao. The bright and clear treasure light behind his head shone on every corner of the palace, making it perfectly flawless, however, the audience who sat down to listen to the lecture was no longer as grand as when ten thousand immortals came to the imperial court. There were only a few dozen of them.</p><p>His voice vaguely reached the ears of Meng Qi and Liu Luo. It was not as ancient as they had imagined. On the contrary, it was as clear and clear as a prime year. Every sentence was thought-provoking and thought-provoking, as if he was explaining the mysteries of the Great Dao and the secrets of the epoch, even with Liu Luo’s status as a knowledgeable ancient god, he was a little intoxicated by it. He was focused, afraid that he would miss out any sentence.</p><p>Ever since the human emperor passed away, the other shore acting technique was already something that was hard to come by in the world!</p><p>At this moment, the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure raised his head slightly. A pair of eyes suddenly became clear and made direct contact with Meng Qi and Liu Luo’s eyes!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>Meng Qi and Liu Luo felt as if they had been struck by lightning. Their entire bodies went numb. The Grand Supreme Wuji origin Shi Qingyun and the Nine Heavens Xuan Qi qingyun simultaneously stirred up ripples. They only felt that the pair of eyes were aloof and deep. It was difficult to understand, but they were clearly sizing themselves up, they did not know how much time and history had passed, but they were sizing themselves up!</p><p>The other shore could not be seen!</p><p>The Heavenly Lord of Numinous Treasure withdrew his gaze. The water waves suddenly shook, and the green touring palace shattered into pieces.</p><p>When everything was clear, he once again sat on the back of the Kui Cow and continued to move upwards along the river of time. A terrifying clear light flew up from the depths of the long river and landed in his palm. It turned into an ancient longsword, and the dao patterns on it interweaved, it condensed into the word “Qingping.”Where the Qingping Sword flew up, Meng Qi vaguely saw the golden ao island and the dark, squirming ball of strange blood.</p><p>Frustrated that their lecturing on the other side had been interrupted, the two looked at each other and saw the confusion in each other’s eyes. Then, they restrained their emotions, suppressed their thoughts, and quietly watched.</p><p>Time flowed endlessly. Meng Qi and Liu Luo had no ability to swim up at all. They could only watch as the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure held the Qingping Sword in his hand, and the back of his head was shrouded in a clear and perfect light. Riding on the auspicious light kui cow, he stepped on the water-like time, he walked back step by step.</p><p>Suddenly, the wave of light surged, and the image changed. It was as if a quiet mountain peak appeared. Waves of terrifying and tyrannical aura appeared, directly distorting all of Meng Qi’s senses, making him unable to see clearly anymore, he could only vaguely see the heaven and earth, the mysterious yellow exquisite pagoda, the Taiji moral diagram, and so on interweaving into the phoenix pattern of five virtues.</p><p>“Lingshan! The battle that destroyed Lingshan!”Meng Qi said in a deep voice.</p><p>That mountain bore too many memories of its own past. It was something that it did not dare to forget day and night. It was always on guard, so how could it not recognize it?</p><p>That was the former Buddhist temple, the core of the Saha Pure Land, the Lingshan in its heart!</p><p>And demon Saint had only come to Lingshan once, the battle that destroyed ten thousand Buddhas!</p><p>At this time, Lingbao heavenly venerate, who was riding on a Kui cow, had already entered the range of Lingshan. It completely blurred Meng Qi and Liu Luo’s vision. Only a magnificent and majestic voice was heard:</p><p>“I will be the ruler of the final tribulation!”</p><p>Crackle, crackle, crackle. Light of various colors rose. The scene of the spiritual mountain could no longer be seen.</p><p>Liu Luo was silent for a few moments. Suddenly, he let out a long sigh and said, “I did not expect him to intervene in the Battle of the Spiritual Mountain…”</p><p>In the Battle of the Spiritual Mountain, ten thousand Buddhas fell together. The demons were also greatly injured. Very few managed to walk out alive. More importantly, when Sun Wukong broke through the spiritual mountain and sealed the demon ox king and the other great sages, it was the beginning of the battle on the other shore, in other words, Amitabha, Bodhi ancient Buddha and the others on the other side did not mention it. Unless the demon saint was resurrected and the Monkey King spoke, no one would know what happened.</p><p>“No wonder the demon saint did not have time to save his subordinates.”Meng Qi sighed.</p><p>The light projection faded and the heavenly lord of Lingbao, who was riding on the Kui cow, appeared once again. He was still moving against the light projection, heading towards the past.</p><p>Another wave of light surged, and a new scene appeared. The nine layers of the hazy immortal world were high up in the sky. Then, they were shaken by the auras that spanned the past, present, and future. Everything became blurry again, distorting Meng Qi and Liu Luo’s senses.</p><p>“The Battle of the fall of the heavenly court…”Liu Luo’s gaze was slightly dazed, and his tone was filled with regret.</p><p>He did not expect that he would be able to witness the nightmare scene again today.</p><p>As the heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure rode on the Kui cow and broke through the fog to step onto the highest level of the ninth heaven, Meng Qi vaguely saw a Qing cloud that covered the entire realm. It was a dark and chaotic Qing cloud!</p><p>The Qing cloud shone, and the golden lamp shone for tens of thousands of years. The lotus flowers bloomed, and the Jade Rose Rose and fell. The light shone on each other, and it was the perfect supreme boundless primordial Qi Qing Cloud!</p><p>The heavenly venerate of primordial beginning!</p><p>This was the first time he had seen primordial qi heavenly venerate, even if it was because of the reappearance of history… Meng Qi’s heart surged, and he opened his wise eyes. He tried his best to see Primordial Qi heavenly venerate clearly, but all he could see was that green cloud.</p><p>The aura interweaved, distorting his senses, and the scene could not be seen. However, at this moment, Meng Qi heard an ancient voice that seemed familiar yet strange. It contained the original meaning of the voice, and it came from afar, it seemed to be sighing:</p><p>“The matter of the dao fruit is indeed difficult to fake…”</p><p>The voice echoed, and Meng Qi and Liu Luo were both in a daze. It took them a long time to recover. They saw that the prime of Tongtian, who was riding on the Kui cow, had long left the heavenly court and was falling. He was moving upstream, toward the depths of time.</p><p>The scene of the journey to the west appeared, but the heavenly lord of Numinous Treasure was still sitting in the green touring palace preaching the Dao. He almost did not interfere.</p><p>Immediately after, he rode on the Kui cow again and traveled backward. A long time had passed.</p><p>However, when Meng Qi felt that he was about to return to the Battle of Ascension, Lingbao Heavenly Venerate’s figure disappeared. He had completely disappeared. The river of time had stopped flowing there. It was cut off from the past!</p><p>“The river of time has stopped flowing?”Meng Qi and Liu Luo actually spoke at the same time.</p><p>The shimmering waves could not be changed. Their vision blurred once again. Then, they realized that they had returned to the Big Dipper Divine Chariot. They were in the depths of the dark void. What they saw just now seemed like a dream.</p><p>The light in Liu Luo’s eyes jumped, and his wisdom flickered. After pondering for a moment, he suddenly opened his mouth:</p><p>“I understand why Yuan Shi chose to ascend to Godhood and why morality chose to travel to the west to cover something up.”</p><p>Hearing this, meng Qi also came to a realization. “Yuan Shi opened the source of time and chose to ascend to godhood from the real world in order to hide the whereabouts of Lingbao heavenly venerate. Dao heavenly venerate chose to travel to the west in order to hide the whereabouts of Yuan Shi heavenly venerate. If we want to know the final destination of the two, I’m afraid we have to combine the three realms and return the river of time to its original State!”</p><p>This was truly a difficult mission!</p><p>At this point, Meng Qi was startled and said solemnly, “But the words of the primordial Lord of Heaven were filled with a deep meaning.”</p><p>“The matter of the dao fruit is indeed difficult to fake?”Liu Luo frowned slightly.</p><p>“Yes, it looks like he was moved by the mystery of the Dao fruit. However, from another perspective, it can be seen that when the several other shores joined forces to fight the heavenly court, it was probably to achieve the dao fruit! “And this is also the reason why the Heavenly Emperor tried to get rid of the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning and the heavenly venerate of morality to establish his own sect, right?”Meng Qi’s gaze was deep, he looked into the distance.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
