It was even more difficult to activate his martial potential and give full play to his kung fu. Consequently, this would cause his defeat because of his lessened physical strength.</p><p>The former 27 blades were indeed more forcible than the last one defeating Luo Youfeng, for they must be swayed by a move-changing master in an unimaginable preciseness with his horizon, kung fu, and mind combined together.</p><p>Compared with the former 27 blades, the last one was not so marvelous, even though it was one of the creme de la cremes. It had bladesmanship essence and set hidden traps to lure enemies.</p><p>The Jianghu men present recalled the battle between Meng Qi and Jin Jinxian. The further they thought, the more profoundly they considered it a feast of sword art and bladesmanship.</p><p>Besides, they did not belittle Jin Jinxian. Although Jin Jinxian was less powerful than Meng Qi, he had shown good inner force and the Upstanding Qi. Old as he was, he wielded 28 movements against Meng Qi so he was defeated graciously. Nobody knew how many movements Jin Jinxian would have defended if Meng Qi had not given precedence to him out of courtesy.</p><p>Since the result was unknown, they also wanted to show respect for Club Principal Jin like always, after all, he was a legend in Yedu.</p><p>However, in their eyes, Su Meng, who used to be known as Thunder Blade Furious Monk, was far beyond their imagination.</p><p>He did not even use the Exterior movements of Gist of Trueness.</p><p>He deserved his reputation in the Ranking List of Young Masters.</p><p>Currently, Meng Qi cupped one hand in the other over his chest to Wang Zai, thanking him for a fair and just explanation. He shouted to the Huang family’s VIP room, “With much appreciation for Flower-dropping Master, I really admire you and hope you can instruct me at this time tomorrow.”</p><p>Flower-dropping Master Huang Zishi was billed as one of the three, who could have probably been recorded in the Ranking List of Young Masters. He had apprehended the Gist of Trueness of Cloud-flying Flower-dropping Technique, accomplishing the primary level of it and acquiring one palmsmashing art of the Exterior. Their spar was publicly regarded as fair because people were eager to know the strength distance between a master who was not on the list and one who was on the list. They also wanted to know if he was capable of entering the list even though he lacked opportunities.</p><p>In the VIP room, the old man of the Huang family darkened his face after hearing Wang Zai’s explanation. As the external affairs Deacon, he had spent almost his entire life opening Nine Apertures. It was normal that he could not understand all the sharp bladesmanships and sword arts. However, he felt humiliated in front of the inferiors in his family when Wang Zai explained to the public.</p><p>When Meng Qi wanted to challenge Huang Zishi, his face became livid. According to Wang Zai, Meng Qi was much more powerful than his nephew. This was not a proper opportunity for him to enter the list.</p><p>Huang Zishi’s expression changed slightly. He waved his folding fan, smiled and said, “It’s my pleasure to contend against you. I’ll wait for you this time tomorrow.”</p><p>Though Huang Zishi was shocked by Meng Qi’s strength, he was also confident in his own. Meng Qi had Ananda Buddhist Commandment Blade; Huang Zishi had mastered Flower-dropping and Water-flowing. Meng Qi was adept at bladesmanship; Huang Zishi had grasped the Cloud-flying Flower-dropping Technique. As long as Meng Qi didn’t call Sky Thunder, he had a narrow chance of defeating him.</p><p>A martial artist would not lose confidence when his strength was similar his rivals.</p><p><em>“Hehe, after two competitions, someone finally calls me by my new nickname …”</em> None of the common people would understand Meng Qi’s thoughts. If Huang Zishi knew what he was thinking, he would probably vomit blood. Huang Zishi was high-spirited and had accepted his challenge, but he was overjoyed at his nick name “Furious Blade”.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled in his heart, and then flew directly to his room. Even though his body movement was similar to when he’d jumped off, in the eyes of people of the Martial Artists Community, they were totally different. When he jumped off, he looked like a giant bird with strong momentum; when he flew back, they considered it a marvelous hidden trick.</p><p>Standing beside the window, Gu Xiaosang held her red cheeks with two hands. With her eyes drifting, she said, “Master, you really looked like a master.”</p><p>KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! Someone was at the door.</p><p>“Who is it?” Meng Qi asked in a deep tone. He had just returned to his seat.</p><p>He could not see clearly who was outside the door with his senses.</p><p>“Green-ribbon Arrester Kong Yu from Yedu, the Wang family from Zhou County Wang Ce, Wang Zai, Huanhua Swords Sect, Du Shaobai and Qi Zhengyan want to visit Young Master Su.” A deep voice sounded outside the door.</p><p><em>“That sounds normal …”</em> MengQi nodded his head slightly, signaling Gu Xiaosang to open the door.</p><p>Because a competition had been forthcoming, they had not wanted to disturb Meng Qi. Now that the spar was over, they had to visit him.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang walked elegantly toward the door with a smile on her face, looking like a qualified maid. She opened the door and paid tribute to them.</p><p>Kong Yu looked like a middle-aged scholar. He wore a dark red Six Fan School robe with a light blue ribbon on his waist.</p><p>He was composed and calm. Next to him were Meng Qi’s acquaintances: Wang Ce, Wang Zai, Qi Zhengyan, Shan Xiumei, and the Wang family’s old servants. Meng Qi had never met the External Affairs Deacon of Huanhua Swords Sect, Du Shaobai before. He was in his thirties and wore a loose robe. He had a long beard and tied his hair up with a hairpin. He looked very handsome.</p><p>Kong Yu nodded to Gu Xiaosang in a courteous manner, quietly turning his head to look at Meng Qi. He said,</p><p>“It’s Yedu’s honor to welcome Young Master Su.”</p><p>Among the visitors, except for one from the Six Fan School, the people of the Wang family from Zhou County and Huanhua Swords Sect stood as two big forces. Each one had a stronger influence than the Six Fan School in Huan Province. However, the Six Fan School enjoyed an incredibly powerful authority; it had a strong influence and stood for the imperial court, which was a Gold-lettered signboard for aristocratic families. Aristocratic families often had disputes with sects, so they did not want to humiliate the imperial court.</p><p>Meng Qi paid tribute to each one and asked them to be seated. Gu Xiaosang was engaged in calling the errand boy and servant girl to serve tea.</p><p>Meng Qi was quite surprised that Shan Xiumei did not recognize Gu Xiaosang who had long chased her in a bid to kill her. Honestly speaking, he was afraid that he would also be unable to identify her if he had not witnessed the change in her temperament and he had not made dealings with her. She had also started wearing makeup.</p><p>As the legitimate son of the Wang family, Wang Ce was there on behalf of the Wang family in such circumstances. He held the teacup, took a sip and said, ” Master Su, are you here to challenge heroes and legends to enhance your bladesmanship?”</p><p>He preferred to call him Master Su rather than Young Master.</p><p>Having finished her work, Gu Xiaosang stood quietly behind Meng Qi. She remained completely motionless, so Wang Zai and the others neglected her.</p><p>Meng Qi chose to show himself rather than use a cool disguise. He smiled and said, “After being expelled from Shaolin Temple, I’ve become a free cultivator. It’s inconvenient for me to receive instruction and obtain scripts and resources. Given that the Military Selectee will be held in each province in late spring and early summer, I want to seek fame and restart a new world.”</p><p>“There’re many heroes in Huan Province, especially in Yedu. Thus, I must continue practicing and challenge all masters while waiting for the Military Selectee.”</p><p>“So that’s it.” A gentle smile emerged on Kong Yu’s face. He warmly welcomed any master on the Ranking List of Young Masters, who was allegiant to the imperial court and wanted to embrace a bright future.</p><p>Other large aristocratic families had disputes and sometimes fights with the Zhao Clan from the Divine Capital, but they would protect the imperial court in unison, for the imperial family itself had an incredibly powerful authority. After all, aristocratic families could fight together with it against the sects. The imperial court was always rich in resources and scripts, which was a magnet for free cultivators and dishonored disciples. Plus, the imperial court would also endow them with lands and minerals as well as official fame to a new Exterior master’s family. The Six Fan School exhibited a strong influence in the provinces and could manipulate small forces and families’ deaths. In a word, no one was unwilling to work for the Six Fan School.</p><p>Had aristocratic families and sects not constricted the Six Fan School, it would have expanded its influence.</p><p>Hearing what Meng Qi said, Wang Ce nodded his head slightly and said, “You’re highly talented. You’ll be a master of bladesmanship and break through the Exterior sooner or later. Why would you attend the Military Selectee? Although our family isn’t that powerful, we can also provide generous scripts and resources for you.”</p><p>He showed his intention to welcome Meng Qi in front of Kong Yu. That was the momentum of big aristocratic families and sects.</p><p>Du Shaobai remained speechless. He also wanted to rope the young listed master in. However, Thunder Blade Furious Monk had been expelled from Shaolin Temple. Shaolin Temple would be annoyed to see a sect draw him in as a Foreign Official and give him another impartation. Since they shared a good relationship, he would not do that.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan gazed forward steadily and focused on drinking his tea. He had traveled with Little Zi and met Gu Xiaosang. He could guess that the maid behind Meng Qi was the famous Demoness of Grand Luo even though he could not identify her. Plus, Meng Qi had told him about the Successor of Mystic Fairy.</p><p>Meng Qi sighed and said, “Thanks for your appreciation, but I’ve made my decision.”</p><p>This matter was difficult to explain, so he saved his words.</p><p>Wang Ce nodded his head and did not say anything more. After chatting a bit, they chose to leave. Outside the room, he said to Wang Zai, “Brother, do you also attend the Military Selectee?”</p><p>“Yes.” Wang Zai replied with certainty.</p><p>If disciples of big aristocratic families wanted to strengthen their families’ influence in the imperial court, they attended the Military and Civilized Selectee.</p><p>“Do you have confidence in defeating Su Meng?” Wang Ce asked in a deep tone. He looked every part the Master of the Wang family.</p><p>The Military Selectee of Huan Province had 30 spots, but it would be no problem for Wang Zai or Meng Qi to seize one. The Wang family was totally capable of arranging their competition in advance.</p><p>After some consideration, Wang Zai said, “I won’t know until our fight is over.”</p><p>“Su Meng will definitely be a challenge. Brother, why not cultivate in seclusion for some time and wait for him?” suggested Wang Ce.</p><p>Wang Zai shook his head. With a confident smile, he said, “I want to see him win. Each time he wins, my fighting desire is enhanced. It’s hard to find another rival on par with myself.”</p><p>That was what he always did to increase his momentum.</p><p>Closing the door, Gu Xiaosang murmured, “She’s so wary to even be involved with such a trivial thing.”</p><p>She stared at Meng Qi with wide eyes and said, “You’ll challenge one disciple of the Wang family after defeating Huang Zishi, and then Wang Zai. I don’t believe Wang Ce, the legitimate son, will stay out of this matter.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
