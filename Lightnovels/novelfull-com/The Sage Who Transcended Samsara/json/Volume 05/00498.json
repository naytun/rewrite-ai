The attack transformed into an endless net of sabers, a hell on earth, and enveloped his surroundings.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The explosion of purple lightning sent Zhao Heng flying, causing his mouth and nose to overflow with blood.</p><p>He had been straining to hold up against the consecutive attacks of Aunt Bai and Yan Chong earlier and exhausted a fair amount of his strength. He would not be able to recover to his peak condition in a short time.</p><p>Thunder God was trying to extinguish two mosquitos with one saber attack, yet at that moment, another bright sword light emerged from behind him. It was as if a purple Milky Way had ascended to the Ninth Heaven, washing away the tide and revolving to make a return. With every step, it transformed into dragons that carried the intent to fly toward the Nine Heavens.</p><p>“Damn it!” Thunder God hacked the void eight times in anger after his body was slashed. Only then did he relax his arm. Nine purple mad dragons bore their fangs and brandished their claws in the air, meeting Meng Qi’s saber.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The airflow collapsed as Yin and Yang collided with one another. Overhead, the terrifying sound of rolling thunders resounded. The purple river of stars was swallowing the purple lightning dragon, tearing and crushing it.</p><p>Clang! The sword and saber struck at the same time and then, even as his mouth was spewing blood and lightning was scorching his skin, Qi Zhengyan threw his sword, sending it flying. His sword pierced the red clouds and shattered the mist and smoke.</p><p>Thunder God’s murderous intent became even stronger. He was about to raise his saber when he detected the breaths of Ruan Yushu, Zhao Heng, and Qi Zhengyan muddled in the air. It seemed that he could only resist one more attack from them.</p><p>Suddenly, he looked as if he had sensed something. He glanced in the direction where Meng Qi and Six-annihilation Devilman were, all while the formation was beginning to shake as if it was about to shatter.</p><p>He clenched his teeth as he considered the fact that the formation would collapse at any time, so he instantly left. It did not matter when he killed these pesky mosquitos; his safety was his first priority.</p><p>Seeing this, Ruan Yushu closed her eyes and her body swayed backward as she fainted.</p><p>…</p><p>“What sort of swordsmanship is this…” Stunned, Six-annihilation Devilman instantly left with his voice drifting faintly in the air.</p><p>Meng Qi turned to look into the distance and saw Thunder God from the Ninth Heaven escaping while Zhao Heng and Qi Zhengyan struggled to get back on their feet. He said calmly, “It’s a swordsmanship I accumulated from the realization that the Wordless Stone Stele had triggered. It was something that appeared when I mastered the comprehension of my Inner World. It was most suitable for me and stronger than Dharmakaya movements beyond my realm.”</p><p>“It’s called the Big Bang Technique.”</p><p>This reminded Six-annihilation Devilman of the deep crack on the Wordless Stone Stele. He could feel his blade injury, prompting him to wear a bitter smile as he stood up. “It’s, as expected, the same…”</p><p>The saber mark on his mid-brows began to deepen, the effect extending downwards to gradually split apart his body. He saw only signs of the stars, Grand Sun, Golden Crow and Chaotic Hole returning to Meng Qi’s body. He no longer felt as if he was amid rising winds and scudding clouds and could not help his amazement. “You’re not going to take advantage of this to advance your realm? It’s such an exceedingly rare opportunity to break through in one fell swoop.”</p><p>Meng Qi smiled. “Sometimes, there are things that you wouldn’t bother about if you didn’t know of their existence. If you knew, you would have to clarify and perfect it. The firmer your foundation is, the further you can advance.”</p><p><em>“To describe this in a phrase from my past life, it would be: ‘Sorry, I basically have OCD…'”</em></p><p>The karma binds, at least, were not blocking his current breakthrough. Even if he had borrowed Su Ziyuan’s physical body, the binds would only affect his mental state, causing him to spend more time on cultivation, and leave some concealed danger for the future. During the incident with the Tang family last time, Meng Qi had been trying to learn Karma Fruit. Now, he was trying to eliminate the concealed dangers of karma.</p><p>There would only be no regrets if he opened his Hidden Latch. Naturally, he had to return to his peak as soon as possible.</p><p>“You… You’re not afraid that you won’t get another chance?” Six-annihilation Devilman watched his skull separate as the deepening of the crack extended downwards. He could already see the inner organs and vertebra in his torso.</p><p>“Chance…” The corners of Meng Qi’s mouth lifted as he chuckled, unconcerned. He changed the topic and said, “Brother Top Scorer, even though I’ve killed several of your devils, it’s not a crime that constitutes you all to scheme such a conspiracy and use spells to kill me, is it not?”</p><p>Before his very eyes, Six-annihilation Devilman’s breath began to change after being cut. The Devilman was none other than the top scorer in the palace examination, Fan Changmiao!</p><p>Fan Changmiao’s skull split open, creating an incredibly malevolent scene. He chuckled, sustaining himself solely on a strand of Vital Spirit. “You… You can ask me that when you join me in hell…”</p><p>His body was split entirely in half and fell to the ground with two thudding sounds – he was devoid of all vitality.</p><p>Looking at his corpse, Meng Qi secretly thought to himself, <em>“I’m sure either the Destruction Sect or Fan Changmiao has a secret technique that can perfectly conceal one’s cultivation and realm before unleashing one’s entire strength. Even Exterior masters would find it hard to notice. Furthermore, the technique can also imitate another person’s breath and appearance. Its difference from Eight Nine Mysteries is that its strength doesn’t lie in mimicking cultivation methods. Once one makes his move, he would instantly lose the concealed breath and appearance. That’s unless, of course, the opponent is weak…”</em></p><p><em>“The Evil Spirit sure deserves its reputation for being capable of countless changes…”</em></p><p><em>“Is Disillusionment Demon the Master of the Gu family of the Zhu Prefecture that Fan Changmiao met the other day?”</em></p><p><em>“No wonder Fang Changmiao would leave the city to receive Yan Chong the other day. He had likely done that to cover up his whereabouts after killing the Head of the Escort Agency of Central Province with Disillusionment Demon…”</em></p><p>This was the inference that he had deduced after their battle earlier.</p><p>While contemplating, he squatted down and began examining the items that Fan Changmiao had carried.</p><p>Since it would be hard to conceal precious treasures, his identity as a top scorer would only allow him to wear a Space Ring. Meng Qi only found a Refined Weapon in the shape of a long sword, a pair of black gloves that seemed as fragile as cicada’s wings, a bag of silvers, and a Silvery Badge of the Six Fan School.</p><p>With a surge in his Qi, he dashed towards Yuan Rushu and the rest.</p><p>Zhao Heng and Qi Zhengyan had given Ruan Yushu first aid but she remained unconscious. Her breath gradually became irreversibly weak as if the cost for playing the Sky-splitting and Earth-changing Tune was too great.</p><p>The tune was so difficult that it took Ruan Yushu, who had an innate talent for playing the zither, many years to just comprehend the basics of it. She had to use Blue Sky Heavenly Tune so that she could even play the first verse of the Sky-splitting and Earth-changing Tune. It was evident that its terrifying force and backlash were not simple!</p><p>Furthermore, the Sky-splitting and Earth-changing Tune was a continuous melody while the 12 Magical Sounds of Langhuan could be played in sections and didn’t demand a series of similar tunes. The latter did not require too much of her energy.</p><p>Meng Qi did not hesitate. He instantly fed her a Recovery Pill and helped to improve her blood circulation in order to catalyze the medicine.</p><p>She slowly returned to consciousness a short while later. Though her breath had yet to recover, at least its continual decline had been halted.</p><p>Suddenly, the voice of the Dominator of the Six Samsara Realms boomed.</p><p>“The Sumptuous Fruits Banquet has been unexpectedly cut short and exceeded the requirements that you emerge the champion in all three subjects. Your mission is judged to be complete. I hereby award you 1,500 Karma points each.”</p><p>“Considering the fact that one of the teams sustained non-deadly injuries as well as the fact that the occurrence of unexpected circumstances couldn’t guarantee that the secret of the Samsara wasn’t revealed, you may only return after seven days.”</p><p><em>“Damn, the Dominator sure knows how to play a joke!”</em> Meng Qi could not help scolding the Dominator under his breath. Fortunately, none of them received life-threatening wounds.</p><p>On second thought, he realized that this was the first time something like this had happened. Nothing similar ever occurred in other Samsara worlds. Since when did the Dominator worry about being seen dragging away Samsara travelers? He had all sorts of tricks up his sleeve to mask their disappearances!</p><p>Did this mean that his world was unique?</p><p>Or did the Dominator have misgivings about something?</p><p>…</p><p>The sword radiance was like water; heaven and earth shifted in color. The operation of the formation instantly halted. Though Sima Shi was nearby, the other Exterior masters were slowing him down and blocking his path. For a while, he was not in a position to rescue.</p><p>On the other hand, the field of vision of Su Yue and the other Super Arresters remained black and white. They still could not move.</p><p>The formation, like a water screen that had frozen over, was pierced by the saber radiance. The radiance finally fell on the body of the aged Emperor.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, the Emperor aged by no less than 30 years. Hair had fallen cleanly off his head, and so did his teeth. His wrinkles were so deep that they could trap and crush a mosquito inside.</p><p>His vision turned blurry. Now that he was close to death’s door, he subconsciously thought of his ambition in life: to revive the royal family. Even if he could not damage the aristocratic families, he wanted to at least break away from their control.</p><p>He had suffered in silence patiently, always carrying his resolution to realize his ambition. Today, he could finally see some hope.</p><p>Prince Qi must succeed!</p><p>When one part of the formation was chipped, it began to also crumble everywhere. The formation trembled violently as it inched closer to total collapse. It was no longer able to keep all the masters from escaping it.</p><p>The aged Emperor watched as ‘Heaven Sovereign’ took a step forward and left the formation. He ascended to a high altitude and, from a distance, slashed at the imperial palace.</p><p>The passing of time was akin to a saber; a saber was akin to the passing of time. It urged the aging of people and the decaying of objects. The dragon formed from the power of all living beings withered in defeat and instantly decayed. The Grand Formation of Luoyang that protected the imperial palace split open and a giant crack appeared.</p><p>Purple lightning danced atop the middle of Zhao Wuyan’s brows, looking as if it was repelling yet absorbing at the same time. This was the most crucial point. The Emperor Sword flew out from his right hand, traveling grandiosely and majestically as it drew the formation. Exuding the dignity of a Human Sovereign, he barely blocked the saber radiance before it hit him.</p><p>The breath of all living beings glinted and decayed non-stop in the water-like formation. The precious sword nimbly moved about, dodging and weaving. It possessed a spiritual nature yet was controlled by no one. Under the tip of the sword wielded by ‘Heaven Sovereign’, it was finally shattered.</p><p>The Nine-dragon Seal in Zhao Wuyan’s left hand flew out and nine true dragons materialized, twisting and twirling as they flew up. The dragons, along with the Emperor Sword, drew the formation. After much difficulty, they were finally able to obstruct Heaven Sovereign!</p><p>Observing the situation, Cui Qingyu retrieved his sword and communicated with those far away. The other masters of aristocratic families stopped Sima Shi and a few other Super Arresters.</p><p>The entire formation, as well as the Jade Forest Garden, shattered into pieces. The underground water began pouring through the deep cracks on the ground. The entire scene looked like something out of a doomsday.</p><p>Pingjin City, Di Province.</p><p>Over in Pingjin City, Di Province, an elegant middle-aged man with a beard the length of about five nets, was meditating with his eyes closed as purple clouds curled up around him.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The sword in Cui Qingyu’s hand cut through the purple clouds, soaring as if it possessed spiritual nature, and slashed at the imperial palace.</p><p>The part of the Grand Formation of Luoyang in which the sword had struck would instantly stop operating!</p><p>The Nine-dragon Seal and Emperor Sword put up a bitter resistance against Heaven Sovereign. The golden lightning and purple light lingering on Zhao Wuyan’s mid-brows gradually dimmed, losing the power to block the sword. He braced for the impact of the sword striking the palace.</p><p>Just then, the void behind him shook as if there was an intangible person there.</p><p>“The world of mortals is like a prison; all living beings are suffering. The wheel of reincarnation never ends; suffering is perpetual. Have mercy on my people; the Gods are dawning on us. Ajati Matriarch, Vacuum Hometown!”</p><p>A fair, translucent finger appeared and magnified before his eyes. It then tapped on the sword enveloped in the purple clouds.</p><p>“Ajati Matriarch, Vacuum Hometown!”</p><p>White lotus flowers floated down amid the ceaseless sound of unpredictability and ethereality.</p><p>Dharma King Dushi! Somewhere in Pingjin City, Di Province, Cui Qinghe’s eyes were bright with purple thunder. The sword suspended over Luoyang was like the emergence of Dharma and Logos, its every strike capable of breaking the formation.</p><p>However, Dharma King Zhenkong was not any weaker at all, thus the two of them were trapped in a deadlock.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Thunder so terrible that it was frightening enough to knock one out resounded in the air. The golden-purple lightning was fairly discernible. The vortex in the centre of the brows of Zhao Wuyan abruptly seeped into his skin and a bright light burst from his body. His fearsome breath rumbled and surged straight up toward the skies.</p><p>^^ Translate above ^^</p><p>Due to the pull, the golden-purple lightning suddenly changed. First, it turned a pure purple and then to the color of the primal chaos.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The lightning from the primal chaos struck as Zhao Wuyan bellowed.</p><p>Clash! The primal chaos submerged the eunuch pavilion nearby the Tai Ji Palace. The golden light was only lit momentarily before it was rapidly swallowed.</p><p>Zhao Wuyan’s roar resounded far and wide until it became increasingly weak, without any follow-up…</p><p>“Go.” Progenitor Doumu stood up and warned Lord of Purity and Magic, his voice devoid of emotion.</p><p>The battle in the air ended with a groan. The fair finger stopped in puzzlement before instantly disappearing into the void.</p><p>The unbearably decrepit Emperor felt waves of grief amid his vague consciousness when he heard no more of the thunder. Tears trailed down from the corner of his eyes as he died with grievances.</p><p>Sima Shi and several Super Arresters who knew of the plan stopped in their tracks, ending all forms of resistance.</p><p>Meanwhile, every master looked dumbfounded, unable to grasp what had happened.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
