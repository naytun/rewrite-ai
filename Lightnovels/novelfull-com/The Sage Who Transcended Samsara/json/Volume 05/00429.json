Yuanyang and her companions returned to the ethereal square where they first met. The success of their mission left an irresistible grin on their faces despite the nauseous sensation of traveling through the Samsara realms.</p><p>They looked at each other as the discomfort faded. Eyes were glittering with excitement and the delight of mutual understanding of their fruitful cooperation. Despite the challenging difficulties they had faced during the mission, they were not hampered by any significant adversity aside from their first ordeal at the inn. Their triumph had averted the sowing of seeds of distrust and skepticism, relieving them from the burden of blaming each other. The trials and tribulations that they have endured together have made them brothers and sisters in arms.</p><p>Still, the bedrock of their relationship could not yet be said to be genuinely steadfast and unyielding. That is, not without the sorrow of failure and the pain of death to test them.</p><p>“Our mentor ! Where is he?” Weng Lingyu asked in surprise.</p><p>She frantically looked around. Still, their mentor was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>The hollow and merciless voice of the Dominator of the Samsara Realms resounded, declaring the end of their first mission. The assessments of their performances given and their weaknesses elaborated. Lastly, the voice announced, “The conduct and achievement of this company are duly recognized. The affiliation established. Letters to request or inquire may be deposited to the central column of light. The recipients shall receive them in their next entry to the Samsara Square and write back.”</p><p>“Subsidiary party?”</p><p>“The Young Master has accepted us?”</p><p>Min Renlong and the rest of them blurted out, full of joy and surprise. To them, it was the most critical recognition that their mysterious “Young Master” had acknowledged the growth that they had achieved in the past seven days!</p><p>Wu Xiuxian calmed himself down and sighed with emotion, “It is evident that our mentor possesses immeasurable strength and powers. He must be close to the levels of the Exterior, even if he is not yet. His name must command respect and amazement if he shares the same origin as ours.”</p><p>He was uncertain whether only individuals of his realm came into the Samsara dimensions. None could deny that his conjecture might be true as the city of the Evil-Parting Sword they had returned from not long ago appeared real and natural.</p><p>“With his strength, our mentor is still trapped in the vortex of the Samsara Realms… How hard and horrible their mission would be.” Min Renlong’s pride of apprenticeship in prominent and celebrated sects and guilds had been ebbed distinctly by the rigors and trials of the few days past.</p><p>Her expressions slightly changed, Weng Lingyu had opened her mouth to say something, but she remained silent instead.</p><p>Yuanyang expressed her thanks to her “Young Master”. Awashed with gratitude and consolation, she caressed her the birthmark on her cheek lightly as her eyes fixed upon the central light pillar with unspoken and exuberant bliss.</p><p>…</p><p>With lines of communication established with his new subsidiary, Meng Qi returned to the Samsara Square where a familiar figure stood before him. There stood his sword-wielding companion, Jiang Zhiwei. Clad in a light-green colored dress, she was gazing keenly at the central light pillar.</p><p>“Zhiwei?” In puzzlement, Meng Qi called out to examine her identity.</p><p>Startled, Jiang Zhiwei’s posture stiffened at his sudden call. After she recognized her companion, her shoulders fell loose, and she turned to face Meng Qi. She smiled. “The Ninth Aperture? Impressive. To think that you were not even adept at channeling your Qi when I was close to unsealing my Fourth Aperture. You have improved and caught up with unbelievable speed.”</p><p>There she stood, gentle and fair without even a faint note of her hidden deadliness. But each of her steps was so strong that they seemed to split the air before her like the waters of the lake that were parted before Gao Lan during their first meeting.</p><p>“You seemed to have fared well yourself. The ‘Heaven-Man Connection’ in a mere six months of training. You are nearing the ‘Oneness of Heaven and Man’, I presume.” Meng Qi merrily quipped.</p><p>“I have studied Schools of sword art and cultivated my sword will for several years. Aside from that, I had endured the training of life and death when I played the most powerful sword that could burn myself. If I did not succeed, I would feel great shame for myself.” She raised her head a little and was confident as she showed during their first meeting.</p><p>Meng Qi was about to ask why she stood lost when the light pillar floated. Qi Zhengyan and Ruan Yushu returned.</p><p>“You were leading fresh members as well?” Jiang Zhiwei was the first to speak.</p><p>“I was. The party I led had members who plot and scheme against each other. Much work to be done to build up the trust and companionship between the members,” Qi Zhengyan answered briefly.</p><p>Ruan Yushu’s long hair rippled down her shoulders. Her dark hair accentuated her white arms and clear face which were fair and smooth. Her cool air made her outstanding.</p><p>The Phoenix-Perching Zither she held tightly to her chest while her lips pouted in annoyance. “I have two prospective talents in my party. I have spoken to them privately about the subsidiary team. Still, it all comes down to their party’s collective resolve and efforts to survive.” she said.</p><p>“The party I mentored proved capable. They are worthy of further attention,” said Meng Qi without much comment. He did not say more about Yuanyang and the rest. After all, they were much weaker than his team. It was uncertain whether they would all die in the next mission.</p><p>“My party’s strength was similar to that of Sister Yushu’s.” Jiang Zhiwei smiled.</p><p>Just then, Meng Qi noticed Qi Zhengyan and Ruan Yushu’s breath, especially Qi Zhengyan’s, were conspicuously stronger than before. Plumes of purplish ambiance seemed to follow him like the shimmers of radiance that ringed the glittering stars of the night.</p><p>“Well… It seems that everyone has made good progress,” he grinned. The good tidings of the company always lifted his spirits.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan acknowledged Meng Qi’s observation. “I have managed to unseal my Eighth Aperture. It took me considerable effort, but I finally grasped the elemental level of the ‘Purple Star River.’ Still, I believe I will require some time to fully master the brute strength of the astral force on my fingertips.” He conceded.</p><p>“Myself as well, a few months ago,” permitted Ruan Yushu. Her appearance was well-grown, and a seasoned, cold beauty now replaced her former innocence.</p><p>Without further ado, Meng Qi steered the conversation back into pressing matters. “Everyone, I have with me a Buddhist martial discipline of the Exterior level. It’s called the Vajra Seal. Is anyone interested?”</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei chuckled lightly. After calming down a little, she went on. “I would love to have a look at it if it is the Vajra Swordplay. I will decline your offer if it is the Vajra Seal.”</p><p>“Practice it yourself. There is no need to trouble yourself with our progress,” Ruan Yushu jested. Her tone and demeanor seemed to hint at Meng Qi that the Vajra Seal best matched Meng Qi’s current skill set and former origins as a monk.</p><p>Only Qi Zhengyan maintained indifference. “It conflicts with the disciplines of my Book of Chaos technique.”</p><p>“Yes, that reminds me. Little Monk, tidings disseminated within the Jianghu told of the flight of Gao Lan. His rumored venture down South had shocked the whole Jianghu. Even my teacher was distressed by his presence here and has departed for the Dragon-Subduing Stand. I’d advise that you keep your distance if you encounter him once more,” warned Jiang Zhiwei. She inverted the subject of their discussion to prevent Meng Qi from persisting on the issues of martial techniques.</p><p>Prompted by Jiang Zhiwei’s words, Meng Qi told the companions his the events of his surrealistic expedition with the notorious Dharmakaya prodigy but conveniently omitted the jokes of Gu Xiaosang and his sworn-brotherhood with Gao Lan. He showed them spoils of Sword of the Human Sovereign and seriously asked them, “Do you have any related Weapons-Refining Instructions ?”</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei was the first to react to his tale. Frowning slightly, she spoke, “My teacher had once told me of Gao Lan’s eccentric inclinations. It would be wise to tread with extreme caution before him, for he is subtle and quick to anger. Joyous and warm-hearted he may be at first, but he can swiftly turn cold and ruthless next. Worst case was if he falls into one of his many maniacal outbursts. None would be able to tell what carnage and havoc he might render. The nobles of the North Zhou Dynasty, who are tied closely to the imperial family, had tried to oust the Gao Clan from their ranks and had conspired with aristocratic clans and other prominent martial sects and guilds to incarcerate Gao Lan. Long ago he would have fallen if Senior Master Chong He’s and Master Lu Da’s conflict with Gu Erduo and the Changsheng Denomination had not demanded the attention of the nobles.”</p><p>“Be cautious when you get along with him. Pay attention to your words and avoid stirring his anger.”</p><p><em>“Such tragic pasts that Big Brother has endured…”</em> A cold sweat of fear covered Meng Qi’s entire back. He was thankful that he had practiced prudence during his moments with Gao Lan. A foreboding chill of mortal peril swept through him as he bethought himself of his fate if he had brashly offended Gao Lan despite being sworn-brothers.</p><p>“It seems that Gao Lan has claimed the powers of the Dharmakaya level…” Ruan Yushu’s icy but uncertain voice added.</p><p>In Meng Qi’s accounts, Gao Lan’s powers and strength appeared to have exceeded their conception. Without the concrete proof, Ruan Yushu thence confessed her supposition that one of the two gleaming stars of the former generation had claimed the level of the Dharmakaya.</p><p>Still, there had been no masters of Dharmakaya level in the Ruan Family, so Ruan Yushu could only surmise her theory by accounts of her family’s ancestral archives.</p><p>“My teacher occasionally gave off aura or feeling that would convince me of such powers as well, but only in rare events…” Jiang Zhiwei added, as her voice trailed off, wondering if her teacher had grazed one of the highest pinnacles of the Jianghu. “A great disturbance or upheaval might be afoot if Gao Lan is indeed one of the Dharmakaya levels.”</p><p>“We could at least expect changes to occur in the Celestial Rankings,” said Qi Zhengyan this time, indifferent as he typically was.</p><p>Little could be said more on the matter. The affairs of the Dharmakaya were too tremendous and distant for their concern and interest. Their debate drifted to the subject of the enhancement of Meng Qi’s the “Heaven Inflicted Pain” or the “Flowing Fire”.</p><p>Suddenly, another column of light emerged from the ground. To the surprise of those gathered, an injured Zhao Heng came forth into view.</p><p>He smiled grimly at them. With an apparent disappointment, he revealed to them of his accounts, “The party I led was too reckless and brash. Their ill-advised measures had led to extreme shifts in our objectives. Without being able to intervene directly, I nearly met similar woeful outcomes… Ah… A treasure of the Mortals! The True Emperor Seal!”</p><p>Shock and awe hemmed his final sentence before he had even finished uttering the last syllable. There sat in Meng Qi’s palm a seal that emanated a strong presence of kingly aura.</p><p><em>“Heh, you have the news of the Crown Prince and the Prince of Jin close to your chest, I’d say, my friend…”</em> sniggered Meng Qi to himself. With a clearer insight into the thoughts of Zhao Heng, the fifth prince of the emperor, Meng Qi offered his friend in a silky voice. “I happened to chance upon this trinket lying on the ground during one of my adventures. I see you are interested in it. We can surely come to a price that we can agree on.”</p><p>Zhao Heng’s expression slightly shifted. Flustered, he feigned disinterest. “I have no aspiration to be emperor. Of what use is the Seal to me?”</p><p>“Very well then. To the Dominator it goes!” Meng Qi answered briskly. Swiftly he turned and made towards the central light pillar.</p><p>“Wait, wait!” Zhao Heng called hurriedly, unable to contain himself this time.</p><p>Soft laughter broke at the final word of his sentence that did not entirely end. Jiang Zhiwei was trying her best to stifle her laugh with her hand covering her mouth. Ruan Yushu was developing a sudden interest to her feet, trying intently to stare at them as if holding back on something. Qi Zhengyan turned his head to pretend to look elsewhere, avoiding his gaze.</p><p>Zhao Heng’s eyelids twitched uncontrollably. Mumbling a few hasty “a gift for the Emperor,” he scoffed at his silliness, “Alas, how my heart quivers… I shall hope that my greed would not precipitate my undoing… Su Meng, can you keep the True Emperor Seal for me? I can only muster up adequate Karma points after the end of our next mission.”</p><p>The last mission had cost him a great many items in his inventory. Even the store of his valuables in the main world was but exhausted, thus his plea for Meng Qi to first hold the seal for him.</p><p>“Most definitely, my friend!” Meng Qi turned back to face him with a happy grin.</p><p>The spoils of the trade would be left for Sikong Tu’s family nevertheless. Additionally, the keeping of the weapons of Zhao Heng would allow him temporary use during their next mission.</p><p>Without enough time to exchange his items at the domain of the Immortals, coupled with his immediate need of Karma points, Meng Qi could only curse his ill luck while he agreed to forfeit his ‘Vajra Seal’ to the Dominator of the Six Samsara Realms. For the price of one thousand and fifty Karma points, bringing his total to one thousand one hundred and seventy points.</p><p>The others proceeded to complete their trades with the Dominator before they awaited the assignment of their next task. At length, they left only hundred points as insurance. The bulk of their trades depleted in exchange for the God-Tying Rope – An artifact that cost two thousand and five hundred Karma points. It was a once use item, but it possessed the ability to restrain and subdue anyone below the Third Heaven of the Exterior. The restrained target will have only their physical protection and limited defensive capabilities in not more than 5 seconds.</p><p>Concluding the exchange of the God-Tying Rope, the company returned to their debate of Meng Qi’s enhancement of his weapons. They offered Meng Qi their stores of elixirs and medication should he require items to trade with the Dominator for more points.</p><p>Despite the bare and empty state of his medication inventory, Meng Qi had attained extensive improvements in his protective techniques and his Hard Kung, allowing him to be imperviable against minor and diminutive injuries and heightened powers of restoration. He decided that any immediate need for potions or elixirs can be assuaged by first relying on the charity of his companions and reimbursing them after that, or he could easily procure any medication in the dimension or realm that they would deploy to. He would now enhance his weapon for better offensive capabilities.</p><p>The improvement of his weapon would better serve the needs and purposes of his company in their future missions!</p><p>Meng Qi evaluated these weapons as he mulled over these options. At long last, he came to a decision: he shall enhance the sword: Flowing Fire was stronger than Heaven Inflicted Pain and was much compatible with the spoils of Sword of the Human Sovereign. Then Jiang Zhiwei offered a Weapon-refining Instructions which described that improvement method that used the spoils of different kinds of metals as the primary material and the materials of Fire nature as a compliment.</p><p>The enhancement cost another six hundred Karma points. Meng Qi watched with apprehension as the Flowing Fire burned brightly in the fire within the central column of light. Like a burning sword in the bright-orange embers of a fiery furnace, the sword shone handsomely in the dim luminescence of the pillar.</p><p>Finally, when completed, Meng Qi withdrew the sword from the pillar. He felt the blade of the sword he held in his hand. Strangely, he beheld its fresh endowment as the hollow tone of the Dominator announced the product of his handiwork,</p><p>“The Flowing Fire, with the value of five thousand Karma points, it can be improved to become a precious weapon. Forged by the residual ore of the Sword of the Human Sovereign, Red Dragon scales and other components, it possesses the ability to enhance itself every time it baths itself in the will and the blood of its enemy.”</p><p>“Still, confined to the nature of its ingredients, the Flowing Fire becomes a Superb Precious Weapon at its peak.”</p><p>“The Flowing Fire embodied the most sweltering of flames. It could cut metal like mud and kill those that are evil and foul. In its heaviest wrath, its anger affects even the weather of the lands around it as far as 20 miles. Its fury will blaze through the stratum of the clouds above, and its blaze spreads far and wide across the skies like a fiery inferno. Even warriors of the Exterior would cower before its fierce blaze of glory, vulnerable to perils of its formless, bladed aura. At the bite of its blade, billows of Yin fire shall arise from the ground and consume the enemy that its blade has stung, and the flames of the Beasts of the Samsara shall engulf the enemy from atop while the fires from the furnace of the Dragon Stand shall burst forth from the wound of its bite. Once the three flames converge, the foe of the Flowing Fire shall be nothing but ashes.”</p><p>“It conceals devastating potency within its edges. With the complement of other elements and powers, it can temporarily grasp a fraction of the corresponding effects and perform wonders.”</p><p>The voice of the Dominator faded into silence. Without warning, flames rose up where Meng Qi stood, and engulfed by the fire and vanished in a split second. He emerged from another clump of flames that erupted from the ground not far away from his companions.</p><p>“The Fire Elemental Conveyance ability. It allows the wielder of the Flowing Fire conveyance using the element of Fire to distances below 100 meters. Finitely useful as it is, but a handy ability nonetheless…” Meng Qi happily smiled.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei examined the Flowing Fire with admiration. Words of praises and compliments continued endlessly from her.</p><p>With their preparations completed, the companions awaited the assignment of their task.</p><p>Abruptly, Ruan Yushu said softly, “The Demon-Revealing Mirror, the Demon-Subduing Pagoda, and the God-Tying Rope are powerful and mysterious. They empower a master of enlightening the Apertures level to fight against a master of the Exterior. But there are no similar artifacts in our world…”</p><p>The Ruan Clan commanded various Precious Weapons of their own. The Precious Weapons they possessed had only the abilities to conceal or disperse the breath and the auric emanations of a Precious Weapon, to defend against a single strike of the Exterior level, or other similar properties. None had the incredible potency or capacity akin to that of the God-Tying Rope, the Demon-Revealing Mirror or any other comparable artifacts.</p><p>“It may be the case. Perhaps there are dimensions whose inhabitants are adept in the use and forging such Precious Weapons…” Meng Qi agreed, exhaling slowly.</p><p>Just then, the rumbling voice of the Dominator of Six Samsara Realms echoed around them once more,</p><p>“Long ago in the ancient times, gods and demons still walked the earth and they left behind descendants and heirs of their lineage, as well as supreme and mystical skills and troves of Precious Weapons. The legacy of the supernatural beings laid cause to both chaos and prosperity that have befallen the lands.”</p><p>“Presently, it is none other than the Emperor himself who brought about the own decay of his mandate and majesty while the pride and dignity of the line of kings nearly spent. The duties of his office and his calling lay forgotten as his empire falls by tremendous degrees into ruin and dotage. So flared the beacons of war as the wars of uprising rebellions ravished through the lands.”</p><p>“The new heir to the line of the gods and demons shall come forth and inherit the kingship of the lands!”</p><p>“The main task: Leave for Daning and rescue the head of the Red Coat army, ‘Peacekeeping Heavenly King’ Du Huai Shang. Eliminate the mastermind hidden behind the veils of evil intrigues and foul conspiracies, Zhuo Han Feng, the Jade-Eye Flying Dragon. The reward for the successful completion of the task shall be a thousand Karma points. If the mission is a failure, the cost is a reciprocal amount of Karma points.”</p><p>…</p><p>On the other side of a hill, there stood a cluster of army encampments. A few men in red raiments of battle stood in a bitter debate.</p><p>“Didn’t you burn the talisman which the Dissimilated Men had gave to us, Sixth Brother? Haven’t you asked Masters for help?” asked the leader of the men huddled together. His feet shuffled impatiently.</p><p>A man whose visages resembled that of a monkey replied, implying him as the “Sixth Brother” whom the leader had addressed, “I had just burnt the talisman in hopes of results. But it seems my endeavor is fruitless.” he replied as he heaved a sigh of chagrin.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>A huge crack of thunder tore through the sky as if threatening to tore asunder the skies and heavens above. Countless flashes of lightning streaked from the sky, illuminating the surroundings with the radiance of daylight.</p><p>The thunderbolts entwined together and crackled with deafening protests and sparks. Five figures gradually appeared in the light.</p><p>“The Masters…” With their mouths wide-opened, these men in red surveyed the astonishing spectacle that unfolded before them in puzzlement.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
