They must restrain from their malicious scheming because the aristocratic family mustn’t lose their dignity.</p><p>Cui Zhe continues to smile and seems unknowing of Meng Qi’s intention: “As it should be.”</p><p>After informing Su Li and Su Yue, Meng Qi boards the carriage with Cui Zhe.</p><p>Meng Qi had no sooner taken his seat when a voice spoke, ” I haven’t seen you for more than a year, and you’ve made great progress. Well, you’ve opened my eyes.”</p><p>That familiar cough and elusive tone… A sense of astonishment overcame Meng Qi as he looked towards the corner of the carriage.</p><p>Wang Siyuan?</p><p>Before Meng Qi had come in, with the help of the realm of Oneness of Heaven and Man, he had sensed the inside situation. He couldn’t say that he saw all the details. Though the layout and the breath; except Wang Siyuan, were all clearly presented!</p><p>The carriage was carpeted and covered with brocade. Although it was without too many luxuriant decorations, it was still comfortable and spacious.</p><p>In front of Meng Qi’s left, Wang Siyuan sits up, with his Deliberation Sword ahead of him. He is pretty in thin white clothes just like a feminine beauty. At the same time, he looked very pale and coughs frequently while speaking.</p><p><em>Does he know my actual realm?</em> Meng Qi restrains himself while smiling, ” I never thought that Master Wang also quietly entered Beijing.”</p><p>Wang Siyuan sees Cui Zhe sitting down and spoke with a faint smile, ” Before the New Year I watched the stars at night on an impulse. I saw the Emperor’s Stars swaying. So I felt curious, and went to Luoyang. ”</p><p>After these words a violent coughing fit overcame him.</p><p>There is no maid to pound his back lightly this time. Wang Siyuan coughs for a long time with just a little blood accompanying the cough.</p><p>“Emperor’s Star was swaying …” Meng Qi frowns and repeats. It’s a pity that Wang Siyuan is silent, and he doesn’t say anything more.</p><p>The three of them each lose themselves to their own thoughts. The carriage driving slowly through the outer city and into the inner city. Finally, they arrive at the Mansion in Pinjin where they are to meet the elders mentioned by Cui Zhe.</p><p>A seemingly middle-aged man, with short beards on his chin, a full robe, big sleeves, and a high crown is there. He is elegant in this ancient style, with his hands randomly folding in his sleeves. The most noticeable of his features are his broken eyebrows. As for his strength, Meng Qi couldn’t see the actual realm.</p><p>“Uncle, Ziyuan is coming.” Cui Zhe cups one hand in the other before his chest, allowing Meng Qi to know the identity of that man.</p><p>Childe of the Cui family, the agent of Master, Cui Qingyu!</p><p>He and Cui Qinghe are rare brothers who are both powerful. Being at the peak of the Exterior and the Dharmakaya, making an unprecedented heyday of the Cui family.</p><p>Cui Qingyu smiles kindly and says, ” I took the liberty of inviting you, please don’t blame me. ”</p><p>“How can you say that? If there is anything you can do to help, it is an honor for me. ” Meng Qi follows the action.</p><p>Cui Qingyu nods,” You must be very strange to involve the Saint Emperor’s Token in our Cui family. ”</p><p>Cui Qingyu is outspoken and does not conceal anything. It doesn’t seem to Meng Qi that the Cui family wants to usurp the throne, as had been his speculation.</p><p>“I would like to hear the details. ” Meng Qi spoke primly.</p><p>Cui Qingyu holds out his hands, feeling purple jade hidden, and he rubs his long sword on his knee as he speaks, “My family has always been enemies of the Nine Evil Paths. So some disciples changed their identities and went through hardships to become Cultivator of Luo Denomination. A few months ago, he suddenly contacted Cui family’s nark in the Southern State and told us that Luo Denomination had a big plan. He had stolen key things and requested aid.”</p><p>“Because we are in danger and things are urgent, his message wasn’t elaborate, and our Cui family’s forces in the Southern State is weak, we couldn’t respond in time. When the masters of our family arrived, he had died on the river. ”</p><p>” Later, we found a secret letter from the Chief Arrester of the Escort Agency of Central State. We realized that he was used as bait to draw Luo Denomination off, and sent the key things to Luoyang.”</p><p>Meng Qi gently nods. Considering how he could get involved with the Escort Agency of Central State. However, disciples of Cui family were also alert, they didn’t entrust the Escort Agency of Central State to send directly to Dizhou, Pinjin, but made the escort agency pretend to return to Luoyang. Otherwise, Luo Denomination and Destruction Sect would have discovered the inkling very early.</p><p>Cui Qingyu sighs and continues, “At that time, he was afraid that the Luo Denomination had found some trace of the plan. The escort item had gone through some difficulties, so the Chief Arrester of the Escort Agency of Central State didn’t know what the plan between Luo Denomination and Destruction Sect was. They only knew that it is of great importance and that it’s related to the Cui family. Therefore, he gallantly accepted the task. Because I received the news from the Six Fan School that until last night, the escort item was the half of Saint Emperor’s Token, we were not confused. ”</p><p>“It was because I didn’t know it before, that I was suspicious. Only telling part of the truth, but not all of it. Even asking Wenxian to help follow him. Please don’t laugh at me! ”</p><p>Seeing Cui Qingyu clearly explaining the cause and effect, many doubts that Meng Qi had were released. This matter involved many things.</p><p>“The matter that disciples of the Cui family have to expose their identity must be of great importance; please tell me the details of the fight. ” Cui Qingyu isn’t domineering.</p><p>Meng Qi with nothing to conceal told the truth about the fight.</p><p>Cui Qingyu touches the short beard under his chin and listens very carefully. In the end, he says, “There are not many people who can use the Saint Emperor’s Token. There may be companions in the Six Fan School …”</p><p><em>So keen…</em> Meng Qi held admiration.</p><p>With only a few words, Cui Qingyu went to arrange the matter and saw the guests off.</p><p>Wang Siyuan stays in the Cui Mansion, and Cui Zhe personally went to send Meng Qi back.</p><p>The carriage drove slowly along the long street. Cui Zhe chatted with Meng Qi about traveling experiences, experiences in Kung Fu, and the customs of the Luoyang.</p><p>Cui Zhe was talking and pointing to a century-old cake shop when Meng Qi spotted someone out of the corner of his eye. A plain face and an unspiced robe in black belonging to Qi Zhengyan.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan walked cautiously, hiding behind bypassers from time to time. It seemed as if he was following someone.</p><p>Yet, Zhengyan immediately stops and frowns as if he has lost that person.</p><p>Due to his curiosity, Meng Qi cups one hand in the other before his chest and says to Cui Zhe, “Please don’t bother to send me off. I see an old friend and wish to speak with him.”</p><p>Cui Zhe graciously replied, “We will meet at the Sumptuous Fruits Banquet, see you next time. ”</p><p>Cui Zhe eyes held a sneaking desire to fight. He dares not to challenge Meng Qi since Meng Qi killed the Wolf King.</p><p>“Okay!” Meng Qi jumps out of the carriage and moves towards Qi Zhengyan.</p><p>Meng Qi intended to prank with the intention to frighten Qi Zhengyan by patting his shoulder. Unfortunately, Qi Zhengyan noticed Meng Qi when he was just a few steps away.</p><p><em>He has such a keen sense because his Book of the Chaos has reached to the stage of Heaven-man Connection.</em> Meng Qi was surprised and smiled as he asked, “Senior Brother Qi, how can you have the leisure to go shopping? ”</p><p>From Ruan Yushu, Meng Qi knows that Zhao Heng has utilized the secret connection with the Gongsun family to help Qi Zhengyan sneak into the Sumptuous Fruits Banquet.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan’s eyebrows don’t stretch as he spoke, “Walk and talk. ”</p><p>Meng Qi understands the unsaid intention and invites him to a nearby restaurant.</p><p>After entering the restaurant, all eyes focus on Meng Qi due to his signature long saber, good looks, and manly temperament. All of which reveal his identity!</p><p>“Killing Blade!”</p><p>“Is he the number one of the Ranking List of Young Masters?”</p><p>“It’s the Killing Blade that killed the Wolf King!”</p><p>The exclamations continue. Some people even get up to say hello to Meng Qi as he passes by. These actions satisfy Meng Qi’s vanity as he pretends to be demure. Nodding to those that do so.</p><p>The pair move to the second floor where Meng Qi and Qi Zhengyan order a VIP room.</p><p>“I went to Gongsun’s banquet before and came back to meet a man by chance.” Even with both of them examining the surroundings they still project their will to prevent snooping and Qi Zhengyan still sends his words with Secret Voice-sending.</p><p>“Who?” Meng Qi knows that Qi Zhengyan has never been one for joking. There must be enough reason for him to pay such attention to this man.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan muses, “When I was traveling in the Jianghu, I also had some adventures. That time I met the Blessing-endowed Heavenly Official of the Myths. In the fierce fight, I slightly spied a little ‘strength’ under his cover. I just met someone who made me feel a familiar sensation, and I suspected that he was the Blessing-endowed Heavenly Official. ”</p><p>Meng Qi has known that the Myth frequent here, but how rare was the opportunity to lock in on a member?</p><p>But he says solemnly asks “Lost? What are his physical characteristics?”</p><p>“More than one year ago he was a senior who reached the Half-step Exterior Scenery. Now I think he must be near to the level of the exterior. So he was likely aware of the inkling and disappeared by the crossroads. ” Qi Zhengyan describes what has just happened, “He is more than 30 years old, with a plain face, short and fat, and a mole under his right eyebrow. ”</p><p>Meng Qi gently nods,”I will ask someone to help me. You can also make brother Zhao secretly seek. ”</p><p>Now the Six Fan School may have members of the Myths, so Meng Qi only plans to find the help of Yuan Lihuo, the “Blood Teeth Arrester”, who is Primogenitor Guangcheng.</p><p>The pair chat for a while then leave from the VIP room. Before they head downstairs, they run into a man who is handsome and stable, with a strongly defined chin and silver bands hanging around his waist. Before them was Fan Changmiao, the Number One Scholar of Kung Fu in the last year!</p><p>Meng Qi had briefly met him once, so he says with a slight smile, “What a coincidence! ”</p><p>He doesn’t know the rumors of Luoyang. It didn’t mean anything, just purely joking around. However, the people around him have recognized his identity from his appearance before and they all laugh.</p><p>“Killing Blade.” Called Fan Changmiao, the Number One Scholar of Kung Fu. <em>Isn’t this naked humiliation?</em></p><p>Those around them suddenly get excited, hoping to watch a battle between the members in Ranking List of Young Masters!</p><p>Fan Changmiao speaks quietly, “I have an appointment with someone here.”</p><p>Fan Changmiao’s cultivation method doesn’t seem to have a low level. Meng Qi can’t see his actual realm through his realm of Oneness of Heaven and Men, and can only roughly judge that he has reached to the level of the Heaven-Man Connection. Leaving Meng Qi has no contempt for him.</p><p>Meng Qi was ready to exchange a few words with him when a man walks out of the other VIP room and speaks, “Changmiao, here.”</p><p>The new man is tall and powerful, but his temperament is calm and steady. Even with a beard covering his whole face, he offers no reckless feelings. As for his strength, Meng Qi can’t see his depth, but he can tell he is definitely at the level of the Exterior.</p><p>Fan Changmiao smiles and makes the introductions, “This is my Uncle, the master of Gu family in Ning State. ”</p><p>Although he has never left Zhong State, his elders always have developed relationships in other places.</p><p>Since they are not familiar with each other, Meng Qi greets him and gets ready to leave. At this moment Fan Changmiao says quietly, “On the Sumptuous Fruits Banquet, Young Master Su, please give me some advice. ”</p><p>There are excited cries all around; they are going to see some fun, Sumptuous Fruits Banquet is worth looking forward to!</p><p>Although he deems that Fan Changmiao is not a reckless man, Meng Qi is still confident and laughs, ” I am willing to hold my promise but dare not invite you.”</p><p>A few days later, Progenitor Doumu has healed up and quietly left. Primogenitor Guangcheng secretly searches for Gu Xiaosang and the Blessing-endowed Heavenly Official. Meanwhile, Meng Qi focuses on self-cultivation, waiting for the Sumptuous Fruits Banquet.</p><p>August arrives before we know it and the Sumptuous Fruits Banquet begins.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
