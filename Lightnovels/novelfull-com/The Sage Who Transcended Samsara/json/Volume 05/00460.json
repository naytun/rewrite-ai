He carried only the Refined Weapon that he had used after reaching a certain level on which he gained the sword power without using the real sword, and set off to scale Sunset Peak. A dim sword light shone as he lifted the sword!</p><p>The sword, forged from a precious stone, was three feet, three inches, and three decimeters long. It glowed dazzlingly under the direct sunlight.</p><p>He thrust his sword forward in an ordinary fashion and the sword light broke into fragments, like stones hitting a peaceful lake, or sparkling stars forming a chessboard of the night sky.</p><p>Each fragment of sword light was mixed with Sword Qi which was harmful and could damage one’s eyesight. It was hard to distinguish whether it was genuine, but one sword formed the big picture!</p><p>The realm of Oneness of Heaven and Men was equal to the primary level of connecting with heaven. In that realm sword power could be formed out of the power of heaven and earth. Therefore, Sword Emperor could utilize the sword art described in the 40-word Holy Sword Puppet using only one sword. What made it inferior to the realm of connecting with heaven was its relatively few changes and tricks.</p><p>Even so, this sword had transcended the human level. This shocked and amazed Zhangsun Jing, Wishful Monk, Sky-scaling Sword Song Ming and the rest.</p><p>When Meng Qi opened his eyes, he saw his long sword hidden in sparkles of light.</p><p>Before any thought even crossed his mind, his Flowing Fire was already spurting like a red sunset stretching across the sky. It flew to an inconspicuous spot in the sky without competing with the shining stars or making itself a part of the big picture.</p><p>The sword hit the air and the light dispersed. The momentum of the chess game disappeared in a moment.</p><p>That so-called momentum was a symptom of the Inner World mobilizing the power of the External World. It had its own running law of movements and skills.</p><p>And a Momentum-destroying Sword could, naturally, destroy momentum!</p><p>The sparkles of stars and chessboard disappeared at the same time, while Sword Emperor’s sword quickened its pace like a viper snaking out of its cave as it sped throughout the sky. It seemed that its former changes were just attempts to lure Meng Qi to break his momentum and create an opportunity to split the air and speed up its attack!</p><p>Meng Qi’s Flowing Fire moved in a beautiful circle and caught Sword Emperor’s sword perfectly.</p><p>They seemed to have discussed their moves beforehand because their movements, attacks, and defense were so in tune. It was as if they had known each other’s next moves.</p><p>The sword power developed as their figures jumped up and down. Sometimes a tinkling or jingle was heard. Sometimes they fought in complete silence without even the sound of their swords colliding.</p><p>Devil Empress carefully watched their battle. In the eyes of a Great Grandmaster, their movements weren’t strange. God-petrifying Sword lived up to his reputation indeed as he was strong enough to challenge Sword Emperor. His movements were inexplicably delicate—sometimes they were as violent as Asura, sometimes as illusionary as an intangible smell; sometimes emitting melodious sounds, and sometimes as fast as frightened birds. He had the speed, strength, and violence of his attacks well under control, perfectly suiting the timing.</p><p>Sword Emperor was only faring slightly better, having reached the consummate realm. Though he was old, his attacks were strong. Each sword seemed plain but brought about optimal effects. Each of his attacks was at an advantage and, as he was the first to attack, his swords were like mesh that gradually became tighter and tighter.</p><p>In Devil Empress’s view, even if he was in the same realm as Sword Emperor, another person would’ve been forced into the traps that Sword Emperor had set, only able to risk his life in a most unfavorable situation. God-petrifying Sword was different from them. He was young, powerful and fast. He had evaded Sword Emperor’s traps every time. Although there were still some sparkles of Sword Qi in the air, it was hard for them to merge and form a stalemate to defeat Meng Qi. Furthermore, during this time the flaming precious sword hadn’t even unleash its peak power yet.</p><p>It resembled a scene in which Sword Emperor tightened its strings while God-petrifying Sword smashed his attempts, again and again. Their movements and changes were quick and dazzling as victory hung in the balance. Both their momentum gradually climbed to the peak as they exerted all of their strength and formed their connections with heaven and earth.</p><p>Sunset Peak, which had been under direct sunlight, was originally a brilliant yellow, but darkness gradually swallowed it. When everything was so dim, they could see even more clearly!</p><p>Only Devil Empress, Royal Advisor, Right Chief Minister, and the other Great Grandmasters could understand their movements. Others like Zhangsun Jing were only drawn to their attacks, unable to distinguish who would be the winner. Each of their sword art and defense amazed and gave the impression of being more brilliant, unmatched moves. They were spellbound and felt that they had learned a lot.</p><p>Suddenly, their gazes froze as an unprecedented wonderful scene appeared!</p><p>Sunset Peak, which had been bathed in the sunset, was gradually surrounded by a layer of dark fog. In the darkness, a hazy Grand Sun rose and shining stars appeared. They were so deep and far that they couldn’t be seen clearly. They ran and changed in accordance with the mysterious law. They gave off the feeling of an entanglement that became increasingly heavy, as if they had originated from an indescribable abyss.</p><p>It was different from the sky they had seen before!</p><p>It was an unparalleled wonder!</p><p>In the dark fog, a hazy rainbow was hanging in the sky. It changed continuously and glowed brightly as it attempted to break through the fog.</p><p>As the Grand Sun rotated and Flowing Fire shone, Meng Qi stabbed Sword Emperor with great strength.</p><p>Aside from his own genuine Qi, realm and sword art, he hadn’t use any weapon or object that didn’t belong to this world. He consolidated his strength to advance toward the Oneness of Heaven and Men realm.</p><p>Of course, except for skills in concealing and protecting, he couldn’t exert other martial arts because he wasn’t given any chances to do so. If he attacked rashly, Sword Emperor could easily dodge his attacks. In that case, Sword Emperor could find his flaws and he would be doomed!</p><p>In other words, except for these changes, Meng Qi had tried his best. So it didn’t matter whether he used a sword or blade.</p><p>The sword was as grand as the sun. Sword Emperor trapped the powerful force with his sword tip and led it to the other side.</p><p>He suddenly tilted his sword tip in a wonderful way, making the sword like a flying bird that was rid of its cage. Its movement contained a certain law of the universe as his sword freed itself from Meng Qi’s Flowing Fire.</p><p>This change was unpredictable, resulting in Meng Qi failing to stop it in time!</p><p>This sword fully demonstrated the strength of Sword Emperor. Devil Empress, Royal Advisor, and the rest were gently nodding, impressed.</p><p>Then, the surrounding Vital Qi surged and penetrated Sword Emperor’s body. Together with the long sword, it transformed into a sun-penetrating rainbow!</p><p>The consummate stage of Oneness of Heaven and Men enabled the masters to absorb the Vital Qi of the universe and make some use of its strength.</p><p>The rainbow hung over the sky and penetrated the sun. Untouchable, it rushed to Meng Qi.</p><p>Sword Emperor changed his movements, created a transitory opportunity, and used the same killing skill that had defeated the Living Buddha just before!</p><p>It also had a similar air to Sword Emperor. It seemed to be close, but distant at the same time. It was hard to measure its distance away from Meng Qi. Only the bright sword light indicated its sharpness.</p><p>Seeing the sword in the distance and the rainbow across the sky, Zhangsun Jing and the rest couldn’t help but worry.</p><p>Meng Qi lost one half of the movement but sighed inwardly when he saw Sword Emperor’s current attack. If Wang Siyuan and the rest were here, he wouldn’t have defended with such a move.</p><p>In this world, he was at a terrible disadvantage, both in speed and reaction. While the chance of a successful defense was high, a false step could lead him to complete failure.</p><p>But there were still moves of the Exterior in this world. The reason Wang Siyuan and others didn’t link their moves in this way, was it was a chance for Meng Qi to counterattack!</p><p>But he had to react like this. If he was forced into an utterly unfavorable position, he wouldn’t be able to find another chance again!</p><p>“This…” It was the first time that Devil Empress had spoken since she started watching the battle.</p><p>Royal Advisor and Right Chief Minister couldn’t help but step forward.</p><p>Zhangsun Jing and the rest were all stunned. In the dark mist, shining stars chained together and transformed into a wonderful flying light. No change was better than any change!</p><p>Nine stars linked together and transformed into Heavenly Fairy!</p><p>It won by its will and speed. It was launched late but arrived first, shining with a bright light to counterattack directly!</p><p>Its magical relation with heaven and earth, as well as its sword will that stunned one’s Vital Spirit, gave Devil Empress and the rest the impression that they’d seen another world, another vast world!</p><p>“The sword art is so wonderful!”</p><p>“To think he’d have such a magnificent sword art!”</p><p>Sword Emperor was shocked by such beautiful sword light. It then gave way to joy, as he was happy he had seen such sword art before dying. After seeing a sword like that, he did not even fear death.</p><p>He closed his eyes as if he was enjoying the wonderful sword movement. His strength was triggered by his Qi and some changes took place within the sword in his hand.</p><p>The rainbow which penetrated the sun suddenly swirled and its airflow was turbulent, creating a horrible vortex. The power of the whole universe seemed to be absorbed. In the dark mist, the rainbow transformed into a circle.</p><p>“Clank!”</p><p>The Heavenly Fairy was slightly kicked off by the vortex and only hit the sword ridge!</p><p>At that moment, with the guidance of Qi and Dharma and Logos, Sword Emperor used a new sword art equal to a move of the Exterior!</p><p>The profound accumulation and strong spirit realm enabled Sword Emperor to create a miracle!</p><p>Although the sword was not so smoothly wielded, its strength was stronger than the attacks of Devil Empress and the rest. Devil Empress’s eyes showed her mixed feelings, apparent on her face.</p><p>Meng Qi wasn’t surprised but pleased with the fact that Sword Emperor had such great strength. He jerked his long sword up and brought it down violently.</p><p>This split was like a dragon putting out its claws, harboring inexplicable strength. It was the Exterior move Nine Dragons Stretching Heads of the Dragon Sword from the Eight Heavenly Sections. It was something that Meng Qi had created!</p><p>It concentrated all of his strength and attacked Sword Emperor with a terrifying force, making him look like a real dragon.</p><p>Sword Emperor’s eyes were still half-open as he moved his long sword according to the changing attacks. The rainbow in the dark mist was clearly seen as it crossed over the peak and linked to the ground on both sides.</p><p>“Clank!”</p><p>Sword Emperor remained motionless!</p><p>It was a diamond-cutting-diamond situation. Meng Qi used his Exterior move again and Sword Emperor changed his moves as well. Their momentums increased to an unprecedented level. In the dark mist, the Grand Sun, stars, Chaotic Hole and rainbow became more violent, thrilling Zhangsun Jing and the rest and stopping their breaths.</p><p>When the spirit was about to be used up and before Meng Qi thought of another method, another sword was launched. It was the most fluent and proper sword.</p><p>The sword attacked before the other was drawn. The sword light was as beautiful as a large threatened bird, filling the view of Zhangsun Jing and the rest.</p><p>Sword Emperor suddenly switched to offense!</p><p>The sword seemed to give its salute to the sky. It wasn’t a pity to die after seeing such a sword art!</p><p>“Clank!” Two sword lights collided. Their tips hit each other exactly!</p><p>Meng Qi saw how full of joy Sword Emperor’s eyes were. His own, reflected in the latter’s eyes, were also filled with delight.</p><p>They both exerted their full strength. The strong sword Qi sizzled when the tips of the two swords hit each other. A deep, dark black spot appeared and quickly expanded.</p><p>A bright light lashed out from the fissure, covering them like lightning rushing to the sky from the ground.</p><p>Devil Empress, Zhangsun Jing, and the others only saw a white light emerging from a deep corner of the dark mist. It made the peak look like a mysterious, fantastic place.</p><p>In the flowing light, they saw God-petrifying Sword Little Meng and Sword Emperor.</p><p>It was also their last appearance.</p><p>Sword Emperor’s flesh fell apart and his soul was like an entity. In his hands, a strange black monster was smashed.</p><p>God-petrifying Sword had his long sword pointed at an angle. His scattered hair was dancing in the wind. His expression revealed a hint of delight along with his typical aloofness.</p><p>The sword entered the capital. It was Heavenly Fairy!</p><p>The light suddenly lit up but immediately disappeared. No one could be seen on the peak.</p><p>…</p><p>Through the slit, he could see that Sword Emperor’s transparent figure was gradually changing from an old body to a young one. His black hair hung loosely.</p><p>He vaguely felt himself appearing in a stone room. A man in green sat with his legs crossed opposite him. He looked detached and seemed to be here but far away at the same time.</p><p>“He looks like me when I was younger…” Sword Emperor was shocked. Many strange memories crossed his mind and his eyes gradually became clear.</p><p>The man in green opened his eyes, which were powerful enough to kill everything.</p><p>“Do you understand now?” he said coldly.</p><p>“I do.” Sword Emperor laughed. He then transformed into a puff of Sword Qi and flew into the middle of the man in green’s eyebrows.</p><p>The man in green closed his eyes again. His figure was so dim that he seemed to be far away.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
