Due to the prohibitions presented by the dreamland formation, he was not able to detect Ruan Yushu who was standing behind the hill.</p><p>His Vital Spirit trembled and vision became vague and hazy. He could only feel his surroundings shift in and out in a dream-like state. It was as if there were hundreds of birds chirping and crying next to his ear, steadily intoxicating him.</p><p>He, however, was a Top Class Master Pro of the Third Heaven of the Exterior realm after all. No matter how divine Heavenly Phoenix Cries was, there was no way his opponent was able to stop him without being of a similar realm!</p><p>Purple bolts of thunder twirled around him, sizzling and crackling as they drew support from his Qi pivot. He stared through the hill and spotted Ruan Yushu.</p><p>The eyes that peeked through the mask were filled with purple thunder. They brimmed with a ferocious desire to ruin and destroy.</p><p>While locked in his battle with Six-annihilation Devilman, Meng Qi suddenly heard the sound of the Phoenix-perching Zither drifting from afar.</p><p>Though the melodious sound lost some of its magic due to the distance, both of them recognized it for what it was.</p><p><em>“Heavenly Phoenix Cries! The little piggy has met a powerful enemy somewhere nearby! Very likely it’s an enemy like Six-annihilation Devilman who wants to kill us!”</em> Various thoughts crossed his mind as he felt a jolt in his chest.</p><p>The key to surviving life-and-death situations is never hesitate. The thoughts that swamped his mind instantly gave way to a firm decision. He brandished his saber and slashed it countless times through the void. Purple lightning flew out of his saber to form a thunder dragon. With a mad and ferocious momentum, the saber cut at Six-annihilation Devilman.</p><p>Simultaneously, Meng Qi took large steps forward along with his sword. It was as if he was trying to injure his opponent to gain a survival chance and conjure an opportunity out of a non-opportunity!</p><p>Instead of being surprised, Six-annihilation Devilman felt delighted. Killing Blade had, in a fit of chaos, made the poorest choice possible. Considering how much battle experience he had, how could he not know that he was giving Six-annihilation Devilman an opportunity instead?</p><p>Furthermore, who in this world did not know he had an incomparably tough protection skill?</p><p>This was truly an exemplary case of someone who had become caught up in his confusion!</p><p>The saber fell, taking in all the living desire in the surrounding airflow. Heaven and earth seemed to collapse from the vacuum caused. It charged violently and ferociously at Six-annihilation Devilman’s head. Its trajectory and destination aimed precisely at the Devilman’s weak spot.</p><p>Unfortunately, he had terrible timing! The Devilman narrowed his eyes and his footwork became furtive. Like a dark shadow, he traveled through the layers of water screens and instantly rid himself of the locked-on targeting of Meng Qi’s saber. He slid next to Meng Qi and slammed his right palm on the latter’s Ear Aperture, targeting his weak point!</p><p>This attack was simple without any adornments, carrying only a shattering force. His palm was entirely black, like nightfall.</p><p>“Thud!”</p><p>A series of noiseless explosions followed the palm attack. Meng Qi felt only turbulent waves on his vast sea of Vital Qi. It was shattered open, inch by inch.</p><p>He thrust his Flowing Fire in his left hand, feeling his muscles knotting underneath his skin. His sword weighed down on him as if carrying the power of nine dragons.</p><p>The sword crashed into the palm, causing a muffled ringing sound. Meng Qi’s power of nine dragons instantly disappeared without a trace. The faint golden glow began to sway as blood seeped out of the corner of his eyes. Around him, the vast sea of Vital Qi had collapsed entirely, unable to supply him with any more strength!</p><p>Once heaven was annihilated, next would be earth! Without giving Meng Qi a chance, Six-annihilation Devilman launched another attack from above. This time, he targeted Meng Qi’s Primal Aperture Between the Eyebrows with a pitch-black palm full of destructive intent!</p><p>Meng Qi’s eyes were brimming with the desire to fight. With a turn of his hand, he wielded his saber like a sword. Flowing Fire set fire to the sky as lightning entwined with it. It was much like a Thunder Yaksha.</p><p>…</p><p>Zhao Heng struggled bitterly to put up a fight against Aunt Bai and Yan Chong who had teamed up. Just as he felt as if he had reached a dead end, he suddenly felt the pressure that had been weighing on him lighten.</p><p>He stared dumbfounded at Aunt Bai and Yan Chong, who had abruptly stopped their attacks midway. For a while, he could not snap out of his shock.</p><p>Aunt Bai smiled awkwardly at him while Yan Chong said solemnly, “There’s an unforeseeable event happening outside. The formation has gone out of control and our lives are in danger. They’ve already found us and we’re about to leave at any time. Prince Wei, please leave as soon as possible.”</p><p>The breath that latched onto Aunt Bai belonged to her family elder while Yan Chong’s belonged to a certain aristocratic family who was close to Prince Jin. Yan Chong’s voice had barely faded when the two of them gradually disappeared as if they were entering the water surface.</p><p>“Even they have been found, while I…” Zhao Heng was stunned. He wondered what unforeseen event had happened outside. As a prince, he was the prime object of protection. Sima Shi had personally attached his breath on him. And yet Peerless Pro Masters had found their disciples while he was left behind, without anyone taking notice of him!</p><p>Just then, he heard the tunes of the Phoenix-perching Zither and his expression shifted as if he had understood something. <em>“So the most crucial moment for the main task of my mission is here…”</em></p><p>Just the two subjects up ahead alone would reward them with more than 1,500 Karma points each!</p><p>He followed after the sound of the zither, taking large strides as he ran towards it.</p><p>Red clouds chased after the lonesome duck; white clouds enveloped the city walls; bluish green snow formed pear trees; the river of stars rested with the Nine Heavens. Qi Zhengyan and the monk skilled with seals were locked in a tough battle. Their surroundings turned all shades of colors, appearing as splendid as an illusion.</p><p>With a slash of a sword, the Milky Way descended and washed away the purple. The monk bore his seals in his hands, appearing as if they were precious vases. Its strength and Qi were flourishing, extending all over like water.</p><p>“Thump!”</p><p>The two forces collided in mid-air, causing an explosion of stars that floated down gently.</p><p>The two of them both retreated, taking one step backward. Just as they were about to strike again, they stopped in their tracks.</p><p>“There’s an unforeseen event happening outside…” the monk said, frowning.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan nodded expressionlessly, looking around to detect any changes.</p><p>The masters who had attached their breaths on them had finally found them.</p><p>The monk’s figure began to sway and later disappeared.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan, however, heard the sound of the Phoenix-perching Zither as well as the muffled growl of thunder.</p><p>He frowned and a golden vertical eye blossomed between his brows. A river of stars entwined with his body and cut off the breath attached to him. He headed in the direction of the sounds.</p><p>…</p><p>The Grand Sun was blazing on the horizon, turning life and death upside down. The Noble Purple Spirit stood firm without desire… The Exterior masters unleashed their techniques to strike the heart of the formation one after another. On the other side, Sima Shi threw an ordinary, unassuming punch. It combined with the formation to turn into the primal chaos, swallowing everything in its path.</p><p>In the beginning, the formation did not waver in the slightest. However, after the talents gradually left the formation, and more masters began to join the fight, layers of ripples began to become visible all around them. Sima Shi’s momentum continued to rise as he continued to give his all.</p><p>The aged Emperor was not bothered by all these in the least. He was staring in the direction of the palace, watching the clouds that seemed to signal the coming of doomsday, and the dragons that materialized out of the power of living beings snaking downwards.</p><p>Rays of golden yellow light emerged from the palace and spread in all directions like waves on the sea. The light became increasingly bright and fast.</p><p>Zhao Wuyan’s Sign of the Emperor had completely fused with him. It was only between his eyebrows that there was still the difference between him and regular people.</p><p>Feeling the intensity of the golden yellow light, the corners of the aged Emperor’s mouth tugged into a smile. He felt both gratified and regretful.</p><p>…</p><p>The purple bolts of lightning danced in a chaotic mess in the sky, its sizzling sounds reverberating in the air. Having rid himself from the influence of the Phoenix-perching Zither, Thunder God from the Ninth Heaven glanced at Ruan Yushu, and then at the faraway Meng Qi. After some consideration, he quickened his pace as if he was trying to cross over the hill directly!</p><p>“Clang!” Ruan Yushu played her zither once again to confuse the Nine Heavens and cause Thunder God’s Vital Spirit to tremble, all in an effort to make it difficult for him to move forward.</p><p>The purple thunder in his eyes was gleaming as bright as ever. He thrust his saber three inches forward, shooting lightning from the tip. He appeared infuriated.</p><p><em>“I gave you face but you spat on it! I allowed you to live and yet you seek death!”</em></p><p>The thunder saber cried as deep growling thunder resounded overhead, shattering the tunes of the Phoenix-perching Zither.</p><p>Ruan Yushu’s expression was cold, no emotion reflected in her eyes. He could not see any indication of her retreating. Blood sprayed out of her mouth, dying her zither red. Her momentum, however, abruptly recovered and returned to its peak condition.</p><p>This time, she strummed the strings with her left hand while using her right hand to gently caress the zither. It was no longer the sole sound of a phoenix and dragon’s cry – it was a series of tunes.</p><p>Each musical note was like a sword or saber, splitting open the earth. The hand that Thunder God was about to lift felt as if it was being bound and flung sideways as if it was being strung along.</p><p>He felt a temporary loss of control over his limbs, torso, and Vital Spirit like he was a puppet. Inexplicable traces of blood emerged on his skin, alarming and angering him at the same time.</p><p><em>“Sky-splitting and Earth-changing Tune! So, she can actually play the first verse of the Sky-splitting and Earth-changing Tune!”</em></p><p>“Argh!” Thunder God cried out at the sky and an illusory copper-skinned giant with thunder marks all over its body appeared behind him. Like him, the giant was wielding the thunder saber in hand and had lightning entwining it.</p><p>The rumbling of thunder echoed amid the playing of the zither. Purple thunder burst forth, completely burying the sky-splitting tunes.</p><p>“Go to hell!” Thunder God’s eyes were grim and cold, concealing his rage, as he slashed at Ruan Yushu with his saber. Spring thunder exploded with a loud noise and electric lightning and saber Qi crossed the vast sky, carrying with it a terrifying explosive power.</p><p>Just as the lightning was about to strike Ruan Yushu, a dense magical Qi rose from her body and she disappeared alongside the purple thunder.</p><p>Thunder God was about to attack again when he saw Zhao Heng dashing over, accompanied with sword light. The light, as if moving in accordance with a heavenly order, dominated heaven and earth and transformed the thunder into water.</p><p>…</p><p>With the palm extinguishing his force, Meng Qi felt the nature of heaven and earth in him collapse in its entirety before his saber even came into contact with the devilish palm. The illusion of wasteland shattered, and so did the heaven, river, and boulders!</p><p>They had merely suffered injuries in reality but in the world in Meng Qi’s mind, they were all gradually shattering and turning into lumps of primal chaos.</p><p>“Clank!” His saber struck straight at the hollow of the palm. It felt as if he had hit metal instead. The energy, Qi, and Thunder Light disappeared instantly.</p><p>There was no way Six-annihilation Devilman would give Meng Qi any room to catch his breath. He pushed his palm ordinarily, and the blackened hollow of his palm turned into a whirlpool – it was full of the intent to swallow and destroy!</p><p>Meng Qi responded in a great rush, thrusting his sword to meet the attack. His Flowing Fire burst with lightning as if it was throwing a lance of scarlet light.</p><p>“Bang!”</p><p>It was the first time since they had begun exchanging blows that the collision of their strength and Qi produced such a terrifying sound. Flames were sent flying in all directions and fell into the vortex. Meng Qi felt his spiritual side trembling and Vital Spirit swaying. His senses of the nature of heaven and earth were diminished by half and he lost the ability to maintain his Oneness of Heaven and Men. Genuine Qi flowed in disarray, injuring his internal organs.</p><p>This palm attack was vicious enough to snuff out gods!</p><p>Six-annihilation Devilman’s heart jumped with joy when he saw how blood trailed from the corner of Killing Blade’s mouth, how his senses of his realms were diminished, and how his attacks were drastically reduced in effectiveness. A cruel desire to murder appeared in the Devilman’s expression as he launched his ordinary left palm in attack.</p><p>The shattered primal chaos around Meng Qi thundered in response to the momentum of the palm. It transformed into a series of forces that attacked him from all directions. He was not given any chance to evade the attack at all!</p><p>Once heaven was annihilated, the earth was next, and finally the living!</p><p><em>“Killing Blade, you’re dead!”</em> Six-annihilation Devilman sent another palm flying at Meng Qi, feeling victory firmly within grasp.</p><p>It was at this moment that he saw the urge to smile on Killing Blade’s face when the latter had been a sitting target this whole time. Killing Blade allowed the momentum of the palm to land on him, striking the dark golden glow on his skin and coming close to the middle of his eyebrows.</p><p>Amid the banging sounds, Six-annihilation Devilman felt that there were bright stars appearing in the hollow of his palm. The stars were burning hot. With a shock, he realized they had materialized out of the Grand Sun, and blocked the power of his palm!</p><p>Stars soared, one by one, all around him. Lumps of the ground flew up; the Chaotic Hole emerged; the Golden Crow flew in confusion.</p><p><em>“This… This is the breath of the Exterior!”</em> Six-annihilation Devilman’s pupils shrunk drastically, dumbfounded.</p><p>Meng Qi’s eyes were burning with the desire to fight as he raised his saber once again.</p><p><em>“Wouldn’t I know that rushing to use killer strikes first was a death sentence?”</em></p><p><em>“Wouldn’t I know that my protection skills are known publicly?”</em></p><p><em>“What I wanted was precisely to be at a disadvantageous position!”</em></p><p><em>“What I needed was this space here, right between life and death!”</em></p><p><em>“What I wanted was for you to use all your strength and your Qi pivot to create a surge in your momentum!”</em></p><p>Meng Qi was burning hot between the eyebrows. Stars flew all around and lumps of earth fell to the ground. The Chaotic Hole and Golden Crow both returned to his body.</p><p>Six-annihilation Devilman could feel his surroundings becoming dark and indistinct. With some surprise, he realized the existence of a primal chaos that his very own Six-annihilation Palms could have caused.</p><p><em>“This is bad!”</em> He was just about to dodge when he saw the primal chaos split open, unleashing a dazzling saber radiance that cleaved the darkness and shattered. Yin and Yang split apart as the Golden Crow rose and stars soared!</p><p>The shattered primal chaos was cleaved open.</p><p>So was the power in his palms.</p><p>And also, the series of resistance that he had put up.</p><p>The bleakness disappeared, revealing a saber mark down the middle of Six-annihilation Devilman’s eyebrows that stretched all the way to his pubic region!</p><p>…</p><p>The golden yellow rays of light revolved and rushed forth, assimilating into Zhao Wuyuan’s body.</p><p>The aged Emperor felt somewhat agitated seeing the light return. He could not help rising from his seat.</p><p>Just then, he seemed to have detected something and turned to look sideways.</p><p>He saw a person who had appeared from out of nowhere standing in an empty section of the formation. The person was tall and lofty. He was dressed in the Emperor’s robe with his head adorned with the heavenly crown. A mask was fastened over his face.</p><p>The mask of the ancient Heaven Sovereign!</p><p>It was Heaven Sovereign of the Myths!</p><p>It was the enigmatic, mysterious Heaven Sovereign!</p><p>The person took a relaxed step. The saber radiance in his hand rose as he slashed at the aged Emperor. Everything lost its splendor, leaving behind only a black-and-white world.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
