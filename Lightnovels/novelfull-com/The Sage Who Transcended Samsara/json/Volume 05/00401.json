He Jiu seemed to be proud and confident, but he had never been known as a madman. He would never anything that was beyond his strength.</p><p>Even if they excluded Wang Siyuan and Jiang Zhiwei, at least four or five masters listed in the Ranking List of Young Masters would be at the Party of Happycloud. After all, Meng Qi and Yan Chong would definitely go there. If He Jiu challenged Meng Qi and the other as Aunt Bai had, he would encounter the killing movements of the Exterior level from all directions. He would be defeated within a few breaths.</p><p>Of course, if he took advantage of it and made a breakthrough, it would be another thing. Winning or losing was not important to him in that situation.</p><p>Meng Qi and Yan Chong were not surprised as to why Aunt Bai and He Jiu had chosen to challenge the top ten of Ranking List of Young Masters as practice. After all, they were at the same level. If they fought directly, average masters of Half-step Exterior Scenery would be unable to pose much threat to Aunt Bai or He Jiu. Meanwhile, the disparity in strength between supreme masters of Half-step Exterior Scenery and elementary the Exteriors and masters of Oneness of Heaven and Men was so huge that there was no chance for them to challenge, or what they did would be in vain.</p><p>Even though they could find some average masters of Half-step Exterior Scenery within their families and sects to spar with, their fights were less like real battles since they were relatives. It would be better to host a party inviting masters from Ranking List of Young Masters who had similar strength to them. For victory and their reputation, Meng Qi and the others would typically spare no effort to win, and almost risk their lives.</p><p>There was no first place in literature, but no one cared about second place in martial arts!</p><p>“It seems that the Mi family had some personal interest in hosting the big contest in Ying City. They were creating an opportunity for Aunt Bai’s promotion. It was my fault.” Wang Zai said to Meng Qi using Secret Voice-sending.</p><p>Wang Zai had invited Meng Qi to the party, but he used to be a whetstone for Aunt Bai. As a “righteous” man, Wang Zai felt really bad about that.</p><p>“It doesn’t matter. It was a rare opportunity for me to meet her and experience a master of Oneness of Heaven and Men open the Hidden Latch of the midbrow.” Meng Qi answered casually.</p><p>Meng Qi spoke the truth. The soaring of momentum, the shock of utmost Vital Spirit, the opening of Hidden Latch of Life and death, the spreading of mentality and the natural relation between the laws of Inner World and Outer World and their changes all greatly inspired Meng Qi. It was especially so for the latter. The strange phenomenon during the promotion of masters of Oneness of Heaven and Men was almost a perfect integration that could hardly be seen.</p><p>A direct promotion from the level of Heaven-man Connection would also bring about some strange phenomena. But at most, it would only cause rising winds, blowing clouds, lightning and thunder. The individual himself would change a little based on his or her Inner World and Kung Fu. They would not be like Aunt Bai who projected her Interior Scenery Strength, affected heaven and earth and even electrocuted the earth to such a point that the ground a hundred feet away sank by one inch.</p><p>Also, when Aunt Bai got promoted, her faint wrinkles disappeared. Her skin was glowing, as if she had become ten years younger!</p><p>Wang Zai sighed with emotion. “The promotion of a master of Oneness of Heaven and Men was really extraordinary. I would rather spend another few years to reach the Oneness of Heaven and Men before I strive for a promotion.”</p><p>The top twenty of Ranking List of Young Masters were all ambitious. None of them would be content with their weak foundation, the Half-Step Scenery Level or the first several layers of N-fold Heaven of the Exterior level.</p><p>However, things were hard to predict. Sometimes, dangers and hardship forced those patient masters to break through to achieve the goal of Oneness of Heaven and Men. Some of those masters who were obsessed with the stage of Oneness of Heaven and Men were controlled by their evil thoughts and they could not succeed even after decades of effort. They had to give up in the end.</p><p>The road of Kung Fu was full of difficulties. Geniuses like Su Wuming also suffered from three years of hardship. He had even been thought to be dead during his confinement.</p><p>Wang Zai did not sigh using Secret Voice-sending, so everyone present heard it. A smile appeared on Yan Chong’s face. “The strength of masters of Oneness of Heaven and Men also vary. Shapeless Sword and Ledgerkeeper of Lives had reached this level several years ago, but they had chosen not to enter the next level. They first wanted to know which way they were going to pursue. Heh, Hidden Latch was not a bad idea…”</p><p>At the stage of Oneness of Heaven and Men, primarily thinking about one’s own way would not improve his or her strength a lot, but it was the top priority for their future development. Most Great Masters had gone through this stage.</p><p>Yan Chong’s voice was very low, so people nearby did not hear.</p><p>Deciding the way at the stage of Oneness of Heaven and Men seemed to be easy for everyone, but without genuine impartation and experience from other masters in their families or sects, most people would simply go for it without stopping to consider it. Yan Chong had also suffered a lot before he had gained such experience. How could he let everyone know that?</p><p>Laws should never be easily imparted!</p><p>“It’s strange that in the terms of the real world, it’s the level of Half-Step Scenery after nine Apertures. It’s unexpected that they could be subdivided based on one experience and contact. Heh, both Heaven-man Connection and Oneness of Heaven and Men are nine Apertures. The strength gap among experts of nine apertures is so huge, but the war reports of Six Fan School do not describe that in detail.” Chu Yunyu laughed and said, “Do you think Shapeless Sword would imitate Aunt Bai and challenge several masters?”</p><p>Meng Qi answered, “Maybe not. I guess He Jiu would start from challenging the masters with poor scores to gradually accumulate momentum. After several rounds of battles, he could fight with Master Wang directly to break through.”</p><p>Wang Zai fell silent, lost in his thoughts. While thinking he said, “Excluding Ledgerkeeper of Lives and Fairy of the Extinctive Sword, it would be possible. The Shapeless Sword Qi from Eastsea Sword Village is known as one of the top five skills. He Jiu has killed three nine apertures who were listed in the top in Ranking List of Young Masters in one fight before.”</p><p><em>“Well…”</em> Meng Qi sucked in his breath. <em>“I don’t know about that.”</em></p><p>He knew little about Eastsea Sword Village’s skills. Due to the space limit, the war reports of Ranking List of Young Masters only recorded the most important information. Not many records of He Jiu’s being besieged had been found. Instead, many of his challenging of the top ten masters of Ranking List of Young Masters were recorded.</p><p><em>“I should ask Six Fan School for more detailed information about He Jiu…”</em></p><p>The contest of Ying City lasted for a while. However, after Aunt Bai Zhuyu challenged Meng Qi and the others, no one chose to fight with them. In the end, Mi Zijing came over and said with a smile, “My Aunt has hurried back to stabilize her realm. Forgive our rudeness. I sincerely thank you two on her behalf.”</p><p>Meng Qi and Yan Chong said that it was no big deal. He smiled again. “The history of arranged marriages between the Mi family and the Bai family has lasted for several generations. We are closely connected. The breakthrough of Aunt Bai is also a great event for the Mi family. I want to invite you to my house for a drink. A friend of mine wants to see you.”</p><p>“Who?” Meng Qi asked.</p><p>Mi Zijing answered with a smile, “You will know when you meet him. If I told you now, it would take away the mystery.”</p><p>It turned out that he had some humor.</p><p><em>“I won’t die from a single visit.”</em> Meng Qi knew the Mi family had experts of the Exterior and he was not worried about his safety. After the discussion with Wang Zai and others, they got on the Mi family carriage and moved toward the Family’s old mansion which was located along the River Hui.</p><p>River Hui was not wide but small. It was only wide enough for Wupeng boats. With white walls, black tiles, artificial hills and ponds, the old mansion was a typical River East garden.</p><p>After walking through a passage, Mi Zijing led them into a side yard. Although it was a cold winter, special flowers, colorful and fragrant, were still blossoming there.</p><p>“I’ve stayed at the Mi family residence, but I’ve never come here before.” Wang Zai’s voice which was full of confusion rang inside Meng Qi’s ears.</p><p>However, it did seem reasonable. The old mansion covered a large area with continuous rooms. Moreover, Wang Zai was a guest, so he did not move around. Thus, there were many places that he had not been to.</p><p>After entering Flowers Hall in the side yard, Meng Qi saw three men and one woman. The man sitting up in the front seat had an imposing appearance and looked philosophical with a dash of pride. His noble robe, rings and jade pendant all indicated his wealth.</p><p>He had straight eyebrows that slanted upwards. His appearance reminded Meng Qi of somebody, but he failed to recall the name at the moment.</p><p>The man by his side was in a black robe and had a black silk hat. He had fair skin and no beard. He looked humble yet lofty, and was kind of feminine. However, Meng Qi and Yan Chong noticed him at first sight because they could not judge his strength!</p><p>A man and a woman sat on the left side of the front seat. The man was rough but not ugly. He was young and huge. Although his clothes were loose, his muscles made it fit properly. With pretty eyes and eyebrows, a small face and mouth, the woman was as smooth as water.</p><p>“She’s my sister Ziting.” Mi Zijing first introduced the woman. Then he pointed to the rough man and said, “He is Bai Wenyuan of the Bai family, the legitimate son of master as well as nephew of Aunt Bai.”</p><p><em>“Bai Wenyuan…”</em> Meng Qi looked at him and almost burst out in laughter, but he managed to repress it.</p><p>“There is no need to introduce the rest of them because you met just now.” Mi Zijing smiled.</p><p>Bai Wenyuan and Mi Ziting were clearly both watching battles in other rings at that time, so they both stood up to thank Meng Qi and Yan Chong while expressing their respect to the masters of Ranking List of Young Masters.</p><p>“This is…?” Wang Zai knew Mi Zijing needed an excuse to introduce the man, so he asked.</p><p>Mi Zijing became serious. “This is the Third Prince of our emperor, Prince Jin Zhao Yi.”</p><p><em>“So he’s the brother of old Zhao. No wonder I felt like I’d met him before. They look kind of similar…” Meng Qi suddenly understood. “But why did he come here?”</em></p><p>Unlike the others present, Meng Qi did not revere authority but great power instead.</p><p>Zhao Yi rubbed his jade ring when he suddenly stood up. With a warm smile, he said, “The news of Party of Happycloud enticed me, so I asked for leave. I went from the capital. I’ve heard of your reputation before, but today when I saw you, I knew that fame had fallen short of the truth.”</p><p><em>“Addressing yourself like a king before me… Old Zhao was much more courteous than you!”</em> Meng Qi admonished him.</p><p>Actually, Zhao Yi was rather friendly and hospitable. If it had been in the past, Meng Qi would not have minded. However, the most terrible thing in life was comparisons. Compared with Zhao Heng, Zhao Yi was loftier.</p><p>Zhao Yi’s courtesy pleased Yan Chong. He tried to be reserved and said, “I did not expect a real dragon would attend the Party of Happycloud.”</p><p>In contrast to Yan Chong’s master-like poise, Chu Yunyu was totally flattered. He kept saying, “It’s my great honor to be praised by you. My terrible Kung Fu is not worth mentioning.”</p><p><em>“This guy boasts more than I do…”</em> Meng Qi gave Chu Yunyu a contemptuous look, for he was clearly acting.</p><p>Wang Zai stayed calm and collected. He greeted Prince Jin as a scholar would in a neither cold nor warm manner.</p><p>“Your Highness, did you come here for the Party of Happycloud?” After greeting him, Meng Qi casually asked.</p><p>Zhao Yi nodded with a smile. “The masters listed in the current Ranking List of Young Masters are stronger than those of previous years. The top ten masters are sure to be experts of the Exterior in the future. A party of this caliber is much too attractive to miss.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
