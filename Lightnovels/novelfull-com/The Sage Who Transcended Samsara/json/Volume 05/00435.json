They focused on him expectantly without even blinking an eye, lest they miss more mysterious and exciting details.</p><p>Suddenly, they saw Yin Lengfeng continuously moving backwards as his facial expression changed greatly. The blood coming from his nose paired with the blood spilling from the corners of his eyes made him look quite hellish.</p><p>At the same time, they also heard the creaking of the broken Voodoo doll.</p><p>Zuo Hanfeng had not actually sustained any mental damage. He was just so shaken up that he could not maintain spiritual travel. The opponent drove him out by taking this opportunity, and destroyed the puppet with a countercharge. With as blank of an expression as before, he unconsciously looked at Yin Lengfeng only to see the same look of shock and astonishment. The highly mysterious, indescribable feeling that he’d just had seemed to linger in his mind.</p><p><em>“Heaven is round and the ground is not square?”</em></p><p>What they had just seen had been beyond their grasp of common sense, as well as their understanding of the world and its origin. To their surprise, the starlit sky was quite vast, with countless worlds and Grand Suns. It was deep, serene and ice-cold with no end. They were all as tiny as dust in comparison.</p><p>However, it was not the only vast star universe. There were innumerable similar star universes separated by the crystal wall clustering around the core.</p><p>In the earliest stage, after spurting out from the same point, they each developed Tai Chi and split Yin and Yang.</p><p>Both Zuo Hanfeng and Yin Lengfeng looked at each other, feeling ignorant in the face of this huge universe that they had just seen. Such an enormous and fantastic thing was incapable of being imagined!</p><p>No matter if it was true or not, they were still shocked by the cohesion of beginnings and ends, as well as the Heavenly stretch back to the point of cause and effect without the sequence of time and space. They marvelled at the immensity of heaven and earth, the mystery of the affairs of human life and the insignificance of themselves!</p><p><em>“If this is true…”</em> A thought popped into Zuo Hanfeng and Yin Lengfeng’s minds at the same time. How terrifying the Heavenly Taoist was! He might make the universe vanish by turning his hand over and open up heaven and earth just by opening his eyes!</p><p>Of course, they definitely did not believe the enemy they chased was Heavenly Taoist, because they all could be killed by merely his breath. However, he had to be very familiar with the Taoist Dharma and Logos. Perhaps he also had a mysterious association with Heavenly Taoist, such as having the impartation of Heavenly Taoist’s Divine Skill supreme art.</p><p>While Zuo Hanfeng lowered his head to look at the puppet fragments, the expression in his eyes started to become deep and serene as usual.</p><p>“We have completely lost the clue this time…” Yin Lengfeng would never have intentionally mentioned his failure with his proud personality, but he unconsciously blurted it out due to shock in the moment.</p><p>“What?” Jiang Shenghong and the rest cried in surprise. Had the enemy still managed to destroy the puppet and make Yin Lengfeng’s witchcraft invalid, even if their minds maintained the scene?</p><p><em>“Is the enemy powerful to this degree?”</em></p><p>Meng Qi was not concentrating on his own business anymore. He raised his head at the right moment with a surprised look similar to the people next to him.</p><p>He took the initiative to absorb the spirit of Zuo Hanfeng and Yin Lengfeng into the mind sea by using Supernatural Power of Shaking Heaven and Hitting Earth in reverse. After that, while simulating Heavenly Golden Scripture’s breath with his Eight Nine Mysteries, he sat in the center and stimulated the supreme art to produce a further understanding of the word “Primary”, the pluralistic universe, singularity and his knowledge of the Big Bang that he had learned in his previous life.</p><p>As a result, he succeeded in shocking Yin Lengfeng and Zuo Hanfeng into vibrating their spirits and exposing the flaws in their minds. He then seized the opportunity to turn the tables on them and expel both of them with one stroke, cutting off the connection and destroying their puppet.</p><p>It did not matter what they thought of what they had seen just now, or whether they had greed for it. Instead, it was more important to solve the dilemma at hand. Besides their mission, he and the others were to kill Zuo Hanfeng, so they would have the chance to fight with him sooner or later. What else was there to be feared?</p><p>Furthermore, whatever they did, they had to be able to find themselves first, since the puppet had been destroyed.</p><p>Having slowed down his breathing and turning to look at the people present, Zuo Hanfeng said with great composure, “Please go back and continue to search for them throughout the city. We must chase down Du Huaishang and the people we met before.”</p><p>“Yes, Sir.” Jiang Shenghong bowed.</p><p>After muttering to himself for a little while, Zuo Hanfeng said, “Ji Tao is too incompetent to finish the mission, so he won’t be responsible for being the rat anymore. He will exchange posts with Wen Cheng and run errands for Mr. Yin.”</p><p>Ji Tao had made a worse impression on Zuo Hanfeng after two consecutive failures. Besides, Zuo Hanfeng had also begun to doubt Jiang Shenghong’s abilities.</p><p>Wen Cheng was mainly responsible for the affairs of patrolling and guarding the mansion, without too many additional benefits. Meng Qi did not care much about it, but he believed that it brought him one step closer to assassinating Zuo Hanfeng. However, he seemed to look just as depressed and wronged as Jiang Shenghong at that very moment.</p><p>When leaving the council room, Meng Qi heard both Zuo Hanfeng and Yin Lengfeng sigh lightly.</p><p>“Heavenly…”</p><p>…</p><p>There did not seem to be any rumors about Heavenly Primogenitor in this world. Meng Qi left deep in thought following Jiang Shenghong, and made an excuse about him planning to transfer Jiang Zhiwei and the rest to the attendant soldier team from the rat team, putting them under his command.</p><p>Wen Cheng naturally agreed to his request since he was worrying Ji Tao would make him a mere figurehead after managing the rat team for so many years with numerous henchmen. Now, to his surprise, Ji Tao was taking the initiative to make a concession, which was just what he wanted!</p><p>In the moonless, starry night, Meng Qi walked inside the mansion along with Jiang Zhiwei, who had pasted a handlebar mustache on her face, to check every patrol team while Qi Zhengyan, Ruan Yushu and Zhao Heng reserved their strength in the courtyard by not walking around to keep others from discovering their flaws.</p><p>“I will guide you on patrol these days to get you familiar with this place early…” Meng Qi imitated Ji Tao’s behavior. ‘To find a chance for the assassination,’ was left unsaid.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei stared at the starry sky, looking thoughtful. She barely replied with an “Mm” after hearing what Meng Qi had said.</p><p>Meng Qi frowned and asked with the Secret Voice-sending technique, “Is something on your mind?”</p><p>She was always looking thoughtful recently. Was it possible that she had come up against some problem that she couldn’t solve?</p><p>Hardly had Jiang Zhiwei spoken after biting her lip for a little while, when her expression turned heavy suddenly and her gaze became sharp again. She drew Meng Qi away and hid behind the artificial hill nearby, giving him a tip through her look to hide his breath.</p><p>Meng Qi used his Mystic Art to make his breath faint. His mind, like a bright mirror, drew the outlines of everything around them to thoroughly expose everything in his view.</p><p>After a few breaths, a graceful figure coming from the garden snuck over toward the margin of Liu Shou mansion.</p><p>“Lan Die?” Meng Qi recognized her. She was another Dissimilated Man, serving as a subordinate of Yin Lengfeng.</p><p>“Yin Lengfeng is here, too…” Jiang Zhiwei said with Secret Voice-sending technique.</p><p>Meng Qi was immediately astounded, but he did not dare to strengthen his sensing due to the fear of Yin Lengfeng becoming aware of it. He had not discovered that the light shadow accompanying Lan Die was indeed Yin Lengfeng until Lan Die passed by the artificial hill!</p><p>They reached the bottom of the wall in an instant at an extremely high speed. After looking around, they pressed their palms together and jumped up to the air, leaping out of the Manor.</p><p><em>“Where are they going? ”</em> With so many questions rising in his mind, Meng Qi immediately made a decision. He said with the Secret Voice-sending technique, “Let’s follow them!”</p><p>After all, Ji Tao did not get along with Yin Lengfeng, so it was normal for Ji Tao to tail after him in secret to catch him sleeping when his secretive whereabouts had been found.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei nodded without saying a word. She leapt over the wall with Meng Qi after waiting a while, tracing Lan Die and Yin Lenghui following the little trace that Lan Die left behind.</p><p>They didn’t dare get too close to Yin Lengfeng and Lan Die, since Yin Lengfeng had a powerful, violent strength that belonged to a higher realm. They were afraid that they would be discovered by him even if they just spied on him from a distance. Luckily, due to Lan Die’s insufficient skills, there were still some breaths left within a short distance even if she had wiped away most of her trace. It was easy for Jiang Zhiwei, who cultivated the Sword Washing Pavilion secret technique, to discover those breaths.</p><p>After some time along on the winding road, they saw City God Temple, which was very lonely as no one offered incense or sacrifices to gods in the night.</p><p>Having looked around, Meng Qi gave Jiang Zhiwei a tip to leap up into the big tree nearby along with him with a tug.</p><p>They found Yin Lengfeng and Lan Die very quickly from the shelter of the treetop with its commanding position overlooking the ground below. They stood in the grassy field next to City God Temple, meeting a young man in loose robe with long sleeves standing opposite them.</p><p>This good-looking man closed his eyes tightly. He looked unusual with a sublime breath.</p><p>Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei took a quick glance, not daring to spend more time observing them. Both Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei finally stared at the steps and tried their best to listen to the conversation, their ears slightly vibrating.</p><p>“Your Eminence, I had a weird encounter today.” Yin Lengfeng told the young man the whole story of Heavenly in detail.</p><p><em>“Your Eminence?”</em> Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei looked at each other, seeing each other’s surprised looks. They had not expected His Eminence of the secret sect that Yin Lengfeng belonged to also be in Daning.</p><p><em>“He doesn’t seem like an Exterior member judging from his breath though, does he?”</em></p><p>After listening to Yin Lengfeng, the man who had his eyes shut whispered, “Heavenly Taoist…I also haven’t heard of…”</p><p>“Your Eminence, would you please help us ask the Ancestor about it?” Yin Lengfeng asked expectantly.</p><p><em>“The Ancestor?”</em> Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei were becoming more and more surprised at the sect, which seemed a little weird.</p><p>“Sure.” His Eminence, who still had his eyes closed, did not make any excuses. It seemed that he also wanted to figure something out.</p><p>After talking, he did some quirky footwork, taking on a twisted and insane posture. Somehow, two words suddenly came to Meng Qi’s mind.</p><p><em>“Shaman Dance!”</em></p><p>The handsome man sat cross-legged and slowly opened his eyes following the mysterious and scary sacreligious rite.</p><p>Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei quietly took a glance at him and were attracted by his eyes in that moment, unable to withdraw the glance from him for a short while.</p><p>They were a pair of deep and serene eyes full of vanity, without end or any emotion. The void cracked all of a sudden, revealing a vast piece of land.</p><p>There were steep mountains and rivers with fast-flowing water on the ground, making it unsuitable to build cities or make pathways. The place seemed somewhat remote.</p><p>One of the mountains got larger, covered with all kinds of insects and wild beasts that truly frightened people.</p><p>While looking across the mountains, they saw a red sea which seemed to have been formed by innumerable drops of blood.</p><p>A shadow sat cross-legged on a blood lotus seat floating in the middle of the blood sea, emitting heaven and earth-destroying momentum.</p><p>Both Yin Lengfeng and Lan Die lowered their heads and said with great respect, “Your Excellency Ancestor, we come to greet you.”</p><p>His Eminence’s lips moved as he seemed to report the recent happenings to the Ancestor.</p><p>After a few moments, His Eminence said with a bleak and deep voice, “It is the impartation of the spiritual mystique and Heavenly Primogenitor, so please don’t make a fuss.”</p><p>“Heavenly Primogenitor?” When Yin Lengfeng was about to ask one more question, His Eminence had closed his eyes. The boundless sea and the heaven and earth-destroying momentum also disappeared suddenly. Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei seized the chance to look away.</p><p>“We will let you know what you need to know.” His Eminence replied.</p><p>Yin Lengfeng took a deep breath to relieve the previous shock.</p><p>“We haven’t yet found Du Huaishang, which delayed the reincarnation and arrival of the Ancestor to the world. Please don’t blame us.” He said with an apologetic look.</p><p><em>“Reincarnation and arrival to the world…”</em> Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei suddenly realized that they had heard something important…</p><p>“Never mind that. He is unable to escape as he is still in Daning.” His Eminence consoled him and asked him to go back and keep luring Zuo Hanfeng.</p><p>While Yin Lengfeng was waiting for Lan Die to go back with him, he suddenly saw that Lan Die had clung to His Eminence, her limbs intertwined with his. After secretly scolding the man and woman for their unjustifiable relationship, he went back to the mansion by himself.</p><p>Lan Die stood up straight in a hurry by the time Yin Lengfeng walked away, and whispered, “Heavenly Golden Scripture and Book of the Chaos. I’m afraid that the opponents are…”</p><p>His Eminence suddenly spoke, interrupting her,</p><p>“Please come out if you two have seen enough.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
