The others could not help finding it amusing even though they were on guard too.</p><p>However, the Prince seemed as if he had let go of all his expectations and ambitions – as if he had completely given up on the grapple for the throne. His expression remained calm and composed, showing not the slightest hint of worry or fear. The golden lotus flower gradually turned a darkened yellow as the Sanskrit script changed non-stop, fading in and out of distinctness so fast that even Sima Shi, a Half-step to Dharmakaya master, found it hard to distinguish the words.</p><p>Having always had an inquisitive mind, Meng Qi kept his eyes only half-closed and his state of mind peaceful. He entered the golden Buddha, whose hand pointed to the sky and whose feet pressed on the ground, inside his Vital Spirit. He used the opportunity to mimic the momentum in the Buddha’s pair of eyes.</p><p>His eyes turned as clear and pure as colored glass, but exposed no breath underneath the cover of the eyelids.</p><p>He set his sight on the Wordless Stone Stele, and the constantly changing Sanskrit script finally took shape.</p><p>“Buddhist Emperor.”</p><p><em>“Such Arrogance…”</em> Meng Qi closed his eyes. When he opened them again, they became as crystal clear and deep as a lake.</p><p>In a couple of minutes, the darkened yellow lotus flower dissipated and the Sanskrit script faded. The Wordless Stone Stele returned to its usual simple, unadorned, and worn-out state.</p><p>The Crown Prince returned to the platform with a restrained smile, ignoring the overcast stare of the aged Emperor and the thoughtful expressions of everyone else.</p><p>Meng Qi casted a glance on all those that remained, feeling not the faintest hint of frustration. He was about to be the final actor to go on the stage.</p><p>Fan Changmiao, the Slivery-badge Arrester in his maroon uniform walked down the stage, and began to probe the Wordless Stone Stele.</p><p>No one mocked his attempt. Maybe there would be something to gain from the attempt? Though they had all seen countless people try their luck, only to return empty-handed, no one gave up.</p><p>Everyone was engaged in their own activities as they watched, be it sipping tea or chatting. The entire atmosphere instantly became more relaxed.</p><p>Meng Qi, however, watched with rapt attention. He was still unable to fully understand the scholar, who achieved top scorer in the palace examination. He could tell that he was in the Heaven-man Connection realm but was vague on the details. Perhaps the cultivation method that the scholar used was unique.</p><p>If the scholar managed to gain some sort of realization, perhaps Meng Qi would be able to tell something…</p><p>Wang Zai, noticing how serious Meng Qi appeared to be, said, “Born and bred in Luoyang, Fang Changmiao couldn’t be considered as well-known before earning the top place in the palace examination. Truly, a talent hides in the shadows.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded, looking thoughtful. “What cultivation method does he use?”</p><p>“I heard it’s Taiyi’s Relief Sword, a cultivation method handed down in his family throughout generations.” Wang Zai once again demonstrated how well-connected he was.</p><p><em>“I’ve never heard of that…”</em> Unless it was a top cultivation method, Meng Qi would have hardly heard of it.</p><p>During their idle conversation, their eyes suddenly turned somber. They closed their mouths and focused their gazes on Fan Changmiao.</p><p>Be it due to the clouds obstructing sunlight or some other reason, Fan Changmiao’s body appeared a little clouded.</p><p>“Did he realize something?” Wang Zai asked, astonished.</p><p>He has just finished speaking when rays of light burst out of the gloom. They were faint and indefinite, yet dazzling and captivating, just like sword light.</p><p>Some of the disciples of aristocratic families with poorer concentration, who had come merely to gain experience, spewed tea out of their mouths. They were shocked that Fan Changmiao managed to realize something.</p><p>Just how many Half-step Exterior Scenery masters had failed earlier? Only the Unstoppable, number two on the Ranking List of Young Masters, as well as the Crown Prince who was already on the verge of a breakthrough, were successful. What right did Fan Changmiao have to succeed as well?</p><p>Based on his Heaven-man Connection realm? Based on his 15th place on the Ranking List of Young Masters?</p><p>What a joke!</p><p>Meng Qi was not surprised and answered Wang Zai’s question earlier. “Even someone in the realm of Heaven-man Connection can reflect on his path. There is no paradox.”</p><p>Wang Zai casted him a deep look, vaguely guessing that Meng Qi was also in the same situation as Fan Changmiao.</p><p>“Killing Blade must be under great pressure now that Fan Changmiao has gained realization!” There were those who glanced at the platform housing Meng Qi and Wang Zai.</p><p>“That’s right. The second and 15th on the Ranking List of Young Masters had gained realization. If he, as the number one on the ranking, gained nothing, he would lose all face.” In quiet voices, the rest answered in agreement.</p><p>“Talk is cheap. If he doesn’t surpass them, what right does he have to be called the number one on the Ranking List of Young Masters?”</p><p>“That’s unnecessary. Since unusual phenomena don’t differ by much, it’ll be hard to tell who has the upper hand…”</p><p>Fan Changmiao opened his eyes in the midst of a crowd engaging in a heated discussion. He bowed in thanks of heavenly favor and returned to his seat with a smile.</p><p>The unexpected outcome by an unexpected person caused such great commotion that no one noticed that Xuanzhen had arrived at the vacant stele.</p><p>Silence quickly ensued as the Wordless Stone Stele became enveloped in a dazzling glow. A Bodhi tree, with its lush green leaves and prayer beads-like seeds, materialized behind Xuanzhen.</p><p>No one believed that Xuanzhen would not be able to come to a realization. He originated from the Zen Buddhism of the Shaolin Temple and had always been showing steady progress towards a breakthrough. He was not lacking in his Oneness of Heaven and Men realm. He had a profound grasp of the Teachings of Buddhism. It would be weirder if he could not grasp any realization!</p><p>In the time it took to finish a cup of tea, the Bodhi tree behind him wilted. He opened his eyes and said, as if in lament, “Bodhi… wisdom… I’ve finally understood it. I wouldn’t be returning empty-handed… Amitabha, I had had desires.”</p><p>He then placed his hands together to thank the Emperor.</p><p>“Buddhist Monk Xuanzhen has a profound grasp of the nature of Buddhism. It’s only natural for you to gain realization,” the aged Emperor replied.</p><p>Xuanzhen shook his head with a gentle smile. “It’s unfortunate that my nephew, Zhen Hui, isn’t here. He would’ve gained even deeper realization than I’ve had…”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded in approval. Zhen Hui should not be underestimated just because he had only opened his Seven Apertures and was still far, far away from reflecting upon his path. His Flower-pinching Finger — ‘Siddhartha Gautama Nipping the Flower while Smiling in Harmony’ — had always been the symbol of enlightenment. Zhen Hui was an intelligent person hidden underneath his apparent ignorance. Meng Qi would not be surprised if he was able to gain realization.</p><p>While the disciples were discussing and debating over what Xuanzhen had comprehended, Zhao Heng took in a deep breath and began walking down the platform.</p><p>This elicited a noise of surprise from Meng Qi. Compared to the past, Old Fifth now exuded a dignified and courtly air. Though the ministers were neck deep in their shrewdness, they still turned to stare at him.</p><p>Prince Wei had always been inconspicuous in the past. Even if his health had improved and his kung fu had progressed, he never came under anyone’s notice. Now, judging from his posture alone, he didn’t seem to be lagging behind even the Crown Prince or Prince Jin.</p><p>Zhao Heng first bowed to his royal father before sitting cross-legged in front of the stone stele and entering a state of meditation.</p><p>The lake remained still without so much as a ripple across its surface. The surroundings of the stele showed nothing unusual.</p><p>“Seems like Prince Wei, like Prince Jin, still lacks a little something…” a certain disciple of an aristocratic family in Luoyang remarked, shaking his head.</p><p>His words just came out when a Dragon’s Cry, majestic and noble that it was, pierced through the silence. Golden dragons flew out of the stele one after another, baring their fangs and brandishing their claws, and spiraled behind Zhao Heng!</p><p><em>“This… This is the True Dragon Emperor…”</em> Such a thought came to countless people.</p><p>Prince Jin’s expression shifted dramatically, having not expected that the younger brother that he had never paid attention to to comprehend true dragons!</p><p>The aged Emperor’s eyes were narrowed and he subconsciously balled his right hand into a fist.</p><p>The dragons coiled around Zhao Heng and entered his body before emerging again. When they reappeared, they had condensed into a golden seal that gently landed in front of his forehead.</p><p>When Zhao Heng reopened his eyes, Meng Qi knew that he had, at least, saved the hard work of a year’s worth of cultivation.</p><p>“Thank you, Royal Father, for this granting me this opportunity to study the stele,” Zhao Heng said, without forgetting etiquette.</p><p>The entire place was submerged in an atypical silence as many ministers lost their words. They stared at Zhao Heng, sizing him up as if they just knew him.</p><p>A smile finally appeared on the aged Emperor’s face. “Not bad, not bad. There’s now another outstanding son of the Zhao family!”</p><p>This was a compliment of the highest order. Prince Jin’s face was particularly dark while the Crown Prince briefly wore an expression of astonishment before returning to its usual tranquil state.</p><p>However, Prince Jin wasn’t too concerned. When it came to the throne, it wasn’t enough for Zhao Heng to simply demonstrate his talents. Even if his talent was similar to the likes of Su Meng and Gao Lan, he still had to consider the stance of the various big powers.</p><p>Under the circumstances where there was no suppression of the Dharmakaya, there were countless princes with amazing talent who were eliminated from being adopted as heirs. That was because the aristocratic families were afraid that they would condense the Dharmakaya by using the power of the Emperor.</p><p>“I didn’t expect that Prince Wei would so remarkable as well…” Wang Zai commented frankly, appearing not the least jealous.</p><p>Meng Qi pursed his lips, looking deep in thought. It had not been that long since Zhao Heng’s breakthrough and he had not found his tentative path yet. To demonstrate such an unusual phenomenon, he likely had the support of the True Emperor Seal.</p><p>This was truly the secret treasure of the Human Path!</p><p>Everyone’s eyes shifted between Aunt Bai and Meng Qi after they saw Zhao Heng return to his seat. The two of them were the only ones left…</p><p>One of them was a perfect Half-step, promoted from the realm of Oneness of Heaven and Men; the other was the number one of the Ranking List of Young Masters. Both had a foundation for realization. Would they produce large unusual phenomena and suppress those that had gone before them?</p><p>If their results do not differ by much, then it is likely that Prince Wei, who had conjured up true dragons, would win as champion.</p><p>At this time, someone that they had neglected quietly walked up to the stele.</p><p>“Huh? Who’s that?”</p><p>“Seems… Seems to be a Foreign Official of the Gongsun family.”</p><p>“Oh. I heard it is ‘Befalling Devil’ Qi Zhengyan, a master in the 20th place on the Ranking List of Young Masters and heir to the Huanhua Swords Sect.”</p><p>Ever since entering the ranking list, Qi Zhengyan had received the favor of his sect and were given many resources to support his cultivation.</p><p><em>“Can the Book of the Chaos, which isn’t on the level of Heaven-man Connection, bring him realization…?”</em> A curious Meng Qi looked forward to the outcome.</p><p>With Fan Changmiao’s success before,the rest of the participants did not dare to relax and watched attentively.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan, dressed completely in black, had a tall and straight stature. He had ordinary looks and a complete lack of expression. After paying respects to the Emperor, he went off without regard for everyone else and stood in front of the stele.</p><p>It was now already afternoon. The autumn sunlight, as bright as ever, spilled on the stele and Qi Zhengyan enveloped them in a layer of golden yellow glow.</p><p>Time gradually slipped past without Qi Zhengyan and the stele changing.</p><p>Just as everyone thought that he had no chance, the surroundings turned dark yellow and a red sun emerged over the river. The exceptionally mellow sun slowly sank into the river again.</p><p>“The full sun setting over the river…” It was the line of a poem which crossed the minds of Meng Qi and the others.</p><p>The setting sun and river water were enveloped in a fresh layer of sunset glow, so red that it resembled fire. Mist rose from the surface of the river, and birds, drawn by an unknown factor, flocked to the red clouds, and danced amonst mist. The river turned the same color as the sky.</p><p>Illusions after illusions materialized, making everyone stare in amazement. Lines of poetry crossed their mind.</p><p><em>“The setting sun and the lone harrier shoots through the rosy clouds; the autumn water merges with the boundless sky to form one hue…”</em></p><p><em>“It’s as if a sudden spring breeze in the night bringing thousand of pear trees to bloom…”</em></p><p><em>“A tilted stone-paved path lies in a distant frosty mountain, people’s houses resides deep within the white clouds…”</em></p><p>“The white spraying torrent runs straight down three thousand feets, seemingly the Milky Way descending from Ninth Heaven…”</p><p><em>“Everywhere the leaves fall rustling from the trees, while the turbulent Yangtze forever rolls on…”</em></p><p>…</p><p>“Those were the many demonstrations of the sword arts of the Huanhua Swords Sect!” Sounds of exclamations came while everyone was still struggling with shock. Plenty of eyebrows were raised, including those of the ministers.</p><p>However, to Meng Qi, the display of sword arts were not merely of the Huanhua Swords Sect!</p><p>His solemn pair of eyes was coupled with a focused expression as he watched the White Cloud Smoke, Rosy Afterglow Swing, Kunlun Crush, Azure Blizzard, Purple Star River, as well as the cultivation method of Book of the Chaos. They blended into the verse sword art of the Huanhua Swords Sect!</p><p>What kind of unusual phenomenon was this?</p><p>Numerous unusual phenomena whirled and fused into one another, yet struggled to hold their shape as they were continually dispelled by the gloom.</p><p>Out of the blue, the surroundings of the stele turned dark. Rays of sword light then burst forth to illuminate the entire place. The numerous unusual phenomena blended into one, soaring alongside the rays of light. They were full of vigor and will for improvement!</p><p>Wang Zai could not help opening his mouth to speak.</p><p>“Nature is ever vigorous, and a gentleman must ceaselessly strive along with it!”</p><p>“Qi Zhengyan borrowed the power of the Wordless Stone Stele to unite his kung fu and invented a move that belonged solely to him!”</p><p><em>“Nature is ever vigorous, and a gentleman must ceaselessly strive along with it… That has always been Senior Brother Qi’s maxim. Is it also his contemplation over his path?”</em> Meng Qi sighed, feeling both astonished and gratified.</p><p>Countless disciples of aristocratic families watched with their mouths open, dumbstruck. Qi Zhengyan’s realization was, without a doubt, the most shocking one that they had seen all day.</p><p>Indeed one cannot judge a person by his appearance…</p><p>Qi Zhengyan remained as expressionless as ever. He thanked the Emperor for his compliment and returned to his seat.</p><p>The next person up for the attempt was Aunt Bai. The river sank and the ground shuddered as she too gained some realization. Compared to the realization she had obtained when she was in her Half-step realm, it was more mellow and clear this time around. However, the unusual phenomenon that she had produced could only be discussed along the same lines as Xuanzhen and the rest. It was incomparable to Qi Zhengyan’s results at all.</p><p>Now, Meng Qi was the only one left.</p><p>It was only then that the disciples of aristocratic families snapped out of their shock and turned their attention on Meng Qi, wondering what kind of results would the number one on the Ranking List of Young Masters garner.</p><p>Would he be able to surpass all those that had gone before him and those whose rankings were beneath his?</p><p>Would he be able to prove himself superior to Qi Zhengyan, who had combined his learnings to create a new move?</p><p>It seemed unlikely as realization did not correlate with one’s strength. It did not mean that the higher one’s ranking was or the stronger one’s battle prowess was, the better he would be at coming to a realization.</p><p>The ministers, one after another, stared at Meng Qi. Their gazes were full of judgment as they sized him up.</p><p>Meng Qi did not felt much pressure at first as he thought he would be able to easily surpass Xuanzhen and the rest. However, Qi Zhengyan’s impressive results made him a little nervous. Could he surpass him?</p><p>One should not have any sense of hesitation before an ‘enemy’. Meng Qi took in a deep breath and calmed his turbulent emotions. Everything around him disappeared before being drawn in an outline on his mind. The Vital Qi around the world slowly swayed and entered his body, making him feel relaxed, dispelling all thoughts of victory and defeat.</p><p>He rose from his seat without haste and slowly made his way over to the stele.</p><p>He paid respect to the Emperor first before sitting cross-legged under everyone’s watchful eyes.</p><p>Instead of closing his eyes immediately, he took the time to carefully observe the Wordless Stone Stele. The stele was whitish-grey in color and appeared unadorned and old. The tiny cracks that covered its surface seemed to be left behind when the stele was taken out of the ruins.</p><p>He finally pressed his eyelids shut and drew support from the world around him to sense the stele. Yet, he felt only emptiness coming from the endless whitish-gray mass.</p><p>Having long prepared himself for this moment, he eliminated any inklings of realization related to the Buddha’s Palm or Divine Nine-Annihilation to prevent speculation. He continued to operate his Inner World, demonstrating the path that he had established in its initial stage, and visualizing what was related to it.</p><p>The Aperture acupoints ‘opened’ around him, containing what appeared to be primal chaos, or sky dotted with stars, or ever-changing heavens and immutable land. Toward the east was a line of hibiscus trees; towards was the west were the Kunlun mountains…</p><p>Each one of the numerous stars inside the Aperture acupoints was a flickering Grand Sun surrounded by countless lightless stars. Together, they formed a galaxy, then interstellar clouds, and finally the boundless and vast Milky Way.</p><p>Sensing an opportunity, he felt a gentle wiggle within the deep whitish-grey mass, as if it was about to spout something.</p><p>Over on the platform, Wang Zai saw how the stele took on a fluorescence glow after Meng Qi closed his eyes, and nodded. His face was full of smiles, feeling that an unusual phenomenon would occur soon. He was sure that Little Meng would definitely come to a realization.</p><p>Every Aperture acupoint was a separate universe of its own that flowed to form the Celestial.</p><p>The Celestial, Nine Innate Apertures, as well his internal organs evolved to form the Five Elements that spouted with the will to live. They declared the coming of doomsday as a natural self-reinforcing cycle.</p><p>The shaking of the whitish-grey mass became even more violent as Meng Qi’s Inner World inched towards the Celestial. He could now vaguely sense the breath of the Celestial!</p><p>That was the interweaving of law and reason, the manifestation of tao and virtue!</p><p>It made his understanding of the Celestial become even more detailed and complete.</p><p>The aged Emperor nodded to himself as he saw how the glow of the stele turned brighter and brighter. Everyone else had also prepared themselves for the unusual phenomenon that was about to occur.</p><p>Could the Killing Blade surpass Qi Zhengyan of the Huanhua Swords Sect?</p><p>Just then, just when Meng Qi was operating his Celestial, the shaking of the whitish-gray mass came to a plateau. Instead of trembling even more violently, it came to a gradual stop!</p><p>How could this happen?</p><p>Meng Qi was wholeheartedly devoted to probing for a realization and did not suffer from any turbulence in his emotions. Yet, Wang Zai and the others watched as the fluorescence glow began to gradually diminish.</p><p>Expressions of shock crossed their faces. They could not believe that something like this would happen. Could Killing Blade, number one on the Ranking List of Young Masters, be still half a step short from a realization?</p><p>Yet, among the top 20 of the ranking list, there were three who had already come to realizations of their own!</p><p>The Celestial was greater than the universe, occupying the superior position and influencing the law and reason of the latter. However, the nearer Meng Qi came to it, the slower trembling of the whitish-gray became.</p><p>By the time he was done ‘operating’ the Celestial, the whitish-grey mass had thoroughly come to a standstill.</p><p>However, in his realization, the whitish-grey mass had become even darker and gloomier. Compared to how it was earlier, there was an indescribable change to it.</p><p>Beyond the Celestial, there was an indescribable ‘point’ at the source of the river of time. One could not pinpoint directions to it, nor speed relative to it.</p><p>The concept of time was lost at the ‘point’. It was the cause of all, the source of everything!</p><p>Meng Qi’s Vital Spirit was among them. His eyes were half opened, half closed. His momentum was serene and hidden in the depth of the primal chaos. It was hard to describe what he had seen with mere words.</p><p>“There was obviously a fluorescence glow earlier. Why would it diminish?” a disciple asked his companion in a quiet voice.</p><p>His companion wore a faint smile and replied, “That means he’s still lacking by a little.”</p><p>He turned to glance at Fan Changmiao, nodding and congratulating him.</p><p>Fan Changmiao returned a nod in greeting. His eyes were full of doubt as he stared at the still stele and Meng Qi. Could Meng Qi had not had comprehended his path?</p><p>Wang Siyuan’s face had been plastered with a smile all along. It was only until he saw Qi Zhengyan’s results that he lifted an eyebrow. He was now frowning, believing that his deduction appeared to be a little off…</p><p>“Little Meng is incredibly confident today and he’s definitely not someone who will be blindly confident…” Wang Zai glanced at Ruan Yushu and Qi Zhengyan, two of Meng Qi’s close friends and saw how they paid close attention to the stele. They did not appear to be disappointed, only doubtful.</p><p>Meng Qi’s Vital Spirit remained unchanging as he sat cross-legged, or perhaps it had encompassed all the changes.</p><p>The cause of all, the beginning of all, it was the origin of everything.</p><p>Suddenly, Meng Qi’s Vital Spirit opened his eyes.</p><p>The primal chaos splits open and the Celestial appeared. The universe evolved and formed heaven and earth!</p><p>The whitish-grey mass spouted breath at the same time, as it became part of such feeling.</p><p>The burning sun shined from high above, spilling golden sunshine on the stele. There were no shadows, changes, or scripts. There was nothing except the stele itself.</p><p>Just then, Meng Qi’s two eyes flew open. He got up, saluted the Emperor, and returned to the platform.</p><p>“There’s no unusual phenomenon at all?”</p><p>“Killing Blade’s indeed a person whose battle prowess is greater than his realm…”</p><p>“He’s far beneath Fan Changmiao in terms of perception and reflection upon heaven and earth…”</p><p>Wang Zai had his eyes closed in contemplation amid the heated discussions of those around him. He was thinking that things should not have progressed this way when he heard a sharp and clear sound.</p><p>Silence fell over the palace as all sound disappeared. Wang Zai instantly opened his eyes and saw that the stele was gradually splitting open in the center!</p><p>The crack, alongside snapping sounds, extended even further and deeper.</p><p><em>“The Wordless Stone Stele splits open… It splits open…”</em> Wang Zai was dumbstruck. This was far beyond his imagination.</p><p>Wang Siyuan narrowed his eyes immediately. He had forgotten to breathe.</p><p>Fan Changmiao tightened his grip around the handle of his sword, eyes full of confusion.</p><p><em>“The Wordless Stone Stele splits open… It splits open…”</em> Those who had been caught in discussions earlier appeared befuddled.</p><p>The hand that the Master of Cui family, Cui Qingyu, had placed on his knee unknowingly throbbed. The Chief Arrester of the Six Fan School took in a sharp intake of breath.</p><p>No matter how strong a person was or how profound his realm was, never had the ministers seen something like this happen. They could not help feeling shocked.</p><p><em>“The Wordless Stone Stele splits open… It splits open…”</em></p><p>Crash! Countless cups from the hands of the disciples of aristocratic families fell to the ground.</p><p>The aged Emperor appeared deeply stunned but his face soon darkened and took on an unsightly expression. How could he face his ancestors if the Wordless Stone Stele was smashed under his care?</p><p>The sounds of cracking stopped. The stele did not shatter in half and remained as serene and still as ever. The new crack was so long that comparing the tiny ones on the surface of the stele to it was like comparing streams to river.</p><p><em>“Fortunately it didn’t shatter…”</em> The aged Emperor heaved a deep sigh of relief.</p><p>He spoke, amid sounds of gasping, “I declare Killing Blade the winner…”</p><p>With his emotions still in such turbulence, he could not bring himself to evaluate Meng Qi’s results. He desperately needed to calm himself down.</p><p>Meng Qi felt his physical body take on a fresh feeling of liveliness, as if his binds were reduced once again. Earlier, his realization had mingled with his breath. He was now only one opportunity away from a breakthrough!</p><p>Perhaps due to the battle, or perhaps when he had finally understood the reason Su Ziyuan was sent to Shaolin Temple…</p><p>“Killing Blade is terrifying…”</p><p>“What was it that he realized that the stele couldn’t handle the pressure?”</p><p>“Could it be because there were too many people who had come to a realization earlier?”</p><p>“What a joke! Do you think the Emperor would allow anyone to use the stele if usage is an issue?”</p><p>“Perhaps Killing Blade is the strongest number one of the Ranking List of Young Masters for all time…”</p><p>Surrounded by murmurs of exclamations, Meng Qi remained steady in his steps. His green robe ruffled as he returned to his seat without haste.</p><p>He had just gotten seated when the corner of his mouth curled into a subconscious smile. He glanced at the stele, taking in the deep crack on it.</p><p><em>“It’s a good thing it didn’t break. Otherwise, it wouldn’t be enough even if they sell me off to pay for it…”</em> Meng Qi rejoiced in secret. Of course, his Buddha’s Palm was comparable with it.</p><p>Wang Zai cast him a glance and saw the unsuppressible emotions on Meng Qi’s face. He looked at him like he was looking at a monster clad in human skin. “This is the first time this has happened in the history of the stele.”</p><p>For some reason, he added quietly to himself, <em>“It’s fortunate enough not to die…”</em></p><p>Meng Qi could not think of a proper response. In the end, he chose to turn it into a joke. “There’s a first time for everything.”</p><p>Wang Siyuan began to cough in a violent fit.</p><p>The aged Emperor bestowed Meng Qi a cup of wine after a brief silence. He then said, “Here is my third question. The way of kung fu is meant for the establishment of a nation. No matter how much realization you have garnered or how profound your state of mind is, it still boils down to your battle prowess. There’s a dreamland formation inside the Jade Forest Garden that can emulate a dangerous battleground of deep valleys and high mountains while allowing participants to escape in times of danger. If there’s anyone who wishes for real combat experience, you can enter.”</p><p>“This battle will be a chaotic one. The last person who is expelled from the formation will be crowned the winner.”</p><p>“So that’s it. If I team up with my friends, there’s still hope for a victory…” Realization dawned on Meng Qi. However, since it would be a dreamland formation, he had to consider the terrains and weather. There might not even be a way for him to contact his friends.</p><p>Cui Qingyu muttered to himself, “Though the formation will be there to protect those inside and allow them to leave, perhaps it’ll be late to take effect if there’s any disturbance. It’d be regretful if anything happens to such talents.”</p><p>The aged Emperor chuckled. “Since Cui feels unassured, I’ll release the prohibitions and allow you all to mark your breath on your disciples. You can pull them out of the formation at the crucial moment. Coupled with the protections of the formation itself, nothing will go wrong.”</p><p>Cui Qingyu nodded gently. He had no other opinion.</p><p>…</p><p>Outside the palace, Progenitor Doumu had long finished talking about the past. She closed her eyes in silence as if she was trying to sense something.</p><p>Her eyes suddenly flew open and she muttered quietly, “It has begun…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
