If one took a careful look around, however, one would realize that the void was gently swaying like waves. What was before one’s eyes felt both real and unreal.</p><p>Meng Qi was reluctant to allow someone’s breath to be fixed on him because he carried too many secrets. Even so, for his safety, he accepted Su Li’s kind gesture.</p><p>It was not as if he did not have the ability to cut off Su Li’s breath if there was any chance that his identity might be exposed!</p><p>None of the talents who attended the Sumptuous Fruits Banquet withdrew from the challenge. Even if they were well aware of how weak they were in comparison with Xuanzhen and the rest, they still entered the dreamland. The figured they might very well encounter battles with top masters like Xuanzhen, Aunt Bai, and Killing Blade as soon as they entered, and could be eliminated early. They had no ambitions to emerge to the top. If they could hide and become the last few to leave the formation, it would be a kind of win!</p><p>The aged Emperor chuckled as he watched them make their way over the waves and enter the dreamland formation. “Most of the time, we’ll be able to watch the battles instantly as they occur. Other times, so as not to weaken the effect of the formation, mist and dark nights will materialize in certain areas and obscure our view. After all, some people are more skilled at sneak attacks and not head-on confrontations. We have to give them a fair chance. Of course, my esteemed ministers, you are all free to use the breath attached to your disciples to sense their surroundings. It wouldn’t be obscured by the mist nor the cover of the night.”</p><p>His clear and complete explanation gave the ministers no reason to raise any objections.</p><p>The three princes – Crown Prince, Prince Jin, and Zhao Heng – were the last to enter the dreamland.</p><p>Meng Qi felt his body pass through layer after layer of damp and heavy waves. The waves then dissipated to reveal a canyon stretching before his eyes.</p><p>He lifted his head and saw the horizon pressed into one fine line. On both sides were precipitous cliffs covered in lush green.</p><p>Five disciples of aristocratic families dressed in brocades stood in the middle of the canyon. They appeared uncertain as they took in the environment.</p><p>They instantly spotted Meng Qi.</p><p>“Killing Blade!”</p><p>“Su Meng!”</p><p>“To think we’ll really come across him!”</p><p>Quiet sounds of exclamations came from the disciples, who all looked to be on guard. They wanted to retreat, yet they also feared that Meng Qi would hunt them down and leave them no chance to fight back.</p><p>Meng Qi gripped his saber in his right hand and walked toward them without expression. His every step seemed to grate on their hearts, making them tremble all over. They felt that Killing Blade seemed to have become several degrees taller right before their eyes.</p><p>His pace, neither slow nor fast, carried a suppressive air. It was unbearable for the five disciples. If he was slower, that would have given them the opportunity to discuss countermeasures. Yet they would have preferred it if he was quicker. It would be much better to die and reincarnate quickly.</p><p>“My esteemed subjects, your disciples still lack experience. They’ve completely lost their composure under Killing Blade’s pressure.” The aged Emperor rubbed the puffy bags under his eyes as he smiled at the high official, Song Shouren, and the other ministers.</p><p>The five young masters were the top disciples of the Song family of Luyang and the Zhang family of Longnan.</p><p>“They were born relatively late into the year and the highest cultivation among them is merely Eight Apertures. It’s inevitable that they’ll fear Killing Blade who is sure to make a breakthrough at any time.” Song Shouren smoothened his beard with his hand, exuding the unmistakable grace of one from an aristocratic family.</p><p>“Born comparatively late…” The aged Emperor smiled, not continuing the rest of his words. The five disciples appeared to be one or two years older than Su Ziyuan, not the other way around.</p><p>Zhang Yuanli, the legitimate son of the Zhang family of Longnan, came from a scholarly family. All emotions vanished from his expression as he said in a quiet voice, “There are at least five of us and it’s narrow here. It’ll be hard for him to dodge and weave around us. We might not lose if we go up against him full-force. Even if we can’t win, we can at least find a chance to run. It’s better than being hunted!”</p><p>Song Quanlue of the Song family nodded. “Senior Brother, your Grand Sun Sky-burning Palm is great. My Houtu Life-and-death Swordsmanship isn’t weak either. So are all of you, my brothers. Let’s give him a worthy challenge and look out for an opportunity.”</p><p>Just as the five of them steeled their determinations and saw a rise in their momentum, bright laughter came from Meng Qi. He accelerated his pace and his steps became as heavy as an elephant’s, shaking the ground each time his foot landed. In a flash, the momentum of the disciples faded.</p><p>Song Quanlue took in a deep breath, pointed his sword and drew the outline of upright, unafraid plum blossoms that were brimming with vitality. His killing intent was hidden somewhere deep inside, appearing entirely inconspicuous.</p><p>Zhang Yuanli and the others separated in a practiced fashion. One brandished a palm akin to the Grand Sun, the other brandished a sword akin to the heaven. Both targeted the vital parts of Meng Qi’s body.</p><p>“Clang!” Meng Qi unsheathed his saber and lifted it high up, before slashing downward with a terrifying force.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>Under the force of such a terrifying slash, Song Quanlue was unable to unleash the changes in his sword art. Like an embroidery needle coming across a rumble roller, all the exquisite layers of movements were all blocked. He had no time to unleash the rest of his techniques before the sword and saber met.</p><p>He felt the skin between his thumb and forefinger split open and his sword flew out of his hand.</p><p>A thought crossed his mind at that moment, something his elders had once said: <em>“One’s true sword technique relies not on his sword, but on his practice…”</em></p><p>Meng Qi slashed Song Quanlue’s sword in one stroke and twisted his body with a kick of his heel. His saber, like a growing dragon, cut in the direction of Zhang Yuanli and the others.</p><p>“Clang, clang, clang, clang!” Each strike landed on Meng Qi but the pale golden glow remained untouched without dissipating.</p><p>The saber cut at an angle as if it was a long stick, sweeping them away with terrifyingly dreadful strength.</p><p>Several flashes of light later, the five disciples disappeared one after another. They were whisked away by their family elders.</p><p>Meng Qi ended the battle in just a couple of minutes, moving so quickly that the ministers did not even have the time to comment on anything.</p><p>“You know the disparity in your strengths…” Song Shouren stared at a shamed Song Quanlue with a stern expression.</p><p>Song Quanlue hung his head low with his face flushed red, unable to lift his head.</p><p>The other spectators exhaled sharply. It was likely that Killing Blade did not even use half of his strength in dealing with those disciples.</p><p>Meng Qi stepped out of the canyon, carrying his saber. He saw someone walking out of the wilderness towards him. It was Aunt Bai.</p><p>“Haha! Rather than arriving early, it’s far wiser to arrive opportunely.” Her breath surged. Her desolate and barbaric air was like that of high mountains and ridges. It was as if she was a terrifying and vicious beast.</p><p>Meng Qi narrowed his eyes and felt something heavy weighing on his body as if the ground was binding him. His every movement required more strength than he was used to.</p><p>He had planned on first evading Aunt Bai and those on her level, clearing away the miscellaneous participants, and meeting up with Ruan Yushu and the others before they were defeated. That way, he would have at least 70 to 80 percent odds of success. However, life never follows one’s expectations.</p><p>“To think I’d meet him so soon…” Zhang Yuanli calmed his emotions and began to observe the battles inside the dreamland. Excitement colored his expression when he saw that Killing Blade had encountered Aunt Bai.</p><p>Even though Killing Blade was the top fighter of the Ranking List of Young Masters, he could not be discussed along the same lines as Aunt Bai.</p><p>Would Killing Blade be eliminated right in the beginning?</p><p>This particular encounter had captured the attention of most of the spectators. Compared to other scuffles happening in the dreamland, the collision between masters was evidently more interesting.</p><p>Aunt Bai laughed heartily. “I’ve long wanted to battle you once again!”</p><p>She charged at him, throwing him a straight punch with a heavy, frightening fist. She was so strong that her force seemed capable of shattering mountain peaks. That feeling of oppression and of near collapse made Meng Qi feel short of breath.</p><p>What was even more frightening was that, behind her, the ground was like a large cage that encompassed everything. It was beyond difficult to execute any Body Movements or changes or even speed up. It was as if he could only meet her at her strength and confront her head-on!</p><p>“Then let’s fight!” Meng Qi roared, his tongue bursting open with spring thunder. Following this tremor, he broke away from his binds and unleashed his simple and unadorned bladesmanship. However, every strike was heavier than the one before as if there was muffled thunder on the horizon slowly descending on the ground.</p><p>He had chosen to confront Aunt Bai head-on. His muscles knotted and swelled underneath his clothing as if he had become a beast wrapped in human skin.</p><p>“Clank, clank, clank!” The jangling sounds rang nonstop. The muffled sounds agitated even the disciples of aristocratic families in hiding, sending them running pathetically.</p><p>And yet, stunningly, Meng Qi managed to resist Aunt Bai’s attack without being forced to take a step back. His strength seemed on par with hers!</p><p>“Since when could the top fighter of the Ranking List of Young Masters contend with a Half-step Exterior Scenery master promoted from the realm of Oneness of Heaven and Men…” Song Quanlue watched with his mouth open, dumbstruck.</p><p>In his eyes, Meng Qi had become a monster clad in human flesh.</p><p>Song Shouren cast him a glance and said dully, “It’s not that he doesn’t want to roam and avoid the brunt of her attack. She had drawn the strength of the earth to bind him, preventing him from making any Body Movements. He can only fight her, hand to hand.”</p><p>“But… But his force…” That was the point that Song Quanlue could not accept the most.</p><p>Song Shouren’s eyes were brimming with cruelty. “His cultivation method is based on strength. The current strength of his strike is on par with that of an ordinary Half-step. He isn’t far beneath Aunt Bai. Furthermore, after entering the Oneness of Heaven and Men realm, he can borrow some of the Nature Force.”</p><p>He paused and said, “More importantly, each of his strikes targets her weakest points. What he lacks in strength, he makes up in other aspects. He appears not to be at a disadvantage at all. This is the advantage of the realm of his movements over hers.”</p><p>“Of course, based on Aunt Bai’s realm and strength, her ferocity will only rise even higher as the battle progresses, while Killing Blade will be bound even tighter. The outcome of the battle will gradually be visible.”</p><p>Once he understood this, Song Quanlue once again returned his attention to the fight and focused wholeheartedly on the moments Meng Qi thrust his saber.</p><p>He saw that each of Meng Qi’s strikes, though flat and straight, were in accordance to Dharma and Logos. It gave rise to bolts of thunder sending tremors across the void, hitting Aunt Bai right on the side of her fist. If not for the fact that she was wearing a Precious Weapon glove, Meng Qi might have succeeded!</p><p>The cultivation methods passed down throughout generations in the Song family were the Houtu Life-and-death Sword and the Benevolence Saber. So, Song Quanlue was quite familiar with bladesmanship. The more he watched the battle, the more disturbed he felt. It was as if he was watching a family elder demonstrating his bladesmanship and he slowly became engrossed in it.</p><p>“Bang, bang bang!” The saber and fist collided with a horrifying force.</p><p>Aunt Bai’s feet remained unwaveringly rooted to the ground with little movement. On the other hand, Meng Qi was executing multiple changes.</p><p>She abruptly too a deep a breath and held a fist before her chest to block his attack. It felt as if the mountain had moved with her. Her force did not appear weakened in the slightest with the shift.</p><p>Meng Qi’s saber traveled in an arc across the horizon, using the void to contain the might of his momentum.</p><p>“Pfft!” Under their oppressive breaths, the saber and the fist appeared locked together. Subsequently, both their attacks produced the whizzing of gales that drifted far and wide, disturbing their respective Qi pivots.</p><p>Aunt Bai and Meng Qi looked to be in deep thought and dashed in retreat at the same time, both in different directions. They stopped fighting.</p><p>They knew now, after exchanging blows, that it would take them a long time to determine a victor between them. If their comrades were defeated, they would be in immense danger. Thus, they separated and decided to first meet up with their respective teams.</p><p>Those watching from outside the dreamland sighed in disappointment.</p><p>While Meng Qi was running, he saw layers of mist enveloping him and the sky began darkening above his head.</p><p>He unleashed his Will-projecting and put up his guard against sneak attacks by constantly drawing feedback from his surroundings.</p><p>Just then, he could sense a potent murderous intent!</p><p>It did not originate from a spar-like hostility; rather, it was a true desire to murder!</p><p>Outside the dreamland, the audience had shifted their attention somewhere else once they saw Killing Blade disappear inside the mist.</p><p>The aged Emperor leaned into his seat, his expression as calm as ever as he stared at the sky.</p><p>…</p><p>Changle, North Zhou Dynasty.</p><p>Inside a horse carriage, Gao Lan was holding a cup of fine wine and looking at the gleaming light reflected on the waves on the surface of the lake.</p><p>“Who is that invited me here, I wonder? Why do you have her belongings?” His expression was cold and his gaze disdainful.</p><p>Right at that moment, a figure walked out of from the woods surrounding the lake with a temperament as graceful as an immortal. With a white muslin covering the figure’s face, it was hard to get a good look at her.</p><p>Something shifted in Gao Lan’s eyes, appearing somewhat agitated. “You didn’t die?”</p><p>Without getting up or taking a step, he was in front of the veiled woman in the next instant.</p><p>The veiled woman exuded a carefree demeanor. In a quiet voice, she said, “I came due to fate and will leave for the same reason. It’s true that <em>she</em> has died.”</p><p>Gao Lan’s expression became incredibly downcast before reassuming his unfeeling mask. Sneering, he replied, “To think the principal disciple of Shui Yue Nunnery would be Mystic Fairy, Nirmanakaya.”</p><p>Mystic Fairy turned her head and began strolling by the river. “The roots of Mystic Fairy’s relationship with the various influences of the medieval times have never been shallow. It’s not the evil spirit.”</p><p>Gao Lan stared deeply at her without speaking. He walked up next to her, shoulder-to-shoulder.</p><p>The two of them fell into a peaceful silence and, without either of them realizing it, made a complete walk around the lake.</p><p>Feigning nonchalance, she asked, “Where’s your Saint Emperor’s Token?”</p><p>“I’ve given it to Disillusionment Demon when he came to exchange for it. It was useless in my hands anyway,” he replied. Recalling what had happened, he could not help sneering. “Now that I think about it, I still need to thank him. If not for the item, how is it possible for me to secretly confirm my path and escape such trappings.”</p><p>“Merely possessing the Saint Emperor’s Token alone isn’t enough to condense it in secret…” Mystic Fairy said, staring at the lake.</p><p>Gao Lan snorted and his tone became incredibly cold. “I still have her remnants. Disillusionment Demon didn’t ask and I deliberately didn’t mention it either.”</p><p>She said nothing and Gao Lan became silent as well. The two of them continued their walk, making yet another round around the lake before going their separate ways. Neither of them turned their heads.</p><p>…</p><p>Inside the palace.</p><p>Zhao Wuyan was grasping a token entirely embedded with precious stones on its front. His entire body exuded a mysterious dark golden glow that was constantly shifting; his breath was terrifyingly fearsome.</p><p>Outside his door, Purple Roc Arrester Liu Shengming quietly stood up. He watched what was going on inside momentarily before turning around to walk to Tai Chi Palace.</p><p>When he reached out his hands to push the doors to the palace open, he saw heavenly throne coiled with nine dragons as well as a withered, thin old man holding up a bluish-white lamp next to it.</p><p>However, what caught his eye immediately was a young woman dressed in white sitting on the throne.</p><p>She exuded a pure and holy air. Her appearance was delicate and perfect. Her hands, as fair as jade, were placed on top of the golden yellow armrests of the throne as she leaned back. Her expression was dignified as her entire person burst with might.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
