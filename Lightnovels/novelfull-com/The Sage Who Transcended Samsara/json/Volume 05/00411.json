Stepping off the junk, he then took a small boat over to the riverbank, with Wang Zai sensibly keeping quiet. Only after reaching the riverbank did he sincerely express his thanks. “Thank you for helping me out, Brother Su.”</p><p>“It was nothing.” Meng Qi had regained his composure.</p><p>“Brother Su, do you really have a serious matter to attend to? Do you require any assistance?” Wang Zai felt like he should do something in return for the favor.</p><p>Meng Qi shook his head. He did not want Wang Zai to get involved with “The Myths”. “That was just an excuse. I intend to go to the sword pavilion for a while, and then I’ll return to Happycloud Heights to train.”</p><p>Wang Zai nodded. “Then I shall bid you farewell first.”</p><p>They went their separate ways, and Meng Qi hurried along Tianxiu River towards the sword pavilion. After traveling a certain distance, he suddenly stopped to stare at the middle of the river.</p><p>It was the part of the river that was furthest from the busiest area, so there were fewer junks around. The undulating waves could be seen at a glance, and in the middle of their watery grace was a small boat flowing with the current. On it sat a master in a green robe with a large jug of wine in front of him. He was admiring the moon as he savored his wine.</p><p>The man looked about 20 years old and had above-average features. He was elegant and refined and had a carefree attitude, downing the wine like it was water and tapping to some beat while singing from time to time. The few strands of white on his head gave him a slightly world-weary vibe, while his actions were unconstrained and bore natural grace. He resembled a green lotus that was slowly blooming between heaven and earth.</p><p>Although they were unacquainted, Meng Qi could still guess who the man was. He had been planning to challenge him in Ying City, but because of all the turns of events, he had gone to the Party of Happycloud first.</p><p>It was “Master Lotus” Liu Su, the heir of Huanhua Swords Sect!</p><p>Turning his head away, Meng Qi decided that it would be better to hurry over to the sword pavilion first.</p><p>“Hello there, my friend. Since we happened to meet in Regions to the left of Yangtze River , why not come and have a drink with me?” Right at that moment, Liu Su called out to him, slightly drunk. He had noticed Meng Qi’s stares and sensed his presence, and was instantly aware that he was no ordinary fellow.</p><p>Meng Qi contemplated for a moment and decided that he could take the opportunity to ask if Senior Brother Qi had found the local Manager of Huanhua Swords Sect and warn him about Old Zhong as well. Thus, he laughed out loud and replied, “Master Lotus’ wine must be of a good brew. How could I possibly give it a miss?”</p><p>He snapped off two dried twigs from the tree next to him and leaped up. Flying like a bird across the water surface, he gracefully crossed the river.</p><p>The Tianxiu River was considerably wide, and the small boat was in the middle of the river. Meng Qi had barely crossed half the distance when he began to feel the weight of gravity.</p><p>As the reflected moonlight rippled in the water, he tossed one of the twigs out. It floated in the water and Meng Qi stepped on it, propelling himself into the air again. After another step, he landed in front of Liu Su with a whoosh and sat himself down at the other end of the boat.</p><p>Next to the jug of wine was a clean, empty bowl. It was as if Liu Su had been prepared in advance.</p><p>“Do you perhaps have another guest?” Meng Qi felt that there was no way Liu Su had been specifically waiting for him.</p><p>Liu Su slapped the wine jug and a stream of wine spurted out of the jug and into the empty bowl, filling it right to the brim. It was not a drop more or less. His impressive control left even Meng Qi amazed.</p><p>“I brought wine here because I was supposed to compete with someone, but he never arrived, and so I ended up alone. Thankfully I met you.” Liu Su picked up his bowl and said in a refined yet carefree manner. “Even though we don’t know each other, we’ll be drinking buddies after we’re done.”</p><p>Meng Qi picked up the bowl and the wine fragrance immediately hit him. The wine was light blue in color, a clear indication that it definitely held an extraordinary flavor. “I am Su Meng.”</p><p>The two of them clinked their bowls together and downed the wine in one shot. Meng Qi felt the liquid turn into a stream of fire as it flowed down his throat and into his stomach. The aroma spread out as he was enveloped in warmth, and a mellow sweetness lingered in his mouth. “Excellent wine!”</p><p>“This is Louwailou’s Misty Rain Brew. This particular jug is almost 30 years old. I had to be shameless in order to get my hands on it.” Liu Su smiled, pleased. He appeared happier that his wine had been praised, compared to if he himself had received compliments.</p><p>Meng Qi hit the wine jug as well and caused the wine to spurt into the air. It split into two and fell into each of their bowls, filling them right to the brim with not a drop more or less either.</p><p>His level of control was on par with Liu Su’s!</p><p>Liu Su chuckled, “I heard Junior Brother Qi mention that you previously wanted to spar with me?”</p><p>“Yes. Is Senior Brother Qi also in Ying City?” Meng Qi asked for the sake of asking.</p><p>Liu Su patted the side of the boat. “He is. If the Party of Happycloud weren’t coming soon, we could each bring ten jugs of wine and slowly savor them while discussing martial arts.”</p><p>“We’ll surely get the chance to do that in future.” Meng Qi paused a little and then added, “Please help me notify Senior Brother Qi that Old Zhong, who harbors ill intent towards him, has appeared in Ying City.”</p><p>Liu Su nodded. He did not probe further, and raised his bowl to continue drinking with Meng Qi.</p><p>After his third bowl in a row, Meng Qi intentionally activated his inner force a little and asked in a slightly tipsy manner, “I wonder who it was you were supposed to meet?”</p><p>Someone who could arrange to meet Master Lotus was definitely not the average joe. Since the undercurrents in Ying City were currently very tumultuous, Meng Qi decided to poke his nose a little further into the matter.</p><p>Liu Su gazed at the heart of the river and sighed. “‘Master Thief’ Sikong Tu.”</p><p>“Master Thief?” Meng Qi was not unfamiliar with that name, for he was a famous character in Six Fan School’s documents detailing wanted fugitives. Master Thief had made a name for himself for many years already. He was on the level of Half-step Exterior Scenery, and was adept at Lightness Skill Body Movements, hiding his tracks, and the art of deception. He had also robbed countless people and dug up numerous graves, causing the families of the poor victims to be grinding their teeth in hatred for him.</p><p>“When I was roaming River East before, I ran into Sikong once and tried to take him down, but didn’t have enough strength to do so and we ended up sharing the gains. He likes wine as well, so we often bet on wine when we meet to compete. If I win, he’ll give up being a criminal, while if he wins, I’ll have to do something for him that doesn’t go against our sect rules. Until now, we have battled five times, and each time has ended in a draw.” Liu Su drank another bowl of wine as he recalled the past. “Sikong previously arranged to meet me for a fight today, but he has yet to appear. Perhaps he’s being held up by some other matters.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded. “Master Thief” was in Ying City as well! It really was a place where one could bump into a master anytime.</p><p>After drinking seven or eight bowls of wine with Liu Su, Meng Qi was in a rush to go to the sword pavilion and thus stood up to bid Liu Su farewell. He scrutinized the boat for any objects he could use as stepping stones on his way back to the riverbank.</p><p>“There’s no need for that. I’ll give you a ride.” Liu Su pulled out his long sword, mildly intoxicated. His expression was full of sacredness as he recited in a loud and clear voice,</p><p>“A magnificent waterfall gushes down from high above…”</p><p>With a swing of his long sword, the river suddenly roared and a huge wave swelled. It turned and pushed the small boat to the side of the river. It was a brilliant use of force, and a clever way of borrowing momentum, making one believe that Liu Su was capable of using the power of heaven and earth.</p><p>Liu Su saw Meng Qi off in a simple manner. He then turned around and patted his boat as it sailed towards the center of the river once more. All the while, the man loudly recited, “A pot of wine among the flowers, and I enjoy the wine on my own…”</p><p>Meng Qi turned to gaze at the man and sighed. Those who had achieved Oneness of Heaven and Men all had their own kinds of imposing manners.</p><p>Upon arriving at the sword pavilion, Meng Qi informed the people there of his purpose and received many scrutinizing stares before he finally met Jiang Zhiwei and told her about the matter concerning Old Zhong from start to finish.</p><p>He did not bother hiding the details in between, because he knew that Mi Zijing and Bai Wenyuan would definitely spread the word.</p><p>It took Jiang Zhiwei a tremendous amount of effort to hold back her laughter. She nodded and replied, “I’ll be careful. By the way, our Master Hong has arrived in Ying City.”</p><p>Meng Qi could finally heave a sigh of relief. Sword Washing Pavilion’s “Star-breaking Sword” Hong Qian was an Exterior-level master whose skills lived up to his name, and he was also Su Wuming’s Senior Brother.</p><p>After leaving the sword pavilion, Meng Qi walked along Tianxiu River, with the intent of returning to Happycloud Heights.</p><p>As he was walking, he suddenly spotted Moon-Embroidering Pavilion’s junk.</p><p>“It actually sailed all the way here?” Meng Qi was somewhat surprised. They were near Lake Yue and Misty Rain Mountain. Very few junks sailed all the way there.</p><p>The junk was resting against the riverbank. Its lights were dim and there seemed to be few customers around, either that or they were all in deep slumber.</p><p>Meng Qi felt something out of the blue, and swiftly ducked behind a tree.</p><p>He looked over and saw one of the windows open and a man in black robes jump out. Then Mi Zijing appeared and shut the window. His face was full of seriousness, completely unlike his unrestrained character from before.</p><p>The man in black had a symbolic red nose indicative of rosacea, and he appeared to be terrified of being followed. He consecutively changed his figure several times and slowly disappeared into the darkness.</p><p>Meng Qi could feel that there was someone trying to chase after that man in black.</p><p>Meng Qi did not do anything. He had no desire to get caught up in other people’s issues since he already had plenty of troubles of his own. Mi Zijing was acting so mysteriously that he probably had something to do with Prince Jin Zhao Yi.</p><p>Soundlessly, Meng Qi crossed the place and directly returned to Happycloud Heights, where he meditated and tried to understand moves.</p><p>…</p><p>At the break of dawn, the first ray of sunlight filtered into the small compound where Meng Qi lived.</p><p>Meng Qi immediately woke up. He felt that the weather was good, the air was fresh, and he was in a good mood. Everything that had happened the day before seemed like a fleeting experience.</p><p>That enabled him to clearly think, and he was suddenly struck by this inspiration,</p><p>“Since ‘Blessing-endowed Heavenly Official’ didn’t manage to kill Senior Brother Qi, how would ‘The Myths’ not think of him informing me about it?”</p><p>“I’ve already met Zhiwei, so the news must’ve traveled to Sword Washing Pavilion as well…”</p><p>“Sword Washing Pavilion’s Master Hong has come to Ying City. Based on Liu Su’s attitude, the masters from Huanhua Swords Sect will probably come as well…”</p><p>“‘The Myths’ is really coming after me?”</p><p>As he thought about it, his eyes began to narrow. <em>“The Myths had failed to silence Senior Brother Qi and their attempt had been exposed. They were doing it purely for the sake of venting their anger, so will they really continue doing so despite the immense risk?”</em></p><p><em>“If it were me, I would lie low for the while and find another opportunity to strike since it is not any pressing matter anyway.”</em></p><p>“But Old Zhong has still appeared in Ying City…”</p><p>“Is he just hiding here, or does ‘The Myths’ have some other plans?”</p><p>In the midst of his frustration, a servant from Happycloud Heights arrived. He had come to deliver a letter that had apparently been sent from a child nearby.</p><p>Doubtful, Meng Qi inspected the letter once over before opening it. Inscribed on a piece of paper in delicate and beautiful calligraphy was,</p><p>“20 miles North of the city, at the burial valley of Dragon-coiling Mountain, the Skyscraping Devil’s tracks have been discovered.”</p><p><em>“A letter from Gu</em> Xiaosang <em>? On the whereabouts of Old Zhong?”</em> Meng Qi’s grip on the letter involuntarily tightened.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
