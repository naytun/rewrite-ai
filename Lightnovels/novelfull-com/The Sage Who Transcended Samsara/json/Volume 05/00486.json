The charms on it were intertwined and it glowed brightly with Heaven Dao.</p><p>Illuminated with colorful flames, it reached Meng Qi’s back at frightening speed.</p><p>Pa!</p><p>With a melodious ringing Meng Qi’s Protective Upstanding Qi was penetrated, as if through a thin paper screen, leaving a gaping hole in his back. The nail passed through his heart, coming out stained red and setting his body on fire from inside out. It was locked onto his Vital Spirit, which meant that it now held his life on thin balance.</p><p>His physical body suddenly exploded, turning his flesh and blood into airflows which took the flames away and bent the nail.</p><p>Meng Qi reappeared a foot away, ashes fluttering from his chest. The Disaster-avoiding Charm he had obtained at dusk was broken.</p><p>Crack! The nail disintegrated after missing its target.</p><p>“A Heart-drilling Nail…” Meng Qi’s eyes sharpened, knowing who had snuck an attack on him.</p><p>It was that bastard, Thunder God From the Ninth Heaven.</p><p>Without the Disaster-avoiding Charm, he would have died, even though the Heart-drilling Nail was of a higher power level. But thanks to his cultivation of Eight Nine Mysteries, he had avoided sever injury.</p><p><em>Seems that he wants me dead badly…</em> Meng Qi added him to his hit list. It was no longer a matter of vengeance. Even if he gave up on revenge now, that bastard would never let him live.</p><p>As he thought of this, the Purple Thunder roared in midair with the golden light shining. The Grand Formation of Luoyang was being activated.</p><p>“Ruthless!” Meng Qi’s pupils constricted, now that he knew the Thunder God From the Ninth Heaven’s motive.</p><p>The moment he activated the formation, he would escape, leaving the others no chance to flee. As long as the Six Fan School of Luoyang and the Exterior masters from the aristocratic families were still here, the Luo Denomination and The Immortals would all be slaughtered.</p><p>They had all been so focused on the details that they failed to see the larger threat they were facing. His maliciousness was truly beyond words.</p><p>No wonder he had been laying low for the last few days. This was the rare chance he had been waiting for.</p><p>If things went smoothly, The Immortals would lose its strong members which would be advantageous to The Myths. Besides, the Luo Denomination had a history with the Method of Mistress Su, for Gu Xiaosang had killed the Successor of Mystic Fairy. Thus, the Thunder God From the Ninth Heaven would be killing two birds with the same stone.</p><p>As the Purple Thunder shot skyward, clouds convened in mid-air 330 meters from the ground. A golden light shone from the center, like the halo behind Buddha’s head.</p><p>Inside Red Attire Villa, Sima Shi sat with his eyes closed in the company of Prince Qi, Zhao Wuyan.</p><p>The golden light suddenly condensed into a curtain in front of him, flickering with chaotic colours. When he opened his eyes, he clenched his right hand and punched the water curtain.</p><p>As the water screen rippled, his fist sank in it.</p><p>As the golden light rippled over in the dense forests, a giant fist descended from the sky.</p><p>The five fingers were powerful, as pearly white as jade and profoundly enigmatic. They entwined with the light, making the sky overcast, as if the world had returned to its primordial state.</p><p>Whatever it hit dissolved silently. Stones disintegrated and the dirt vaporized. Its target was the strongest of them all, Progenitor Doumu.</p><p>The Progenitor Doumu turned the hand that had pounced on Gu Xiaosang earlier in a strange angle to meet with the fist. She induced all her aperture acupoints. Stars glimmered in the sky one after another, running in an interconnected trajectory. It was a beautiful sight to behold.</p><p>With the entire universe around her, she seemed to be the center of it, the Mother of Stars. As she moved, the starry sky swelled with gleaming points.</p><p>It was the Dharma Form of Doumu.</p><p>Since it was already happening, she had to use all her strength to escape.</p><p>As stars streaked across the sky, it became preternaturally night. Those wonderous light trajectories spiralled into her right palm.</p><p>Thud!</p><p>The blast wave spread, blowing Gu Xiaosang and the other Exterior masters away. Even if Meng Qi hadborrowed its force to fly backward, he would not have escaped unscathed. As his faint golden glow wavered, he spat blood.</p><p>When the stars blinked out, a hole more than 10-yards deep appeared in the ground. Groundwater gushed to fill in it.</p><p>Thanks to the Grand Formation of Luoyang and the concentration of their attacks, the city remained intact after the strike, as did the masters under the Exterior realm.</p><p>The fist was enveloped by the palm made of stars. The Progenitor Doumu turned around, attempting to free herself and disappear.</p><p>Hng! An ancient voice echoed as another hand fell down from the sky. Surrounded by Nine Golden Dragons, it transformed into a net, pouncing on her.</p><p>Taking advantage of the aftershock, Gu Xiaosang and other Exterior masters made their ways to escape from different directions. They couldn’t just wait for Sima Shi, Zhao Wuyan, and Super Arresters to kill them.</p><p>Having landed right in the center of the battle, Meng Qi saw Gu Xiaosang galloping toward him. Immediately, his pupils constricted, and suppressing pain, he thrust his saber out to defend himself.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang sucked in her breath and changed direction, rushing into the woods without a trace. With a chuckle, she said,</p><p>“Husband, don’t you want me to go?”</p><p>“After I’m done here, we’ll be together forever.”</p><p>Her voice as clear and sweet as a bell, seemingly joyful at evading death, almost pleasantly relaxed.</p><p>“She is so relaxed…” Meng Qi frowned; he could not understand her thoughts.</p><p>As the Progenitor Doumu grappled with Sima Shi, the Lord of Purity and Magic stopped attacking the master of the Yu family and his driver. The wind changed, and he gathered his Vital Qi, growing in size, as high as 10 feet, as though he standing between heaven and earth. His four arms each held tri-point double-edged swords and a long stick respectively and he, whose strength could topple mountains and channel oceans, hit Nine Golden Dragons.</p><p>The master and driver chose to flee the battle scene instead of attacking again. They chose different escape techniques, running in different directions.</p><p>Bang! The swords and stick struck the dragons, sending the sparks flying. The sky darkened, as if it were falling.</p><p>The palm slightly sprang forward, forcing them to move back. Instantly, the dim golden light emanated from the Lord of Purity and Magic, as if numbing.</p><p>Because of the huge difference in strength, he found it difficult to counter Zhao Wuyan’s strike, even though he displayed the Law Phenomenon to give himself one head and two arms.</p><p>As faint as the Nine Golden Dragons, they made a mesh with the palm to envelop Doumu, preventing her escape. In a while, the grand formation would be completely activated, and then she would reach the end of her rope.</p><p>Now that the Progenitor Doumu was being simultaneously assaulted by Sima Shi and Zhao Wuyan, she was in grave danger.</p><p>Her enemies chose to remove the biggest threat together.</p><p>At that moment, Progenitor Doumu touched the ancient crown on her head, and a ray of scorching, sunglow burst forth to engulf Sima Shi’s fist.</p><p>Inside Red Attire Villa, the sunglow overwhelmed the golden light, rushing to Sima Shi.</p><p>The chaotic light around Sima Shi battled the sunglow whereas Zhao Wuyan’s mesh still shrouded her.</p><p>As she ground her teeth, an item appeared in her hand. It was the half of the Saint Emperor’s Token decorated with diamonds that she always carried with her in case of emergencies.</p><p>She threw it at the master of the Yu family. Zhao Wuyan hesitated before stretching his left hand out to alter its trajectory.</p><p>With Zhao Wuyan distracted, his strength on his right hand wavered. She swirled the stars around her backward into a spiral and punched his hand.</p><p>Boom! The Nine Golden Dragons exploded into a fine rain, and Zhao Wuyan’s right hand was pushed back.</p><p>Progenitor Doumu instantly flew into the sky.</p><p>Now, Sima Shi successfully resisted the sunglow and stuck his left hand out of the clouds and grabbed her clothing with one finger.</p><p>His finger was the encapsulation of all change, like befalling chaos. If it were to hit someone, it would be their demise.</p><p>A handful of loose red sand appeared out of nowhere suddenly struck Sima Shi’s left hand.</p><p>Meng Qi had seen it coming. After all, not all members of The Immortals had showed up, and of those that were, Primogenitor Guangcheng was not here.</p><p>Instead of avoiding them, Sima Shi just let himself be hit. Even though it was no longer pure white but revealing flesh and blood, his finger remained unwavering.</p><p>Worse still, yellow dragons condensed again in the clouds.</p><p>As the Progenitor Doumu gritted her teeth and she stuck her left hand out to meet the finger head-on. Meanwhile, she was still struggling to escape.</p><p>Silently, the sky seemed to fold into itself. With a pained moan, the Progenitor Doumu borrowed the force to disappear into the darkness.</p><p>Since the latter part of the battle had happened in midair, and the formation was almost fully activated, the ground’s surface was not severely affected. Meng Qi and the others were struggling to sustain themselves and could do nothing but watch helplessly as the woods turn to wasteland.</p><p>As the Progenitor Doumu attempted to escape, the Lord of Purity and Magic was neglected. He made consecutive changes, transforming into a fish, and escaping his chains to disappear.</p><p>As Zhao Wuyan held the Saint Emperor’s Token, Super Arresters finally arrived in their formation.</p><p>Su Yue was the first one to arrive. He was furious, his eyes glinting with golden light. He couldn’t believe what had happened.</p><p>This place was not near to the Su family mansion, and the participants had tried their best to muffle their sound, so he had no idea what had truly happened here.</p><p>Liu Shengming, Ke Yuzhang, and another two Super Arresters were already there. One looked young with a majestic aura. He had strapped a long sword to his back and a four-clawed dragon on his waist. The other was tall with black and white hair. He had hung a medium-long saber and a red tooth on his waist.</p><p>They were Soaring Dragon Arrester and Blood Teeth Arrester of the Eight Distinguished Super Arresters. The former was Zhao Mingche, a grandmaster of the Zhao family while the latter was Yuan Lihuo, a Six-fold Heaven Peerless Master Pro.</p><p>Thanks to Sumptuous Fruits Banquet, there were as few as three Super Arresters patrolling the area.</p><p>“They’re the members of The Immortals and the Luo Denomination. Go after them.” Sima Shi ordered. “The Su’s must return immediately and wait to be interrogated.”</p><p>Su Yue quietly led Meng Qi, Su Zihua, and the now awakened Su Ziyue home. On the way he asked, “What happened?”</p><p>Meng Qi told him the truth. “The Yu family is the Luo Denomination’s disguise. The Immortals found out somehow and came to snatch the token.”</p><p>“Did you lend a hand?” asked Su Yue.</p><p>“Yes. The Demoness of Grand Luo showed up, and the situation became precarious. If I had not defended myself, I would probably have been silenced.” Meng Qi evaded suspicion of covertly assisting the Immortals.</p><p>When they went back, Old Lady Bai and Ke Weilan were already aware of what had happened, and their expressions were dark. Su Li was pacing back and off with his hands behind his back. He nodded upon seeing them, saying, “It’s me that’s to to blame for causing such. After so many generations, no one knew of the Yu family’s true colors, it’s fine to say that we didn’t either. Don’t be too worried and make sure to cooperate with the arresters later.”</p><p>Since he had his emotions tightly collected, Meng Qi couldn’t sense anything unusual about him. With the excuse of healing himself, he left for a quiet place.</p><p>He headed for the side yard after leaving the hall. The moment he caught a glimpse of something from the corner of his eye, his pupils constricted.</p><p>It was a hidden signal from The Immortals, meaning that someone was hidden in the yard and needed help.</p><p>Meng Qi expression did not change. As he walked by, he used his palm to wipe off the mark on the stone.</p><p>After dismissing his servants, he made sure that no one was observing him before furtively approaching the woodshed.</p><p>“Immortal-tracking Alley.” He said in a low voice before pushing the door open.</p><p>The door opened an a figure emerged from the darkness. She was tall and slim with long legs, black hair, and the mask of Progenitor Doumu on her face.</p><p>“I’m severely wounded,” she said flatly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
