Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei looked at each other while staying motionless. There were many similar tricks used to deceive reckless lads in Jianghu. If they went out, they would just be falling right into their rival’s trap.</p><p>However, His Eminence turned his head towards the big tree outside the City God Temple, speaking in a gentle tone, “My two friends have listened for a while on the tree. Please come to see me; otherwise, you’re too impolite.”</p><p>Surprised and confused, Lan Die followed suit, thinking, <em>“I’ve been alert, and I didn’t notice anyone stalking me. My strength is indeed worse than the His Eminence’s. Without the sacrifices of several of my powerful teammates, I would have failed the Death Task.”</em></p><p>As the so-called His Eminence had indeed spotted them, Meng Qi wiped his face with his hand to change his look. His body surface surged with a fiery flame, enveloping his face.</p><p>Magically, his clothes, hair, and skin underneath those static burning flames remained intact.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei took off her mustache secretly, making her face a mess.</p><p>“Please forgive us as the unwelcomed guests.” Meng Qi still hid within the canopy of the tree, condensed his voice, and carried his words into the yard by passing a long distance.</p><p>Meng Qi’s words didn’t leak out at all, as if they sounded beside the ears of His Eminence and Lan Die. If a powerful person between the yard and the tree didn’t pay his full attention, he wouldn’t overhear those words.</p><p><em>“How strong his control ability is…”</em> His Eminence and Lan Die were both astounded by Meng Qi’s strength.</p><p>Any master capable of releasing their genuine Qi could deliver their words. What was striking was that Meng Qi did not leak his words out in the 30-meter-long distance.</p><p>A Half-step Exterior Scenery master as he was, His Eminence could adopt many tricks to control Yin Lenghui who had gotten an abhiseca indoctrination. But, he was fully aware that he couldn’t easily send his message like that.</p><p>With eyes still closed while he kept moving his mouth, immediately causing buzzing sounds. Several wasp-like insects appeared in front the tree. They flapped their wings to deliver a message.</p><p>“In the starry night with a tint of chill, why not come down to talk with us?”</p><p>After a distance, his words came to Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei’s ears as they were clear and concise as well without any leakage.</p><p>“We want to have a spar with you, but we meet at a wrong place with an impropriate time. Thus, we’d better not see each other.” Jiang Zhiwei’s voice was as clear-cut as a long sword that was slightly roaring.</p><p>Meng Qi added with a loud chuckle, “Since you’re both powerful, we can’t get rid of you once we’re in a battle. We can’t wait for Left Governor Zuo and Yin Lengfeng to help you.”</p><p>Lan Die knew Book of the Chaos, so they had a deep history with Samsara travelers, even if they weren’t ones. Meng Qi still needed to be very cautious.</p><p>“In all honesty, I’m afraid we’re on the same side,” said His Eminence stood, using his hands. “This isn’t a group-rivaling task, so we don’t need to fight between us. Why don’t we talk frankly to work out a compromise? Is this acceptable?”</p><p>Because of the phenomenon where flames surrounded Meng Qi, he was semi-certain that Meng Qi was one of the Samsara travelers who could use Book of the Chaos and Heavenly Golden Scripture.</p><p>However, this was just a possibility, for he was not 100% sure of that. For the sake of caution, he didn’t mention Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms. If he sent such a fatal message to the wrong person, he would probably end up dead and end up a total joke in the World of Samsara.</p><p><em>“Are they truly Samsara travelers?”</em> Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei looked at each other, both wondering about those before them. They had to be Samsara travelers because they knew about group-rivaling task.</p><p>Samsung travelers kept Group-rivaling tasks amongst themselves, and they were misunderstandable to outsiders.</p><p>Knowing that they were about to speak, His Eminence continued, “To show my sincerity, I’ll tell you our mission. We are on an optional task to look for Du Huaishang, the Reincarnated Soul Boy of the Ancestor to awaken him. Thus, we can ignore others things that pertain to us.”</p><p>Having talked secretly with Jiang Zhiwei, Meng Qi said with a giggle, “Sadly, we’re missioned to help Du Huaishang out of danger, and it seems it’s impossible not to conflict.”</p><p>According to Wang Siyuan and Jiang Hengchuan, he would fall into a disadvantaged position where all of his actions would be plain to see if he exposed his real target. Therefore, he didn’t mention the assassination of Zuo Hanfeng. After all, they were rivals for the time being so that he couldn’t believe their words at once. Even if he couldn’t get what he wanted, those half-real words would mislead them.</p><p>“It’s okay as well. You protect Du Huaishang from getting hurt, but you can’t protect him indefinitely. When you accomplish your mission, we’ll then come to him to awaken the dormant reincarnated memories. We won’t hurt him. If we locate him before you, we’ll also leave him to you,” said the so-called His Eminence in a calm tone, as if everything to him could find a win-win solution. However, he mentioned nothing about signing a treaty.</p><p>Meng Qi said with a smile, “If that’s the case, we can use all our merits and resources to finish our task first. We’ll then talk about cooperation, weighing the prices either you or we pay to exchange him.”</p><p>“Alright.” His Eminence replied with a smile as well.</p><p>Before he could speak again, Meng Qi asked directly, “Experienced as I am, I’ve never encountered any of your teammates. Who is the Ancestor?”</p><p>The minute he thought of the things related to the reincarnation, his head ached.</p><p>“Humph, you’re so ignorant.” Lan Die snorted. “Haven’t you heard asking God to enter into one’s body?”</p><p>Since the Gu Poison Bug thing was quite common, she didn’t feel the need to mention them.</p><p>“It’s some possessed by God.” Meng Qi blinked slightly.</p><p>The His Eminence said with a smile, “There are many adventures in Samsara. You can use Heavenly Golden Scripture, and we can make our ways to communicate with the Ancestor. We’ll get many benefits after awakening him and helping him start his next life, so you don’t need to throw us an eerie look.”</p><p>Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms didn’t offer Heavenly Golden Scripture as a traded item, so he guessed that Meng Qi had obtained it from an adventure. After all, the Heavenly Primogenitor of The Immortals wasn’t widely spread knowledge.</p><p>“So, you’ve used his power to found a secret sect?” Jiang Zhiwei interrupted.</p><p>The His Eminence paused for a moment, and then he nodded and spoke, “Yes. The Ancestor has spoken highly of Yin Lengfeng and given him the Abhişeca. He has grown into an expert in Voodoo Skill from a nobody, so has Mu An. Sadly, the latter one became an inscetman.”</p><p>He paused for awhile and continued, “We’re not that close to knowing everything about each other. If our cooperation goes well, we’ll talk in details later.”</p><p>“Alright then.” As Meng Qi uttered the two words, a big fire broke out near the tree outside of the City God Temple, blocking their eyesight. After the fire went out, Lan Die found that they were gone.</p><p>“They’re very prudent.” His Eminence sighed. Nobody knew that he implied to how Meng Qi et al. left or that they refused a close-distance talk.</p><p>Lan Die pursed up her lips and asked with a cold but dainty face, “Isn’t awakening the reincarnated memories harmful to Du Huaishang?”</p><p>“I haven’t done that before, so how do I know?” He replied in an undertone.</p><p>“Then why did you say so just now?” Lan Die was a bit surprised. He appeared to be quite sincere trying to create an agreement of cooperation immediately.</p><p>The His Eminence said with a faint smile, “I failed to get their guard down, so I must mislead them. Do you think they were frank with us?”</p><p>He continued while exhaling, “I hope Yin Lengfeng can finish his job as quick as possible. Change of plan, though, I’ll always make my way to control them…”</p><p>Suddenly, he opened his eyes, in which the dark red was rolling, like the grisly sea. The roaring killing desire aroused in his heart.</p><p>…</p><p>To shake off all possible stalkers, Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei took a winding road and frequently changed their directions before entering into a hideout. They then disguised themselves again.</p><p>“They ought to be Samsara travelers of this world,” blurted Meng Qi.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei became as composed as before. “Why say so?”</p><p>“In most cases, if our missions are opposite, there should be a group-rivaling task.” Meng Qi expressed himself eloquently. “If not, one explanation is that like The Myths; they use Samsara Charm to enter this world and interfere with our task. The other one is that they are local Samsara travelers. Same as The Immortals and The Myths, they develop themselves in their main world, and they try to obtain more resources to exchange more Karma points.</p><p>It seems like to me that Yin Lengfeng and Mu An have been here for a long time, so they’re likely to be the local travelers on one condition that they can’t have so many Samsara Charms.”</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei gently nodded in agreement with Meng Qi. “It never occurs to me that there are Samsara travelers in another world, besides our world.”</p><p>“The Dominator can plunge us into another world, vice versa.” Meng Qi considered this phenomenon quite normal. “The so-called His Eminence and Lan Die are more nonentities than the ones blessed with demonic blood. Hence, he has endowed them a chance.”</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei frowned slightly. “Little monk, are you familiar with the scene in The His Eminence’s eyes?”</p><p>Meng Qi didn’t understand what Jiang Zhiwei saw. “I’m not acquainted with the red sea nor the barren hills and turbulent rivers.”</p><p>After some thoughts, Jiang Zhiwei said, “Some big sects would always offer some water mirrors for their disciples to recognize some places and people, in case that they should run into troubles as well as places that they should not travel to.”</p><p><em>“I’m expelled…”</em> Meng Qi felt a little embarrassed.</p><p>“The barren hills, turbulent rivers, bugs, and beasts are similar to those in the remote South.” Jiang Zhiwei wore a grave expression.</p><p>“Are you saying the Ancestor is in the remote South?” Meng Qi was taken aback and confused, wondering why the reality was connected to World of Samsara again.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei exhaled with a grave face. “The Ancestor appears to be Blood Sea Rakshasa…”</p><p>“Blood Sea Rakshasa?” Meng Qi was incredibly shocked.</p><p>Blood Sea Rakshasa, top 10 in Celestial Rankings, was the leader of the Blood-robed Cult.</p><p>He had claimed his Dharmakaya for a short time, and he had never come to Central Plains, so Meng Qi knew little about him.</p><p>“That’s just my guess.” Jiang Zhiwei was thoughtful, saying, “Perhaps, the relation between Samsara of Six Realms and the main world is closer than we thought.”</p><p>“Does Blood Sea Rakshasa need to reincarnate?” asked Meng Qi with a frown.</p><p>He was less than 100 years old, after all.</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei confusedly shook her head. “I don’t know.”</p><p>“Alright. Leave it alone. We should watch out for Lan Die et al. We try to mislead them and find a chance to assassinate Zuo Hanfeng.” Meng Qi looked up to guess what time it was right now. “By the way, is there something on your mind?”</p><p>Jiang Zhiwei gently bit her teeth and said, “Nothing important. I’m just a bit embarrassed after making a decision. I’ll tell you guys after the mission.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
