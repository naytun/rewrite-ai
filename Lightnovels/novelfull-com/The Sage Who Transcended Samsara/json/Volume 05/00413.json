I’d only know if I can agree to it once I hear your request.” Meng Qi spoke calmly, compassion filling his eyes.</p><p>It wasn’t that he felt sympathy for Sitong Ku. He was merely lamenting his fate. Sitong Ku was a capable Half-step Exterior Scenery master who was able to end his five fights with Young Master Lotus with a draw each time. He was gifted in the art of concealment and deception, Body Movement techniques and Lightness Skills, disguise as well as usage of concealed weapons. He was incredibly tenacious and remained at large despite his repeated crimes.</p><p>Yet, such a person had been reduced to such a pitiful state due to the havoc he had wrought. One was truly helpless against the currents of the perilous Jianghu.</p><p>For Meng Qi, he had no choice. He was swept into the World of Samsara and was forced to brave the Jianghu. He had to strengthen himself through various trials or he would just be a sitting duck in his Samsara tasks. His only goal, at least for now, was to become stronger and then go all out! That was the only way he would have a chance at reviving Senior Brother Zhang and the rest and have the hope of unraveling the secrets of the World of the Six Samsara and liberate themselves.</p><p>Of course, if not for the Party of Happycloud piquing his interest, he would have chosen a quiet location and train in peace for six months. Since he had learned many things recently, he desperately needed to digest them instead of continuing to acquire new attainments. For example, he had to gradually enhance his Immortal Pressing Arts, the Solitary Heavenly Knife, the Hallucination Body Movements and other recently acquired techniques through the cultivation of the first volume of the Muscle-bone Strengthening Scripture. He also had to study the first stance of the Buddha’s Palm technique, the immediate requirement to grasp the Turning Heaven and Earth Upside and Down technique, the Standing Still technique, the Tri-Gem Wish Fists technique and the Five Thunder Bombardment of Sky technique. There was also the assimilation of the <em>Muscle-Bone Strengthening Scriptures</em> , hastening the process of unsealing his Ninth Apertures, completion of the final level of his Golden Bell Shield protection spell, and training of his Eight-Nine Mysteries technique. There was so much to do!</p><p>Sikong Tu didn’t realize that Meng Qi was familiar with his story. He experienced a moment of lucidness before his death and croaked, “I was momentarily consumed with greed and thought I could increase my profits by drawing the attention of two opposing factions. I tried to wring the best price I could from them, but who knew they would act like vengeful wolves and set blood-thirsty hunters on me. Haha! In the end, it was greed that became my undoing…”</p><p>Death was upon him. He had long lost the ability to walk. If not for the spells burning his soul, he likely wouldn’t be able to speak at all.</p><p>“A treasure?” Meng Qi feigned ignorance.</p><p>“Seeking danger in the Jianghu is the most taboo act of them all…” Sikong Tu lamented. “I came across a hidden tomb in the Valley of Unkempt Tombs and found a treasure crafted by Emperor Ai of the previous dynasty. The user would be able to accumulate the fortunes of people and use them to strengthen his own fate as the Destined Ruler. Due to its similarities to the Sword of the Human Sovereign, it’s called the True Emperor Seal.”</p><p>“The treasure is of no real use to ordinary people but priceless to anyone who bears the right to be future Destined Rulers or practices the art of mysticism and divination. The former will be able to strengthen their fortunes to be future monarchs, where even the weakest will enjoy tremendous prosperity while their enemies suffer bad luck. The latter would enjoy a smooth training process, allowing them to achieve breakthroughs in their craft with ease.</p><p>“Emperor Ai had apparently tried to use the treasure to rejuvenate his court but alas, it wasn’t the Sword of Human Sovereign. The seal wasn’t strong enough to overturn the tides of fate, thus ending his rule.”</p><p>The flesh on the remaining half of his face convulsed as if he was struggling with great pain. Meng Qi couldn’t help feeling sympathy for him and helpfully added, “Thus you passed on the word about the treasure to the Capital so the Crown Prince and Prince Jin would come here to bid for your treasure. This arrangement would allow you to get the best deal. Did I get that right?”</p><p>“How did you know?” Sitong Tu appeared surprised. His entire being was fighting against pain. He was worried about dying before he could explain everything.</p><p>“Prince Jin is currently staying with the Mi Clan while the Crown Prince is lodging at the Samantabhadra Temple. It’s hardly a secret to anyone who can perform simple deductions,” Meng Qi explained vaguely.</p><p>Sikong Tu smiled bitterly. “I suppose so. In this world, few have a need for the treasure. The treasure can only flourish in the hands of the right owner. Too bad the owner turns out to be someone who wants my life.</p><p>“I had planned on retiring after completing this deed and spend a peaceful life with my family. That was why I planned to get as much profit as possible and have my son walk on the righteous path by entering the Huanhua Swords Sect. I wanted to see him become a great master using the treasures I give him. I wanted him to live without fearing for his life.”</p><p>He was overwhelmed with complex emotions as if he felt guilty for not being able to see his son grow up.</p><p>In the perilous Jianghu, disciples of aristocratic families and prominent sects often lived better and longer lives than ordinary folks. Many of them were able to die in their beds at ripe old ages.</p><p>Most who speak of retiring or going home to marry their sweethearts after doing one final job often end up dying… Meng Qi said nothing, merely staring at Sitong Ku as he waited for him to bring up his request.</p><p>“Greed ruins, indeed. I have no one to blame for my fate today.” Sikong Tu’s eyes were full of emotions. “Since I’m about to die very soon, I should at least leave my family with something. My friend, please sell the treasure to either of the princes. You can keep half of the reward and send the rest to my family.”</p><p>Meng Qi chuckled. “You’re already immobilized. Aren’t you worried I’d just snatch it?”</p><p>“What person would carry the treasure with him while bargaining?” Sikong Tu’s eyes remained clear as he stared unblinkingly into Meng Qi’s eyes. “If you snatch it from me, I’d carry the secret to my grave. No one will ever find the treasure!”</p><p>He took in a breath, suppressing the pain. “I know this is a dangerous task. You’re not only contending with the two princes but other mysterious forces as well. It’ll be difficult to outmaneuver them. If you’re not careful, you’ll end up like me. But if you’re not greedy and decide on the buyer as soon as possible, you’ll still have the hope of leaving with the reward unscathed.”</p><p>“But neither the princes are good men. I might not be able to walk away after reaping benefit from them.” Meng Qi remained calm, suppressing a smile. He showed no hint of distress.</p><p>Sikong Tu nodded. “Yes. This is a dangerous task. Consider my proposal seriously but I can’t last much longer.”</p><p>He added, “The Crown Prince is a relatively safe choice, being a believer of Buddhism. When he has a choice, he won’t be too cruel.”</p><p>Meng Qi pondered a split second before agreeing. “Very well. I’ll accept your request.”</p><p>His quick response unsettled Sikong Tu and he stared at him incredulously. “You’re not going to consider it any longer? This is a very dangerous task!”</p><p>“Fortune favors the bold, my friend,” Meng Qi answered curtly.</p><p>Sikong Tu was already dying. He had neither the strength nor the time to question Meng Qi’s speedy decision. He took a deep breath. “What is your name, my friend? Will you please make a Soul-pledging Oath?”</p><p>“I’m Su Meng.” Meng Qi exhaled.</p><p>Sikong Tu looked stunned. “Killing Blade? No wonder…”</p><p>Strong men naturally had the right to say ‘fortune favors the bold’!</p><p>“I, Su Meng, promise that I’ll sell the True Emperor Seal to one of the princes in exchange for something that is of equal value…” Meng Qi began to take the oath.</p><p>Just then, Sikong Tu’s pupils darkened and little rays of light appeared in them. The rays connected into constellations as if they were a starry sky.</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly lost senses of his surroundings as if he had inexplicably entered a void. Chaos surrounded him with constellation-like lines of light emerging and reentering the void. The faintly discernible lights occasionally twisted to form a mass.</p><p>Sikong Tu’s figure floated before his eyes. The lines of light spread out to form a spider’s web.</p><p>Sikong Tu stared at Meng Qi, his voice ringing in the void. “Don’t worry. This is a simple karmic trick I’ve learned from one of my excavations. I’m just worried you wouldn’t put all your heart into this. That’s why, with your approval, I’ve transferred my karmic fate to you. If you fail in your task, the karma will weigh on you and make it difficult for you to achieve the Exterior Scenery.”</p><p>Since Meng Qi had made the Soul-Pledging Oath, he was naturally willing to accept this fate.</p><p>The transfer of karmic fates…</p><p>To reap Sikong Tu’s rewards and bear his karma…</p><p>Suddenly, he recalled his memory of disguising as Second Young Master Tang with exceptional clarity. He seemed to have gotten one step closer to unraveling the mystery of the last stroke of the Ananda Oath-breaking Bladesmanship, the Cause and Effect Link.</p><p><em>The Blade of</em> Anavakara <em>!</em></p><p>Meng Qi completed the oath, saying, “I can give up half of the reward. I ask only for the chance to learn the mystic technique I just saw!”</p><p>With this mystique technique, it wouldn’t just be a pipe dream to cultivate the Karma Fruit!</p><p>Undoubtedly, Dominator of Samsara in Six Realms would possess this mystique technique but looking for it in the Exchange List would be akin to searching for a needle in the haystack. It would be extremely difficult to look for it without any clues!</p><p>Sikong Tu was first stunned but instantly smiled. “Very well then! My wife knows this technique. When you’re done, you can learn it from her in exchange for the reward.”</p><p>A loud crack filled the void. A glimmering star, threaded by a faintly-lighted thread connecting to Sikong Tu glided through the space of myriad colors and light toward Meng Qi. Given his speed, he could have avoided the star if he wished to. But he merely waited quietly for the approaching light.</p><p>With the burden of Sikong Tu’s karma, he felt an inexplicable heaviness weighing on him. Visions of the Crown Prince, Prince Jin, and others crossed his mind. He also saw Sikong Tu’s family and residence. It was as if all these memories and karma were his own!</p><p>The air about Meng Qi instantly changed and the Eight Nine Mysteries spell activated on its own. He felt as if he was Sikong Tu himself.</p><p>With Sikong Tu’s karma, Meng Qi would be able to emulate him!</p><p>Sikong Tu widened his eyes, unable to believe the scene before him. He felt like he was looking into a mirror.</p><p>What was going on? But before he could think any deeper, he plunged into darkness.</p><p>The mystic technique of transferring karmic fates was mysterious indeed. Truly, one couldn’t judge a book by its cover. No wonder Sikong Tu could escape Gu Xiaosang’s ambush… Meng Qi opened his eyes just in time to see Sikong Tu combust into flames. The fire came from within him and instantly consumed him. Meng Qi suspected that it was the countercharge from transferring his karmic fate.</p><p>Very soon, only a small, golden seal remained in his place. In the end, Sikong Tu still lied! He had been carrying the seal all along!</p><p>The seal was engraved with scenes of agriculture, rivers, and mountains on all sides. Though it was small, it exuded a sense of grandeur. Meng Qi looked at ‘culprit’ behind the turbulent affairs in Ying City, feeling as if he couldn’t quite believe his eyes.</p><p>Others had been turning the world upside down for this treasure, yet he had merely stumbled upon it…</p><p>Wild imagination crossed his mind.</p><p>He imagined pretending to be Sikong Tu and continuing to fan the flames of chaos. He would find an opportunity to lure the Crown Prince, Prince Jin, the Myths, and the Luo Denomination into a fight! He would have them fight each other like a bunch of rabid dogs!</p><p>Meanwhile, he would stay in the shadows as the mastermind. He would watch them fight to their deaths as he sips his wine leisurely!</p><p>Thinking about this, he couldn’t help smirking. He then wiped his mouth and straightened out his expression. He quietly said to the seal,</p><p>“Rest assured. I’ll definitely strike a favorable deal with the prince.”</p><p>Though it was fun to imagine, he was nonetheless not an impulsive person. Since the safest and most appropriate path was laid before him, why would he take unnecessary risks? Why would he risk his life to stir trouble among Exterior experts?</p><p>Besides, his oath was only about selling the treasure. It didn’t matter who the buyer was!</p><p>Furthermore, if Sikong Tu and the seal disappeared, the Crown Prince, Prince Jin, and the Myths would likely suspect each other of getting the seal. They would probe each other, eventually resulting in conflicts.</p><p>In the next few days, he would hide the seal properly and laugh as the drama unfolds!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
