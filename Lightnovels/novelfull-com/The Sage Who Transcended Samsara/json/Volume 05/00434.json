They all stared at his face covered in white bandages. Some were surprised, some astounded, some gloated, and some resentful.</p><p>He was right! Since Mu An had been killed by the enemy, how could Ji Tao find the chance to ask for assistance and threaten him?</p><p>Although Ji Tao’s Thunder God blood lineage was really powerful, Mu An had many Heavenly Knowing skills and creepy tricks. Most of the people present had experienced that power. How could Ji Tao match him?</p><p>Maybe he was scared of death and simply surrendered to the enemy?</p><p>At this time, they still had no doubt about Meng Qi’s identity. After all, they had the same height, the same breath and similar blood lineage. His appearance was also confirmed by Jiang Shenghong before being bandaged. Therefore, he was more likely to be thought to be betraying the Left Governor’s Mansion.</p><p>Zuo Yiqian covered her mouth. She could not believe that this terrible looking guy also had such poor morals. Her mother’s gaze turned icy and she could not wait to cut every person who was related to the Red Coat army into pieces.</p><p>Zuo Hanfeng stopped pacing and looked at Meng Qi. His eyes were cold and deep, like a deep green pool.</p><p>Meng Qi was not worried about the looks they gave at all. However, he felt nervous about Zuo Hanfeng’s.</p><p>The coldness penetrated his body inch by inch. Meng Qi’s organs seemed to be gradually frozen and his blood became cold as the flow slowed down.</p><p>He held his spirit inside and tried to remain as calm as a peaceful lake reflecting everything around it. He used Eight Nine Mysteries, imitated the breath vividly and even took Ji Tao’s response to this look into consideration. Meng Qi’s face turned blue and he was shivering with his teeth clenched.</p><p>“What do you have to say?” Zuo Hanfeng asked in a low voice.</p><p>Zuo Hanfeng was strict with his subordinate soldiers. If not permitted by him, no one could rush to speak up because it would be viewed as disrespect to him. Only after Yin Lenghui went to work for him and was trusted, did more of Zuo Hanfeng’s soldiers start to express their opinions as they wished. Also because of this, Yin Lenghui and other Dissimilated Men had a bad relationship with soldiers and officials of Left Governor’s Mansion.</p><p>Meng Qi was shivering. He quickly said, “Your Eminence, I’m innocent!”</p><p>“At that time, I had many followers to help me. Naturally, he was distracted to defend their attacks, so I took the opportunity.”</p><p>“Yes, Your Eminence. There were many rats with Ji Tao at that time. If the enemy had overlooked them, they would have been able to send out signals for help.” Jiang Shenghong stepped forward and supported his favored man.</p><p>He squinted a bit while looking at Yin Lenghui as if he were itching to eat him and tear his skin to use as a blanket.</p><p><em>“His men are disappointing but he blamed the loss on me. He’s really evil!”</em></p><p>Zuo Hanfeng gently nodded in silence, but he continued staring at Meng Qi.</p><p>Meng Qi tried his best to imitate Ji Tao pretending to be wronged and raged on, “Besides, the three men I encountered were probably only a small portion of the enemy. There must be other great masters. It’s such a normal situation, but Mr. Yin makes it sound unreasonable…”</p><p>“That makes sense! When we checked the place where they fought, we found four different kinds of tracks, so they must have more than three people at that time.” Jiang Shenghong echoed, trying to support Meng Qi.</p><p>Zuo Hanfeng’s face turned bright and his gaze moved to Yin Lenghui and Lan Die.</p><p>Meng Qi felt relaxed, as if he had been absolved. He pretended to be relieved and exhaled. His back was covered with cold sweat to such a degree that his inner clothes were soaked.</p><p>Yin Lenghui sneered without no change in his expression. “I was only asking. Why were you so angry?”</p><p>Before Meng Qi answered, he turned to Zuo Hanfeng and cupped his hands in the other before his chest. “Your Eminence, I know how to find our enemies.”</p><p>Meng Qi’s pupils slightly contracted. <em>“He can find us?”</em></p><p><em>“With his Voodoo?”</em></p><p>If he had not been used to keeping calm in the face of danger, he would have panicked.</p><p>“What?” Many soldiers and officials blurted out. <em>“Yin Lengfeng has a method? Did he fake his anger after Mu An’s death?”</em></p><p>Zuo Yiqian curiously looked at Yin Lengfeng with her beautiful big eyes. She was more much afraid of Dissimilated Men with creepy tricks and poisonous bugs than Ji Tao, but she was also curious about the mysterious Voodoo. <em>“Can they really find these ghastly enemies without any clues?”</em></p><p>“Why didn’t you tell us earlier?” The sophisticated Zuo Hanfeng asked calmly.</p><p>Yin Lenghui wore a creepy smile. “Because I was not capable of finding them. I only dared to ask for your help after some consideration.”</p><p>“How can I help?” Zuo Hanfeng did not have wrinkles on his face, so he only looked to be about forty years old. The speed of aging for Descendants of Divine Devil was slow.</p><p>Yin Lenghui said, “I only need you to fully stimulate and sustain one object. The rest is on me.”</p><p>“Okay.” Zuo Hanfeng was not one to hesitate.</p><p>Yin Lenghui took out his left hand. Black gas lashed out. Inside it was a grey doll which was carved into many mysterious patterns. “Your Eminence, I had an indirect fight with the head of the enemy before. Although I did not catch him, I caught his breath and sealed it into this Voodoo doll. With its help, as long as he is still inside Daning, we can find him and lock his Vital Spirit no matter where he hides. In this way, he can no longer hide!”</p><p>Yin Lenghui was much weaker than Du Huaishang. Thus, when he sieged Du Huaishang, he failed to catch the breath that was needed.</p><p>“You have such Voodoo!” Jiang Shenghong, of the same strength and realm, was shocked too.</p><p>Meng Qi lowered his eyes and looked at the tip of his nose. <em>“How creepy are Yin Lengfeng’s tricks!”</em></p><p>Meng Qi had been cautious. He thought that he did not leave any clues that could be found by Voodoo tricks. However, he did not know when Yin Lenghui had stolen a thread of his breath!</p><p><em>“Is it actually breath? Yin Lengfeng seems to be omitting or hiding something…”</em></p><p><em>“But it’s not time to worry about these things now. If Yin Lengfeng’s Voodoo works out, I won’t be able to escape even if I grow a pair of wings!”</em></p><p><em>“I have to find a way to leave the hall. I will have more room to use my skills outside.”</em></p><p><em>“But if my actions are too abrupt, in addition to the previous suspect, everyone will suspect me!”</em></p><p>A God-tying Rope was inside of Meng Qi’s Space Ring. He would have to face experts of the Exterior in the future, so if he was exposed, he would seize the chance to save his life with this secret weapon. Meng Qi took it as his last resort, but he anxiously thought about other methods as well.</p><p>Different ideas popped into Meng Qi’s mind like lightning or flying flames. Meng Qi’s heart was as boisterous as boiling water as he failed to calm himself down.</p><p><em>“What should I do?”</em></p><p><em>“What should I do?”</em></p><p>“Your Eminence, you just need to hold the Voodoo doll, trigger it and maintain its glowing light.” Yin Lenghui explained.</p><p>After Zuo Hanfeng took the doll, he checked it carefully. He gently nodded and agreed to help Yin Lenghui after he made sure that this doll was not a threat to him.</p><p>Silence fell before something big happened. Meng Qi’s breaths became slower and slower. He struggled to get rid of other unrelated thoughts and left only the following ideas:</p><p><em>“If he uses the doll as a medium to launch an attack, his strength will be weakened. Otherwise, Yin Lengfeng would use it himself…”</em></p><p><em>“And the trick must affect his soul and spirit…”</em></p><p><em>“If so, I’d better run Supernatural Power of Shaking Heaven and Hitting Earth to lure their minds into peering at my heart. Then, I could imitate some mysterious, profound thoughts in my mind to threaten and counterattack them!”</em></p><p><em>“If so, I still have some opportunities!”</em></p><p><em>“If I fail, I should launch the attack at once. First, I should use God-tying Rope to trap Zuo Hanfeng. Then, I should fight my way out and make a great commotion to inform Jiang Zhiwei and others that things aren’t going well…”</em></p><p><em>“What mysterious things should I imitate?”</em> When Meng Qi thought about that, many descriptions from the past life and the present occurred in his mind.</p><p>Under gazes full of expectation and curiosity, Zuo Hanfeng clenched the Voodoo doll and used his mind to trigger it.</p><p>Weird patterns showed and lit up on its grey skin like a shackles. It gave out a deep dark light.</p><p>Unlike his coldness before, Yin Lenghui became more profound like an evil ghost from the bottom of Nine Serenities or a Skyscraping Devil that was good at controlling others’ minds. His sword-like gaze slowly fell on the doll.</p><p>Zuo Yiqian was still looking at him with fear and curiosity as she tightly grabbed onto her mother’s clothes. Her joints protruded and were completely bloodless.</p><p>Meng Qi unified what he saw, what he sensed and what he thought. What he really thought was completely different from how he acted.</p><p>With the Voodoo doll, Yin Lenghui had the illusion that Vital Spirit had left his body and he was in a beautiful place surrounded by mountains and rivers.</p><p><em>“Abnormal results did happen. I was lucky to ask for his help!”</em> Yin Lengfeng snorted and he closed his eyes to sense the opponent. Finally, he had caught a similar breath.</p><p>Making use of Zuo Hanfeng’s strength, he flew higher and higher up to the sky with Zuo Hanfeng’s eyes. He needed to break through Meng Qi’s dreamland of the mind to find the Vital Spirit.</p><p>The high mountains and huge rivers became smaller and smaller. Gradually, he was surrounded by clouds. Yin Lenghui did not stop but continued to lift himself up under the guidance of his senses.</p><p>The earth became a big ball surrounded by the white frog. Yin Lengfeng froze slightly. <em>“Is it the image of our world from the sky?</em></p><p>Looking around, he only felt cold. The surroundings were dark and endless. Countless balls floated around, among which were burning suns.</p><p><em>“So many stars, so many grand suns, so many worlds…”</em> Yin Lengfeng was shocked. He struggled to repress his desire to explore and lifted his Vital Spirit again.</p><p>His thoughts went higher and higher. After a long time, he saw an intangible and transparent wall surrounding what he saw before and separated them into numerous universes.</p><p>At that exact moment, Yin Lenghui suddenly understood the names of what he had seen before.</p><p>“The universe!”</p><p>Room from all directions formed space, while the past and the future constituted time!</p><p>“So many universes…” He heard the sighs of Zuo Hanfeng.</p><p>Suddenly, he felt that time flew back, the stars disappeared, the grand suns shrank, and the many universes collapsed towards the same point.</p><p>As if experiencing a time travel, Yin Lenghui and Zuo Hanfeng saw these different universes transformed back into basic elements, then concentrated into Yin and Yang and contracted to Tai Chi. Everything turned to chaos!</p><p>The chaos of so many universes brought about complete darkness. They quickly condensed into an unexplainable point.</p><p>It did not contain the order of time or the direction of space. It was the beginning and the ending of everything. It contained countless universes. It was the beginning of all causes and results.</p><p>Here, one could not ask about his previous life for there was no concept of past.</p><p>It was too amazing to understand!</p><p>Yin Lenghui and Zuo Hanfeng were both stunned. They could not believe their senses and their bodies derived from their minds suddenly began to shiver.</p><p>At that exact moment, they saw a Taoist sitting right inside of that point. His age and appearance could not be clearly seen.</p><p>“You are…” Yin Lenghui was confused.</p><p>The Taoist opened his eyes. His detached and profound air spread towards them. His grand and calm voice was heard.</p><p>“I’m Yuanshi.”</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>As he opened his eyes, heaven and the earth were opened!</p><p>Bells seemed to ring inside of Yin Lenghui’s and Zuo Hanfeng’s Vital Spirit. Their minds seemed to be greatly shocked. In addition to what they had seen before, they could not bear such suffering, so they cut the underlying relation.</p><p>“Crack.” The Voodoo doll held by Zuo Hanfeng broke into pieces.</p><p>With a shocked and terrified gaze, Yin Lenghui took a few steps back. Blood spouted from his nose.</p><p><em>“Is he the enemy that I’m tracing?”</em></p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
