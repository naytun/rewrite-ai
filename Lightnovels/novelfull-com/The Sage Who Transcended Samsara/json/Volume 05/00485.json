They asked him to go around or wait until they passed.</p><p>He seemed mildly tempered as he was still smiling, and he nodded.</p><p>Just when the group stopped noticing him, the young Taoist Monk suddenly headed towards the head of the Yu family’s carriage with long strides!</p><p>Thump, thump, thump. His every step was like an earthquake, causing many of the servants to faint with blood spilling out of their Seven Apertures.</p><p>Thump, thump, thump, he was extremely fast, quickly breaking through all barriers.</p><p>“Assassin!” Finally, someone had come to their senses.</p><p>Zing! Swords and blades were unsheathed, palms were ready to strike, and the tension was high.</p><p>Clang, clang, clang, the young Taoist monk did not stop his stride, allowing all the swords, blades and palms to hit him. He was not at all affected by the strikes, and conversely, those that had hit him all fell to the ground.</p><p>In the blink of an eye, he opened up a path like a raging bull, quickly reaching the carriage.</p><p>A double-edged blade appeared in his hands as he sliced down diagonally.</p><p>The tip of the blade started twisting like a vortex, blocking the sunlight.</p><p>Though this blade attack did not accumulate the power of heaven and earth, its transformations, however, were unpredictable. Meng Qi froze as he witnessed the scene; it was as though someone was demonstrating the Virtual Purity Sabersmanship just for him.</p><p>From the time the Taoist Monk started running to when he neared the carriage, it all happened in the blink of an eye. So quick, in fact, that Master Yu did not have time react – he too was just watching.</p><p>Witnessing the situation, his expression changed, then he lifted both of his bronze hands into the air to block the long saber, using a move with the momentum of the heavens.</p><p>This move was mysterious and unpredictable as though it was the effect of Dharma and Logos of Heaven and Earth, but this move too did not accumulate Nature Force.</p><p>This move had somewhat perplexed Meng Qi.</p><p>“Clang!”</p><p>The long saber clashed with the bronze hands in the air, producing a dull thump. The air-tension spread frighteningly in all directions.</p><p>Four horses fell to the ground without so much as a screech, but all of the horses’ bones had shattered. The carriage had sunk a few feet and the wheels of the carriage had dug into the ground!</p><p>The bottom half of the young Taoist Monk’s body had suddenly transformed into that of a gold and white colored python, which then wrapped itself around the carriage, with the head of the Yu family still in it.</p><p>The top half of his body did not change, who then used the double-edged sword like a stick and slashed downwards with the strength that could overturn the seas.</p><p>Master Yu’s Upstanding Qi had transformed into a blade, striking the body of the snake in an attempt to cut it, but instead, sounds of colliding metal could be heard.</p><p>Meanwhile, the dynamic transformations of his hands were like that of a mesh, feinting and striking, ready to take on the double-edged blade yet again.</p><p>Bang! The horse carriage completely collapsed.</p><p>They were both so fast that they had collided twice in the blink of an eye, and Meng Qi’s eyes twitched from watching the battle. “What incredible power…but why doesn’t Master Yu summon the power of heaven and earth to evoke a tactical formation …”</p><p>Just at that moment, a person emerged, flying, from the right side of the carriage. By the time Meng Qi turned to look, all he saw was a girl with cascaded jet-black hair – she was tall with long powerful legs.</p><p>Meng Qi was shocked as he felt the breath of… Progenitor Doumu.</p><p>She had come as well?</p><p>She was the powerhouse who had once given the president of Zhenwu Sect’s general affairs, Xuan Yuanzi, such a beat down that he embarrassingly escaped. She had reached the apex of the Exterior level a decade ago!</p><p>“The Immortals” had brought their best this time!</p><p>Making the best of the chaos that Lord of Purity and Magic had caused by wrapping himself around master Yu, Progenitor Doumu was like a wolf in a lamb herd, devouring everything in her way.</p><p>She was short of breath and it was as though she was carrying something heavy. Then a master from the Yu family had come to his senses and slashed at her with his sword.</p><p>“The Yu family was definitely not short on talent since it seemed that everyone was a master of the Oneness of Heaven and Man level…” Just as this thought appeared in Meng Qi’s mind, Progenitor Doumu slapped the sword body.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The master of the Yu family exploded along with his sword. His blood and flesh splattered – he had literally exploded into pieces.</p><p>“And there I was thinking that I could rival any exterior level master so long as they didn’t invoke the power of heaven and earth. Now I see that I could only probably match masters who have not passed the Celestial Ladder, and who were not fast…Progenitor Doumu, on the other hand, is too scary…” Meng Qi was in total shock, then he saw both Progenitor Doumu’s palms fly into the air and her body too started to erupt. Both bodies erupted until they started flying backward with blood splattering out of their mouths.</p><p>“The Exterior level…damn! Two exterior level masters just casually appeared…” Meng Qi started having suspicions about the Yu family. <em>They are not an elite family. Bringing three exterior level masters on a trip, did they no longer want their businesses in the South Province?</em></p><p>Progenitor Doumu charged her way past two exterior-level masters and stopped before Yu Longzi’s carriage. Suddenly, carter Ma, Yu Longzi and another two guards all drew their weapons, be it a blade, sword, whip or fist, they all tried summoning the power of heaven and earth; however, they still couldn’t evoke Nature Force.</p><p><em>Surprise, surprise, another four exterior level masters…</em> Meng Qi subconsciously took a step forward, blocking Su Ziyue and Su Zihua.</p><p>The total was already up to seven exterior masters, yet these masters were only ranked between 30th and 40th!</p><p>Just exactly how powerful was the Yu family?</p><p>Clash! Two palms collided against eight hands, and the guards were forced backward with their feet screeching across the ground. Carter Ma’s whip swung around and unintentionally hit the horse. Blood started spilling out of Yu Longzi’s mouth and she looked like she was about to collapse when a maid stopped her with a finger pointed at her back, dissipating the momentum.</p><p>After making that move, the green-robed maid had transformed into a beautiful young lass with delicate features. She resembled a mandala flower, which meant that she was attractive and dangerous at the same time.</p><p>“Demoness Gu Xiaosang!”</p><p>Meng Qi’s pupils contracted as he suddenly understood. The name Little Zi had been derived from Yu Longzi, and the Luo Denomination was masked by the aristocratic Yu family. But it seemed that they had been exposed and the Immortals found out. The objective of the Immortals’s attack was the Saint Emperor’s Token!</p><p>No wonder the Yu family dared not summon the power of heaven and earth; with so many exterior level masters, they would definitely arouse suspicion!</p><p>Gu Xiaosang was majestic and solemn, and with the formation of five exterior level masters, she was finally able to fend off Progenitor Doumu.</p><p>While those thoughts flashed through Meng Qi’s mind, Carter Ma who was not part of the formation, jumped at him with his whip in hand, creating a loud sound.</p><p>After the Goddess had been exposed, he was not going to allow the members of the Su family to create even more chaos!</p><p>Carter Ma’s breathing was scary and his spiritual energy was overbearing. Meng Qi suddenly began hallucinating, feeling as though enemies were proceeding toward him from all directions.</p><p>At this moment of danger, Meng Qi decided to close his eyes and take a deep breath, taking in the cool breeze of the night.</p><p>The Vital Qi of heaven and earth was very unbalanced, disturbed by all that was happening nearby. Whatever nature had sensed had all been reflected in Meng Qi’s heart like a mirror.</p><p>Immersed in the energy of heaven and earth fusing together, “Heaven Inflicted Pain” slowly but surely struck out like it had been pressured by the hallucinations.</p><p>Bang!</p><p>The long whip met the blade in the air as they encompassed each other, but Meng Qi’s blade was dynamic in its transformations, turning the back and handle of the blade both into weapons.</p><p>Continuous clanging sounds of the weapons could be heard as Meng Qi utilized his bladesmanship to a maximum but was still only able to fight to a draw.</p><p>By now, his blood was boiling and his hands began to hurt, but he was still able to hold on with the Immortal Pressing Art.</p><p>The long whip then stretched out like strikes of thunder; every attack was unpredictable, added to the fusion of heaven and earth’s energy, his moves were just marvelous.</p><p>Meng Qi was finding it increasingly difficult to attack, but fortunately his every blade strike hit the fusion point of heaven and earth’s energy. As a result, he was able to diffuse every whip attack.</p><p>Now the Matchless Celestial Saber had battled to a standstill!</p><p>For the first time, Meng Qi felt that his bladesmanship and sword art had entered the expert level, as he felt like he had reached the Exterior level!</p><p>Meng Qi then flicked his long blade and jumped away from the stalemate and then attacked continuously eight times. Perhaps it was because those attacks were a combination of Yin and Yang, life and death, but every blade seemed to be in tune with the principles of heaven and earth.</p><p>The attacks had forced Carter Ma to use the speed of the Exterior realm to retreat. Meng Qi too suddenly retreated and, as his blade handle struck something, Su Ziyue flew a few yards into the air. Su landed next to a tree and then fainted without feeling any pain.</p><p>Su Zihua was surrounded by four Enlightened Masters of the Luo Denomination, battling them all to a stalemate.</p><p>“This seemingly cheap brother of mine seems to have already reached Heaven-man Connection, and this is before he goes all out. It just shows that you can’t judge someone by their looks…” Just as these thoughts flashed in Meng Qi’s mind, Carter Ma quickly neared him again.</p><p>Though Meng Qi was losing this battle, he was still able to hold his ground. Neither of them had used any moves that required the summoning of heaven and earth’s energy. Even with the Exterior-level moves, they only utilized the transformations.</p><p>On the other front, Master Yu was able to free himself from the python, and Lord of Purity and Magic had reverted back into human form. But the lord did not lose an ounce of feistiness. His double-edged blade was either extremely strong and fierce or dynamic with its transformations. He also turned his head, arms, chest, back, Dantian, legs, and hair all into weapons whereby the enemies would either fall or die upon touching any part of his body. Within moments he was able to handle all of the servants.</p><p>Suddenly, he yelled in a heavy tone and another head grew out of his neck. Two extra arms also grew out of his shoulders and, though it wasn’t the Law Phenomenon, he now had two heads and four arms.</p><p>He was already holding the double-edged blade to pressure Master Yu, then another blade and sword appeared in his newly grown arms. While passing the spot where Meng Qi and Carter Ma were battling, he suddenly pulled them into the fray.</p><p><em>Now that’s the real Eight Nine Mysteries…</em> Meng Qi praised silently in his heart. Instead of cooperating with Lord of Purity and Magic, he took a few steps forward, demonstrating the five-fold Essence with his blade. He sliced downwards toward the formation that Gu Xiaosang and other exterior masters had formed. It then felt like a thunderbolt struck their heads!</p><p>This blade attack looked zig-zagged, but its energy was able to get through the gap of the airflow created by the formation.</p><p>Meng Qi was not about to let go of any chance to kill Gu Xiaosang!</p><p>Progenitor Doumu was attacking in the inner circle and outside was the long blade’s energy. Gu Xiaosang’s expressions did not change at all but he just glared at Meng Qi. Her eyes were still gorgeous with a hint of sadness.</p><p>Meng Qi felt as though he could hear sounds of Bandari in his heart like it was heaving a sigh.</p><p>“Do I have to save you, my husband, a thousand times before you could trust me?”</p><p>His vital spirit began to tremble, but Meng Qi did not waver once and continued his attack with the long blade.</p><p>It was as though Gu Xiaosang was in the middle of the ocean and the silk threads were swimming around, holding together the other exterior masters. But then the threads began breaking with each blade attack and the formation started to collapse.</p><p>Amid the crisis, she placed her hands before her chest and her body started making Bandari sounds. Then all the men of the Luo Denomination projected their light energy towards her, forming little light Buddha statues between her palms. Those light statues looked exactly like Gu Xiaosang.</p><p>Without summoning the energy of heaven and earth, the statues entered Gu Xiaosang’s body. Her breathing became stronger like she was leaving this world. Then, she pointed with her finger and…</p><p>“Unborn Venerable Mother, Vacuum Hometown!”</p><p>The finger and the palm collided! Gu Xiaosang took a step back, but she wasn’t hurt!</p><p>Meng Qi was just about to attack again when he felt a ray of light heading toward his back from the woods behind him.</p><p>It was faster than light, reaching his Protective Upstanding Qi as soon as he felt it.</p><p>“Ha, you’re all going to die!” Exclaimed a raspy voice from somewhere. A flash of purple lightning flashed in the air and then disappeared. But the Grand Formation of Luoyang had been invoked.</p><p>Little did he know that he had neglected a greater danger in pursuit of a small gain!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
