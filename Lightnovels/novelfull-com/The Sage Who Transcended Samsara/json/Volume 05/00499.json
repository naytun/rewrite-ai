He was close to seizing the Nine-dragon Seal, but the two divine weapons seemed to be infused with spiritual life. They drew the Grand Formation of Luoyang on their accord and turned evenly-matched opponents for him. The sword, shrouded by purple clouds, made a U-turn to strike Heaven Sovereign.</p><p>There was no hope for the sword but it persisted in its purpose. With a slash of Heaven Sovereign’s sword, the entire Luoyang seemed to be reduced to slow motion and drained off all color. Even the sword shrouded by purple clouds and the two divine weapons became dull in their movements.</p><p>Heaven Sovereign withdrew his sword and was swept backward by the force. His breath instantly turned empty and his body became transparent. In the end, he simply disappeared without a trace.</p><p>He left firmly without any reluctance, even under the temptation of divine weapons. Though there was still greed in his heart, it did not affect his judgment or choice.</p><p>Cui Qingyu was the first to react. When he saw Sima Shi and the others, he recalled his sword and yelled, “Capture them!”</p><p>The purple clouds soared to the sky; the breath became weak and diluted. Once again, the Super Arresters could not find the courage to resist when facing the might of the sword.</p><p>Wang Wenxian’s eyes were filled with complex emotion as he stared at Sima Shi. There were countless people trapped inside the formation that Sima Shi and his group were familiar with, and yet they had chosen to collude with the Heterodox Doctrines.</p><p>Just then, someone zoomed in front of Cui Qingyu. It was the master of the Song family, Right Minister Song Shouren. “Brother Cui, please wait.”</p><p>“Brother Song, why did you stop me?” Cui Qingyu asked, stunned.</p><p>With a grim expression, Song Shouren pointed at the aged Emperor and the imperial palace. “The chief perpetrator has already died. Though Sima Shi and the rest are accomplices, their crime doesn’t warrant death. Furthermore, they might have been deceived or coerced into doing this. We have to give them a fair trial to prevent false accusations.”</p><p>“There are many great masters in the world. If we kill ours without getting the whole story, would it not weaken our country and give others a chance to succeed in their schemes against us?”</p><p>Cui Qingyu’s expression changed slightly after hearing this and the grip on his sword became tighter.</p><p>The grandmaster of the Wang family of River East walked up to Song Shouren and stood next to him with a grin. “Brother Cui, mind your temper. I see that Sima Shi and the others have stopped resisting. It is better if we do not engage in mutual hostility.”</p><p>Wang Siyuan, who had neither entered the formation nor joined the battle, watched the whole thing unfold from a distant platform. “So it is true that the star of the Emperor is swaying, and the Heaven Sovereign has returned once again. This marks the beginning of a catastrophe…” he muttered.</p><p>He seemed to have come only to get confirmation.</p><p>Following the grandmaster, those from the Zhang family of Longnan, the Sima family of Xiliang, the Zheng family of Hengyuan, and the Ruan family of Langya snapped out of it and walked over. They wanted to take the opportunity to eliminate the Zhao family of Luoyang and balance the scale for the Cui family.</p><p>In the past, they had used countless methods to try and stop the royal family from once again condensing their Dharmakayas. They did not want the Zhao family to truly suppress other aristocratic families on its level. How could they turn their backs on their original intention at this very minute and welcome the Cui family, which had their own Dharmakaya, in replacing the Zhao family?</p><p>Was that not asking for trouble for themselves?</p><p>By comparison, a weakened Zhao family of Luoyang was far more beneficial to them. They could also implicate the Cui family with this!</p><p>Besides, with the Zhao family’s loss of virtue, it was a great opportunity for them to reap benefits and extend their hands into Six Fan School. The arresters who were not part of the Zhao family would definitely consider the situation and join them easily.</p><p>The hustle and bustle around the world was all for profit anyway!</p><p>Cui Qingyu muttered quietly to himself for quite some time before a small smile appeared on his face. “You’re right, sir.”</p><p>Everything happened so fast that his family had no time to prepare a response. Never mind talking, they had never had discussed the possibility of such an occurrence with other families and agreed upon exchanging benefits. It would still have been fine if the families were not united; that way, his family could take advantage of it. At the moment, it was impossible for them to take forcibly. Instead, they had to scheme carefully to amass their benefit. It would not be difficult to eliminate dissenters with the sword and strength of the distant Dharmakaya in hand. The issue was that the top aristocratic families were rooted in Zhou County and had only sent representatives to Luoyang. If his family made a hasty move, it would be equivalent to having a fall-out with those families.</p><p>The thing that the Wang family from Zhou County could not overlook the most was the joining of the Heterodox Doctrines, but the circumstances were greater than the influence of men. They could only tacitly agree to the majority’s decision.</p><p>Just then, the formation collapsed entirely and revealed those inside: the Crown Prince, Prince Jin, Zhao Heng, Meng Qi, Ruan Yushu, and Qi Zhengyan.</p><p>The Crown Prince and Prince Jin had fought a battle so ferocious that they were both heavily injured. They were gasping for breath, especially Prince Jin who seemed to be in imminent danger due to his wounds.</p><p>Zhao Heng separated from Meng Qi and Qi Zhengyan, and instantly headed for the riverbank.</p><p>Ruan Yushu was seated cross-legged, looking so pale that her skin appeared to be translucent. Her uncle flew over and transferred Qi to her in order to aid the healing process, carefully observing Meng Qi the whole time.</p><p>No one took any notice of Fan Changmiao’s corpse lying in a corner. To all the big shots present, it was nothing worth mentioning to have a top scorer whose realm was not even in the Exterior killed. It was more important to return to the palace hall and discuss the division of their profits, as well as announce to the world that Heaven Sovereign of the Myths was a Dharmakaya!</p><p>“Uncle, Fan Changmiao was Six-annihilation Devilman. The Master of the Gu family from Zhu Province is likely Disillusionment Demon,” Meng Qi said, getting straight to the point.</p><p>The eyes of Ruan Yushu’s uncle twitched. “Six-annihilation Devilman? He actually managed to hide under everyone’s noses.”</p><p>Outsiders had no idea of Six-annihilation Devilman’s true strength. So he appeared not the least surprised when he knew Meng Qi had killed Fan Changmiao.</p><p>After he received a nod from Ruan Yushu confirming what Meng Qi’s had said, he reported this to those in charge at the Political Affairs Hall and instantly assigned his men to arrest Disillusionment Demon.</p><p>…</p><p>Duke Mightiness’ Mansion.</p><p>Having just figured out all that had happened, Meng Qi was lamenting at the appearance of Heaven Sovereign and Zhao Wuyan’s failure when he was so close to success when he was sent home. Those in charge had no time for small fry like them.</p><p>Su Li and Su Yue only returned when the sky was turning dark, both wearing unpleasant expressions. They headed straight for the ancestral hall.</p><p>Meng Qi followed after them. “How are things, Father?” he quietly asked, staring at his father’s figure.</p><p>“Better than I thought it would be. The aristocratic families are all very interested in Six Fan School. The Ruan family, in particular, personally tried to curry favor with your Fifth Uncle and promised that he would survive this obstacle safely. Now it’s a matter of just how much the aristocratic families want to weaken the imperial family’s power. Ping Jincui and the Wang family from Zhou County want them to be weakened by limiting the number of the Super Arresters from the Zhao family, or posting ministers in the Political Affairs Hall that come from the imperial family for instance. However, the other aristocratic families objected to the suggestions. They proposed for a moderate limitation and depriving the Zhao family of their control of the Emperor Sword,” Su Li replied without turning his head.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded gently. It would not benefit the other aristocratic families if the power of the Zhao family was so limited. It would merely allow the Cui family more authority.</p><p>“The Crown Prince has been disqualified for the throne, leaving only Prince Jin and Prince Wei as viable candidates. The Cui family had originally proposed for the grandmasters to act as regents but the Wang family from Zhou County was firm in that they mustn’t forget the concubine’s son. The other aristocratic families also hoped to stabilize the Zhao family this way, punishing the evil ones directly without dragging in the rest. Either way, after this, whoever becomes the Emperor will still be powerless…” Su Li’s tone carried a hint of grief when he mentioned the Emperor.</p><p>“What about you?” Meng Qi asked sharply.</p><p>Su Li sighed quietly and still without turning his head, said, “Charged with the crime of aiding the Emperor in colluding with external forces, as well as usurping the position of Duke Mightiness. I’m forbidden from taking any position, and leaving Luoyang for the rest of my life. They wanted to smother my Kung Fu but fortunately, the Ruan family from Langya and the Wang family from Zhou County spoke in my favor and helped me avoid that.”</p><p>“It’s already fortunate that you were able to save the entire Su family,” Meng Qi replied with a peaceful tone.</p><p>“For shame. Our family’s dukedom has been rescinded. I’ve dishonored our ancestors…” Su Li’s voice trembled a little.</p><p>Meng Qi inhaled sharply and asked once again, “Father, can you now tell me why you sent me to the Shaolin Temple all those years ago?”</p><p>Su Li let out a drawn-out sigh. “Back then, your mother was dying and Su Yue was provoking the Ke family into viewing you as a thorn in their side. Your grandmother saw all these things clearly but she was stuck between a rock and a hard place. On one side was the pillar of our family, and on the other was our powerful in-laws. It was obvious which side was more important. She could only make a cold-hearted decision.”</p><p>“I had the Emperor’s favor then. If I were to say that I couldn’t protect you, that would be a lie. However, the Emperor was already in cahoots with the Luo Denomination then and I was worried disaster would befall in the future, wiping out the entire Su family. I could not allow my loyalty to the Emperor to end our bloodline, so I took advantage of the situation and sent you to the Shaolin Temple. Others might not know, but I knew your mother’s brother is in the temple. I knew he would take care of you without my saying a word.”</p><p>“Just as I’d expected…” Meng Qi had come up with this assumption after discovering the collusion between the Emperor and the Luo Denomination. Now that he had received confirmation from his father, he closed his eyes and felt the final lock that bound his physical body shatter. His body and mind were at peace, in tune with one another, and his Vital Spirit vibrant – he no longer had hidden baggage concealed in him.</p><p>“Once, I wanted to be an infatuated man, but in the end I couldn’t escape filial responsibility. I wanted to lead our family into prosperity, but I crippled our family and had our dukedom rescinded,” Su Li said weakly. “I was loyal to the Emperor for my whole life. When I think about him allowing the Destruction Sect to act as they pleased, attempt to assassinate my son and lose a self-sacrificing heart, I really feel that my life has been a complete failure. It’s so…”</p><p>Meng Qi did not comment on this and merely said in a calm voice, “Father, I want to send out invitations for a banquet tomorrow.”</p><p>“Huh?” Su Li turned around in surprise. There were tear stains at the corners of his eyes.</p><p>Sending out invitations for a banquet at this time?</p><p>Why would his son think of holding a banquet at such a chaotic time?</p><p>“I’m thinking of a banquet similar to the Party of Happycloud,” Meng Qi replied calmly.</p><p>Su Li was instantly dumbfounded and asked in an alarmed but joyful tone, “You want to create an opportunity to rise through the realms at once?”</p><p>He recalled the incident with He Jiu and Wang Siyuan.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded without saying anything.</p><p>“Great! It’s truly something for our family to have a talented child like you.” His father laughed heartily, his mood instantly happier.</p><p>What did it mean to rise through the realms at once?</p><p>As long as he did not die prematurely, it meant becoming a grandmaster at the very least!</p><p>His advancement through the realms would also be much quicker compared to the average person, the same way Su Wuming had achieved N-fold Heaven in the span of a year!</p><p>Su Li appeared deeply gratified, but there was a hint of grief in his expression too. “I will immediately order the invitations be sent.”</p><p>Based on his experience, he could not be mistaken about those people.</p><p>Just as his son was about to leave the ancestral hall, he quietly said, “There’s something else. Ziyue isn’t your biological sister.”</p><p>“What?” Meng Qi was stunned.</p><p>“She’s a descendant of the Tang family from Longjun.” Su Li sighed. “Your mother was deeply saddened when the entire Tang family was exterminated. I took an opportunity to head to Xi County. Even though I couldn’t find your uncle, I found out that there were direct descendants who weren’t in the Tang family manor at the time of the extermination, escaping calamity. However, out of worry and fear, Ziyue’s parents collapsed soon after and died. Ziyue was still wrapped in swaddling clothes then. I took her with me and your mother raised her as my illegitimate child. I suppose you remember this considering how young you were.”</p><p>“I believe Master will be very happy,” Meng Qi said, feeling gratified.</p><p>…</p><p>Prince Jin’s manor.</p><p>Prince Jin, Aunt Bai, Yan Chong, and the rest were all quiet as they waited for news to come from the Political Affairs Hall. However, disputes went on ceaselessly inside the hall. It seemed likely that they would need a few more days before they could come to a conclusion.</p><p>It was then that a servant came up to Aunt Bai and Yan Chong with invitations.</p><p>“Killing Blade is holding a banquet? Why would he hold a banquet at such a critical time?” Yan Chong’s brows furrowed.</p><p>Aunt Bai replied, her eyes gleaming, “Since you have never fought him, you don’t know his realm. He’s trying to emulate He Jiu’s success in rising through the ranks in one go. Could he, perhaps, be hoping to fight you and I together?”</p><p>“I think he’s challenging that guy from the Yan family, Cui Zhe, and Wang Zai altogether, or perhaps getting into a life-or-death battle with you,” Yan Chong said, offering his guess regarding Meng Qi’s thoughts.</p><p>She smiled and replied, “Whatever it is, it’s truly exhilarating to get the chance to fight a person that has hope of rising through the ranks in one shot!”</p><p>Duke Pingjin’s manor.</p><p>Super Purple Sword Cui Zhe stared at the invitation in his hands. “Killing Blade is repeating He Jiu’s performance,” he said quietly, suppressing a smile.</p><p>“In such chaotic times, the number of people who seek to rise through the ranks immediately has increased.” Cui Qingyu did not involve himself in the dispute going on in the Political Affairs Hall as he was not a member, and stayed home instead. He smoothed his breath with his hand, appearing rather regretful.</p><p>When was the last time he had seen such audacity?</p><p>This only existed in the era of Demonic Buddha recorded in the history books!</p><p>Cui Zhe smiled. “What a pity that I’m the only one out of the top ten of the Ranking List of Young Masters currently in Luoyang. Yan Chong and Wang Zai didn’t have the fortune to attend the Party of Happycloud. Since the banquet was held in a rush, only the martial artists here were invited.”</p><p>“It’s enough to have three masters working together against him. In non-life-threatening situations, Killing Blade isn’t as good as He Jiu in fighting against a group of people.” Cui Qingyu had a good grasp of both Meng Qi and He Jiu’s martial arts. He comforted his son, saying, “You need not obsess over trying to rise through the ranks like that. Back then, wasn’t the divine monk Kong Wen stagnant in the realm of perfect Half-step? Wasn’t he still able to claim Dharmakaya? Wasn’t that the case for Master Lu of Huamei Heights as well?”</p><p>He appeared rather expectant as he continued, “I wonder what step Killing Blade will reach. Will he achieve feats similar to that of He Jiu and Wang Siyuan or will he illuminate hundreds of metres like Su Wuming did…?”</p><p>Huan Duke’s mansion.</p><p>Wang Zai read the invitation in his hand, his thoughts spelled out in his expression. “So Little Meng has finally come this far. He appeared close to a breakthrough when I saw him today at the Sumptuous Fruits Banquet. It’s fortune that I can give him a boost in his efforts.”</p><p>Langya Duke’s mansion.</p><p>Ruan Yushu’s uncle turned the invitation over in his hands and saw Ruan Yushu slowly recover from going pale in the face. “Not bad, not bad at all. This child is truly remarkable. If he succeeds, he’ll definitely be a grandmaster,” he said, rather impressed.</p><p>Ruan Yushu was not able to reply as she was chewing on a piece of dried dragon fish. She nodded gently, feeling a little doubtful.</p><p>Guangling Duke’s mansion.</p><p>Wang Siyuan smoothed out the unevenness of the invitation with his fingers with a faint smile on his face. He appeared rather expectant.</p><p>The invitations also arrived at the manors of Prince Wei and other aristocratic families, all mostly addressed to martial artists of Nine Apertures and under the Exterior realm. Naturally, the Exterior masters were also invited to attend as to avoid any mishaps.</p><p>The news swept through Luoyang like a tornado, seizing the attention of ordinary folks on the streets who were still discussing the change happening during the day.</p><p>Though the change in the imperial family was vehement, it mainly involved aristocratic families. There were no signs of any loss of control for now. Meng Qi thought that it did not have much to do with him anyway. When it came to the enlightenment of his Apertures, who knew if he would be the leading star one day?</p><p>Soon, the fervent discussions revolved around his banquet, many of which compared it to the Party of Happycloud.</p><p>“I heard Killing Blade killed Fan Changmiao, no, Six-annihilation Devilman and his momentum is currently booming. I think he’ll really succeed in rising through the ranks at once!” someone said, sighing with emotion.</p><p>Then there were those who worried over Meng Qi. “The masters suitable for the banquet this time were inferior to those who were invited to the Party of Happycloud. Who knows if they would be enough to assist Killing Blade in rising through the ranks in one go? Back then, He Jiu fought Buddhist Heart Palm, the Unstoppable, Master Lotus, and Killing Blade alone – four martial artists with the strength of the top 10 of the Ranking List. Later, he joined Ledgerkeeper of Lives and Fairy of the Extinctive Sword. Right now, the number of top 10 masters of the Ranking List are only four here in Luoyang, including Killing Blade himself. The difference is too stark!”</p><p>“Exactly! And how can the Ranking List of Young Masters back then be compared to today’s?” someone echoed in agreement.</p><p>“Yan Chong should be much stronger by now. Cui Zhe and Buddhist Heart Palm, who showed up during the Party of Happycloud, should be similar as well. Wang Zai is even stronger and isn’t that much inferior to Master Lotus back then. Befalling Devil Qi Zhengyan and Fairy of the Extinctive Sword joining hands would be enough to resist Killing Blade. This didn’t differ too greatly from the Party of Happycloud. It’s only that there’s no one in Luoyang that can seriously replace the positions of Ledgerkeeper of Lives and Fairy of the Extinctive Sword. Unless Killing Blade is expecting the number of people can make up for the disparity in strength?” someone said, making careful evaluations.</p><p>“Perhaps… perhaps he’s going to challenge perfect Half-step masters like Aunt Bai?”</p><p>“Impossible! No matter how powerful Killing Blade is, he’s no match for a perfect Half-step master. He won’t be able to produce the effect of an oppressive challenge. Back then, He Jiu didn’t dare try and pull off such a stunt, did he?”</p><p>“Perhaps Killing Blade wants to take on 10 masters at once?”</p><p>The streets were resounding with discussions as people analyzed the scenarios that might take place in the banquet tomorrow. The atmosphere was incredibly boisterous and enthusiastic, putting everyone in an elated mood as they looked forward to the next day.</p><p>Meng Qi’s courtyard, Duke Mightiness’ mansion.</p><p>Su Ziyue, after finding out about the banquet, went up to her brother in excitement. “Second Brother, you… you’re going to challenge all those masters on the Ranking List altogether tomorrow?”</p><p>“Who told you about it?” Meng Qi was seated on a rock stool, admiring the moon. His smile was warm and genial.</p><p>Ever since he found out that Su Ziyue was, in fact, his Master’s descendant and could be considered his cousin, he felt even closer to her.</p><p>Su Ziyue blinked at him. “No one told me but isn’t that normal? It’s the same with the Party of Happycloud…”</p><p>Her cheeks were red as an excited smile played at her lips. “Tomorrow I’ll be able to see one of your great battles and rising through the ranks in one shot!”</p><p>She paused momentarily and added, looking a little embarrassed, “Second Brother, am I disturbing you? You’re supposed to be adjusting your mental state and easing your spiritual state in preparation of the battle tomorrow…”</p><p>“Don’t worry about it. It wouldn’t take up too much of my time,” Meng Qi replied, grinning.</p><p>She seemed reassured after receiving Meng Qi’s affirmation and asked curiously, “Second Brother, how confident are you in succeeding in immediately rising through the ranks? How many opponents do you plan to challenge altogether tomorrow?”</p><p>He gently rapped the table, appearing rather laid back as he said, “Do you know what it means to rise through the ranks?”</p><p>“Of course.” She thought her brother was trying to test her. “It means opening the Hidden Latch between the eyebrows. If you don’t make stabilizations or adjustments and go straight into harmonizing your internal and external worlds, you can only succeed if your Inner World and its corresponding Dharma and Logos of Heaven and Earth are exceptionally close and harmonious. That’s because you’ll incur the wrath of heaven if you rise through the ranks and reach heaven in a single step.”</p><p>“Then do you know what realm one should reach in order to rise through the ranks at once after opening Nine Apertures?” Meng Qi sipped a mouthful of tea. His tone was gentle as if he was not at all concerned about the battle tomorrow. Instead, he appeared to be interested in instructing his sister.</p><p>Su Ziyue was still young and had yet to enlighten any Apertures. She shook her head. “I don’t know.”</p><p>Meng Qi tapped the table gently with his left hand and said, “When you’ve enlightened your Nine Apertures, your next step is enlightening your Primal Aperture between the brows. If you don’t have a good Kung Fu technique or make a hasty breakthrough before gaining Heaven-man Connection, you’ll be stuck at the Half-step Exterior Scenery realm. Your Inner and Outer Worlds will contradict and repel each other. It’ll be hard for you to harmonize both and your hopes of entering the Exterior realm will be minimal. You’ll be considered bad or a low-grade master.”</p><p>“That’s right, that’s right! I know that.” Su Ziyue nodded her head with fervor like a little chick pecking the ground. The aristocratic families in Luoyang all requested their disciples to make a breakthrough only after gaining Heaven-man Connection.</p><p>Meng Qi stared at the cold, bright moon as he continued, “It’s considered a major success to be able to enlighten your Primal Aperture at between the eyebrows. When your realm is stable, you’ll be able to become an ordinary Half-step master after your breakthrough. That can be considered a moderate success. Your Inner and Outer Worlds won’t contradict and repel each other, but since they’re not close enough, you’ll need to spend a lot of time adjusting and polishing them. That’s why some people can breakthrough straight to the Exterior but others can’t.”</p><p>“Once you’ve succeeded in enlightening your Primal Aperture between the brows, your next step is to comprehend heaven and earth, as well as harmonize your body and mind. Once your Inner and Outer World gradually harmonize, that means you’ve achieved Oneness of Heaven and Men. Your every move will carry a might close to that of an ordinary Half-step. If your realm reaches a consummate stage, you’ll be a perfect Half-step after your breakthrough and gain incredible strength. You’ll also have control over your Dharma and Logos of Heaven and Earth. That’ll make you a frightening opponent, far beyond the match of ordinary Half-step masters. However, these are the exceptional masters. Once they have gained enough experience, they’ll be able to make a smooth breakthrough.”</p><p>Su Ziyue listened attentively, not once interrupting.</p><p>“Once you reach the Oneness of Heaven and Men stage, you can adjust your Inner World if you have a tentative grasp of a path that suits you. When that’s done and you return to your original state, you’ve basically surpassed the state of your Inner World before your perfect Half-step breakthrough. It wouldn’t be enough to merely connect heaven and earth or have insufficient control over your Dharma and Logos. Only this will give you the foundation needed to rise through the ranks in one go. Martial artists need to have lofty ambitions. Even if you fail, you should to set it as a goal.” The moon bathed Meng Qi in a bright and clean light.</p><p>Su Ziyue’s eyes were gleaming as she asked curiously, “Second Brother, have you already returned to your true self?”</p><p>He raised his cup of tea and took another sip, merely smiling in response.</p><p>The wind at night was chilling and the moonlight was dazzling. Luoyang, after having experienced a chaotic day, returned to tranquility.</p><p>Meng Qi was basking in that tranquility now.</p><p>…</p><p>The next day, when court resumed in the Political Affairs Hall, Wang Wenxian and the other ministers were still disputing. Zhao Jingshi, who had guarded the Imperial Mausoleum last night, had returned to Luoyang and secretly visited Langya Duke’s mansion, Guangling Duke’s mansion, and the like. The Zhao family from Luoyang appeared to have lost the respect of the royal family entirely and stood out from the procession of the aristocratic families.</p><p>Inside a deserted courtyard, Gu Xiaosang was dressed in white and wore no makeup. She watched as the Grand Sun slowly took over the sky overhead and waited for all that happened in Luoyang to come to an end. Her manner was leisurely but alert; her expression one of tranquility.</p><p>Meanwhile, many Jianghu folks were gathered in a place somewhere nearby the Su family manor. Though they would not be able to attend the banquet and watch the battle unfold, they would be the first witnesses of a sign of Killing Blade’s rising through the ranks at once.</p><p>“Super Purple Sword Cui Zhe is here…”</p><p>“The Unstoppable is here… Look, so is Aunt Bai!”</p><p>“Wang Zai is here…”</p><p>“The zither fairy of the Ruan family is here too. Official Hong Lu has come as well…”</p><p>It was as if the quiet murmurs signaled the battle that was about to ensue – a dragon provoking a pack of tigers!</p><p>Just imagining the battle alone was enough to send their hearts thumping!</p><p>Carriage after carriage stopped next to the manor. Wang Zai, Cui Zhe, and the other invited masters nodded in greeting and noticed each other’s introverted momentum. Even if they were here to lend Meng Qi a helping hand, they should not shame their families in the battle later.</p><p>Aunt Bai, who was burning with eagerness, was first to enter the manor.</p><p>The location of the banquet was the martial arts hall in a side courtyard. It was a wide hall filled with tables, with Meng Qi seated in the prime spot as the host. Dressed in a green robe, he appeared open and honest. He smiled and nodded at his guests.</p><p>Su Li and Su Yue did not appear out of worry that they would hinder Meng Qi’s borrowing of the guests’ momentum and affect his breakthrough. They stayed in the background, ready to assist him and prevent any mishaps.</p><p>The guests took their seats one after another, engaging in idle chatter as they did so. Soon after, everyone invited had arrived. Yan Chong, Aunt Bai, Cui Zhe, and the others all stared at Meng Qi hopefully. It was time to begin.</p><p>Meng Qi gave them a small smile. “Rest easy, everyone. Please, first enjoy the performances and wine.”</p><p><em>“Huh? This is different from the Party of Happycloud…”</em> Everyone was stunned but put aside their surprise, thinking that this might just be a different way of receiving guests.</p><p>The sound of classical musical instruments drifted vividly through the air, accompanying the splendid performance by the dancers. The mellow and rich wine gave a gentle burn in the throat. However, no one at the banquet was in the mood to enjoy any of this.</p><p>Meng Qi gave a small wave when the performances were over, rustling his sleeve.</p><p>Aunt Bai closed her eyes. She could feel that the battle was about to start.</p><p>Meng Qi remained seated cross-legged, still exuding a carefree air. He smiled and said, “Contrary to your expectations, I didn’t invite you all here for a battle.”</p><p><em>“What?”</em> Yan Chong, Wang Zai, Cui Zhe, and the rest were dumbfounded. A rarely-seen frown appeared on Wang Siyuan’s face. It was as if he had understood something!</p><p>The corner of Meng Qi’s mouth raised into a faint smile.</p><p>“I’ve only invited you all here to attend a ritual.”</p><p>“Attend a ritual?” Wang Zai’s heart stirred but before he could think of anything, a pitch-black darkness fell over them.</p><p>Likewise, all the Jianghu folks outside the courtyard could no longer see a thing either.</p><p>“Huh?” Inside the Political Affairs Hall, all the ministers disputing were simultaneously stunned. It was dark everywhere around them too.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang, with her makeup-free face, lifted her head and her eyes reflected the pitch-black sky overhead. Her expression shifted ever so slightly, uncertain if out of alarm or surprise.</p><p>The Grand Sun had disappeared, leaving darkness to swallow the entire Luoyang!</p><p>Suddenly, Wang Zai saw a star emerge from the hands beside him. The star burned hot and bright, like a beautiful, dazzling flower.</p><p>He looked around in alarm and saw that stars had soared all around the guests inside the hall. The bright stars were like little lights, illuminating the darkness!</p><p>“This is…” Wang Wenxian and the other members of the Political Affairs Hall were momentarily speechless after seeing the soaring stars.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang appeared stunned. She extended her hand to touch the star not too far away above her head. Her delicate hand passed through the star, but the burning sensation was unmistakable. The star drifted between fantasy and reality.</p><p>Wang Zai stared at Meng Qi in amazement. He saw how Meng Qi was exuding the momentum of the Exterior realm. The area between his eyebrows split open, its crevice dark and deep.</p><p>His Inner World was nearly at the Exterior realm. He could have made a breakthrough a long time ago, and yet he had suppressed it until this moment?</p><p>Stars, one after another, appeared in Luoyang like the blossoming of flowers, shocking everyone. The scenery submerged everyone in a state of intoxicated wonder.</p><p>Meanwhile, inside the Sword Washing Pavilion northwest of the city, a burst of sword light flashed and broke through the binds, illuminating the land across hundreds of meters. Everything became desolate and tranquil all around, leaving only a few as witnesses to this.</p><p>In a hall full of a floral fragrance, three thousand guests were drunk. Unsheathed, the frosty sword reigned champion throughout 40 provinces!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
