His bloated skin was striped with odd marks that emitted a dim light. They seemed more like evil spirits than flying dragons.</p><p>There was a faint color of blood in the depths of his dark green eyes, which were frosty and full of murderous intent.</p><p>With each breath, the light around them dimmed. But unlike dark clouds gathering, it was more like thick, noxious black gas colouring the sky. If he had to compare, Meng Qi thought it was similar to the Demonworld Fragment that he and the others had visited in the past. In response to stress, his body’s emitted a pale golden glow to resist the black corrosive gas.</p><p>The black gas had made the remaining trees wither, turning the bricks to dust and cracking open the earth. Dead snakes,rats and insects littered the ground. The ordinary folk who had been unable to escape had all fallen dead on the ground, their skin had shriveled as if all moisture had been sucked from them.</p><p>He gazed at Du Huaishang, at large crimson hands, feeling the heat that could melt metal and rocks, a power that could turn a Yin to a Yang. Zuo Hanfeng stood in midair with his right hand outstretched holding the Precious Weapon that was similar to the dragon claw. Then, with a face of nonchalence, he clenched his fist and struck.</p><p>The fist was a deep blue, as cold as it was evil.</p><p>At the same time, deep blue scales appeared on the surface of Zuo Hanfeng’s body, covering him from head-to-toe, just like a human-shaped dragon. It seemed like the strength of the blood lineage had broken through some kind of limitation!</p><p>Bang!</p><p>As the single fist struck the hands, the crimson frosted over bit by bit. It was like seeing the formation of a gorgeous ice sculpture.</p><p>Du Huaishang flew backwards, dragging out a long flame tail. Half his body was a deep blue ice layer while the other half was threaded through by the black gas.</p><p>He had lost his usual calmness and looked stunned. <em>“How could this be? How could Zuo Hanfeng’s strength upgrade to this level?”</em></p><p><em>“This wasn’t stuff of the Ninth Order. He had almost reached the Sixth Order of Ground Level and his body had partially evolved devil blood lineage!”</em></p><p><em>“What on earth had made him so powerful?”</em></p><p>Zuo Hanfeng had two faint bulges protruding from his forehead, but they had yet to break skin. He stroked his bluish beard with his left hand as he gazed at the fist with which he had lashed out. With a rare smile, he said, “Great. Mr. Yin’s Dharma Access is really great, despite having to endure extreme torture to your body and Vital Spirit.”</p><p>He squinted,</p><p>“I can defeat you within three strokes!”</p><p>It was not the tone of someone who reckoned he was in the same level, but the tone of someone who already considered Du Huaishang a nobody.</p><p>He stepped out into the air and flew down to Du Huaishang. One fist was deep blue and the other was jet-black; they brought forth hail like rain. The rope-like black gas bound together the emptiness with terrifying power.</p><p>As Du Huaishang took a deep breath, his body radiated bursts of golden light. He looked like a small sun, driving off the black gas, melting the deep blue. He made mudra shapes with his ten fingers interlocked, as if setting forth some Dharma and Logos between heaven and earth.</p><p>A ray of sunlight broke through the dimness and shone on Du Huaishang. Behind him, a golden sun condensed, concealing a three-legged bird!</p><p>It was Dharma Form power!</p><p>After the Hidden Latch had broken open, what had been contained within manifested itself externally, triggering heaven and earth and also solidifying into existence the Dharma Form. Heavenly Knowing was omniscient and its power awesome, it was something like Xuan Bei’s “Kṣitigarbha Bodhisattva Form”, Crape Myrtle Star’s “Serissa Fighting Phase”, Su Wuming’s “The Grand Supreme Sword Body”, He Jiu’s “Formless Sword Qi” and Wang Siyuan’s “Tathāgata Buddha Figure”. If one cultivated the Buddha’s Palm, the Buddha’s image would be formed on each strike, and he would ultimately claim the the Golden Body of Buddha.</p><p>However, there were differences in the intricacies of how the Dharma Form was formed, and they would only grow more prominent as the days passed.</p><p>Other similar Dharma Forms were founded either on Dharmakoya bases, following improvements in the realm or even from the further refinement of an existing rare talent. However, these forms were initially very unstable and using them prematurely would easily damage their foundations leaving long term repurcussions. As such, prior to crossing the Celestial Ladder, experts of the Exterior rarely touched upon their Dharmakoya.</p><p>It was similar to the Descendants of Divine Devils who cultivated their own blood lineage. After breaking through certain limitations, their blood lineage could trigger heaven and earth and bring forth their blood lineage’s God and Devil image. It was at this critical juncture, Du Huaishang, unable to do much else, was left with applying the Pressing Art. This stimulated blood lineage and displayed his imaginary “Grand Sun Form”.</p><p>“Break!” He yelled aloud and pushed out with both hands, the Golden Crow spread its wings and the Grand Sun appeared on his body. In a flash, the glorious radiance broke through the dark, melting the ice layer and eliminating the black gas.</p><p>“Good move!” Zuo Hanfeng, surprisingly did not change his stance and continued fighting Du Huaishang with the same moves.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>As the explosion rang in the air, a mushroom-shaped cloud rose. A figure fell straight to earth crating a huge crater in the ground, boom! It was none other than Du Huaishang.</p><p>Du Huaishang had barely impacted the ground when he bounced up into the air. Jet black blood spewed from his mouth, before it turned deep blue and froze to ice.</p><p>He had put everything into it, but a single blow from Zuo Hanfeng’s twin fists had defeated him!</p><p>If they were not fighting each other mid-air, the aftershocks would have completely destroyed everything for miles around.</p><p>Aftershocks spread out in all directions, blowing away the clouds and raising a fierce wind. Zuo Hanfeng himself had a layer of golden flames that smoldered on surface of his body, yet somehow the dark blue scales were only scorched.</p><p>Just when the golden flames were about to go out, Jiang Zhiwei suddenly made her move. Skipping off the wall, she rose high into the air, slightly tiptoeing the top of a withered tree, and thrust upwards with her long sword.</p><p>The withered trees, upon contact, promptly disintegrated to dust.</p><p>The sword flashed and the world became dark, darker than shadow. All the light was concentrated into that one place. It overflowed with beauty. Nothing else mattered.</p><p>Heaven and earth were subtly altered as if everything had been forgotten. There was only one sword light in existence.</p><p>The Sword Qi surged out and parted the clouds. Even from a distance, one could see that the sword had sliced cleanly through and divided the dark.</p><p>Rows and rows of Qi induced gashes appeared on the ground.</p><p>Zuo Hanfeng had just beat back Du Huaishang, and had not yet the chance to extinguish the searing true fire, when he felt his Vital Spirit being absorbed. As the sword light swept by and attacked him, he seemed neither able to escape nor have any desire to do so.</p><p>However, he was in an abnormal situation where his current strength coupled with the golden flames burning on the surface of his body, he worried that he would not have the strength to fend off even the most basic attack.</p><p>He huffed, rising half an inch to allow the point of the blade to hit the center of his palm.</p><p>Poof! A drop of blue blood oozed out from the small hole that had appeared from of the scales at the the center of his palm. Jiang Zhiwei flew backward to the ground. Her right hand was trembling and her nose and mouth were bleeding and she had a layer of Frigid Crystal frozen over her body’s surface. She had taken quite a battering and should she fall to the ground, she might just break into pieces.</p><p>Grasping the long saber in his right hand, Meng Qi absorbed Jiang Zhiwei’s fall and helped her dissipate the chill. At the same time as he was Will-projecting, seizing the opportunity to remove the restraints on the replica “Yin-Yang Mirror” in his hand!</p><p>It was not the kind of sword you could use when you received it.</p><p>Zuo Hanfeng made a fist with his left hand. Even with his injury, he was waiting to eliminate the real flame. Just as he descended, he saw Du Huaishang heading towards him again.</p><p><em>“He fights desperately…”</em> He muttered inwardly and stretched his right hand unhurriedly, five fingers in concert with each other. He intended to defeat Du Huaishang in two or three strokes.</p><p>Even if Yin Lenghui and Zhou Yong had not repeatedly emphasized that they could not kill Du Huaishang, he still felt the “Ancestor”‘s terror. Surely, it was not so hard to deal with him!</p><p>He should have seized the chance to kill him even if he was injured!</p><p>Yin Lengfeng saw that Zou Liushou’s magnificent appearance, he secretly felt pleased. The Ancestor’s Dharma Access <em>did</em> work. Even if they had not completed the mission, it could greatly increase Zuo Hanfeng’s strength and help him defeat Du Huaishang without much effort.</p><p>Although Du Huaishang had only recovered 60 to 70 percent strength, the Ancestor’s Dharma Access must be the main reason!</p><p>As for Zhou Yong’s death, he did not feel torn up about it at all. Since he had was dead, was it now his turn to take over the Eminence throne and master the Dharma Access to communicate with Ancestor?</p><p>Thanks to these guys, I will grant them a swift death!</p><p>Feeling relaxed, his momentum increased and he subdued Qi Zhengyan and Zhao Heng in one stroke.</p><p>Suddenly, he heard a faint lilting melody which gave him the feeling of a bright moon in the night and the surface of a tranquil lake. His body felt like it was frosting over, as if even his Vital Spirit was being frozen stiff!</p><p>Guanghan Curse!</p><p>Yin Lenghui was slow to react, but was still surprised and startled. The lady who played the zither had not involved Zuo Hanfeng, but had come to deal with him!</p><p>The, the sequence was wrong!</p><p>Ruan Yushu had reached Eight Acupores. She had strength leftover to play the Guanghan Curse after playing the 12 Magical Sounds of Langhuan. However, her target had switched to Yin Lenghui!</p><p>Since Zuo Hanfeng’s strength was beyond expectation, they had to join together, gathering all their power as soon as possible. They had to kill Yin Lenghui first!</p><p>Meng Qi was trying to control the secret treasure, preventing Yin Lenghui’s strange and unpredictable Voodoo art from disturbing him. It was their chance to win!</p><p>After all, Du Huaishang could still resist Zuo Hanfeng with the assistance of Sister Zhiwei. After playing the Guanghan chill, she would stimulate her Blood Essence immediately to help them!</p><p>As the chill entered his spirit, Yin Lenghui’s mind numbed. His response from movement to thought slowed.</p><p>Normally, this kind of slowness did would affect him, but he was being assaulted by two masters at once.</p><p>They could take the chance to kill him! Feeling the pain of the fracture of his left arm, Zhao Heng brandished the long sword. He seemed to turn into a fiery dragon, twining up to the Nine Heavens. He had burned off the black gas and Gu Poison Bug around Yin Lenghui.</p><p>In a blink of an eye, Qi Zhengyan slashed down with his Dragon Stripe Golden Sword, his face stoic. It was not the purple star river in the sky this time, but the falling snow. Each snowflake appeared to be a sharp sword and stabbed into Yin Lenghui’s body, spraying fresh blood which burst into bloody ice flowers.</p><p>Under the “Snow Blizzard”, Yin Lenghui seemed to be reaching his end. But just at this moment, his body collapsed, dissolving into viscous blood. A black light rose in the distance and the Vital Spirit appeared to combine with the body again along Devil Qi.</p><p>Voodoo act was indeed strange!</p><p>Suddenly, Yin Lenghui became stiff, with unfathomable expression in his eyes. The black light vanished and the Vital Spirit froze into ice.</p><p>It was impossibe. The sword stroke should not have had such a strange effect! It should not make the Devil Qi fade spontaneously!</p><p>As the deep blue rose, the Vital Spirit felt to the ground, turning into countless ice chips.</p><p>Yin Lenghui died with a grievance in his heart.</p><p>Knowing that Yin Lenghui had been defeated, Zhao Heng, Qi Zhengyan and Ruan Yushu immediately switched their target to Zuo Hanfeng.</p><p>The fighting had previously be quick and rapid. Jiang Shenghong and Lan Die who were guarding the periphery in the distance had clearly seen the battle progress. When they found that Zhou Yong had been killed and were about to rush out to assist the others, Yin Lenghui was also killed.</p><p>Lan Die trembled all over, not believing that Zhou Yong would die so easily. Her expression transforming, she suddenly turned round and ran madly into the crowd.</p><p>She knew that Zhou Yong had the Yin-Yang Mirror and Zuo Hanfeng might not win, so she abandoned him and ran to save her skin.</p><p>Seeing that Lan Die had defected and Zuo Hanfeng seemed to have become a evil spirit, Jiang Shenghong was bewildered. He had no idea whether he should believe in the Left Governer’s strength or rush to his aid immediately.</p><p>Pah! Meng Qi heard the sound when the seal being broken. What a wonderful sound!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
