Meanwhile, he launched himself into the air, jade eyes glowing, and savagely extended his right hand.</p><p>He was known as Jade Eye Flying Dragon, with the natural blood lineage of Dragon. When he exerted his moves, the scales in the back of his hands glowed wit dark blue light. With five breaths of his powerful Qi, claws extended, he soared toward the courtyard as if cleaving through the sky.</p><p>It was bitterly cold. Snowflakes fluttered through the air; trees shed their leaves, fresh greenness turning to yellow. Even the evergreen conifers were covered with a layer of frigid ice which made them look like ice sculptures. As if frozen in time, it made a beautiful, dream-like picture.</p><p>The whole yard seemed as if it had been transported to the North Pole, its walls and tiles giving off a dark blue light – it looked just like an ice palace.</p><p>The temperature fell sharply, making them shiver. The weakest had died on this ground. If Zuo Hanfeng had not concentrated on using his power, the nearby surroundings would have become a lifeless ice world.</p><p>Just as the five powerful Qi was about to grasp the roof of the first house, rays of golden light suddenly burst forth. A fist of mud shattered on the roof, freezing its the surrounding air as it hit the cold light.</p><p>The Grand Sun rose in the east, melting the ice and snow. They transformed into rain and poured down from the sky.</p><p>“Good!” Zuo Hanfeng was delighted that the man was Du Huaishang. He planned to exert all of his strength in a straight-forward battle, he did not want any sneak attacks.</p><p>At the exact moment, a majestic voice broke through the sky, reverberating inside his Vital Spirit.</p><p>It was a voice that he had heard singing in his blood, a voice he devoutly worshipped and yearned for.</p><p>It was the voice of a Dragon’s Cry. The Dragons’ Vast Cries!</p><p>The power of the real dragon completely surpassed the inferior masters. In that moment, his control over the power of his blood lineage wavered and Zuo Hanfeng trembled, fighting the impulse to keel on the ground. He struggled to maintain his balance and not from the sky. Although his Vital Spirit could not match those of masters who had broken through Primal Aperture at Mid-brows, Zuo Hanfeng still had the strength of an Exterior master and could respond, unlike Jiang Hengchuan who was frozen by the immense power.</p><p>But now the enemy was at the same Stair with him. He was Peacekeeping Heavenly King of the Ninth Order of Earth Rank!</p><p>Du Huaishang was like a God coming from the sky, golden light surrounding his body. He leaped through the air, punching his fist in the air.</p><p>This fist seemed to get the point of some Dharma and Logos. The surrounding light enveloped it, making it look like a Grand Sun. It burned and gave out a harsh light, which melted the frozen landscape, aimed at Zuo Hanfeng’s chest.</p><p>“Wizz, wizz, wizz.” A dragon’s claw appeared in Zuo Hanfeng’s front, glowing a chilly dark blue light. A gentle wave and layers of ice solidified.</p><p>The Precious Weapon automatically protected their wielder!</p><p>“Puff!” The”Grand Sun” broke through layers of ice leaving a gaping hole. Zuo Hanfeng immediately responded, extending his left hand whose strength could topple the mountains and overturn the seas. The wind and snow swirled and blocked the Grand Sun.</p><p>The wind and snow all dissipated. Zuo Hanfeng was at a disadvantage and Du Huaishang was not going to spare him. Du Huaishang attacked using his palms one after the other as he sang the requiem. His moves were like the bolts of burning rain, sparkling and brilliant.</p><p>But with the help of the precious weapon, Zuo Hanfeng was as calm as before and he defended himself well. At the same time, he dilated his blood vessels, refreshing his Vital Spirit to get rid of the effects of 12 Magical Sounds of Langhuan.</p><p>The moment Zuo Hanfeng attacked, Yin Lengfeng and Zhou Yong jumped into action.</p><p>Yin Lengfeng jumped nimbly into the yard, without even needing to touch the ground. But just as he had crossed over, a long sword swung towards him, carried by the great momentum of “Enforcing justice on behalf of Heaven”. It battled against Yin Lengfeng’s Voodoo, so much so that it felt like the whole world was repulsing him and it was difficult for him to be at full strength.</p><p>His waved his left arm and the sleeve tore, exposing his terrifying arm.</p><p>It was an arm made of baby heads, each of which spat out black gas. A cold, evil air surrounded them.</p><p>Yin Lengfeng had forged his left arm into a whip. As he waved his left arm, turbulent gusts of air whipped about, carrying the sound of mournful cries that penetrated one’s heart.</p><p>The surroundings burned with Yin fire. They did not burn inanimate things leaving the walls unscathed while the weeds withered.</p><p>A bright golden spot shone in Zhao Heng’s mid-brows. Like virtuousness, it protected his Vital Spirit and defended him against the baby cries.</p><p>The long sword met the bone whip. Enforcing justice on behalf of the heaven and annihilating the evil, it promptly eliminated the black gas. However, Yin Lengfeng’s whip moved unnaturally and entwined around the long sword, as if intending to trap the long sword.</p><p>At the exact moment, a Purple Star River composed of stars flowed from the side. Bright and clear stars shone resplendently, enveloping Yin Lengfeng’s torso.</p><p>The Star River rapidly swirled and the position where Yin Lengfeng stood was turned into a black hole. Even with a strong body, it was like going through a meat grinder!</p><p>Suddenly, Zhao Heng made a fist and struck out to the side. The air behind him coalesced and transformed into a dragon. A bright light flowed around his body, illuminating his dignity.</p><p>As his fist flew, the flying dragon jumped. The ground shook and walls collapsed.</p><p>“Poof!” His left fist seemed to have impacted something and a figure appeared.</p><p>The figure did not wear two sleeves. His left arm was made of the skulls of babies, while his right hand seemed to be merely made of skin without flesh and blood. He was Yin Lengfeng! He was Yin Lengfeng who was trapped in Purple Star River!</p><p>As the Purple Star River disappeared, an object fell down. It was a wooden stake!</p><p>Voodoo was indeed bizarre!</p><p>Just when Zhao Heng was about to launch another attack, his facial expression suddenly changed. Without a second thought, he wielded the long sword in his right hand and cut off his own left arm. Blood gushed out.</p><p>Even as his left arm fell down to the earth, the skin swelling oddly and releasing an eerie, sizzling sound. Insects climbed out as they shook their heads and wagged their tails. Glowing with colorful light, they looked like centipedes and snakes, but were as tiny as finger.</p><p>Zhao Heng hurriedly stepped back, immediately blocking his blood flow. He wielded his long sword with great strength and his Qi broke through, releasing a burst of flames and burning the insects to a crisp.</p><p>Yin Lengfeng had not managed to launch an attack when Qi Zhengyan wielded a sword to attack Yin Lengfeng.</p><p>Harnessing both softness and hardness, the Purple Star River ran into Ruyi Sceptre. Azure Blizzard had caused the chilly coldness, so he failed to break through in a short time.</p><p>“Crack!” Purple Star River made such spluttered. It was the sound of Gu Poison Bugs being crushed as they failed to break through this layer of defense.</p><p>Zhao Heng collected himself and ran the Emperor’s Swordsmanship. Together with Qi Zhengyan, they aided each other to control Yin Lengfeng.</p><p>Zhou Yong, the man who had closed his eyes, “glanced at” Du Huaishang who was in the air, then palmed a ring from his left hand, saving it just in case. Then, he attacked Du Huaishang from the other side.</p><p>Distracted by the battle between these masters of the Exterior, he could not sense the condition inside the yard. Instead, he could only roughly judge their positions and had in mind to attack the man enveloped by burning fire and the girl in green who was trying to besiege Yin Lengfeng.</p><p>When he arrived, he found that Meng Qi had turned around and was throwing something out. Illuminated by a glowing light, it looked like a snake.</p><p><em>“A rope?”</em> Zhou Yong had not expected that Meng Qi to turn around so easily even when he was rushing towards Yin Lengfeng. Turns out his judgement was misguided and Meng Qi seemed to be well prepared!</p><p>The rope was divided into numerous sections, each of which was carved with the patterns of Buddha Print.</p><p>Before Zhou Yong could react, he was tightly bound. The Buddha print glowed and changed colors. These prints locked his Vital Spirit, genuine Qi and flesh, making it difficult for him to even kill himself!</p><p><em>“A secret precious weapon? A secret precious weapon that could attack masters of the Exterior?”</em> Zhou Yong opened his eyes, but they were not veiled, calm nor full of the intent to kill at all. Instead, he was completely and entirely shocked.</p><p><em>“They wasted such a secret precious weapon!”</em></p><p><em>“Should it have been used to attack Zuo Hanfeng?”</em></p><p>He had thought the enemies would defend Zuo Hanfeng, the expert of the Exterior first anyway. He had not expected that the secret precious weapon was used to defend him! The enemies must have many secret precious weapons to use them so lavishly.</p><p>He tried to struggle. But even a normal expert of the Exterior could not escape God-tying Rope. As he became anxious and the more frantic his movements, the tighter he was bound.</p><p>At this moment, a flash of sword light came into his eyes. It was such pure malevolence that it made him shiver.</p><p><em>“It’s over…”</em></p><p><em>“No! I’m not willing!”</em></p><p>He was bitter. Before he could use any trick, he was killed by the sword!</p><p><em>“I should have used my secret precious weapon right in the beginning!”</em></p><p>The sword light hit his mid-brows and ground his Vital Spirit. Trapped by God-tying Rope, Zhou Yong was like a lamb brought to the slaughter in front of Jiang Zhiwei’s sword. He could not escape.</p><p>At the exact moment, an evil breath rose from the depths of Zhou Yong’s Vital Spirit. It vaulted past layers of air and brought a powerful force!</p><p>At such a long “distance”, the bloody smell filled Meng Qi and Jiang Zhiwei’s noses. Their Vital Spirits seemed as if soaked in the blood and they were numb, cold and shivering.</p><p><em>“I cannot let him land!”</em> It was the only thought in Meng Qi’s mind. Without worrying about exposing his identity, he drew his Heaven Inflicted Pain with his right hand and flew at Zhou Yong.</p><p><em>“I must kill Zhou Yong and cut the connection before he lands!”</em></p><p>Black clouds gathered and the lightning flashed across the sky. The thunderous boom shocked the devils and ghosts on the ground.</p><p>A long saber fell down from the high sky like a lightning, its descent a perfect combination of quickness, slowness, lightness, heaviness and violence.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>Thunderclaps converged and transformed into Green Thunders in the width of a bucket.</p><p><em>“Boom, Boom, Boom…”</em></p><p>Five Green Thunders ran down, one after another and merged into the long saber which cut Zhou Yong apart.</p><p>Constrained by the God-tying Rope, Zhou Yong’s genuine Qi and Vital Spirit failed to integrate when he landed, so the great force had not split the air.</p><p>“BOOM!”</p><p>The long blade split Zhou Yong into two pieces and flashes of lightning swallowed his body.</p><p>Green Thunder was of pure violence and brutality. It was the bane of all the evils. Any sinister, malignent breath was defeated after a futile struggle.</p><p>The great force lost its connection and gradually dispersed in the air.</p><p>A chilling sound reverberated in the air.</p><p>Meng Qi gasped as he put out his left hand to catch the object surrounded by lightning.</p><p>It was a Space Ring with a fissure, and an ancient mirror. It front and back each represented Yin and Yang and contained the force of killing.</p><p><em>“An imitation of ‘Yin-Yang Mirror’?”</em> Meng Qi suddenly understood and was frightened.</p><p><em>“If Zhou Yong had first used ‘Yin-Yang Mirror’, he would have killed at least one of my companions. And I’m not sure whether the Yang side could had saved him or her…”</em></p><p>Exchanging a glance with Jiang Zhiwei, they both saw the sadness and pity. Zhou Yong had practiced his skills for many years, but before he could execute any trick, he had died. If they had been him, they would have died just like him.</p><p>The frightening secret precious weapons and the dangerous Samsara!</p><p>The stories of apotheosis suddenly came to Meng Qi. Even for those Dharmakaya or masters above Dharmakaya, should they lose their precious weapons, they would be defeated by those Disciples whose realm and strength were both inferior to theirs…</p><p><em>“Luckily, my Eight Nine Mysteries can defend against the attacks of precious weapons. Yang Jian, Yang Erlang were really our shining examples!”</em></p><p>At the same time, Zuo Hanfeng freed himself from the effects of “Dragons’ Vast Cries” and witnessed Zhou Yong’s death.</p><p>His gaze turned cold and his breath became slow but he did not stop growing. His clothes were burst apart and his skin, covered with eerie patterns, showed through.</p><p>They flashed a dark light and seemed to mean something extraordinary.</p><p>The coldness radiated to such a point that Du Huaishang’s was covered with a layer of frigid ice. It took a long time for it to melt.</p><p>“I still need two or three days to master, but it is powerful enough to kill you.” Zuo Hanfeng said coldly.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
