It was as if the vast Gobi Desert had appeared in front of his eyes again. Sand and stones flew everywhere, and the gray-robed novice monk was there for him, even though tens of millions of people still passed away.</p><p>Looking back on the past, it was still vivid in his mind. He had once been in high spirits, chivalrous and courageous. The pain and suffering of the past, the hatred and self-blame, slowly flowed through Gu Changqing’s mind. It was as if a long time had passed, he could now look at them more calmly.</p><p>No, it was not “Like”, it was true. That newborn calf that did not know the immensity of Heaven and earth had left the boundless sea and the Gobi Desert for several decades. To an ordinary person, it could almost be from rebirth to death!</p><p>As time passed, it always urged one to grow old, and it always made people like to reminisce..</p><p>Now, he was a great grandmaster at the top of the Earth Roll, the Divine Constable in charge of the central plains of the six doors sect, and had a high position and power. Moreover, he also had the “Divine Book of the emissary of the true king of the nine heavens”that the human emperor had personally bestowed upon him. Once he used it.., he would immediately receive the temporary bestowment of the heaven sealing platform and the reinforcement of the Great Zhou’s Dragon Qi. For a short period of time, he would obtain the power of an Earth immortal at the level of Immortal Gong or immortal Bo. There would be very few people who could resist him in the pugilistic world. In the future, if he was unable to master martial arts.., the Human Emperor had already hinted that he could turn away from the divine path.</p><p>Although no one said it explicitly, he knew very well that this kind of attention was still related to the little novice monk from back then, and the one sitting in the hollow jade temple of Mount Kunlun now..</p><p>Just as Gu Changqing was immersed in his memories, shaking the baby girl in a daze, the universal common sense charm on his body suddenly made a strange sound.</p><p>“Divine Constable Gu, there’s something I need you to make a decision on.”A constable with a Golden Badge’s voice came out.</p><p>“What is it?”Gu Changqing collected his thoughts and asked calmly.</p><p>Constable Jin Zhang had originally answered, “The two core disciples of the Huan Hua Sword sect killed people on the street today. Although they have reasons, they still have to be handed over to the Ministry of Justice for a verdict. Now that they have confirmed where they are staying, I don’t know if we should go and get them. After all, they are the core disciples of the Huan Hua Sword sect…”</p><p>The successive disciples were the core members of a large sect. Dealing with them was the same as dealing with the sect they belonged to. The Huan Hua Sword sect was well-known in the various provinces of Dajin. Constable Jin Zhang followed the old rules and hesitated for a moment.</p><p>Although the Huan Hua Sword sect could not cause any waves in the world today, they were still capable of finding ways to take revenge on those who had gone through it.</p><p>Gu Changqing had always abhorred evil because of what had happened in the past, he said in a deep voice, “The state has its own laws. How can the rules of the sect be abandoned? “Under the rule of the human emperor, it is the land of the king. Even the sect leader of the Huan Hua Sword sect has to abide by the laws, let alone the two true disciples? “You sent people directly to the door to capture the important criminals and send them to the Ministry of Justice. I believe the local leaders of the Huan Hua Sword sect will understand.”</p><p>Before the six doors sect had developed into a huge monster, Gao Lan had split it up and separated the part of interrogating and interrogating the criminals from the part of taking care of the criminals, using the name of the Ministry of Justice before the appearance of the six doors sect.</p><p>“Yes, your subordinate,”Constable Jin Zhang replied respectfully.</p><p>With this request, even if the Huan Hua Sword sect complained, they couldn’t blame their own family. Divine Constable Gu had already taken the blame. With his strength and background, who would dare to cause trouble for him?</p><p>It wasn’t that Gu Changqing didn’t understand what his subordinate was thinking, but as a superior, as the divine constable in charge of the Central Province, it was his duty to take the blame.</p><p>He cut off the contact and saw his wife, Tang Ziyue, looking over, so he nodded slightly and said, “It’s just a small matter in the six doors. Don’t mind it.”</p><p>Tang Ziyue responded with a faint smile and suddenly frowned, “There’s another letter from the Gu family castle in the west. I hope you can go back and take a look…”</p><p>Before she finished her words, Gu Changqing said resolutely, “Don’t Bother!”</p><p>Tang Ziyue didn’t say anything more. She lowered her head and touched Gu Sutong’s little face. She said with a smile, “Father has just gotten a new jar of hundred-year-old carefree wine. He wants you to have a taste of it.”</p><p>Although she had changed back to the Tang surname, how could she forget the kindness she had brought up for so many years? She still respected Su Li as her father and treated the Su family’s ancestral home as her mother’s home. She often came back to live. At the same time, she took her child to Shaolin temple to visit Xuan Bei every year.</p><p>Gu Changqing nodded and exhaled. The restlessness in his heart had disappeared. This was his home, his life. The Gu family fort in the West had nothing to do with him anymore!</p><p>… ..</p><p>The rockery was covered in Moss, and water dripped down slowly. The courtyard of the Huan Hua Sword sect always had a poetic atmosphere.</p><p>“The arrest documents for the six doors have been delivered to the door.”A fat man in his early twenties wearing a brocade robe looked at the elder in front of him with a distressed expression. “Martial uncle Mu, what should we do?”</p><p>“What else can we do? Follow the six doors. Your matter will be decided by the Ministry of Justice. I will get someone to help you plead your case.”The person who spoke was a woman with an exquisite and magnanimous appearance, dressed like a lady, her lotus-root dress was simple and elegant, refreshing and natural. She was precisely Mu Yun Le, who currently had the highest chance of becoming a dharma body for the Huan Hua Sword sect.</p><p>“HMPH, the evil young master molested a virtuous woman on the street. He deserves to die! Does the six doors want to help the wicked!”The young man with disheveled hair next to the little fatty said through gritted teeth.</p><p>Mu Yunle looked at him with a smile that was not a smile. “Don’t tell me you want to rebel against the Great Zhou Imperial Court?”</p><p>The two young men were instantly speechless and did not dare to make a sound. There was a god three feet above their heads!</p><p>The legend of the arrival of the human emperor had said that the Great Zhou’s atmosphere had already been established. The way of the king was deeply rooted in the sects and aristocratic families. There was no way to resist it!</p><p>Mu Yunle saw their appearance and sighed in his heart. In the past, the top sects and aristocratic families were above the law. The flourishing state of replacing them with the sect rules was gone for good.</p><p>In the past ten years, the successive disciples had obviously lost the arrogance of the big sects, but they also lost the boldness brought about by their heritage. They became a little timid, which had both advantages and disadvantages.</p><p>Thinking of this, her voice became gentle. “Don’t worry. As long as there is a reason for this, with the Supreme Dao Supervision and the Zhongzhou heroes overseeing the situation here, I will definitely not wrongly accuse you. The sect will certainly have more influence.”</p><p>The little fatty grimaced for a while before he said, “Since martial uncle Mu has said so, I’m relieved. I’ll just treat it as going to the heavenly prison to cultivate for a period of time. It’s just that…”</p><p>When he said this.., his gaze suddenly became pitiful. “It’s just that the prison is bitter. I’m afraid there’s no good wine or food. I’ve let down this concept. Martial Uncle Mu, please come and visit often. Remember to bring along the eight flavors Linglong cake from the Yuan family’s Taotie restaurant and the green flower seeds under the Moon…”</p><p>A series of gourmet names popped up like fried beans. In the end, the little fatty rubbed his stomach and actually felt hungry.</p><p>Lang ya’s Yuan family’s ‘Gluttony restaurant’was available in all the prefectures and cities. Many pastries and snacks could also be bought on the myriad realm general knowledge talisman. It could be said that it was the number one food shop in the Great Zhou, and it was on par with their family’s bank.</p><p>Mu Yun Le held back his laughter and said, “Alright, Alright. As an elder, and coincidentally passing by Shen Du, I can only take care of you a little.”</p><p>The little fatty said with satisfaction, “Martial Uncle Mu, you’re really good. You have a good personality, good looks, and good martial arts. You can draw with a brush and compose poems when you see the scenery.”</p><p>When he mentioned this, the little fatty remembered his master’s advice and smiled jokingly. “It’s just that your standards are a little too high. There are so many followers but you don’t even take a second look. I really don’t know what kind of dao partner you’re looking for…”</p><p>Mu Yunle was stunned when he heard that. His gaze passed through the rockery dripping with rock water and through patches of green. It was as if he could see that powerful and reliable figure, but it was filled with deep sorrow and pain. He could not help but feel pity for him.</p><p>Once he went to Penglai, he would no longer be a mortal.</p><p>“What kind of dao partner do I want to look for… him, he has to be able to compete with immortal venerate Yuan Huang…”Mu Yunle’s voice was a little misty and a little melancholic.</p><p>The little fatty immediately broke into laughter. “Martial uncle Mu, you, you’ve been influenced by the poetry and the painting. It’s not, it’s not realistic. Who in this world can be compared to the venerated immortal Yuan Huang?”</p><p>That’s right, who can be compared to him? Mu Yunle retracted his gaze, sighed lightly, and flicked his sleeves:</p><p>“You guys can leave. Don’t let the constables of six doors sect wait for too long.”</p><p>..</p><p>Chang le of the Great Zhou dynasty stood in front of the window with his hands behind his back, listening to the reports from his subjects.</p><p>“With the supervision of the Supreme Dao, the evil and unorthodox are becoming more and more secretive and secretive, not revealing the slightest bit of clues… the law and the law have infiltrated the aristocratic families and sects, and there are no more situations where they attack without a word of disagreement… however, this way, the exterior scenes and above are still fine. Young people at the awakening stage can explore the boundless desert, the Eastern Sea and the southern wilderness, and even the major star areas. Other than challenging each other to a battle, they can no longer find enemies to hone their skills. This is quite a hidden danger to the development of martial arts…”</p><p>Gao Lan nodded his head:</p><p>“I know that I have been doing my best to support virtual reality. Now that I have succeeded, I am able to carry out virtual battles at the level of enlightenment and below.”</p><p>Then, he looked out of the window and muttered to himself:</p><p>“It has been almost half a year…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
