Then, they saw the layers of formations as if nothing was there and penetrated through them directly. The killing intent that filled the light golden barrier made it seem as if it was stuck in a quagmire, it was unusually slow, revealing many flaws that should not have existed.</p><p>It was the same for the defense of the Secret Isolation Hall. There was no way to stop the two beams of white light from shooting down. It lit up the darkness in the room, rendering it cold and merciless.</p><p>Gao Lan, who was sitting on the throne, had his eyes closed. A golden lamp was gradually fading around him. The Aura of doom was drifting around him. He seemed to have no reaction to the changes in the outside world and could only be butchered.</p><p>The “Glorious twin stars”had been famous for many years. They had always been called the role models of the current heroes and heroes. It seemed that the winner and loser would be decided today.</p><p>At this moment, a figure suddenly flashed out of the shadow next to the throne. He was wearing a golden robe and had his hair tied up in a bun.</p><p>He waved his hand and immediately pulled out a scroll that emitted an immutable aura. It had the feeling of suppressing the current world and protecting the new era.</p><p>This was a scroll that had the head and tail of a black and white yin-yang fish entangled together. Since the world had yet to open and the chaos had yet to differentiate between yin and yang, it was also described from the beginning to the end. Then, it was described by the Great Dao that came from nothing,</p><p>the scroll shook and turned into a golden bridge that crossed the sea of bitterness and connected the entire time. It was as if one was on the other shore.</p><p>Outside the Golden Bridge, yin and Yang were in chaos. Earth, water, wind, and fire raged. Anyone who got close to it would be pacified. The Sea of bitterness would not invade, and the tribulations would not fall!</p><p>The two white lights of the immortal-slaying flying knife shot over, but they suddenly slowed down and were suppressed by the Golden Bridge!</p><p>The Supreme Treasure of the other shore, the Taiji diagram!</p><p>Outside the thirty-third heaven, the Great Scarlet Heaven’s supreme clarity realm was the world-suppressing item!</p><p>The one guarding Gao Lan in the dark was the golden-horned boy from Tuoshu Palace!</p><p>The immortal-slaying flying knives were impenetrable, and the golden lamps were extinguished one by one. Gao Lan was about to succeed, but Han Guang’s expression did not change. Instead, he nodded slightly. “So that’s the person behind him…”</p><p>One of the three pure ones, the heavenly venerate of morality, the ancient person on the other shore. He could even add the word ‘most’!</p><p>A smile appeared on the corner of Han Guang’s mouth again. He looked at the heaven-sealing platform. He was not surprised that he had failed. After all, there was still a chess piece.</p><p>As long as Zhao Heng combined the god Ascension Rankings and the heaven sealing platform into one, allowing his plan to borrow the chicken to lay eggs to succeed, the heaven sealing platform would immediately break away from Gao Lan’s control and no longer belong to him, and the reason why Gao Lan was able to obtain enough “His and my imprints”so quickly was all because the heaven sealing platform had fused with the power of the real world and the Earth, connecting with the universe of ten thousand worlds and spreading out the radiance of humanity.</p><p>Even though the moment the “He I imprints”were formed, they truly belonged to themselves, and it wasn’t something that could make “Them”disappear just by taking away the heaven sealing platform, but at the crucial moment.., losing the heaven sealing platform would definitely cause gao LAN’s “He I imprints”to be shaken. There wouldn’t be any room for mistakes, and he would fall at the last step.</p><p>This was his own “Mistake”, and it wasn’t something that the Taiji diagram could protect him from!</p><p>Of course, if Gao Lan succeeded in proving the legend, the shaking from the heaven sealing platform would definitely not affect his realm.</p><p>Just as Han Guang’s gaze was focused on Zhao Heng, an illusory river that flowed calmly suddenly appeared in his eyes. His original body naturally manifested the image of the ethereal celestial emperor, stepping on the time and occupying the top of everything.</p><p>Just as he made a response, he felt the fluctuation of time in the world. The gradually disappearing golden lamps lit up one by one, and then quickly extinguished.</p><p>“I am Emperor Qing.”</p><p>“I am Taihao.”</p><p>A low voice suddenly sounded, echoing throughout the universe. It was ethereal and grand, as if it came from countless branches of the future. The almighty experts in the fierce battle could not help but feel a momentary delay, or even a pause.</p><p>“I am Emperor Qing.”</p><p>“I am Taihao.”</p><p>Standing on the heaven-sealing platform, Zhao Heng felt that his vision suddenly became hazy and illusory, as if there were ripples of water light. Many human figures quickly went against the flow from different depths, passing through the waves and approaching in an instant, gradually condensing into one, it was a handsome Daoist wearing a strange green robe.</p><p>He seemed to have ignored the “Splendid Mountains and rivers painting”and was able to descend directly onto the heaven-sealing platform because he had entered before the “Splendid Mountains and rivers painting”was opened in the future!</p><p>The more the handsome Daoist’s figure “Approached”, the more realistic it became. It was as if he had gotten rid of countless possibilities and gradually returned to being the only one.</p><p>At this time, the world suddenly lost its color. The void highlighted the rolling river of time. In the illusory river water, there was a green-blue Buddha with a perfect Buddhist light upstream, a tall and thin Daoist with a bamboo crown on his head and eyes narrowed into a line, there were all kinds of figures, and in the branches of the river in the future, there was only a handsome young man in a green robe.</p><p>These figures looked at the sky at the same time and looked at the outside world from the river of time. At the same time, they let out a grand and solemn voice:</p><p>“I am the Green Emperor.”</p><p>“I am Tai Hao.”</p><p>The voices overlapped, coming from the past and the future, causing the entire river of time to vibrate. The time was either fast or slow, making the real world lose its color completely.</p><p>The Azure Emperor’s attainment of Dao was not in his year, but today!</p><p>The opportunity was in the future, and success was in the present. The path to the other shore was so illogical!</p><p>And with layers of concealment, the plan to deceive the world was finally revealed!</p><p>In the secret land, Lu Ya’s entire face was covered with a layer of scarlet gold. Hot Steam Rose, melting the void and breaking the rules. He burned the last seal with great difficulty and then bowed deeply.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>The secret land was spinning, as if it was about to collapse. The two lights on the grass man’s head and feet quickly dimmed, and the blood-colored body became clearer. It was Emperor Qing’s handsome face, but compared to the outside world, it was full of distortion, it was full of pain.</p><p>Crash!</p><p>The long river of time shook everywhere, and the legendary phenomenon didn’t disappear as scheduled. Suddenly, Emperor Qing, who was about to return to the current node, let out a muffled groan, as if he had been shot by an invisible arrow.</p><p>The Curse Treasure, the Nail Head Seven Arrow Book!</p><p>Green Emperor’s eyes showed fatigue, confusion, and sleepiness. As the great divine arts practitioner closest to the other shore, sleepiness itself was not normal.</p><p>When Meng Qi saw this scene and saw the god Ascension Board in Zhao Heng’s hand, his heart skipped a beat. He suspected that Green Emperor had messed up the plot of Lu Ya’s nail head seven arrow book when he was trying to reach the other shore!</p><p>What should he do?</p><p>This level of battle had already surpassed Meng Qi’s realm, and he couldn’t think of anything at the moment. But at this moment, Emperor Qing suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood essence. Its color was gorgeous and extremely brilliant, and it didn’t seem like the damage caused by the nailing head seven arrow book, instead, it seemed like he spat it out voluntarily.</p><p>This mouthful of blood essence condensed in the air and was pressed down by Emperor Qing, who had a solemn expression, from both sides. In an instant, it changed into a few strange sigil seals, and then it stretched into a dark red vortex.</p><p>As soon as the vortex appeared, it seemed to have connected with a secret object and was about to summon it.</p><p>Creak, Creak, Creak. A sound that made one’s teeth ache and heart tremble rang out. The Dark Red Vortex split into two and spun crazily. It was extremely chaotic, like a pair of cold and merciless eyes. Just by looking at it from afar.., meng Qi had a feeling that every thought and every thought was independent of each other and fought with each other.</p><p>The Monster of the Heavenly Dao! Meng Qi suppressed his mind with Wuji and Yuan Xin, mumbling to himself in surprise.</p><p>The azure emperor could actually summon that mysterious monster of the Heavenly Dao!</p><p>Ah!</p><p>As soon as the chaotic dark red eyes appeared, Lu Ya, who was in the secret land, let out a blood-curdling scream. He held his head in extreme pain, almost rolling on the ground. Meanwhile, the face of the Scarecrow began to blur, and the lamps above his head and under his feet began to shine again.</p><p>Han Guang’s heart trembled, but he didn’t show it on the outside. He suddenly opened his mouth and shouted loudly,</p><p>“Zhao Heng, why aren’t you doing anything? !”</p><p>He was only a few feet away from the god Ascension rankings and the Heaven Ascension platform merging into one.</p><p>Zhao Heng didn’t put down the god Ascension rankings. Instead, he smiled slightly, and two dazzling golden rays shot out from his palms. He seized the rare opportunity to infiltrate the rankings.</p><p>“You want to take advantage of the situation and seize control of the god Ascension Rankings?”Han Guang didn’t look down on him. His thoughts were all over the place, and he began to think about Zhao Heng’s motive for doing this impossible thing.</p><p>He couldn’t have gone mad. He couldn’t have thought that he could forcibly erase the original mark from Daolord Creation’s hand. There had to be a reason for his actions!</p><p>Just as Han Guang thought this, he saw the golden light in Zhao Heng’s palm turn pitch-black to the point of filth. It was as if the evil and destruction in the world had become extremely concentrated.</p><p>On the southern desolate mountain peak, Qi Zhengyan was already floating in mid-air. The star of ‘equality’and ‘self-improvement’between his brows was beginning to glow, and he was transmitting the power of the demon Emperor’s Claw to Zhao Heng through a special connection.</p><p>Back then, Zhao Heng had traveled all over the world to conceal his true purpose — to go to the southern wilderness and meet Qi Zhengyan!</p><p>The Demon Emperor’s claw was extremely evil. It was the most powerful divine weapon that could be used to seize control of treasures. With the ‘Splendid Mountain and river painting’isolating it, the amount of power that could be transmitted through the land pressure was extremely small!</p><p>Zhao Heng’s hand was as black as fog, enveloping the god Ascension roll. The smile on his face became brilliant as he looked at Han Guang, his gaze containing an unconcealable pride.</p><p>I don’t want to be viewed from above, and I don’t want to play with a tiger, so I can only choose the third path!</p><p>Joining hands with ‘Demon Emperor’Qi Zhengyan to completely disrupt the situation in the world. He fought for his ideals, and I fought for my obsession!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
