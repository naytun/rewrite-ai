The prime of the limitless ocean, Shi Qingyun, rushed out of the mud ball once again. He lowered his head and turned into streams of chaotic energy, enveloping him within.</p><p>Did his words really come true? The good ones did not work, but the bad ones did. Speak of the Devil, and the Devil will come?</p><p>He focused his gaze and looked over. He saw the pair of feet wearing the boots made of Golden Dragon Scales. They stood in the cold and silent death and the warm and vigorous life force, forming a perfect balance. The cycle of life and death was endless.</p><p>Following the boots up was the black emperor’s robe that covered his entire body and his slender and majestic body. His two hands naturally hung on his left and right sides. Immortal Qi curled up into clouds, and the sound of the zither was melodious, the origin of life and death that was filled with abstract descriptions painted an otherworldly immortal scene. It stirred the resonance between life and death in the depths of the world, pointing directly to the source. One thought made life, one sound made death!</p><p>Emperor Fu… This thought suddenly flashed through Meng Qi’s mind. His perfect and strong soul could not help but feel a trace of despair.</p><p>The only person who knew how to enter and exit the origin of life and death, and who matched the features of what he saw in front of him, was the mysterious Emperor Fu!</p><p>This was an important figure who was even more terrifying than the black emperor. Now, it could almost be confirmed that he was the other side!</p><p>Although the Fengdu Emperor said that Emperor Fu’s condition was not right, the other side was the other side. With nowhere to escape, he would not be able to fight back at all!</p><p>How could he deduce that he would use the origin of life and death to escape? Did Emperor Qing not help him to cover up? Or did he, who had the “River Map”, stand out in the Heavenly Secrets Yi Dao? Even if he was in the other side, he was also a well-known figure?</p><p>On the Black Emperor’s robe, there was a diadem covering his face and a string of beads covering his face, so that no one could see the face of Emperor Fu clearly. In his mind, there was an ancient scroll made of fur with ten black and White origin points on it, it seemed to represent the five elements of yin and yang, the Great Yan of the eight trigrams, and the subtle divine mechanism.</p><p>The sound of the zither was pleasant to the ear. It came from somewhere, and there seemed to be an ancient zither in the void that was hard to find.</p><p>Looking at Meng Qi, the mysterious Emperor Fu slowly said,</p><p>“Give me the god-ascension roll.”</p><p>The voice spun, and the illusory river of time seemed to form a vortex here, crazily converging between Emperor Fu’s eyebrows, triggering the changes of time in the origin of life and death, making Meng Qi like a mosquito, condensing into amber, other than a thin layer around his body that allowed him to move freely, the rest was like a seal.</p><p>Just the words alone were enough to make him unable to resist.</p><p>Emperor Fengdu said that Emperor Fu’s condition was not right. What was wrong with his condition? Meng Qi’s thoughts spun rapidly. He suppressed negative emotions such as despair and tried to think of a way to survive!</p><p>What was wrong with his condition… what was wrong… with a shake of his sleeve, Meng Qi pretended to be taking out the god Ascension Board. His gaze once again swept across Emperor Fu.</p><p>Suddenly, his eyes met Fu Huang’s eyes for a brief moment. His mind buzzed and he almost lost consciousness.</p><p>What a strange pair of eyes. There were circles and circles of vortexes in them, layer upon layer, as if they were continuously covering layers of heaven and earth. They were extremely chaotic, reaching all the way to the innate spiritual light of every living being that lived at an infinite height, if not for the supreme limitless origin Shi Qing Yun covering his body, just by looking at it, Meng Qi felt that his innate spiritual light would collapse and be destroyed. From his memories to his intelligence, they would all be reduced to ashes, leaving behind only a walking corpse.</p><p>Countless sparks of memories burst forth, constantly comparing this scene and this scene. Meng Qi suddenly realized that this feeling was very similar to the description of the monsters suppressed by the nine venerated immortal tombs by Reverend Yun he. The only difference was.., there was still some clarity and rationality left in the depths of Fu Huang’s eyes.</p><p>In a split second, Meng Qi made a decision. As he took out the god Ascension Roll, he shouted in a low voice,</p><p>“Tai Yi!”</p><p>Dong Huang Tai Yi!</p><p>“Tai Yi?”Fu Huang’s gaze suddenly froze. Immediately after, he raised his hands and covered his head, letting out a low and painful cry.</p><p>Dong Dong Dong. Meng Qi was almost killed by this unconscious rhythm. Not only did the Tai Shang Wuji Yuan Shi Qing cloud collapse, but even the Yuan Xin seal, which was close to the illusory Great Dao, almost backfired.</p><p>However, Emperor Fu’s condition also gave him a chance. The frozen time around him returned to normal, and he could escape from the origin of life and death!</p><p>Although there were a few old guys waiting outside, Emperor Fu was also chasing after him. With a wolf at the front and a tiger at the back, he could try to drive the tiger to swallow the wolf!</p><p>Meng Qi was determined. After experiencing the torture of reincarnation, the suppression of the six paths, Little Sang’s death, and the despair of the Devil Buddha as an enemy, he really never gave up!</p><p>At this moment, a green light suddenly appeared in the vigorous abstract vitality. It was Emperor Qing. His hair was disheveled, and he wore a strange robe. He was handsome and elegant!</p><p>He had refined the “Life and death book”for Meng Qi to protect himself, so he naturally had a sense of the origin. When the Bodhi ancient Buddha’s cover faded, he would be able to find some clues.</p><p>At this critical moment, he finally came down personally!</p><p>Seeing this scene, Meng Qi immediately stopped his action of escaping the life and death origin. If he went outside, there would be no Fu Huang chasing after him, and Emperor Qing would also be entangled here. He would face the Black Heaven Emperor, nine chaos heavenly venerate, and the other old guys alone, that was a big joke!</p><p>It was not a good thing to react too quickly. He had suffered a similar loss in the nine heavens.</p><p>As soon as he sensed the appearance of Emperor Qing, Emperor Fu, who was groaning in pain, made a prompt decision and retreated to the deepest part of the origin of life and death. Then, he disappeared mysteriously.</p><p>“Although Emperor Fu still has the power of the other shore, it seems that he doesn’t dare to face the real person on the other shore. I’m afraid the hidden danger is very big…”seeing this development, meng qi nodded thoughtfully, “No wonder he wanted to take the Luo book and form a complete set with the river map to form the supreme power of the other shore. He must have used this to get rid of the wrong state and recover his original strength…”</p><p>“Moreover, his problem is obviously related to the East Emperor’s Taiyi. Could it be that this rare emperor from the primordial era really escaped from the hands of the heavenly emperor and disappeared without a trace, hiding in secret places, passing through the end of the epoch and coming to the primordial era, scheming a lot of big things?”</p><p>As he pondered, Emperor Qing turned around and faced him. With a casual finger of his right hand, his life force grew and his life force was restored. Meng Qi’s injuries immediately recovered and there was not the slightest bit left.</p><p>This was the power of the other shore that controlled the way of wood and life!</p><p>“Thank you for saving me, Senior Emperor Qing.”Meng Qi bowed with a smile.</p><p>Emperor Qing nodded slightly, his voice was clear and elegant as he said, “My cover was interfered by Emperor Fu and caused you to fall into a dangerous situation. Right now, the few Old Fellows in nine remoteness are waiting to see what happens. In order to prevent any accidents, give me the god Ascension Roll. I will return to the Fusang ancient tree realm directly from the point of life and death and pass it to Gao Lan.”</p><p>Meng Qi took out the god-sealing roll from his sleeve without hesitation and handed it to Green Emperor. He said with a smile,</p><p>“This is the most appropriate way to do things. I’m just afraid that I’ll trouble you, Senior.”</p><p>Green Emperor put away the god-sealing roll, and the light around him rose, as if he was about to escape from the origin of life and death. Meng Qi was stunned as he asked, “Senior Green Emperor, what about me?”</p><p>If he didn’t take me with him and bring me back to the Fusang Ancient Tree Realm?</p><p>Then, when I get out, how am I going to face the Black Heavenly Emperor, heavenly venerate nine chaos, and the other old guys?</p><p>Should I burn the bridge after crossing the river..</p><p>Emperor Qing revealed a faint smile on his face. “I’ll give you some benefits if I keep you here, but you’ll have to temper yourself a little to gain a deeper understanding of these benefits.”</p><p>A little temper? A little temper when facing the black heavenly emperor, heavenly venerate nine chaos, heavenly venerate Xuanming Ghost Emperor, and the nine Nether Blood Demon? Meng Qi was almost cursing at his incompetence, but he could not hide his curiosity. “Senior, what are the benefits?”</p><p>The green emperor nodded and said, “Don’t you have a piece of supreme heavenly mirror fragment? Take it out.”</p><p>Meng Qi had just taken out the fragment from his sleeve when he saw the green emperor pointing at it from afar. There seemed to be auspicious clouds and green wood appearing above his head, and the illusory dao fruit appeared.</p><p>Suddenly, the light of the supreme heavenly mirror fragment expanded rapidly. It was illusory as it was real, and it condensed into a complete mirror without any luster. It was ancient and deep, and it seemed as if the heavens were falling into it.</p><p>“It has 50-60% of the profoundness of the original Supreme Heavenly Mirror, but you can only use it once. How much you can comprehend from it is up to you,”said the green emperor in an ethereal tone. His figure gradually disappeared from the starting point of life and death.</p><p>He infused the Dao of the supreme heavenly mirror that he had comprehended and his experience of using the supreme heavenly mirror into it. After one use, this piece of the Supreme Heavenly Mirror Shard would turn into ashes.</p><p>The original Supreme Heavenly Mirror was extremely powerful, and fifty to sixty percent mystical was no small matter. Even if he could not defeat the few old fellows, he was confident that he could use this to escape… Meng Qi touched the surface of the mirror and muttered to himself, after the Green Emperor’s figure disappeared for a long time, he let out a long sigh.</p><p>Sigh!</p><p>Emperor Fu did not dare to face the real other shore. He could only interfere. After the Black Heavenly Emperor sensed him, if the green emperor attacked directly, he would be able to seize the opportunity and defeat the Black Heavenly Emperor before the other few old fellows could react, he would be able to pull himself out of the nine underworld without having to go through the cycle of the origin of life and death.</p><p>As for why he had to go through the cycle of the origin of life and death, Meng Qi could only think of one reason. This place could conceal the prying eyes of the important figures on the other side. It did not require the green emperor’s own power to conceal it. As a result, the matter of the god Ascension roll falling into his hands was only known to him, currently, no one knew about it!</p><p>After thinking of this, Meng Qi did not hesitate to give the god Ascension roll to the Green Emperor. It would be ugly if he were to shed all pretense of cordiality.</p><p>Of course, he did not doubt the Green Emperor’s character and way of doing things. He believed that the handsome and elegant green emperor would definitely give the god Ascension roll high up in the end. This was also another reason why he did not hesitate much. However, once in and out.., the process in between was enough for the legend to leave many hidden hands behind, not to mention the Green Emperor who was on the other side.</p><p>As for what the Green Emperor thought of the rule of humanity, whether he desired to re-establish the heavenly court and become the head of the gods, what he really wanted, and what plans he had, he could not guess at all.</p><p>Sigh, Heaven’s will is hard to predict… Meng Qi sighed again.</p><p>This benefit in his hands was probably the result that the Green Emperor had repaid for this.</p><p>It was useless to think too much. Meng Qi retracted his thoughts and became more determined to improve himself and point to the other shore. He carefully comprehended the illusory supreme heavenly mirror in his hand and after familiarizing himself with its usage, he slowly escaped from the origin of life and death!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
