However, they had not expected that it would be the heir-in-waiting, King Jin, who was involved in this mission!</p><p>If they had not thought about finding out about the miracle, they would have definitely snuck into King Jin’s manor without any precautions. If they were not careful, they would have been seen through by King Jin, who was familiar with the matters of reincarnation. They would have died a horrible death.</p><p>At this moment, a similar image flashed in their minds. The team had spent a lot of effort to finally sneak into King Jin’s secret study when he was out. Who knew that King Jin would sit in the dark after the table was set, he looked at them coldly and slowly took out a mask of an “Ancient immortal”to put on. Everything turned pitch black.</p><p>Just imagining such a scene made them shudder.</p><p>Luckily, they knew about it in advance. Luckily!</p><p>Yu Jinghua took a deep breath and said with the help of the spiritual network that Zhu Tianming had built, “Six paths told us to read the entire ‘Great Zhou’s defense manual’and did not erase the corresponding content. So there was this purpose.”</p><p>“Yes, if it weren’t for the shock of ‘six paths’and ‘myth’revealing the secrets, and the logical speculation, we wouldn’t have thought of finding out about the fairy tale and wouldn’t have been able to obtain the King Jin’s secret that everyone knows about. We would have lost at least 50% of the mission from the very beginning,”Luan Yaqian, who was invisible, agreed.</p><p>This news almost blew them up, but it also reduced the risk!</p><p>The mission in the nightmare world could not afford to make any mistakes.</p><p>Sensing Jiao Li’s shock and seeing the change in his expression, old Zhang was very satisfied, he chuckled and said, “Don’t doubt it. At that time, the news spread like wildfire in Changle. Everyone knew about it on the streets. However, it was suppressed by the six doors. In addition, there were many new and sensational news, so everyone slowly put it to the back of their minds. You, if you stay in Changle for a few more years, you’ll know that the Emperor is nothing compared to you!”</p><p>Seeing that old Zhang was going to start bragging again, jiao li hurriedly said, “I believe it, I believe it! This miracle is too damn strong! Even King Jin is one of them!”</p><p>Hearing that, old Zhang immediately snorted. “You think you’re strong just like that? Brother, you’re good at everything except that you’re from a small place. You’re too short-sighted and shallow-sighted.”</p><p>Jiao Li could tell that old Zhang was not done, so he immediately went with the topic. “Isn’t that strong? The Mighty King Jin, a god of the land, is already a member of the miracle. Isn’t that strong?”</p><p>Old Zhang slowly picked up a piece of meat and drank a mouthful of wine, after keeping him in suspense, he said, “Before King Jin broke through, he was ranked in the Great Zhou Empire, but in the miracle, he’s not outstanding enough. Of course, he’s also in the immortal class now, so he’s definitely different from before.”</p><p>“If King Jin isn’t outstanding enough, how strong is the fairy tale? Who else can pressure him?”Jiao Li let his true emotions surface. He wasn’t faking it at all. He was doubtful and eager for an answer.</p><p>His expression and tone tickled old Zhang’s itch. He said with a smile, “Not to mention before he broke through, there are already several people who can pressure him now.”</p><p>“Quite a few?”Jiao Li blurted out, extremely shocked.</p><p>This wasn’t just his reaction, it was also the reaction of Mao Jin, Yu Jinghua, and the others.</p><p>Since when were there so many people in the ‘miracle of immortality’who could suppress fiendgod-level figures?</p><p>This was too exaggerated!</p><p>“You know the Langya Ruan family, right? The Patriarch of the Ruan family, Fairy Ruan, is the ‘Fairy Chang’of the ‘Miracle of immortality.’Although she has just recently attained the Dao and become an immortal, when their cultivation levels were about the same, there was already a difference in the ‘miracle of immortality.’now, it’s most likely the same as before.”Old Zhang pointed in the southeast direction, he spoke with confidence.</p><p>After all, he only had a wide circle of acquaintances and lacked real knowledge. He treated the difference between official members and peripheral members as a difference in strength.</p><p>Did he just break through recently? No wonder, no wonder! Jiao Li heaved a sigh of relief for some reason. Even Yu Jinghua and the others could not control themselves. Fortunately, Old Zhang was only at the level of strengthening his body, so he did not notice it at all.</p><p>It turned out that he had just become a god-level demon. Just like King Jin, the intelligence had not been updated yet. It was not that they were ignorant.</p><p>However, with the primordial Lord of Heaven, the fairy tale had three masters at the level of god-level and above. They were several times stronger than they had expected. They were simply intimidated by the fairy tale and did not dare to look at it directly.</p><p>They were not unfamiliar with Chang ‘E. Although it had been a long time since anyone had met her during the reincarnation mission, the fairy tale would produce some of the jade pendants that she had made, pills that had improved the taste, and so on.</p><p>“Yes, yes, yes. The rules will not be changed at will. What else?”Jiao Li Thought for a moment and felt that something was not right. There were not many ‘Primordial Lord of Heaven’and ‘Fairy Chang’e’!</p><p>Old Zhang looked at Jiao Li’s eager expression, he shook his head and said, “Sword-washing pavilion’s sword God Jiang, the miracle ‘Perfected Jade Tripod’. He has been in the immortal class for many years and is about to step into the Heaven Immortal realm. In terms of realm, strength, and status, he is higher than King Jin.”</p><p>Celestial Immortal Realm? Wasn’t this the peak of the Fiendgod realm that he and the others were talking about? Jiao Li nearly knocked over the wine in front of him.</p><p>Although he was mentally prepared, he never imagined that there would be someone at the peak of the Fiendgod Realm in the immortal miracle!</p><p>‘adept jade tripod’had not revealed herself for so many years. She had disappeared without a trace in the world of reincarnation, and no items had come out. If Yu Jinghua had not mentioned this title to the members of the immortal miracle by chance during their conversation.., previously, she had told them that she had never heard of her before, but she was actually an expert close to the peak of the gods and demons.</p><p>The miracle of immortality was too terrifying. There were actually two gods and demons, and one of them was close to the peak of the gods and demons. This did not include the “Primordial Lord of Heaven”who was far more powerful than the gods and demons and could fight against six paths!</p><p>This was almost half of the number of reincarnation dimension avatars in the past!</p><p>Mao Jin and the others were silent. They felt that the celestial miracle was like an iceberg on the sea. What they saw was only the surface of the water. Beneath the sea, there was an even larger body!</p><p>Awe, fear, and other emotions quietly rose in their hearts.</p><p>“There’s… There’s more?”Jiao Li felt his lips dry, afraid that he would ask another fiendgod-level figure.</p><p>Old Zhang laughed. “The one above is of course the ‘Primordial Lord of Heaven’.”</p><p>“Primordial Lord of Heaven?”Zhu Tianming’s mind network was filled with voices. Some were eager for answers, but some were afraid of them.</p><p>At this moment.., yu Jinghua said in a low voice, “Old Zhang knows the true identity of the ‘Primordial Lord of Heaven’, which means that he is a big shot in this nightmare world. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have left a deep impression on him, and he used such a tone.”</p><p>“There are not many big shots in the nightmare world who can compete with the six paths…”Luan Yaqian said to herself.</p><p>Before they had the time to analyze them one by one, Jiao Li could not wait to ask, “Who is the ‘Celestial Master of Origin’?”</p><p>“Who else could it be?”Old Zhang pointed at the top, “The direct disciple of the Celestial Master of origin, the sect master of the Hollow Jade Temple, the immortal venerate Yuan Huang, the first-in-line heir of the Great Zhou. Heh, of course, he doesn’t fancy the throne of the Great Zhou, he just helps the current son of Heaven.”</p><p>The four titles of the direct disciple of the primordial Lord of Heaven, the sect master of the Hollow Jade Temple, the primordial Emperor Immortal Venerable, and the first-in-line successor of the Great Zhou didn’t surprise Mao Jin and the others. Instead, the related descriptions such as “Master of the universal discerning ball”appeared in their minds, their hearts were filled with such emotions as expected.</p><p>It was indeed him!</p><p>A big shot who could force six paths to do shameless things really understood six paths very well!</p><p>“No wonder he chose the title of ‘Primordial Lord of Heaven’. He was originally the Yuxu sect master, a direct descendant of the primordial Lord of Heaven…”Zhu Tianming said in realization.</p><p>Mao Jin let out a long sigh and peered at Yu Jinghua. “Only such a big shot can protect the ‘celestial miracle’and not be afraid of six paths.”</p><p>“I knew it was him,”Luan Yaqian said with a sigh.</p><p>Yu Jinghua did not say anything. His eyes flickered slightly, revealing the uneasiness in his heart.</p><p>“So it’s him, the old man. No wonder.”Jiao Li took a deep breath and pretended to be shocked.</p><p>Old Zhang smiled and said, “The Origin Emperor Immortal Venerable’s rapid growth back then was all because of this. But later on, he fought the six paths and forced his way out of the reincarnation space. His cultivation speed wasn’t slow, but rather fast!”</p><p>“What? Fought the six paths? Forced his way out of the reincarnation space?”Jiao Li lost his composure again. His voice became louder, and it wasn’t a disguise.</p><p>Yu Jinghua and the others all had their own reactions. Some of them banged on the wooden bed, while others let out a low cry. Fortunately, they were all covered up by Jiao Li’s loud voice.</p><p>They did think that the immortal venerate Yuan Huang could fight six paths, but they never thought that he actually defeated six paths as a reincarnator and forced his way out of the reincarnation dimension!</p><p>Although according to the description in the defense manual, the members of six paths had their own problems apart from those who did not know the details, but this was too terrifying, too terrifying!</p><p>Having witnessed the unfathomable abilities of the six paths gods and demons, they felt as if their faith had been shattered!</p><p>Old Zhang knew that something was not right, so he casually asked a few questions before changing the topic. Jiao Li was still in a state of confusion and fear. For a moment, he was not in the mood to ask about the miracle, so he kept drinking and drinking.</p><p>Not long after, the jar of wine was finished. Jiao Li sent old Zhang off, and a few members appeared. However, no one said anything. They looked at each other, and there were still traces of shock in their eyes. Their eyes were filled with confusion.</p><p>After a long silence, Yu Jinghua frowned and said,</p><p>“That’s not right. This kind of thing will definitely not be leaked by the myths, so as to not boost the morale of others and destroy their own prestige. In that case, who was the one who spread the news?”</p><p>“It’s very simple. It must be a miracle. Since it’s disgusted and alienated by the myths, we might as well publicize our great achievements,”Zhu Tianming said without hesitation.</p><p>Mao Jin nodded in agreement. “That’s right. It must be a miracle. It Can’t be the immortal venerate Yuan Huang himself, right?”</p><p>The few of them laughed and were appeased by Mao Jin’s humor. Then, Luan Yaqian said solemnly,</p><p>“Everyone, work hard and try to join the Miracle.”</p><p>..</p><p>After another two and a half months, Yu Jinghua finally found a chance to sneak into King Jin’s mansion.</p><p>Under the lead of an old woman, she was walking toward the side door.</p><p>The old woman named Zhao nagged as she walked, “Now that everyone is ambitious, it’s getting harder and harder to find people who can actually do odd jobs. Even our lord’s residence can’t keep people here, and those who can’t catch up with the spark divine technique are getting older and older. It’s getting harder and harder to do rough jobs. I value your naivety and your dedication to doing things, so you can’t be too ambitious. You’re always thinking of some breakthrough that will make you famous in the world, which is why I’m giving you a chance.”</p><p>“Those idiots are everywhere. How could they have a chance? When the time comes, they might not even be able to eat, so they can only come back crying and begging.”</p><p>Yu Jinghua turned a deaf ear to nanny Zhao’s nagging and only looked at the side door in front.</p><p>As she approached the steps, the exquisite scenery of King Jin’s residence entered her sight.</p><p>If she took this step, the danger ahead would be like the sea.</p><p>If she took this step, she would be a real low-grade servant girl. She would not have any distracting thoughts so that she would not be seen through.</p><p>She believed that she could do it because even she did not know what she was going to do by sneaking into King Jin’s mansion. It seemed that she was going to be a low-grade servant girl.</p><p>She stepped over the threshold firmly and walked very steadily. There was only one thought in her mind:</p><p>“Six months later, what task will six paths give me?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
