There were no coincidences</p><p>He had probably woken up a long time ago, and for some reason, he had been holding back until now… Emperor Fengdu was inexplicably frightened, and strange lights continuously rose from his body. There were black, white, and dark green lights. They were all profound mysteries and extremely terrifying. At this critical moment of life and death.., he no longer cared about anything else and used all his life-saving divine abilities and treasures as if they were free.</p><p>However, he made such a mistake when he was fighting against an evenly matched opponent. He was hit by a full-powered sword strike, and he did not cultivate the eight-nine arcane art, which was an absolute art that was good at fighting head-on. Naturally, Fengdu suffered a heavy blow, every thought was placed in the fierce wind and huge waves created by the sword light. Meanwhile, Zhenwu had obviously recovered its complete intelligence. Its strength was even stronger than when it was at its peak. Moreover, it did not hide anything and countered every move it made, he destroyed Emperor Fengdu’s life-saving skills and escaping treasures one by one.</p><p>Purple Qi flew everywhere, and the sword light attacked in different directions. Even though Emperor Fengdu was rapidly reincarnating, he still couldn’t get rid of it. In the end, he gradually disappeared, and only a little obsession was left.</p><p>The Sword Qi swept past, and the true martial emperor didn’t even let go of Fengdu’s remaining obsession.</p><p>One of the bodhisattva ancient Buddha’s three corpses had died just like that!</p><p>The seven treasures magical tree shook, and an infinite light burst out. It temporarily isolated the true force and the scroll, and jumped out of the origin of life and death.</p><p>During this process, Gu Xiaosang’s fourth phenomenon, “Eternal destination,”gradually disappeared. She had completely reached the legendary realm, and she finished refining at the same time as Meng Qi.</p><p>At this moment, it was too late to overdo it. If they continued refining, they would stir the deepest part of the origin of life and death. The two of them would probably not be able to escape the fate of being assimilated.</p><p>Meng Qi stood in the depths of death and felt that the ‘abstract concepts’around him could no longer affect him. He could not help but feel joy rising in his heart.</p><p>He had really gained a lot this time. Not only had little sang successfully verified the legend and created the fourth type of abnormal phenomenon, but he also only needed to refine and condense other abhijnas and techniques and bring them into the limitless chaos of the near Dao, then, he would push the causes of all fruits and the heaven-opening seal to the same level, and he would immediately step into the destiny realm and become a great divine ability user.</p><p>If he did not want to be perfect, he could even break through now!</p><p>However, he had been walking on the path of the infinite beginning, which could contain all kinds of mysterious changes, so he could not give up halfway. Moreover, the critical causes of all fruits and the heaven-opening seal still needed time to improve.</p><p>Although the end of the calamity was coming menacingly now and the Great Divine Arts had returned one by one, he could not let his emotions get out of control because of this. He could not panic his steps and cause the loss of his foundation. The path of martial cultivation required the will to advance bravely and bravely, he also needed to understand the principle that haste makes waste. He needed to take his time and adapt to the situation to make the most appropriate choice.</p><p>In any case, the bigwigs on the other side would not be back for a while. He was now the true sect master of the Hollow Jade Temple. If he encountered any trouble, his senior brothers and sisters in the Blessed Realm would help him out. It was far from the point where he would be waiting for death if he did not break through.</p><p>The Joy was fermenting. Meng Qi suddenly had a feeling that what he had just experienced was like a dream.</p><p>Little Sang’s plan with him had actually tricked one of the three corpses of the bigwigs on the other side. He was not a simple great supernatural ability user!</p><p>This was simply filled with unreality, yet it made people feel exceptionally gratified and proud.</p><p>Of course, if it weren’t for the fact that Emperor Zhenwu had received some unknown stimulation and woke up in advance, little sang and he would at most be able to resist Emperor Fengdu’s counterattack with the help of the shortcut power of the origin of life and death. Once the fourth type of phenomenon disappeared.., they would look for an opportunity to escape from this world. They had never thought that they would be able to kill this great ability user with a terrifying foundation.</p><p>He knew this very well.</p><p>Because he had refined part of the origin of life and death, Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang could see through the abstract concept that was gradually calming down. They saw Emperor Zhenwu put away the ancient purple primordial sun ruler, he put away the remains of Emperor Fengdu and looked over like an ocean.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang stood there like an orchid in a valley. She had an indescribable holiness. She smiled and did not say anything. She looked at Meng Qi walking forward and cupped her hands in salute. “Thank you, senior Black Emperor, for your help.”</p><p>At this point, Meng Qi suddenly felt a little nervous. He glanced at the tree of Great Dao from the corner of his eye, which was sucking the origin of life and death.</p><p>This was the item of celestial demon Dominator, and it was also the most important item in the apocalypse. Would it be taken back?</p><p>Little Meng had always been so realistic..</p><p>Zhenwu chuckled and said, “You helped me get rid of the evil thoughts. It should be my way of thanking you.”</p><p>‘this is your reward. I, the five ancient emperors, and one of the Nine Holy Masters of Taoism, will shamelessly take it back.’?</p><p>After the silent ‘communication’, Meng Qi secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He smiled and said, “The world is really unpredictable. Senior actually woke up at this critical moment. Could it be because of the stimulation of the tree of Great Dao?”</p><p>Emperor Zhenwu looked at him and then at Gu Xiaosang. He smiled and sighed. “I had already woken up before the return of the Netherworld.”</p><p>Then, he smiled mischievously. “Little friend Su, you can think about it yourself. Why is it that the sword that I used to kill the Netherworld was ‘Dao Extinguishes Dao Life’, and the sword that cleaved Fengdu was ‘Dao meets me’?”</p><p>‘what?’? Meng Qi was extremely surprised. He thought about it over and over again, and he seemed to have understood something.</p><p>If that sword was not ‘Dao Extinguishes Dao Life’, and Emperor Zhenwu had not only used the power of the primordial Yang ruler to activate it, he would not have been able to shatter the Netherworld’s skeleton and absorb the abstract concept of the origin of life and death to create the wheel of life and death, with this as a backup plan, it had played a crucial role today.</p><p>If Emperor Zhenwu had used the ‘Dao beheading to see me’when he destroyed the Yellow Springs’reincarnation, he would have lost his consciousness long ago and would not have been spared.</p><p>Both of them had used their swords because of the ‘Qi movement’. One was ‘Dao extinguishing dao birth’, and the other was ‘Dao beheading to see me’, and they had coincidentally helped him. Although it was possible based on instinct, in terms of probability.., it could be described as a coincidence or a coincidence.</p><p>However, there were no coincidences when it involved important figures on the other side of the river!</p><p>That was why great Emperor Zhen Wu had woken up a long time ago. For some reason, he could not bear it anymore. He had cheated the Netherworld and helped him. In the end, he had killed one of the three corpses of the ancient Bodhi Buddha.</p><p>Meng Qi’s words were on the tip of his tongue. In the end, he said, “I didn’t expect senior to be able to break free from the ‘assimilation of Dao’by himself. It is truly awe-inspiring.”</p><p>True martial emperor smiled and said, “No. Long before the reincarnation of the Netherworld, a friend stepped into this place and awakened the old Dao.”</p><p>“Someone else entered the origin of life and death before?”Meng Qi asked in surprise.</p><p>True Martial Emperor said with an indifferent expression, “Although the origin of life and death is extremely difficult to find, it’s not completely impossible, and it doesn’t necessarily have to be led by the netherworld. Buddha came, and Fu Huang also came. It’s not surprising that someone else came before you.”</p><p>“Which senior is it?”Meng Qi asked casually.</p><p>Emperor Zhenwu smiled but didn’t say anything. Meng Qi suddenly became cheerful. The Joy and pride he felt from successfully planning one of the three corpses of the great figure on the other shore became complicated and indescribable.</p><p>This was the truth of the origin of life and death of Emperor Fengdu..</p><p>Was this the “Will of heaven”?</p><p>Emperor Zhenwu put his hands behind his back and stepped out of the depths. He said calmly,</p><p>“I have to go into seclusion now.”</p><p>Meng Qi’s heart skipped a beat, and he said hurriedly, “Please help me cover up what happened just now.”</p><p>He and Gu Xiaosang had already made preparations. Although Emperor Fengdu could not stay, and it was difficult to keep her resurrection a secret, at least the Gold Emperor had not interfered with the legend, and he had laid a solid foundation. As for the future.., they could rely on the power of the hollow jade temple to temporarily deal with the Luo cult’s divine envoys and try to get the support of other important figures on the other shore as soon as possible to fight against the returning gold emperor. Then, they could work hard to attack the other shore.</p><p>Now that Emperor Fengdu had died at the hands of Zhen Wu, the situation had taken a turn for the better. It seemed that they could try to keep it a secret for a while more. Moreover, if Emperor Zhen Wu could reach the other shore, they could have more than half of their backers!</p><p>Emperor Zhenwu laughed, “Don’t worry, little friend Su. I’m not one to gossip.”</p><p>Amidst the laughter, his figure disappeared from the point of life and death.</p><p>Meng Qi secretly heaved a sigh of relief. He turned his head to look at Gu Xiaosang, only to see that she was still as pure and holy as before, like a perfect idol.</p><p>“Did you ever think that Emperor Zhenwu had woken up ahead of time?”Meng Qi asked casually.</p><p>The corner of Gu Xiaosang’s mouth curled up bit by bit, and the holiness faded away. She said with a faint smile,</p><p>“Of course I did.”</p><p>“However, if Zhenwu hadn’t awoken, our plan would still have succeeded. If he had awoken in advance, with the Karma between you and him, it goes without saying who he would help. Even if he lost his reason after awaking and turned into a monster like the Heavenly Dao, based on instinct, the first one to be dealt with would definitely be the more threatening Fengdu.”</p><p>“So What’s there to talk about?”</p><p>Her smile grew wider and wider.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
