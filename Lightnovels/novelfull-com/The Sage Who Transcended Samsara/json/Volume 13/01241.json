No matter what, he would not be wrong to try.</p><p>In the current situation, because the Azure Emperor had gone through a sea of bitterness and become the only person on the other side of the world, all the forces had to stop. Since the beginning of the apocalypse, there was finally a relatively stable environment, and it seemed like it could last for a long time, until the other side of the world completely woke up and returned.</p><p>However, cultivation and doing things had to have the mentality of “Thinking of danger in times of peace”. They could not relax because of this. They had to lower their requirements of themselves to prevent all kinds of accidents from happening. For example, the Devil Buddha, who could already emit a little aura, was secretly plotting a conspiracy, for example, the Fengdu Great Emperor was harboring evil intentions through the matter of the origin of life and death. For example, the Zhenwu Great Emperor was in a strange state, and his power was inexplicable. There might be variables.</p><p>More importantly, Emperor Qing, who was floating in the sea of bitterness, had only one goal, which was to reach the other shore. Now that he had attained bodhi, there must be other “Demands”. As such.., would he have his own thoughts about the Heaven Court, the Human Emperor, the Netherworld, and the Netherworld? Would such thoughts coincide with the interests of himself, his big brother, and the others?</p><p>Although he had the cause and effect to help him achieve the dao, it was impossible for him to be too broad-minded. There would always be a day when the cause and effect would be cleared up after the consumption of favors.</p><p>In the final analysis, Emperor Qing’s idea was already “The will of heaven, and the will of heaven has been difficult to ask since ancient times. The only thing that cultivators in the world could do was to improve themselves as soon as possible, striving to jump out of the chessboard one day and become the “Will of heaven”!</p><p>With a flash of light, Meng Qi leaped into the infinite height and saw the ancient and magnificent hollow jade temple. He saw the thirty-six ancient wells that surrounded it. The jade railings were shining with a dark light, flickering with a profound light.</p><p>A glass lamp appeared in his eyes. The ’cause and effect’combined with the hollow jade divine calculation worked quickly. The black and white light in Meng Qi’s eyes finally stopped at one of the ancient wells.</p><p>Stepping into this ancient and modern well, he would avoid the ‘primordial beginning projection’that had an independent consciousness. With his current realm and strength, although he was not afraid of them, there was no need to fight and kill unnecessarily.</p><p>Taking a step forward, Meng Qi plunged into the ancient well. Before his eyes was a pitch-black floating, dark vortex. Time and space were in chaos, and terror grew in the dark. He did not know which secret land and dangerous place it led to, or which ancient universe it led to.</p><p>Just as he passed through the layers of illusory curtains and arrived in a universe, his body was suddenly pulled into the strange world by an irresistible suction force. He merged with the sleeping, indescribable innate God into one!</p><p>The entire process was as natural as the creation of the world and the end of the era, as if the Great Dao had been decided. Even with Meng Qi’s supernatural power of “All karma”, he could only cooperate with it.</p><p>Of course, it was not that he could not cut off this fusion connection, but he had an epiphany in an instant. This innate god was the “Primordial beginning projection”of this world. After the “Primordial beginning heavenly venerate”disappeared, he still could not have an independent consciousness, he was in a deep sleep. As long as he stepped into this universe, he would have to have a connection with him. Naturally, he would absorb him and turn him into his own “He and I imprint”. If he did not want to do so.., the only way was not to enter this place.</p><p>Figures appeared around Meng Qi. The “He and I images”such as the creator Brahma appeared one after another. The innate god that appeared just now was within them.</p><p>He was indeed the creator of this universe. He was the beginning of all things. He had defeated the projections of the other shores and destroyed them all. He had obtained absolute control over this place. He understood all the details of the universe and carried the weight of Heaven and earth on his back.</p><p>The information turned into a huge and terrifying torrent. As the “Him and me imprint”absorbed it, it surged into Meng Qi’s mind. If he had not proven himself to be a legend, his head would have definitely been blown off, he couldn’t withstand the crazy information flow that was even more astronomical than an astronomical number. Even so, it took him a long time to bring them under his control.</p><p>As soon as he finished all this, Meng Qi suddenly let out a soft “Eh”.</p><p>According to the information flow and the pitch-black, starless surroundings where time slowed down, one could come to a conclusion. The ‘primordial projection’from before was now in a sealed state, as such, he could only feel a little bit of the boundless universe, unable to transmit any power!</p><p>He seemed to have been locked up in the ‘Little Black Room’… The ‘primordial beginning projection’was locked up in the ‘Little Black Room’in the sealed universe that led to the ancient well of the hollow jade temple… Meng Qi’s lips twitched as he felt that something was amiss.</p><p>Could it be that some big shot from the other shore had taken the opportunity when the ‘primordial beginning Celestial Master’had disappeared from the world to infiltrate the influence and was preparing to gradually seize control, and because the ‘primordial beginning projection’was in a deep sleep.., even if it had enormous power, it was still easily sealed?</p><p>“Similar universes are isolated from the outside world, and their essence is close to the real world. It’s not so easy to infiltrate. Before the important figure from the other side completely wakes up, there aren’t many things that he can do…”Meng Qi dispelled all kinds of emotional thoughts, he calmly thought, “In other words, I have enough chances to stop the other side’s plot and undo this extremely ingenious seal. At the same time, I can use this collision to see the true purpose of the other side’s struggle.”</p><p>He had already tested the seal. It wasn’t strong in nature, but it was magically linked to the entire world. If he wanted to break it, he had to find the key or destroy the entire universe. It was quite tricky.</p><p>Of course, the seal was to isolate the ‘primordial beginning projection’, so it couldn’t stop Meng Qi from leaving. However, every time he stepped into it, it would be at the seal’s location, and he couldn’t avoid it.</p><p>Meng Qi sat cross-legged in the pitch-black seal. Streams of information flashed through his eyes as he began to search for the beginning of the seal.</p><p>After a while, he found that the seal was rooted in the river of time in this place. It seemed to have appeared at the place where Heaven and earth were created. It continued until the end of the universe. There was no beginning at all, so he changed directions, he wanted to find out where the initial bad changes or changes that were out of his control came from.</p><p>All the details of this universe’s past appeared in Meng Qi’s mind. Most of the future should have been clear because of this, but at a certain joint, a strange variable suddenly appeared, disrupting the long river of fate and causing the tributaries to be in chaos, now that it was evolving, it seemed that some bad possibilities were about to appear.</p><p>The variable was like a speck of light that shone into Meng Qi’s eyes. The cosmic image was magnified, from the galaxy to the galaxy, from the galaxy to the star, and from the star to a certain planet.</p><p>“It’s there…”Meng Qi closed his eyes, and his consciousness that did not carry any power seeped out. He cast his gaze over there to see if he could find the key to unsealing the seal.</p><p>Although the seal here was ingenious, it did not have an absolute essential power. Moreover, he was an external variable, and he just happened to have more consciousness than the “Primordial projection”from before. He was no longer covered by the original, so he could deceive the world, he had infiltrated a little bit.</p><p>The only problem was that such a consciousness had no power at all.</p><p>As his consciousness approached, all the relevant information about this place appeared one by one. Only the parts that were disturbed by the variables were hard to sense. Meng Qi thought for a moment and found Daoist Yunji, who had an extraordinary status but had long passed away in the mountains and forests, he occupied the body that had not rotted even though his power had dissipated.</p><p>..</p><p>Drizzling rain fell, and the long street was washed. The Sky and Earth were dark, and dark clouds gathered.</p><p>A carriage drove into the capital and stopped at the entrance of an alley. The door opened, and a black-robed Daoist walked out. He had a thin face and did not hold an umbrella. He looked up into the sky and strolled among the drops.</p><p>It was Meng Qi, who had transformed into Daoist Yunji.</p><p>In the depths of the palace, there were many pavilions. A figure saw the lead clouds forming a spiral, as if forming a door to the underworld. He said in a heavy tone,</p><p>“Your Majesty, the heavens have changed!”</p><p>… ..</p><p>In an ordinary courtyard, there were guards hidden in the dark. In the side room, there were more than a dozen people dressed in Daoist or civilian clothing.</p><p>“Father is determined to destroy the Taoist temple. I have no choice but to pretend to agree. Otherwise, I will immediately be thrown into the heavenly prison. I’m afraid that all the priests and heroes have to temporarily lay low and avoid the limelight.”A man in his thirties with a beautiful beard sighed.</p><p>A priest was about to speak when the room suddenly fell silent. Everyone looked outside at the courtyard gate in unison.</p><p>A black-robed priest was bathing in the rain. He approached leisurely without concealing his presence at all!</p><p>“Priest Yunji?”A priest with a grizzled beard frowned and said in a deep voice.</p><p>Priest Yunji? The others looked at each other with suspicion.</p><p>This was a senior among the seniors of the Daoist sect. He had entered the mountain a long time ago and was nowhere to be found. Why did he suddenly appear today? At this critical moment!</p><p>The man who claimed to be a lone Daoist gave a look and led the others into the secret passage in the room to hide. The others opened the door and welcomed him into the courtyard. They saw the thin-looking black-robed Daoist priest walking over without any hesitation.</p><p>“Is it senior Yunji?”The white-bearded Daoist asked hurriedly.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled. “I observed the sky at night and saw that the Taoist community was in imminent danger. I deliberately entered the mortal world and came to help.”</p><p>At this moment, a Daoist with a ruddy face and an imposing aura frowned. “Senior is old. I’m afraid that your skills are not as good as before.”</p><p>As an expert, he could naturally see that Meng Qi’s footsteps were light and did not have any martial arts. was he here to help or to add to the trouble?</p><p>Meng Qi looked at him with a smile. “Fellow Daoist Li Zhongkang, right? You were tossing and turning last night. You tried to turn yourself in to the imperial court several times, but you stopped at the door. Is that true?”?</p><p>Li Zhongkang was stunned at first, then he was shocked and angry. “You’re talking nonsense!”</p><p>However, there was an uncontrollable fear in his heart, and his entire body was filled with a chill. At that time, he did have doubts, but he did not speak to himself or talk to anyone. It seemed that he was just tossing and turning, pacing back and forth, it was quite normal for him to be able to reveal the hidden thoughts in his heart!</p><p>This was simply Inhuman!</p><p>Li Zhongkang was the abbey dean of the Hidden Heaven Temple in the capital. He could summon wind and rain, Summon Thunder and lightning. He once had the chance to become the current Celestial Master, but his efforts were in vain. Now, he secretly kept two concubines, but he did not have any children because his foundation was damaged when he was young, he was suffering from a hidden disease and did not know it… every detail about Li Zhongkang appeared in Meng Qi’s mind. In his eyes, he had no secrets, and so did all the Taoist and chivalrous people here.</p><p>As the god of creation who shouldered the weight of the universe, coming to the mortal world was like walking into a book written by himself. He knew the past secrets and the approximate fate of each character, but only those variables were difficult to predict.</p><p>“In the seven years and nine months, did the emperor receive any unusual items?”Ignoring Li Zhongkang, Meng Qi asked a strange question.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
