The further west one went, the more desolate it became. There was no way forward until they reached the deep sea.</p><p>This was one of the places where the aftermath of the fall of the ancient heavenly court was the most intense. Countless gods fell from the ninth heavenly layer and were buried deep in the Earth, destroying the past fertility and turning this place into a dead land. It was not until after the eternal era.., only then did life gradually reappear, forming a small number of oases.</p><p>The grotto-heavens of the gods buried here were shattered and leaked out, creating ruins one after another. Secret places one after another made the terrain of the burial desert extremely complicated, and these gods were often stubborn.., mixing with the uniqueness of the land of death, they turned into terrifying vengeful spirits and ghosts. They were born and destroyed, destroyed and born again. They would not disappear even after eternity. Even under the scorching sun, one could still hear the mournful and eerie cries of ghosts.</p><p>Because of this, the god burial desert was also quite dangerous to the exterior experts. Those who did not have a certain level of strength could only follow the path of the oasis.</p><p>Within an oasis, there was plenty of water vapor, and it was moist and pleasant. There were many buildings that were as tall as giant towers, and they had an obvious mohist style, together with a large number of local people and the sand tourists that came and went, they formed a city that was not much less prosperous than the central plains’hinterland.</p><p>Tian wanzhe took advantage of the holidays to stroll around the bustling city with the sweet root of the local specialty in his mouth. His gaze followed the beautiful girl from the Western Region who was dressed up passionately.</p><p>He was originally from Huan Prefecture. The county town he was in was a place with poor mountains and harsh rivers. There were also clans and aristocratic families that exploited him, so he could often only eat. Later on, he received a free universal common sense charm that was popularized. Only after he learned the spark great art did his life gradually improve, his horizons also slowly expanded, and he did not want to spend his entire life cooped up in the countryside. Thus, he responded to the human emperor’s call and followed the team formed by the Mo Palace and the imperial court to the Western Regions. They wanted to turn the desert into an oasis, and then open up a prosperous land.</p><p>Along with the cooperation of the Mo Palace, the Wan Xiang sect, and the Great Zhou imperial court, they had found a way to effectively transform the desert in the past two years. The area of this oasis rapidly expanded, and with the concerted efforts of everyone, it almost had the territory of a prefecture in the central plains.</p><p>“Eh, the universal symbol is doing free activities again?”Tian wanzhe was now quite wealthy and had a certain status, but he still maintained his habits from when he was young. He liked to wander around the city, but in the past, he could only look at it and couldn’t afford anything, as he strolled around, his eyes lit up. He saw a big red banner, and with a glance, it seemed to be related to the universal symbol.</p><p>With his eyes opened, he could clearly see the contents of the banner as he read it out in a low voice:</p><p>“An epoch-making new universal symbol. It can bind the soul and there is no risk of loss or theft. Now that it’s free, what are we waiting for?”</p><p>“It’s not bad…”Tian wanzhe thought for a while and decided to exchange one for himself and the old man. The losses caused by the loss of the universal symbol in the past were still fresh in his mind.</p><p>Of course, with his current knowledge, he could guess that this activity would not go smoothly. As long as one had a certain level of strength and status, the path of martial arts would be bright. Who would be willing to bind their soul to the Ten Thousand Realm Talisman, wasn’t this putting their lives in the hands of the Hollow Jade Temple?</p><p>Shaking his head, Tian Wanzhe returned home and planned to ask for the old man’s Ten Thousand Realm Talisman. As for the rest, it had nothing to do with him and he could not do anything about it.</p><p>When he had first come to the western regions, he had been with his parents. Now that his mother had passed away, and his father was getting older and older, coupled with the exhaustion of his body from his earlier years of hard work, he had slowly stopped going out and was idling around the house, with servants waiting on him, the greatest joy was the universal symbol.</p><p>After successfully changing it and binding his soul, Tian wanzhe threw it to the back of his mind and threw it into a busy and somewhat dangerous job, he assisted Mo Palace and Wanxiang sect in expanding the oasis into the depths of the god burial desert with complicated landforms.</p><p>A few months passed in the blink of an eye. Tian Wanzhe’s father was finally at the end of his rope and could no longer hold on, so he left.</p><p>After the heavy funeral, the courtyard became quiet and cold. The servants stood guard outside, and only Tian Wanzhe was left in the mourning hall.</p><p>He knelt in front of the spirit, his eyes red. He held the universal knowing talisman that his father often used and pretended to speak in a normal and humorous tone:</p><p>“Father, life and death are determined by life, and life is determined by the heavens. At least you have enjoyed nearly ten years of prosperity and wealth. Don’t be sad anymore…”</p><p>When he said the word “Sad”.., his voice trembled slightly. “When we first arrived in the western region, we didn’t even have a place to sleep. We could only build our own shelter and live in a pit. I thought that I had martial arts skills and was young and strong, so I planned to keep watch at night to prevent wild beasts from ambushing me. In the end, I still fell into a deep sleep. When I woke up, I found that you and mother took turns to keep watch at night to drive away the mosquitoes for me…”</p><p>After rambling on for a while, his sobs grew louder, so he took a deep breath and said, “Dad, don’t worry. You have enough money, paper, and candles. When you reach the netherworld, continue to enjoy yourself. If you meet Mom, tell me in my dreams.”</p><p>“Mm, I know that you like to roam the world and know the world. You like to read serialized stories and watch all kinds of live shows. So, I asked someone to get a priest with magic power to custom-make a paper plate for you. I’ll burn it for you later. It’s better than nothing. Look at the appearance, it’s good too…”</p><p>“I’ll keep your world-reading amulet. When I have a child in the future, I’ll give it to him to use. It can be considered a legacy. Hey, Dad, actually, I have a different kind of ease now. At least I won’t be forced to get married by your parents’matchmaker. The world is very wide, and I haven’t seen enough yet…”</p><p>The words at the end seemed funny, but in fact, there was a faint sorrow. Tian wanzhe knew that death was like the death of a lamp. What he said just now was just the expression of his emotions. It had nothing to do with his father, but with himself.</p><p>After a while, he placed the universal knowledge talisman left by the old man next to him. He planned to take out a paper version and burn it.</p><p>At this moment, the two white candles suddenly shook violently, and a cold wind blew in the mourning hall.</p><p>Tian Wanzhe didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. “What a coincidence. I almost got scared.”</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the universal knowledge talisman on the ground suddenly buzzed and emitted a faint crystal light.</p><p>“Who is looking for the old man? Don’t you know that he has passed away?”Tian wanzhe bent down and picked up the Universal Knowledge Talisman. Seeing that there was no corresponding name on it, he answered in confusion, “Hello, who is this friend?”</p><p>“Wanzhe, I am your father!”A voice carrying traces of drifting drifted out.</p><p>“Father?”Tian Wanzhe was both angry and amused. Who would joke at this time about having a son with no butthole?</p><p>Although the voice sounded like his father’s, the mourning hall in front of him was not a decoration.</p><p>He had to find out who it was and teach him a lesson!</p><p>“I’m in the netherworld. The surroundings are very scary, and there are screams everywhere…”at this point, the other party stopped and said in a low voice, “You suspect that I’m Fake?”</p><p>A father knows his son better than his father.</p><p>It’s not suspicion, but affirmation! Tian wanzhe answered silently.</p><p>Before he could speak.., the other party continued, “You peed your pants when you were three years old, fell into the water when you were seven years old, and almost drowned. Fortunately, I discovered it early and saved you in time. Because I was afraid that your mother would scold you, even she didn’t know about this matter. You Didn’t want to get married because there was a girl that you liked, but the other party didn’t like you…”</p><p>As the matter was revealed one by one, Tian Wanzhe felt a chill run down his spine when he heard it. The pale candlelight in front of his eyes flickered unsteadily, causing his face to turn pale green.</p><p>Was it really a call from his father from the Netherworld?</p><p>Wasn’t a person dying like a lamp being extinguished, with only the remnants of his obsession remaining, turning into an evil spirit?</p><p>Was he talking to a dead person?</p><p>Tian wanzhe, who had always been courageous, began to sweat profusely on his forehead. His waist and abdomen were tense, and his hair stood on end. His voice trembled as he said, “Father, you, how can you communicate with me, no, with the world of the living?”</p><p>“I was muddle-headed until I was scared awake by the terrifying scene around me. Then, I felt that my body had a subtle and hidden connection with the universal knowing talisman. It can be connected. Could it be the soul binding that you mentioned before?”The old man recalled.</p><p>“F * ck! The soul binding can be bound to the Netherworld after death…”Tian wanzhe blurted out, unable to contain his shock.</p><p>This function was too powerful!</p><p>The old man swallowed a mouthful of illusory saliva. “Wanzhe, I’m not afraid of death. I’m already old, but the Netherworld is too, too terrifying. Can you think of a way? Listen, this horrifying scream is the sound of a ghost being placed into a frying pan and exploding. There are also steel trees that can cut us in half. Also, I can’t go on. We’re already dead, yet we still have to endure this kind of torture. Moreover, I heard from the ghosts around us that we’ll be sent into reincarnation. We might become animals or hungry ghosts that will never have enough to eat…”</p><p>Tian wanzhe replied stiffly, “Father, don’t be anxious. You’ve just died, so it won’t be your turn for a while. Let me think of a way to see if I can ask the eminent monks and Taoists to bring you out. No, mother too.”</p><p>“Alright, Alright. I’m just reminding you. Don’t forget. I think it’ll be my turn in three months.”The old man paused for a moment, “The functions of the universal knowing talisman are restricted in the netherworld, and there are ghosts everywhere. I’m afraid that if I use it frequently, I’ll be discovered. Remember to burn the serial updates for me every day. Help me record the live broadcast. When I leave this Netherworld in the future, I’ll watch it slowly…”</p><p>Tian wanzhe’s mouth was half open, and his eyes were blank. He was stunned when he heard that. This was the first time he had heard of a dead person having such a request!</p><p>What kind of world was this!</p><p>“Oh right, wanzhe, you’re not young anymore. You Can’t just pursue love. You have to carry on the family line. In the future, when you die, only then will there be people to burn a serial for you to update…”the old man added.</p><p>Tian wanzhe’s gaze became more and more dull. This, this, even after death, he still remembered to force a marriage!</p><p>The call was cut off, and the chilly wind subsided. The white candle swayed gently, and the surroundings were silent. Everything seemed like a dream.</p><p>But the faint heat emitted by the universal universal sign in Tian Wanzhe’s hand told him that what had just happened was real!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
