Walking outside was like being in a steamer, and hot air surrounded them, giving people the illusion that their homes would be ripe at any time.</p><p>However, when a group of merchants entered a garden under the guidance of a beautiful maid, they immediately felt a cool breeze, as if a spring breeze was blowing on their faces. It was indescribably comfortable and pleasant. Looking Up, the trees formed a shade, and the water waves were slightly rising, between the lake and the mountains, there were many small courtyards and buildings. The layout was exquisite, and it was quite similar to the constellations in the stars, and it felt like it was connected to the Earth.</p><p>“Good Place! Good layout!”The leading merchant stroked his short beard and could not help but praise loudly.</p><p>With his strength as an exterior location, it was not difficult for him to see that there was a terrifying great array and forbidden spell hidden under the beautiful scenery of the garden. This made the people who lived here feel at ease.</p><p>The beautiful maid wore a thin skirt and covered it with a light veil, she smiled slightly and said, “It’s good for you to know that this garden is a famous place of my Luyang. It’s called the Little Sun Garden. It was originally the song family’s ancestral property. After the branch family split up, it fell outside of the direct line of descent. The children also liked to gamble and were lustful. In the end, they gave it to my family’s master and were specially used to entertain the honored guests.”</p><p>“Little Sun Garden… Song family…”the leading guest was stunned and said hesitantly, “Is it the song family of Luyang? There were several prime ministers in the previous dynasty and there was once a dharma body suppressing the song family of Luyang?”</p><p>The maid smiled and nodded, “It’s precisely the song clan of Luyang, one of the fourteen aristocratic families in the past.”</p><p>The guests were all amazed and looked around once again. They all sighed with emotion:</p><p>“I didn’t expect that we would have the day to visit and stay at the young Sun Garden of the song clan of Luyang…”</p><p>“If it was the previous dynasty, I’m afraid we wouldn’t even be able to get close!”</p><p>“As expected of the top aristocratic families in the past. Just a garden alone can give you a glimpse of the peak of the era.”</p><p>..</p><p>As the conversation continued, the head merchant nodded his head lightly. He let out a breath and said to the maid,</p><p>“Your master is indeed extraordinary, and he is full of sincerity.”</p><p>As he spoke, his gaze lingered on the lake and mountain scenery, and his heart was filled with mixed feelings.</p><p>For a newcomer like him who came from a poor background, relying on the rule of the human emperor and the teachings of the Devil Emperor to be fortunate enough to set foot on the external scenery, being able to enjoy the imposing manner of a top aristocratic family back then was truly wonderful!</p><p>In the previous dynasty, he was young and full of fantasies, but he had never had the extravagant hope of swaggering around a place similar to the song family’s little Yang Garden in Luyang.</p><p>Who would have thought that there would be such a day?</p><p>As he sighed, outside the Little Yang Garden, a horse carriage was parked. The body of the carriage was engraved with a cross of a blade and a sword, which was the symbol of the song family in Luyang.</p><p>The curtain of the carriage was half opened. A face with deep wrinkles at the corner of his eye was staring at the garden. His hair was white, and his temperament was decadent. The light in his eyes was deep.</p><p>The driver of the carriage waited quietly. His master, the current head of the song clan of Luyang, would always stop and look at the garden for a while every time he passed by, as if he was recalling the scene of his clan’s heyday.</p><p>“Let’s go to carefree building.”Song Quan turned his head slightly, closed his eyes, and sighed.</p><p>The Coachman was stunned. “Master, if we go to carefree building again, the old madam will scold us…”</p><p>“If we don’t go to carefree building, where else can we go?”Song Quan smiled bitterly and leaned against the soft back of the chair.</p><p>The Coachman didn’t dare to say anything more. He drove song Quan through the streets and arrived at the riverside where there were many flower boats. They stopped in front of a quiet little building.</p><p>Song quanlue was familiar with the roads. He asked for the usual private room and the world-famous carefree wine. He also asked for a courtesan who was good at playing and singing. Her voice was deep and clear.</p><p>“The same old rules.”Song quanlue nodded slightly at the courtesan. He walked to the Recliner and sat down. He poured and drank by himself.</p><p>The courtesan seemed to have gotten used to it. She sat down casually, played the lute, and sang a gentle and melodious tune.</p><p>Song Quan drank silently for a quarter of an hour. When he was slightly tipsy, he picked up the wine flask and slowly stood up. He walked to the window and pointed at the majestic mountain range opposite the boat river:</p><p>“Did you know? That place used to be the ancestral property of the song clan of Luyang. Within a hundred miles, all the minerals and spiritual herbs belong to me!”</p><p>The geisha seemed to have turned a deaf ear to him. She continued to play the lute and sing a beautiful tune.</p><p>Song Quan did not care or even need to respond. He took a sip of wine and said to himself,</p><p>“Once, yes, only once!”</p><p>“In the past, the song clan of Luyang swallowed up the southern kingdom and became famous all over the world. We were listed as one of the fourteen aristocratic families. For generations, there were members of the Political Affairs Hall who ruled the world together with the Zhao clan of Shen Du. Even if the important disciples of our family committed a major crime, they did not need to be punished.”</p><p>“In all parts of the Southern Province, how many mineral reserves and blessed lands belonged to our family? How many experts obeyed our orders? There were rumors that the other families of song Qi, Zhao Yi, and the other families in Luyang, where our ancestral residence was located, split up the rest.”</p><p>“I was born in such an environment, and I caught up with the raging fire that was burning like oil when Great Jin was at its final moments. I was extremely arrogant. Even though I was defeated by ‘frenzied sword’su Meng at the Qiong Hua Banquet, and I came to my senses and improved on my martial arts, I still thought highly of myself and did not take the ordinary experts seriously. My journey to enlightenment can be said to be glorious.”</p><p>He was a little chatty and said whatever he thought of. The singing courtesan who was playing the lute continued to play and sing. However, the tune gradually turned sad and combined with song Quanlue’s mood.</p><p>“At that time, I had a nickname called ‘Poetry Sword’. I liked it very much. Every time I felt smug, I would smoothly open my nine orifices. I felt the connection between heaven and man. I was half a step away from the exterior and rose to the top. I surpassed the disciples of ordinary aristocratic families and sects of my generation by an unknown number of times, not to mention ordinary people from the jianghu.”Song quanlue held his wine glass, looking at the distant mountains, he was still recalling the glorious days of the past. “When the human emperor came to this world, the Zhao family and the entire country were affiliated with him. All of these beautiful things were still continuing.”</p><p>“When the demon emperor passed down his techniques to the people of the world, allowing them to cultivate supreme-grade cultivation techniques, the various aristocratic families and sects also gained a lot from it. They comprehended many absolute arts and perfected the foundations of their families. The cultivation of their disciples became even more vigorous. Even though there were more and more people who were obsessed with understanding the world, those who made good use of these things began to strive for perfection. The achievements of one person could be compared to two or three people in the past.”</p><p>At this point, Song quanlue was a little confused. “When did the signs start to appear in the current situation?”</p><p>“Oh right, it started when the current human emperor cast a heaven-sealing platform, conferred the titles of Earth, Mountain, God, and City God, and added the supervision and protection of the divine path outside the original imperial court. It is no longer a lie to say that there are gods within three feet of one’s head…”</p><p>“Although the heaven-sealing platform was not fully completed, not only were the four upper levels damaged, but the three central levels were also affected. The number of deities that the human emperor bestowed the titles of Immortal, Immortal, uncle, Celestial Master, and other avatars and above was extremely limited. However, just the fact that every major city was guarded by a City God who was at the level of a great grandmaster was enough to make people revere him. This also caused the importance of the major aristocratic families and sects that had no avatars and could only use divine weapons to suppress their fates to drop drastically.”</p><p>“When it comes to the human emperor’s self-verification of legends, they are everywhere. In his eyes, the top aristocratic families and sects of the past are already ordinary subjects. First, they were deprived of the right to bestow blessings on us. They are no longer able to hold the position of overseer in the state city where they live. The Political Affairs Hall will definitely have a place of glory. All the officials in the imperial court must come from civil and military examinations. There are no exceptions… the City God’s land and other gods are the ones who are conferred meritorious deeds.”</p><p>“Next, all the aristocratic families and sects must declare their businesses and must not hide it. They must pay the same taxes and pay the same amount of food…”</p><p>“Finally, the officials of the imperial court and the secret agents of the six fans gate instigated the branches of the families to split up. Because the Supreme Dao was monitoring them, many sinister methods could not be used. They could only watch as these greedy people split up their ancestral businesses, just like the mines in that mountain range, just like the Nursery Garden…”</p><p>Song quanlue’s voice became a little desolate. “My old father, the Minister of the Great Jin, the right-hand man, shot. It was in such a powerless situation that his heart burned with anger and he died of depression…”</p><p>“I often think that if I had mad saber Su Meng, No, the talent and hard work of the immortal venerate Yuan Huang now, I would be able to attain the Dharma body as soon as possible, step into the Earth Immortal Realm, and become a Heaven Immortal. These things should be avoided…”</p><p>It was only when the book was used that one would regret not having enough books, and only when the power was strong enough would one feel weak!</p><p>“It should be avoided…”song Quan squatted down slightly and held his head. The white-haired old man was like a helpless child, muttering to himself with tears streaming down his face, “It should be avoided…”</p><p>The singing voice of the courtesan slowed down, and she sang in a low voice:</p><p>“I watched him entertain the guests, and I watched his building collapse! “I once slept soundly in this pile of moss and green tiles, and I watched the rise and fall of fifty years to my heart’s content. “That black-clothed alley is not surnamed Wang. Don’t worry about the ghosts of the lake crying at night, and the birds perched on the phoenix terrace. “The dreams of the ruined mountains are the truest, and the old territory is lost. I don’t believe that this map will be changed! “Make up a set of ‘mourning for Jiangnan,’and sing sorrowfully until one grows old…”</p><p>This was a song from the world that was well-known. No one knew who wrote it, and many of the allusions were unknown. But that kind of sadness, that kind of vicissitudes, that kind of pomposity had dissipated, the feeling of the bright moon not changing still made many people who experienced the change of dynasties and failed to live up to their expectations sympathize with each other. Thus, it spread.</p><p>“I saw him entertaining the guests, and I saw his building collapse…”song Quan sang along in a low voice. His voice was deep and hoarse, and it was indescribably sorrowful.</p><p>At this moment, the door was suddenly pushed open, and loud laughter was heard:</p><p>“A camel that dies from thin is bigger than a horse. The Luyang Song clan has preserved many properties. Not only do they earn a lot of money every day, but their disciples are also outstanding. In the future, whether they take the martial or literary examinations, they will have a way out. Brother song, why are you so dejected?”</p><p>Song Quan looked over and said in surprise, “Zhang Yuanli?”</p><p>The person who came was his good friend in his youth, Zhang Yuanli of the Zhang family in Longnan. Now that his father was still alive, he did not become the head of the family.</p><p>Zhang Yuanli looked like a middle-aged man, he laughed and said, “Brother song, the world is not up to people. If you can’t change the world, then you have to change yourself. Don’t you see that the Wang family in Zhou County is now fully developing the Academy’s business? With Wang Zai as the Chief of the mountain, they specialize in the path of the civil and martial examinations. They are once again prominent?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
