Hearing this, he nodded helplessly and sighed, “It’s not the first time that six paths has cheated people.”</p><p>He mainly cultivated the power of the mind, so his physical body was quite weak. Later, he relied on six paths’direct improvement to barely avoid being a burden. He had long wanted to change to an extremely high-grade martial arts cultivation method as a supplement or obtain a protective treasure that did not affect the power of the mind, this time, he was first pleasantly surprised, thinking that he had found an opportunity. Who knew that he would be banned by six paths with a single word.</p><p>The two of them looked at each other in silence. They did not even have the interest to discuss other information. They remained silent until the elegant girl Yu Jinghua, the Elf Bloodline Luan Yaqian, and the armored warrior Jiao Li returned. Of course.., they had also changed into the usual attire of the Great Zhou, covering up their own peculiarities, such as their pointy ears.</p><p>As soon as they entered the sect, Luan Yaqian said with a serious expression,</p><p>“The latest news is that the King of Jin, Zhao Heng, had a breakthrough a few months ago. He is now a genuine deity-level character!”</p><p>“Deity-level character?”Mao Jin sucked in a breath of cold air. He was actually unable to control his own voice, causing it to tremble slightly.</p><p>This mission would actually involve a deity-level powerhouse!</p><p>The terror of the god-devil level had left a deep mark in his heart. Even if his own team was properly prepared and had all the secret treasures, with the right timing, the right place, and the right people, they would be able to surround and kill an expert that was close to the god-devil level, however, the difference between the god-devil level and close to the god-devil level was the difference between heaven and earth. Even if there were another ten teams that were not inferior to themselves, they would still be annihilated without any luck.</p><p>The delicate-looking Yu Jinghua pushed up her glasses and calmly reminded, “This mission is only to infiltrate the imperial residence of King Jin for the time being, not to kill Zhao Heng.”</p><p>“That’s right. It’s not a death mission. No matter how ruthless and shameless six paths is, it’s impossible for us to deal with a godfiend level character.”Luan Yaqian heaved a sigh of relief. She had been too shocked and fearful just now and had lost her sense of propriety for a moment, fortunately, Jing Hua would use his calmness and insight to let everyone recover at times like this.</p><p>Mao Jin also heaved a sigh of relief and said emotionally, “A mythical-level character. This is a mythical-level character! The Nightmare World is indeed a nightmare world. Normal missions would involve a mythical-level character.”</p><p>“That’s right. I didn’t expect to meet a mythical-level character so casually. Although our samsara space is filled with dangers, we have never lacked training and encounters. However, with so many teams and so many experts, how many of them have become a mythical-level character?”Jiao Li said boorishly.</p><p>At this moment.., yu Jinghua spoke indifferently like a mo family mechanism, “According to the information gathered over the years, at least seven fiendgod-level characters have appeared in the reincarnation dimension. However, they are either confirmed to have fallen or have disappeared without a trace. They haven’t appeared since then. Currently, there are only two people that can be confirmed. One is the leader of the ‘Celestial Miracle’, ‘Primordial Lord of Heaven’, and the other is the leader of the ‘myth’, ‘Celestial Emperor’.”</p><p>“That’s right. Only fiendgod-level characters are able to control the two powerful organizations, the ‘Fairy Tale’and the ‘myth’, allowing them to maintain a relatively transcendent state within the Samsara Space.”Zhu Tianming nodded in agreement, “However, the ‘Primordial Lord of Heaven’of the ‘Fairy Tale’and the ‘Celestial Emperor’of the ‘myth’are both extremely mysterious. At the very least, I’ve never heard of anyone outside the two organizations who actually saw them, even if they were wearing masks at the time.”</p><p>Yu Jinghua pushed up his glasses again. “I suspect that they’ve separated from six paths after becoming godfiend-level characters.”</p><p>“Separated from six paths?”The other four were stunned and shook their heads, “Impossible. Even if godfiend-level characters have enough benevolence to complete the nightmare mission attached to the Higan talisman, the cunning and shamelessness shown by six paths won’t allow them to escape easily. Most likely, they’ve obtained a certain level of authority and don’t need to complete normal missions. However, when six paths needs to deal with certain matters, they’ll be the ones to take action.”</p><p>After saying that, they suddenly felt a sense of despair. If even the godfiend level characters were unable to escape from the cycle of reincarnation, what Hope did they have? They could only live as long as they could!</p><p>It was precisely because of this that they added the words after ‘most likely’to boost their faith.</p><p>Yu Jinghua said calmly, “There was once a member of ‘Celestial Miracle’who wanted to recruit me. At that time, I asked ‘is your primordial Lord of Heaven a reincarnator?’his answer was ‘once.’From all the signs, it is clear that he did not lie. However, we can not be sure about that. Perhaps the higher-ups of ‘celestial miracle’intentionally misled the other members. We can only say that the ‘Primordial Lord of Heaven’of ‘Celestial Miracle’has a high probability of escaping from the cycle of reincarnation after becoming a godfiend level character.”</p><p>After a short period of silence, Mao Jin suddenly laughed. “What are we discussing about the leaders of ‘Miracle’and ‘myth’For? What they do has nothing to do with us at the moment.”</p><p>As he spoke, Yu Jinghua had already taken out five metal sheets:</p><p>“The Universal Knowledge Amulet, a simplified version that doesn’t require identity authentication. It allows long-distance communication and dialogue without intervals. It also allows one to enter the world of universal knowledge. It has various convenient functions similar to the technological world.”</p><p>“It allows you to communicate from afar? How Far?”Mao Jin’s interest was immediately piqued, for the entire team, it was inevitable for them to split up. How to communicate and how to communicate was always a difficult problem for him as the team leader. Regardless of whether it was the products of the technological world or the magical or immortal creations.., they were always unable to completely satisfy their needs.</p><p>Yu Jinghua’s expression did not change as he said, “According to the information, there are no obstacles to the communication between the myriad worlds. In other words, different reincarnation worlds are also unable to isolate each other.”</p><p>“How is that possible? Are you bragging?”Jiao Li looked at the tiny metal sheet in disbelief.</p><p>“This is an accessory of the universal knowledge ball created by the Jade Void Palace’s immortal venerate Yuan Huang. He is a big shot that far surpasses the GODFIEND level. There is nothing impossible about it, and we won’t lose anything even if we try,”Yu Jinghua said.</p><p>Related to the immortal venerate Yuan Huang… a big shot that far surpasses the GODFIEND level… all sorts of thoughts crossed their minds, and the few of them took it with some doubt.</p><p>At this moment, the lofty and indifferent voice of the master of six paths of reincarnation rang in their ears:</p><p>“The universal knowing talisman is limited to the use of our nightmare world. It will be automatically destroyed once it leaves.”</p><p>They looked at each other, their gazes interlocked, and Jiao Li suddenly slapped his thigh. “F * ck! It really can communicate with different worlds of reincarnation!”</p><p>If that wasn’t the case, why would the master of six paths of reincarnation restrict the use of the universal knowing talisman?</p><p>Luan Yaqian also said hatefully, “Shameless six paths!”</p><p>Zhu Tianming smiled bitterly and said, “Six paths is just a little better. No matter how you scold him, he won’t get angry, and there won’t be any punishment.”</p><p>They had completed missions in several technological worlds, and the universal sign of knowledge was guided by novices. They quickly figured out the specific functions and were not too shocked.</p><p>After studying it for a while, Zhu Tianming said with surprise and joy, “That divine skill can be downloaded directly from the Southern Wilderness teaching website!”</p><p>No purchase, no cultivation, just reference. There should be no problem!</p><p>He quickly completed a series of operations, and then he was completely at a loss.</p><p>“What’s Wrong?”Mao Jin, who was still waiting for him to share his experience, asked.</p><p>Zhu Tianming looked lost again, “Six paths, six paths blocked the download function. The teaching live broadcast was full of snowflakes, and the relevant discussions could not be shown…”</p><p>“Ruthless! Six paths is really determined to lose face!”The burly man Jiao Li clicked his tongue, but he was also full of helplessness because he and the others couldn’t resist at all.</p><p>“This shows that the Yuan Emperor Immortal Venerable’s Universal Knowledge Talisman can effectively threaten six paths’good work system…”Yu Jinghua said faintly, showing a rare emotion.</p><p>There was another period of silence. The people who had long been used to it recovered and went straight to the myriad realm mall at the same time. This was the most useful thing for them.</p><p>After studying it carefully.., mao Jin sighed, “The Ten Thousand World Mall has as many items as the six paths in terms of martial arts and Immortal Dao. However, the products of all kinds of strange worlds are relatively scarce. On this point, the six paths is indeed extraordinary.”</p><p>“It’s the same for high-end items. There are very, very few treasures in the Ten Thousand World Mall, such as divine weapons, Magic Treasures, and immortal pills. However, you don’t have to complete the mission with a slim chance of survival. You just have to pay the price that the other party is satisfied with,”Luan Yaqian said.</p><p>As they analyzed the differences one by one, Yu Jinghua suddenly opened his mouth:</p><p>“In terms of treasures, weapons, elixirs, and so on, according to my calculations, six paths is cheaper. The quality is still uncertain.”</p><p>“That’s right. Six paths far surpasses gods and demons. For him, making weapons and refining pills may only take a few seconds. Moreover, there are ‘coolies’Like Us who sell the items to him cheaply. It’s impossible for everything in the nightmare world to be personally made by immortal venerated Yuan Huang.”Mao Jin and the others were not surprised by this.</p><p>Yu Jinghua said calmly, “In other aspects, the myriad realm mall is better, but six paths has already warned us not to buy such items. Even selling them has a certain limit.”</p><p>The few of them were stunned again. There was only one thought in their minds. was there a need for six paths to completely block them? Would it kill them to let them earn a little? !</p><p>“Forget it. Let’s discuss the mission first,”Mao Jin said as he looked at Yu Jinghua.</p><p>Yu Jinghua was already prepared. “Judging from the fact that even the normal version of the universal symbol needs to be verified by household registration, will the imperial residence of King Jin allow people of unknown origins like us to enter?”</p><p>“Fake household registration?”Zhu Tianming suggested.</p><p>“The universal symbol connects all the household registration in the Great Zhou. The fake will definitely be discovered,”Yu Jinghua rejected bluntly, “The six paths did not send us directly to changle. Instead, they sent us to such a remote small city. Clearly, they wanted us to obtain the real household registration.”</p><p>“The real household registration?”Luan Yaqian asked doubtfully.</p><p>Yu jinghua nodded and said, “It’s similar to a remote city. There are many hidden households that live in the mountains and are not connected to the outside world for a long time. They don’t have a household registration.”</p><p>“But the newly registered hidden households might not be able to pass the examination of the Prince Jin’s residence.”Mao Jin was very experienced.</p><p>Yu Jinghua said confidently, “The strength of a remote city is limited. We manipulate the minds of the officials to deceive them and replace the household registration of similar people. Then, we register them under the newly registered hidden households. For ordinary people, it doesn’t matter whether they have just been registered or not. They won’t notice.”</p><p>“Alright, let’s do it!”Mao Jin thought about it and felt that this method was feasible, so he made a decision.</p><p>After a period of busyness, they became the “Real”citizens of the Great Zhou dynasty. They looked to the southeast and were hesitant and nervous:</p><p>“Changle, we’re Here!”</p><p>They hoped that they could get a good harvest and that they wouldn’t be discovered by gods and demons.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
