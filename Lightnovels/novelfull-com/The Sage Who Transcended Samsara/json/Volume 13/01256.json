He took a step back and stepped from the warm and energetic “Life”into the cold and silent “Death.”.</p><p>Emperor Fengdu turned around completely and his body, which made people look up to him, slowly moved forward:</p><p>“I’m talking about your scheme.”</p><p>“I changed my mind and chose another method because I was worried that the Higan behind me would find out that Qiankun in my sleeve was carrying Guangcheng, Wen Shu, and other powerful figures.”</p><p>It seemed that it was not easy to find out that Guangcheng Zi, Wen Shu, Guangfa, Chi Jinzi, master Yu Ding, and other powerful figures were hiding in Qiankun in his sleeve or his inner view world, it was just like how Gu Xiaosang hid in the acupuncture point on Meng Qi’s left hand and was not discovered by the gold emperor. However, it was not the case. The latter’s current state was far inferior to that of the Yuxu sect, and Meng Qi had yet to step into the destiny realm, so there was a clear gap between them, even though they were all causes of karma, it was difficult for them to completely suppress the influence of their strength on the Karma Connection on the secret of heaven. It was easy for the other side behind Emperor Fengdu to sense it.</p><p>If the Green Emperor specifically covered up this aspect, it would easily cause a problem where there was no silver.</p><p>However, that was not the main point. The main point was that the plan that Meng Qi had once thought of, a thought that had only passed through his mind, was actually seen through by Emperor Fengdu with a single word. In front of him, it was as if there were no secrets to speak of. It was truly terrifying!</p><p>Meng Qi seemed to have been affected by this impact, and he took another step back, his tone subconsciously turned cold. “Those who have not separated from their enemies and friends explore the origin of life and death. If I do not make preparations, then I would be as stupid as an ox. I tried to bring my fellow senior brothers and sisters into my sleeve with the universe. I did not take the initiative to harm them. I only acted as a backup when you made trouble. What’s wrong with that? “And I did not carry it out in the end!”</p><p>As he said this, his lips moved a few times as if he wanted to ask a question, but he still forcefully held it back.</p><p>At the legendary realm, being able to examine one’s thoughts and the suppression of one’s spirit and Aura did not seem to be effective anymore. However, this was only referring to situations that would drag on for a longer period of time. For example, after leaving a seed of failure in the other party’s spirit.., it would only be triggered after a period of time. In this way, the other party would have long ago examined his thoughts and eliminated the negative effects. In a face-to-face fight, if he could bring enough impact to the other party’s soul that he would not be able to examine and eliminate it in an extremely short period of time.., this would also result in the opposite effect.</p><p>Emperor Fengdu’s tall figure stepped forward, giving Meng Qi a stronger and stronger sense of oppression:</p><p>“What do you want to ask? Are you asking if I deduced what I said just now?”</p><p>“Humph, not only do I know about this, I also know what you’ve done after you gave up on this plan!”</p><p>“Using me and Zhen Wu to separate life and death, it’s easy for Qi to guide each other at the origin. As long as there’s a catalyst, he can instinctively draw his sword to trap me and create a collision between those who have reached the perfection of the bitter sea. It’s easy for you to use the yin-yang seal to move the origin of life and death and refine part of it!”</p><p>“And the ‘Life and death book’In Your Hand seems to protect you from being ‘assimilated’by the Dao for a short period of time, but in fact, it is catalyzing this kind of thing that is guided by Qi!”</p><p>“If all of this fails, you will use the tree of Great Dao to create chaos and collapse the origin so that you can escape!”</p><p>The details of the plan were narrated in detail. Emperor Fengdu seemed to have been listening to it by Meng Qi’s side. As he spoke up to this point, his voice became even more majestic, like the rumbling of thunder:</p><p>“Answer me. was what I said right or wrong?”</p><p>Each word was like a curse that shook Meng Qi’s true spirit, causing his expression to change slightly. He took another step back. It was as if his soul had been greatly impacted, but his lips were tightly shut. He did not blurt out the tacit agreement of “How do you know?”.</p><p>Emperor Fengdu stopped in his tracks and said with a condescending attitude and aura,</p><p>“In so many eras, there have been too many examples of people dying because of greed. The former Heavenly Emperor was one, and now you will be one too!”</p><p>His tone sounded ancient.</p><p>Meng Qi suddenly smiled and said calmly, “Fellow Daoist Fengdu, don’t bluff. I have always known my limits…”</p><p>Before he finished speaking, a green branch full of vitality appeared in his right hand. One leaf, one universe, and one heaven. It was the “Tree of Great Dao”that could absorb the nine Netherworlds in the immortal world.</p><p>As soon as the tree of Great Dao appeared, it glowed and extended into the abstract concepts around it. At the same time, the life and death scroll that Meng Qi protected his body spun rapidly. Black and white intersected, and yin and Yang danced wildly.</p><p>He made a prompt decision as if he wanted to use all means to create chaos and escape.</p><p>At this moment, a branch appeared in Emperor Fengdu’s hand. It was crystal clear and embedded with the seven treasures of Buddhism. It gave off a strange light and was full of the aura of the Great Nirvana.</p><p>Compared to the Bodhi magical tree that had once suppressed the demon Buddha, there were obvious cracks on one of its branches!</p><p>This was the seven treasures magical tree, the Dharma artifact of the ancient Bodhi Buddha!</p><p>The seven-colored light turned and gently brushed down. The tree of Great Dao was brushed off from Meng Qi’s hand and his life and death thin brush was slanted to the side. At the same time, Buddha’s will surged and enveloped both of them at the same time, it turned them into mosquitoes in amber, unable to move!</p><p>With just one strike, Meng Qi’s preparations were completely destroyed!</p><p>Behind Emperor Fengdu was Bodhi ancient Buddha! He was actually willing to give the seven treasures wondrous tree to the other party? Meng Qi’s eyes were filled with shock, and thoughts emerged in his mind.</p><p>Emperor Fengdu suddenly laughed:</p><p>“I don’t have a powerful figure behind me, because I am one myself!”</p><p>He actually knew what Meng Qi was thinking. It was even more terrifying than his telepathic understanding!</p><p>He was one himself? Meng Qi’s eyes revealed a look of realization and fear.</p><p>The Bodhi ancient Buddha had cut three corpses into Dao. One of them was a quasi-lift Daoist, and the other two were unknown.</p><p>So Emperor Fengdu was one of the Bodhi ancient Buddha’s three corpses!</p><p>No wonder he had always been mysterious. Even the Golden Emperor did not know about it! No wonder he could obtain the seven treasures magical tree directly! No wonder he was so powerful and confident. He dared to say that he could destroy most of the experts in the hollow jade temple with his full strength and make all of Meng Qi’s arrangements useless!</p><p>That was because he was an important figure on the other shore!</p><p>Of course, Emperor Fengdu’s path of life and death was not perfect. In terms of strength, he was not on the other shore yet. Otherwise, he would not have needed to get rid of the true force and enter the origin of life and death. However, he had the consciousness of the other shore, which was full of mysteries and mysteries, it was hard to compete with him!</p><p>— condensing an illusory dao fruit with the same foundation was not an exclusive relationship. The predecessors could do it, and so could the successors. It was just that the more such foundations produced illusory dao fruits, the lower the probability of the successors succeeding, then, the probability of the successors succeeding was lower. The path did not only have to be smoother and smoother. There was also the saying of “Traffic jams.”The successors were easily influenced by the predecessors of the corresponding Dao and could not find their own path.</p><p>After Emperor Fengdu used the seven treasures wonderful tree to brush the tree of Great Dao and the Book of life and death, he raised his left hand and reincarnation appeared. The six whirlpools were misty, like a dream, about to envelop Meng Qi.</p><p>At this moment, the abstract concept behind him suddenly surged, like boiling water overflowing. Emperor Fengdu’s heart moved, and he noticed that more than half of it had already been divided!</p><p>This..</p><p>A treasure wheel that seemed to be in control of the Dao of life and death flew out from the abstract description. Black and white light scattered in all directions, stirring the origin of life and death and bringing about endless waves of life and death.</p><p>Amidst the surging waves, emperor Zhenwu’s body suddenly trembled.</p><p>Meng Qi’s expression was calm. He took this opportunity to slash out the overlord blade. Purple Lightning overflowed and charged at the seven treasures wonderful tree. Taking advantage of Emperor Fengdu’s short-lived flaw, he pulled out the “Book of life and death”and directly exploded it!</p><p>The possibility of you being one of the Bodhi ancient Buddha’s three corpses was something I had already deduced using the exhaustive method!</p><p>Back then in the pure eastern glazed earth, I had hypothesized that the other side was your backer. As a result, I discovered that there were three situations that were the most dangerous.</p><p>The first was that you had the green emperor behind you. After he achieved the other side, he went back in time and placed you as a chess piece in the past, changing history. As a result, there would be a logical contradiction where he achieved dao after and you built the Netherworld without being discovered in the past, however, this can only be hidden from us. As a person on the other shore, how could the gold emperor not notice the change in history?</p><p>Two, the gold emperor deliberately erased part of his memory when he left the DAO mark, so that little sang would not know of your existence. However, the problem was that unless the gold emperor “Saw”little sang would escape from his control at that time.., otherwise, there was no need to hide it.</p><p>The third was that you were not the subordinates of the big figures on the other side, which was themselves. In this regard, little sang had once told me that the second of the Bodhi ancient Buddha’s three corpses was mysterious and difficult to know. It was not difficult to connect the two!</p><p>Therefore, in order to prevent this most dangerous possibility from happening, I had deliberately unsealed the special Sanskrit that the quasi-ti Daoist had given me previously. I had sealed the key thoughts and sent out the seemingly correct information. Everything you know is what I let you know!</p><p>This was the reason why Emperor Fengdu was able to understand his own thoughts and arrangements. Back then, in order to trap the quasi-taoist and Bodhi ancient Buddha, he had sealed the special Sanskrit in the depths of the Sea of mind, and he would unseal it from time to time, he pretended to inadvertently sound it, so that he would not be caught off guard when he was really about to lay out a plan. Anyone would feel that there was a problem if the special Sanskrit name that had not been returned suddenly came to him, and he had to maintain continuity!</p><p>The reason why little sang did not mention this situation was that once he went from plotting against the Fengdu Emperor to plotting against one of the Bodhi ancient Buddha’s three corpses, it would involve himself. It would be very easy for him to have a sudden inspiration, even if there was the cover-up of the primeval Lord of Heaven and the Green Emperor, there was still a possibility!</p><p>That was why she said that the wheel of life and death of the heavens would be left as a backup to guard against any accidents. What kind of accident was she guarding against? She was guarding against this accident!</p><p>Bang! In Meng Qi’s cold gaze, the life and death book exploded, and the origin shook.</p><p>Emperor Zhenwu’s eyes suddenly opened, and there was a hint of purple in them.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
