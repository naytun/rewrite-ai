The guards carrying lanterns patrolled quietly. The night wind blew without any noise. It was as if the previous movements had never existed. Or rather, it was just a rat in a pavilion. It was not worth mentioning.</p><p>In the imperial study, the son of Heaven, Xiao Xuan, looked down at Li Zhongkang, Lu Siquan, and the others with his hands behind his back. He said calmly,</p><p>“Take this Buddha lamp with you.”</p><p>“Oh?”He raised his head and looked over. His eyes were filled with confusion and shock.</p><p>..</p><p>The red flames churned, penetrating the forbidden technique and burning the core of the mansion. Meng Qi succeeded in one strike and did not stop. He escaped into the sea of clouds and left.</p><p>Even if he did not kill all his targets this time, there would be a next time. It would be a next time. If he was entangled because of this, he would lose the advantage of being able to come and go as fast as the wind and choose a random place. Things would be much more troublesome.</p><p>Just as he was roaming around Qingming and preparing to move on to the next location, he suddenly had a thought and turned his head to look at the capital.</p><p>“Li Zhongkang and the others succeeded?”Meng Qi muttered to himself.</p><p>As a creator god who had grasped almost all of the current situation and information, even if he wasn’t able to see what the variable was, he would still be able to detect it the moment it moved and disturbed other tributaries, as such, he had already sensed that the variable had left the palace and was currently at a certain location in the capital.</p><p>It seemed that his move to conquer the world had indeed taken away all the experts in the capital. It had led grand preceptor Pei Daotong by the nose and prevented him from taking care of other matters. As such, the palace was empty, the ninth king, Xiao Kun, Li Zhongkang, and the others naturally had a chance to take advantage of this and succeed.</p><p>After thinking for a while, Meng Qi once again condensed a flaming dragon. It was like the Sun, piercing through the sky and quietly returning to the capital.</p><p>After entering the city secretly, he did not go to the agreed place to check the secret symbol left by Li Zhongkang and the others to obtain the latest news and the meeting place. Instead, he followed his own sense of the variables, passing through the streets and alleys, and directly headed there.</p><p>This was the ability that he had never told Xiao Kun and Li Zhongkang and the others about. This way, he could go straight to the point and avoid falling into the traps and surveillance in the process. Moreover, he could also secretly spy on them first to prevent accidents from happening.</p><p>Along the way, Meng Qi found that the capital was open and tight, just in time for the most important items to be stolen. Moreover, there was a relative shortage of experts. The forbidden spell formation was on the verge of being triggered.</p><p>After arriving at an Kang market, he slowed down his footsteps. From time to time, he would flip through the items on the street stalls and taste the snacks. He looked like a strolling person. Only when he was close to the alley where the variable was located did he bend down and pass his left hand to a fortune teller, while circulating his supernatural ability, he quietly sensed his surroundings and asked, “How is my luck recently?”</p><p>Other than Li Zhongkang and the others, there were no experts lying in ambush or existing within a thousand feet of the courtyard..</p><p>Lu Siquan was guarding beside the variable. He was relatively calm. Bi Zhongde and Li Zhongkang paced back and forth, looking a little anxious and uneasy. Yes, this was very normal. After stealing the “Variable”that Xiao Xuan relied on, after being stuck in the capital, very few people could remain calm and unworried..</p><p>The three of them did not talk. were they too nervous and anxious to speak?</p><p>..</p><p>The fortune teller carefully looked at the palm lines, then looked at Meng Qi’s face. He shook his head and sighed. “Your temple is black. Sigh, was it not smooth before?”</p><p>If it was not smooth, who would suddenly think of coming to fortune-telling?</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, he saw a piece of silver thrown over. The person in front of him stood up and left, entering the crowd.</p><p>“I, I haven’t finished speaking…”he looked at the silver in his hand, feeling absurd and at a loss. He had planned to scare the other party into a great disaster, so he had to ask the statue of patriarch three purities from him to go back and pay tribute to it in order to resolve it.</p><p>He walked around the alley and sneaked into a nearby courtyard. After careful observation, Meng Qi confirmed that there was no ambush around the “Variable”.</p><p>Of course, with the strength of a sixth Kalpa realm master, as long as there was something abnormal here, even if he was in the palace city, he would still be able to stop it in time.</p><p>While he was thinking, Meng Qi was about to enter the courtyard where Li Zhongkang and the others were when he suddenly frowned. He retracted his spiritual sense into one layer and covered his body. He reached out his right hand, and lightning and Sparks flew together. They formed and condensed at the same time.</p><p>..</p><p>In the courtyard, a black box filled with weird characters was placed on the table. ‘variables’were stored inside the box to isolate his aura and prevent others from sensing him.</p><p>Lu Siquan was sitting beside the table. His eyes were half-opened, and his hands on his knees were making a heart-calming seal as if he was resting with his eyes closed. Li Zhongkang and Bi Zhongde could not sit still at all. They kept walking back and forth, looking at the sky and outside the wall.</p><p>Suddenly, their vision blurred. A figure in a black robe appeared in front of them. His face was thin, and his aura was lofty. He was none other than the ‘cloud gathering spiritual master’, Meng Qi.</p><p>“S-senior, H-how did you find us?”Li Zhongkang was very surprised by Meng Qi’s sudden appearance. He actually stuttered when he spoke.</p><p>At this moment, Lu Siquan suddenly opened his eyes and said with a smile, “Senior, don’t blame us for being surprised. According to the secret symbol left behind, we should have met you somewhere else.”</p><p>He reasonably explained Li Zhongkang’s accident.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded. “I understand. It’s just that I have an inexplicable feeling with the ‘variable’and can determine its location, so I was too lazy to go through all the trouble and came straight here.”</p><p>“I see.”Lu Siquan turned around and picked up the black box, pretending to hand it to Meng Qi.</p><p>Just when Meng Qi’s gaze was focused on the black box and wanted to see the true face of the ‘variable’, Bi Chongde, who had been silent all this time, suddenly took out an item. It was surrounded by purple gas, like a strange bell with life.</p><p>The heart-stopping Bell!</p><p>Just because there were no other experts lying in ambush did not mean that no one had made a move!</p><p>Bi Chongde shook the bell lightly. The bell seemed to have contracted and expanded. It let out a clear and melodious sound that reverberated in the air. It went straight into the soul, penetrated through the body, and shook the soul!</p><p>In the tinkling sound, except for Bi Chongde, who was holding the heart-stopping bell, Li Chongkang and Lu Si’s eyes were dizzy. Their bodies were shaking as if they were about to fall.</p><p>“You borrowed a corpse to resurrect your soul. Your body and primordial spirit are not compatible. Why didn’t you leave your body quickly and faint on the spot!”Bi Chongde shouted through gritted teeth.</p><p>Traitors were often more ruthless than their enemies!</p><p>At this moment, he saw Meng Qi’s gaze looking over. It was clear and bright, without any confusion. It reflected his figure and the heart-stopping bell in his hand clearly.</p><p>How was this possible?</p><p>He could actually block the heart-stopping bell?</p><p>Didn’t they say that he was an immortal venerated of Dao sect who had descended to the mortal world and that his body and mind were different?</p><p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, Meng Qi advanced instead of retreating. With a flash of his figure, he had already touched the black box. However, there was an additional palm at the other end of the box. It was as white as jade, as if it was made of glass. The two formed a balance, neither of them was able to pull the other.</p><p>There was actually another person in the room. Meng Qi’s senses from before and from what he had seen and heard, he had yet to discover this person!</p><p>It was only when he made his move that he felt as if he had come to reality and could be seen!</p><p>Looking up, Meng Qi saw a familiar face. It was a handsome and carefree face. It was his usual self, and his aura was so familiar. However, it lacked the bitterness and deep depravity.</p><p>“Ah Nan? Devil Buddha!”</p><p>Meng Qi blurted out and recognized the identity of the newcomer,</p><p>since the Bodhi magical tree was taken away, the seal was loosened. Sure enough, a little bit of the Devil Buddha’s consciousness leaked out and started to stir up trouble!</p><p>No, what he could reveal was his consciousness, just like his current self. He could only obtain a certain level of power, and it was impossible for him to set up a forbidden spell that could seal the god of creation in this place!</p><p>He still had helpers!</p><p>“Demonic Dao, Surrender Now!”At this time, an angry shout suddenly came from the sky like thunder. The Shadows of the Gods of the Heavenly Court appeared around Pei Daotong, and he punched out a punch that could topple mountains and overturn seas.</p><p>The punch was not aimed at Meng Qi, who was fighting with the Devil and Buddha for the black box, but at the bottom of a hundred-year-old tree outside the Ankang market.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The old tree collapsed and its branches and leaves were ignited. Lightning snakes and Flaming Dragons suddenly appeared and formed a vortex, forcefully catching Pei Daotong’s fist.</p><p>Beside the tree, a figure appeared. It was another Meng Qi.</p><p>When he entered the courtyard where Li Zhongkang and the others were staying, he had considered that the matter of sealing the origin projection would definitely involve the consciousness of the other shore. The matter would not be so simple, so he had to be cautious, he had relied on the ability of void creation to create a temporary incarnation. He had relied on eighty to ninety percent of the source of the change to conceal himself. Then, he retreated far away and his incarnation entered. Only then was he able to resist the influence of the heart-stopping bell and narrowly avoid a calamity.</p><p>However, that Bell was indeed evil. Even though he was far away outside the workshop, he had a slight fluctuation, which was detected by Pei Daotong’s keen senses.</p><p>Just as he blocked PEI Daotong’s punch, Meng Qi’s figure suddenly disintegrated. He turned into streaks of long arcs of lightning and merged into the Lightning Snakes and flaming dragons that he had created. He fled in all directions, making it difficult for people to tell where his real body was.</p><p>Devil Buddha Ananda, who was holding the other end of the black box, suddenly smiled and said,</p><p>“Your Majesty, Make Your Move!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
