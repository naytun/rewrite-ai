It was as if the stars were flowing on the ground, surging with brilliance and bustling with excitement.</p><p>A man wearing a bamboo hat was dressed in a black suit with a long knife hanging from his waist. He walked slowly against the crowd on the street, moving in waves.</p><p>Suddenly, a drunkard stumbled over and almost touched his body, but the airflow was like a tidal wave, dragging him away.</p><p>“Qin Kuan? Why are you so depressed?”The man in the bamboo hat stopped and looked at the drunkard. His voice was low and sounded a little old.</p><p>The Drunkard said in a daze, “You, you know me?”</p><p>“Qin Kuan, the lonely swordsman who fished on a lonely boat and enjoyed the river snow all by himself. How many people in the Jianghu don’t know him?”? “Heh, there might have been a time when the world wasn’t well-informed. Now, the video of you being defeated by the white-clothed marquis has been a hot topic for a long time. Could it be that this defeat has made you depressed and use alcohol to Drown Your Sorrows?”The man in the bamboo hat’s tone was a little sarcastic.</p><p>The Lonely Swordsman and the white-clothed Marquis Qing were both well-known figures in the latest generation of the man roll. Compared to the Inhuman on the Earth Roll and the Gods and Buddhas all over the sky on the Heaven Roll, they were truly down-to-earth. There were many followers and imitators in the world well-informed.</p><p>Qin Kuan burped and said,</p><p>“Who are you? is my love of drinking bothering you?”</p><p>At this point, he laughed out loud, “The people of the world laugh at me for being crazy, and I laugh at the people of the world for being stupid. The end of the Apocalypse has already arrived and the end of the era has long been widely spread. Even the current human emperor and the Taoist sect master of the Hollow Jade Temple of Kunlun mountain have not denied it. Haven’t you all come to your senses yet? “Seizing the opportunity to have fun in time is the truth of the Apocalypse! “Don’t wait until the world is broken and the era is over before regretting that you didn’t know how to enjoy yourself back then!”</p><p>The man in the bamboo hat was speechless for a moment. He pondered for a moment before he said, “The underworld will be established, and death will not end. Although the era is over, there may be protection, but how will we know the specific situation until then? Giving up early is equivalent to cutting off one’s own path of survival.”</p><p>Qin kuan chuckled and said, “That’s why I said, what’s the use of cultivation? What’s the use of martial arts? When the apocalypse comes, it’s easier to find protection. After death, there will be someone to rely on, and you can enjoy extreme happiness. If you’re lucky, you can still survive the end and live until the next era!”</p><p>He held the wine pot and stood up unsteadily. He left aimlessly. The man in the bamboo hat looked deeply at his back and did not stop him.</p><p>“Buddhism and Luoism love to preach about the end of calamity and the end…”the man in the bamboo hat sighed and continued forward. He passed through the bustling street, bypassed the common market, and came to the side of the Jade Belt Bridge. It was close to the yeshui that carried the lights of thousands of families.</p><p>There was a man standing by the bridge. He wore a scholar’s robe and a sash. He looked dignified. Yue Zhiyuan was standing with his hands behind his back, waiting.</p><p>“Brother Wang, you’re in a good mood.”The man in the bamboo hat smiled slightly.</p><p>The person who came was the chief of the 72nd Academy of the Wang family in Zhou County, Wang Zai. He had a beautiful beard and looked somewhat medieval. His hair was dyed with spots of white, indicating the passing of time.</p><p>“Brother Yan, you have come to Ye city. How can I neglect my honored guest?”Wang Zai answered with a smile.</p><p>The Man in black took off his bamboo hat and revealed a square and hard face. There was a weathered look on it. It was Yan Chong, the “Long river of Blade Qi.”.</p><p>He chuckled. “I knew that strolling around Ye city like this would draw out brother Wang.”</p><p>“Why are you looking for me?”Wang Zai asked, puzzled.</p><p>Yan Chong smiled. “I’m just here to see you. In My Generation’s top ten, other than the noble girls of Langya and the Ruan family, all of them have yet to break through and have yet to give up. It was a spur of the moment for me to travel around. I want to meet my old friends, verify each other, and look for an opportunity.”</p><p>He was talking about Wang Zai, who had entered the top ten and was ranked first on the human roll.</p><p>Wang Zai was rather touched by his words, he said with a sigh, “After the remnants of the Shura Temple were consolidated by the demon master, Luohou disappeared. ‘Purple Pole Sword’Cui Zhe was left at home, and his spirits were already low. Shangguan Heng and Grandmaster Wenren an became busy in the future. The pure Yang heavenly strategy had profound morals, true martial yang, and extraordinary talent. Unfortunately, they all died in the end, which was a pity. Only the five imperial sabers were left, and the Martial Arts Fanatic’s true foundation was fully developed. Compared to you and me, they were not inferior either. There was hope for both of them.”</p><p>He told Ruan Yushu, Yan Chong, and the other people in the top 11 of the human list.</p><p>“Brother Wang, you don’t leave Huan Province, but you can see clearly for thousands of miles. It’s as if you saw it with your own eyes. It’s exactly the same as what I felt on my journey to the west,”Yan Chong said sincerely. Cui Zhe, Shangguan Heng, and Wenren ‘an had indeed lost their spirit.</p><p>“That’s normal. As long as the people before us don’t die early, they will become immortals and gods. That’s against common sense.”Wang Zai Sighed.</p><p>Yuan emperor Su Meng, Supreme Divine Sword Jiang Zhiwei, and calculating all the people, Wang Siyuan, suddenly flashed through Yan Chong’s mind. He blurted out, “He jiu has also attained the Dharma Body?”</p><p>Wang Zai nodded. “I just received the news a day ago. He Jiu has attained the non-phase sword Qi true body.”</p><p>“It’s not easy for him either. He has been suffering for so many years.”Yan Chong was silent for a long time before he sighed.</p><p>Other than the “Wolf King”tie sheng and “Big Luo Demon Girl”gu Xiaosang, who had died early, the masters who were ranked before him in the human ranking list were all in the immortal class. The more terrifying ones had already formed their own destinies, they were known as the great supernatural powers!</p><p>Wang Zai looked at Yan Chong carefully, suddenly, he laughed and said, “The water vapor and blade intent in brother Yan’s body are mixed and surging like a vast ocean. Every orifice can faintly hear the sound of the ocean tide. It washes the body from time to time and cleanses the body. The inner view of Heaven and earth is so magical. I’m afraid it’s not far away from the Dharma body.”</p><p>Although Yan Chong was serious, after listening to Wang Zai’s explanation, he could not help but smile. “Brother Wang, you really live up to your reputation. Your Vision is as sharp as a torch, and your insight is profound!”</p><p>As he spoke, he also observed Wang Zai, and then he frowned slightly, puzzled, he said, “Brother Wang, your great spirit is strong to the extreme, and it’s full of vigor. It can resist evil from the outside and strengthen oneself within. It already has all the signs of breaking through the pass and becoming a dharma body. Why are you still not willing to try?”</p><p>Wang zai smiled and said, “The branch of benevolence saint emphasizes on accumulating strength and developing strength. Previously, I rarely taught and helped the world. I was lacking in this aspect, so I have to make up for it before I dare to try…”</p><p>Before he could finish speaking, the two of them thought of their own accumulation of perseverance and self-tempering. For a moment, they had a tacit understanding and smiled at each other.</p><p>In the ye capital, the meeting of the two great grandmasters was only one of the many trivial things in the real world. It was a prosperous and worldly appearance. In the Jade Void Palace of Mount Kunlun, in the three clouds island of the twenty-eight worlds of the Seven Seas, in the nine Immortals Mountain that hung high in the sky, and other places.., in the Buddhist kingdom on Earth, in the hometown of vacuum, and in the ancient region, pairs of eyes that contained layers of heaven, earth, and rivers of stars all looked toward the Great Zhou’s changle and toward the heaven-sealing platform.</p><p>Meng Qi, who was sitting upright in the quiet room, retracted the divine light in his eyes. They were as deep as primal chaos. Across thousands of mountains and rivers, he stared at his big brother who was looking up and at Shaoxuan and Xi’e who were on high alert.</p><p>The half-year period had arrived!</p><p>Suddenly, a clear cry came from the sky. It was so beautiful that it sounded like the voice of a Great Dao. The green light took shape and turned into clouds. It carried an ancient ranking board with golden light shooting out in all directions and landed on the heaven sealing platform. There were three bright jade inscriptions on it:</p><p>“God Ascension Ranking Board!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
