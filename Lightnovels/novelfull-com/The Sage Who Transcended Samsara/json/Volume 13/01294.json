Then, they gradually blurred and turned into stars. The stars shone like a sea, illuminating all the worlds.</p><p>Han Guang’s body became a legend, proving the third kind of phenomenon!</p><p>When this image was formed, streams of pure white light rushed out of the palaces in the blessed land where the ‘myth’organization was located. Some contained the sun and the moon, some were surrounded by strong winds, some dripped rain, and some looked down at the mountains and rivers, all of them converged into the anomalies of the Sea of stars, as if they had a subtle connection with the true form of the immortal realm’s nine Hades.</p><p>In the vast sea of stars, meteors slid down like raindrops. They swept across the sky, dragged their light tails, and descended into the nine Hades. They surrounded Han Guang, making him seem like a lofty and lofty God!</p><p>The Shadow of an ancient seal appeared in Han Guang’s eyes. The Immortal Realm’s nine Hades appeared, and the illusory meteors immediately drilled into the corresponding acupuncture points, emitting endless white light.</p><p>These were all part of the authority of the celestial world that he had seized!</p><p>The human body had a god, and every acupuncture point and internal organs had a “God spirit”. The inside was the original self, and the outside was connected to the heaven and earth. At this moment, the gods returned to their places, and the demons took shape. One thought of the Heaven Court, one thought of the nine underworld.</p><p>This body was the heaven and earth, and this body ruled over everything!</p><p>At this moment, a high-pitched cry suddenly sounded, and a handsome white crane flew out of the Void with a jade box in its mouth. It circled the heaven sealing platform, tilted the box, and dropped the dao talismans that flickered with different lights.</p><p>“The Supreme Emperor has bestowed the Human Emperor Nine Heavens 24-grade divine talismans!”</p><p>The divine talismans flew down and shone brightly. They were refined from part of the immortal world’s authority collected by the celestial venerable of morals when the heaven fell.</p><p>Gao Lan bowed and allowed the 24-grade divine talismans to surround him like a curtain. Then, he pointed with his finger and drew the human emperor sword. He used the 24-grade divine talismans to cover the pivotal area of the heaven-sealing platform, where the god-ascension roll was located!</p><p>The Heaven and earth shook again, and ripples appeared in the void. From the initial chaos, there was a pattern. With the heaven-sealing platform as the center and the god-sealing board as the core, some meteors flew out from Han Guangqiao and returned to the heaven-sealing platform.</p><p>Seeing that, the green wood in the Netherworld and the light that had frozen the monster of the Heavenly Dao disappeared. A green rainbow pierced through the third layer of the immortal world that was about to disappear. It directly penetrated the seal of the Gray Stone Hall and entered the highest layer.</p><p>..</p><p>While all the attention was focused on the heaven-sealing platform and the god-sealing roll, interweaving in the air and the nine Netherworlds, outside the snow-covered great snowmountain that had not melted for a long time, Wang Siyuan, who was as beautiful as a woman, was looking at the top of the White Mountain, the world of ice-sealing.</p><p>A zither and a long sword floated around him as if there were two invisible maids holding it. His face was sick again. Sometimes it was pale, sometimes it was dark red, and his eyes revealed an uncontrollable pain, however, it could not wash away the crazy feeling in his body.</p><p>At this moment, Wang Siyuan’s gaze was deep. The nine immortal tombs were reflected in his eyes.</p><p>..</p><p>The phenomenon in the sky disappeared. The Heaven sealing platform had completely merged with the god Ascension Roll. It was more majestic than before, and more solemn than before. The statues of gods were lifelike, as if they could walk out of the stone wall at any time, most of them even had a faint luster. Some were pale white, some were scarlet red, some were golden yellow, some were green, some were gorgeous purple, and some were mixed colors between the two of them, such as red and white, golden red, golden green, green purple, and so on, and in the middle, there was a tall view surrounded by purple qi, mixed with strands of pure white.</p><p>His eyes were deep, and he looked around with dignity. Suddenly, he stretched out the human emperor’s sword and took out a divine book of the nine heavenly constellations. He said solemnly,</p><p>“The way of man is the heavens. I hereby bestow upon you the title of God and Ghost. I hereby bestow upon you the title of the ruler of the Great Zhou Empire and the son of heaven. I hereby bestow upon you the title of the ruler of the heavens and the earth: Shao Xuan, a descendant of the human emperor. He has performed meritorious deeds and has shown kindness to the human race. He has shown compassion to the living beings. He shall be the ruler of the stars and the head of the purple clouds. I hereby bestow upon you the title of the ruler of the purple clouds!”</p><p>The familiar words appeared once more, but everything was no longer the same. The image and divine name of the star Lord of the Ziwei Star that corresponded to the heaven-sealing platform suddenly shone brightly and shot out into the sky. The sky changed color and the Sea of stars appeared once more. The Ziwei wall connected to the stars in the outer world, a wisp of purple mist shot down and fell into Shaoxuan’s Niwan.</p><p>Purple Light Rose, and the stars swayed as if they were bowing down. Shaoxuan sensed the vast and terrifying dao of the stars and experienced the rush of the sea of bitterness. The starlight was like a boat of transcendence, and his realm and strength suddenly rose to a higher level.</p><p>By the time the purple mist subsided, he had changed into a new set of clothes. He wore a high crown and purple robe, with a seal on his body. It was ancient and sacred. He bowed respectfully to Gao Lan and said, “I, Shaoxuan, thank you for the favor of the human emperor. I will rule the stars and promote the Human Dao.”</p><p>Gao Lan nodded slightly and took out another divine book of the Nine Heavens Yingyuan Puhua heavenly venerate. He pointed the human emperor sword at Xi e and said,</p><p>“Human Dao is the heaven, and the gods and ghosts are conferred. I, Gao Lan, hereby announce to the heavens and the earth that I am the ruler of the Great Zhou and the son of Heaven Wan Fang. I, Xi E, am the descendant of the royal family. I Am Benevolent and benevolent, and I will protect the human race. I will overcome all obstacles and light up the world. I will be the heavenly venerate of the Ministry of Thunder, and I will be in charge of punishment!”</p><p>Before she finished her sentence, Xi e’s face was already filled with shock, mixed with some emotion. Because Han Guang had seized part of the authority, the orthodoxy of humanity had some flaws, and it was extremely difficult. Even if the Grand Supreme Old Lord bestowed a 24th grade divine book.., it could at most bestow the titles of two third level gods, which was the level of star Lord Zi Wei, the goddess of Dou Mu, the mystical maiden of the nine heavens, and the heavenly venerate of the Ministry of Thunder. The legendary mighty figures who had obtained the divine position and the divine position could immediately be in charge of the authority, from there, they would be able to step into the blessed realm. Although they would definitely not be able to reach the peak of this level, they could still be considered as genuine great divine arts practitioners.</p><p>Under the circumstances that they could only bestow upon the two of them, Xi e originally thought that Gao Linghong would take one of them and use the power of the blessed realm to protect himself. Who would have thought that he and Shao Xuan would actually be given the title!</p><p>To her, who had stagnated in her strength and had been stuck at the blessed realm for a long time, this was a great benefit!</p><p>The heavenly venerate statue and God’s name of the Ministry of Thunder on the Heaven sealing platform lit up. Dense Mist gathered in the high sky and struck down bolts of lightning one after another. They were of all colors and surrounded Xi’e, forming an ancient spear shadow that burrowed into Xi’e’s body.</p><p>The lightning flashed and disappeared. Xi’e wore a black robe and a high crown on her head. Her Majesty was concealed and she looked like a heavenly venerate who was in charge of punishment.</p><p>She bowed with gratitude and respect and said, “I, Xi’e, thank you for your kindness, human emperor. I will follow you wholeheartedly, use my power, and punish you justly.”</p><p>Gao Lan nodded slightly. His gaze was deep, as if he had seen through time and space. He looked at the god-sealing world and the god-whipping whip that the jade void palace had never mentioned.</p><p>..</p><p>In the Gray Stone Hall, in front of the inscription Yang Jian had erected, Meng Qi sighed and said,</p><p>“Senior Green Emperor has already entered.”</p><p>Back then, Lu Ya had asked him to deliver a sentence to medicine master Wang fo that said, “The highest level of the nine heavens”. This showed that the green emperor was paying attention to this!</p><p>Beside him, the Smiling Guang Chengzi appeared. He shook his head and said, “How can we be faster than the big shots on the other side?”</p><p>“What is so special about the highest level of the nine heavens that it attracted senior green emperor?”Meng Qi seized the opportunity and casually asked Guang Chengzi.</p><p>Wen Shu, the Guangfa Celestial Master, Chi Jingzi, the jade tripod master, consort three firmament, Maitreya Buddha, the burning lamp ancient Buddha, the unfettered King Buddha of the world, the Ping Tian Grand Sage and the rest of the destiny-level abhijnas also stepped into the Gray Stone Hall, their expressions were not obvious, and their auras were deeply hidden. It was difficult to see their emotions and emotions.</p><p>Guang Chengzi chuckled, “After the heavenly emperor attained the Dao, the highest level of the immortal world forbade outsiders from entering. During the battle back then, the few celestial masters and Buddhas directly stepped into it. We could only clear the lower levels, so how would we know?”</p><p>As expected… Meng Qi thought to himself. He stepped forward, passed the stone stele, and reached out his hand to press on the ancient Rusty Green bronze door. The eyes of the great divine arts practitioners behind him were like deep pools, and it was hard to find any clues.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
