Instead, he began to examine his thoughts from the beginning to the end. The more he examined, the more he eliminated the fear of the other shore towards the Devil Buddha. The more he felt that there was a certain possibility, although it was quite crazy, it was not without reason.</p><p>Moreover, the “River of predestination”was a test. There would not be any life-threatening danger. It was only right to try more. He could not just watch for a while and retreat, right?</p><p>The only problem was whether this would stimulate the “Devil Buddha brand”and cause it to mutate, bringing bad consequences. However, considering that the Devil Buddha was in the seal and couldn’t release its power, and the brand was balanced with the absolute blade itself.., even if he lost control, it was still within a certain range. Meng Qi made up his mind and decided to try it out.</p><p>Once he had a direction, the rest were the details. After focusing on analyzing for a while, Meng Qi pulled out the gorgeous and heavy purple saber and took a step forward, once again stepping into the illusory “River of Destiny.”.</p><p>The “River of time and destiny”around him was once again prominent. It rolled and flowed, never stopping, resisting the erosion of the river of destiny. Meng Qi relied on the characteristics of his own shore and sank into the bottom of the water like a stone, taking root in the moment, not entering the tributaries.</p><p>The spiritual light of his nature shone down from an infinite height. He did not trace back to the past or look into the future. He only carefully understood all the information of the current node. The absolute saber was covered with a layer of purple lightning that was close to black. The light burst out and hit each other, an intense and terrifying aura was stirred up.</p><p>At the same time, Meng Qi sent out his divine sense and sank into the absolute blade. The Endless Sea of lightning that was formed by the ancient lightning pool was shrouded in darkness. It was swept by the wild wind. Lightning Dragons connected the sky and the “Water surface”, it created a dense forest scene.</p><p>The Lightning Sea was divided into two. Half was noble purple, and the other half was deep darkness. The two were not clearly separated. They were constantly eroding each other, melting each other, and bursting out lightning that illuminated the darkness.</p><p>The purple rolled. Every drop of lightning and every bolt of lightning seemed to contain a god, a god that connected all worlds and controlled electromagnetism and lightning punishment. In the deepest part where they gathered, there was a purple saber shadow floating, and the darkness was deep, the water of lightning and lightning were both born and extinguished. They were connected with endless malice, endless sinking, and endless killing. They interweaved at the bottom of the ocean and brought a strange rhythm, as if they were pregnant with something that could destroy the world, this was the manifestation of the battle between the absolute blade and the “Devil Buddha brand”.</p><p>After Meng Qi ascended to legend, he had been trying to help the absolute blade remove the brand left behind by the Devil Buddha. However, its essence was mysterious and mysterious. Even if its power was not too strong, it was still as difficult to get rid of as a piece of candy, he could only rely on day after day to slowly build up his winning momentum and eventually transform it into a qualitative change.</p><p>Looking down from above, looking down at everything and taking the situation into his heart, Meng Qi’s glabella suddenly split open, and an ancient glass lamp that could not be described with color flew out. It seemed to be both illusory and real, illuminating the surroundings and lighting up the cause and effect universe, it completely reflected all the connections between the current situation.</p><p>The bright star lines were densely packed around, and there were countless of them. They symbolized the various confirmed “Present”in the past. They had countless connections with meng qi, this external “Variable,”and they focused on themselves, with the “Accidental”coupling that the founder of Void Mountain had predicted, they were able to create numerous branches and exhaust the future. However, every possibility contained the ending of “Meng Qi failing the test.”.</p><p>The general trend was hard to change. “Accidents”were like the mantids in front of the wheel of history. They were hard to stop, and they were all in the other party’s calculations.</p><p>Taking a deep breath, Meng Qi suppressed all kinds of emotions and thoughts. He was like a heavenly venerate in the chaos, looking down on the mortal world like a Buddha, directly operating the “Cause of all fruits”!</p><p>The ancient glass lamp suddenly shone brightly, destroying all darkness and darkness. Then, it slowly rotated, like a millstone, causing the bright star lines to rotate along with it.</p><p>The rotation became more and more intense, and the illusory river water began to form rolling waves. space-time trembled, and the cause and effect were on the verge of losing control.</p><p>All the current conditions surged forward, along with the connection. If Meng Qi was not a legend and had the cause of all fruits, he would have long been overwhelmed by this terrifyingly complex information flow, like a green jade doll.</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi, who stood like a reef, stretched out his hands. He continuously changed his hand seals and formed dao one.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>An illusory sound burst out. The ancient glass lamp brought all the current situations to the absolute saber, causing the “River of destiny”to shake violently. The waves surged, and there was no longer any quiet flow of the eternal “Elegance.”.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Thunder shook the sky inside the absolute saber. Destruction and new life were everywhere. There were purple lightning and black rays that were baring their fangs and brandishing their claws. As soon as the ancient glass lamp entered, it rotated in the opposite direction, transferring the entangled connections to the deep, dark sea of lightning one by one.</p><p>Tampering with karma and crossing the sea without the knowledge of the heavens!</p><p>Under the illumination of the cause of all karma, the dazzling star lines did not resist. They were so dense that they made people dizzy. They fell like rain toward the sinking sea of lightning, which symbolized the brand of the Devil Buddha.</p><p>As soon as they came into contact with the dark lightning and penetrated the surface of the ocean, the fierce wind and huge waves suddenly erupted. Billions of lightning rays merged into one and slapped toward the ‘Dao Yi glazed lamp’like a tide.</p><p>Half of the ocean was empty, and a dark figure sitting upright in the void appeared. There were nine heads and 26 faces. There was no proportion, no symmetry, and everything was chaotic and crazy, the 24 arms held the white bone rosary beads, the human skin wooden fish, the pitch-black flames, the terrifying chaos, and other things. It was like a manifestation of the world’s Great Terror, great destruction, great destruction, and great madness, it was the shadow of the buddha-defying demon body!</p><p>Just as the destructive lightning penetrated reality and illusion, the other half of the purple lightning ocean suddenly had a drastic change. All of the Lightning in the Lightning water contracted and merged with the shadow of the blade, making it seem real.</p><p>The shadow of the purple blade flashed and cut off the dark waves that were slapping at Dao Yi and the other glazed tiles.</p><p>The threads of karma fell and stuck to the body of the shadow of the Devil Buddha. It repeatedly used the karma technique, but it was temporarily suppressed by Meng Qi’s circulation of all the karma and combined with the power of the absolute blade.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The Thunder whimpered, and the darkness in the sky dissipated. All the connections were temporarily transferred to the Devil Buddha brand.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The river of predestination almost broke into pieces, raising huge waves. The river water became strangely turbid, unable to deal with the “Variable”of the Devil Buddha brand. Whirlpools appeared one after another, and it was extremely chaotic.</p><p>In such a change, the future might split again, and a part of the branch that did not exist in the past appeared. It was illusory and ethereal, as if it could disappear at any time.</p><p>This was the chance!</p><p>The image of time and the river of fate suddenly appeared in Meng Qi’s eyes. His mouth opened, and he let out a loud voice, wanting to control fate and guide the future!</p><p>..</p><p>In the main hall of the Zhixu Mountain sect, the middle-aged scholar, who was the sect leader, did not have the slightest bit of grace. He started arguing with the black-robed old woman once again.</p><p>Suddenly, they heard an illusory explosion. Time around them instantly became chaotic. Sometimes it was fast, sometimes it was slow. It was very strange, and it was quite inconceivable. and the source of all this was the secret area of the sect.</p><p>“What’s going on?”The two of them suddenly stood up and instantly appeared in front of the ancient bronze gate. They found that Yue Ziqing was trying to enter.</p><p>It was already dark around them. An illusory river that came out of nowhere cut through the sky and flowed into the distance. With the ancient bronze gate as the node, there were countless tributaries behind it that were difficult to measure. At this moment, each of the tributaries was shaking violently, the old ones were constantly disappearing, and new ones were constantly appearing.</p><p>Could it be that Su Meng had found a way to cross the ‘River of predestination’? They looked at each other in shock. They wanted to learn from Yue Ziqing to see what was going on.</p><p>At this moment, a grand and solemn voice sounded from the sky above the illusory river. It came from an infinite height:</p><p>“If I become the other shore, then there will always be a glimmer of hope in the matters of the world and the endless difficulties!”</p><p>“If I become the other shore, then there will always be a glimmer of hope in the endless troubles of the world?”? The middle-aged scholar, the black-robed old woman, and the others looked at each other in dismay. It was as if they had walked into the Buddhist scriptures, walked into the history of the sect, and came to the part where Buddha was recorded!</p><p>Su Meng had completed the test of the ‘River of predestination’?</p><p>Could he pass it without the other shore?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
