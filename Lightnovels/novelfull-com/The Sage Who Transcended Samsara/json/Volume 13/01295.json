Even with Meng Qi’s current strength, he could still feel the obvious pause, as if there was a great divine ability user supporting him from behind.</p><p>The rusty green door slowly opened. Meng Qi’s heart was as still as water, like a flat mirror, reflecting the reactions of the great divine ability users behind him. He wanted to find some clues and see what had happened in the past.</p><p>Silent, peaceful, ancient well, deep pool… Red Essence, Daoist master Jade Cauldron, Empress Three Heavens, ancient Buddha burning lamp, and so on could all be described with such words. There wasn’t the slightest clue.</p><p>As expected, they are all old fellows who have lived for all eternity… Meng Qi thought to himself. The scene behind the door had already appeared in front of him. There was no dense fog, no multicolored light, no halls, pavilions, and no distinction between heaven and earth. It was a dark void, it made people instinctively think of “Ruins”, “Dao”, “Return”and other associations.</p><p>It seemed that the battle on the other side had basically destroyed the highest level of the ninth heaven. The remaining parts were broken into pieces. They either fell into the Yuxu Mountain with the falling heavenly court, or scattered in this boundless darkness.</p><p>Just as he stepped into the boundless darkness, Meng Qi felt his true body and dao body disintegrate. He wanted to return to the void and nothing, as if he had fallen into the chaos that melted all things.</p><p>A dark and gloomy Qing cloud rushed out from above his head. It seemed to contain all things. It was the very beginning, but it also seemed to be able to melt everything. It was the ultimate end.</p><p>Rays of light hung down. The chaos was like water, enveloping the surroundings. It made Meng Qi look like a god that looked down on all things. He walked into the depths of the nothingness.</p><p>Behind him, Guang Chengzi’s large sleeves fluttered. His body was towering. A clear Qing cloud about an acre in size flew out from above his head. It was like a torrential wave. It surrounded three lotus flowers. One was green and ancient, and it was abnormally heavy, it was as if the sky was falling and the Earth was buried within it. A purple gas curled around it like a bell. When it shook slightly, it caused the hearts of the great divine arts practitioners to ripple. There was also one that was Yang and yin-free. It shone with millions of golden lights, but it also gave off a feeling of calmness and inaction.</p><p>This corresponded to the appearance of the three flowers formed by the illusory Great Dao. Guang Chengzi’s surroundings immediately became clear and hazy, forming a world of its own. The void lingered around him and was assimilated by him. He was worthy of his name as a celestial venerable.</p><p>Meng Qi also took the opportunity to observe the techniques of his fellow disciples from the Jade Void sect and other great powers, trying his best to understand more.</p><p>Celestial Master Wen Shu, Guang Fa, used the Taoist Qing Yun as his root, but he produced five lotus flowers of wisdom. The void at the core was hazy and hazy, and its color changed. It was like a round mirror. Its main body did not move, but reflected everything in the outside world. It contained all kinds of things and contained all kinds of daos, it was almost limitless.</p><p>This was an alternative path of all daos that she had taken with the emptiness of Buddhism and the wisdom of the great round mirror.</p><p>The clear light shone, and the void was not empty. It seemed to have many seconds of accumulation, and no longer had the power to melt and disintegrate. It was just that time and space were chaotic, and it could only calm down a little.</p><p>Seeing this scene, the ancient Buddha with the lamp burning, the free king Buddha of the world, Maitreya, and other great Buddhist abhijnas sighed secretly. They felt that Wen Shu was indeed the embodiment of the five great wisdom.</p><p>Round after round of perfect Buddhist light appeared behind the ancient Buddha Lamplight’s head. Some were transparent like a mirror, some were golden like glass, some were green and hazy, some were purple and noble, and some were pure white and flawless. There were a total of twenty-four of these, in the layers of layers, one could vaguely see an endless Buddhist kingdom that spanned across hundreds of billions of tribulations. In the center of the Pure Land, there was an ancient glass lamp that shone with the light of cause and effect entangling from the source of the sea of bitterness in the mortal world.</p><p>Maitreya was the same as before. Flames appeared above his head, and within the light, a pure white lotus appeared. The white lotus bloomed with flower petals, revealing the constellation at the bottom. With a jade pendant attached to his body, the golden body of the future star Buddha with twenty sixteen arms opened its mouth, he spat out two crystal-clear sariras that contained the white lotus.</p><p>The Buddhist light surged like a wave, surrounding the SARIRAS. It made one ancient and ancient, displaying the countless tribulations of the past. The other sat in the center, using the boundless light to save all living things.</p><p>As the light appeared, a white lotus appeared out of thin air and transformed into a Buddhist kingdom on Earth.</p><p>The world’s unfettered King Buddha was a young and handsome ancient Buddha. He wore an ancient monk robe, revealing pale golden skin. It seemed that there was no need to change. His golden body was constant, and there was always a carefree smile on his face, at this moment, a glazed “Buddha”word appeared on his forehead. The “Buddha”word, which was formed by countless characters, transformed the surrounding void into a pure land.</p><p>It was said that before Amitabha, ancient Bodhi Buddha, and Buddha Lingshan attained the Dao, he was the oldest Buddha in Buddhism. He had lived for more than three eras, but once he reached the other shore, the stronger he became, the older he became, no one could clearly say who was the first to create Buddhism.</p><p>In addition, the most powerful bodhisattvas and others also used their own divine abilities to cross the void.</p><p>More than half of the Buddhists’good fortune was gathered here!</p><p>Meng Qi had estimated that there were only a little more than ten great divine ability users in the current Buddhist sect, and they were no longer in the peak condition that they used to suppress many big forces. From this, it could be seen that they had suffered heavy losses during the Battle of Lingshan, not only did the powerful Buddhas such as the Vairocana, Buddha Akimbo, and Buddha Baisheng fall, but even Ananda Kaya, a rising star, betrayed them and passed away in meditation. Moreover, the whereabouts of Pu Xian and Guan Yin were also unknown from then on, wen Shu even jumped out of the Buddhist League. If it weren’t for the Bodhisattva who advanced to the destiny realm, there wouldn’t even be ten great divine arts practitioners.</p><p>On the other hand, the majority of those who died in meditation in the hollow jade temple were legendary mighty figures, currently, there were still Guang Chengzi, Celestial Master Guangfa, Chi Jingzi, perfected Jade Tripod, immortal venerable daoxing, Nezha, himself, and Yang Jian, who were not sure of their specific realms. They had reached a total of eight great divine arts practitioners, they were already approaching the Buddhist faction.</p><p>The Numinous Treasure faction had gone through the two incidents of God Ascension and the fall of the Heavenly Court. Their tragic situation was even worse than that of the Buddhist faction. At least, Meng Qi had only seen five great divine arts practitioners. After consort San Xiao was resurrected with the help of the green lotus seed of chaos, her cultivation level had changed, now, she had barely stepped into the destiny realm. They each used their innate virtue to form five waves of clear Qi that surged above their heads. They each surrounded the primordial golden dipper, the Golden Dragon Scissors, and the Heaven Measuring Ruler, three peerless treasures, they were used to resist the void and the chaotic time.</p><p>Among the other two, one wore an ancient Daoist robe. He had a red face and yellow beard. He had a tall crown and big sleeves. He was aloof from the outside world but his sword intent was bursting out. He stood proudly in the darkness of the void without showing any signs of divinity, he felt that his power was not inferior to Guangcheng, the ancient Buddha with the burning lamp, and the unfettered King Buddha. Judging from his attitude toward the other great divine arts practitioners, Meng Qi suspected that he was the heavenly venerate of many treasures, one of the nine Great Divine Arts Masters of Dao sect. The remaining one was a woman in a plain green Daoist robe, her eyes were sharp and full of vitality. She did not look ancient. It was obvious that she was a new powerful cultivator from the green touring palace who had only reached the destiny realm after the antiquity age.</p><p>The rest of the ABHIJNAS did not enter for the time being. The ancient Buddha and the heavenly venerate were here, so they chose to put some distance between them. After all, this world had already collapsed. It could not be everywhere, nor could it be covered by divine sense. It did not matter if they entered first or entered later.</p><p>Among them, the one who left the deepest impression on Meng Qi was the ancestor of the Earth Immortals, the Great Immortal Zhenyuan, who was the same as the rest of the world. Now, he was the “Acting divine messenger”of the twelve divine messengers of the Luo sect, he had the demeanor of a true immortal. His aura was so long that it seemed to span the ages. He was on the same level as the lamp-burning ancient Buddha and the heavenly venerate of many treasures.</p><p>His gaze swept past Red Essence, perfected Jade Cauldron, and the others. Just as Meng Qi was about to go deeper, he suddenly heard Guang Chengzi’s voice:</p><p>“Junior Brother sect master, it’s better for us to move forward together. Burning Lamp, Zhenyuan Zi, and the others probably have bad intentions toward you.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly and moved to the side. The group from the Hollow Jade Temple formed a formation, and they traveled through the void like gods, they pulled away from the Buddhist forces, the demi-human forces, the LUOISM forces, the remnant forces of the ancient heavenly court, and so on.</p><p>At this moment, an object floated over from the empty darkness in front of them. It was half a stone tablet, and time flowed like water.</p><p>Meng Qi activated his wisdom eye and focused his gaze. He saw that there was a paragraph written on the stone tablet with vague dao patterns:</p><p>“I swept through the Old Gods of the nine heavens, subdued all the saints of the demi-human race, and flattened the old ghosts of the Earth. Only then could the heavenly court be established…”</p><p>The incomplete language was used to describe the process of the establishment of the Heaven Court. Although there was only half a stone tablet left, Meng Qi could still feel the twists and turns of the process. It was as if he could swallow the entire world and dominate the entire world.</p><p>The Heavenly Monarch was born in the celestial world and he was an innate god. He held the corresponding authority, but this did not mean that he could command the other innate gods to be above him. Furthermore, even though the demon emperor was hidden, the demon saint was still there, the great sages of the monster race were able to roam freely between heaven and earth. In addition, the innate spirits such as Zhenwu were able to protect one side while the human race worshipped the ancestral spirits. They had their own totems and spirits, but it was not the heavenly monarch’s will. Hence, they were willing to obey him.</p><p>While Yuan Shi and morality were supporting him, Amitabha Buddha, Bodhi ancient Buddha, and Lingshan Buddha were also hindering him. The heavenly monarch was able to wipe out the old gods in the nine heavens step by step. He was able to subdue the monster race and wipe out the old ghosts on the ground, the fact that he had single-handedly created the Heavenly Court was enough to show how powerful he was in all aspects!</p><p>Therefore, this monument was written to record the establishment of the Heavenly Court.</p><p>Unfortunately, prosperity had an end. The heavenly court that had once suppressed everything was only a broken wall. Only this half of the stone monument floated in the void, silently expressing the arrogance of the past.</p><p>When the half of the stone monument approached, it sensed the aura of the great divine arts practitioners. All of a sudden, blurry dao patterns lit up, spewing out a dignified, supreme, and terrifying aura, condensing into an illusory figure of an emperor, light flickered in his eyes and shot out time like water.</p><p>In an instant, Meng Qi felt as if his surroundings were pure white and pitch-black. He had completely lost his sense of the outside world.</p><p>Just a bit of Aura left by the Heavenly Emperor on the stone tablet was triggered, and it already had such a terrifying power!</p><p>Meng Qi immediately shrank the Qing Yun and turned his body into an origin point that contained countless possibilities to resist the erosion of time.</p><p>When everything returned to normal, the great abhijnas around him were all gone. Only half of the pavilion floated in front of him. Dim yellow candlelight shone from within!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
