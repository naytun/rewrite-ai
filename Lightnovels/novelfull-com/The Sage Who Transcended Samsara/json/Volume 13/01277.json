He raised his angle of view to the level where the spiritual light of his nature was. He could see the void overlapping, overlapping everywhere. There was no distance between any two points. Only the illusory river of time flowed quietly, he did not give up day and night.</p><p>In this state, he “Saw”the remnants of the fall of the Heavenly Court, the destruction of the nine heavens, and the disappearance of the twenty-four heavens. He saw the traces of the collapse and dispersal of the heavens, so he leaped onto them, it was as if he was about to rush out of the river of time and enter true chaos.</p><p>When this feeling became more and more intense and more real, Meng Qi’s eyes suddenly lit up. His vision was filled with a dense fairyland. This place was high in the sky, and the light did not diminish. The Sea of clouds beneath his feet was loose and stable, it made people feel as if they were traveling in outer space. They could see immortal birds, auspicious beasts, spiritual plants, and strange flowers everywhere. They were all species that had been cut off from the world for a long time. It was as if the ancient mythological era had arrived.</p><p>In the center of the Fairyland, there was an ordinary palace. There were three words written on it that could not be recognized but could be understood by itself:</p><p>“Dou Shuai Palace!”</p><p>As soon as Meng Qi entered this fairyland, he had a feeling that the illusory great dao condensed by his own family had nothing to rely on. It was as if he had come to a “Country”that did not recognize them.</p><p>This place had its own morals, its own rules, and its own Dao!</p><p>“Why are you here, Hierarch Su?”Just as Meng Qi was comprehending his surroundings and sensing a little difference, a silver-robed boy walked out from Tuotuo Palace. He cupped his hands and cupped them in greeting with a smile.</p><p>Silver-horned king… Meng Qi thought to himself and returned the greeting with a smile:</p><p>“I have been in charge of the hollow jade temple for a period of time. I should have come to pay my respects to Martial Uncle Dao de a long time ago. It is just that I have not been able to fulfill my destiny and have no face to meet my elders. That is why I have been delayed until today.”</p><p>The silver horn king chuckled and said, “Sect master Su is too polite. The great master has already instructed that if you come, you should be welcomed inside.”</p><p>After he finished speaking, he half-turned his body and made a welcoming gesture.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled as he took a step forward. At the same time, he said politely, “You are a boy under Martial Uncle Dao De, and your age is much older than mine. I have the audacity to address you as senior brother.”</p><p>The silver horn king revealed a slightly satisfied expression. “That’s fine, that’s fine. Call me senior brother silver horn, so that I won’t be confused with senior brother Gold Horn.”</p><p>As they exchanged pleasantries, the two of them crossed the threshold one after another and stepped into Dou Shuai Palace. They passed through numerous halls and pavilions and arrived at a simple and elegant room.</p><p>There was only a table in the room, and on the table were a few pages of Golden Books. Sitting cross-legged behind it was an old man in Daoist robes with white hair and a young face. In front of him was embroidered a black and white yin-yang fish winding into a taiji pattern. The rest were ordinary, as if they were ordinary people, it was as if it was a law that everyone was used to when the world was operating naturally.</p><p>Was this one of the oldest people on the other side? The heavenly venerate of morality from the three pure ones? Meng Qi suppressed the various emotions in his heart and bowed respectfully. “Disciple greets Martial Uncle Dao de.”</p><p>The eyes of the old man with white hair and a youthful face were half-opened, and his voice was old and ordinary:</p><p>“Since you’ve already paid your respects, then it’s time to go back.”</p><p>Meng Qi stared blankly for a moment, then his mind raced, he tried to sound him out. “Martial Uncle Dao de, thank you for bestowing the ‘Dao de Jing’and allowing me to pretend to be Li Dan to preach the Dao. Only then will I understand the truth, sever my previous life and my next life, and break free from the control of the Devil Buddha.”</p><p>It wasn’t strange to be courteous, but gratitude was never wrong!</p><p>At that moment, the heavenly venerate dao de opened his eyes. They were like two mirrors, reflecting the scenes of the myriad worlds in the heavens. He could even distinguish the nine Hades of the immortal world from the various places near the Dao. If one looked closely, they would see black and white yin-yang fish, it was spinning slowly, as if it was about to turn into a deep vortex that led to another era, the myriad worlds in the heavens.</p><p>He spoke slowly and asked in a low voice,</p><p>“Who is Li Dan?”</p><p>Who Is Li Dan? Meng Qi was stunned. He did not understand. Suddenly, he had an epiphany and laughed out loud:</p><p>“I am Li Dan!”</p><p>“If that’s the case, why are you thanking me?”The celestial venerable of morals flicked his sleeves and stood up, leaving with his hands behind his back.</p><p>Meng Qi didn’t stop him, nor did he chase after him. Instead, he smiled. He flicked the back of his left hand leisurely with the five fingers of his right hand. It was as if he had eaten a ginseng fruit. All the pores on his body opened up, and he felt relaxed.</p><p>So that was it… that was it!</p><p>He slowly stood up and walked to the table in front of the Celestial Master of Morals. He looked down and saw that the few pages of the golden book were called the “Eight-nine arcane art”!</p><p>These were the chapters from the legends and later realms… Meng Qi nodded slightly and picked them up. He used his spiritual sense to probe into the contents written in the bright red jade script. These words were derived from dao patterns, they were best at describing high-level cultivation techniques. Of course, the other shore of the eight-nine arcane art and the embryonic chapter of the Dao fruit were directly represented by the corresponding dao patterns.</p><p>At this moment, the silver-horned king stepped into the room and saw Meng Qi reading the few pages of the Golden Book, he said in confusion, “Upon seeing this, you didn’t just laugh and destroy it? Aren’t you afraid of messing up your own path and using the path of others as your path?”</p><p>This was the reason why Yang Jian had only left the first three chapters of the eight-nine arcane art in the hollow jade temple. As for the ‘Primordial beginning Golden Chapter’, it only had a general outline and the nine seals were all based on one’s own exploration and comprehension.</p><p>Meng Qi retracted his divine sense and rubbed the golden book with his right hand, he shook his head and laughed. “If I didn’t dare to face junior brother, I would have ended up being inferior. The core of the original Golden Chapter and the eight-nine arcane art is to contain all things and all kinds of possibilities. If I don’t even dare to look at other people’s Dao and not dare to understand it, how different would it be from having a mental demon?”</p><p>“The stone on the other mountain can attack the jade. As long as I guard my heart and understand my own dao, what’s the harm in learning from him and not like him?”</p><p>After he finished speaking, he really laughed out loud. He put away a few pages of the Golden Book and left Dou Shuai Palace with his head held high. He returned to the real world from the thirty-three heavens and returned to his own training hall.</p><p>The Silver Horn King was in a daze when he heard this. After a long while, he muttered to himself, “There’s a reason for not reading. There’s also an excuse for reading. Who’s right and who’s wrong…”</p><p>Meng Qi’s figure descended and he sat back on the cloud bed in the quiet room. He closed his eyes and the bright red jade text flowed through them one by one.</p><p>If he had not cultivated the origin gold chapter and the eight-nine arcane art, which focused on containing all kinds of possibilities, he would not have been able to see other people’s Dao.</p><p>If he had not condensed the infinite chaotic will into an illusory great dao, he would not have dared to look at the last few chapters of the eight-nine arcane art that Yang Erlang had left in Dou Shuai Palace.</p><p>‘not looking’was a constant principle, but there were exceptions to everything.</p><p>..</p><p>He Mu put away the Li immortal sword and refined it for many days. When he had a rough grasp of it, he began to think about how to go to the demon race’s star field.</p><p>Although this star field was not far away with the return of a powerful divine arts practitioner, it would take him more than half a month to arrive in the mechanical spaceships made by the Black Palace, however, the demon race’s star field was not like the places where the starry sky Buddha Kingdom, the ‘Ancient Heavenly Court’, the Jade Void Starry Sea, the Numinous Treasure Dao ruins, and other factions were entrenched. These factions did not have a life-and-death conflict with the human race, regardless of whether they were friends or enemies with the Great Zhou, low-level communication would not be difficult, while the demon race and the human race were in a state of complete hostility. There were no mechanical spaceships that could get close to that place.</p><p>As for he mu, she had yet to become a human immortal, so she was unable to enter and leave the green nether world and roam the starry sky.</p><p>“It seems that I can only rely on the power of the Li immortal sword…”he mu firmly believed in his master’s guidance. Without much hesitation, he began to make various preparations.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
