Drops of blood rolled on it like Mercury. The surface was flawless and perfect. There was a hint of darkness hidden inside, as if it was reflecting the void, it showed a strong sense of existence that affected the structure of the surrounding heaven and earth. It exuded an extremely ancient and ancient aura.</p><p>Based on what he saw in the Fusang Ancient Tree and his experience in comprehending the supreme heavenly mirror over the years, he was certain that the blood belonged to the Heavenly God. The former ruler of the heavens, the ancient emperor, and his fame had even spread to this era, on the primitive fragment of Earth, which was used as the passage raft, he was still worshipped for a long time.</p><p>The ancient god Jiu Feng, who was a famous warrior under the Heavenly God, collected the drops of his blood that collapsed when he fell and tried to fuse them to breed him. was he trying to resurrect him? Or did he want to use the chicken to lay eggs and rely on external forces to cultivate the illusory dao fruit corresponding to the blood? Then, he would refine and absorb it, taking the crucial step to reach the other shore? Meng Qi’s mind was filled with thoughts as he thought about what the ancient demon god of the past and the current nine-headed Grand Sage wanted to do.</p><p>However, due to the lack of crucial clues, the nine-headed worm had already fallen on the spiritual mountain and was reduced to ashes. There was no proof of its death, so he could not come to a conclusion at the moment.</p><p>If it was the former, then it simply showed the terror of the other side naked: after the destruction of all the worlds in the universe, it had fallen for a whole era, relying on the nine drops of blood that had no spirituality, no vitality, and no ability to be reborn with blood, there was a certain hope to bring it back to life! It was almost impossible to truly die!</p><p>Meng Qi believed that Jiu Feng’s knowledge and strength were enough to judge whether there was a little hope of success in this matter.</p><p>If it was the latter, it would be confirmed that Haotian’s God realm was at least at the level of the ancient ones on the other shore. The small amount of blood without spirituality and vitality still contained some aspects of the Great Dao, which could be combined and complemented, it could breed and grow, and bear the corresponding illusory dao fruit or something of a lower level.</p><p>From this point of view, it was understandable that Haotian’s God and East Emperor’s Tai Yi’s blood had interbred to produce an ancient fusang tree that had the appearance of an “Epoch.”.</p><p>Meng Qi’s thoughts flew as he made endless connections, trying to find a glimmer of inspiration. Suddenly, he remembered something!</p><p>He did as he thought. With a shake of his left hand, he took out the devilish blood peach. It spun around in a daze, as if it had been awakened from its slumber. For a moment, it was still a little confused.</p><p>This item was obtained from the Peach Garden and grew inside the birthday boy’s head. It was called an evil object left behind by the immemorial era by little sang. He wondered how it would react to the blood of the immemorial emperor, the heavenly god?</p><p>It was a piece of divine weapon, a part of Haotian God himself, compared to the fragments of the Supreme Heavenly Mirror!</p><p>After the demonic blood peach spun half a circle, it suddenly stopped. Then, inside the translucent fruit skin, the things that looked like meridians and blood vessels suddenly expanded and protruded weirdly. An ancient, evil, and vast aura suddenly emerged!</p><p>The Heaven and earth in the quiet room suddenly became dark. The illusory river of time appeared on its own. It was as if life was passing quickly and the past was appearing again. Time was chaotic and full of “Anger”!</p><p>“Haotian!”</p><p>An illusory and dignified voice seemed to come from beyond the source of the river of time. The voice was filled with hatred and hatred. It was not intelligent or vivid at all, as if it was an echo carved in the heaven and earth, it penetrated through the era and bore the echo of destruction!</p><p>Meng Qi raised his eyebrows slightly. The Strange Blood Peach’s reaction and the change it attracted were unexpectedly beyond his expectations.</p><p>At this moment, many thoughts were colliding in his mind, and in the end, they converged into a name:</p><p>“East Emperor Taiyi!”</p><p>The other archaic emperor who had fallen at the head of the Heavenly Emperor!</p><p>One of the three archaic emperors who still had a reputation to this day!</p><p>The three archaic emperors were led by the Heavenly Emperor, followed by the East Emperor Taiyi, and finally Emperor Fu, which belonged to the title imitated by the five ancient emperors in this era.</p><p>Meng Qi’s gaze was deep and unfathomable. He looked at the Demonic Blood Peach and saw it jump up shakily. It came to his right hand and circled around the drops of Haotian God’s blood. He gritted his teeth and felt resentful, he was determined to swallow the other party alive, but it seemed that he could only absorb things related to longevity. He could do nothing to the lifeless blood.</p><p>Longevity was a part of the laws of Heaven and earth. Fundamentally speaking, it undoubtedly belonged to a certain aspect of the Great Dao of time. In the ancient mythological era, although the celestial emperor used time to form the dao, which could consume the enemy’s longevity and drive people to old age, it was not unique and exclusive, the longevity of the Peach Garden of immortality still belonged to the mother of the Golden Emperor of the west, and in the primordial era, the first emperor of the East who was famous for the Dao of time was Taiyi!</p><p>The Little Peach was hidden in the head of the birthday boy and was nurtured by his corpse and the Peach Garden of immortality. It could absorb longevity, the thing that liked to extend the life time… had the peculiar and strange secrets of the items left behind from the primordial era… it had such a big reaction when facing the blood of the molt of the Heavenly God, it even attracted the angry roars carved in heaven and earth and the chaos of time..</p><p>With all these things combined, Meng Qi could almost conclude that it had something to do with Emperor Taiyi!</p><p>Spirituality was only the initial stage and belonged to the category of divine weapons and magic treasures… could it be that in the ancient times, other than the nine-headed worm, an ancient demon god, who else had collected the blood of Emperor Taiyi’s molt or something similar in order to take advantage of the catastrophe of the fall of the Heavenly Court, by relying on the birthday star and the Peach Garden of immortality to resurrect the emperor of the east, or by breeding the corresponding illusory dao fruit?</p><p>Illusory dao fruit… Peaches were also considered fruits, and they were afraid of absorbing the Shortcut Dao items and the Great Dao Tree of the nine Netherworlds in the immortal world… Meng Qi’s heart skipped a beat, and he looked up and down at the demonic blood peach that was trampling on the blood of the Heavenly God.</p><p>Could it be that this thing was really an incomplete or incomplete illusory dao fruit?</p><p>The illusory dao fruit corresponding to Donghuang’s Tai Yi?</p><p>For some unknown reason, it actually had some spirituality?</p><p>Amidst all these questions, Meng Qi quietly exhaled and sighed inwardly:</p><p>“It really is the apocalypse. The lingering karma from several eras of the immemorial era can finally be understood here…”</p><p>After carefully studying and caressing the demonic blood peach, Meng Qi, who had yet to gain anything for the time being, put it back in his left hand. His spiritual sense was immersed in a drop of the blood of the Heavenly God. At the same time that he was comprehending and refining the corresponding illusory great dao inside.., he used the cause of all fruits and the great art of Heaven and Earth transformation, which he had improved and sublimated countless times, in an attempt to awaken the memory fragments left behind by Heavenly God from his bloodline.</p><p>It was pitch-black, with only endless destruction and the sealing of time.</p><p>“It seems that I won’t be able to awaken the remaining memories in my bloodline until I touch the level of the past mysteries…”Meng Qi sighed and separated the drop of blood that he was going to refine. Then, he took a drop and pressed it on the acupuncture point on his left hand, he let it infiltrate into his body, and the rest was wrapped up and nurtured with the last green lotus seed of chaos. He wanted to see what would come out in the end.</p><p>In short, it couldn’t be “God of Haotian”who relied on his own divination and the premonition of the cause and effect..</p><p>Who exactly put the devilish blood peach into the Birthday Boy’s head? Meng Qi stopped asking questions and focused on refining the blood. As for his disciple he mu, he could only be considered to have fused with him for now, and refining him into his own would last for a very, very long time.</p><p>..</p><p>He Mu sat in his room and was a little lost for a moment. He did not understand why things had turned out this way.</p><p>How did he return to the Hollow Jade Temple?</p><p>Wasn’t it the great explosion of the nine Phoenix Relic Mansion?</p><p>After a short while, he woke up and looked respectfully at his master Su Meng’s secluded meditation room. He seemed to understand something in his heart. From the isolation to inviting the gods to descend to the mysterious explosion at the core, it was not by chance or coincidence..</p><p>As expected, his master had a plan..</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly heard a probing voice, “Mr. Yueluo? Mr. Yueluo?”</p><p>Jiuli? How did she find this place? He Mu was shocked and found that the voice seemed to come from the ancient blood that had fused with it. He gathered his spiritual sense and sent it through. He answered using the universal knowing talisman, “Miss Jiuli, what’s going on?”</p><p>“You have indeed fused with the blood of the Heavenly God.”Jiuli’s voice revealed a smile.</p><p>He Mu asked in surprise, “The blood of the Heavenly God?”</p><p>“Yes, my mother said that the ancient blood was left behind after the fall of the ancient emperor, the Heavenly God. Some of it was collected by the nine-headed Grand Sage. Because his corresponding Great Dao includes void space, and the blood has an inexplicable connection with each other, we can rely on the blood that has fused with our bodies to communicate at any time, even if we are separated by thousands of worlds,”Jiuli explained happily.</p><p>He Mu came to a sudden realization. She truly understood that the benefits of this opportunity were not small. She could not help but smile and casually said, “So that’s how it is. Are You All Alright?”</p><p>This was another form of the universal sign of knowledge!</p><p>“We have all returned to our own homes. Outsiders do not know about the matter of fusing with the blood. Everything is as usual. What About You?”Jiu Li asked with concern.</p><p>Returning to the hollow jade temple of Kunlun Mountain… he mu naturally wouldn’t answer like this.., after pondering for a moment, he said, “I didn’t come from a family. I was afraid that the little saint of the North Pole and the two demon gods who knew about this would target me and kill me to refine my blood. Thus, I took advantage of the explosion to send me far away to escape into the mortal world and hide in the mortal world. In this way, with the protection of the human emperor, I won’t be afraid of being persecuted by them. I’ll wait until I’ve completely refined my blood and made a great breakthrough in my realm before returning to the star field.”</p><p>Jiu Li nodded. “That’s a good idea. I can guarantee that my mother won’t covet it. I really can’t trust the little saint of the North Pole and the other two demon gods.”</p><p>At this point, she suddenly laughed. “Since you’ve entered the human world, you should give us a good lesson and let us know what a world of flowers is.”</p><p>As they laughed, the man and the demon talked about the customs of the human world.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
