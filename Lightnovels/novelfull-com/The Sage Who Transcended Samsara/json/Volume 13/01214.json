Pieces of crystal swirled around it, reflecting the light, bringing about a beautiful scene that was difficult to be covered by all kinds of colors.</p><p>Between the sky and the Earth, there were many huge icicles that were transparent and shone with dazzling colors. Inside, there were many things sealed. There were Thunder Pool Metal Stones, divine sun stones, and other materials of different grades, it was as if the Void Mountain had accumulated the treasures of the sect for thousands of years.</p><p>Before Meng Qi had the time to examine it carefully, his gaze was already attracted by the ancient ice wall in the depths of this world of ice and snow.</p><p>It stood there, isolating itself from the outside world. Even the sky was divided into two layers. The left and right sides were endless, stretching all the way to the end of the universe. If he wanted to go further, he had to break it. There was no way to go around it!</p><p>Meng Qi extended his divine sense over. His gaze was deep, as if he couldn’t see the deep pool at the bottom. However, the surface could reflect the passing geese and the changing clouds.</p><p>At this moment, the ice wall’s various subtleties couldn’t be hidden under his wise eyes. They were all revealed.</p><p>With a boom, the ancient ice wall faded away, revealing its true appearance. It was an ancient universe with prominent laws. It seemed to connect with the Great Dao, materializing all the Dao, Morality, laws, and principles, it condensed into ice crystals, and these ice crystals formed a wall that would not be hurried for all eternity.</p><p>The visitor stopped. This path was impassable!</p><p>Was this the second test? A glass lamp appeared in Meng Qi’s eyes, illuminating the illusory and mysterious world of karma. Each star line was resplendent, connecting to the ancient ice wall and absorbing all the details.</p><p>“This highly crystallized universe of ‘principles’repels all living things…”</p><p>“Its essence is close to the real world. Its rank is similar to the universe that was sublimated by the Brahma of creation. It is not something that can be broken by legends…”</p><p>“Borrowing the immortal slaying formation map and combining it with the four exterminating slayer swords and using the one Qi to transform into three pure ones, it might be possible to forcefully end this universe in a short period of time, but it is obviously not enough…”</p><p>“The inclusion and dispelling of the ‘limitless seal’can also have an effect, but it is not something that can be done in a short period of time. I am afraid that it will take a long time before a passage can be created. However, the current situation in the real world is turbulent, and changes may occur at any time…”</p><p>“I can try the heaven opening seal and the saber technique I created. Even Heaven and Earth can be opened up, let alone repelling it. However, I still feel that it won’t be so simple..</p><p>“Cause and effect have their own cycle. It has no important connection with this side. Unless the cause of all the effects is perfect, it will be difficult to erase it from cause and effect…”</p><p>Many thoughts flashed through Meng Qi’s mind, allowing him to have a clear grasp of the current situation and the methods he could use.</p><p>After a pause, his bamboo crown moved slightly, and a chaotic Qing cloud flew out. In the darkness, an extremely ancient and powerful shadow flag was clustered around it.</p><p>As the flag fluttered, the surroundings sank into nothingness, as if it could not withstand its aura.</p><p>The absolute blade was raised, and purple lightning leaped, fusing into the shadow of the flag. Then, with a flash of light, the world between Meng Qi and the Eternal Ice Wall was split into two. Other than time still flowing, the Great Dao was hidden in the formless, everything else was separated from it.</p><p>Rip!</p><p>A strange sound shook. The ice wall was reflected with brilliant purple, and it was stained with chaos. The ice crystals shattered one by one, and an obvious crack appeared.</p><p>However, as the crack extended forward, the blade light slashed to the other side, forming a passage. The dao, virtue, law, and principle of the ice wall universe wriggled on their own like living beings. Their speed was faster than Meng Qi’s reaction, in a flash, the repair was completed. The blade light “Followed”the entire way, not missing a single centimeter!</p><p>The blade light moved forward, isolated from the outside world. It was no longer able to draw power from the universe and began to weaken. It became more and more difficult to open up the path ahead, while the repair at the back became easier and easier.</p><p>After a few breaths, the blade light dimmed and disappeared. The remaining crack in the depths was instantly restored to its original state, and the other side of the ice wall seemed to be far away.</p><p>This made Meng Qi give up on the idea of being one with the absolute blade and merging with the blade light. Regardless of the path of retreat, he had to bravely go forward. Even if he wanted to do it, he had to find out how “Thick”the ice wall was and how powerful the isolation was, in order to measure whether he could hold on until the end.</p><p>“What does the founder of Zhixu Mountain want to test?”After failing his attempt, Meng Qi thought about the purpose of this test.</p><p>The first test was to test the disciples’mastery and calculation of innate techniques. What was the second test?</p><p>He looked away and looked at the most eye-catching icicles. He found that they were filled with all kinds of materials, from ordinary iron blocks to thunder pool metal stones that could be used to refine sharp weapons, then to heavenly materials and earthly treasures, and the main materials of divine weapons.</p><p>“Could it really be the treasure house of the Zhi Xu Mountain? Then why was it placed before the second Test?”Meng Qi thought quickly and couldn’t help but frown.</p><p>“No, it can’t be considered a complete treasure house. It’s all materials, materials for refining weapons.”</p><p>“Could it be that the second test is to refine something to help break the ice wall?”</p><p>“It might not necessarily be broken, but it can be passed. Yes, passed…”</p><p>Thinking of this, Meng Qi suddenly had a flash of inspiration and compared it to something that Yue Ziqing had described previously.</p><p>The body-reporting yellow-scarved strongman!</p><p>“After studying the rules clearly and deducing the details of the Great Dao, one can directly create a device with a high synchronization rate. It can be a yellow-scarved strongman, or it can be a divine spark, an ancient lamp, or a book.”</p><p>Couldn’t the current predicament be solved by relying on this matter?</p><p>By studying the moral principles and various rules that had already appeared in the Ice Crystal Universe and deducing the corresponding details of the Great Dao, I could create a device with high synchronization rate with some of its rules. At that time, this device would be able to replace that part of the rules, it would become a part of the Ice Crystal Universe!</p><p>And it had my brand and was under my control. It would use me as a bridge to cross the ice wall and help me deceive the world!</p><p>So it was to test the disciples’abilities in this aspect… Meng Qi suddenly understood, but he began to grumble in his heart. The materials he had seen so far didn’t seem to be able to support the type of self-sacrificing strength warriors or godheads that had the same synchronization rate.</p><p>After reaching the main materials of divine weapons, there was no clear division of higher-level materials, most of them were legendary molt, destiny molt, cross-shore molt, inborn items that didn’t have sentience, the power of all beings that increased or mutated, and the materialization of principles and rules such as the Peach Garden of immortality. There were all kinds of them, they were rare and could often be encountered but not sought.</p><p>Meng Qi’s spiritual sense spread out and covered the entire world of ice and snow. He quickly found what he had guessed from the icicles.</p><p>These were two molt with majestic but deep auras. The grotto-heaven in their bodies was perfected and formed the universe. They could reflect the outside world and were in a slow and desolate state. They were the corpses of legendary mighty figures, and judging from their clothing.., they were clearly the elders of the void end mountain from countless generations ago!</p><p>“Based on the culture of the Void End Mountain, it is perfectly normal for elders to donate their corpses before passing away to be used as materials for research…”Meng Qi saw that each of the two remains was incomplete, he could not help but sigh.</p><p>He would respect the good things that he could not do.</p><p>Now that he had all the materials, what should he make? How should he make it? Would he be able to finish it in a short time?</p><p>..</p><p>Outside the ancient bronze door, the blank expression returned to normal. The white-robed middle-aged scholar sighed. It was unknown what he was sighing about. Then, he looked around, his voice spread in all directions. “The second test isn’t something that can be done in a day. Everyone, go back. Don’t delay your normal cultivation and research. Just stay here and wait.”</p><p>Whether it was creating body-sacrificing strongmen, divine spark, ancient lamp, or other items, with the ability that they had immersed themselves in for many years and were close to the level of the creation realm, with sufficient materials, they would still need several hours to barely refine one, moreover, it could not be used for a long time and was only limited to those that passed the test. Even the other legendary elders might not be able to grasp this dao.</p><p>As for Su Meng, even if he was able to succeed in the end, he would have to spend several months and years studying it. Everyone did nothing but wait and watch. It was simply a waste of their lives!</p><p>At this moment, the black-robed old woman said in a hoarse voice, “Su Meng has a wide circle of friends. How do you know that he doesn’t have any friends who are good at this Dao?”</p><p>Perhaps he would be able to refine it in a few hours!</p><p>Thinking of what had happened just now and the first round of outside requests for help, everyone on Mount Zhixu fell silent. It took the middle-aged scholar a long time before he said, “No one else is good at this dao, right…”</p><p>This was something unique to Mount Zhixu!</p><p>“That’s true.”The black-robed old woman was quite confident in this point. She waved her hand and said, “Everyone, return to your respective places. Zi Qing, stay behind.”</p><p>In just a few breaths’time, the figures in the valley disappeared.</p><p>..</p><p>Meng Qi meditated on the ground, thinking about what to create, how to create it, and how long it would take to complete it:</p><p>“Whether it’s a body-reporting yellow-scarved strongman or a divine personality, I’ve never set foot in any of them. I only have the general direction that Yue Ziqing told me..</p><p>“However, I’m good at comprehending moral principles and grasping the rules. With the help of the causes and effects, it’s not difficult to figure out the details of the ice wall universe in a short period of time. The difficulty lies in how to reverse deduce the appearance of the Great Dao so as to increase the synchronization rate..</p><p>“Therefore, there are two difficulties. One is the deduction, and the other is the practice of creating things…”</p><p>“Body-reporting yellow-scarved strongman, divine personality, divine personality…”just as Meng Qi had a vague idea, the absolute blade in his sleeve suddenly moved, flashing with purple lightning, revealing his existence!</p><p>What did the absolute blade mean? Meng Qi was stunned at first, but then he understood.</p><p>The ancient lightning pool was the incarnation of a certain part of the Great Dao. The Nine Heavens Thunder God was an innate god that controlled the power of heaven and earth and punished on behalf of the heavens. They all had something similar to the retribution of the body. In a vulgar analogy, they all had their own “Divine personality”, however, they were not limited to this. There would not be anything that would fall immediately if they went against it.</p><p>Wasn’t the absolute blade made from the ancient lightning pool and the Thunder God’s remains the best reference for creating the divine personality by reversing the appearance of the Great Dao?</p><p>No wonder it wants to stand out proudly!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
