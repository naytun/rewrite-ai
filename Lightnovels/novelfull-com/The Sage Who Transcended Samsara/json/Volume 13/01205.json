If viewed from the outside world, it was almost impossible to cover its boundaries and understand the overall situation. However, to Meng Qi, who lived at an infinite height, it was like a strange point that was constantly overlapping. It was all in his eyes, at this moment, this impenetrable universe was shrouded in a layer of hazy mist. It was clearly different from other places, preventing Meng Qi’s divine sense from probing in.</p><p>The strange situation attracted Meng Qi’s attention. His spiritual sense took form and transformed into a transparent, ancient glass lamp. It emitted black and white light, drawing in all the karma threads around it. It continued to gather and separate at the wick of the lamp, it flickered with flames.</p><p>After proving the legend, the hollow jade divine calculation was closely related to the “Karma of all the fruits.”The two were almost one. Meng Qi’s divination ability directly went up a few steps, far surpassing the current Wang Siyuan. Among the almighties.., he was also outstanding.</p><p>The Flames flickered rapidly, getting faster and fiercer, giving people a feeling that they were about to derail and explode. Just as everything reached its peak, everything calmed down. Meng Qi’s voice came from the ancient glass lamp:</p><p>“So that’s how it is…”</p><p>He was actually not unfamiliar with such a universe. In the Real Hollow Jade Temple, he had entered one through the ancient well. There, he had defeated the independent original “Incarnation”– the world creation Brahma, he obtained the corresponding projection of “He”and “I”.</p><p>A similar universe had been completely dominated by an ancient othershore and had absolute control over it. Hence, its essence had improved and it was close to the real world, inside, one could not rely on the aura of the real world to permanently change the laws of Heaven and earth. One could only temporarily control it.</p><p>But now, it seemed that such a universe was permeated by the aura of the othershore. Normally, one could not project into it and could only use a special path, such as the thirty-six ancient wells outside the hollow jade temple, they led to a similar universe where the ‘primordial beginning projection’had the absolute advantage. One could imagine that in the western paradise, in the Yu Yu Tian Green Touring Palace, in the residence of the heavenly monarch of morals, and in the perfected Bodhi Pure Land.., there was probably a similar path in a certain place in the intact spirit mountain in the past.</p><p>“Which other shore is this universe in front of me?”Meng Qi thought in puzzlement.</p><p>No matter how much his deductive ability improved, the details regarding the othershore were still vague. Only the othershore could resist the othershore.</p><p>After being unable to determine its identity, Meng Qi thought of something else:</p><p>From the fact that many legends could still be considered complete, the number of similar universes should be limited. Compared to the nearly infinite universe as a whole, it was far from reaching the standard of qualitative change. Even if one could not enter or project.., the inability to create a “He-i Mark”did not affect the final breakthrough to perfection. One could naturally project as new universes or cosmic light fragments were born.</p><p>Since there was a limited number, it was not randomly selected. What was the mystery behind it?</p><p>And what benefits could controlling such a universe bring to ancient beings like the primordial lord of Heaven and Amitabha?</p><p>Meng Qi was full of doubts. He really wanted to interrupt gu Xiaosang’s seclusion and ask her about it, but in the end, he only thought about it and didn’t do anything.</p><p>This was obviously a fight between the other universes, and only the ancient beings were qualified to do so. He was still far away, so he wasn’t in a hurry.</p><p>After taking a deep look at this universe, Meng Qi’s spiritual sense turned into a stream of light and continued to project to other universes, trying his best to increase the number of projections.</p><p>..</p><p>Somewhere in the Great Zhou, a few secluded buildings stood tall, forming a courtyard. It faced a flat lake, and the flowers bloomed brilliantly.</p><p>This place was filled with a feeling of emptiness and desolation. Clearly, the owner of this place did not come here often. The few servants who stayed behind were relatively large in size. They were like mosquitoes and flies in a ruined temple, unable to support life.</p><p>In one of the rooms in the small building, streaks of lightning suddenly lit up. Silver snakes danced in the air, and Purple Dragons turned the sky upside down, illuminating the entire room.</p><p>Within the Lightning, five figures gradually appeared. Some of them wore long robes and hoods, while others wore close-fitting armor. Each of them wore a unique set of clothes, making them seem like outsiders.</p><p>“This world belongs to the nightmare realm. We must not be careless with our missions.”The leader was a man with a strange tattoo on his head.</p><p>Beside him, a beautiful woman with a longbow on her back and pointy ears said through gritted teeth, “Six paths is really despicable. This time, we actually couldn’t investigate the mission ahead of time, so we couldn’t make any preparations.”</p><p>“You should know that I came to a nightmare-level world, so I directly paid a meritorious service to cancel this mission. But now that I’m here, I’ll take a look first. Although a nightmare-level world is dangerous, there will definitely be many opportunities. Perhaps this trip will allow our team to completely improve.”The Man with a tattoo on his head looked at the delicate girl beside him, “Jinghua, you usually focus on gathering intelligence when dealing with other teams. Do you have any information about this nightmare world?”</p><p>Yu Jinghua pushed up the small glasses on the bridge of his nose, and his eyes flashed with a computer-like glow:</p><p>“Yes, the people of this nightmare world call this place the real world. It has a level of power that is obviously higher than the other reincarnated worlds, and its civilization is advanced. It is not inferior to the technological world that we have experienced.”</p><p>“There are a few important figures at the peak of the Nightmare World: The Immortal Emperor Yuan of the Hollow Jade Temple of the Kunlun Mountains, Su Meng, the reincarnated Maitreya of the Buddhist kingdom on Earth, the ancient great sage Bull Demon King… It is said that they have all surpassed the normal level of gods and demons. They are almost omnipotent compared to us. Simply put, they can be compared to the gods of creation of the reincarnation world that we have experienced before. However, those gods of creation are legends and may not be true. And these important figures are still in the world. Therefore, we must not provoke them or even go near them. Otherwise, we may be seen as reincarnators.”</p><p>“Ever since the six paths changed their mode and released many restrictions, be it martial arts, Immortal Arts, or magical technology, they can all be exchanged for them. After dividing the world levels, there aren’t many teams that have entered the nightmare realm, and the failure rate is extremely high. A lot of news is spread from the two mysterious organizations, ‘Miracle’and ‘myth’. I suspect that a large portion of them came from the Nightmare Realm!”</p><p>..</p><p>Hearing Yu Jinghua’s explanation, the team members looked at each other in dismay. They were fortunate enough to witness the power of the mythical-level once. It was a terrifying power that could completely crush them, and the big bosses in the nightmare world were all far beyond the mythical-level!</p><p>They must not be involved in this mission, or they would definitely die!</p><p>“Don’t worry, it’s not a death mission. However, there will always be three, six, and nine levels in a world. Different teams have different levels of strength,”said the leader, Mao Jin.</p><p>At this moment, the candles in front of them suddenly lit up, reflecting a line of words on the wall. It was the mission this time.</p><p>“The first main mission is to head to changle, the capital of the Great Zhou Kingdom. Find a way to sneak into the Prince Jin’s residence and lie low for at least half a year…”Mao Jin murmured. Then, he turned to look at Yu Jinghua. “Do you have information on Changle and the Prince Jin’s residence?”</p><p>Yu Jinghua nodded. “Yes, but very little. The Great Zhou Kingdom is the dynasty that governs the core of the nightmare world. The emperor is known as the current human emperor. He wields the human emperor sword, which has the word ‘lack’written on the first page of the Divine Weapon Exchange Book. It is said that he has the strength of a top-tier deity or demon. and behind this dynasty stands the great figure, the immortal emperor of the Hollow Jade Temple. King Jin, Zhao Heng, is the successor, and his strength is close to that of a deity or demon. Of course, there is a time limit to the information, and there might be some changes.”</p><p>Mao Jin nodded. “There’s still plenty of time. Don’t be in a hurry to go to changle. Go to the nearby cities and towns to gather information. We must be extremely careful in the nightmare world.”</p><p>He was not good at gathering information, so he chose to stay in the middle and concentrate on his cultivation.</p><p>Four hours later, he saw one of his male teammates return in a daze.</p><p>“Old Zhu, what happened?”Mao Jin’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p>Zhu Tianming looked at his captain with a blank expression. “I found many people on the street who practice the same martial arts. It is said that they are all at the deity-level, and there is a way to get them at a very cheap price.”</p><p>“How Cheap?”Mao Jin asked with a bright light in his eyes.</p><p>Deity-level martial arts were worth a lot of good deeds. If they could get them at a cheap price, not only would they make a lot of money, but they would also obviously improve the strength of the team.</p><p>He thought that the bargain was a bargain relative to his own value.</p><p>Zhu Tianming said like a wandering soul, “It’s very cheap. No, it’s not more expensive than a bowl of noodles.”</p><p>“What?”Mao Jin almost jumped up.</p><p>Was the nightmare world so terrifying? Deity-level martial arts were so common!</p><p>Zhu Tianming wanted to cry but no tears came out. “Really, I want to buy a few books, but… but six paths warned me not to buy and cultivate them!”</p><p>Mao Jin was stunned for a moment, then he suddenly sighed:</p><p>“Six paths is as despicable and shameless as ever!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
