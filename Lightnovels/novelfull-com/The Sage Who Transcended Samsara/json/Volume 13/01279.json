He Mu recalled everything he knew and realized that he had never heard of such a grand sage. It seemed that he had been dead for a long time and had no influence on the current world. His master did not mention it when he taught him, no one discussed it in the world of universal knowledge.</p><p>Seeing that he was stunned, Ao Qin, who was standing beside jiu li, grunted, “Ignorant…”</p><p>Jiu Li turned her head slightly and looked at Ao Qin, stopping him from continuing, then, she turned her head and smiled, “The nine-headed Grand Sage is not as famous as the Monkey Grand Sage, the Ping Tian Grand Sage, the ocean-toppling Grand Sage and the others. He is a senior known to all demons and demons. He was not born in the Western world. Very few people still remember him. Later on, he died on Mount Lingshan.”</p><p>“No wonder I have never heard of him.”He Mu pretended to be half-true as if he had just realized something.</p><p>Jiu Li’s expression became serious as she said, “However, among all the grand sages at that time, he was one of the most powerful ones. He was one of the few top-notch saints who lived for at least one era.”</p><p>“Lived for at least one era?”He Mu expressed his shock in his heart. Beside him, Ao Qin, Gu Yue, and the golden scale fairy revealed looks of disdain or contempt.</p><p>Jiu Li nodded and said, “During the primordial era, the nine-headed Grand Sage dominated the world, but at that time, his name was ‘Jiu Feng’!”</p><p>I’ve never heard of Jiu Feng either… He Mu did not hide his ignorance.</p><p>It was normal that he did not know about the primordial era, but it would be strange if he did!</p><p>Even someone as powerful as his master, who had immense powers and was the leader of a top force, did not know much about the secret of the primordial era!</p><p>“Jiu Feng, an innate demon god with nine heads and nine faces, Bird Head and human body. He first followed Donghuang Taiyi before he became a subordinate of the Heavenly Emperor and eventually became a great sage. He was a famous general in the Primordial Heaven Court at that time.” Jiu Li’s expression was solemn.</p><p>As a great sage of the demon race, he actually followed Donghuang Taiyi and the Heavenly Emperor respectively. Did the demon Emperor and the demon Saint Not Care? Or did they support the Donghuang Taiyi in the beginning and then acknowledge the Haotian God? He Mu thought about this in the light of his own understanding of the other shore personages.</p><p>Most of his knowledge in this area came from his understanding of the world. This was because his master never took the initiative to mention the other shore personages. He would only give a slight answer unless he asked himself.</p><p>Jiuli continued, “After the fall of the Heavenly Emperor, the last era of the primordial age was destroyed. At that time, Jiu Feng was protected by the Demon Emperor and lived until the antiquity age of this era. From then on, he changed his name and called himself the nine-headed worm. Later on, he had a dispute with the Monkey Grand Sage over a Buddhist relic and was heavily injured by him. Haha, it’s a coincidence. He was bitten off by your heavenly dog tribe’s Xiao Tianxiao Sage. When he recovered from his injuries, he followed the demon Saintess up the Spirit Mountain and died together with the Ten Thousand Buddhas.”</p><p>Xiao Tian Quan came from the heavenly dog clan, but he followed true Lord Clear Source Mystic Dao and entered the hollow jade temple.</p><p>‘to think that there’s such a connection. If the nine-headed worm still has a lingering obsession and smells the pure aura of senior brother Xiao Tian on me, I’m afraid that it will seek revenge…’He Mu’s thoughts wandered, he replied casually, “So that’s how it is. Do you suspect that the ancient manor belongs to the nine-headed great Sage who died on the Spirit Mountain?”</p><p>Jiu Li nodded slightly, “After the nine-headed Grand Sage was defeated at the Jade Pool, he never returned to that place. He did not even visit his descendants. It is obvious that there is another abode. That ancient abode has some features of the primordial age. It gives off a desolate aura and there are various carvings of the nine-headed bird’s body. It fits all the clues.”</p><p>“He must have been mistakenly brought into the starry sky by the Little Sage at the end of the primordial age. He did not discover it until the erosion of time revealed its original appearance. Unfortunately, no one noticed it. It floated in the darkness of the universe. Because of the apocalyptic aura, the stars fell like rain and only then did it return from the depths of the universe.”</p><p>It was obvious that the person who had brought this cave abode into the starry skies was not a great saint. Otherwise, he would have discovered it at that moment.</p><p>“This is the great saint’s relic abode. How could you not tell your elders?”After he mu heard this, he was a little flabbergasted. He directly expressed the shock and bewilderment in his heart.</p><p>In his opinion, he did not need to try out such an important matter to temper himself. He should quickly report it to his elders and mobilize his strongest force to take the precious items of the relic abode into his hands as soon as possible. This was a normal and reasonable course of Action!</p><p>Gu Yue coldly glanced at he mu and spat out two words, “Ignorant.”</p><p>Ao Qin also nodded in agreement. Only the golden scale fairy pursed her lips and smiled, “Mr. Yue Luo, you are not the descendant or disciple of an illustrious figure. Some things are not as simple as they seem.”</p><p>Jiu Li added, “Whether it’s my mother, the radiant saint, Ao Qin’s elder, the Arctic saint, the withered bone fire god, or the dragonfish emperor, they are all more or less under the attention of experts of the same level. After all, our demon race is the collective name of many races, and we have never been united internally. Therefore, if my mother and the others act rashly and come to the legacy mansion without completely concealing the secrets of the heavens, one can only imagine what kind of situation it will turn into. It would already be considered good if we could obtain 10% of the harvest.”</p><p>If the rest of the demon race’s experts were to come over, in order to avoid a fierce internal conflict, it would most likely be a great sage who would take the first prize and then split up the remaining items… he mu suddenly understood and said, “That’s why I asked you all to come out and deceive the world?”</p><p>The number of demons who did not form their true bodies could be described as the sand count of the Ganges. No matter how noble Jiu Li’s identity was, she would not attract much attention when she went out to play. Under such circumstances, she would quietly open her cave abode and take the treasures without anyone noticing.</p><p>There was no doubt that the small radiant saint and the others must have some Heaven’s secrets to hide so that they would not be discovered.</p><p>Could it be that master was referring to this matter when he said that he was fated to be in the demon race’s star field?</p><p>He had calculated the Heaven’s secrets and knew that the nine-headed worm relic abode was about to return. Under the situation where he was the focus of attention from all over the universe and his every move had countless people paying attention to him, he had sent his disciple, who had not even reached the level of a dharma body, out to travel and participate in the grand event?</p><p>En, a great grandmaster like him was not worth a single cent in the eyes of a powerful divine arts practitioner who was above the level of immortals. It would be a waste of time to even look at him..</p><p>He Mu seemed to be deep in thought as he thought about his master’s instructions. Jiu Li’s expression was solemn as he answered his question, “That’s right.”</p><p>“But, but, we have not even reached the level of forming a true body, and that is the great sage remains mansion. Aren’t we overestimating ourselves?”He Mu asked again.</p><p>The restrictions that were casually set up could cause the living beings on the ship to die thousands of times!</p><p>He liked to use sword techniques to tell stories. He was used to thinking before acting.</p><p>The golden-scaled fairy chuckled, “Are we like those fellows who don’t know the immensity of Heaven and earth? We are far away from the foundation and floating in the depths of the universe. The original owner has already fallen for eons. Under the erosion of time, how much of the strongest setup can remain?”</p><p>“The few fellow Daoists who bumped into that relic mansion have already confirmed that the remaining restrictions are probably around the demon king level. We each have treasures and cooperate with each other. Why would we be afraid of any accidents?”Jiuli added.</p><p>Ao Qin, who was next to her, once again expressed his displeasure. “So, there’s no need to invite this ignorant and ignorant person.”</p><p>Jiuli’s expression sank slightly, he said in a dignified manner, “This is the most important thing we’ve ever been in charge of. If we fail, how will we be able to return home?”? Yue Luo had relied on himself to obtain the divine weapon. He had virtue and luck, which could greatly increase our chances of success. Most importantly, he did not involve the little saints and Grand Sages. He had no background. Wasn’t he the best partner</p><p>Did he have to say these words in person? He Mu’s mouth twitched slightly. This was too much of a blow.</p><p>Furthermore, his divine weapon was given by his master. It had nothing to do with virtue and luck. He felt rather guilty..</p><p>Thinking of this, he said straightforwardly, “My friends, I don’t have any background and I’m not very strong. If I get involved in this matter, aren’t you afraid that you’ll burn the bridge after crossing the river? Or that I’ll be treated as a death scout?”</p><p>Jiu Li smiled slightly and said, “You can rest assured about this because I’m the daughter of the small radiant saint and a descendant of the Phoenix clan. I have the pure five virtues bloodline, so I will never do anything that will harm myself.”</p><p>Judging from Master’s previous description, this was quite convincing… he mu pondered for a moment and finally nodded:</p><p>“Okay, I believe in you.”</p><p>A promise from a Phoenix was priceless.</p><p>When she heard he mu finally agree, Jiu Li smiled sweetly. She revealed a girlish expression that was as bright as the sun and moon.</p><p>He Mu collected his thoughts and thought for a moment, “For the sake of seriousness, why don’t we make an oath?”</p><p>“Absolutely not!”Jiu Li and Ao Qin stopped him at the same time.</p><p>Seeing that he mu was at a loss.., jiu Li quickly explained, “In the human world, the person from the Jade Void Palace of Mount Kunlun has already formed a destiny. The way of Karma is unrivaled in the world, and he has some mystical powers. If we swear an oath, he will sense it on the spot and reveal the secret of the nine-headed great sage Relic Manor.”</p><p>Was he talking about my master? He Mu muttered, feeling an inexplicable sense of honor.</p><p>At this moment, Jiu Li hesitated and said, “If you are still worried, I roughly know the contents of the Demon Emperor Talisman. As long as I keep it in my heart, I will first make a detour from him to conceal the key contents.”</p><p>He Mu was stunned for a moment and said resolutely,</p><p>“No need! I believe you!”</p><p>Jiu Li was stunned for a moment and then a little embarrassed. He looked around and said, “If that’s the case, then we will immediately head to the remains of the nine-headed Grand Sage.”</p><p>The ship started, flying in the starry sky.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
