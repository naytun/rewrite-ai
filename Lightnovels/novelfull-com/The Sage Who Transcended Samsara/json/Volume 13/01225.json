They shone with the colors of equality and freedom, and the demon saints who had recovered quite a bit of strength surrounded him. Under the control of the incarnation of the “Great unfettered son of Heaven”.., they formed the formation that attacked the heavens in the past, and it transformed into a deep and dark fog that enveloped the malevolent and evil demon Emperor’s claw.</p><p>In order to wear down the imprint in the god Ascension Board and to prevent the isolation of the “Splendid landscape painting”from affecting the outcome, Qi Zhengyan took the risk to awaken the Devil Emperor’s claw. As a result, he was in an extremely dangerous situation, the difference in strength and level made it difficult for him to suppress the Devil Emperor’s claw. He could be contaminated at any time, going completely astray and becoming a devil. Hence, he had to rely on the power of the “Great Boundless Heaven”and the Devil Saints to balance the situation.</p><p>This was a dangerous path, but Qi Zhengzheng made the decision without hesitation.</p><p>This life’s ideal was more important than his life, and he would not regret it even if he died!</p><p>The black fog that was enveloped by Zhao Heng’s hands became increasingly evil and filthy. It quickly seeped into the “God Ascension Board”and stirred up a scarlet golden glow, staining them into ink. It seemed that in a few moments, it would be able to usurp the host, he would gain control of this peerless treasure.</p><p>In the face of this, Han Guang revealed a trace of a smile and thought to himself,</p><p>“So that’s how it is…”</p><p>Back then, with the cover of the “Son of Heaven”, the demon emperor’s claws, and the friendship of sharing life and death in the world of reincarnation, Han Guang and Lu Ya had never doubted the purpose of Zhao Heng’s visit to the south barren and Lang Ya, after all, when making an important decision about the future and life and death, it was common to see old friends and reminisce about the past.</p><p>However, how could one not be wary of the changes in key matters when planning for a major event?</p><p>Although Lu Ya and Lu Heng did not expect Zhao Heng to collude with Qi Zhengyan and intended to completely disrupt the situation, they had been on guard against him from the very beginning, taking the ‘God Ascension Roll’and betraying them. They still stood on the high side!</p><p>This possibility was not small, and they had to be on guard. If they miscalculated, they would not be able to get away with it!</p><p>Therefore, even if they did not sign a contract, Su Meng and the other opponents, who were afraid of the “Cause of all fruits”, would be aware of it in advance, they had prepared a corresponding backup plan. If Zhao Heng played along and used the “God Ascension Roll”to please the public.., they would definitely experience what it meant to be in despair.</p><p>The so-called backup plan was very simple. Zhao Heng, who had once entered reincarnation, whether it was his real name, his birth date, or even all the details, were all within Lu Ya’s grasp. When su Meng’s “Cause of all fruits”had no time to care about other things.., it was simply impossible to escape the curse. He had a “Zhao Heng grass figurine”that Lu Ya had personally made in his arms. It was made from a copy of the nail head seven arrow book. If he could not deal with the legends, how could he kill someone who had just entered the spell body stage?</p><p>Now that Zhao Heng had chosen the third path, this backup plan could still come in handy. However, there seemed to be no need for that. As long as the ascension to godhood on behalf of the heavens was not as smooth as he had expected, it would be difficult to bestow the title of Star Lord, he had to open the highest level of the ninth heaven and Peek into some secrets in order to be able to do his best. With Qi Zhengyan and Zhao Heng’s strength, even if they had the devil emperor’s claw, even if they had the help of the great unfettered emperor and the Devil Saints, when the matter was settled.., it would be a piece of cake to snatch back the god Ascension Roll from their hands.</p><p>He would just leave it with them for the time being and let the god Ascension Roll and the Heaven Ascension platform merge into one first. That would be the proper thing to do!</p><p>The thought flashed through Han Guang’s mind in a split second. He seemed to have a plan in mind as he leisurely held a formation diagram in his hand. It was divided into four colors, red, green, black, and white. It contained the terror of the great slaughter, the great destruction, and the great end.</p><p>He threw the immortal execution formation diagram into the air and immediately connected the four immortal swords of the exterminating slayer. However, this time, he did not want to form a complete sword formation. Instead, he wanted to drag them up to an infinite height!</p><p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p><p>The four immortal swords immediately trembled. The power that Guang Chengzi and the others released almost could not hold on any longer, almost causing the four immortal execution swords to escape from their control. This brought about a temporary delay and chaos in the four-colored sword Qi of red, green, black, and white, immediately, the great wisdom sword was flicked away by the Light Golden Buddha palm of the ancient Buddha with a flick of his finger. The Heaven flipping seal was sent flying, and he forcefully broke out of the encirclement.</p><p>The five fingers of the ancient Buddha of burning lamp, which were far more powerful than the mountain peaks, changed continuously. In an instant, they formed countless hand seals, forming an endless sea of pain. They set off terrifying waves, and with an illusory momentum, they pierced through the “Splendid Mountain and river painting”.</p><p>The ancient Buddha of burning lamp gave up on stopping Gao Lan to prove his own legend and chose to attack the Green Emperor!</p><p>If a person from the other side appeared, things would be troublesome!</p><p>The “Splendid Mountain and river painting”did not stop the ocean of pain because it was a part of the secular world and humanity. Similarly, Zhao Heng was not affected, because he was always in the “Sea of pain”, no matter how he changed, it would not affect his state.</p><p>But Emperor Qing was different. He was looking back to the past and taking possession of the future. He formed a line in the river of time to break free from the Sea of pain and reach the other side. At this moment, with the change of the “Sea of pain”and the surging of crazy waves.., he could only slow down his “Footsteps.”While he used the power of the “Monster of Heavenly Dao”in front of him to resist the “Nail head seven arrow book,”he opened his clay ball and rushed out of the auspicious clouds. On the clouds stood an ancient green tree that looked like Fusang, the roots spread and plunged into the sea of bitterness, making it calm down.</p><p>Whether it was the heavenly venerate Taiyi who saved suffering or the eastern medicine master Wang Fo, they were now the basis for the green emperor to look back to the past. It was difficult for him to jump to the present and defend against the attack of the ancient Buddha.</p><p>The waves of the sea of suffering were no longer fierce, but they had not subsided either. In the Endless Sea of pain, an ancient glass lamp suddenly appeared. It was suffused with all kinds of colors of cause and effect, and the light of the lamp illuminated the vast sea of suffering, it wanted to pave a way for all living beings to transcend.</p><p>The halo of the glass lamp transformed into a golden Buddha full of wisdom. The light of Buddha in his mind was complete, and he uttered a solemn voice,</p><p>“The sea of bitterness is boundless, turn back to the shore!”</p><p>The fourth form of the Tathagata divine palm, turn back to the shore!</p><p>The Buddha light condensed and merged into the sea of bitterness, like an invisible hand pulling Emperor Qing to turn back!</p><p>At this moment, the Golden Bridge in the Changle Palace suddenly grew long. Surrounded by the human light, it passed through the “Splendid landscape map”and came to the side of Emperor Qing.</p><p>The Golden Bridge was elevated. On one side was the depths of the sea of bitterness, and on the other side was the illusory shore. The Green Emperor was on top of it, and he was impervious to waves and pain. It seemed that as long as he walked forward, he would be able to reach it smoothly.</p><p>This was the Golden Bridge on the other side!</p><p>The Green Emperor stepped forward. He wanted to return to the current node, connect with the past, and connect with the future!</p><p>At this moment, the great beauty bodhisattva outside the sword washing pavilion suddenly put his palms together and solemnly chanted the name of Buddha:</p><p>“Amitabha of the South!”</p><p>In the real world, all those who were related to Buddhism were moved and chanted the name of Buddha:</p><p>“Amitabha of the South!”</p><p>The name of Buddha echoed in the world. In the river of time, Medicine Master King Buddha, who was sitting upright in the Middle Ages, seemed to see the shadow of a giant Golden Buddha. His lips were moving as he chanted Buddhist scriptures.</p><p>As the saying goes, success leads to failure. As the world was like this, medicine master king Buddha’s azure-blue glazed body gradually dimmed as if he was following the principles of the world. It caused the river of time to vibrate and ripple as if it was about to break.</p><p>The higan golden bridge extended once again, stepping into the past and arriving in front of Medicine Guru Buddha, isolating the illusory Buddha’s voice from the outside.</p><p>At this moment, the life and Death Bodhi behind medicine Guru Buddha suddenly changed. The withered ones decayed, the glorious ones withered. Everything sank into the final tranquility, the final nirvana!</p><p>The higan golden bridge was no longer able to isolate all the influences. Medicine Guru Buddha formed a seal with both hands and used all his strength to resist the remaining attacks.</p><p>The river of time Rose and fell, rippling from medicine master Wang Fo and surging towards the present and the past respectively, making everything no longer calm.</p><p>Emperor Qing walked back to the current node. He wanted to connect all the dots and all the short lines in the river of time into a long line, a long line with all the branches in the future.</p><p>However, the tremors in medicine master Wang Fo’s place made him like a snake that had its seven inches pinched. He couldn’t get rid of it no matter how hard he tried, and he couldn’t connect them as one!</p><p>The dark red eyes in front of him gradually faded, and his face showed a bit of pain. If he was delayed any longer, he would lose the chance he had and pay a heavy price.</p><p>In the Jade Void Palace of Kunlun Mountain, Meng Qi watched the scene and thought quickly:</p><p>“The heavenly venerate of virtue, the heavenly venerate of numinous treasure, Amitabha Buddha, the ancient Bodhi Buddha, the monster emperor, and the monster of Heavenly Dao all seem to have fallen into their own hands. Although they didn’t do it themselves, with the help of their belongings or the characteristics of their bodies, it is equivalent to the struggle for the other shore.”</p><p>“The current situation is that the long-lost heavenly venerate of Numinous Treasure seems to have made a casual move without showing any traces. It’s as if he didn’t participate in it directly. He only used Han Guang and Lu Ya to cancel out the power of the monster of Heavenly Dao summoned by Emperor Qing with the nail head seven arrow book. The Demon Emperor trapped nine spirits original saint and broke Emperor Qing’s most important arm without returning. Then, the heavenly venerate of virtue resisted Amitabha Buddha and ancient Bodhi Buddha to help Emperor Qing ascend to the other shore. It seems like he’s alone…”</p><p>“There are still a few important figures on the other shore who have yet to make a move. Emperor Fu’s condition isn’t right. The Devil Buddha is being suppressed, and the whereabouts of the primordial Lord of Heaven are unknown. Eh, why isn’t Old Mother Wusheng here to intervene?”</p><p>Seeing that it was difficult for Emperor Qing to pass through and that he was about to miss the opportunity, Meng Qi couldn’t help but think of the words he had left behind in the Fusang ancient tree. Originally, Emperor Qing’s obstacle was in the future, but who knew that in the end, it was the past medicine master Wang Fo who had a problem.</p><p>Uh, the Fusang ancient tree. Mother Wusheng once sent an oracle there. That fruit fell into my hands, and the opportunity for the Green Emperor to attain Dao was in the Fusang ancient tree. The two were closely related… in a split second, Meng Qi suddenly had an epiphany, in his hand, there was that strange fruit that he had obtained from the Fusang ancient tree.</p><p>So this was the son of the Golden Emperor!</p><p>It was really traceless!</p><p>If he gave this fruit to the green emperor, what would happen?</p><p>Would it be good or bad?</p><p>..</p><p>Outside the Changle Palace, the golden lamp was extinguished. There were specks of starlight in the sky that were about to merge into the sea.</p><p>Han Guang smiled and shook his head. His figure gradually became illusory and was about to disappear.</p><p>Suddenly, Gao Lan’s voice sounded in his ear. He said in a dignified and indifferent voice,</p><p>“Where’s your real body?”</p><p>The Demon Master had only come with the combination of the Heavenly Emperor’s Incarnation and Yan Mo’s incarnation. He didn’t know where his real body was!</p><p>Han Guang smiled slightly:</p><p>“The east wind has arrived. Of course, I have to reveal my plan.”</p><p>“Only when the green emperor attains the dao can he attract the attention of all the important figures on the other shore. He can take advantage of other things!”</p><p>“And only when the heaven sealing platform attains the legend with you can the great divine arts practitioners have no time to care about other things.”</p><p>The voice curled up, and Han Guang had already disappeared, leaving behind a meaningful smile.</p><p>..</p><p>In the depths of Mount Numinous.</p><p>Han Guang, who wore a wide robe and large sleeves, leisurely came to the front of the Five Finger Mountain. He raised his head and looked at the seven-colored Bodhi tree.</p><p>“I don’t know why Lu Ya changed his attitude, but this matter is beneficial to me, not harmful…”Han Guang smiled as he muttered to himself. His body changed, and a tathagata golden body that was one with the nine Buddhas appeared!</p><p>The huge tathagata golden body extended its hand and grabbed the Bodhi magical tree.</p><p>Everything was ready, and the East Wind had arrived!</p><p>The plot was exposed, and the Devil Buddha was released!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
