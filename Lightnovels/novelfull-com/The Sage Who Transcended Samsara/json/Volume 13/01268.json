Looking at Meng Qi in front of him, he felt that he was both familiar and unfamiliar.</p><p>When he abandoned Gao Lan and set foot on this path, he knew that his relationship with Meng Qi would not return to the beginning. The differences in their standpoints and pursuits would cause the two sides to gradually drift apart.</p><p>However, this was mainly due to the conflict between him and Gao Lan. Although they were on different sides, there was no direct conflict between them. A broken ship was still worth three pounds of iron, not to mention a friendship where they fought together and faced life and death together, no matter what, there would still be some remnants!</p><p>And at this moment, Little Meng was completely on Gao Lan’s side. He took the initiative to pressure himself and Qi Zhengyan. was he going to turn from a friend to an enemy?</p><p>Faced with Qi Zhengyan’s question, Meng Qi’s heart was filled with mixed feelings. The memories of “Did you remember me?”Surged endlessly. From acquaintance to familiarity, from familiarity to friendliness, from friendliness to friendliness, from friendliness to disregard for life and death, all the scenes and conversations surfaced. Senior Brother Qi, cousin, old fifth Zhao, and other terms reverberated in his mouth, but they finally stopped at Qi Zhengyan’s words, “The path is different, not with the strategy.”.</p><p>At first, he thought that it was just a temporary statement. Who knew that it would slowly become a reality..</p><p>After pondering for a moment, he dismissed his own emotions and examined all his thoughts. Meng Qi calmly said,</p><p>“This is a matter of mutual benefit. For a long period of time, you won’t be able to use the god Ascension Roll at all. The trouble comes from the Netherworld.”</p><p>At such a time and place, talking about friendship and the past was a blasphemy to the past. The best way was to analyze the pros and cons and negotiate normally.</p><p>The indifferent words entered Zhao Heng’s ears. He seemed to hear the sound of something shattering. It was the sound of the past collapsing.</p><p>Little Meng, who never abandoned his companions, faced danger head-on and did not run away. From the cautious little Meng to the truly trusted Little Meng, the humorous little meng, and the Cheeky Little Meng had completely become the sect master of the Hollow Jade Temple, the most powerful venerated immortal of today, the supporter behind the human emperor, had become a peerless expert who was indifferent, calm, and as deep as the sea.</p><p>He had probably rarely heard little Meng address him. Around him were the venerated immortal, the sect master, and other illustrious names..</p><p>Of course, he was no longer the old fifth Zhao of the past.</p><p>Time always urged people to change. The hearts of ordinary people changed, but the hearts of old people changed.</p><p>For some reason, the most memorable image in Zhao Heng’s mind was the encounter in Shen ‘Du that year. The broken courtyard was quiet, and weeds were growing everywhere. The sun shone through the trees, scattering golden spots on the ground. Meng Qi leaned lazily against the broken wall, he leisurely held a stalk of grass in his mouth. His head was obscured by the shadow, and only his mouth and jaw were the clearest, with a faint layer of green beard floating above it.</p><p>He was a human that year, and now he was an immortal.</p><p>Looking at Meng Qi not far away, Zhao Heng seemed to feel the insurmountable chasm between the two sides, the chasm that buried everything in the past.</p><p>“Do I have to give the god Ascension Roll to Gao Lan and watch him rule the heavens with humanity, advancing by leaps and bounds, making the gap between the two sides bigger and bigger, unable to be bridged?”Zhao Heng felt as if his voice had fallen from the sky, ethereal and lofty.</p><p>Meng Qi’s eyes were pitch-black, like a boundless universe without starlight:</p><p>“Once humanity rules the heavens, the human sovereign tree of this world will attract the wind and immediately become the target of public criticism. Although the benefits will be great, the corresponding price will also be extremely great. The top powers like Buddhism, the demi-human race, and Luoism will absolutely not tolerate this matter. There will be a long and repeated tug of war, and there will definitely be no time to be distracted by you. Moreover, I did not take the god Ascension roll for free. I will give you other benefits, benefits that will help you grow at a rapid pace. The value to you, who are in the Netherworld and surrounded by a pack of wolves, is far greater than the god Ascension Roll, which you are currently unable to use.”</p><p>Looking at the expressionless Qi Zhengyan, whose eyes seemed to have never changed, he paused and said,</p><p>“Nine chaos heavenly venerate, Xuan Ming Ghost Emperor, Black Heaven Emperor, nine Netherworld Blood Devil, unparalleled demon lord, and seven kills Daoist are all peeping at the scarlet mountain range. Although they have not taken any drastic actions for the time being because they are worried about each other, with their temperaments and style of doing things, this situation can not be maintained for long. Sometimes, a small stone will stir up violent winds and huge waves. If you don’t improve your strength as soon as possible and make the barrier of the scarlet mountain range stronger, what will you use to resist it?”</p><p>Qi Zhengyan stood there, his robe fluttering in the wind and the red stars flickering on his forehead. His eyes did not move at all and he said emotionlessly,</p><p>“They are coveting the Demon Emperor’s Claw, and the Demon Emperor’s claw is currently a burden for me, not a help. Once I have verified the legend and can temporarily isolate its influence, I will throw it out and do the two Peach Killing Three Warriors Act, completely disrupting the situation in the Netherworld and buying enough time for my own development.”</p><p>It was not that he did not want to get rid of the demon Emperor’s Claw, but with his current strength, along with the unfettered emperor, the black-armored demon Saint, and the others, he could only suppress it to prevent it from being contaminated. It was difficult for him to remove it. It was either killed by external forces and taken away, or after he proved the legend.., with the help of the other experts, he suppressed it to its limit and was able to get rid of it for a short period of time.</p><p>Hearing Qi Zhengyan’s answer, Meng Qi was not the first to feel emotional. He did not have the slightest bit of greed toward the demon Emperor’s Claw, a supreme divine weapon on the other shore level. Instead, he wanted to use it to plan the best situation for himself, instead, the conversation between the two was cold and without the slightest bit of warmth. It was as if a stranger was negotiating for benefits.</p><p>Who would have thought that this was a friend who could trade his life for his.</p><p>Fate always made such vile jokes..</p><p>“Although you have the knowledge and inheritance of the demon lord and are in the nine serenities realm, and your current strength is equivalent to a legend and can increase your insight into this realm, I’m afraid it will be difficult for you to break through in one or two years. Based on what I saw just now, the nine Chaos Heavenly Venerate’s patience probably won’t last that long. If there is no other help, the outcome can be imagined,”Meng Qi directly pointed out the core of the problem.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan was silent for a moment, as if he didn’t say anything. In the end, he said:</p><p>“What benefits can you offer?”</p><p>Zhao Heng listened to the conversation between the two and already understood the current situation. Although it would be difficult to control the situation in the future after sending out the god Ascension rankings, that was in the future. There were many dangerous situations in front of him and he had to find a solution.</p><p>If one didn’t have long-term concerns, there would definitely be near-future worries. However, if there was a conflict between near-future worries and far-future troubles, there was no doubt that one would choose near-future worries. Only by overcoming the difficulties in front of one’s eyes would one have the right to think about the future situation.</p><p>Zhao Heng closed his eyes and felt an inexplicable sadness in his heart.</p><p>From the Bodhi ancient Buddha’s opening of the board of gods, the heaven-sealing platform, and the map of spirits and true spirits, all his efforts had been completely wasted. He should have understood a fact: the dream of Imperial hegemony was already empty!</p><p>For now, the only thing he could do was to fully assist Qi Zhengyan and strive for the realization of an alternative idea. According to what he saw, Qi Zhengyan himself did not have any desire for power.</p><p>Hearing Qi Zhengyan relent, Meng Qi smiled and said,</p><p>“The first is Manjushri’s Pure Land of wisdom, a blessed-level pure land. It can resist the influence of the Netherworld, activate the wisdom of the evil gods, and make them rational. Moreover, after merging with the boundary of your scarlet mountain range, the restrictions of the Netherworld on your body will be removed a lot. Under the guidance of the Great Boundless Heaven and the Twelve Demon Saints, you will have the standard to resist the peak of the blessed-level. Even if you can’t resist the nine chaos heavenly venerate, the black heavenly emperor, and the other old guys, you will be safe and sound in the aftermath</p><p>“More importantly, with this, it will be easier for you to practice your own dao here. With half the effort, your chances of breaking through to the legendary realm will be greatly increased.”</p><p>At this point, he turned to look at Zhao Heng. “The second is this emperor’s calligraphy. The way of the king is condensed into words, and you can study it day and night. It will help you cultivate faster and increase your strength greatly.”</p><p>At present, Zhao Heng had also stepped into the Earth immortal realm.</p><p>Looking at the Hazy Pure Land of wisdom and the surging human emperor’s calligraphy of the way of the king, Qi Zhengyan and Zhao Heng looked at each other. Then, they nodded and took out the god-sealing roll that was shimmering with a faint golden light.</p><p>Meng Qi believed in Qi Zhengyan’s character very much. Without any oath, they directly exchanged.</p><p>After handing over the Pure Land of wisdom and the human emperor’s handwritten letter, and holding the scroll that seemed to be the manifestation of heaven and earth, he was prepared to shamelessly make a few jokes and put this matter behind him. Everyone would still be laughing and laughing, and they would still be friends. However, the scenes from earlier replayed one by one.., the heavy atmosphere remained unchanged, and he swallowed the words that were about to come out of his mouth.</p><p>Some things could not be ignored just by pretending that they had never happened.</p><p>The atmosphere was indifferent and strange. Qi Zhengyan held the Pure Land of wisdom while Zhao Heng held the human emperor’s handwritten letter and gave Meng Qi a deep look. He turned around and walked into the depths of the scarlet mountain range, leaving behind two straight backs.</p><p>Meng Qi did not speak. As he watched them leave, there was actually a kind of sadness brewing.</p><p>Seeing that Qi Zhengyan was about to disappear, he suddenly turned his head and said expressionlessly,</p><p>“The other shore seal has its own spirituality. If the external environment and the person who holds it both change, it will cause the seal holder to have a sudden inspiration and sense it. You’d better change and imitate the aura of me or the environment here.”</p><p>There was actually such a thing? Meng Qi was stunned at first, but when he looked again, Qi Zhengyan and Zhao Heng had already disappeared into the core of the scarlet mountain range.</p><p>Recalling what he had said just now, the corners of his mouth curled up bit by bit, and a smile appeared on his face.</p><p>The eight-nine divine abilities revolved, and his aura changed rapidly. Meng Qi seemed to have transformed into another Qi Zhengyan, and he put away the god Ascension Roll.</p><p>Just as he was about to leave, he suddenly frowned, and a worried expression appeared on his face.</p><p>Although he had obtained the god Ascension Roll, he was afraid that it would be even more dangerous than before. After changing his aura, he would no longer be able to perform the Boundless Dao of Chaos, hide all traces, and secretly escape from the nine underworld to return to the hollow jade temple!</p><p>In the outside world, there were nine Chaos Heavenly Venerates, Xuanming Ghost Emperor, Black Heaven Emperor, and other terrifying old fellows. Any one of them was not a match for him at the moment. More importantly, once an intense conflict broke out, the other factions would immediately detect it!</p><p>Although he could place all the unexpected variables on green emperor to deal with, this was not Meng Qi’s character.</p><p>As he looked out of the scarlet mountain range, the six evil and terrifying feelings leaped into his heart.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
