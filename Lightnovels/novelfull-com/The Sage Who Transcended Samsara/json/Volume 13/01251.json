According to what I had said before, I was scheduled to finish writing four million five to six hundred thousand words. Now that I looked at it, it would definitely exceed this length, but it wouldn’t be too much. In other words.., i had officially entered the final eight hundred thousand or so words of content. From three million to four million words, it was the most difficult one million words I had ever written. In the words of some of my classmates, the stall was too big, so it became very difficult to control it, there were many aspects that were difficult to manage, or perhaps I didn’t know how to manage them all. Just like how characters were created, many of the characters in the past could only try to take care of a few. Just like how fighting became more and more mysterious, they could only try to simplify it as much as possible, and their blood was no longer hot, just like how it was easy to control the rhythm, but difficult to relax it.</p><p>Therefore, the plan for the next book was to try to write a story about a small structure, to make up for the weakness I felt now, to accumulate more experience, and to work hard to improve myself. Since I had entered this industry, it wasn’t to make quick money, summary and improvement is the intention, I hope that each book can see some progress.</p><p>From the previous August to now, we have passed almost two years of time together, as long as this book has brought you some laughter, joy or moved, I will be satisfied, the last volume of more content, i will slowly write, I hope that when all the preset full, the last month can again burst out to thank you. In addition, please allow me to have a day off every month, just like after each volume, because writing a month now is as tiring as writing a volume more than half a year ago. Of course, only in these last few months. The next book is still the same.</p><p>As for this month’s holiday, I want to use it on the 15th. Because it is my grandmother’s 80th birthday and the postponed tomb-sweeping, the old man understands that we are out of town and have to travel back and forth to trouble, so I put the two things together.</p><p>Alright, today’s two chapters are in the evening. I have to think about the plot of the origin of life and death. Writing is not something that can be written with an outline and a well-thought-out story. The specific details are the test of time, just like how I already had the scene when the Golden Emperor and Xiao sang finally met, and even every line of dialogue, but to make this kind of meeting feel like a bang, an explosion, and an impact, how to write in the beginning, how to prepare, how to turn.., it wasn’t something that could be written by relying on an outline. One had to ponder over it bit by bit and find that kind of feeling bit by bit.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
