Therefore, they were not recognized by the rules established by the archaic characters. They were neither immortals nor gods, and they were not allowed to ‘open the door’, as for the magical equipment that he used to transform his aura, it was rooted in the eight-nine arcane art. With the aura of the legendary mighty figure senior brother Xiao Tian as the source, it was modified and blended into the interior of his body so that it could emit the pure aura of demons. According to the legends, if one did not pay attention.., it would be very difficult to see through it.</p><p>In other words, he was currently equivalent to a demon god whose strength had fallen to the level of an illegal body due to his injury. His ‘essence’was in accordance with the rules of the primordial language. Moreover, the restrictions on the level of the rules did not have any spirituality. He would be able to pass if he met the requirements, he would not take the initiative to analyze why he was satisfied and if there was a problem.</p><p>He Mu looked away. The thoughts in his mind surged. He had a clear understanding of the matter and understood why he, who was neither an immortal nor a god, was able to pass through the ‘barrier’set up by ‘one word for law’.</p><p>He could, but Jiuli and the other demons did not seem to be able to. Did it mean that master’s divination, foresight, and confidence in the nine Phoenix Relic Mansion were more than a notch above the minor saints such as the radiant light and the North Pole?</p><p>They knew that the danger in this primordial wasteland was only from the demon kings. The magical ability of the ‘five Virtues Heaven and earth fan’was enough to ensure the safe passage of their descendants, but it was as if they did not know that the imitation of the God of Heaven Mountain required the aura of an immortal God to enter, as a result, before Jiu Li and the others stepped on the primordial characters, master had already arranged everything without any smoke and fire. Only after the matter was successful did the person concerned understand what was going on!</p><p>Amidst ao qin, Fairy Jin Lin, and the other confused and confused voices, Jiu Li restrained her various emotions and asked in a deep voice, “What happened?”</p><p>“Mr. Yue Luo, how did you deceive the heavens and cross the sea to pass through this layer of restriction?”</p><p>Could it be that he was a demon king, a great demon, or a demon god pretending to be someone else? What he was deceived by was not the rule of ‘non-immortal, non-immortal, non-godly, non-invulnerable’, but himself and the other demons?</p><p>Looking at nine Glass’s crystal clear eyes, he mu did not know how to answer for a moment. He could not say that he was actually a human, and that he had to rely on a magical artifact to change his aura and adjust his physical body to deceive all of you. And this aura came from a pure little saint of the demon race.., even though he felt that his level had dropped by a lot, he was still considered an immortal by the rules?</p><p>If it were many people, they would not even bother with Jiuli and the other demons. Under the situation where they could not pass through the restrictions, they could climb the god of Heaven Mountain and enter the immemorial celestial world. They could take all the benefits for themselves, however, he mu always had a bottom line. He was also influenced by his master su Mengyin’s “Tianwen”. He liked to read books and had his own character. Jiuli trusted him and invited him, he really could not go back on his words.</p><p>More importantly, the peak of the God of Heaven Mountain might involve fragments of the primordial immortal world. Who knew if he would encounter any strange things? One more strength meant one more safety!</p><p>Even if his master said that his trip was a fortuitous encounter and did not hint at a calamity, it did not mean that he was safe. Perhaps, the premise was to cooperate with a few fairies until the end?</p><p>He Mu’s thoughts raced, after pondering for a moment, he looked at nine glass and the rest and said, “When I obtained this immortal sword, I coincidentally refined the remnant aura of a demon god of my race. It can be used at a critical moment to intimidate the opponent’s essence soul and spirit. I never expected it to come in handy at this moment.”</p><p>As he spoke, he narrowed his eyes and circulated his acupuncture points, forcing Xiao Tianquan’s aura to the surface.</p><p>Immediately, the sky darkened, as if the nine Suns were being swallowed. A terrifying and tyrannical pressure was emitted, causing ao Qin, Gu Yue, and golden scale fairy to tremble uncontrollably, as if facing a superior, only Jiu Li was slightly better. She was nourished by the sage’s virtue and was immune to all magic. A superior was like a dog, barely withstanding the shock and suppression, and could sense the weakness under the vigor and terror.</p><p>“Mr. Yueluo is not lying to me.”The corners of Jiu Li’s mouth curled up, and a smile appeared on her face. “Such a trump card is told frankly.”</p><p>He Mu restrained his aura and replied with a smile, “This matter is of great importance. If we don’t say it clearly, how can we cooperate?”</p><p>Jiu Li nodded slightly, as if she was very satisfied with He Mu’s answer. Ao Qin, Gu Yue, and the others felt a little jealous, but at the same time, they also felt that Yueluo did a good job and could trust him a little more.</p><p>“But, we can’t pass the restriction of ‘one word is law’, so how can we cooperate?”Fairy golden scale frowned.</p><p>Jiu Li said with a chuckle, “Have you forgotten that the devourer divine ability of the Heavenly Dog Clan has its own universe in its belly? It can hide us inside and pass the restriction?”</p><p>“That’s right!”Fairy golden scale clapped her hands, and Ao Qin and Gu Yue also showed a little joy.</p><p>He Mu was somewhat stunned. He wasn’t a real heavenly dog, so how could he know what the Sun Devouring Divine Ability was?</p><p>This… His thoughts spun rapidly, colliding with each other and sparking sparks. He Mu suddenly had an idea. He turned around and passed through the restrictions, returning to the foot of the mountain, he said in a deep voice, “My sun devouring divine ability has just been formed, so I’m not proficient enough. Everyone, please guard your vital points carefully so as to avoid being accidentally injured.”</p><p>Of course, this sentence did not raise any questions. On the contrary, Jiu Li and the other demons admired he mu’s carefulness. They immediately used their own methods to protect themselves, and most of their attention was focused on this.</p><p>Taking advantage of this opportunity, he mu opened his mouth, and at the same time, his left sleeve was lifted up.</p><p>The world suddenly turned dark, and the great sun seemed to have been swallowed up. Everything was muddled, as if it had become another universe.</p><p>Nine glass and the other demons did not resist the suction force. Before they could see clearly what was going on, they were sucked into the sleeve.</p><p>Universe in the sleeve!</p><p>He Mu moved the flowers and touched the wood, using this to deceive the world!</p><p>After Meng Qi and the Duke of Qi Huan, little white, exchanged for the universe in the sleeve, it had undoubtedly become the standard of the Hollow Jade Temple. After all, it did not need to focus on cultivating, and there was no need to worry about having no regrets in the mortal gate. It was truly useful, and everyone could cultivate it at the same time!</p><p>With his sleeves hanging down, he mu stepped through the invisible barrier of laws established by the archaic characters and stepped into the imitation God of Heaven Mountain once again.</p><p>Then, he opened his mouth and waved his sleeves, throwing jiu li and the other demons out. When they were feeling a little dizzy, he put his hands behind his back and slowly closed his mouth.</p><p>“The Divine Dog clan’s sun-devouring Abhijna is really extraordinary,”Jiu Li praised.</p><p>“It’s fine, it’s fine…”he mu replied sincerely.</p><p>Without further delay, the group climbed to the peak of the Divine Mountain. Along the way, they felt that this place was abnormally quiet. Not only were there no demonic creatures, they couldn’t even see a single blade of grass. Other than the green-gray rocks, there were also green-gray rocks.</p><p>Seeing this situation, he mu pondered for a moment, with a solemn expression, he said, “The friends who discovered this ruin earlier definitely didn’t go this deep. The two little saints’peeping and divination will definitely be influenced by the ‘one word is law’. In other words, after stepping into this mountain, we can no longer think that the restriction or danger is only at the level of a demon king, or even less. If there’s anything abnormal, I suggest that we immediately retreat. We definitely won’t take any risks.”</p><p>His master’s grasp of Heaven’s secrets should also be affected by Jiu Feng’s ‘one word is law’. If the top was really directly connected to the fragment of the immemorial immortal world, Heaven’s secrets would be more easily disturbed..</p><p>Hearing He Mu’s solemn words, Jiu Li and the others were silent for a moment. After exchanging glances, they said,</p><p>“Good!”</p><p>Their future was bright. No one was willing to sacrifice themselves for this matter.</p><p>Unknowingly, he mu seemed to have replaced Jiu Li as the leader of the team.</p><p>The imitation God of Heaven Mountain could not fly. In the dead silence, they spent a full two hours to reach the peak. The Sea of clouds covered the entire area, and there was an extra layer of heaviness in the air. Stepping on it, they could walk.., the ancient feeling of looking down on all worlds and savages from a high vantage point assaulted them.</p><p>“It really is the immemorial immortal world…”Jiu Li sighed with emotion.</p><p>At this moment, Fairy Jin Lin noticed an item hidden in the sea of clouds in front of her, so she stretched out her hand and took it over. What she saw was a rusty longsword. It was dim and had no spirituality, as if it was already dead, there were two ancient characters engraved on it — characters that were one level lower than the “Nine heavens text”.</p><p>“Nine heavens… This is a famous divine weapon, yet it was damaged here…”ao Qin glanced at it, feeling surprised and regretful.</p><p>Jiu Li nodded and said, “The Tiger’s death aura is still there. Even if nine heavens is damaged, its material isn’t low. I’ll put it away first and distribute it after I leave.”</p><p>No one had any objections. The group continued forward. Along the way, they found many precious divine weapons and rare materials, but they had lost their luster and power, as if they had been corroded by time.</p><p>This strange situation made them even more solemn and vigilant.</p><p>When they bypassed a palace made of white clouds, their eyes lit up. They saw a thing that looked like a hill in the distance. It was covered in dense mist and was surrounded by clear light. The white clouds around it protruded and turned into long strips, there were rays of light flowing on it, as if they were demonic blood vessels.</p><p>This thing that looked like a hill exuded an extremely ancient and boundless feeling. It was slowly expanding and contracting, as if it was nurturing something.</p><p>He Mu’s scalp went numb. At the same time, a thought flashed through his mind. Jiu Feng didn’t hesitate to expend his accumulation, using a single word as a method to make the immemorial immortal world eternally exist, all for the sake of nurturing this object?</p><p>Could it be that this was the fortuitous opportunity that master spoke of?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
