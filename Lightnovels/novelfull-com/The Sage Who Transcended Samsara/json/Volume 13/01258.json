The abstract and indescribable concepts of life and death turned into a myriad of patterns, they landed in the lifeless objects that Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang had pointed out.</p><p>Although they were only black and white, the patterns were divided into countless levels. They formed a unique picture scroll that seemed to contain all the mysteries of the Dao of life and death, forming tai chi!</p><p>Half of the picture was silent and peaceful. The intent of death was eternal. It contained everything. The other half was dark. It did not even have an abstract concept. There were only countless possibilities that gave birth to the most vigorous vitality. They intertwined with each other, they intersected with each other. The beginning fell into the end. The end seeped into the beginning and reached a delicate balance. The entire picture that contained the Dao of life and death did not collapse because it exceeded its limit.</p><p>At the beginning, Meng Qi still felt that he was gradually being assimilated by the Dao. But as he was gradually absorbed and refined, he found that he could somewhat control the illusory concepts around him, he incorporated the balance of yin and Yang, darkness and passion, hope and light into the yin and Yang Seal. He let the Yin and Yang Seal transform into tai chi, collapse in reverse, and return to Wuji. In this way, he could contain yin and yang, life and death!</p><p>During this process, he only felt that Gu Xiaosang’s consciousness was dancing around his thoughts, and his own consciousness could also embrace the other’s thoughts. Water and milk mixed together, and his soul was entangled. It was a wonderful feeling that he had never felt before, it was an unprecedented tacit understanding.</p><p>In this tacit understanding, both of them were shocked at the same time. The mysterious scroll containing the Dao of life and death flew out and covered the giant hand of Buddha’s light.</p><p>The glass rose, black and white erupted, and the dao patterns sank and floated in the Sea of light formed by the silence. In the end, the scroll of life and death and the giant hand of Buddha light disappeared at the same time.</p><p>The attack that the Fengdu Emperor was determined to get was blocked by Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang!</p><p>At the same time, the absolute blade, with its dominating aura and the determination to leave no way out, slashed toward the Fengdu emperor with an extremely brilliant and terrifying purple light, as if it was going to use the power of the deity to defend against Yi, and take advantage of the fact that its spiritual light was entangled by the true force, when the body paid attention to the point where Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang refined the origin, it was cut in half and turned into ashes.</p><p>The tree of Great Dao also flew up. Under Meng Qi’s command, it restrained its greed for its surroundings and flew around the seven treasures wonderful tree, delaying its descent.</p><p>Poof!</p><p>The Fengdu Emperor’s two palms, which contained death and reincarnation, pressed together in front of him, and just happened to clamp the absolute blade that was overflowing with lightning.</p><p>However, a thin crack appeared on the chest and abdomen of his black armor. Under the burning of the electric fire, he finally revealed a flaw that he should not have, it was slightly penetrated by the tyrannical saber qi.</p><p>The Fengdu Emperor’s deep, gem-like eyes showed no emotion, as if he had made a decision.</p><p>At this time, Meng Qi’s refinement was getting smoother. The conflicting concepts of life and death had been reconciled and balanced by his cooperation with Gu Xiaosang. Gradually, the Dao force related to the yin-yang seal was integrated, giving him a sense of reality, blurry and incomplete dao patterns emerged, giving him more and more understanding and control over life and death, yin and yang.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>These dao patterns, these insights, and these controls were intentionally guided by Meng Qi, forming a black mirror with white in front and black behind. The mirror rotated and collapsed, then suddenly rose up and flew into the spiritual light of his nature, which was located at an infinite height.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>In the illusory sound of the collapse, life and death, yin and Yang returned to the beginning, and merged with the spiritual light of his nature. They were no longer separated from each other, but could evolve at any time because of the creation of heaven and earth. With the help of this.., meng Qi’s spiritual light of nature grew higher and stronger, and it was naturally projected into the universe. There was no need to deliberately do it anymore.</p><p>In a short moment, he had broken through the two major obstacles from the legend to the creation. The “He I projection”was naturally derived. The Yin and Yang Seal learned from life contained life and death, condensed and sublimated, and looked toward the direction of the shortcut, with the vague and incomplete “Dao”in some aspects, and even because of the initial and final balance with Gu Xiaosang, the Wuji Seal also began to evolve after it contained yin and Yang, life and death.</p><p>If he did not forcefully sublimate the Wuji Chaos, Meng Qi would only be one step away from truly experiencing the sea of suffering and becoming a great supernatural being.</p><p>As he improved, the gap between him and Gu Xiaosang began to widen, and the balance between the two seemed to be tilting toward the depths. However, Gu Xiaosang was already prepared. Seizing the opportunity of the tilting attraction, an illusion appeared around her, she took the only step to prove herself.</p><p>Layers of the celestial world appeared in the sky and layers of the nine underworld. The two phenomena of the first kind actually appeared at the same time!</p><p>However, among the phenomena, the celestial world had a sense of emptiness and eternity, while the nine underworld was less chaotic and evil. It was very special. This was the first kind of legendary phenomenon unique to the line of the lifeless mother. It had never appeared before, it was called “The home of Heaven and Earth.”Regardless of whether it was the celestial world or the nine underworld, they would all return to their home.</p><p>The first type of vision disappeared in an instant. A white lotus flower appeared in midair. Its body was filled with all kinds of innate virtues. The closer it was to the center of the flower, the purer it was, and the darker it was. It even formed chaos, it formed a subtle and blurry point, with nothingness and the final point. The petals of the white lotus flower bloomed layer by layer. Each of them symbolized a different path, containing everything and saving all life.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s second type of legendary phenomenon: “Chaotic White Lotus”!</p><p>Seeing this, the Fengdu Emperor, who had already made up his mind, took a heavy step forward. He flicked away the absolute blade with both hands and created a reincarnation phenomenon. He suddenly dragged the spiritual light of his nature into it and let it escape from the purple sword light of Zhen Wu.</p><p>This phenomenon swallowed the body of the Fengdu Emperor. Then, it changed and “Reincarnated”into a new fengdu emperor. Whether it was his aura or his strength, he was at the peak of his body.</p><p>What was even more terrifying was that the new Emperor Fengdu had a deep intention to die. His armor turned white and full of vitality. The sword light of Emperor Zhenwu suddenly lost the traction of his Qi. It stopped in the abstract concept and gradually disappeared.</p><p>His train of thought was very clear. Zhenwu had yet to completely get out of the strange state. The sword attack relied entirely on the traction of the contradictory qi. It was an instinct. Once his “Reincarnation”did not belong to death, the Qi would be broken, zhen Wu, who had yet to regain his intelligence, would be confused without a target and would not be a threat.</p><p>After paying the great price of “Reincarnation”once, Emperor Fengdu had gotten rid of his biggest and strongest enemy. He could now go all out to interrupt the process of Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang refining the origin of life and death.</p><p>As one of the three corpses of the bigwigs on the other side, who had accumulated years of good fortune, how could he not see where the opportunity was? It would depend on whether he was willing to pay the corresponding price!</p><p>He extended his left hand and reincarnation descended. It was as dreamy as a dream, trapping the purple lightning-filled blade inside. The vitality and yang energy were counteracting each other, making it impossible for the other party to use his strength and escape for a while, this was the same trick he used to deal with the Monkey King Grand Sage.</p><p>At the same time, Emperor Fengdu’s right hand held the seven treasures magical tree that was entangled by the tree of Great Dao but was unable to hit Meng Qi. He poured in the powerful dao energy and the few illusory great dao that he condensed into it. Strange lights instantly flew up, the seven colors sprinkled down, bringing about the silence and Nirvana of everything. First, the tree of Great Dao was completely brushed aside, and then it pointed directly at Meng Qi. It brushed away the abstract concepts and the Crazy Life and death, it brushed away the vague dao patterns that surrounded Meng Qi.</p><p>In this process, the “Chaotic white lotus”naturally disappeared, and bits of bright stars appeared, filling the void and forming a dazzling ocean.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang successfully stepped into the legendary realm, but after the phenomenon of the “Sea of stars”disappeared, the origin of life and death moved again, and a peaceful world appeared, as if it was the final result that would never change, many creatures were in bliss in it.</p><p>Like Meng Qi, she also proved the fourth kind of phenomenon, but it was not the “Two lives standing together”, but the “Eternal destination”that relied on refining a part of the origin of life and death!</p><p>Once the legend was complete, the balance was restored. Meng Qi and Gu Xiaosang once again moved the origin of life and death, condensing a black-and-white scroll that contained almost all the Dao of life and death.</p><p>As the scroll was formed, Meng Qi’s refining intensified, and Wuji completed its evolution. Chaos and Nothingness blended together. At the beginning and the end, they were together, forming the balance of Taiji alone and returning to the spiritual light of his nature!</p><p>His spiritual light of nature rose again. He felt that the living beings in the world had all kinds of emotions and encounters. They could not obtain eternity and could not break away from the shackles. They merged into an illusory sea of suffering. If one was in the Sea of suffering, one would not be in bliss.</p><p>Another breakthrough in the barrier of Destiny!</p><p>The scroll flew out and was brushed by the seven treasures wonderful tree. The two entered a short stalemate.</p><p>At this moment, an extreme sense of danger suddenly flashed through Emperor Fengdu’s heart. It was as if he was about to reach the end of his life. However, before he could break out of the stalemate, he was already slashed by a purple Yang sword light.</p><p>The sword light split apart and attacked every thought in Emperor Fengdu’s mind. It did not give him any hope of coming back from the dead!</p><p>It spread throughout the world!</p><p>The killer was the demon Slayer’s true martial art!</p><p>Didn’t he only have instincts and could only attack me by relying on Qi? A figure appeared in Emperor Fengdu’s eyes. He wore a royal robe and a flat crown on his head. His face was thin and his eyes were deep. They shone with wisdom and there was a faint smile at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Zhen Wu did not look like he had lost his intelligence!</p><p>He did not look like he was in a state where he could not live or Die!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
