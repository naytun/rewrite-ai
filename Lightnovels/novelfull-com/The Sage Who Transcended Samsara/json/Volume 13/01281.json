Not a single person was fighting</p><p>The cold and horrifying curses that could freeze one’s primordial spirit filled the boundless darkness. The strictness of the starry universe did not diminish even a bit due to the existence of the nine-headed worm’s remnant mansion. Instead, it continued to corrode it.., ‘weathering’it.</p><p>Jiu Li quickly recalled the contents of the video she had watched and the teachings of her parents. She tried her best to remain calm and confident. Then, she imitated the calmness of the leader and the usual majesty of her parents:</p><p>“Don’t be in a hurry to open a mansion. First, search the mountain carefully. Make sure that there is nothing left and no other arrangements. Also, observe the changes in the flow of natural qi and the rhythm of Dao.”</p><p>The former was worried that there were other mysteries in this place or that there were dangerous traps. The latter was to collect useful details for deducing the mysteries of the forbidden laws of the entrance of the cave so that he could be ready to break the seal and open the door.</p><p>“Good!”Although ao Qin had always been very arrogant and looked down on ordinary demons who did not come from a family background, since he was chosen by the Arctic minor saint to carry out this important mission, other than being a descendant who did not receive much attention.., his actions would be even less noticed by others. He must also have a relatively outstanding ability to understand the general situation at the critical moment.</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a layer of ice-like cold light rose around him and wrapped around two subordinates who were at the same level as demon supremacies. Then, he flew out of the ship and went deep into the dark and cold universe, surrounded by layers of curses, he landed on the top of the mountain where the nine-headed worm cave abode was located.</p><p>In the layer of cold light, curses of various colors, ranging from dark green to pitch-black, were frozen and formed. They were like wriggling poisonous snakes and maggots.</p><p>The Ice Crystal Light Shook, and all kinds of mixed colors disappeared. Ao Qin turned his head and nodded, indicating that the mountain debris still had basic defensive abilities that could filter curses and resist the cold.</p><p>Seeing this, Guyue was surrounded by green winds that swirled into a vortex. There were thousands of ferocious and vicious black shadows mixed in. They escorted Guyue through the restrictions of the ship and flew past the realm filled with cold and curses, they successfully arrived at the peak of the mountain and landed on her waist. Blue waves surged out from behind fairy golden scales. They surged on the spot and swept to the left, repelling other things. Then, they carried this beautiful girl and slapped her toward the foot of the mountain, they each had two very powerful servants below the dharma body level.</p><p>“Mr. Yueluo, please.”Jiu Li smiled faintly and maintained a calm and composed posture.</p><p>He Mu returned the greeting with a smile. While he was processing the initial impression of the cave abode and the mountain peak in his mind, the five-colored sword radiance of red, green, yellow, white, and black soared into the sky and streaked across the horizon like a shooting star, leaving behind a brilliant trail of fire in the cold and eerie air, it quickly landed near the peak.</p><p>Jiu Li nodded slightly and suddenly clapped her hands lightly. Then, an old woman whose aura was no less than hers came out from the crowd and took over the ship. She presided over the array formation and trapped many demon strongmen and maidservants in their rooms.</p><p>The purpose of bringing them out was to show the arrogance of the few proud sons of Heaven and enjoy themselves. Even if they were traveling, they would still be surrounded by people, unwilling to not serve them, so as to minimize the suspicion of those who were interested.</p><p>At this moment, in order to prevent spies from lurking, riots, and sabotage, they were all put under the watch of their trusted aides!</p><p>After doing all this, the illusory wings on Jiu Li’s back unfolded. The patterns seemed to have formed ancient characters, revealing the beautiful and sacred meaning of the five virtues.</p><p>“Characters”lit up one by one, and finally stopped at the mysterious yellow light, condensing into a blurry thirty-three-story exquisite pagoda. It hung high above nine glass’s head, with strands of mysterious yellow virtues hanging down.</p><p>Taking a step forward, nine glass led the two demon venerable-level handmaidens, leisurely walking in the dark and cold void as if this was only their own garden. In an instant, they were unharmed and arrived in front of the cave abode without the slightest fluctuation.</p><p>As expected, they all had divine weapons or divine weapons on them… he mu nodded slightly, not surprised at all.</p><p>As a proud son of heaven, a descendant of a demon god or a little saint, if they did not have divine weapons on them when they went out to travel, it would only arouse suspicion!</p><p>However, they definitely would not have high-level items that were too powerful. That way, they would definitely attract a little attention.</p><p>Without saying much, the five parties each scouted their surroundings, observing the details and not letting go of any abnormalities.</p><p>After a while, after they had swapped their areas of responsibility a few times, they summarized their findings and confirmed that the mountain restrictions had been weakened to the extreme by the erosion of the long years and the cold and curses in the depths of the universe, many of the sinister arrangements had already been destroyed on their own, so there was no need to worry anymore.</p><p>Immediately after, the patterns of the wings on Jiu Li’s back flowed and changed from black and yellow to black and white. She made the exquisite pagoda transform into a moral taiji diagram.</p><p>The illusory diagram rolled down and drilled into her eyes. The details of the natural energy flow and the changes in Dao rhythm that she had observed and collected ‘poured in’one after another, spinning and deducing continuously.</p><p>Because the first discoverers had roughly investigated the situation around the cave abode, the lesser saint of Radiant Light and the lesser saint of the North Pole were not completely ignorant of the nine-headed worm cave abode. They deduced the possible types of door forbidden techniques from the various traces and clues, they also taught the relevant array diagrams and the law of change to Jiu Li, Ao Qin, and the other demons.</p><p>After combining the two, in the time it took to brew a pot of tea, the magical look in Jiu Li’s eyes disappeared. She nodded slightly and said, “The Heavenly Blood Fiend Grand Array is a famous forbidden spell in the immemorial era, but it has also been weakened to a certain extent. It no longer has the prestige that gods and demons can not escape from.”</p><p>He Mu’s left hand was curled up in his sleeve. Through the hollow jade divine calculation, he confirmed part of Jiu Li’s conclusion — he did not know much about the Heavenly Blood Fiend Grand Array. He could only calculate other things.</p><p>“I’ll be in charge of triggering the forbidden spell and enduring the counterattack. When the grand array reaches the critical moment of the Blood Fiend Life and death, Mr. Yue Luo will slash at the nine-headed bird pattern at the bottom left of the cave abode’s main door.”Jiu Li methodically distributed the tasks.</p><p>He Mu was the leader, so he had to stand out and take the lead at the beginning. Since Yue Luo had just joined, the rest of his companions had limited trust in him, so it was time for him to demonstrate his ability and attitude. That was why the first group of experimenters had made such an arrangement.</p><p>He Mu was about to agree, but when his gaze swept across the nine-headed birds that were emitting a desolate aura above the door.., he suddenly frowned slightly and said, “Don’t you guys feel that these nine-headed birds have different forms? They look like different characters?”</p><p>“So What? Their influence on the Qi of nature is already in our hearts. Does it matter if we recognize them or not?”Ao Qin said with a cold smile. He felt that he mu was just looking for trouble.</p><p>He Mu muttered, “What if it’s a crucial hint?”</p><p>Gu Yue said coldly, “Since the nine-headed Grand Sage is the demon god nine phoenixes from the primordial age, then if these patterns are words, they must belong to the primordial age. Do you still recognize them?”</p><p>He Mu hesitated for a moment and said, “I have some understanding of the primordial age characters. Give me some time and I might be able to recognize them.”</p><p>“You know something about archaic characters? Are you kidding me?”Ao Qin was so angry that he laughed.</p><p>He was the descendant of a legendary mighty figure, but he had never come into contact with any archaic characters or objects. Even his ancestor, the little saint of the North Pole, did not know much about them. How could an ordinary demon like him know archaic characters?</p><p>In order to improve his status, he did not hesitate to Bluff!</p><p>Gu Yue’s gaze shifted to the door. He did not believe what he mu had said about him being able to read ancient characters. The golden scale fairy also covered her mouth and transmitted her voice to jiu li, “Why don’t I cooperate with you?”</p><p>He Mu had always been cautious. He turned his head to look at jiu li and said sincerely, “The ancient great Sage’s relic residence is no small matter. You must not treat it lightly. Miss Jiu Li, give me fifteen minutes. If I can’t recognize it, it’s not too late to try opening the door.”</p><p>Ao Qin’s face darkened. He was about to scold her when Jiu Li raised her hand to stop him, she said calmly, “What you said makes sense. The ancient Great Sage’s remains can not be treated lightly. Furthermore, this matter involves your interests. I believe that you will not speak nonsense. However, the longer it drags on, the easier it will be for the matter to leak out and bring disaster. Hence, I can only give you the time it takes to brew a cup of tea. HMM, at least in this cup of tea, you must let us see the progress.”</p><p>He Mu nodded solemnly. “Don’t worry, Miss Nine Glass!”</p><p>As the saying went, words were derived from dao patterns. The higher the level, the closer it was to dao intent. The ancient Crimson Jade script was one of them, and the archaic script was no exception. The lower level could not do anything about it, but the higher level would definitely have something in common!</p><p>As he spoke, he quietly activated his own universal common sense amulet and found a forum to study the ancient script. He drew the image of a nine-headed bird on it and posted a thread. The topic was:</p><p>“Who can recognize this ancient character? Sincerely seek advice and wait online!”</p><p>At the same time, he mu posted the remaining nine-headed bird images with different images on other forums and groups that discussed similar things. There were some that repeated themselves to prevent others from deceiving them.</p><p>With the universal common sense amulet, he was not fighting alone!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
