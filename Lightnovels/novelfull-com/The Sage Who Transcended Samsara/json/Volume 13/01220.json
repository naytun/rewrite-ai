This ambition shall not fall</p><p>Worried about the matter of the founder of the sect, could it be that he did not ask Meng Qi to stay and personally sent him out of the Void Ending Mountain? Then, he sealed off this world, isolating it from the outside world.</p><p>Meng Qi’s figure flashed, and he directly appeared outside the realm where the fusang ancient tree was located. He saw the towering ancient tree with two stems supporting each other. There were leaves that looked like mulberry leaves, as if they were bathed in golden flames. The feeling of desolation, antiquity, and bloody heat filled the surroundings, it held up a world that was not inferior to the real world.</p><p>Stepping through the gap, the ancient celestial realm was like a picture scroll that slowly unfolded before Meng Qi’s eyes. It was ethereal and refined, but it was also filled with the dust of time. It was decaying and dead silent.</p><p>Without stopping, Meng Qi followed the details of Mo Fei and desolate Yao’s deduction and directly came to the front of the Fusang ancient tree. He felt two different auras from the two main branches. One was the supreme heaviness, and the other was the most profound mystery, it was as if an archaic emperor was standing side by side, looking down on the current era.</p><p>Cognitive reorganization. Old ideas collapsed, and new models were rapidly constructed based on the surroundings. What Meng Qi saw was no longer the same. The fusang ancient tree was like the skeleton of the universe. It stood in the darkness and vastness, carrying mulberry leaves on its shoulders, an entire universe made even legendary mighty figures seem abnormally small.</p><p>Meng Qi did not move forward. He stood quietly above the valley formed by the roots and branches of the towering ancient tree. Many thoughts flashed through his mind, but they settled down one by one and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>He extended his right hand and raised his index and middle fingers, writing large golden words on the cliff of the “Valley.”</p><p>“Yu Xu Su Meng is here to respectfully wait for Senior Emperor Qing. Leave a note at the current node.”</p><p>The words were glazed, like a talisman that wanted to suppress monkey sun at the foot of the five fingers mountain. It was solemn and sacred, but as soon as Meng Qi finished writing, he turned around and left. It was as if the Fusang ancient tree realm contained a flood and fierce beast that could threaten him, he did not even consider whether there would be someone who would come after him to destroy it and not allow him to leave a message.</p><p>Normally, there were all kinds of possibilities for future development. Even if Emperor Qing would definitely come here five years later, it did not mean that the words written by Meng Qi could survive until then. There were many people who wanted to destroy it with all kinds of methods, not hiding and not protecting was the same as opening the door to steal.</p><p>With Meng Qi’s current legendary realm and ability to examine thoughts, he naturally knew this. However, he was very determined at this time. He walked with a normal expression. He didn’t run away in a hurry, but was prepared.</p><p>Little sang had been guiding him to find the whereabouts of the Green Emperor. She left a book for him a few years later, saying that it would be very beneficial for him to peep into the future. Moreover, Zhixu Mountain just happened to deduce the time and place of the Green Emperor’s Dao attainment, moreover, the two “Destinies”were contradictory. If he did not understand the mystery behind all of this, he would be as stupid as an ox. Of course, he was not the ox demon king’s ox.</p><p>“Heh, no matter how good Zhixu Mountain is at divination and how much time they have accumulated, I’m afraid there is still a long way to go before they can deduce the matter of the green emperor attaining Dao. I wonder which existence deliberately guided them?” Naturally, he came to the gap in the Fusang Ancient Tree Realm, a smile curling up at the corner of his mouth.</p><p>Emperor Qing was the one closest to the other shore among the great divine arts practitioners who were still alive. It was definitely not easy for Zhexiu Mountain to divulge matters related to him. It was most likely as if they were looking at themselves, who currently had the “Cause of all the fruits”, even if they had an unimaginably strong point and corresponding treasures, and were able to make some predictions about Emperor Qing, the attainment of Dao would inevitably involve the struggles and struggles of the great figures on the other shore, how could they have a glimpse of the specific time and place?</p><p>The mighty figures of the Zhi Xu Mountain who were engrossed in their research and did not get distracted by other matters might not have noticed the problem, but when they heard the specific results of the deduction, they understood what was going on!</p><p>Since it involved the plans of the other shore, it was enough for them to complete this part of the matter themselves. They did not need to worry about whether the message would be destroyed, and others would worry about it. If they were too responsible, they would be implicated deeply, he would only face the difficult question of Heaven’s will, and the danger of life and death was unpredictable!</p><p>At the moment, he was not enough to be involved in the matters on the other side!</p><p>He had to retreat when he had to. He had to retreat immediately when he had to!</p><p>As for the benefits that Xiao Sang had mentioned, he had already obtained them in the Zhixu Mountain. He had a certain level of understanding of peering into the future. She was indeed “Honest with me,”regardless of Yue Ziqing’s description, or the specific situation of the “River of predestination,”could it be that the details of the possible future deductions by Huang Yao and the others were all “Within the meaning of the question.”.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and stepped out of the gap with his hands behind his back, returning to the Jade Void Palace of Kunlun Mountain in one step.</p><p>Once again, the clouds were deep and unknown.</p><p>..</p><p>Inside King Jin’s manor.</p><p>Yu Jinghua was wearing the clothes of a servant girl, doing dirty and tiring work. There was not a hint of complaint on his delicate and handsome face. Other than bean-sized “Beads of sweat,”he was completely focused.</p><p>The housekeeper beside him nodded slightly and praised her in her heart. This girl was indeed simple and honest. She did not have any tricks up her sleeves. This year, she did things seriously and followed the rules. She was hard-working and there was nothing suspicious about her, she did not show any signs of overreaching. Whether it was practicing martial arts, being loyal to the martial arts world, creating opportunities, or being close to the Royal Highness, she did not do anything!</p><p>“I have to mention this to the manager and add her monthly fee,”the housekeeper muttered to herself.</p><p>Yu Jinghua was definitely not as serious as he appeared to be. Her family had been hiding for almost a year, far exceeding the limit given by the six paths, but the follow-up missions had yet to be triggered.</p><p>There was nothing she could do. There was a god-level King Jin in the residence, and he was involved in the terrifying “Miracle”organization. She could only wait patiently, treating herself as a real servant girl, and there was nothing out of the ordinary in her every move, she even seemed to have forgotten that she was a reincarnator who had come from another world.</p><p>Only in this way could she hide safely in King Jin’s residence!</p><p>After finishing the work in her hands, Yu Jinghua put away her tools and followed the housekeeper to the next courtyard. The rest of the matters here were handled by the various daily organs of the Mo Palace.</p><p>After passing through the Moon Gate, Yu Jinghua met the gardener who had just trimmed the leaves inside. This was her teammate, Zhu Tianming.</p><p>As the two of them walked past, they nodded at each other and chatted casually. They did not pretend that they did not know each other. This was because their household registration was in the same place. Even if they entered the residence through different channels, they could not hide this fact. The more they stuck to this matter.., the easier it was for them to expose their flaws.</p><p>In the eyes of others, they would naturally think that they were an example of entering the residence first and introducing a group of fellow villagers after they had established their footing.</p><p>Yu Jinghua and Zhu Tianming could see the anxiety in each other’s eyes as they exchanged pleasantries, but there was nothing they could do since six paths did not give them any follow-up missions.</p><p>Could it be that they really wanted to be servant girls in the imperial residence of King Jin for the rest of their lives? This thought suddenly popped up in Yu Jinghua’s mind.</p><p>She had just parted ways with Zhu Tianming when their backs were still on the two sides of the moon gate when their bodies suddenly trembled and froze on the spot. Zhu Tianming did the same, as if they had a telepathic connection.</p><p>The familiar voice that they had not heard for a long time rang out!</p><p>..</p><p>Deep within the Imperial Palace of Changle, in a dark secret hall that was covered with restrictions.</p><p>Countless rays of light from the path of humanity gathered around him. Gao Lan, who was surrounded by many emperors, suddenly opened his eyes. Light was born in the dark, and the nothingness shone brightly, illuminating every corner of the hall.</p><p>Finally, there were enough ‘he and I imprints’!</p><p>Gao Lan looked cold on the outside, but his expression was indifferent. It was inevitable that there were some ups and downs in his heart as well. He sighed softly.</p><p>It was not a simple matter to use the mirror of this life to combine two personalities. The difficulties and repetitions in it were not something that an outsider could achieve. Through this, he had long understood what “I am what I am”was, when Yan Ran’s plan to resurrect failed, he had even seen through himself and all sorts of things. Up until now, he had accumulated enough.</p><p>Lowering his right hand and holding the emperor’s sword by his waist, Gao Lan slowly stood up. Standing proudly between heaven and earth, he muttered to himself as if he was both sentimental and solemn:</p><p>“A hundred years of suffering, a lifetime of vicissitudes. This heart will not change, this ambition will not fall!”</p><p>With a clang, he pulled out the emperor’s sword. It was a piece of light gold.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
