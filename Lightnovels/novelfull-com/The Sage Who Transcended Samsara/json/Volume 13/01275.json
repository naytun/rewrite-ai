If you forward this news to three groups, you will immediately receive 100 imperial coins!”</p><p>When similar news appeared in every corner of the world, those who saw it would often scoff at it, they would say things like “The deception is too old”, “The self-proof legend of Emperor Yuan is only a little more than ten years old, how could he achieve good fortune so quickly”, “The one who was tricked obviously needs to recharge his IQ”, and so on, however, when the people who had chosen to forward it for various reasons and obtained the Yuan emperor coins screenshots confirmed it, the public immediately fell into chaos.</p><p>Could it be that he could really receive a hundred Yuan emperor coins?</p><p>Could it be that the Yuan emperor immortal venerable really only used a little over ten years to step into the fortune from the legend and become a great divine arts practitioner?</p><p>However, when they tried to forward it, they were unable to obtain the Yuan emperor coins. There was only one message reminding them:</p><p>“The world congratulatory event has ended. Please look forward to the next time.”</p><p>Many pairs of eyes were filled with shock. Meanwhile, in the gatehouse of the hollow jade temple of Kunlun Mountain, Daqing Gen let out a long sigh. “What a pity. I only applied for this bit of Yuan royal coins.”</p><p>His voice was filled with three parts regret, three parts regret, three parts satisfaction, and one part self-satisfaction.</p><p>Compared to the unperturbed human world, the news of Meng Qi’s creation swept through the various pure lands, the heavenly realm formed by the sea beads, and other places like that like a whirlwind.</p><p>In the Monster Emperor Palace, the huge bull demon king had just sent Xiao Tianquan away when his heart suddenly moved. He felt the subtle fluctuations of some Great Dao in heaven and earth.</p><p>“Condensing an illusory Great Dao? Yin-yang… Life and death… void…”bull demon king frowned, looking extremely puzzled. “Who is advancing to the creation realm?”</p><p>How could there be so many great dao fluctuations?</p><p>This was unbelievable!</p><p>However, this was not the first time he encountered such a situation. When his sworn brother, the Equal Heaven Grand Sage, stepped into the destiny realm from the legends, he also stirred up many great dao. The 72 changes all had their own meanings. However, compared to this person today.., he was still inferior.</p><p>Bull demon king was known for his purity. When he advanced to the Destiny Realm, he only condensed two illusory Great Dao, ‘strength’and ‘Earth Element’. He did not know much about such things.</p><p>“He fused into chaos? He opened up… Karma…”just as bull demon king was shocked and enlightened, he saw the Little Fox Qing Qiu carrying the demon Saint Spear on her back. She pushed open the door and walked in. She said with a serious expression on her pretty face,</p><p>“Great Sage Ping Tian, Su Meng has attained destiny.”</p><p>“He…”bull demon king said in a low voice. It was as expected.</p><p>Because they sensed the abnormal fluctuations of the Great Dao, Demon King Roc, Demon King Flood Dragon, and the others also gathered. When they heard the Little Fox’s announcement, they felt that it was unexpected and reasonable.</p><p>After the news that Su Meng had refined a part of the origin of life and death spread, all the major factions knew that he would soon become a great divine arts practitioner. But who would have thought that it would be so fast? It was more than “Not long”, there was practically no time gap!</p><p>After a short period of silence, the Proud Demon Roc King suddenly sighed:</p><p>“When we first met Su Meng, he had yet to touch the threshold of the legend. We are all great saints who have accumulated years of experience and have formed early in our destiny. Now that we have just eliminated our weakness and recovered to our peak, he can already be on equal footing with us.”</p><p>Other than Sun Wukong, he and Demon Ox King were stronger than the other great saints. However, they had yet to see the end of the sea of bitterness. In other words, they were not at the peak of the Destiny Realm. They could only be considered as the best in the middle reaches. They were comparable to the real nine heavens thunder god back then, although SU Meng had just entered the destiny realm, from the commotion just now, he could see that the boundless chaos had taken shape. The will to open up the world had taken shape. The cause of all the fruits had a few characteristics of the other shore. They could control fate. In a one-on-one situation.., it was difficult to predict the outcome of the battle. It all depended on the terrain and the environment. For example, if he could not be everywhere in the immortal world, his absolute speed would definitely surpass Su Meng. Thus, he would have the advantage.</p><p>Bull demon king sighed, “It has only been a few years. It feels like we have been fed to the dogs after years of hard work. The last time I was depressed was when my seventh brother advanced into the Destiny Realm.”</p><p>Seventh brother was the monkey king, Sun Wukong. He was born into a legend. He was the only one in all the worlds and there was no one who could match him. In just a few years, he reached the Destiny Realm and his fame spread far and wide.</p><p>The Little Fox Qing Qiu heard the Great Saints sighing and her mouth twitched. She felt as if she was being fed to her face.</p><p>I haven’t even reacted yet. Is there a need for all of you?</p><p>When I first met that fellow, I could tear ten of him apart with one hand. Now that he has become a destiny, I am still a step away from becoming a legend!</p><p>She coughed lightly and attracted attention. She lowered her eyebrows and said solemnly,</p><p>“His Majesty the Demon Emperor has asked me to inform all of you that Su Meng’s ‘Karma of Karma’already has the magic of a half-step dao fruit. He will be the one to witness and retaliate against the vows and contracts of all the worlds in the heavens. All of you must be wary of this.”</p><p>“I’ll do it! That works too!”Bull Demon King cursed. He had the feeling that Su Meng had become an important figure on the other side.</p><p>He would be the one to witness and retaliate against the vows and contracts of all the worlds in the heavens? This was impossible to guard against!</p><p>The Grand Sages looked at each other and felt a little scared.</p><p>The Little Fox Qing Qiu held a talisman that was covered with a dark yellow luster and said seriously,</p><p>“If the grand sages wish to swear or make a contract in the future, think about the contents of this talisman. Let the Karma Connection go to His Majesty the Demon Emperor first so as to conceal the key.”</p><p>Hearing this, bull demon king heaved a sigh of relief, “Thank goodness His Majesty the Demon Emperor is here. Thank goodness that thing is not the other shore…”</p><p>..</p><p>In the land of Buddha, Maitreya sat cross-legged on the White Lotus throne at the top of Mount Meru.</p><p>After ten years of bitter cultivation, along with Amitabha’s guidance and a certain opportunity, he finally made up for the heavy blow he suffered last time and regained his strength, however, the crystal that explored the other shore, the “Future sarira”, could not be condensed again.</p><p>However, if one was willing to give up, then there would be gains. In Buddhism, one had to know how to let go. Maitreya, on the other hand, used this opportunity to gain enlightenment. He only waited for the opportunity to come and made a big wish:</p><p>“Do not save all living things, do not save the Apocalypse, do not seek the future!”</p><p>At this moment, the white light around his body became waves, rolling and rolling. His eyes were half open and half closed. It was unknown where his mind was wandering.</p><p>Suddenly, Maitreya slowly opened his eyes and looked out of the Buddhist kingdom on the ground. He sighed softly:</p><p>“The cause of all the fruits has returned to its original position. The burning lamp ancient Buddha is in trouble…”</p><p>His voice reverberated on the top of Mount Meru with faint but complicated emotions. After a long time, he slowly stood up and a lotus grew under his feet. A smile appeared on his face once again, and he was about to escape to a certain perfect pure land.</p><p>Buddhism had always valued karma, so they had to be wary of SU Meng in this aspect!</p><p>Moreover, he had already become an important figure, so he had to ask Amitabha for advice.</p><p>..</p><p>In his hometown of vacuum, the night emperor was asking Immortal Zhenyuan, who shared the same monarch with the world, for advice on cultivation matters.</p><p>He had already mastered the tribulation law of the myriad faces and worlds, and possessed an unusual legendary characteristic. He was only one step away from being able to prove his uniqueness, so he had no choice but to take the initiative to ask for advice.</p><p>At this moment, Zhen Yuan Zi, who was standing in front of him, suddenly stopped talking. His gaze was deep as he looked outside his hometown of vacuum. He lightly said,</p><p>“Yu Xu, Su Meng’s body has been blessed.”</p><p>“What? Su Meng has already become a great divine ability user?”The night emperor’s gaze suddenly froze.</p><p>Wasn’t this a little too fast? The gap between him and him did not shrink, but instead grew bigger and bigger!</p><p>Zhen Yuan Zi stood up expressionlessly and walked slowly into the depths of his hometown of vacuum. His voice echoed in the surroundings:</p><p>“Once you leave your hometown of vacuum, you are not allowed to swear an oath, make a contract, or speak of Su Meng’s name. I will now ask the gold emperor to see how we can guard against this matter.”</p><p>..</p><p>Inside the goddess immortal realm, Liu Luo was smiling. He was elegant and refined, and his immortal aura was overflowing. He was sitting opposite Nezha.</p><p>Suddenly, both of their expressions changed as they looked at the infinite high ground where the hollow jade temple was located.</p><p>“As expected of the Karma.”After a moment of silence, Liu Luo said with a smile, “I’m almost catching up to you.”</p><p>Nezha curled his lips and said unwillingly, “If not for the rebirth of the chaotic green lotus seed, which is equivalent to an innate god, I wouldn’t have been so slow to improve.”</p><p>Liu Luo covered his mouth and laughed, “This is far worse than the limitations of an innate God’s body. There are many ways to solve it, but it is still you…”</p><p>Nezha narrowed his eyes and a dangerous light shone from his eyes. He did not seem to want to talk about this matter, but Liu Luo stopped when he saw the opportunity. He smiled and said, “The end of the tribulation has arrived. This is your chance to break through the shackles.”</p><p>Nezha nodded, “When the end of the tribulation comes, the heaven and earth will loosen up. This is the time when it is relatively easy to break through.”</p><p>Liu Luo shook his head and sighed:</p><p>“No matter how the Apocalypse comes, no matter how the Heaven and earth loosen up, it still depends on oneself. Su Meng’s generation is a galaxy of stars. Although not many people have fallen, only three or four people can keep up with the pace of the times. Su Meng is one, the demon lord is one, and Gu Xiaosang can be counted as one if she successfully resurrects. In addition, Wang Siyuan is half, Jiang Zhiwei is half, and the rest are left behind. As for he jiu, Wang Zai, Cao e, and Liu Su, they have long been unable to catch up.”</p><p>After watching Nezha leave, the nine heavens mystical maiden, who was in the past, suddenly turned serious and ordered the maidservant next to her,</p><p>“From today onwards, the most important things will not be written down and the oath will not be made. Also, when discussing Yu Xu and Su Meng, do not bring his name with you.”</p><p>..</p><p>In a certain secret area, Han Guang, who was holding the Bodhi magical tree with both hands and sitting cross-legged on a half-holy and half-filthy lotus throne, slowly opened his eyes and whispered,</p><p>“The cause of all the fruits…”</p><p>It was as if he had returned from a long slumber.</p><p>..</p><p>In a hazy place, Wang Siyuan coughed a few times and said with a faint smile,</p><p>“You deduced faster than me…”</p><p>There was a turtle shell floating above his head. It was the Luo book that he had lost back then!</p><p>He did not know when or what he had done, but he had quietly taken the treasure back!</p><p>..</p><p>In the grave thatched cottage in the Thrushcross Grange.</p><p>Mr. Lu Da was focused on purifying himself, comprehending his True Self, and comprehending the profoundness of the Infinite Heights.</p><p>Suddenly, his gaze changed, and his entire being seemed to be strangely elevated. He looked down at the world from the Infinite Heights. It was a line formed by many points, a face formed by many lines, and a void formed by many faces. The void overlapped, it was an infinite height that interweaved with time to create heaven and earth..</p><p>The doubts he had in the past vanished into thin air with this sight. Mr. Lu da finally figured out his position.</p><p>He slowly opened his eyes and looked at the hollow jade temple of Kunlun Mountain. A smile appeared on his face.</p><p>..</p><p>In the Real Hollow Jade Temple, Meng Qi was waiting for Emperor Qing to pass the god Ascension Roll to Gao Lan. He was not too happy about his success in breaking through the destiny realm, so he did not have the intention to show his divinity in front of others.</p><p>It wasn’t that he wasn’t willing to break through, but the closer he got to the other side, the more he understood his own powerlessness.</p><p>When he cut off the past and future, and broke away from the Devil Buddha, he was extremely excited and gratified. He felt like he had freed himself from all shackles. When he proved that he was the only one, it was to break through before the crisis and being abandoned, he also had a great sense of success, but in these two stages, the things related to him were far away from the big figures on the other side. In their eyes, he did things freely and wantonly, and he had the satisfaction and vengeance that he wanted in the beginning.</p><p>When he was close to the good fortune, the things he came into contact with were more and more related to the other side, and his own powerlessness became more and more obvious. He felt more and more helpless as a chess piece and the pain of being entangled in karma.</p><p>With his current ability, it was difficult for him to have both. He could only barely protect it. It was difficult to guess what the will of Heaven would be in the future, and he could not contend with it.</p><p>Therefore, achieving the good fortune was only a small step for him to reach the other side. There was nothing to be ecstatic about. Only by transcending the sea of bitterness and becoming the person on the other side could he be qualified to jump out of the chessboard and become a chess player, even if there would still be a trade-off when the time came, at least he wouldn’t be as powerless as he was now.</p><p>It didn’t matter if he had lofty aspirations or if he was aiming too high. In short, his gaze was only at the end of the sea of bitterness, above the other shore!</p><p>Meng Qi’s thoughts surged and turned into a sigh in his heart:</p><p>“No wonder many great divine arts practitioners like to call the realm of good fortune the sea of bitterness…”</p><p>“It really is the sea of bitterness…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
