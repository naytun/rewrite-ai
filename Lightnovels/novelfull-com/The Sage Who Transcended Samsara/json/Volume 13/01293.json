It was hard to tell the real from the fake. It had the state of the void and the virtue of Dao and nature. In a short moment, everything in its path was born. The demonic qi dissipated and the filth was clean, unlike the nine netherworld, it was more like the Buddhist land of the immortal realm, which occupied most of the possibilities in the future. It made Han Guang suddenly feel that he could not avoid it. He felt that his fate was destined. The five elements in his body were out of balance. His inner landscape was in disorder. His vitality was drained and his longevity was destroyed, he was so weak that he was like an ant.</p><p>This was the terror of facing the big figures on the other side. If he had not been in the nine underworld for many years, his past traces would have been covered by the same big figures. He would have long been killed by the river of time that the Green Emperor had traveled back to the real world, before he escaped into the nine underworld, the nine chaos heavenly venerate, the black heavenly emperor, and the other pseudo-existences on the other side were helpless. They did not even have the chance to face him!</p><p>Only those on the other side could resist those on the other side.</p><p>Even so, when the illusory dao fruit condensed by Green Emperor showed its corresponding power, they couldn’t resist it either!</p><p>Fortunately, this was the ninth underworld.</p><p>“Do you really think that I, the ninth underworld, have no one?”Ghost Emperor Xuan Ming roared angrily. A huge dark green ghost claw stretched out from a certain layer of the ninth underworld. The ice-cold spread, and the deathly aura was dense. It destroyed the vitality and froze the new shoots, bang! It hit the side of the Green Wood.</p><p>Immediately after, countless evil Ghost Phantoms appeared. They swam up along the prominent river of time and collided with the green wood that had suddenly returned to a few breaths ago.</p><p>After two exchanges, the Netherworld was shaken and the aura of death dimmed. Ghost Emperor Xuan Ming found it difficult to suppress the green wood, and he felt like he would be able to escape from it at any time.</p><p>Moreover, a large part of green emperor’s will was still above the Heavenly Dao monster!</p><p>Black Heaven Emperor made his move. His parallel fingers formed a sword and pointed out in the void, jumping continuously in the river of time, cooperating with the Evil Ghost Shadows to seal the changes of the green wood.</p><p>A few breaths ago, when the nine nether world was still not moving, the Green Wood, the ghost shadows, and the finger swords were stirring the space-time and constantly colliding.</p><p>A few hours ago, when the dozens of evil demons and evil gods were still unable to sense the half-year period, the green wood flashed past, the Ghost Shadow soared, and the finger sword guided the apocalypse, causing them to die in the past and disappear in the present.</p><p>A few days ago, a few months ago, a few years ago, the collision between the other shore and the two false other shore changed many things in the past, causing some changes in the present, but it still did not affect Han Guang!</p><p>If the pseudo-other shore did not have this ability, the nine underworld would have been flattened long ago!</p><p>Han Guang naturally would not be pleased that the Azure Emperor had been stopped. He had been stopped from the past to the future. Seizing the opportunity, he used the golden ten thousand character talisman to melt the seven-colored relic, and used the blood light of the reverse Buddha to absorb the Bodhi seed that had transformed into a demon.</p><p>Without a sound, the Buddha light shone brightly, and the demonic qi was pitch-black. The two were clearly against each other, but they seemed to be one and the same. Yin and Yang were balanced.</p><p>Inside the glazed luster, the heavenly emperor’s true body stepped in. He held his hands behind his back and raised his head. His aura pressed down for a lifetime. In the blood-black foul qi, the six destruction Yama’s body sat cross-legged. Each index finger represented a kind of destruction, a kind of depravity, they gradually overlapped with Han Guang’s true body through the fusion of the Buddha’s light and demonic qi. There was no longer any conflict or repulsion. They resonated with the Phantom of the immortal realm in the sky and the picture of the nine underworld that descended. It seemed like they were about to affect the real nine heavens.</p><p>It was different from the legend of the demon Saint hiding in the nine Netherworld to the real world. Han Guang wanted to seize part of the authority of the heavenly emperor and needed to communicate with the immortal world. Hence, the heaven and earth were dark. There was a sky above and a deep sea below. The Clear Air Rose and the murky air sank, it was a spectacular sight.</p><p>At this moment, a faint golden figure fell into the nine netherworld. Ripples were created as if a huge rock had fallen into the sea. Waves surged.</p><p>It was a golden ape. It wore a phoenix-winged purple-gold crown and a golden chain armor. It was walking on clouds and carrying a ruyi golden staff. Its aura was extremely powerful, and it seemed as if it could sweep through this layer of the netherworld. It was the Monkey King Grand Sage, Sun Wukong!</p><p>He had just entered the netherworld when his body changed. His golden fur turned dark and his face turned green. The acupuncture points all over his body opened up, and waves of demonic qi that looked like snakes and hands surrounded him. His extremely powerful aura actually advanced another step, he resonated with the nine Netherworld and connected with it. He struck the illusory long river of time with his club, once again stirring up ripples. It directly solidified Han Guang’s fusion with a few bodies and proved his only progress.</p><p>In the nine Netherworld, I am also the other shore!</p><p>The nine chaos heavenly venerate pounced over under the guidance of the aura. Destruction surged toward the Monkey Heaven Grand Sage like a wave. At the same time, the nine Netherworld blood demon turned into a red figure that seemed to be real and fake. It seemed to be neither real nor fake, and it pounced over with its body, they traveled across the river of time.</p><p>They did not really want to fight to the death for this, but this was the will of the nine Netherworld!</p><p>The three of them were entangled together. Even with the Monkey Grand Sage’s might, he could not suppress the two fake shores.</p><p>After surviving this calamity, Han Guang finally heaved a sigh of relief. In this world, other than the Pure Source Mystic Dao True Lord, there were no other powerhouses who entered the nine Netherworld and became the fake shores. And because the green emperor was being dragged by the Heavenly Dao monster, the Black Heaven Emperor had more strength left, who would dare to try?</p><p>Crackle, crackle, crackle. The overlapping dharma bodies burst out with crisp sounds, as if countless passes had been opened and finally became one.</p><p>Light flourished, and “Water waves”flowed out. They seemed to be black and white, and they were both clear and turbid. Then, Han Guang’s current Dharma body appeared. This was the image of a towering and ethereal monarch. His color was dark, and he wore a crown on his head, around him was the river of time, and under his feet were two terrifying demonic dragons. His gaze was far-reaching, allowing the Buddha’s will and evil nature to be hidden deep within.</p><p>He controlled the heavens, and he controlled the nine underworlds. This was an unprecedented “Dao body of a ruler”!</p><p>Weng!</p><p>A strange sound suddenly appeared in the void. Han Guang’s acupoints opened one by one, and light condensed into the shape of a human.</p><p>In the real world, many solemn gods appeared in midair. There were star lords who attracted the purple myrtle illumination, ancient gods who wielded lightning, mysterious women who used weapons, and Yuan lords who were surrounded by tens of thousands of stars, when the imprints of the Gods of the ancient Heavenly Court appeared, the Evil Gods, Ghost Kings, and Yama Asura all appeared below. It was extremely terrifying.</p><p>The second type of the legendary phenomenon, “Gods and demons coming to court”!</p><p>It was a phenomenon that only existed in the process of deduction!</p><p>Han Guang had known who he was many years ago, and he had accumulated a lot of experience to this day. It was easy for him to step out of the legend. He even had the energy to look at the heaven-sealing platform and the high view of the human emperor sword and the god-sealing platform, he slowed down the process of merging the god Ascension rankings and the heaven sealing platform into one.</p><p>His gaze was deep, without anger or anger.</p><p>When their gazes met, Han Guang seemed to sense something that he had as well: ambition!</p><p>If he could not completely control it, he would not be able to contend against it. Letting the third party act as a restraint and balance was a wonderful move, leaving enough foreshadowing and enough variables.</p><p>With a brilliant light, the god Ascension Rankings disappeared from the heaven sealing platform. The surrounding stone walls were covered in a faint golden color, condensing into one God after another. They carved down one God’s true name after another, layer by layer, it wasn’t until the Ziwei Star Lord and the Nine Heavens Thunder God stopped, and they were rather dim, as if they couldn’t hold on much longer. The Five Emperors of the five directions and the three Purities Dao ancestor of the highest level were still stone sculptures, it was completely beyond the reach of the god Ascension rankings and the Heaven Ascension platform.</p><p>How could there be a powerful figure on the other shore or someone close to the other shore just by bestowing a title!</p><p>Even if it was star Lord Ziwei, without legendary strength, it wouldn’t be able to withstand the augmentation of Starlight and divine power. The limit of mortals ascending to the heavens in a single step was only as high as star officials.</p><p>As the Heaven Ascension Platform and the god Ascension rankings completely fused, and as the phenomenon of “Gods and demons coming to the other shore”appeared, the world suddenly shook. The nine-layered broken immortal realm shook violently, as if it was about to turn from an illusion into reality.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>A strange sound rang out in the sky, and the nine-layered illusory shadows lit up from the bottom to the top, allowing people to clearly see their own dilapidation.</p><p>The light spread all the way to the third level, illuminating the signs of collapse, illuminating the Gray Stone Hall hidden in the darkness.</p><p>The authority changed, and each had their own gains, resonating and living!</p><p>In the hollow jade temple of Mount Kunlun, Meng Qi’s eyes shot out black and white rays of light, and his figure disappeared mysteriously. Under the light of the Qing clouds, he penetrated through the illusory barrier that was mixed with chaotic currents, and stepped into the third level of the former nine-layered sky, the level with the Peach Garden.</p><p>At the same time, the nine Immortals Mountain, the three clouds island, the Buddhist kingdom on Earth, and the hometown of vacuum cut through the illusory light and entered this world. It was Guang Chengzi, the heavenly venerate Wen Shu, Maitreya Buddha, and other great abhijnas!</p><p>Sensing this movement, Meng Qi sighed.</p><p>These were the survivors of the ancient times who might have participated in the fall of the Heavenly Court. They were the ones who faced the destruction of the nine heavens. Today, they came again and re-entered this place, would the secrets hidden by the fog of time be completely revealed in front of their eyes?</p><p>What role did they play in the heavenly court that came to an end 200,000 to 300,000 years ago?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
