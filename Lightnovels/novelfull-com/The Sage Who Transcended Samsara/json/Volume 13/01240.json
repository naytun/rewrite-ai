The Bodhi Jade, the spirit spring, and the Brahma flower bloomed. It was peaceful and peaceful.</p><p>Suddenly, a blood light flashed, and a dark red near black figure slowly emerged. It was the asura primogenitor who had escaped from the “Origin of life and death”.</p><p>Six of his nine heads, in the phases of Wrath, Slaughter, Lust, and destruction, had disappeared, and only a little over three hundred remained of a thousand eyes. There was also a nearly half-empty, lifeless mass of blood and black pus, as if sobbing, and the 999 arms that were blooming like petals around him were already sparse, and the 24 huge legs covered with scales were uneven. Just the appearance alone was exceptionally miserable, with his realm and the ability derived from the flesh and blood of the demi-god and demi-demon body, there were no signs of squirming and recovering. It was as if the part that was lost had been lost forever.</p><p>“The true martial arts has actually reached such a level…”the asura primogenitor could not help but sigh inwardly.</p><p>Although the life and Death Origin Point’s bonus to his body was not as good as nine serenities, it was still out of his expectations that he could not even block the true martial arts sword. It was as if he had squatted in the deep mountains and cultivated for an entire sixty-year cycle, and his martial arts had finally reached great success, when he tried to step into the secular world to summon the wind and rain, he found that he could not block the casual attack of the enemy that he had expected.</p><p>The Asura primogenitor closed his wounds and maintained a miserable appearance. He hid in the Pure Land and waited quietly. After a long time, he confirmed that he was the only one who survived!</p><p>“It’s okay if your injuries are serious. It’s good that you’re Alive!”The Asura primogenitor adjusted his emotions and left the Pure Land.</p><p>Such serious injuries might never be healed, making it impossible for him to be as strong as he was in the ancient times. However, it was still better than having his lifespan exhausted. He had to seal his main body, and he would not be able to unleash even one-tenth of his strength. At least after he comprehended the path of life and death.., he had benefited greatly, and his lifespan had also become abundant. By then, he would be able to reach 70-80% of his standard. Moreover, if he had the opportunity in the future, he might be able to recover from his injuries. For example, he could enter the “Origin of life and death”again.., he could use the ‘will of life’to heal his injuries!</p><p>After leaving the Pure Land and returning to the limestone temple, he waved his hand and extinguished the green lamp. Suddenly, a sense of gratitude flashed through his heart:</p><p>“That fellow Daoist only lost an incarnation of the Netherworld. He’s much better than me.”</p><p>An incarnation that could maintain contact and control after entering the remnant Pure Land of Buddha and the ‘Origin of life and Death’was not easy to refine!</p><p>..</p><p>In the real world, inside the hollow jade temple of Kunlun Mountain.</p><p>As his split consciousness dissipated, Meng Qi, who was sitting cross-legged on the cloud bed, suddenly opened his eyes, dispersing the darkness in the room and restoring it to its original clarity.</p><p>At the same time, he stretched out his hands and connected them to the profound seal technique. The various embryonic forms in his body revolved and gradually split into yin and yang. A black and a white light burst out from each of his palms.</p><p>The light condensed and changed with the seal technique. It twisted and stretched into an ancient black and white mirror. It was the manifestation of the yin and Yang Seal of the origin nine seals!</p><p>After refining the Netherworld’s skeleton at the origin of Life and Death and comprehending the basics of the Dao of life and death, Meng Qi naturally had to seize every second to turn what he had obtained into his own martial arts, the Yin and Yang Seal was a seal technique that contained the concepts of life and death, firmness and softness. From the red sperm yin and yang mirror, it could be seen that one side reflected the death of a person while the other reflected the life of a person.</p><p>The black-and-white mirror was not stable. Under the stimulation of Meng Qi’s seal and the black-and-white Rainbow Light, the front and back of the mirror started to squirm. Strange symbols appeared one after another and gradually condensed into vague dao patterns.</p><p>These dao patterns fell one after another and seemed to turn into an inscription pattern of the ancient mirror, which made the surface of the mirror more profound.</p><p>In the end, Meng Qi put his palms together and pressed all the black-and-white Rainbow Light and the ancient mirror together!</p><p>He released his hands and the ancient mirror flew out. It seemed to be both real and fake. One side was pure and pure, and it reflected the “Will of life”. The other side was dark and cold, and it shone into the “Marrow of death”, it was already different from the “Yin-yang mirror”of the red sperm, but it was slightly less mysterious.</p><p>The ancient mirror disappeared and returned to his dharma body. Meng Qi’s expression became relaxed, and he was quite pleased with himself.</p><p>Leaving the wheel of life and death at the origin of life and death was his final plan. If true martial emperor were to completely awaken, then there would be hope for the other shore. He would definitely not be interested in it and would not be afraid of it being taken away. On the other hand.., the Wheel of life and death could record the changes in the surroundings, allowing him to have a glimpse of the secret of true martial arts when he obtained it again. On the other hand, what happened there was something that even the big figures on the other shore could not see directly, it was not a problem to hide it from Emperor Fengdu. Hiding the wheel of life and death of the heavens there could be used as a backup plan. If the other party had evil intentions, it would definitely be useful at the crucial moment.</p><p>There was the true martial emperor who was in a strange state and could make a move, and Meng Qi, who had known about this in advance, had the wheel of life and death of the heavens hidden in the abstract meaning of the origin of life and death. Meng Qi had more confidence in the matter of Emperor Fengdu, even if he was not as strong as his opponent, he still had a certain chance of winning. No matter how strong he was, could he be stronger than Emperor Zhenwu, who could slash out an earth-shaking sword? Could he guard against the wheel of life and death, which could trigger the resonance of the origin?</p><p>Of course, Emperor Fengdu was powerful, and his strength was unfathomable. Meng Qi did not dare to underestimate him. He could only try his best to prepare and raise his hope.</p><p>At the same time, leaving the wheel of life and death in the origin was equivalent to establishing a dao mark that would not be worn away. He no longer needed to reverse the river of the Netherworld to open the origin. As long as he had enough power.., by relying on the cause of all the fruits, he could directly activate it and reappear in the entrance whirlpool. When little sang finished her seclusion, she must have refined the innate virtue. Legend had it that there was hope. In order to prevent the gold emperor from finding out, he hid this matter to ensure that.., there was no more suitable choice than self-verification in the origin of life and death!</p><p>The reason why she wanted to refine a treasured wheel instead of the sword of absolute saber that she lacked was because the materials used to refine the peerless item had a certain spirituality and had several forms that were most suitable for it. She could only choose one of them.., the true meaning of the Great Dao contained in it was the same. For example, the cauldron, ruler, Mirror, Bell, and other objects all had a certain connotation and carried the corresponding Taoist connotation. It was best not to use them recklessly. It was necessary to create the desired form, and it required an extremely strong grasp of power, at that time, it was obvious that he did not possess this point.</p><p>Secondly, the wheel of life and death of the heavens was not refined for his own battle. Other than guarding against the Fengdu Emperor, it was more for the sake of his master, Xuan Bei!</p><p>Without the connection of the Yellow Springs and the enhancement of the Dao rhythm of life and death, it was impossible for his ksitigarbha pure land to suddenly expand into the netherworld, allowing him to peek into the secrets of the other shore. That was why he left the wheel of life and death at its origin, it was also to deceive the heavens and cross the sea, waiting for the chance that the secret would give to his master.</p><p>As an arhat who had attained the golden body of Ksitigarbha in Buddhism, it was obviously more suitable for him to hold a treasure wheel than a sword. It was closer to compassion and the desire to cross the hell.</p><p>With just a thought, Meng Qi pressed the matter into the depths of his heart lake, as if he had forgotten about it, in case any clues were found.</p><p>At that moment, he mu and Fang Huayin had returned to the mountain and each had their own benefits. They had made further progress. Meng Qi was about to summon them over to talk about martial arts when he suddenly had an idea. He looked through the roof and looked at the sky.</p><p>A strange phenomenon appeared, and the illusory image of the immortal world appeared. The nine heavens were distinct, and the source was the direction of the sword washing pavilion.</p><p>“Senior SU has finally taken this step.”Meng Qi sighed in joy.</p><p>He had expected to prove his legend faster than himself, but now he was even behind his big brother.</p><p>After the strange phenomenon in the sky of the Immortal World, stars appeared in the sky. They were bright and dense, but they only occupied part of the night sky. Then, a brilliant and cold sword light rose from the west, connecting them all, it formed a brilliant galaxy. The ‘water waves’of the galaxy rippled, giving off an illusory feeling. It was like a long river of time flowing quietly.</p><p>‘The phenomenon of the ‘sword traversing the galaxy’… senior su not only has a certain understanding of the supreme heavenly mirror, but also of the Donghuang Bell…’Meng Qi muttered to himself. When the ‘Sea of stars’appeared and disappeared like it was free.., only then did he call he mu and Fang huayin over.</p><p>Facing the two respectful disciples, Meng Qi smiled and said,</p><p>“He Mu, I wrote a letter of congratulations. Send it to the sword-washing pavilion for me. I wish senior su to prove himself.”</p><p>As he spoke, the Purple Qi in his hand churned, and the black and white streams of light condensed into a letter of congratulations. The Divine Beasts and immortal birds interweaved on top of it, and the atmosphere was magnificent.</p><p>“Your disciple obeys your master’s orders.”He Mu took it curiously, but he couldn’t figure out what was so special about this he wen.</p><p>Looking at Fang huayin, Meng Qi nodded and said,</p><p>“Yu Banshan and Qi Jinxiu both gained something from their travels, and they didn’t disgrace Yuxu’s reputation. You let them return and officially enter the sect wall.”</p><p>Now that senior brother Guangcheng, senior sister Wen Shu, and the others were still alive, he could only Bury in the bottom of his heart the evil taste of taking in twelve disciples and giving Yuxu Twelve Golden Immortal Dao names..</p><p>Watching he mu and fang huayin leave, Meng Qi flicked the back of his left hand with his right index finger as he thought about what to do next in his cultivation.</p><p>Projecting the universe of ten thousand worlds until it was self-generated was a time-consuming process. There were no shortcuts, and it was difficult to save time. On the other hand, the matter of Emperor Fengdu might not have to wait for long..</p><p>Well, the special universe that led to the ancient well of the Hollow Jade Temple hid the secrets of the other shore, and he wondered if it could help this.</p><p>Anyway, I do not provoke the independent consciousness of the “Original projection”is..</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
