Water vapor seeped into the noses of the Taoists and chivalrous swordsmen, and inexplicable questions echoed in their ears.</p><p>Their eyes met, and they looked at each other in dismay. Each of their faces revealed a blank expression. It was the end of March in the twelfth year of Taikang. who could know or remember what special items the Emperor had received in the seventh month five years ago? Especially since nothing major had happened that year!</p><p>Meng Qi first disrupted everyone’s doubts with his unexpected rhetorical question. Then, relying on the seniority of the gathered Taoists, he made everyone present not dare to do it again. He quietly took control of the Qi field in the courtyard and thus asked about the events of September in the 7th year, however, he was not satisfied with the result. The important point where the variable took effect had been annihilated in history?</p><p>As he thought about it, he was about to continue asking questions when he heard a warm and dignified voice coming from the room. “The immortal is indeed worthy of being a sage of Taoism. He was actually able to detect the abnormality in the ninth month of the seventh year of Taikang in the midst of the chaotic situation.”</p><p>Meng Qi looked over and saw a man with a beautiful beard walking out with great strides, he said in a low voice, “Ever since father and the Grand Tutor launched an attack and killed Celestial Master Xu during the heavenly sacrifice ceremony, I have been thinking hard about one thing. Why did their strength suddenly skyrocket when they were only in the third and fourth tribulations on the surface? They passed through many obstacles and reached the realm of the sixth and seventh tribulations respectively, which led to the tragic death of Celestial Master Xu who was dominating the world.”</p><p>“After many years of investigation, combined with my father’s actions of exterminating dao and promoting Buddhism, we finally found some clues. In the first half of Taikang seven years ago, he and the grand master indeed only had the strength of three tribulations and four tribulations. But that September, a nameless monk secretly went to see my father. In December, a concubine secretly revealed that my father was already at the level of four tribulations.”</p><p>According to Meng Qi’s knowledge, the cultivation method of this universe was to temper the soul and temper the body. When one reached a certain level, they would be able to face the Lightning Tribulation. And every time they faced the lightning tribulation, their strength would increase greatly, especially when the seventh tribulation was a critical juncture, there would be a qualitative change, so this place often used several tribulations to describe the realm of an expert.</p><p>Back then, Celestial Master Xu of the Dao sect used the strength of the seven tribulations master to suppress the fate of the Dao sect, deterring all evil in the world. He was the true number one expert. With his death, the Dao sect immediately fell into decline and was suppressed, even Li Zhongkang, the third tribulation Daoist master, had almost become one of the Four Great Celestial Masters in the current dynasty. Now, it had developed into a situation where Dao and Buddhism were exterminated.</p><p>“It is indeed not easy for the ninth prince to see the abnormality of this matter.”Meng Qi nodded slightly, as if he was confirming the description of the bearded man.</p><p>So it was a nameless monk… which will it be..</p><p>The ninth king stopped ten feet in front of meng qi and said sincerely, “Master, are you sure that Father has obtained something extraordinary from that unknown monk?”</p><p>Meng Qi’s hair and beard were wet, he put his hands behind his back and smiled. “Although I have a shallow cultivation base, I won’t make a mistake in this matter. I can even be sure that this is the key to the Emperor and Grand Master’s rapid improvement in strength and their ability to hide from fellow Daoists’repeated lightning tribulations. It’s just that I haven’t been able to figure out what it is.”</p><p>“I can try to find out.”The nine kings nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>A peerless treasure that could help people advance by leaps and bounds and overcome the lightning tribulations?</p><p>The conversation between the two was heard by Li Zhongkang and the others. At first, it was as if a cloud was swirling around them, and they didn’t understand what was going on. Then, they came to a sudden realization and were shocked,</p><p>the source of the current situation was actually traced back to the seventh year of Taikang!</p><p>Originally, because Meng Qi’s footsteps were weak and he didn’t have any martial arts or magical power, they gradually became suspicious and doubtful. Perhaps it wasn’t that the other party was weak, but that he was too profound, so he returned to his original state.., they could not figure out the specific situation at all!</p><p>It was said that the reason why Daoist Master Yun Ji entered the mountain and left the world was to survive the seventh lightning tribulation and get a chance to survive..</p><p>“Thank you, ninth Prince.”Meng Qi bowed and said with a straight face, “Return to the palace city in an hour, or you will be suspected.”</p><p>The ninth prince was about to say something when his ears suddenly twitched a few times. Then, his face slightly changed, “Thank you for your reminder, Daoist master.”</p><p>With that, he led a few of his followers and strode away without the slightest hesitation.</p><p>Meng Qi turned his head and swept his gaze over Li Zhongkang and the other Daoists and chivalrous men, he said with a faint smile, “Fellow Daoists, remember to return to your own residences tonight. If you have anything important to take away, you must inform your relatives and disciples. Try to do it before the fifth hour. Also, do not approach south city after dark.”</p><p>With that, he stepped forward, bypassed the crowd, and walked straight into the room, leaving behind a sentence that reverberated in the air:</p><p>“This old Daoist will be staying here tonight.”</p><p>Everyone present was the mainstay of the current power of the Dao sect in the capital. Although they had gone through several purges and had no experts above the fourth tribulation, they had all survived at least one lightning tribulation and possessed divine abilities, Dao Arts, and a powerful physical body. If they were placed in the pugilistic world.., those people were all extravagant figures who could establish their own sects. Now, they were being ignored like this. In addition, when they heard the prophecy that the tribulation was coming, they were shocked, angry, and suspicious.</p><p>Creak. The door of the room closed. The candles were lit and illuminated the windows, reflecting Meng Qi’s figure that was writing with a brush.</p><p>The first to recognize Yun Ji’s identity, Bi Chongde Bi, stroked his grizzled beard and took a step forward. “Senior Yun Ji, what did you mean by what you said just now?”</p><p>“It’s too late now. I’ll ask again tomorrow morning.”An old and indifferent voice came out. He did not emphasize his tone, but everyone could feel his determination.</p><p>Pretending to be mysterious, bluffing… Li Zhongkang could not help but curse in his heart. He circulated his spiritual sense and asked his other companions,</p><p>“Something seems to have gone wrong with Yun Ji. The aura of the Lightning Tribulation is gone, and the body refinement of martial arts does not exist. I’m afraid what he said can’t be accurate.”</p><p>“Who cares? It’s better to believe it than not to believe it.””Don’t you see that the ninth Prince also believes in senior Yunji?”The answers were different, but they were all the same. Li Zhongkang thought for a while, he also felt that it was better to believe it.</p><p>Therefore, everyone split up and rushed back to their respective families. They secretly took away their important relatives and disciples, took away important items, and hid in the safest place they thought they were.</p><p>Li Zhongkang hid in a private room of a brothel. He changed into an ordinary person’s outfit, and under the escort of a few disciples and capable subordinates, he looked out at the night scenery of the capital.</p><p>Just after five in the morning, the place where the heaven concealing temple was located suddenly burst into flames, and sounds of fighting and killing could be heard. Not only that, all the secret or not-secret Taoist temples in the south of the city were set on fire. Black smoke billowed, and the sound shook the clouds, apparently, an intense battle was going on.</p><p>“To be able to attack so many places at the same time, he must have prepared for a long time. If he is still in the south of the city after dark, it is very likely that he will be targeted…”Li Zhongkang muttered to himself, and cold sweat broke out on his forehead, the seemingly weak spiritual master Yunji could actually foresee this. After experiencing three lightning tribulations, he, who had cultivated the “Nine transformations of Tianshu”, could not see any danger.</p><p>“Could it be that he has really returned to his original state, and is even better than Celestial Master Xu?”Li Zhongkang was actually a little scared.</p><p>At this time.., his capable subordinate Wei Ji heard him and said, “Zhenren, don’t worry. This matter may not be straight from the mouth. Perhaps he has planted a spy by the emperor’s side or the master’s side, so he can know this important news in advance. He can use this to scare Zhenren and the rest of you so that he can lead the matters of Haotian Taoism.”</p><p>“That makes sense.”Li Zhongkang nodded heavily, “I am a three Calamity Zhenren, and I have mastered great magic. Even if there are times when I can not see clearly the depth of an expert, I will not even be wrong about whether I have martial arts or whether I have the aura of thunder tribulation. HMPH, Wei Ji, follow me to spy on the gathering of clouds and see what exactly he is up to.”</p><p>He waved his sleeve, and a breeze swirled around him and Wei Ji, disappearing from the private room.</p><p>After a long journey, the two of them returned to the courtyard during the day. As soon as they reached the wall, they saw that the lights in the room were still on. Meng Qi’s figure was holding a thin book, and he was reading it attentively.</p><p>“Master, look. Even if it’s a collection of documents that record confidential information, he’s old and doesn’t have any supernatural powers. It’s easy to forget him. Why Don’t you write it down and review it from time to time?”Wei Ji guessed with some joy.</p><p>Li Zhongkang took a deep breath and said, “Wei Ji, I’ll give you a Taoist skill. You find an opportunity to steal that book.”</p><p>Wei Ji was best at spying and stealing.</p><p>“Yes, your subordinate.”Wei Ji’s body slid down the wall silently. Before he reached the bottom, he was covered by Li Zhongkang’s Taoist skill and disappeared.</p><p>The two of them were patient. After waiting for two hours, Meng Qi put down the book, blew out the light, and returned to his bed to meditate.</p><p>The wind blew, causing the window frame to make a soft sound. Using the noise as a cover, Wei Ji lifted the window bolt, and with a flick of his right hand, as if a rope had materialized, he silently grabbed the book.</p><p>Retreating over the wall, Wei Ji came before Li Zhong Kang under the tree, and respectfully handed the book over:</p><p>“Zhenren’s eyesight is accurate. That crowd is so old and muddle-headed, they didn’t even notice that I stole the book!”</p><p>Li Zhongkang revealed a smile and nodded his head as if he was praising him. Then, he brought the book closer to his eyes and saw that there were four big words written on the cover:</p><p>“Biography of Li Zhongkang!”</p><p>This… Li Zhongkang was inexplicably frightened. He instinctively opened the book and read it:</p><p>“Li Zhongkang, a native of Wei County in the capital. He was born in the 6th year of the 6th lunar month, the 5th day of the 5th lunar month, the 5th day of the 5th lunar month…”</p><p>Just as he read this, Li Zhongkang’s eyebrows jumped. This was actually his real birth date. Because of his father’s oversight, he was born earlier than he was on the surface. At first, even he didn’t know about this matter, it was not until he succeeded in the great art and reflected on himself that he discovered the problem. He had been keeping it a secret to guard against other people’s curses, but who knew that it was clearly written here.</p><p>As he read on, the whole story of this matter was explained in detail. There was no difference at all. As he flipped through the pages, Li Zhongkang felt as if he had experienced his own life again. Many vague and forgotten memories resurfaced, some of the mysteries that he did not understand the specific situation were also explained.</p><p>It was actually explained!</p><p>As he watched, his hands trembled, and sweat dripped down like raindrops.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
