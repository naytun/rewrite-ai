It was as if he had arrived in the wilderness from the battle chamber. Moreover, the sky was clear and the Bodhi stalks were flowing with clear spring water. The Brahma did not wither, exuding an unspeakable peace and tranquility, his entire body and mind seemed to have been sublimated.</p><p>However, there were no living beings in this place. Silence pervaded the air, and it was eternal and unchanging. It was as if it was the final destination after death.</p><p>The Netherworld could generate its own goodwill. There were so few evil demons, evil gods, and vengeful spirits that were willing to lay down their blades that it was truly negligible. Moreover, once they appeared and stepped into this pure land, they would definitely be sensed by Buddha Tathagata and brought to the Spirit Mountain, when he entered destruction and attained the DAO, Ananda betrayed Buddha and fell into disarray. This vein was unable to take care of itself, so this place was abandoned.</p><p>Meng Qi and the asura primogenitor stood side by side and looked into the distance of the Pure Land. They saw that Xu Mi was tall and majestic, so they smiled slightly, he said casually, “It’s normal for the reincarnation of the Netherworld to be discovered, but I don’t understand how the discoverer knew that he was going to the origin of life and death? Why would the reincarnation of the Netherworld talk about such a secret to everyone? “If we take down the reincarnation of the Netherworld and interrogate him with divine abilities and secret techniques, how will we let him escape?”</p><p>The eyes of the asura primogenitor became more and more cloudy. He narrowed his eyes and said, “Since you’ve seen this, why did you still come in?”</p><p>Meng Qi chuckled. “It’s just a netherworld body. What’s there to be afraid of If I lose it?”</p><p>“To me, there’s nothing I can’t lose. Therefore, I took advantage of the situation to seek a way out,”the asura primogenitor said indifferently.</p><p>After a few short sentences, the two of them didn’t say anything more. They strode forward and arrived at the top of Mount Meru in a few breaths.</p><p>A figure stood at the top of Mount Meru with his back facing the two of them. He was clad in a black robe and had an extraordinary bearing.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist is indeed here.”Meng Qi sighed with emotion.</p><p>This person was the reincarnation of Netherworld. He was waiting here as if he had been waiting for thousands of reincarnations.</p><p>Netherworld slowly turned around, revealing a delicate human face. He was no longer an evil god, so it was time to call him.</p><p>His all-black and all-white eyes swept past the asura primogenitor and fixed on Meng Qi. He asked with a faint smile, “Fellow Daoist, do you know why I didn’t return to the Netherworld to retrieve the remains I Left Behind?”</p><p>He had clearly left behind a method of control, intending to use the original remains to refine a peerless divine weapon after his reincarnation. In the end, he did not return, allowing his remains to fall into the hands of the life and death sect. In the end, Meng Qi was the one who benefited.</p><p>“Fellow Daoist, you have many secrets. How could I have guessed it? However, it’s nothing more than a mistake or a trap,”Meng Qi answered leisurely. He did not feel like he had fallen into a trap at all.</p><p>Netherworld shook his head and laughed, “Indeed. At that time, I relied on the reincarnation of the origin of life and death in order to escape the shackles of the innate gods. In the end, I had a ‘dream for ten thousand lifetimes’. When I regained my memories, it was already close to the end of the calamity. The bones had long fallen into the hands of others, and I, Devil Buddha, and Emperor Fengdu were searching for them. I had no choice but to hide.”</p><p>The Asura primogenitor suddenly interjected and said in a deep and hoarse voice, “From what you said, you have also entered the origin of life and Death?”</p><p>If that was not the case, why did you use the origin of life and death to reincarnate? Even the Devil Buddha could not find any clues!</p><p>Yellow spring laughed, and his eyes seemed to turn blood-yellow, he said in an ancient tone, “I was born from the river of yellow spring and was one with it. However, I did not know the existence of the origin of life and death, nor did I know its secrets. When Zhenwu used me as a guide to reverse the river of yellow spring and found the origin of life and death, if you were me, would you be able to resist stepping into it? “This is a solution to my own confusion. It might also be my only chance to reach the other shore!”</p><p>Upon hearing this, Meng Qi’s gaze turned cold and waves rose in his heart.</p><p>The river of the netherworld had entered the “Origin of life and death”and then left from there to carry out reincarnation. What about true martial emperor? Had he left? If he had left, where would he be now?</p><p>The Asura primogenitor sighed. “I can’t help it…”</p><p>Not only could he not help it, but he would also try to be first!</p><p>At this point, he really could not help it. He asked straightforwardly, “Where is the origin of life and death? What secret is it hiding?”</p><p>Netherworld said with a solemn expression, “All living beings know that the origin began to create the heaven and earth. There are all kinds of worlds and all kinds of mysteries. This description is not wrong, but it lacks a prefix and a sentence. That is: adhering to the Dao, the origin began to create the heaven and Earth!”</p><p>“What is the ‘Dao’? “The root of law, the mother of reason, and the source of virtue are things that we have been searching for for all eternity. They can not be spoken of or described. The dao is forcefully remembered. Heaven and Earth inherited the birth of it, and all things evolved from it. When they evolved, they had their roots. Therefore, there are some special things in the universe that are very close to the Great Dao. They are known as ‘places that are close to the Dao’</p><p>“Even the primordial Lord of Heaven, the creator of this world, was unable to grasp the mysteries of these locations in the beginning.”</p><p>The Asura primogenitor said in a deep voice, “The origin of life and death is a ‘shortcut’?”</p><p>Before Netherworld could reply, Meng Qi, who was beside him, suddenly spoke coldly:</p><p>“Even the primordial Lord of Heaven was unable to grasp it in the beginning. In other words, he managed to grasp it in the end?”</p><p>This was the most thought-provoking part of what Netherworld had said earlier!</p><p>Netherworld smiled and said, “If I don’t master it, how can I condense the embryonic form of the Dao Fruit?”</p><p>He did not continue, instead, he said, “The origin of life and death is a ‘place to get close to the Dao’. It was the same in the Netherworld Sea and the highest level of the nine heavens. There are only a few similar places. However, the ‘places to get close to the Dao’are only close to a certain aspect of the Great Dao. Each of them is biased, like a blind man touching an elephant. On this point, the highest level of the nine heavens is relatively more complete.”</p><p>Was this the secret of the highest level of the Nine Heavens? Meng Qi did not expect to hear so many secrets during this trip. His thoughts churned, and something seemed to be about to take shape.</p><p>Mastering these secrets, condensing the embryonic form of the dao fruit… the battle for the highest level of the nine heavens… Buddha had once measured the nine underworld… all the forces wanted to control the heavenly court and establish the underworld..</p><p>All these things bubbled and boiled together.</p><p>Just as Netherworld was about to continue, Meng Qi’s voice suddenly rang in his ears:</p><p>“Grasping all the mysteries and mysteries of the myriad realms in the heavens is the prerequisite for condensing the embryonic form of the Dao Fruit?”</p><p>Both Netherworld and the asura primogenitor were stunned. The former was stunned, while the latter did not understand the connection.</p><p>Very soon.., netherworld chuckled and said, “Isn’t it obvious? “By adhering to the DAO, there are now ten thousand worlds in the heavens. Although they belong to the acquired realm, the more perfect one’s grasp of it is, the closer one will be to the mysteries of the innate Great Dao. For example, when one does something, the more information one has, the closer one will be to the truth. On the other hand, the more mysteries one has of the ten thousand worlds in the heavens, the more perfect the true world in the body of the big figure on the other side will be. Gradually, it will become another ‘ten thousand worlds in the Heavens’, until there is no difference anymore. In the past and future, the immortal realm and the nine remoteness are all under one’s control. They are close to the Great Dao, forming the embryonic form of the dao fruit</p><p>“At this stage, we can talk about getting rid of all kinds of things that are acquired. We can reduce and seek emptiness, and let the dao fruit take shape completely.”</p><p>It turned out that this was the secret of the other shore. After crossing the sea of bitterness, half of the dao fruit that was produced was the condensation of the dao that belonged to oneself. It was a true and indescribable aspect of the ‘Dao’, and it was biased, it was just a part of the harvest of the blind touching the elephant. After that, they had to see through the heaven and earth, measure the nine Serenities of the immortal world, grasp the past and the future, and understand all the mysteries of the myriad worlds in the heavens and all aspects of the ‘Dao’, only then would there be the embryonic form of the dao fruit.</p><p>To use the simplest and insufficiently accurate description, it was the process of going from a few Great Dao to three thousand Great Dao in order to seek the true ‘Dao’.</p><p>However, there was definitely something that Netherworld did not explain clearly or that he did not understand. Otherwise, why would the bigwigs on the other side fight over it? The Mysteries and principles were there, and anyone could comprehend them. The Netherworld and the Heavenly Court also took turns to control it!</p><p>“I didn’t expect that fellow Daoist would know the secrets of the other side.”After Huang Quan finished speaking and was silent for a long time, the asura primogenitor said.</p><p>Huang Quan smiled and said, “I only heard it from Zhen Wu. I don’t really understand it myself.”</p><p>At the mention of Zhen Wu, Meng Qi immediately asked, “Is Zhen Wu the Great Emperor still in the origin of life and Death?”</p><p>“Heh, he’s too greedy. He went too far and was almost assimilated by the Great Dao. He’s in a strange state where he can’t Live or Die.”Huang Quan suddenly smiled mysteriously, “When I return to the starting point and carry him out, I will be able to merge with his body in this state and take the most important step</p><p>“With my current strength, I am unable to turn Netherworld upside down. I must ask the two fellow Daoists for ‘help’.”</p><p>His eyes were full of malicious intent. The long conversation seemed to be waiting for the preparations to be done!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
