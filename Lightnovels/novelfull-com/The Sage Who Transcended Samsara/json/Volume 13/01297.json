The ancient Buddha of burning lamp used his identity as a high-ranking official in the hollow jade temple to help the Devil Buddha complete the infiltration and arrangement!</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi seemed to be moved, but in fact, all kinds of thoughts had long been dismissed or suppressed. His heart was like a clear mirror, reflecting thousands of things. Once he saw an opportunity, he would immediately make a move and open the situation with a thunderous momentum, create an opportunity to escape!</p><p>The ancient Buddha with the lamp burning, who had reached the perfection of destiny for countless years and was only short of all the causes and effects to reach the other shore, stood at the peak of the great divine arts practitioners. He was not someone that he could contend against as he had just entered the destiny realm. More importantly.., he had also joined hands with the Devil Buddha Ananda. Even though this old man was suppressed in the Spirit Mountain and could only reveal a little feeling at the moment, he definitely could not be looked down upon. In addition, the nine heavens mystical maiden Liu Luo was waiting here in advance, speaking with confidence and confidence about secrets, it was unknown whether he was a friend or an enemy. Under such a situation, no matter how experienced he was, he did not dare to be arrogant.</p><p>The golden body of the burning lamp ancient Buddha was transparent, and the light of wisdom flowed. He stood there quietly, neither empty nor empty, neither thinking nor thinking. It was actually difficult for Meng Qi to lock onto him, not to mention that he saw an opportunity to attack. His heart could not help but sink slightly, the more he thought about it, the more he realized the shock contained in the words that burning lamp had deliberately said just now.</p><p>As the cause of all karma, the subtle connection between him and the Devil Buddha Ananda was two-way. Burning lamp actually used this to trace it back. Only when he got closer did he realize the difference in the path of karma between the two. Even though the “Cause of all karma”was powerful.., there was a bit of mystical power on the other shore, but it was still lacking in the accumulation of time. The foundation of eternal enlightenment was shallow!</p><p>Burning Lamp’s face always had a kind smile on it, as if he had ignored Meng Qi, the enemy of the “Fight for the Great Dao, fight to the death.” His gaze turned to the mystical maiden of the nine heavens. “NAMWU Amitabha. Almsgiver su is fated to be with our Buddhist sect. I will pass it on. Please don’t interfere, Tanyue.”</p><p>The mystical maiden of the nine heavens’elegant and beautiful face did not show the slightest bit of surprise. She smiled and said, “The ancient Buddha is not the celestial emperor, nor is he the human emperor. Do I obey your orders or not?”</p><p>Her words seemed to imply that she had to use a reason to convince me instead of forcefully pressuring others.</p><p>Meng Qi did not interrupt. He continued to circulate the cause and effect of all the karma. His thoughts kept colliding with each other as he performed the divine calculation of the hollow jade, waiting for an opportunity to strike.</p><p>The ancient Buddha spoke in a serene manner, “Almsgiver su is one of those who will face the tribulation. If you can’t transcend him this time, there might not be a next chance. Could it be that Tan wants to watch him transcend the sea of bitterness and ascend to the other shore, becoming another original incipient heavenly venerate? When that time comes, his Boundless Dao of Chaos will be perfected. Even if the heavenly emperor really has the chance to resurrect and return, it would be difficult for him to contend against him.”</p><p>Liu Luo’s expression changed slightly:</p><p>“What are you talking about?”</p><p>The ancient Buddha lit up the lamp smiled with a zen-like expression:</p><p>“The Heavenly Court fell, the immortal realm was destroyed, and the era has yet to end. Other than the heavenly emperor who did not die completely, I really can’t think of a second reason. I believe that every important figure is very clear on this point. It’s just that at that time, each of them had their own arrangements that were not properly arranged, which was why they tacitly delayed the calamity until now.”</p><p>“At that time, star Lord Zi Wei and Yuan Lord Dou mu both fell, while the Nine Heavens Thunder God had the protection of Buddha. The few of you relied on the protection of the heavenly emperor to survive and hide in the ancient starry space. Only after the Human Emperor Longtai forged the sword did you return one after another. In the end, you helped him jump out of the chessboard and became the other shore. Is there no hidden reason behind this?”</p><p>He actually talked about such a great secret like an ancient well without any ripples!</p><p>Liu Luo’s expression had long since returned to normal, he chuckled and said, “The immortal realm has yet to be completely destroyed. Could This not be the second reason why the era has yet to end? “If the Heavenly Emperor really has a backup plan for us, I’m afraid that the important figures would have already come to our door and controlled us in their hands. As for whether sect master Su will be unable to control his power in the future and jump out of the chessboard, I don’t care at the moment. This is because if you, ancient Buddha, succeed and extract the ’cause of all the fruits’, I’m afraid that you will become an ancestor on the spot and ascend to the other shore!”</p><p>“One is an illusory and unpredictable thing, and the other is a terrifying thing that can be witnessed immediately. Ancient Buddha, what do you think I should do?”</p><p>As she spoke, a light flashed in her hand, and a fire-colored immortal sword appeared. There were three vague dao patterns on it:</p><p>“Crimson Emperor Sword!”</p><p>This was not a divine weapon passed down from generation to generation from the goddess of the goddess of the goddess of the goddess of the goddess of the goddess of the goddess of the goddess of the goddess of the goddess of the nine heavens. It was said that it was the body of a powerful god who was not much weaker than the heavenly emperor of the goddess of the goddess of the goddess of the goddess of the goddess of the nine heavens, as for the twists and turns of the story, no one knew.</p><p>The ancient Buddha lit up the lamp with a solemn expression. He chanted a Buddhist proclamation in a low voice and said, “Namwu Amitabha Buddha, since Tan Yue has helped the External Dao, don’t blame me, Vajra, for glaring at you.”</p><p>The twenty-four perfect Buddhist lights above his head shone brightly. They were shaped like bright moons one after another. A figure was protruding from them. He had a bright body and wore a Daoist robe. His face was ancient and strange. He had the demeanor of an immortal. He held the exquisite Golden Pagoda in one hand, he held the jade-colored universal ruler in one hand and said with a smile,</p><p>“Old Daoist Rong will meet my old friend.”</p><p>This was the “Body of the old Daoist”that was created after burning the lamp and entering Buddhism. It was similar to the “Relic of the past”condensed by Maitreya, and it was even better.</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi suddenly spoke:</p><p>“Back then, when teacher began to ‘reduce and seek emptiness’, he clearly said that ‘the cause of all the consequences’was not something you had. This made you hold a grudge and hence, you entered Buddhism. However, didn’t you think that teacher has always been protective of your shortcomings? If you could bear it, wouldn’t he have left it for you and found someone else instead?”</p><p>“You have been cultivating for thousands of years. Haven’t you figured out the real problem with yourself yet?”</p><p>His voice was as loud as thunder. Combining his yuan heart, it pierced straight into the heart of the burning lamp!</p><p>The first part of the burning lamp joining Buddhism was the public case that Meng Qi had heard from his senior brothers and sisters, such as Guangchengzi. The second part, the thoughts of the primeval Lord of Heaven, and the possible problems with the burning lamp, were all his conjectures. At the critical moment, he asked about the thing that the burning lamp was most concerned about, he wanted to disrupt his perfect Buddhist heart and create an opportunity for him to strike first!</p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, a domineering and brilliant purple saber appeared in Meng Qi’s right hand. Its sharp light pierced through the layers of void.</p><p>However, the ancient Buddha of burning the lamp was as peaceful as ever. He smiled and said,</p><p>“No matter what the problem is, once I take you down, everything will be clear!”</p><p>His heart was as if it was empty. It did not move at all!</p><p>The twenty-four perfect Buddhist lights behind the Golden Buddha’s head immediately flew out six rounds, turning into transparent beads that rolled around, emitting five-colored lights. They were the sea-pacifying divine beads.</p><p>After the Battle of ascension to godhood, the twenty-four sea-pacifying beads fell on the body of burning lamp. Later, because he wanted to build the thirty-third heaven, after he stepped into the realm of perfect creation, he contributed them. When the Heavenly Court fell, the heavens collapsed, he took back a few more.</p><p>The six pearls that emitted five-colored rays of light were blurry in space and time, as if they had turned into a six-sided heaven and earth. Some acted out the mortal world, some galloped wild beasts, some danced with Heaven and man, and at times saw the five decays, and some asuras flocked together, the battles went on endlessly. Some were hungry ghosts with big bellies, and their necks were like thin threads, full of pain. Some had dense yin qi, heavy ghost flames, and scenes like the frying pan and millstone that revealed the horror after death, burning lamp had actually refined his own “Six paths of reincarnation”with the six ocean-pacifying pearls!</p><p>The other Buddhist lights flourished and connected into one, highlighting the pure land that spanned across billions of tribulations. The ancient glass lamp rose, emitting a calm and penetrating black-and-white flowing light that shone on Meng Qi’s body.</p><p>Faced with Meng Qi’s heaven-splitting earth-splitting blade, burning lamp’s ancient Buddha was as unmoving as a mountain. He pointed with his finger and solemnly said,</p><p>“You shall enter the Dao of the human world!”</p><p>The black and white flowing light was empty and hazy. The cause and effect were pulled together. The six sea-pacifying pearls slowly rotated, and Meng Qi’s forward blade light immediately dissipated. He felt that the illusory great dao that he had condensed was tainted by the mortal world, and his dharmic body was gradually turning into a mortal, it seemed that it would not be long before he became a mortal and was at the mercy of others.</p><p>Was this the terror of the Dao of Karma that was only one step away from bearing illusory dao fruits?</p><p>Meng Qi used his absolute blade to suppress his body. The clouds above his head flew out. The chaos was like a tide, setting off a glass lamp that could not be described with color. It was similar to the one behind the lamp, but it lacked the ancient meaning, it had a transcendent charm.</p><p>While doing his best to resist the transformation of the mortal, he pointed his finger and said solemnly,</p><p>“If the cause of all the fruits changes, everything will follow!”</p><p>As the initial cause, once it changed, the subsequent fruits would definitely respond to the changes!</p><p>This was the power of the divine ability after the cause of all the fruits entered the creation realm!</p><p>As soon as Meng Qi finished speaking, the golden body of the ancient Buddha with the burning lamp had a few more spots. Bits of glass fragments floated down, like fake and inferior things that had been brushed up, even the “Past Taoist body”that he fought with the mystical maiden of the nine heavens was tainted with a murky feeling.</p><p>He was affected by the “Cause of all karma”and began to transform into a mortal!</p><p>When he was also a mortal and faced with the burning lamp that was born with tyrannical power, he would be able to gain the absolute advantage with his rich experience!</p><p>Their immortal wills faded, and the golden body’s skin slowly lost its luster. Meng Qi and the ancient Buddha fell into a tug-of-war on the path of karma. Although he was at a disadvantage, he did not show any signs of suffering.</p><p>Even if they failed, they could drag them down with them!</p><p>Suddenly, a small dark seal flew out from behind the ancient Buddha’s head. It was filled with a mysterious and tyrannical state. With a slight rotation, it accelerated the evolution of the six paths of reincarnation formed by the sea-calming pearl.</p><p>Reincarnation seal!</p><p>The Devil Buddha’s reincarnation seal!</p><p>Meng Qi’s speed of transforming into a mortal suddenly increased, but the ancient Buddha still maintained the same changes as before!</p><p>Just as Meng Qi was about to transform into the three pure ones and start fighting with all his might, the mystical maiden of the nine heavens suddenly smiled faintly:</p><p>“Ancient Buddha, do you know the reason why I lit up the lamps here?”</p><p>It was definitely not a simple illumination!</p><p>The ancient Buddha’s heart skipped a beat as he turned his gaze towards the depths of the void. Then, he saw numerous resplendent and terrifying ancient stars approaching from afar and forming into a dou shape. That was the “Big Dipper”that had once been born in the immortal realm!</p><p>At this moment, the Big Dipper was like a carriage that was speeding over without a coachman. Pure white light rose from the ‘carriage’and formed a boundless divine canopy.</p><p>The canopy drooped down rays of light that were as ethereal as water, allowing a figure to be vaguely seen within. An extremely powerful aura swept in all directions, causing even the ancient Buddha to tremble slightly as he recalled a familiar scene:</p><p>The Heavenly Emperor was on a tour!</p><p>This was the Heavenly Emperor’s Tour!</p><p>The nine dragons were pulling the carriage, the Big Dipper was driving, the star Lord was driving the carriage, and the Heavenly Emperor was on a tour!</p><p>At this moment, there were no nine dragons pulling the carriage, nor was there a star Lord driving the carriage. It was just that the ‘Big Dipper’was speeding over. The canopy was high up, and it seemed like it was really carrying a figure. It was lonely, aloof, powerful, and mysterious.</p><p>Liu Luo’s smile disappeared as he solemnly said,</p><p>“Isn’t the ancient Buddha the heaven-seeking Emperor’s trump card? Isn’t this it! ?”</p><p>For the first time, the expression of the ancient Buddha with the lamp burning changed. The Big Dipper was approaching, and he did not hesitate to give up on Meng Qi without thinking. He fled in the opposite direction with the ‘body of the past Dao sect’.., the reincarnation seal also drilled into the void and disappeared without a trace.</p><p>Seeing this, Liu Luo immediately transmitted his voice to Meng Qi:</p><p>“Let’s Go! We can’t make it in time!”</p><p>Was this fake? Meng Qi looked at the lonely “Big Dipper carriage”that was cruising through the void in astonishment, and looked at the figure that was pressing down on his entire life.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
