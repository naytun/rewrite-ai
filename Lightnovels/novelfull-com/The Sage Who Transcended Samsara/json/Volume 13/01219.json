Meng Qi retracted his spiritual sense, his heart heavy as thoughts flooded his mind:</p><p>“It seems like the founder of the Void Mountain sect was studying the mark of the fallen shore, which caused such a change…”</p><p>“Which important figure saw that his research was successful and was about to reach the other shore, and chose to kill him? Or was there a terrifying secret hidden within the mark, and once he touched it, it would immediately backfire?”</p><p>If it was the former, it could only be said that heaven’s will was hard to predict. The thoughts of the important figures on the other shore were truly impossible to fathom. This was because the six outer dao divisions each had their own paths, and their hearts were only focused on their own research. They had never stirred up trouble or involved themselves in the various things of the outside world, even if such a figure crossed the sea of bitterness and entered the other shore, it would not affect the plans and struggles of the other important figures. There was absolutely no need to stop him from killing him. If it was the latter, just thinking about it made Meng Qi’s hair stand on end, this was because the imprint left behind by the fallen other shore contained secrets that always made people imagine.</p><p>Was it a supreme secret that could cause the other shore to fall, or was it that among those important figures who had died for hundreds of thousands of years or even several epochs, there was one who had not really fallen? He had crossed the sea with his death, concealed himself behind the scenes, and watched the world, waiting for an opportunity that others could not predict?</p><p>After pondering for a long time, Meng Qi’s eyes returned to normal, as if he had never seen the scene in front of him. After reading the incomplete jade slip, he waved his left hand and opened his sleeve, changing the world and reshaping the universe, he put everything in the ruins into the original position.</p><p>When encountering such a thing, of course, he had to explain it to void mountain to avoid unnecessary misunderstandings. The “River of Destiny”surrounded this place, so the other party definitely could not come in. Either he brought people in.., or he could move the entire scene out.</p><p>In order to avoid the trouble of going back and forth, Meng Qi chose the latter. After all, every time he crossed the ‘River of predestination’, he would feel as if he had reached his limit.</p><p>And the purpose of this trip and the various future possibilities that he wanted to obtain seemed to be that he had failed because he had not fought.</p><p>He repeated the same trick and crossed the long river again. Before he even approached the ‘wall of Stop’, he saw Yue Ziqing, the middle-aged scholar, and the black-clothed old woman.</p><p>When they saw Meng Qi coming out of the river of predestination, their eyes were fixed on him. It was as if the Sun was burning in the depths of their eyes, and it was abnormally bright. The middle-aged scholar said in an agitated tone, “Sect leader Su, how did you cross the river of predestination?”</p><p>“Sect leader Su, how did you cross the river of predestination?”The middle-aged scholar asked</p><p>The other questions were not in his mind at all. They were not in their eyes.</p><p>“May I ask who you are, fellow Daoist?”Meng Qi smiled faintly.</p><p>Only then did the middle-aged scholar realize that he had yet to introduce himself. He hurriedly said, “I am the current sect leader of the Void Ending Mountain, Mo Fei. This is grand elder Huang Yao… I wonder what method sect leader Su used to cross the river of predestination.”</p><p>He persisted in asking. Beside him, the black-clothed old woman Huang Yao, Yue Ziqing, and the others stared at Meng Qi with Bright Eyes as they waited for the answer. They did not ask for the other party’s detailed explanation and revealed the secret of their methods. They only wanted to know the general direction.</p><p>Meng Qi shook his head and smiled. “It’s just a trick. Using the Devil Buddha brand inside the absolute saber as an external ‘variable’, and relying on the karma to connect it to the river of Destiny, it can create a variable, giving birth to more futures and getting rid of the predestined fate.”</p><p>He did not hide the process because he used the divine abilities and techniques that he was familiar with. As for the Devil Buddha brand, even if the experts of Void Mountain could not think of it at the moment, they would be able to guess it in the future. Since that was the case, he might as well speak frankly.., it would be good to sell him out.</p><p>“External ‘variables’…”the middle-aged scholar, Mo Fei, the black-clothed old woman, Huang Yao, and the others muttered this term to themselves, which corresponded to their own research.</p><p>After a long time.., mo Fei finally sighed and said, “Our Void Mountain had thought of the direction of external ‘variables’a long time ago. However, due to the lack of ‘things on the other shore’and the fact that the fruit jade puppet could not withstand such a huge and complicated line of cause and effect, the research progress was very slow…”</p><p>Speaking up to this point, he realized that he seemed to be too focused on the method itself, and his words were too direct and rude, he quickly added, “Just being able to gather all these conditions is already very difficult. The control in the middle also tests one’s own ability. This goes to show sect leader Su’s ability. If I were in a different place, even if I have the cause of all the fruits and the mark of the other side, it would still be difficult for me to smoothly cross the ‘River of destiny’at the legendary realm.”</p><p>When he saw that desolate Yao, Yue Ziqing, and the others were eager to try and ask questions, Meng Qi opened his sleeve and threw out the things in the ruins, returning them to the original scene in the air.</p><p>“After I crossed the ‘River of destiny’and opened the stone door of the secret land, I saw this situation. There aren’t any future possibilities left behind by the founder of your sect…”his expression was solemn.</p><p>“Eh?””HMM?”Mo Fei, desolate Yao, Yue Ziqing, and the others were immediately surprised. They forgot to ask about the ‘River of destiny’and began to check the broken jade slips and various fragments.</p><p>Meng Qi stood with his hands behind his back and looked at them quietly. He did not say anything and waited patiently.</p><p>After the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, the ten or so upper echelons of the void ending mountain sized each other up. Their gazes met and they saw each other’s solemnity, doubt, and grief.</p><p>Mo Fei took a light breath and said, “The secret land is indeed the place where the patriarch is sleeping. I didn’t expect such a strange change to happen. Even the patriarch has disappeared.”</p><p>He solemnly cupped his hands and said, “Thank you, sect master Su, for telling us. Otherwise, we would still be in the dark and wouldn’t know anything unusual.”</p><p>After thanking Meng Qi.., he turned his head to look at Yue Ziqing. “Ziqing, take my sect master’s token and enter the central important land. Gradually adjust the rules and balance the restrictions. Try to make this forbidden law disappear within forty-nine days, and let the ‘River of Destiny’temporarily return to illusion.”</p><p>“Yes, Master.”Yue Ziqing answered without hesitation and left as ordered.</p><p>There was an emergency arrangement in the Void Mountain to pass through the ‘River of Destiny’in order to wake up the founder of the sect at a critical moment. However, it would take at least forty-nine days to do so.</p><p>Orders were issued one after another and the elders left one after another. Could it be that they were arranging the matters in an orderly manner.</p><p>After he had finished all of this, Meng Qi opened his mouth and asked, “Are you sure that the Patriarch of your sect has only disappeared?”</p><p>This was what had caught his attention the most from Mo Fei’s reply just now.</p><p>“I don’t dare to confirm. I can only say that the patriarch’s soul lamp in the central area of the sect has not been extinguished,”Mo Fei said frankly.</p><p>The soul lamp had not been extinguished? Meng Qi was startled. This did not seem to be quite consistent with his own judgment.</p><p>That kind of situation and the information that remained indicated that the founder of the Void Mountain sect had been killed, along with his people and things, or that he had died from the backlash. Who knew that his soul lamp was still lit!</p><p>However, this was also within reason. Otherwise, the Void Mountain sect would have long discovered that there was something abnormal in the place where the founder was sleeping!</p><p>Was the founder of the Void Mountain sect not dead, mysteriously missing, or had he been moved by someone to maintain his soul lamp?</p><p>At this moment.., mo Fei said, “I’ve heard Zi Qing mention that sect master Su came to our sect to seek the future that our founder had deduced. Unfortunately, the secret land has been destroyed, and all of these have been destroyed. However, if sect master Su doesn’t mind, we may be willing to offer you many of the future that our sect has accumulated and revised over the generations.”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly and said, “I wonder if there is a clearer picture of the future of the Azure Emperor?”</p><p>At this point, it was better than nothing. He was trying to find the wuxiang sect or the evil fate sect while listening to Mo Fei’s description of the future.</p><p>Mo Fei was stunned and laughed, “The core of the conflict between elder Huang and I is Emperor Qing’s problem.”</p><p>As a legend, he could temporarily get rid of the negative emotions caused by the disappearance or death of his patriarch.</p><p>“What’s the contradiction?”Hearing this, Meng Qi cursed Yue Ziqing in his heart. If he had known this would happen, he would have first paid a visit to Mo Fei. Then, he would decide whether or not to challenge the three trials.</p><p>And Yue Ziqing obviously felt that he had the possibility of passing all the trials. That was why he concealed this matter and tried his best to encourage himself.</p><p>Mo Fei said sincerely, “In the future that I have deduced, ten years later, Emperor Qing will attain Dao in the Fusang Ancient Tree Realm and ascend to the other shore. This is a general trend that can not be changed. It is bound to develop. However, elder Huang calculated that Emperor Qing failed to attain Dao in the Fusang ancient tree realm and paid the price of the complete disappearance of Taiyi heavenly venerate and medicine master Wang Fo. In my opinion, there is a big problem with her deduction…”</p><p>As he continued, it was as if the person standing in front of him was not Meng Qi, but the black-robed old woman, desolate Yao.</p><p>Meng Qi listened quietly for a while and suddenly asked, “Sect master Mo, does this mean that regardless of whether you are right or she is right, you can confirm one thing. Will the green emperor head to the Fusang Ancient Tree Realm in the future?”</p><p>The Green Emperor had once obtained the Supreme Heavenly Mirror’s core and repaired it into a peerless item, while the fusang ancient tree was nurtured by the blood of the Donghuang Taiyi and the heavenly emperor. Did he have a deeper meaning in choosing this place to verify his dao?</p><p>“More than 99% confirmed.”Mo Fei nodded.</p><p>“That’s Great.”Meng Qi smiled slightly and turned to ask about the future development of the Zhexiu Mountain. Although when it came to him, due to the various causes and effects, it was too vague.., but it was also very helpful for him to calculate other things.</p><p>He was grateful for the favor he had done before. Mo Fei would tell him everything he knew.</p><p>An hour later, Meng Qi cupped his fists and said, “Something big has happened in your sect. I Won’t disturb you anymore.”</p><p>He had to rush to the old fusang tree and leave a message for the future Emperor Qing. He wrote something like, “Yu Xu, Su Meng has been waiting for you here for a long time.”.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
