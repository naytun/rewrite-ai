It was as if they were embedded into the world, vast and barbaric.</p><p>Nine glass approached the stone door, and a colorful feather fan appeared in her hand. It was black and yellow with black and white at the base. It was purple in color, noble and elegant. It was decorated with water colors, interweaving beautiful but not brilliant, brilliant but not piercing patterns of five virtues, it was both sacred and solemn.</p><p>This was the ‘five virtues universe fan’that the Great Demon Gods of the Heavenly Phoenix clan had shed their feathers to refine. It was even mixed with legendary materials. Although it was not peerless in the end.., it was still an outstanding existence among the heaven immortal-level divine weapons.</p><p>Peerless divine weapons and magical equipment had always been rare. Even though the Phoenix clan had been passed down from the demon saints and accumulated for generations, they had only a few of them. If Jiu Li was given one rashly, everyone knew that she must have other important tasks, she had lost the purpose of sending her here.</p><p>The patterns of the five virtues universe fan lit up one after another. Finally, it rippled with a water color and condensed into a hazy book above Jiu Li’s head. Beams of clear light hung down.</p><p>Then, Jiu Li pushed forward with her right hand and calmly triggered the heavenly blood fiend array on the gate.</p><p>Suddenly, the gate was suffused with an ancient blood color. The smell of blood filled the air, making people feel nauseous and Dizzy.</p><p>Rays of red light turned into sharp arrows and shot toward Jiu Li in all directions, like a blood cloth that covered the sky and earth.</p><p>Puff! Puff! Puff!</p><p>Before the blood swords could touch Jiu Li, they had already deviated from their original direction and pierced into the cold and dark universe, only causing ripples of water-colored light to appear.</p><p>The holy virtues could not touch anything!</p><p>At the same time, Ao Qin, Gu Yue, and the golden scale fairy stood in front of the Heaven, earth, and man. They each took out the treasures given by their elders to prevent the formation from changing, and to be on guard against the enemies that might lurk around them.</p><p>Although they were proud and arrogant, they were not without real materials. They did things very well.</p><p>It was only at this time that he mu finally saw the divine weapon in their hands clearly. Ao Qin was holding a crystal-clear ice soul long sword that was surrounded by cold air. The inside of the sword was distinct, and the edges of the sword reflected light, exuding a strange luster, it was so beautiful that it seemed like a dream, but it could also disturb the enemies’primordial spirit and True Spirit.</p><p>Gu Yue held a copper ring in each of his hands. The color of the rings was strange, as if they were covered in rust-green. The feeling of heaviness and lightness was the exact opposite of each other. Meanwhile, the golden scale fairy was surrounded by a soft whip, it was made of pieces of golden fish scales, and the water rippled from time to time. The light was tiny and dazzling.</p><p>After looking around, he mu saw that Jiu Li had completely activated the Heaven Blood Fiend Formation. The red color was like a huge wave surging in this place. Therefore, he calculated the changes in his mind and deduced the opportunity. Suddenly, he slashed out the sword of li immortal in his hand.</p><p>The red color was fire, burning hot. The green color was wood, entangling vigorously. The yellow color was earth, thick and heavy. The white metal was sharp and solid. The black color gave birth to water. It washed over continuously. The five elements sword light twisted into a bundle, accompanying each other and harmonious as one.</p><p>As Meng Qi’s successor in the way of the sword, he Mu’s sword displayed a little bit of the true meaning of heaven-cleaving and immortal-slaying to the fullest!</p><p>One sword could break the sky, and one sword could split the earth!</p><p>The sword light flourished, and the sharp aura caused ao Qin, the golden-scaled fairy, and the others to feel a piercing pain on their faces under the protection of divine weapons and magical treasures. The five colors of red, green, yellow, white, and black circulated, piercing through the blood fiend, it chopped down next to the nine-headed bird pattern on the lower left side of the cave abode’s door.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The stone door let out the sound of metal clashing, and the blood fiend suddenly shrank back. The red color turned faint, and it collapsed with a loud bang.</p><p>The restriction burst out with various colors of light that kept changing. In the end, it was difficult for it to take shape. It faded like a tide, and the door slowly opened in a heavy manner.</p><p>What a powerful sword technique… Ao Qin, Gu Yue, and the golden scale fairy were definitely not ignorant people. They could not help but sigh in their hearts.</p><p>This Yue Luo could recognize archaic characters and had such a powerful sword technique. Was it really as good and lucky as Jiu Li had said? Was it not ordinary?</p><p>Nine glass slightly nodded, slightly happy expression, seems to be very satisfied with their vision.</p><p>As the gate slowly opened, all eyes were on it again, and for a few moments the scene inside was completely exposed to them.</p><p>This is an ancient wilderness, the earth is dry and cracked, everywhere can see the gap, high in the sky is a full nine * * * * * * * * * * day in a row, red hot, hot waves rolling, dazzling.</p><p>Nine days across the sky, positive anti-evil!</p><p>“Is really the archaic scene… …”the ancient more indifferent and taciturn glanced at he mu one eye, seems to be muttering and doubting.</p><p>To this, Ao Qin was silent instead. Although he still could not see the shadow of the immemorial immortal world, the characteristics of the prehistoric years were already clear as day. Yue Luo’s interpretation of the ancient characters on the door was at least half correct, and this was already quite extraordinary, there was no direct comprehension of the legendary realm, and it was all based on his own accumulation. Not to mention that it was difficult to collect the materials, he was afraid that he would have to use the Hao Shou Qiong Jing to do it, which would delay the improvement of his strength and realm at a very low level.</p><p>However, this wasn’t reflected in Yue Luo at all..</p><p>Either he just happened to have an excellent talent in this area, or he had once obtained a related treasured scripture.</p><p>Jiu Li looked at he mu and nodded her head in approval, then, she frowned slightly and said, “The nine-headed Grand Sage’s strength and realm have exceeded our expectations. He can change the laws of the world forever with just a word. Why is he only using this ancient environment to maintain the formation that is almost immortal?”</p><p>This was also he mu’s question.</p><p>They discussed a few things, but they did not have any leads. Ao Qin did not want to waste time. He suggested that they go deeper and search for clues.</p><p>Their divine weapons and magic treasures shone with light and protected them as they passed through the door and stepped into the primordial chaos. A burning sensation assaulted their faces. Even with layers of defense, he mu still had the illusion that his hair was burnt. The power of nine days could be seen, furthermore, the higher they went, the more terrifying it became. They could ignite things directly!</p><p>In view of this, the group lowered their flight lights. They were only a few hundred feet above the ground, and they could clearly see the cracks and cracks. Some of them were even divided into canyons that were bottomless.</p><p>Suddenly, a terrifying aura shot out from the canyons, shaking the heat waves in the sky. He Mu’s primordial spirit trembled, as if it was frozen. If it wasn’t for the sword Qi that the Li Immortal Sword’s hilt sent back, stinging his soul.., he might not have been able to control the divine weapon and fall from the sky onto the ground.</p><p>The green wind that surrounded Gu Yue dissipated. The layers of waves that surrounded fairy golden scales turned into rain and fell. Ao Qin, who was in the middle of the clouds, turned pale and almost lost the ice soul sword in his hand, only Jiu Li remained unmoving under the holy water light. She was not affected, but her expression had changed.</p><p>A huge and terrifying snake extended out from the canyon. It had eight heads and eight tails, filling the air. Clouds and rain surrounded it, and its eyes were bright red. Its aura was majestic, far surpassing that of a monster king.</p><p>“An immemorial monster God that is close to the legendary realm…”Jiu Li’s voice actually had some trepidation in it.</p><p>Didn’t they say that there were only restrictions placed on monster kings?</p><p>The difference was more than a hundred or a thousand times!</p><p>Could it be that he could rely on the title of demon Saint’s descendant to intimidate others?</p><p>He Mu’s heart was also filled with shock and trepidation. Directly encountering an immemorial demon god that was close to the legendary realm simply made him have the thought of dying here today. However, in the end, he still maintained a bit of calmness in his mind. It was the harvest of so many years of experience, it was also his trust in his master.</p><p>His master would definitely not point out a path of death for him!</p><p>With his realm, his abhijna, his strength as a unique cause of all consequences, he can certainly calculate whether there is a death of his long journey!</p><p>Static life, static life wisdom, a few thoughts between ups and downs, he mu noticed a little wrong.</p><p>The eight-headed, eight-tailed, terrifying snake had bloodthirsty eyes, no intelligence, and had no hostility toward Jiu Li. It was hesitant toward itself, ao Qin, and the others, as if it wanted to bite but felt that it shouldn’t, as such, it did not attack immediately, giving itself time to think.</p><p>Wisdom was born from wisdom. He Mu had a flash of inspiration and immediately sent a voice transmission to Jiu Li:</p><p>“Envelop everyone in the Holy Water Light!”</p><p>“That Snake has no intelligence. It is acting on the instincts of a wild beast. Its senses towards the holy water light are close, but it does not wish to be enemies!”</p><p>Jiu Li did not have time to think deeply. Following he mu’s words, she spread the holy water light. The clear light rippled, covering ao Qin, the other demons, and he mu. Immediately, the snake shook its eight heads and slowly retreated into the depths of the canyon, it disappeared without a trace.</p><p>“Mr. Yueluo, your judgment is really accurate.”Jiu Li came back to her senses and praised he mu happily.</p><p>He Mu let out a long sigh. “Actually, I’m not sure either. If I have any thoughts, I’ll try. It’s like a blind cat meeting a dead mouse.”</p><p>His modest and witty words immediately attracted the laughter of Jiu Li and fairy golden scales. It also improved Ao Qin and Gu Yue’s perception of him. At the very least, at this moment, he did not have the ability to be arrogant and despise demons like himself.</p><p>“Such a powerful demon god does not have intelligence. It is clear that there is something fishy about this place. I’m afraid that the demon gods in this primordial desolate realm have not activated their intelligence. They can rely on the will of holy virtue to muddle through,”Jiu Li made a judgment, just now, she was so scared that she broke out in a cold sweat. Fortunately, the result was not bad. It was also in line with what her mother had said about the danger of demon kings.</p><p>He Mu nodded in agreement and also trusted her master. The group continued to go deeper. They did meet many powerful demon gods along the way. Some of them had nine heads, spat fire and water, and cried like babies. Some of them had human faces and horse hooves, some of them had red hair on their bodies. Some of them had strange shapes, as if they were a collection of countless wild beasts..</p><p>They had no intelligence as expected. They were not hostile to those who were enveloped by the holy morality.</p><p>After a long while, he Mu’s eyes lit up. He saw a mountain peak that towered into the clouds.</p><p>Jiu Li and the other demons had seen a divine mountain that was as big as the stars, but when they saw this mountain peak, they felt that it was unprecedentedly tall. It penetrated the heavens and reached the height of the Netherworld!</p><p>“Could it be the divine mountain that supported the heavens during the primeval era?”Ao Qin muttered in puzzlement.</p><p>Jiu Li shook her head and said, “Definitely not. The Divine Mountain supported the heavens had long been destroyed after the end of the epoch. The remaining part is known as the material for the heaven flipping seal of Guangcheng, one of the nine supremacies of Haotian Taoism. This should be something that the nine-headed grand sage arranged and evolved on his own according to the Divine Mountain supported the heavens.”</p><p>As they conversed, they arrived at the bottom of the mountain. There were two rows of images of nine-headed birds carved there. Both of them exuded a sense of desolation and mystery.</p><p>“Mr. Yueluo, what’s the meaning of this?”Jiuli looked at he mu. Ao Qin and the other demons were also looking forward to it.</p><p>The Heavenly God mountain that was imitated pierced through the clouds. It was most likely to enter the immemorial celestial world. This was very similar to what he mu had previously interpreted!</p><p>He Mu felt extremely fortunate. In the past, if he entered a world similar to this, the universal sign would definitely be disturbed or even isolated. But today, his master’s body was blessed with good fortune and could already ignore this level of influence.</p><p>He sat down cross-legged and entered the universal sign again to seek help. It didn’t take long before he came to an answer.</p><p>“The right side means ‘the creatures here don’t develop intelligence’,”he mu said in a low voice.</p><p>“Yes.”Nine glass nodded, this and just see exactly the same.</p><p>He Mu in a look of anticipation under the continued said: “The left side of the meaning is ‘non-immortal non-god do not enter’.”</p><p>“Non-immortal non-god do not enter?”Nine glass frowned, “Do not become a demon god do not enter this mountain?”</p><p>She tried to urge the breath of the five Virtues Heaven and earth fan, but if there is an invisible wall in front of her, no matter how hard she tried, she could not get through!</p><p>He Mu’s heart stirred. He walked over and tried to take a step forward. A wave of water rippled. He had actually passed through it and entered the starting point of the mountain path!</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“How did you enter?”</p><p>Questions came out of the mouths of Ao Qin, Fairy Jin Lin, and the other demons. Their expressions were one of shock and bewilderment.</p><p>He Mu seemed to not know what was going on either. She stood rooted to the spot and pondered hard.</p><p>Even the aura of their divine weapons and magic treasures couldn’t fake an immortal to pass through, so how could I?</p><p>Right, my current aura was actually senior brother Xiao Tian’s aura. Although it had decreased by a lot, it was enough to be considered an immortal!</p><p>Was this a coincidence?</p><p>No, master must have foreseen this long ago. Everything was within his grasp!</p><p>He Mu subconsciously looked at the entrance of the cave abode, as if he wanted to look at the hollow jade temple of Mount Kunlun through it.</p><p>..</p><p>Inside the hollow jade temple of Kunlun Mountain.</p><p>Meng Qi was in a quiet room, sitting cross-legged on a cloud bed. His eyes were half open and half closed. He was deep in the darkness, and no one knew where his mind was.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
