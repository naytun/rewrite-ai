He didn’t expect such a change to happen.</p><p>Did true martial one “Turn into a corpse”?</p><p>Or did he leave behind some strange and undetectable thing in his own spiritual light? It didn’t have any other function but to establish a subtle connection. Once it got close to his body.., it would be able to wake him up from his ineffable state of being neither alive nor dead, and pull him out?</p><p>In an instant, Yellow Springs’thoughts surged and various speculations surfaced. He was more inclined to the final deduction.</p><p>Back then, Zhen Wu was one of the five ancient emperors, Black Emperor. He was the demon-slaying heavenly venerate of the nine venerables of Dao sect. Even if he was anxious about the mysteries of the shortcut in the depths of the origin of life and death in order to cross the sea of bitterness and reach the other shore, how could he be blinded by greed, he made a fatal mistake and went too far. How could he be helplessly assimilated by the Dao?</p><p>If he dared to do this, he must have a backup plan. It was a backup plan that could help his main body get out of this predicament!</p><p>And the him who was restrained by him at that time had unknowingly fallen into the Dao. It was very normal for him to imprint a subtle connection.</p><p>Therefore, he did not dare to get close at that time. He was afraid that the him who had been assimilated by the DAO would go through a lot of hardships and reincarnate. After making sufficient preparations, he would come back and become the catalyst to wake him up!</p><p>Thinking of this, yellow spring even had a suspicion that true martial emperor had deliberately set up a trap. He was assimilated by the Dao and took the risk to comprehend the mysteries of life and death. He had imprinted the strange state of life and death, which laid the foundation for his awakening, he himself had become an extremely important chess piece for him.</p><p>His thoughts went back and forth. Yellow Spring was also not an ordinary person. At this moment, all kinds of distracting thoughts were eliminated. He understood that he only had a slim chance of survival.</p><p>That was, before true martial emperor completely broke out of his strange state, he would use his fearless will to destroy his true spirit and take over his body!</p><p>Kill!</p><p>Facing true martial emperor’s eyes that shone with a brilliant purple color, yellow spring did not retreat. Instead, he advanced. His right hand clenched into a dragon claw and turned pitch-black. Flowing white light, he clawed straight toward demon subduing heavenly venerate’s Niwan Palace.</p><p>Strands of blood yellow shot out like sharp nails. They were full of a sinking color. Before they even approached, the flat crown on true martial emperor’s head was dyed with the color of death. Every strand of his black hair fell with the wind and withered inch by inch.</p><p>Meng Qi, the asura primogenitor, and the bloody massacre Daoist who were watching from afar were momentarily stunned. Then, they turned around at the same time and fled like crazy.</p><p>They couldn’t get close to where Zhenwu’s body was. Even their divine abilities and methods would be assimilated. If it wasn’t for the protective treasures that Netherworld had specially prepared, perhaps his voice and the image of Zhenwu’s body couldn’t be revealed. Therefore.., facing the strange awakening of the true martial emperor, they couldn’t hit him at all. If they couldn’t affect their surroundings, what use would it be for them to stay behind?</p><p>They could only run. They had to run. They had to run!</p><p>Just as he turned around, Meng Qi saw from the corner of his eye that the true martial emperor had raised his right palm. He turned his fingers into a sword and slashed forward!</p><p>Slash!</p><p>This wasn’t the sound that Meng Qi had heard. Instead, it was an abstract description that he had felt. Then, he saw the sword light that was extremely deep and dark burst forth. There was nothing else in his sight.</p><p>The sword light instantly enveloped everything. It was cold, quiet, soundless, cold, empty, lonely, gloomy, painful, dark, death, and other abstract feelings began to disintegrate. Warmth, warmth, exuberance, vitality, liveliness, joy, light.., the vivid descriptions and power descriptions quickly disappeared. Meng Qi’s Taoist power transformed into a brocade robe that disappeared without a sound. His flesh melted, revealing a vicious skeleton that was flowing in black and white, intertwined with life and death, and covered in a blood-yellow mist.</p><p>There were spikes protruding from every joint of the skeleton. However, in the sword light, they were like ice and snow that had encountered a blazing sun. They evaporated in an instant. Cracks appeared on the bones that were covered in blurry Taoist patterns, and many fragments were shattered, the fragments turned into ashes again. What was even more terrifying was that the life and death intent and blurry Taoist patterns that were intertwined with the skeleton were also dissolving.</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi even had a feeling that the era had come to an end, that the Great Dao had collapsed, and that everything and everything no longer existed.</p><p>Therefore, the will produced by his divinized thoughts seemed to have been burned by an invisible flame, stirred by countless sword glows. If it was not for the fact that there were still Netherworld’s bones blocking outside, they would have already died.</p><p>Near him, the nine-headed thousand-eyed Asura primogenitor, whose arms were like blooming flowers, was also enveloped by sword glows that were deep to dark to faint. It was as if he had turned into a mosquito that was frozen in amber, unable to move. His enormous and terrifying body disintegrated inch by inch, the burning flame gradually dimmed and walked toward extinction. The Demon God’s image and the guardian spirit surrounding him screamed silently and quickly dissipated.</p><p>He, who had recovered his peak condition, was actually unable to block the strike of the true martial emperor!</p><p>Of course, it was also because this place was the origin of life and death. Other than the cold and depraved death, there was also the vigorous life force. He was unable to receive the complete enhancement and enhancement as if he was in the netherworld, there was still a clear gap between him and his strongest combat strength.</p><p>The Bloody Massacre Daoist was even worse. It was as if he was frozen in space and time. The refined death sword blurred the dao patterns and scattered. Cracks appeared on the blade and hilt of the sword. The body of the evil God began to become transparent and drops of blood continuously dripped down.</p><p>As for the reincarnation of the Netherworld that bore the brunt of the attack, it disintegrated before it could even scream. Not only was there no flesh and blood, even the moral and legal principles that it had cultivated completely disappeared without a trace.</p><p>As Meng Qi’s consciousness began to blur, a sigh emerged in his heart.</p><p>This sword was the sky-cutting seven swords.</p><p>This sword was the dao-destroying dao-birth!</p><p>He had once experienced it in the hands of the evil thoughts of the true force. He did not expect that today, he would be struck by the sword of the true martial emperor.</p><p>The power of this sword even had the feeling of a few breaths before the Green Emperor had ascended to the other shore!</p><p>Just as Meng Qi was about to disperse his divided consciousness on his own to prevent his original body from suffering even more backlash, he suddenly felt a wave of warmth. Even the Great Dao would be destroyed, in the cold destruction of the disintegrated.., there was actually a faint warmth hidden in it.</p><p>It was like the warm sun in winter, the bonfire in the world of ice and snow, and a roasted sausage after climbing a mountain peak. It made people full of yang qi and was invulnerable to all evil. Even Meng Qi became clear-headed for a moment.</p><p>No, this was not a pure dao-destroying Dao-sheng! He thought quickly and grasped the abnormality within.</p><p>To be precise, the sword technique was indeed one of the seven heaven-severing swords, and it was indeed dao-destroying Dao-sheng. However, the power that true martial emperor used to propel this attack was not his own power, which was unusually harmonious with the sword technique. It was another power.</p><p>It was not that other powers could not control dao extinguishing dao Sheng, but that this power was too extreme. It was Yang without Yin, and it was firm without softness. As a result, there was a conflict with the first half of Dao Extinguishing Dao Sheng’s true essence, and thus, a glimmer of hope appeared, there was a possibility of dodging.</p><p>Meng Qi’s heart stirred. With the thought of seeing the complete dao extinguishing Dao Sheng, he curled up his divided consciousness and hid it in this faintly discernible sense of Yang and harmony.</p><p>The sword light was still stirring, and the intense pain reverberated in Meng Qi’s spiritual sense. However, he cast away all negative feelings and supported himself to feel the sword technique.</p><p>Soundlessly, the netherworld skeleton reached its limit. Every bone that contained the will of life and death in its body turned into pieces. The Vague Dao patterns were dismantled and disintegrated.</p><p>If Meng Qi’s consciousness had not been covered by that trace of warmth, it would have definitely returned to the icy darkness.</p><p>At that moment, everything was destroyed, the Great Dao was destroyed, and the sword light suddenly turned. Light was born in the darkness. Death was born, Yin and Yang were separated, and life and death were born again. Meng Qi wanted to turn the body and consciousness that he had worn away into his own dao.</p><p>In an instant, Meng Qi’s mind and soul were filled with wisdom. He leaped out of the warmth and destroyed the countless pieces of his body and will that had been created by the destruction of the bones in the netherworld, as well as the dao patterns that had been broken apart.</p><p>Then, he used the will of Dao to recombine the bone fragments with the momentum of a new life. Rays of light burst out. They were black and white, but not black and white.</p><p>The sword light surged, and the countless pieces gathered again. They were attracted by the Broken Dao patterns, and they evolved on their own, turning into a vague and mysterious state.</p><p>Meng Qi actually wanted to take advantage of the true martial emperor’s Dao Destruction Dao life sword. He wanted to use the bones of the Netherworld as the foundation and the surrounding dao patterns of life and death as the roots to create a peerless divine weapon!</p><p>As the dao patterns fell, the light from the fragments became even brighter. His will was almost exhausted, and he could barely borrow the power of the sword.</p><p>Black and white condensed, and the light surged. The countless fragments of the bones of the Netherworld carried the dao patterns, and they suddenly shrank. They crazily absorbed the abstract concepts that had reappeared in the surroundings, and they absorbed Meng Qi’s consciousness.</p><p>Just as he was about to faint, Meng Qi felt the vibration in the surroundings. The sword light was gone, and the black and white soared, transforming into a scroll of yin and yang fish intertwined. The will of life and death was clearly contained within each other, and it actually had the feeling of a life and death book.</p><p>This was an anomaly created by a peerless divine weapon. If it wasn’t within the origin of life and death, it would have been announced to the world in the Netherworld!</p><p>The anomaly retracted, and black and white collapsed. A pitch-black treasure wheel that was suffused with threads of white light appeared before Meng Qi’s eyes. It floated in the abstract description, and it was suffused with a faint blood-yellow mist.</p><p>It controlled the wheel of life and death in the heavens!</p><p>Meng Qi’s exhausted consciousness smiled. Although it wasn’t a supreme treasure of the other shore, this ‘wheel of life and death in the Heavens’was also a creation.</p><p>He was able to create a creation-grade divine weapon with his legendary realm. If it wasn’t for the coincidence, it would have been impossible!</p><p>At this moment, in the origin of life and death, the asura primogenitor disappeared, the bloody massacre Daoist disappeared, and the yellow springs were gone. As for the true martial emperor, he was in the depths and didn’t have a protective treasure of the Yellow Springs, meng Qi couldn’t see his current situation at all.</p><p>“The bloody massacre Daoist and the yellow springs have been completely destroyed. The Asura primogenitor has seized that ‘warmth’and escaped from the origin of life and death. However, he has been severely injured. Although he has gained his lifespan, it is difficult for him to return to the old view. It is really a disaster caused by greed…”Meng Qi pondered for a moment, seeing that there were no abnormal movements in the depths of the origin of life and death, his thoughts flashed through his mind. He actually dispersed his avatar and left the Heavenly Wheel of life and death here!</p><p>The Wheel of life and death of the heavens was abnormally harmonious with the surroundings and gradually faded away, as if it had also turned into an abstract description.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
