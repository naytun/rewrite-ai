He felt the majestic and righteous aura of the way of the king, as well as the vague and clear wisdom of the weight.</p><p>This was the emperor’s handwritten letter and the Pure Land of Wenshu that had been secretly transmitted to him. The matter was confidential, and it was easy to be detected by the back-and-forth movements. It was blocked by unexpected changes, so it was best not to split the negotiation and transaction into two.</p><p>The human emperor’s handwritten letter was only a thin layer, but it was so heavy that it was like the gathering of an infinite sea of stars. The Wen Shu pure land spanned across billions of tribulations and covered the universe. It had profound wisdom and was filled with tranquility, but it was so light that it was as if it had no weight, the two happened to form a sharp contrast.</p><p>Meng Qi did not take a second look. He kept them in his sleeve as if it was a normal occurrence. He looked around at his senior brothers and sisters and pushed his Daoist crown with a smile. Without a change in his expression, he had already gone out of the hollow jade temple without a trace, he followed the secret passage that he had sneaked into the netherworld the last time and headed to the place where Qi Zhengyan and Zhao Heng were now standing — the scarlet mountain range on the first level of the netherworld.</p><p>Without the approval of the green emperor, Meng Qi would not have dared to do this. Once he left the hollow jade temple, he would have a cover and the ability to change with the wind. He would not be able to hide it from those on the other shore and those in the blessed realm who could be called celestial venerables, from then on, his future was uncertain and unexpected. He could only carry out the true plan of uniting and uniting. He had to think carefully and discuss the distribution of benefits before he put the matter of the god Ascension roll on the table,</p><p>now that the Green Emperor had agreed, even if there was still the possibility of emperor Fu and the monster of the Heavenly Dao fighting, the prerequisite was that the act of snatching the god Ascension roll would be detected. On this point, it was not difficult for the green emperor to conceal the matter and help him hide it from the world.</p><p>The Black Sun Hung High in the sky, demonic qi churned, and the power of filth and depravity filled the air. All kinds of negative spiritual tides were like the wind, having very different moral and legal principles from the real world and the nine heavens.</p><p>Meng Qi changed slightly and transformed into an ‘original incipient heavenly devil’. He immediately felt the terrifying power of the nine Netherworld being augmented layer by layer, he actually condensed illusory daos of destruction, Slaughter, devouring, assimilation, filth, death, reincarnation, and so on (not the real dao, but something close to the Dao. Only by forming illusory dao fruits can it be called some aspects of the real ‘Dao’) , the Sea of bitterness around him was endless and bottomless. It was filled with pain that could not be relieved. Meanwhile, the river of time flowed through his body and surged silently, washing away his body.</p><p>After receiving the ‘gift’from the Netherworld, ‘Primordial Skyfiend’Meng Qi directly entered the blessed realm and temporarily became a great divine ability user.</p><p>Of course, the reason why he was able to condense so many illusory daos was because chaos contained all things. If it were other evil gods or devils, they would only be able to upgrade their corresponding daos.</p><p>At the same time, Meng Qi’s Wuji, which was already close to the Dao, had also been upgraded. It could be considered to be at the middle level among great divine arts practitioners. After all, he was a legendary almighty who could step into the blessed realm at any time, he could be treated as a pseudo-great divine arts practitioner.</p><p>As he experienced this power that was so powerful that it made people intoxicated, Meng Qi took a light breath and examined his thoughts. He warned himself not to be confused by this. It was easy to obtain external power, but it was also easy to lose it.</p><p>Step by step, cultivation was his own path!</p><p>His figure turned into a dark light and left the Yellow Springs. He passed through the Devil Fog and hid himself in the scarlet mountain range.</p><p>After a while, the towering and continuous mountain range appeared in front of his eyes. The scarlet color was like fire, and the blood and malevolence were “Calcined”and diluted. It gave off a brand new vigor and a heroic spirit that could fight against Heaven and earth.</p><p>A single spark could start a prairie fire!</p><p>Just as he saw it, Meng Qi suddenly had a thought. He pressed down the escape light and stopped moving forward.</p><p>The void within a radius of more than a hundred thousand miles of the mountain range was filled with an ominous coldness and filth. It seemed to be a normal scene of the nine underworld, but the sharp premonition brought by the eight-nine arcane art made Meng Qi believe that.., there was not even one terrifying guy who was so powerful that he was almost on the other side of the river peeping at this place!</p><p>If he recklessly approached, he would definitely be discovered!</p><p>“It’s those Old Fellows?”Meng Qi closed his eyes, severed his senses, and retracted his spiritual sense. He only removed his old cognitive mode and activated the cause of all karma.</p><p>In an instant, illusory darkness appeared, and it immediately became hazy and indistinct. In the depths of different directions, there seemed to be terrifying monsters that were unimaginably huge, devouring countless universes. Unknown.., mysterious, terrifying, crazy!</p><p>It really is those few old fellows. Moreover, their numbers are much greater than I imagined! Meng Qi muttered to himself.</p><p>Some of these old fellows had once suppressed a devil master in the ancient times. Some had attained dao in the middle ancient times and had almost interacted with devils and Buddhas. They were at the very top of the Evil Gods and Evil Gods of the nine Netherworlds, and they were all able to partially control the nine Netherworlds, super experts who could resist the invasion of important figures together were often called pseudo-nirvana.</p><p>In ancient times, there were only two similar evil gods and devils. Before they landed on the other shore, the Devil Lord and Daoist Tiansha were there. But with the arrival of the apocalypse, the end of the era was approaching, and the intent of destruction was ready to be unleashed, although no new important figures were born in the netherworld, because they followed the law of Dao, the number of false other shore was even higher. According to Meng Qi’s knowledge, there were three of them, but from the perception of karma, there seemed to be four of them!</p><p>In the deepest depths of the illusory darkness, the gloomy and scorching heat that spread chaos, evil, and destruction made Meng Qi feel as if he was facing a monster of the Heavenly Dao, and his body was about to crazily split apart, moreover, the negative emotions in his consciousness almost could not be suppressed.</p><p>This was an evil god that had just been born in the Middle Ages. It was a symbol of destruction that appeared when he sensed the end of the apocalypse and the end of the era. It was a manifestation of chaos and was called the “Nine chaos heavenly venerate.”He probably did not know the exact name himself.</p><p>Far to his left, there was a cold, dark, and filthy illusory hazy feeling. It was the “Ghost Emperor Xuanming”who had once suppressed the Devil Master in the ancient times. It was the first ghost that was born in this era, but it was later surpassed by the Devil Master, instead, it became the other party’s subordinate and then watched the Devil master ascend to the other shore.</p><p>Only when the devil master fell and his body scattered did he use the will of death to go one step further and reach the pseudo-other shore level under the support of the nine underworld.</p><p>Far to the right of the nine chaos heavenly venerate, there were layers and layers of evil madness that quietly coiled and stirred up space and time. He was also an old fellow from the ancient times who was born with the negative side of time, he had the will of scouring, withering, Doomsday, and the end. He was known as the “Black Celestial Emperor”and was the most difficult to deal with among the three pseudo-nirvana realms. Back then, he was only second to the Devil Lord and Heavenly Slaughter.</p><p>The fourth sense was opposite the “Black Celestial Emperor”. The intent of blood, devouring, melting, plundering, and killing faintly pervaded the air. If it wasn’t for the chaotic space-time nearby that had shown some signs, Meng Qi might not have been able to notice it.</p><p>“It’s a little familiar, like the nine Netherworld Blood Demon I encountered before… how did it become so strong all of a sudden… the feeling of slaughter… could it be that after it returned early, it coincidentally obtained Daoist Skykill’s remains and devoured and plundered it?”Meng Qi guessed the source of the fourth sense.</p><p>If Daoist Tiansha had not been defeated by demon saint and successfully turned the land of demons into a world of devils, he would have had a great hope of reaching the other shore. His remains were invaluable to the blood demons who were adept at plundering, devouring, and assimilating.</p><p>Apart from these four feelings, there were two other indiscernible spies, slightly worse than the nine chaos heavenly venerate, Ghost Emperor Xuanming, nine Netherworld Blood Demon, and Black Heaven Emperor. They were all familiar to Meng Qi, so it was not difficult for him to distinguish them.</p><p>A pure killing intent came from Daoist seven kills. He seemed to have used the opportunity when Meng Qi cut off the connection between the Devil Buddha and it was unable to reach out its “Hand”to finally break free from its control, furthermore, with the assistance of the Netherworld Sea sword and many years of accumulation, he had broken through many bottlenecks.</p><p>A deep demonic intent that contained almost all the negative dao belonged to the “Devil Lord”who had not completely recovered from his heavy injuries.</p><p>These six should be the highest combat strength of the nine underworld camp at the moment… if not for the fact that they both wanted the demon Emperor’s Claw and were wary of each other, senior brother qi and fifth brother Zhao would have been flattened long ago, “The great unfettered emperor is definitely not their match…”Meng Qi nodded slightly as he observed the surroundings and thought of a way to hide from the six daos’prying eyes.</p><p>Due to the gains from the origin of life and death, his own boundless chaos shortcut, and the nine Underworld’s enhancement, it should not be a problem for him to hide his aura and tracks from the demon lord, Daoist seven kills, and the nine underworld blood demon who had just broken through, however, the nine chaos heavenly venerate, the Xuanming Ghost Emperor, and the Black Heaven Emperor were all old fogeys. With the appearance of a Great Dao, their instincts were sharp, and it wasn’t so easy to deceive them. As long as they were discovered and made a move, the other factions would be able to detect it, the variables increased rapidly.</p><p>When he saw many evil gods and demons cross the mountain ridges to enter the crimson land to resist the nine serenities influence, Meng Qi immediately had an idea.</p><p>These evil gods and demons were definitely not all willing. There was no lack of chess pieces that the Black Heavenly Emperor and the other old guys used to sneak into the crimson mountain range… Meng Qi’s face revealed a smile. He circulated the cause and effect of all the fruits and examined them one by one, searching for clues.</p><p>When he found one, he took the opportunity before he could get close to the area where the six senses were spying on him. Meng Qi transformed into a speck of dust. When the other party breathed, it entered his mouth and entered his stomach, where it was corroded by strong acid.</p><p>The boundless will of chaos appeared and wrapped around the Speck of dust. It was dark and there was no trace of it anymore.</p><p>The evil demon was completely unaware of it. He took a step forward and entered the area of the scarlet mountain range. He was about to pass through the places where the senses were spying on him.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
