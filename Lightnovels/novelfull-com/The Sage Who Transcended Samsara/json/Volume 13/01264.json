He said with a smile, “Our Jade Void Palace is indeed the successor to the peak. It is one of the few large factions in the universe.”</p><p>He spoke with a slightly old air. In terms of true age, the youngest person present was more than a hundred years older than him. However, as the sect master of the Jade Void Palace, there was nothing wrong with his words. Therefore, the few legendary mighty figures listened quietly, they each made their own introductions.</p><p>Among them, the one who left the deepest impression on Meng Qi was the disciple of the red sperm, mountain man Qi Xi, and the direct disciple of Celestial Venerable Wen Shu Guangfa, Jian Wanlin. The former had an old face, and at first glance, she looked like she was over seventy years old. After careful investigation, her actual state of mind was probably around thirty years old, the two formed a sharp contrast, and Meng Qi really didn’t know how he did it — after using a Dharma body, one’s appearance and age often only depended on one’s own state of mind.</p><p>Mountain Man Qi Xi’s aura was majestic and far-reaching. He had the strength of a legendary peak, while Jian Wanlin was even more outstanding. If it was not for Meng Qi being able to step into the blessed realm at any time, he would not have been able to notice that her true level was close to that of a great divine ability user. Her appearance was delicate and graceful, she gave off a feeling of lightness, as if she was a real sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl.</p><p>After greeting her, Meng Qi looked around and said with a faint smile,</p><p>“All of you are the pillars of the hollow jade temple. Today’s gathering is to discuss the future path of our sect.”</p><p>“Please speak, Junior Brother Sect Master.”Guang Chengzi spoke with tacit understanding.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded, “Our hollow jade temple has always valued the human race and has repeatedly supported the human emperor. At the end of this calamity, we are no exception. Do any of you have any objections?”</p><p>“No.””The Hierarch Immortal Venerable Is Right.”All the almighty experts present expressed their agreement.</p><p>“Since there are no objections, then let’s discuss the matter of the god-ascension roll. It has now fallen into the hands of the nine Nether Demon Emperor. If we can obtain it, we can help complete the heaven-sealing platform and allow the human emperor to rule the heavens with human dao. This is a great kindness,”Meng Qi said slowly, his tone was indifferent without any emotion, as if he was talking about something that had nothing to do with him.</p><p>Just as Chi Jinzi was about to speak, Meng Qi changed the topic and said with a deep look in his eyes, “I have a few small opinions. I will first put them out for your reference and be a rock from another mountain.”</p><p>Since the sect leader had already said so much, the two celestial venerables, Guang Chengzi and Wen Shu, immediately cupped their hands:</p><p>“Sect leader, please speak. We are all ears.”</p><p>Meng Qi slowly swept his gaze across the faces. His emotions were deep, and the sect leader’s dignity was born, then, he said, “This is the end of the calamity. If we don’t think far ahead, there will be immediate worries. Now, the few in nine underworlds have completely awakened and are fighting against each other. The undercurrents are surging. If one of them were to seize the demon emperor’s claws, it would be like adding wings to a tiger. There is a high possibility that they will follow the old demon master’s example and unify nine underworlds. They will ascend to the other shore and fight against the immortal world and the Earth. Such a situation is the next best choice for the Human Emperor’s future plans and the path of our hollow jade temple. Do you all agree?”</p><p>Guang Chengzi said with a calm smile, “Indeed, it’s in our best interest to keep the nine underworld in a chaotic state.”</p><p>“No one wants to see a demon lord again,”Chi Jinzi agreed.</p><p>Wen Shu smiled faintly, her eyes full of spirit, she was full of wisdom. “If we want to transcend the final calamity, I’m afraid we have to break through our previous experiences. We can’t just be limited to the immortal world and the real world. Besides the rule of humanity, we also have to control the nine underworld. Only then can we be complete.”</p><p>Therefore, those from the nine serenities could not leave the other side. They had to try their best to maintain the balance of power between the few of them and not allow one to dominate.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly. His gaze was like a deep pool, there was not the slightest fluctuation. “Therefore, when we take the god Ascension Roll from the Demon Emperor, we can’t weaken his faction. We can’t let the few from the nine serenities find an opportunity to obtain the demon Emperor’s claw or other great benefits.”</p><p>Guang Chengzi pondered for a moment and immediately understood what Meng Qi meant. “Junior sect master wants to obtain the god Ascension roll through a trade?”</p><p>“Yes. Since the god Ascension roll has been banned and the demon Emperor has retreated to the netherworld, this item will no longer be of use to him for a very long time. Then, we can naturally take out the benefits that will move his heart to exchange for it. On one hand, we can prevent others from taking advantage of the chaos and plundering. On the other hand, we can also allow his faction to grow stronger. It will no longer be like food in the mouths of those few old fellows. It will have a certain degree of power to resist and stir up the water in the Netherworld even more, maintaining it until the time we need.”Meng Qi said in an indifferent tone, he got rid of all the distractions of his emotions.</p><p>The Hollow Jade Temple fell into silence for a short while. They were considering something. Meng Qi did not speak and waited quietly.</p><p>After a while, Celestial Master Guangfa smiled and said, “If there was another choice, who would want to take the risk and fight? It just so happens that my Buddhist body has fallen, and only the Pure Land of wisdom is left, which can be exchanged.”</p><p>“This pure land is no longer of much use to my original body, but it is of great help to the Demon Emperor. He wants to teach the demons of the nine Netherworlds and lead them to resist fate, to transcend the original limitations, and to obtain the spiritual light of their nature and the liberation of their flesh and blood. Isn’t it the same as the Buddhist transformation? “With this pure land, the evil demons and evil gods will have a place to hide from the influence of the nine Netherworlds, and a place to breathe. Moreover, the light of wisdom in the Pure Land will help them to develop their spiritual wisdom and better resist the fate of the nine Netherworlds.”</p><p>Beside him, Guang Chengzi took out a book. Although it had not been opened, the aura of the righteous king had already spread out, making people unconsciously have the urge to lower their heads.</p><p>“This is a book written by the previous human emperor. Studying and comprehending it day and night will allow those who cultivate the same cultivation method to achieve twice the result with half the effort. I believe that the current Master of the god Ascension Board will be very satisfied.”Guang Chengzi was still as immortal-like as ever.</p><p>Back then, it was Zhao Heng who had worn away the imprint of Lu Ya and left his own imprint.</p><p>Meng Qi sat at the head of the table and nodded:</p><p>“Thank you, senior brother and senior sister. I believe that these two items should be able to move them and exchange them for the god Ascension Board.”</p><p>“But other than that, there are many other things to consider. The most important thing is emperor Qing’s attitude. He controls the underworld with the nine spirits original saint. I wonder what he will think of the Heaven Court.”</p><p>At this point, his voice became serious. “Senior Brother Guangcheng, please go to Dou Shuai Palace and ask the golden-horned or silver-horned boy to go to the Fusang Ancient Tree Realm and ask Emperor Qing for advice on this matter.”</p><p>There was no one more suitable than the boy under the celestial venerable of morals to do this!</p><p>Although he owed Emperor Qing a favor for attaining dao, he had repeatedly asked for help and had worn down a lot of it. It was not good to take an inch and take a mile.</p><p>Guang Chengzi immediately stood up and cupped his hands:</p><p>“This humble Daoist receives the sect leader’s decree.”</p><p>After this conversation and Meng Qi’s performance just now, those who previously felt that his qualifications were insufficient, that his age was too young, and that his cultivation state was slightly inferior had truly thought that the current hollow jade temple’s sect leader was sitting in front of them.</p><p>Of course, this was also due to Guang Chengzi’s full cooperation.</p><p>Once the prestige was established, when Meng Qi spoke again, everyone listened very attentively:</p><p>“If we can get the tacit approval of the green emperor, the matter of the god Ascension roll will not be affected. But we can not not consider the green emperor’s different attitude. If he wants to take the god Ascension Roll, then we can not compete with him. If his attitude is ambiguous, then we must consider the involvement of other forces. They will definitely not watch US complete the rule of humanity.”</p><p>Wen Shu Guangfa was the first to nod his head. “The ancient Buddhas and great bodhisattvas of the Buddhist sect have all returned. It’s not just burning lamp and Maitreya. As far as I know, all the unfettered kings and Buddhas in the world have awakened from their slumber. Even if the spiritual mountains were damaged by the same level of cultivators, it wouldn’t be any less than our hollow jade temple.”</p><p>“The demon Grand Sage has almost returned to his old temple,”the jade tripod master added calmly.</p><p>Chi Jinzi added, “Something happened on the three clouds island. Yunxiao and the rest have returned. The other powerful cultivators of the Numinous Treasure lineage have also revealed their traces.”</p><p>“The remaining divine envoys of the Luo sect have all awakened,”Nezha said through gritted teeth. It was as if he had accidentally suffered a loss. His tone turned heavy, “The leader of the Divine envoys is the Great Immortal Zhenyuan of the five villages Temple!”</p><p>It was him? Meng Qi was surprised, but he had expected it.</p><p>From the discovery of the relationship between the ginseng fruit and the peaches of immortality, he knew that Zhenyuan Zi must have some connection with the gold emperor.</p><p>After discussing the matter for a while, Meng Qi maintained his calm and indifferent state and said,</p><p>“The specifics, who can win him over, and who can’t avoid it all depend on one premise, and that is the fundamental path of the current human emperor.”</p><p>“Please Wait a moment. Senior Brother Guangcheng and I are going out for the time being. One is to go to Dou Shuai Palace, and the other is to go to Changle Palace City. I want to ask the current human emperor in person what kind of humanity he wants.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
