Dark clouds converged, and lightning turned into a sea, forming a whirlpool. It was of all colors, and it emitted an extremely terrifying aura.</p><p>At this moment, they were like Meng Qi’s figure. They shattered like bubbles and slowly dispersed, leaving behind a scene that seemed like the end of Grand Master Pei’s dream.</p><p>For a moment, Pei Daotong, whose heart was as firm as a rock, really thought that he had fallen into the enemy’s illusion. How could there be a lightning tribulation in the world where one step at a time could allow one to ascend from the perfected first tribulation to the “Creator”realm within six breaths?</p><p>There hadn’t been such a thing in the past, and it was almost certain that there wouldn’t be such a thing in the future!</p><p>He had been refined and improved by that Buddha lamp, and with the guidance of Venerable Ananda who had descended from the Pure Land, it had taken him three whole months to accumulate the fifth lightning tribulation. The sixth Lightning Tribulation took half a year, and the seventh lightning tribulation took more than two years, even so, it could be said that it was unprecedented. The speed of his rapid progress had reached an amazing state, but who would have thought that there would be such a heaven-defying thing as transcending the Lightning Tribulation once in a breath, even the barrier of seven tribulations from the land God to the creator was no exception!</p><p>Was this still the world that he knew?</p><p>Was there still a bright universe in this world?</p><p>When he discerned the aura of the lightning tribulation around him and recalled what he had seen before, he was sure that the unbelievable thing had really happened. The calm and composed Pei Daotong could not help but feel his heart waver. His breathing quickened, and for some reason, he felt a sense of despair.</p><p>Would he have any chance of winning against such an enemy?</p><p>Even if both parties were at the same cultivation level, and he seemed to have accumulated more experience and had stronger martial arts supernatural powers, as if he could suppress the other party, he still could not resist the four words “Illogical”as he fought, he had to undergo another lightning tribulation or two to suppress himself in terms of cultivation level. who could he find to reason with?</p><p>Such a situation was not impossible. Looking at the Lightning Tribulation one step at a time, it was very likely!</p><p>“Is he still human…”Xiao Kun’s low voice came from the side. It was rare for Pei Daotong to agree with him, and he woke up the clay puppets around him.</p><p>Pei Daotong took a deep breath and completely recovered from the shock, disappointment, and despair. He replayed the scene from the beginning to the end, and his eyes lit up again. He said in a low voice,</p><p>“His limit is seven tribulations</p><p>“Otherwise, he could have gone through another tribulation and killed me on the spot</p><p>“It is precisely because his limit is seven tribulations that he deliberately met me face to face. He staged a lightning tribulation in front of me one step at a time and achieved a breakthrough one breath at a time in order to destroy my will and heart.”</p><p>It was not that the experts would not be afraid, but that they would not be confused by fear. Pei Daotong walked out of his despair and fear in an extremely short period of time and saw the truth.</p><p>Hearing Pei Daotong’s words, the ninth king, Xiao Kun, also understood Meng Qi’s true intention of “Meeting Grand Master Pei for a while.”.</p><p>After thinking for a while, Xiao Kun deliberately stuttered, “He… seems to be… seems to be Daoist Master Yun Ji.”</p><p>“Daoist Master Yun Ji?”Pei daotong glanced at him, “So it’s him?”</p><p>The ninth king had previously attached himself to the Daoist sect, but later on, because of His Majesty’s strict estrangement, it was not surprising that he knew that Daoist Master Yun Ji had even met him once or twice.</p><p>“Before Reverend Yun Ji came out into the world and entered the mountain, I met him once. However, he was still young at that time and did not have a deep memory. It is only now that I remember him,”Xiao Kun said without blinking his eyes.</p><p>Pei Daotong nodded. “Yun Ji was originally a sixth Tribulation Daoist. After coming out into the world and cultivating for many years, it is not surprising that he has accumulated enough experience to break through to the ‘creator’realm. Most likely, he used some secret technique to intentionally lower his cultivation level so that he could perform the heroic act of Thunder Tribulation Step by step and shake my heart.”</p><p>This was his guess, but it was only a guess at the moment. Although he was no longer as depressed and desperate as before, his heart was still heavy as if it was pressing down on a mountain peak, making it difficult for him to breathe.</p><p>Letting out a breath, nine powerful lightning dragons suddenly rose around Pei Dao Tong and surrounded him. Then, they turned into a bolt of lightning and flew towards the palace city.</p><p>No matter what, a new “Creator”had appeared in Dao sect. The situation was no longer the same. They had to reconsider!</p><p>..</p><p>In the courtyard where the Daoist masters of Dao sect were gathered, they hadn’t taken any action yet. They were shocked by the strange sight of the dark clouds descending and the lightning sea landing on the ground. For a moment, they felt as if their souls were flying out of their bodies.</p><p>Normally, the first three tribulations would trigger the Lightning to descend from the sky. From the fourth tribulation, they would fly into the sky, burrow into the dark clouds, and step into the Lightning Sea to undergo tests and tempering. But today, the Lightning Sea was actually pulled to the ground?</p><p>What exactly happened?</p><p>As these thoughts flashed through their minds, their vision blurred. They saw Meng Qi wearing a bamboo hat and a black robe. They felt that the other party’s aura seemed weak, but in reality, it was majestic and lofty. It was as if he was the lord of creation who looked down on all living beings from the nine heavens, it was difficult for them to have any thoughts of resisting.</p><p>“Senior, you, you have passed the Seventh Lightning Tribulation?”Bi Chongde blurted out. His tone was agitated, and his body could not help but tremble slightly.</p><p>Meng Qi coughed lightly and said with a smile, “When the old Daoist met Pei Daotong, he passed six lightning tribulations consecutively, suppressing his aura.”</p><p>“What?”One voice after another couldn’t be suppressed. It was noisy and chaotic.</p><p>Meng Qi shook his head. He felt mentally exhausted, and his body was aching.</p><p>It was still too difficult to pass the seventh lightning tribulation. If he hadn’t grasped the will of life and death and instantly reversed the omen of death and filled his body with life force and energy, even if he could pass it, he would probably be at the end of his rope. He wouldn’t be able to escape from Pei Daotong’s senses.</p><p>His current ‘soul’was a consciousness. He didn’t have any power on his own, and it was thanks to the help of the formation and the heavenly tribulation that he was able to gradually inscribe the lightning patterns that he was able to achieve magic. On the other hand, Reverend Yunji’s physical body was only six tribulations, so.., it was easy for him to recover to this realm, but it was quite difficult for him to advance further. With his own control over the Dao of yin and Yang of lightning and the full power of his physical body, Meng Qi was barely able to become a ‘creator’, in the future, if he wanted to continue improving, he could only cultivate and accumulate like the people in this world. There was no shortcut. Of course, with his understanding of the nature of power, he would definitely be much faster than the others.</p><p>The reason why Meng Qi was in a hurry instead of delaying the seven tribulations was to create the situation just now, to strike and even destroy Pei Daotong’s belief. Even if he could see the problem.., the seed of failure would inevitably be planted in his heart, waiting for the right opportunity to erupt. Pei Daotong could see that his current limit was seven tribulations, but what if he waited for another half a month, a month, or a year? When they met at that time, he would definitely wonder if the enemy had accumulated enough and was about to make a breakthrough at the last minute.</p><p>This kind of spiritual confrontation. It had been a long time since Meng Qi had done it. After becoming a legend, he was able to examine his own thoughts and find “Loopholes in his soul”and “Seeds of failure.”If the battle broke out suddenly, such a confrontation would still be somewhat useful, if the opponent was given a certain amount of time, it would definitely be ineffective.</p><p>Taking a light breath, Meng Qi’s strength recovered steadily. He looked at Li Zhongkang and the others who were shocked by his words with a smile and said,</p><p>“It’s a long story, and we shouldn’t stay here for long. Let’s go according to our plan.”</p><p>After the seventh tribulation, he had almost run out of energy. If he stayed where he was, he would definitely be defeated by Pei Daotong and could not escape from him. Therefore, he took advantage of the other party’s shock and confusion and used the aura of the Lightning Tribulation as a cover, he reversed life and death, recovered a little strength, and then ran away.</p><p>This was truly running away after showing off. He had no choice but to run… Meng Qi silently criticized himself.</p><p>Li Zhongkang swallowed hard and said,</p><p>“Congratulations, senior, for becoming the creator and spreading the might of our dao sect!”</p><p>“Congratulations, senior, for becoming the creator and spreading the might of our dao sect!”The other Daoists and chivalrous experts hurriedly followed suit to congratulate him. Their expressions still had a hint of confusion, and they had no idea what had happened.</p><p>After a short while, Li Zhongkang asked, “Senior, we are about to go our own ways. May I know what you intend to do?”</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said, “I will go to various places and hunt down Xiao Xuan and Pei Daotong’s trusted aides.”</p><p>There were only a few cities that could stop the ‘creator’, and the rest were completely unable to stop me.</p><p>There was nothing that gave Xiao Xuan and Pei Daotong a headache more than a ‘creator’who was engaging in guerrilla warfare. If there was, it would be that this ‘creator’could pass the eighth tribulation at any time, and they had to get rid of him as soon as possible.</p><p>In this way, there was no need to worry that Pei Daotong would not leave the capital!</p><p>Meng Qi casually grabbed with his hand, and the surrounding crimson flames emerged from the void, condensing into a somewhat spiritual fire dragon.</p><p>The fire dragon shook its head and wagged its tail, entangling Meng Qi and instantly escaping the capital.</p><p>..</p><p>Pei Daotong returned to the imperial study room and felt that the atmosphere here was unusually heavy, like an ancient ice cave.</p><p>With Xiao Xuan’s realm and strength, the matters not far from the palace city naturally could not be hidden from him. He was also shocked by Meng Qi’s step by step tribulation, and it was difficult for him to regain his senses for a long time. Once he regained his senses, he would regain his composure.</p><p>“Venerable Anan, is this what you meant by quietly observing the changes?”Xiao Xuan could not help but look at the monk who was smiling without the slightest bit of shock.</p><p>Anan smiled and said, “Yun Ji died early. It was only because a venerable immortal of the Daoist sect from beyond the heavens had come to the mortal world and used his corpse to walk around, interfering with the matter of exterminating Daoism and Buddhism. That was how he was able to transcend seven tribulations consecutively. However, this is also his current limit.”</p><p>“Seven tribulations?”</p><p>“A venerable immortal from the Dao sect came to the mortal world?”</p><p>Xiao Xuan and Pei Daotong each grasped an important point.</p><p>Ah nan nodded and said, “He transcended seven tribulations in two days… As for the venerable immortal from the realm beyond heaven who came to the mortal world, what is there to be surprised about? Didn’t this penniless monk also come from the Pure Land?”</p><p>Speaking up to this point, he took out a bell that was overflowing with purple qi. It was filled with an evil aura that could suck one’s soul:</p><p>“Although he has gone through seven consecutive tribulations, his weakness has not been eliminated. His body and spirit are still not compatible. As long as he encounters this heart-stopping bell of mine, his consciousness and body will immediately separate, and his strength will plummet. Grand Preceptor Pei, take this thing and capture him.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
