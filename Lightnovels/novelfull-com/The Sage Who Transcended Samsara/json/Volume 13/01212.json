Each test was more difficult than the previous one. Through them, we can see the various futures that he has deduced and use them to motivate the disciples to work hard. However, generations passed down, and up until now, no one has succeeded. The vast majority have even stopped at the first test, and only a few people have been able to break through the second test. Even the current legendary elders have not passed the second Test.”</p><p>“What kind of tests are they? Can I try them?”Meng Qi asked politely.</p><p>Yue Ziqing’s light red dress moved and she stood up:</p><p>“Sure, follow me into the void-stopping mountain.”</p><p>An ancient green lamp appeared in her hand. The light was like a bean, illuminating the cabin and sprinkling warmth, bringing peace and harmony.</p><p>In the light of the fire, there seemed to be a hidden and deep connection, reflecting a mysterious and deep door with the words “Truth is real”written on it.</p><p>“The location of the mountain gate is also known as the Gate of Truth.”Yue Ziqing was like a fairy statue that had come to life, flying toward the door with an inhuman aura.</p><p>The door seemed to be close at hand, but in the light of the fire, she flew smaller and smaller, as if she had passed through the barrier of the real world and crossed a distance that could not be described with numbers.</p><p>Meng Qi stood there in a daze, not following her for a moment.</p><p>She agreed just like that?</p><p>She agreed without any conditions?</p><p>She was already prepared to make an exchange, but she actually agreed without any conditions!</p><p>This was not a small matter!</p><p>Could there be a trap?</p><p>Yue Ziqing’s reaction was completely out of Meng Qi’s expectations. His thoughts spun rapidly and he deduced in his heart. In the end, he chose to believe that the Outer Dao six masters were truly reclusive and would not get involved in the current situation.</p><p>Taking a step forward, his figure disappeared and reappeared. He actually arrived in front of the “Void end mountain”faster than Yue Ziqing. The surrounding time seemed to have turned into a torrential current that surged over, however, all of this was weakened to normal by the light of the green lamp.</p><p>Yue Ziqing flew over and spat out the words of truth from his mouth. They turned into three large characters that stuck to the door of truth.</p><p>The door opened with a bang.</p><p>Through the thick layer of mud-like mist, Meng Qi’s eyes lit up. He saw a green-gray divine mountain that he had never seen before. One Mountain was a world!</p><p>Meng Qi had just followed Yue Ziqing to a certain peak when he saw the void in front of him float. A ten-foot-tall man with a yellow scarf appeared. His iron armor was clanging, his eyes were bright red, and there was a golden treasure light behind his head.</p><p>His aura was extremely powerful, as if he was part of the incarnation of this world of the void-stopping mountain. A three-foot-long red light shot out of his eyes, as if he was sizing up Meng Qi. He said in a mechanical voice,</p><p>“Who is it?”</p><p>Yue Ziqing took out his waist token and said elegantly and indifferently, “It’s a guest that I invited.”</p><p>As soon as he said that, the yellow-scarved strongman revealed an illusion and merged with Heaven and earth. He did not ask anymore.</p><p>Meng Qi sensed the remnant aura of the yellow-scarved strongman and recalled the Golden Treasure Light. He asked with puzzlement, “It looks like a body ritual?”</p><p>Yes, the yellow-scarved strongman seemed to be a body ritual. It was similar to the feeling of the Moonlight Bodhisattva and the Moon Mani Bodhisattva, and its strength was not inferior to that of the legends!</p><p>A yellow-scarved strongman from the Void Mountain was comparable to a legendary mighty figure?</p><p>Wasn’t this too unbelievable? Even the real hollow jade temple couldn’t do it!</p><p>Yue Ziqing nodded and said, “The body-reporting yellow-scarved strongman created by Mount Zhixu can appear anywhere by telepathy. If an external enemy invades, no matter where they come from, they will be stopped.”</p><p>“Body-reporting yellow-scarved strongman?”Even Meng Qi, who had created a world-wide world-understanding and brought space battleships, golden holy garments, and other illogical things, was somewhat stunned, she knew every word of “Body-reporting yellow-scarved strongman”, and the concept was clear, but when combined, she didn’t quite understand it.</p><p>Speaking of such things, Yue Ziqing, who had a polite but spiritual smile on her face, seemed to have a burst of light in her eyes. The Flames burned, making her more like a living person than a puppet:</p><p>“The so-called body-reporting is simply a cultivation method that relies on the fruits of heaven and earth to get close to the Great Dao. The more in sync with the Great Dao, the greater the supernatural power. In the end, the body becomes this dao, and the era will not be extinguished, and the lifespan will not end. Of course, it will also be limited by the Great Dao of the body, and must follow the corresponding rules.”</p><p>“Therefore, as long as you can study the rules clearly and deduce the details of the Great Dao, you can directly create items with high synchronization rates. It can be a yellow-scarved strongman, or a divine spark, an ancient lamp, or a book. Our Mount Zhixu has gone through many generations and finally made a breakthrough. That was the latest type of self-sacrifice strongman. It can completely synchronize with the corresponding principles and rules of the Heaven and Earth of our side and then completely replace them. It can be triggered at any time to act on behalf of the Heaven, protect the mountain, and guard against foreign enemies. It is also the same principle on the high-rise sealed-sky platform. It is a different approach with the same effect.”</p><p>Meng Qi was stunned when he heard that. After understanding the secrets of the body-sacrificing strongman, he asked directly, “Can this body-sacrificing strongman be used outside of the Void Mountain?”</p><p>The light in Yue Ziqing’s eyes suddenly dimmed. “Although the Void Mountain is close to the real world, it was opened up by our patriarch. With the convenience of authority, we could study and try without any hindrance. However, in the real world, the synchronization rate has always been not ideal. After a few improvements, we can only make body-sacrificing strongmen at the level of celestial masters. Moreover, it is very unstable and can not be mass-produced.”</p><p>“It’s not bad…”Meng Qi said with a complicated feeling.</p><p>Although the Void Mountain was an External Dao, it had also walked a path that was lamentable. The heaven sealing platform that the human emperor’s descendants had prepared for tens of thousands of years was only two or three levels better than the body-reporting strongmen.</p><p>Yue Ziqing did not waste time. With a wave of her delicate hand, the void in front of her floated again, and two faceless Green Jade puppets appeared.</p><p>As soon as the puppets appeared, Meng Qi gasped. The cause of all karma had been touched, and he felt an obscure but familiar aura.</p><p>This was a strange object in the path of Karma!</p><p>Yue Ziqing extended her right hand and pressed it on the head of the Green Jade puppet. Then, meng qi “Saw”that the karma threads around her had broken and stuck to the body of the puppet, leaving only the part of the connection to the Void Mountain, and a new karmic connection appeared between the doll and her, allowing her remaining karma to not lose its balance and maintain the resplendent situation.</p><p>If it wasn’t for the latter, Meng Qi would definitely have seen Yue Ziqing die as if she had been struck by thousands upon thousands of blades and “Touched by Karma”.</p><p>“Receiving the Karma Jade doll on behalf of karma, our sect has researched the great success of the Dao of Karma,”Yue Ziqing introduced, “After I return to the Void Mountain from my travels, I can entrust the external connections involved to it. In this way, no matter how ingenious my calculations are, I will not be able to deduce anything from the clues left behind by our sect’s traveling disciples. Together with the chaotic characteristics of the jade puppet, I can ensure that the void mountain will not be disturbed.”</p><p>As for the effects of scapegoating, that was just a side effect.</p><p>As the “Cause of all fruits”of the current era, Meng Qi could understand the mystery. He nodded slightly and said, “Not bad, very interesting.”</p><p>Yue Ziqing’s eyes lit up again. He looked at Meng Qi and said, “Sect leader Su, do you want to try it?”</p><p>“Sure.”Meng Qi was confident enough to ensure his own safety, so he agreed with interest. He extended his right hand and pressed it on the Green Jade Doll’s head like Yue Ziqing had done before.</p><p>The Bright Star Line broke off and floated out, sticking to the top. Meng Qi was experiencing all kinds of changes.</p><p>At this moment, the green jade puppet suddenly emitted a blinding light. Black smoke came out of its seven orifices. Before Yue Ziqing could react, it broke into pieces with a bang!</p><p>It broke into pieces..</p><p>The two of them were stunned and a little lost.</p><p>Yue Ziqing’s lifeless expression was clearly relaxed. His gaze wandered back and forth between the broken pieces of the puppet and Meng Qi. Meng Qi also didn’t expect such a change. The first thought that popped up in his heart was.., how valuable is this green jade puppet? Will I have to compensate it?</p><p>After a moment of silence, Yue Ziqing returned to his original state and spoke in a tone that was even more mannequin than the puppet:</p><p>“It’s my fault. The puppet can’t even withstand the complicated star lines attached to the ‘karma’…”</p><p>That’s right. Asking the Karma puppet to help me, the ‘Karma’, place the star lines, isn’t that courting death? So, it’s not my fault, even though I didn’t deliberately control the number of star lines… Meng Qi nodded slightly, agreeing with Yue Ziqing’s conclusion.</p><p>He looked at the wreckage on the ground and changed the topic, “Miss Yue, where are we going now?”</p><p>Pay a visit to the current head of the Zhixu Mountain?</p><p>“There’s no need. The head and the elders have been arguing about their future conflicts every day recently, so we don’t have the mood to waste our time on formalities. We can just go to the secret area of the sect.”Yue Ziqing wore a polite and not angry smile.</p><p>Wasn’t this a little too simple? Meng Qi couldn’t help but feel puzzled. “Miss Yue, this matter is something I have to trouble your sect for. Do you have any requests?”</p><p>He might as well make things clear.</p><p>Yue Ziqing shook her head and said, “What we want, you definitely won’t agree. Since that’s the case, it’s not a big deal. There’s no need to think about the conditions. Anyway, the test is over there. Whether you can pass or not depends on yourself.”</p><p>Hearing her answer, Meng Qi was even more puzzled. The way the Zhi Xu Mountain acted was really hard to fathom. was this the style of the Outer Dao sixth division?</p><p>What exactly do they want? Why are they so sure that I won’t agree to it and don’t seem to mind?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
