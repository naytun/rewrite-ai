The items he mu purchased in succession arrived at Mount Kunlun smoothly through the Jade Void Express.</p><p>In the current world, he could already complete the collection of many materials without leaving the house. All he needed to do was to open the universal sign, log into the shopping mall, choose what he needed, compare and decide, and wait for the package.</p><p>He examined it for a moment, nodded his head in satisfaction, and put all of it into his mustard seed ring. Then, he walked out of the courtyard where he lived and came to the gatehouse. He saw that the great green root was looking up at the sky, absorbing the essence of the morning sun purple Qi that had been refined from the extreme yin and the extreme yang, it looked like he had just put in a lot of hard work after thousands of years of hard work.</p><p>“Senior, you’re in a good mood.”He Mu leaned against the door with a smile. He subconsciously imitated his master’s natural ease. The timing of his words was just right when the great green root’s cultivation had been perfected. It was neither too early nor too late.</p><p>The great green root felt very comfortable being called senior. He stroked his green roots and chuckled, “Little Mu, you’re also very relaxed. Aren’t you going to the monster clan’s star area to travel? Why aren’t you preparing?”</p><p>“The rest of the preparations have already been completed through the universal awareness of Heaven and earth. There’s only one thing that I’m not satisfied with. I still need senior’s help,”he mu said with a smile. His communication with others was like a flying sword. He took advantage of the opportunity when great green root was not on guard.., he went straight to the point and went straight to the palace.</p><p>Great Green Root was just about to be satisfied. He first nodded along with senior’s imposing manner. He immediately came to a realization and said in a panic, “Help? I’m just a small gatekeeper. How can I help?”</p><p>Won’t you have designs on my savings?</p><p>During this period of time, due to certain reasons that could not be disclosed to outsiders, as well as the cheap handling of things that he did not want in the past, he barely managed to get through the crisis of chopping off his hands again. He intended to invest the remaining Yuan royal coins in improving his own strength.</p><p>He Mu did not enter the door and just stood there, he smiled and said, “The most troublesome part of traveling to the monster race’s star field is to conceal one’s aura. Otherwise, a human with vigorous qi and blood would be like a star in the dark night. It would definitely be exceptionally eye-catching. Therefore, this junior thought of collecting materials and asking master to help refine a magic tool. It will be based on eighty or ninety percent of the materials and can change one’s aura to pretend to be a monster.”</p><p>“The most crucial ingredient in the materials needed for this magic tool is, of course, the aura of the tyrannical demon race.”</p><p>Great green root suddenly said, “You want to borrow my aura to use?”</p><p>“No, junior wants to borrow senior Xiao Tianquan to irrigate the soil of Senior’s Aura,”he mu tu said with a beaming smile.</p><p>Great Green Root’s branches danced wildly, and he hurriedly said, “No, no, why would I collect such dirty things!”</p><p>“Some time ago, someone anonymously auctioned similar items in the myriad realm mall. I wonder if senior knows his identity?”He Mu pretended to sigh, “Unfortunately, I was a little slow back then and didn’t spend the imperial coins I prepared.”</p><p>Great Green Root’s expression changed, and its eyes rolled. Finally, it lowered its voice and said, “They are all under the tutelage of Yuxu. Little Mu, if you are sincere, I will give up this old face to help you ask Xiao Tianquan for it…”</p><p>“Don’t worry, there will be plenty of Yuan royal coins!”He Mu did not expose him and answered firmly.</p><p>Great Green Root pretended to go out for a stroll. When he returned, he handed he mu a piece of black mud the size of a bowl cover. Although the demonic aura was faint, it had the power to soar into the sky.</p><p>He Mu understood and transferred the Yuan royal coins to great green root according to the market price. Finally, he said, “Senior, don’t worry. I dug three feet into the ground nearby to get this item.”</p><p>The great green root heaved a long sigh of relief. If this matter was spread out, how could he still have the face to be the jade void gatekeeper?</p><p>After collecting the materials, he mu passed through the courtyard and arrived outside Meng Qi’s secluded meditation room. Before he could ask for an audience, he heard his master’s voice, which seemed to come from thirty-three heavens, ring out:</p><p>“Your purpose of coming here is already clear to me. Just place the materials in front of the door.”</p><p>His master’s divine ability had become even more unfathomable after he created the serendipity in his body… he mu restrained his smile and solemnly took out the materials one by one, placing them neatly in front of the door of the meditation room.</p><p>Suddenly, that lump of black mud jumped up on its own, and green and purple flames burst out from it. The other materials were thrown in one by one, melting one after another, as if there was a colorful liquid flowing in the air.</p><p>PA!</p><p>A purple lightning crackled down, and the lump of liquid in the middle was formed by countless talisman patterns, and a hazy clear light rose up.</p><p>The clear light faded away, and there was an ancient jade pendant with dragons flying in front and phoenixes dancing in the back.</p><p>At the same time, Meng Qi’s voice fell again:</p><p>“This secret treasure, when worn on the body, can change the human’s aura into a monster, and can last for half a year. Legend has it that if you don’t pay attention, you can still hide it.”</p><p>“Master can easily forge such a magic tool. A great divine arts practitioner is indeed a great divine arts practitioner…”he mu sighed to himself. He respectfully thanked his master and caught the secret treasure that looked like a jade pendant.</p><p>After refining it for a while, he was completely prepared. He left Mount Kunlun and went deep into the grassland. Then, he borrowed a stream of red, green, yellow, white, and black sword Qi from the Li immortal sword to swirl around his body. It turned into light and shot up into the clouds.</p><p>After passing through the layers of strong winds, he mu’s vision suddenly darkened. In front of him was the dark and boundless sky. Stars like the great sun hung in the distance, emitting a pure white and dazzling light. All kinds of curses and poisonous lights were fierce around him, if it weren’t for the protection of the divine weapon and Sword Light, he mu felt that he wouldn’t be able to resist for long.</p><p>In the starry sky, what he saw was completely different from what he saw when he looked up at the Earth. He Mu spent a little effort to deduce the celestial phenomenon before he was able to figure out the direction. The sword light was like a shooting star, cutting through the sky and shooting towards the demon race’s star field.</p><p>After a full ten days, the scene before his eyes suddenly brightened. A strange star appeared in his line of sight. It was not spherical nor round. Instead, it looked like a vast ocean that was spread out in the darkness. The water was dark green and bubbled, it was like a poisonous pool that spanned millions of miles.</p><p>Due to the existence of it and the star on the left, the void nearby was pulled and twisted. The seemingly smooth path of darkness was filled with danger as if it was covered by layers of curtains.</p><p>He Mu knew that the stars might have legendary-level demon grand saints, which were where their abodes were. Hence, he restrained his aura and planned to blend in inconspicuously.</p><p>At this moment, the curtains formed by the changes in the void in front of him opened layer by layer. A towering ship that was as tall as a mountain appeared. Waves of demonic aura spread from within, forming a dense fog that surrounded the surroundings.</p><p>Just as he mu was about to avoid it, a magnetic and pleasant female voice came from the ship from afar:</p><p>“Which race is in front of us?”</p><p>He Mu’s expression did not change as he replied telepathically, “The sun-devouring race.”</p><p>“So it’s a friend of the heavenly dog race. I’m a member of the Heavenly Phoenix race in my fantasy. It’s indeed fate that brought us together. Why don’t we get on the ship and have a chat?”The female voice invited him forcefully in a manner that could not be rejected.</p><p>He Mu pondered for a moment and decided to wait and see since it was his first time here. Thus, he nodded slightly and said,</p><p>“I will do as you say.”</p><p>The sword light descended, passed through the dense fog and layers of forbidden spells, and landed on the deck of the ship, revealing he mu’s figure.</p><p>As far as his eyes could see, there were demon strongmen with human bodies and beast heads. There were also beautiful and gentle maidservants who each had some characteristics of demons, such as Fox Tails, bird wings, and cat ears. They surrounded a young girl in a crimson dress, her noble and elegant temperament was natural, and her beauty far surpassed the others.</p><p>Beside the young girl, there were also two men and a woman. Their identities were obviously different from other demons. They all had maidservants, and their auras were also strong. However, they still used the young girl as the core.</p><p>“You have a divine weapon. I wonder which Demon God descendant of the Heavenly Dog clan you are from?”The Girl in the Crimson dress asked with a smile with a solemn bearing.</p><p>As expected, it was the aura of the divine weapon that caused the trouble. Fortunately, they couldn’t tell that it was at the heaven immortal level… He Mu wasn’t surprised at all. He answered frankly, “I obtained this divine weapon by chance. I’m not a descendant of any demon god.”</p><p>The girl in front of him spoke elegantly, unlike most demons who were rude and uncultured. Her background was obviously extraordinary..</p><p>The girl hadn’t answered yet, a tall and thin man with green hair and a golden robe said in a deep voice, “Jiuli, it’s just a guy who didn’t come from a family who accidentally obtained a divine weapon. Judging from its aura, he probably hasn’t awakened his innate divine ability yet. Why are you so polite? “There’s no need to invite him to join the exploration.”</p><p>Exploration? He Mu’s heart skipped a beat, and he pretended to look at the Phoenix Girl Jiuli in confusion.</p><p>She hadn’t formed her demon body yet, so her realm was on par with his.</p><p>Jiuli maintained her elegant smile and said, “The divine weapon is a spiritual object of heaven and earth. Those who have virtue and luck will take it. The fact that this friend got one by chance is enough to prove that he has great luck. It will be of great help to our exploration.”</p><p>Without waiting for the other three to speak, she pointed at the green-haired golden-robed man and said, “This is ao Qin of the true dragon race. He is a descendant of the lesser saint of the North Pole. Although he is not yet an adult, he is the demon lord of most races.”</p><p>Ever since they returned, the demon race had compared the levels and titles of the human race in detail. They had reclassified their dharma bodies. Demon Kings were equivalent to human immortals, great demons were equivalent to Earth Immortals, demon gods were the same as Heaven Immortals, and great saints only referred to those with great ABHIJINA, the legendary great demon was known as the lesser saint, which fully demonstrated the simple and crude nature of the demons.</p><p>The lesser saint of the North Pole was a true dragon of the North Pole who had attained the Dao. When he escaped into the depths of the starry sky to sleep, he moved the Divine Mountain of the North Pole away to evolve the stars. Ao Qin was a descendant born from his interbreeding with other demons, and he was one of those that were not highly regarded.</p><p>Ao Qin did not dare to be rude to Jiuli. His face was dark as he nodded slightly as a form of greeting.</p><p>The descendant of a legendary mighty figure. No wonder he put on such a grand show… he mu suddenly returned the greeting.</p><p>“This is Gu Yue from scarlet bone tiger mountain. He is the descendant of the withered bone fire god.”Jiu Li pointed at the man with scarlet hair and the word “King”between his brows.</p><p>Withered bone fire god… never heard of him… it seemed that he was not a demon expert above the legendary level… He Mu had only heard of the great divine arts of the demon race introduced by his master. Only a few of the other experts in the carriage were famous, it seemed that skeleton was only a demon god.</p><p>Gu Yue looked down at he mu and greeted him.</p><p>“This is Fairy Jin Lin from the Immortal Moon Lake, the daughter of Emperor Dragonfish,”Jiu Li continued to introduce him.</p><p>The charming girl with a garland on her head and golden spots in her white dress seemed to be on good terms with Jiu Li. They stood very close to each other. At this moment, she nodded with a smile and did not seem to pay much attention to he mu.</p><p>Jiuli finally said, “I’m Jiuli from the Fantasy Phoenix clan. May I know how to address you, Friend?”</p><p>At this moment, fairy golden scale interrupted, “Jiuli is the direct daughter of the radiant light lesser saint. She has the pure five virtues Bloodline.”</p><p>Her eyes were filled with pride.</p><p>To be able to make the descendants of the Arctic Lesser Saint Not Dare to offend her, she really had an extraordinary background… the radiant light lesser saint? Could he be the supreme demon god that her master had dealt with before? Had she unknowingly verified the legend? Had she used the demon Emperor Hall to cover up the commotion? As he mu’s thoughts flashed through his mind, he replied without batting an eyelid, “So he is the descendant of the minor saint demon gods. I am ashamed of myself. You can just call me moonset.”</p><p>Jiu Li nodded and said, “We are here for an ancient manor. According to the records I have read, I suspect that it was left behind by the nine-headed great saint who had fallen on Mount Numinous. He was accidentally brought into the starry sky by a minor saint. When he passed away, he drifted in the depths of the universe. Due to the arrival of the apocalypse, his aura was pulled back and he returned to the vicinity.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
