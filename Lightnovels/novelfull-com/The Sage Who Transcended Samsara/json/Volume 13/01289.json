Some things never have an ending</p><p>“Brother Wang Zai has accumulated for so many years, and his majestic aura is enough to shake the heavens and the earth. It’s only a matter of time before he becomes a Daoist or a dharma body. Why do you have to control common objects? Aren’t you afraid of delaying your cultivation?”Song Quan restrained his previous loss of composure and hid his desolation, he turned his head to glance at the geisha and told her to leave the room before closing the door behind him.</p><p>Zhang Yuanli took off the ice cicada silk gloves and put them on the table leisurely. He poured himself a cup of carefree wine and said with a smile, “The Wang family inherited from the benevolent saint. It is the proper job to educate and help the world.”</p><p>“Previously, the political affairs hall and the imperial court were controlled by the aristocratic families like us. Ordinary families did not have many opportunities. They were inevitably indifferent to the academy and were not enthusiastic about it. Now that the world has changed and the Human Emperor is ruling the world, civil and martial examinations are equally important. This also gives the Wang family a chance. Wang Zai being the chief mountain chief has immeasurable benefits for the cultivation of the Great Spirit. It is also said that he can collect and refine some of the moral qi and the virtue of the Saints to lay the most powerful foundation for the Dharma Body.”</p><p>He had never been able to cross the Third Heaven Ladder and become a great grandmaster. It was difficult for him to combine the yang and yin of the “Cosmic Flaming Yang Chapter”, so he had to wear transparent gloves made of thousand-year-old ice cicada silk and other natural treasures frequently, he had to neutralize the yang energy in his body to prevent any mistakes and Qi deviation.</p><p>Song quanlue was stunned for a few seconds. Then, he sat opposite Zhang Yuanli and poured himself a cup of wine, he sighed and said, “In that generation, there were many stars. Although brother Wang Zai was in the top ten, in terms of talent and fortune, he was far inferior to the Emperor Yuan, the Devil Emperor, the supreme divine sword, and so on. I didn’t expect that he was also about to transcend the mortal world and enter the Immortal Class…”</p><p>“Hey, Brother Song. Sigh, I still call you quanlue. You are too arrogant and too obsessed with the song clan’s past glory. You Only Want to attain the dao body and restore the clan. That’s why you always blame yourself. You always hurt yourself by touching the scenery. Before you lose your composure, I’m afraid that even your inner demons have already been born.”Zhang Yuanli had a clear view of the situation, with a serious expression, he tried to persuade him, “Look at me. I’ve long since accepted reality. I’ve accepted the fact that the Zhang clan of Longnan is just an ordinary aristocratic family. From there, I’ve helped father make full use of the accumulation of the clan’s past to develop the current resources. With the help of the world’s knowledge, I’ve established many trading firms. I can be considered to have achieved something else. My life is full of color and taste. Now That I’m standing with you, it’s as if I’ve been with you for two generations!”</p><p>“But… But…”song Quan’s facial muscles were slightly distorted by Zhang Yuanli’s words, and he revealed a pained expression</p><p>“But what?”? “The human emperor has already spread the legend that in a few months, the Green Emperor will bestow the title of God and complete the great undertaking of the Human Dao. At that time, it’s unclear whether the star Lord, the Thunder God, will be conferred the title or not. At the very least, there will be no lack of star sovereign true lords. The number of legends in the Great Zhou Empire will soar. Even if you can obtain a dharma body, you’re just a mere human immortal, so what? Zhang Yuanli poured a bucket of cold water on the song clan without any hesitation. “They can let the song clan return to the status of a member of the Political Affairs Hall who has some authority over major events in the world?”.</p><p>Song quanlue’s face turned pale after hearing Zhang Yuanli’s words. After a long while, he said, “Hasn’t Emperor Qing not bestowed the title of God Yet? Who knows what kind of changes will happen…”</p><p>“Changes? What kind of changes will happen when the only important figure in the world who walks on the other shore personally makes a move?”Zhang Yuanli took a deep breath, he continued to speak, “Quanlue, our few sects missed the best era. We weren’t able to obtain a dharma body at that time, but now it has been cast far away. It’s difficult to restore the old view. It’s not something that you can catch up to by yourself. Only with the concerted efforts of our clans and generations of hard work will we have a chance.”</p><p>Song quanlue’s expression turned serious as he asked in a deep voice, “Yuanli, what do you mean by this? What should we do?”</p><p>The carefree wine in Zhang Yuanli’s hand bubbled and was already boiling, he said with a solemn expression, “Give up your pride and recognize the reality. Work hard according to the rules set by the human emperor. Those who are worried about their martial arts characters will participate in the martial arts examination. Those who are good at managing affairs will focus on the literary examination. Then, they will select talents from the rest and run the family business. They will not sit around and eat the mountain dry. With the accumulation of generations and generations, the Luyang Song clan will have connections in the imperial court again. In the future, there will be outstanding disciples who will hold high positions. Some of them will make meritorious contributions and be conferred the title of land, City God, and other clergy.”</p><p>“As long as we persevere, our family will not fall. There will always be a chance for our children to prove themselves or become star lords. There will always be a chance for the song family to regain its glory. Compared to those who come from ordinary backgrounds, or even those from ordinary aristocratic families and small sects, we have divine weapons to suppress them. We have elders who are experienced enough. We have all kinds of heavenly materials and earthly treasures. We have mineral resources, medicinal gardens, spiritual springs, fields, and so on. Why should we be afraid of not being able to compete with them?”</p><p>“There will definitely be exceptions, but the overall situation will not change!”</p><p>Song quanlue looked at Zhang Yuanli who was in a trance. After a long while, he shook his head and said with a wry smile, “A scholar should be treated differently after three days of separation. I have always been conceited and looked down on you in my heart. Who would have thought that you would be more thorough than me and do it steadily?”</p><p>“Hehe, it’s easy to say this logic, but we who have experienced glory are easily blinded by the past and turn a blind eye to it. I also met brother Wang Siyuan, and only after he gave me some advice did I suddenly become enlightened and persuade my father,”Zhang Yuanli said with a smile.</p><p>“Brother Wang Siyuan?”Song quanlue asked in surprise.</p><p>Zhang Yuanli nodded and said, “Yes, that Wang Siyuan who ‘calculated all the people’back then, the fellow who caused the Wang clan in Jiangdong to fall, who knows if he’s a genius or a lunatic!”</p><p>“He disappeared from the world after he attained Dao Arts. I didn’t expect him to still be alive…”song Quanlue couldn’t help but sigh.</p><p>Zhang Yuanli frowned slightly and said, “When I met him, other than his sickly look, he was doing well. When I said goodbye, he said that he was going to do a crazy thing. If he failed, he would die and his dao would vanish. If he succeeded, he would truly ‘calculate all the people’.”</p><p>“What happened after that?”Song Quan asked subconsciously.</p><p>Zhang Yuanli shook his head. “I never saw him again, nor did I hear any trace of him…”</p><p>Song Quan was silent for a moment, and the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes suddenly spread out. He chuckled and said, “You came from Longnan from afar, and you didn’t use the universal knowing talisman to communicate. I’m afraid that you wouldn’t visit the Three Treasures Palace for no reason, right?”</p><p>“Haha, for a business deal.”Zhang Yuanli laughed loudly. “I don’t dare to deceive you. I Can’t block the back Earth Life and death sword and the virtuous object-carrying saber!”</p><p>At this point, his face turned serious. “The nine-leaf sun-returning grass only grows in the south province and Huan Province near the South Wilderness. It’s a good material to refine longevity-extending pills. The goods of the South Province have always been controlled by your Luyang Song clan, and Huan Province, after all these years of evolution and integration, finally belongs to the Tang family of the Yi City. They don’t want to compete with brother Quanlue’s family needlessly, and it just so happens that a business deal involves my family. Therefore, they invited me to be a lobbyist. I hope that everyone can take out the nine-leaf sun-returning grass and the corresponding pill business and establish a new business, and your family will be respected.”</p><p>“Of course, my family also wants to get involved.”</p><p>Song Quan pondered for a moment and said, “The Tang family of Yi city was not well-known before. which family or faction is behind it?”</p><p>“Yes, the Wang family of Zhou County and the Huan Hua Sword sect have taken good care of the Tang family of Yi City,”Zhang Yuanli said frankly.</p><p>Song Quan Thought for a moment and said, “Then invite the guests of the Tang family in. Let’s have a face-to-face talk.”</p><p>Zhang Yuanli clapped his hands and smiled. He stood up, opened the door, and walked out. A moment later, he entered together with a beautiful woman dressed in palace attire.</p><p>“This is the head of the Tang family, Fairy Tang Mingyue,”Zhang Yuanli introduced.</p><p>Tang Mingyue retained the bright eyes and white teeth of her youth, but she had the maturity and elegance accumulated over time. The fine lines at the corners of her eyes added an indescribable charm to her. Upon hearing this, she bowed and said, “Greetings, head of the song family.”</p><p>Song Quan gave her a deep look and said with emotion, “The Tang family of Yi City was unknown before, and was not famous outside of Huan Prefecture. However, under Fairy Tang’s hands, they rose abruptly and grew rapidly. I am truly impressed.”</p><p>These words were said with emotion and sincerity. It actually touched Tang Mingyue for a moment, and she had mixed feelings.</p><p>When she took over the Tang family, it was not just that she was not famous outside of Huan Prefecture. Few people knew that she had left Zhou Prefecture. After so many years of hardship, she finally met a good time: the Demon Emperor spread the news in front of the exterior location, allowing her to cultivate peerless cultivation techniques and solidify her foundation, he successfully broke through to the external scenery, and when he needed to expand his influence, he inexplicably received the help of the Wang family of Zhou Prefecture and the Huan Hua Sword sect, the two giants of Huan Prefecture, to establish his family business. After the human emperor set up the heaven sealing platform, the Supreme Dao oversaw all aspects, the rules of the Great Zhou Dynasty went deep into the rich families and sects, allowing him to be spared from many sinister methods.</p><p>In the past few decades, he had racked his brains for the Tang family, and his hard work was not enough for outsiders to know. Even if he had both his children and his family affairs, he would often wake up in the middle of the night.</p><p>Of course, the Tang family’s prosperity began when his brother returned. But after he left again, he completely disappeared from the world, as if he had never appeared.</p><p>He had searched for decades and finally gave up. At the same time, he understood one thing:</p><p>Some things will never have an ending, and some doubts will never have an answer.</p><p>With this kind of emotion, Tang mingyue sat to the side and discussed the nine-leaf sun returning grass with song Quan.</p><p>The world was changing, and the general situation was changing. Some families had fallen, and others had risen!</p><p>Just like the Su clan in Shen ‘Du.</p><p>Gu Changqing was one of the thirty-six divine constables of the Great Zhou’s six doors organization. He had a high position and authority. Moreover, he had been around for half a year and had a deep background. His subordinates didn’t dare to be disrespectful.</p><p>“Good morning, divine constables Gu.”A golden-badge constable saw Gu Changqing, who was in charge of the affairs of the six doors organization in Shen ‘Du, come over. He quickly cupped his hands and saluted.</p><p>This master had always abhorred evil as his enemy, so he couldn’t do anything wrong in front of him.</p><p>Gu Changqing nodded slightly with a smile on his face. “Act as usual today. If there’s anything unusual, use the universal common sense amulet to communicate.”</p><p>With that, he walked out of the former headquarters of the six doors and headed toward the ancestral residence of the Su clan in the Shen ‘Du region.</p><p>Divine constable gu actually left so early… that golden-badge constable was dumbstruck.</p><p>He had heard that Madam Tang had recently given birth to a girl, so that was really the case..</p><p>Gu Changqing’s face had been beaming the entire time, and the smile did not fade in the slightest on the way into the courtyard.</p><p>He had just picked up that cute baby girl and turned around to chat with his wife, Tang Ziyue, when his eldest son, Gu Sutong, who was five or six years old, stumbled in. He said with a puzzled expression, “Mother, mother, I have something to ask you.”</p><p>In order for Tang Ziyue to smoothly cross the second level of the stairway, they had only started to think about the future generations in the last ten years.</p><p>“What is it?”Tang Ziyue smiled faintly and stroked the top of her son’s head.</p><p>Gu sutong frowned and asked, “They often say that my uncle is so-and-so, but hasn’t my uncle always been at home?”</p><p>Gu Changqing coaxed his daughter while listening to his wife’s words with a smile:</p><p>“They are referring to your second uncle…”</p><p>“Him? He is an indomitable, unparalleled hero…”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
