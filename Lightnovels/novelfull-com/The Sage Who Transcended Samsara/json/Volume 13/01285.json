Looking at the hill-like object surrounded by clear light and dense mist, he mu felt his heartbeat involuntarily change as it slowly expanded and contracted, unable to be controlled no matter how hard he tried, he gradually felt dizzy, dizzy, and weak.</p><p>More importantly, all of this happened under the premise that he was surrounded and protected by the Li Immortal Sword’s five-colored sword lights — red, green, yellow, white, and black!</p><p>At this moment, he suddenly heard two sounds that shook his mind. One was like a roar, like a whistle. It was vast and majestic, oppressing all living things. The other was a light and sonorous cry, as if it had descended from the nine heavens. It was beautiful and pleasant to the ear.</p><p>The Dragon’s Roar and Phoenix’s cry circled around and circled around. It was as if a whirlwind had blown up on the spot, dissipating all the strange effects brought by the hill-like ancient thing. Jiu Li and Ao Qin saw that the situation was not good, with the help of the five Virtues Heaven and earth fan and the immortal sword that looked like an ice soul, they issued the unique divine sounds of their own race!</p><p>He Mu’s mind became clear. He got out of the state that was close to fainting. He frowned and said solemnly,</p><p>“This thing is far more magical than the level of a demon king. I’m afraid that we are not strong enough. If we force our way forward, we might lose our lives on the spot. Why don’t we retreat for the time being and wait for you to report what you have seen and heard to your elders before making a decision?”</p><p>Was this an opportunity or danger?</p><p>He Mu, who had always been cautious, felt that he shouldn’t take the risk recklessly under the strange influence just now.</p><p>Jiu Li and the other demons had a rather strange expression on their faces. After looking at each other, they all nodded their heads slightly. Then, Jiu Li turned her head to look at He Mu, she gave him an embarrassed smile. “Mr. Yue Luo, please rest assured. I will definitely give you an equal share of the gains from before. If there are any leftovers later, I will give priority to you as well.”</p><p>“What do you mean?”He Mu immediately felt that something was wrong and asked in a low voice.</p><p>Jiu Li’s expression became serious. “After seeing this matter, we understand that this mission has been successfully completed. What happens next is not something that we can interfere with.”</p><p>He Mu’s heart stirred. He seemed to have understood something and said with hesitation, “You mean…”</p><p>Jiu Li did not wait for him to finish speaking, she nodded slightly and said, “We are all prepared to set up an altar to invite the gods to descend. We have already refined the corresponding items in advance. Even in the primordial immortal world fragment, in the nine-headed Grand Sage’s cave abode, as long as there is no restriction and a strong enough barrier, we can still summon the elders of the various families to descend a portion of their powers. They can act through space and remove the danger in front of them, opening up the clear light and dense mist.”</p><p>After that, her thoughts fluctuated, she added subconsciously, “Of course, such a move will not escape the attention of those who have intentions. It will attract all kinds of variables, so it can only be used at the last moment. At that time, even if those who have intentions realize it, from tracing the source to penetrating the forbidden technique, crossing the wilderness, climbing the Divine Mountain, and defeating all kinds of spiritless demon gods, it will take time. It will be too slow and urgent, and we won’t be able to interfere or stop them… we really didn’t deliberately hide it before. It’s really not the time when we need it.”</p><p>This was what he should have meant… after he mu heard Jiu Li’s explanation, this was the first thought that popped up in his mind.</p><p>I knew it was impossible for the little saint demon gods to entrust such an important matter to their descendants. Aren’t they afraid that something might go wrong?</p><p>Immediately after, he Mu’s emotions surged. After weighing his current strength, he felt mixed emotions, with a bitter smile, he sighed, “Being able to get the Little Sage Demon God to open the barrier in front of me gives me a certain hope of obtaining great benefits. Furthermore, the items I obtained previously have also been promised. What other opinions can I have?”</p><p>His thoughts whirled as he racked his brains. However, he could not find any similar instructions or hints from his master. Hence, he was a wise man who knew how to adapt to the situation. More importantly, he could not do anything to the strange thing in front of him by himself.</p><p>Jiuli comforted him, but there was only a sigh left on the tip of her tongue. Then, she took out an ancient altar with five colors flowing in it from her mustard seed ring and placed it in front of her, she arranged the mottled stones, gorgeous feathers, clear water that flowed into a vortex, and other items in the corresponding positions. Finally, she embedded the five virtues universe fan in the core center. The whole process was just a simple assembly, and it only took a few breaths of time.</p><p>At the same time, Ao Qin, Gu Yue, and the golden scale fairy also used the ice soul longsword, the copper rust twin rings, and the golden scale whip as the starting point to set up the altars to ‘invite the God to descend’.</p><p>He Mu watched coldly from the side and quietly took many steps back. The disguise of his aura could not hide from the scrutiny of the legendary almighty when he was focused. He had to avoid it a little.</p><p>Of course, the other party had only descended with a part of his power. If he did not arrive with his real body, the possibility of him seeing through it was very slim. Such a move could only be taken as a precaution.</p><p>Jiuli’s expression became solemn as she ascended the five-colored flowing altar. Her right hand formed a sword and pointed at the five Virtues Heaven and earth fan.</p><p>All of a sudden, purple, white, green, black, and black, as well as black and yellow water, lit up simultaneously. They spiraled up along the altar and eventually converged into a fountain, condensing into an illusory door covered in mysterious patterns.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>The door opened abruptly, and an illusory and realistic finger extended out from the inside. The surrounding light gathered and condensed into a divine pagoda that was thirty-three stories tall. It directly suppressed the object that was slowly expanding and contracting.</p><p>Soundlessly, the “White Cloud Meridians”that looked like blood vessels on the periphery disintegrated inch by inch. Like collapsed buildings, they spread toward the core. All kinds of dangerous shadows that were hidden disappeared after black and yellow swept through them, one by one, they disappeared into thin air.</p><p>On the other side, the clouds above Ao Qin’s head formed a vast white “Ocean.”It spun and cracked, revealing a huge mouth with dragon whiskers. It spat out torrents of ice crystals, and wherever it passed.., everything froze. The world was pure white, as beautiful as a dream, and cold to the heart. The clear light surrounding the hill-like things instantly froze into ice.</p><p>The fierce wind around Gu Yue whistled, transforming into a dry bone covered in pale white flames. The fire borrowed the wind’s momentum and suddenly expanded, burning toward the thing that exuded an ancient aura in a sweeping manner. The blue underfoot of the golden scale fairy surged, a crimson gold object that was as big as a lake flew out, following closely behind the flame.</p><p>The two combined and immediately shattered the clear light that had turned into an ice wall, as if rain was falling from the sky.</p><p>Waves of majestic and imposing aura reverberated. He Mu saw that the hill-like object only lasted for a few moments before it collapsed.</p><p>Rumble!</p><p>Streams of clear light shot out from within, and layers of dense mist spread outwards. The entire “Hill”was like an egg that had been shattered, and soon, the thing at the core was revealed.</p><p>It was drops of blood that were clearly separated but tangled together. They were ancient and weathered, and there was a hint of darkness in the redness, as if they were the reflection of the void, the sense of their existence alone had slowed down the heaven, earth, yellow, exquisite pagoda, Ice Soul Divine Aura, skeleton, white flames, and immortal-slaying golden scales that were suppressing the ‘hill’on their own. At the same time, they seemed to be thousands of miles away from their target as if they were trapped in a swamp, no one knew when they would arrive.</p><p>The drops of blood that were slowly fusing with each other began to disintegrate with the impact of external forces and the interruption of the nurturing process. They turned back into flawless, perfect blood-colored balls that floated in mid-air, it seemed like they would fall apart at any moment!</p><p>It seemed like the nine-headed worm wanted to use these drops of ancient blood to nurture something, but it had already fallen on the Spirit Mountain. There were no more supplies after that, so they had yet to completely fuse with each other even after countless years… He Mu’s mind wavered, he seemed to have somewhat understood the arrangement of the ancient Demon God Nine Phoenix and the reason for the current situation.</p><p>It was rumored that mighty figures were extremely powerful. However, in an instant, the heaven earth profound yellow exquisite pagoda and the Ice Soul Divine Aura did their best to break free from their restraints and were about to grab at the different ancient blood.., jiuli, Ao Qin, and the other demons could not help but smile.</p><p>The matter was about to be completed, but there were no changes!</p><p>At this moment, the immemorial immortal world suddenly darkened, as if something bad had happened. The Golden Pagoda strangely stopped in mid-air. Without any follow-up, it slowly disintegrated!</p><p>The Ice Soul Divine Aura, the withered bone white flame, and the immortal slaying Golden Scale also lost their corporeal forms. They returned to their illusory forms and gradually dissipated.</p><p>“What’s Wrong?”</p><p>All the creatures in this place, including he mu, widened their eyes. They were all at a loss.</p><p>..</p><p>In the fantasy sky, the five virtues Phoenix, who was sitting quietly in the pavilion, suddenly opened its eyes and said in surprise and bewilderment,</p><p>“The connection is broken…”</p><p>The connection between him and the altar that invited the God to come was broken!</p><p>In other words, he couldn’t transfer the power to the altar!</p><p>In the depths of a planet-like mountain formed by Ice Souls, the Dragon’s roar echoed in the starry sky. The anger in his voice was obvious:</p><p>“Who cut off the connection?”</p><p>..</p><p>In the hollow jade temple of Kunlun Mountain, Meng Qi’s eyes were still half-open. Only a black and white divine light was shooting out faintly!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
