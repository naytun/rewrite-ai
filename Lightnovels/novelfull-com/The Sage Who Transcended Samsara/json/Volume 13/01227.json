It was like a mirror reflecting the various things around it. There was the unworldly green emperor from the many branches of the future, the green-and-blue medicine master Wang Fo, the Taiyi heavenly venerate with a bamboo crown on his head, and the pure Yangzi, there was the Dongyang divine lord. From the past to the present, from the present to the future, the green emperor seemed to have concentrated on this fruit.</p><p>Just as it approached the ‘Splendid Mountain and river painting’that enveloped the heaven-sealing platform, it resonated slightly with the ancient tree that was shaped like fusang above the Green Emperor’s head. It penetrated the resonance of time.</p><p>Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!</p><p>The fruit trembled violently and seemed to become illusory. It penetrated the ‘Splendid Mountain and river painting’in an instant and fell into the current node of the illusory long river. It landed on the auspicious cloud green tree.</p><p>Crash!</p><p>The entire long river of time surged with monstrous waves. It was like a huge snake arching its back, causing the surrounding space and time to sink into a black and white stagnation. The fruit suddenly shattered and turned into tiny mirrors that reflected the heavens and the myriad worlds, it revealed the past and the future. It was also like the Supreme Heavenly Mirror and the Donghuang Bell!</p><p>The mirrors scattered and fused with the ancient green tree that was brimming with vitality. They hung on the branches and formed one fruit after another that seemed to be condensed from the Great Dao.</p><p>All of this happened in an instant. Then, the ancient Greenwood tree covered with strange fruits flew out from the auspicious clouds and fell into the river of time. It went against the flow and passed through the ancient times until it reached the side of the Medicine Master King Buddha.</p><p>The river water immediately calmed down and flowed quietly. It remained unchanged since ancient times. The Bodhi of withering and flourishing behind the medicine master king Buddha was infused with the rich vitality of the Greenwood tree. It turned green once again and was completely connected to the current.</p><p>The green wood ancient tree was still tracing back. It passed by Chun Yangzi, the East Yang Divine Lord, the Taiyi Celestial Master of salvation, and came to the side of the green emperor during the period of the five ancient emperors. Wherever it passed, the time ripples disappeared and the tremors subsided, the turbulent long river was peaceful and ancient.</p><p>The green wood ancient tree continued forward. It went up against the current from the peak of the Green Emperor. It passed by him, who was only a well-known figure in the destiny realm. It passed by him, who had obtained the remains of the primordial Supreme Heavenly Mirror. It passed by him, who had just entered the destiny realm when he was born, the scenes replayed one after another. “Emperor Qing”returned to a green fruit that was filled with the power of wood element and rich vitality. The fruit rose from the ground and hung on the branches. It gradually shrank and returned to its original body.</p><p>The original body was the fusang ancient tree!</p><p>It used the blood of the Heavenly God and the supreme one of the Eastern Emperor as its foundation. It absorbed the broken era as nutrients and merged the vitality and wood of the five elements from the beginning of the current era. It “Gave birth”to Emperor Qing, who was an innate god who held a part of the authority!</p><p>It was the beginning, the opportunity, and the attainment of the Dao!</p><p>The ancient Fusang tree exuded the aura of a new era and the reopening of the universe. It was very similar to Meng Qi’s “Tree of the Great Dao”. No Wonder Emperor Qing mistook the tree of the great dao as “It”, from then on, he realized who he was!</p><p>Back at the beginning of the new era, the waves of the river of time had completely calmed down. Medicine Master King Buddha got rid of the influence of the “Bodhi of wither and glory”and “Amitabha”. He leaped out of the illusory river again and into the chaotic void, he sat in the Lotus position and announced grandly,</p><p>“I am Green Emperor.”</p><p>“I am Tai Hao.”</p><p>The heavenly venerate of primordial unity and salvation also leaped out of the river of time. Chun Yangzi, East Yang Divine Lord, and other figures flew up densely. They shouted at the same time,</p><p>“I am Green Emperor.”</p><p>“I am Tai Hao.”</p><p>Green Emperor’s figure rose slowly, allowing the figures of the past to fly over. It allowed the illusory images of many tributaries in the future to leap out as well. They overlapped and suddenly contracted, fusing into green emperor’s elegant and graceful body!</p><p>The world instantly became dark. There was no white or black, nothing could be seen. Even the sense of the flow of time had disappeared. The Great Dao seemed to have descended, giving the green emperor the final “Test”, however, all of this was not something that Meng Qi could experience.</p><p>The first type of the higan phenomenon, “Heaven and Earth Chaos”!</p><p>Following that, a beam of green light shone, illuminating the entire universe. It enveloped every part of the myriad realms in the heavens in a gentle light, except for the highest level of the nine heavens and the lowest level of the nine underworld.</p><p>The second type of the higan phenomenon, “Illuminating the ten directions”!</p><p>The deeper the foundation, the more places it illuminated.</p><p>The light changed and turned into green ancient trees, bearing dark and pale green fruits. Each fruit seemed to contain space and time.</p><p>Life was released, and the imperial liquid spilled down. In the real world, all living things were flourishing, and there was a certain degree of rejuvenation. Many spirits and demons had gained intelligence, and many humans had improved their aptitude.</p><p>The third type of abnormal phenomena on the other shore, the manifestation of the Great Dao!</p><p>These abnormal phenomena were formed from the great items that one had mastered and produced half a “Fruit.”There were a total of one yuan, and they were respectively “Ten Thousand Buddhas dynasty,””Illusory bubble,””Five virtues become phoenixes,””The alternation of time,”and so on, “All Immortals Welcome,””The universe turns into a book,””Spiritual treasures hold swords,””Morals ride oxen,”and so on.</p><p>Not all of these phenomena had been proven by others. Because for many eras, there were very few who could reach the other side. Most of them were the result of the deductions of the big figures on the other side. But they were enough to be sure that there could be two or even three of these phenomena at the same time, and three!</p><p>And the green emperor used the wood element and life force as the foundation. He combined the way of the Supreme Heavenly Mirror and the Donghuang Bell. Hence, there was the phenomenon of “Rejuvenating green wood”!</p><p>When the third phenomenon appeared, the “Amitabha”sound in the sky disappeared. The Life and Death Bodhi in the Dongfang glazed pure land returned to its original state. There was a clear aura that dissipated. The higan golden bridge retracted and turned into the Taiji diagram, when it landed in the golden-horned boy’s hands, the grand sages retracted the five-colored divine light and quickly escaped from this world. Nezha was so angry that he gritted his teeth.</p><p>Demon ox king shook the mountain river map in his hand and threw it out of the nine spirits original saint. Then, he disappeared without looking back, not giving the nine-headed lion a chance to take revenge. Yuan Hong put away his iron rod and sank down to hide beside the Qingping Sword, he hid in the strange blood and made the Golden Ao island disappear again.</p><p>The immortal-slaying formation shook and suddenly disappeared. The four immortal swords, the Great Wisdom Sword, and the heaven-turning seal flew back into the sky. The Sea of bitterness formed by the burning lamp ancient Buddha turned into an illusion. The Faint Golden Buddha palm also disappeared and the demon lord directly turned into an illusion, it entered the mind and spirit world and used this to disappear..</p><p>The situation was set. Looking back, they could no longer stop the Azure Emperor. All the opposing forces tacitly stopped and returned to their own homes to avoid becoming the sacrificial sabers of the new shore.</p><p>At this time, Zhao Heng’s expression was twisted and he was struggling. He was fighting with the son of Yama for the control of the heaven sealing platform, the god Ascension Board, and the Ghost God True Spirit diagram.</p><p>In the sky full of green wood, the ninth heaven and the ninth underworld were about to feel the “Resonance”and reveal their own uniqueness.</p><p>Meng Qi’s heart skipped a beat. He didn’t have time to control the three treasures he had condensed to drill through the “Splendid Mountain and river picture”. Instead, he circulated the cause and effect of all the fruits in an attempt to grasp the traces of the third level of the ninth heaven and enter the Gray Stone Hall, he ascended to the highest level.</p><p>At this moment, the pure aura that emanated from the “Bodhi of Withering and glory”behind Medicine Guru Buddha condensed into a Bodhi tree branch embedded with the seven treasures of Buddhism. Although it wasn’t illusory, it was crystal clear and shone with a brilliant light. With a light brush.., the God Ascension Roll and the Ghost God true spirit diagram were brushed out of the heaven-sealing platform!</p><p>Buzz!</p><p>Amidst the tremors, the Ninth Heaven and the ninth Netherworld disappeared abruptly. The god Ascension roll fell into Zhao Heng’s arms, and the Ghost God True Spirit Diagram returned to the netherworld. A clear and elegant voice sounded in their ears:</p><p>“It’s not the time yet.”</p><p>Heaven’s will was unpredictable, and success or failure was imminent. Both Yan Luo and Zhao Heng couldn’t help but feel depressed, but Zhao Heng didn’t dare to delay. He immediately jumped out of the heaven sealing platform, taking advantage of the fact that Gao Lan was still stabilizing his realm, shao Xuan and Xi e were attracted by the ‘Green Wood returning to its old age’, and they used the power of the Demon Emperor’s claw to escape.</p><p>The green wood disappeared, and a shrunken illusory river appeared in the air, circling around Emperor Qing. It was slightly different from the river of time and fate from before.</p><p>This was the river of time that the other side had to look back to time and possess the future — the river of time in his real world had finally taken shape!</p><p>The fourth type of abnormal phenomenon on the other side, “Time around the body”, was an image that could be witnessed by all.</p><p>..</p><p>When he saw the three treasures ruyi, the names of the Saint Buddha and the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning echoed in his mind, Han Guang suddenly felt the ripples of time in this place, and then fell into the chaos of Heaven and earth.</p><p>“The green emperor is about to attain the Dao?”Han Guang’s eyes turned cold and he woke up. He no longer hesitated. He took the “Bodhi magical tree”and left without looking back.</p><p>If he missed the opportunity, it would never come again!</p><p>Now, he could only accept his failure calmly. If he struggled any longer, he would die miserably at the hands of the Green Emperor. Moreover, without the Bodhi magical tree, the three-treasure Ruyi alone, and the aura and power of the Devil Buddha could still stir up trouble.</p><p>However, why was the Three Treasures Ruyi below the Bodhi tree and not above it?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
