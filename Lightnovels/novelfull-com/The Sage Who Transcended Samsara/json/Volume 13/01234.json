It dyed the gray stone temple with a warm yellow glow, spreading to every corner, dissipating the darkness of the nine underworld and the demonic mist.</p><p>Xulun and Bran immediately felt as if their entire bodies were illuminated. The Darkness in their hearts was cleared bit by bit, and they both felt an unprecedented peace, as well as an uneasiness that came from the bottom of their hearts. Their eyes were tightly shut, and they took a few steps back, they wanted to avoid the illumination of the green lamp.</p><p>This was an irreconcilable contradiction between their natural instincts and this state. It was as if the vengeful spirits and ghosts had encountered an object of extreme yang and righteousness. Their entire bodies actually felt as if they were bathed in light and were about to melt!</p><p>If not for the peace and tranquility that filled their hearts, the two asuras would probably have let out shrill screams.</p><p>The Man in the dark red robe covered his eyes with his hands as if he had returned to his childhood. He had fought against a zombie that was skilled in evil arts. He had used the method of mutual destruction to attract the true fire of the Sun, and the demonic Qi had melted, he almost turned into green smoke.</p><p>After a short period of adaptation, he narrowed his eyes and looked at Meng Qi’s back standing in front of the green lamp. He asked in a deep voice, “Is it the Buddha who has attained the Dao Fruit?”</p><p>“Yes, I have dealt with him before. I would not mistake the unique feeling of the stone temple,”Meng Qi said in an ancient tone, as if he was reminiscing about the past and the extraordinary years.</p><p>Had he dealt with Buddha? Was he the incarnation of one of the few Old Immortals in the netherworld? The Man in the dark red robe felt his heart tighten. He subconsciously took a step back and pulled away.</p><p>According to the perception of his innate divine ability, the other party was not lying!</p><p>Meng Qi did not answer. His gaze was still fixed on the Faceless Buddha. He said to himself, “He built these stone temples, as if to seal and suppress something.”</p><p>Of course, he had dealt with the Buddha before. He had obtained the green lamp in front of the Buddha, learned the tathagata divine palm, witnessed the golden cicada shedding its shell, and witnessed the Supreme True Buddha. How could he not have dealt with the Buddha before?</p><p>“There are indeed many rumors about terrifying existences being sealed.”The Man in the dark red robe was on high alert and spoke concisely. “But what does this have to do with the whereabouts of the reincarnation of the Netherworld?”</p><p>“Of course it has something to do with it.”Meng Qi turned around with his hands behind his back and stood under the faceless Buddha as he spoke calmly, “If the clue to the reincarnation of the Netherworld is broken here, the only thing that can witness its passing and know its whereabouts after that can only be the thing that has always been suppressed here.”</p><p>Speaking up to this point, he let out a long sigh, he said in an old-fashioned manner, “Unfortunately, the Buddha’s seal is not something that you and I can break. If we can’t find a corresponding method, I’m afraid that we’ll have to find a genuine person on the other side. It’s better to continue searching for other clues nearby.”</p><p>As he said, he shook his head. In a few flashes, the brocade robe disappeared outside the stone temple.</p><p>The Man in the dark red robe felt the same. He stepped into the wilderness and faced the black sun. He passed through the demonic mist and quickly disappeared.</p><p>Xulun and Bran looked at each other as they listened. Seeing that they were strangely ignored, they felt like they were in a dream.</p><p>“That strange man is actually the reincarnation of the ancient evil God, the netherworld? He returned when the Apocalypse Came?”Bran muttered.</p><p>They belonged to a certain tribe of the Asura clan and occupied a nearby area. Therefore, they were not the only two who had seen the reincarnation of the netherworld. Many powerful figures in the clan had seen it, however, there were countless strange things in the netherworld. The appearance of the reincarnation of the Netherworld was simply ordinary. No one felt anything special about it. They only thought that it was an evil demon that had entered by mistake, they regretted not finding a chance to kill it back then.</p><p>Today, after hearing the conversation, Bran knew that it was actually the reincarnation of the ancient evil God, the netherworld. He was the ruler of the rolling netherworld!</p><p>Red sweat beaded on Xulun’s forehead. He looked at the Faceless Buddha and the green lamp in horror. “So it was cultivated by the Buddha of Lingshan. What exactly is it to suppress…”</p><p>Blanc restrained his nature and gritted his teeth. “This is an important matter. Let’s quickly go to the sacred mountain and report to the ancestor!”</p><p>Two beams of light rose up and quickly swept across the dark red and nearly black wilderness. They first returned to the tribe and reported to the leader. Then, under the guidance of the leader, they passed through the Boorish Demon Mountain and arrived at a mountain peak that looked like a sharp tooth.</p><p>The mountain peak was dark red and seemed to be soaked in blood every moment of every day. There were heads, incomplete bodies, and broken limbs everywhere.</p><p>This was the Holy Mountain of the Asura clan. The experts in the real world often used the term “Asura battlefield”to describe it.</p><p>After the leader reported the matter to the Guardian Divine Guards, he waited for a moment before a black-red light descended and enveloped him, Xu Lun, and Bran.</p><p>The red light dissipated and they found themselves in a dark palace where the sun could not be seen. In front of them were piles of white bones covered with the skin peeled off from the bodies of various creatures. There were demons, monsters, and humans. Together, they built a throne for slaughter and battle.</p><p>The black gas was distorted, and its specific form could not be seen. Sitting on the throne, it rubbed the various eyeballs inlaid on the armrest. Its voice was like a blunt knife, stirring and cutting the hearts of every listener:</p><p>“Tell me everything that happened from the beginning to the end. Do not miss any details.”</p><p>This was the first Asura that was born not long after the birth of the netherworld. It was a demigod and a demi-demon. It was extremely powerful, and was strong enough to fight against a great divine arts practitioner in the Netherworld.</p><p>He permanently cut off his left hand and created the first female Asura. Hence, there was the current Asura clan, who collectively called him the ancestor.</p><p>He was already too old. He was so old that he had not left the throne of slaughter and battle for a long time. He was so old that many of the powerhouses of his generation had died of old age.</p><p>The Netherworld involved life and death and implicated the origin. This was what he cared about when he was looking for a step forward to get rid of his current state.</p><p>In order to live until now, he had almost sealed himself. The passage of his lifespan was abnormally slow.</p><p>As Xulun and Bran complemented each other, the asura primogenitor, whose form could not be seen, listened quietly as if he had fallen into a deep sleep again.</p><p>After a long time, he said coldly,</p><p>“Why didn’t I Kill You?”</p><p>How could the evil gods, demons, and vengeful spirits be soft-hearted and not know how to silence people?</p><p>Bran couldn’t raise his head. He lowered his head deeply and said in a panic, “Maybe it’s because the Buddhist intent in the stone temple is far-reaching and has eliminated their killing intent.”</p><p>“Leave,”the asura primogenitor said calmly and didn’t comment.</p><p>As Xulun and Bran left, the Dark Hall returned to its dead silence that hadn’t changed for ten thousand years.</p><p>..</p><p>The Man in the dark red robe was a rising star of the Netherworld Sea Race. He called himself the “Bloody Massacre Daoist”to show his intention to catch up with the Heavenly Massacre Daoist.</p><p>He searched for a long time in the nearby wilderness until the black sun set and the Dark Moon Rose. The demonic fog became denser and the ice wind rose. He was suddenly shocked. “I didn’t kill those two Asura. I let them leave after they heard about the incident in the Netherworld!”</p><p>This was simply not his usual style!</p><p>“Is it the influence of the mysterious old man? But what good would it do him to spread the secret of the reincarnation of the Netherworld?”Daoist bloody massacre thought with a frown, “Could it be that the stone temple built by the Buddha of Mount Lingshan has dispelled my killing intent?”? “At that time, my mind was indeed calm and there was no killing intent… when I first killed the hundred-armed evil demon, this feeling was not obvious until the stone green lamp was lit… it seems that the mysterious old man was also affected by the will of the green lamp and Buddha…”</p><p>Daoist bloody massacre turned into a streak of red light and passed through the Black Fog and the wilderness, rushing toward the nearby Asura tribe to make up for his mistake and kill the previous two and eliminate all living beings nearby.</p><p>Just as the red light was not close enough to the asura, it saw the black fog in front of it churning and condensing into a blurry black shadow. The sound of a dull knife scraping was like a needle piercing:</p><p>“Get lost!”</p><p>The sound shook the Heart Lake. The Bloody Massacre Daoist felt his killing intent being suppressed. His body and mind trembled. He immediately turned his head and fled far away, not daring to stay any longer.</p><p>The old undying Asura tribe had actually broken the silence of many years and revealed himself!</p><p>It seemed that he knew the secret of the reincarnation of the Netherworld!</p><p>However, this old immortal’s lifespan was exhausted, so he probably didn’t dare to attack with all his strength. He still had a chance!</p><p>The riverbank of the Netherworld returned to normal, with ghostly wails and mournful scenes.</p><p>..</p><p>After a few days, in the middle of the night, a black figure suddenly appeared in the limestone temple.</p><p>He was an old man with white and sparse hair, and the wrinkles on his skin could kill a mosquito. His eyes were cloudy, and his teeth were withered. He gave people a very old feeling, as if he would die on the spot at any time, only the third blood-red crystal-clear eye on his forehead showed that he was not an ordinary person.</p><p>This was the incarnation of the Asura primogenitor!</p><p>He took a step forward and walked in front of the Faceless Buddha. With a stroke of his right hand, he lit up the green lamp.</p><p>Light illuminated the three realms and spread in all directions. In the dim yellow and warm light, the asura primogenitor suddenly said,</p><p>“Come out.”</p><p>A faint smile was heard, and a white-spotted old man wearing a brocade robe suddenly appeared. It was Meng Qi. He said in a relaxed tone,</p><p>“I’ve been waiting for you for a long time.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
