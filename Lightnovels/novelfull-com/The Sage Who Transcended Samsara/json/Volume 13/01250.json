Stepping into it, he felt that the world had become dark and quiet. It could soothe the fear and pain in everyone’s heart and dissolve their obsession, while the will of death reverberated, the vitality did not diminish. It was extremely mysterious, as if it was the final destination, an eternal hometown.</p><p>In the center of the world, a lotus throne floated. It was a ninth-grade lotus throne. Its color was pale, and it was fresh and refreshing. It made Gu Xiaosang, who was sitting on it, look even more ethereal. She was untainted by the dust of the world, as if she was born with a faint sense of antiquity.</p><p>Compared to the last time they met, her appearance was even more exquisite and hard to describe, and her temperament was even more sacred and refined.</p><p>However, when she saw Meng Qi come in, she rolled her eyes, and her dimples appeared. The familiar mischievousness seemed to jump out of the paper again, and the inhumane feeling faded away.</p><p>“Husband, you entered my ‘bedroom’without saying a word. You’re really reckless. Aren’t you afraid of seeing something you shouldn’t?”Gu Xiaosang said with a smile. There was no anger in the corners of her eyes, “But that’s normal. Since we’re husband and wife, my bedroom is husband’s bedroom. There’s no need to avoid it.”</p><p>“How can I continue when you’ve already said the exact opposite…”Meng Qi criticized in his heart and said with a smile, “That’s true. Unfortunately, I didn’t see anything that makes people think…”</p><p>He wanted to say something incoherent, but he was a little awkward in the middle of his sentence. He couldn’t finish his sentence. After all, he and gu xiaosang were not that “Close”. He used to know the Saintess of Daluo, and they were enemies, although they had experienced many things later, such as physical and spiritual encounters and life-and-death tests, they had only just begun to get along with each other. It was extremely awkward for them to say similar things.</p><p>Seeing this, Gu Xiaosang pursed her lips and smiled. “I like you to pretend to be a hooligan, but you don’t look like one.”</p><p>Meng Qi laughed dryly and changed the topic. “Have you completely refined your innate virtue?”</p><p>How could xiaosang say such things without any psychological barriers?</p><p>Well, she used to be like this..</p><p>The way they got along seemed to be a little off..</p><p>Gu Xiaosang raised her right hand and held her cheek. She said with a faint smile, “It seems that my husband has found a secret place for me to prove my dao, and it’s not the hollow jade temple.”</p><p>“How did you guess?”Meng Qi was a little surprised.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang’s eyes were bright and lively. “When you mentioned that I had completely refined my innate virtue, your tone was relaxed and cheerful, without a trace of worry. Obviously, you were well-prepared for the follow-up.”</p><p>“I see.”Meng Qi nodded and smiled. It was his own mood that betrayed him. “I found a way to enter the origin of life and death, and I Left a dao mark inside. I will be able to prove my dao here, and I will be able to hide it from that person…”</p><p>He told the details of the origin of life and death, Emperor Zhenwu, the wheel of life and death, and the future Fengdu Emperor. He planned to discuss it with Gu Xiaosang and see how to perfect the plan.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang had a faint smile on her face, and her eyes were like the reflection of the galaxy. She listened to Meng Qi quietly and did not interrupt him halfway. Then she said with a smile,</p><p>“Husband, are you sure that Fengdu Emperor will provoke the true martial emperor who is in a strange state like the Yellow Springs?”</p><p>“If Fengdu Emperor tries to bypass the true martial emperor, or attacks you before he gets close to him, are you confident that you can attract the true martial emperor to attack you without hurting yourself?”</p><p>“My husband, can you guess Emperor Fengdu’s purpose? Do you know what he is best at? How confident are you that the sudden sneak attack of the wheel of life and death and the ability to stir the origin of life and death can seriously injure him?”</p><p>“I know that my husband still has something to rely on. It is the tree of the epoch that devoured the building wood and destroyed the Jade Lake and other celestial worlds. It can ‘eat’the nine heavens, and naturally, it can also ‘eat’the nine underworlds and things derived from it, including the origin of life and death. However, this matter has long been not a secret. Many experts have witnessed the incident at the Jade Lake. Since Emperor Fengdu invited my husband to explore the origin of life and death, how could he not be prepared for it?”</p><p>The questions were directed at Meng Qi’s mind, making his arrangements and backup plans seem to be lacking in every aspect. Even the “Tree of Great Dao”, which was the key chess piece, was not worth mentioning. Previously, when he entered the origin of life and death, meng Qi relied on the incarnation of the Netherworld skeleton and did not carry the tree of Great Dao. However, he was quite sure that this strange little tree had an “Appetite”for the origin of life and death.</p><p>Seeing that Meng Qi was stunned.., gu Xiaosang smiled and said, “It’s not that you don’t have enough wisdom, but you’re still not used to planning. Once you get used to it, it’s best not to rely on the unknown when dealing with an enemy that you don’t know very well. For example, Zhenwu. You Can’t make things too detailed and interlinked. Once something goes wrong and one of the links is broken, the whole arrangement will go out of control.”</p><p>There’s no need to comfort me… Meng Qi thought to himself.</p><p>At this point, Gu Xiaosang tilted her head slightly and looked at Meng Qi:</p><p>“Most importantly, how much does my husband know about Emperor Fengdu?”</p><p>“After the fall of the human emperor, the bigwigs on the other side jumped out of the river of time and slept in the chaos. They rarely interfered with and monitored the real world, but you should know very well that they can see the future and possess the possibility. Unless it involves another person on the other side, everything in the future is in their hearts. No matter how secretive Emperor Fengdu is, how can he hide it from them when he wants to secretly build a Netherworld? “And in that person’s memory and knowledge, there is nothing about Emperor Fengdu. It seems that he only appeared recently.”</p><p>Meng Qi’s heart moved. “In other words, Emperor Fengdu is the representative of which other shore? He is hidden, his identity is unknown, and his origin is unknown. I’m afraid that once he is recognized, it will immediately make people understand.”</p><p>Only the other shore could resist the other shore. If he did not have the primordial Lord of Heaven and Emperor Qing behind him, he would have been discovered long ago by his master.</p><p>“So, if Emperor Fengdu really has malice toward my husband, then it is absolutely unstoppable, and he might even use the power of the other shore.”Gu Xiaosang’s dimples suddenly became shallow. “Actually, it is very simple to truly have no hidden dangers.”</p><p>“Well, how would you plan it?”Meng Qidun was curious.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang laughed softly. “To make a fuss about the ‘wheel of life and Death’, first make sure that Zhenwu doesn’t disturb it. Then, share this dao mark directly with the person in the ancient fusang tree. Share it with Guangchengzi, venerate GUANGFA, red sperm, and other powerful people in the destiny realm who are about to completely awaken. Also, tell them to pay close attention to your movements. Once you and the Fengdu Emperor enter the origin of life and death, immediately follow them through the DAO Mark and surround and kill the Fengdu Emperor.”</p><p>“With such a lineup, no matter what tricks he has up his sleeves, whether he can borrow the power of the other shore or not, he will be dead. There is no chance of survival. And with the death of the Fengdu Emperor, my husband doesn’t have to worry that he might harm you.”</p><p>“This…”Meng Qi’s hair stood on end.</p><p>This was the first strike!</p><p>Seeing this, Gu Xiaosang spat, “My husband, do you think I am too ruthless?”</p><p>Before Meng Qi could reply, she smiled again, her face relaxed, and she said, “I know that it’s not that you didn’t think of this plan, but that you don’t want to take the initiative to harm others, especially since the other party’s evil intentions haven’t been revealed. That’s why you went through so much trouble to find other ways to be on guard. At the same time, you’re worried that the Fengdu Emperor has obtained something important, and that’s why you’re unwilling to give up this trip.”</p><p>Meng Qi laughed at himself and said, “That’s true. Actually, I’ve always been good at asking for help. However, it’s not my idea or my dao to ask me to set up a trap for the other party when there’s no enmity between us.”</p><p>After entering the origin of life and death, even with the help of the Heavenly Wheel of life and death, Meng Qi could not send the news to the outside world. Therefore, there was no possibility that he would ask for help after Emperor Fengdu had made a move.</p><p>“This is the difference between my husband and me.”Gu Xiaosang’s expression was rarely serious, and her gaze was deep.</p><p>Meng Qi was stunned. Before he could say anything, he saw her eyes drooping, and she said shyly, “That’s why I feel safe by my husband’s side. I didn’t betray him, and I didn’t plot against him.”</p><p>Damn it, if Xiaosang had said this in a teasing tone, I would have said it with some sincerity. Such a shy and tender “Confession”was really unbelievable. It was not her personality! Meng Qi felt like he had been bitten by a snake for ten years, but he was afraid of being tied to a rope.</p><p>“But it’s not like there’s no other way except to strike first.”Gu Xiao Sang’s shyness disappeared quickly. Her cheeks were still red, and her tone was already smiling, “I plan to wait for my husband and the Fengdu Emperor to enter the starting point of life and death, and then find a chance to prove the legendary realm inside.”</p><p>“What kind of change will this cause? Can it restrain Emperor Fengdu’s backup plan?”Meng Qi had just finished speaking when a thought suddenly came to his mind and he blurted out, “What benefits are you planning to use him for?”</p><p>Xiao sang had said so much before, so that was the real reason!</p><p>If she had not hidden this matter, he probably would not have guessed it. For example, she could use the excuse that she was still a little lacking in accumulation to continue her seclusion and wait for him and Emperor Fengdu to enter the starting point of life and death.</p><p>Gu Xiaosang smiled faintly and did not say anything. She was like a cunning little fox.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
