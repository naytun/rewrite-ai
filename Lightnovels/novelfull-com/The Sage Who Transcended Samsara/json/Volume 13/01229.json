He restrained his emotions and shed his subjective opinion, starting from the beginning to examine the matter of Gu Xiaosang and the gold emperor.</p><p>As the investigation went deeper, he gradually found some problems in his extremely calm state:</p><p>“Before xiaosang came back to life, the Gold Emperor had been sending his men to search for the clues she left behind, wanting to wipe her out completely and eliminate the biggest hidden danger. However, it seems that they all achieved other goals by accident…”</p><p>“Regarding the matter of the green lotus seed of chaos in the hollow jade temple, he used sufficient reasons to wake Sha Wujing up early. Not only did it not attract the overreaction of other important figures, but it also made Sha Wujing himself willing to do so to prevent the other oracles from being dissatisfied with the ‘Rabbit dies and the Fox grieves’. Sha Wujing’s early awakening made Luo order the first force in the world to possess legendary strength. They carried out a mysterious corpse from the depths of Mount Numinous, and they must have completed other arrangements…”</p><p>“During the Battle of the Fusang Ancient Tree realm, through Sha Wujing, he used some unknown divine ability to resolve the hidden danger there. He obtained the special fruit that connected him to the Green Emperor and gave it to me at just the right time. Today, the Green Emperor has gone through a sea of bitterness and reached the other shore. At the crucial moment, he played a crucial role…”</p><p>“The four great oracles came to probe the Jade Void Palace’s strength and to fight for a chance for Maitreya and the demi-humans…”</p><p>When she thought of the Hongmen Banquet on Jin Ao Island, Wu Sheng’s mother sent Dharmaraja to discuss something with Yuan Hong. It seemed to be related to the Eastern Emperor Bell, but Emperor Qing happened to bump into it and caused a collision. She also used this to lower her power, this triggered the subsequent changes and sent them back to the Middle Ages. Although it was not without the help of the celestial venerable of morals, the trigger was undoubtedly the Golden Emperor. The outcome of the matter was that medicine master Wang Fo was enlightened, the Green Emperor had taken a crucial step to the other side of the Dao.</p><p>Combined with his judgment of the relationship between the Green Emperor and the Gold Emperor, the truth was obvious!</p><p>Meng Qi thought to himself, “The gold emperor in the past and mother Wusheng now seem to be very good at concealing other plans with logical matters to achieve their real goals. and the so-called logical matters are likely to be her own creation!”</p><p>“The metal emperor doesn’t have much killing intent toward me, and he is very lenient. He seems to be very serious about the resurrection of little sang, but in fact, he only takes it out when he needs it. Either little sang is not his hidden danger, not an obstacle that he can not complete, or he has a backup plan that little sang doesn’t know about, and is confident that he can easily solve the problem before little sang truly threatens him, so he can use this to settle the matter and take advantage of it.”</p><p>“There are many important figures on the other shore who are paying attention to this matter. If Xiao sang is not the hidden danger of the Golden Emperor, if it is not because he is unable to complete the obstruction, it is impossible to hide it from their wise eyes. After all, this is the key to the key. It is impossible for them to believe that the Golden Emperor is the one who said yes.”</p><p>“Excluding the other impossibilities, there seems to be only one explanation left, and that is that the Golden Emperor has absolute confidence in eliminating the hidden danger before Xiao sang really threatens him…”</p><p>Just as Meng Qi was about to wake Gu Xiao sang up in advance and tell her this judgment, he suddenly had an idea:</p><p>“Judging from her performance these days, it seems that Xiao sang has something else to rely on. She has a lot of secrets, but I don’t know if she can defeat the Gold Emperor’s backup plan…”</p><p>“Since her resurrection, Xiao sang has often displayed a side of the gold emperor’s temperament. Although she has the inevitable result of her memory and knowledge, there are also traces of intentional imitation. I guess in her heart, to defeat the gold emperor and completely break away from him, she must have grown into another gold emperor. This shows how deep a shadow the Gold Emperor has left in her heart. The more she understands, the more she feels that the other party is invincible. She can only imitate him and grow into him so that she can fight against him.”</p><p>“However, if I imitate the Golden Emperor, I will never be able to grow something unique to myself. I will never be able to jump out of his shackles, and I will never be able to defeat him…”</p><p>Thinking of this, Meng Qi sighed softly. Deep pity for Gu Xiaosang emerged in his heart.</p><p>As he was a devil and Buddha, he did not inherit memories and knowledge. Therefore, he only needed to consider external strength, realm, martial arts, and the body and mind as one to cut off the connection and fight against the other party, although GU xiaosang had benefited from the memory and knowledge of the gold emperor, which allowed her to plan many things with foresight, shrewdness, and wisdom far beyond her peers and seniors, and obtain a satisfactory result, in this way, the battle between her and the Gold Emperor.., not only was it external, but it was also in her soul. That kind of torture, that kind of wandering, and that kind of pain was not something that an outsider could understand, so it also formed an unpredictable mind.</p><p>After enduring this kind of torture for a long time, it was no wonder that he felt sympathy for Gu Xiaosang when he met her.</p><p>Meng Qi temporarily gave up the idea of alerting Gu Xiaosang to enter seclusion. He believed that she could also figure out the true intention of the Gold Emperor, and he must have a corresponding arrangement for it. It was better to wait for her to complete her cultivation before discussing it in detail.</p><p>For the first time, Meng Qi felt that Gu Xiaosang was not completely clueless.</p><p>Putting away his thoughts, Meng Qi took out the universal knowing talisman and contacted Qi Zhengyan. He deliberately did not mention the fight for the sky-sealing platform, and said straightforwardly, “I want to resurrect senior Chong He.”</p><p>The conflict between them and Gao Lan stemmed from their own paths, ideals, and obsessions. He could not find a way to resolve it for the time being, and it was impossible for him to completely stand on one side. Therefore, it was better not to mention it.</p><p>Qi Zhengyan’s emotionless voice sounded, “Most of the power of the god Ascension Board has been cleverly sealed by the Bodhi ancient Buddha. Although the power is not strong, it is extremely profound. Even with the experience and knowledge of the demon lord, I can not find a way to resolve it for the time being. I can only resolve it slowly. It will take at least five years for it to succeed.”</p><p>“What exactly does the Bodhi ancient Buddha want to do?”Meng Qi did not hide his doubts.</p><p>He could understand why the heaven-sealing platform, the god-sealing roll, and the true spirit map had to be separated before the time was right. After all, it involved the matters of the Heaven Court, the Earth, and the netherworld. It was impossible for the big figures on the other side to sit on the sidelines and have their own thoughts, but why did he seal the god-sealing roll? Was the true spirit map sealed?</p><p>Qi zhengyan answered frankly, “I don’t know, but the other side will never let things go for no reason. There must be a deeper reason.”</p><p>“That makes sense…”meng qi nodded. While thinking about the Daoist’s true purpose of sealing the god-sealing roll, he silently criticized senior brother Qi. Who said that the other side would never let things go for no reason? “When I reach the other side, I’ll do a few things for you to see!”!</p><p>Qi Zhengyan changed the topic. “Fifth brother feels a little guilty, but he doesn’t regret it. Next, we plan to retreat to the nine Netherworlds.”</p><p>“Retreat to the nine serenities?”Meng Qi was about to say that he was in the middle to mediate and see if they could get along peacefully, but he heard the words ‘nine serenities’.</p><p>Separation was imminent.., it was rare for Qi Zhengyan to give a detailed answer. “We can only avoid their sharp edges because of our lofty position. Within the nine serenities, the strength and realm of the great unfettered emperor and the few demon saints will increase. Moreover, the evil demons and evil gods are polluted by the nine serenities and are restricted by their nature. They rarely truly unite. Even if we can’t defeat them one by one, it’s enough to give us a place to stand and have room to grow.”</p><p>As the successor of the demon lord, he naturally knew about some of the secret passageways. Previously, when the demon Saint returned to the legends, he had broken through in the netherworld. That was why there were no abnormalities.</p><p>“Then what about the Southern Wilderness?”Meng Qi thought for a moment and did not try to dissuade him.</p><p>The return of the demon lord’s successor to the Netherworld was like a dragon returning to the sea.</p><p>“Let the people in the world not be poor, rich, lowly, or have high or low qualifications. As long as they work hard and want to improve themselves, they can obtain a cultivation technique that is not inferior to others. This was my initial wish, and now, I can barely achieve it.”Qi Zhengyan’s tone was a little emotional, “And it depends on your universal understanding of the world. This matter has already been rooted in the human way, and it will not fail because of my departure. Those evil demons and evil gods in the Netherworld who can not break free from their nature and can not break free from their destiny are also living beings, and they also need opportunities.”</p><p>Even if the southern wilderness returned to the Great Zhou, he also believed that Meng Qi would not change the current situation of learning martial arts, and Gao Lan would not either, because this was beneficial to the human way!</p><p>Meng Qi had mixed feelings when he heard this. Senior Brother Qi’s faith was more important than his life. He opened his mouth and only said one sentence:</p><p>“Take care.”</p><p>“We will meet again.”Qi Zhengyan revealed a smile. Then, he turned his head and said to the unfettered son of heaven, Zhao Heng, the demon saint, and his subordinates who were gathered nearby,</p><p>“Set out, our target is the Netherworld!”</p><p>..</p><p>Putting down the universal sign, Meng Qi sighed. Then, he withdrew his mind and began to carry out his own matters.</p><p>During this casual experience, he fully understood the terror of the other side, the power of the great divine arts practitioners, and the inadequacy of his current strength. At the critical moment, he could not play much of a role, even the previous plan to seize the God ascension roll or “Assist”Han Guang in establishing the heavenly court completely vanished into thin air due to Daoist Zhundi’s casual brush. There was nothing he could do. This was the “Will of Heaven”. Therefore.., his most urgent thought was to improve himself as soon as possible.</p><p>In addition, the matter of helping his master secretly establish another underworld had to be put on the agenda.</p><p>Now that there was the Azure Emperor, who could walk on the other side of the Earth and suppress the world, it would be very peaceful for a period of time. It would be very suitable for seclusion and self-improvement… Meng Qi retracted his thoughts. Dark circles surrounded him as his mind once again traveled across the world, he left behind the ‘mark of him and me’.</p><p>Inside the quiet room of the hollow jade temple, it was quiet and deep again.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
