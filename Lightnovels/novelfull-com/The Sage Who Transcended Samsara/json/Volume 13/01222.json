He was almost knocked back by Yuan Hong’s giant staff and hit by the Saber.</p><p>Zhao Hengchu was able to leave his residence in secret and quietly approach the heaven-sealing platform. However, when he passed through the splendid landscape painting and reached the peak, he could no longer hide from the mighty figures, even if the focus of their attention was not here!</p><p>Meng Qi was the first to notice the abnormality on the sealed sky platform. Similarly, he also recognized the peerless treasure of the “God Ascension Roll”, the foundation of the Heavenly Court!</p><p>When did Zhao Laowu collude with Lu Ya?</p><p>Didn’t he recognize the reality and rationally choose to give up?</p><p>All kinds of questions emerged in Meng Qi’s heart, causing him to be shocked and pained.</p><p>Towards every life and death friend, he was sincere and sincere. Even Qi Zhengyan, who had a different path and a different strategy, the friendship between the two parties did not fade in the slightest. Who would have thought that today, Zhao Heng would suddenly betray.., standing on the opposite side, this kind of impact caused him, who could examine thoughts, to have a momentary fluctuation in his emotions.</p><p>If Lu Ya wanted to help his side, he would have directly given the ‘God Ascension Roll’to Gao Peng, and the heaven-sealing platform would have been completed long ago. Now, he had secretly asked Zhao Heng to take the ‘God Ascension Roll’with him, taking advantage of the fact that all the almighty experts’attention was on Gao Peng’s self-corroborating legend, he passed through the ‘Splendid landscape painting’and came to the core of the heaven-sealing platform. There was no need to speak of his good intentions or evil intentions!</p><p>It turned out that Zhao Laowu had never given up on his desire to become an emperor. The deeper he buried it, the more powerful and terrifying it would become..</p><p>It was my instinct that had overlooked this matter. I felt that he was willing to submit to Great Zhou so that I wouldn’t have to make such a difficult choice between becoming sworn brothers and life and death. This was truly a great thing, and I didn’t need to worry about such conflicts anymore. Thus.., i had overlooked his true thoughts, the burning faith in his heart, and the many years of pain, struggle, and confusion in his heart..</p><p>Meng Qi felt a deep sense of guilt. However, as he thought about it, all of his emotional fluctuations were removed. The absolute blade activated every trace of electromagnetism in the world and illuminated Great Zhou, it enveloped Yuan Hong’s huge black club into the forest of lightning and destruction.</p><p>At the same time, he grabbed with his left hand. Later on, the accumulated brilliance of humanity, merit, and virtue condensed into a green, white, golden, and Yellow Ruyi.</p><p>When the Ruyi was unleashed, it descended on the heaven-sealing platform and resonated with the great Zhou territory and billions of subjects. It became unusually heavy as if it was shouldering the responsibility of endless hope.</p><p>Of Meng Qi’s current methods, it was the only one that could directly penetrate the “Splendid landscape map”. Therefore, under the circumstances where it was difficult to split one’s attention and turn one Qi into three pure ones, this method that consumed a great deal of energy was the only choice, it was just like how Lu Ya chose Zhao Heng.</p><p>In the Karmic Buddhist kingdom, the four swords of extermination and slaughter displayed their might. The Heaven flipping seal and the sword of great wisdom were heavy and light, and they fought with the ancient glazed lamp that was mixed with many colors of karma. It was difficult to resolve. This created an opportunity for Shaoxuan and Xi’e, the “Boat of Doomsday”passed through the illusion and crashed into the dark void.</p><p>Crack!</p><p>A crack appeared in the void. The moment the ancient Buddha’s golden finger reached out from the lamp but was blocked, the “Boat of Doomsday”transcended its tribulation and charged out.</p><p>The ancient Buddha with the lamp burning sat in the middle of the boundless Buddhist land. The Buddhist light behind his head was full and shone across the three realms. He sighed lightly but didn’t pay too much attention to it, guangchengzi, Manjusri Guangfa Tianzun, red sperm, jade tripod zhenren, Dao Xing Xianzun’s combined force is really terrible, actually let oneself somewhat laborious.</p><p>The present is different from the past. More than a year ago, Guang Chengzi and other great divine arts practitioners had just begun to awaken and could only descend with a trace of power. As time passed, the degree of their awakening gradually deepened. In other words, during these several hundred * * * * * * * * * * * nights, each day was stronger than the previous one. Each hour was stronger than the previous two hours. Each breath was stronger than the previous one. The power that they could now display was already incomparable to the previous one. They already had some power at their peak, enough to entangle themselves with the unrestored view.</p><p>The boat of Doomsday broke free from the Light Golden Buddha palm and returned to the sky above changle. It was the moment when Meng Qi’s Three Treasures Ruyi was on the verge of the splendid mountain and river painting. It was about to form a combined force.., a pitch-black sword qi that seemed both illusory and real pierced through the heaven and earth, blocking the Ruyi and the giant ship at the same time.</p><p>It had the filth and destruction of reality as well as the impact and contamination of the spiritual light of its nature. It was the primordial Heavenly Demon Sword Qi!</p><p>Unparalleled Demon Lord watched for a while, but he did not make up his mind. He did not know whether he should stop Gao Lan from obtaining the legend or help him in secret. After all, the stronger Gao Lan was, the more he would oppress the south barren, the faster he could finish off Qi Zhengyan, the faster he could do so. However, Gao Lan had inherited the mantle of the human emperor. With the sword of Nirvana in his hand, he had also established the heaven sealing platform. If he succeeded in proving the legend, it would be difficult to control the situation, just like the current “Yuan emperor”, Su Meng.</p><p>While he was hesitating, he noticed Zhao Heng holding the god-sealing roll on the heaven sealing platform. His heart immediately brightened and he made up his mind.</p><p>Even if Gao Li could step into the legendary realm, as long as he took the heaven-sealing platform, it would be difficult for him to achieve great things. He was like a bird whose wings had been broken!</p><p>Thus, the demon lord’s eyes were pitch-black as he shot out the ‘Primordial Heavenly Demon Sword Qi’to block the doomsday boat, the Three Treasures Ruyi, and the Xiao Tianquan hidden in the void, buying Zhao Heng some time!</p><p>..</p><p>Inside King Jin’s residence, Yu Jinghua, Mao Jin, and the other reincarnators took advantage of the chaos in the entire city to quickly sneak out.</p><p>They had never expected that the follow-up mission would be so simple. They had hidden for a year just to hand over a strange thing to King Jin, Zhao Heng, today.</p><p>Everything went so smoothly that King Jin did not even ask about their origins or what the thing was. It was as if all the details were clear to him. Wearing a bright yellow robe, he sat behind a desk, took it calmly, and suddenly disappeared.</p><p>No matter what, the mission had been completed. As long as they left King Jin’s mansion and waited for things to calm down, the lord of the six paths of reincarnation would take them away.</p><p>Now that the sky was filled with strange phenomena and danger, there was no time to lose. It was too late!</p><p>..</p><p>Zhao Heng stood on the heaven sealing platform. Around him was the great Zhou territory’s “Concentrated””Splendid landscape map”. The four colors were glowing abnormally, making him feel as if he was placed in the center of the world, he had a subtle feeling of looking at his own picturesque landscape.</p><p>This was a scene that he could only see in his dreams in the past. This was a belief that had been deeply planted in his heart since he was young!</p><p>As long as he placed the god-sealing roll in the pivotal area of the heaven-sealing platform and let them merge into one, he would immediately be able to use the chicken to lay eggs and steal the sky to change the Sun. He would be able to control the power of Heaven and earth and regain the glory of the ancient heavenly court at its peak. He would be able to destroy the great merchants.., he would bestow the titles of the gods, and the glory of the Heaven and earth would be in his hands!</p><p>Lu Ya and Han Guang would be like the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning and the heavenly venerate of morals, who would be behind the Heavenly Emperor, secretly controlling and helping him.</p><p>How could he not be moved by such a beautiful description?</p><p>Even someone as powerful as the heavenly emperor had to lower his head in front of the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning and the heavenly venerate of morals. What else could he be dissatisfied with?</p><p>Zhao Heng closed his eyes and sighed. The god-sealing roll in his hand was covered in a layer of pure and brilliant golden light. The almighty experts in the sky fought fiercely, but they didn’t disturb this place at all, it gave the heaven-sealing platform a strange silence and tranquility.</p><p>..</p><p>It was unknown where it came from, but the river of time that flowed in an unknown direction rolled forward in the void. It was surrounded by the primal chaos.</p><p>It split at the current node and formed countless tributaries. Each tributary was similar and different. They were all possibilities for the future.</p><p>In one of the tributaries, heaven and earth were hazy, and all things were illusory. A figure stepped on a small boat and sailed into the Fusang ancient tree realm. He came to the bottom of the two main trunks that supported each other, he saw roots that far surpassed the sun and moon and mulberry leaves that evolved into a universe.</p><p>The scorching heat turned into light, making the ancient fusang tree feel as if it was being bathed in flames. The Scarlet Golden Light drooped down, dyeing this figure with a sense of holiness and transcendence.</p><p>This was a handsome and outstanding young Daoist. His hair was disheveled, and he wore a strange green robe.</p><p>Stepping Out, this handsome Daoist came to the top of the valley formed by the roots and branches. Just as he was about to pass through, he suddenly saw the large golden words on the cliff wall from the corner of his eye:</p><p>“Yuxu Su Meng is here to wait for senior Azure Emperor and leave a letter at the current node.”</p><p>“The current node… Yuxu Su Meng…”the handsome Daoist stopped abruptly and stopped in midair. His expression fluctuated as he muttered to himself.</p><p>Suddenly, he looked back as if he had seen through an illusion and saw a tributary. He slowly closed his eyes and spoke in a low voice after a long while:</p><p>“I am Azure Emperor.”</p><p>“I am Taihao.”</p><p>… ..</p><p>In a secret area, Lu Ya, who was wearing a big red robe, had a serious look on his face. He was paying attention to the scarecrow in front of him.</p><p>The Scarecrow was placed on the stage. There was a lamp above its head and a lamp under its feet. It was filled with a mysterious and terrifying feeling. There were many characters written on its body. The most eye-catching ones were the two ancient divine characters:</p><p>“Taihao!”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
