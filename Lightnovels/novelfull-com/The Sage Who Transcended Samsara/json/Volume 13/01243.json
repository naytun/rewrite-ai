If it was someone else reading it, their eyes would definitely light up, they had a clear impression of Li Zhongkang’s character and events, and they had a deep grasp of it.</p><p>However, when Li Zhongkang read it himself, his heart grew colder and colder. His limbs felt cold, and his entire body trembled. Sweat quickly flowed out of his body and dripped down like raindrops. It was as if he had fallen into a nightmare, and it was difficult for him to get rid of it.</p><p>All of his secrets, whether he knew it or not, were presented here one by one. The last few pages were still ink-stained. It was obvious that he had just written it, and he must have been prepared for it!</p><p>“Nonsense, nonsense…”Li Zhongkang retorted as if he was in a dream. He took a step back without any strength and leaned his back against the tree trunk. He felt a chill and was soaked in sweat.</p><p>In just a short time, he had passed three lightning tribulations. He was able to fly in the wind and attract lightning, so he couldn’t control the reaction of his body to sweat.</p><p>Daoist master Yunji had expected that he would come to spy on him, so he wrote this “Biography of Li Zhongkang”… he seemed to be in a deep sleep while meditating, he only gave Wei Ji and himself a chance to steal the book… What he had done was already in his calculations, and there was no difference at all… Li Zhongkang’s thoughts churned, and he was both shocked and afraid. For the first time, he felt that Daoist master Yunji was unfathomable.</p><p>“Daoist master? What is recorded in this book?”Wei Ji saw that Li Zhongkang’s reaction was not right, and he was inexplicably flustered. He asked regardless of his identity.</p><p>Hearing this, Li Zhongkang shivered as if he had finally woken up from a dream. Without even looking at Wei Ji, the breeze around him swept over the courtyard wall and stumbled outside the room. He bowed deeply and said in a trembling voice,</p><p>“This junior is blind and does not see Senior’s foresight. I have many suspicions and complaints. Please forgive me, Senior.”</p><p>He bowed and did not lift his body, waiting for Meng Qi’s answer.</p><p>A few breaths later, an old and hoarse laughter came from the room:</p><p>“Those who don’t know are not guilty. Please come in, immortal Li.”</p><p>Li Zhongkang quietly exhaled, raised his body, and adjusted his clothes. Then, he pushed open the door and stepped in.</p><p>Those who could survive the lightning tribulation were the best in the world. Li Zhongkang was not a fool. Even though he was blinded by greed and proud of himself, after such a blow, he finally regained his rationality and understood that facing an expert who did not know his limits.., rather than playing tricks and avoiding the problem, it was far better to admit that he had lived his life and sincerely apologize.</p><p>Entering the room, he saw that Meng Qi was still sitting cross-legged on the bed. His Black Daoist robe covered his body, and his face was thin and lean. His eyebrows were not white, but there was an unconcealable sense of age and decay, and that pair of seemingly bottomless eyes was looking at him with a smile that was not a smile.</p><p>Li Zhongkang could not help but shudder, and he hurriedly paid his respects:</p><p>“Zhongkang greets Senior Yunji.”</p><p>“Daoist master Li, there’s no need to be so polite. In this time of the survival of Haotian Taoism, you and I are both shouldering a heavy burden. There’s no distinction between the superior and inferior.”Meng Qi raised his right hand and gestured for Li Zhongkang to sit down.</p><p>Li Zhongkang first turned around and closed the door. He had Wei Ji guard outside to prevent others from approaching. Then, he sat down with trepidation, he said with difficulty, “This is the first time this junior has met an expert like senior who has all the secrets of heaven in his grasp. Back then, even Celestial Master Xu was far inferior. It was hard for him to believe that, so he was arrogant and disrespectful. However, this is a fortunate thing for Haotian Taoism. At the critical moment, a senior came out of the mountain and held up the sky with one arm.”</p><p>“We all have our own strengths,”Meng Qi said with a smile.</p><p>According to his further observation, this universe was miraculously isolated by the seal. In other words, even if he escaped and asked for help, he could only return to the seal. It was of no use. Of course.., it would be completely different if he asked Guangchengzi, Celestial Master Wen Shu, or even emperor Qing who had completely woken up.</p><p>Li Zhongkang felt as if he was sitting on pins and needles. He tried his best to think of a topic and changed the topic. “Xiao Xuan has already shed all pretense of cordiality and no longer has any scruples. I wonder how senior will respond?”</p><p>Xiao Xuan was the current emperor, the name of the father of the nine kings. After two years, he had now reached the peak of power. Li Zhongkang and the others had originally thought that they were lucky. They thought that the other party was only suppressing and pruning the branches and leaves because of the great power of Taoism, after a while, they might be able to return to the original situation. That was why they had always addressed him as the son of Heaven or his majesty. However, the destruction of the Taoist temple in the south city had made Li Zhongkang realize the reality, and he truly understood that he could not return to the past, he began to address Xiao Xuan by his name.</p><p>“We will talk about the details tomorrow when everyone is present. However, I have something to trouble you with, immortal Li.”Meng Qi held the horsetail whisk in his hand and placed it on the crook of his other arm.</p><p>Li Zhongkang hurriedly stood up and cupped his hands. “Please instruct me, senior.”</p><p>Meng Qi pointed at the table, where a piece of paper was bathing in the moonlight. “Follow what I’ve written and buy the items for me.”</p><p>Li Zhongkang picked up the piece of paper the size of his palm. His eyes flashed with silver-white lightning as he started reading under the night sky, the names of the items were written on it, such as “Lightning tribulation wood”, “Pure yang water”, “Ghost-warding vine”, and “Divine Sun Stone”.</p><p>Eh, these were all needed to overcome the lightning tribulation, but they were just the initial stages. At his current level, they were all useless, so what did senior Yunji use them for? Li Zhongkang looked at Meng Qi in confusion, but he did not dare to ask.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled slightly. “For many years, I have been thinking hard about the nature of the Lightning Tribulation, trying to understand the profoundness that it made us improve. Now that I have gained something, I want to give it a try.”</p><p>Li Zhongkang was confused, but he roughly understood what senior Yunji was trying to test, so he did not say anything more and mustered up his courage, he asked in a low voice, “Senior, this junior’s illness is deeply rooted in me. Is there a solution to the problem of having children?”</p><p>He had always thought that it was because he had passed the lightning tribulation that he thought about having children. In the end, his nature had changed. As a concubine of an ordinary cultivator, it was difficult for her to withstand the rain and dew, which was why she could not succeed. Who knew that it was because she had injured her roots when she was young, and her hidden illness was hidden.., if not for senior Yunji’s words, it was likely that she would have no hope of becoming a descendant in this life.</p><p>Meng Qi laughed. “There is a ‘pavilion of immortal destiny’in the western part of the city. There is a ‘myriad lightning grass’in it. After you obtain it, you can directly consume it to replenish your roots.”</p><p>“Thank you for your guidance, Senior!”Li Zhongkang was overjoyed, and he felt that he was full of motivation to do things.</p><p>Seeing his back disappear, Meng Qi could not help but shake his head and laugh. He originally wanted to tease Li Zhongkang again and trick him into eating the myriad lightning grass by chanting ‘Nan Wu infertility ke Guan Yin Bodhisattva’a hundred times before he consumed it. However, as a Daoist, he could only give up, such an incantation did not seem right, so he could only give up.</p><p>..</p><p>The next morning, perhaps due to the intense battle in the southern city last night, all the Taoist temples were burned down. Heaven and man were connected. Dark clouds were pressing down on the city from high in the sky, lightning flashed and thunder rumbled, and a storm brewed.</p><p>Li Zhongkang did not stint on the treasures of the Heavenly Temple and his own private vault. He finally gathered the items written on Meng Qi’s note, so he hurried back in a hurry. He wanted to report his mission as soon as possible and go to the pavilion of immortal destiny to buy the myriad transformation thunder grass as soon as possible.</p><p>The secret guards all knew Li Zhongkang, so they did not stop him. They allowed him to come to the door of the room and hear the conversation inside.</p><p>Meng Qi looked around at the Daoists and chivalrous people, as well as the ninth king, Xiao Kun, who had sneaked in again, he slowly said, “From what I can see, you don’t have to defend the capital city with your lives. The world is vast and there is much to be done. In this way, you can also attract the attention of the Emperor and Grand Master PEI. You can call out the experts in the capital city, and even have grand master Pei leave the capital to personally take charge of the peace. When that time comes, the capital city will be empty, and the imperial court will be empty. The ninth king will have a chance to steal that extraordinary item.”</p><p>“This item has allowed the son of heaven and grand tutor Pei to advance by leaps and bounds. If we lose it, they will definitely stagnate. As for us who have obtained it, we will grow stronger day by day. As time goes by, there will eventually be a day when we can turn the tables.”</p><p>When these thunder tribulation experts heard this, they nodded their heads lightly. They felt that taking a step back was indeed like taking a step back.</p><p>“It’s just that relying on the ninth prince to steal such an important treasure from Xiao Xuan is unlikely.”Bi Chongde raised a question.</p><p>The ninth prince, Xiao Kun, was quite embarrassed when he heard others call his father by his name.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said, “So we have to leave a few fellow Daoists to hide and wait for an opportunity to cooperate…”</p><p>Before he could finish his words, his gaze turned to the outside of the door. “Fellow Daoist Li has returned. This old Daoist will be delayed for a while.”</p><p>Delayed for a while? Many gazes looked over, not understanding what was going on.</p><p>Meng Qi opened the door and took the bags containing the items. He stepped into the courtyard and said as he walked,</p><p>“Thank you, fellow Daoist Li, but I’ll have to trouble you to help me arrange it.”</p><p>Li Zhongkang was also confused. He took the Thunder Calamity Wood, pure Yang Water, and other items and began to arrange them under Meng Qi’s meticulous instructions. Not long after, an array without a flashy appearance appeared in the courtyard.</p><p>Meng Qi walked to the center of the array and sat down in the lotus position. He said with a smile, “I won’t trouble the two masters with this. Fellow Daoist Li, please activate it.”</p><p>Everyone looked at him in confusion. Li Zhongkang was also at a loss, but his hands still flashed with lightning and activated the array.</p><p>Light Rose, and the lines of the array became crystal clear one after another. Lightning struck wood, pure Yang water, and so on shattered with a pop. They turned into a mix of silver and green lightning, twisting into blurry runes that emitted a pure Yang and masculine aura.</p><p>The runes contracted and suddenly drilled into Meng Qi’s body, causing his face to slightly distort as if he was enduring a lot of pain. However, very soon, his entire body was covered in lightning, attracting lightning from all over the capital.</p><p>“This is…”Li Zhongkang seemed to have understood something.</p><p>And Bi zhongde blurted out, “This is to transcend the Lightning Tribulation!”</p><p>Meng Qi smiled slightly. All of the lightning bolts retracted, and the array formation broke inch by inch. High in the sky, green lightning gathered and struck down with a bang.</p><p>In today’s weather, such a situation was quite normal.</p><p>As a creator god, he had control over almost all the information in the past of the universe. How could he not have an understanding of the martial arts and cultivation techniques here, as well as the nine lightning tribulations?</p><p>After a night of analysis and comparison, with the help of his past comprehension of the absolute saber and lightning techniques, Meng Qi had already figured out the essence and touched on the source of the power in this place.</p><p>So what if there was no power to infiltrate?</p><p>Knowledge and information were power!</p><p>As for Yun Ji, he was a sixth Kalpa realm master and his physical body was quite strong. That was why he could not decay after death. However, the yin qi permeated and suppressed the power. He had to rely on the formation to neutralize the death qi before he could use it, in addition to the legendary essence of consciousness that could inscribe lightning patterns, as well as Meng Qi’s own grasp of the essence of power, if he could not quickly overcome the lightning tribulation, he would be a disgrace to his hometown’s elders! A disgrace to the title of Almighty!</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Green lightning struck down, enveloping Meng Qi. Crackling sounds could be heard continuously.</p><p>After a few breaths, everything dissipated. Daoist Yun Ji, who was wearing a black robe, appeared before everyone again. His body was damaged, as if the Yin Energy Ghost had been injured by Yang.</p><p>Meng Qi was already prepared for this situation. He formed a seal with his hands, and black and white swirled. The Yin Yang Seal, which had just advanced by leaps and bounds, circulated slightly. The aura of death dissipated, and life flourished. The damaged body squirmed and grew crazily. It did not take long for it to return to its original state!</p><p>“Sorry for the delay. Let’s continue discussing the countermeasures.”Meng Qi looked at the dazed crowd with a smile</p><p>Li Zhongkang, Bi Chongde, and the nine kings, Xiao Kun, and the others only had a few thoughts echoing in their minds:</p><p>‘it really only took a moment…’</p><p>While they were discussing the rest, he had also transcended a lightning tribulation..</p><p>Was this still the lightning tribulation that everyone had solemnly faced..</p><p>For a moment, they had forgotten an important question. How did the cloud collective spiritual master transcend his first lightning tribulation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
