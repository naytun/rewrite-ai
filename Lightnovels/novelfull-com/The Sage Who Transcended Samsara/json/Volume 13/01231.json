Sometimes, ferocious and indistinct faces would protrude from the void, and at other times, hordes of vengeful spirits would wander about, absorbing Yang energy and extinguishing vitality.</p><p>At this moment, a middle-aged monk walked into this valley that no one had stepped into for tens of thousands of years. He wore a yellow monk robe and a bright red kasaya. His face was elegant and his appearance was thin. He was the chief monk of the Shaolin Bodhi Academy, Xuan Bei, his originally melancholic temperament had turned into a faint sorrow that pitied the heavens and pitied the people.</p><p>Whoosh!</p><p>A living being arrived with the scent of flesh and blood. The ghosts in the valley immediately went crazy. The black gas surged like a tidal wave and the gloomy and cold ground was covered with layers of dark ice. There was no need for vengeful ghosts to absorb souls to come here from the exterior, they would die within a few breaths because the yang qi and body temperature were completely absorbed by the environment!</p><p>As the ghosts traveled in the night, the aura of death pervaded the air. Compared to them, Xuan bei was as tiny as a reef in the vast ocean. However, he did not stop walking and continued to move forward. His hands were already clasped together.</p><p>“After today, in the billions of tribulations, there should be the world, all hell, and the three evil paths. All sins afflict all living beings. I vow to save them, to get rid of the evil taste of Hell, and to be an animal and hungry ghost. “As for this sin, I will repay them all and become Buddha. Then, I will become zhengjue.”</p><p>In the voice of Buddha, the monk walking in the valley had already turned into a golden “Bodhisattva”. His feet were stepping on black ice and his blood was dark. The glass was not stained at all. His expression was compassionate and solemn. There was no hatred, nor did he abhor evil.</p><p>Circles of Buddhist light spread out from the golden body of Ksitigarbha, the mysterious and sorrowful bodhisattva. They dissolved the ice layer, purified the tainted blood, drove away the cold wind, and swept away the black fog.</p><p>Golden divine flowers grew out from the cold and muddy ground, unlike the Lotus River or the Brahma. They were like the strange-colored flowers on both sides of the Yellow River.</p><p>As the chanting of “Ksitigarbha of the south without Ksitigarbha”reverberated in the air, the Pure Land took shape and expanded outward, enveloping all those vengeful souls and ghosts inside.</p><p>Buddhist cultivation techniques were special, unlike Daoists who needed legends to create their own grotto-heavens in the real world. As soon as the golden body was formed, the Arhat could create a pure land outside his body that belonged to his original body.</p><p>Of course, the Pure Land before the legendary realm was similar to the strengthening and deepening of a grandmaster’s domain. There was a fundamental difference between it and creating their own grotto-heaven.</p><p>Xuan Bei’s golden body put his palms together and slowly walked forward. There was pure land around him, and the golden lights were like arhats and bodhisattvas, chanting the Holy Name of Ksitigarbha together.</p><p>Buddhist sounds rang out, and the resentment of the vengeful souls and ghosts quickly disappeared. They hid their ferocious and twisted faces and landed in the center of the Pure Land in a semi-transparent manner. They landed behind Xuan Bei’s golden body. Their faces were peaceful, and their eyes were clear.</p><p>The golden body of Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva had incorporated part of the content of the incarnation. This pure land could be treated as a tiny Buddhist kingdom. The vengeful souls and evil spirits that Xuan Bei had transformed into could live here for a long time and cultivate the Buddhist dharma until he passed away. However.., if Xuan bei had already attained the Buddhist fruit position before he passed away, or stepped into the legendary realm, the Pure Land would truly become a Buddhist kingdom and turn into another world. Then, it would continue to operate until the end.</p><p>In just a few short breaths, the valley, which was filled with a dense aura of death and coldness, regained its tranquility. There was no longer the sound of ghosts crying, and there were signs of life.</p><p>Xuan bei did not seem to be happy. Instead, he sighed:</p><p>“That benefactor escaped again.”</p><p>After attaining Ksitigarbha’s golden body, he followed his own wishes and came to the god burial desert to ferment the vengeful spirits and evil ghosts in the dangerous land. Half a year ago, he met a ten-thousand-year-old ghost. It had the feeling of an ancient god, and it was abnormally fierce, he repeatedly wanted to wear down the obsession in the other party’s heart and dissolve the negative emotions, but he was always a hair’s breadth away and could not stop it.</p><p>From this, it could be seen that this was a terrifying ghost that had regained its intelligence!</p><p>Xuan bei chanted a Buddhist chant in a low voice and kept the pure land in his body. Golden lotuses grew out from under his feet and carried him up into the sky, escaping to the other end of the god burial desert.</p><p>Along the way, he chanted Buddhist scriptures so that the ghosts and ghosts who had just been reincarnated would not be haunted by the obsession.</p><p>Just as he was flying over an oasis, his figure suddenly stopped, and his eyes revealed some confusion.</p><p>“There is yin qi that is difficult to dispel with obsessions, but it does not carry ferocity and malevolence,”Xuan bei said in a low voice.</p><p>If he had not cultivated the Ksitigarbha golden body, he would not have been able to sense it.</p><p>The light descended, and Xuan bei followed his senses and landed in front of a relatively old courtyard. Under the bright moon, he knocked on the door.</p><p>Dong Dong Dong, Dong Dong Dong. There was a rhythmic but not annoying sound. The gatekeeper’s eyes were hazy as he opened the small door. He asked doubtfully, “Master, is there anything important that you need me for in the middle of the night?”</p><p>“Has your residence been haunted during this period of time?”Xuan bei asked bluntly.</p><p>The gatekeeper was stunned and said, “I haven’t heard of anything haunted, but my master has been inviting famous eminent monks and Taoist priests recently. Unfortunately, he always looks dissatisfied.”</p><p>Xuan bei nodded slightly and said, “I happen to be good at ferrying ghosts. Please report to your master.”</p><p>The gatekeeper looked at him deeply. He suspected that the monk who heard that the Master had offered a huge reward was good at ferrying ghosts? Every monk said so!</p><p>After thinking for a while, he felt that the master really valued this matter. He closed the door again and went to report.</p><p>After a short while, Tian wanzhe, dressed in a wide robe, welcomed him outside the door.</p><p>“My father has been dreaming of me night after night. I am sad about the situation after his death. I hope that Master can be merciful and help me resolve it,”Tian wanzhe said frankly.</p><p>The corners of his mouth had long blisters, and the bags under his eyes were heavy. During this period of time, he had been unable to save the old master even when he asked the monks to inquire about Dao. He had even been ridiculed for being able to understand heaven and earth. As time passed, he became more and more anxious. At this moment, he heard that an eminent monk had come to his house at night, he was really treating a dead horse as a last resort.</p><p>“Dream On? The situation after death?”Xuan bei gave Tian wanzhe a deep look, with his Buddhist divine ability, how could he not be able to sense that the other party was lying? He said without batting an eyelid.., “You need to find the object that the old benefactor places his obsession on. Only then can you resolve it with Buddhist dharma. I think it should be the ten thousand worlds talisman on benefactor’s waist.”</p><p>With a bang, Tian Wanzhe took a few steps back and almost tripped over the doorsill. His eyes revealed a look of shock.</p><p>This master was really amazing. He could actually see at a glance that the universal symbol was related to the old man’s ‘obsession’!</p><p>After thinking for a long time, he hesitated for a long time before gritting his teeth and inviting Xuan bei into the study room. Then, he took out the universal symbol.., his voice was sorrowful as he said, “Master, please save my father. Hell is terrifying and full of torture. As a child, how can I let him suffer such suffering?”</p><p>Xuan bei took the Universal Knowledge Talisman and his hand glowed with black and white light. He gently caressed the talisman, but he only felt the gathering of yin energy and nothing else.</p><p>“Benefactor, you have to tell me the whole story. Otherwise, I can’t do anything about it,”he said sincerely.</p><p>Tian wanzhe no longer hesitated. He honestly told Tian wanzhe about how the universal knowledge talisman could bind souls and connect to the underworld. Then, he looked at Xuan bei and asked, “Master, do you have any ideas?”</p><p>The Netherworld? Xuan bei muttered in his heart. He was surprised that this thing that had disappeared for a hundred to twenty thousand years had reappeared. It was no longer just a story in Buddhist scriptures and storybooks, the fact that the ten thousand realms talisman could seep into the Netherworld after binding the soul also surprised him. Logically speaking, the netherworld must have been isolated. He didn’t know if it was because the person who had secretly established this realm was not strong enough to deceive all the karma.., or there was another reason. HMM, it seemed like his disciple had the bones of the Netherworld in his hands..</p><p>After pondering for a while, Xuan bei said, “I’ll have to talk to you personally to confirm the method.”</p><p>“Master, then wait a moment. Wait for my father to take the initiative to contact me. Otherwise, it will be easy for the ghosts of the Netherworld to find out,”Tian wanzhe said worriedly.</p><p>Xuan bei nodded and did not say anything more. He began to recite the “Ksitigarbha’s soul ferrying scripture”in a low voice. The Zen sound waves quickly dispelled Tian wanzhe’s anxiety and worry.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, the sky was beginning to brighten. Suddenly, the universal sign of knowledge emitted a buzzing sound and emitted a sparkling light, attracting the gusts of chilly wind.</p><p>Tian wanzhe hurriedly connected the call and told the old man about the matter. Finally, he handed it to Xuan bei and said, “Master, make it short.”</p><p>Xuan bei nodded and said, “Old benefactor, there’s no need to be anxious, and there’s no need to speak. Just silently recite my dharma name Xuan bei 7749 times in your heart.”</p><p>He could use this to circulate his mind connection and sense the scene of the underworld through Old Master Tian.</p><p>“Xuan Bei? The Yuan emperor’s Buddhist teacher, Xuan Bei?”Tian wanzhe, who was beside him, was clearly stunned. He suspected that it was the same name.</p><p>After a while, old master Tian finished reciting the name silently. Xuan bei closed his eyes, and his body emitted a gentle golden light.</p><p>Gradually, his expression became solemn, and his compassion became even more intense. It was difficult to restrain his compassion. The tragic scene in the underworld had deeply stimulated his soul.</p><p>He had to suffer such a tragic and painful thing after death!</p><p>At this moment, he truly understood Ksitigarbha’s mood when he made the great wish. He felt a sense of holiness, and he also had an unexplainable responsibility.</p><p>I should establish a pure land to dispel the resentment of living beings after death, so that they would no longer suffer.</p><p>Hell was not empty, and I swore that I would not become a Buddha. All living beings would be spared, and only then would I be able to attain bodhi!</p><p>After ending the call, Xuan Bei opened his eyes and said gently, “Don’t worry, Almsgiver Tian. I already have a way. I will go and ask for help first, and I will return later.”</p><p>It seemed that he could not save people from this terrifying Netherworld by himself. Moreover, the universal knowing talisman could connect to hell, so it would not be wrong for him to go to the hollow jade temple and ask for help.</p><p>Thinking of this, he suddenly felt a little bashful. As a master and an elder, it was indeed a little embarrassing for him to ask for help from his disciple.</p><p>But if he could save the suffering spirit, what was a little bit of embarrassment?</p><p>With the escape light, he headed east until he reached the hollow jade temple of Kunlun Mountain.</p><p>“I want to see your sect master.”Xuan bei came to the gatehouse and said to the great green root inside.</p><p>The great green root ran out and said with a flattering smile,</p><p>“Master, why are you so polite? It’s just that my sect master happened to be out and is not in the sect now.”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
