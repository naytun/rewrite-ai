They had long been accustomed to similar things and had been focused on nurturing themselves and grasping the details of the current world along the way.</p><p>Unfortunately, there was too little time. For the time being, they only had a superficial understanding and a general impression.</p><p>At this moment.., yu Jinghua, who had been half-closing his eyes as if he was sleeping, suddenly said, “We are about to arrive at Changle. We are all experienced people. Needless to say, I will only say one thing. You must not immediately get in touch with the people from the Prince Jin’s residence. First, each of you must look for a job or an opportunity to leave a clean history in the capital before you plan to enter the Prince Jin’s residence.”</p><p>“You should have noticed that six paths only mentioned that he would be in hiding for at least half a year. He did not specify how long it would take for him to sneak into the Prince Jin’s residence. This is to give us sufficient time to prepare so that we don’t give ourselves away. Of course, don’t think of taking advantage of this to take advantage of six paths. He has always been shameless and may add conditions at any time.”</p><p>Yu Jinghua was very experienced, and Mao Jin agreed without holding back. When the others were about to ask in detail, they felt that the train was slowing down, as if it was about to arrive.</p><p>Through the window, they could see a towering and majestic city in front of them. It was worthy of being the capital of the Great Zhou. However, looking from afar, Mao Jin and the other experienced reincarnators felt an inexplicable pressure, the Glory of humanity that millions upon millions of creatures worked together to advance bravely.</p><p>Beside the city, there was an even more majestic altar. It was divided into nine layers, and each layer seemed to be carved with a different image. Around it were five smaller altars, which were divided into red, green, yellow, white, and black.</p><p>“The heaven sealing platform,”yu Jinghua said with certainty.</p><p>She paid more attention to the information about changle than anything else, and she did not only have a rough impression of it.</p><p>Luan Yaqian suddenly smiled and said, “So this is the heaven sealing platform? I saw the comments on the forum, but I haven’t studied it in detail.”</p><p>Mao Jin, Zhu Tianming, and Jiao Li were in a similar state.</p><p>Yu Jinghua’s eyes suddenly dimmed a little as he said, “The heaven sealing platform is a human altar that has been built after tens of thousands of years of preparation. It is said that if you can do your best, you can rule the heavens and confer titles to the Star Lords of the heavens and the immortals and deities of various tribes. But now, you have almost completed it and control the authority of the Earth. You can confer titles to the star officials, the City God, the mountain god, the Earth, the heavenly soldiers, and other divine functions, giving them the corresponding power.”</p><p>“Are you serious?”Jiao Li asked in surprise.</p><p>They had worked so hard for so many years and experienced so many dangers, yet others only needed to be conferred a title like this and they would be able to obtain almost, or even far more power?</p><p>Yu Jinghua said simply, “If you don’t believe me, you can directly ask the city god of Eternal Joy later.”</p><p>“This, how could this be…”Mao Jin shook his head and suddenly felt weak all over his body, as if he couldn’t do anything at all. His heart was filled with frustration and disappointment.</p><p>Yu Jinghua nodded affirmatively. “Although the number of star officers and other gods is limited, the city god land is everywhere.”</p><p>After saying that, the few of them fell into a terrible silence, as if there was no meaning to struggle for a moment. Everything in the past seemed to have been negated!</p><p>Was this the nightmare world?</p><p>It was as if they were about to break down their willpower from the very beginning!</p><p>After a while, when the train stopped completely, they gradually recovered from their training.</p><p>“The bestowal of the title is ultimately dependent on external things. It can be taken back at any time and fall into dust. We are moving forward step by step. We are much more grounded than them.”Mao Jin was the first to speak.</p><p>Luan Yaqian also said, “I saw that the Warriors in the nightmare world were full of vigor and worked hard in their training. It seems that their passion for martial arts was not hurt by the bestowal of the title. This is enough to show that the bestowal of the title is flawed. If they did not reach the end of their path and could not see any hope of moving forward, they would most likely not choose this path.”</p><p>“That makes sense. We can not belittle ourselves.”Zhu Tianming exhaled.</p><p>“That’s right. If we can grow to the godfiend level in the future and break away from reincarnation like the celestial miracle ‘primordial beginning heavenly venerate’and the mythical ‘Heavenly Emperor’, we will be many times better than them!”Jiao Li said fiercely.</p><p>Mao Jin had completely recovered, with a determined expression, he said, “Moreover, we have the secret six paths. Although it is a little shameless, it has given us enough fortuitous encounters and opportunities to obtain all kinds of magical things that far surpass our peers. As long as we do not die, the celestial miracle ‘primordial beginning heavenly venerate’and the mythical ‘Heavenly Emperor’will be our role models, far surpassing those who have been conferred the bestowment.”</p><p>Yu Jinghua nodded slightly in agreement and added,</p><p>“This trip is also a tempering of our minds. Alright, it’s time to get off.”</p><p>They did not say anything along the way. They found a simple but relatively clean inn to stay in, and they immediately felt that the mental turmoil from before had caused mental exhaustion. They were all lazy and did not want to move.</p><p>Yu Jinghua and Luan Yaqian sat on their chairs, leisurely strolling through the Myriad World Mall and various forums to relax.</p><p>Suddenly, Luan Yaqian called out softly, “So the six doors has issued a ‘Great Zhou Defense Manual’.”</p><p>“Great Zhou Defense Manual? What is that?”Mao Jin and the others were confused, and it sounded strange.</p><p>Luan Yaqian retracted her gaze, she said with a smile, “It’s the six doors combing through the various hostile forces of Great Zhou and providing them for the jianghu heroes and the people of Great Zhou to read. It allows them to effectively identify their enemies and raise their vigilance. If they discover anything, they can report it to the six doors in a timely manner. To us, this is a book that allows us to gain a deeper understanding of great Zhou. It can save us the trouble of searching for it.”</p><p>“So it’s this kind of thing. Not Bad, not bad at all.”Mao Jin praised her, then he looked at Luan Yaqian with a smile, “Read it to us in the way of ‘Elvish hymns’. At the same time, you can also eliminate our negative emotions and mental fatigue.”</p><p>Luan Yaqian did not decline. Her tone changed, and it was ethereal and tactful:</p><p>“… The Demon Gate was formed from the Heaven extermination gate, the blood cloth sect, the asura temple, and the temple of joy. The one who single-handedly accomplished this was their current sect master, ‘Demon Master’Han Guang.”</p><p>His mind was cleansed by the clear voice, and his entire body became transparent. Everyone, including Yu Jinghua, revealed a relaxed expression.</p><p>Luan Yaqian continued to read:</p><p>“Han Guang, nicknamed ‘Demon Master’, is also the ‘mythical’heavenly emperor…”</p><p>“HMM?”Mao Jin, who was shaking his head, was suddenly stunned. What did Luan Yaqian just read?</p><p>Luan Yaqian stopped in her tracks and looked at him blankly. She did not understand why, and so did the other three.</p><p>Mao Jin frowned. “You, repeat what you just said.”</p><p>Luan Yaqian nodded:</p><p>“Han Guang, nicknamed the ‘Demon Master’and also the ‘mythical’heavenly emperor. Uh, mythical? Heavenly Emperor? !”</p><p>Her eyes were wide open. Where did the ‘mythical’heavenly emperor come from?</p><p>Yu Jinghua was stunned for once. He looked at Mao Jin and the others in dismay. The ‘Heavenly Emperor’, who had always been known for being mysterious and tyrannical, was printed in the so-called ‘Defense Manual’just like that, and everyone knew about it?</p><p>They felt as if they had finally found out a secret, but when they went out, they found posters of the incident plastered all over the street.</p><p>Han guang was the “Mythical”heavenly emperor, Han Guang was the “Mythical”heavenly emperor, and Han Guang was the “Mythical”heavenly emperor!</p><p>“What the Hell Is This!”Jiao Li swore.</p><p>Yu Jinghua regained his composure and said, “Could it be another “Mythical”organization?”</p><p>Luan Yaqian read the rest of the book in a daze and said, “‘Myth’is an evil force formed by Han Guang and built on the space of six paths of reincarnation (the introduction of the space of six paths of reincarnation can be found on pages 19 to 22) …”</p><p>She could no longer read the rest of the book.</p><p>The space of six paths of reincarnation was written out in a straightforward manner, and the details could be found on pages 19 to 22!</p><p>“Wasn’t the person who leaked the six paths of reincarnation killed…”Mao Jin said in a tone that was even more lost than Luan Yaqian’s.</p><p>In their hearts, the six paths of reincarnation space was very secretive, and the person who leaked the six paths of reincarnation was killed. However, it had now become a part of the Great Zhou’s defense manual, as if they had committed a perfect crime without any flaws, who knew that when they opened the door, they would discover that the wanted poster was already pasted on the opposite wall!</p><p>Silence, silence again. Suddenly, Yu Jinghua lost control and said, “First, read pages nineteen to twenty-two!”</p><p>At this time, they seemed to have forgotten that they also had the myriad realm talisman, and they were clearly in a panic.</p><p>Luan Yaqian quickly flipped to page nineteen of the electronic book and read it very quickly:</p><p>“The six paths of reincarnation space is an organization that was established by some ancient factions. They forcefully pulled people over to eliminate the threat, used divine techniques and treasures to entice them to complete a specific mission and achieve the corresponding goal. There will be a detailed introduction later</p><p>“Currently, the six paths of reincarnation masters have been confirmed: Devil Buddha, unparalleled demon lord, Daolord Lu Ya, Emperor Fengdu, Daoist seven kills, water ancestor…”</p><p>Luan Yaqian’s mouth was half open as she looked at her teammates in shock and confusion. Even — even her identity as the six paths of reincarnation master had been announced!</p><p>How amazing was that!</p><p>Would we be killed if we knew about this?</p><p>How did we find out about this just like that? !</p><p>Moreover, the description just now seemed to be equivalent to “The currently confirmed fugitives are: Devil Buddha, unparalleled Devil Lord…”</p><p>“My mother, six paths’identity was written in a random book. The nightmare world is too terrifying, too terrifying…”Jiao Li shook his head violently, his mind in a trance.</p><p>Yu Jinghua was stunned for half a cup of tea before he said in a low voice amidst the shock and fear, “That’s not right. Shouldn’t six paths just erase the relevant content for this kind of thing and not let us read it?”</p><p>“Yes! What exactly is six paths thinking? Or is there something wrong with the content?”Mao Jin’s eyes were a little bloodshot.</p><p>“Wait a minute, I seem to have heard of the name of the Devil Buddha, the unparalleled demon lord and the others…”Yu Jinghua pondered, “The Devil Buddha has left behind legends in many worlds. He is a great figure who is on par with the real heavenly emperor. He is even more terrifying than a god or demon. He is truly a supreme figure! The unparalleled demon lord and the others are also great figures in the Legends!”</p><p>“I understand!”Mao Jin clapped his hands. “The six paths did not erase the corresponding content because they wanted to tell us how powerful ‘He’is.”</p><p>Luan Yaqian exhaled and lowered her head to read:</p><p>“Demon Buddha, sealed…”</p><p>The expressions of Zhu Tianming and the others that had just eased up froze again.</p><p>Dong Dong Dong. There was only the sound of heartbeats in the entire room. Even breathing was held.</p><p>After a long while, Luan Yaqian gathered her courage and finished reading:</p><p>“Unparalleled demon lord, you have invaded the Great Zhou dynasty, and there have been many bloody cases. You have been forced to wake up early and have lost an arm…”</p><p>“Fengdu Emperor, unknown.”</p><p>“Lu ya Dao lord, unknown.”</p><p>..</p><p>“What, what the F * ck is going on!”Mao Jin swore, and his entire spirit was on the verge of collapse.</p><p>No one answered. There was still silence.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Yu Jinghua flipped through his universal common sense amulet, pushed up his glasses, and said in a weak voice,</p><p>“I understand.”</p><p>“You understand?”Mao Jin and the others asked in unison.</p><p>Yu Jinghua took a deep breath and said, “The reason for not erasing the content is very simple. Since the six paths is not a force but an alliance of many parties, there must be internal conflicts. Perhaps the few who wrote ‘ominous’want to see the other few make a fool of themselves and reduce their influence on the reincarnators.”</p><p>“Also, I just flipped through the Great Zhou’s defense manual, but I didn’t see anything related to the ‘miracle’.”</p><p>Mao Jin’s eyes lit up. “You mean the work of the ‘miracle’?”</p><p>“Yes, the ‘myth’has been uncovered, and six paths has been exposed. Only a force that is very familiar with the matter of reincarnation can do it. The biggest suspect who satisfies the conditions and does not involve himself must be the ‘miracle’,”Yu Jinghua nodded and said.</p><p>“But, but aren’t the celestial miracle afraid of being wiped out by the six paths?”Luan Yaqian said in surprise.</p><p>Yu Jinghua was silent for a moment before he said,</p><p>“Perhaps the ‘primordial lord of the Celestial Miracle’already has the strength to arm-wrestle with the six paths.”</p><p>Mao Jin and the others were speechless again.</p><p>To be able to arm-wrestle with the six paths? What kind of terrifying strength was that!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
