It was really impossible to organize a language that could be communicated in a short period of time.</p><p>After experiencing so many reincarnated worlds, they more or less had the idea of exploring the secrets of the myth or figuring out the true identity of the six paths, but they never thought that they would find out in such a simple and easy way, it could be described as ridiculous and ironic.</p><p>What was going on?</p><p>What kind of nightmare world was this? !</p><p>In such chaos, panic, confusion, and astonishment, including Yu Jinghua, they all felt the same disappointment.</p><p>Yes, disappointment!</p><p>Putting aside the fact that six paths had forced them to complete the mission, reincarnation was full of danger. Becoming a member of a mysterious organization, with a powerful and seemingly omnipotent “Leader,”as long as they paid enough.., one could exchange for all sorts of mysterious and amazing things, and then descend into all sorts of strange worlds, changing the local situation or the fate of others… all of these could make the vast majority of reincarnators feel a strong sense of superiority.</p><p>Therefore, when facing “Natives,”they were often condescending and above the world. Even if they had good intentions, they were still condescending, like Gods, Buddhas, and saints who played the mortal world and helped others fulfill their wishes.</p><p>However, in this nightmare world, even the “Leader”six paths, who seemed to be omnipotent, was almost stripped of his “Underpants”and exposed in front of the world, their sense of superiority and sense of looking down on them were obviously shattered and disappeared.</p><p>Six paths was indeed very strong, but in this nightmare world, he was only one of the strongest. He was not the only one. There were many experts who could fight with them!</p><p>Thus, the mystery faded, and the halo weakened.</p><p>“The nightmare world is too scary…”after a long silence, Mao Jin murmured.</p><p>This was not the first time he had lamented something similar, but this time it was so different. He actually had some fear of the six paths from the past.</p><p>Luan Yaqian’s thoughts were scattered, and she replied, “The universal knowing talisman can connect to the so-called universe. If that immortal venerated Emperor Yuan of the hollow jade temple is willing, he might also be the master of the six paths of reincarnation…”</p><p>The Big Boss here could be described more accurately as the six paths level!</p><p>The others came back to their senses and re-formed from the broken pieces. Then, they let out meaningless but sincere sighs.</p><p>After a quarter of an hour, the sleepwalking crowd returned to the main topic.</p><p>Mao Jin said in a deep voice, “Remember all the six paths and myths in the defense manual. It might be of great use in the future.”</p><p>This was a secret that many reincarnators dreamed of!</p><p>No matter how easy it was to obtain, it was still a priceless secret. Of course, it was definitely worthless to the reincarnators who came from the nightmare world.</p><p>At this moment, Yu Jinghua said, “Actually, we can also get part of the secret of the ‘miracle’.”</p><p>“Ah?”The four of them looked at her in confusion.</p><p>If this was really the work of the ‘miracle’, it was enough to show that they had a deep relationship with the Great Zhou Dynasty and the nightmare world. How could their secret be exposed?</p><p>Were they going to kidnap the higher-ups of the Great Zhou dynasty and get in touch with the secret of such a level?</p><p>Yu Jinghua said, “I took a closer look. The ‘Heavenly Emperor’of the ‘myth’, Han Guang, was not captured, and the demon sect did not suffer a devastating blow. On one hand, it shows that they are good at hiding. On the other hand, it also shows that the ‘Miracle’is not omnipotent.”</p><p>“If it was really the work of the miracle, the Celestial Emperor would not have let it go. Not to mention immediate revenge, just releasing part of the secrets of the miracle could disgust and drive a wedge between the opponents. However, there is yin and yang in everything, and there is darkness and light in everything. No matter how the Great Zhou Dynasty conferred the title of God, it could not wipe out all the dirty things. There is no place for filth and filth in the world of happiness. As long as the heretics intend to, a certain secret can be spread to the world</p><p>“The reason why we can’t Find Them is that the Great Zhou has covered them up on the surface. As long as we can get in touch with the various sects and schools, we’ll be able to find out some of the secrets of the miracle sooner or later and find out the real identities of some of their members.”</p><p>As for what would happen after they found out their identities, Yu Jinghua didn’t say anything, but Mao Jin and the others all had some ideas. For example, they would be connected to the “Miracle”, and with the protection of the “Primordial Lord of Heaven”who could arm-wrestle with the six paths.., there would always be a chance to escape from reincarnation, and they would no longer be in danger!</p><p>This thought flashed through their minds, but no one dared to say it out loud. Otherwise, they would definitely be killed on the spot.</p><p>Looking at Yu Jinghua, Mao Jin suddenly sighed. “Jinghua, do you regret rejecting the ‘Celestial Miracle’back then?”</p><p>Yu Jinghua said, “I’m disappointed, but I don’t regret it. Because at that time, I only wanted to join them.”</p><p>His tone was calm and emotionless, but the deep affection he had made Mao Jin and the others feel moved. Yu Jinghua, who usually looked like an agent of the Mo family, actually had such deep and passionate feelings in his heart.</p><p>“Good! Our team can get through the missions time and time again by working together and sharing life and death together. If you don’t let us down, we won’t let you down either!”Mao Jin said with a sigh.</p><p>After a series of emotional exchanges, Yu Jinghua regained his calm face and said, “There’s no rush to inquire about the fairy tale. We can mix it up in the process of finding something to do separately, establishing a clean history, and looking for an opportunity to sneak into the Prince Jin’s residence.”</p><p>The five of them had to sneak in separately, otherwise it would attract too much attention!</p><p>Luan Yaqian smiled when she heard that. “With all the shocking developments in the nightmare world, maybe we don’t have to inquire about it. When we go out and go on the street, we’ll see the sign of the fairy tale office hanging in the most conspicuous place…”</p><p>The Perfect Joke had dispelled a lot of the gloominess from before.</p><p>..</p><p>Two months later, the five of them pretended that they were just fellow townsfolk and each found a job. They played their current roles wholeheartedly.</p><p>On this day and night, in the dilapidated house that Jiao Li rented, the small team met in secret to discuss the next highlight and sneak into the Prince Jin’s residence!</p><p>They did not choose to use the “Universal Common Sense Talisman”to communicate. They were sufficiently vigilant and vigilant against the things that controlled the great Saturday Fan Gate and the hollow jade temple of Kunlun Mountain.</p><p>This was due to their experience in the initial stage of a certain mission. At that time, they were placed in a technological world and were shocked by the convenient means of long-distance communication. Therefore, they discussed the mission situation in the chat group without any scruples, then, they were discovered by the Internet police and were immediately eliminated by the police. They suffered a serious setback. Fortunately, they did not have the time to carry out the “Conspiracy”at that time and did not mention the matter of reincarnation. They also had the real household registration given by six paths, after surviving the interrogation, they were only verbally reprimanded.</p><p>From then on, they were more cautious when it came to similar items.</p><p>“I haven’t had the time to investigate the matter of the celestial miracle in the past few days. I’ve finally found a way. I have a way…”Zhu Tianming was skilled in the power of the mind and was the leader of similar matters in the team. He was currently sharing his gains.</p><p>Before he could finish his words, he suddenly stopped because someone was approaching the room!</p><p>“It’s old Zhang. This fellow has a great tolerance for alcohol. No one in the residence can drink more than him. When he met me, he probably came to drink with me.”Jiao Li sensed it and heaved a sigh of relief. “I’ll get rid of him as soon as possible.”</p><p>Yu Jinghua and the others nodded and used their own methods to hide in the small room.</p><p>Knock, Knock, Knock. The door was knocked. Jiao Li heard it for two breaths. He strode over and cursed:</p><p>“Who is it? Yo, Big Brother Zhang, hey, is there alcohol again?”</p><p>Old Zhang was big and burly. He held a jar of wine and a bag of cooked food and laughed loudly. “The wife of my family is nagging. I came to find you for an excuse to talk to you so that I could have some free time.”</p><p>He and Jiao Li skillfully set the bowls and chopsticks, poured the wine, and did not say anything. They each drank a bowl first.</p><p>After drinking for a while, the tipsiness emerged, and old Zhang began to point out the matters in the manor, in the end, he clicked his tongue and said, “Nowadays, no one has a fixed character. They all hope to rely on the spark fire divine technique to make a name for themselves. So many servants have been recruited in the manor, how many young people are left? Only brothers know what’s good for them and respect their superiors!”</p><p>“I, Old Zhang, don’t know as much as they do, but I know one thing. It’s impossible for everyone in this world to be a hero and a hero, right? It’s impossible for everyone to make a name for themselves, right? Someone has to do the cleaning and cleaning of the floor, right? People have to be divided into different grades in the end! They are too young and naive. Heh, they will regret it sooner or later!”</p><p>Jiao Li thought about how to get rid of this guy and said casually, “Don’t they have a magical method that can attract some strongmen and finish the chores in a few moves?”</p><p>“Yo, brother, you know quite a lot. Can you read?”Old Zhang asked in surprise.</p><p>“A little. I can read the news in the world of universal knowledge,”Jiao Li said modestly.</p><p>Old Zhang Sighed. “It’s a pity that I can’t read. However, I, Old Zhang, have ears and a wide network of friends. I know as much as the world of Universal Knowledge!”</p><p>Hearing this, Jiao Li’s heart stirred. “I’ve been reading the ‘Great Zhou Defense Manual’recently. Brother Zhang, you know about it too?”</p><p>“Of course I know. The workshop leader specially organized US illiterate people to listen to it.”How could old Zhang admit defeat.</p><p>“I’ve always been puzzled. There are six paths in the manual, and there are myths. Why are there no miracles? I seem to have heard of miracles being six paths in the past,”Jiao Li asked without any hope.</p><p>Old Zhang chuckled. “How can there be news of Miracles? The six doors has long…”</p><p>He reached out his hand and made a gesture of erasing.</p><p>“Brother Zhang, are you saying that this miracle has a good relationship with our great Zhou?”Jiao li said in “Surprise”, and Yu Jinghua and the others beside him pricked up their ears.</p><p>Old Zhang took a sip of wine and hummed a small tune. “It’s more than good…”</p><p>He lowered his voice and said, “Even King Jin is a member of the Miracle!”</p><p>“What?”Jiao Li was shocked.</p><p>King Jin was a member of the Miracle? He knew the six paths of reincarnation like the back of his hand?</p><p>Mao Jin and the others felt like they were about to explode. King Jin was a member of the miracle! Their target was actually a member of the miracle!</p><p>Another god-level member?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
