The long-brewing rain poured down, sweeping across the sky and pouring on Li Zhongkang and the others.</p><p>They did not realize it at all and did not hide anything. However, when the bean-sized raindrops were about to hit, they would always be bounced away by the invisible layer of air, making it difficult for them to soak in the rain.</p><p>After passing through the first lightning tribulation, the most significant and most important changes were the generation of magical power, the protection of the body at any time, and the soaring wind and riding on the mist.</p><p>The rain splashed and the white foam turned into mist. Meng Qi raised the horsetail whisk in his hand and put it on the crook of his arm, he chuckled and said, “Since fellow Daoists like to discuss matters in the courtyard, I can only accompany you. Just now, I mentioned that we must leave a few of you in hiding to wait for an opportunity to appear and cooperate with the ninth prince to get that extraordinary item. Now, I would like to ask, which fellow Daoists are willing?”</p><p>The last six words were like spring thunder. Their voices shook the gods, causing the ninth prince, Xiao Kun, and the others to tremble and completely wake up.</p><p>They looked at each other. After spending more than ten breaths of time, they finally understood what had happened and fell into deep thought.</p><p>Staying in the capital would definitely be extremely dangerous and not allow the slightest bit of exposure. It was completely different from the illustrious life of the past. However, all of them were experts in the capital. They were rooted in this place for decades or even generations, and they were very reluctant to part with it, moreover, they were not familiar with the capital and would be hunted down by the imperial court. It would not be very comfortable.</p><p>All of a sudden, they had a lot of thoughts. It was difficult for them to make a decision. The sound of the rain beside their ears cut off the hustle and bustle of the mortal world.</p><p>“I am willing to stay in the capital to assist the ninth Prince.”Li Zhongkang’s expression changed a few times. He gritted his teeth and said.</p><p>If the situation took a turn for the better and Haotian Taoism returned to its former glory, the person who would ascend to the throne and become the Emperor would be the ninth prince, Xiao Kun. It would be better to send charcoal in the snow than to add flowers to the brocade in the future!</p><p>With Li Zhongkang leading the way, Bi Chongde and the chief of the Fenghuo Temple, Lu Siquan, expressed their determination to hide in the capital.</p><p>“Good. The three fellow Daoists do not care about life and death. They are the role models of the sect. Please accept my greetings.”Meng Qi cupped his fists and turned to look at the ninth king, Xiao Kun, “I’m afraid that it would be insufficient to rely on the fellow Daoists if we want Grand Master Pei to leave the capital and personally take charge of the peace and disorder. I plan to meet the number one person in the world tomorrow.”</p><p>Grand Master Pei, Pei Daotong, was a seventh tribulation Daoist master. He was able to create objects in the void and roam the world. Ever since the fall of Celestial Master Xu, he was the number one person in the world.</p><p>Xiao Kun was stunned at first, then his eyes twitched. He said in surprise, “Senior, be careful. Grand Master Pei’s ‘Jade Emperor Divine Fist’has shaken the world. You Can’t underestimate it. It’s better to wait until senior has recovered to the peak before you make a fuss.”</p><p>“Although you have experienced the lightning tribulation once again and become a Daoist master, the gap between you and Grand Master Pei, who is a Daoist master of seven tribulations, can not be calculated in the same way. How can you do such a Thing?”?</p><p>Thinking back to what had happened just now, he and everyone present had confirmed that Daoist Master Yun Ji only had the strength of one tribulation. However, from the fact that he had easily transcended the tribulation like a game, his reputation in the past was not fake. He still had some accumulation. It was just that he did not know what had gone wrong, as a result, he had lost all of his cultivation base and was slowly returning to his peak.</p><p>Li Zhongkang and the others nodded in agreement with the nine kings. From how senior Yunji had transcended the lightning tribulation during the break in the discussion today, as long as he was given enough time and did not mention the seven tribulations, at least he would be able to recover his original strength, as for Reverend Six tribulations, he was already one of the few existences in the Dao sect. He could not risk his life!</p><p>Meng Qi waved his horsetail whisk and said with a smile, “Don’t worry, ninth king. Fellow Daoists, don’t worry. It will only be a short while. It’s not a direct confrontation. Besides, I have my own brilliant plan.”</p><p>After saying that, he passed through the curtain of rain and walked back into the room. He said, “I’ve made up my mind.”.</p><p>The rest of them looked at each other in dismay. For a moment, they felt heavy and worried.</p><p>..</p><p>Deep in the palace, in the imperial study.</p><p>Xiao Xuan, the son of Heaven, stood by the window with his hands behind his back, wearing a nine dragons pearl robe. He looked at the rain that had not dissipated for several days. His lips were tightly pursed, forming a rigid line.</p><p>He was almost seventy years old, but there was no sign of aging. His flesh and skin seemed to contain a huge amount of power. His eyes were as deep as the sea, and he looked to be in his early thirties. If he stood together with the ninth king, Xiao Kun, others would probably think that they were brothers.</p><p>Grand tutor Pei Daotong sat steadily on the back chair bestowed by the Emperor. He looked at Xiao Xuan’s back without the slightest bit of impetuous emotion, as if he was a towering mountain.</p><p>He cleaned himself up meticulously. The hair on his temples, lips, and Chin were not messy at all, as if they were carved from steel. His eyes were awe-inspiring, and no one dared to look him in the eye.</p><p>At the top of Pei Daotong’s head was a desk where Xiao Xuan was correcting memorials. In the center of the desk was a glass lamp. It was light gold in color, sparkling and translucent. The oil of the lamp was transparent, and it seemed to be invisible. Now, the flame was like a bean, swaying with the wind, it caused the light and darkness in the surroundings to constantly change, giving it a somewhat strange color.</p><p>“During these two days of searching, we didn’t find a Daoist master of Lightning Tribulation?”Xiao Xuan didn’t turn around. He continued to look out of the window. The dark clouds were dense, and the drizzle was incessant.</p><p>Pei Daotong spoke calmly, without a trace of emotion, “Yes, I suspect that someone leaked the news. The fate has changed.”</p><p>Xiao Xuan suddenly let out a long sigh. He turned around and looked at the side of the desk:</p><p>“Yes, the destiny has indeed changed. How can you teach me, Venerable One?”</p><p>In the imperial study room, besides the emperor, Xiao Xuan, and Grand Master Pei Daotong, there was actually another person!</p><p>At the side of the desk stood a monk in a gray monk robe. He was looking at the glass lamp. His face was handsome, and there was a faint smile at the corner of his mouth. He looked very relaxed.</p><p>Hearing Xiao Xuan’s question, the gray-robed monk smiled. “Your Majesty, there’s no need to panic.”</p><p>Xiao Xuan frowned and asked in a deep voice,</p><p>“Venerable Anan, what do you mean?”</p><p>The grey-robed monk known as Venerable Anan smiled and said,</p><p>“Let’s wait and see.”</p><p>..</p><p>The rain fell like silk, and the dark clouds gradually dispersed. Pei Daotong left the palace city in a palanquin, accompanied by the nine kings, Xiao Kun.</p><p>He closed his eyes and seemed to be in a deep sleep, but in fact, he was thinking about the changes in the capital in the past few days, in order to grasp the key points.</p><p>The master had many followers, and the group was huge. They did not move forward quickly. It took them some time to leave Vermilion Bird Street and turn to Qingyang Square. At this point, Xiao Kun was about to part ways with Pei Daotong.</p><p>Due to the continuous rainy days, there were few pedestrians around. Each of them held an oil-paper umbrella and walked carefully. When the wind blew, the water on the ground rippled, and not a speck of dust could be seen.</p><p>At this moment, Pei Daotong, who was in the sedan chair, suddenly opened his eyes. Specks of lightning gathered in his eyes. It was as if he was surrounding a supreme god, reflecting the entire scene of the Quiet Street next to him:</p><p>A thin Daoist dressed in a black robe was walking slowly. He held a bamboo hat in his hand and was bathing in the drizzle. It was as if he was enjoying all kinds of nature.</p><p>One step, two steps, three steps. The Heaven and earth seemed to have been enlarged infinitely, and both sides seemed to have suddenly become smaller.</p><p>Zhenren Yunji! The ninth king, Xiao Kun, was shocked, frightened, and worried.</p><p>“It’s only the first tribulation…”Pei Daotong muttered. He stretched out his right hand, and countless silver lights converged, condensing into a bolt of lightning with ancient patterns. It was a divine arrow with a tangible touch.</p><p>Just as he was about to shoot out this lightning arrow, he saw Meng Qi smile lightly.</p><p>The Sky suddenly turned dark, and the lead clouds gathered, as if they were about to crush the capital. Countless silver-white lightning converged into one and struck down with a loud bang. The terrifying force separated Pei Daotong and Meng Qi on both sides.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The lightning exploded, and the silver light spread out like water, surging toward Pei Daotong.</p><p>Meng Qi, who was enduring the heavenly punishment, did not feel it at all and took another step forward.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Another bolt of lightning fell. Gold and silver mixed together, and its power was even stronger than before.</p><p>In the rolling lightning ball, Meng Qi, who was wearing a black robe and wrapped in lightning, took another step forward.</p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p>The heavens were furious, and the five golden lightning bolts struck at the same time.</p><p>Xiao Kun was dumbfounded when he saw this, and he muttered to himself,</p><p>“Second tribulation… third tribulation… Fourth Tribulation…”</p><p>One step, one lightning tribulation, one breath, one ascension!</p><p>Pei Daotong watched as Meng Qi slowly walked over. The lightning struck his body, and he actually felt as if his aura was being snatched away. The divine arrow in his hand actually couldn’t be shot out.</p><p>In the end, the dark clouds seemed to have arrived at the surface of the Earth. The Lightning formed a sea, and it spread out in circles. The deeper they went, the more terrifying it was.</p><p>The Sea of lightning of various colors slowly parted. Meng Qi lifted his bamboo hat and appeared not far away from Pei Daotong.</p><p>He put on his bamboo hat and smiled:</p><p>“This old Daoist has also gone through seven tribulations.”</p><p>Pei Daotong’s gaze turned cold. With the guidance of his Qi, the Divine Lightning Arrow finally shot out and pierced through Meng Qi. However, his figure was like a bubble, slowly dissipating.</p><p>If not for the presence of the Lightning, what happened just now would have been like a dream.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
