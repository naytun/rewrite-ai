The Green Emperor had said that the Bodhi ancient Buddha’s seal was mysterious. It would take half a year for it to be worn down and put to use by the god Ascension Roll.</p><p>Inside the hollow jade temple, Meng Qi, who was sitting at the head of the table, and Guang Chengzi, Celestial Master Wen Shu, and the other great abhijnas on both sides did not say a word. They all smiled and cupped their hands, bidding farewell. The atmosphere was harmonious and harmonious.</p><p>Clang!</p><p>Meng Qi was the last to step out of the hollow jade temple. The door opened and closed without any wind. The former heavenly venerate of primordial beginning’s Daoist Hall seemed to have a little bit of spirituality, and it still did not acknowledge Meng Qi as its true master.</p><p>With a smile on his face, Meng Qi took a step forward and returned to his own Kunlun Mountain, descending into the ancient Daoist Temple.</p><p>He Mu, Fang huayin, Yu Banshan, Qi Jinxiu, Sun Wu, Da Qinggen, and Xiao Tianquan, who had come back from visiting the demons, stood on both sides of the hall. When they sensed Meng Qi’s return, they all turned around and bowed together:</p><p>“Congratulations to master (teacher) for ascending to the destiny realm and possessing sufficient skills!”</p><p>“Congratulations to youngest uncle (Hierarch Lord) for sailing in the sea of bitterness and operating the destiny realm!”</p><p>Looking at the familiar faces and listening to the friendly words, Meng Qi smiled slightly. With his hands behind his back, he slowly walked past them and sat down under the statue of the heavenly venerate of primordial beginning.</p><p>This was his own training hall.</p><p>Of course, he also hoped that one day, the doors of the Real Hollow Jade Palace would open and welcome him.</p><p>..</p><p>In a certain secret area, Han Guang, who seemed to have just woken up from a long slumber, stroked the Bodhi magical tree in his palm. The faint aura emanating from his body surrounded him and turned into mist. The left side was dark and gloomy, full of destruction and depravity, the right side was hazy and hazy, and time was like water. It seemed to overlook the vicissitudes of the world, as if it had transcended eternity. At the intersection of the two, a ten-thousand-character character was condensed. At times, it was turning straight, and at other times, it was turning golden yellow. At other times, it was going in the opposite direction, and it was dark red.</p><p>“The cause of all the consequences…”he repeated it again as if he was sighing.</p><p>At this time, a person slowly walked out from the thick mist that pervaded the secret area. He was wearing a big red robe and a fishtail crown. His face was ancient, and his figure was short. It was Lu Ya, who had disappeared for several years due to the backlash from the nail-head seven arrow book.</p><p>Lu Ya glanced at Han Guang and chuckled. “It hasn’t been long since you became confident of becoming a legend. Why haven’t you broken through yet? Why have you been suppressing and accumulating your strength? What exactly are you waiting for?”</p><p>“I’m waiting for a chance.”Han Guang snapped out of his thoughts. His face was suffused with his trademark carefree smile, making it impossible for others to see the true thoughts and emotions in his heart, “I just didn’t expect Su Meng to be able to create such a good fortune so quickly…”</p><p>Before he could finish his sentence, he suddenly had a sudden inspiration. It was as if a pair of eyes had opened out of nowhere and were looking down at him indifferently and mercilessly!</p><p>Oh No! His karma had reached such a degree? Han Guang’s expression changed slightly. The Bodhi magical tree in his palm suddenly bloomed with a clear radiance, causing his aura and body to instantly show signs of emptiness.</p><p>At the same time, a small vermillion gourd leaped out from Lu Ya’s hand. White light surged out, and a ray of light burst forth, freezing the karma and severing the connection.</p><p>This secret place was a fragment of the immemorial immortal world. Being able to hide from the search of the other side was one of Lu Ya’s life-saving methods. However, it was not a shortcut. If the name of the other side was mentioned, it would still be sensed, and now, the karma of that person from Kunlun mountain actually had such a mystical effect of the other side?</p><p>..</p><p>Sitting under the statue of the heavenly venerate of Yuanshi, Meng Qi slowly withdrew his gaze from the empty space and nodded thoughtfully.</p><p>His condition had long surpassed the requirements for self-proof legends. Could it be that he wanted to learn from little sang and refine and condense two opposing illusory daos as soon as he advanced, establishing the most solid foundation for the good fortune..</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and looked at he mu and the other disciples, continuing the topic from before:</p><p>“The closer you are to the other shore, the more you know how small you are. You should not be arrogant and only know how to rely on your power. Of course, the hollow jade temple is the direct disciple of the original heavenly venerate, the leader of the Dao sect’s nine venerables. Naturally, we are not like small sects. Now that I am blessed, many things in the past are no longer useful. Therefore, we might as well build a sect’s treasury. If there are enough contributions, or those who have attained the dharma body, they can choose a treasure from it.”</p><p>Under the curious gazes of Fang huayin, Qi Jinxiu, and the others, as well as the expectant gazes of the great green root, Meng Qi extended his right hand and formed a sword with his fingers. With a light slash, the void split open, and yin and Yang split apart. Earth, fire, wind, and water gushed out like a storm, another World was formed.</p><p>The world shrank, and Earth, fire, wind, and water condensed. Black and white yin and yang poured in, forming one blurry dao pattern after another. Layers of restrictions formed, and finally, it turned into a gray stone door that stood on the left side of the primordial beginning statue.</p><p>Creating a world, a creation from the void!</p><p>This was the Treasury of the Jade Void Palace.</p><p>Legend had it that when one reached the realm, the grotto-heaven created was an incomplete heaven and earth. When one reached the realm of creation, it was to create the universe. When one was close to the other side and the real world in one’s body was about to take shape, it was to create a world that was slightly lower than the heavens. Although Meng Qi had just entered the realm of creation.., however, after cultivating the heaven opening seal and condensing the Great Dao of illusion, the Heaven and earth created was already beyond the scope of the normal universe, and was close to the most ancient universe.</p><p>As for creating things in the void, it was a symbol shared by all the great divine arts practitioners.</p><p>Then, Meng Qi shook his sleeve and many things flew out and circled in the air. There was the Li immortal sword with five colors of red, green, yellow, white, and black. There was the wood-based wind and Fire Phoenix Sword. There was the soaring dragon sword that was surrounded by clouds and water, there was the Alaya Sword that was filled with wisdom and purity. There was the mysterious and mysterious three era bright king wheel that pointed straight at the memory fragments in the deepest part of the soul. There were also many precious treasures.</p><p>At this moment, Meng Qi only had a few things left on him, such as the Overlord Saber, the tree of Great Dao, the demonic blood peach, and the Heavenly Wheel of life and death and the sea-stabilizing pearl in the depths of the Abyss Sea.</p><p>The great green root looked at the treasures floating in the air and almost drooled. It hurriedly said, “Master, master, if I, if I have contributed enough or obtained a dharma body, can I choose one from the Treasury?”</p><p>“As the jade void sect’s gatekeeper, you can.”Meng Qi smiled and changed the topic. “Previously, you were too selfish in congratulating the world and damaged our sect’s image. Your contribution will be deducted by 100,000.”</p><p>The Great Green Root’s green face instantly turned white. He said shakily, “Master, how do you calculate the contribution?”</p><p>Meng Qi looked at He Mu and said with a smile, “The few of you draw up the specific regulations. The standard is that the great green root guards the gatekeeper and counts as 50 contributions a year.”</p><p>“50 contribution points a year, 500 contribution points in 10 years, 5000 contribution points in 100 years, 50,000 contribution points in 100 years, 50,000 contribution points in 100 years, 2000 contribution points in 2000 years. The era has ended…”the great green root muttered to itself as if it had received a great blow, but also as if it wanted to vent its anger and become stronger, it wanted to increase its own strength as soon as possible.</p><p>After giving this order, Meng Qi looked at he mu again:</p><p>“He Mu, your master has calculated that you have an opportunity to be in the monster clan star area. Moreover, you have borrowed a divine weapon from the treasury and have carried it far away.”</p><p>He Mu was stunned for a moment, then fell to his knees:</p><p>“Thank you for your guidance, Master.”</p><p>When the Almighty returned, the stars fell like rain. On the one hand, it was the Qi pulling that brought about the changes in the sky. On the other hand, when they left the real world, all of them took away the fragments of the real world created by the ancient war or the area of their own cave dwellings, and evolved into many stars, and then came back, Hanging Outside Qingming, as big as the wind lantern of death, can compete with the bright moon.</p><p>Among them, the stars belonging to the demon race converged into a galaxy, surrounding the helpless heaven, fantasy heaven, demon origin heaven, and other places, forming a region.</p><p>After thanking Meng Qi, he mu took a light breath. After pondering for a moment, he chose the Li immortal sword with five colors without hesitation.</p><p>“All of you can leave. I have something to discuss with Xiao Tianquan.”Seeing that he mu had finished choosing, Meng Qi nodded slightly and said.</p><p>In just a few breaths, only Xiao Tianquan, who was sitting obediently, and Meng Qi, who was sitting under the statue of the primordial Lord of Heaven, were left in the hall.</p><p>“Woof, youngest uncle-master, you want to ask me about visiting the demon Emperor Hall? Those guys are very perfunctory and have no sincerity at all!”Xiao Tianquan took the initiative to say.</p><p>Meng Qi still had a smile on his face:</p><p>“Let’s put this matter aside for now. This penniless priest has something to ask you. where is Erlang Now?”</p><p>“Erlang? Isn’t He in a deep sleep?”Xiao Tianquan was stunned and asked in return.</p><p>Meng Qi said with a smile that was not a smile,</p><p>“Senior brother Guangcheng, who has completed his good fortune, has completely woken up for a while. Why is Erlang still in a deep sleep?”</p><p>“Is it because he has already reached the other shore, or is it because among the great divine arts practitioners who have woken up and returned, who has long fallen and been quietly replaced by him?”</p><p>His voice was not loud, but it sounded like thunder in Xiao Tianquan’s ears. He stammered, “Woof, woof, I don’t know either…”</p><p>Meng Qi smiled and said, “This penniless priest understands. You can leave now.”</p><p>Xiao Tianquan’s tail drooped as he walked out of the door. Just as he was about to leave the hall, he saw Meng Qi pat his sleeves and stand up slowly, as if he was about to leave.</p><p>“Sect master martial uncle, you, where are you going?”Xiao Tianquan asked curiously.</p><p>Meng Qi smiled:</p><p>“As the current sect master of Yuxu, and having already created a good fortune, in public and in private, in etiquette and in matters, we should all go to thirty-three days away and ask Martial Uncle Dao De.”</p><p>With a flick of his sleeve, his figure disappeared into the main hall.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
