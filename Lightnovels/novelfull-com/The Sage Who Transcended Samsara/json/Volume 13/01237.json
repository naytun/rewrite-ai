The Pure Land was strangely and resolutely absorbing his power. It was difficult to control and could not be reversed. Waves of blood-yellow mist rippled outward like water waves.</p><p>His recovery could not keep up with the absorption. In just eighteen breaths, the power of this body would be exhausted… Meng Qi’s heart was like a mirror. His thoughts spun and he accurately judged his own condition. The Asura primogenitor beside him was also red in color, a crimson glow that contained a terrifying killing intent and battle will was emitted.</p><p>Seeing this, Netherworld laughed out loud. “The Buddha measured the netherworld. How could he let go of the origin of life and death? The nine stone temples around the river of Netherworld were built for this!”</p><p>“In the past, I didn’t understand their mysteries, but after i stepped into the origin of life and death, everything became clear and clear</p><p>“In the Pure Land, other than where I was standing, every place was absorbing energy to connect the corresponding Pure Land of the nine stone temples and form the illusory huangquan. The river was reversed and the origin of life and death was opened</p><p>“When the time comes, yellow spring will be about to die, and only the ‘Daoist of life and death’will appear. I would like to thank the two fellow Daoists for their ‘help’in advance.”</p><p>There was unconcealable ecstasy in his ill-intentioned tone. He had deliberately exposed his whereabouts and leaked the secret so that there would be experts chasing after him to replenish the power of the nine pure lands!</p><p>This thought echoed in the surroundings and did not take long. However, after the laughter ended, yellow spring found that both the asura primogenitor and the kid who stole his bones had calm expressions, there was no anger, no shock, and no panic.</p><p>Seeing Netherworld’s serious and suspicious gaze on him, the asura primogenitor raised his right hand and pressed it on his left chest. His voice was like thousands of blunt knives scraping against white bones:</p><p>“True force is weakened in the underworld society. Even if I’m still not as strong as he was back then, the difference is not too far. The strength of the fellow Daoist beside me is enough to make up for it!”</p><p>He was actually considering whether his power was enough to open the origin of life and death for the netherworld. As he spoke, his right hand suddenly pulled, as if tearing something. His entire body suddenly expanded, it turned into a terrifying monster that was many times larger than Mount Meru.</p><p>His entire body was dark, and he had nine heads. They were divided into anger, lust, and slaughter. They had a total of a thousand eyes, densely packed, and penetrating into the human heart. It made the witnesses’hair stand on end, and his body was covered in a layer of flames that was like blood light, the depths were completely black and dark like the night. 990 arms bloomed like petals, and 24 huge legs covered in scales seemed to support the god of Heaven Mountain.</p><p>As the Asura Primogenitor’s true form appeared, the entire pure land sank into a red light that was filled with the smell of blood. Headless bodies, broken arms, and broken limbs could be seen everywhere. The spirits gathered around them and turned into the appearances of ancient demon gods, these were the great beings that the asura primogenitor had killed back then.</p><p>After the Asura clan had reached the demigod and half-demon stage, every time they killed a powerful life form, they would absorb a portion of the power and obsession of the other party and evolve into a guardian ghost. Even if they were destroyed, they would be able to reassemble in the future, therefore, the more they killed, the stronger they became. The terror of the asura primogenitor, who had fought since the beginning of the nine remoteness world, was self-evident!</p><p>Amidst the wailing of ghosts, the terrifying killing intent and strengthened fighting will swept across the Pure Land, connecting all the realms and connecting “Him and me”. It made countless figures stand out, transmitting power like the ocean of the universe, turning this place into an Asura battlefield, the war and the slaughter were almost solid, and even the illusory river of time could be vaguely seen.</p><p>“Are you satisfied with this power?”Asura primogenitor did not attack or defend. He simply stood there and looked down at Netherworld.</p><p>Netherworld was momentarily stunned. “You?”</p><p>The nine heads of the asura primogenitor laughed in unison:</p><p>“Didn’t I say it? The willing will take the bait!”</p><p>He was not afraid of being used to open the origin of life and death. He was afraid that he would not even have a chance!</p><p>At that time, even if his power was completely absorbed, he would still be able to sense the opening of the origin of life and death. From there, he would be able to comprehend the profoundness of death. If there was still a little bit of power left, he would be able to follow Netherworld into it.</p><p>As for Netherworld’s silence, that was something that he had to face and resolve. It was just like facing a situation where his lifespan was about to end!</p><p>Netherworld was not used to his opponent cooperating with him in such a manner. He turned his head to look at Meng Qi. The blood-yellow fog around him suddenly expanded and spread throughout the world, turning into a long river that was filled with destruction and death, the power was transferred to this pure land without any reservation or resistance.</p><p>Seeing yellow spring looking over, Meng Qi put his hands behind his back and smiled:</p><p>“It’s just a yellow spring incarnation. If I can exchange it for the activation of the origin of life and death, I’ll Lose My Life!”</p><p>“Besides, the ‘sacrifice’is your skeleton, but to me, it’s just a worldly possession. If I can explore the origin of life and death before Emperor Fengdu uses the little foodie to enter the origin of life and death, it would be great to be prepared!”!</p><p>As for the matter of absorbing the power of the original body through the incarnation, Meng Qi was not afraid at all. He was the ’cause of all consequences’!</p><p>At this point, he turned around and pointed at the entrance of the Pure Land. He said jokingly, “If the power of Asura and I are not enough, we have prepared a little friend. I hope you are satisfied.”</p><p>Before he finished his words, a red light flashed at the entrance of the Pure Land. The Bloody Massacre Daoist appeared in a sorry state. His power was crazily absorbed by the barrier. The distance of more than a hundred feet to escape was like the ends of the earth to him!</p><p>The opponent who was scheming to take advantage of him cooperated so well without any ill feelings. Netherworld, who was originally overjoyed, was confused. His goal had indeed been achieved as he had expected, but there was something wrong with the development!</p><p>Shouldn’t he be cursing angrily and trying his best to get rid of him, trying to capture him or escape from the Pure Land, but to no avail? could he only watch the conspiracy succeed?</p><p>What was going on with these two guys who were practically smiling? !</p><p>They even asked if he was enough!</p><p>As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Netherworld suppressed all his strange feelings. His hands turned black and white as he pressed down. They intertwined with each other, forming a yin-yang phenomenon that completely drove the pure land.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>Amidst the illusory sound, the energy that was absorbed surged out, crossing time and pouring into the next pure land.</p><p>Boom!</p><p>The limestone temples that surrounded the river of the Yellow Springs began to shake violently one after another. One by one, the stone green lamps lit up without wind or fire, emitting a warm halo.</p><p>Hualala, the reincarnation of the river of the Yellow Springs saw a section of the Blood Yellow River appearing high in the sky of the Pure Land. It contained life and death, and it was full of sinking and flowing endlessly.</p><p>Sections of the illusory river of the yellow springs were connected as one, forming a cycle. They interacted with the real river of the Yellow Springs, and it immediately caused waves to surge into the sky, as ghosts cried and split the clouds.</p><p>Crash!</p><p>The river of the Yellow Springs actually reversed for a short while. The illusory blood yellow suddenly condensed and turned into a colorless point. The deepest and most profound intent of death spread out from it, but it also contained vigorous vitality.</p><p>The colorless point suddenly expanded, as if it was acting as a strange vortex. The reincarnation of the Yellow Springs didn’t care about the fact that most of the killing power had been exhausted. Meng Qi, the asura primogenitor, and the bloody massacre Daoist suddenly flew up and threw themselves into it.</p><p>The opportunity to enter was only for a few short moments!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
