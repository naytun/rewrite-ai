Can I contact you?”</p><p>For example, if he directly used the universal symbol to communicate, it would be said that it was everywhere. After knowing the situation, what was the difference between going out and not going out?</p><p>The Great Green Root’s branches swayed, and behind him was the snowy-haired Xiao Tian Quan, he smiled and said, “Master, please come in. Allow me to tell you in detail. Some things are inconvenient for outsiders to know. Hehe, after entering the hollow jade temple, there will be ripples caused by the universal symbol ball. It will be able to block many people’s ears.”</p><p>Xuan bei just nodded and took a step forward. He followed the great green root into the hollow jade temple and came to the place where the guests were received. Outside the window, the flowers and trees were flourishing, and it was quiet all around.</p><p>The great green root looked left and right and made a good posture, he deliberately lowered his voice and said, “Master, you don’t know. A few days ago, my master heard a secret from Demon Emperor Qi Zhengyan. He knew that the ancient evil God had returned from the Netherworld and appeared by the bank of the blood-yellow river. It seems that he is heading to the origin of life and death…”</p><p>At this point.., he smiled flatteringly again. “This kind of thing is considered a great secret of the heavens. Originally, it can not be told to outsiders, but how can master be considered an outsider? Not only did the sect master never forget his teacher’s kindness, but even I have often heard of master’s benevolence. I have long admired and been close to him. Now that I have seen him, he is far more famous than I am.”</p><p>Xiao Tianquan’s tail stood up when he heard this. He had the urge to bite this fellow. Fortunately, Da Qinggen saw that Xuan Bei’s expression did not change, as if he did not fall for this trick, he quickly returned to the main topic, “Master should also be clear that my sect master is in possession of the bones of the netherworld. It is impossible for him to ignore the return of the ancient evil God, the netherworld. Hence, he purposely found a few secret entrances to the nine Netherworld from the demon emperor. Now that he is out, it is to pursue this matter. He is in the nine Netherworld and I am afraid that I can not contact him with the myriad realm talisman.”</p><p>“Amitabha, I see.”Xuan bei nodded. He saw that everything was clear and great green root’s emotions and thoughts were protected by the hollow jade temple. He could not use his telepathic thoughts to sense it, so he chose to believe it.</p><p>He had seen his disciple’s personality and his usual behavior. He would never do anything to avoid seeing them.</p><p>At the same time, he muttered in his heart and repeated the words “Ancient evil god, Yellow River of blood”and “Yellow River of blood”. It was as if he had been touched and was thinking about something.</p><p>If he could understand the secrets of the Yellow River and integrate it into his own pure land, could he save the suffering ghosts in the netherworld, could he keep all living beings away from the evil interests of Hell, all the sins, all the resentment, and all the obsessions.., he would be able to use his own Buddhist dharma to resolve all of them. In the future, those who wanted to reincarnate would be sent to samsara. Those who wanted to cultivate Buddhist dharma would be left in the Pure Land. He would not force them..</p><p>Seeing that Meng Qi was indeed not around, Xuan bei stood up and said, “Sorry for disturbing you. I still have some matters to attend to, so I will take my leave first.”</p><p>The great green root hurriedly said, “Master, please wait. If the Hierarch Master finds out that I have neglected you so much, I am afraid that he will not be able to avoid punishment. I wonder why you are in such a difficult situation that you need the Hierarch Master’s Help?”</p><p>After saying that, it added with a sullen face, “Some things don’t necessarily need the hierarch master to solve. I have lived for a long time and have seen a lot. Perhaps I can help you solve your problems and give you some ideas.”</p><p>Hearing the words “Live for a long time”, Xuan Bei’s expression relaxed. He put his palms together and said,</p><p>“Thank you, almsgiver.”</p><p>After he finished telling Tian Wanzhe’s father about his suffering in hell, great green root immediately chuckled, he said confidently, “If master wants to ferment all the ghosts in Hell and save all the suffering beings, I indeed have no way. However, it is very simple to ferment one.”</p><p>Before he finished his sentence.., his branch pointed at Xiao Tianquan. “Master, this is the watchdog of our Jade Void Palace. It has a legendary realm. One of the ‘projections of him and me’is related to hell. With this, you can use the universal knowing talisman as a basis to cast the Ksitigarbha divine ability in your own pure land. You can directly drag the ghost out of the Netherworld and let it listen to the Buddhist teachings in front of you, eliminating its obsession.”</p><p>“Woof…”Xiao Tianquan did not expect to be implicated. He was momentarily stunned, then, he heard great green root continue, “Master, you can follow this method for the other ghost spirits that have their souls bound. There’s no need to Rush Xiao Tianquan to return to the Hollow Jade Temple.”</p><p>Xuan bei was eager to save the ghost. Seeing that there was indeed a chance of success, he turned to look at the black-furred dog. “Almsgiver Xiao Tian, are you willing to follow me to ferry the souls of the Dead?”</p><p>All spirits were equal. They could not be forced to do things just because the other party was a dog. More importantly, this was a dog with a legendary realm!</p><p>Xiao Tian Quan was stunned. He remembered youngest uncle’s attitude toward this master, so he said, “Woof… I, I have no problem.”</p><p>After the matter was settled, the great green root stood in front of the hollow jade temple’s door and watched Xuan bei and Xiao Tian Quan leave. In an instant, they disappeared without a trace.</p><p>After a short period of peace, the great green root suddenly stood with its arms akimbo and laughed out loud:</p><p>“Damn dog, no matter how strong you are, you can’t Beat My Wisdom as vast as the sea. Without making a sound, I made you leave the Hollow Jade Temple, and you won’t be able to return for a long period of time!”</p><p>Free! Free! I, the great green root, can be free for a period of time!</p><p>Before the laughter stopped, the shadow of a dog appeared beside it. It raised its hind legs, and a yellow line appeared, landing at the bottom of the great green root.</p><p>At the same time, Xiao Tianquan asked curiously, “Woof, what are you laughing at?”</p><p>The smile on the great green root froze. There was only one thought in its heart. This fellow was everywhere, everywhere..</p><p>..</p><p>In Tian Wanzhe’s home, Xuan bei Jie sat in the lotus position, revealing the golden body of Ksitigarbha. The light shone on the house, making everything seem as if it was plated with glass. It was clear and clean, warm and peaceful.</p><p>A golden lotus throne rose under his body, surrounded by the ghosts and ghosts of the past. They were focused on listening to the Buddhist teachings and feeling the Lun Yin. Their past obsession and pain had dissipated quite a bit, and in the crevices formed by them.., one by one, the golden flowers on the other shore bloomed, uprooting the sins. Tian wanzhe, who was watching from the side, felt a sense of awe and could not help but chant the Buddhist chant.</p><p>After the miniature Ksitigarbha Pure Land was formed, Xuan bei formed a hand seal and pressed it towards the universal symbol. Zen light surged out and transformed into a black and white wheel, as if it was controlling the mysteries of life and death in the heavens.</p><p>When Xiao Tianquan saw this, he took a step forward and stood in front of the Lotus platform. A huge dog with dozens of heads appeared in the sky above his body. The pair of red eyes that were like magma froze the aura of death.</p><p>Roar!</p><p>The huge dog roared. A faintly discernible dark door slowly opened, and the aura of hell spread out.</p><p>The black and white wheel in Xuan Bei’s hand descended and enveloped the myriad realm general knowledge talisman. One after another, golden myriad characters took shape, and they bore into it with black and white light.</p><p>Suddenly, the glazed golden light flourished and covered the dark door. A figure slowly appeared and outlined the image of the white-haired old man.</p><p>Tian wanzhe’s eyes welled up with tears when he saw this figure. He called out anxiously, “Father!”</p><p>In the Netherworld, a Buddhist light flashed and the Ghost Messengers temporarily lost their senses. When they recovered and checked their area of jurisdiction, they realized that one of them was missing.</p><p>“It’s that bunch of bald donkeys again. They always snatch people away from us!”The leading ghost messengers gnashed their teeth in hatred.</p><p>In the past, when Fengdu the Great Emperor was in a deep sleep and the secret development of the Netherworld realm was unknown to outsiders, they would not dare to fight over the souls of the dead when they encountered monks and Daoists who were recruiting ghosts and ferrying the souls of the resentful spirits. They did not want to expose themselves. After the incident with the Wang clan in Jiangdong.., the Netherworld realm was half exposed to the sight of the Almighty and powerful divine arts practitioners. There was no need for them to have any more scruples. However, the Buddha and venerated immortals were there to ferry away the souls of those related to them.</p><p>And the first to do so was the Yuan Huang venerated immortal from the Jade Void Palace of Mount Kunlun. He had almost destroyed the netherworld by forcefully taking away the ghost named Luo Shengyi!</p><p>It was precisely because of this grievance that the ghost messenger could not help but be angry when he encountered such a thing. However, he could only be angry. The matter of a few ghosts might not even catch the attention of the judges. They were so insignificant that they were not worth mentioning.</p><p>..</p><p>In the Jade Void Palace of Kunlun Mountain, Meng Qi did not go out. He was still sitting in the dark.</p><p>He did not have any extravagant hopes of divining the secrets of the heavens. At the right time, he would be able to hide the fact that he had used the universal knowing talisman to bind his soul from the great divine arts practitioners. However, as his disciple, he had secretly helped his master perfect the Pure Land, it was a matter of course for him to fulfill his wish to release the vengeful souls and evil ghosts so that he could improve his golden body as soon as possible. It was what he should do. As long as he did not go overboard, he would not attract too much attention, and no one would stop him.</p><p>His attitude of avoiding Xuan bei was a clear demonstration of his stance, which meant that he did not intend to do anything in the underworld.</p><p>And his true purpose of hiding his true purpose was a trick he had learned from the repeated schemes of the gold emperor. He was helping his master improve in the open, but he was doing it in the dark!</p><p>Of course, he could not do what the gold emperor did without any smoke and fire. It was inevitable that he would be suspected by those experts who were very concerned about the matters in the underworld of the netherworld. They would use Xuan bei as bait to divert their attention, he would quietly achieve other goals.</p><p>Therefore, in this aspect of thinking, he had gone deeper. The key was clearly in his master, but the secret was also in his master. It was not in himself!</p><p>The Pure Land, which seemed weak and had no future, could effectively deceive many experts!</p><p>As for whether this would be able to deceive the important figures on the other shore, to be honest, Meng Qi was not very confident. However, he had the cover of the Azure Emperor and even the primordial Lord of Heaven. The hope was not small.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
