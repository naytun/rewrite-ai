The world was safe and sound</p><p>Xiao Tianquan immediately followed the order and left the palace. He returned to his residence and activated the ‘Yuan Huang Fu Zhao’.</p><p>Blood-red light rose and brown fog surrounded him. An ancient stone door with the intent of life and death appeared in front of him. It was blurry and hazy.</p><p>The stone door was half-closed, revealing a crack. He could vaguely see the scene behind him. It was a deep and dark world. It was a flowing blood-brown river. It was the haze and death fog that shrouded the world.</p><p>Xiao Tianquan activated his divine ability and summoned the projection of him and me related to the underworld. His body gradually disappeared and completely merged with the void. He passed through the crack, trying to step into the Ghost Company of the underworld in his dream.</p><p>After a cold and illusory feeling, Xiao Tianquan had already sneaked in. He saw the blood-brown river connecting the entire underworld. He did not know where it came from or where it flowed to. Countless ghosts and ghosts were floating in it, from time to time, they would let out mournful cries, as if they would never be able to escape.</p><p>The flowers on the other side of the river bloomed, embellishing the deathly stillness. It made people forget their worries, forget their pain, and forget their past. On the river, there were towering and ancient stone bridges that led to the depths of the netherworld, the place where the reincarnation quietly revolved.</p><p>At this moment, every stone bridge was heavily guarded. With the judges leading the way and Ghost King Yin Shuai’s assistance, it was difficult for even half a fly from the outside world to sneak in.</p><p>Xiao Tianquan had long noticed the abnormality in the netherworld. A few days ago, when Master Xuan bei used the universal common sense talisman to ferry the souls of the deceased here, everything suddenly went smoothly, and there was no longer the feeling of sneaking around, according to the ghosts who had successfully escaped, the Netherworld was in chaos, and the Messengers of death were in a constant state of panic, so they did not have the mood to look after them.</p><p>This abnormality only ended yesterday, and things seemed to have returned to their old ways.</p><p>After merging into the void, the invisible Xiao Tianquan took small steps and approached the stone bridge to see if there was a chance to sneak in. However, the stone bridge was not only guarded by the judges and yin marshals, but it had also activated a powerful forbidden spell to guard against all kinds of concealment methods, with Xiao Tianquan’s grasp of the void seal, it would be very difficult for him to pass through it without anyone knowing.</p><p>Therefore, the slightest carelessness would immediately expose his hiding place. Although after Fengdu’s death, he was not afraid of the Ten Palace Ghost Emperors, who were all people whose strength could not be compared to his own, who knew what kind of changes had happened in the underworld these few days, would there be a new powerful ruler appearing.</p><p>Just as Xiao Tianquan was in a dilemma, he realized that the ‘Yuan emperor talisman Imperial decree’that had previously manifested an ancient stone door did not disappear directly. It floated over soundlessly and stuck to his back, it gathered the Qi of the Netherworld that hid life in death and contained death in life.</p><p>With a thought, Xiao Tianquan distanced himself from the Stone Bridge and tentatively walked into the blood-brown long river.</p><p>The wailing ghost completely ignored the Xiao Tianquan’s existence, as if it was really just a part of the void. The river water that could wash away intelligence and did not have buoyancy quietly changed, as if it was surrounding it.</p><p>Therefore, the Xiao Tianquan quietly crossed the underworld and stepped into the depths of the netherworld.</p><p>If it did not know what was good for it, it really wanted to bark and express its pride.</p><p>Even some heavenly venerates did not dare to touch too much of the river of the Netherworld’s water. Xiao Tianquan could roam freely without falling!</p><p>Xiao Tianquan did not delay. It dived towards the places that connected to the myriad universe and covered the dark halls. Halfway there, it suddenly stopped because its sharp senses sensed that there was an extremely terrifying existence behind the halls, even if it did not deliberately target it, it could still make its heart skip a beat. If it really approached the place of reincarnation, it would probably be discovered on the spot.</p><p>“Is it the new Lord of Hell?”Xiao Tianquan pondered for a while and circled around the place of reincarnation and the dark halls, giving up on going deeper.</p><p>After a while, it met two patrolling judges who were whispering and communicating with each other through voice transmission.</p><p>Seeing this, Xiao Tianquan, who was hiding in the void, opened its mouth and revealed a bright smile. It quietly activated the ‘Yuan Xin seal’and used its heart to peer into the heart, eavesdropping on the other party’s words.</p><p>“Sigh, I thought that the emperor could ascend to the highest level, but I didn’t expect him to die so early.”The judge, who was still dressed in black, sighed.</p><p>The judge, who had a circle of blood on his sleeve, also replied with mixed emotions, “Under the other shore, if we really want to die, we’ll just die. Forget it, the change of the Lord of Hell doesn’t affect us much. No matter who takes over the netherworld, they’ll have to use us. We can’t do everything ourselves, right?”</p><p>“I’m just afraid that all my previous efforts will go down the drain,”the black-robed judge said nervously, “In order to improve on the Ghost God True Spirit map, I’ve always tried to curry favor with the Yama King and ignore the other Nine Palace Ghost Emperors to show my loyalty. Now that nine spirit primordial saint has become the Master of the underworld, it seems that he has placed great importance on the Samsara King and King Qinguang… Sigh, I’m really afraid that they’ll find the wrong place and send me to reincarnation.”</p><p>Nine spirits original Saint became the new master of the Underworld? Xiao Tianquan was stunned.</p><p>He was not surprised by this result. Emperor Qing was the only person who could walk on the other side of the world. Fengdu was dead and the underworld was lost. If he wanted to interfere, who could compete with him?</p><p>And he gave the position of the Master of the underworld to his mount nine spirits original saint, the great saint who had completed his destiny.</p><p>The judge with a circle of blood-brown on his sleeve looked left and right, and the tone of their voice transmission became solemn, there was a hint of gloominess, “I heard a piece of news from the Yama Temple. After nine spirits original Saint entered the underworld, he did not find the Ghost God True Spirit map. It seems that it has been taken away a long time ago.”</p><p>“What? The Ghost God True Spirit map has been lost?”The black-robed judge was shocked.</p><p>Their abhijnas, magic power, and official rank all came from the Ghost God True Spirit map. It could be said that they were completely suppressed by this magic treasure. Now, the Master of the underworld was the master of the underworld, and the Master of the Ghost God True Spirit map was another expert.., in the future, when they encountered a conflict, they were really in a dilemma.</p><p>The most frightening thing was that the person who obtained the Ghost God True Spirit map saw that he had no hope of entering the underworld, so he simply wiped out all the true spirits in it and let himself vanish into thin air.</p><p>They talked about this matter in fear, and Xiao Tianquan, who had received the important news, quietly left. He crossed the Yellow Springs again, left the Netherworld, and returned to the hollow jade temple of Mount Kunlun, he told everything in detail in front of the Hierarch Immortal Venerable Meng Qi.</p><p>As expected, the Green Emperor also had his own ideas, so he made the nine spirits original saint the Master of the underworld… Meng Qi nodded slightly. This was an important piece of news.</p><p>The important thing was not who the lord of the underworld was, but that he could not simply treat the green emperor as a subordinate of some ancient man.</p><p>Every other shore was the will of heaven, not someone else’s puppet!</p><p>In the future, he would have to partially adjust his attitude toward the green emperor. For the time being, he would not activate the matters of the Pure Land of Hell at his master’s place, lest the will of heaven was like a knife.</p><p>As for the disappearance of the true spirit map of the Ghost God, Meng Qi could guess what was going on even with his toes. It must have been the Bodhi ancient Buddha who sensed that one of the three corpses had fallen at the first moment, which was why he took the true spirit map before the Green Emperor did, he took the Ghost God’s true spirit map through another chess piece.</p><p>No Wonder Bodhi ancient Buddha wanted to seal the god-sealing roll at the same time. He said when it would arrive. wasn’t he just waiting for Fengdu the great emperor to complete his dao of life and death and completely awaken himself?</p><p>Based on this deduction, Bodhi ancient Buddha temporarily gave up the netherworld, but he grasped the key of the Ghost God’s true spirit map and waited for an opportunity. He didn’t want to compete with the Green Emperor when he traveled the world.</p><p>However, he didn’t know if the true spirit map of the Ghost God had returned to him, or if it was still on that chess piece, so he could cover his tracks..</p><p>Meng Qi thought for a while and put this matter aside temporarily. He didn’t conflict with the Green Emperor and still hid the wheel of life and death in the origin as a prepared chess piece. He closed his eyes and divided his attention to the newly born universe to sense the intention of opening up, he used this to condense and sublimate the “Heaven opening seal”.</p><p>After an unknown amount of time, he suddenly had a thought. He opened his eyes and looked outside the Daoist Temple.</p><p>Under the shade of the trees, he saw a middle-aged man with the demeanor of an immortal. He had five long whiskers and a pale golden face. He was Guang Chengzi, one of the nine great figures of the Daoist sect!</p><p>“Senior Brother Guang Chengzi is honored to have you here. I am sorry for not welcoming you.”Meng Qi smiled and appeared in front of Guang Chengzi.</p><p>Guangcheng zi chuckled. “There’s no need to be so courteous, junior brother Headmaster. I have a matter to discuss on this trip. I hope you will agree to ring the ancient bell of Kunlun and gather the disciples of Yuxu sect to discuss what we should do next.”</p><p>Hearing Guangcheng Zi’s words, Meng Qi felt quite comfortable. At least, Guangcheng Zi, the celestial venerable, did not treat his position as the headmaster as nothing. Instead, he rang the bell and gathered the disciples. Instead, he personally came to discuss the matter.</p><p>“What should we do next?”Meng Qi asked.</p><p>Guang Chengzi looked into Meng Qi’s eyes with a smile:</p><p>“Since the Jade Void faction supports the human emperor, we should try to accumulate as much as possible and expand our advantage before the other side returns. Now that the god Ascension Roll has fallen to the Netherworld realm, I wonder what Junior Brother Hierarch plans to do?”</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
