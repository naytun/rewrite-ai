As for these countless illusory tributaries.., other than those that had long been premeditated to be “Unable to pass,”even Meng Qi himself could not measure the newly emerged parts clearly in a short period of time. Similarly, he was also unable to make an accurate judgment in a split second, he chose those possibilities that could allow him to cross the river of Destiny.</p><p>However, as soon as he spoke, life appeared. His body seemed to be pulled by fate. He took a step forward and just happened to step into one of the tributaries, surging into the future with it.</p><p>“Destiny”was illusory and unpredictable. Meng Qi was bobbing up and down, drifting with the current. After an unknown amount of time, the river finally disappeared, and an ordinary stone door appeared before his eyes. The restrictions were weak, ordinary warriors could easily push it open.</p><p>..</p><p>Outside the secret area of the sect, in front of the ancient bronze door, a loud voice echoed. The river of Destiny filled the sky and washed away the dust of time.</p><p>Many gazes looked over from every position on the Zhixu Mountain. They watched the illusory river appear and its tributaries change. It could no longer be called destiny and could not be changed.</p><p>After a long period of silence, the roaring and surging waves calmed down and gradually faded away, leaving behind a brilliant multicolored glow in the sky above the secret land. It crossed the mountain range and was hazy and beautiful, just like the light of Buddha.</p><p>“Has Su Meng really passed the Third Test?”The black-robed old woman looked at the middle-aged scholar as if she was seeking confirmation. It was as if she could not believe her own judgment.</p><p>The middle-aged scholar’s lips moved a few times. Finally, a bitter smile appeared on his face. “Ever since the founder fell into a deep sleep, no one has been able to pass the third test. How can I judge? I can only wait for Su Meng to come out and verify it from his mouth.”</p><p>He paused for a moment before continuing, “However, the extraordinary scene of the Buddha’s radiance and rosy clouds has already appeared. Su Meng has most likely passed the river of predestination.”</p><p>As the current sect master of Void Mountain, he originally wanted to say that he would know once he went in and took a look. However, he realized that there was a very big problem when he was about to say it. From the nature of the three tests in the secret land, they were not set up to fail just because someone had passed them, unless it was completely destroyed by violence, if Su Meng was able to cross the river of Destiny, he and the others would probably still look at the “River”and sigh. They could only judge su Meng’s condition from the fact that he was not at the side of the river. In this way.., there might be too many possibilities.</p><p>Yue Ziqing was no longer in a puppet state. Her eyes were burning with a crazy flame, as if she was arguing with someone, she said, “Although it is hard to believe that fate can be changed by a mighty being, the abnormality of the river of Destiny is enough to reveal a lot.”</p><p>She seemed to be impatient to enter and study the current state of the River of Destiny.</p><p>At this moment, streaks of light flew over. Layers upon layers of elders and disciples of the ancient bronze gate were still alive. They asked questions one after another, but no one allowed the other to do so, making the scene seem like a gathering of 100,000 ducks, it was so noisy that it almost turned the sky upside down.</p><p>The body-reporting strongman appeared and silenced the noise. The black-clothed old woman frowned, she muttered to herself, “Based on our research on the river of predestination, we can be sure that other than the other shore or those who are well-known in the dao of time, it is impossible for anyone to successfully cross the river of predestination. Even if the Patriarch awakens and recovers to his peak, as long as he does not use his identity as the founder of Void Mountain to control the forbidden technique, he will probably not be able to cross the river of predestination…”</p><p>The middle-aged scholar shook his head and sighed. “Although Su Meng is the cause of all the ‘Karma’in the current era, and it is difficult to deduce and calculate clearly, it is not difficult to know that he is involved with several important figures on the other shore. Moreover, he still has the overlord blade in his hand.”</p><p>“Perhaps it’s precisely because of the imprint and other things left behind on the other shore that he was able to disrupt the river of predestination and create new possibilities for the future. However, it’s also not easy to do this. If I were to change locations, I’m afraid that I won’t be able to do it…”</p><p>As he spoke up to here, his expression turned serious as he looked at the black-clothed old woman, he said to the surrounding elders and disciples, “In our concept of the Void Stop Mountain, it’s best to say fewer words like ‘certain’, ‘certain’, and ‘absolute’. The Great Dao is ephemeral and filled with unknowns. Currently, we’re only able to study a very, very small portion of it. Perhaps there really is another way to bypass the river of predestination, and it’s outside the scope of our research. We’ll first enter a few of you to take a look at the current situation of the river of predestination and gather current information so that we can study it in the future.”</p><p>The black-robed old woman nodded reluctantly and followed him into the ancient bronze gate. The few elders and Yue Ziqing followed closely behind. The densely packed Zhixu mountain gate did not disperse. Instead, they continued to gather here, their eyes filled with excitement, they were waiting for further news. Some even brought their own artifacts to do research while waiting.</p><p>This was the ‘River of Destiny’that had stumped generations of experts from the Zhixu Mountain</p><p>..</p><p>After passing through the ‘River of Destiny’, Meng Qi had a splitting headache. The amount of ‘Karmic Transference’was close to the limit of ‘Karmic Transference’, and it was a little too much for him, however, after stroking the blade of the absolute saber and seeing the last stone door of the secret land, a smile still appeared on his face.</p><p>With a casual wave of his hand, the stone door with the weak restriction opened with the wind, and the scene behind appeared in Meng Qi’s eyes.</p><p>Eh… at a glance, he began to mumble in his heart, and astonishment welled up in his heart.</p><p>This was a scene of ruins. There were broken artifacts everywhere, as if they had experienced a terrifying and violent explosion. However, the strange thing was that the explosion did not spread out to a stone door that did not have any isolation effect at all, it was only limited to an area of about a few hundred Zhang.</p><p>It could be seen that there were originally walls separating this place, and there were many rooms. At this moment, the broken walls and ruins could not be found, only strange-shaped fragments.</p><p>It did not seem like a normal situation… Meng Qi’s heart sank, and he suspected that something had happened here.</p><p>Someone had used a magical method to bypass the river of predestination, come here, and destroy this place?</p><p>Or was it simply some big shot from the other shore? However, with the ability of the big shot from the other shore, he could raze this place to the ground with a flick of his finger after an endless period of time. He couldn’t find anything.</p><p>As he strolled in, Meng Qi picked up a few pieces of debris and pondered. Some of them were pure green, while others were glazed green. Each color was different, but they were all lifeless. They had been destroyed from the inside out, he could no longer use them as trash.</p><p>As he sent his spiritual sense in, Meng Qi began to carefully analyze the ’causes of all the fruits’.</p><p>Black and white swirled in his eyes. Life and death were endless, and he could vaguely see countless flames. Suddenly, everything disappeared. A hint of astonishment could be seen in his eyes:</p><p>“It actually feels like he has completed his destiny…”</p><p>“Could it be that the founder of the Void Mountain sect, one of the six Outer Dao Masters, has found the remains of a great divine arts practitioner or used a secret technique to cut off a part of his body to refine the original form of this broken item?”</p><p>Normally speaking, even the other shore of fortune was unable to directly use a part of his dharmic body to refine artifacts and pills, and then rely on the derivation of flesh and blood to recover. This cycle was endless, because once this kind of thing left his body.., it would lose its vitality and destroy many of its characteristics, preventing it from interfering with the original body. It was far inferior to the remains of the body, and the artifacts and pills refined were of a much lower grade. Therefore, if one really wanted to use it, they could only rely on the Great Dao to cut off this part forever, he would never be able to recover.</p><p>And the strange objects he refined in this way were actually destroyed and scattered all over the ground?</p><p>His spiritual sense spread out and covered the surroundings. Meng Qi concentrated on searching. Not long after, he found something similar to the fragments. They were pieces of incomplete jade slips. They seemed to be placed in the most tightly protected place, they did not turn into ashes.</p><p>He picked up the first jade slip and there was only one line of content left:</p><p>“Measurement of the river of time…”</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly. He roughly understood what they were. These were the research insights of the founder of the Void Mountain sect before he went into a deep sleep. They were his exploration of the path to the other shore!</p><p>The subsequent Jade slips confirmed his guess. There were words such as “Communication,””Backtracking,””The past,”and “The future,”but there were only these left. He could not see the specific content at all, it made Meng Qi sigh.</p><p>He picked up the last jade slip and read it again.</p><p>“Huh, it’s actually relatively well-preserved,”he suddenly whispered. He was a little excited and focused on reading:</p><p>“… legend has it that after the fall of fate, there are often traces left in heaven and earth that carry a certain amount of fate. It’s the same on the other shore. There are still traces left in the primordial heavenly God, the Eastern Emperor, the ancient heavenly emperor of the Hou Tu, and so on…”</p><p>“… These traces are similar to the marks in heaven and earth, but they have completely lost their vitality and there is no possibility of resurrection. Similarly, they are also indistinct and difficult to sense…”</p><p>“… I cut off my left arm and made it into an object. I placed it in the place where I was sleeping and sensed and searched for those marks…”</p><p>“After tens of thousands of years, I was awakened from my slumber. It turns out that I gained something after a long search!”</p><p>“If I can study these marks clearly, I can look forward to the other shore!”</p><p>The content was cut off at this point. The rest was blank. It was unknown whether it was destroyed or not.</p><p>Meng Qi’s eyes were solemn. He looked around again, but there was still nothing but devastation.</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
