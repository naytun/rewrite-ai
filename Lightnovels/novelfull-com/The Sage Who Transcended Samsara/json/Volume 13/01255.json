From behind her, it enveloped her.</p><p>The deepest and most profound intent of death spread out from there, interweaving with vigorous vitality. The two attracted the resonance of heaven and earth, “Composing”their own “Theme song”, and mixing with each other and clearly existing at the same time, it was exceptionally mysterious.</p><p>The melody was beautiful, and the immortal music descended horizontally. The Aura was like Ruan Yushu who was frozen listening to it, slightly startled. Then, he forgot his worries, forgot his mind, forgot his things, and entered a state of forgetting himself.</p><p>This song only existed because of “The world”, how many times would one hear it in the human world!</p><p>Her eyes, which were now intoxicated, suddenly blurred, as if she saw a familiar figure flash past, accompanied by the pitch-black and desperate intent of Yin death, and thrown into the surrounding vortex.</p><p>The vortex suddenly froze, then slowed down, shrinking rapidly at an astonishing speed.</p><p>At this moment, Ruan Yushu suddenly felt a sense of alienation in his surroundings. The Void was no longer real, but it was like the boundary of a dream, making his connection with the outside world hazy and uncertain.</p><p>The sense of alienation disappeared in an instant, but the vortex of life and death also condensed into the first colorless dot, and the Dao Qilun voice became more and more ethereal.</p><p>In the realm of the Fusang ancient tree, there was a leaf that looked like a mulberry, bathed in golden fire. Emperor Qing stood on it, his figure blurry. The right hand hanging by the side flashed with a green light, and it blurred and melted.</p><p>The connection between him and the “Book of life and death”that he had refined was cleverly cut off.</p><p>“It’s him?”Emperor Qing’s eyes were deep, and he muttered to himself, as if he was guessing and doubting.</p><p>..</p><p>The colorless dot disappeared, and Ruan Yushu naturally stepped into the Earth immortal realm. Moreover, he listened to the “Sound of near-dao”produced by the resonance of Heaven and Earth, which was of great benefit to his cultivation in the future.</p><p>At the same time, Meng Qi also stepped into the “Origin of life and death”again. He still could not see anything, hear anything, or sense anything with his spiritual sense.</p><p>The old model shattered like a glass wall and faded like the tide. The new cognition connected with the outside world, bringing with it their own abstract descriptions, coldness, depression, coldness, darkness, silence, death and warmth, enthusiasm, exuberance, joy, light, vitality, and so on all surged over, it triggered the stress changes in Meng Qi’s acupoints, flesh, and ‘internal organs’.</p><p>Beside Meng Qi, the mysterious Fengdu Emperor finally revealed his true form.</p><p>The most intuitive feeling he gave people was that he was tall. It was not that he was beyond imagination after Meng Qi’s celestial phenomenon. Instead, it was a different kind of magic. At most, he was more than nine feet tall, but he stood there like an endless, heavy mountain range, it made Meng Qi feel like he was looking up at a tall mountain.</p><p>Emperor Fengdu was wearing a pitch-black full-body armor that completely covered his head. Only his two eyes were revealed. They were deep and dark, as if they were the most serene and heavy death. They contained an eternal silence within, a little bit of vitality evolved into his eyes. They were hidden at the bottom of the darkness, forming a delicate balance with his surroundings.</p><p>His overall aura was restrained and unfathomable.</p><p>Meng Qi narrowed his eyes, and a glass lamp appeared in his eyes. It was going to quietly illuminate the important karma related to Emperor Fengdu so that he could find out who the person behind him was.</p><p>The black and white light of the ancient glass lamp swirled and surged, but the Emperor Fengdu in his sight was in darkness. It seemed that even the Karma Connection had died and was difficult to discover!</p><p>“To be able to use a clever method and suppression of his realm to hide from the illumination of karma, Emperor Fengdu is indeed extraordinary…”Meng Qi sighed to himself and looked away.</p><p>“Let’s go. We’ll go deeper. We’ll go closer to the path,”Emperor Fengdu said in a deep and majestic voice. His hands were behind his back, and there was not a hint of malice in them. Of course, there was also no good intention in them.</p><p>Meng Qi nodded slightly. He took half a step behind Emperor Fengdu and flew into the depths of his memories.</p><p>Along the way, he maintained the method of tempering life and death for a while to achieve a balance and gradually improve. Emperor Fengdu walked in the abstract “Death”, occasionally, he would immerse himself in the “Life”.</p><p>The two of them did not speak and silently moved forward. There was a great distance between them, and they enjoyed the benefits of the “Origin of life and death”.</p><p>While he was on high alert, Meng Qi gradually felt that his true spirit, thoughts, and spiritual light of his nature were being contaminated by the Dao of life and death. He couldn’t help but follow their changes and develop in their direction.</p><p>This was the assimilation of Dao!</p><p>Black and white light blossomed from his hands. One was Yin and the other was Yang. One was dead and the other was alive. They formed two fish with their heads and tails intertwined. However, there was no life hidden in death, and there was no death hidden in life.</p><p>The light descended and enveloped Meng Qi. He used his yin-yang seal to resist the assimilation of Dao at his current level. Emperor Fengdu, who was beside him, did not have any aura. He seemed to be taking a leisurely stroll.</p><p>After going deeper, a dark, primordial Qi of the Supreme Infinity rushed out of Meng Qi’s Niwan. Streams of chaotic Qi hung down, isolating the outside world and maintaining his intelligence. However, Emperor Fengdu did not change, the difference between the two was obvious.</p><p>Behind the Yuan Shi Qing Yun was the Overlord Blade, and behind the Overlord Blade was the life and death book refined by the Green Emperor. Meng Qi seemed to have no time to hide anymore and exposed all his tricks.</p><p>Suddenly, the gaps of Emperor Fengdu’s armor emitted a dark fog, making him appear even more hazy.</p><p>“To reach the limit of his realm, I have to rely on Abhijna?”Meng Qi seemed to be thinking about something. The saber in his hand hung low, and lightning flashed like water.</p><p>In the endless abstract concepts and the increasingly dense descriptions, Meng Qi’s eyes suddenly lit up. He once again saw the black-robed true martial emperor, the crown of the flat sky, he and Fengdu had unknowingly walked in front of him!</p><p>Compared to the previous time, the true martial emperor’s state of being neither alive nor dead was no longer balanced. It was slowly tilting toward life. This process was slow first, then fast, and gradually accumulated the gap. When a certain limit was reached, the flood would break the dike, it was majestic and completed in an instant.</p><p>“True martial emperor is indeed too greedy.”Feng du Emperor, who had been silent throughout the process, suddenly spoke. His tone was somewhat emotional.</p><p>Meng Qi quietly pulled some distance away and deliberately asked, “True martial emperor set up the Yellow Springs as a backup plan. It was not because of greed that led to assimilation.”</p><p>Feng du Emperor stopped in his tracks and looked down at true martial emperor, who was sitting on the ground, he said calmly, “Those who have ambitions for the other side will choose their current Dao carefully and abandon the parts that are too strong in conflict. This way, their foundation will be cleansed and it will be easier to condense the illusory dao fruit. Just like Green Emperor’s wood element, life force, time, and void, the four dao of oneself are not incompatible with fire and water, and the conflict is difficult to reconcile</p><p>“While it sounds good, it means that one has lofty ambitions, but it sounds bad, it means that one is greedy and always wants to condense the illusory dao fruit with two conflicting dao of oneself. The Yin and Yang will be reconciled and form Tai Chi. In this way, in the future, if one wants to master and condense the other Dao of the universe and complete the embryonic form of the dao fruit, it will be twice the result with half the effort.”</p><p>While Meng Qi was on guard, he listened quietly. Suddenly, he understood why the twelve gold immortals of the jade void sect only cultivated one or two of the first nine seals. They were not like him, who cultivated nine seals at the same time and would not let go of eight or nine seals.., it seemed that in the blessed realm, one had to be tolerant and inclusive. With the limitless seal, the heaven opening seal, and the first seal of Dao, all the External Dao would be revealed. Once one reached the other shore, other than time, there would almost be the embryonic form of dao fruit, which would be close to the real.., an indescribable ‘Dao’.</p><p>No wonder the ‘nine seals are gathered and the origin is born’. Other than me, who else in the jade void sect would add difficulty to themselves for no reason?</p><p>If one thought about it again, the Golden Emperor, who had cultivated the limitless seal and obtained the Dao of chaos, would probably not be at the bottom of the other shore..</p><p>“Emperor Zhenwu wanted to use the Dao of life and death as the foundation of his illusory dao fruit, so he was greedy and went deep into it?”Meng Qi asked.</p><p>Emperor Fengdu laughed, however, it was hard to tell what was good or bad. “Zhenwu was so greedy that he was almost assimilated. It wasn’t because he was too ambitious. He wanted to use the two conflicting daos as the foundation of the other shore. Instead, he chose the Dao of life and death and left himself unable to protect himself for a long time!”</p><p>“Because of the later Earth, there was a cycle of reincarnation between heaven and earth. Life and death were the easiest to reconcile out of all the conflicting daos. They were the easiest to form Tai Chi. Zhenwu was an innate spirit. He used water to nurture life and used water to destroy evil and bring about death. That was why he was known as the demon Slayer. It was natural for him to choose life and death as the foundation. However, after he chose this path that many coveted, he actually dared to take the risk of assimilating and complete the crucial step of reconciliation.”</p><p>“Humph, so what if he has a backup plan?”? “He is not the other shore. How can we guarantee that there will be no accidents in the long-lasting arrangement? It can even be said that there will definitely be accidents. Right now, who knows how many great divine arts practitioners and even important figures do not want to see him walk out of the origin of life and death alive.”</p><p>Meng Qi was stunned. He sighed and said,</p><p>“So one of the reasons you entered the origin of life and death is to get rid of great Emperor Zhen Wu.”</p><p>Great Emperor Fengdu turned to look at him, he said lightly, “The greedy words just now were also suitable for you. In order to refine part of the origin of life and death, you actually dared to follow me in. So what if you have a backup plan? So what if there are Guang Cheng, Wen Shu, and the others hidden in the sleeve cosmos?”</p><p>He paused and said, “It’s a pity that you changed your mind and didn’t use the sleeve cosmos to bring Guang Cheng Zi and the others in. Otherwise, it would be a great thing to destroy most of the experts of the hollow jade temple in one battle!”</p><p>Emperor Fengdu seemed to know Meng Qi’s preparations very well, and when he spoke of wiping out most of the experts of the hollow jade temple in one battle, he seemed to be very confident!</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
