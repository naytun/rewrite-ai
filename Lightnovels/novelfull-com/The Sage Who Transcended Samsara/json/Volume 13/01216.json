She had described clearly what was the “General trend”, what was predestination, and what was doomed, what was something that was bound to happen in every future, and now that they had encountered a forbidden technique built on top of it, it was naturally not out of the ordinary.</p><p>However, Meng Qi had never thought that void end mountain’s founding patriarch would use this to test his disciples. Other than the big figures on the other side, only those who had a strong destiny that was formed by time or those who possessed such rare treasures could pass the third stage, only then would they be able to pass the third stage!</p><p>It was no wonder that even though the void end mountain had endless talents and experts, they were still unable to pass through this illusory river and see the things left behind by the founder!</p><p>Was he really testing his descendants and not the other side?</p><p>However, if the other side really came, this illusory river would be as fragile as a baby in a swaddle and would not be able to withstand the destruction.</p><p>Therefore, Meng Qi was quite surprised. It seemed that there was a dead end in front of him. With his current realm, strength, and the Dao he was good at, there was no way he could pass the test!</p><p>Retracting his mind and examining his thoughts, Meng Qi got rid of the emotion of retreating in the face of difficulties. He took a step forward and truly stepped into the illusory river.</p><p>If he did not work hard and did not go through practice, how could he be sure that he really could not pass the test? What if this forbidden technique had some unimaginably loopholes?</p><p>It was not a good thing to give up too easily.</p><p>The illusory river water washed over like the baptism of time. A glass lamp appeared in Meng Qi’s eyes, and a long river of time and fate surrounded him. It looked the same, the same illusion, but it was getting more and more lofty.</p><p>This was the feature of his other shore!</p><p>With this long river around him, Meng Qi sank to the bottom of the forbidden river like a reef. He endured the erosion without moving an inch. He relaxed his mind and used the spiritual light of his nature, which was located at an infinite height, to perceive the information that poured in from the past, he examined all kinds of possibilities in the future:</p><p>He used the limitless seal, the heaven opening seal, the Dao one seal, and so on, but he failed in the end. He couldn’t pass because the original incipient golden seal hadn’t reached the creation realm yet</p><p>Borrowing the immortal slaying four swords, one Qi turned into three pure ones and set up the number one killing formation in the immemorial realm. It disturbed time and space, but it was still unable to cut the river due to its current level. The time turbulence caused by the disturbance would hinder one’s own crossing</p><p>Using all the supernatural abilities and inviting the help of Yu Xu, he used the meteor escape to erase all the information about the current situation and tried to rebuild the future. However, the current situation was shattered, and everything returned to nothingness, it was even more impossible for him to pass</p><p>With the help of external forces, the Void Mountain suddenly suffered a calamity. The illusory river was shattered, but the secret land also vanished into thin air</p><p>..</p><p>Scenes of the future appeared in front of Meng Qi’s eyes, indicating that fate was set in stone. The situation was set in stone and could not be changed. No matter how he struggled, he would meet an end that he could not pass.</p><p>His Daoist robe fluttered in the wind, and the strands of hair on his bamboo crown swayed along with the invisible water. It was as if they were going to be stained with a sliver of silver. Meng Qi held on to his limits and took a step back, exiting the illusory river.</p><p>“The only way seems to be what I said to Yue Ziqing. become the other shore, go back to the past, and change history. From there, we can weave the current state and information, and derive a future that is different from the past. In order to break fate, we can only allow the things that are bound to happen to only exist in part of the possibilities…”Meng Qi frowned slightly, he thought about the conversation he had with Yue Ziqing earlier.</p><p>This was obviously not a good idea.</p><p>If he was on the other shore or the peak of creation, and he could trace back to the past, then what was the point of barging into the Void Mountain Secret Land?</p><p>As for the seven kills tablet, based on his previous experience, he probably wouldn’t be able to borrow it.</p><p>And if he were to slightly control fate and change the characteristics of the other shore in the future, it wouldn’t be of any use at the moment. Because the essence was to influence time and the long river of fate, causing the target to fall into the future that he had decided on, for example, the future of “Always being on the same side”was used to shape fate.</p><p>This kind of future was not created by him, but one of the countless tributaries of the river of time and fate. They encompassed almost all the possibilities, and most of the differences between the “Future”were only slight, there was no difference in the general trend, so he could take advantage of the situation. Therefore, he could slightly influence the river of time and lead his fate to the desired tributaries. It was a trick, but now it involved something that was destined to happen, no matter how he guided it, it would be useless!</p><p>Meng Qi stood in front of the illusory river like a statue, completely unable to find the direction.</p><p>Leaving or waking up little sang and asking her for advice seemed to be the only choice</p><p>This matter should only come from the other side.</p><p>..</p><p>One by one, gazes swept across the secret area of the sect, shocked by the blossoming of the ice and snow rays like fireworks.</p><p>One of the highest achievements of their sect had actually been seen through and grasped by ‘Origin Emperor’Su Meng in just a few hours?</p><p>Could it be that this was the so-called ‘Understanding Everything’? However, there were still legends in Zhixu Mountain that said that the elders were still unable to increase the synchronization rate of their creations to the point that they could pass through the ‘wall of Stop’!</p><p>It was said that the origin nine seals contained ten thousand daos. Therefore, Su Meng was able to grasp the mysteries of body-sacrificing strongmen or godheads in a high-level way?</p><p>In the main hall of the sect, the white-robed scholar and the black-robed old woman sighed and reported the matter of the strongmen. They looked in the direction of the ancient bronze gate and fell into deep thought. After a while, they came back to their senses.</p><p>“When I first faced the river of Destiny, I was in complete despair. I couldn’t imagine such a difficult problem,”the old woman in black said, she recalled her own experience when she faced the third trial.</p><p>The white-robed scholar smiled bitterly and said, “Who isn’t? To us, to all legends, and to the vast majority of fortunes, this is an unsolvable difficult problem.”</p><p>After saying that, the two of them fell into silence again, as if they had forgotten their previous dispute. After a few breaths, the black-robed old woman seemed to have nothing to say as she said, “Do you think Su Meng can pass through the River of Destiny?”</p><p>Her tone was erratic, as if she was just imagining a possibility.</p><p>“How is that possible?”The white-robed scholar Sighed and said, “This is the understanding of the path to the other shore that the founder of the sect comprehended. It’s a difficult problem that he designed for himself to ascend to the other shore. “Although the river of predestination in the secret land isn’t complete and is only a projection of a certain aspect to urge the disciples to study the future, it’s definitely not something that Su Meng can solve. It’s still the same saying. To us, to all legends, and to most of the fortunes, this is an unsolvable problem. It’s truly unsolvable in the sense of the word.”</p><p>“That’s true…”the black-robed old woman replied in a low voice.</p><p>Outside the ancient bronze door, the Sparks in Yue Ziqing’s eyes were slowly being suppressed. She had once again become a perfect “Puppet”, waiting for Meng Qi to come out.</p><p>Yes, he was about to come out.</p><p>In the past, even though Void Mountain did not interfere with worldly affairs and focused on reclusive research, it was not without guests. There were once a few great destiny realm divine ability users who came to visit.., they wanted to cross the river of Destiny to comprehend the path to the other shore, but they failed.</p><p>If they were still like this, what about Su Meng?</p><p>..</p><p>“The future is derived from all current states and information, and all current states and information are determined by the past. Therefore, if we don’t go back in time, we won’t be able to change the future…”Meng Qi stood with his hands behind his back, he was still thinking of a way to cross the river of predestination.</p><p>The river in front of him went east, flowing silently and silently.</p><p>He paced back and forth a few steps, meng Qi gradually realized a problem. “If it was the river of time and fate in the real world, then everything I thought before would be completely valid. But this isn’t the case. The past of the river of predestination is only the past of this world, and it doesn’t include external ‘variables’.”</p><p>In other words, the current situation of the ‘River of Fate’wasn’t completely determined by the past. External ‘variables’that didn’t belong to the ‘past of this world’could also influence it, thus shaping a different future.</p><p>Following this train of thought, Meng Qi once again extended his divine consciousness, circulating the causes of all fruits and the divine calculation of the Hollow Jade, comprehending every bit of the ‘River of Fate’.</p><p>“As expected, but what I can think of, the founder of Void Mountain naturally thought of as well.”Meng Qi nodded lightly, and there was no joy in his expression, “The forbidden technique in the river of predestination includes a huge variety of ‘variables’. It is handled in a rather mysterious way so that it can not change the ‘general trend’. For example, the ‘variables’of outsiders who are trying to cross the river of predestination, such as the ‘variables’of unexpected events, even the world-destroying meteorite, and the invasion of evil demons are taken into account…”</p><p>The train of thought that had just appeared was immediately blocked, but Meng Qi, who was not happy, did not show any signs of depression:</p><p>“Even though the void end mountain’s founder’s divination ability is extremely powerful for a time, it is not the other shore. It can not cover all the accidents. As long as we find the fish that escaped the net, we will be able to smash into the pond like a huge rock, creating ripples and waves, changing the future and changing fate…”</p><p>Human strength sometimes ran out!</p><p>Meng Qi’s current divination ability was undoubtedly far from the Void End Mountain’s founder. It was almost impossible to calculate the “Accidents”that the other party had missed. Therefore, he directly started to consider it from a macro perspective:</p><p>“My ’cause of all consequences’is obviously a ‘variable’that he can not accurately simulate, but it can be blurred. Relying on the current level of ’cause of all consequences’will not be able to cause big waves for the time being…”</p><p>“Things that involve the other shore must also be something that he had to leave out. It can only be blurred. Unfortunately, the absolute saber has only awakened to the legendary realm and has yet to completely suppress the brand of Devil Buddha…”</p><p>“The Devil Buddha brand, HMM, the Devil Buddha brand?”Meng Qi suddenly stopped and a crazy idea popped up in his mind.</p><p>This was the real thing left behind by the other shore. could he make a fuss about it?</p><p>Or even further weaken it?</p>", "images": {}, "success": true}
